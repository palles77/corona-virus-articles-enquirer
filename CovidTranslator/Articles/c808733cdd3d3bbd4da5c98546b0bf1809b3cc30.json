The 148amino acid nsp10 subunit contains two zinc fingers and is known to interact with both nsp14 and nsp16, stimulating their respective 3-5 exoribonuclease and 2-O-methyltransferase activities. Using alanine-scanning mutagenesis, in cellulo bioluminescence resonance energy transfer experiments, and in vitro pulldown assays, we have now identified the key residues on the nsp10 surface that interact with nsp14. The functional consequences of mutations introduced at these positions were first evaluated biochemically by monitoring nsp14 exoribonuclease activity. Disruption of the nsp10-nsp14 interaction abrogated the nsp10-driven activation of the nsp14 exoribonuclease. We further showed that the nsp10 surface interacting with nsp14 overlaps with the surface involved in the nsp10-mediated activation of nsp16 2-O-methyltransferase activity, suggesting that nsp10 is a major regulator of SARS-CoV replicase function. In line with this notion, reverse genetics experiments supported an essential role of the nsp10 surface that interacts with nsp14 in SARS-CoV replication, as several mutations that abolished the interaction in vitro yielded a replication-negative viral phenotype. In contrast, mutants in which the nsp10-nsp16 interaction was disturbed proved to be crippled but viable. These experiments imply that the nsp10 surface that interacts with nsp14 and nsp16 and possibly other subunits of the viral replication complex may be a target for the development of antiviral compounds against pathogenic coronaviruses.",

Coronaviruses (CoVs) 9 are respiratory and enteric pathogens of humans and domesticated animals and also appear to be omnipresent in wildlife, in particular in bats and rodents (3) (4) (5) . The capability to cross species barriers appears to be a widespread CoV feature, and all endemic human CoVs are thought to have been transmitted from animal hosts at some point in the past. CoVs can cause life-threatening zoonotic infections, and the emergence in humans, less than a decade apart, of CoVs causing severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) (6) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) (7, 8) emphasizes the significant pandemic potential of members of this virus family. SARS-CoV presumably emerged from bats in China in 2002, spread around the globe in a few months, and resulted in \u03fe8000 registered cases with a fatality rate of \u03f310% (3, 9, 10) . MERS-CoV emerged in the Middle East in 2012 and has thus far resulted in \u03fe800 laboratory-confirmed cases with a fatality rate around 35% (7, 8, 11, 12) .",

After virus entry, genome translation initiates a complex gene expression program (13, 14) that is regulated at the translational, post-translational, and transcriptional levels. Open reading frames (ORFs) 1a and 1b, which occupy the 5\u0408-proximal two-thirds of the genome, are translated directly from the genome to yield two large polyprotein (pp) precursors called pp1a and pp1ab. The latter is derived from extension of pp1a with the ORF1b-encoded sequence after a \u03ea1 ribosomal frameshift near the 3\u0408 end of ORF1a, which gives rise to a fixed ratio of pp1a over pp1ab synthesis (15-30% ribosomal frameshift efficiency reported; . The two replicase polyproteins are cleaved into a total of 16 functional proteins (see Fig. 1 ) called nonstructural protein 1 (nsp1) to nsp16. Viral RNA synthesis entails genome replication, which proceeds via a fulllength minus-strand RNA, and the synthesis of an extensive nested set of subgenomic mRNAs, each from their own subgenome-length minus-stranded template (13, 18 -20) . Subgenomic mRNAs are used to express structural and accessory proteins encoded in the 3\u0408-proximal third of the genome (see Fig. 1 ).",

In the eukaryotic cell, the cap is added co-transcriptionally in the nucleus by the sequential activity of four enzymes: (i) an RNA triphosphatase, (ii) a guanylyltransferase, (iii) an N7-methyltransferase (MTase), and (iv) a 2\u0408-O-MTase yielding a so-called cap-1 structure ( 7Me GpppN 2\u0408-O-Me ) (24, 28) . The biological importance of the latter structure is underlined by the fact that numerous viruses have evolved strategies to secure the presence of cap-1 at the 5\u0408 terminus of their mRNAs (for a review, see Ref. 29 ).",

            "text": "Positive-stranded RNA viruses, like SARS-CoV, replicate in the cytoplasm and are, therefore, presumed not to have access to the host cell capping machinery. Nevertheless, the 5\u0408 end of CoV mRNAs is thought to carry a type-1 cap (30 -32) , which is produced by the concerted action of several viral enzymes (33, 34) . As in many other positive-strand RNA viruses, an RNA triphosphatase activity is embedded in the RNA helicase carried by nsp13 and is likely to mediate the first step of viral cap synthesis (35) . The guanylyltransferase activity involved in CoV cap synthesis has remained elusive thus far. In contrast, two CoV methyltransferase activities were identified and assigned to the C-terminal domain of nsp14 ((N7-guanine)-methyltransferase) (33, 34) and nsp16 (2\u0408-O-MTase) (36) . We recently demonstrated that the in vitro activity of the SARS-CoV nsp16 2\u0408-O-MTase depends on an interaction with nsp10. The nsp10-nsp16 complex exhibits a potent MTase activity specifically converting cap-0 ( 7Me GpppN) into cap-1 structures (34) . Nsp10 is 148 residues long, contains two zinc fingers, and is overexpressed relative to nsp14 and nsp16 as it is encoded in ORF1a. Although its structure was solved almost 10 years ago ( Fig. 1 ), no enzymatic function was identified or proposed for the protein (37, 38) . Together with other replicase subunits, nsp10, nsp14, and nsp16 were implicated in the formation of the CoV replication-transcription complex (39) , a process that is likely based on a large repertoire of specific interactions of nsps with other nsps and with viral RNA sequences. The nsp10-nsp16 interaction was characterized biochemically and structurally to decipher the molecular basis of nsp10 function in activating the nsp16-mediated 2\u0408-O-MTase activity. Several key residues for the nsp10-nsp16 interaction were identified, and these findings were subsequently supported by the crystal structure of the complex (40, 41) . The recent observation that 2\u0408-O-methylation of the RNA cap may be mandatory to avoid or delay viral RNA recognition by innate immune sensors highlights the importance of the nsp10-nsp16 2\u0408-O-MTase complex in CoV-host interplay (42) (43) (44) .",

Subsequently, an (N7-guanine)-methyltransferase activity involved in viral mRNA capping was identified in the C-terminal domain of the same protein (33, 46) . The nsp14 (N7-guanine)-methyltransferase domain does not seem to be functionally separable from the ExoN domain (33, 47) . A predicted interaction between nsp10 and nsp14 (48, 49) was recently confirmed in vitro by Bouvet et al. (34, 47) in a study demonstrating a second regulatory role for SARS-CoV nsp10. Upon interacting with nsp10, the ExoN activity of nsp14 increased by \u03fe35-fold. Using diverse RNA substrates, the nsp10-nsp14 ExoN activity was shown to specifically degrade double-stranded (ds) RNAs with a preference for substrates carrying a single non-hybridized nucleotide at their 3\u0408 end. This study together with the 15-20-fold increased mutation rate observed for reverse engineered ExoN-deficient nsp14 mutants (50, 51) strongly suggested the involvement of ExoN in a unique RNA proofreading mechanism allowing CoVs to safeguard the integrity of their unusually large RNA genome. Interestingly, nsp10 does not show any effect on nsp14 (N7-guanine)-meth-yltransferase activity in vitro (34) . Considering the importance of the nsp10 protein in the regulation of viral enzymatic activities and replication-transcription complex assembly, it constitutes an attractive target for drug design programs.",

Using an extended mutagenesis approach and by coupling in cellulo bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) studies to in vitro functional assays, we identified a continuous and specific nsp10 surface involved in the interaction with nsp14. Key surface residues involved in this interaction were found to control SARS-CoV nsp14 ExoN activity and also appear to be part of the nsp10 domain that interacts with nsp16. Thus, nsp10 possesses overlapping interaction surfaces for the activation of two important viral enzymes. Reverse genetics experiments targeting key residues of this domain revealed that they are indeed critical for SARS-CoV replication, thus validating this surface as a potential target for antiviral drug development.",

To assess the overlap between these interaction surfaces, we first tested the impact of nsp10 mutations on the nsp10-nsp14 interaction using in cellulo BRET assays (for an overview of BRET strategy and set-up, see Ref. 58 ). Nsp10 mutants were fused to the C terminus of enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (EYFP), and nsp14 was fused to the C terminus of RLuc, all placed under the control of the cytomegalovirus promoter. BRET signal was measured in human HEK 293T cells at 48 h after plasmid transfection ( Fig. 2A) . As the expression level of EYFP-nsp10 mutants was quite variable, the amount of transfected plasmid DNA for each mutant was adjusted to achieve comparable protein expression levels (Fig.  2B ). The nsp10 mutations selected to be tested in BRET assays mainly targeted surface residues described in Lugari et al.

Interestingly, it has previously been shown that (part of) this same nsp10 surface is also involved in the interaction with nsp16 and that this surface is well conserved among coronaviruses (41) .",

Using the structure of the nsp10-nsp16 complex (PDB code 2XYQ (40)), we also mapped the nsp10 residues involved in the interaction with nsp16. For this purpose, we highlighted all nsp10 residues within a 5 \u00c5 radius of nsp16 (Fig. 5B) . The areas corresponding to the nsp14 and nsp16 binding surfaces were then marked on the same nsp10 structure model (Fig. 5C ). This figure distinctly highlights the fact that nsp10 interaction surfaces have a substantial overlap. The surface that interacts with nsp14 seems to be more extended than the one involved in the interaction with nsp16, as residue Phe-19, that is not involved in the nsp10-nsp16 interaction, plays a critical role in the nsp10-nsp14 interaction. In the nsp10 structure, as depicted in Fig. 5C , the nsp14 interaction surface covers most of the nsp16 interaction surface and extends toward the upper part of nsp10. Table 1 summarizes the data obtained for the nsp10-nsp14 interaction com-pared with the data from the previously described nsp10-nsp16 interaction analysis (41) .",

Nsp10 molecules may thus act as a platform that recruits nsp14 or nsp16 to the replication-transcription complex to either boost nsp14 ExoN activity or to switch on nsp16 2\u0408-O-MTase activity. Although the overlapping interaction surfaces suggest an exclusive interaction of nsp10 with either nsp14 or nsp16, the protein is produced at a much higher rate due to the fact that, unlike nsp14 and nsp16, it is encoded in ORF1a, just upstream of the ORF1a/1b ribosomal frameshift site (6, 19, 63) . Even though little is known about the relative turnover of CoV nsps in general and although nsp10 may have additional binding partners that remain to be identified, it is fair to assume that nsp10 levels in infected cells are substantially higher than those of nsp14 and nsp16, implying that the latter two proteins would not necessarily be competing to bind nsp10 (16) . Thus, nsp10-nsp14 and nsp10-nsp16 complexes may coexist, possibly as part of larger nsp assemblies engaged in different steps of viral RNA synthesis.",

The aromatic nature of Tyr-96 plays a crucial role in the nsp10-nsp16 interaction and in the activation of the nsp16 2\u0408-O-MTase activity (41) . This residue is specific for SARS-CoV nsp10 and is a phenylalanine in most other Coronavirus homologues (Fig. 7) . As the nsp10 Y96F mutation resulted in an enhanced binding to nsp16 correlating with an increased 2\u0408-O-MTase activity, residue Tyr-96 was hypothesized to fine-tune the strength of the interaction between nsp10 and nsp16 (41) . However, the underlying mechanism could not be clearly defined at the molecular level, not even using the structure of the nsp10-nsp16 complex (40) . In this study we show that Tyr-96 is involved in the interaction with nsp14 and that the nsp10 Y96F mutation interferes with nsp14 binding and decreases ExoN activity in vitro. This may explain why a tyrosine residue has been selected in the course of SARS-CoV evolution, whereas a phenylalanine has been preferred at this position in other CoVs to balance the relative affinities of nsp10 for nsp14 and nsp16. Nevertheless, in reverse genetics experiments the phenotype of the nsp10 Y96F mutant virus was found to be similar to that of the wild-type virus, indicating that the presence of a phenylalanine residue at this position does not strongly affect viral replication in the type of short term cell culture experiments included in this study.",

Clearly, the non-viable phenotype of these mutants cannot be explained by the loss of nsp14 ExoN activity alone, which raises important questions about the functionality of nsp10 or the nsp10-nsp14 complex in CoV replication. Nsp14 is a bifunctional enzyme, and its interaction with nsp10 may also influence its critical (N7-guanine)-methyltransferase activity, although no positive or negative influence of nsp10 on this activity was observed in in vitro assays (34) . Alternatively, nsp10 or the nsp10-nsp14 complex may have additional yet unknown functions that are vital for CoV replication. Previously, based on an MHV study, an indirect role for nsp10 in proteolytic processing of replicase polyproteins and viral RNA synthesis was proposed (64, 65) . It is conceivable that the nonviable phenotype of several SARS-CoV nsp10 mutants in the present study could be attributed to critically influencing one or more of these as yet poorly defined additional nsp10 functions.",

Each well was infected with the same amount of virus, after which cell layers were overlaid with a semi-solid medium containing the indicated increasing concentrations of 5FU. Cell layers were incubated for 3 days, fixed, and stained to reveal plaque formation. Like the wild-type virus, nsp10 mutants K43A and Y96F were insensitive to 5FU up to a dose of 250 M. On the other hand, plaque size and number for mutant nsp14-D90A/E92A (the ExoN knock-out mutant known to exhibit a mutator phenotype) were strongly reduced even at the lowest 5FU concentration tested. SEPTEMBER 12, 2014 \u2022 VOLUME 289 \u2022 NUMBER 37 et al. (64) for MHV nsp10. This core does not appear to tolerate mutations (64) , and the non-viable phenotype of some of the MHV mutants tested by Donaldson et al. (64) again seems to reflect the importance of the nsp10-nsp14 interaction surface in coronaviruses. For instance, conserved residues Gly-69, Gly-70, and Ser-72 were targeted for MHV and were all found to be critical for virus replication, in line with the data from the in vitro interaction studies presented here for SARS-CoV nsp10. Still, the non-viable phenotypes could also be explained by alternative scenarios, like the nsp10 surface being involved in another function that is critical for coronaviruses replication. The available data lead us to propose that specific \"hot spot\" residues (Phe-19, Met-44, Gly-69, Ser-72, His-80, and Tyr-96) within and around the nsp10 core can be targeted to disrupt nsp10-nsp14 interactions and inhibit nsp14 ExoN activity and/or other nsp10 functions, potentially interfering with CoV replication. Strikingly, those residues are highly conserved across coronaviruses, including the recently emerged and potentially life-threatening MERS-CoV (Fig. 8) . Considering its importance for virus replication, highlighted by this and other studies, nsp10 represents an attractive target for anti-Coronavirus drug discovery. Specific molecules or peptides targeting the described nsp10 surface and inhibiting the interaction with nsp14 and nsp16 could be developed to reduce or prevent Coronavirus replication (66) . Because nsp10 is well conserved among coronaviruses, such compounds could then be used for treatment or in a prophylactic approach to prevent MERS-CoV infection, possible outbursts of SARS-CoV, or any other newly emerging lethal Coronavirus.",
