The national herd numbers over 2.5 million cattle while the human population is eight million (FAO-WHO-OIE, 1988) . About SO% of Zambia's cattle are in the traditional sector and the development potential of this sector is considerable. However, the offtake from traditionally managed herds is less than lo%, considerably lower than that from commercial farms (Perry et al., 1984) .",

            "text": "In neighbouring countries, several viral diseases have been reported as causing loss of production in local herds, including bovine viral diarrhoea-mucosal disease (BVD-MD), parainfluenza 3 (P13) and infectious bovine rhinotracheitis-infectious pustular vulvovaginitis (IBR-IPV) (Provost et al., 1%7a,b; Taylor and Rampton, 1968; Jetteur et aI., 1988; Eyanga et al., 1989) . Furthermore, cattle can act as hosts for viruses which are pathogens for other domestic species, such as Bluetongue (BT) (Erasmus, 1975) . No information on such diseases in livestock is available from Zambia. Over 70% of the Zambian population is involved in agricultural activities, including animal husbandry (FAO, 1988) . Several zoonoses can be transmitted to personnel working in cattle production. Brucellosis, Rift Valley fever (RFV), Q fever and to a lesser extent bovine chlamydiosis, are of economic importance because they can also affect herd productivity through abortions, stillbirths and reduction in fertility and milk production. RVF may be responsible for severe signs often resulting in death. Human cases have generally followed outbreaks in livestock (Meegan, 1979) . In Zambia, epidemics of this infection in cattle were reported in Central and Southern Provinces during 1974 , 1978 and 1985 and seem to have been associated with human deaths (Hussein et al., 1987; Morita, 1988) . Serological studies on RVF in cattle gave conflicting results. While Hussein and colleagues (1987) reported over 50% of sera collected in Southern Province to be positive for RVF, Morita (1988) did not find any reactors in animals sampled from Mazabuka, although 11.4% of the tested resident human population had antibodies against the virus.",

These preliminary results could be used to calculate the required sample sizes. Taylor and Robinson (1968) found sero-prevalences of BVD-MD in native Kenyan cattle varying from 0% in Nyanza and Western Provinces to a maximum rate of 50% in Eastern Province. In the same survey, the highest percentage of positives in Uganda was 21.5. A lower occurrence of BVD-MD has been observed in Zaire (O-2%), where 44% of the sampled animals also presented antibodies to BAV3 and 27% to PI3 (Jetteur et al., 1988; Eyanga et al., 1989) . In both studies, BVD-MD prevalences rose sharply to 41% in ranches and to 77% in regions where the average herd size was above 500 head. In Central Africa, where large herds are also found, the prevalences recorded among local zebus were 75% for BVD-MD and 96.7% for PI3 (Provost el al., 1%7a, b) . These are similar to the values normally observed on European or North American intensive farms, associated with high concentrations of animals (Bruner and Gillespie, 1973) . Over 50 cattle per square km are found in the flood plains of the Kafue river at the peak of the dry season, when forage is only available there. Communal grazing at such high concentrations may explain the consistently high prevalences recorded in this study. Moreover, brucellosis can easily spread between and within herds since the peak of calvings occurs at that time, from August to October, and the animals are night-kraaled together. The abundant wild ruminants, which share the same pasture, could also contribute to infection transmission (Provost et al., 1%7a,b; Hamblin and Hedger, 1979) . PI3 and IBR-IPV antibodies have been found in wild mammals in Zambia (Krauss el al., 1984) .",

Two years later, according to the results of this study, the virus seems to be still circulating among the traditional herds in Southern Province. This suggestion is supported by the titres recorded in calves. Transmission is likely to occur through the mosquitoes which are abundant in the flood plains of the Kafue river. The prevalence we observed in cattle was similar to that recorded by Morita (1988) in the previous year among Mazabuka residents, one of the districts included in our investigation. However, Morita failed to detect reactors among the cattle he tested, possibly because of the antigen he used. Q fever can be transmitted to domestic animals either by inhalation or by infected ticks, and different species of wild lagomorphs can act as hosts for the agent (Acha and Szyfres, 1988) . The epidemiology of the disease in tropical livestock has not been fully investigated. However, in contrast to the situation in temperate areas, studies carried out so far in Africa emphasize tick-borne transmission rather than lateral spread among domestic animals (Schutte et al., 1976; Chartier and Chartier, 1988) . The abundant wild ruminants of the Kafue flats present antibodies for C. bunt& and Chlamydiapsiffaci (Krauss ef al., 1984) . Local herds are intensively treated to control ticks. This may be one of the factors resulting in the low proportion of cattle which presented antibodies against C. burned.",

Although the antibodies detected will have been the result of natural infection, their presence in single unpaired samples is not necessarily a sign of past or intercurrent viral disease. However, observed titres were high. Longitudinal investigations could quantify the impact of the different infections on the reproductive performance in these herds, aiming to define control measures. In such studies the different levels of validity of the tests used, probably associated with the health and nutritional status of the herd, should be borne in mind. BVD-MD virus is an immunosuppressive agent, and it may therefore be responsible for the outbreaks of cutaneous streptothricosis (or Senkobo as it is known in Zambia), a common disease in local herds (Stober, 1982) . The unusual severe cases of babesiosis in calves recently observed in some commercial farms in the Central and Southern Provinces might also be associated with such immunosuppressive activity.",
