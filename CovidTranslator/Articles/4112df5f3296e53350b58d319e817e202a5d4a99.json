            "text": "One recently recognized mechanism underlying the IFITMmediated inhibition of viral infection is inhibition of viral entry, particularly the Env-mediated virus fusion with target cell membranes (Diamond and Farzan, 2013; Perreira et al., 2013; Smith et al., 2014) . We reported that IFITMs inhibit cell-cell fusion mediated by all three classes of viral fusion proteins, acting at the level of hemifusion initiation (Li et al., 2013) . Additional studies revealed that IFITM proteins decrease membrane fluidity, possibly by adopting intramembrane topology and changing curvature (Li et al., 2013; Lin et al., 2013; Yount et al., 2012) . Recent results using single-viral-particle fusion assays suggest that IFITMs can also inhibit formation of fusion pores in endosomes (Desai et al., 2014) . The potent inhibitory effect of IFITMs on viral fusion has been linked to their localization to both endolysosomal compartments and plasma membrane, which is determined by posttranslational modification and sorting signals (Chesarino et al., 2014; Huang et al., 2011; Jia et al., 2012 Jia et al., , 2014 . Interestingly, IFITMs have been recently shown to enhance infection of some viruses, such as human coronavirus HCoV-OC43 (Zhao et al., 2014) . IFITM3 is known to interact with vesicle-membrane-protein-associated protein A (VAPA) and disrupt intracellular cholesterol homeostasis (Amini-Bavil-Olyaee et al., 2013) , but the exact role of cholesterol in IFITM-mediated inhibition of the viral membrane remains elusive.",

Subsequent studies showed that overexpression of IFITMs can indeed inhibit HIV-1 replication in MT-4 cells (Schoggins et al., 2011) and that IFITMs also modestly reduce expression of some HIV-1 genes, including Gag (Chutiwitoonchai et al., 2013; Ding et al., 2014; Lu et al., 2011) . Furthermore, we recently observed that HIV-1 mutations in env and vpu genes can promote escape from IFITM1 restriction, and that these mutations appear to correlate with enhanced cell-to-cell transmission capability of these escape mutants . Most recently, Compton, Tartour, and colleagues demonstrated that IFITMs are incorporated into HIV-1 virions, leading to impaired viral fusion, infectivity, and spread (Compton et al., 2014; Tartour et al., 2014) . However, the exact mechanism underlying the IFITM impairment of HIV-1 infection remains unknown.",

In contrast to the study of Compton and Tatour et al. (Compton et al., 2014; Tartour et al., 2014) , we find that IFITM incorporation into HIV-1 particles does not strictly correlate with the ability of IFITMs to inhibit cell-to-cell infection. We confirm our previous finding that prolonged passage of HIV-1 results in the emergence of Env mutations that overcome the IFITM-mediated restriction of cell-to-cell infection, resulting in enhanced viral replication. Overall, our work supports a model by which IFITMs specifically disrupt the function of HIV-1 Env so as to restrict HIV-1. Results from this study clarify the molecular mechanisms of IFITM restriction and provide insight into the specialized role of IFITMs in HIV-1 replication, with possible consequences for HIV-1 transmission and AIDS pathogenesis.",

Notably, most previous studies are based on cellfree HIV-1 infection, in which IFITMs are expressed in target cells. Here, we exploit a highly sensitive intron-Gaussia luciferase (inGLuc) system developed by David Derse and colleagues (Mazurov et al., 2010) to assess the effect of IFITM expression in donor cells on HIV-1 single-round cell-to-cell transfer. In this system, the Gluc gene can only be expressed upon HIV-1 vector infection of target cells. We first established Jurkat cell lines stably expressing IFITM1, IFITM2, or IFITM3 using Jurkat/inGLuc (a kind gift of Walther Mothes) previously engineered to express inGLuc HIV-1 vector (Agosto et al., 2014) , and we infected these cells with wild-type (WT) HIV-1 NL43 bearing VSV-G so that the majority of donor cells would be HIV-1 infected. We then cocultured these cells with parental Jurkat cells and measured GLuc activity 24-48 hr after coculture.",

In contrast, IFITM expression in target Jurkat cells showed very modest effects, i.e., 5%-40% inhibition, on HIV-1 cell-to-cell transmission ( Figure 1A ). Similar trends were also observed when 293T cells served as donor cells and Jurkat as target cells, although the inhibitory effect of IFITM1 in donor 293T cells was less compared to that in donor Jurkat/inGLuc cells ( Figure 1B) , possibly due to the expression of endogenous IFITMs in Jurkat cells (Lu et al., 2011) . We also measured the infectivity of HIV-1 virions produced from 293T cells in HeLa-TZM and observed that IFITM2 and IFITM3 significantly diminished the viral infectivity ( Figure 1C ). The relatively low inhibitory effect of IFITM1 on HIV-1 cell-to-cell infection was not due to different levels of IFITM expression in 293T or Jurkat cells, as determined by western blotting ( Figure 1D ). We treated the cocultured 293T-Jurkat cells with AMD3100 (a CXCR4 inhibitor), latrunculin B (LAT-B, an actin polymerization inhibitor), or VRC01 (a broadly neutralizing antibody against the CD4 binding site of Env), and we observed that each of these inhibitors markedly reduced cell-to-cell HIV-1 infection ( Figure 1E ), showing that HIV-1 transmission from 293T to Jurkat cells is CXCR4 coreceptor and HIV-1 Env dependent and requires a dynamic actin cytoskeleton.",

The expression level of IFITMs in these PM1 cells was substantially reduced by the shRNA, either in the presence or absence of interferon treatment (IFNa2b, 500 U), although cross-knockdown of different human IFITMs was observed ( Figure 2A ). These cell lines were infected with HIV-1 NL43 -iGFP bearing VSV-G for 12 hr, resulting in 97% Gag-iGFP-positive PM1 cells, which served as donor cells ( Figure S2A ).

Notably, the enhancement became apparent at 8 hr in PM1 cells expressing shRNA against IFITM2 (23.8%) and IFITM3 (32.8%) relative to the scrambled shRNA control (13.8%) ( Figure 2B ). Azidothymidine (AZT) treatment of cocultured cells at 8 hr did decrease HIV-1 transmission in IFITM-knockdown PM1 cells compared to untreated cells ( Figure 2B ), suggesting that knockdown of IFITMs can enhance productive HIV-1 infection following cell-to-cell infection (i.e., newly synthesized Gag-iGFP). The cell-free HIV-1 NL43 infection of the mixed PM-1/ Jurkat cell population (without spinoculation) was low (1.6%), regardless of shRNA IFITM expression. We subsequently confirmed the effects of IFITMs knockdown, especially IFITM3, in primary peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), which served as donor cells for HIV-1 cell-to-cell infection . We cannot exclude the possibility that the smaller effect of IFITM1 and 2 knockdown on viral transmission could be due to their relatively low knockdown efficiency in PBMCs. Nonetheless, these results demonstrate that knockdown of endogenous IFITM expression enhances HIV-1 transmission in CD4 + T cells.

As the first step to test this possibility, we performed western blotting to examine HIV-1 Env expression and processing in 293T cells transiently transfected with HIV-1 NL43 in the presence or absence of IFITMs. We found that the ratio of gp120 or gp41 to gp160 in IFITM-expressing cells, especially that of IFITM2 and IFITM3, was considerably decreased compared to that observed in cells transfected with the pQCXIP vector control ( Figures 3A and 3C ). These results suggest that HIV-1 Env processing is impaired by IFITMs. We then carried out immunoprecipitation (IP) of the cell lysates (containing 1% NP-40 and 0.1% SDS) with anti-FLAG and observed that IFITM proteins, especially those expressing IFITM2 and IFITM3, readily pulled down HIV-1 Env, especially gp41 ( Figure 3B , top and middle panels). IFITM1 was also found to interact with HIV-1 Env, but with much reduced efficiency ( Figure 3B ). Importantly, we did not detect HIV-1 Gag in immunoprecipitated cell lysates (data not shown), implying that the observed interaction is HIV-1 Env specific. The interaction between endogenous IFITM proteins and HIV-1 Env was also observed in PM1 cells ( Figure 3D ), although knockdown of individual IFITMs in PM1 cells only modestly increased HIV-1 Env processing ( Figures  S2B-S2D) . Overall, these results demonstrated that IFITM proteins, especially IFITM2 and IFITM3, specifically interact with HIV-1 Env in viral producer cells, resulting in impaired Env processing.",

            "text": "IFITM incorporation into HIV-1 virions has been recently reported to be responsible for impaired viral infectivity (Compton et al., 2014; Tartour et al., 2014) . Hence, we compared the incorporation efficiencies of IFITM1, IFITM2, and IFITM3 into HIV-1 virions and examined their possible correlations between incorporation efficiency and inhibitions of cell-to-cell infection. Surprisingly, we found that all three IFITMs were abundantly present in culture media, likely as exosomes, even in cells not expressing HIV-1 ( Figure 3E , right three lanes). To deter-mine if IFITMs are specifically incorporated into HIV-1 virions, we adopted an approach that we recently used to evaluate TIM-family protein incorporation (Li et al., 2014) . We first immunoprecipitated purified HIV-1 virions using HIV-1 immunoglobulin (HIV-Ig, pooled HIV patient sera), and we then performed western blotting using anti-FLAG to detect IFITMs. We observed that all IFITMs were detected in the pulled down HIV-1 virions, consistent with reports of Compton and Tartout et al. (Compton et al., 2014; Tartour et al., 2014) . However, IFITM1 was more abundantly incorporated into HIV-1 virions compared to IFITM2 and 3 ( Figure 3F , top panel), which is not in accordance with their inhibition of cell-to-cell infection and diminished infectivity ( Figure 1 ); this was despite the equivalent input of IFITMs ( Figure 3G ), as well as almost equivalent virion pull-down efficiency by HIV-Ig ( Figure 3F , bottom panel). Notably, the signals of gp120 in the purified virions, either (A) Examination of IFITM protein expression in PM1 cells stably expressing shRNA IFITM1, 2, and 3. Cells were treated with or without 500 U IFNa2b for 18-24 hr, and lysates were subjected to western blotting using anti-IFITM1, anti-IFITM2, or anti-IFITM3 antibodies. Cross-knockdown and antibody cross-reactions among IFITM1, 2, and 3 are noticed. GAPDH serves as loading control due to weak signals for b-actin in PM-1 cells. (B) Summary of flow cytometric analysis of HIV-1 Gag-GFP transfer from PM1 to Jurkat cells. PM-1 cells stably expressing shRNA IFITM1, 2, or 3 or scramble control were infected with NL43-Gag-iGFP; cells were cocutured for 4-8 hr with Jurkat cells that were prelabeled with CMTMR. Cells were gated for GFP (Green) and CMTMR (Red) by flow cytometry (see Figure S2 ). For 8 hr coculture, cells were also treated with AZT to ensure that productive HIV-1 replication had occurred. Data were from four independent experiments. All values shown are normalized against shRNA control either at 4 or 8 hr after coculture, *p < 0.05; **p < 0.01. (C-E) Knockdown of IFITM expression in PBMCs enhances HIV-1 cell-to-cell infection. Activated PBMCs were treated with 500 U IFNa2b and infected with VSV-G lentiviral pseudotypes encoding shRNA IFITM1, 2, or 3 for 48 hr. The knockdown efficiency was examined by intracellular staining using pooled antibodies against IFITM1, 2, and 3 (1:1:1) by flow cytometry shown in (C). Note that shRNA against IFITM1 knocks down both IFITM1 and IFITM3, shRNA against IFITM2 only knocks down IFITM2, and shRNA against IFITM3 knocks down all three IFITMs. Next, the cells were infected with HIV-1 NL43 -iGFP bearing VSV-G, which served as donor cells, and cocultured with target Jurkat cells stably expressing tdTomato (Jurkat/tdTomato). The cell-to-cell infection efficiency was determined by measuring GFP + Jurkat cells 48 hr after coculture using flow cytometry (D) and summarized in (E). *p < 0.05. Results are from four independent experiments performed in duplicates. See also Figure S2 . before (referred to as ''virion input'') or after immunoprecipitation with HIV-Ig (referred to as ''IP: HIV-Ig''), were substantially reduced by IFITM expression, especially IFITM2 and 3 ( Figures  3F and 3G) , consistent with the lower levels of gp120 in the cells. We also observed that gp160 in IFITM2 and IFITM3-containing HIV-1 virion input was significantly increased ( Figure 3G , middle panel), which likely represents immature Env in microvesicles and/or exosomes, whose release might be promoted by IFITM2 and 3. Together, our data support the conclusion that IFITMs are abundantly present in the media of normally cultured cells, even without HIV-1, which is consistent with a recent study (Zhu et al., 2015) , and that IFITM incorporation into HIV-1 virions, although detected, does not strictly correlate with the phenotype of IFITM inhibition of HIV-1 cell-to-cell infection.",

Our previous work has already demonstrated that IFITM3 does not significantly inhibit HIV-1 production (Lu et al., 2011) . We performed pulse-chase labeling experiments using 293T cells transiently transfected with HIV-1 NL43 , in the presence or absence of IFITM3, and then measured gp120 shedding into culture media by immunoprecipitation using HIV-Ig. While the expression of gp160 decreased in a time-dependent manner, as would be expected, the level of gp160 in IFITM3-expressing cells suffered a more rapid decrease compared to cells expressing HIV-1 NL43 alone ( Figures 4A and 4B ). In contrast, HIV-1 Gag (Pr55) expression in both cell groups exhibited similar rates of decline, regardless of IFITM3 expression or not ( Figures 4A and 4C) . Notably, we consistently observed an enhanced SU shedding in IFITM3-expressing cells compared to cells expressing HIV-1 NL43 alone, especially at 2, 4, and 6 hr of the chase labeling time ( Figures  4A and 4D) . Overall, the pulse-chase labeling data indicate that IFITM expression in viral producer cells likely increases gp160 turnover and promotes gp120 shedding into culture media.",

We therefore examined several IFITM1/IFITM2 chimeras that we had previously generated; they differ primarily at the N and C termini . Chimeric IFITM1112 and IFITM1222 contain the N terminus of IFITM1 and the C terminus of IFITM2, whereas chimeric IFITM2221 and IFITM2111 contain the N terminus of IFITM2 and the C terminus of IFITM1 . We found that IFITM1112 and IFITM1222 strongly inhibited HIV-1 cell-to-cell infection, with efficiency similar to, or even higher than, that of IFITM2 ( Figure 5A ). In contrast, chimeras IFITM2221 and IFITM2111 showed modest inhibitions of HIV-1 cell-to-cell infection, almost identical to the phenotype of IFITM1 ( Figure 5A ). These data suggest that the C terminus of IFITM1 intrinsically suppresses inhibition of HIV-1 transmission from 293T to Jurkat cells. The negative impact of the C terminus of IFITM1 on inhibition of HIV-1 cell-to-cell transmission was further supported by the phenotypes of three IFITM1 truncation mutants , i.e., D(108-125), D(112-125), and D(117-125), all of which exhibited enhanced inhibition of HIV-1 cell-to-cell transmission compared to WT IFITM1 ( Figure 5A ). The differential effects of IFITM chimeras as well as IFITM1 deletion mutants on HIV-1 cell-to-cell transmission seemed to correlate with their capability to associate with HIV-1 Env. For example, chimeric IFITM1112 and 1222 exhibited increased associations with HIV-1 Env relative to IFITM1 WT ( Figure S3 ). The increased interaction was also observed for three IFITM1 C-terminal deletion mutants, e.g., D(117-125), despite their apparent downregulation of HIV-1 Env ( Figure S3 ). Collectively, these results suggest that the C terminus of IFITM1 intrinsically suppresses association with HIV-1 Env, and this likely contributes to and explains, at least in part, its less potent ability to block cell-to-cell transmission.",

In particular, we compared the cell-cell fusion efficiency of HIV-1 Env when IFITM proteins are expressed at similar levels in effector 293T cells, the target HeLa-TZM cells (stably expressing IFITMs by retroviral transduction), and both. Consistent with previously published data (Compton et al., 2014) , expression of IFITMs, especially IFITM2 and IFITM3, in effector cells, but to a much lesser extent in target cells, inhibited cell-cell fusion induced by HIV-1 NL43 Env protein ( Figure 5D ). Extending these results, and in agreement with the cell-to-cell infection ( Figure 5A ) and virion-cell fusion data ( Figure 5C ), chimeric IFITM1112 and IFITM1222, but not IFITM2221 and IFITM2111, potently inhibited HIV-1 NL43 Envmediated cell-cell fusion ( Figure 5E ). In stark contrast to the strong inhibitory effect of IFITM expression in effector cells on HIV-1 Env, we found that cell-cell fusion mediated by influenza A virus (IAV) HA was equivalently inhibited by IFITM expression in effector cells and target cells ( Figure 5F ), similar to our previous results obtained with Jaagsiekte sheep retrovirus (JSRV) Env (Li et al., 2013) . Altogether, these results strengthen the notion that IFITMs specifically antagonize the HIV-1 Env protein to inhibit viral cell-to-cell infection, and that this mechanism is distinct from the IFITM inhibition of IAV hemagglutinin (HA) and JSRV Env (Li et al., 2013) . were cocultured with parental HeLa-TZM or HeLa-TZM stably expressing IFITMs (target cells) for 12-24 hr.

Next, we sought to extend these results to the IFITM constructs under analysis here. Given the apparently enhanced ability of IFITM1D(117-125) to inhibit HIV-1 NL43 cell-to-cell infection compared to parental IFITM1, we performed long-term replication assays and observed that, indeed, IFITM1D(117-125) and IFITM1D(108-125) mutants profoundly inhibited HIV-1 NL43 replication compared to WT IFITM1 ( Figure 6A ). We then carried out virus evolution experiments to interrogate if HIV-1 can escape from the inhibition of IFITM1D(117-125) following a series of prolonged passages. After 3 weeks of culturing HIV-1 NL43 in IFITM1D(117-125)-expressing SupT1 cells, we observed pronounced cytopathic effects accompanied by increased viral RT activity in the culture supernatants, implying the possible emergence of HIV-1 escape mutants. We recovered the viral DNA from infected cells and identified two mutations: a stop codon at the 40th amino acid position in Vpu (Vpu40), which caused Vpu truncation, and an alanine-to-valine change at residue 539 in Env (EnvA539V). While the Vpu40 or EnvA539V alone marginally increased the replication of HIV-1 NL4-3 in IFITM1D(117-125)-expressing SupT1 cells (Figure 6B ), the double mutant Vpu40/EnvA539V allowed virus replication to peak at day 12 in D(117-125)-expressing SupT1 cells compared to the replication peak at day 8 in control SupT1 cells, which suggests a partial restoration of virus replication ( Figure 6B ). Consistent with this result, the Vpu40 mutant did not appear to exhibit any difference from WT HIV-1 in sensitivity of IFITM inhibition of cellto-cell infection; however, EnvA539V, as well as the double mutant containing both Vpu40 and EnvA539V, substantially, though not completely, overcame the inhibition by IFITMs (Figure 6C) . These results demonstrated that HIV-1 can acquire escape mutations that evade IFITM restriction, further supporting the notion that IFITMs antagonize HIV-1 Env to inhibit viral cell-tocell infection, although these mutants may not be IFITM-specific (see below).",

Interestingly, we found that IFITMs did not inhibit Jurkat-to-Jurkat and 293to-Jurkat transfer of NL43 EnvCTdel-144 as potently as they did the WT, despite the reduced infectivity of this mutant relative to that of HIV-1 NL43 WT ( Figures 6D and 6E ) (Murakami and Freed, 2000) . We next analyzed cell-cell fusion by transfecting 293T cells with an Env-expression construct derived from NL43 EnvCTdel-144 and using HeLa-TZM as target cells, again with a similar trend of inhibition obtained ( Figure 6F ). Note that the cell-cell fusion activity of NL43 EnvCTdel-144 is relatively higher than the WT in the absence of IFITM ( Figure 6F ), consistent with numerous previously published reports. Altogether, these results showed that deletion of the cytoplasmic tail of HIV-1 Env can overcome the restriction of IFITMs on cell-tocell infection and cell-cell fusion.",

We found that the processing of Env A539V mutant was still inhibited by IFITM3, as evidenced by increased gp160 and decreased gp120 and gp41 in the cell lysates, and that A539V also interacted with IFITM3 as efficiently as did the WT Env ( Figure S4A , top two panels). These suggest that A539V mutant likely arose by gaining replication fitness. Notably, we found that CTdel-144 Env had substantially lost its capability to associate with IFITM3 ( Figure S4A, bottom panels) . Furthermore, we observed a comparable gp41/g160 ratio for CTdel-144 in cells expressing or not expressing IFITM3 ( Figure S4A ) as well as comparable gp120 levels in virions produced by the NL4-3/CTdel-144 mutant ( Figure S4B ). These results demonstrate that IFITM3 has a smaller effect on the CTdel-114 mutant as compared to the HIV-1 NL43 WT. Altogether, these data suggest that the CT of HIV-1 Env is critical for Env association with IFITM3 and that the A539V Env escape mutant is more fit than WT and is thus able to non-specifically overcome IFITM restriction.",

We thus transfected 293T cells with molecular clones of HIV-2 Rod-1 , SIVagm, SIVmac, or SIVcpz, and cocultured the transfected 293T cells with HeLa-TZM; the cell-to-cell infection/fusion and cell-free viral infection of these viruses were measured in parallel as described above. The cell-to-cell infection/fusion mediated by SIVcpz and SIVagm were greatly inhibited by IFITMs, especially IFITM2 and 3; however, the cell-to-cell infection/fusion of SIVmac was unaffected, despite similar infection efficiencies in mock cells transfected with an empty pQCXIP vector ( Figures 7C and S5C) . Notably, the cell-free infection of SIVagm was profoundly inhibited by all three IFITMs (>20-fold) compared to SIVcpz, SIVmac, and HIV-2, which were modestly inhibited by the three human IFITMs ( Figures 7D and S5D ). Similar to HIV-1, the cell-to-cell infection/ fusion of HIV-2 and SIVs are more efficient than cell-free infection ( Figure S5F ). However, we cannot rule out the possibility that the differences between cell-to-cell and cell-free infection for SIVcpz and HIV-2 were due to their extremely low cell-free infection in HeLa-TZM cells. Altogether, these results demonstrated that while cell-to-cell infection/fusion of CCR5-using HIV-1 YU2 and AD8, as well as HIV-2 and SIVs, are inhibited by human IFITMs, the extents of inhibition differ depending on the specific IFITMs and the viruses tested.",

Here, we provide evidence that IFITM proteins inhibit HIV-1 cell-to-cell infection by antagonizing Env, thus clarifying the mechanism by which IFITMs restrict HIV and possibly other viruses. During the preparation of our manuscript, a paper by Compton et al. was published showing that IFITMs are incorporated into HIV-1 virions thus impairing the viral spread through cell contact; however, the exact underlying mechanism was not determined (Compton et al., 2014) . While the incorporation of IFITMs into HIV-1 virions was confirmed in our work, we did not observe a strict correlation between levels of IFITM incorporation and inhibition of cell-to-cell infection. For example, despite its high levels in HIV-1 particles, IFITM1 in general displayed the lowest inhibitory activity among the three human IFITMs. Significantly, we discovered that IFITM proteins interact with HIV-1 Env in viral producer cells, impair Env processing, and promote SU shedding that altogether reduce virion fusion activity. While we find that IFITMs also inhibit the cell-to-cell infection/fusion of HIV-2 and SIVs, the extents of inhibition are both IFITM-and virus-species dependent. We were able to confirm and extend our previous finding that HIV-1 can adapt to overcome the IFITM restriction by mutating its env gene during prolonged replication. Hence, results from our study offer insights into understanding the mechanisms of IFITM restriction of viral infection as well as HIV-host co-evolution.",

One obvious possibility is that IFITM proteins somehow modulate HIV-1 gene expression and/or their functions in viral producer cells, resulting in reduced viral output and/or defective virions. Alternatively, IFITMs may modulate the expression of HIV-1 receptor, coreceptors, and/or even cellular adhesion molecules, such as ICAM-1 or LFA-1, all of which are known to be important for formation of the virological synapse (VS) and therefore cell-to-cell infection. However, our flow cytometric analyses did not show significant changes in CD4, CXCR4, CD63, CD81, ICAM-1, or LFA-1 on the cell surface upon IFITM overexpression ( Figure S6) . Additionally, at the early stage of cell-to-cell infection (e.g., 4 hr), HIV-1 Gag-iGFP or iCherry can be transferred from donor to target cells with similar efficiency between mock and IFITM-expressing cells ( Figures S7A and S7B) , further arguing against an IFITM-mediated block in VS formation. By using an Amnis flow cytometric imaging system (Swartz et al., 2014) , we also observed comparable stable associations between donor Jurkat expressing or not expressing IFITMs with target PBMCs (Figure S7C ), again suggesting that the formation of the VS is not affected by IFITMs.",

This mechanism of action is apparently distinct from that observed in the context of IAV, JSRV, and possibly other viruses in cell-free viral infections . Previously, we and others have shown that IFITM proteins inhibit cell-cell fusion induced by a variety of viral fusion proteins on the plasma membrane and that IFITMs can also block the virus-cell fusion in endosomes (Desai et al., 2014; Li et al., 2013) . We demonstrated that expression of IFITMs in effector cells is as potent as their expression in target cells in inhibiting Jaagsiekte sheep retrovirus (JSRV) Env-mediated cell-cell fusion (Li et al., 2013 ). In the current study, we extended this finding by showing that cell-cell fusion induced by IAV HA is also equivalently inhibited by IFITM expression in effector and target cells. These results are in striking contrast to what we have found for HIV-1, where IFITMs must be present in effector or donor cells in order to efficiently inhibit HIV-1 Env-mediated cell-cell fusion and cell-to-cell infection. In addition to the impaired processing of HIV-1 Env, we also find that IFITM3 promotes HIV-1 SU shedding into culture media. This observation, together with our data showing that IFITM proteins specifically interact with HIV-1 Env gp41, suggests that IFITM proteins, especially IFITM2 and 3, may alter the conformation of HIV-1 Env and likely result in premature triggering and impaired infectivity. The increased rate of gp160 turnover observed here also suggests that IFITM-bound gp160 may be targeted for degradation. Work is ongoing to determine the detailed interactions between IFITMs and HIV-1 Env as well as possible conformational changes in Env.",

Interestingly, both HIV-1 BH10 and HIV-1 NL43 acquired mutations in Vpu that caused the production of a truncated Vpu of 33-39 amino acids. However, the escape mutations in Env differ considerably between these two viruses. HIV-1 BH10 has the G367E mutation that attenuates the binding of Env to receptor CD4 and therefore profoundly diminishes the infectivity of HIV-1 BH10 . In the case of HIV-1 NL43 , the A539 residue within heptad repeat 1 (HR1) of gp41 was changed to a valine. However, preliminary data show that the A539V Env mutant still interacts with IFITM proteins ( Figure S4A ), indicating that additional mechanisms are involved. While the escape mutants we discovered may not be specific for IFITMs, these data support an active role of Env in overcoming host restrictions of HIV-1 infection.",

By examining the chimeras between IFITM1 and IFITM2, we discovered that the C terminus of IFITM1 inherently suppresses the inhibition of HIV-1 cellto-cell infection while the N terminus does not play a major role. Further deletion mutants revealed that the C-terminal nine amino acids of IFITM1 are sufficient to confer this effect. While it remains to be determined how exactly these nine residues determine the differential effects of IFITMs on HIV-1 cell-to-cell infection, it is possible that deletion of the last nine amino acids may change the conformation or the topology of IFITM1, rendering it capable of interacting with HIV-1 Env as does IFITM3. It is also possible that the predominant localization of IFITM1 is different from that of IFITM2 and IFITM3 in the cell, and this may be determined, in part, by the C terminus of IFITM1, which could interact with other cellular factors involved in HIV-1 cell-to-cell transmission (Puryear et al., 2013; Roy et al., 2014; Wen et al., 2014) . Future experiments will address these possibilities.",

For Jurkat cell to other T cell transmission, we use an HIV-1 NL43 -intron Gaussia-based system, which was originally described by Derse and colleagues (Mazurov et al., 2010) . This assay takes advantage that an intron, which was inserted into an HIV-1 vector in an opposite orientation to the Luc open reading frame, can be removed upon lentiviral vector transduction of target cells; the Gluc gene is not expressed in transfected or infected donor cells. Briefly, we infected Jurkat/inGLuc cells expressing or not expressing IFITMs, or PM1 cells stably expressing shRNA IFITMs or scramble RNA, with VSV-G pseudotyped HIV-1 NL43 . The VSV-G pseudotyped HIV-1 was used because it can efficiently infect donor cells (almost 100%) and therefore enhance our capability of detecting cell-to-cell infection. Target cells include Jurkat, HeLa-TZM, and PBMCs; 24-48 hr after coculture or infection, GLuc activity was measured for cell-tocell infection and cell-free HIV-1 infection. In all cases, no effect of IFITM expression on cell viability or proliferation capacity of the donor cells was found. Detailed information is provided in the Supplemental Experimental Procedures.",

(B-D) Quantifications of the phosphorimaging intensity of HIV-1 gp160 (B), Gag Pr55 (C), and shed gp120 (D). Note that in (B) and (C), we set the signals of HIV-1 gp160 or Gag Pr55 in the absence and presence of IFITM3 to 1.0, respectively. In (D), we set the signal of gp120 in the absence of IFITM3 at 6 as 1.0 for comparison.",

Experiments were performed as described in the legend of Figures 1A-1C, except HIV-1 NL43 mutants Vpu40, EnvA539V, and Vpu40/EnvA539V bearing VSV-G were used for infection of Jurkat/inGLuc cells, which served as donors.

For HIV-1 (A) and (B), the produced viruses were used to infect Jurkat/ inGLuc cells overnight, and after thorough washing with PBS, the infected Jurkat/inGLuc cells were cocultured with Jurkat cells (for BH10 and NL43) or CD4 + PBMCs (for YU2 and AD8). For HIV-2 and SIVs (C and D), the transfected 293T cells were cocultured with HeLa-TZM. Cell-to-cell infection/fusion efficiency was determined by measuring GLuc (A) or firefly luciferase activity (D) 24-48 hr after coculture.
