As f and C are changed, the stem-loop tertiary interactions rupture first followed by unfolding of the 3 -end hairpin (I F). Finally, the 5 -end hairpin unravels producing a extended state (E I). A theoretical analysis of the phase boundaries shows that the critical force for rupture scales as (log C m ) \u03b1 with \u03b1 = 1 (0.5) for E I (I F) transition. This relation is used to obtain the preferential ion-RNA interaction coefficient, which can be quantitatively measured in single molecule experiments, as done previously for DNA hairpins. A by product of our work is * Corresponding author the suggestion that the frameshift efficiency is likely determined by the stability of the 5 end hairpin that the ribosome first encounters during translation.",

            "text": "The multifarious roles RNA molecules play in controlling a myriad of cellular functions 1 have made it important to understand in quantitative terms their folding [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] , and how they respond to external stresses. 7 Among them one of simplest structural motifs is the RNA pseudoknot (PK), which is involved 5 in many biological functions. The simplest type, referred to as H-type PK, consists of two stems connected by two loops in which one of the stems forms base pairs with the loop of the other. The PK motif, found in many RNA molecules such as telomerase, 8 mRNA, 9 ribosomal RNA, 10 transfer-messenger RNA, and viral RNA, 11 are functionally important. 12 For instance, a PK in the 10 human telomerase RNA (hTR) is essential for the enzyme (a ribonucleoprotein complex) activity. 13 Many pathogenic mutations in the hTR are found in the well-conserved PK region of the RNA further underscoring the importance of the PK. 8, 13 The presence of PKs are also important in ribozyme catalysis and inhibition of ribosome translation. 15 Recently, there is heightened interest in the biophysics of PK folding because it plays a crucial role in affecting the efficiency of -1 programmed ribosomal frameshifting (-1 PRF). [14] [15] [16] Usually proteins are synthesized when the ribosome reads the mRNA code in three nucleotide steps until the stop codon is reached. In -1 PRF, the open reading frame of mRNA being trans- 20 lated within the ribosome is programmed to be shifted by one nucleotide, and consequently the mRNA becomes non-functional or produces an entirely different protein. 5, [17] [18] [19] [20] The downstream PK of the mRNA is a roadblock at the entrance to the mRNA channel on the ribosome, that impedes the translocation of the ribosome. The ribosome must unfold the PK, presumed to occur by 25 exertion of mechanical force, to complete translocation. Because frameshifting efficiency could depend on how the PK responds to force, a number of single molecule pulling experiments have focussed on PKs. 15, 21, 22 Several factors could determine -1 PRF as evidenced by multitude of proposals based on many experimental studies. 14, 15, [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] Nevertheless, given that ribosome translocation 30 exerts mechanical force on the downstream mRNA, it is physically reasonable to assume that resistance of PK to force should at least be one factor determining the frameshifting efficiency. 14, 29 The considerations given above and the availability of both ensemble and single molecule pulling experimental data prompted us to focus on the effects 35 of temperature, mechanical force, and salt concentration on a 28-nucleotide Htype RNA PK from the Beet Western Yellow Virus (BWYV) . 19 This PK has been the subject of several ensemble experiments, which have characterized the folding thermodynamics as a function of monovalent and divalent cations. 30, 31 The BWYV PK has two stems (S1 and S2) connected by two loops (L1 and 40 L2) as shown in Figure 1 . The crystal structure reveals that L2 forms triplextype tertiary interactions with S1. 32 In another context, it has been shown that such interactions and mutations affecting them dramatically changes the efficiency of frameshifting. 21 In vitro and in vivo experiments on many mutants of BWYV suggest variations in the frameshift efficiency, which for some mutants 45 is attributed to changes in the stem-loop interactions affecting the stability of PK. For others, direct involvement of the ribosome is invoked. 25 In addition to mechanical force (f ), it is known from several ensemble experiments that the stability of BWYV PK, like other RNA molecules, depends on monovalent and divalent cations. 33 Thus, it is important to understand in quantitative detail how 50 this crucial structural motif respond to f as well as changes in ion concentration.",

The excellent agreement between simulations and experiments for the temperature-induced structural transitions and the \u2206G UF (T ) validates the model allowing us to predict the effect of f on BWYV PK. 155 Diagram of states in the [C, f ] plane In order to obtain the phase diagram in the [C, f ] plane of the BWYV PK, we performed a series of low friction Langevin dynamics simulations by varying the salt concentration from 5 to 1200 mM and mechanical force from 0 to 20 pN, at a constant temperature of 50 \u2022 C. We varied C by changing the Debye 160 length in the simulations and the mechanical force was externally applied to the terminal nucleotides (Figure 1A). Determination of the phase diagram in the [C, f ] plane requires an appropriate order parameter that can distinguish between the various states. In single molecule pulling experiments the variable that can be measured is the molecu-165 lar extension, R ee , which is conjugate to the applied force. The overall size of the RNA molecule is assessed using the radius of gyration, R g . Therefore, we characterized the states of the RNA using both R g and R ee as order parameters. The values of the predicted R g at f = 0 can be measured using scattering experiments. Using these two parameters, we obtained the [C, f ] phase diagram 170 (Figure 4). Comparison of the diagram of states in Figures 4D and 4E reveals common features as well as some differences. From Figures 4D and 4E, we infer that at f > 12.5 pN, extended (E) conformations are dominant at all values of C. As the force decreases, the PK forms compact structures. The boundary separating the extended and relatively compact phases depends on the salt 175 concentration as well as the value of the mechanical force. The critical force to rupture the compact structures increases linearly as a function of logarithm of salt concentration (",

The free energy profiles show that under force there are minimally three 205 states, which are F, I, and E. Because R ee cannot capture the complexity of the states populated as C and f are varied, it is important to consider R g as well to fully capture the phase diagram of the PK.

(1) In the high force regime, the two stems are fully ruptured and native interactions are absent creating the E state. (2) Below C \u2248 100 mM and f 10 pN (left bottom on the [C, f ] plane), only S1 is intact, and thus a hairpin conformation is dominant. This 240 is the intermediate state, I2, identified by Soto et al. 31 who found that S1 remains stable even at salt concentration as less as 20 mM NaCl. 31 (3) Above C 100 mM and f 10 pN (right bottom), both S1 and S2 stems are formed and the tertiary interactions involving the two loops are at least partly formed, ensuring that the topology of the PK is native-like. At f = 0 and temperature 245 as a perturbation, it has been shown that another intermediate state, I1, exist between I2 and folded states. 30,31 The I1 state may correspond to two stems fully folded with the entire topology of the native conformation intact, but one in which tertiary interactions between stems and loops are incomplete. Although we have accounted for the presence of such a state in our simulations (see Figure 250 2) from here on we do not distinguish between I1 and the completely folded state in the phase diagram since the increases in Q S2 , Q L1 and Q L2 on the [C, f ] plane almost overlap. Therefore, we classify the right-bottom region in the [C, f ] phase diagram as (I1+F) state. Population analysis of the secondary and tertiary interactions 255 The [C, f ] phase diagrams provide a thermodynamic basis for predicting the structural changes that occur as f and C are varied. However, they capture only the average property of the ensemble within each state without the benefit of providing a molecular picture of the distinct states, which can only be described using simulations done at force values close to those used in laser optical tweezer 260 (LOT) experiments. Therefore, we investigated the distribution of interactions to ascertain the factors that stabilize the three states as C and f are varied. Our analysis is based on the hydrogen bond (HB) energy, U HB . The energy function for HB captures the formation of base pairs and loop-stem tertiary interactions, taking into account both distance and angular positions of the donor and the shows that the probability densities of the total HB energy have three peaks at U HB \u2248 0, \u221230, and \u221260 kcal/mol. In the high-force regime (f > 12.5 pN), there is only one population at all C around U HB \u2248 0, which obviously corresponds to the fully extended state. The total HB energy can 270 be decomposed into contributions arising from four distinct structural motifs in the PK (Figure S5). The peak at U HB \u2248 \u221230 kcal/mol(Figure 7) arises due to the formation of S1 (compareFigures 7 and S5A). The broad peak at U HB \u2248 \u221260 kcal/mol (Figure 7A) is due to the sum of contributions from S2 and the tertiary interactions.",

Only at the highest value of C and f 5 pN, tertiary interactions involving L2 emerge. Interestingly, the order of formation of the various structural elements en route to the formation 285 of their folded state follows the stabilities of the individual elements with the most stable motif forming first. The PK tertiary interactions are consolidated only after assembly of the stable structural elements. This finding follows from our earlier work establishing that the hierarchical assembly of RNA PKs is determined by the stabilities of individual structural elements. 38 290",

The numerical integration is performed using the leap-frog algorithm with time step length \u03b4t L = 0.05\u03c4 where \u03c4 is the unit of time. We performed low friction Langevin 475 dynamics simulations to enhance the rate of conformational sampling. 56 For each condition (salt concentration (C) and mechanical force (f )), we performed 50 independent simulations for 6 \u00d7 10 8 time steps and the last two third of trajectories are used for data analyses.

The replicas are distributed over 16 \u00d7 16 grid. The combined set of simulations using different protocols assures us that the 485 simulations are converged at all conditions.

After demonstrating that our simulations reproduce the temperature-induced structural transitions observed in ensemble experiments, we calculated the global phase diagrams in the [C, f ] plane. The simulations, performed in the same force range as used in Laser Optical Tweezer (LOT) experiments, 19 quantita-tively reproduce the experimental observations. By combining our simulations and a theory based on ion-RNA interactions expressed in terms of preferential interaction coefficients, 31,35 we produce several key predictions. (1) The phase diagram in the [C, f ] plane shows that the folded state (F) ruptures in stages populating distinct intermediates as f increases. Structurally the low force intermediate is similar to the one populated during thermal melting. The sequence of f -induced structural transitions can be described as F I E where E is an extended state. (2) The critical force, f c , to rupture the PK scales as (log C m ) \u03b1 with \u03b1 = 1 for the I E transition and \u03b1 = 0.5 for the I F transition. We expect this result to be valid for H-type PKs comprised of stems with vastly different stability, such as the BWYV PK. This result is of general validity and is applicable to other PKs as well. The slope of the f c versus log C m is proportional to the changes in the preferential interaction coefficient between an intermediate and unfolded states. This prediction can be used in conjunction with single molecule experiments allowing for direct measurement of a key quantity in ion-RNA interactions. (3) To the extent the downstream PK is a road block for translation, our work suggests that the ribosome should exert a force \u223c (10 \u2212 15) pN 36 for unimpeded translocation along mRNA, although the actual force value could vary depending on factors such as interaction between",
