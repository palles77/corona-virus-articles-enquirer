They are also known as dihydropyrazoles and their chemistry are closely related to pyrazoles. According to heterocyclic nomenclature, pyrazolines require that the nitrogen atoms to be numbered 1 and 2 in each structure. There are three well-known tautomeric structures for pyrazolines namely: 1-pyrazoline, 2-pyrazoline and 3-pyrazoline ( Figure 1 ). However, among these tautomeric structures, 2-pyrazoline is the most common.",

The reaction of a,b-unsaturated aldehydes and ketones with hydrazines became one of the most popular methods for the preparation of 2-pyrazolines [7, 8] . In this method, hydrazones are formed as intermediates, which can be subsequently cyclized to 2-pyrazolines in the presence of a suitable cyclizing reagent like acetic acid. An alternative route involves 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition of nitrileimines to carbon--carbon double bond of arylmethylene (arylidene derivatives of active methylene) compounds as well as acrylic and cinnamic acid derivatives [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] . The discovery of this class of compounds and considering their efficiency as drugs provides an outstanding case history of modern drug developments and also points out the unpredictability of pharmacological activity from structural modification of a prototype drug molecule. In general, pyrazoline derivatives display a broad spectrum of potential pharmacological activities and have wide medical applications.",

CB1 receptor antagonists have good prospects in many therapeutic areas, such as smoking and alcohol addiction as well as cognitive impairment. Recently, new chemical entities (NCEs) with CB1 antagonistic properties, structurally related to rimonabant 1, have been disclosed by some academic research groups and several pharmaceutical companies as well. There are a considerable number of CB1 antagonists that are bioisosteres and derived from rimonabant (1) by replacement of the pyrazole moiety with other heterocyclic analogs like pyrazoline.",

Several 3-(3-acetoamino)phenyl-1,5-substituted phenyl-2-pyrazolines 51 --53 were synthesized by Singh et al. [61] and evaluated for their anticonvulsant activity. The synthesized pyrazolines 51 --53 exhibited anticonvulsant activity, which was reflected by 60 --80% protection observed versus PTZ-induced seizures. Those compounds exhibit their anticonvulsant potentials via inhibiting oxidation of certain nicotinamide--adenine--dinucleotide substrates.",

A variety of 3-(3-bromophenyl)-5-phenyl-1-(thiazolo[4,5-b] quinoxaline-2-yl)-2-pyrazoline derivative, as represented by compound 112, have been achieved by Budakoti et al.

Also, the same authors have synthesized a novel Pd (II) complexes with 1-N-substituted thiocarbamoyl-3,5-diphenyl-2-pyrazoline (Budakoti et al. [124] ) and evaluated their antiamoebic activity by micro-dilution method against HM1:IMSS strain of E. histolytica and compared the results with the standard drug metronidazole. These palladium complexes showed better activity than their corresponding ligands. The pyrazoline 113a showed better inhibitory [124] . Similarly, Husain et al. reported another series of Pd(II) complexes, represented below by the most active compound 113b [125] . But this series of compounds were less active than 113a in terms of IC 50 values; however, complex 113b (IC 50 = 0.37 \u00b5M) is more active than metronidazole [125] .",
