We also used IDV positive French cattle serum (from an experimental infection) and BEI Resources (NIAID) chicken antiserum C/Taylor/1233/47. The reference sera were RDE treated and hemadsorbed. When adsorbing both (i) the IDV reference antiserum on ICV and (ii) the ICV reference antiserum on IDV, and retesting for the respective antigens, we lost 1 log2 in titer, suggesting a 2-fold difference in HI titer is the \"normal\" loss of antibody due to the additional treatment of the sera. We therefore considered a 2 log2 decrease in titer as the threshold to consider crossreactivity between ICV and IDV.",

In Benin, all ruminant sera originated from the Northern part of the country and were collected in 2012 and 2014 for the bovine sera, in 2013-2014 for the small ruminant sera. In Togo, all sera originated from the Lom\u00e9 area (Southern part of the country) and were collected in 2009 and 2015 for the bovine sera, and in 2013 for the small ruminant sera. In C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, all bovine sera were collected from the northeastern part of the country (Bouak\u00e9, Panya, and Boundiali, in 1991-1992) and from the southwestern part of the country (Bingerville and Grand Bassam, in 2013-2014) for the swine sera. In Kenya, dromedary camels were sampled before slaughter in the central camel slaughterhouse in Nairobi, Kenya. All were therefore of slaughter age and were geographically representative of all camel keeping regions of the country. The Kenyan cattle was sampled from 2010 through 2012 in the Western part of the country (close to Lake Victoria, GPS coordinates: 0.084<latitude<0.740; 33.995<longitude<34.527).",
