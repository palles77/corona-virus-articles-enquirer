            "text": "Following intracranial infection with the neurotropic JHM strain of mouse hepatitis virus (JHMV), susceptible mice will develop widespread myelin destruction that results in pathological and clinical outcomes similar to those seen in humans with the demyelinating disease Multiple Sclerosis (MS). Partial remyelination and clinical recovery occurs during the chronic phase following control of viral replication yet the signaling mechanisms regulating these events remain enigmatic. Here we report the kinetics of proliferation and maturation of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) within the spinal cord following JHMV-induced demyelination and that CXCR4 signaling contributes to the maturation state of OPCs. Following treatment with AMD3100, a specific inhibitor of CXCR4, mice recovering from widespread demyelination exhibit a significant (P < 0.01) increase in the number of OPCs and fewer (P < 0.05) mature oligodendrocytes compared with HBSS-treated animals. These results suggest that CXCR4 signaling is required for OPCs to mature and contribute to remyelination in response to JHMVinduced demyelination. To assess if this effect is reversible and has potential therapeutic benefit, we pulsed mice with AMD3100 and then allowed them to recover. This treatment strategy resulted in increased numbers of mature oligodendrocytes, enhanced remyelination, and improved clinical outcome. These findings highlight the possibility to manipulate OPCs in order to increase the pool of remyelination-competent cells that can participate in recovery.",

            "text": "Remyelination failure in patients with the demyelinating disease multiple sclerosis (MS) results in progressive neurodegeneration (Trapp et al., 1998) . In the early stages of MS, resident oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) are thought to replenish myelinating cells that subsequently repair demyelinated lesions. However, as the disease progresses, the ability of OPCs to participate in repair is diminished. Previous studies in diverse experimental models of CNS disease have given insight into the kinetics of OPC proliferation and maturation following neurologic infection or insult. Indeed, these findings indicate that OPC proliferation rates increase dramatically from baseline levels during disease or injury to restore mature oligodendrocyte numbers lost during toxin-induced damage (Aharoni et al., 2008; Armstrong et al., 2006; Blakemore and Keirstead, 1999; McTigue and Tripathi, 2008; Penkowa and Hidalgo, 2003) . Furthermore, higher levels of myelin debris found during active disease have been reported to restrict OPC maturation, thereby preventing damage of new oligodendrocytes while at the same time possibly keeping OPCs in a proliferative state (Kotter et al., 2006) . However, the molecular and cellular mechanisms that contribute to OPC proliferation/maturation are complex and additional insight into factors associated with these processes is needed. Understanding the events and signaling involved in how quiescent OPCs respond to inflammation-induced demyelination is essential to any effort seeking to treat demyelinating diseases.",

Susceptible mice inoculated i.c. with JHMV develop a disease with both clinical and histologic features similar to MS (Cheever et al., 1949) . During the acute stage of the infection, extensive oligodendrocyte damage results from direct infection as well as from the indirect effects of the inflammatory environment (Lampert et al., 1973; Wang et al., 1990) . Although viral replication is controlled, sterile immunity is not achieved and virus will persist primarily in white matter tracts. Demyelination ensues as activated immune cells, e.g., T cells and macrophages accumulate in the CNS primarily within areas of viral persistence. Eventually, remyelination of axons will occur although not immediately, indicating that mircoenvironmental signals may suppress myelin repair mediated by this resident cell population. Thus, the JHMV model provides a relevant model system to interrogate mechanisms of inadequate remyelination by cells of an oligodendrocyte lineage during periods of immune-mediated demyelination (Bergmann et al., 2006; Cheever et al., 1949; Wang et al., 1990) . Here, we report the kinetics of OPC proliferation and their subsequent maturation following JHMV infection. We also provide evidence that CXCR4 signaling contributes to OPC differentiation into mature oligodendrocytes and show that it is possible to harness this mechanism to improve remyelination.",

Extensive demyelination is apparent in the ventral funiculus and in lateral white matter tracts as evidenced by luxol fast blue (LFB) staining ( Fig. 1B) .

            "text": "To better understand mechanisms associated with remyelination in response to JHMVinduced demyelination, we first examined how CNS infection influences survival of cells of the oligodendrocyte lineage. Coronal spinal cord sections were stained for oligodendrocytes (GST\u03c0-positive) and OPCs (PDGFR\u03b1-positive) ( Fig. 2A ,B) and positive cells enumerated. GST\u03c0-positive cell numbers dropped precipitously from ~500 cells mm \u22122 of white matter in healthy animals to ~250 cells mm \u22122 by 10 days p.i. These cells then rebounded to ~600 cells mm \u22122 by 49 days p.i. (Fig. 2C ). The decline in numbers of oligodendrocytes coincided with increased resident OPC proliferation and numbers. Prior to infection, mice have ~20 PDGFR\u03b1-positive cells mm \u22122 of white matter and about 3% of these are expressing the proliferative marker Ki67. By 6 days p.i. ~25% of PDGFR\u03b1-positive cells are expressing Ki67 and by Day 14 p.i., OPC proliferation rates have decreased to ~13% and cell numbers have reached ~125 cells mm \u22122 (Fig. 2D,E) . A similar rebound in oligodendrocyte numbers following viral control as well as a proliferative burst of OPCs following infection with a related neurotropic strain of mouse hepatitis virus have been previously reported (Armstrong et al., 2002; Redwine and Armstrong, 1998) . These data suggest that endogenous OPCs are proliferating and replenishing mature oligodendrocyte pools. Furthermore, we re-stained sections from Day 14 p.i. with LFB to correlate the location of OPCs with regard to myelinated and demyelinated areas. We found that OPC densities were enriched within areas cleared of myelin by 14 days p.i (Fig. 2F) . These findings indicate that OPCs can reside and proliferate in areas of active demyelination and that OPC migration into areas of demyelination is carried out by Day 14 p.i.",

Continuous delivery of AMD3100 or HBSS was achieved with s.c.-implanted osmotic pumps in JHMV-infected mice on Day 14 p.i. At this time, demyelination is established in surviving mice and demyelinated areas have high concentrations of OPCs. Treatment with AMD3100 did not dampen T cell infiltration into the CNS at any time following treatment (Fig. 4A,B) . Moreover, no evidence of increased inflammatory leukocyte migration from the microvasculature into the parenchyma was observed in response to AMD3100 treatment (Fig. 4C ) as has been previously reported during autoimmune neuroinflammation (McCandless et al., 2006) .",

Furthermore, we correlated the location of immunopositive cells with LFB staining to identify if labeled cells were in myelinated or demyelinated areas. The morphology of PDGFR\u03b1-positive cells within AMD3100-treated animals revealed characteristic morphology of OPCs, e.g., predominantly bi-polar cells and this was in marked contrast to a more arborized appearance of PDGFR\u03b1-positive cells in response to HBSS treatment, suggesting more mature OPCs (Fig. 5A) . Quantification of PDGFR\u03b1-positive cells within the spinal cords of AMD3100-treated mice revealed a significant (P < 0.05) increase of these cells in total white matter and particularly so in demyelinated (P < 0.001) white matter when compared with HBSS-treated mice (Fig. 5B) . The overall increase in PDGFR\u03b1 staining in response to AMD3100 was associated with increased proliferation of these cells as determined by Ki67 staining (Fig. 5C) . Correspondingly, there was a significant reduction (P < 0.05) in numbers of GST\u03c0-positive cells in demyelinated areas in response to AMD3100 treatment when compared with HBSS-treated mice (Fig. 5D ). TUNEL staining indicated that CXCR4 antagonism did not affect survival of GST\u03c0-positive cells (Fig. 5E ) as very few TUNEL-positive cells are present 35 days p.i. in controls or AMD3100-treated mice. There were no differences in the number of TUNEL/GST\u03c0 double-positive cells between groups following 3 weeks of treatment. Collectively, these data suggest that CXCR4 antagonism impedes the normal OPC response to JHMV infection, i.e., by hindering maturation and augmenting proliferation. Surprisingly, we did not observe a significant difference in remyelination (Fig. 5F ) or clinical scores (Fig. 5G ) between these treatment groups.",

Two weeks after AMD3100 treatment was stopped, spinal cord sections from control (Fig. 6A) and treatment (Fig. 6B ) groups stained for GST\u03c0 and BrdU revealed a marked difference in numbers of GST\u03c0positive and GST\u03c0/BrdU double-positive cells.

When compared with the numbers of GST\u03c0-positive cells mm \u22122 observed in animals sacrificed immediately after treatment (Fig. 5B) , mice receiving the HBSS treatment regimen had ~200 more cells mm \u22122 whereas mice in the AMD3100 group had ~400 more cells mm \u22122 . Accordingly, similar numbers of GST\u03c0/BrdU double-positive cells mm \u22122 were observed in these mice, indicating that the increase in GST\u03c0-positive cells in AMD3100 treated animals originated from cells incorporating BrdU during the treatment window (Fig. 6D) . Numbers of PDGFR\u03b1-positive cells mm \u22122 of white matter were not different between groups following this treatment strategy (Fig. 6E) . To assess if the resulting increase in mature oligodendrocytes had a physiological impact, we monitored clinical improvement and quantified the amount of remyelination present in the spinal cords of control and treated mice. Mice receiving AMD3100 during the treatment window had improved clinical recovery when compared with controls (P < 0.05) (Fig. 6F) . Furthermore, these mice also had a significant increase in remyelination (P < 0.05) (Fig. 6G,H) .",

            "text": "It has long been accepted that OPCs will proliferate in response to active demyelination and will subsequently mature into myelinating cells to initiate repair (Aharoni et al., 2008; Armstrong et al., 2006; Blakemore and Keirstead, 1999; Bunge et al., 1961; Keirstead and Blakemore, 1999; Liu et al., 2010; Ludwin, 1979; McTigue and Tripathi, 2008; Murtie et al., 2005; Penkowa and Hidalgo, 2003) . However, increased understanding of the kinetics of OPC proliferation and differentiation during the course of inflammation-mediated demyelination is necessary. We used a model of demyelination triggered by viral infection to better understand signals controlling OPC maturation and remyelination within the context of immune-mediated white matter damage. Following intracranial infection with JHMV, PDGFR\u03b1-positive cell replication increases and this coincides with the peak levels of infiltrating, activated immune cells into the CNS seen around Day 6 p.i. (Bergmann et al., 2006) . This increase in proliferation correlates with neuroinflammation and onset of damage to mature oligodendrocytes. Numbers of PDGFR\u03b1-positive cells increase sixfold between Days 6 and 14 p.i., yet by 35 days p.i., the frequency of PDGFR\u03b1-positive cells expressing Ki67 has dropped to levels statistically indistinguishable to those seen in uninfected mice. GST\u03c0-positive cells, in contrast, rebound to pre-infection levels by 49 days p.i. This rebound is presumably due to maturing OPCs that aid in remyelinating axons and is not associated with complete clinical recovery and remyelination.",

To this end, extensive studies in vivo have shed light on the roles of several cytokines, growth factors and transcription factors on influencing OPC biology (Imitola et al., 2003) . For example, signaling through the CXC chemokine receptor 2 (CXCR2) signaling has been shown to be involved in OPC proliferation and differentiation as its inhibition resulted in reduced proliferation and increased maturation in an autoimmune model of demyelination as well as in toxin-induced lesions (Kerstetter et al., 2009) . Huang et al. (2010) used RNA interference knockdown of retinoid acid receptor RXR-\u03b3 to identify it as an important positive regulator of OPC differentiation into mature oligodendrocytes. Furthermore, Armstrong and colleagues have used the JHMV-model to extensively characterize PDGF and FGF2 as regulators of proliferation and differentiation of OPCs. Their studies have shown that these growth factors stimulate OPC proliferation and inhibit differentiation and, more specifically, that FGF2 interacts with notch signaling to inhibit OPC maturation (Armstrong et al., 2002; Frost et al., 2003; Murtie et al., 2005) .",

Indeed, astrocytes are a source for CXCL12 following JHMV infection of the CNS (Carbajal et al., 2010) . In MS patients, both activated and silent lesions have activated astrocytes expressing CXCL12 (Moll et al., 2009) . Accordingly, this chemokine has been shown to have an important role in CNS biology. Cultured OPC migration, proliferation, and maturation have been shown to be associated with CXCL12 signaling through CXCR4 (Dziembowska et al., 2005; Kadi et al., 2006; Maysami et al., 2006) . We have previously shown in vivo that transplanted neural stem cells rely on CXCL12/CXCR4 signaling to migrate away from engraftment site to areas of demyelination following JHMV infection (Carbajal et al., 2010) .

Treatment was restricted to the chronic stage as blocking CXCR4 signaling has been shown to modulate T-cell infiltration into the CNS by facilitating their exit from the perivascular space into the parenchyma during acute viral encephalitis (McCandless et al., 2008b) . Importantly, we did not observe any effect on either T cell migration to the CNS nor leukocyte entry into the parenchyma following AMD3100 treatment during chronic JHMVinduced disease. More importantly, our strategy for AMD3100 treatment was to concentrate on determining how CXCR4 signaling impacted function of cells of the oligodendrocyte lineage following establishment of demyelination. Our findings indicate that CXCR4 antagonism mutes OPC maturation to oligodendrocytes and results in higher rates of proliferation. Importantly, these findings support and extend earlier work by Patel and colleagues (Patel et al., 2010) using a toxin-induced model of oligodendrocyte death in the corpus callossum to reveal that OPCs with impaired CXCR4 signaling had impaired maturation and increased rates of proliferation. Allowing mice to recover following the removal of AMD3100 treatment from JHMV-infected mice was associated with increased numbers of mature oligodendrocytes that correlated with improved motor skills and enhanced remyelination. These data suggest that release from blocking CXCR4 signaling allowed OPCs to mature and ultimately lead to increased numbers of mature oligodendrocytes capable of contributing to remyelination. ",

(B) Representative coronal spinal cord section stained with luxol fast blue (LFB) and H&E depicts the characteristic ventral and lateral white matter demyelination in animals infected with JHMV at Day 35 p.i. (C) A representative light microscopy image of a toluidine blue-stained coronal section showing remyelinated (*) and demyelinated (#) axons at 35 days p.i., (scale bar= 5 \u03bcm). Clinical scores of mice in the two groups after 3 weeks of treatment did not reach a significant difference. For Panels A and E, scale bar = 20 \u03bcm. For panels B, C, and D, data represents two independent experiments with n \u2265 4 per group; data is presented as average \u00b1 SD; *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001. Release from AMD3100 treatment increases numbers of mature oligodendrocytes. JHMVinfected mice were pulsed with BrdU and either AMD3100 or HBSS for 3 weeks beginning on Day 14 p.i. Osmotic pumps were excised and mice allowed to recover for 2 weeks at which point animals were sacrificed and spinal cords removed.

(F) Release from AMD3100 treatment is associated with improved motor skills compared with mice that had been treated with HBSS that is associated with an increase in the frequency of remyelinated axons in spinal cord (G). (H) Representative toluidine blue sections revealed increased numbers of remyelinated axons (*) and fewer demyelinated axons (#) in AMD3100 treated mice compared with HBSS-treated mice. Data for all figures was derived from two independent experiments with a minimum of eight mice/experiment.
