When gM-pHluorin is 242 incorporated into virus particles and surrounding secretory vesicle membrane 243 during secondary envelopment, pHluorin fluorescence is strongly quenched in 244 the acidic lumen of the secretory organelle. Upon exocytosis, the pHluorin moiety 245 is exposed to the higher extracellular pH and becomes brightly fluorescent, 246 revealing the location and moment of virus particle egress [14,15]. We infected 247 primary SCG cultures with PRV 483, expressing gM-pHluorin and fluorescent 248 capsid protein (mRFP-VP26), and imaged by Total Internal Reflection 249 Fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy. In agreement with previous work in non-250 neuronal cells, we detected exocytosis of individual virus particles based on the 251 sharp increase in gM-pHluorin fluorescence. We detected exocytosis of both 252 virions, categorized based on the colocalization of gM-pHluorin and mRFP-VP26 253 capsid fluorescence, and light particles, categorized based on the absence of 254 mRFP-VP26 (Fig 5A-B). Previously, we observed that egress of PRV virions 255 occurs as early as 4.5-5 hpi in non-neuronal PK15 cells [14]. Here we observed 256 PRV particles undergoing exocytosis from the cell body of SCG neurons as early 257 as 5-6 hpi, much earlier than the previously-reported increases in neuronal 258 activity and increases in intracellular Ca 2+ at 8-10 hpi [10,22]. particle exocytosis from neuronal cell bodies is not correlated with 261 local Ca 2+ dynamics. 262 In addition to global membrane depolarization and Ca 2+ transients associated 263 with neuronal firing activity, neurons and other excitable cell types, including 264 SCG neurons in particular [32], also exhibit smaller localized Ca 2+ transients, 265 variously described as \"Ca 2+ sparks\", \"Ca 2+ glows\", or \"syntillas\". These local 266 Ca 2+ dynamics are highly variable in amplitude, time course, and likely result 267 from a variety of intracellular signaling pathways [32-36]. To determine whether 268 virus exocytosis events are correlated with local Ca 2+ dynamics, we infected 269 primary SCG cultures with PRV 486, expressing gM-pHluorin, loaded cells with 270 the membrane permeant Ca 2+ -sensitive dye Rhod-2-AM, and imaged beginning 271 at 5 hpi. Infected neurons exhibited local Ca 2+ dynamics indicated by local 272 changes in Rhod-2-AM fluorescence intensity (Fig 5C-D). To generalize the 273 relationship between fluorescent signals, we measured the gM-pHluorin and 274 Rhod-2-AM fluorescence of many exocytosis events, aligned them to a common 275 timescale based on the moment of exocytosis, and calculated an ensemble 276 average showing the relative fluorescence intensity over time. In this analysis, 277 virus exocytosis events were not associated spatially or temporally with local 278 Ca 2+ dynamics (Fig 5E), consistent with previous studies indicating that individual 279 local Ca 2+ transients are not correlated with spontaneous exocytosis in 280 uninfected neurons and chromaffin cells [34particle exocytosis from neuronal cell bodies uses constitutive 283 secretory pathway. 284 To characterize the viral secretory vesicle and identify cellular factors involved in 285 PRV egress, we transduced primary SCG cultures with non-replicating 286 adenovirus vectors expressing mCherry red fluorescent protein-tagged Rab 287 GTPases. Approximately 18 hr after transduction, we infected with PRV 486, 288 expressing gM-pHluorin, and imaged cell bodies 5-6 hr after PRV infection. To 289 generalize the relationship between fluorescent signals, we measured gM-290 pHluorin and mCherry-Rab GTPase fluorescence of many exocytosis events, 291 aligned them based on moment of exocytosis, and calculated an ensemble 292 average of relative fluorescence intensity over time (Fig 5F-I). An increase in Rab 293 fluorescence before exocytosis represents the gradual arrival of Rab-positive 294 secretory vesicles to their sites of exocytosis. After exocytosis, Rab protein 295 fluorescence rapidly decays, representing diffusion away from the site of 296 exocytosis, consistent with the dynamic regulation of Rab activity and membrane297 binding by GTP hydrolysis(Fig 5F-I). Using this method, we found that Rab6a 298 and Rab8a, which mediate constitutive exocytosis of post-Golgi secretory 299 vesicles, are dynamically associated with viral exocytosis(Fig 5F-G), in 300 agreement with our previous results in non-neuronal cells[14,15]. In contrast, we 301 previously observed that Rab11a, which mediates trafficking of recycling 302 endosomes, is also associated with viral secretory vesicles in non-neuronal cells;",

Here we 319 present four pieces of evidence that contradict this view. Using Campenot tri-320 chambers to measure transneuronal virus spread, and tetrodotoxin to silence 321 neuronal activity, we observed no inhibition of virus spread from primary neurons.322 Using KCl or optogenetics to elevate neuronal activity, we also show no increase 323 in virus spread. Using a live-cell fluorescence microscopy method to directly 324 assay virus egress from infected neurons, we observed no association between 325 virus particle exocytosis and intracellular Ca 2+ signaling. Finally, we observed326 virus particle exocytosis occurs in association with constitutive secretory Rab 327 GTPases, Rab6a and Rab8a, not Rab proteins that are associated with the Ca 2+ -328 regulated secretory pathway in neurons, Rab3a and Rab11a. Therefore, we These observations have several important clinical implications. Our findings 335 suggest the altered electrophysiology and elevated activity is an epiphenomenon 336 of alpha herpesvirus infection in neurons and is not required for productive 337 assembly and egress of progeny virions. Therefore, medical interventions 338 treating sensory neuropathic symptoms or targeting regulated secretory 339 mechanisms in neurons (e.g. neurotoxins) are unlikely to inhibit the spread of 340 alpha herpesviruses in the nervous system. However, therapeutic strategies that 341 target cellular factors common to both regulated and constitutive secretory 342 pathways might inhibit virus egress and spread. For example, botulinum 343 neurotoxin A (Botox) cleaves the SNARE protein SNAP-25, which is required for 344 both Ca 2+ -regulated exocytosis of synaptic vesicles (hence a neurotoxin) as well 345 as intracellular trafficking and constitutive exocytosis in neurons and non-346 neuronal cells [37].

            "text": "are several important limitations of our approaches. Foremost, while SCG 352 neurons do form functional synapses in vitro, measuring transneuronal virus 353 spread through the Campenot tri-chamber cannot distinguish between spread via 354 these neuronal synapses and spread via other non-synaptic cell-cell contacts. It 355 is therefore possible that alpha herpesviruses do spread via neuronal synapses 356 in an activity-dependent manner, but this was not detected in our assays 357 because the virus also spreads efficiently via non-synaptic cell-cell contacts in an 358 activity-independent manner. It is important to note that in this study, using our 359 live-cell fluorescence microscopy method, we only observed virus particle 360 exocytosis from neuron cell bodies. It is therefore possible that alpha 361 herpesviruses use the constitutive secretory pathway for egress from the cell 362 body and other non-synaptic egress sites, but use Ca 2+ -regulated secretory 363 mechanisms for egress specifically at neuronal synapses. To resolve these 364 remaining ambiguities, in future studies it will be necessary to directly observe 365 virus egress and spread specifically at neuronal synapses to distinguish the 366 molecular and cellular mechanisms of synaptic versus non-synaptic cell-cell 367 spread.368 369 Materials and Methods 370 Cells 371 PK15 cells (ATCC CCL-33) were cultured in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium 372 (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% 373 penicillin/streptomycin, at 37\uf0b0C and 5% CO 2 . Primary embryonic rat superior 374 cervical ganglion (SCG) neurons were isolated and cultured as previously [23]. To measure anterograde spread, neurons were cultured in 376 modified Campenot tri-chambers, as previously described [23]. For TIRF 377 microscopy, SCG neurons were cultured on 35mm glass-bottom tissue culture 378 dishes (Mattek), which were treated by corona discharge (Electro-Technic 379 Products) and sequentially coating with poly-DL-ornithine and laminin. For 380 extracellular electrode recording, SCG neurons were cultured on a multielectrode 381 array (Multichannel Systems), which was prepared by sequentially coating with 382 polyethylenimine (PEI) and laminin. In all cases, neurons were cultured in 383 Neurobasal medium supplemented with B-27 (ThermoFisher), glutamine, 384 penicillin/streptomycin, and nerve growth factor (NGF), as previously described 385 [23], for 3-4 weeks to achieve a fully-differentiated and polarized neuronal 386 phenotype.",

PRV 180, expressing an mRFP-VP26 capsid protein fusion, was 400 previously described[40]. PRV 468, expressing mRFP-VP26 and the fluorescent 401 protein Ca 2+ sensor GCaMP3, was previously described[11]. PRV 486, 402 expressing mRFP-VP26 and gM-pHluorin, was previously described[14]. SCG403 neurons were infected with PRV recombinants at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) 404 of approximately 5 pfu/cell, unless otherwise in the figure or figure legend. 405 Adenovirus vectors expressing mCherry-tagged Rab3a, Rab6a, Rab8a, and 406 Rab11a were previously described [14]. SCG neurons were transduced with 407 adenovirus vectors approximately 18 hours before co-infection with PRV. An 408 adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector expressing channelrhodopsin2 (ChR2) 409 fused to mCherry (AAV2/1.CAG.hChR2(H134R)-mCherry.WPRE.SV40) was 410 obtained from the U. Pennsylvania Vector Core. SCG cultures were inoculated 411 with 10 7 transducing units of AAV and screened by fluorescence microscopy for 412 >80% transduction efficiency. 413 414 Optogenetics and Extracellular Electrode Recording 415 SCG neurons transduced with AAV vectors expressing ChR2 were exposed 416 using a blue LED light box with an excitation spectrum of approximately 457/46 417 nm (Clare Chemical Research, Denver, CO, USA) [41], driven by an Arduino Uno 418 Rev3 microcontroller programmed to deliver light pulses at approximately 12 Hz 419 (see S1 Supporting Materials and Methods). Extracellular recordings of and light-evoked spiking activity were digitized at 10 kHz and stored 421 for offline analysis, as previously described [42]. The extracellular recordings 422 were composed of fast negative voltage spikes from individual neurons, 423 superimposed on a slowly fluctuating local field potential generated by the 424 average activity of many nearby neurons. Recordings were processed by 425 subtracting electronic noise recorded on a reference electrode and 200 Hz high-426 pass filtered to remove local field potentials, spikes were identified using a 427 threshold of -30 \uf06dV, and average spike frequency and peak-to-peak amplitude 428 were measured using MC_Rack software (Multichannel Systems).429 430 431 Fluorescence Microscopy and Image Processing 432 Tiled images of entire neurite compartments in tri-chambers were acquired using 433 an automated epifluorescence microscope equipped with a 37\uf0b0C and 5% CO 2 434 environmental chamber for long-term imaging of live cells, as previously 435 described [43]. To measure the total fluorescence in chambered neuronal 436 cultures, we performed background subtraction and feature selection using 437 median filter background subtraction and granulometric filtering in Fiji/ImageJ 438 v.1.52b software, as previously described [44]. Total Internal Reflection 439 Fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy was performed using a Nikon N-STORM 440 fluorescence microscope, as previously described [14,15]. Images were prepared 441 for publication using the following functions and plugins in Fiji/ImageJ: adjust 442 brightness and contrast, Z project (to make maximum intensity projections). We maximum difference projections in Fiji/ImageJ as follows: Image 444 values at time n were subtracted from values at time n+5 to identify pixels where 445 fluorescence intensity increases, and the resulting image stacks were then 446 processed by maximum intensity projection to highlight areas where fluorescence 447 intensity increases the most.448 449 Acknowledgements 450 Thank you to members of the Lynn Enquist, Michael Berry, Joshua Shaevitz, Sam",
