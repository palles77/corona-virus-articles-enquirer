They provide antigens that may be incorporated into vaccines composed of peptides, proteins, and polysaccharides. They may also be indirectly introduced to the host immune system through recombinant DNA plasmids or chimeric virus vectors. Inactivated vaccines are killed through the use of heat or chemicals, whereas attenuated vaccines contain live, less virulent organisms. Often these vaccines are derived from live viruses that have been cultured under conditions that disable their pathogenic properties. Attenuated vaccines often produce a durable immunological response and, thus, are preferred for many classes of infectious agents. Subcomponents of micro-organisms may also be used as antigens in vaccines. For example, toxoid vaccines are made from inactivated toxic components and offer protection from the effects of the infection. Additionally, fragments or subunits of an attenuated or inactivated micro-organism can also be used as the basis of an antigenic response to a vaccine. Subcomponents may also be used for other purposes, for example, poorly immunogenic components of micro-organisms can be improved by their conjugation to proteins which typically are toxins. This approach is often used in conjunction with polysaccharides, which form the outer coat of some infectious bacteria such as Haemophilus influenzae type B vaccine. Immunization with DNA plasmids and virus vectors involves vaccines that encode an antigen protein which are subsequently expressed within cells of the recipient following administration of the vaccine.",

These cells serve to inhibit immune responses that are potentially harmful by inhibiting or increasing Th1 or Th2 activity. Treg activity is believed to play a role in controlling autoimmune diseases which could possibly arise from wayward responses to the antigen contained in vaccines through antigen spread response. An interaction between vaccine antigens and adjuvants with Treg is likely but remains unclear and requires further research [1] .

These authors found that Lewis rats with a Th1-biased immune response differed in their reaction to aluminum hydroxide adjuvanted vaccine from Sprague-Dawley rats, which have a more balanced Th1/Th2 immune response. Lewis rats demonstrated significantly smaller MMF lesions than Sprague-Dawley rats. In another study, monkeys given diphtheria-tetanus vaccines containing aluminium adjuvants were found to have varying degrees of macrophage aggregation at the site of injection, although no evidence of either behavioral or muscular weakness was evident [33] .

Alum has the propensity to induce effective levels of antibodies mediated by Th2 responses, but has little capacity to stimulate cellular responses mediated by Th1 mechanisms. The latter is an important aspect of immunity for some newer efforts in the development of vaccines [35] . Additionally novel adjuvants address the need to develop more powerful antibody responses in human populations with insufficient responses to vaccines using alum, such as the newborn, elderly and immunocompromised individuals.

These adverse effects reflect the activation of various components of the immune system, and will vary with the specific nature of the vaccine antigen and/or adjuvant. Similarly to naturally occurring infections, the administration of a vaccine results in the activation of cells regulating immunity and the resultant inflammation is accompanied by the release of various proinflammatory cytokines and frequently evokes an acute phase response. For example, van der Beek et al.

Other similar studies have revealed increases in the blood levels of various cytokines and acute phase reactants involved in immune and inflammatory responses. Reinhardt et al.

The incidence of autoimmune-induced disease is low, and in many cases cannot be reliably associated with the administration of vaccines. Although no unequivocal associations are known, various possible pathogenic mechanisms exist. Molecular mimicry is the result of an immune response to shared epitopes between antigens of the host and antigenic components of the vaccine. To access this potential toxicity, protein sequences may be screened in computer base searches of amino acid structures between antigenic protein components and known protein structures. Another possible mechanism for the autoimmune phenomenon is epitope spreading. Three different types of this are believed possible; shared identical amino acid sequences between peptides and/or proteins, homologous but non-identical amino acid sequences, and epitopes on dissimilar chemical structures such between DNA and peptides or carbohydrates and peptides.",

T-cells may exhibit epitope spreading as a response, which is not directed at the original epitope, but as recognition of epitopes in target tissue proteins expressed in the inflammatory process caused by the vaccine. Additionally, other theoretical mechanisms exist. These include activation by superantigens of a large fraction of T-cell populations and induction of inflammatory cytokines and co-stimulatory molecules.

For studying intracutaneous or topical vaccines, the mini-pig is considered a good model [59] . The baboon was used to investigate a novel adjuvant for intranasal immunization because of its physiological and pharmacological similarities with humans [60] . For more specific investigations, such as RSV vaccine, hamsters [61] are sometimes used. Animal models for vaccine preclinical toxicology studies will be discussed in more detail later in this chapter. Different vaccines and/or adjuvants may require different approaches for immunogenicity testing. Enhancing IgA responses might be more appropriate for mucosal vaccines development [62\u00c064] . T-cellmediated responses may play a key role in the vaccines' immunogenicity just as or more important than the humoral response (see the introduction section).",

Clinical chemistry tests are used to diagnose disease, to monitor disease progression or response to therapy or toxin exposure, and to screen for the presence of underlying disease in apparently healthy animals. A wide variety of clinical chemistry tests are used for this purpose. The results of the following parameters are included in the clinical chemistry testing [73] : a) Electrolyte balance (calcium, chloride, phosphorus, potassium, and sodium). Changes in free water and changes in electrolytes themselves (rate of intake, excretion/loss, and translocation within the body) affect the electrolyte levels in blood. As electrolytes are essential to the proper functioning of cells, the body maintains electrolyte concentrations within narrow limits. b) Carbohydrate metabolism [glucose (principal source of energy for mammalian cells)]. Sources of glucose includes: digestion of dietary carbohydrates, breakdown of glycogen in the liver (glycogenolysis) and production of glucose from amino acid precursors in the liver (gluconeogenesis). Hormones (e.g., insulin, glucagon, catecholamine, growth hormone, and corticosteroids) affect blood glucose concentration by facilitating its entry into or removal from the circulation. Changes in blood glucose levels due to test article treatment could be an indication of an adverse event through the above-mentioned pathways. c) Liver function [alanine animotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), sorbitol dehydrogenase [SDH], glutamate dehydrogenase (GLDH), total bile acids, alkaline phosphate (ALP), gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT), and total bilirubin]. Injury to liver parenchymal cells can be detected by measuring the hepatocellular leakage enzymes (ALT, AST, SDH, and GLDH). Enzyme leakage from cells through damaged cell membranes is indicated by the increased serum activity of these enzymes. Cholestasis, which implies impairment of bile flow, is diagnosed by the changes in ALP and GGT levels. Cholestasis will result in elevations of bilirubin in blood if it is severe. The main value of these enzymes is their greater sensitivity for this abnormality as compared to serum bilirubin levels alone. GGT is more specific than alkaline phosphatase for this purpose. ). CK is present in high concentration in the cytoplasm of myocytes, is the most widely used enzyme for evaluation of neuromuscular disease and is a 'leakage' enzyme. This enzyme functions by making ATP available for contraction in muscles. This is done by the phosphorylation of ADP from creatine phosphate by catalyzing the reversible phosphorylation of creatine by ATP to form phosphocreatine \u00fe ADP. Phosphocreatine is the major storage form of high energy phosphate in muscle. Lactate dehydrogenase is an enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of lactate to pyruvate. It is not tissue-specific, being found in a variety of tissues, including liver, heart, and skeletal muscle. LDH levels could be elevated by exercise, liver disease, muscle disease, and neoplasia. e) Kidney function (creatine and blood urea nitrogen).",

Urea is excreted by the kidney, intestine, and in saliva, and sweat. Urea 5 The middle layer of the eye is called uvea, which provides most of the blood supply to the retina. Uveitis is swelling and irritation of the uvea and could be caused by autoimmune disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis or ankylosing spondylitis, infection, or exposure to toxins. [Pubmed health (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0002000/).] nitrogen concentrations depend upon hepatic urea production and renal tubular flow rate. Increases in protein catabolism and digestion and decreases in GFR cause an increase in urea nitrogen levels. Urea nitrogen levels are decreased when protein intake is decreased, protein anabolism, increase in excretion, and decrease in production (e.g., liver disease). Muscle metabolism results in the production of creatinine. An energy-storing molecule in muscle called phosphocreatine, undergoes spontaneous cyclization to form creatine and inorganic phosphorous. Creatinine is the result of creatine decomposition. f) Proteins (total protein, albumin, globulin, and A:G ratio). Total protein and albumin are the measured parameters, and globulins and A:G ratio are calculated from them. Quantitative values for the above major proteins are the test results. However, there are many different types of proteins within the globulin fraction besides immune globulins, such as those associated with the acute phase response, and this measurement does not provide information on these fractions. Both quantitative and qualitative data for the different fractions that comprise total protein could be obtained by electrophoresis. Electrophoresis can be used on serum, urine, or body cavity fluid samples (e.g., cerebrospinal fluid). g) Lipids (triglycerides, cholesterol). In serum, triglycerides are incorporated into lipoproteins which are composed of a coat of phospholipid, cholesterol, and proteins (apolipoproteins) enclosing a hydrophobic center of cholesterol esters and triglycerides. The most commonly occurring steroid is cholesterol. Cholesterol is a precursor of cholesterol esters, bile acids, and steroid hormones. It is derived from dietary sources and synthesized in vivo from acetyl-CoA in the liver (main site) and other tissues (intestines, adrenal glands, and reproductive organs).",

This is termed a regenerative response. Detecting immature erythrocytes by virtue of the presence of RNA in the form of ribosomes and rough endoplasmic reticulum in their cytoplasm is required to evaluate the bone marrow response.

This includes the direct introduction of plasmid DNA containing the gene encoding the antigen against which an immune response is sought by incorporating antigens into appropriate host tissues and the in situ production of the target antigen(s). The advantages of this approach over the traditional approaches is that it stimulates both B-and T-cell responses, the vaccine has improved stability, the absence of any infectious agents and the relative ease of large scale manufacture [93] . Vaccines are generally used as biological medicinal products for the prophylaxis of infectious disease, but DNA vaccines are also being developed for therapeutic use (e.g., against infectious disease or other diseases such as cancer). Using genes from a variety of infectious agents, including influenza virus, hepatitis B virus, human immunodeficiency virus, rabies virus, lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus, West Nile virus, malaria and mycoplasma, many scientific publications [93] explore the potential of DNA vaccination and immune responses in animals. For nucleic acid and viral vectorbased vaccines, bio-distribution studies are necessary to determine the tissue distribution following administration and the potential for the vector to integrate into the host genome [93, 94] . The design of nonclinical safety tests should take into consideration the use of the DNA vaccine and the risk/benefit situation. In addition to following GLP requirements for preclinical toxicology studies (see above), DNA studies should also evaluate any local inflammatory response (e.g., myositis), organ specific autoimmunity, immunopathology, and other relevant parameters. In particular, where the encoded antigen is a self-antigen, or may show self-antigen mimicry, a wider range of studies (including auto-antibodies) may be necessary to address the specific concerns [93] .",

The concept of vaccinating dogs against rabies was also discovered by Pasteur [96] . Other examples of animal usage in vaccine research include the use of virus-like particles (VLPs) for immunization against papillomavirus [97] . To control the disease caused by bovine, canine, and rabbit papillomavirus, recombinant papillomavirus VLPs was used [98, 99] . This provided the basis for subsequent licensure of a bivalent and quadravalent HPV vaccine to prevent cervical cancer [100, 101] . It has been confirmed through the development of this vaccine that studies in animals remain relevant to the control of infectious diseases in humans. Animal models in human vaccine development have different applications, such as: Whether the study is intended to study toxicology or measure the efficacy of a new vaccine, selecting the right animal model is critical. For instance, a limited number of hosts including non-human primates, germ-free or barrier raised piglets, germ-free dogs and cats will be colonized by Helicobacter pylori. Investigators prefer working with small animals to larger animals.

As an experimental infection model to evaluate human tuberculosis vaccines, guinea pigs have been used [108] . Guinea pigs are inordinately susceptible to tuberculosis following infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis or M. bovis. While potentially useful when studying pathogenesis, this may limit the value of the guinea pig as a model to study Tb protective immunity.

For study of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic virus (A/California/04/09), specific-pathogen-free (SPF) miniature pigs were used [132] . This model was particularly attractive because of the availability of a number of reagents enabling studies of immune correlates of protection [133] . Highly pathogenic avian viruses did not cause severe clinical signs of disease in pigs [134] . However, highly pathogenic H5N1 viruses did cause disease and death in cats [135, 136] . Thus, cats were considered a good model to test protection against disease and death due to highly pathogenic avian-origin strains. H1N1 virus causes a moderate level of disease in cats when infected intratracheally, replicating primarily in the lungs but can also be isolated from other organs [137] .

The spectrum of disease manifestations observed in human leishmaniasis can be mimicked in the laboratory by infection of different inbred strains of mice with L. major. Including a range of susceptibility states depending on the strain of mouse used, the mouse model reproduces many aspects of human disease. Upon infection, BALB/c mice develop large skin ulcers, which expand and metastasize, leading to death. However, C57BL/6 and CBA/N mice are resistant; they develop small lesions which cure in 10 to 12 weeks, and are resistant to re-infection. Intermediate susceptibility was reported in most other strains of mice [149] . Both susceptible and resistant mice produce Th2 cytokines during the period of active lesion development [150, 151] .

Studies in the mouse model have suggested that vaccine responses may be compromised in these age groups. The development of the murine immune system may not provide an appropriate model for evaluating immune responses in these two age groups. To evaluate vaccine immune responses in the neonate, and to address questions regarding possible interactions between vaccines and maternal antibodies, large animal models may be much more appropriate [172\u00c0174] . However, other than mice, there have been very few investigations of vaccine responses in geriatric animals [175, 176] . For the screening of adjuvants, the horse could provide geriatric populations [177] . An appropriate animal model is also needed for the development of mucosal vaccines. Disease protection against a wide variety of pathogens that invade through mucosal surfaces could be achieved by mucosal vaccination. Difficulties associated with efficient vaccine delivery and weak immune responses following mucosal immunization made the induction of protective immune responses at mucosal surfaces an elusive goal. Thus, for the evaluation of mucosal vaccine delivery technologies, effective and safe mucosal adjuvants, and the characterization of mucosal immune responses, an appropriate animal model is required. In mice, intranasal vaccination may be associated with inhalation and ingestion of vaccine antigens. This makes it difficult to discriminate between intranasal, oral, and intrapulmonary vaccination. However, larger animals like the pig or the cow can be used for the controlled delivery of vaccines to the nasal passages [178, 179] . The nasal passages of these animals more closely resemble that of humans than do those of the mouse. Surgical models have also been useful for screening a variety of mucosal vaccine delivery technologies and potential mucosal adjuvants [180, 181] .",

The greater the similarity in patterns of pathogenesis between the two, the more likely it is that relevant correlates of immune-mediated protection will emanate from the model. The same route of exposure should be used. If the respiratory tract is the pathogens' route of entrance, then the aerosol challenge to expose the pathogen to the defenses of the upper respiratory tract should be used. Intratracheal challenge would not be considered appropriate, because it circumvents the various barriers of the upper respiratory tract. A similar pathogen dose to that which would occur naturally should be used. Use of excessive pathogen challenge, or an unnatural route of infection, might overcome the adaptive immune response. The structure, function, and development of the respiratory tract in the animal model should resemble that of humans when choosing a model for respiratory infections.",

Polio vaccine, rotavirus, adeno or typhoid are examples of orally administered vaccines.

Testing encompasses assessments for identity, purity, safety, and efficacy in terms of antigenicity and potency. Generally, these types of study are aimed at detecting undesirable contaminants or impurities, characterizing the vaccine product, and ensuring conformation to specified manufacturing standards. Unlike toxicity studies, which explore the potential for unanticipated risk, or further refine the understanding of adverse effects, product characterization studies emphasize, quantify, and examine aspects that are associated with the properties of vaccines such as potency and are important to the consistent and safe manufacture of vaccines. In some respects, these studies may be considered to be focused toxicity studies that have restricted or narrow endpoints that include survival or clinical signs. Among the most important are tests for potency, general safety (21CFR610.11), neurovirulence (IABS Scientific Workshop on Neurovirulence Tests for Live Vaccines, WHO, 2005), tumorigenicity (Meeting Report, WHO Study Group on Cell Substrates for Production of Biologicals, WHO, 2007; European Pharmacopoeia section 5.2.3), and pyrogenicity (21CFR610.13).
