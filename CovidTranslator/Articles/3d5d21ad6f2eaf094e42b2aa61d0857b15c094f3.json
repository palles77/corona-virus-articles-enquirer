This approach has met with some success Goldsby, 1983, 1984; Tucker, Dain, Clarke and Donker, 1984; Raybould, Crouch, McDougall and Watts 1985) . However, one problem with such interspecific hybrids (xenohybridomas) is that like other somatic cell hybrids (Weiss and Green, 1967; Pontecorvo, 1971 ) they lose the non-murine chromosomes as they divide so that even if at first they secrete immunoglobulins, they usually soon lose the ability to do so. Preliminary experiments at Babraham, indicated that improved stability could be achieved using murine/bovine xenohybridomas (primary xenohybridomas) themselves as fusion partners. First, these had to be grown in the presence of 8-azaguanine to select for aminopterin sensitivity. They were then used as fusion partners with lymphocytes from immunized calves (Tucker et al 1984; Anderson, Clarke, Stein and Tucker, 1986 ). The resulting secondary xenohybridomas were further selected and used as fusion partners to produce tertiary xenohybridomas.",

The cloned line derived from NSO retained 13% bovine chromosomes and this may be the reason this particular clone was able to maintain antibody secretion for as long as 7 months, before ceasing production.

The latter showed that the failure of primary mouse x human fusions was largely due to a higher death rate of xenohybrids. This was certainly not the case in our studies where primary xenohybridomas often showed just as prolific a growth as mouse x mouse hybridomas. Murphy et al. (1986) , also found that secondary xenohybrids continued to survive although they ceased immunoglobulin synthesis. They therefore concluded that this was 'a step in the right direction' towards production of stable lines secreting human monoclonal antibodies. Another factor in assessing stability of the hybridoma lines is the number of times it is necessary to reclone. Raybould et al (1985) cloned only once whereas Srikumaran et al (1983 Srikumaran et al ( ,1984 carried out three early clonings. In our general experience with xenohybridomas it is advantageous to clone as soon as possible after positive colonies have been identified; subsequent further clonings may be necessary, but this will vary from clone to clone.",

The fact that the pilus preparation used as the immunogen in the present study gave a single band on SDS-PAGE (approximately MW 16.5 K) and gave rise to monoclonal antibodies that inhibited both adhesion and haemagglutination probably indicates that the molecules on the K99 pilus antigen involved in adhesion and haemagglutination are identical or similar.",

In order to compare the efficiency of the different fusion partners in giving rise to positive wells, an arbitrary assessment of the number of positive wells was made by assuming only those wells with O.D. values 25% above the mean O.D. value for the plate were positive. By this criterion, only wells A6, B4 and C2 in Fig. 2 would be considered positive. The values for percentage number of wells with anti-K99 activity given in",

Every fusion gave rise to colonies producing anti-K99 antibodies, the highest number of positive wells was obtained when 94A1 was the fusion partner (22%). In the 94A1 fusions, at 21 days, supernatants from all wells showed anti-Forssman activity. Control ELISA tests confirmed, however, that this antibody did not affect the antifrom wells positive for anti-K99 were picked out into separate wells at 4 weeks post fusion. After culturing for two weeks, 35 lines were still positive in the anti-K99 assay; 26 of these lines were derived from fusions which had used 94A1 as the fusion partner, and one of these showed both anti-Forssman and anti-K99 activity. Five lines with the highest O.D. values were selected for cloning. One line (line A, Table 1) was derived from (NSO), one (line B) from 53B3, one (line C) from 54B3 and two came from 94A1. One of the latter (line D) secreted both anti-Forssman and anti-K99, the other (line E) had lost its anti-Forssman activity.",

The precipitate was collected by centrigation at 48000 x g for 30 min, dialyzed against 0.2 M NaCl and finally concentrated to approximately 25 times the original culture supernatant volume on a macrosolute concentrator (Amicon, Gloucestershire, U.K.). Culture medium was included as a negative control in all tests. The Ig class was determined by immunodiffusion using antisera specific for bovine IgG1, IgG 2 and IgM. Alternatively, Ig molecules were internally labelled by growing 2 x 106 cells in 1.0 ml of lysine-free medium (Gibco Ltd. Middlesex, U.K.) for 16 -20 hr in the presence of 5 ~Ci 14C-lysine monohydrochloride (Radiochemical Centre, Amersham, U.K.). The culture supernatant proteins were then separated by SDS-PAGE electrophoresis, The pilus antigens K88, CFAI, CFAII, 987P and CP (reviewed Parry and Rooke, 1984) were tested in capture-type assays against culture supernatants. Plates were coated with capture antibodies of the appropriate specificity in each instance. 2.10 Antibody binding to K99 + ETEC 1:1 volumes of culture supernatant and a saline suspension of K99 + ETEC were incubated at room temperature (RT\u00b0C) for 30 min. The mixture was spun for 10 min at 3000 g to pellet the K99 + ETEC. The pellet was resuspended and washed 3 times in PBS. An equal volume of FITC-conjugated anti-bovine Ig (Wellcome Research Laboratories, Beckenham, Kent) was added at a dilution of 1 in 40 in PBS for 30 min at RT\u00b0C. The solution was again spun for 10 min at 3000 g and the pellet resuspended and washed 3 times with PBS. Samples were then viewed for fluorescence under U.V. light. Controls in which culture medium or PBS replaced culture supernatant were also included. 2.11 Inhibition of K99 + ETEC adhesion to piglet enterocytes Enterocytes from 12-17 day old piglets, prepared according to the method ofWeiser (1973), were stored in liquid nitrogen until use.
