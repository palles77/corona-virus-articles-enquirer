Looking back, it can be seen that microbes have also changed our history. Were it not for a pathogen that halted an Assyrian military campaign, we might have no Judaism, Christianity, or Islam. Microbes were there to aid adversaries in bringing about the fall of the great Greek and Roman empires. George Washington's bold orders to inoculate the Colonial Army against smallpox (20 years prior to Jenner's discovery of vaccination) were one of the most significant actions in saving the American Revolution from an early and unsuccessful end. Without the yellow fever virus and its accomplice, Aedes aegypti, those living in what was the Louisiana Territory might now have French as their native language. The potato blight caused by Phytophthora infestans changed the histories of both Ireland and those countries (especially the United States) to which victims of the famine emigrated. At the outbreak of World War I, when England was separated from its European source of acetone (needed for the navy's supply of cordite), British citizens had to make do with less gin, but acetone was available thanks to the growth of Clostridium acetobutylicum in those fermentation vessels.",

The disappearance of whole cultures, e.g., native inhabitants of the Americas, is but the most pronounced example of population changes wrought by disease. Microbes have left an imprint on economics, literature, medicine, and virtually every aspect of human society. They caused the abandonment of some religions and the acceptance of others and exposed our prejudices and superstitions (2) (3) (4) . The discussion below provides some examples of events in which disease has actually changed human history.",

Assyria was the largest and most powerful empire of its time and, led by King Sennacherib, its army had conquered much of the Near East. In 701 B.C., Jerusalem was an intended Assyrian conquest (6) . Inscriptions on the walls of Sennacherib's palace at Nineveh, in agreement with histories of the period, proclaim that by the use of ramps, battering rams, mines, and other military techniques, his army had occupied 46 walled cities in the kingdom of Judah. Thus, there is strong reason to believe that had the engagement proceeded as planned, Jerusalem also would have fallen. During the siege, however, a large number of Assyrian soldiers died, and Sennacherib apparently judged that Jerusalem was not worth the price exacted by a lethal illness. In addition, a deteriorating situation in Babylonia required the attention of the Assyrian army (7) , and thus, the siege was ended. Reasons for the mortality included the possibility that the defenders within Jerusalem had somehow prevented the Assyrians from getting access to good water (5) or that food poisoning was responsible (6) , and it was the ingestion of pathogens that exposed them to widespread fatal infections.",

The age was primarily golden for Athenians but much less so for citizens of surrounding states. Pericles, leader of Athens in 444 B.C., embarked on ambitious programs in the arts, literature, and architecture, leading to development of a grand society. At Pericles' direction, however, all construction was within Athens, e.g., the Parthenon and other monuments of the Acropolis. Athenians thus gained the benefit of these works and the jobs they provided, but surrounding states were forced to pay the cost of the projects. This policy ultimately resulted in a revolt by Sparta and other cities of the Peloponnese peninsula, and the Peloponnesian War broke out in 431 B.C.",

Athens' offensive tactics made use of its powerful navy's ability to strike at targets of its choosing. Sparta did ravage the areas around Athens, but according to Pericles' plan, Athenians were safe (at least from military attack) within their walls.",
