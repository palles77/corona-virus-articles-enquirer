            "text": "Genomics is the science of studying genomes of living organisms. The main driver of companies that specialize in genomics is human genome sequencing and most of the technology breakthroughs have been achieved to improve the speed and quality of human genome sequencing and to reduce its cost. Sanger sequencing was used for the 13-year-long Human Genome Project, which resulted in the first whole-genome sequence in 2003 for a budget of $2.7 billion. Five years later, the same result was obtained in 5 months for just $1.5 million (Voelkerding et al., 2009) . The National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) part of the NIH awarded in 2008 more than $20 million in grants (the $1,000 Genome grants) to develop innovative sequencing technologies inexpensive and efficient enough to sequence a person's DNA as a routine part of biomedical research and health care for less than $1000. The 1000 Genomes Project, a China, Germany, UK, and US collaboration, is currently sequencing the whole genome from 2000 individuals worldwide to identify genetic variations (Via et al., 2010) . In the 1990s, microarray technologies have been developed to address mostly needs of human genomics. As of May 2010, 21,520 scientific papers using the Affymetrix (Santa Clara, CA, USA) proprietary microarray technology have been listed on the web site of the company (www.affymetrix.com). Microarrays have also been used for resequencing or gene expression monitoring of infectious agents. New sequencing technologies and instruments, referred to as Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS), have appeared during the last 5 years and interestingly were first used to sequence the whole genome of human pathogens Mycoplasma genitalia (Margulies et al., 2005) and Escherichia coli (Shendure et al., 2005) .",

Scientists will use these data for fundamental research: to annotate all genes, understand genome organization, classify species, and study their evolution. The knowledge of genome organization, combined with functional genomics is the basis to understand pathobiological mechanisms of infectious agents. Among downstream applications are the development of new drugs, vaccines, and diagnostics including the establishment of resistance and escape profiles.

Analysis of differential gene expression is important in hosts and pathogens as well as in vectors of transmissible diseases (mostly insects). Human, plant, or animal cells can be studied when they are confronted to infection to identify the mechanisms targeted by the pathogen and those by which they resist infections. Pathogens' gene expression during infection of the cell is an important area of investigation as it may reveal pathobiological mechanisms and targets for new drugs. Epigenome analysis is the study of chromatin structure and gene regulation by CpG methylation, histone modifications, or DNA\u00c0protein interactions.

A syndrome-based approach (i.e., the detection of multiple pathogens responsible for a disease, such as pneumonia, fever, neurological diseases, diarrhea) may also be useful. Signature sequences can identify infection by a variant with a specific phenotype with given virulence, host specificity, or resistance to treatment and help patient care or epidemiological surveillance. The latter signatures can be entire genes (acquired by horizontal transmission, either plasmid or recombination), individual SNPs, groups of SNPs carried by a unique or different genes, indels, or even modified expression of a gene. A comprehensive assay associating pathogen identification, pathogen typing, identification of virulence, or resistance markers may prove valuable in chronic infections like HIV, hepatitis virus infections, or tuberculosis.",

NGS platforms tend to better detect indels than ABI Sanger platform as they sequence single strands. As expected, ABI Sanger sequencing has an error rate of approximately 7% and careful comparison with NGS reveals false positive and false negative rates of 0.9% and 3.1%. The overall sequencing accuracy of NGS platforms was very high (.99.99%), but the ability to detect variant was 95% for the 454 platform (which has the lowest sensitivity), 100% for the Illumina platform, and 96% for the ABI platform, the last two technologies being less specific.

A nanoporebased device provides single-molecule detection and analytical capabilities that are achieved by electrophoretically driving molecules in solution through a nano-scale pore. The nanopore provides a highly confined space within which single nucleic acid polymers can be analyzed at high throughput by one of a variety of means, and the perfect processivity that can be enforced in a narrow pore ensures that the native order of the nucleobases in a polynucleotide is reflected in the sequence of signals that is detected. Kilobase length polymers (single-stranded genomic DNA or RNA) or small molecules (e.g., nucleosides) can be identified and characterized without amplification or labeling, a unique analytical capability that makes inexpensive, rapid DNA sequencing a possibility. Further research and development to overcome current challenges to nanopore identification of each successive nucleotide in a DNA strand offers the prospect of third-generation instruments that will sequence a diploid mammalian genome for approximately $1000 in approximately 24 h. Oxford Nanopore Technologies (http://www.nanoporetech.com; Oxford, UK), our first generation of DNA-sequencing technology, uses a protein nanopore combined with a processive enzyme, multiplexed on a silicon chip. This elegant and scalable system has unique potential to transform the speed and cost of DNA sequencing. Future generations may interrogate single strands of DNA and may use \"solid-state\" nanopores for further improvements in speed and cost. Lingvitae (http://www.lingvitae.com; Oslo, Sweden) and Eid et al.

Currently, this prototype is able to multiplex 3000 such structures, allowing sequencing of small viral or bacterial genomes with high accuracy.",

Research needs for these technologies are well understood but still represent small (although rapidly growing) markets. The total market of NGS was evaluated to be $484 million in 2008 (http://www.researchandmarkets.com/reportinfo.asp?report_id5614823) and the market of functional genomics was about $2.2 billion in 2007 with an annual growth rate of 18% (http://www.researchandmarkets.com/reportinfo.asp? report_id55545). The real development of sales of companies proposing technologies for genomics will mostly come from diagnostic applications in human or animal health. Genomics research can be translated into molecular diagnostics in the fields of human genetic, oncology, and infectious diseases. Several in vitro diagnostic companies propose instruments and reagents to detect sequence signatures for diagnosis or treatment monitoring applications. However, the current clinical needs mostly require low-complexity genetic information that can be covered by multiplex realtime amplification, reverse hybridization-based line probe assay, low-density microarrays or simple sequencing platforms like the PyroMark Q24 platform. The place of technologies generating more complex datasets in clinical applications is still to be defined. Developing such applications will require clinical validation of the value of complex sequence information and strong efforts for clinician education on its benefit. It will also require that costs of instruments and reagents further decrease and that the technologies become easier to use and more robust. All the major companies cited in this chapter make efforts to simplify equipments and reduce costs per analysis. Affymetrix recently launched a new, more affordable and smaller platform, GeneAtlas, along with a microarray strip format, which enables users to process up to two strips per day or eight strips per week. 454 Life Sciences announced the release of the GS Junior System scaled to suit the needs of individual laboratories for rapid sequencing of amplicons, targeted human resequencing studies, de novo sequencing of microbial and other small genomes, and for pathogen detection. Illumina recently launched the Genome Analyzer IIe with a lower cost, making the technology more accessible to laboratories of various sizes. Similarly, Applied Biosystems announces a less expensive, low-throughput benchtop platform (50 Gb per run) will allow shorter times-to-results. Qiagen (Hilden, Germany) is marketing a relatively simple, low footprint platform (PyroMark Q24) for real-time, sequence-based detection and quantification of sequence variants and epigenetic methylation that uses pyrosequencing technology. The instrument can process 1\u00c024 samples in 15 min. This platform, which is affordable to mid-sized laboratories, allows analysis of CpG methylation, SNPs, insertion/deletions, short tandem repeats (STRs), and variable gene copy number.",
