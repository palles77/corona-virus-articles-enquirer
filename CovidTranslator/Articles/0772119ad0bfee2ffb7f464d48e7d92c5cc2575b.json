Similar to other N-glycosylated proteins, the glycosylation of SARS-CoV E protein occurred co-translationally in the presence of microsomes. The SARS-CoV E protein is predicted to be a double-spanning membrane protein lacking a conventional signal peptide. Both of the transmembrane regions (a.a. 11-33 and 37-59) are predicted to be a-helices, which penetrate into membranes by themselves. As expected, these two transmembrane regions inserted a cytoplasmic protein into the endoplasmic reticulum membrane. Either of these two transmembrane domains co-localized with M protein. Both the transmembrane domains of E protein are required to interact with M protein, while either of the hydrophilic regions (a.a. 1-10 or 60-76) is dispensable as shown by co-immunoprecipitation assay. These results are important for the study of SARS-CoV assembly.",

It plays important roles in virion assembly and morphogenesis, alteration of membrane permeability of host cells, and virus-host cell interactions [14] .

Full-length SARS-CoV E gene fragment was cloned and expressed as a recombinant protein (76 a.a.) with an N-terminal myc tag (16 a.a.) in vitro translated in the reticulocyte lysate (Fig. 1) Cytoplasmic protein insertion into the endoplasmic reticulum membrane SARS-CoV E protein targets the ER membrane though it lacks of a conventional signal peptide [24] . There are two predicted transmembrane domains in the SARS-CoV E protein: a.a. 11-33 and a.a. 37-59 (Supplemental Fig. 1A) . Both of these two transmembrane regions are predicted to be a-helices [25] (Supplemental Fig. 1A) . In order to determine which transmembrane domain is responsible for the integration of SARS-CoV E protein into the ER, each of these two transmembrane domains (Supplemental Fig. 2 ) was linked with a cytoplasmic protein (a.a. 1-115 of hepatitis-C-virus core protein) and the fusion protein was expressed in Vero E6 cells. Co-localization of these recombinant proteins within the ER was demonstrated by confocal microscopy (Fig. 2) . The average R values of pDsRed-ER ? C115, pDsRed-ER ? CE11-33, and pDsRed-ER ? CM37-59 were 0.3379 \u00b1 0.0723, Fig. 1 SARS-CoV E protein was translated in vitro in reticulocyte lysate. Lane 1, only the plasmid expressing SARS-CoV E protein was added; Lane 2, microsomes and the plasmid expressing SARS-CoV E protein were added together in the lysate. Lane 3, after the translation of SARS-CoV E protein, CaCl 2 was added to stop the translation reaction and then, the microsomes were added. After the reaction, the immunoprecipitation assay using anti-myc antibody was performed to remove hemoglobin protein before SDS-PAGE Fig. 2 Subcellular localization of the recombinant fusion proteins C-E11-33-V5 and C-E37-59-V5. The dsRED-ER plasmid was used to define the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (red color), while DAPI was used to mark the localization of the nucleus (blue color). The recombinant fusion proteins, C115-V5, C-E11-33-V5, and C-E37-59-V5 were stained with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated antibody (green color).

E protein without the first transmembrane domain (ED11-33) is a labile protein (Fig. 4) , though it was detected by confocal microscopy in a limited number of cells (Fig. 3) . Both of the E protein deletion mutants containing the two transmembrane domains (E11-76, E1-59) were pulled down by M protein using the co-immunoprecipitation assay (Fig. 5a) . However, E protein without the second transmembrane domain (ED37-59) was not pulleddown by M protein using co-immunoprecipitation assay (Fig. 5b) . Moreover, the second transmembrane domain of E protein alone was not pulled down by M protein using co-immunoprecipitation assay (Fig. 5c) .

            "text": "In this study, the SARS-CoV E gene fragment was cloned and expressed as a recombinant protein fused with a myc tag at the N-terminus in vitro and in Vero E6 cells (Figs. 1, 4) . The SARS-CoV E protein forms homodimers and homotrimers under nonreducing conditions in E. coli [17] . The transmembrane domain (a.a. 9-35) of SARS-CoV E protein forms SDS-resistant dimers, trimers, and pentamers [26] . The protein (about 18 kDa) that we detected was unglycosylated monomeric E protein with an unusual mobility on SDS-PAGE. This protein should not be a dimer since the glycosylated E protein is 4 kDa, but not 8 kDa larger than the unglycosylated form (Figs. 1, 4) . Furthermore, the mobility of various E protein deletion mutants on the gel supports this argument (Fig. 4) . Two unidentified protein bands (marked by dotted arrows in Fig. 4 ) greater than 30 kDa may not be the oligomeric form of this protein since they migrate similarly between the wild type and the deletion mutants of E protein (Fig. 4) . These two bands are probably two unidentified cellular proteins interacting with E protein so extensively that they are resistant to treatments of SDS and boiling. Similar to other N-glycosylated proteins [27] , the glycosylation of SARS-CoV E protein occurred co-translationally but not post-translationally (Fig. 1) . The E protein of SARS-CoV is a double-spanning membrane protein [24] . Which of these two hydrophobic domains in the SARS-CoV E protein contains the insertion and anchoring signals for ER-integration is not known. Both of these two transmembrane regions (a.a. 11-33 and 37-59) are predicted to be a-helices, which penetrate into the membrane by themselves (supplemental 16) . Cell lysates were directly analyzed by Western blotting (lanes [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] or immunoprecipitated with the anti-V5 antibody prior to Western blotting (lanes 9-16). c Vero E6 cells were transfected with the vector alone (lanes 1 and 7) , the plasmid encoding myc-M (lanes 2 and 8), C115 (lanes 3 and 9), C-E37-59 (lanes 4 and 10), or co-transfected with the plasmids encoding myc-M and C115 (lanes 5 and 11), myc-M and C-E37-59 (lanes 6 and 12). Cell lysates were directly analyzed by Western blotting (lanes 1-6) or immunoprecipitated with the anti-myc antibody prior to Western blotting (lanes 7-12) Fig. 1A) . However, in another report, SARS-CoV E protein was predicted to have only one putative transmembrane a-helical hydrophobic domain (corresponding to the first transmembrane domain, a.a. 11-33, mentioned in our study) which is responsible for the membrane permeabilizing activity of this protein [16] . In order to determine which transmembrane domain is responsible for the integration of SARS-CoV E protein into the ER, each of these two transmembrane domains was linked with a.a. 1-115 of hepatitis C virus core protein which localizes in the cytoplasm [12] . Both of the single transmembrane regions were able to insert a cytoplasmic protein into the ER membrane (Fig. 2) . These results suggest that either of the transmembrane regions is able to target SARS-CoV E protein into ER. Thus, there exists the second transmembrane region (a.a. 37-59) in the SARS-CoV E protein though this region is less hydrophobic than the first transmembrane region (a.a. 1-33) (supplemental Fig. 1B) . Whether the second transmembrane region performs as the first one does in oligomer formation [26] and membrane permeabilization [16] needs further investigation. Figures 1 and 2 also imply that a nascent peptide of SARS-CoV E protein after the synthesis of the first or second transmembrane domains could integrate the peptide into the ER membrane, after which glycosylation occurs.",
