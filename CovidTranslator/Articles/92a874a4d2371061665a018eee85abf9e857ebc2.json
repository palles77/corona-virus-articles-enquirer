Changes of plasma protein profiles can reflect physiological or pathological conditions associated with many human diseases, making blood the most important fluid for clinical diagnostics2-4. Nevertheless, only a handful of plasma proteins are utilized in routine clinical tests. This is due to a host of reasons, including the intrinsic complexity of the plasma proteome1, the heterogeneity of human diseases and the fast kinetics associated with protein degradation in sampled blood5. Simple technologies that can sensitively sample large numbers of proteins over broad concentration ranges, from small amounts of blood, and within minutes of sample collection, would assist in solving these problems. Herein, we report on an integrated microfluidic system, called the Integrated Blood Barcode Chip (IBBC). It enables on-chip blood separation and the rapid measurement of a panel of plasma proteins from small quantities of blood samples including a fingerprick of whole blood. This platform holds potential for inexpensive, non-invasive, and informative clinical diagnoses, particularly, for point-of-care.",

The IBBC described herein was developed to rapidly assay a large panel of protein biomarkers in situ, starting from a fingerprick of whole blood. The immunoassay region of the chip is a microscopic barcode, integrated into a microfluidics channel, and customized for the detection of many proteins and/or for the quantitation of a single or few proteins over a broad concentration range. The versatility of this barcode immunoassay is demonstrated by detecting human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) from human serum over a 10 5 concentration range, and by stratifying 22 cancer patients via multiple measurements of a dozen blood protein biomarkers for each patient. Finally the IBBC is utilized to assay a blood protein biomarker panel from whole human blood, with all key steps in the immunoassay executed within 10 minutes of finger-prick blood collection.",

            "text": "The IBBC was designed for the rapid execution of two sequential tasks: plasma separation from whole blood, and implementation of a multi-parameter protein assay. We first present an overview of the IBBC, and then discuss, sequentially, the ability to control the assay sensitivity, the extension of a single protein assay to an assay for a large panel of biomarkers, and, finally, the integration of plasma separation from whole blood, followed by the rapid measurement of a panel of protein biomarkers. Fig. 1 shows the design of an IBBC for blood separation and in situ protein measurement. A polydimethylsiloxane(PDMS)-onglass chip was designed for 8-12 separate multi-protein assays to be executed sequentially, or in parallel, starting from whole blood. The plasma separation was achieved by exploiting the Zweifach-Fung effect of highly polarized blood cell flow at branch points of small blood vessels14-16. We utilized this hydrodynamic effect by flowing blood through a low-flowresistance primary channel that has high-resistance, centimeter-long channels branching off perpendicularly (Fig 1a) . As the resistance ratio is increased between the branches and the primary channel, a critical streamline moves closer to the primary channel wall adjoining the branch channels. Blood cells with a radius larger than the distance between this critical streamline and the primary channel wall are directed away from the high-resistance channels, and \u223c15% of the plasma is skimmed into the high-resistance channels. The remaining whole blood is directed towards a waste outlet. This component was re-designed from a previous report14. The glass base of the plasma-skimming channels is pre-patterned, prior to the microfluidics chip assembly, with a dense barcode-like array of ssDNA oligomers. A full barcode is repeated multiple times within a single plasma-skimming channel, and each barcode sequence constitutes a complete assay.",

            "text": "To detect proteins within the plasma-skimming channels, the DNA-encoded antibody library (DEAL) technique is employed to convert the pre-patterned ssDNA barcode microarray into an antibody microarray17. DNA-directed immobilization of antibodies provides a powerful means for spatial encoding18, 19 . The sequences of all ssDNA oligomer pairs used (labeled A/A'-M/M'), and their corresponding antibodies, are listed in the Supplementary Table 1 and 2. To minimize cross-reactivity, these ssDNA molecules were designed in silico and then validated through a full orthogonality test. In that experiment, each of the complementary DNA molecules with Cy3 fluorescent label was added to a microwell containing a full primary ssDNA barcode array. The results showed only negligible cross-hybridization signals (see Supplementary Fig. S7 on line). In the DEAL assay, each capture antibody is tagged with \u223c3 copies of a single-stranded (ss)DNA oligomer that is complementary to ssDNA' oligomers that have been surface-patterned into a microscopic barcode within the immunoassay region of the chip. Flow-through of the DNA-antibody conjugates transforms the DNA microarray into an antibody microarray for the subsequent surface-bound immunoassay. Because DNA patterns are robust to dehydration and can survive elevated temperatures (80-100\u00b0C), the DEAL approach circumvents the denaturation of antibodies that can occur under typical microfluidics fabrication conditions. A finger prick of blood represents only a few microliters of liquid, implying that the on-chip plasma separation process yields a few hundred nanoliters of plasma volume. To measure a large panel of protein biomarkers from this small volume, the ssDNA barcodes were patterned at a high density using microchannel-guided flow patterning (Supplementary \u00a7S.3 on line). The entire ssDNA bar code was patterned using a single polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) mold that was thermally bonded onto a poly-amine coated glass slide. Polyaminated surfaces permit significantly higher DNA loading than do more traditional aminated surfaces20, and provide for an accompanying increase in assay sensitivity (see Supplementary Fig.S4 online). Different solutions, each containing a specific ssDNA oligomer, were flowed through different channels, and evaporated through the gaspermeable PDMS stamp, resulting in individual stripes of DNA molecules. One complete set of stripes represents one barcode. All measurements utilized 20 \u03bcm wide bars spaced at 40 \u03bcm pitch. This array density represents a \u223c10-fold increase over a typical spotted array (150 \u03bcm spot diameters at 400 \u03bcm pitch), thus expanding the numbers of proteins that can be measured within a small volume. No alignment between the barcode array and the plasma channels was required. All protein assays utilized one color fluorophore, and were spatially identified using a reference marker that fluoresced at a different color.",

            "text": "We first illustrate aspects of the barcode assays via the measurement of a single biomarker, human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), in un-diluted human serum over a broad concentration range. hCG is widely used for pregnancy testing, and is a biomarker for gestational trophoblastic tumors and germ cell cancers of the ovaries and testes. For this assay, the barcode was customized by varying the DNA loading during the flow patterning step. The DNA barcode contained 13 regions (Fig. 2a ). There were two bars of oligomer B, designed to detect the protein TNF\u03b1 as a negative control. There was also one reference bar (oligomer M), one blank, and nine bars of oligomer A designed for hCG detection, flow patterned at ssDNA concentrations from 200\u03bcM to 2\u03bcM. To perform the assay, a mixture of A'-anti-hCG and B'-TNF-\u03b1 was flowed through assay channels. Next, a series of standard hCG serum samples and two hCG samples of unknown concentration (provided by the National Cancer Institute) were flowed through separate assay channels. Biotinylated detection antibodies for hCG and TNF\u03b1 were then applied, followed by a final developing step using fluorescent Cy5-labeled straptavidin (red) for all protein channels, and Cy3labelled M' oligomers (green) for the reference channel (Fig. 2a) . By quantitating the fluorescence intensity ( Fig. 2b and c) , a sensitivity (\u223c1mIU/mL) comparable to the Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assays(ELISAs) over a broad detected concentration range (\u223c10 5 ), was demonstrated. Using the DEAL barcode in a blind test, we measured the hCG levels in the two unknown serum samples. Our measured levels, estimated at 6 and 400mIU/mL for unknowns 1 and 2, are in good agreement with the values of 12 and 357 mIU/mL, respectively, obtained from an independent lab test (Labcorp, see Supplementary Fig. S5 online). Even without quantitation, the analyte concentrations can be estimated by eye through pattern-recognition of the full barcode. The bar with the highest DNA-loading rendered the highest sensitivity, whereas the bar with lowest DNA-loading was used to discriminate samples with high analyte concentrations. For example, the 25000mIU/mL and 250mIU/mL hCG samples can be visually distinguished using stripes patterned with lower DNA concentrations, whereas the stripes loaded with 200\u03bcM DNA look quite similar. For circumstances in which accurate photon counting is not available, visual barcode inspection permits a rough estimation of the target quantity -a potential point-of-care application. The level of hCG is tracked during pregnancy, with concentrations in the blood increasing from \u223c5mIU/mL in the first week of pregnancy to \u223c2\u00d710 5 mIU/mL in ten weeks. The IBBC can cover such a broad physiological hCG range with reasonable accuracy.",

To evaluate the multiplexed assay, the cross-reactivity between the stripes within the DNA encoded immunoassays was quantitated. This test involved twelve human serum proteins, including ten cytokines (IFN-\u03b3, TNF-\u03b1, IL2, IL1\u03b1, IL1\u03b2, TGF-\u03b21, IL6, IL10, IL12, GMCSF), a chemokine (MCP-1) and a cancer biomarker (prostate specific antigen, PSA). The results showed a negligible cross-talk, with typical photon counts under 2% compared to the correctly paired antigen-antibody complexes(see Supplementary Fig. S8 on line). We also carried out assays on serial dilutions (from 5nM to 1pM) for these proteins on the DEAL barcode chip to establish a set of calibration curves for future estimates of protein concentration in sera. We fixed all the parameters associated with laser scanning and fluorescence quantification, i.e. power, gain, brightness, contrast, etc., and performed quantitative analysis as shown in Supplementary Fig. 9b online. The estimated sensitivity varies substantially depending upon the antibodies used, from <1pM for IL-1\u03b2 and IL-12, to \u223c30pM for TGF-\u03b2, and are comparable to the detection limits of ELISAs based on the same antibody pairs. For example, according to the specifications (eBioscience), the detection limit is \u223c8pg/mL, or 0.5pM for cytokines like TNF-\u03b1 and IL1\u03b2, which is comparable to our observations. The statistical variation of the measured signals, however, is relatively large compared to a commercial ELISA assay -a variation that likely arises from our manual chip manufacturing processes.",

The fluid loading was conducted using a Tygon\u00ae plastic tubing that is interfaced to the IBBC inlet with a 23 gauge metal pin. The Fluidigm\u00ae solenoid unit was exploited to control the pressure on/off for both control valves and flow channels. A pressure of 8-10 psi was applied to actuate the valves, whereas the loading of fluid into assay channels was carried out with a lower pressure (0.5-3psi) depending on the channel flow resistance and the desired flow rate. Then DNA-antibody conjugates (\u223c50-100nM) were flowed through the plasma assay channels for \u223c30-45min. This step transformed the DNA arrays into capture-antibody arrays.

Optical gains are 800 and 700 for 635nm and 532nm, respectively. The brightness and contrast were set at 87 and 88. The output JPEG images were carefully skewed and resized to fit the standard mask design of barcode array. Then, an image processing software, NIH imageJ, was employed to produce intensity line profiles of barcodes in all assay channels. Finally, all the line profile data files were loaded into home-developed program embedded as an excel macro to generate a spread sheet that lists the average intensities of all 13 bars in each of 20 barcodes. The means and standard divisions were computed using the Microcal origin. Non-supervised clustering of patients was performed using the software Cluster and the heat map was generated from the software Treeview, both developed by the M. Eisen's group. To assess the significance of two patient (sub)groups, student t analysis was performed on selected proteins and all pvalues were calculated at significance level of 0.05 if not specified.
