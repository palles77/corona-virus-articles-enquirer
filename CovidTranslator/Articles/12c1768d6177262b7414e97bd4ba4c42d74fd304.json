These infections do not occur at random: each group of viruses has its own typical host range and cell preference (called tropism). Viruses can be transmitted in different ways, for example by droplets generated when an infected person coughs, by contamination with stool samples from a person infected with an intestinal virus, by sexual intercourse, by contact with blood from infected persons with bloodborne viruses, by contact with infected animals with zoonotic viruses, or by vectors, such as mosquitoes or ticks for arthropod-borne (arbo-) viruses. Clearly the most relevant in foodborne infections are those viruses that infect the cells lining the intestinal tract and are dispersed by shedding into the stool or through emesis (Table 1) .

In much of the developing world, where HAV infection is endemic, the majority of persons are infected in early childhood and virtually all adults are immune. In these areas, HAV transmission is primarily from person to person. Outbreaks are rare because most infections occur among young children who generally remain asymptomatic. In the developed countries, however, HAV infections become less common as a result of increased standards of living. Very few persons are infected in early childhood, and the majority of adults remain susceptible to infection by HAV. Because virus shedding starts 10 -14 days before the onset of symptoms, there is a clear window for spreading the virus.

            "text": "Infection with gastroenteritis viruses is usually diagnosed by the detection of the pathogen in stool samples from sick people, rather than by measuring the antibody response in serum (Tables 2 and 3) . Historically, viruses were diagnosed by scanning a stool suspension under an electron microscope (EM) . This assay still remains the gold standard for virus diagnosis but is rather insensitive and labour-intensive (Table 2) . Routine ELISA assays are available for detection of group A rotaviruses, adenoviruses, and astroviruses, as well as for some of the NoV (Tables 2 and 3 ). For non-group A rotaviruses, Sapoviruses (SaV), and the remaining NoVs, the diagnosis can be made by detection of viral nucleic acid using reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays. A problem with NoV is the variability of the viral genome, making it difficult to develop a single generic detection test. For the hepatitis viruses, detection of specific IgM antibodies is diagnostic of recent infection. In addition, viruses can be detected in stool and in serum by RT-PCR, but this is not done routinely. There are great Virus detection in food or water has been problematic, even after the introduction of RT-PCR. Because the most important foodborne viruses do not grow (readily) in cell culture, they must be detected directly in food extracts, with all the problems of standardisation, inhibition of enzymes used in the RT-PCR, falsepositive tests, etc. (Lees, 2000; . Because contamination is often caused by foodhandlers, the level of contamination with virus may vary greatly within a product. The combination of variable virus counts and the lack of a culture system is the main reason why virtually no information is available on the variability of test results from sampling or what would be considered representative samples for monitoring purposes. Furthermore, (molecular) diagnostic methods for food or water are not routinely available in food microbiology laboratories (Table 3) .

In addition, no simple animal models are available for experimental studies of virus inactivation. Thus, detection methods currently rely on genome detection by molecular detection techniques such as RT-PCR. A positive signal indicates an intact segment of viral genomic RNA. This does not provide information on virus infectivity. Completely inactivated particles that pose no threat to public health may still contain intact RNA, thus resulting in a positive virus assay. The RNA will eventually be degraded, but it is unknown how long this will take in different environments. In shellfish, inactivation of the virus was followed by rapid degradation ( < 1 min) of viral RNA (Slomka and Appleton, 1998) .",

For HAV, a cell-cultureadapted variant has been used, for example in studies addressing heat resistance in different food items (Bidawid et al., 2000a) . For NoV, structurally similar viruses are the enteroviruses, HAV, and astroviruses. These are all viruses with a single-stranded RNA genome and are approximately 7-kb long, approximately 30 nm in size, and similar in capsid structure (no envelope) (Fig. 1 ). Slomka and Appleton (1998) recommended the use of an animal calicivirus (FeCV) for inactivation studies and found that FeCV was clearly less stable than HAV. Because most infectivity and inactivation data are available for the enteroviruses and HAV, we have used these data for our risk estimates (Table 4 ). It should be clear, however, that these remain estimates and will have to be evaluated carefully.",

It is clear from numerous outbreaks that the presence of ''traditional'' bacterial indicators of faecal contamination does not consistently correlate with the presence of pathogenic viruses. Many groups have proposed the use of bacteriophages as indicators. Bacteriophages are viruses that infect and replicate in bacteria. They are present in substantial numbers in human stool samples and, in some respects, are similar to viruses pathogenic to humans. Because of similarities in structure, behaviour, and stability, bacteriophages may be of use in assessing cumulative exposure to human faecal waste. However, care must be taken not to provide a false sense of safety by measuring the presence of bacteriophages only. The observed clear differences in stability of different human pathogenic viruses (described later in this document) that reside in the intestine illustrate that extrapolation of data from one virus to another cannot be relied upon (Slomka and Appleton, 1998) . Similarly, the possible use of phages as surrogates in evaluating the antiviral effectiveness of processes needs to be carefully validated (Mariam and Cliver, 2000a) .",

For example, rotaviruses in aerosols (generated while vomiting and thought to play a role in the transmission of those viruses) were found to survive in the air up to 9 days at 20 jC (Sattar et al., 1984) . Viruses also may persist for extended periods (1 -60 days for 100-fold reduction in infectivity) on several types of materials commonly found in institutions and domestic environments (e.g. paper, cotton cloth, aluminium, china, glazed tile, latex, and polystyrene; Abad et al., 1997) (Fig. 3 ). Adenoviruses were found to survive for up to 35 days Represented are the number of days after which the virus recovery will be less than 1% (A and B) or 10% (C) of the original contamination. (Data from: Enriquez et al., 1995; Kurdziel et al., 2001; Mbithi et al., 1991; Ward and Irving, 1987) . on a plastic surface in an environment with low relative humidity (Nauheim et al., 1990) . This relation with humidity varies among viruses. A high relative humidity favours the survival of enteroviruses, whereas a low relative humidity favours survival of HAV and human rotavirus (HRV) (Mbithi et al., 1991; Sattar et al., 1986 Sattar et al., , 1988 . Furthermore, HAV remained infectious in dried faeces for 30 days when stored at 25 jC and 42% relative humidity (Hollinger and Ticehurst, 1996) . This stresses the need for virusspecific studies to address virus inactivation. Finally, in artificially contaminated water, viruses may survive for prolonged periods of time, with over 1-year survival of poliovirus and rotavirus in mineral water at 4 jC (Biziagos et al., 1988) . Recent data published by Beuret et al. (2000) on traces of NoV RNA found in bottled water may tend to support this statement. However, as yet, no one has been able to confirm these data.",

Numerous studies have addressed the stability of viruses under different circumstances (see Table 4 ), but little was done to standardise these studies. An overall conclusion is that HAV and HRV are more resistant to inactivation than enteric adenovirus and poliovirus, but it must be noted that significant differences in survival rates were found for different environmental and substrate conditions.

Based on these assumptions, we have tried to estimate the likelihood of survival of the most important foodborne viruses for commonly used food processing methods if foods are contaminated before processing. With the exception of ultrahigh temperature treatment, no methods would completely inactivate more than 3 log 10 of virus, and we estimate that with foods contaminated after processing, viruses will remain active to a significant extent and thus pose a possible risk factor (Fig. 3, Table 4) . Therefore, the emphasis should be strongly on prevention of contamination before or during processing by proper deployment of GHP, GMP, and HACCP. Clearly, the likelihood of virus contamination in primary products will differ for different commodities and is the highest for shellfish and manually handled fruits. For foods contaminated after processing, our estimate is that viruses will remain active in most foods (Fig. 3, Table 4 ).",

They must be made aware that specific personal hygiene must be ensured. Increasing the awareness of all foodhandlers about transmission of enteric viruses (including the spread of viruses by vomiting) is needed, with special emphasis on the risk of ''silent'' transmission by asymptomatically infected persons and via those who continue to shed virus after recovery from illness.

The features of this method would include similar inoculum size, sample size, sampling time, and statistical analysis. A project to develop such a method and apply it in various environments would provide useful data. Efforts to find a cell culture system that will allow propagation of NoV are vital.

Preliminary results from studies there suggest that NoVs may also cause a significant number of these outbreaks. Based on studies from the UK and the US, it has been estimated that a substantial proportion of foodborne infections may be caused by NoVs (67% estimated for the US by Mead et al., 1999) . In addition to outbreaks, NoVs also cause numerous sporadic cases of gastroenteritis. Five percent of patients with gastroenteritis who consult a physician have NoV infection, compared with 4% for Salmonella.

Given the highly infectious nature of NoV and the documented risk of virus transmission to food during the incubation period, it is suggested that guidelines be developed that include the occurrence of gastroenteritis in contacts (e.g. children) of people working at critical points in the food chain.
