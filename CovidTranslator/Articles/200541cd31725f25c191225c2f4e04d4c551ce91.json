The expression of this genomic information of SARS-CoV involves synthesis of a nested set of subgenomic RNAs (sgRNAs). In this study, we showed that the translational levels of 10 SARS-CoV sgRNAs including the two low-abundance sgRNAs 2-1 and 3-1 varied considerably in translation reporter assays. We also demonstrated that the initiator AUG codon of sgRNA-8 was silent and the repressive control was most likely positioned in the upstream untranslated region (UTR) of sgRNA-8. The initiator AUG codons of most sgRNAs are in poor Kozak contexts and the translation of truncated proteins from downstream AUG codons by leaky scanning was common in our experimental settings. No significant correlation was found between complexity of 5 0 -UTR and the sequence context of AUG codon with the level of translation of SARS-CoV sgRNAs. These results will be helpful for further studies to reveal the biological functions and translation regulatory mechanisms of sgRNAs in the coronavirus life cycle and pathogenesis.",

The genome of coronaviruses is polycistronic and possesses a 5 0 -cap structure and a 3 0 -poly (A) tail [1] . At the 5 0 -end, the two large open reading frames (ORFs) (1a and 1b) comprise about two-thirds of the entire coronaviruses genome, which encode the viral replicase and are translated directly from the genomic RNA [2] . Besides four essential structural proteins spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N), the 3 0 -one-third of the genome comprises variable number of group-specific genes, which are expressed through a set of nested 3 0 -coterminal subgenomic RNAs (sgRNAs) (Fig. 1a) . A key feature of these sgRNAs is that their 5 0 -and 3 0 -terminal sequences are identical to those of the genome. This nested set structure results from a fusion of the sequence representing the genomic 5 0 -end (leader sequence) and sequences representing different 3 0 -regions of the genome, the so-called mRNA bodies (body sequences). Though the 5 0 -end of genome greatly affects coronavirus discontinuous transcription to produce sgRNAs [3] , the regulatory mechanism of coronavirus gene expression is not well understood.",

Elucidation of the regulatory mechanism in the translation is important for understanding the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV; however, it is hard to compare the differential translation of sgRNAs because the steady-state level of viral proteins in infected cells reflects the sum of transcription, translation, and the relative stabilities of these transcriptional and translational products. In this study, we adopted the reporter gene system by fusing with partial sgRNA ORF of similar size under the control of the same promoter. This system was supposed to specifically address and compare the translation efficiency of individual sgRNAs by circumventing the problem resulted from different transcription efficiency and protein stability. We cloned the 5 0 -ends containing a full leader sequence and the 5 0 -200-400 nt of the body sequence of all 10 sgRNAs into the pEGFP-N1 vector (Fig. 1) . The predicted start codon AUG of each ORF was cloned in-frame with the GFP gene and the start codon of GFP was replaced with GUG. Strong fluorescence was observed in cells transfected with fusion constructs p2/S, p2-1, p3/3a, p5/M, p6, p4/E, and p9/N, whereas relatively weak fluorescence was observed in cells transfected with fusion constructs p3-1, p7/7a, and p8 (Fig. 3a) . Expressions of GFP-fusion proteins of expected sizes were detected in cells transfected with plasmids p2-1, p3/3a, p3-1, p4/E, p5/M, p6, p7/7a, and p9/N (Fig. 3b) . The major protein band of sgRNA 2-GFP fusion construct (Fig. 3b) was larger than theoretically calculated size (Table 2 ). This discrepancy could be due to the post-translational modification of protein or not fully denatured protein complex. One minor band below the major band may represent the correct fusion translation product (Fig. 3b) . On the other hand, protein bands with smaller sizes were detected in cells transfected with constructs of p3/3a, p4/E, and p5/M, which might result from leaky expression from downstream AUG codons, premature termination or degradation product by cellular proteinases (Fig. 3b) .",

Our data showed that leaky scanning, which leads to translation from downstream AUG codon, may be common for coronavirus RNAs. Messenger RNAs in which the first AUG codon lacks the preferred nucleotide at both of the key positions (-3, ?4) in the Kozak context have the special property of initiating translation at the first and downstream AUG codons, thereby producing two or more proteins from one mRNA.

As shown above, we were unable to detect the protein expression of sgRNA 8 with the 5 0 viral leader sequence, which corroborated with a recent report on ORF8 expression [13] . Cells transfected with p8 displayed significant fluorescence (Figs. 3a, 5a) , but the expression of fusion protein could not be detected in western blot (Fig. 5b) . To investigate a possible role of the sgRNA8 5 0 -UTR in translation, the 5 0 -UTR of sgRNA 8 was replaced by the 5 0 -UTR of sgRNA 5 to create the plasmid p8/5 because the initiator AUG codon of sgRNA 5 was shown to be functional (Fig. 3b) , and the length and the secondary structure of both 5 0 -UTRs were predicted to be similar to sgRNA 8 5 0 -UTR. Interestingly, the replacement of the 5 0 -UTR resulted in the translation of fusion protein from initiator AUG codon of ORF 8b. As expected, when the 5 0 -UTR of sgRNA 5 was replaced by the 5 0 -UTR of sgRNA 8 to create the plasmid p5/8, the expression of p5/8 could not be detected (Fig. 5b) . We speculated that a small ORF (8a), which is present in the 5 0 -UTR of sgRNA 8, might play a role in translational suppression from downstream initiator AUG codon of ORF 8b. To study any possible role of upstream ORF in translation suppression, the GFP was fused with ORF 8a to create the plasmid p8a but no fusion protein was detected in cells transfected with this recombinant plasmid (Fig. 5b) . This shows that translational suppression from the initiator AUG codon of ORF 8b was not the result of the expression of 8a but could be due to other cis-acting elements present in the 5 0 -UTR region. Taken together, these data indicate that the 5 0 -UTR may act as a suppression regulatory element that led to the inhibition of expression of both ORF 8a and 8b in sgRNA 8.",

            "text": "As the expression levels of SARS-CoV sgRNAs were significantly different, we determined whether the sequence context around the start codon AUG (Kozak sequence) plays an important role in the translation of sgRNAs. The optimal context for initiation of translation in vertebrate mRNAs is ACCAUGG [14, 15] . In this consensus motif, two nucleotides at the highly conserved positions (a G residue following the AUG codon (position ?4) and a purine, preferably A, three nucleotides upstream AUG condon (position -3)) exert the strongest effect. Sequence analysis revealed that AUG codons of sgRNAs 2-1, 5/M and 8 are in better Kozak context (Table 2) . They have only one nucleotide mismatch with the consensus sequence motif ACCAUGG. A pyrimidine (C) is present at position -3 in sgRNA 2-1, whereas a mismatch at position -2 and -1 is present in sgRNA 5 and 8 respectively (Table 2) . However, sgRNA 8 has a low-translation efficiency as shown above. The sequence surrounding the AUG initiator codon of sgRNAs 2 and 7 has two nucleotides mismatch with consensus Kozak sequence, and notably they are lacking a guanine (G) at position ?4. The sgRNAs 3, 3-1, 4, 6 and 9 possess poor Kozak sequence context for translation initiation (Table 2 ) but most could be translated efficiently (Fig. 3b) . Taken together, no significant correlation was found between the Kozak context around AUG initiator codon of sgRNAs and the translational level of the fusion proteins. The length of 5 0 -UTR, the G ? C content, and the secondary structure near the 5 0 -end of an mRNA can drastically affect the translational level of mRNAs [22] [23] [24] [25] . The ORF 8a and 8b were fused in-frame with GFP open reading frame in pEGFP-N1 vector. p8: sgRNA8 ORF8b fused with GFP; p8/5: the 5 0 -UTR of sgRNA 8 was replaced with that of sgRNA 5; p5/8: the 5 0 -UTR of sgRNA 5 with that of sgRNA 8; p8a: ORF 8a fused with GFP; GFP: pEGFP-N1 as control; mock: non-transfected cells We next analyzed whether the properties of the 5 0 -UTR could influence the translation efficiency of sgRNAs. All SARS-CoV sgRNAs contain the same leader sequence but the 5 0 -UTR lengths are variable, ranging from 72 nt to 265 nt (Table 2) . We calculated the G ? C contents of different sgRNA 5 0 -UTRs and analysed the secondary structures and the free energy (DG) of the major loops of sgRNA 5 0 -UTRs (Table 2) . Surprisingly, no significant correlation was found between the length, the G ? C content, the secondary structure of 5 0 -UTR, and the translational level of reporter gene (Table 2 ).",

Therefore, further studies are required to determine the relationship between the level of transcription, translation, and relative abundance of protein in cells which were infected by SARS-CoV. At the translational step, our data showed that translation from the downstream initiator codon by leaky scanning was common to SARS-CoV sgRNAs and this could lead to synthesis of truncated viral protein products (if the downstream AUG is in the same reading frame) or altered proteins, which may act as decoys to fool immune system and favor viral replication.",
