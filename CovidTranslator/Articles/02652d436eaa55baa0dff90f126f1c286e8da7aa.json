Under the influence of Confucianism, individuals are viewed as embedded in the family and society (Cong, 2004; Fan & Li, 2004; Tsai, 2005) . Thus, patients implicitly trust their HCPs as individuals acting on the basis of familial and social mores. Unlike in Western countries, in China infectious diseases such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), HIV/AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases are treated in specialist hospitals at the national level.",

Although the prevalence of infection remains low (0.04-0.07%), the new figure represents an 8% increase since 2006 (Wu et al., 2007a) .

A major component of China's HIV plan includes expanding access to treatment with antiretroviral therapy (ART) (Wu et al., 2007b) .",

Currently, health care has changed to a fee-for-service system, in which health insurance is not longer provided (Zhou, 2009 ); however, bureaucratic control still remains in the administrative system, which is divided into levels of the nation, province, city, county, township and village .",

Basic HIV/AIDS knowledge has not been widely dispersed among HCPs at all levels of the system beyond the specialist infectious disease hospitals; thus people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) are often unable to access appropriate treatment or other relevant healthcare services (Cai et al., 2007) . Rampant stigma and restricted healthcare resources profoundly alter the healthcare experiences of PLWHA (Zhou, 2009) . One study documented the occurrence of several behaviors that have a negative impact on healthcare services for PLWHA, including addressing patients in an insulting manner, refusing to offer healthcare services, delaying treatment, providing uncoordinated care, betraying patient privacy, and over-protecting staff from patients (Wang et al., 2008) . These behaviors may stem from a generalized fear of HIV and the stigma associated with providing HIV care.",

Nurses graduating from all these programmes go on to similar staff nurse roles. Nursing education in China teaches nurses to give medications, follow orders, make beds, do technical work (e.g., give injections and bed baths) and treat patients as their family members (Chen et al., 2004) . Most of their updated nursing knowledge is obtained from textbooks rather than journal articles, and continuing education opportunities for Chinese nurses are very limited (Cragg et al., 2003) .",

Studies have suggested that removal of non-nursing tasks from nurses' roles and responsibilities can increase nurses' time in carrying out their professional roles and enhance the quality of psychological care and health education for patients (Yang & Cheng, 2004) . Although HCPs complained about the lack of clarity in inter-professional boundaries at their workplace, they also pointed out that this was pervasive in China. One study showed that although Chinese nurses believed they should perform most of the roles in the domain of psychosocial and communication aspects of patient care, 22.5% of them were not always providing consultation to patients and their families about plans for care (Lu, et al., 2008) .

The power differential between nurses and physicians might affect participants' willingness to talk in the focus group. Second, the techniques of brainstorming in focus groups may not be culturally consonant with Confucian ideals of propriety and modesty. Specifically, the more senior or higher status members would not be expected to risk voicing uncertain opinions open to critique. Third, the focus group was small and nurses and physicians were not equally represented. However, nurses did voice their dilemmas about the care that they provided to HIV-positive patients.

Currently, the healthcare services provided by this leading hospital were believed to be the most suitable for HIV-positive patients in China. However, there are more issues that should be addressed by these HCPs. Nurses, if they are able to devote more time to patient care, can focus more on the physical and psychosocial needs of HIV-positive patients and their family members. On-the-job training and continued education related to HIV/ AIDS can address the personal values that nurses carry into their work, which is likely to influence the quality of care given to patients.
