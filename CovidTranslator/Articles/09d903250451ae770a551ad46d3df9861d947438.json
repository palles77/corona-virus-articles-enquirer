However, it has considerable adverse effects that may cause public health burden. We hypothesize that the safety and efficacy of MV vaccine can be improved by altering the S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) binding site in the conserved region VI of the large polymerase protein. To test this hypothesis, we established an efficient reverse genetics system for the rMV-Hu191 strain and generated two recombinant MV-Hu191 carrying mutations in the SAM binding site. These two mutants grew to high titer in Vero cells, were genetically stable, and were significantly more attenuated in vitro and in vivo compared to the parental rMV-Hu191 vaccine strain. Importantly, both MV-Hu191 mutants triggered a higher neutralizing antibody than rMV-Hu191 vaccine and provided complete protection against MV challenge. These results demonstrate its potential for an improved MV vaccine candidate.",

In developing countries, measles is still a leading cause of mortality in children (Griffin and Oldstone, 2009; Tangy and Naim, 2005) , though vaccination is an effective, economical, and safe way to prevent outbreaks (Bester, 2016; de Vries et al., 2008) . In early 1960, a live-attenuated vaccine based on the Hu191 strain of MV was developed and is currently widely used for immunization in all provinces of China (Zhang et al., 2009) . While this vaccine is efficacious, it has associated adverse effects. Many vaccinated infants and children in China experienced side effects ranging from skin rashes, itching, swelling, and to high fever (Bester, 2016; Shu et al., 2011) . Additionally, outbreaks of measles have been increasing significantly in the past a few years in China, particularly the increasing proportion of adult and infant cases (Ma et al., 2016; Zhang et al., 2016) . The infected adults had received measles vaccination during childhood; still remain susceptible to infection with the measles virus, as the population immunity against measles after vaccination gradually reduces with time (Abad and Safdar, 2015; Gao et al., 2017; Ma et al., 2016; Zhang et al., 2016) . Thus, there is an increasing urgency to develop a safer, more efficient MV vaccine for eradication of measles in China.",

Similar to other NNS RNA viruses, the minimal machinery for MV transcription and replication is the ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex, which consists of the nucleocapsid (N)-RNA template tightly associated with the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, the large (L) protein and the phosphoprotein (P). Assembly of replication-competent RNPs is essential to the rescue of NNS RNA viruses (Bukreyev et al., 1996; Clarke et al., 2000; Garcin et al., 1995; Gassen et al., 2000; Jin et al., 1998; Lawson et al., 1995) . This can be achieved by co-transfection of a plasmid encoding a fulllength antigenomic cDNA together with plasmids encoding N, P, and L genes. Previously, several groups have already successfully rescued infectious MV from cDNA clones (Duprex et al., 1999; Kovacs et al., 2003; Nakatsu et al., 2006; Parks et al., 1999; Radecke et al., 1995; Sidhu et al., 1995) . The reverse genetics system can facilitate the rational design of safer, more efficient measles vaccine candidates.",

During transcription, NNS RNA viruses synthesize mRNAs that are capped and methylated at the 5'end and polyadenylated at the 3' end. Recent studies have shown that the entire mRNA capping and methylation machinery of NNS RNA viruses is distinct from their host (Ferron et al., 2002; Furuichi and Shatkin, 2000; Ogino and Banerjee, 2007; Zhang et al., 2014) . Using vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) as a model, it was found that VSV mRNA capping is catalyzed by an RNA:GDP polyribonucleotidyltransferase (PRNTase) in the L protein that transfers a monophosphate RNA onto a GDP acceptor (Li et al., 2008; Ogino and Banerjee, 2007) . The mRNA cap methylation in NNS RNA viruses is also unusual in that a single region in the L protein catalyzes both guanine-N-7 (G-N-7) and ribose 2\u2032-O (2\u2032-O) methylation (Li et al., 2006; Rahmeh et al., 2009) . Thus, mRNA cap formation is an excellent target for development of antiviral drugs and live vaccine candidates for NNS RNA viruses. Based on the sequence alignments, the L protein contains six conserved regions (CR) numbered I to VI. Recent studies showed that CR V of the L protein possesses an mRNA capping enzyme whereas CR VI is responsible for mRNA cap methyltransferase (MTase) activity (Li et al., 2008; Ogino et al., 2005) . It was shown that mutations to the capping enzyme were lethal to the virus. However, mutations to MTase region yielded recombinant viruses that were attenuated in vitro and in vivo. This suggests mRNA cap MTase is a novel target for rational design of live attenuated vaccines for NNS RNA viruses. This novel concept has recently been tested in several NNS RNA viruses including VSV, avian metapneumovirus (aMPV), human metapneumovirus (hMPV), and rabies virus (RABV) (Li et al., 2006; Sun et al., 2014; Tian et al., 2015; Zhang et al., 2014) . It was shown that recombinant viruses lacking MTase activity are highly attenuated in vitro and in vivo, yet retain optimal immunogenicity.",

To test this hypothesis, we established a robust reverse genetics system based on a Chinese MV vaccine strain MV-Hu-191, allowing us to recover recombinant MV in BHK cells stably expressing T7 RNA polymerase (Xu et al., 2011; Zhang et al., 2014) . Subsequently, two recombinant MVs with amino acid (aa) substitutions in the S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) binding site of L protein (rMV-Hu191-G1788A and rMV-Hu191-G1792A) were successfully recovered. These two MTase-defective mutants had delayed replication kinetics, grew to high titers, and were genetically stable through 15 passages in cell culture. Both MV mutants were significantly more attenuated in vitro and in vivo compared to the parental vaccine strain. Interestingly, both mutants induced significantly higher neutralizing antibody titers compared to the parental Fig. 1 . Construction of a full-length cDNA clone for MV-Hu191. The T7 promoter, 3\u2032 and 5\u2032 non-coding termini (NCT), antigenomic HDV ribozyme and T7 terminator were assembled in several rounds of fusion PCR, and inserted into pYES-2 using a \"seamless\" cloning strategy, resulted in the construction of p107109-MV(+) (A). Eight overlapping fragments containing the full-length MV genome were assembled into p107109-MV(+), creating pYES-MV(+) (B). A spontaneous mutation (C to U) in the H gene that distinguishes the lab-propagated parental virus and rescued recombinant virus was marked by \"*\" (B).",

The full-length cDNA clone of MV-Hu191 was successfully assembled by a single step ligation, without the need for restriction endonucleases. The 15,896-nt antigenomic MV cDNA was cloned under the control of a T7 RNA polymerase promoter, a hepatitis delta virus (HDV) ribozyme sequence, and a T7 terminator ( Fig. 1 ; Table 1 ). To recover infectious MV, BHK-SR19-T7 cells stably expressing T7 RNA polymerase were co-transfected with full-length cDNA clone pYES-MV(+) and the support plasmids expressing ribonucleoprotein (pT7-Hu191-N, pT7-Hu191-P, and pT7-Hu191-L). Three days post-transfection, cell monolayers were trypsinized and co-cultured with fresh Vero cells. MV-induced syncytia were observed 2-3 days later ( Fig. 2A , B and C). The successful recovery of rMV-Hu191 was further confirmed by detection of N protein expression in Vero cells infected with the rescued rMV-Hu191 by an immunofluorescence assay (Fig. 2D ). When extensive syncytia were observed, cells were harvested and the supernatants were used for further passage in Vero cells. After 3-4 passages, recombinant MV was plaque purified, and a large stock of virus was prepared. There is a spontaneous mutation (C to U) at nucleotide (nt) position 8763 within the H gene of the lab-propagated parental virus, which is different from the published Hu191 sequence (GenBank accession no. FJ416067). This site in pYES-MV(+) was mutated back to C by site-directed mutagenesis with PCR, which distinguished the parental virus in the lab but is identical with the published sequence. To confirm the recovered recombinant virus (rMV-Hu191) originated from pYES-MV(+) and not from cross-contamination of the parental MV-Hu191 grown in our laboratory, a region of the rMV H gene was amplified by RT-PCR and sequenced. The result showed that rMV-Hu191 contained the \"C\" mutation.",

Using the reverse genetics system, two recombinant MVs, rMV-Hu191-G1788A and rMV-Hu191-G1792A, were successfully rescued and viral titer gradually increased when they were passaged in Vero cells. The rMV mutants were confirmed by detection of N protein expression in Vero cells infected with the rescued rMV mutants by immunofluorescence (Figs. 2E and 2F). The rMV-Hu191-G1790A mutant was viable, but it grew poorly in Vero cell and further passages of this mutant did not increase viral titer (data not shown). Next, rMV-Hu191-G1788A and rMV-Hu191-G1792A were plaque purified. The sizes of virus-induced plaques differed between the rescued parental and mutant viruses. As demonstrated in Fig. 4 , after 6 days of incubation, the parental rMV-Hu191 formed plaques were 1.43 \u00b1 0.22 mm in diameter, whereas the average plaque for rMV-Hu191-G1788A and rMV-Hu191-G1792A was significantly smaller (0.98 \u00b1 0.16 mm and 0.79 \u00b1 0.13 mm, respectively; p < 0.05). This suggests that the two MV mutants likely had impaired growth kinetics that caused the plaque sizes to be reduced.

The traditional method for assembly of an infectious cDNA requires multiple cloning steps involved in restriction enzyme digestion and ligation, which are time consuming, labor extensive, and technically challenging. The traditional cloning strategy also often leads to some unexpected deletions, insertions, and mutations in the viral genome, which hamper the subsequent virus rescue.

            "text": "A live attenuated vaccine is a very promising vaccine for most human paramyxoviruses, as it does not cause enhanced lung diseases upon re-infection by the same virus. A live-attenuated vaccine based on the Hu191 strain of MV has been developed and is widely used for immunization in Chinese infants and children (Zhang et al., 2009 ). However, epidemiological study showed that this vaccine still causes some adverse effects that may cause public health burden. In addition to the safety issue, measles outbreaks have been increasing in recent years, likely due to gradual reducing of the population immunity against measles after vaccination with time (Abad and Safdar, 2015; Gao et al., 2017; Ma et al., 2016; Zhang et al., 2016) . In this study, we sought to improve the safety and efficacy of current MV vaccine by mutating the SAM binding site in the L protein. Using a robust reverse genetics for rMV-Hu191, rMV-Hu191 carrying mutations in the SAM binding site, rMV-Hu191-G1788A and rMV-Hu191-G1792A, were successfully rescued. These rMV-Hu191 mutants produced smaller plaques, had delayed growth kinetics, and had delayed syncytia formation compared to parental rMV-Hu191. Clearly, both mutants were significantly more attenuated in Vero cells than the parental rMV-Hu191. In cotton rats, rMV-Hu191-G1788A had a significantly lower viral titer in the lungs than rMV-Hu191 (p < 0.05). Recombinant rMV-Hu191-G1792A was even more attenuated, as only 1 out of 5 inoculated cotton rats had detectable viral titer in the lung. Despite the high attenuation phenotype, rMV-Hu191-G1788A grew to high titer compared to parental vaccine virus in Vero cells, the WHO approved cell line for vaccine production. Although rMV-Hu191-G1792A grew to a slightly lower titer (0.5 log less) in Vero cells, it is still economically feasible for vaccine production. Another advantage of using rMV-Hu191-G1792A is that it had a greater degree of attenuation in vitro and in vivo compared to rMV-Hu191-G1788A. Interestingly, both mutants triggered a higher level of neutralizing antibodies than parental rMV-Hu191, suggesting their greater immunogenicity. Finally, cotton rats vaccinated with both mutants were completely protected from the MV challenge. Thus, recombinant rMV-Hu191 carrying mutations in the SAM binding site are potentially improved vaccine candidates for MV.",

            "text": "A novel finding is that recombinant rMV-Hu191 carrying mutations in the SAM binding site triggered a higher neutralizing antibody compared to the parental rMV-Hu191 strain. Although the detailed mechanism is not explored in this study, it is possible that these MV mutants may trigger a higher innate immunity, which in turn triggered a more robust adaptive immunity. In fact, it was shown that coronavirus lacking 2'-O methylation significantly enhanced type I interferon response, which is another advantage of using viral mRNA cap MTase as a target in developing live vaccine candidates. Previously, it was found that two pneumoviruses (aMPV and hMPV) carrying mutations in the SAM binding site in CR VI of L protein were specifically defective in ribose 2\u2032-O methylation but not G-N-7 methylation, and were significantly attenuated but retained wild-type levels of immunogenicity. In addition, it was found that all 2\u2032-O MTase-defective hMPVs were highly sensitive to IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b2 treatment (Sun et al., 2014; Zhang et al., 2014) . Given the fact that the MTase domain is highly conserved in L proteins of all NNS RNA viruses, the general mechanism of attenuation of viruses that lack 2\u2032-O methylation may be similarly conserved in all NNS RNA viruses. Future experiments should investigate the mechanisms by which MV mutants enhance immunogenicity. ",

At 4 weeks post-immunization, the cotton rats in groups 2-5 were challenged with 1.0 \u00d7 10 7 PFU of parental rMV-Hu191 via intranasal route, and evaluated twice daily for the presence of any clinical symptoms. At 4 days post-challenge, all cotton rats were euthanized by CO 2 asphyxiation, and their lungs were collected for virus titration. The immunogenicity of rMV-Hu191 mutants was assessed based on their ability to trigger neutralizing antibodies and the ability to protect MV replication in lungs. Serum neutralization of virus was performed using an endpoint dilution plaque reduction assay; and (ii) quantification of lung viral titers was done by plaque assay.",
