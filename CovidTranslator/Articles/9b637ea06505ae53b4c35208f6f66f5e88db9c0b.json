The conjugate with streptavidin was specifically bound to biotinylated L cells, but not to unmodified L cells. The conjugate with conA was bound to L cells in the absence of, but not in the presence of a-methyl mannoside. Incubation of L cells with bound conjugates did not produce virus, although the conjugates were highly infectious in HeLa cells, containing natural poliovirus receptors. This suggests that the artificially bound virus was unable to penetrate the L cells and start replication. The possibility that binding of the virus to the natural receptor is required for efficient infection is discussed.",

            "text": "Poliovirus binds to receptors that are present only on cells of primate origin. At low virus concentrations this binding is essential for infection [ 1, 21. Recent findings at this laboratory indicate that the penetration of the poliovirus genome into the cytosol takes place in acidified endocytic vesicles where the low pH exposes hydrophobic domains in the virus capsid [3, 41 . The possibility was considered that the sole function of the virus receptor is to increase the local concentration of the virus at the cell surface and thus augment the efficiency of virus uptake by endocytosis. If this were so, it might be possible to replace the specific binding to the poliovirus receptor by conjugating the virus to a ligand that binds to cell surface structures other than the normal receptor. In fact, in the case of enveloped viruses, binding by alternative receptors, has led to productive infection in cells lacking the naturally occurring receptor [5, 61. The specific binding of picornaviruses to their receptors could, however, also play a more direct role in virus penetration. This may be the case with diphtheria toxin where specific interaction with the anion antiporter appears to be essential for efficient entry [7, 81. In the case of poliovirus and other picornaviruses it has been suggested that the cellular receptor binds to the canyon surrounding the twelve vertices at the virus surface [9, 101 . Insertion of the specific receptor into this canyon could act as a wedge and facilitate the conformational change which is triggered by low pH and which exposes hydrophobic domains on the virus surface [3, 4] . In fact, the exposure of hydrophobic domains occurs at less acidic pH when the virus binds to cell surface receptors than when the virus is free in solution [3] .",

If a single conA or streptavidin molecule is sufftcient to retain the virus on the columns used for the purification, the fact that only -10 % of the virus particles treated with conA or streptavidin became bound to the respective affinity columns, indicates that only a fraction of the virus particles were modified. It is therefore likely that essentially all modified particles have bound only one molecule of conA or streptavidin. When the unmodified virus binds to sensitive receptor-bearing cells, the virus probably interacts with a number of receptor molecules. As a result of such multiple binding, a close interaction between the virus particle and the cell membrane should occur. Such close Exp CeNRes 170 (1987) interaction could be crucial for entry of the viral genome when the bound virus is exposed to low pH.",

Essential for the infection was the interaction of the F-glycoprotein of the virus with the asialoglycoprotein receptor. The mutant virus was also able to induce cell-cell fusion in the hepatoma cultures. Sendai virus was also shown to induce fusion of desialylated erythrocytes in the presence of hybrid antibodies that had affinity both for red blood cells and for Sendai virus [24] . Finally, Fuller et al. [5] showed that vesicular stomatitis virus and Semliki Forest virus that normally infect MDCK cells only from the basolateral side, were able to infect also from the apical side in cells that expressed influenza hemagglutinin on the apical side. The hemagglutinin on the apical side bound glycoproteins on the viruses and thus induced virus entry and infection.
