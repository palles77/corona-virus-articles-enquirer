Porcine rubulavirus (PoRV) was identified as the aetiological agent of disease outbreaks in pigs in Mexico during early 1980s, but the origin of PoRV remains elusive. In this study, the completed genome sequence of MPRV was determined, and the complete genome sequence of PoRV was assembled from previously published protein-coding genes and the noncoding genome regions determined from this study. Comparison of sequence and genome organization indicated that PoRV is more closely related to MPRV than to any other members of the genus Rubulavirus. In the P gene coding region of both viruses, there is an ORF located at the 5 0 end of the P gene overlapping with the P protein coding region, similar to the C protein ORF present in most viruses of the subfamily Paramyxovirinae, but ab-sent in other known rubulaviruses. Based on these findings, we hypothesise that PoRV may also originate from bats, and spillover events from bats to pigs, either directly or via an intermediate host, were responsible for the sporadic disease outbreaks observed in Mexico.",

In the last few decades, many novel paramyxoviruses have been isolated from a variety of animal species and their emergence has, on occasion, been accompanied by spectacular outbreaks of disease. Members of the family Paramyxoviridae are enveloped viruses possessing a nonsegmented negative-strand genome and are divided into two subfamilies, Paramyxovirinae and Pneumovirinae. Currently, there are five genera within the subfamily Paramyxovirinae: Rubulavirus, Avulavirus, Respirovirus, Morbillivirus, and Henipavirus [22] .",

            "text": "Since 1994, four novel bat-associated paramyxoviruses have emerged, three of which have caused outbreaks of disease in both humans and animals [47] . In September 1994 in Brisbane, Australia, Hendra virus (HeV) caused an outbreak of severe respiratory disease resulting in the death of 13 horses and their trainer [32] . Since then, sporadic HeV outbreaks involving both horse and human infections have been reported [13] . A related virus, Nipah virus (NiV) was isolated and subsequently identified as the cause of an outbreak of encephalitis in humans in Malaysia that began in September 1998 and resulted in 105 fatalities [9] . The outbreak was associated with respiratory illness in pigs, and over one million pigs were culled in its control. Following the discovery of NiV in Malaysia, outbreaks of NiV have been detected in Bangladesh and India between 2001 and 2005 [7, 12, 17] . Serological and virological studies suggest that similar viruses exist in the fruit bat populations in Cambodia, Thailand and Indonesia [36, 38, 45] . In 1997, Menangle virus (MenPV) was isolated from stillborn piglets affected by foetal deformities, at a commercial piggery in New South Wales, Australia [34] , and serological evidence indicated that it may have caused influenza-like illness in two humans who had been in close contact with infected piglets [8] . The presence of neutralizing antibodies in several species of fruit bats suggests that they may be the natural host of this virus [34] . In 2000, Tioman virus (TioPV) was isolated from urine collected beneath a fruit bat colony on Tioman Island, Malaysia [10] . Molecular characterization revealed that MenPV and TiPV are closely related novel members of the genus Rubulavirus [4, 5, 10, 11] .",

Its initial placement within the family Paramyxoviridae was made on the basis of its morphology and ability to agglutinate guinea pig erythrocytes at 4 C [50] . The classification of MPRV as a member of the Paramyxoviridae was corroborated by a later study in which all of the seven virus-encoded proteins were identified and the gene coding for the nucleocapsid protein (N) was cloned and sequenced [14] . Analysis based on the N gene sequence suggested that MPRV should be classified as a new member of the genus Rubulavirus. To date, it is not known whether MPRV is capable of infecting and causing disease in other animal species.",

            "text": "Originally called La Piedad Michoacan Mexico virus (LPMV) or blue-eye disease virus, porcine rubulavirus (PoRV) was responsible for outbreaks of disease in pigs in Mexico during the early 1980s [31, 39] . Piglets 2-15 days old were the most susceptible, manifesting nervous signs and clinical symptoms such as lethargy and conjunctivitis, and in a small proportion (up to 10%), either unilateral or bilateral corneal opacity (blue eye). In litters farrowed during an outbreak, morbidity and mortality were high (up to 50 and 90%, respectively). Older pigs were also susceptible, but the proportion affected was much smaller, 1-4%, and the mortality was low. First discovered in 1980 on a commercial farm in La Piedad, Michoacan State, the disease spread in subsequent years to other parts of central Mexico [28] , but to date, it seems to be confined to this country, with no report of similar disease in other countries. The virus was initially classified as a paramyxovirus on the basis of its morphology and capacity to agglutinate a wide range of red blood cells and spontaneously elute from them at 37 C. Subsequent sequence analysis revealed significant genetic relatedness with several rubulaviruses, resulting in the creation of the new name porcine rubulavirus. Since the first recognised outbreak in 1980, sporadic outbreaks continued to occur, but the origin of the virus remains unknown [28] .",

Neither MPRV nor PoRV contains the SH gene present in two known rubulaviruses, MuV and SV5. At 15180 nt in length, the PoRV genome is the smallest in the subfamily Paramyxovirinae, and 6 nt smaller than the previously smallest genome of Newcastle disease virus (NDV) at 15186 nt [22] . The size of the MPRV genome, at 15486 nt, is within the range of other rubulavirus genomes. Both viruses have a genome length which is divisible by six, suggesting that these viruses most likely conform to the rule-of-six [20] . The sizes of the encoded MPRV proteins are similar to those of PoRV (Table 1 ). Approximately 90.5% of the MPRV genome is used for protein coding in comparison to 92.6% for PoRV. Both viruses have a genome coding capacity similar to the average coding percentage (92%) of the subfamily [29] .",

Interestingly, a similar ORF C was also present in the MPRV P gene, albeit with a smaller size of 96 aa. To examine whether the putative C proteins were produced in cells infected with these viruses, rabbit antisera were produced against recombinant C proteins expressed in E. coli. Three versions of N-terminally tagged fusion proteins were made for both MPRV and PoRV C proteins, which were His 6 -C, GST-C, and biotin-C, respectively. The His 6 -C was expressed at the highest level for both viruses (Fig. 3A) and was used as an immunogen for raising antibo-dies in rabbits. After three injections, the rabbits produced antisera which reacted not only to His 6 -C, but also to GST-C or biotin-C (Fig. 3B, C) , indicating that C-specific antibodies were successfully produced. However, when MPRV-or PoRV-infected cells were analyzed using these antibodies, no C protein was detected using the rabbit antisera in any of the three assays conducted, immunofluorescent antibody test, Western blot and radio immunoprecipitation (data not shown).",

The lack of wide-spread and sustained PoRV infection among pig populations mimics the epidemiological pattern of the MenPV outbreak in Australia. Although MenPV was never isolated from bats, there was serological evidence suggesting that the same virus or a closely related virus was circulating in the fruit bat population near the pig farm where the outbreaks occurred [34] . This notion was further supported by the isolation of TioPV from fruit bats in Malaysia, which has the closest genetic relatedness to MenPV among all known rubulaviruses [4, 5, 10, 11] .",

The 55-nt 3 0 leader sequences of the two viruses were also the most closely related among all rubulaviruses. As shown in Table 1 , the major structural proteins of the two viruses have almost identical predicted molecular weights and pI values. The sequence identity between cognate proteins of the two viruses varies from approximately 40% (for P proteins) to 60% (for L proteins). Although the percentage identities were not as high as those between MenPV and TioPV (54-84%), phylogenetic trees generated from all of the six major structural proteins clearly confirmed that PoRV is more closely related to MPRV than to any other member in the genus.",

For example, the lack of the C-proteincoding capacity has been used as a genetic marker 1268 L.-F. Wang et al. for classification of paramyxoviruses into the genera Rubulavirus and Avulavirus. In this regard, it was surprising to find that both PoRV and MPRC contain a putative C-protein-coding region in their P genes. Although paramyxovirus C proteins are highly variable in size and sequence, they do share two common molecular characteristics. They are encoded by the P gene in an alternative reading frame overlapping with the N-terminal coding region of the P protein, and most of them are basic proteins with high pI [29] . It is worth noting that the putative C proteins of MPRV and PoRV have a very similar pI and both are basic (Table 1 ). In order to determine whether the putative C proteins were expressed in cells infected with PoRV or MPRV, rabbit antisera were generated against His 6 -C fusion proteins for both viruses. Although we were able to demonstrate that C-specific antibodies were generated in both cases, we were unable to detect C proteins in either PoRV-or MPRVinfected cells using three different assays, including the most sensitive radioimmunoprecipitation method. There are several possibilities to account for these results. First, it is possible that the C proteins in these viruses are expressed only under certain physiological conditions in their hosts, and they were not expressed under the in vitro tissue culture conditions used in this study. Second, they might be expressed only in very minute amounts and our reagents and assays were not sensitive enough to detect the expression. Compared with the optimal Kozak consensus sequence (GCCRCCATGG, R \u00bc A or G), the predicted Kozak sequences for the C ORF of MPRV (AGATCGATGA) and PoRV (TCTCTGATGG) appeared to be weaker than those of the V=P ORF of MPRV (CGGGCCATGG) and PoRV (GCTGAGATGG). This is different from other paramyxoviruses known to express C proteins, which usually have a stronger Kozak sequence for the C ORF than the P ORF, allowing translational re-initiation from the downstream C ORF start codon. Third, our antibodies were generated against an E. coli-derived recombinant fusion protein which was insoluble and purified in the presence of SDS. These antibodies may not be able to recognize the native viral C proteins. Further investigation is required to obtain more conclusive results.",
