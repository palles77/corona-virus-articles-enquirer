Neuronal death inevitably leads to degeneration of axons and secondary degeneration of the myelin surrounding them. Primary diseases of myelin or myelin-forming cells can result from a multitude of causes, including autoimmunity, viral infections, genetic defects, toxic agents, malnutrition, and mechanical trauma. Comprehensive descriptions of the clinical features, pathology, and pathogenesis of most of the diseases described in this chapter are available in specialized books (Lazzarini, 2004; Love et al., 2008; Ropper & Samuels, 2009) .

Myelin forms initially, but it becomes progressively vulnerable to degeneration with age due to accumulation of metabolic intermediates. Diseases resulting from loss of normal myelin after it is formed, i.e., demyelination, can be subdivided into primary and secondary categories on the basis of morphological observations. Primary demyelination involves the destruction of myelin with relative sparing of axons, whereas secondary demyelination includes those disorders in which myelin is involved only after damage to neurons and axons occurs. However, in recent years it has become increasingly apparent that some diseases that had been classified as primary demyelination may involve more injury to axons than originally thought. This axonal damage could be caused by inflammation or loss of trophic support provided by myelinating cells to axons. This topic is described in more detail in the sections on multiple sclerosis and the acquired and inherited peripheral neuropathies.",

            "text": "The most pronounced biochemical changes associated with CNS demyelination occur in white matter, where there is a marked increase in water content, a decrease of myelin proteins and lipids and/or the appearance of other lipids or proteins, such as cholesterol esters or glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). Particularly noteworthy with regard to lipids are dramatic decreases in galactocerebroside, ethanolamine plasmalogens and cholesterol, all of which are enriched in myelin membranes (see Ch. 10). The major structural proteins of CNS myelin, myelin basic protein (MBP) and proteolipid protein (PLP), are also invariably decreased. These changes can be explained by the breakdown and gradual loss of myelin (which is relatively rich in solids) and its replacement by extracellular fluid, astrocytes and inflammatory cells (which are more hydrated, relatively lipid-poor and free of myelin-specific constituents). The frequent appearance of cholesterol esters in demyelinating diseases is related to the fact that cholesterol is not readily degraded and is esterified by phagocytes that often remain at the site of the lesion for some time. Since cholesterol esters are essentially absent from normal mature brain, their presence in myelin disorders is indicative of recent phagocytosis of myelin. In the CNS, GFAP is specific to astrocytes, and an increase of this protein during demyelination is due to reactive astrocytosis (see Ch. 6). The magnitude of the changes mentioned above vary considerably from disease to disease and from specimen to specimen in the same disease, depending on the severity, location, duration and activity of the pathological processes.",

T2-weighted MRI is the most sensitive sequence for identification of lesions in brains of MS patients, but is not specific because both inflammatory demyelination and ischemic necrosis result in increased signal. T2-weighted images also cannot distinguish new from old lesions. T1-weighted imaging after the administration of gadolinium can identify new lesions in which the blood-brain barrier has been compromised. Serial studies of patients with early relapsing-remitting MS have shown that the first event in the development of a new MS lesion is the appearance of a gadolinium-enhanced lesion, which can occur during periods of clinical stability in many patients. Newer imaging techniques, such as magnetic resonance spectroscopy, magnetization transfer ratio, and diffusion tensor imaging, provide additional characterization of lesions over time, and correlations of MRI of postmortem brains with histopathology (e.g., Fisher et al., 2007) , can validate the interpretations of lesions identified by different techniques and help to focus ongoing research.",

White matter lesions typically are sharply demarcated from the surrounding tissue ( Fig. 39-1 ). Microscopic examination shows loss of myelin with relative preservation of axons and inflammatory infiltrates composed of lymphocytes and myeloid lineage cells (macrophages and microglia). T-lymphocytes predominate, but B-lymphocytes and plasma cells are also present. Lesions commonly originate around venules, but this is not always the case (Lucchinetti et al., 2000) . The activity of white-matter lesions can be classified as active, chronic active, or chronic inactive, based upon immunohistochemical staining patterns using antibodies to myelin proteins and myeloid cells. Active lesions are hypercellular due to the inflammatory infiltrates, whereas chronic lesions are hypocellular due to relative paucity of inflammation and oligodendrocyte loss. Detailed immunocytochemical studies of active lesions in biopsy and autopsy specimens suggest that MS lesions can be subdivided into four different patterns: T-cell-mediated demyelination, antibody-mediated demyelination, and primary oligodendrocyte death, with or without apoptosis (Lucchinetti et al., 2000) . A recent report describes active MS lesions with areas of myelin phagocytosis and oligodendrocyte loss in the absence of lymphocytic inflammation, supporting the idea that primary oligodendrocyte degeneration may precede an inflammatory response (Henderson et al., 2009 ).",

Sera from patients with NMO showed a pattern of immunoreactivity that highlighted CNS microvessels and the pia (Lennon et al., 2004) . This and the pattern of immunoreactivity in kidney and stomach suggested that AQP4 was the target antigen, and this was proven to be the case (Lennon, et al., 2005) . Studies on tissue from NMO patients showed that there is loss of AQP4 immunoreactivity and complement deposition in the lesions of inflammatory demyelination, but not in uninvolved tissue. At the time, AQP4 was known to be the predominant water channel in the brain and had a role in brain edema formation in response to a variety of etiologies. The possible involvement of AQP4 in neuroinflammation had never been investigated. Several groups explored the pathogenic role of antibodies to AQP4 in rodent models (see Li et al. 2011 for references) . These studies showed that administration of anti-AQP4 antibodies to animals with EAE or along with complement to na\u00efve animals produced pathology characteristic of NMO. When EAE was induced in AQP4 knockout mice, the animals had attenuated symptoms and CNS inflammation compared to wild-type controls. This group went on to perform a systematic exploration of the mechanism by which AQP4 deficiency protected animals from the inflammatory pathology of EAE (Li et al., 2011) . The major difference between the two groups was that the knockout mice showed a decreased inflammatory response to intracerebral injection with lipopolysaccharide (LPS). In vitro analysis of microglia-free astrocyte cultures showed that LPS induced secretion of TNF-alpha and IL-6 into the medium, but this was reduced in the knockout animals compared to controls. Transfection studies demonstrated that cytokine secretion was directly related to expression of AQP4 by cells. These recent data provide new hypotheses for investigating the role of the water permeability function of astrocytes in neuroinflammation.",

Type II lesions are located entirely within the cortex and are typically centered on blood vessels. Type III lesions appear to begin at the pial surface and extend into the superficial layers of cortex. A single type III lesion can involve several gyri, so the total lesion area can be quite extensive. Cortical demyelination occurs without significant influx of hematogeneous leukocytes (Peterson et al., 2001; . Compared to white matter lesions, there are fewer lymphocytes and no perivascular cuffs.

Active highly inflamed lesions can contain more than 11,000 transected axons per mm 3 tissue, and the edge of chronic active lesions contain more than 3,000 transected axons per mm 3 tissue, whereas the core of chronic lesions contains on average 875 transected axons per mm 3 tissue (Trapp et al., 1998) .

For example, removal of myelin proteins, such as myelin associated glycoprotein (MAG) or 2\ue039,3\ue039-cyclic nucleotide 3\ue039-phosphodiesterase (CNP), in mice results in late-onset axonal degeneration without significant myelin pathology . While these data demonstrate that normal myelin is required for long-term axonal survival, the signaling mechanisms by which myelinating oligodendrocytes support the axon are unknown. An understanding of these mechanisms could aid in the development of neuroprotective therapies for MS patients. This is important because analysis of repeat MRIs in MS patients shows that brain atrophy is one of the most reliable predictors of clinical disease progression.",

Affected areas of MS white matter exhibit the expected decrease of myelin constituents and a buildup of cholesterol esters. For example, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of homogenates of macroscopically normal appearing white matter, outer periplaque, inner periplaque, and plaque shows the expected decline of MBP and PLP in going from the normal-appearing white matter to the center of the plaque in both chronic and acute lesions ( Fig. 39-2 ). There is a virtual absence of these myelin proteins in the center of the chronic plaque and an accumulation of GFAP indicative of astrogliosis ( Fig. 39-2B) . A plaque from a more acute lesion is not completely demyelinated, as indicated by the presence of some MBP and PLP, and there is no accumulation of GFAP ( Fig. 39-2C ). The more acute plaque contains albumin as a result of breakdown of the blood-brain barrier. A number of biochemical studies have indicated that myelin constituents are significantly reduced even in some areas of macroscopically normal-appearing white matter of MS brain in comparison to control white matter, and this is most probably explained by the presence of microlesions throughout the affected brain.",

Other substances present in the inflammatory microenvironment can induce signal transduction events that ultimately result in injury or affect the migration of cells involved in damage or repair.

There are several classes of therapies approved for patients with relapsing-remitting MS that are considered to be \"disease modifying.\" All of these are believed to affect inflammation-mediated injury. The beta-interferons approved for MS therapy have many immunomodulatory effects. The mechanism by which treatment reduces the number of relapses is unknown. Although interferon treatment delays disease progression, it does not stop it. Glatiramer acetate is a synthetic random polymer, composed of L-alanine, L-glutamic acid, L-lysine, and L-tyrosine, and is believed to block antigen presentation and promote Th2 anti-inflammatory responses. Mitoxantrone is a synthetic antineoplastic anthrocenedione that causes immunosuppression by inhibiting proliferation of B-and T-cells and macrophages. Although it has efficacy in reducing relapses and progressive disability, the risk of cardiotoxicity and secondary leukemia limits its use. Another therapeutic approach is to inhibit migration of T-cells across the blood-brain barrier by natalizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody that is directed against alpha 4-integrin and blocks its function. Natalizumab is highly effective in controlling relapses and reducing the appearance of new lesions on MRI. Unfortunately, treatment with natalizumab (and other monoclonal antibodies that interfere with leukocyte function) can result in progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), a fatal viral-mediated demyelinating disease (see below). Currently, this drug is approved only for a subset of patients refractory to other therapies, and its use requires close surveillance for development of PML. The most recent drug approved for MS is fingolimod. Fingolimod is given orally, in contrast to the other agents which require injection or intravenous infusion. It induces internalization of the sphingosine-1-phosphate type 1 receptor on lymphocytes, which results in sequestration of lymphocytes in peripheral lymphoid organs. The long-term efficacy of fingolimod is still under investigation. Alternative approaches to therapy involve repair both by stimulating remyelination and by promoting the survival and regeneration of axons and are discussed in greater detail at the end of this chapter.",

Correspondingly, MS is most prevalent among Caucasians, but the incidence of MS has been documented worldwide. Recent analyses of large clinical registries of MS patients have demonstrated that, while the clinical course of MS is quite variable in early stages of the disease, the later stages are more uniform in the rate of progression and the chronological age at which permanent disability milestones are achieved (see Compston, 2006) .",

First is the different prevalence of MS among ethnic groups. Second is the well-documented increased risk among first-degree relatives of individuals with the disease. Specifically, risk of MS is 20-30% between monozygotic twins compared to 2-5% among fraternal twins. More recently, genome-wide analysis of single-nucleotide polymorphisms has identified a number of genetic loci that are associated with increased risk of MS among the general population (Australia and New Zealand Multiple Sclerosis Genetics Consortium (ANZgene), 2009; De Jager et al., 2009 ). Many polymorphisms map to genes or genetic loci associated with immune regulation. The strongest association is with the HLA-DRB1 gene on chromosome 6p21 that accounts for 16-60% of genetic susceptibility to MS. The increasing number of genetic loci implicated in susceptibility to MS indicates that, if MS is a genetic disease, it is a complex genetic disorder in which multiple interacting polymorphic genes have low penetrance and exert a small effect on the overall disease risk (Ch. 41).",

An autoimmune response could be induced by molecular mimicry to an infectious agent, but all efforts to identify a single responsible agent have been unsuccessful. It may be that several myelin antigens play a role in MS, and that the relative importance of different antigens varies among individuals depending on their immunogenetic background and environmental factors encountered during their life.

The EAE model was initially identified through efforts to understand the cause of encephalomyelitis after inoculation of patients with the Pasteur rabies vaccine, which was prepared from virus-infected nervous tissue. It was noted that even control experimental animals inoculated with uninfected neural tissue developed an encephalomyelitis. Since its discovery, EAE has been induced in a number of species by a variety of techniques and includes models representing both acute and chronic relapsing aspects of inflammatory demyelinating disease. Usually EAE is induced by immunization with a myelin protein or peptide, most notably MBP, PLP or myelinoligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG). The classical form of the disease is mediated primarily by CD4-positive major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II restricted T-cells that are stimulated in the periphery and enter the CNS. Transfer of these T-cells to naive animals can induce disease. Although these data document the importance of CD4 lymphocytes for EAE induction, studies of MS tissues show that CD8-positive T-cells are the predominant lymphocyte population. There is considerable variation in susceptibility of various animals, and this variation is largely due to the genetic background, especially that of MHC genes. This observation is relevant to the genetic association of MHC genes identified in MS patients (Australia and New Zealand Multiple Sclerosis Genetics Consortium (ANZgene), 2009; De Jager et al., 2009) .",

Evidence from studying EAE in the rat or mouse indicates that activated T-cells, regardless of specificity, can cross the blood-brain barrier and enter the nervous system. If the T-cell encounters its antigen, the cell will be further activated and begin production of proinflammatory cytokines, such as gamma-interferon and tumor necrosis factor-alpha. This in turn activates the endothelial cells to upregulate cell adhesion molecules (see Ch. 9) and promotes entry of additional inflammatory cells into the CNS. The outcome of this process, at least in some animals, is myelin damage. The actual effector mechanisms for myelin damage include a direct toxic effect of tumor necrosis factor-alpha or nitric oxide on oligodendrocytes or damage mediated by macrophages and microglial cells. The latter possibility can be enhanced by the presence of antibodies, which bind to myelin and provide a ligand for activated monocytes. Indeed, demyelination associated with EAE in several animals, including the rat, mouse, and marmoset, is increased by the presence of antibodies to surface components of myelin, such as galactocerebroside or MOG. In fact, immunization of rodents with MOG alone has been shown to induce a relapsing-remitting demyelinating disease with both cellular and humoral immunity to this glycoprotein.",

Cuprizone is a copper-chelating agent that when orally administered induces demyelination. The demyelination induced by cuprizone is dependent upon continuous exposure because spontaneous remyelination occurs following cessation of treatment. Lysolecithin activates phospholipase A2. Focal demyelination occurs when lysolecithin is administered by intracerebral injection. Neither of these models reproduce the inflammatory component of demyelination observed in MS lesions. Therefore, both of these models are most useful for research on mechanisms of remyelination. Because the demyelination produced by the cuprizone model involves large areas of the CNS, this model is most amenable to biochemical analysis.",

Pathologically, ADEM is characterized by multiple small perivenular foci of demyelination (Love et al., 2008) . Acute hemorrhagic encephalomyelitis is a more severe form of ADEM characterized by fibrinoid necrosis of parenchymal vessels that results in multifocal hemorrhage. Typically, there is leukocytosis and increased protein in cerebrospinal fluid, consistent with compromise of the blood-brain barrier. The demyelination occurring in these conditions is likely to be mediated at least in part by immune mechanisms, since T-cells sensitized to MBP are detected in many of these patients.

Some of these patients have a hematologic malignancy such as multiple myeloma or lymphoma at the time of diagnosis, but most have a premalignant condition called \"monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance.\" Nerve conduction studies show that the majority of patients have a demyelinating neuropathy, and Western blot analysis demonstrates that the patients' sera contain IgM antibodies to MAG (Niermeijer et al., 2010) . The anti-MAG antibodies in these patients react with a carbohydrate epitope (HNK-1) that is shared with other myelin glycoproteins, including P0 and peripheral myelin protein-22 (PMP-22), and sulfate-3-glucuronyl paragloboside, a glycolipid that is present in much larger amounts in the mature PNS than the CNS.

Initial descriptions were that of a monophasic polyneuropathy that frequently occurred following a bacterial or viral infection and was characterized histologically by segmental demyelination and perivascular lymphocytic infiltrates (Lazzarini, 2004; Winer, 2011 ) (see also Ch. 38). Over the decades additional clinical phenotypes were identified, and today the GBS spectrum includes a number of additional entities including acute motor axonal neuropathy (AMAN), acute motor and sensory axonal neuropathy, Bickerstaff's brainstem encephalitis, and Miller-Fisher syndrome (Winer, 2011) . The immunopathogenesis of the GBS spectrum is best understood for AMAN (Hughes & Cornblath, 2005; Kaida & Kusunoki, 2010) . Serum antibodies to gangliosides, including GM1, GD1a and GalNAcGD1a, were identified in these patients, and they also had antecedent intestinal infection with Campylobacter jejuni. Subsequent research demonstrated cross-immunoreactivity of serum antibodies with C. jejuni lipooligosaccharides and gangliosides present in myelinated axons (Fig. 39-3) . These antibodies elicit activation of complement with subsequent nerve injury by phagocytosis. AMAN represents the best evidence for molecular mimicry between immunogens expressed by antecedent infectious agents and neural epitopes in the pathogenesis of nervous system disease. The precise cellular localization of immune-mediated injury has not been identified, but the node of Ranvier is a likely target. Additional studies have demonstrated that sera from patients with GBS contain antibodies that react more strongly with complexes of two gangliosides than with individual gangliosides (Kaida & Kusunoki, 2010) , indicating that heterodimeric interaction of two gangliosides, presumably within lipid rafts, produces new pathogenic epitopes. As a result, an increased number of patients with GBS and antiganglioside antibodies have been identified, including patients with demyelination identified by nerve conduction studies. The presence of antiganglioside complex antibodies has also been correlated with clinical severity. Laboratory diagnostic techniques that enable detection of antiganglioside complex antibodies have been developed that will enable high-throughput analysis of patient serum (Rinaldi et al., 2009) . Applications of such advances are likely to facilitate research into our understanding of immune-mediated peripheral neuropathies as well as acquired immune-mediated diseases of the CNS.",

Cognitive or neuropsychiatric symptoms are frequently more prominent features in adults and may be the reason that the patient seeks medical attention. In the absence of a family history, a leukodystrophy may not be considered initially. Symptomatic patients are often referred for brain MRI to evaluate for possible acquired infectious, neoplastic, and toxic diseases. In this setting, identification of diffuse symmetric abnormal signals in cerebral white matter leads to the consideration of leukodystrophy and subsequent solicitation of additional family history and appropriate biochemical and/or genetic testing.

This gene encodes a peroxisomal membrane protein that is a member of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter superfamily. Members of this superfamily are responsible for transporting a variety of molecules across cell membranes, but the exact mechanism by which an alteration in the ABCD1 gene causes accumulation of very long chain fatty acids is still unknown (Lazzarini, 2004) . There are two major clinical phenotypes: cerebral leukodystrophy and adrenomyeloneuropathy. A minority of patients presents with adrenal insufficiency or are asymptomatic. Up to 50% of female carriers can be symptomatic. The pathology of the cerebral form is unique among leukodystrophies in that there is marked perivascular lymphocytic inflammation and it can resemble the inflammatory demyelination of MS histologically.

Metachromatic leukodystrophy results from a genetic alteration in the arylsulfatase A gene, and there is an accumulation of sulfatide, which cannot be metabolized. In Krabbe disease, there is an alteration in the galactocylceramidase gene. This enzyme hydrolyzes galactose ester bonds, which are present in several glycolipids, including galactocerebroside, which is abundant in myelin, and galactosylsphingosine (psychosine). Galactocerebroside does not accumulate, most likely because oligodendrocytes die as a result of psychosine toxicity.",

From a historical perspective, the most common inherited peripheral neuropathies were divided into two forms of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT) largely on the basis of electrophysiology: type 1 (CMT1), which primarily affects myelin, and type 2 (CMT2), which primarily affects axons. There are a number of less-common diseases limited to peripheral neuropathy that vary in clinical severity, ranging from hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies to Dejerine-Sottas syndrome and congenital hypomyelinating neuropathy, as well as genetic syndromes that include peripheral neuropathy as a component (Scherer et al., 2008) . This section will focus on the inherited neuropathies that have a demyelinating phenotype. The most common forms of CMT1 are caused by autosomal dominant mutations in genes encoding compact myelin proteins, PMP-22 in CMT1A and P0 protein in CMT1B, but over 20 other genes have been associated with demyelinating neuropathies.

An emerging general concept is that gene dosage is a critical factor impacting the severity of clinical phenotype. This is supported by research on transgenic and knockout animal models that illustrate the importance of dosage of some myelin proteins for myelin stability (see Ch. 10). For example, CMT1A is usually due to duplication of the PMP-22 gene with onset in the second or third decade of life and is characterized by segmental demyelination, remyelination, and onion bulb formation. Hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies is a milder neuropathy brought on by pressure or trauma to an affected nerve and is caused by a heterozygous deletion of PMP-22. Some more severe forms of CMT1A and Dejerine-Sottas syndrome have missense mutations in transmembrane regions of PMP-22 similar to the murine trembler mutations (see Ch. 10). CMT1B and some forms of Dejerine-Sottas syndrome are caused by a variety of mutations in the major P0 glycoprotein of compact myelin, presumably impairing its capacity to stabilize the intraperiod and/or major dense lines or interfering with a function in signal transduction (see Ch. 10).",

            "text": "There are other forms of inherited neuropathy affecting myelin that are caused by mutations of genes that alter Schwann cell proteins not localized in compact myelin. Some examples include (1) an X-linked form (CMT1X) caused by mutations of the gap junction protein connexin 32 (CX32), which is localized in paranodal loops and incisures where it probably forms gap junctions between adjacent layers of myelin membranes; (2) a recessive form (CMT4F) caused by mutations of periaxin, which is part of a protein complex linking the extracellular basal lamina to the actin cytoskeleton of Schwann cells; (3) a dominant form of CMT1 caused by mutations of a zinc finger transcription factor (EGR2, also called Krox 20); and (4) recessive forms involving signaling molecules, such as the myotubularin-related phosphases (CMT4B1 and CMT4B1). The involvement of transcription factors and signaling molecules in demyelinating neuropathies also support the importance of gene dosage. For example, alterations in EGR2 often result in severe phenotypes because Krox20 is known to activate expression of a number of genes known to cause inherited neuropathies (P0, PMP22, Cx32, periaxin). Similarly, signaling molecules participate in numerous cellular pathways. It is clear that genetic alterations in a variety of Schwann cell functions can cause myelin deficiencies. Our understanding of the pathogenic mechanisms of the different alterations in genes known to be involved in inherited neuropathies is advancing, but far from complete. Furthermore, as is the case for disorders of CNS myelin, it is becoming increasingly apparent that axonal pathology and degeneration are often responsible for much of the neurological impairment in these inherited disorders caused by Schwann cell-specific defects, possibly due to altered Schwann cell-axon interactions (Ch. 38).",

During this period, a large portion of the brain's metabolic activity and synthetic capacity are involved in cerebral myelinogenesis. The most vulnerable period appears to be the time of oligodendroglial proliferation and differentiation. Therefore, any metabolic insult during this 'vulnerable period' may lead to a preferential reduction in myelin formation (Love et al., 2008) . The most common disorder is periventricular leukomalacia. This disorder is usually a consequence of hypoxic/ischemic injury resulting in disruption of oligodendrocyte maturation. The pathology can be variable, ranging from focal cavitary necrosis to generalized cerebral hypomyelination. Specific nutritional deficiencies and acquired toxicities are known to cause pathology in mature myelin. Descriptions of the pathology of many of these disorders are found in older literature. Today, most patients with neurologic symptoms have MRIs early in the course of their disease and effective treatments are initiated at a stage that results in a positive clinical outcome.",

The prevalence of this disease in chronic alcoholics is related to losses of sodium due to vomiting or to intestinal sodium loss following treatment with lactulose for hepatic encephalopathy. The acute pathology is characterized by a disruption of compact myelin at the intraperiod line, but macrophage-mediated demyelination and necrosis ensue in the absence of prompt appropriate treatment. Although the pons is characteristically involved, other CNS regions that contain an intermixture of myelinated axons and neuronal nuclei, such as basal ganglia, lateral geniculate nucleus, external capsule and cerebellum, can also be affected (Love et al., 2008) . Radiotherapy and chemotherapy for neoplastic disease can cause white matter pathology (Filley & Kleinschmidt-DeMasters, 2001; Love et al., 2008) . Because both endothelial cells and oligodendrocytes are susceptible to damage by these agents, the pathogenesis of the resulting leukoencephalopathy may be multifactorial.

During Wallerian degeneration in the PNS, there is a rapid loss of myelin-specific lipids and proteins within a week or two, with a concomitant increase in lysosomal enzymes. Between the second and fourth week after nerve section, most of the myelin debris has been removed by Schwann cells and macrophages, and remyelination of regenerating axons begins.

Like the PNS, remyelination is dependent upon production of new myelinating cells (Franklin & ffrench-Constant, 2008) . Oligodendrocytes in the CNS differentiate from progenitor cells named for their expression of the NG2 chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan (NG2 glia). NG2 glia have the ability to proliferate and migrate, and these cells have been identified within chronic MS lesions. NG2 glia differentiate into premyelinating oligodendrocytes, which are multiprocess-bearing cells that express PLP. Premyelinating oligodendrocytes produce myelin internodes when they contact receptive axons. In the demyelinated lesions of MS, many axons are transected or dystrophic (Chang et al., 2002) . Therefore, even if premyelinating oligodendrocytes are present in MS lesions, their ability to produce new myelin may be inhibited because the axons they contact are abnormal. In addition, molecules in the extracellular environment may inhibit proliferation and/differentiation of oligodendrocyte lineage cells (Franklin & ffrench-Constant, 2008) . Finally, as noted above, inducing remyelination could be futile if ongoing demyelination exceeds the capacity for repair. Understanding the role of the different inflammatory infiltrates and associated molecules in MS lesions is important in this regard because most therapies target inflammation, and some aspects of inflammation may promote repair.",

These include increasing the number and differentiation of oligodendrocyte lineage cells, promoting an extracellular environment that promotes myelination, and protecting the health of the demyelinated axons. The number of oligodendrocyte lineage cells could be increased by a variety of growth factors (Ch. 29), such as epidermal growth factor, basic fibroblast growth factor, platelet derived growth factor, ciliary neurotrophic factor and insulin-like growth factor, which are known to affect the survival, proliferation, migration and differentiation of oligodendrocyte progenitors. Alternatively, cells with a capacity to myelinate could be transplanted into specific lesions (cell replacement therapy). A number of candidates have been investigated, including NG2 glia, less differentiated progenitor cells, and other cells with stem cell properties. A number of inhibitors of oligodendrocyte differentiation have been identified, and interference with these inhibitors could create an environment that promotes myelination. For example, LINGO-1 is an oligodendrocyte membrane protein that inhibits oligodendrocyte differentiation and myelination. Antibodies to LINGO-1 promoted remyelination in several models of demyelination.",

Various growth factors are likely to be beneficial in this regard. However, a complicating factor is that myelin contains a number of inhibitors of axonal regeneration (Cao et al., 2010 ) (see Ch. 32). This is important because the highest density of transected axons is present in acute lesions that also contain abundant myelin debris. Three well-characterized molecules, Nogo, MAG and OMgp, function through the same receptor, NgR1, so it may be feasible to block the effects of all three simultaneously.",
