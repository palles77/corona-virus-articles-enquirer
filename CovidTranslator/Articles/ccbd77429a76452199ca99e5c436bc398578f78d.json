In the early stage of the outbreak, the most important question concerns some meaningful milepost moments, including (1) the time when the number of daily confirmed cases decreases, (2) the time when the number of daily confirmed cases becomes smaller than that of the daily removed (recovered and death), (3) the time when the number of daily confirmed cases becomes zero, and (4) the time when the number of patients treated in hospital is zero, which indicates the end of the epidemic. Intuitively, the former two can be regarded as two important turning points which indicate the alleviation of epidemic to some extent, while the latter two as two \"zero\" points, respectively.",

Specifically, for the origin of the virus, (Fan et al., 2019) and (Luk et al., 2019) pointed out that COVID-19 is an infectious disease caused by a virus closely related to SARS-CoV-2, while others believed that the COVID-19 virus was originally derived from wild animals (Huang et al., 2020; Benvenuto et al., 2020) . For the epidemic transmission characteristics, Holshue et al. (2020) and Hui et al. (2020) found that the virus can be transmitted from person to person and that it has a high interpersonal transmission rate. investigated the preliminary estimation of the basic reproduction number R 0 , which ranges 2.24(95%CI : 1.96 \u2212 2.55) to 3.58(95%CI : 2.89 \u2212 4.39) in the early outbreak, while Prasse et al. (2020) estimated it around 2.2, Tang et al. (2020) applied likelihood-based and model-based methods to the analysis of early reported cases, and the results showed that R 0 is as high as 6.47. used the SEIR model and stated that the range of R 0 of COVID-19 is 2.8-3.3, indicating that the early pathogenic transmission capacity of COVID-19 is close to or slightly higher than SARS. Other literatures related R 0 are Anastassopoulou et al. (2020) ; and reference therein.",

For example, SEIR model is a mathematical method relying on an assumption of epidemiological parameters for disease progression, which is absent for the novel pathogen. For instance, the basic infection number R 0 , the daily recovery rate, the characteristics of the disease itself (such as the infection rate and the conversion rate of the latent to the infected), the daily exposure rate of the latent and infected, and their initial population infection status (total 3 population, infected, the initial value of the latent, the susceptible, the healer, etc.) and many other key parameters need to be set. For infectious diseases that have already appeared in the past, or those who have a large amount of data, it is not difficult to obtain these parameters. However, for unknown, sudden and early infectious diseases, obtaining these parameters is full of difficulties, which leads to a great uncertainty and limitations in the prediction of the epidemic situation using the SEIR model.",

First, little prior knowledge can be used to analogize or refer to for a brand new epidemic; secondly, the existence of government management will make the development of the epidemic completely different from that under free development, thus how to incorporate the influence of government measures into the fitting process of parameters and build a statistical model from this should be taken into consideration; thirdly, in the early-outbreak the initial data often fluctuates violently and the data quality is low, thus many commonly used parameter estimation methods are not applicable anymore; furthermore, the amount of data in early stage is too small, so it is difficult to directly rely on the inertia of the data to make forward prediction.

There is also a \"pessimistic\" prediction as a result of the sudden fluctuation of data on Feb 3rd, which predicted that the first zero point would arrive on Mar 17th.

However, there is a prediction result that Z 2 will appear on May 11th, which is far away from other results. The reason for this uncommon result is that the starting point of this forecast is Jan 29th, when the epidemic situation in mainland China beyond Hubei was still in the outbreak period with E t still rising, I t very small, so the prediction result about the finish of the epidemic may not be accurate.",
