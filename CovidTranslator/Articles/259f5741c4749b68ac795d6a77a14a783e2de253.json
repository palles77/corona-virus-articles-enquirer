Fifteen pregnant 3-month-old Wistar rats were separated into 3 groups. On the 15th and 17th day of pregnancy all animals received an intravenous administration of 1 ml of 15 mg of NCs (Group A), 1 ml of 5 mg NCs (Group B) while Control group received 1 ml of 0.9% NaCl. On the 14th and 17th of pregnancy ultrasonography was performed and the parameters evaluated were the width of placenta, the length and width of the embryonic sac, the foetus length and the heart rate. On parturition the number of pups per dam was evaluated. Half of the pups were euthanised the day after parturition and their liver and kidney was histologically evaluated and for the rest of the pups the body growth curve was evaluated until the age of 14 week. At the end of the 14th week the remaining pups were euthanised and their liver and kidney was histologically evaluated. At weaning the dams were euthanised and their liver and kidney was histologically evaluated. Ultrasonography: Baseline measurements of the width of placenta, the length and width of embryonic sac, the foetus length and the heart rate on the 14th day of pregnancy, revealed no statistical significant differences between groups. Comparison of the same values on the 17th day of pregnancy after 2 intravenous administrations of NCs showed no statistical significant effect on the respective parameters. The administration of NCs had no impact on the mean number of pups per dam. Additionally, no impact of the NCs on the body weights of the pups was observed on the 1st day after parturition. Moreover, comparisons between groups, for both sexes showed no difference on growth rate. During the histological evaluation no inflammatory, degenerative or neoplastic lesions were observed as far as the newborn, adult offspring and dams were concerned. According to our results no toxic impact of the low and high doses of the NCs was observed on the parameters selected to be evaluated.",

Many diseases in western societies require long term therapies, especially those of degenerative and neoplastic origin. Long treatments are associated with adverse effects, varying from mild to severe, and often reluctance of patients to further discipline on their schedule (Maningat et al., 2013; Sabat\u00e9; . This is mainly true for cancer regimens, where adverse effects are closely related to their mechanism of action, which is the insult of rapidly multiplying cells. Although this is an intrinsic characteristic of neoplastic cells, they are not the only ones in living organisms possessing it (Chan et al., 2012) .",

Concerns arose about their impact during pregnancy. Under the term nanomaterials a wide variety of diverse small sized object (< 100 nm) is described. Except from efficacy, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.yrtph.2018.07.023 Received 17 April 2018; Received in revised form 24 July 2018; Accepted 25 July 2018 safety is a prerequisite property of materials expected to serve as drug carriers. According to literature there are only few examples about how nanostructured materials may cause toxic phenomena during pregnancy, to the dams and pups. A detailed understanding of the effects of nanoparticles on pregnant animals remains elusive. For example silica and titanium dioxide nanoparticles with diameters of 70 nm and 35 nm respectively, have been already studied, and found to cause complications when injected intravenously into pregnant mice (Yamashita et al., 2011) , while other studies fail to detect any adverse effect of nanoparticles on pregnancy. The aim of the present study was to investigate the potential impact of NCs per se on pregnancy, embryo development and the development of offspring till adulthood on the rat animal model.",

The detailed synthetic procedure of hollow NCs has been previously presented (Efthimiadou et al., 2017; Tapeinos, 2014) . Briefly, the PMMA core synthesis carried out by emulsion polymerisation, MMA (1.18 gr, 1 ml) was added into a 25 ml round flask filled with water (24 ml) and agitated under nitrogen atmosphere. Then a condenser was placed in the flask and temperature was raised at 90\u00b0C. When temperature stabilised at 90\u00b0C, the initiator (KPS) was added (20 mg, 0.5 ml aqua solution) in order for the polymerization process to be initiated. After the KPS addition the solution became cloudy which progressively turned into white. After 3 h, the polymerisation was completed, the white solid was collected by centrifugation (3 \u00d7 10000 rpm for 10 min each). Afterwards, the PMMA core (0.4 g) was suspended in a mixture of water/ethanol (90/10). The mixture was sonicated in an ultrasonic bath for 30 min at 55\u00b0C and was agitated in a magnetic stirrer for 3.5 h at 55\u00b0C, under nitrogen atmosphere. In order to fabricate the multi-stimuli shell, MMA (0.38 ml, 0.46 g), DMAEMA (0.104 ml, 0.0972 g), DVB (0.136 ml, 0.124 g), and PEG360 (0.041ml, 0.045 g), AA (0.043 ml, 0.0455g) were added dropwise and the mixture was agitated for 1 h. When temperature raised at 80\u00b0C, 2 ml aqueous solution of the initiator KPS (32.5 mg) was added. After 10 min of agitation, 1 ml ethanolic solution of Disulfide (0.136 g) was added dropwise. The reaction was completed 18 h later and the product was isolated and purified by centrifugation (3 \u00d7 7000 rpm for 5 min each). During purification process NCs were washed and dispersed in distilled water. The dispersant was mixed with ethylene glucose and agitated for 40 min under nitrogen atmosphere. One ml of aqua solution FeCl 2 . 4H 2 O (0.018 g), 1 ml of aqua solution of HETM (0.188 g) and 1ml KNO 3 (0.027 g) were added. The pH of the solution was adjusted at 9. The reaction completed and the final product was isolated by centrifugation (1 \u00d7 6000 rpm for 5 min and 2 \u00d7 5000 rpm for 5 min) ( Fig. 1 ).",

The animals were obtained from the breeding colony of the animal facility and were being used for the first time for reproduction. The animals were weighed before mating and vaginal smears were obtained in order to define their oestrous cycle. They were caged in pairs in H-Temp Polysulfone type III cages 425 mm long 266 mm wide 185 mm high (Tecniplast, Varese, Italy). On proestrous they were introduced into the cage of a male rat of proven fertility and remained until the day sperm was detected on their vaginal smear. All cytologic examinations were performed by the same person. The day on which sperm was detected, was designated as embryonic day 0 (D0) and they were allocated into 3 groups: group A high dose (n = 5), group B low dose (n = 5) and group C Control (n = 5). At 14th and 17 th day post-coitum pregnant animals were evaluated ultrasonographically. The examination was performed with the animals being restrained in a supine position by an experienced person. Anaesthesia was avoided in order to exclude any complicating factor. Abdominal hair was clipped, in order to achieve full contact of the probe with the skin in the region of interest and acoustic gel (Skintact, Leonard Lang, Innsbruck, Austria) was applied. In this way, the phenomenon of ''grimy acoustic shadow'' was reduced to a minimum and the resolution of ultrasound imaging was greatly improved. The equipment used was a Vivid I ultrasound machine (GE Medical Systems, Tirat Carmel, Israel) with the linear transducer probe 12 L-RS (GE Yokogawa Medical Systems, Tokyo, Japan), which has a variable frequency of 5-13 MHz. To achieve detailed imaging of the reproductive tract and embryos, a frequency of 13 MHz was applied, with one focal zone set at a depth of 0.5-2 cm. The total duration of the examination for each animal was approximately 10 min. Immediately after the end of each study the animals were returned to their cages. The 15 th and 17th day of pregnancy an intravenous injection of NCs was administered by the coccygeal vein (after restraining the animals in a plastic restrainer (Rodent Restrainer MLA5022) and vasodilatation of their lateral coccygeal vein was achieved through immersion of their tail in lukewarm water). Group A was injected with 15 mg/ml of NCs (1 ml), Group B with 5 mg/ml (1 ml) while Control group received 1 ml of 0.9% saline. The intravenous administration was performed by the same experienced person.",

Many of the traditional regimens used against bacteria, are selectively acting, because they target specific and unique features of these cells (Maeda et al., 2009 ). However, tumors cells are extremely challenging to be selectively insulted, because they share substantial similarities with the host's cells. Nanomaterials are very promising, since they have been found to be able to exploit successfully these features. Furthermore, they may serve as appropriate media for spatial and temporal targeted drug delivery. However, increasing interest on nanomaterials has raised major concerns about their safety; especially on vulnerable life stages such pregnancy and foetus development. Studies have shown that some nanomaterials may cross the placenta and cause deleterious effects on fetal growth, while others don't. The size and/or surface charge have been incriminated for these differences.",

In both species the placenta has a discoid shape and belongs to the haemochorial type, while changes, during pregnancy, in blood count and biochemical parameters are closely analogous (Furukawa et al., 2011) . To evaluate the normal development of foetuses during pregnancy, ultrasonographic volumetric parameters were recorded. In humans the method is widely used to provide valuable information about the normal progress of gestation while advances in spatial and temporal resolution have expanded its use in laboratory animal settings (Arleo et al., 2014; Stasinopoulou et al., 2014) . As expected, baseline measurements on 14th day of pregnancy did not reveal any statistical significant difference between groups as far as the placenta width, embryonic sac length and width and fetus length are concerned (Table 1) . On the 17th day of gestation, (after the two intravenous administrations of the NCs) no statistically significant difference on the same parameters was observed in any group (Table 1) . Furthermore, the heart rate of the foetuses was obtained. In canine and feline pregnancy heart rate has been considered an excellent indicator to monitor foetal hypoxia and complications related to growth restriction due to placental insufficiency (Vestegen et al., 1993; Zone and Wanke; 2001) . In the present study no statistical significant differences between groups in the two time points were evident ( Figs. 2 and 3) . Additionally, no irregularity or foetal anomaly during ultrasonography was detected. Although, under the present conditions (no anaesthesia, short time for the animals being restrained) the evaluation of the number of pups was difficult, the aforementioned parameters were evaluated on at least four pups for each dam.",

The body weight curves obtained for both male and female offspring indicate that the administration of different doses of NCs had not significantly affect on both sexes.

The organs selected for histopathological evaluation were the liver and kidneys.
