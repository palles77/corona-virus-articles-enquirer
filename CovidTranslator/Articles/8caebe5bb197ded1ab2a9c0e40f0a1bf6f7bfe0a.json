Because these monoclonal antibodies are produced and tolerized in humans, their safety, efficacy and relevance to human disease are increased compared with antibodies generated in mice or other species. These human monoclonal antibodies are proving invaluable in improving our knowledge of the natural human response to pathogens and for epitope discovery. Human monoclonal antibodies also have a high potential to serve as potent therapeutic tools against a range of infectious and non-infectious diseases. For example, until recently, it was thought that certain single antibodies capable of neutralizing a broad array of evolving viruses, such as influenza virus or HIV strains, were extremely rare and almost impossible to isolate. However, high-throughput technologies, clever screening processes and the careful selection of infected donors have now allowed for the isolation and characterization of several broadly neutralizing monoclonal antibodies. This has led to the discovery of newly appreciated conserved epitopes that could be targeted in antibody-mediated therapy and/or could guide vaccine design.",

Although these latter technologies have generated valuable monoclonal antibodies that are used therapeutically in cancer, metabolic diseases and autoimmune diseases (as reviewed elsewhere [5] [6] [7] , they are beyond the scope of this Review. Here, we summarize the current technologies used to isolate human monoclonal antibodies and describe how these technologies are being applied to understand the natural immune response to influenza virus and HIV. Recent advances in the isolation and characterization of broadly neutralizing human monoclonal antibodies from individuals exposed to these viruses have elegantly illustrated the power and potential of characterizing the natural humoral immune response. The varied approaches used to characterize human monoclonal antibodies specific for influenza virus and HIV provide a cross-section of the technologies being used to study human monoclonal antibodies and of the uses for the knowledge gained. However, these same methods can be used to make therapeutics and improved vaccines for other infectious diseases, such as hepatitis C virus, dengue virus, pneumococcal and staphylococcal bacteria, and any other pathogen that antibodies can control.",

A second common approach is B cell immortalization followed by the screening of in vitro cultures for antibody specificity.

Phage display libraries have been successfully generated using sorted memory B cells and total peripheral blood mononuclear cell populations containing all B cell subtypes, including activated and naive B cells. Memory B cells are the most amenable B cell subset to immortalization and in vitro culture, after which they can be screened for antibody specificity, although it has been recently demonstrated that single plasmablasts can be cultured for a long enough time for them to secrete sufficient amounts of antibody to enable screening for multiple antibody specificities without immortalization 8, 9 . Memory B cells have also been successfully differentiated into antibody-secreting cells without immortalization, and the secreted antibodies are then screened for function and specificity 10 . The detection of specific B cells by flow cytometry requires the expression of immunoglobulins on the cell surface and so has worked well with memory B cells and IgA + mucosal long-lived plasma cells. However, this selection method has been less successful with IgG + plasma cells and plasmablasts in peripheral blood, as these cells have low surface immunoglobulin levels 11 . Because plasmablasts are activated by ongoing immune responses and are therefore enriched for the antibody specificity of interest, this cell type is normally isolated without pre-screening, and antigen-specific human monoclonal antibodies are identified after cloning and expression. Below we provide more detail on these isolation methods, their advantages and disadvantages (TABLE 1) , and the diseases that have been targeted by each of these various approaches (TABLE 2) .",

Thus, with phage display it is not certain that a given heavy and light chain pair went through selection and is selftolerant. However, this random pairing also creates a greater diversity of antibodies, and the shuffling of the heavy and light chain repertoires has been used to generate higher affinity antibodies 13 . Phage display also makes it difficult to draw direct conclusions as to the relative proportion of particular antibody specificities and to gain an understanding of the complete repertoire of antigen-specific B cells. Furthermore, antibody expression in the phage display system may not be the same as in mammalian cells owing to differences in protein folding and post-translational modifications, causing a bias against the isolation of some antibodies. To mitigate this problem to some extent, systems have also been developed in which recombinant antibody fragments are expressed on the cell surface of yeast or mammalian cells, and antigen-specific cells are then selected using flow-based methods 7 . 35 and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) 36 . Three general approaches and variations therein are typically used to isolate monoclonal antibodies from humans. The particular method used depends on various factors but is largely driven by the types of samples obtained. a | Samples with rare specific memory B cells require a higher throughput methodology, such as phage display, to identify the rarest specificities. b | Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-mediated transformation or other B cell immortalization strategies can be used for most samples in which an immunological history is known. c | In instances in which an effective antigen bait is available that will allow for the detection of B cells with specific receptors using flow cytometry, single-cell expression cloning can be used. Finally, if there is an ongoing or recent immune response to vaccination or infection then the population of activated plasmablasts will contain a high frequency of specific cells that can be used to generate abundant human monoclonal antibodies by expression cloning.",

The B cells producing the anti bodies of interest are cloned by limiting dilution and further screened for the desired reactivity at the single-cell level before individual immunoglobulin heavy and light chain pairs are cloned and sequenced 20 . EBV-transformed B cell clones have also been fused with myeloma cells to generate hybridomas, which facilitates the stable production of high levels of antibodies 31,37 .

In the presence of interleukin-21 (IL-21) and CD40 ligand, these transduced cells differentiated into long-lived antibodysecreting cells that still expressed a B cell receptor on the cell surface, thus allowing selection for antigen specificity by flow cytometry and the screening of secreted antibodies.

            "text": "As an alternative to screening antibodies secreted from antigen-specific B cells in vitro, antigen baiting involves the use of fluorescently labelled antigens to first sort antigen-specific B cells by flow cytometry. First used in combination with B cell immortalization 46, 47 , this approach has now been combined to great effect with single-cell expression cloning [48] [49] [50] [51] . The method involves cloning the variable regions that have been amplified from single antigen-specific cells into mammalian expression vectors containing constant region genes; these vectors are then used to transfect HEK293 cells for antibody production and purification 45, 48 . The monoclonal antibodies produced are then tested for antigen specificity and neutralizing capacity. Antigen baiting has been quite successful in obtaining HIV-specific human monoclonal antibodies from the IgG + memory B cell pools of infected donors using HIV-1 envelope spike proteins as probes [52] [53] [54] [55] [56] . Furthermore, because long-lived IgA + plasma cells in the mucosal tissue lining the intestine express immuno globulins on their cell surface 11, 50, 51 , antigen baiting has allowed antigenspecific plasma cells to be isolated from intestinal biopsies to generate rotavirus-specific human monoclonal antibodies from healthy individuals 50 and transglutaminase 2-specific human monoclonal antibodies from patients with coeliac disease 51 . The detection of antigenspecific monoclonal antibodies using flow cytometry is limited to B cell types expressing immuno globulins on the cell surface and by the availability of highly specific and stable antigens to act as probes. However, it allows for very efficient and highly selective isolation of B cells, with 80-90% of the cells sorted by flow cytometry producing immuno globulins with the desired specificity 51, 52 . Although this method primarily screens for binding specificities and not functional characteristics, as exemplified for studies of HIV-specific human monoclonal antibodies (see below), B cells expressing neutralizing antibodies can be preferentially targeted by cleverly designing the antigen probe.",

Although the efficacy of vaccination has traditionally been analysed by testing the polyclonal serum immunoglobulin response, the cloning and expression of the immunoglobulins from plasmablasts at the monoclonal level provides a new level of resolution to the ongoing immune response and can be a valuable source of therapeutically relevant human monoclonal antibodies 33, 45, [57] [58] [59] . The observation that there is a transient, but often large, population of antigenspecific plasmablasts in peripheral blood 5-8 days after vaccination 60-62 created the opportunity to sort and clone the immunoglobulin genes of these plasmablasts, from which the majority of immunoglobulins will be antigen specific, and to use these genes for human monoclonal antibody production 45, 63 . This approach is particularly useful for examining the ongoing immune response to vaccines, because the time of antigen exposure is well defined. For example, this method has been successful for analysing the immune response to influenza, tetanus and anthrax vaccination 45, 57, [63] [64] [65] [66] [67] .

Random cloning of monoclonal antibodies from activated plasmablasts without pre-screening for specificity can also be inefficient if the starting population contains only a few cells that bind to the antigen of interest. Pre-screening does, however, inherently bias the obtainable information about the antibody response to a given pathogen or autoantigen. Thus, isolation and careful characterization of all plasmablasts can provide unexpected and novel insights into the immune response. Finally, various high-throughput technologies are being developed to generate a more comprehensive picture of the human B cell response 69 . All the methods described to this point result in the isolation and characterization of only a small subset of antigen-specific B cells. One promising approach is the use of next-generation sequencing to exhaustively sequence the entire B cell repertoire. By itself, next-generation sequencing can only be used to look at general characteristics of immunoglobulin diversity and usage, as cognate heavy and light chain pairing information is not available. However, the immunoglobulin variable gene sequences derived from next-generation sequencing of a given individual can be mined for B cell sequences that are clonally related to those isolated and characterized using the monoclonal antibody methods described above 70 . This can provide information on the clonal diversity and affinity maturation of antigen-specific B cells. By varying the time point and the B cell population sequenced, the longevity of a particular B cell specificity of interest and the B cell subsets containing that specificity can also be determined 70 . Pairing mass spectrometry data obtained from digested serum antibody fragments with next-generation sequencing information from the antibody-secreting cells has also been used recently to resolve at a monoclonal level the polyclonal serum response, thus characterizing the antibody response at both the cellular and the serological level in the same individual 53, 71 . Microarray technologies are also being developed for functional profiling of antibody-secreting cells at the single-cell level and for epitope mapping of serological responses. These new high-throughput technologies have the potential to increase both our efficiency at producing human monoclonal antibodies and the resolution with which these antibodies can be characterized 69 .",

This screening can be accomplished through phage display, by testing antibodies secreted in in vitro culture systems, or through flow cytometry-based selection from an immune individual. However, if the purpose is first to fully characterize the spectrum of the B cell repertoire responding to a given antigen or in a particular disease, then broader, less selective criteria can be used for cloning human monoclonal antibodies from both memory and antibody-secreting cells. More-random sampling of the human monoclonal antibody repertoire can provide valuable information on both protective and non-protective immune responses to vaccination or infection. This less-selective approach can also be used to characterize novel neutralizing epitopes or to define autoantibodies that arise in autoimmune disease. As human monoclonal antibodies are isolated and characterized, the information gained from these antibodies can inform subsequent studies and allow fine-tuning of the selection criteria used for isolating new relevant human monoclonal antibodies.",

            "text": "The discovery of these broadly neutralizing antibodies prompted the search for and characterization of additional broadly neutralizing human monoclonal antibodies specific for influenza virus. Using B cells from individuals that had received the annual seasonal trivalent influenza vaccine containing H1, H3 and B strains, EBVimmortalized memory B cells with broadly neutralizing specificities were identified by screening for mono clonal antibodies that could neutralize the H5 strain 22 . By screening for neutralization of a viral strain not present in the vaccine, the investigators could identify B cells with antibodies able to bind to regions that are conserved between divergent strains. In this way, 20 independent human monoclonal antibodies that bound to viruses of the H1 and H5 clades were isolated, as well as a few antibodies that recognized H9 clade viruses. All but one of these monoclonal antibodies bound to the stem portion of haemagglutinin, and the one head-binding antibody had a more restricted virus strain neutralization capability. Another study used the novel approach of culturing single plasma cells that were isolated a week after either influenza virus infection or administration of the trivalent vaccine 9 . The authors then screened the single-cell culture supernatants for the presence of immunoglobulins capable of binding to both group 1 and group 2 haema gglutinin. Although the low antibody concentration in the supernatant obtained using this method may preclude the detection of some low-affinity antibodies, sufficient amounts of antibody are generated from high-affinity To maximize the chances of identifying relevant human monoclonal antibodies with both potent and broad reactivity to variant forms of a particular virus or other pathogen, a number of issues must be taken into consideration when the studies are designed. The factors summarized in this figure are detailed within the body text and include the following. a | First, an appropriate cohort must be chosen, such as HIV long-term non-progressors, influenza pandemic survivors, currently or recently infected individuals, vaccinated individuals, and people with a wider breadth or higher potency of serum neutralization than the general population. b | Second, an appropriate methodology must be chosen to generate a library of monoclonal antibodies. c | Third, the relevant resources, reagents and methodologies must be applied to characterize the activity of the antibodies isolated. Examples of such characterizations include: screening for appropriate binding characteristics using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) and surface plasmon resonance; determining the breadth and potency of neutralization activity in vitro; testing the in vivo efficacy of protective antibodies in animal models; and mapping epitopes by escape-mutant analysis, target-antigen mutagenesis, competition assays using monoclonal antibodies of known specificity, functional assays and X-ray crystallography. The space-filling diagram denoting the structure of an antibody Fab fragment bound to influenza virus haemagglutinin exemplifies how epitopes are determined using crystallography. d | The biological information gleaned from analysing the highly unique antibody variable gene sequences can be used to further understand the immune responses, as well as to identify additional antibodies that have similar specificities but that differ in fine specificity and efficacy owing to differentially accumulated immunoglobulin somatic mutations. The graph depicts typical nucleotide sequence data. Viral envelope clones to screen multiple antigens. Using this approach, they were able to identify one antibody that bound to both group 1 and group 2 influenza virus strains 9 . However, the natural emergence of these very broadly neutralizing antibodies appears to be rare, as the antibody that bound to both groups was the only one obtained from among 104,000 plasma cells from 8 different donors previously selected for high heterosubtypic serum antibody titres. Furthermore, this same antibody could not be identified when 20,000 immortalized memory B cells from the same donor were screened 9 . The emergence of the 2009 pandemic H1N1 strain created an interesting situation in which the ability to clone and characterize the specificity of plasmablasts from peripheral blood could be applied. The pandemic H1N1 strain arose from a reassortment of swine and human viral components in which the haemagglutinin and neuraminidase proteins were derived from the swine influenza virus. This H1N1 strain most closely resembled the 1918 pandemic H1N1 virus, with ~20% divergence between the two virus strains at major antigenic sites on the haemagglutinin head. By contrast, there was 50% divergence between the 2009 pandemic H1N1 strain and the most recent seasonal vaccine strain of H1N1 influenza (namely A/Brisbane/10/2007) 77 . Not surprisingly, older individuals, who were more likely to have been exposed to 1918-like strains, had fewer incidents of 2009 pandemic H1N1 influenza infection than younger people. What soon became apparent, however, in analysing the plasmablast response in relatively young individuals exposed to the pandemic H1N1 strain, was that a much higher percentage of responding cells were broadly reactive across the H1 and H5 viral strains. In contrast to the response to pre-pandemic seasonal H1N1 strains, in which antibodies typically bound to the antigenically divergent globular head, antibodies induced by the 2009 pandemic strain bound to the conserved region on the haemagglutinin stem 64 . In addition to the broad reactivity of these antibodies, the immunoglobulin variable region genes from the pandemic H1N1-induced plasmablasts were highly mutated. This indicates that these plasmablasts probably arose from memory B cells with heterosubtypic specificities, which are known to exist at low frequencies owing to past exposure to seasonal H1N1 strains 22 . Taken together, these data indicate that exposure to an antigenically novel strain of influenza virus elicits an antibody response that is biased towards antibodies specific for a more conserved region of haemagglutinin, namely the stem region. This observation provided an important proof of principle that a broadly protective or even a pan-protective antibody response to influenza virus could indeed be elicited with the right immunogen. Subsequent studies have now demonstrated that a similar response can be induced in humans in response to the pandemic H1N1 strain vaccine 78, 79 .",

HIV has been intensely studied since it was first isolated in the 1980s, but an effective vaccine has remained elusive owing to the T cell tropism and the immune evasion capacity of the virus 80 . In particular, the development of broadly neutralizing antibodies to the viral envelope -which contains spikes that are composed of a surface gp120 trimer and a transmembrane gp41 trimer (FIG. 3b) -is impeded by the high variability of the exposed epitopes and the structural inaccessibility of conserved regions owing in part to heavy glycan shielding 81 . Because of the relative difficulty of generating human monoclonal antibodies and the rarity of broadly neutralizing antibodies in infected individuals, until recently only a few naturally occurring broadly neutralizing antibodies specific for conserved regions of HIV had been described 82, 83 . Since 2009, however, a rapid succession of papers describing newly isolated broadly neutralizing antibodies from HIV-infected patients has indicated that potent broadly neutralizing antibodies can be naturally generated. This has provided important insights into the crucial epitopes that might facilitate the development of an HIV vaccine and the ways in which these epitopes might be targeted.",

Next, Simek et al. chose one donor from whom they activated and differentiated ~30,000 IgG + CD19 + memory B cells into antibody-secreting cells. They then screened culture supernatants for antibodies capable of binding to the envelope proteins gp120 and gp41 and for neutralizing activity 10 . In this screen, two broadly neutralizing monoclonal antibodies were isolated that had higher neutralizing activities than any of the other broadly neutralizing antibodies isolated thus far. The binding of the two broadly neutralizing antibodies mapped to a conserved region of the HIV gp120 subunit containing variable loop residues and N-linked glycans 85 . Screening memory B cells from another four infected donors yielded several additional broadly neutralizing antibodies with even more potent broadly neutralizing capabilities that also bound to variable loop epitopes 27 . Corti et al. screened EBV-immortalized memory B cells from 21 HIV-infected donors with neutralizing serum antibodies 26 .

Based on the epitope that is bound by the well-characterized broadly neutralizing antibody b12, which binds to the CD4 binding site on gp120, a stabilized core of gp120 was constructed that contained the major contact sites for CD4, but from which other antigenic regions to which nonneutralizing antibodies bind were removed 55 . Using this resurfaced protein (termed RSC3) and the same protein with a point mutation in the CD4 binding site (\u0394RSC3) as bait, the investigators sorted 29 memory B cells that had specificity for RSC3 but not for \u0394RSC3 from a total of 25 million peripheral blood mononuclear cells from one donor whose serum had been shown to bind to RSC3 during pre-screening. From these individually sorted B cells, they directly amplified and cloned the immunoglobulin heavy and light chain genes and made human monoclonal antibodies. Three of these human monoclonal antibodies (VRC01, VRC02 and VRC03) bound to RSC3, two of which were clonally related. These clones bound gp120 with a relatively high affinity and neutralized an impressive breadth of HIV isolates. The authors later used the same approach with two more donors and identified more potent broadly neutralizing antibodies that likewise bound to the CD4 binding site on gp120 (REF. 56 ).",

This was a highly efficient method, as 86% of the B cells from which monoclonal antibodies were produced were specific for HIV. From the 433 HIV-binding human monoclonal antibodies that were made, 134 were clonally distinct, and 65 of these were neutralizing against a narrow range of HIV isolates, binding to a spectrum of gp120 epitopes. This study demonstrated the wide range of neutralizing epitopes that exist when considering specific HIV isolates. When these human monoclonal antibodies were used as a cocktail at high concentrations, they together neutralized a broad array of HIV isolates, although no single monoclonal antibody had the same neutralizing breadth as the monoclonal antibodies that have been previously described. However, by altering the primers used to amplify the immunoglobulin genes to reproduce the high mutation level of HIV-specific broadly neutralizing antibodies, and by using a more-targeted probe composed of the gp120 core glycoprotein stabilized in the CD4-bound conformation but lacking variable loops 1-3, six clonally distinct broadly neutralizing antibodies were identified 53 . One of the monoclonal antibodies (NIH45-46) was a more potent variant of the VRC01 broadly neutralizing antibody isolated from the same patient using RSC3 as bait 56 .",

The groups mentioned above have gone on to comprehensively study, both at the DNA sequence and the protein structure level, how these antibodies were generated and which features are essential for their potency. For this, Scheid et al. used primers specific for the immunoglobulin variable heavy chain genes of the broadly neutralizing antibody to amplify large numbers of additional cDNA transcripts from related clones from long-lived bone marrow plasma cells of the same HIV-infected donors 53 . This both provided information on the variability and magnitude of clonal variants and tested for the presence of B cells with certain specificities in different B cell effector populations. Wu et al. performed next-generation sequencing on memory B cell cDNA and, by focusing on the same immunoglobulin variable heavy chain genes, obtained thousands of sequences with over 75% identity to the original B cell immunoglobulin genes sorted by flow cytometry 56 . By making monoclonal antibodies from some of these variants and examining their functional characteristics, a remarkable convergence by affinity maturation to conserved residues that are important in neutralizing a wide range of HIV variants was identified 53,56 . At the protein structure level, Diskin et al. compared the structures of VRC01 and NIH45-46 in complex with the HIV gp120, and this led to the in silico design of an antibody with an even greater breadth of neutralizing activity than either of the original forms 86 .",

By using a very specific probe that is designed based on the lessons learnt from previously isolated neutralizing and non-neutralizing monoclonal antibodies, Wu et al. were able to isolate broadly neutralizing antibodies that recognized a highly conserved epitope that is crucial for viral infection 55, 56 . Walker et al. chose to screen for the neutralizing capacity of memory B cells, and not to base their selection on the binding of antibodies to specific regions of the HIV spike 10, 27 . In this way, they obtained broadly neutralizing antibodies that recognized conserved glycan-protein quarternary structures in variable loop regions of gp120 that were thought to be poor targets for broadly neutralizing antibodies owing to their mostly variable residues 27, 85, 87 . By using binding to the HIV spike as the only selection criterion, Scheid et al. and Mouquet et al. did not focus on identifying only the most broadly neutralizing B cells, but instead produced information on the diversity of the epitopes targeted by neutralizing B cells in response to HIV 52, 54 . This widens the list of epitopes that need to be considered when designing vaccine immunogens. It also provides a large dataset from which to glean the common features of HIV-specific antibodies and sets the groundwork for the comparison of B cell responses between individuals with different clinical outcomes.",

However, the isolation of neutralizing human monoclonal antibodies from some individuals does not mean that we can readily induce similar antibodies in all vaccinated individuals. The immune response of individuals can be dramatically affected by various factors, including immune and vaccine history, genetic background, geographical region and ethnicity, diet, concurrent infections and age or other factors that cause them to be immunocompromised. For example, although some individuals clearly responded to the 2009 pandemic H1N1 infection or vaccination with a particularly broad-spectrum response, others in these studies had highly specific responses to the pandemic H1N1 strain 64, 78, 79 . Because the more broadly protective response was probably elicited from memory B cells specific for divergent influenza strains, it is possible that the people with highly targeted responses had few pre-existing memory B cells to influenza virus. In the case of HIV, it has been estimated that 20-30% of infected individuals have broadly neutralizing antibodies 89, 90 . An open question is whether few people develop these antibodies because of differences in the pre-existing B cell repertoire or because of inefficient B cell activation. HIV-specific broadly neutralizing antibodies are for the most part highly mutated and often polyreactive 53, 91 . Therefore the generation of these broadly neutralizing antibodies may require extensive antigen exposure and multiple rounds of hypermutation and affinity maturation. Tolerance mechanisms in some individuals may also prevent these polyreactive B cells from reaching maturity. This will be an important point to determine as vaccination approaches against HIV are explored.",
