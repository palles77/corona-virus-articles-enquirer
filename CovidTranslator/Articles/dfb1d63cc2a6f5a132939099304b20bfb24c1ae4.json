Furthermore, MERS-CoV induced apoptosis through upregulation of Smad7 and fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) expression in both kidney and lung cells. Conversely, knockdown of Smad7 effectively inhibited MERS-CoV replication and protected cells from virus-induced cytopathic effects. We further demonstrated that hyperexpression of Smad7 or FGF2 induced a strong apoptotic response in kidney cells. Common marmosets infected by MERS-CoV developed ARDS and disseminated infection in kidneys and other organs. Smad7 and FGF2 expression were elevated in the lungs and kidneys of the infected animals.

Using a fluorometric assay for apoptotic caspase-3, we detected a strong pro-apoptotic response in MERS-CoV-infected HK2 cells (Fig. 2a) . This was confirmed independently by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labelling assay (Supplementary Fig. 2a) . The elevated expression of caspase-3 in MERS-CoV-infected but not mock-infected cells was further confirmed by western blot analysis (Fig. 2b ). Because our transcriptomic data indicated that the biological pathways related to 'renal necrosis/cell death' were most severely perturbed in MERS-CoV-infected cells (Fig. 1a) , we searched for genes that were most prominently affected for further mechanistic studies of MERS-CoV-induced apoptosis. Several criteria were used to identify genes whose expression was specifically modulated by MERS-CoV infection. First, the expression of the affected genes should be progressively and strongly induced throughout the course of MERS-CoV infection. Moreover, their expression should not be restricted only to the lung; they should also be expressed in the kidney. Finally, the expression of the selected genes should be markedly induced by MERS-CoV, but not SARS-CoV, infection (see Methods for details). We selected Smad7 and FGF2, as their expression was most prominently affected when compared with the expression of other deregulated genes not directly related to apoptosis such as clusterin (CLU), superoxide dismutase (SOD1) or catalase (CAT) (Fig. 2c and Supplementary Fig. 3 ). It should be noted that genes that encode inhibitors of apoptosis, such as baculoviral IAP repeat-containing protein3 (BIRC3), could also play a regulatory role in MERS-CoV biogenesis ( Supplementary  Fig. 3b,c) . Intuitively, the anti-apoptotic activities of BIRC3 may play contributory roles in the early stage of MERS-CoV replication. Moreover, a recent study demonstrated that BIRC3 is required for efficient propagation of the baculovirus Bombyx mori nucleopolyhedrovirus through an unknown mechanism 11 . Further study will be required to dissect the function(s) of BIRC3 in MERS-CoV replication. Previous reports suggested that Smad7 is significantly associated with renal disease pathogenesis by inducing apoptosis 12, 13 in mesangial cells and podocytes through caspase 3-dependent 14 and -independent pathways 15 , respectively. More recently, the apoptotic role of Smad7 has been further demonstrated in hepatocarcinogenesis through the attenuation of NF\u03baB and TGF\u03b2 signalling 16 . Similarly, FGF2 induces podocyte injury and glomerulosclerosis in mouse and rat models 17, 18 . The roles of Smad7 and FGF2 in MERS-CoV-induced apoptosis not only in kidneys but also in lungs were supported by their elevated expression in both MERS-CoV-infected HK2 (Fig. 2b ,d,e) and Calu-3 cells ( Supplementary  Fig. 3a) . Furthermore, we demonstrated that overexpression of Smad7 and FGF2 in uninfected kidney cells induced apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner ( Supplementary Fig. 2b ).",

We first knocked down Smad7 mRNA in HK2 cells using siRNAs (Smad7-1 siRNA and Smad7-2 siRNA), which reduced the expression of Smad7 by about 75% at protein levels ( Fig. 3a , left top) and about 40% at RNA levels ( Fig. 3a , right top). The effect of Smad7 expression on MERS-CoV-induced apoptosis was further determined by measuring caspase-3 level and activity. Whereas MERS-CoV infection potently induced caspase-3 expression and activity, both were restored to levels similar to that of mock infection control when Smad7 was knocked down (Fig. 3a) . Separately, we administrated a small-molecule inhibitor, tyrphostin AG1296, which specifically blocks tyrosine kinase activity of the FGF receptor, to study the effect of FGF2 on MERS-CoV-induced apoptosis. Blockage of the downstream signalling of FGF2 dampened MERS-CoV-induced apoptosis by around 40% (Fig. 3b, top) . However, control inhibitor tyrphostin AG490, which inhibits the epidermal growth factor receptor, failed to counteract MERS-CoV-induced apoptosis. The requirement of FGF2 for MERS-CoV-induced apoptosis was further validated by sequestration of secreted FGF2 using anti-FGF2 neutralizing antibodies.",

Although drugs specifically targeting Smad7 are currently unavailable, suppression of Smad7 expression using antisense oligonucleotides has been successfully applied in clinical trials to treat inflammatory bowel disease, with no major side effects 19, 20 . To test whether an antisense oligonucleotide targeting Smad7 (anti-Smad7 oligo) could suppress MERS-CoV-induced apoptosis and inhibit virus replication, we treated both HK2 and Calu-3 cells with anti-Smad7 oligo before challenge with MERS-CoV. Intriguingly, cells treated with anti-Smad7 oligo showed a dose-dependent reduction in apoptosis. Cell protection assay by methylthiazolyldiphenyl-tetrazolium (MTT) showed that anti-Smad7 oligo protected 50% of cells from MERS-CoV-induced apoptosis at concentrations of 0.432 \u03bcg ml -1 and 0.965 \u03bcg ml -1 in HK2 and Calu-3 cells, respectively (Fig. 3c ). Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) revealed that virus production was inversely proportional to the concentration of the administrated anti-Smad7 oligo (Fig. 3d) . These data were consistent with the results obtained from plaque assays that measured the amount of infectious virus. In anti-Smad7 oligo-treated HK2 cells, we observed a 1.4 log reduction in virus production ( Supplementary Fig. 4) . The strong protective effect of anti-Smad7 oligo against MERS-CoV-induced apoptosis and virus production makes it a potential treatment option for MERS. Furthermore, we determined the viral loads of culture supernatants, positive-strand and negative-strand viral RNAs in cell lysates and viral proteins at different time points in MERS-CoV infected HK2 cells with Smad7 or control siRNAs ( Supplementary Fig. 5) . The viral load of culture supernatant was significantly reduced with Smad7 siRNA at 12 hours post infection (h.p.i.), which suggested that Smad7 siRNA interfered with the step of virus release in the replication cycle. The important role of apoptosis on the viral replication cycle was further demonstrated by the treatment of infected HK2 cells by etoposide, an apoptosis-inducing drug, which increases virus production, and by MDIVI, an apoptosis inhibitor that suppresses virus production ( Supplementary Fig. 6 ).",

More recently, another nonhuman primate model using common marmosets was established, which recapitulated the severe and sometimes lethal respiratory symptoms with disseminated extra-pulmonary infection seen in MERS patients 22 . We thus challenged a group of six common marmosets with MERS-CoV using our previous infection protocol 22 . We observed that all MERS-CoV-inoculated common marmosets developed ARDS, with one death due to severe illness ( Supplementary Fig. 7) . Successful infection was confirmed by the detection of viral RNA and antigen in all lung samples collected from MERS-CoV-inoculated common marmosets (Fig. 4a and Supplementary Fig. 8a,b) . Consistent with the clinical findings in humans, a high viral load could be detected in the lungs of the infected animals, whereas no virus RNA could be detected in the control uninfected animal (Supplementary Fig. 8a ). Histopathological examination of the lungs also revealed extensive broncho-interstitial pneumonia ( Supplementary  Fig. 8b,c) . We further investigated the relationship of the abundance of MERS-CoV and the expression of Smad7 and FGF2. Remarkably, the results showed a good correlation of the amounts of MERS-CoV RNA with the expression levels of Smad7 and FGF2 ( Fig. 4a and Supplementary Fig. 9 ). These findings were consistent with our ex vivo human organ culture and cell line models data, in which MERS-CoV mediates apoptosis through the induction of Smad7 and FGF2. Notably, viral RNA and antigen were also detected in four of six common marmosets' kidneys ( Fig. 4b and Supplementary Fig. 8a) . Intriguingly, the infected kidney samples displayed characteristic histological features of acute kidney injury with mitochrondrial shortening and fragmentation (AKI) (Fig. 4c,  Supplementary Figs 10 and 11) . While the development of AKI could be attributed partially to the septic shock of severe infection, the detection of viral RNA and antigen in the kidney samples (Fig. 4b, Supplementary Figs 8a and 11 ) raised the distinct possibility that MERS-CoV may cause direct damage to the infected kidneys. We also observed co-localization of MERS-CoV NP with caspase-3, Smad7 and FGF2 in renal tubular and lung epithelial cells, which was consistent with our cellular model in which MERS-CoV induced a direct cytopathic effect by apoptosis mediated through the upregulation of Smad7 and FGF2 (Fig. 4b, Supplementary Figs  2 and 8b) . Taken together, our in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo results support the notion that Smad7 and FGF2 may play important roles in the pathogenesis of MERS-CoV-induced lung and kidney damage.",

            "text": "Annual outbreaks of MERS in Middle East or other countries have been associated with a high mortality rate of over 30%, which is more than three times that of SARS 2 . Although both MERS and SARS patients died with multi-organ failure, MERS-CoV appears to have broader tissue tropism. We have previously demonstrated that MERS-CoV infection can induce apoptosis in T cells by a, Quantitative measurement of MERS-CoV RNA in the lungs of MERS-CoV-inoculated common marmosets. Samples were divided into three categories (1.9 \u00d7 10 5 \u00b1 9.9 \u00d7 10 4 ; 1.6 \u00d7 10 6 \u00b1 5.2 \u00d7 10 5 ; 2.6 \u00d7 10 6 \u00b1 1.7 \u00d7 10 6 ) based on the viral load (top). The relative expression levels of Smad7 (middle) and FGF2 (bottom) are indicated. All values were normalized to GAPDH. Statistical significance was evaluated by Student's t-tests and P values are indicated. Error bars represent the mean \u00b1 s.d. of three selected tissue samples. b, Co-immunohistochemical staining of MERS-CoV NP, caspase-3, Smad7 and FGF2 in kidneys of MERS-CoV-inoculated common marmosets. All co-immunohistochemical staining was performed on the same slide, except Smad7 and MERS-CoV NP, which were stained on separate slides, and the overlay view was generated using two neighbouring slides. The specificity of anti-MERS-CoV antibodies was confirmed by overnight pre-incubation with a fivefold more concentrated MERS-CoV NP peptide before their application to the kidney sections. The central image in the bottom panel represents the background signal detected after inoculation of rabbit secondary antibodies. Nuclei counterstained by DAPI are shown in blue. c, Haematoxylin and eosin staining of kidney sections of MERS-CoV-inoculated common marmosets. Interstitial infiltration was observed in the infected kidneys (arrow heads). Characteristic histological features of acute kidney injury, including flattened epithelial cells (arrows) and peritubular capillary congestion (white arrows), were detected in the kidney sections of MERS-CoV-inoculated common marmosets. Images shown in b and c are representatives of the four common marmosets' kidneys in which the MERS-CoV RNAs were detected (Supplementary Fig. 8a) . D, dilated renal tubules; PC, protein cast. activating both the extrinsic and intrinsic apoptosis pathways through an unknown mechanism 23 . Here, we show that the direct cytopathic effect of MERS-CoV is mediated through the induction of the expression of pro-apoptotic cellular proteins, Smad7 and FGF2, in infected lung and kidney cells. Recent work has demonstrated the pro-apoptotic role of Smad7 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) through the attenuation of NF\u03baB and TGF\u03b2 signalling 16 . These findings were in line with the idea that deregulated expression of Smad7 could be associated with renal pathogenesis 12,13 through the induction of caspase 3-dependent 14 and -independent apoptosis 15 in a cell-type specific manner. Despite the fact that Smad7 plays important regulatory roles in TGF\u03b2 signalling 16 , distinct mechanisms of action have been proposed for Smad7-and TGF\u03b2-induced apoptosis. It has been suggested that Smad7 mediates apoptosis through the inhibition of cell survival factor NF-\u03baB, whereas TGF\u03b2 induces apoptosis by activation of the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase p38. Overall, our results, together with previous reports, support the notion that the expression levels of both Smad7 and TGF\u03b2 should be tightly regulated. Different pathological conditions, including viral infection in different cell types, could abruptly alter the expression level of Smad7 or TGF\u03b2, which may result in apoptosis. Meanwhile, FGF2 has been reported to induce apoptosis by altering the expression levels of apoptosis regulator and activating the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway 24 . Further studies are warranted for the dissection of Smad7-and FGF2-induced apoptotic pathways on MERS-CoV infection. The unique cellular response of apoptosis induced by MERS-CoV, which results in virus release, may indicate an atypical mechanism of action for coronavirus replication. This highlights a possibility that the apoptotic process not only facilitates virus release and dissemination, but may also contribute to tissue damage, which may lead to ARDS and renal failure. These insights into the pathogenesis of MERS-associated organ damage may help to expand the limited anti-MERS treatment options identified by drug repurposing programmes or de novo development so far 22, [25] [26] [27] . Potential intervention strategies counteracting Smad7 and FGF2 expression and/or signalling with various agents such as siRNAs, small-molecule inhibitors of FGF receptor tyrosine kinase and anti-Smad7 oligonucleotides may improve the outcome of MERS.",

Infections of all dishes of cells were performed simultaneously using a master mix of MERS-CoV or SARS-CoV to minimize variation. At the indicated time points, total RNAs of the infected cells were collected. The altered gene expression following MERS-CoV or SARS-CoV infection at different time points were then compared with those at time point zero. The samples from time point zero were subjected to the corresponding virus inoculation, then immediately washed and immediately harvested to ensure that the detected gene alteration was not due to the virus inoculation process. The sequencing libraries were prepared at the Centre for Genomic Sciences at the University of Hong Kong using the TruSeq Stranded mRNA Sample Prep Kit (Illumina) and were subsequently sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 2000. Briefly, mRNA was isolated using polyT oligo-attached magnetic beads. The purified mRNA was fragmented and reverse transcribed using SuperScript II Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen) to first-strand cDNA in the presence of random hexamers. Double-stranded cDNAs were synthesized by second strand synthesis and then subjected to end repair, 3\u2032 adenylation and indexed adaptor ligation. The adaptor-ligated sequencing libraries were further enriched by ten cycles of PCR, quantified and sequenced on a HiSeq 2000 with 101 bp pairedend reads. Image analyses and base calling were performed with SCS2.8/RTA1.8 (Illumina). FASTQ file generation and the removal of failed reads were performed using CASAVA ver.1.8.2 (Illumina). Pathway analyses were performed using the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis software. Candidate genes from a defined disease pathway (renal necrosis/cell death) that possessed the following criteria were selected for further analyses: (1) the absolute gene expression level should be markedly induced; (2) the trend of gene expression should be consistent throughout the course of infection; (3) the tissue-specificity of the identified genes should not be restricted only to lung, but should be expressed in kidney; (4) a differential response of the gene expression pattern should be observed when infected with MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, separately.",

Briefly, cells were plated in six-well dishes, cultured, collected and lysed in lysis buffer at 0, 8, 24, 48 and 72 h.p.i. After the protein concentration was normalized by the Bradford assay, the lysates were incubated with the same amounts of reaction buffer and 50 mmol l -1 DEVD-AFC substrate for 2 h at 37\u00b0C. Fluorescence was monitored with an excitation wavelength of 400 nm and an emission wavelength of 505 nm. Apoptosis in cells that were infected by MERS-CoV or SARS-CoV or transfected with overexpression constructs Smad7 (Origene) or FGF2 (Origene) were measured by ApopTag Red In Situ Apoptosis Detection Kit (Chemicon). Briefly, treated cells on the coverslips were fixed with 1% paraformaldehyde. Cells undergoing apoptosis with DNA breakage will be labelled with TdT enzyme in the presence of digoxigennin-modified nucleotides. The coverslips were then mounted on the slides in the presence of VECTASHIELD Antifade mounting medium with DAPI (Vector lab). Signal detection was facilitated by the addition of anti-digoxigenin conjugate followed by examination under a fluorescence microscopy (NIKON Eclipse Ni-U) with SPOT RT3 camera.",

Red line: the most significant -log(P value) of the most perturbed biological pathway by SARS-CoV. The -log(P value) is calculated based on the hypergeometric distribution (right-tailed Fisher's exact test) of a gene of interest that can be found in a molecular network over that of a randomly selected gene. Data were derived from two independent experiments. b, Ex vivo human kidney cultures were inoculated with either MERS-CoV or SARS-CoV. The MERS-CoV-inoculated human kidneys were cryosectioned at 24 h post inoculation (top). NP of MERS-CoV was immunostained by specific antibodies (green, left). The kidneys were co-stained with cell-type-specific antibodies against cytokeratin 18 (CK18), CD31 and synaptopodin (red, middle). Co-localization of viral antigens with cellular markers is shown in yellow (right). Nuclei counterstained by DAPI are shown in blue. Representative images from three independent experiments are shown. Total RNAs of MERS-CoV-inoculated (left, lanes 1-5) and SARS-CoV-inoculated (right, lanes 1-5) human kidneys samples were collected at the indicated time points post infection (bottom). Viral RNAs were detected by RT-qPCR as described previously 6 . MERS-CoV-infected HK2 (left, '+', lane 6) and SARS-CoV-infected Calu-3 samples (right, '+', lane 6) were included as positive controls. Mock-treated HK2 (left, '-', lane 7) and Calu-3 (right, '-', lane 7) samples were included as negative controls. Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) mRNA was also detected as a loading control. c, Conditioned medium (left) and cell lysate (right) of MERS-CoV-infected (M) and SARS-CoV-infected (S) HK2 and NHMC cells were collected 24 h post inoculation and the viruses were quantified using TCID 50 assays as described 6 .

Arrows point to SMAD7 and FGF2, which were selected for further study. d, The relative expression of Smad7 (left) and FGF2 (right) mRNA was measured using RT-qPCR. e, Quantitative measurement of secreted FGF2 was performed using an anti-FGF2 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit. Statistical significance was evaluated by Student's t-tests and P values are shown in a,d,e. Except for c, all samples were harvested at 24 h.p.i. for measurements.

Control siRNA-transfected (lane 3) and mock-infected (lane 4) cells were analysed. Left panels: protein expression of Smad7 and cleaved caspase-3. \u03b3-Tubulin was detected as a loading control. Right panels: mRNA levels of Smad7 normalized to GAPDH and the relative apoptotic activities of the MERS-CoV-infected cells. b, FGF2 inhibition by a small-molecule compound or antibodies. Caspase-3 activities in MERS-CoV-infected HK2 cells were measured when FGF2 signalling was blocked with a small-molecule inhibitor AG1296 (top, lane 1). AG490 (top, lane 2), which blocks epidermal growth factor but not FGF2 signalling, and untreated MERS-CoV-infected cells (top, lane 3) served as negative and mock controls, respectively. Caspase-3 expression was determined in MERS-CoV-infected HK2 cells treated with anti-FGF2 neutralizing antibodies (bottom, lane 1) or irrelevant IgG (bottom, lane 2). Mock-infected cells were assessed (bottom, lane 3). \u03b3-Tubulin was detected as the loading control. c, Cell protection by anti-Smad7 oligonucleotide against MERS-CoV-induced cytotoxicity in HK2 (dark diamonds) and Calu-3 (grey squares) cells when compared with that of untreated MERS-CoV infected cell lines. d, The antiviral activity of anti-Smad7 oligonucleotide was measured by comparing the levels of viral load from the MERS-CoV-infected cell extracts. All statistical significance was evaluated by Student's t-tests (P) and Pearson's correlation analyses (r). Images shown in a and b are representative of three independent experiments.
