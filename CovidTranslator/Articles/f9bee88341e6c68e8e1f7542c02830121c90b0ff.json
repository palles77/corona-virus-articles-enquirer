After discordant analysis, 123 specimens gave concordant results using the FA RP and the NxTAG RPP for an overall agreement of 93.9% (kappa = 0.88 [95% CI 0.80-0.96]), a positive percent agreement of 93.7% (95% CI 83.7-97.7) and a negative percent agreement of 94.1% (95% CI 84.9-98.1). In conclusion, the BioFire FilmArray RP performed reliably to detect a broad range of respiratory pathogens in bronchoscopy specimens.",

Diagnosis of suspected LRT infection in immunocompromised hosts is particularly challenging due to the broad range of viral, bacterial and other infectious and noninfectious etiologies presenting in a similar fashion (Bajaj and Tombach 2017) . The rapid detection of infectious causes can lead to diagnostic clarity, targeted and timely therapy and implementation of infection control practices to limit transmission (Kim et al. 2007) .",

The BioFire FilmArray Respiratory Panel (FA RP) is one such fully automated method that simultaneously detects 17 respiratory viruses and 3 bacterial targets (Poritz et al. 2011 ).

            "text": "The results of this study demonstrate that the BioFire FA RP can reliably detect a broad range of respiratory pathogens when performed using specimens collected by bronchoscopy. Thus far, the majority of studies evaluating the performance of the FA RP were done using NP swabs (Andersson et al. 2014; Babady et al. 2018; Butt et al. 2014; Hayden et al. 2012; Kaku et al. 2018; Loeffelholz et al. 2011; Pierce et al. 2012; Renaud et al. 2012; Van Wesenbeeck et al. 2013) . Only a few studies have included LRT specimens, such as BAL and BAS, in addition to URT samples. Azadeh et al. found that testing of BAL specimens with the FA RP increased the diagnostic yield in immunocompromised patients with an initial negative NP swab (Azadeh et al. 2018 ). In the Additionally, they determined that the limit of detection (LOD) of FA RP on LRT specimens was either lower or very similar to the LOD on NP swabs for all targets (Ruggiero et al. 2014) . However, all of these studies were done on archived samples only and were limited by the small number of LRT samples included and low coverage of FA RP targets in the clinical samples tested. To our knowledge, this is the largest study to date that investigated performance of the FA RP on archived and prospectively collected bronchoscopy specimens. We found a high positivity rate of 33% in prospectively collected bronchoscopy specimens from immunocompromised and hospitalized patients during influenza season. This finding is consistent with studies by Azadeh et al. where a similarly high positivity rate was noted for the FA RP when testing BAL in immunocompromised hosts (Azadeh et al. 2015; Azadeh et al. 2018) . While syndromic molecular testing can increase sensitivity for detection of respiratory pathogens, these tests cannot distinguish between colonized and infected patients; therefore it is important to perform these tests only in patients with appropriate clinical indication. Furthermore, results need to be interpreted with caution in immunosuppressed patients where prolonged shedding is known to occur (Charlton et al. 2019) .",

Other studies confirmed high agreement between the FA RP and various versions of the Luminex respiratory panel on NP swabs (Chan et al. 2017; Chen et al. 2016; Popowitch et al. 2013; Tang et al. 2016) . A few studies, which have included NP swabs and a limited number of BW and BAL, found that FA RP detected more viruses than the Luminex method (Babady et al. 2012; Rand et al. 2011) . It was not mentioned if there was a difference in test performance between BAL and NP swabs. In this study, there was no significant difference in the number of viruses detected by either system. To our knowledge a direct comparison of FA RP and NxTAG RPP has not been done on lower respiratory specimens.",

Couturier et al. noted that the LOD of FA RP compared to their lab developed tests was much higher (N2.5 log difference) for AdV than other viral targets (Couturier et al. 2013) . However, these studies used an earlier version of FA RP with decreased sensitivity of AdV due to limited coverage of some AdV serotypes [FilmArray v 1.6 package insert]. The FA RP assay has since been revised and the modified FA RP version 1.7 has demonstrated increased sensitivity for AdV and improved AdV serotype coverage (Andersson et al. 2014; Doern et al. 2013) . With the updated FA RP version 1.7 used in this study we did not observe any significant differences in the performance for AdV between the 2 multiplex assays. Only 1 of 3 AdV results remained discordant and was considered to be a false negative by FA RP. While we noted 2 discordant results for Inf A H3, the overall performance of the FA RP for influenza A had good agreement with NxTAG RPP. Due to the low number of various influenza subtypes it is difficult to draw any conclusion on influenza A subtype performance.",

As there are limitations associated with the selection of archived specimens, prospectively collected specimens have been included in this study to mitigate these effects. Furthermore, the FA RP provides only a qualitative detection of target presence and the discordant analysis is limited by the lack of any quantitative information.
