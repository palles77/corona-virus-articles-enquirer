The objective of this study was to investigate the use of chloroquine (CLQ) as an antiviral drug against dengue virus in monkeys. To analyze the action of the drug in vivo, nonhuman primates groups (Aotus azarai infulatus) were inoculated with a subcutaneous injection of a virulent strain of DENV-2, treated and untreated CLQ. Blood hematological, viremia, and serum biochemical values were obtained from 16 DENV-2-inoculated, treated and untreated; four received only CLQ and one mock-infected Aotus monkeys. Monkey serum samples (day 0-10 post-inoculation) were assayed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and Cytometric Bead Array for determination of viremia and inflammatory cytokines, respectively. Additionally, body temperature and activity levels were determined. In the present work, CLQ was effective on replication of DENV-2 in Aotus monkeys; a time viremia reduction was observed compared with the controls. The concentration of tumor necrosis factor alpha and interferon gamma in the serum of the animals had a statistically significant reduction in the groups treated with CLQ after infection compared with the controls. A significant decrease in systemic levels of the liver enzyme aspartate aminotransferase (AST) was also observed in the animals treated with CLQ after infection compared with the controls. These results suggest that CLQ interferes in DENV-2 replication in Aotus monkeys.",

DENV has a positive-sense, singlestranded RNA genome of approximately 11 kb in length that encodes an open reading frame (ORF) of nearly 10,200 nucleotides processed by proteases of viral and cellular origin into three structural proteins-capsid (C), premembrane (PrM), and envelope (E)-and seven nonstructural proteins-NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, and NS5-that are required for replication of the virus (3, 21) . The four serotypes are transmitted to humans and other higher primates by infected Aedes spp. mosquitoes (7) . Dengue virus causes the most important arthropod-borne viral disease in the world, characterized by a wide spectrum of clinical manifestations ranging from a flu-like disease (dengue fever) to a life-threatening disease known as dengue hemorrhagic fever/ dengue shock syndrome (DHF/DSS). The only available way to control dengue is vector control, since no licensed vaccine or effective antiviral therapy is currently available for DENV infections.",

The E glycoprotein is a major surface protein of the virus and is responsible for attachment and entry. The envelope (E) and precursor membrane (prM) proteins are major structural-protein targets of the antibody response in dengue infection. The lipid composition of the viral envelope is dictated by the composition of the host cell membrane from which the virus emerge. Two types of virions are known: the mature extracellular virions, containing the M protein, and the immature intracellular virions, containing the precursor M (prM), which is proteolitically cleaved during maturation for the production of M glycoprotein (26, 31) . Dengue viruses enter the target cells via receptor-mediated endocytosis through the direct interaction of viral E glycoprotein with host cell receptors, including DC-specific ICAM-3-grabbing non-integrin (DC-SIGN) and the mannose receptor, followed by acidic pH-dependent fusion with the membrane of the endocytic vesicle (22, 24, 25, 37) .",

Hematological Parameters Expressed as the Mean there was a statistically significant reduction in viral load, whereas the patients had undetectable levels of viral DNA and an increase in TCD4 + cell count (15) . Studies have supported the hypothesis that CLQ may have an application in preventing the transmission of HIV from mother to child through breast milk. These studies reported an accumulation of CLQ 234 times in colostrum cells of HIV-infected African mothers who took CLQ 100 mg per day, suggesting that the drug may be potentially active as an adjunct to antiviral prophylaxis postnatal transmission from mother to child, by decreasing the burden of HIV-1 in breast milk in geographic areas where transmission is higher (20) . Onlamoon et al. (28) observed a peak of dengue viremia in infected rhesus monkeys from 3 to 7 days after infection. Regarding the biochemical parameters, a decrease in the level of liver enzyme AST was observed in serum of animals treated with CLQ compared with the positive control by the fifth and sixth days after infection ( Fig. 2A) . No change was found in hematological parameters in the animals infected with DENV-2. The animals monitored did not show any other change in weight or temperature during the experiment. Similar results were observed by Onlamoon et al. (28) where the animals did not show any other apparent clinical symptoms, such as fever, inappetence, or lethargy.",

Preliminary results obtained from this study show that CLQ suppresses TNF-a and IFN-c production, and it was hypothesized that CLQ may be used to treat patients suspected of having dengue disease, avoiding a severe form of the disease (dengue hemorrhagic fever) and/or shock (dengue shock syndrome). A recent study showed that chloroquine promoted a reduction in the intensity of pain and an improvement in the well-being of patients with dengue infection, but did not alter the duration of the disease or the intensity and days of fever. These results suggest that CLQ should be further tested in dengue disease with a larger number of patients and different CLQ dosages and times of administration to confirm the drug's clinical effect and to assess the side effects of CLQ in dengue patients (4) .",

The absence of IgG antibodies specific to antidengue serum of animals that received CLQ before infection demonstrates the efficacy of this drug in the prophylactic treatment. In the group of animals that were treated with CLQ after infection, some individual responses were observed, showing that the drug was also effective in the therapeutic treatment of those animals. Therefore, this model of NHP infection by DENV cannot only provide a valuable tool for the detailed study of this virus infection, but also can provide a comprehensive analysis of virus-host interactions, with the potential to lead to identification of cellular and molecular mechanisms that lead to dengue fever and the replication of this virus. Taken together with the data obtained in these studies, these results suggest that CLQ interferes in DENV-2 virus replication in Aotus monkeys. However, being a relatively safe drug, effective and easy to purchase, used in the treatment of many diseases, including malaria, its therapeutic use is promising because it has been shown that this drug has a significant inhibitory antiviral effect on the replication of DENV-2.",
