In the large coronavirus family, comprising enveloped positive-strand RNA viruses, SARS-CoV-2 is the seventh encountered strain that causes respiratory disease in humans (3) ranging from mild --the common cold --to severe --the zoonotic Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV). As of March 2020, there are in excess of 340,000 presumed or confirmed cases of coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) worldwide, with total deaths exceeding 14,000 (4) . While age and many comorbid health conditions, including cardiovascular and pulmonary disease, appear to increase the severity and mortality of COVID-19 (5-10) , approximately 80% of infected individuals have mild symptoms (11) . As with SARS-CoV (12, 13) and MERS-CoV (14, 15) , children in particular seem to have low susceptibility to the disease (16-18) ; despite similar infection rates as adults (19) only 5.9% of pediatric cases are severe or critical, possibly due to lower binding ability of the ACE2 receptor in children or generally higher levels of antiviral antibodies (20) . Other similarities (21-23) including genomic (24, 25) and immune system response (26-34) between SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses (35) , especially SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, are topics of ongoing active research, results of which may inform an understanding of the severity of infection (36) and improve the ongoing work of immune landscape profiling (37) (38) (39) (40) (41) and vaccine discovery (30, 39, [42] [43] [44] [45] [46] [47] [48] .",

For instance, disease caused by the closely-related SARS-CoV (24, 25) shows increased severity among individuals with the HLA-B*46:01 genotype (1) . Associations between HLA genotype and disease severity extend broadly to several other unrelated viruses including human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1), where certain HLA types (e.g. HLA-A*02:05) may reduce risk of seroconversion (49) , and dengue virus, where certain HLA alleles (e.g. HLA-A*02:07, HLA-B*51) are associated with increased secondary disease severity among ethnic Thais (50) .",

We hypothesize that individual HLA genotypes may differentially induce the T-cell mediated antiviral response, and could potentially alter the course of disease and its transmission. In this study, we performed a comprehensive in silico analysis of viral peptide-MHC class I binding affinity, across 145 different HLA types, for the entire SARS-CoV-2 proteome.",

We then removed from further consideration 16,138 peptides that were not predicted to enter the MHC class I antigen processing pathway via proteasomal cleavage. For the remaining 32,257 peptides, we repeated binding affinity predictions for a total of 145 different HLA types, and we show here the SARS-CoV-2-specific distribution of per-allele proteome presentation (predicted binding affinity threshold <500nM, Figure 1 , Supplementary Table  S1 ). Importantly, we note that the putative capacity for SARS-CoV-2 antigen presentation is unrelated to the HLA allelic incidence in the population (Figure 1 ). We identify HLA-B*46:01 as the HLA allele with the fewest predicted binding peptides for SARS-CoV-2. We performed the same analyses for the closely-related SARS-CoV proteome (Supplementary Figure S1 ) and similarly note that HLA-B*46:01 was predicted to present the fewest SARS-CoV peptides, in keeping with previous clinical data associating this allele with severe disease (1) . Supplementary Table S1 ) that putatively bind to each of 145 HLA alleles is shown as a series of horizontal bars, with dark and light shading indicating the number of tightly (<50nM) and loosely (<500nM) binding peptides respectively, and with green, orange, and purple colors representing HLA-A, -B, and -C alleles, respectively. Alleles are sorted in descending order based on the number of peptides they bind (<500nM). The corresponding estimated allelic frequency in the global population is also shown (to left), with length of horizontal bar indicating absolute frequency in the population.",

After aligning reference proteome sequence data for 5 essential viral components (ORF1ab, S, E, M, and N proteins, which together comprise the vast majority of the SARS-CoV-2 proteome) across 34 distinct alphaand betacoronaviruses, including all known human coronaviruses, we identified 48 highly conserved amino acid sequence spans (Appendix 1). Among these conserved sequences, 44 SARS-CoV-2 sequences would each be anticipated to generate at least one component 8-12mer linear peptide epitope also present within at least one other common human coronavirus (Supplementary Table S2 , Figure 2 ). In total, 564 such 8-12mer peptides were found to share 100% identity with corresponding OC43, HKU1, NL63, and 229E sequences (467, 460, 179, and 157 peptides, respectively) (Supplementary Table S3 ). For the subset of these potentially cross-protective peptides that are anticipated to be generated via the MHC class I antigen processing pathway, we performed binding affinity predictions across 145 different HLA-A, -B, and -C alleles. As above, we demonstrate the SARS-CoV-2-specific distribution of per-allele presentation for these conserved peptides. We found that alleles HLA-A*02:02, HLA-B*15:03, and HLA-C*12:03 were the top presenters of conserved peptides. Conversely, we note that 56 different HLA alleles demonstrated no appreciable binding affinity (<500nM) to any of the conserved SARS-CoV-2 peptides, suggesting a concomitant lack of potential for cross-protective immunity from other human coronaviruses. We note in particular HLA-B*46:01 is among these alleles. Note also that the putative capacity for conserved peptide presentation is unrelated to the HLA allelic incidence in the population (Figure 3 ). Moreover, we see no appreciable global correlation between conservation of the SARS-CoV-2 proteome and its predicted MHC binding affinity, suggesting a lack of selective pressure for or against the capacity to present coronavirus epitopes (p=0.27 [Fisher's exact test], Supplementary Figure S2 ).",

We kmerized each of these sequences into 8-12mers to assess MHC class I-peptide binding affinity across the entire proteome. MHC class I binding affinity predictions were performed using 145 different HLA alleles for which global allele frequency data was available as described previously (61) (see Supplementary Table S1 ) with netMHCpan v4.0 (62) using the '-BA' option to include binding affinity predictions and the '-l' option to specify peptides of lengths 8-12.
