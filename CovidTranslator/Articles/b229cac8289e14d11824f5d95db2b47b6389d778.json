            "text": "Notifying family of the death of a relative is clearly one of the more difficult and stressful duties of medical personnel. 2 Although the hospital-based pathologist is not likely to be called on to perform this function, the medical examiner almost certainly is. 3 Police or other law enforcement officers may make the initial notification in cases of suspected homicide. Emergency personnel or physicians may inform relatives arriving at the scene or hospital. However, in most cases of sudden or violent death in which death is determined at the scene and the family is not present, the medical examiner traditionally notifies the next of kin, although this responsibility is usually not spelled out legally. 3 Death notification initiates bereavement, and the manner in which notification is performed may worsen or attenuate grief. 4, 5 Death notification should be prompt to avoid having the family learn of a death from an unofficial, uninformed source. Unless the distance is prohibitive, notification should be in person. However, when telephone notification is necessary and the next of kin is alone or elderly, one must consider arranging support in the person of a friend, relative, or member of Clergy Chaplain Corps (volunteers recruited from the local community or municipal law enforcement or fire districts). 3 The International Red Cross assists with notification of family members serving in the armed forces. Contact is made through local Red Cross duty officers. 3 In many jurisdictions, local law enforcement makes death notification on an \"as time permits\" basis, which could lead to delayed notification of next of kin.",

Local jurisdictions may establish policies or procedures for compliance, and it behooves the practicing pathologist to know the relevant statutes in his or her region. In the United States, statutes pertaining to human remains stem from Old English common law. 6 Thus, at death, possession or custody of the remains passes to a surviving spouse or legal next of kin. The legal custodian of the deceased has the duty to arrange proper disposition of the remains. Although this individual does not have ordinary property rights to the corpse, he or she may authorize an autopsy; donate tissues, organs, or the entire body for therapeutic or educational purposes; or, following appropriate legal statutes, have the remains cremated or embalmed and moved to a final resting place. The next of kin may place restrictions on the extent and manner in which an autopsy is performed. Any unauthorized dissection may be considered mutilation and is tortious or even criminal. 7 Tissue and organ retention is regulated in the United States under state rather than federal law; other countries such as Australia and the United Kingdom have enacted specific legislation with respect to retention of organs. 8 Svendsen and Hill 9 surveyed autopsy law in a number of industrialized countries. Although there has been a tendency for countries to enact laws requiring next-of-kin authorization for autopsy, there are still a number of nations (Italy, Austria, and many of the countries of Eastern Europe) that give the authority to perform postmortem examinations to the medical or legal community, or both. In some countries (Denmark, France, Iceland, Norway), objections from members of the decedent's family may prevent autopsies authorized by the medical community.",

However, the law does not establish a standard for determining whether a fetus has advanced to 20 weeks' gestation. Unless there is an obvious discrepancy, we rely on the clinician's assessment of gestational age as determined by medical history, examination, and testing. In ambiguous cases, it is advisable to seek parental consent before the examination. A parent may object to postmortem examination of a stillborn fetus of less than 20 weeks' gestation. Our approach to such a situation would include counseling the family about the value of examination. However, the parents maintain ultimate jurisdiction, and their instructions would be honored. Stillbirths of 20 weeks' gestation and beyond require a standard death certificate and authorization for autopsy, and the usual laws related to disposition of the body pertain.",

If the next of kin are not identified following a thorough search of a length specified by law, the responsible official may authorize an autopsy at the request of the decedent's physician. An individual of legal age who is an acquaintance of the deceased and is assuming responsibility for burial may be allowed to authorize autopsy under the laws of some states. 11 The enactment of anatomic gifts acts and related laws provides a living person with the authority to will his or her body or its parts for transplantation, anatomic instruction, or research. Included in the statutes of many states are provisions for allowing individuals to authorize specific disposition of their remains, including postmortem examination. However, in a majority of these states, an individual's directives regarding autopsy or interment, or both, may be nullified by the objection of the legal next of kin. 12 Before death, the decedent may indicate objection, and in some jurisdictions this is sufficient to prevent routine postmortem examination. 13 Some statutes include provisions stating that consent from only one of several persons with custody of the remains is sufficient. In such cases, the wishes of the relative accepting responsibility for burial are often given preference. 11 Because disposition of a dead body requires timely action, failure of an individual to assert these rights constitutes a waiver of the right. 14 When a party waives these rights, he or she cannot also allege wrongful autopsy. However, some statutes clearly indicate that objection by another person with equal right of custody may preclude an autopsy. Thus, it seems that a pathologist should seek local legal guidance before proceeding Box 2-1 Important guidelines for death notification by medical examiners 1. Notification at the residence of a family member is ideal. If notification occurs in a public setting, seek a private area. 2. Introduce yourself. Speak slowly and calmly. 3. Briefly describe the events leading to death, but tell the family that their relative is dead early in the conversation. Fill in details after this or in response to questions. 4. Use the word \"dead\" or \"died,\" not confusing terms such as \"passed on,\" \"expired,\" or \"gone.\" Refer to the deceased by name, and do not refer to the \"body.\" 5. Avoid medical jargon and graphic terms. 6. If you can honestly tell them that the deceased did not suffer, do so. This may help their grieving process. 7. If this is a medical examiner's case, advise the family. Explain issues related to release of the body. 8. Discuss how the deceased's belongings will be returned to the family. Explain whether clothing and other belongings may be retained as evidence. 9. After the family's immediate needs are met, discuss any issues related to autopsy. Provide them with written information detailing their responsibilities and a telephone number they may call with any questions. 10. Help them call other relatives or friends, and arrange for any necessary support. 11. Allow them the opportunity to view the deceased, but prepare them for his or her appearance. Accompany them initially, but permit them time alone with their relative.",

First, it is the decedent's clinician who has the closest rapport with family members and is best positioned to approach the next of kin with the sensitivity that the situation requires. Second, the clinician is probably present at the time of death; she or he notifies the family of the event and helps the family begin dealing with the legal responsibilities that accompany the death of a relative. Finally, except in situations in which the family actively requests a postmortem examination, the clinician is usually most persuasive because he or she is interested in the answers to unresolved clinical questions.

The autopsy consent should state and the individual consenting to autopsy should be informed of the eventual appropriate disposition of these materials by the pathologist or hospital.

Box 2-3 lists death circumstances that should be reported to the medical examiner or coroner. 20 It is our hospital's policy that at the time of a patient's death, a member of the team of physicians who cared for the patient report the case to the medical examiner's office or certify that the medical examiner need not be consulted. Sometimes authorization for autopsy is obtained without appropriate notification of the legal authorities. In such situations, the pathologist assumes equal responsibility for properly notifying the medical examiner. This has particular legal consequence for the pathologist.

Therefore, at any stage of an autopsy-review of the medical history, prosection, or microscopic examination-at which a pathologist recognizes issues or findings that indicate that the case should be reported, it is the pathologist's obligation to notify the medical examiner or coroner. This applies equally in cases previously released by the authorities if new discoveries might place the case within their purview. Finally, notification should be made immediately at the time of discovery, not after completion of the dissection or autopsy report. As a common courtesy, the responsible pathologist should inform the physician and family of the deceased of any changes in circumstances.",

Diseases that are deemed notifiable vary slightly from state to state. However, state laws are influenced by input from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), which makes annual recommendations for the list of nationally notifiable diseases (Box 2-4). 22 Most state public health agencies voluntarily report nationally notifiable diseases to the CDC. Among patients, physicians, public health officials, and the courts, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) raises significant questions and concerns regarding rights to privacy and confidentiality of patients and patients' relatives and has been the subject of specific legislation. 23, 24 These laws vary widely among states, and the pathologist performing autopsies should be familiar with the specific local statutes. In general, two documents are of concern for the autopsy pathologist: the autopsy report and the death certificate. Autopsy reports prepared in the setting of a hospital practice are legally protected as part of the confidential medical record. However, in some states, autopsies reported by a medical examiner become part of the public record. Likewise, the public may gain access to causes of death listed on death certificates. 25 For these reasons, the Council on Ethical and Judicial Affairs of the American Medical Association recommends that infection with human immunodeficiency virus or AIDS appear in the autopsy report only when it is relevant to the patient's cause of death. 25 Others suggest that government offices adopt a two-part death certificate that includes one part for interment and immediate legal purposes and another for medical certification. 26, 27 This would provide greater privacy to the family of the deceased.",

A procedure separate from the autopsy, tissue and organ donation does not usually involve the pathologist other than in a cooperative role. In cases in which there is consent for both autopsy and organ donation, procurement of viable organs must take place before any postmortem examination. An exception to this occurs in medicolegal cases in which the medical examiner or coroner must determine whether organ donation would interfere with a forensic examination.

Davis and Wright 29 recommended that the surgeon harvesting donated organs be required to provide a detailed note of the surgical dissection for inclusion in the medical examiner's record.

Surgeons and others procuring organs must agree to testify at no expense to the taxpayers. 28 A small number of states allow medical examiners to remove corneas if they are unaware of any objection from the next of kin; however, they may still be liable if a plaintiff can show that the pathologist removed the tissue on the basis of \"intentional ignorance\" of the family's wishes. 30 ",

In the modern world, in which communication in effect establishes a single great parish and the autopsy has a greater influence on the treatment of disease, others express the opinion that postmortem examinations may honor the dead through service to humanity. 36, 38 Consistent with this more liberal attitude, a formal agreement between the Chief Rabbinate of the State of Israel and the Hadassah Hospital and Medical School in Jerusalem permitted autopsies in cases required by law, when in the opinion of three physicians the cause of death cannot otherwise be established; in cases involving hereditary diseases when necessary to guide medical care for a family; or when an autopsy may save the lives of others with a similar disease. 39, 40 However, more recently enacted laws have had the effect of limiting the number of autopsies performed in Israeli hospitals. 41 ",

In 1410, Pietro D'Argelata performed an autopsy on Pope Alexander V after his sudden death. In the late fifteenth century, Pope Sixtus IV issued a decree allowing the medical students at Bologna and Padua to study human remains. 42 The acceptance of autopsies by the church was well established when, in 1556, the autopsy of Ignatius Loyola revealed stones in the kidneys, bladder, and gallbladder. 43 Recognizing an autopsy as a legitimate method for extending medical knowledge and thereby improving the health of the living, the modern Protestant attitude holds that through an autopsy the deceased still serves God by contributing to the well-being of others. 12 However, in earlier times, the opinion of anatomic dissection in Protestant countries was often unfavorable. 44 For example, in England, from the Middle Ages until the end of the 19th century when the first English anatomic law was passed, the major source of human bodies for anatomic study was executed criminals. This tradition produced an association of postmortem dissection with crime and contributed to the public's negative attitude toward autopsies. 12 The limited numbers of bodies available for dissection in nations under Protestant rule led to the practice of grave robbing and clandestine anatomic studies, resulting in additional adverse public reaction to dissection. 38 The Eastern Orthodox churches (Greek Orthodox Church, Russian Orthodox Church, and others) do not forbide autopsy in the belief that it may lead to knowledge for physicians that could help them treat others in the future. 45 The Church of Christ, Scientist (Christian Scientist) forbids autopsy except in cases of sudden death. 46 Jehovah's Witnesses forbid autopsy except under specific circumstances. 33 Native Americans Although many Native Americans follow Christian practices, some maintain traditional tenets. Death rituals and burial practices vary among tribes. Traditionally, Native Americans believe in the integrity of the body and consider postmortem examinations a violation of that integrity. 46 ",

Therefore, whenever possible and with consideration of the families' need for timely funeral arrangements, the pathologist should accommodate the schedules of the clinicians. If the clinician's obligations to other patients prevent his or her attendance at an autopsy, the pathologist should communicate the findings by conversation, as well as by the usual report. The pathologist should be readily available to present autopsy findings at hospital conferences or at quality improvement meetings. In complicated cases, the pathologist also has an obligation to seek consultation from his or her pathology colleagues or, when necessary, from expert consultants. 55 In the United States, the laws covering confidential postmortem medical information vary. Autopsy reports of medical examiners' and coroners' offices are part of the public record in a number of states. In the hospital setting, the pathologist must protect the patient's confidentiality unless withholding information results in probable harm to others. 56 This includes protecting sensitive information made available electronically on the Internet. 57 Although the autopsy has inherent teaching value for other health care professionals and students, these individuals are allowed in the autopsy suite only at the discretion of the pathologist. The pathologist must provide protective clothing and so on to any observers because she or he assumes legal liability for any injury or exposure. Generally, the pathologist has the right to exclude physicians hired by the next of kin to view the autopsy except in cases of workers' compensation where state statutes allow such representation. 12 There is no place at an autopsy for members of the lay public or curiosity seekers.",

However, in the event that the legal next of kin requests (in writing) the autopsy report, it is our practice to send it along with a letter encouraging the family to approach the patient's physician for clarification or counseling. At the time of such a request, we routinely notify clinicians of the request and our action so that they may offer their service to the family in answering questions or in discussing any unresolved issues. Because even in the best of possible worlds this may not occur, the cover letter from our office also offers the assistance of the director of the autopsy service regarding any questions or concerns about the autopsy report. In our experience, calls from family members occur in four well-defined settings: (1) when the family has not identified the primary physician among the many physicians in a complex medical center; (2) when the physician with the closest relationship to the family and the one they may wish to reach is a member of the house staff and difficult to reach because he or she may have rotated to a different hospital or completed his or her training; (3) when the family has no established relationship with their relative's physician; or (4) when the family had reservations about the patient's medical care.",
