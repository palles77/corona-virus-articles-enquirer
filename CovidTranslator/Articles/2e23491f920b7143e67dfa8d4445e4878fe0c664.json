To predict and prevent MERS-CoV, real-time analysis of user's health data and his/her geographic location are fundamental. Development of healthcare systems using cloud computing is emerging as an effective solution having benefits of better quality of service, reduced cost, scalability, and flexibility. In this paper, an effective cloud computing system is proposed which predicts MERS-CoV-infected patients using Bayesian belief network and provides geographic-based risk assessment to control its outbreak. The proposed system is tested on synthetic data generated for 0.2 million users. System provided high accuracy for classification and appropriate geographicbased risk assessment. The key point of this paper is the use of geographic positioning system to represent each MERS-CoV users on Google maps so that possibly infected users can be quarantined as early as possible. It will help uninfected citizens to avoid regional exposure and the government agencies to manage the problem more effectively.

            "text": "Healthcare is a very substantial issue to be managed effectively for any nation's development. One of the most vital challenges for any government healthcare agency is to protect its citizens from disease outbreak which can spread from one citizen to another through air or other common mediums [1] . Viruses affect humans in large numbers as these are microorganisms that can propagate very easily. Corona virus is one of the common viruses which can cause multiple diseases in humans as well as animals. In 2015, its outbreak in South Korea has caused more than ten deaths, and thousands of citizens got infected [2] . MERS-CoV infected person is having primary symptoms such as respiratory diseases with fever, cough, shortness of breath (SoB), and diarrhea. Some of the secondary symptoms of MERS-CoV infection are acute renal failure, multiorgan failure, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and consumptive coagulopathy [3] . The MERS-CoV source is not yet confirmed; however, many studies suggested that this is an animal virus. Reports have confirmed the transmission of the virus from human to human, but proper intermediate hosts for its transmission are still unknown which further increases its risk [4] . MERS-CoV is a novel corona virus that was first identified in the residents of Middle East countries in late 2012 with a death rate of more than fifty percent in infected citizens. As the studies suggested, MERS-CoV spreads using common mode of contacts from one individual to another [3] . MERS-CoV is declared as a public health threat; therefore, the government's healthcare agencies are committed to provide affordable medical facilities and suggestions to the infected citizens. One of the most important steps to cure MERS-CoV is to stop its infection rate and transmission process by early identification of infected patients as well as providing precautionary measures to uninfected citizens. Identified infected patients should be quarantined as early as possible so that they do not contribute further in the infection spreading. The healthcare sector and the government agencies are adopting cloud computing with data mining approaches to control different infectious diseases [5] . Cloud computing can offer benefits such as improvement in quality of medical services, increased risk responsiveness, collaborating mobile apps, large storage space, and reduced capital investment.",

            "text": "Cloud computing is an emerging technology which provides information technology (IT) resources over the Internet. It is different from traditional IT hosting services because it delivers IT resources on demand without the need of any capital investment with pay-as-use pricing model [6] . With the increase in the use of digital patient's records in hospitals, large amount of data related to patients, doctors, medication, and the staff are generated. To store, analyze, and effectively represent the outcomes of data mining on this rapidly generated data with minimal time, hospitals need bigger IT infrastructure. Hence, IT expenditure in hospitals is continuously increasing day by day for installation and maintenance of hospital management systems. As anticipated, in the near future, the traditional IT infrastructure setup will not be sufficient to provide necessary quality of service (QoS) parameters. Growth of healthcare systems using cloud computing is emerging as an effective solution with the benefits of more dependable Qos, reduced costs and flexibility [7] . Infectious diseases like MERS and H1N1 happen rarely, so IT infrastructure used to prevent outbreaks of these infectious diseases should be adaptive and scalable in nature. Cloud computing is more suitable for such a varying demand system because it provides virtually unlimited resources on demand with a pay-as-use pricing model [8] . Infection outbreak preventing systems should be highly responsive and provide the desired service with high accuracy. Requirement of cloud service provider to provide agreed QoS facilities high system agility and generates appropriate compensation if requirements are not met [9] . The characteristics defined above act as a motivation to use cloud computing in healthcare infectious disease management system. Some of the significant health service benefits of shifting to cloud computing are listed in Table 1 .",

            "text": "In 2013, Gautret [10] studied the effect of travel history on the outbreak of MERS-CoV infections in the world. There can be human-to-human transmission of MERS-CoV infection, so the risk of infection increases to Hajj pilgrims visiting the Middle East countries. According to him, the first case of MERS-CoV was identified from South Arabia. In 2013, Hon [11] discussed that pilgrims from various countries, who visited South Arabia to perform Hajj were identified as infected with respiratory viruses. Infected pilgrims increased the risk of epidemic not only in their home countries upon their return but also to other countries. To control the epidemic, Hajj pilgrims should be advised proper protective measures, and precautionary actions should be taken when they arrive back home. He suggested that it is necessary to know about travel pattern and health symptoms of Hajj pilgrims to control the epidemic. In 2013, Lu et al. [4] described the challenges in identifying the source, designing MERS vaccines, and developing anti-MERS therapy for MERS-CoV infection. However, they had not provided any proposal for identifying the source and to control the spread of MERS-CoV. In 2013, Omrani et al. [12] carried out research on identifying the transmission mediums used by MERS virus for its propagation such as body contact, air, or water. They found that the intermediate host of transmission of MERS-CoV infection can not be recognized or be symptomatic in most of the cases. To manage this significant problem, they suggested early recognition of MERS-CoV-infected patients and implementation of proper infection control measures. In 2014, Corman et al. [13] presented the effective use of RT-PCR kit for real-time detection of MERS-CoV infections in many patients. In 2014, Al-Tawfiq et al. [14] discussed sources of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-COV) and MERS-CoV with their modes of transmission to humans. They suggested precautionary measures to travelers going to and returning from Middle East countries. All of the further mentioned articles related to MERS are from year 2015. Bhadra et al. [15] developed a real-time isothermal assay test for the detection of MERS virus. Kupferschmidt [16] and Soliman et al. [17] discussed the vaccinations and causes of MERS virus. They also provided first-aid and prevention measures for MERS. Yusof et al. [18] studied the number of camels infected with MERS and their locations in Saudi Arabia Emirate and the United Arab Emirates. Arabi et al. [19] demonstrated the effect of severe neurologic effect of MERS in hospitalized patients. Shalhoub [20] studied the effect of MERS when patients suffer from some chronic diseases. They studied the effect of MERS on a HIV-positive patient for 38 days. Similarly, Alghamdi [21] presented a case study of two MERS-infected users admitted in hospital. Banik et al. [22] argued about the knowledge gap of MERS in doctors and citizens. They also provided its infection rate as well as its difference from other similar viruses. Shehri [23] described the actions taken by health agencies in Saudi Arabia after MERS outbreak. He mentioned benefits and limitations of each action taken by government. Youde [24] listed the relationship between global health governance and MERS outbreak in detailed comparison. No further work has so far been presented for the detection and prevention of MERS-CoV to the best of our knowledge.",

[25] demonstrated that mobile application and cloud computing together can enable better sharing, storing, updating, and retrieval of electronic healthcare data. A prototype has been implemented in the form of an android mobile application. The Amazon S3 cloud service was used for evaluating the developed system. In 2012, Rao and Kumar [26] developed predictive models for diagnosis of the Dengue fever and increased the probability of correct detection. Methodology used by them imputed missing values in the dataset using a novel imputation strategy and then generated a decision tree. Wrapper-based feature selection algorithm was proposed to extract the most important symptoms of dengue. In 2014, Thilakanathan et al. [27] demonstrated security protocol that allowed secure sharing of data in the cloud within the context of mobile health applications. They attempted to address the problems of achieving efficient user revocation especially while considering large data sizes. First, they defined a secure data-sharing model and protocol. Second, they demonstrated the feasibility of the protocol through their own developed prototype which combines smart phone, Bluetooth, and cloud computing technologies. Secure data-sharing architecture was adopted by adding a security layer that enables efficient and secure data sharing. In 2014, Kaur and Chana [28] proposed cloud intelligent system for diabetic patients. They used principal component analysis (PCA) for identifying minimum correlative variables from collected attribute variables. Na\u00efve bayes and k-nearest neighbor classifiers were used to classify infected and uninfected users. In 2014, Ali et al. [29] studied a wireless lightweight, body-worn sensor used in cloud health care for real-time and continuous physiological monitoring. They suggested a data authentication scheme to authenticate data generated by sensors, because they argued that sensors operate in lossy environment. In 2014, Sultan [30] explained the potential of cloud computing for improvement and advancement of life science research. However, they only provided cloud computing advantages in healthcare sector; no new work was proposed.",

It comprises five components: data collection, information granulation, BBN-based initial analysis, GPS-based risk assessment, and communication & information sharing. It contains a cloud storage repository fragmented into multiple clouds known as medical record (M.R.) database. The data-collection component is responsible for compiling the raw information from users using the body-worn sensors and manually recorded data using the mobile application. BBN-based initial analysis classifies users into uninfected or possibly infected using symptoms registered by sensors and user. Personal information about users will be truncated, and a unique case number will be provided for further usage of the system. All compiled information and results generated are stored in a cloud storage repository termed as M.R. database. Cloud storage provides easy, flexible, and secure way to share information among users, doctors, hospitals, and the governmental agencies. Figure 2 shows information and process flow for the proposed system. The system starts when a user registers using mobile application or website. After registration, a unique case number is provided by the system, and the data table is truncated using information granulation approach for protecting the identity of the user. BBN is applied to analyze information uploaded by the user to categorize him/her into uninfected and possibly infected user. Possibly infected user is the category where the initial analysis of the proposed system classified the user as infected but not confirmed. Further lab tests are needed to confirm MERS-CoV infections. If BBN predicts user as possibly infected, the system provides information of the nearest hospital to the user and also shares his/her infection status information with multiple hospitals nearest to the user's geographic location. The hospital performs proper diagnostic test for MERS. If the user is found to be infected, he/she is quarantined at that time. An alert is being sent to the governmental agencies, hospital management treating MERS, close relatives, and Google maps will be updated accordingly. It is very difficult for the governments to approach each user and check all population. However, each citizen can enter his/her symptoms due to curiosity or general awareness. This will help the government to handle MERS more effectively by identifying users in their respective initial stage.",

The proposed system implements secure sockets layer (SSL)-based encryption for all communication among different entities of the system. According to recent attacks on information systems, SSL is not adequate for such a vital information system. Attending this critical issue, proposed system uses information granulation [31] concept to prevent unauthorized access of data. Each data table is fragmented into three matrices of different security levels and stored on different secure servers. Even if anyone is able to retrieve APIs data matrix, he/she will not be able to extract exact personal information about the user. This section explains definitions and algorithms used to perform this procedure. Aside from the benefit of preserving the identity of patients, information granulation also helps the government and health authorities to generate results at a high degree of generalization. An initial data table containing all information is fragmented into three separate data matrices of different security levels: Level 1 (personal information), Level 2 (demographic information), and Level 3 (MERS-CoV) information. Level 1 is highly sensitive information containing personal attributes such as name, social security number (SSN), address, and mobile number. Level 2 is the mediocre level of information containing demographic attributes such as gender, race, height, and ethnicity. Level 3 is least sensitive information containing MERS-CoV attributes and symptoms. Even if anyone could retrieve Level 3 information because it is maintained at the least secure system, he/she will not be able to find an exact identity of the user. For retrieving exact identity of user, a person requires the knowledge of all three levels of matrices.",

A two-stage Bayesian belief network (BBN) is proposed to overcome the issue of conditional independence among MERS-CoV attributes as well as to consider most of the attributes for accurate prediction. Figure 4 shows two-stage BBN for the proposed system. It contains two stages of BBN prediction based on direct dependency of the multiple attributes. For example, exposure level of any user to MERS-CoV virus depends on his/her animal exposure, family exposure, or regional exposure. Probability of exposure is predicted based on these three exposure attributes using the first stage of BBN classification. Similarly, medical history of any user may depend on multiple attributes such as heart, lungs, and diabetes, so predicting their effects on final MERS-CoV prediction is complex. The first stage of the proposed BBN predicts probability of effect of medical history taking into account all attributes. The second stage of the proposed BBN uses the output of the first stage of BBNs as well as some unique attributes to classify users into infected or possibly infected category, as shown in Fig. 4 .

Location-based risk assessment and healthcare services will be highly beneficial for airborne diseases such as MERS-CoV. Location of possibly infected users can be effectively used to separate an area into different risk levels. If proper up-to-date information regarding risk-prone areas is available online, then people living in risk-prone areas can be effectively alerted in due time, and infection-control suggestions can be issued to them [19] . Figure 5 shows use of the GPS [34] for pinning hexagonal location of possibly infected users identified by the proposed system. However, pinpointing the exact location of the possibly infected user can cause mass paranoid panic. To effectively represent the spread of infection and riskprone areas, hexagonal structure-based mapping is applied as indicated in Fig. 6 . Total geographic area, possibly infected by MERS-CoV, is converted into non-overlapping hexagonal structures of the same size. Size of hexagonal structure can be changed as decided by the authority. A different color scheme is also proposed to effectively represent the different locations based on the level of infection in population density [36] of MERS-CoV possibly infected users. The chances of MERS-CoV infection are very high at the home and workplace, so these two places are used to define different risk-prone areas on the Google maps [35] web service.",

All BBNs classify the users with an accuracy of more than 80 % in all the stages of the proposed BBN. The detailed accuracy of each class parameter as classified by BBN are also listed in Table 9 . True-positive (TP) rates-also known as sensitivity and false-positive (FP) rates, also known as specificity-are statistical measure to rate quality of any classification algorithm. TP rate defines the percentage of possibly infected MERS instances which are correctly classified by classification algorithm. FP rate defines the percentage of uninfected MERS instances which classification algorithm classifies as uninfected [40] . A classification algorithm with high TP and FP rate is desirable. The proposed classification algorithm provides a high TP rate that is 0.800, and a high FP rate that is 0.880. Precision and recall provide the relevancy of the classified instances. The higher the value of precision and recall, the better will be the classification because only relevant instances will be classified [40] . The proposed algorithm provides very high precision and recall rate values which are 0.809 and 0.800, respectively. F-Measure is a statistical value for classification accuracy which lies between 0 and 1. Algorithm with a high F-Measure value will be more accurate, and the proposed two-stage BBN provides an F-Measure of 0.826. Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) is a statistical measure used to find quality of any binary classification. As the proposed algorithm is for binary classification, so MCC measure is very important for it. It lies between \u22121 and +1, and the higher the value, the better is the classification. The proposed algorithm provides high value of MCC which is 0.720. Similar is the case with receiver-operating characteristic (ROC); high value of ROC area represents the accuracy of the proposed algorithm [40] . With the level of accuracy conceived in the above-listed statistical terms, it justifies the use of BBN for the proposed system.",

One of the vital tasks of the proposed system is the classification of users into infected and possibly infected, so it requires a high performance level.

Thus, experimental evaluation had systematically carried on and is broadly divided into four parts. No availability of data for MERS forced us to create a synthetic data that are generated for 0.2 million users and explained in detail in Sect. 4.1. Then, the training of the proposed twostage BBN using synthetic data in Sect. 4.1 is done in Sect. 4.2. All the experimental generated statistical measures justified the use of the proposed two-stage BBN, as listed in Tables 7, 8, and 9 . Data table fragmentation process divided into three separate data matrices is also experimentally verified in Sect. 4.3. Table 10 provides the snapshot of data table and three data matrices which indicated the successful conversion. In Sect. 4.4, whole classification process is tested for 0.2 million users on Amazon EC2 cloud using multiple classification algorithms. The proposed twostage BBN performed better in all cases than its fellow competitors. However, NN is also close to BBN in classification accuracy, but its classification time is much larger than the proposed two-stage BBN. Last, the system is tested for re-routing of citizens, which is successfully completed as shown in Fig. 10 .",

With the advancements in information technologies, it is possible to control many infections in the most effective and efficient way. In this paper, a system is proposed for predicting and preventing an airborne disease known as MERS-CoV using cloud computing and GPS. Bayesian belief network (BBN) is utilized to classify users, and cloud computing is used for effective information analysis and sharing. The key point of the paper is the use of geographic positioning system to represent each MERS-CoV possibly infected users on Google maps and provide re-routing to uninfected users. Proposed system implemented on Amazon EC2 cloud provides 80 % accuracy in classification and appropriate GPS re-routing. It will help the citizens to avoid regional exposure and the government authorities to manage the problem more effectively. Future study will include the use of the internet of things (IoT)-based smart devices for more accuracy and effectiveness in controlling infectious epidemic.",
