Since the treatment is usually empirical and prior cultures are not normally taken, the virulent factors involved in the process are often unidentified. Objectives: 1. To determine the incidence of the isolated pathogens from conjunctival exudates cultures and 2.To examine the antibiotic susceptibility for the efficacy of the therapy in the management of confirmed ABC in children. Methods: Conjunctival swabs were collected from 780 children, aged 1 month to 14 years old, who were attended with the diagnosis of ABC in our Children Hospital, during a 5-years period (2000)(2001)(2002)(2003)(2004). All bacteria were identified by classical microbiological methods and the antimicrobial susceptibility was performed according to NCCLS guidelines. Results: 453 cultures out of 780 ocular specimens were positive(58%). A total of 501 bacteria were isolated. The most frequent isolated bacteria were: Haemophilus influenzae (37.5%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (20%), Staphylococcus coagulase negative (CNS) (15.2%),and Staphylococcus aureus (14.8%) followed by Streptococcus viridans (4%), various Gram negative bacteria (3%), Moraxella catarrhalis (2.5%) and Haemophilus spp (1.6%).42 patients developed mixed cultures with two or more types of bacteria. Among 99 isolates of S. pneumoniae tested, were resistant for penicillin 14.1% and for gentamicin (Gm) and tobramycin (Tob) 45.4% and 49.5% respectively. Resistance to ampicillin was recovered in 9.5% of H. influenzae, of 66.6% of S. aureus and in 79.5% of CNS strains. Aminoglycosides showed higher resistance (Gm 17.9%, Tob 25.6%) against CNS isolates, in comparison to S. aureus (Gm 12%, Tob 14.6%) and H. influenzae strains (Gm 1.6%,Tob 2.6%) respectively. The most isolates were sensitive to chloramphenicol and ciprofloxacin. Conclusions: 1. The main pathogens causing ABC were H. influenzae and S. pneumoniae. 2. Chloramphenicol and ciprofloxacin showed favorable in vitro activity against the majority of pathogens. 3. Resistance rates indicate the need for continuous surveillance and for motoring studies.",

Kazarova (Sofia, BG) Pertussis continues to be an important vaccine preventable disease. There is a long lasting tradition in Bulgaria in pertussis prevention. More than 40 years a whole-cell pertussis vaccine is administered to infants and a high vaccine coverage is achieved and maintained. Pertussis morbidity decreased dramatically but pertussis continues to occur among different ages. Making a specific diagnosis of pertussis in patients with clinical evidence of infection is one of the many challenges presented by Bordetella pertussis. For more than 20 years, pertussis diagnosis in Bulgaria routinely is done using two classic lab methods: the direct fluorescent antibody test and the pertussis-agglutinating anti-body test. Recently ELISA method is introduced too but only for research purposes. Objectives: 1. To describe the PCR diagnosis of B. pertussis in our country and to present first results of this assay in pertussis suspect patients 2. To compare results between PCR diagnosis and direct fluorescent antibody test in the same patients. 3. To assess the role of Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Chlamidia pneumoniae as causatives of infants' respiratory infections misdiagnosed by the general practitioners as pertussis infection. Results: 334 nasopharyngeal swabs were collected from infants with pertussis symptoms and contact adults. All samples were tested by PCR. PCR was performed for insertion element IS481 of B. pertussis. 69 samples out of them were found positive for B. pertussis by PCR. Two were positive for M. pneumoniae by PCR.100 samples were tested comparatively by two methods :PCR and direct fluorescent antibody test. Vaccination status of patients and clinical data were analysed too.",

Random Amplification of Polymorphic DNA (RAPD) technique was performed as a simple method to observe the genetic diversity of the isolated RSV. Results: Thirty NPA samples were positive for RSV using the DIF assay but only 20 samples were positive by tissue culture. The peak months are from the months of October to January for both years. Seminested PCR on RSV isolates revealed 17 cases of RSV Group A while the remaining three cases, RSV Group B. RAPD result suggested that there may be five main subgroups during the study period. Conclusion: This study confirmed RSV Group A as the more dominant group and may be more virulent in the Malaysian context. This is similar to most studies in other parts of the world. Intragroup variation occurs throughout the duration of the study. This variation may have a considerable effect of the efficiency of transmission and virulence. Restriction analysis study will be done in order to compare the isolates objectively with other studies. These findings can be used as part of the globally initiative towards vaccine development. Objective: To determine epidemiological characteristics, i.e. the occurrence of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection in Croatian children with acute respiratory tract infections. Methods: At Virology Department, Croatian National Institute of Public Health (CNIPH), we tested nasopharyngeal secretions obtained from 1232 patients most of whom were hospitalized in two Zagreb hospitals for acute respiratory infections. Demonstration of the virus was by isolating it in cell culture and/or by detecting it with monoclonal antibodies in the direct immunofluorescence assay. Results: Most often, the virus demonstrated was RSV (43.8%; 540/1232). Other respiratory viruses (adeno, parainfluenza, influenza) were shown considerably less commonly (5.1%). Viral infection could not be demonstrated in 629 (51.1%) patients. As to bronchiolitis, RSV was demonstrated to be its most common cause (60.77%; 251/413). It was also proven to be the most common causative agent of infections in children aged 0-6 months (55.6%; 300/540). Bronchiolitis (63%; 190/300) and, less commonly, pneumonia (9.7%; 29/300) were the diagnoses linked with RSV in this age group. On the other hand, RSV was demonstrated in 21% (63/300) of the children diagnosed with upper respiratory tract infection (URTI). We showed the presence of the majority of RSV infections in winter months, i.e. between November and June. Conclusion: RSV is a common cause of lower respiratory tract infections in Croatian infants and young children with its annual outbreaks occurring in winter season. Their onset is mostly in November.",

            "text": "Methods: From February to August 2004, consecutive nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPAs) collected from children hospitalized with acute RI and submitted to a virology laboratory for rapid detection of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) antigens were retrospectively analysed for hMPV. After extraction of nucleic acids from these frozen NPAs, RSV was first detected by amplifying RSV-specific fusion (F) and nucleocapsid (N) genes, respectively, using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The same extracts were subsequently detected for hMPV by amplifying hMPV-specific F and N genes, respectively, using nested RT-PCR. If multiple samples during the same course of illness were submitted, either one of the virus-positive samples (first choice) or one of the virus-negative samples (second choice) was included for analysis to decrease a statistical bias. Results: 667 NPAs collected from 623 hospitalized children with acute RI were examined, however, only 580 NPAs of them had been successfully detected for both RSV and hMPV by RT-PCR. The age of patients ranged from 0 to 9 years. A positive rate of RSV or hMPV in NPAs was 39.1% (n = 227) and 8.6 (n = 50) respectively. In 353 NPAs negative for RSV, hMPV was found in 13.3% (n = 47) of samples. Only 2 NPAs (0.3%) were positive for both viruses. The infection rates of hMPV were significantly related to the month of recruitment (p = 0.001, Pearson Chi-squared test), with peak rates of 17.0% and 16.9% in May and June, respectively. According to the clinical diagnosis, 486 samples (83.8%) with pneumonia, bronchiolitis, bronchitis or brochopneumonia were arbitrarily defined to have a lower RI, otherwise, upper RI was recognized (16.2%, n = 94). Among NPAs negative for RSV, lower RI was significantly associated with hMPV when compared with upper RI (p = 0.034, Fisher's exact test). Conclusions: This preliminary study discloses that hMPV plays a role in Taiwanese children with acute RI with a comparable rate of infection as reported in western countries. hMPV infection in children may have seasonal preference as shown in this study, though a longer period of evaluation remains necessary. The rare co-infection of RSV and hMPV in children with acute RI implies the importance of hMPV detection especially in NPAs negative for RSV.",

Methods: Blood samples were taken from 66 children (40 boys and 26 girls), aged 9 months to 13 years, with symptoms suggesting recent CMV infection, from July 2002 to December 2003. They were tested for detection of CMV antibodies (IgM and IgG) by Microparticle Enzyme Immunoassay (AXSYM, ABBOTT) Enzyme linked Fluorescent Assay was used as a method of confirmation of the IgM positive tests. Also, the test of IgG-avidity was used as a supplementary means for the exclusion of a recent primary infection of less than 3 months (Vidas, bioMerieux). Results: Out of the total of 66 children examined, the 17 (group I) were found to be positive both for IgM and IgG antibodies, 3 (group II) were found to be positive only for IgM antibodies and 24 (group III) were found to be positive only for IgG antibodies. 22 children haven't been exposed to the disease (IgM-/IgG-). In group I children, with the use of the CMV-avidity test, the acute infection was excluded in 8 out of 17 children, a fact that was also confirmed with the second antibody detection test. In group II, 2 in 3 children were excluded in the same way, while in the other child acute infection was confirmed in the tests of confirmation. In group III, old infection was found with the CMV avidity test. Conclusion: Those results give us indicative information about the incidence of CMV infections in our hospital in the chronological period that is referred above. This study showed that the use of confirmation tests are necessary in several cases, especially those with unclear clinical and laboratory findings.",

Malm (Lublin, PL) Objectives: Respiratory tract infections, predominantly of viral etiology, are the most common, community-acquired infections in young children. Some of them are complicated by bacterial infections usually of endogenous origin. The mucous membranes of nasopharynx are known to be the important reservoir of some opportunistic or potentially pathogenic bacteria. The aim of the present study was to compare the nasopharyngeal microflora in two groups of pre-school children -without or with the recurrent respiratory tract infections. Methods: Nasal and throat specimens were obtained from 225 children aged 3-5 years. The cotton swabs were immediately placed onto appropriate nonselective (blood agar) or selective media (Haemophilus chocolate agar, Chapman agar, McConkey agar or Sabouraud agar). Plates were incubated in an appropriate atmosphere -with or without increased CO 2 concentration) for 18-48 hrs at 35\u00b0C. The isolated microorganisms were identified on the basis of routinely methods (macroscopic, microscopic or biochemical assays) or by rapid commercial latex tests -Slidex Staph-Kit and Slidex Pneumo-Kit (bioMerieux). Results: The prevalence of potentially pathogenic bacteria typical for nasopharynx such as Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Moraxella catarrhalis or Haemophilus influenzae and also of yeast-like fungi (Candida sp., mostly C. albicans) was similar in both groups of children. However, in nasopharynx of children with the recurrent respiratory tract infections several opportunistic bacteria belonging to Enterobacteriaceae (Escherichia coli, Citrobacter freundii) or non-fermentative rods (Pseudomonas putida, Agrobacterium radiobacter, Acinetobacter lwoffii) were found. Also other bacteria such as slime-producing Bacillus sp. or streptomycetes were isolated from this group of children. Conclusion: The obtained data suggest that young children with the recurrent respiratory tract infections are predisposed for nasopharynx colonization by several opportunistic bacterial species of Gram-negative rods or even by some unusual microorganisms, e.g. slime-producing Bacillus sp. or streptomycetes. Objective: Establish a correlation between antimicrobial resistance in S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae, isolated from children with upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) in S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil, and their history of antimicrobial use and/or vaccination. Methods: Samples (one per patient) were selected from patients under 7 years old between 2002 and 2004. All subjects were diagnosed with URTI and had a positive culture result for at least one of the selected pathogens (S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae). Clinical data related to age, gender, diagnosis and samples are described. S. pneumoniae isolates were tested against penicillin and another five antimicrobials for minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) by E-test methodology. Interpretative criteria used were those described by NCCLS document M100-S14. H. influenzae isolates were tested for betalactamase production by a chromogenic cephalosporin method. Logistic regression was performed to investigate the correlation between S. pneumoniae (intermediate and high) penicillin resistance and previous antimicrobial use and pneumococcal vaccination. The same procedure was done for beta-lactamase-positive H. influenzae and previous antimicrobial use and vaccination against H. influenzae type b (Hib). Results: Of patients with S. pneumoniae isolation, 62 had information on previous antibiotic use and 53 on pneumococcal vaccination. Of patients with H. influenzae isolation, 121 had information on previous antibiotic use and 101 on vaccination to H. influenzae. There was no correlation between presence of penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae and previous antibiotic use (p = 0.16; OR = 2.28; IC95% = 0.73-7.16) or vaccination against pneumococci (p = 0.61; OR = 0.72; IC95% = 0.20-2.54). Similarly, no correlation was found between presence of betalactamase-producing H. influenzae and previous antibiotic use (p = 0.71; OR = 0.78; IC95% = 0.21-2.96) or Hib vaccination (p = 0.78; OR = 0.72; IC95% = 0.08-6.72). Conclusions: No correlation was found between antibiotic use and respective vaccinations against S. pneumoniae and Hib and their related resistance characteristics, penicillin resistance and beta-lactamase production respectively. However, among possible bias influencing the results, vaccination against both pathogens is still low in the study population and it was not possible to compare resistance and previous antimicrobial use by drug class.",

Material and method: We reviewed retrospectively the clinical, demographic and laboratory data of the 388 patients who have been attended our hospital, between 01/2000 and 11/2004 for at least one year. During this period 5010 sputum or deep throat specimens were cultured. The identification of the isolates was made by the API 20NE identification system (Biomerieux, France) and the antibiotic resistance was determined with the E-test strips (AB Biodisk, Sweden). Results: (1) Sm has been harboured by 62 (16.0 %) of our patients (38 were female and 24 male). Chronically infected remained 11.3 % of them, while 59.7 % had only one positive culture for Sm. (2) The mean age of the 1st isolation of Sm was 8.3 \u00b1 4.9 years. (3) The yearly incidence rate of Sm acquisition and the yearly prevalence were 2.8-3.6% and 4.7-9.2% respectively. (4) The sensitivity to ticarcillin/clavulanic acid as well as to co-trimoxazole were 59.3% and 62.6% respectively. Conclusions: (1)Yearly prevalence and incidence rates for Sm in CF patients showed no trends. (2)the resistance to ticarcillin/ clavulanic acid is gradually increasing. Objectives: A highly transmissible, epidemic strain of Pseudomonas aeruginosa is widespread among cystic fibrosis patients attending clinics in Liverpool, United Kingdom. We studied the emergence of clonal variants of this Liverpool Epidemic strain (LES) over time in chronically infected patients.",

A total of 4 to 8 isolates from each patient were studied, collected at three different times during their colonisation (1995) (1996) (1997) (1998) (1999) (2000) (2001) (2002) (2003) . Macrorestriction fragment patterns were compared with the first LES in our collection isolated in 1988 and clonal variants had 1 to 3 band differences from this control strain. All isolates were tested positive with a PCR assay specific for LES. Results: PFGE analysis of SpeI and XbaI digests revealed 9 and 7 clonal variants of LES respectively. There was overall good correlation between SpeI and XbaI fragment patterns, however digestion with SpeI was more discriminatory in this study. All patients had clonal variants of LES (range 2-4). The variant with identical fragment pattern to the 1988 isolate was the most common and was isolated from all but one patient at least once. Two other variants were also common and were detected in three or more patients. Emergence of clonal variants in individual patients appeared to occur at random and did not persist throughout the study period in most of them. There was no correlation between clonal variants and phenotype or antibiotic sensitivity pattern of the isolates. Conclusion: Clonal variants of LES are common and were detected in all the patients. This study confirms that genomic diversity and evolution of a clonal lineage as indicated by subtle band shifts of the macrorestriction fragment pattern is common in chronically infected cystic fibrosis patients.",

            "text": "Objectives: Pseudomonas aeruginosa is the leading pathogen responsible for morbidity and mortality in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF), and is the primary reason for the reduced survival age. Different molecules are responsible for P. aeruginosa virulence, including lipopolysaccharide (LPS) as a cellular component. Suppression or modulation of P. aeruginosa virulence factors may be an alternative strategy for treatment of lung infections in CF. The aim of this study was to examine the influence of subminimal inhibitory concentrations (subMICs) of ceftazidime and ciprofloxacin on the LPS structure of P. aeruginosa strains isolated from patients with CF. Methods: A total of 20 strains isolated from sputa of patients with CF were used. Serotyping based on the detection of heat stable LPS bacterial surface antigens (O-antigens) was performed as slide agglutination tests using O-specific polyclonal sera and a suspension of live bacterial isolate to be examined, according to the International Antigenic Typing System. Serotyping was performed before and after exposure of strains to 1/ 2, 1/4, 1/8, 1/16, and 1/32 MIC of antibiotics. Results: The slide agglutination test with polyclonal diagnostic sera showed that only nine strains were typable, while six strains were polyagglutinable, three strains were non-typable, and two strains were auto-agglutinable. After the exposure of strains in exponential phase of their growth to subMICs of antibiotics, a significant difference in typeability of the strains were observed. Treatment with subMICs of ceftazidime and ciprofloxacin resulted in the alteration of polysaccharide structure of typable strains. Out of nine monoagglutinable strains, seven strains have become auto-agglutinable after exposure to 1/2, 1/4, 1/8 and 1/16 MIC of ceftazidime, while two strains have become polyagglutinable, suggesting the loss of most of the O-antigenic determinants of the LPS. The polyagglutinability was observed more frequently after exposure of those strains to 1/2, 1/4 and 1/8 MIC of ciprofloxacin (five out of nine strains). The non-typable strains have become auto-agglutinable or polyagglutinable, depending on the concentration of antibiotic. Conclusion: The results of this study have shown that the antigenic structure of P. aeruginosa strains isolated from sputa of patients with CF was significantly changed after in vitro exposure to subMICs of ceftazidime and ciprofloxacin, due to the loss of O-antigenic determinants. Objectives: The asymptomatic colonisation by Pneumocystis jirovecii (Pc) has been recently demonstrated in immunocompetent patients, mainly in subjects with different pulmonary diseases. Cross-sectional studies have shown that healthy adults have frequently serum antibodies to Pneumocystis, and the primary contact usually occurs at an early age. However, the dynamic of the humoral immune response against this pathogen still remains unknown. The objective of this study was to evaluate the dynamic of antibody response to P. jirovecii in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). Methods: (1) Population: Cohort study in which were included a total of 75 consecutive patients with CF, attended in a specialized unit between May 2001 and July 2002. Patients were followed every six months during one year. At each visit respiratory and serum samples were collected for Pc evaluation.",

Uhari (Oulu, FIN) Background and aim: We evaluated the incidence of nosocomial infections occurring within 14 days after care at the paediatric infection ward of Oulu University Hospital between VI/2001 and V/2003 . Methods: At discharge from the hospital data on clinical diagnosis, aetiology of the infection, number of patients in the same room and whether or not the child got a nosocomial infection during the hospital stay were registered. Two weeks after the child was discharged the parents filled in a questionnaire concerning whether the child became ill after the discharge. Results: We have data from 1922 patients. Most of the patients (90%) were treated in a single patient room. The most common diagnoses were obstructive bronchitis in 437 (23%) and gastroenteritis in 566 (29%) cases. Twenty-three out of 1922 (1.3%) got a nosocomial infection during their stay at the ward, most of them gastroenteritis. Parents of 1136 patients (59%) returned the questionnaires. 313 children out of 1136 (28%) were taken ill after discharge, 88 (8%) of these within 72 hours. Cough was the most common symptom on those taken ill 4-14 days after discharge (53%), and diarrhoea on those taken ill within the first 72 hours (49%) (Figure) . The children who got nosocomial infections were younger than the other patients (mean 2.3 years, vs. others 3.0, P = 0.03) and the duration of the hospital care was longer in them (mean 3.6 vs 2.9 days, P = 0.005).",

Yet, 8% of the children discharged from the ward were taken ill within 72 hours. Viruses causing gastroenteritis seem to be more difficult to prevent from spreading than respiratory viruses. plasma levels above 2 ng/ml on the 1st day after surgery (n = 28) were randomized into two groups. IgM-enriched immunoglobulin preparation (Pentaglobin, Biotest Pharma GmbH, Germany) was administrated to the patients in the study group (n = 15) in addition to standard treatment (1-3 days after surgery, 5 ml/kg each day). Patients in the control group (n = 13) received only standard treatment. Patients in both groups were comparable by severity of initial condition, age and CPB time. PCT blood plasma concentrations were measured on the 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 6th days after surgery by immunoluminometric method (PCT LIA, B.R.A.H.M.S Aktiengesellschaft GmbH, Germany). Post-op infections rates were analysed in these groups. The data were compared by Mann-Whitney U-test and p-value of (0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results: None of the patients had exhibited any signs of infection before surgery. Patients with PCT blood plasma levels less than 2 ng/ml on the 1st day after surgery (n = 3) had smooth post-op period.

Methods: Stool specimens were collected between May 2003 and May 2004 from children hospitalized for gastroenteritis. Samples were tested for HAstV, RV, and EAd. HAstVs were detected by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction while RV and EAd were identified by latex agglutination test. Demographic and clinical data were collected for all enrolled children. Clinical symptoms and severity of illness were determined. Results: During this 1-year period, 227 children hospitalized for acute gastroenteritis were enrolled. The mean age was 37 months (range: 21 days to 213 months). HAstV, RV or EAd were detected in 51% of enrolled children. RV was detected in 94 (41%), EAd in 13 (6%) and HAstV in 12 (5%) from the collected stool samples. The most common clinical presentation of RV infected children were the combination of diarrhoea, vomiting and fever (34%), while in children with HAstV or EAd infection diarrhoea alone was more characteristic (50% and 62%, respectively). Children infected with either virus had diarrhoea lasting 1-4 days with 1-3 episodes per day, vomiting episodes lasted 1-2 days and fever \u202138.0\u00b0C. Based on the 20-point Vesikari severity score system; 58% of RV infected children had moderate or severe infection (score: \u20218) while 77% of children with EAd or 67% with HAstV had rather mild disease (score: \u00a3 7); (p < 0.05). Conclusion: Clinical presentations of gastroenteritis by RV, HAstV or EAd are similar with diarrhoea the most common manifestation followed by vomiting and/or fever. RV infected patients had a more severe illness than those children infected with EAd or HAstV. Based on the epidemiological and clinical data we can conclude that these enteric viruses are a significant burden of disease based upon hospitalizations for childhood gastroenteritis in Baranya County, Hungary. Background: The neonatal gut normally becomes colonised with a variety of bacterial species. However, surgical intervention, nutritional deprivation and antibiotic therapy devastate the normal gastro-intestinal (GI) ecosystem and may contribute to the risk of bacterial translocation (BT). Intervention using probiotic bacteria or prebiotic carbohydrates has been proposed to reduce this problem but few studies have looked at the ability of probiotic bacteria to colonise the abnormal gut. Objectives: To demonstrate the persistence of probiotic bacteria demonstrate a biological effect using short chain fatty acid profiles. Methods: Conventional culture of stools and stoma fluid was performed on 5% Horse blood, neomycin blood agar and MacConkey agar Extended culture was performed using Rogosa agar for Lactobacillus spp. and Beeren's Agar for Bifidobacterium spp. Short Chain Fatty Acid (SCFA) Analysis was performed by Gas Liquid Chromatography Chromatography and Isolates of lactobacilli were genotyped using. Random Amplification of Polymorphic DNA (RAPD) using primer 272 a eubacterial primer followed by gel electrophoresis. Results: Routine bacterial culture on 320 specimens yielded Coagulase Negative Staphylococci (CNS), Enterococci and coliforms with Gram positive bacilli being isolated from only 7 specimens. On extended culture of 170 specimens Gram positive bacilli were isolated on 39 occasions. Short Chain Fatty Acid (SCFA) analysis showed that no patient samples demonstrated a SCFA profile similar to a healthy breastfed infants. In one patient studied longitudinally a change of diet along with administration of a probiotic resulted in a change in the fatty acid profile from being predominantly octanoic acid to proprionic acid. RAPD analysis showed that a lactobacillus indistinguishable from the probiotic strain could be isolated from the faeces of one patient throughout the period of probiotic administration. Conclusions: This pilot study confirms the potential for SCFA analysis to detect changes as a result of pre and probiotic dietary supplements and the RAPD method used successfully discriminated between the Lactobacillus spp investigated. Further work needs to be done in this area in particular the on resolution of RAPD and whether other DNA-based methodologies e.g. FISH may further improve the detection of specific probiotic strains and allow greater understanding of the effects detected by SCFA analysis.",

On the other hand, there were no significant differences between PU and PSU for cefoxitin (96% each), amoxicillin/clavulanate (84 vs 73%), nitrofurantoin (96 vs 92%) and ciprofloxacin (CIP, 100 vs 96%). In addition, 4% of E. coli isolates in PU and 54% in PSU had the phenotype of extended-spectrum a-lactamase (ESBL) producers. Other common pathogens were Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PSA), Klebsiella pneumoniae (KPN) and Enterobacter cloacae (ECL). Most PSA isolates were susceptible to AM, TAZ, piperacillin/tazobactam, ticarcillin and imipenem (IMI) in both departments (74-100%). Susceptibility rates of KPN and ECL in patients from PU were significantly higher than those in PSU (p < 0.05) for AM, TAZ and S/T, but there was no difference for IMI and CIP ((95%). Conclusions: Resistance of E. coli isolates from PU and particularly PSU to common antimicrobials and the presence of ESBLproducing strains are of concern. The increased resistance rates of all common isolates in PSU patients should be highlighted. Continuous evaluation of antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of uropathogens is necessary to ascertain optimal empiric therapy.",

In children and adolescents normal flora cannot be easily defined. The purpose of this study was to assess the prevalence of pathogens in vaginal cultures obtained from children presenting to our hospital. Methods: Between January 2003 and October 2004 we examined 227 vaginal cultures from an equal number of symptomatic non-sexually active young girls (mean age 8.5 years, range 5-14 years). Vaginal secretions were inoculated onto culture plates and were incubated in aerobic and anaerobic conditions for 24 and 48 h, respectively. Isolation, identification and susceptibility to antibiotics were carried out under standard conditions using the VITEK System ATB Expression (Bio-Merieux, France). For the detection of Mycoplasma hominis each specimen was inoculated on DNA agar and then incubated in anaerobic conditions for 48 h whereas Ureaplasma urealyticum was identified by urease production using urea broth. Results: Our results show that out of 227 young girls 146 (64.3%) had positive cultures, 69 (30.4%) had negative cultures for pathogens and in 12 cases (5.2%) there was no growth on the plates whatsoever. Of the 146 positive cultures we isolated 179 pathogens: 29.6% anaerobic bacteria, 22.9% Streptococci, 16.8% Ureaplasma urealyticum, 13.4% Gram-negative rods, 13.4% Gardnerella vaginalis, 3.3% Staphylococci and 0.6% Mycoplasma hominis. Conclusions: Distinguishing pathogenic isolates from nonpathogenic ones is not a simple task in children and adolescents. The Clinical Microbiology and Infection, Volume 11, Supplement 2, 2005 most commonly isolated pathogens were anaerobic bacteria and streptococci. The prevalence of Ureaplasma urealyticum in our study group was high. Since our results indicate the involvement of Ureaplasma urealyticum in young girls' vulvovaginitis a routine examination for this pathogen is suggested.",

Balomenaki (Chania, GR) Objective: Management of febrile infants younger than 3 months of age is a difficult challenge for pediatricians because of the relatively high prevalence of serious bacterial infection. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the clinical characteristics, management and infectious outcomes of febrile infants aged 1 to 3 months. Methods: We reviewed 153 cases of febrile infants (rectal temperature \u2021 38\u00b0C) 29-90 days old who admitted to our hospital during the period 2002-2003. Infants were considered as low risk for serious bacterial infection if they met the following (Rochester) criteria: (1) appear well; (2) were previously healthy; (3) have no focal infection; (4) have white blood cell (WBC) count 5000-15,000/mm 3 , band form count \u00a31500/ mm 3 , \u00a3 10 WBC per high power field on microscopic examination of urine sediment, and \u00a3 5 WBC per high power field on microscopic examination of a stool smear (if diarrhoea). The remaining infants were classified as being at high risk group. Serious bacterial infection was defined as a positive culture of blood, urine, cerebrospinal fluid, stool or any aspirated specimen. Results: Of 153 infants that were studied, 89 (58%) were boys and 64 (42%) were girls. 71 (46.4%) of all infants classified as being at low risk group and 82 (53.6%) as being at high risk group. The overall incidence of serious bacterial infection was 34% (53 patients): 32 infants (60.3%) had a urinary tract infection; 14 (26.4%) bacteraemia; 5 (9.4%) meningitis; 1 (1.8%) bacterial enteritis and 1 (1.8%) pneumonia. Antibiotics administered in 85 infants (55.5%). The mean duration of hospitalization was 7.8 (4-14) days. All infants had good outcome except of one infant with meningitis who was transferred to intensive care unit because of refractory seizures. Only 4 (5.6%) of the infants in the low risk group had a serious infection, compared with 49 (55.5%) of the infants in the high risk group (p < 0.0001). None of the infants in the low risk group had bacteraemia. Conclusion: Infants younger than three months of age with fever who meet the low risk criteria are unlikely to have serious bacterial infection. This probability forms a basis for well founded decisions in the management of the individual febrile infants. Objective: The frequency, relative enlarged, in the new born and toddler, of the respiratory system's infections, accompanied by morpho-functional alterations of the excretory renal system and/or of the suprarenal glands, draw attention on the knowledge of the structural particularities of those systems that can become a risk factor in the prognostic of the infections' evolutions. It is known that the morphogenesis of those systems is incomplete in the moment of the birth and that it continues long time post partum. We proposed to ourselves to evaluate the morpho-differentiation of the functional structures from the respiratory, renal excretory in order to know the potentialities of evolution and/or extension of the inflammatory processes. Methods: The lung and kidney fragments, harvested from 15 new born and 10 toddlers deceased by cardio-respiratory insufficiency, were fixed using formaldehyde 1% at the pH 7.5. The sections made after the paraffin inclusion, were colored with HE, Van Gieson, G\u00f6 m\u00f6 ri and PAS stains. Results: In the serial sections' analysis of the new born's lung, we noticed the presence of the \"terminal bags\" (synonym with \"pulmonary alveoli\"), with entoblastic origin, lined by a cylindrical epithelium and here and there cubical. On the sections realized on the new born kidney we noticed a structural heterogeneity of the renal cortex, due to the presence pf the intermediary stages in genesis of the 'excretory unities of the metanephros'. In the extracellular matrix, surrounding the renal corpuscle partially differentiated, we found an enlargement of the heparin-sulfate proteoglycans' quantities. Conclusions: The identification in new born's lungs and kidneys of the functional structures, still in differentiation shows that those organs are reactional instability sources to the infectious aggressions.",

Conclusion: The dynamic changes in serum gastrin concentration in course of severe early-onset neonatal infections, observed in first month of life, both in full-term and preterm newborns, indicate its function on alimentary tract disorders. Objectives: Infections caused by Gram(+) flora are a major cause of morbidity in patients with haematological conditions associated with neutropenia. Although vancomycin is often indicated for these infections, it is associated with infusionrelated reactions and renal toxicity. This study was to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of linezolid, the first member of a new class of antibacterial agents, oxazolidinones, in the treatment of infectious complications in oncohematological patients. Methods: This was a retrospective analysis based on data from 46 paediatric patients (age 8 mo to 16 y) with haematological conditions. Linezolid 10 mg/kg bid was administered by 1-h intravenous infusion, always as a component of combined antibacterial therapy (ceftazidime, cefepim or carbapenem with or without amikacin). Indications for antibacterial therapy included fever of unknown origin in neutropenic patients, soft tissue infection, mucositis, enterocolitis, catheter related infections, pneumonia, osteomyelitis, urinary tract infection and subhepatic abscesses. Microbiological samples were taken before the start of therapy and repeated on days 7 and 14 of treatment if the results were positive. Results: A total of 50 courses of linezolid were delivered. The mean duration of therapy was 9 days (5-106 days). Clinical response to therapy was observed in 76% (38/50) of courses, including complete resolution of the symptoms in 68% (34/50) of courses and eradication of Gram(+) organisms in patients with mixed fungal and bacterial infection in 8% (4/50) of courses. Clinical response was achieved in 70% (26/37) of empirical therapy courses. In courses with documented Gram(+) infection, eradication was 100% (13/13). Complete resolution of symptoms was achieved in 50% (8/16) and improvement in 19% (3/13) of courses in patients who were switched to linezolid following ineffective vancomycin therapy. Only 1 (2%) course of linezolid therapy had to be discontinued due to exacerbation of cytopenia in a child with acquired severe aplastic anemia. Conclusions: This is the first study assessing the efficacy and tolerability of linezolid in children with infectious complications of oncohematological diseases. Linezolid was highly effective when used as a component of empirical therapy of the febrile neutropenia. Haematological toxicity of linezolid was low, even when baseline suppression of hemopoiesis was present, allowing full compliance with treatment schedule.",

            "text": "Determinants of under-and overuse of antibiotics in primary care patients with acute otitis media Objectives: In the Netherlands, antibiotic prescribing rates for acute otitis media (AOM) are very low compared to other countries. Some publications suggested a relation between decline in antibiotic use and a rise in complications of respiratory tract infections. Therefore it is important to study not only overprescription but also underprescription of antibiotics, and which clinical factors are associated with both phenomena. Thus, a study was undertaken to assess the appropriateness of antibiotic treatment in AOM in a low prescribing country like the Netherlands and to assess clinical patient characteristics that cause both under-and overprescribing of antibiotics in cases of AOM. Methods: During four weeks in the winter of 2002/2003, 146 Dutch GPs in the middle region of the Netherlands included all patients with acute ear complaints. They registered patient demographics, clinical presentation (signs and symptoms), severity of illness, whether they thought patients expected antibiotic treatment, diagnosis and management. Using key issues of current guidelines on AOM as benchmark, we assessed the appropriateness of antibiotic prescribing in cases of AOM. In addition, we assessed the association between clinical patient characteristics and under-or overprescribing of antibiotics in cases of AOM. Results: In seven out of ten patients with acute ear complaints antibiotic treatment was according to the guidelines. In 17% of all consultations antibiotics were indicated but not prescribed (underprescribing) and in 12% antibiotics were not indicated but prescribed (overprescribing). The lower the GP assessed the severity of illness, if there was no worsening since the previous contact, if the duration of symptoms prior to the consultation was short, or if the patient had only one inflammation sign, more underprescribing occurred. If the GP assessed a high severity of illness, if the patient was coughing, or if the GP thought the patient expected an antibiotic, then the GP prescribed more often antibiotics without indication (overprescribing). Conclusion: Both incorrect interpretation of signs and symptoms and perceived expectation of patients were correlated with incorrect antibiotic management in acute otitis media.",

Font, M.D. Ferrer, I. Sanfeliu, F. Segura (Sabadell, E) Background: In vitro and in vivo studies demonstrated the high efficacy of doxycycline in the treatment of MSF. However, it is convenient to have another alternatives available for patients who are allergic to tetracyclines, pregnant, or for children under 8 years. Based on good results in vitro we considered of interest to evaluate the clinical efficacy of clarithromycin in the treatment of MSF. Methods: Randomized therapeutic study . Group A received clarithromycin 500 mg/12 h for 5 days in adults and 15 mg/kg/12 h for 5 days in children. Group B received the treatment of choice which was, doxycycline (200 mg/12 h for 1 day) in adults and doxycycline (5 mg/kg/12 h for 1 day) or josamycin (50 mg/kg/12 h for 5 days) in children. Inclusion criteria: patients who had the compatible clinical with MSF and the presence of the primary lesion (tache noire) or a positive serology against R. conorii. Exclusion criteria: patients who had received effective antibiotic treatment or whose symptoms appeared 8 or more days before enrolment in the study. Results: There were randomized 48 patients. There were excluded 14 patients, 10 from group A and 4 from group B. 34 patients were evaluated. 20 males. Mean age: 38.4 years. 12 were under 14 years. 33 patients presented fever. The exanthema was presented in 30 cases. The tache noire was observed in 29 cases. The diagnosis was confirmed by serology in 31 cases. 14 patients received clarithromycin (group A) and 20 doxycycline or josamycin (group B) . The interval between the onset of the symptoms and the start of treatment was 3.6 \u00b1 2.2 days in group A and 3.6 \u00b1 1.9 days in group B (p = NS). The time taken for disappearance of the fever after treatment was 2.57 \u00b1 1.7 days in group A vs 2.19 \u00b1 1.4 days in group B (p = NS). The symptoms had disappeared at 4.35 \u00b1 2.5 days in group A vs 4.52 \u00b1 3.4 days in group B (p = NS). There were no adverse reactions to the treatment or relapses in either group. Conclusion: Clarithromycin could be considered as an alternative in the treatment of MSF. Objectives: Many questions remain unanswered about the fate of antibiotic resistance (AbR) in drug-free environments. We examined the fitness cost and expression of five AbR-coding mobile genetic elements in the absence of drug selection. Methods: Plasmids RP1, pUB307 and N3, the transposon Tn1 and the ICE element R391 were separately introduced into 345-2 RifR, a rifampicin-resistant derivative of a recent porcine isolate. The insertion site of Tn1 was identified using PCR and DNA sequencing. The fitness cost of each AbR element was assessed in vitro by pairwise growth competition and in vivo by monitoring the number of CFU/g of faeces regularly for 21 days following inoculation of six seven-week old organic piglets with 10 10 CFU. The bacteria were recovered by plating onto MacConkey agar containing rifampicin and retention of the AbR elements monitored by replicating onto agar containing the appropriate antibiotics. Isolates that did not express the expected resistance profile were characterised by PCR and DNA sequencing. Results: Tn1 inserted into a cryptic DNA sequence adjacent to the rhsD gene. The insertion site was 2.1 kb away from an independent insertion made in a previous study, where we found that Tn1 enhanced host fitness. The Tn1 insertion described here had no effect on fitness in vitro and in vivo. The plasmid RP1 had a 3.3 \u00b1 0.9% fitness cost per generation in vitro but was recovered at the same rate from the pig gut as the plasmid-free strain (p = 0.09). Similarly the plasmid pUB307, which is RP1 without Tn1, had an in vitro fitness cost of 1.9 \u00b1 0.8% but no effect on fitness in vivo (p = 0.21). The plasmid N3 had a large fitness cost of 9.1 \u00b1 1.8% in vitro and was also recovered at lower rates in vivo (p = 0.04). The ICE element R391 had a neutral effect on fitness in vitro and in vivo.",

Conclusions: The fitness impact exerted upon E. coli 345-2 RifR by carriage of AbR elements is variable depending on the element, and can also be absent.

Increased expression of other proteins including the outer membrane channel protein TolC, organic solvent tolerance protein Imp, the outer membrane protein OmpA and the porin OmpB was also observed. Analysis of the cell envelope proteome by 2D-HPLC-MSn provided a more complete assessment and identification scores suggested increased expression of many other proteins including AcrA and AcrB. Conclusion: The F1F0-ATP synthase proton pump complex provides the motive force for efflux activity and may modulate the membrane potential for porin selective molecular influx and presents a possible target protein complex for Mar. The expression of other outer membrane proteins, such as phospholipase A, was increased after treatment with fluoroquinolones and may provide alternative targets.",

Methods: A total of 34 Salmonella strains isolated from feces of patients with acute gastroenteritis isolated from different regions of Cuba in 2002 were received and processed in the laboratory of Clinical Microbiology of Cl\u00ednic Hospital in Barcelona. The antimicrobial susceptibility to 9 antibiotics: ampicillin, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, nalidixic acid, tetracycline, trimethoprim/sulphametoxazole, chloramphenicol, gentamicin, ciprofloxacin and spectinomycin, was determined using the agar dilution method. The molecular mechanisms of resistance to several antimicrobial agents were detected by PCR and the chloramphenicol acetyl transferase activity by a colorimetric assay. Analysis of molecular epidemiology was performed by pulsed field gel electrophoresis using the low frequency restriction enzyme XbaI. Results: Twenty-two strains presented resistance, 64% was multirresistant. The serotype Typhimurium phagetype 104 was the most frequent and presented similar genetic profiles of PFGE. High levels of resistance to tetracycline (53%), spectinomycin (50%), ampicillin (44%) and chloramphenicol (41%) were found. Resistance to tetracycline was associated with the tet G and tet A genes. Resistance to ampicillin was due to the presence of b-lactamases, mainly the CARB type. The floR gene was the main mechanism of resistance to chloramphenicol. Among the susceptible strains, six belong to the serotype Agona were epidemiologically related. Conclusions: The presence of two main clones was detected in Cuba, with the widespread dissemination of a multiresistant clone of Salmonella enterica serotype Typhimurium DT 104 and an antimicrobial susceptible clone of Salmonella enterica serotype Agona in two separate regions in the country.",

In the present study, we examined susceptibilities and characterized resistance to betalactams and fluoroquinolones in clinical isolates of P. putida. Methods: Six clinical isolates of P. putida from the different patients and Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO-1 were used. These isolates showed different pulsed-field gel electrophoresis genotypes. MICs were determined by an agar dilution method as described by the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards. Detection of the metallo-beta-lactamase genes, blaIMP-1, blaVIM-1 and blaVIM-2, was carried out by polymerase chain reaction amplification. Outer membrane protein profiles were characterized by SDS-PAGE. Nucleotide sequences of the quinolone resistance-detemining regions (QRDRs) of the gyrA, gyrB and parC genes were determined in 6 isolates of P. putida and P. aeruginosa PAO-1. Results: Five P. putida isolates showed resistance to betalactams, including ampicillin (>128 mg/L), ceftazidime (>128 mg/L) and carbapenems (8->128 mg/L) such as imipenem and meropenem. Four isolates showed high resistance to fluoroquinolones (>128 mg/L), including norfloxacin, levofloxacin, sparfloxacin, gatifloxacin and pazufloxacin. The MIC range for sitafloxacin was between <0.25 and 8 mg/L. Four isolates resistant to both beta-lactams and fluoroquinolones also showed minocycline resistance (>16 mg/L). One isolate was susceptible to both beta-lactams and fluoroquinolones. All of carbapenemresistant isolates had the blaIMP-1 gene. In one isolate highly resistant to all carbapenems (>128 mg/L) except sitafloxacin (8 mg/L) SDS-PAGE showed reduced production of a protein band, which was identified as OprD by amino acid sequencing. Some specific mutations conferring fluoroquinolone resistance were found in the QRDRs of GyrA (Thr83Ile), GyrB (Glu469Asp) and ParC (Ser87Leu) in P. putida isolates. Conclusion: Five of 6 isolates of P. putida were resistant to carbapenems because of acquisition of the metallo-bata-lactamase gene. Our results suggested that reduced production of OprD was associated with increse in MICs of carbapenems. Four isolates showing resistance to fluoroquinolones except sitafloxacin had a combination of 3 amino acid alterations in the QRDRs of GyrA, GyrB and ParC.",

            "text": "Porin expression among clinical isolates of Escherichia coli showing AmpC-hyperproduction phenotype Objectives: From June-August 2004, ARMRL received 4 carbapenem-resistant isolates of K. pneumoniae from separate patients on the Liver ICU of a London tertiary care hospital for investigation. Two isolates were from blood cultures, one from bronchial washings and one from a wound swab. All patients had clinical infections and were treated with broadspectrum antibiotics, including colistin. One patient with bacteraemia died shortly after beginning treatment, but there was no other attributable mortality. We sought to define the resistance mechanisms of the isolates. Methods: Isolates were compared by PFGE of XbaI-digested genomic DNA and analysed with BioNumerics software. MICs were determined and interpreted according to BSAC guidelines. Isolates were screened for beta-lactamase genes, including those for known carbapenemases by PCR. Imipenem hydrolysis was investigated by spectrophotometry. Iso-electric focusing (IEF) was performed to visualise beta-lactamase. Outer membrane profiles were examined by SDS-PAGE analysis. Results: The four isolates were 95% similar by PFGE and represented a single strain. Their antibiogram was complex. Resistance was evident to ertapenem (MIC > 16 mg/L), but less marked to meropenem (MIC 4-16 mg/L) and imipenem (1-8 mg/L). MICs were unaffected by EDTA, and no carbapenemase activity or genes were detected by spectrophotometry or PCR, respectively. Resistance to all cephalosporins tested, including cefepime (MIC > 64 mg/L), was not reduced significantly by clavulanate; isolates were also highly resistant to cefoxitin (MIC > 64 mg/L). Isolates were resistant to gentamicin, tobramycin and ciprofloxacin. All were susceptible to colistin, and 3 showed borderline susceptibility to amikacin (MIC 4 mg/L). Two beta-lactamases were apparent by IEF, and were consistent with the group 1 blaCTX-M and blaOXA-1-like alleles detected by PCR; blaSHV was also detected. Neither IEF nor PCR yielded evidence of AmpC production. SDS-PAGE showed the loss of a major outer membrane protein (OMP). Conclusions: Impermeability, associated with OMP loss, combined with the production of group 1 CTX-M and OXA-1-like enzymes appears to underlie the complex pattern of beta-lactam resistance in this K. pneumoniae strain. However, the lack of potentiation of cephalosporins by clavulanate is unusual for CTX-M producing klebsiellae, as is the carbapenem resistance. Limited treatment options for these more resistant variants poses a significant clinical problem.",

Little is known about mutator strains from patients with acute infections among which hypermutation seems to be rare. The aim of our study was (I) to characterize the molecular alteration responsible for the mutator phenotype and (II) to investigate mutationmediated resistance in a multiresistant mutator strain of P. aeruginosa from an ICU patient. Methods: A multiresistant P. aeruginosa strain was isolated from a wound swab from a 63-year old patient in an IC unit of a German hospital in 2004. The strain showed resistance to Levofloxacin and Piperacillin and intermediate resistance to Imipenem, Ceftazidime, and Gentamicin. Hypermutation was detected by disk diffusion tests. Mutation frequency was determined on selective rifampicin agar. The mismatch repair system genes mutS, mutL and uvrD were amplified and sequenced. Effluxpump overexpression was detected by testing levofloxacin MICs both with and without the effluxpump inhibitor 110 . MexR coding for the repressor of the mexABoprM operon and the QRDR of gyrA and parC and were amplified and sequenced. Results: The mutation rate of the strain was 2.26 \u00b7 10 )6 . Sequencing of the mismatch repair system genes revealed a 1 bp deletion (A1250) in mutL resulting in a frameshift. The levofloxacin MIC was reduced from 128 mg/L to 2 mg/L in presence of 110 indicating effluxpump overexpression and alterations in type II topoisomerases. In mexR a N insertion after L52 was detected. Two changes in gyrA (T83I, D87G) and one change in parC (S80L) were found. Conclusions: This is the first genetic characterisation of a multiresistant mutator strain of P. aeruginosa from an ICU patient with an acute infection. A new mutation in mutL of P. aeruginosa responsible for the mutator phenotype was found. A mutator phenotype can confer a selective advantage in stressful environments. So, one could consider coselection of the mutator and the mutation-mediated resistance phenotype in this strain. Further work will be necessary to understand the underlying mechanisms of this evolutionary process in a strain of a patient with an acute infection.",

Garc\u00eda-Lobo, J. Ag\u00fc ero (Santander, E) Objective: To describe a new variant of the aadA gene encoding resistance to aminoglycosides, as the result of a sequence reassortment between the aadA2 and aadA1a gene cassettes. Methods: A total of 78 clinical isolates of Yersinia enterocolitica collected from different patients in our area between 1994 and 2003, were analysed for the presence of class 1 integrons. Identification and susceptibility testing were performed with the Microscan Walkaway System (Dade Behring). Susceptibility to chloramphenicol, nalidixic acid, tetracycline, kanamycin, streptomycin and spectinomycin was determined by disk-diffusion. Strains were screened by PCR using primers specific for IntI1 gene, and gene cassettes were identified by sequencing the PCR products of the integron variable regions obtained with primers 5'CS and 3'CS. Results: Sixty out of the 78 Y. enterocolitica isolates (77%) showed the presence of integrons, and they could all be grouped into two clusters of 1000 bp (45 isolates) and 1900 bp (15 isolates) according to the two patterns obtained from the amplification of the variable region. The sequencing of the 1000 bp products revealed the presence of a new aadA gene cassette the sequence of which was a mosaic built up from pieces from both aadA2 and aadA1a. All the isolates were resistant to streptomycin, spectinomycin and chloramphenicol, and susceptible to gentamicin, tobramycin, amikacin and kanamycin. Conclusions: The new aadA gene described here enlarges the reported examples of integron containing gene cassettes. Furthermore, nucleotide sequence analysis revealed that new gene variants can be produced in nature by exchange mechanisms probably mediated by homologous recombination.",

Mikelsaar (Tartu, EST) Increasing antimicrobial resistance among E. coli (Ec) causing urinary tract infection (UTI) is a serious worldwide problem. The treatment with co-trimoxazole (ST), a combination of sulfamethoxazol (Sulfa) and trimetoprim, often does not prevent recurrent UTI (rUTI). The sensitivity to antibiotics of consecutive rUTI isolates is usually detected by disk-diffusion or E-test, but it does not always reflect the presence of resistance genes. Sulfa resistance in enterobacteria arises from acquisition of two additional genes, sulI and sulII, encoding the dihydropteroate synthetase. These genes are located on different types of mobile elements: sulI is associated with type I integrons and sulII with non-conjugative plasmids. However, there are few data on the prevalence of Sulfa resistant genes and integron 1 in community-acquired Ec strains isolated from children with rUTI. One of the putative reasons for rUTI may lie in non-accordance of pheno-and genotypical results of antibiotic susceptibility determination, resulting in non-efficient antimicrobial treatment. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of Sulfa resistance genes (Int1, SulI and SulII) among Ec causing rUTI in children. Material and methods: Altogether 29 consecutive Ec isolates from 10 rUTI patients (Tartu University Children Hospital) with changes in antibiotic resistance to ST were applied. Ec resistance to Sulfa was detected by E-test (Bio Mereux). DNA was extracted using QIAamp DNA Mini Kit (QIAGEN). Int1, sulI and sulII genes were detected by PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction) . Results: 20 out of 29 (65.5%) Ec isolates were resistant to Sulfa (MIC 3 512 mg/L). Int 1 was present in 15 out 29 (51.7%) Ec isolates. SulI and/or sulII genes were detected in all resistant Ec isolates. Three different combinations of genes were found: 9 isolates contained sulI and sulII; 3 isolates only sulI and 8 isolates only sulII gene. Among 9 phenotypically sensitive Ec strains 3 isolates (MIC 8 mg/L) carried sulI and sulII genes while 6 strains (MIC 12-32 mg/L) did not contain any of the three genes.",

Krogfelt (Copenhagen, DK) Objectives: The increased number of gastrointestinal infections and the rapid increase in antibiotic bacterial resistance, makes investigation of antibiotic resistance development during intestinal colonization a very important issue. The objectives are to investigate a Klebsiella pneumoniae strain's ability to conjugate with Escherichia coli, in vitro in vivo, and to characterise the transconjugants by plasmid profiling and restriction fragment analysis. Methods: The donor K. pneumoniae ATCC 700721 strain was a multi-resistant mucoid strain, which contains three large plasmids (100--150 kbp.) and two small ones (<7 kbp.). The recipient was an E. coli MG1655 StrepR, RifR. The in vitro conjugation was performed on solid and liquid media, whereas the in vivo conjugations were performed during colonisation of the large intestine of streptomycin/ampicillin treated mice. Transconjugants were isolated from both in vitro and in vivo experiments. A combination of plasmid purification (which purify large plasmids in a way that allows following restriction cutting), plasmid profiles, and restriction fragment analysis, was used to characterise the transconjugants obtained from these experiments. Results: In vitro conjugation between K. pneumoniae and E. coli showed transfer of either only 1 or all 5 plasmids depending on the conditions. When K. pneumoniae was used to colonise the large intestine, it was shown that K. pneumoniae transferred one of its plasmids containing antibiotic resistance genes to an indigenous E. coli strain. When mice were co-infected with K. pneumoniae and the laboratory E. coli strain, it was seen that K. pneumoniae again transferred its plasmid with antibiotic resistance to E. coli. Both the laboratory strain and the indigenous E. coli with the newly acquired plasmids were tested for their conjugative ability and it was seen that they both had obtained conjugative plasmids from K. pneumoniae. Furthermore, the plasmids were characterised by restriction fragment analysis confirming, that all the transconjugants plasmids were identical with the plasmids from the original donor; the K. pneumoniae ATCC 700721. Conclusion: K. pneumoniae ATCC 700721 contains conjugative plasmids, and conjugation is occurring in a high frequency both in vivo and in vitro. The type of plasmid, which is conjugated depends on the environmental conditions.",

Campo-Esquisabel, M.E. Cano, J. Calvo-Montes, J. Ag\u00fc ero, L. Mart\u00ednez-Mart\u00ednez (Santander, E) Objectives: MICs of Cefepime (FEP) against P. aeruginosa are usually similar to those of Ceftazidime (CAZ), but isolates expressing efflux pumps and containing PSE-1 or OXA enzymes may present MICs of FEP higher than those of CAZ. In this study we have evaluated the Microscan Walkaway system (W/A) for detecting P. aeruginosa isolates with any of the following phenotypes: 1. CAZ susceptible (S) and FEP intermediate (I); 2. CAZ-S and FEP resistant (R); 3. CAZ-I and FEP-R. The presence of Class 1 integrons in these isolates was also investigated. Methods: From May to Sept. 2004, all P. aeruginosa isolates (one per patient) I or R to FEP and S to CAZ, and the first 30 strains I or R to both CAZ and FEP were evaluated. MICs of FEP and CAZ were determined by reference microdilution (NCCLS guidelines). Then clinical categories obtained with W/A for organisms with any of the previously indicated phenotypes were compared with those obtained by the reference method. Class 1 integrons were detected by PCR using primers specific for the type 1 integrase gene and primers specific for conserved regions 5' and 3' of class 1 integrons. Gene cassettes were identified by sequencing the amplicons obtained from two different isolates for each integron type found. Results: The following phenotypes of CAZ/FEP and number of isolates were identified by the W/A system as: S/I:9; S/R:4; I/ I:15; R/I:4, and R/R:11. Reference microdilution confirmed that 23 isolates were more susceptible to CAZ than to FEP. The W/A correctly identified 13 out of these isolates (53.5% sensitivity). Reference microdilution confirmed higher susceptibility to CAZ than to FEP in all 13 isolates detected by W/A (100% specificity). For the 23 isolates, the W/A did not cause any Major (false resistance) error for CAZ or FEP. The phenotypes of CAZ/FEP for the 10 isolates not recognized by W/A were I/I (n = 6), R/I (n = 3) or R/R (n = 1). A class 1 integron was identified in 18 out of the 23 (78.3%)isolates: 13 with a 1600 bp integron, coding for an OXA protein which shares the highest aminoacid identity with group II OXA enzymes (77%), 3 with a 1200 bp integron, coding for PSE-1, and 2 in which PCR failed to amplify any integron conserved region. Conclusions: The W/A system is very specific, but poorly sensitive, for recognition of P. aeruginosa more susceptible to CAZ than to FEP. In our centre, this phenotype is often associated to the presence of integrons coding for an OXA enzyme or PSE-1.",

MICs of various classes of antimicrobial agents were determined by Etest using Muller-Hinton agar. Betalactamase induction was attempted using cefoxitin challenge (10 mg/L, 2 h) and specific beta-lactamase assays were performed using nitrocefin with (L2) or without (L1+L2) EDTA (500 mM). RNA extraction and RT-PCR for smeE and smeF used kits from Quiagen. Results: From parent isolate K279a one high level meropenemresistant (MIC \u2021 512) and one high level ceftazidime resistant mutant (MIC = 16) were selected. From parent isolate N531 one high level meropenem resistant mutant was selected (MIC \u2021 512). Beta-lactamase assays in the absence of inducer revealed that none of these mutants over-express beta-lactamase. Indeed, unlike the parent strains, beta-lactamase expression in the mutants was not inducible under the conditions tested. MICs of other classes of antimicrobials revealed increased MICs of fluoroquinolones against the beta-lactam resistant mutants. RT-PCR confirmed that smeDEF are not overexpressed in any of the mutants. Conclusions: These data suggest that beta-lactam resistance is part of an MDR phenotype in some S. maltophilia mutants. The mechanism involved appears to alter drug accumulation rates, since beta-lactam inducer was not able to reach a concentration high enough to stimulate beta-lactamase expression. The mechanism is most likely to be efflux-pump mediated, suggesting the existence of a previously uncharacterised efflux pump in S. maltophilia.",

Antibiotic resistance is an increasing problem for effective therapeutic strategies and it is important to understand the mechansims of resistance. Beta-Lactam antibiotics are known to bind to and inhibit PBPs which leads to a disturbance of the peptidoglycan metabolism. Until now there is only little information about the PBPs of Aeromonas veronii. Eight PBPs with different molecular masses were identified. Tn5 insertion mutants of Aeromonas that over-express beta-lactamases have a disruption within one of two different genes. The partial sequences of both gene products have been assigned functions as D-D-carboxypeptidases. We identified the complete sequence of one of the inactivated genes encoding a D-D-carboxypeptidase with homology to PBP4 from different species, in order to create a basis for further studies of the cell wall metabolism and beta-lactamase induction. Methods: Purified genomic DNA from one Tn5 insertion mutant was digested with EcoRI or SalI. The DNA-fragments were ligated into an equal linearized vector, pSU18 and transformed into E. coli DH5a. The selected colonies were investigated for recombinant plasmids with the correct insert. Sequences were determined using primer walking strategy. Results: The sequenced fragment codes for an open reading frame of 481 amino acids with a calculated MW of 52 kDa. This MW is in good agreement with the MW of PBP4 from E. coli, Vibrio and Shewanella where the MW ranges between 52-56 kDa. The deduced protein shows homology to PBP4 from different species, a bifunctional enzyme with both D-D-carboxypeptidase and D-D-endopeptidase function. All characteristic active-site fingerprints of PBPs are located in the sequence. Conclusions: This is the first complete sequence of a PBP of the genus Aeromonas.

The aim of the present study was to investigate inducible metronidazole (MTR) resistant in B. fragilis strains. Methods: Of 18 B. fragilis strains (including 4 nim-positive reference strains and one ATCC strain) MIC values for MTR were determined by E-test and analysed for nim-genes (A-D) by PCR. After that bacterial suspension were incubated on supplemented columbia agar plates containing MTR at twice the MICvalue of the specific strain tested and incubated under anaerobic conditions for 48 h. After incubation growing bacteria were harvested and cultivated and thereafter incubated at 4 times MIC. This procedure was repeated with increasing antibiotic concentrations. The resulting MIC-values were confirmed by E-test. Results: The MIC-values for MTR of the four nim-positive reference strains ranged from 3 to 8 mg/L. Three clinical isolates of B. fragilis strains showed MIC-values >256 mg/L. In all 3 strains the nim-gene was detected by PCR. The B. fragilis ATCC 25285 strain was nim-negative with a MIC-value of 0.19 mg/L. The other 10 clinical isolates of B. fragilis were also nim-negative. MIC-values ranged from 0.25 to 0.75 mg/L. The nim-positive reference strains showed after few passages MIC-values >256 mg/L for MTR. After several passages on MTR containing agar, all other B. fragilis strains including the ATCC 25285 strain exhibited MIC values of 8 to 256 mg/L. Conclusion: MTR resistance can be selected not only in nimpositive B. fragilis strains but also in nim-negative strains. This suggests that mechanisms other than nim are involved in MTR resistance. These findings underscore the importance of susceptibility testing of anaerobes even in routine laboratories.",

Materials and methods: A total of 185 Gram-negative anaerobic bacteria collected from eight hospitals in Athens, Greece, were tested for metronidazole resistance using the Etest method on brucella blood agar plates. Incubation in a ChelLab Anaerobic Chamber was performed for 48 hours. Interpretation of the results was according to NCCLS guidelines. For quality control the strains B. fragilis ATCC25285 and B. thetaiotaomicron ATCC29741 were used. Strains having an MIC > 1 mg/L were screened for nim genes by PCR using the nim 3 /nim 5 set of primers. PCR products were stained with ethidium bromide and documented under UV illumination. Sequencing was performed in an ABI 3100 genetic analyzer using the BigDye terminator kit. The Blast search programme of the National Center for Biotechnology Information was used to search the Gene Bank for significant alignments. Results: A total of 16 isolates having an MIC > 1 mg/L were detected (four Bacteroides fragilis group, eight Prevotella spp., one Bacteroides spp. non-fragilis and three miscellaneous). Three, three, two, one and seven strains had MICs of 2, 4, 8, 16 and 32 mg/L or higher, respectively. Eight strains were positive by PCR for the 458 bp amplicon, of which three had a metronidazole MIC of 4 to 16 mg/L (lower than the current NCCLS breakpoint). DNA sequencing revealed that one, two, two and three strains harboured nimA, nimC, nimD and nimE genes, respectively. No strain was detected harbouring the nimB gene. No particular relationship was detected regarding species or MIC distribution and nim gene class. Conclusions: Nitroimidazole resistance determinants were detected among both metronidazole resistant and susceptible Gram-negative anaerobic bacteria in Greece. This study confirms the widespread occurrence of nim genes and demonstrates that 'silent' nim genes can be detected by PCR in metronidazole susceptible isolates.Members of The Hellenic Study Group on Gram-Negative Anaerobic Bacteria are: A.

Rodriguez-Cr\u00e9ixems, E. Bouza (Madrid, E) Background: We report a high prevalence (6%) of metronidazole (MTZ) resistance in Clostridium difficile in our institution. Resistance to MTZ seems to be heterogeneous and unstable. We observed morphological alterations in the strains growing in the presence of metronidazole. Objective: The aim of this study was to characterize these morphological changes and to study the stability of the altered phenotypes after MTZ removal. Methods: We selected a total of 18 isolates which were resistant to metronidazole (MICs from 16 to 64 mg/L). C. difficile ATCC 9689 was also included as a control. Brain Heart Infusion broth tubes (B.H.I.) were prepared with 4 and 8 mg/L MTZ. Brucella plates without antibiotic were also used. Bacterial morphology was evaluated by microscopy (Gram-stained) and also by plate colonies. A volume of 0.1 mL, from a 0.5 McFarland culture, was used to inoculate the B.H.I. tubes. Broths were incubated at 37\u00b0C in an anaerobic chamber for 10 days. Every two days, the cultures were screened by microscopy and by serial passages performed on Brucella plates without antibiotic. Plates were further incubated under the same conditions and observed for 10 days. Results: The ATCC 9689 C. difficile strain was not able to grow in the presence of any of the MTZ concentrations. Gram stains of MTZ-resistant C. difficile strains, grown in the presence of both assayed MTZ concentrations, revealed Gram-positive coccoid forms that co-existed, at first with typical Gram-positive bacillary forms, which became progressively predominant during the 10 day-period. Subcultures of the antibiotic B.H.I. tubes on Brucella plates rendered colonies with an atypical white appearance and round shape. Colonies reverted progressively to typical C. difficile phenotypes and after 7-10 days' incubation in free-MTZ Brucella plates, they showed their characteristic pleomorphic and yellow-green, ground glass appearance. Gram staining of the reverted phenotypes showed the typical spore-forming, Gram-positive bacilli. Conclusions: The presence of MTZ induces morphological changes in C. difficile that can easily be reverted in antibioticfree medium. A similar phenomenon has been described in another genus (Helicobacter pylori), and is related to a decrease in intracellular ATP levels, although further studies are needed to explain this phenomenon in C. difficile.",

            "text": "Objectives: The increasing prevalence of bacterial resistance to antibiotics is a worldwide problem for the therapy of infectious diseases. Among the three basic mechanism leading to antibiotic resistance, i.e. alteration of the target, inactivation of the drug , and reduced accumulation of the drug at the target site, the latter has become the most important resistance-mechanism due to the following reasons: (i) it is the most abundant mechanism detectable in both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, (ii) it often mediates multi drug resistance (mdr) to a broad range of -unrelated -drug classes, (iii) it can favor the acquisition of additional mechanisms of resistance. Most frequently mdr is achieved by one of several mutations resulting in the deregulation of mdr efflux pump expression. The major multidrug efflux pump in E.coli AcrAB-TolC is a constitutively expressed tripartite complex consisting of a RND-type transporter AcrB, a membrane fusion protein AcrA and an outer membrane channel TolC. The expression of acrAB is regulated by a local repressor AcrR and known global regulator systems MarRAB, SoxRS and Rob. Since any mutation inactivating AcrR or a global regulator, like MarR may result in acrAB overexpression, detection of a resistance mutation requires extensive sequencing and additional susceptibility tests using different antibiotics. Methods: Thus, a reporter gene system has been developed that senses alterations in the expression of the AcrAB-TolC efflux pump caused by induction and/or mutation/deletion of the local and/or global regulators. Briefly, the luciferase gene luc of the firefly Photinus pyralis as a reporter gene was fused to the promotor pacrAB by a modified PCR technique (SOEing) and inserted into the plasmid pBR322. Results: Firefly luciferase as a reporter is advantageous due to the high sensitivity with no background activity, wide range of applicability, ease of use and cost efficiency. Alterations in the expression of acrAB either due to the presence of inductors or mutations in marR could be detected as increased luciferase activities by this reporter gene system. Conclusions: Thus, this newly developed reporter gene system can be used to identify acrR mutants and to quantify alterations of the expression of the acrAB operon. Moreover, it is a useful tool to study under different environmental conditions the expression and to screen for inductors or inhibitors of the AcrAB-TolC efflux pump.",

Ciofu, N. Hoiby, B. Wretlind (Stockholm, S; Copenhagen, DK) Objectives: Multidrug efflux system plays a prominent role in resistance to several antibiotics in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. To date, 7 different MDR efflux systems have been characterized in P. aeruginosa: MexAB-OprM, MexCD-OprJ, MexEF-OprN, MexXY-OprM, MexJK-OprM, MexVW-OprM and MexHI-OpmD. The aim of the present investigation was to discern to which extent overexpression of efflux pumps contributes to antimicrobial resistance, with particular interest on quinolone and aminoglycoside resistance in P. aeruginosa strains from CF-patients. Methods: Twenty Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates collected from six cystic fibrosis (CF) patients, aged 27 to 33, in 1994 (9 isolates) and 1997 (11 isolates) at the CF Center, Copenhagen, Denmark, were studied. MICs to norfloxacin, ciprofloxacin, amikacin, tobramycin, tetracycline, ceftazidime, piperacillin/ tazobactam, meropenem and imipenem were determined using Etest. The relative expression of mRNA for four efflux pump proteins was determined by real-time PCR and correlated with susceptibilities to two fluoroquinolones and seven other antimicrobial agents. Results: A strain was considered to hyperproduce mRNA for pump proteins if cDNA level was >5x strain PAO1. MexY mRNA overproduction (18/20 strains) did not seem to achieve clinically relevant levels of resistance to quinolones but was correlated with decreased susceptibility to aminoglycosides. MexB overproduction (3/20 strains, <23x PAO1) did not mediate any significant quinolone resistance, but seemed to decrease susceptibilities to other antimicrobials. High-level overexpression of MexD (4/20) affected quinolone susceptibility. No clear correlation between the R82L alteration in 16/20 strains in NfxB (regulates MexCD-OprJ) and MexD mRNA hyperproduction was seen. MexF mRNA expressed at high levels (6/20) was correlated with resistance to quinolones and imipenem. Conclusion: Elevated production of mRNA for the four efflux pumps tested correlated not only to decreased susceptibility to quinolones, but also to other antimicrobials including penems, aminoglycosides and beta-lactams.",

Objectives: The laboratory surveillance of Salmonella in Italy has a high level of integration among involved institutions. It is represented by the Enter-net system, coordinated by the Istituto Superiore di Sanit\u00e0, which concerns notifications from human cases, food items and environmental sampling, and the Entervet network, coordinated by the Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale delle Venezie, which collects information on isolations from animals and food of animal origin. Methods: The networks use harmonised microbiological methods and share their databases. Data on Salmonella serotypes, phagetypes and antimicrobial resistance are collected with epidemiological informations. Each year, the network collects and analyzes data on about 6000 human isolates and 2000 isolates each from animals, foods and environment. More than 70% of the human isolates is represented by S. typhimurium (ST) and S. enteritidis. Subdivision within phagetypes is becoming necessary to elucidate outbreaks during investigations because, since the 1990s, some phagetype of epidemiological importance have predominated: S. enteritidis phagetype 4 and S. typhimurium phagetype 104 are the more common phagetypes among human and animal isolates. Molecular typing may be an important subtyping tool for isolates belonging to the same phagetype and Pulsed-Field Gel Electrophoresis analysis is considered the gold standard method. Results: An accurate analysis of the Enter-net and Enter-vet databases allowed us to detect an increase during 2002 and 2003 in the prevalence of S. typhimurium non phagetypable (NT) and of an atypical monophasic strain, defined as 4,5,12: i,-, both in human cases and in veterinary samples. ST NT accounted for the 25% of the ST isolated in humans during this period and for the 20% of the ST isolated from sample of swine origin. The resistance to Ampicillin, Streptomycin, Sulphonamides, and Tetracycline is the typical profile found in a high percentage of human and swine strains such as PFGE shows the same profile of restriction for the most part of human and swine ST NT isolates. Conclusions: The Italian surveillance integrated network for Salmonella represents an important database for the study of Salmonella infection epidemiology. Epidemiological data together with serotyping, phagetyping and molecular typing of Salmonella isolates from human and animal sources provide further information for a better estimate of risk factor for human infections. Background: Crimean-Congo Haemorrhagic Fever (CCHF) is a potentially fatal viral infection caused by a tick-born virus, nosocomial outbreaks with high mortality among hospital staff been documented. Sporadic cases occur through In 1999, 3 health care workers (HCWs) in Iran were infected with CCHF virus following contact with one suspected case of CCHF that one of them died. Systan-Baluchestan (south-east of Iran) and Isfahan (centre of Iran) provinces are now endemic area of CCHF infection in Iran. HCWs of these two provinces are frequently in contact with CCHF cases. Materials & Methods: 191 pre-tested and self-administered questionnaires were filled by HCWs who work in admitting wards of hospitals of Systan-Baluchestan and Isfahan provinces of Iran. Collected data was analysed to determine the level of Abstracts knowledge and attitude of these staff and to distinguish the predicting factors of knowledge and attitude. Results: 82% of these HCWs had good knowledge on CCHF, while 83% showed acceptable attitude towards the disease. Knowledge is directly associated with attitude (p < 0.03). Those in higher job rank had better knowledge (p < 0.001) and higher attitude (p < 0.01). The most common used source of data on CCHF was 'Poster and pamphlet' (32.2%) among these HCWs. Those who used 'Poster and pamphlets' had higher knowledge (p < 0.05). No significant difference was seen among different sex, job or provinces groups in using 'Poster and pamphlets'. The most common type of contact to CCHF patients was 'Intact skin to blood' contact in 37.3% of enrolled HCWs, while 10% had 'Percutaneous' contact with CCHF cases. Working in Systan-Baluchestan province was accompanied with higher risk of contact with CCHF cases (p < 0.05). Conclusion: We conclude that enrolled HCWs in Systan-Baluchestan and Isfahan provinces of Iran had acceptable knowledge and attitude. Improvement of knowledge via 'Poster and pamphlet' could be an effective modality in these setting. Health authority should pay more attention on Systan-Baluchestan province to provide it with sufficient and effective universal protection to lower nosocomial transmission risk of CCHF in HCWs of this area.",

Conclusions: This is the largest study so far made of the geography and type of housing of Campylobacter cases. We found that children living in non-urban areas are at increased risk of Campylobacter infections. Under the assumption that risk foods (i.e. fresh chicken in particular) are equally distributed across the country, the results indicate that exposures via animals and the environment are the sources of a substantial proportion of sporadic infections of Campylobacter among children in the countryside. Furthermore, contaminated drinking water is a likely explanation of the finding of varying risks between municipalities, since people in different municipalities have different water suppliers in Denmark.",

The aim of the study presented here is to determine vulnerability index of populations living in the Ile-de-Cayenne for tuberculosis, in order to produce risk map for tuberculosis. Methods: A geographic information system (G.I.S.) is a tool that allows to organize and analyze data that can be referenced spatially, i.e. data that can be tied to a physical location. Many types of data have a spatial aspect, including epidemiological studies. A digital map from IGN and a Spot-5 satellite image were included in the G.I.S. as a cartographic base. In addition, data that should be used to assess the degree of insalubrity of the urban area was included, as well as demographic data that can influence transmission rate. These different layers were cross-linked to assess the vulnerability index of populations.

The water disinfecting method presented in this work is based on the destructive impact of low concentrations of metal ions on bacteria in water. During the disinfection process, alloyed electrodes are placed into the water body and a current applied to the electrode causes the release of metal ions. The metal ions bind to the bacterial cell wall, causing its disruption and lyses. The efficacy of using different metal ions (Ag + , Cu 2+ , Au) combinations (within the limits of current drinking water regulations) for killing typhoid-paratyphoid, Legionella pneumophila, Salmonella, V. Cholerae etc. has been examined. The cultivation, culture enrichment and the testing bacteria were performed following the Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and Wastewater (American Public Health Association, 1995) for the evaluation of disinfection.",

Because of these characteristics A. urinae is often misidentified as a streptococcus, enterococcus, or staphylococcus. In addition, there were also reported several cases of blood culture negative infections due to A. urinae. Most infections are mild, but serious ones such as endocarditis and septicemia can occur. To our best knowledge, the total number of thirteen cases of infective endocarditis including eight fatal cases have been described in the world literature so far. Objectives: Antimicrobial resistance in campylobacters has become a subject of great concern as resistant strains are more and more commonly found in samples of both human and animal origin. C. jejuni ATCC 33560-strain has been confirmed to be a suitable quality control (QC) strain for campylobacters. However, so far only tentative ranges of minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) for this strain are available. In this study a broth microdilution method (VetMIC TM ) was validated for C. jejuni. The manufacturer's method guideline for VetMIC TM Camp-plates (SVA, Sweden) was modified to standardize the size of the inoculum. Methods: A nephelometer and colony counts were used to measure inoculum densities. Inoculum sizes were determined for bovine intestinal isolates and repeatedly for the QC strain using both pre-incubation and direct inoculation. The QC strain was tested in 28 independent VetMIC TM -procedures using preincubation in broth and 25 times by direct inoculation. Results: No correlation was detected between colony counts and McFarland levels by nephelometer. It was concluded that standardizing the inoculum size could not be based on this, for other bacteria commonly used method. However, it was noticed that growing campylobacters in Brucella broth for 24 hours yielded consistently approximately 10 to the 8th CFU/ml. The mean cell density for bovine isolates was 8.2 log10 CFU/ml with the standard deviation (SD) of 0.3 when campylobacters were pre-incubated in broth (n = 140). By direct inoculation the mean cell density was 8.9 log10 CFU/ml (SD 0.2, n = 156). Cell densities for the QC strain were 8.3 log10 CFU/ml (SD 0.2, n = 24) and 8.9 log10 CFU/ml (SD 0.2, n = 27) respectively. Preincubation in broth yielded more accurately the target inoculum size of 10 to the 8th CFU/ml. All VetMIC TM -results of the QC strain for erythromycin, nalixidic acid, oxytetracyclin and gentamicin by both methods were within tentative QC ranges given by NCCLS. Slight differences could be seen in distributions of results between methods. Based on the results we set QC limits of 2-8 mg/l for ampicillin and 0.25-0.5 mg/l for enrofloxacin to be used in our laboratory for the modified method.",

Four human stools (13.3%) from the diseased were analysed on: Salmonella spp., Shigella spp., Yersinia spp., Vibrio spp., Campylobacter spp., Rota and Adenoviruses, intestinal protozoa and helmint eggs. Six water samples were examined bacteriologically, virologically and parasitologically. Results: All diseased were drinking water from local drinking water distribution system, with pipelines very distant from the water source. Main symptoms were abdominal pain, watery diarrhoea and tiredness. Most of the patients recovered completely after 48 hrs and were only treated symptomatically. 28 persons (78%) from control group didn't drink that water at all.All stool samples were negative on viruses, parasites and bacterial pathogens. The result of water analyses was negative for viruses and intestinal parasites. Bacteriological analyses of first water sample showed that the number of aerobic mesophilic and psychrophilic bacteria per ml was higher than standard.",

Further analysis of the last two stool samples included additional testing of pink colonies from CIN agar. They were transferred on Kligler Iron Agar and incubated at 37\u00b0C and 25\u00b0C. Oxydase and catalase tests were positive and Api 20E and BBL crystals confirmed isolates as A. hydrophila. Stool and water isolates showed same susceptibility patterns for antibiotics (resistance to amoxicillin and cefazolin). This was the first confirmed isolation of these bacteria as cause of an outbreak in our County. After cleaning, chlorination and connection to new water source, water samples were in accordance to the standards. There were no new cases. Conclusion: Identical biochemical and antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of human and water strains, with positive clinical findings and epidemiological data showed us that this small outbreak was due to A. hydrophila. This conclusion was supported by negative tests for other pathogens. Real prevalence of this pathogen is still unknown and probably underestimated.",

Methods: Antimicrobial susceptibility to 23 antibiotics was determined by disk diffusion in 380 Salmonella spp. isolates submitted to LNRSSE from all Spanish regions with the following distribution by serotypes: Enteritidis (n = 176), Typhimurium (n = 60) and other serotypes (n = 144). Molecular epidemiology of Enteritidis and Typhimurium serotypes was investigated using PFGE and computerized numerical analysis of the data. Phage typing was also performed. Results: Analysis was carried out with strains without epidemiological link. Analyzed Enteritidis strains (n = 96) were mainly from eggs and derived (27%) and from poultry and derived (24%), detecting 16 phage types (PT) with predominance of PT1 (39%). They were identified 9 pulsetypes, with a similarity genetic range of 81-96%, emerging a frequent clone (74%). Analyzed Typhimurium strains (n = 53) were from sausage and cold meat (21%), pig and derived (15%), and from poultry and derived (15%), detecting 12 DTs, with predominance of DT104 (28%) and U302 (19%). They were identified 13 pulsetypes, with a similarity genetic range of 64-86%, emerging a frequent clone (34%). Antimicrobial resistance rates (NCCLS, M100-S13) for the strains of Enteritidis, Typhimurium, and other 49 different serotypes (n = 115) were, respectively: ampicillin (8, 62 and 14%), spectinomycin (99, 87 and 100%), streptomycin (1, 53 and 59%), gentamicin (1, 4 and 0%), tobramycin (1, 4 and 0%), amikacin (1, 0 and 0%), netilmicin (1, 4 and 0%), nalidixic acid (41, 22 and 14%), tetracycline (16, 72 and 31%), sulphonamide (7, 62 and 21%), trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole (7, 19 and 14%) and cloramphenicol (0, 51 and 9% ",

Hoffmeyer (Geneve, CH; Paris, F) Background: Pseudomembranous colitis is a life threatening complication of broad spectrum antibiotic therapy caused by Clostridium difficile. The frequency of pseudomembranous colitis with potential fatal outcome is underestimated especially in elderly patients. Patients and methods: We report 5 cases of pseudomembranous colitis in elderly patients who had an adynamic ileus mimicking an acute abdomen. C. difficile was identified by toxins and culture. Plain films of the abdomen and CT were performed for all patients. Results: 5 females ( median age: 83 years-range: 76-95) were admitted in hospital for pneumonia (n = 1), osteomyelitis (n = 2), diarrhoea (n = 1), elective orthopaedic surgery (n = 1) and received a betalactamin (n = 4), or clindamycin (n = 1). Their co-morbidity were lupus (n = 2), diabetes mellitus (n = 1), cancer (n = 1), renal chronic failure (n = 1). They had fever (n = 5), bad general condition (n = 5), cramping abdominal pains (n = 5) following by an acute abdominal (n = 5). The diarrhoea was only present at the beginning of medical history for 2 patients. The biological exams found:white-cell count: 30.7 G/L (15.4-49.7); neutrophils polynuclear count: 25.8 G/L (10.1-41.2), platelets count: 481 G/L (313-622); C-reactive protein: 235 mg/l (180-300); creatinine:129 lmol/l (82-270); urea: 8.5 mmol/l (4-17.8). The liver tests and chest x-ray were all normal. Plain films of the abdomen showed a megacolon (n = 2). Abdomen CT suspected a volvulus of caecum (n = 1), diverticulitis (n = 1), found wall thickening of the transverse colon (n = 4), ascites (n = 1) but no perforation. 2 patients had have an abdominal laparoscopic exploration. After 4 days of treatment with metronidazole, the outcome was fatal for 2 patients due to heart failure. Discussion and conclusions: The diagnosis of pseudomembranous colitis must be evocated in elderly patients especially if an history of antibiotic therapy even a short course (for example perioperative prophylaxis) is found and cramping abdominal pain is associated with a high white cell count (> 25 G/L). If surgical treatment is required, the overall mortality increase.",

Methods: In this study, we have characterized a strain of thermophilic Campylobacter isolated in a patient with GBS, 37 strains of thermophilic Campylobacters isolated in patients with diarrhoea in Nis, and 6 strains from the collection of the Institute for Immunobiology and Virology ''Torlak'', Belgrad. Strains presumptively identified as campylobacters were differentiated to the species level by a combination of biotyping tests and by the use of a PCR-based RFLP test. HS serotyping was performed using a passive hemagglutination test using erythrocytes sensitized with heat extracted antigens and antisera. Conclusions: TGC is an expanded-broad-spectrum IV glycylcycline with activity against gram-positive, gram-negative and anaerobic pathogens, including strains resistant to commonly used antibiotics. TGC met statistical criteria for non-inferiority to the comparator IMI/CIS and appears to be safe and effecacious in the treatment of hospitalized patients with cIAI. Objective: The purpose of this study was to apply PCR based procedures to assess the stability of pathogen specific nucleic acid sequences present in frozen and archived faecal samples of the English Infectious Intestinal disease (IID). Methods: Faecal samples were collected from cases and controls as part of the IID study and were stored as frozen suspensions for eight to 12 years. Samples were selected from the archive where either Cryptosporidium, Giardia, Salmonella, Campylobacter, enteroaggregative Escherichia coli (EAggEC), In 13 patients more than one bacterium were found. The patients with PPB had 1.7 mean exacerbations/year compared to 1.5 in patients with non-PB. The patients were stratified according to severity of COPD: 18% were moderate (FEV1 ( 50%), 56% were severe (FEV1 (30% to (50%) and 26% were very severe (FEV1 ( 30%). In the very severe COPD group patients with PPB and non-PB had 2.2 and 1.9 and in the severe COPD group patients had 1.5 and 1.4 mean exacerbations/year, respectively. There was not a higher frequency of colonisation in current smokers as compared to ex-smokers neither in the whole group nor when stratified for severity. Conclusion: 46% of the 575 stable COPD patients spontaneously produced sputum, and of these 33% had pathogenic bacteria. There was no correlation between colonisation and current smoking. The patients with colonisation had an increased number of severe exacerbations, even when stratified for severity of COPD, suggesting that the presence of bacteria is clinically relevant. The next step will be to perform intervention studies aimed at reducing colonisation.",

The respiratory frequency was higher, and the oxygen saturation lower. A promising predictor was found in the measure of CRP found to be higher in pneumonic patients.

Materials and methods: Epidemiological records of all community outbreaks of legionellosis reported to the Department of Health of the Generalitat of Catalonia (6.3 million inhabitants), Spain, excluding those of nosocomial origin, during the period 1990-2003 were studied. An epidemic outbreak was considered as the appearance of two or more epidemiologically-related cases of legionellosis. Descriptive variables were recorded for each outbreak and a comparative analysis made of outbreaks occurring between 1990 occurring between and 1996 occurring between (period I) and 1997 occurring between and 2003 . v 2 test was used to compare qualitative variables. Results: Ninety outbreaks were studied. The origin was determined solely by epidemiological data in 47 (52.2%), and by epidemiological data and molecular biology in 6 (6.7%). The origin could not be determined in the remaining outbreaks. Cooling towers were involved in 34.4% of the outbreaks. The annual evolution of the number of outbreaks has been progressively greater from 1990 with a clear increase from 1999 onwards. 71.1% of the outbreaks occurred in the period June-October. The total number of people affected in all 90 outbreaks was 558 and the median number affected per outbreak was 3 (range 2-113). The average age of those affected was 57.3 years (SD 10.8) . Hospitalization was required in 463 (82.9%) cases and 27 people died (global case-fatality rate 4.8%). The outbreaks during period I were smaller, the average age of patients was higher and the outbreak was detected later. The case-fatality rate was significantly higher in period I than in period II (12.2% versus 4.1%). In period I, the diagnostic methods used were BCYE and serology, whereas 97.1% of the outbreaks in period II were diagnosed by the urinary antigen test. Conclusion: In Catalonia, the number and size of LD outbreaks has risen clearly from the 1990s to the present. However, the beginning of the outbreaks was detected sooner and the case fatality rate has fallen significantly. The use of more sensitive diagnostic tests for Legionella and the rapid establishment of appropriate treatment may explain these results.",

            "text": "High prevalence of rhinovirus in lower respiratory tract specimens Objectives: The aim of this study was to improve the etiological diagnostic accuracy in patients with severe community-acquired pneumonia (sCAP) using an invasive procedure (IP). Methods: Over a 2-year period, 46 patients showing clinical and radiological characteristics of severe CAP and failing to respond to antimicrobial therapy were studied. 33 males and 13 females with a mean age of 60 years and ranging between the ages of 21 and 84 years were admitted either to the Pneumology Department or Intensive Care Unit (ICU). Severe pneumonia was defined by clinical criteria determined according to FINE score class IV or V. In conjunction to initial routine serological and microbiological diagnostic tests on blood, urine and sputum (if available), Bronchoalveolar Lavage (BAL) or Transthoracic Fine Needle Agoaspiration (TTFNA) was performed to identify the responsible infecting pathogen. Granulocytes (50% and a bacterial culture cut-off (10.000 CFU/ml defined infectious pneumonia. Results: Of the 46 patients enrolled, 10 presented a noninfectious lung disease that mimicked CAP. The final differential diagnoses were: 3 lung carcinoma, 1 ARDS, 2 BOOP, 1 T cell lung lymphoma, 1 drug parenchymal damage, 1 Wegener's Granulomatosis, and 1 unknown diagnosis but granulocytes (50% in BAL ruled out infectious pneumonia. Of the remaining 36 patients, 1 had a malignancy overlapping infectious pneumonia. By means of invasive procedure, an etiological diagnosis was achieved in 13 cases. M. tuberculosis was isolated in 4 of these cases. Therapeutic treatment was modified in 9 cases. Conclusions: Invasive procedure significantly improved the diagnostic accuracy in patients with sCAP and established the differential diagnosis in noninfectious and unusual infectious pneumonia that mimicked sCAP. Though not routinely used, IP had a substantial impact on the etiological diagnosis and decisively influenced change in therapeutic strategy in a selected number of cases. The implementation of IP proved to be a safe and effective means of reducing therapeutic failure in sCAP. Identification of unsuspected or resistant pathogens would otherwise have been unattainable and patient survival reduced.",

Pertussis is a notifiable disease and in 2002 a total of 3182 cases were reported. The diagnosis of this disease can be made by the isolation of B. pertussis or detection by PCR from respiratory secretions, as well as using serological methods (ELISA) at our laboratory. This paper reports the results from the different methods used, and describes a case where pertussis was found unexpectedly. Methods: All cases of pertussis were included from January 1st to October 31st 2004, and the positive rates were calculated according to the different laboratory methods. For the case of pertussis detected in broncho-alveolar lavage fluid, medical records were obtained. Results: A total number of 458 patients were diagnosed with pertussis during the observation period. In some patients, the organism could be found in two different specimens. 391 (15%) out of 2614 samples were found positive by serological methods. 74 (8%) out of 954 samples were found to be PCR positive. In 6 (5%) of the 110 cultured samples, the B. pertussis could be isolated from nasopharyngeal secretions. In one case the bacteria was isolated from a blood culture. In addition, one case was detected in broncho-alveolar lavage fluid, this patient suffered from chronic lymphatic leukaemia. He was admitted to hospital because of a fever, dyspnoea and a dry cough, and was diagnosed with interstitial pneumonia. 16S rDNA sequencing performed directly on the culture negative broncho-alveolar A prospective study was performed that comprised 407 hospitalized adult patients with community acquired pneumonia (CAP). Chlamydia pneumoniae (CP) as a cause of CAP was detected in 13.27% (n = 54) and it was a single cause in 10.32% (n = 42). The diagnosis was made serologically with EIA and MIF assays. Mean age of the patients with CP pneumonia (n = 42) was x = 47, 57 years (s = 18.26). There were 66.7% (n = 28) males. Clinical, laboratory and radiographic findings were analysed and compared with a control group of patients with bacterial etiology of the CAP (n = 80). The analysis of radiographic changes prior to admission in the hospital of those patients with Chlamydia pneumoniae pneumonia revealed that only half of them had interstitial infiltration (v 2 \u2021 100, p \u00a3 0.001) and the remaining had alveolar or mixed infiltration. Beside of domination of diffuse extension of changes in 71.4%, in 16.7% of the patients with CP pneumonia there was lobar and in 11.9% segmental extension of the infiltration in the lungs (v 2 = 10.54, p = 0.0144). Pleural effusion was found in 7.1% (v 2 = 1.177, p = 0.758) of the patients with CP pneumonia and hilar adenopathy in 23.8% (v 2 = 1.959, p = 0.16). Partial regression of the changes was found in 4.8% and contra lateral progression in 2.4% (v 2 = 2.85, p = 0.24). Infiltrations were more frequently in lower lobes either left or right (v 2 = 3.5857, p = 0.3098). In order to increase the percentage of patients with CP pneumonia who would be initially treated with adequate antimicrobial therapy, multifactor regression and discrimination factors analyses were done based on the results obtained. This was followed by postulating diagnostic algorithm for making more exact diagnosis -Chlamydia pneumoniae pneumonia.",

To provide epidemiological data for the seasonal distribution and the annual incidence of Mycoplasma pneumoniae infections. Materials and methods: A total of 1074 patients from 2 to 14 years old with symptoms and signs compatible with CAP were enrolled during a 4-year period (2001) (2002) (2003) (2004) . Thorax radiography and paired sera were obtained from each patient and the course of illness was monitored uniformly. Specific IgG and IgM antibodies were measured by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (Remel, USA) and Immunocard based IgM EIA (Meridian France). The children were divided in three age groups: Group A: 2-6 years old Group B: 7-12 years and Group C: more than 12 years. The serum CRP concentration was also determined by nephelometry. of the sample were 80-year-old or older, 27% had an age between 60 and 79, 16% between 40 and 59, and 13% between 18 and 39. Comorbidities were very common since up to 83% reported at least one of them.

Antibiotics were already being taken before admission in 26.2% (penicillins 8.6%; macrolides 6.2%; quinolones 5.6%; cephalosporins 3.9%). The data of proper influenza and/or pneumococcal vaccination was of no use in the medical management of these patients. The antecedent of vaccination was acknowledged in 0.6% and 0.8% of the subjects studied. Only 0.2% of the subjects were participating in a clinical trial of CAP. Mean, median and modal length of hospital stay for the CAP episode was 11.3, 9 and 8 days, respectively. Five per cent of the subject entered the ICU with a corresponding mean, median and modal stay of 9.3, 5 and 1 day, respectively. Fine variables were properly recorded in only 1722 subjects (53.3%), whose distribution is broken down in the Table. Conclusions: The occupation rate of hospital admitted adult CAP was 37.9/100 beds/year. There was a male predominance and a clear trend age disbalance as 71% of the patients were at least 60 years old. 26.2% of the subjects were already taking antibiotics when admitted. 47.2% of the subjects were admitted to hospital with very low Fine scores (I-III), but hypoxemia occurred in 34.1% of them.",

Garau on behalf of the NACER Group Objectives: To assess the frequency of classical signs and symptoms of acute pneumonia in a large series of adult patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) that required hospital admission. Methods: Retrospective review of the hospital charts of patients admitted to the hospital with the diagnosis of CAP over a 1-year period in 10 geographically scattered hospitals in Spain. All patients admitted from 1 November 2001 to 31 October 2002 were included. Data were available from 3233 patients. Results: Fever defined as an axillary temperature >38\u00b0C was present in only 38.7% of subjects, and its presence decreased in patients with high risk Fine score (groups IV-V) compared with low risk Fine score (groups I-III) (35.0% vs. 45.4%; p ( 0.0001). Leukocytosis was present in 68.9% and the sputa were purulent in 53.8%. An abrupt onset was recorded in 34.7%. Hypoxemia occurred in 45.2%, hypotension in 9.3% and mechanic ventilation was needed in 3.1% of the subjects. Based on the above results, the estimated probability of the classic association of fever, leukocytosis, purulent sputum and abrupt onset, typical of classic pneumococcal pneumonia would only have taken place in 5% of the adults patients with CAP admitted to the hospital. As for chest X-ray films, 85% of the cases were unilateral, and 77.6% were monolobar. A predominant alveolar pattern occurred in 80.3%, an interstitial in 7.2%, pleural effusion in 11.3% and only 1.1% presented cavitation. Conclusions: (1) In real practice classic clinical presentation of bacterial pneumonia does not fit well with that presented in patients with CAP admitted to hospital. Isolated signs and symptoms have not a good sensibility as predictors of admission to hospital in CAP. (2) Only 5% of subject can be expected to present a classic pneumococcal presentation. (3) An alveolar chest X-ray pattern was predominant in our experience. Pleural effusion was not uncommon at all since it occurred in one tenth of subjects. (4) The proportion of patients with a body temperature >38\u00b0C decreases as Fine store increases. Objectives: Acute lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) in elderly are of great concern to general practitioners since their course is often more complicated. Classification into low-or high risk may improve medical care, hence reducing unnecessary treatment and target monitoring and therapy more efficiently. Our objective was to develop a prediction rule for 30-day hospitalization or death in elderly primary care patients with a LRTI. Methods: To develop a prediction rule we retrospectively analysed easily obtainable medical data from 3166 episodes of physician-attended LRTI including pneumonia, acute bronchitis and exacerbations of COPD in patients \u202165 years of age. Characteristics were identified that were predictive for 30-day hospitalisation or mortality. We subsequently developed a prediction rule with the use of logistic regression. Results: Hospitalization or death in 30 days, occurred in 274 (8.7%) of all episodes (2.4% all cause mortality). Increasing age, male gender, hospitalization in 12 month prior to diagnosis, heart failure, diabetes, use of oral glucocorticoids, use of antibiotics in the prior month and a diagnosis of pneumonia or an exacerbation of COPD were predictors for hospitalization or death. Patients with \u00a33 points had a 97 % chance of an uncomplicated course. Patients with \u20218 points had a 30% chance of hospitalization or death. Conclusions: This prediction rule discerns elderly patients with high or low risk for hospitalization or death. Classification into risk groups can help the general practitioner to adjust his preventive and therapeutic decisions to the expected prognosis. This might lead to fewer complications and lower costs. Objectives: Mycoplasma pneumoniae (MP) is an etiological agent responsible for 10-30% of community-acquired pneumonia cases. Pneumonia due to MP is labeled under atypical pneumonia infections. MP may be detected in all parts of the respiratory system, and its effects are well recognized and documented. In respect to diagnosis and treatment, the most prominent structural feature of MP is the lack of a cell wall. It has been shown that surface-exposed polypeptides elicit immunogenic response, in particular those that are involved in the attachment organelle of MP. This attachment organelle is composed of a complex of polypeptides, in which P1 Cytadhesin Protein has a major role. Due to its high immunogenicity P1 is a paradigm for utilizing a definitive antigen in sero-diagnostical systems. On the way to produce either a recombinant-or a peptide-based antigen of a similar nature, a modified extraction procedure of membranous proteins has been employed. Methods: MP cells were exposed to the non-ionic detergent Triton X-114. The same detergent was applied then on the separated membranes, extracting insoluble proteins in a temperature-dependent way. The antigenic activity of the revealed extract was tested in ELISA with characterized sera, utilizing detection systems specific to IgG, IgM and IgA.",

The soluble phase of the extraction, as well as the currently used antigen in SeroMP test, has shown multiple bands. Comparison in ELISA between the three preparations revealed that the antigenic activity of the insoluble extract is comparable to that of the current assay. This result was repeated for IgG, IgM and IgA, meaning that the majority of the antigenic activity in the insoluble fraction may be attributed to the 65 kDa polypeptide. Conclusions: The current observation is supported by previous works that have indicated the same size of polypeptide as a detergent extractable and being associated with the attachment organelle. We show here the antigenic potential of the 65 kDa extracted in our modified procedure, which reveals a comparable activity as the current assay. This finding identifies the 65 kDa polypeptide as an appropriate candidate to be used in diagnostic tests. Nowadays legionellae are known as common water bacteria with ability to cause outbreaks and epidemics of both: Legionnaires' disease and Pontiac fever. In the time of intensive traveling of people the laboratories must be capable to type environmental and human isolates and to give clear answers about the source of infection. In Bulgaria there were no data concerning the typescope of the L. pneumophila strains circulating in the potable waters. We present here the results from a pilot study for the typing L. pneumophila (Lp) strains isolated from water samples from three geographically different Bulgarian regions. After isolation of the strains they were subjected to characterization by the use of serogroup specific techniques, monoclonal antibody and Amplified Fragment Length Polymorfism (AFLP) typing methods. Water samples collected from buildings located in one west and two east Bulgarian regions revealed presence of variety L. pneumophila isolates. A total of twenty six Lp strains were isolated. The predominant serogroup was Lp serogroup 1, but there were also 7 isolates belonging to Lp serogroup 6, Lp serogroup 8 and Lp serogroup 15. Co-contamination of water samples with different Lp serogroups was observed. The most frequent Lp serogroup 1 monoclonal subtypes were Knoxville and Allentown. The obtained AFLP profiles show good discriminatory power. Our results from this pilot study point that Lp serogroup 1 is not so rare finding in our potable waters as it was considered in the past based on a restricted study in one town Lp serogroup 15 was isolated for the first time in our country during this study. The necessity for use of a complex of methods for clear epidemiological typing was demonstrated. The results show that more extensive studies are needed to give clear picture of the environmental distribution of Lp types in Bulgarian waters and to compare Lp types from environmental sources with those from clinical cases of Legionnaires' disease. Methods: The records of hospitalized pneumonia patients were screened for MI and results of antibiotic treatment (AT). 222 records with MI were selected for years 2000-2002. There were evaluated presence of clinically significant pathogens, the time between MI and beginning of AT, accordance between pathogens sensitivity (SN) to antibiotics and real AT, results of AT. The MI were interpreted as utilized if SN was available before of within 3 days after the beginning of AT according SN. The MI were interpreted as non-utilised if pathogens were not identified, or SN was available 3 days after beginning of AT, or there were discrepancy between SN and real AT. Clinical effectiveness of AT was determined in the case of utilised and nonutilised MI. Also it was evaluated the number of MI needed to determine SN; the formula 'Number needed to screen' (NNS) was used to calculate the number of MI with SN needed to prevent one case of ineffective AT. The cost of total number of MI was compared with the buying costs of second-line antibiotics such as 3rd, 4th generation cephalosporins, vancomycin and carbapenems for course of treatment. The other costs associated with ineffective first AT course were not calculated. Results: In the case of pneumonia etiologically significant pathogens were identified in 44% of probes, it means that 2.27 MI were done to get one SN. In the case of utilised and nonutilised MI the effectiveness of AT was 95% and 47% respectively, based on these figures NNS calculation demonstrate that 2.09 MI with SN were needed to prevent one case of ineffective AT. So the total number of MI needed for prevention of one case of ineffective AT was 4.74 (2.2 multiply 2.09). The costs of 4.74 MI were significantly less than the buying costs of any secondline antibiotics. Conclusion: MI significantly increase the effectiveness of AT of pneumonia. In the hospital were investigation was performed the direct buying costs of second-line antibiotics were higher than cost of MI. To increase the effectiveness of MI it is necessary to reduce number of MI without pathogens, MI with wrong SN and MI which are not used by physicians for selection of AT. In the settings with other cost structure to evaluate economical effectiveness of MI it may require to calculate the full costs associated with ineffective AT.",

Naumov (Moscow, RUS) Aim: Elaboration, introduction and evaluation of the effectiveness of clinical recommendations for treating patients with nonhospital pneumonia on the pre-hospital stage. Methods: The research was carried out in 1081 patients with community acquired pneumonia (CAP). The patients were divided into 3 groups: I -431, patients diagnosed with CAP, in a number of cases, was not confirmed while in hospital; II -391,the tactics of treating CAP on the pre-hospital stage did not correspond to the clinical recommendations; III -259 patients with confirmed CAP, the diagnosis of which and the prehospital treatment corresponded to the clinical recommendations. The patients of all the groups were comparable. Results: On the pre-hospital stage the clinical picture was evaluated only in 4% of the patients, on average. The underestimation of the clinical picture caused hyper diagnostics of CAP on the pre-hospital stage, whereas in hospital, the absence of characteristic complaints and physical signs of CAP allowed to evaluate the situation adequately and to change the diagnosis. On the pre-hospital stage the patients of group II did not have the clinical criteria of CAP (70.3%)in the accompanying documents, their concomitant diseases were not revealed (81.4%), the anamnesis and data about the previous treatment were not collected, the adequate treatment of CAP was not carried out (antibacterial drugs were not administered in any of the cases). The risk of unfavorable termination was known to be not evaluated in 47% of the cases, and the hospitalization of more than one third of the patients was non-profile. Besides, the index of the pre-day lethality came to 12.1% and the general lethality came to 4.6%. in this group. In group III all the patients had the symptoms of CAP which allowed to evaluate the degree of the disease severity correctly, to administer the therapy of antibiotics -amoxicillin (Phlemoxin Solutab) in the case of non-severe pneumonia and ceftriaxon in case of severe pneumonia and to carry out correct sorting of the patients. The pre-day lethality came to 3.1% and the general lethality came to 2.3%. in this group. The time of group III patients' stay in hospital came to 17 \u00b1 3.4 days, and that of group II patients came to 21 \u00b1 4.7 days (p ( 0.05).

This study was carried out for investigating the microbial surface and core flora of the tonsils and adenoids. Methods: Core and surface cultures were taken from the tonsils and adenoids of the 40 patients at the time of the surgery for tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy. Patients' ages ranged from 3 to 13 years (mean age 6.6 years). Specimens were inoculated onto 5% sheep blood, chocolate, EMB agar and Haemophilus medium (BioMerieux/France). For anaerobic bacteria, core samples were inoculated onto anaerobic blood agar and incubated in Genbaganaer pockets (Biomerieux/France). The anaerobic plates examined at 48 and 96 hours. Aerobic organisms were identified by conventional methods and anaerobic organism were identified by VITEK ANI (Biomerieux/France) systems. Chocolate agar and Haemophilus medium (HAEM) were also compared for Haemophilus influenza identification. Results: One hundred and thirty three aerobic bacterial isolates were recovered from surface of the tonsils, 111 from core of the tonsils, 128 from surface of the adenoids and 74 from core of the adenoids. Eight anaerobic bacteria were identified from core of the tonsils and 14 from core of the adenoids. The most frequently isolated microorganisms were alpha-haemolytic streptococci, Neisseria spp, and H. influenza. Beta-lactamase producing bacteria (BLPB) were found in all patients. The most frequently BLPB were Staphylococcus aureus (100% of the isolates), H. influenza (58% of the isolates), and Neisseria spp (45.2% of the isolates). Potential pathogenic microorganisms (beta-haemolytic streptococci, S. aureus, H. influenza and S. pneumoniae) were isolated in 33 patients. Conclusion: This study demonstrates a polymicrobial aerobicanaerobic flora in both adenoids and tonsils. There was a close relationship between the bacteriology of the tonsil and adenoid core and surface flora. We could not find any statistical difference between the bacteriology and BLPB of the tonsil and adenoid core and surface flora. HAEM and chocolate agar were also found similar for H. influenza but for H. parainfluenza a statistical difference was found.",

The mean age was 26.4 years (range 9-78). Sixty-nine (54%) patients were male; the mean length of hospital stay was 3 days. Needle aspirates, swabs of pus, throat swabs and blood were submitted for microbial culture. Culture yield was greatest from needle aspirates, and was similar even with prior antibiotic exposure, although the relative frequency of pathogens was different in the group who had received prior antibiotics. Beta-haemolytic streptococci were the most common isolates, however a variety of pathogens were implicated. Throat swabs and blood cultures were typically unhelpful. The results of culture and sensitivity did not affect individual patient treatment, but reviewing the sensitivities demonstrated frequent resistance of isolates of Group A beta-haemolytic streptococci to macrolide antibiotics. Heterophil antibody testing was routine and revealed that Epstein-Barr Virus infectious mononucleosis had a prevalence of 1.8% in this population. Conclusion: We support the view that aspirates of pus from peritonsillar abscesses should be periodically cultured to guide empirical antibiotic management since performing cultures in every case may be unnecessary.

Azithromycin (500 mg QD for 3 days) is an effective treatment for documented GABHS pharyngitis in adults. A novel microsphere formulation of azithromycin now makes it possible to administer a full course of therapy as a single dose while maintaining tolerability and optimizing compliance. The objective of this study was to test the hypothesis that a single 2.0 g dose of azithromycin microspheres is bacteriologically noninferior to 3 days of azithromycin (500 mg QD for 3 days) when used to treat adults and adolescents with GABHS pharyngitis/tonsillitis. Methods: This was a Phase III multicentre, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy trial conducted in North America, Europe, and India. The primary endpoint was bacteriologic response at Test of Cure (TOC; Day 24-28) in the Bacteriologic Per Protocol (BPP) population. The secondary endpoints were clinical response at TOC and safety. Results: Five hundred ninety-eight subjects were enrolled in the study; of the 594 treated subjects 420 (70.7%) were included in the BPP population. Bacteriologic eradication was achieved in 86.3% (177/205) and 81.4% (175/215) subjects in the azithromycin microspheres and 3-day azithromycin groups, respectively at TOC (95% CI (2.1, 12.0). At Long-Term Follow Up (LFTU; Day 38-45), bacteriologic recurrence was observed in 5.5% (9/163) subjects in the azithromycin-microspheres group, compared with 7.7% (12/156) subjects in the 3-day azithromycin group. Clinical cure was observed in 99.0% (203/205) of subjects in the azithromycin microspheres group and 96.7% (208/215) in the 3-day azithromycin group. Both treatments were well tolerated and most adverse events were mild to moderate in intensity. The most frequent adverse event (AE) was diarrhoea/loose stools, which occurred in 11% of both treatment groups. No subjects in either group discontinued treatment due to treatment-related AEs. Conclusion: A single 2.0 g dose of azithromycin microspheres is as effective and well tolerated as 3 days of azithromycin (500 mg QD) for treating GABHS pharyngitis in adults and adolescents.",

Yet, evidence of the value of this information for the management is sparse. The aim of this study was to examine whether in patients with suspected rhinosinusitis illness duration and/or the effect of antibiotic treatment can be predicted on basis of clinical symptoms/signs or radiology. Methods: Participants were 300 patients with suspected rhinosinusitis participating in an RCT comparing amoxicillin with placebo. By means of Cox regression we assessed the association between the presence at baseline of rhinosinusitis symptoms/ signs or an abnormal radiograph and the subsequent illness course. By testing for interactions we investigated whether the presence at baseline of any of these symptoms/signs could predict a beneficial effect of antibiotic treatment. Results: 'Poor general condition' {Hazard ratio 0.77(0.60-0.99)} and 'reduced productivity' {(HR 0.68(0.53-0.88)} at baseline were independently associated with a prolonged course. None of the classical sinusitis-like symptoms, nor abnormalities on radiography had any prognostic value. Prognosis also remained unchanged whether or not the patient was treated with antibiotics, regardless of his baseline symptoms. Conclusions: In a representative group of patients with suspected acute rhinosinusitis in FP, neither the presence of sinusitis symptoms/signs nor an abnormal radiograph provided information with regard to the prognosis or effect of amoxicillin treatment. Patients who felt poorly at baseline, or didn't feel able to work, needed more time to recover, but this could not be influenced by amoxicillin.",

            "text": "Objectives: Chlamydia pneumoniae causes chronic infections that have been related to asthma bronchiale and atherosclerosis. These chronic infections cannot be eradicated by short-term antimicrobial treatment due to a non-replicating persistent state of C. pneumoniae that survives and continues to synthesize mRNA in the presence of antibiotics. It is unknown if antibiotics modify the gene expression profile of these persistent chlamydiae in a clinically relevant manner. Therefore, we analysed the differential expression of selected genes in the presence of moxifloxacin and clarithromycin, which both are active in acute chlamydial infection, using a model of chlamydial persistence in peripheral blood monocytes (PBMC). Methods: Persistent infection with C. pneumoniae was initiated in PBMC in established methodology. Infected cells were continuously exposed to moxifloxacin (3.1 lg/ml) or clarithromycin (2 lg/ml) or kept in antibiotic-free medium. Differential gene expression of selected C. pneumoniae target genes (type III secretion: LcrD, YscL, YscN; inclusion membrane: IncA, IncC; amino acid metabolism; TyrB, GlyA) was quantitatively analysed between 1 and 192 h after infection by RT-PCR using the LightCycler system. Results: In antibiotic-free medium gene expression levels varied individually over time for each gene analysed. However, all target genes showed a 5-to 9-fold upregulation of mRNA peaking at 120 h under exposure to moxifloxacin. This was less prominent under clarithromycin. Conclusion: Our initial expectation to further reduce transcription levels in persistent C. pneumoniae by adding antibiotics proved wrong. The surprisingly clear upregulation of gene expression under moxifloxacin rather indicated a general regulatory effect of the drug on the pathogen. This is the first demonstration that chlamydiae in the persistent state are not completely inert and show a reaction to antibiotics. It is under investigation whether protein synthesis is upregulated in parallel. The potential clinical relevance of this finding regarding host cell response and course of the infection remains to be analysed in in vivo models for which this study provides the basis.",

            "text": "The application of a validated risk score safely reduces the rate of hospital admission in patients with community-acquired pneumonia presenting to the emergency department Objectives: Patients receiving a diagnosis of community acquired pneumonia (CAP) in the hospital Emergency Department (ED) need to be carefully evaluated to be treated as in-or out-patients. The Pneumonia Score Index (PSI) is a validated score predicting the short term risk of death in patients with CAP and could therefore assist in deciding whether a single patient with CAP needs to be hospitalized or not. Methods: We implemented a computer-based critical decision pathway for the management of patients with CAP, based on the PSI score and a dedicated software (GesPOrEx \u00aa ). Briefly, all adults aged >18 years with provisional diagnosis of CAP were eligible for inclusion in the study. All patients received written information about their diagnosis of pneumonia and their treatment plan. CAP was defined as the presence of new pulmonary infiltrate on chest Rx and symptoms consistent with pneumonia, including cough, dyspnea, change in sputum, pleuritic chest pain. The PSI score was then calculated for all patients meeting eligibility criteria. Patients with scores of 90 points or lower were recommended for outpatients treatment, whereas those with higher scores were recommended for hospital admission. The PSI score was used only as a guide to the admission decision and did not superseded clinical judgment. The follow-up consisted of two visits, within 10 days and about 1 month after discharge from the hospital. Results: The protocol was applied to 117 consecutive patients with CAP presenting at our ED. Compared to the previous year, we detected a significant 37% reduction (p < 0.001, 95% CI 26-49%) in the rate of admissions to the hospital of patients with CAP. Moreover, the length of stay in the hospital showed a trend toward reduction (from 9 \u00b1 2 days before protocol implementation, to 7 \u00b1 5 days). In the 3 months follow up, we did not detect any re-hospitalization in patients treated as out-patients and the rate of cure was similar before and after the protocol implementation. Conclusion: We estimated that the application of this critical pathway generated a potential saving of about 110.00 Euros in one year. Interestingly, after the study end the trend towards a reduction in admission rate for CAP patients was maintained, thus suggesting that the use of the PSI score entered clinical practice with persistent beneficial effects on clinically safe and cost-effective management of CAP patients.",

Methods: Study took place in a medium sized general hospital. All the files related to patients admitted for the diagnosis of CAP and hospitalized were reviewed in a prospective way by a local committee of independent Experts during the first half-year 2003 (T1) and the first half-year 2004 (T2), and compared. Between the two periods, the prescribing physicians have been trained (educational sessions based on the guidelines for pneumonia care of the French Society of Infectious Diseases (SPILF)). Three major quality indicators were used: initial molecule selection, dosage and time to first dose. Cost of antibiotherapy was calculated. Results: 53 files were selected during T1 and 42 during T2. The 2 groups were well matched (age, sex, Fine's score). Inadequate initial molecule selection decreased from 43% to 29% (NS), inadequate dosage decreased from 4% to 0% (NS). Time to first dose was <4 hours in the 2 groups. Between T1 and T2, the prescription of amoxicillin increased by 15%, at the expense of fluoroquinolones ()13%) and of the 3rd-generation cephalosporins ()9%). Macrolides prescription remained stable. Antibiotherapy cost decreased by a 2.5 fold ratio (p < 0.05) Conclusions: Our work demonstrates that, even if the dosage errors are rare and the antibiotic therapy is always early, there was a mediocre adhesion to the recommendations as regards to the choice of the molecule, before the intervention. Even though results obtained with our targeted training are modest, they are encouraging as they increased the use of guidelines recommended antibiotherapy, and leaded to significant cost gain. The development of different educational strategies is essential for the application of good medical practices for a better patient's management from the moment they are admitted in the Emergency Department.",

Methods: Invasive isolates were acquired through a population based, nationwide surveillance using 2 detection systems. Colonizing, non-invasive isolates were isolated from nasopharyngeal aspirates of hospitalized children with acute respiratory diseases. Results: From 09/2001 to 08/2004 a total of 175 invasive isolates were collected, of which 160 (91.4%) could be evaluated. Most strains were non-capsulated (n = 99; 56.6%). The most frequent capsular type was type b (n = 39; 22.3%), followed by types f (n = 19; 10.9%), e (n = 3; 1.7%) and a (n = 1; 0.6%). Types c and d were not detected. There was no increase of 'non-b'-isolates over the observation period. More capsulated Hi (13%) were detected by PCR than by agglutination (n = 62 vs. n = 54). The most frequent biotype was type I (n = 65; 37.1%), followed by type II (n = 51; 29.1%) and type III (n = 26; 14.9%). Only a small proportion of isolates produced beta-lactamase (n = 6; 3.4%). In the same period 102 non-invasive, colonizing Hi were isolated. All strains but one (capsular type e) were non-capsulated. No Hi type b could be detected.

Conclusions: Haemophilus influenzae type b as colonizing or as invasive pathogen has almost disappeared in Germany. Replacement was not observed. Invasive or colonizing Hi-isolates rarely produced beta-lactamase (3.4 -3.9%).

Objectives: To describe failure of Clarithromycin in the treatment of pulmonary Nocardia Nova infection, despite in vitro susceptibility to macrolides. Patient and Methods: A 61-year-old male with diabetes mellitus, non Hodgkin's lymphoma after chemotherapy, chronic adrenal replacement therapy (due to lymphomatous infiltration of the adrenals), presented with persistent cough in the previous 3 month. Weakly acid fast bacilii were detected in sputum and treatment with ethambutol, rifampin and clarithromycin was given for presumed MOTT infection. Although the patient reports strict compliance with drug therapy for three weeks, neither symptomatic nor radiographic improvement was noted. Nocardia spp. was isolated from sputum culture. DNA was extracted from bacterial colonies. A 439-bp fragment encompassing the hsp-65 gene was PCR-amplified and subsequently digested with BstEII and HaeIII endonucleases. Bacterial DNA was also PCR-amplified using a primer pair specific for conserved regions of 16S rRNA. The nucleotide sequence of the resulting amplicons was established and analysed using the BLAST software. Results: PCR-RFLP analysis revealed a restriction pattern compatible with that of N. Nova. This identification was ultimately confirmed as N. Nova, (99% homology) based on BLAST analysis of the bacteria 16S rRNA sequence. The isolate was sensitive to erythromycin. The patient received trimethoprim/ sulfamethoxazole with gradual clinical and radiologic improvement. After three month of follow-up he remains well. Conclusions: Nocardia Nova may account for 20% of Nocardia isolates identified as N. asteroides. N. Nova strains were previously noted for their susceptibility to ampicillin, cephalosporins and erythromycin. A macrolide was suggested as an alternative to sulfonamide in nonresponders or those with allergy to sulfa. The apparent disparity between in vitro susceptibility to macrolides and clinical failure warrants cautious use of these antibiotics in N. nova infections. Sequence based identification allows for accurate separation of N. nova from other related species. Background: Although antimicrobial resistance (R) rates among S. pneumoniae (SPN) and H. influenzae (HI) have increased significantly in most countries in the last years, most studies from Brazil report relatively low R rates among these pathogens. We analysed the susceptibility (S) patterns of SPN and HI from Brazil (6 years) for significant trends. Methods: 729 SPN and 566 HI collected from 1998-2003, mainly from respiratory tract and bloodstream infections, were susceptibility (S) tested by NCCLS broth microdilution methods against >30 drugs and the results analysed by year.

R to T/S also escalated from 50 to 61%, but S to ERY, CLI and TET significantly decreased among SPN strains. R to the antimicrobials tested remained very stable among HI with only some year-to-year variations. R to the newer fluoroquinolones was not detected and CHL showed an excellent spectrum (>95% S) against both pathogens. Objectives: To determine the potency of gemifloxacin (GEMI) tested against S. pneumoniae (SPN) for the years 1999-2004. The evaluation of GEMI compared to other currently marketed fluoroquinolones (FQ) will also be made including mechanisms of resistance (R). Methods: During a six year period (1999) (2000) (2001) (2002) (2003) (2004) , a total of 5892 SPN isolates were collected from medical centres on three continents and tested for antimicrobial susceptibility (S) using reference NCCLS broth microdilution methods and interpretive criteria (M100-S15, 2005). The antimicrobial agents tested included five FQs: GEMI, ciprofloxacin (CIPRO), levofloxacin (LEVO), gatifloxacin (GATI) and moxifloxacin (MOXI). Analysis of the quinolone resistance determining region (QRDR) was performed for 35 FQ-R strains (LEVO MIC at >4 mg/L). Results: The activity of GEMI against SPN over a six year period is shown in the table: During the six years, the rank order of potency (MIC90, mg/L) for the FQs was GEMI (0.03) > MOXI (0.12-0.25) > GATI (0.5) > LEVO (1-2) > CIPRO (2). All FQ median and modal potencies remained stable over the monitored interval. SPN isolates with CIPRO MIC values \u20214 mg/L ranged from 1.6 to 2.1% with no detectable trend towards increasing R across all regions. The most common QRDR mutations among strains with CIPRO and LEVO MIC values \u20214 mg/L were: gyrA (S83F or T), parC (S79F or T and D83N) and parE (I460V). Against these isolates, GEMI maintained the most potent activity at MIC50/90 values of 0.5/1 mg/L and a MIC range of only 0.25-2 mg/L.",

The prevalence of penicillin intermediate/resistant S. pneumoniae, was high and more common compared with previous years.

Methods: All adult patients (n = 114) with invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) and x-ray verified pneumonia at Karolinska and Danderyd Hospitals, Stockholm, Sweden, 1999-2000, were included. 88 patients were treated in the dpt of Infectious Diseases (DID) and 26 patients in other dpts (ODs). Severity scores were calculated according to the original publications and the independent prognostic importance of different variables was analysed by multiple regression analyses. Results: PSI > III, CURB-65 > 1, and presence of 1 major or >1 minor risk factor in Ewig's score all had a high sensitivity, but somewhat less good specificity, for predicting fatal outcome (Table) . The area under the Receiver Operating Characteristics curves for predicting death were between 0.83 and 0.85 for all three tests. The death rate was 12% (14/114), but patients treated in DID had a significantly lower rates than those treated in ODs, 5% (4/88) vs. 35% (10/26) (p < 0.0001). Also within the same severity score strata mortality was lower among patients treated in DID than in ODs. The fatality for a PSI-score of IV-V was 9/20 in OD vs. 4/33 in DID (p = 0.01).

As expected, PJ-PCR was superior to PJ-IFT and should therefore be performed on a routine basis for diagnosing PJP. Non-invasive Ventilation demonstrated to be a worthwhile therapeutic Option for bridging severe hypoxemia in patients with PJP. Introduction: The Idiopathic Interstitial Pneumonia (IIP) is one of the most severe pulmonary diseases. Initial chronic inflammation leading to parenchymal fibrosis is the common characteristic of this process; and infectious agents are the possible cause for the initial inflammation. It has been proved that Pneumocystis jirovecii (Pj) mediate an inflammatory response, increasing the permeability of alveolo-capillary membrane and, causes diffuse alveolar damage. Therefore, pulmonary carriage of Pj could play a role in the pathogenesis of the disease. However, the molecular epidemiology of Pj in this kind of patients is still unknown.",

The colonisation is higher in CF patients under 18 years old. Besides, 35.7% patients receiving prophylaxis with cotrimoxazol and 17.2% with azithromycin were colonized for P. jirovecii but none of them developed Pneumocystis pneumonia (PcP) for a year follow-up. The analysis shows concordance in the colonization status between brother groups. Conclusions: They are a high prevalence of P. jirovecii carriers among CF patients in Spain. These data suggest that chemoprophylaxis with Cotrimoxazol and Azithromycin may prevent PcP but not avoid colonization.

Infection occurred 184 \u00b1 325 days (range, 35-1458 days) after BMT. 15 patients (38%) had refractory or advanced cancer, 7 (18%) had diabetes mellitus and 4 (10%) had COPD. Twenty-three patients (58%) had nosocomial infection. None had either prior S. maltophilia orointestinal, genitourinary tract colonization or concomitant S. maltophilia bacteraemia. Cough was common (n = 24; 60%), dyspnea and fever occurred in 22 (55%) and 16 (40%) patients, respectively. Thirty-three patients (83%) presented with pneumonia while receiving broad-spectrum systemic antibiotics for 7 \u00b1 31 days. Most S. maltophilia (n = 37; 93%) were susceptible to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and ticarcillinclavulanic acid (n = 26; 65%). Fifteen patients (38%) did not need hospitalization. In 25 hospitalized patients, 6 (15%) required CCU admission and 5 MV for 3 \u00b1 5 days. Eight (20%) deaths were attributed to S. maltophilia pneumonia; presence of young age (37 vs 59 years; P < 0.004), prolonged hospitalization (42 vs 14 days; P < 0.01), and high APACHE II score (13 vs 10; P = 0.05) were associated with increased mortality. By univariate analysis, presence of acute leukaemia, APACHE II score >16, MV, CCU stay and cGVHD were poor predictors of outcome, by stepwise logistic regression analysis, only the later 2 emerged as significant prognosticators of death. Conclusions: S. maltophilia pneumonia was a serious lung infection in these non-neutropenic, non-CCU patients with cancer.",

Only the first positive specimen-set from new patients, both carriage and infections, were included. In period A the specimens were grown on a selective mannitol agar containing 6% NaCl (2% NaCl after October 2002) and Oxacillin 4 mg/L, whereas in period B the specimens were grown in a selective broth containing phenol red mannitol with aztreonam 75 mg/L and ceftizoxime 5 mg/L. Isolates of MRSA were verified by PCR detection of nuc and mecA genes by PCR in both periods. Objectives: Challenged by an increasing demand for MRSA surveillance and declining resources, clinical laboratories require sensitive and specific screening media to ensure a rapid turn-around-time (TAT) to notification and a low falsepositivity rate if costs and MRSA are to be controlled. Conclusion: While the CFOX plates were more costly, they were significantly more sensitive (P < 0.0001) and specific (P < 0.0001) than MSOX resulting in less material and labour costs. The TAT to notification appears reduced due the ease of working directly from the CFOX plate. Results: Using a breakpoint of R < 19 mm (cefox 10); R < 24 mm (cefox 30) and R < 29 mm (cefox 60) two, three and two mecA positive isolates tested false susceptible, respectively. Five, four and six mecA negative isolates tested false resistant. Zone edges for the 10 mcg tablet were more distinct and easier to read. For S. aureus ATCC 29213 the following zone diameters were found 21-23 mm, 27-29 mm and 29-33 mm, respectively and for S. aureus ATCC 25923 22-23 mm; 27-29 mm, and 32-33 mm, respectively. Conclusions: All three cefoxitin Neo-Sensitabs performed with high accuracy using this challenge set and as good as the results obtained in a recent evaluation of a 10 mcg paperdisk.

            "text": "Introduction: Numerous primary media have been advocated for the enhanced detection of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Recently, a lipovitellin-salt-mannitol-agar (LSM) with an oxacillin disk has been described. On this medium, detection of MRSA isolates is enhanced due to production of a lecithinase, which results in enlarged colonies surrounded by a zone of opacification. Also, the use of a cefoxitin disk method has recently been described. It has been reported as being superior to the oxacillin disk method. Aim: To evaluate the performance of LSM with a 1 lg oxacillin disk and a 30 lg cefoxitin disk (LSMoc) as selective and differential primary medium for detection of MRSA from screening specimens. Materials and methods: Screening specimens (swabs of nose and perineum) were obtained from a patient population at the intensive care unit. The LSMoc medium was compared with an in house method using colistin-nalidixic acid agar (CNA) with 5% horse blood by performing parallel inoculation. S. aureus isolates were presumptively identified by colonial morphology and confirmed by coagulase tube test and Vitek 2 ID-GPC testcard. Methicillin resistance on the LSMoc medium was presumptively detected by reading the zones of inhibition around both disks and confirmed by disk diffusion and PBP2' latex agglutination assay. Objectives: Uro-Quick system has been employed to detect methicillin-resistance (met-R) in S. aureus and coagulase-negative Staphylococci (CoNS). In order to achieve full agreement between the antibiotic susceptibility results obtained by the reference method (NCCLS) and the Uro-Quick system, the optimal experimental conditions (inoculum size, time of incubation, antibiotic and NaCl concentration) were determined for S. aureus and CoNS respectively. Methods: 72 met-R Staphylococci including different species (42 S. aureus and 30 CoNS, in which 12 S. epidermidis) heterogeneous in their expression of resistance to b-lactam agents were screened with the Uro-Quick System. S. aureus ATCC 29213 (mecA negative) and S. aureus ATCC 43300 (mecA positive) were used for quality control. Oxacillin (in appropriate concentration following the NCCLS breakpoints) was added in a vial containing 2 ml of suspension of strain to tested (a drug-free vial was used as control). After an opportune time of incubation the instrument printed the results: no growth and a growth curve like the control are representative of a susceptible and resistant strain respectively. Results: The best results were obtained using Mueller-Hinton broth and a concentration of 106 cells/ml for S. aureus and 5x106 for CoNS. All the 42 S. aureus tested grown within 5 hours of incubation and the met-R phenotype was correctly detected within 6 hours in 100% of strains (66.7% and 93.3% in 4 and 5 hours respectively). The 97% of CoNS strains grown within 10 hours of incubation, an insufficient growth within this period of time was observed for 1 strain of S. haemolyticus only. Met-R was correctly detected within 10 hours in 100% of strain grown at this time (55%, 64% and 95% in 6, 7 and 8 hours respectively). Conclusion: On the basis of the present findings, the Uro-Quick system appears to be useful for the rapid detection of met-R Staphylococci. Excellent results were obtained on S. aureus, concerning CoNS our result suggest that there are differences in the growth rate among the various members of this group and in the incubation time necessary for the met-R detection (more isolates of the respective species must be analysed to reach generalized conclusion).",

MIC values using E-test (AB biodisk) were used as reference. NCCLS procedures and manufacturers' recommendations were used. There was no difference to detect methicillin resistance in DD, OAT,MA and E-tests among 151 S. aureus except false susceptibility in OAT in 2 strains (1.3%) and DD in one strain (0.7%). Randomly selected 50 methicillin resistant 43 methicillin sensitive strains were studied using VT and 13 (14%) strains showed false resistance. Among them 12 showed discordance in oxacillin screening wells and MIC detection wells and could not pass advanced expert system and only 1 (1.1% ) was real false positive. When same validation is applied to 141 coagulase negative Staphylococi (CNS) (116 S. epidermidis, 25 CNS) false negativity was more common in 16 ( 11.3%) OAT (not recommended by NCCLS) and one strain (0.7%) in DD. 5 strains (3.5%) were falsely resistant by MA. For VT validation among randomly selected 81CNS strains (58 S. epidermidis, 23 CNS) only one strain (0.7%) was falsely resistant. 10 (7.1%) strains showed discordance in oxacillin screening wells and MIC detection wells. When we ommitted oxacillin screening well (because of its high antibiotic content to detect resistant CNS) false positivity in 3 strains still remained. Antibiotic susceptibility tests were more compatible in S. aureus isolates. Results obtained from VT shows that this system can be adopted to our routine laboratory practice, but it should be used with complementary tests both for S. aureus and CNS in case of discordant interpretative results between two wells for oxacillin resistance.",

The methods were a) ORSAB (Oxoid) b) real-time PCR detecting the mecA gene and a S. aureus-specific marker after an incubation in a selective broth and c) the conventional culture consisting of a blood agar plate and tryptic soy broth containing 10% NaCl. Objectives: Although Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) is relatively easy to cultivate, culture methods require 24 h incubation and conventional identification methods may yield false-positive or false-negative results. Standard susceptibility and penicillin-binding protein latex agglutination tests are timeconsuming because they require colonies to be isolated from 24 h culture or more. The correct identification of S. aureus and the detection of the mecA gene based on molecular methods is considered as a gold standard in the determination of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA). Many PCR for simultaneous detection of S. aureus specific gene target and mecA gene were developed, but cannot be applied for the direct detection of MRSA from nonsterile specimens such as nasal samples without an isolation step. A more comprehensive real time PCR assay that targets both an S. aureus-specific gene and the mecA gene within a single PCR tube reaction using only one couple of primer and two adjacent fluorescent probes was established and evaluated. Objective: Frequent outbreaks of Staphylococcus aureus infections worldwide emphasizes urgent need for rapid and reliable detection methods for S. aureus, especially in hospital settings and community. The ultimate aim of the study is to identify potential diagnostic marker and to develop DNA based assays that can be used in any microbiological laboratories for the rapid and reliable detection of S. aureus from pure culture and also directly from clinical samples. Methods: To select a genetic target for diagnostic purpose, S. aureus isolates obtained different hospitals in Malaysia were fingerprinted using rep (repetitive element sequence) primers. From rep fingerprint, a marker band present in all isolates was cloned and sequenced. A primer pair to amplify a 197 bp fragment and an oligonucleotide probe was designed from the most conserved region. Primers and probe were tested against 89 local S. aureus isolates and 1 ATCC to validate the ubiquity. The specificity of molecular assays were verified by using genomic DNA from a battery of gram-positive and gram negative bacterial species. The ability of assays to detect S. aureus directly from clinical samples was also tested. PCR and membrane assays were compared for ubiquity, specificity, and rapidity. Results: The rep fragment sequenced with universal M13 primers determined the size of marker as 489 bp, showed high similarity (>95%) to GAP (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate Dehydrogenase) Operon in S. aureus genome. The molecular assays developed with innovated primers and probe was very successful, as none of other non-S. aureus species showed positive signal confirming the ubiquity and specificity. PCR assay was more efficient in detection of S. aureus direct from clinical samples, membrane assay required purified DNA. In terms of rapidity, both assays produced results in 2-3 hrs.",

However, under xylose induction no significant increase of fluorescence intensity compared to the un-induced control was detected. This finding may be attributed to inefficient translation initiation at the natural Shine-Delgarno (SD) sequence. Indeed, by coupling different SD-sequences from well-characterized S. epidermidis genes in front of the gfp start codon the crucial impact of this element for gfp translation initiation was demonstrated: whereas a strong fluorescence signal was obtained in presence of the hld SD sequence, almost no signal was detected with the sarA SD sequence. The influence of different SD sequences on transcription and translation of gfpmut3.1 was also analysed in real-time transcription and semi-quantitative western blotting experiments. In all constructs investigated an almost identical gfp transcription level was found regardless of the SD sequence present. In contrast, western blot analysis using an anti-GFP antibody revealed huge differences in GFP amounts that corresponded to the respective quantitative fluorescence signal. The calculated half-life in S. epidermidis 1457 is 6.9 h. Importantly, expression of gfpmut3.1 did not interfere with the biofilm-positive phenotype of this strain. Conclusions: In conclusion, using an appropriate SD sequence for optimal translation initiation gfpmut3.1 offers an attractive system for monitoring gene expression in S. epidermidis. Bordetella pertussis is a fastidious aerobic, Gram-negative coccobacillus that causes the classical disease of whooping cough. The clinical manifestations of pertussis are due to the toxins that are produced by the organism locally and not by bacterial invasion. Isolation from blood cultures is extremely rare and to our knowledge this is the third reported case of Bordetella pertussis bacteraemia (1,2). All cases have been reported in immunocompromised patients. The patient was a 63 year old man with a 2 year history of multiple myeloma, initially treated with autologous bone marrow transplantation and currently treated with chemotherapy due to disease progression. One weak after treatment with vincristine, adriamycin and dexamethasone (VAD) he developed a productive cough and fever and was admitted to medical department. On admission C-reactive protein was 131 mg/l, WBC count and chest x-ray were normal and blood cultures were initially negative. He was treated for 5 days with intravenous cefotaxime for suspected bronchopneumonia and discharged in good condition.The patient was readmitted 8 days later with dry cough, hoarseness and fever. C-reactive protein was 270 mg/l and WBC count was 12.7*10 9/l. Chest X-ray was normal and blood cultures were negative. Again bronchopneumonia was suspected, and he was given intravenous penicillin for 7 days. Eventually, blood culture from the first admission revealed growth of an atypical Gram-negative rod from an aerobic bottle. The bacterium was identified as Bordetella pertussis by sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene. The patient was discarged in good condition and treated for 10 days with oral clarithromycin. Norway has experienced an outbreak of whooping cough since 1997 with more than 3000 reported cases annually. Systemic infections may occur in the immunocompromised host. Growth in blood culture may be slow, and prolonged incubation is recommended. Results: 311 patients with bacterial infections were identified. Median age was 65 y (range 20-80 y). Acute leukemias were most common -41%, followed by lymphomas -32%, chronic leukaemia -18%, and myelomas -5%. Only 44% were neutropenic, and 45% were on antibacterial prophylaxis. Sites of infection included respiratory tract -38%, BSI (including catheter-related) -38%, urinary tract -10%, skin and skin structure -8%, and gastrointestinal tract -5%. 221 episodes (71%) were monomicrobial and 90 (29%) were polymicrobial. Gram-positive bacteria accounted for 67% of monomicrobial BSI but only 45% of infections overall (i.e. when polymicrobial infections were also included in the spectrum). Gram-negative bacteria accounted for 33% of monomicrobial BSI, but only 26% of infections overall. More than 85% of polymicrobial infections had a gram-negative component, with P. aeruginosa being the single most common species isolated. The most common gram-positives were coagulase-negative staphylococci, S. aureus, viridans group streptococci, and Enterococcus spp. The most common gram-negatives were E. coli, P. aeruginosa, S. maltophilia, and Klebsiella spp. Background: We have previously demonstrated that procalcitonin (PCT) values higher than 3 ng/mL were associated with fungal invasive infections (IFI) in patients with persistent fever after five days of empirical antibiotherapy during neutropenic phase after Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (HSCT). Objective: To analyse if PCT is an independent and early diagnostic marker of IFI in high risk adult patients undergoing allogeneic HSCT. Patients and methods: PCT levels were determined in 129 febrile episodes developed by 65 consecutive patients receiving an allogeneic HSCT. There were 72 episodes during neutropenic period and 57 within the second and third phase of immune recovery after HSCT. All febrile episodes were classified according to the final diagnosis in: fever of unknown origin, microbiological or clinical documented infection and noninfectious febrile episodes. The microbiological or clinical documented infection were classified as possible, probable or proven IFI according to the EORTC/MSG criteria. The values of PCT were not included in the classification criteria.",

Methods: Peritoneal fluid specimens were examined for cells count and were cultured in Bactec Plus culture vials (Bactec plus, Becton Dickinson). After centrifugation the specimen was also cultured on appropriate media for aerobic and anaerobic microorganisms and smears were performed by Gram stain. The identification of bacterium was carried out by standard methods and API-32E, API 32GN (bioMerieux). The susceptibility testing was performed by disk diffusion method. Case report: A male patient aged 87 years, at final stage of renal failure under CAPD for 15 months and deficient renal function, was admitted to hospital because of the appearance of a cloudy peritoneal dialysate effluent and nausea. The patient had a history of three episodes of peritonitis caused by Gram negative bacteria (Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Flavomonas oryzihabitans, Acinetobacter johnsonii). The patient was successfully treated with IP tobramycin and recovered completely. On day of admission the peritoneal analysis showed 3100 WBC/\u00ecl (96% neutrophills). The patient was treated empirically with IP tobramycin. Forty eight hours after the incubation of peritoneal fluid gram negative bacterium was isolated. Tests for oxidase and catalase were positive. The hydrolysis test of esculine was positive. The bacterium was identified as Agrobacterium radiobacter. The bacterium was susceptible to cefuroxime, ceftriaxone, ciprofloxacin, imipenem, tetracycline and gentamicin and resistant to ampicillin, trimethoprime-sulfamethoxazole, cephalothin and tobramycin. The patient was treated with cefuroxime 750mgx3 IP for three weeks and he recovered completely. Conclusion: Agrobacterium radiobacter is a microorganism found in the environment and more particularly in several kinds of soils and is considered a plant pathogen. In rare cases of immunocompromised patients and especially for patients with transcutaneous catheters or implanted biomedical protheses, Agrobacterium radiobacter has been regarded as the cause of bacteramia and peritonitis.",

It is a commensal of a wide variety of vertebrate and invertebrate species but its major reservoir is domestic swine. The greatest commercial impact of infection is due to swine erysipelas. Serious infection in humans in extremely rare and associated with cutaneous infection in those who have had occupational exposure. Clinical manifestations include brain abscesses, osteomyelitis and chronic arthritis. Systemic infection can often be complicated by infective endocarditis, in which the mortality rate appears to be higher than for other organisms. We report a rare case of E. rhusiopathiae joint infection. Case Report: A 74 year old male patient on long term treatment for rheumatoid arthritis presented to clinic with an isolated knee sepsis, associated with a raised CRP and WCC. The knee was aspirated and E. rhusiopathiae isolated from culture broth after failing to grow on initial culture media. There were no other systemic manifestations. No direct occupational exposure was reported. A repeat knee aspirate failed to grow E. rhusiopathiae, but a third aspirate taken at arthroscopy once more isolated the organism. It was assumed that a soft tissue infection with E. rhusiopathiae had led to a bacteraemia which seeded into the rheumatoid knee joint. He underwent prolonged treatment, with a six week course of Clindamycin. Unfortunately, a low grade chronic infection persisted leading to complete disorganisation of the joint. A joint replacement is being considered.",

Results: A high degree of correspondence between biochemical characteristics and antibiotic susceptibility patterns was noted. All strains were identified as N. asteroides, by both biochemical and susceptibility pattern criteria. Patients were treated either with cotrimoxazole, high doses of imipenem or minocyclin. Three patients died, two suffering from lung cancer and one of ITP. Objectives: Fournier's gangrene is a serious skin and soft tissue infectious-necrotising process in the peri-neogenital area affect-ing adults, usually in their sixties or seventies. Isolated flora from cultures of the necrotic lesion is commonly multi-microbial. Although an idiopathic condition is considered in the past, today a genitourinary, anorectal or dermal triggering factor can be identified in most patients. There are a series of systemic host debilitating disorders such as diabetes mellitus, chronic alcohol abuse, and malignant neoplasia that are associated with this condition and may be considered risk factor to suffer this disease. In this study, 11 patients with FG, eight of whom had uncontrolled DM were investigated for risk factors, clinical signs, laboratory findings and prognosis. Methods: In this study, 11 FG patients who were hospitalized in Gulhane Military Medical Academy Haydarpasa Training Hospital Department of General Surgery Service were presented between 1998 to 2004. Their age, clinical presentation, predisposing factors, microbiology testing, management and prognosis were studied. Broad -spectrum parenteral antibiotics, early and aggressive surgical debridement of the necrotic areas and hiperbaric oxygene therapy were applied to all cases. Results: The mean age was 39.2 (21-79) of 11 FG cases. The average time from begin the symptoms to apply to hospital was 7.2 (3-17) days. The most prominent associated disease was diabetes, affecting 72.7 per cent of the patients, other potential contributing factors included trauma and surgical operations in three cases. The fasting blood glucose levels, HbA1C levels of the diabetic patients were 182-522 mg/dl and 8.1-10.5, respectively. Bacterial culture results revealed a single organism in 28.6%, and more than one organism in 71.4% of the cases. The most frequently isolated bacteriae were Escherichia col, Streptococcus pyogenes and Klebsiella pneumoniae from quantitative tissue cultures. The overall mortality rate was 45 percent. However, the mortality rate among diabetics was 62.5 per cent (P = 0.001). Conclusion: Fournier's gangrene is a very serious life-threatening disorder in especially diabetic patients despite of early aggressive debridement with the use of appropriate antimicrobial therapy.",

O antigens associated to UTI (O1, O2, O4, O6, O7, O18 and O83) were determined using agglutination microtechnique. Compromise status, obtained from medical records, included immnunocompromise and/or local predisposing factors to urinary tract infection. Results: 58% patients with pyelonephritis and 68% with urosepsis were compromised. Pyelonephritic strains from healthy patients belonged to: group B2 76% and group D 24%, and from compromised patients: groups A and B1 10%, group B2 59% and group D 21%.

The identification of microorganisms was performed using standard methods and the API systems (BioMerieux). Results: A total of 102 out of the 468 dialysates were positive (21.8%). Two of the positive samples were polymicrobial. Grampositive organisms accounted for 68.3% of the infections of which coagulase negative staphylococci (CNS) were the commonest (35.6%). Gram-negative bacteria were found in 21.1% of the positive samples, anaerobic bacteria in 1.9%, and fungi in 8.7%. Conclusion: CAPD-associated peritonitis was most commonly caused by coagulase negative staphylococci. Prompt identification of the causative agents is essential for the appropriate management of microbial peritonitis in patients on CAPD. Objectives: To report an unusual case of peritonitis caused by N. sicca in a continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) patient. Methods: Peritoneal effluent specimens were examined for WBC count and detection of microorganisms by Gram stained direct smears. They were cultured on appropriate media after centrifugation and were also inoculated in Bactec culture vials (Becton Dickinson). The identification of the microorganism was performed by standard methods, biochemical characteristics, colonies morphology and API NH system (bioMerieux). Susceptibility testing was carried out by disc diffusion method according to the NCCLS performance standard. Case report: A female 57-year-old CAPD patient end stage renal failure, was admitted to the hospital because of peritoneal effluent turbidity. She started CAPD eleven months ago. She was suffering from systemic lupus erythematosus for 17 years and was on corticosteroids for 15 years. That was the 1st episode of peritonitis for her. On admission WBCs count of peritoneal fluid was 2.600/ ll (95% neutrophils) and was decreased to 1.000/ ll and 200/ ll at second and third day respectively. On admission was administered cefazolin 1.5 gr I.P. and afterward 300 mg \u00b7 6 I.P. for the next 3 days. Gram (-) diplococci (intracellular or not) were seen on direct smears by gram stain. From two peritoneal effluent cultures Gram(-) diplococcus, oxidase positive and strict aerobic was isolated. The colonies were white, opaque, wrinkled, adhesive, peaked. The nitrate reduction was negative. With API NH (biotype:7101, %id:99,8 :1,00 -very good identification) the strain was identified as Neisseria spp group, which included the species N. sicca, N. mucosa I. subflava. The strain was differentiated from I. subflava on the base of colony morphology and from N. mucosa of nitrate reduction. The strain was beta-lactamase negative and resistant to erythromycin, trimethoprime/sulphamethoxazole, clindamycin and susceptible to penicillin, cephalosporines, aminoglycosides, ampicillin, ciprofloxacin and tetracycline. The patient was treated with cefazolin 300 mg \u00b7 4 I.P per day for the 18 next days and recovered completely. Conclusions: 'Nonpathogenic' Neisseria spp can cause severe disease in immunocompromised patients.

Methods: A total of 38 strains of enterococci were isolated in fecal cultures from 234 oncologic patients undergoing peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (PBSCT) or bone marrow transplantation (BMT) during one year (2003). The fecal samples were inoculated into bile esculin agar plates with and without 6 mgr/lt vancomycin and into an enrichment bile-esculin broth supplemented with 4 mgr/lt vancomycin. The identification of the isolated bacteria was performed by standard methods and the Api-strep system. The susceptibility testing was carried out by disk diffusion method according to the NCCLS guideline and by E-test for vancomycin and teicoplanin. All patients were febrile, with diarrhoea and were treated with antimicrobial agents before stool cultures. Results: From 38 strains of isolated enterococci, 28 strains were identified as E. faecalis, 8 strains as E.faecium and two strains as Enterococcus sp. A total of 19 strains were found resistant to ampicillin (50%) 15 to high level gentamycin (39. 5%), 27 to ciprofloxacin (71%), 21 to tetracycline (55%) and 5 to quinopristin / dalfopristin (13%). All the isolated strains were sensitive to vancomycin, teicoplanin and linezolid. 7 of the 8 isolated strains of E.faecium were observed multidrug resistant and sensitive only to glycopeptides, linezolid and quinopristin / dalfopristin. Conclusions: The present study indicates that the prevalence of V.R.E. in fecal samples from oncologic patients appears to be very low. Ciprofloxacin, a frequently used antimicrobial agent in cancer patients, was the less active of the antibiotics tested. In general, the good activity of the glycopeptides and linezolid tested shows promise for the combination therapy required in enterococcal infection in immunocompromised patients. Objectives: Infections are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in patients undergoing high-dose therapy and subsequent autologous or allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT), despite antimicrobial prophylaxis, use of growth factors and newer antimicrobial drugs. Methods: We compared the incidence of early infectious complications between autologous SCT and allogeneic SCT recipients in a single centre over a 6-year period (between January 1997 and June 2004) in 164 consecutive adult patients. Infections occurring within the 30 days after transplant were defined as early infections. Forty-two patients were allografted and 157 autografted. Antimicrobial prophylaxis was mainly quinolones, fluconazole, acyclovir and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. Results: Within the first 30 days, 120 of 164 patients (73.2%) developed febrile neutropenia episodes. Infections were documented in 78 patients (47.6%). Patients undergoing allogeneic SCT tended to have more documented infections compared to recipients of autologous SCT (78.6% vs 36.9%, respectively; p < 0.001). The most frequent infection was bacteremia (41%), followed by urinary infection (19.2%), pneumonia (16.7%) and catheter-related infection (15.4%). Pathogens isolated in 66.7% of the febrile neutropenia episodes were mostly gram-positive organisms (50.6%), followed by gram-negative rods (46.9%) and Candida spp. (2.4%). Predominant pathogens were coagulasenegative staphylococcus (26.5%), E. coli (24.1%) and S. aureus (16.9%). Infections were responsible for 2.4% of deaths after transplantation within the 30 days in all patients. Early mortality associated with infection was 4.8% after allogeneic SCT and 1.6% after autologous SCT (p < 0.005). Conclusions: Febrile episodes are the most frequent complication of both autologous and allogeneic SCT and gram-positive isolates remain the main pathogen in these patients Methicillin resistance is increasing and glycopeptides remain the only choice for treating such infections. The high incidence of febrile episodes and bacteraemia may be due to the lack of efficacy of antimicrobial prophylaxis. Although the infection rate is high, measures taken to prevent and treat infections result in very low rates of mortality from infection in SCT patients. Studies reporting local microbiological findings are necessary because they support an antibiotic choice for prophylaxis or therapy more accurately than reports from other areas.",

Following the primary infection both viruses establish latency in renal tissue and in B lymphocytes, 60-90% adults are asymptomatic polyomavirus carriers. Polyomavirus-related disease is largely associated with immunological impairment. JCV is the causative agent of the progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy in AIDS patients as well as in other immune compromised hosts. In patients undergoing renal or bone marrow transplantation the reactivation of both polyomaviruses may result in hemorrhagic cystitis (HC). Late-onset viral HC mainly related to BKV reactivation is a significant cause of post-transplant morbidity.The aim of the study was to evaluate the frequency and clinical implication of human polyomaviruses infections in children who underwent hematopoietic progenitor cell transplantation (HPCT). Methods: Polyomavirus DNA was detected in plasma and urine with PCR-based assays. Viral DNA was extracted from plasma or urine samples by digestion with proteinase K and purification on Qiagen columns according to manufacturer's protocol. The primers pair amplified a 176-bp sequence from BKV genome and a 173-bp sequence from JCV genome. Digestion of the PCR products with the BamH1 prior to electrophoresis was used to discriminate between BKV and JCV sequences. Results: A regular screening for polyomavirus infections was performed in 103 children who underwent HPCT. BKV was detected in urine of 39 children (37.9%) and in serum of 8 patients (7.8%). JCV was detected in urine of only 4 patients (3.9%) and in plasma of 1 patient. The most frequent clinical manifestation probably related to HPV infection was hemorrhagic cystitis, however almost 50% of HPV positive patients was asymptomatic.",

Two strains showed a mutation in codon 465 (Gly fi Arg), also leading to an amino acid substitution. However compared to the sequence of the gyrB fragment obtained from P. aeruginosa PAO1, some silent mutations were found. In parC, four strains exhibited amino acid substitution (Ser->Leu) in codon 87. A new mutation occurred in codon 35 leading to an amino acid substitution (Asp fi Glu) in two of the strains.

The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence of single QRDR mutations in parC gene of S. pneumoniae. Methods: Sixty-nine levofloxacin-susceptible pneumococci (MICs 1-2 mg/L) were isolated at the Microbiology Service of Hospital de Basuto, Bilbao (Spain) during 2004. Eight isolates showed a LVX MIC of 2 mg/L and 61 isolates showed a LVX MIC of 1 mg/L. We used a PCR-RFLP assay to screen 27 randomly chosen pneumococcal isolates with levofloxacin MIC of 1 mg/L and 8 isolates with a MIC of 2 mg/L for mutations known to confer resistance (parC: S79, D83; gyrA: S81, E85). The QRDR region of parC of isolates with suspected mutations was amplified by PCR and its DNA sequence determined. Results: Of the 27 strains with LVX MICs of 1 mg/L, no strains had a S79 or D83 ParC change. Among 8 strains with LVX MICs of 2 mg/L, 5 strains (62.5%) had a S79 or D83 ParC change. Four isolates showed single parC mutation (S79F, D83G, D83V). Only one isolate showed double parC mutation (S79F + K137N). No mutations in gyrA gene were detected in any strains. Conclusions: Fluoroquinolone resistance among S. pneumoniae remains low, however, an increase in isolates containing a parC mutation has been observed.

Methods: Twenty-four levofloxacin-resistant pneumococci (MICs > 4 mg/L) isolated from respiratory samples during 2004 were analysed. Minimal inhibitory concentrations (CMIs) to levofloxacin, gatifloxacin, moxifloxacin, and gemifloxacin were determined by agar dilution method using Mueller-Hinton agar with 5% horse blood. The QRDR regions of parC and gyrA were amplified by PCR and their DNA sequence determined. Results: Levofloxacin resistance was associated with combinations of at least two amino acid substitutions, most commonly involving ParC Ser79Phe (23/25), and GyrA Ser81Tyr (20/25). Of the 24 strains, three strains showed single parC mutation (S79F) and a double gyrA mutation (S81Y + E85G). One strain showed a K137N substitution in ParC and no mutations were found in the QRDR of gyrA. This strain may be harbour mutations in gyrB gene. None of the 24 strains was susceptible to gatifloxacin; twelve and twenty isolates were susceptible to moxifloxacin (CMI < 4 mg/L) and gemifloxacin (CMI < 1 mg/ L), respectively. Conclusions: The results suggest that resistance to levofloxacin require at least two substitutions of amino acids within the QRDR region of gyrase and topoisomerase IV, and that there is considerable cross-resistance among fluoroquinolones associated with these changes.",

Cystic fibrosis patients (CFP) are frequently infected with Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) and require repeat courses of AM therapy. As AM therapy may precipitate AM resistance, we tested sequential PA isolates from CFP, repeatedly treated with Cpx, by MIC and MPC. Methods: Sequential isolates were collected over a 3-yr period. PA isolates were tested to Cpx and levofloxacin (Lfx) by microbroth dilution in accordance with NCCLS guidelines. For MPC testing, 10 billion organisms were applied to agar plates containing drug and incubated 24-48 hr. The lowest concentration preventing growth was the MPC. PA strains were compared by pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) using Spe I. Results: Patient 1 (P1) (10 isolates) received 6 courses of Cpx (500-750 mg bid) and patient 2 (P2) 5 courses over the period collected (3 yrs). MICs for Cpx and Lfx for P1 and P2 ranged 0.031-1 lg/ml and 0.25-2 lg/ml respectively; MPCs ranged 1-4 lg/ml (79% \u00a3 2 lg/ml) and 2-16 lg/ml (64% \u2021 8 lg/ml) respectively. PFGE profile for P1 isolates were identical while P2 had 3 different strains. Cpx therapy did result in increased MPC values. Lfx MPC values were higher than Cpx in every instance. Conclusion: This represents first report of MPC testing on sequential PA isolates where AM history was available. MPCs remained constant to Cpx over the duration of organism isolations. MPCs to Lfx were high and beyond achievable and sustainable drug concentrations. As P1, P2 have never received Lfx, yet MPC values were so high, suggests Lfx will more readily select for quinolone resistant PA. MPC can be used to monitor changes in susceptibility and as such guide appropriate selection of AM therapy.",

Beside an attenuated Salmonella typhi live vaccine strain used in human, S. typhimurium strain TAD Salmonella vacT is being used as live vaccine strain in food-producing chicken. Attenuation of virulence has been achieved by random mutagenesis of the wildtype S. typhimurium DT009 strain M415 followed by selection for reduced virulence. Epidemiological markers of vaccine strain include reduced susceptibilities to rifampicin (rifR) and nalidixic acid (nalR) and the loss of tensid tolerance, presumably associated with altered membrane permeability (marker rtt). Curiously, the vaccine strain retains a high susceptibility to fluoroquinolones and macrolides. The present study aimed at understanding the molecular basis for this phenotype. Methods: TAD Salmonella vacT was characterized by determination of antibiotic susceptibility pattern, generation time, DNA-supercoiling degree, and DNA-sequence of the entire gyrA genes as well as the quinolone resistance-determining regions (QRDRs) of the remaining fluoroquinolone target genes gyrB, parC, and parE -encoding the subunits B of gyrase or A and B of topoisomerase IV, respectively. Results: Compared to its parent, TAD Salmonella vacT showed a reduced growth rate, but no significant changes in the DNA supercoiling. DNA sequence analysis of the complete gyrA gene revealed three novel mutations affecting codons 59 (trp-arg), 75 (gly-ala), and 867 (ser-ile) and one known point mutation at position 87 (asp-gly). Although the mutation at codon 87 is known to mediate quinolone resistance, the vaccine strain is highly susceptible to fluoroquinolones like sparfloxacin, and ciprofloxacin and only moderately resistant to nalidixic acid. Conclusions: Two hypotheses might -alone or in combinationexplain this phenotype (1) At least one of the novel gyrA mutations compensates for the fluoroquinolone resistance mutation (asp-87-gly) and (2) an increase in drug accumulation, resulting from the inactivation of a multi-drug efflux pump (presumably associated with the rtt marker) allows for a higher accumulation of fluoroquinolones -and macrolides-in the cell.",

Results: The qnrA gene was identified in two ESBL-positive isolates (1% of the ESBL (+) strains), an Enterobacter cloacae and a Citrobacter freundii isolate. The E. cloacae isolate expressed an SHV-5-like ESBL that was encoded on a plasmid that co-transferred the nalidixic-acid resistance in addition to resistance to kanamycin, tobramycin, chloramphenicol, trimethoprim, and sulfonamides. The C. freundii isolate possessed also a conjugative plasmid that harboured the qnrA gene associated with the blaVEB-1 gene and that conferred also resistance to streptomycin, tobramycin, chloramphenicol, rifampin, and sulfonamides. In both cases, the qnrA gene was located downstream of the Orf513 recombinase gene, as previously identified in other qnrA-positive isolates.",

The aim of this study is to trace Nalidixic acid resistance in Salmonella enterica isolates with the VITEK system, using the Norfloxacin MIC value as a marker of nalidixic acid resistance. Material and methods: Forty-two clinical Salmonella enterica isolates were collected during July-August 2004. The susceptibility tests were achieved by: 1) using AST-N020 cards and the VITEK system (bioM\u00e9rieux) Methods: Southern-RFLP analysis was also performed to investigate basic structural details of plasmids containing qnrA. Copy number of qnrA was determined by dot blot hybridization. Transcriptional studies were carried out using total RNA isolated from transconjugants grown in the absence or in the presence of ciprofloxacin or moxifloxacin at 0.2, 0.4, 0.8 or 1 x MIC. Results: qnrA is located in plasmids with similar mobility and identical Southern-RFLP (in all four plasmids, the qnrA probe hybridized with one EcoRI fragment of 4.1 Kb). MICs of quinolones against transconjugants from the same donor were identical, but MICs against transconjugants from different parental strains varied within a 4-fold range. qnrA copy numbers in strains UAB1 and 1132 were 8 times higher than in strains 1160, and 2.7 times higher than in strain N5. No differences in qnrA copy number in the E. coli transconjugants were observed. The amount of qnrA transcripts was at least 5-fold greater in the transconjugant from UAB1 than in the transconjugants from strain N5 or 1960 without quinolone induction. Differences in transcription of qnrA in different transconjugants were also noted at both basal levels and after induction by quinolones. A dose-response study of the inducing effect of ciprofloxacin on qnrA transcription was performed with transconjugants from strains UAB1, N5 and 1960, with a maximum effect at 0.4 XMIC. After induction with ciprofloxacin at 0.4 \u00b7 MIC, transcription of qnrA increased 4.3, 5.1 and 2.6 times over baseline in transconjugants from strains UAB1, N5, and 1960, respectively. Induction of qnrA by ciprofloxacin was 1.04, 2.2 and 2.03 times higher than that caused by moxifloxacin against transconjugants from UAB1, N5 and 1960, respectively. Conclusion: Regulation of qnrA expression may be similar in all four strains. There are differences in qnrA copy number in strains containing this gene. Transcriptional analysis revealed that both ciprofloxacin and moxifloxacin are able to induce qnrA gene, with ciprofloxacin being a better inducer than moxifloxacin.",

The odds ratios (OR) in Table 2 Conclusion: Trends in resistance in S. pneumoniae differed between Ireland and the UK, and between classes of antimicrobials. Resistance to penicillin, tetracycline and erythromycin decreased in Ireland but not to a similar extent in the UK, and there was no trend in ciprofloxacin resistance. Reasons for these differences should be sought.",

Methods: 3584 lower respiratory tract isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae were collected from a total of 27 laboratories in the UK and Ireland over the five winters from 1999-2000 to [2003] [2004] . Isolates were excluded if they were duplicates within 2 weeks, or from samples collected >48 hours after hospitalisation, or from patients with cystic fibrosis. MICs were determined centrally using the BSAC agar dilution method and interpreted by BSAC criteria. Logistic regression models for penicillin-nonsusceptibility and tetracycline-, erythromycin-and ciprofloxacin-resistance (PEN-NS, TET-R, ERY-R & CIP-R) were fitted, correcting for age, year and collecting laboratory. Results: Age was unknown for 4 patients. The median age was 62. PEN-NS, TET-R and ERY-R were modelled with age group as a categorical variable using the 40-49 group as baseline; resistance was least in this group and greater in both younger and older patients, as shown by the odds ratios (ORs) in Table 1 . CIP-R was modelled with a linear function of age; ORs corresponding to the median age within each age group are shown. Moxifloxacin-resistance (MXF-R, MIC > 1 mg/L) was too rare for logistic modelling, but was also strongly associated with age. Of the 29 MXF-R isolates (all with CIP MICs >8 mg/L), 25 (86%) were from patients aged \u2021 60 (Fisher's exact p < 0.001), and none was from a patient aged <50. Observed resistance rates for all isolates and for the baseline age group are shown in Table 2 . Conclusion: Patient age is a significant predictor of resistance in S. pneumoniae. Isolates from both young and elderly patients had increased risk of resistance to PEN, TET and ERY, but fluoroquinolone resistance increased linearly with age. Resistance to MXF was rare in the UK and Ireland, and was seen only in isolates from patients aged over 50.",

The study is primarily focused on those pathogens exhibiting antibiotic resistance and the results are used to supply timely feedback to contributing laboratories. Method: A sample of hospital laboratories participating in the European Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance System (EARSS) provided additional information on bloodstream infections arising from EARSS pathogens on a quarterly basis from the start of 2004. The additional information included patient demographic and hospital administrative data, risk factors, primary source and secondary foci. This information was linked to the resistance data for each isolate and hospital activity denominator data were used to calculate rates. Results: Data for quarters 1 and 2 resulted in 433 matched records from 7 representative hospital laboratories. Analyses of this dataset AND data received for quarters 3 and 4 of 2004 will be presented. Preliminary results indicated that most infections occurred in the younger and older ( \u202165 years) age groups. Malignancies were identified in a third of the patients. Recent surgery, ICU-stay and haemodialysis were particularly associated with MRSA bacteraemia. Respiratory tract infection was the most common source for S. pneumoniae bacteraemia, urinary tract for E. coli, and intra-abdominal/gastrointestinal tract for both E. coli and enterococci (including VRE). Different predominant sources of S. aureus infection were associated with different levels of methicillin-resistance: skin/soft tissue (low proportion of MRSA), CVC (medium) and respiratory tract (high).",

For the first time in 2003 two ampicillin-resistant beta-lactamase negative (0.6%) isolates were recovered. High rates of resistance were found for clarithromycin (36.9-25.7%) and co-trimoxazole (13.6-14.1%). The remaining drugs tested (ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, moxifloxacin, azithromycin, telithromycin, amoxicillin-clavulanate, chloramphenicol, tetracycline, 2nd and 3rd generation cephalosporins) were highly active: 100-94.6% of susceptible strains. In M. catarrhalis the susceptibility rates ranged from 22.7-18.9% (ampicillin) and 77.3-81.1% (co-trimoxazole) to 100% (amoxicillin-clavulanate, ceftriaxone, cefixime, telithromycin, azithromycin, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and moxifloxacin). Against MSSA the most active drugs (100%-92% susceptibility) were teicoplanin, rifampin, co-trimoxazole, ceftriaxone, cefaclor, telithromycin and levofloxacin. Conclusions: Antibiotic resistance among community-acquired respiratory pathogens circulating in Italy is on the rise in comparison to the values described in previous National Surveys (1997) (1998) (1999) (2000) . Globally, telithromycin, levofloxacin, amoxicillinclavulanate and ceftriaxone are the most active drugs.",

Haemophilus influenzae: 60 % of the total isolates (n = 129) were resistant to ampicillin. 62.5% of the total isolates (n = 135) were b-lactamase negative. 6 isolates (2.5%) were b-lactamase negative, however, resistant to Ampicillin (BLNAR) and only 1 isolate (0.16%) was b-lactamase positive but resistant to Amox/clav (BLPACR).The prevalence of invasive S. pneumoniae was seasonal with clear peaks during winter. The percentage of penicillin non susceptible S. pneumoniae among these strains displayed no seasonality. The prevalence of invasive and penicillin non susceptible S. pneumoniae was highest in children 4 years and younger. This emphasizes the importance of prudent antimicrobial use of antibiotics and vaccination in this age group. The proportion of erythromycin resistance among Penicillin non susceptible S. pneumoniae was not very high in comparison to other studies done mainly in Europe (EARSS). PNSP are still in general highly susceptible to Levofloxacin, Cefotaxime, and Imipenem.

Pet animals of these species have been reported as reservoirs of salmonellae sporadically transmitted to humans. Methods: The strains were characterized by serotyping, phage typing, antimicrobial susceptibility testing, with or without an efflux pump inhibitor (EPI), and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). Polymerase chain reaction and DNA sequencing were used to identify integron-borne gene cassettes and mutations in the GyrA, GyrB, ParC and ParE genes. Results: All 14 S. enterica strains were of serotype Typhimurium and of a phage type 12 variant. All were resistant to multiple antibiotics (AmpStr/SpcTetCmpSul) including Cip ( \u202116 mg/L) and, with one exception, Gen and Tmp. CipR was associated in each case with mutations in GyrA (Ser83Phe, Asp87Asn), GyrB (Ser464Phe) and ParC (Ser80Arg) and moderately decreased quinolone efflux. The 13 Gen-, Tmp-resistant strains carried oxa-30 and had a ca. 2 kb integron with aadA2 and dfrXII cassettes, while the Gen-, Tmp-susceptible strain contained oxa-30 and aadA2 cassettes, also in a ca. 2 kb integron. Using XbaI, the PFGE profiles of all strains were indistinguishable, while the use of BlnI revealed 3 discrete subgroups (with 1-or 2-band differences): a) 3 isolates, from 2 children and the snake which was identified as the source of infection; b) 10 isolates, from 4 children, 1 adult and the parrot, without documented contact; c) the Gen-, Tmp-susceptible isolate from a child who had been in contact with a pet snake. Conclusion: While the food chain is the most common route of animal-to-human transmission of salmonellae which may be resistant to multiple antibiotics including fluoroquinolones, the present study raises the possibility that exotic pet animals may become a reservoir of such strains which may be transmitted especially to young children.",

The objective of this study was to present alternative models to describe resistance development. During 1993 During -2003 956 Escherichia coli from urinary tract infections were systematically categorised for susceptibility to a fluoroquinolone, trimethoprim, ampicillin, cefadroxil, mecillinam and nitrofurantoin using the methodology and interpretive criteria of the Swedish Reference Group of Antibiotics. Three models were analysed. 'Associated resistance' was presented as the resistance rate of each drug in the presence and absence of resistance to each of the other drugs as previously described (JAC, 2003; 52, 128) . 'Susceptibility pattern changes' were described as a change in rank order of patterns and in the number of different patterns over time. 'Resistance load' was expressed by transforming the susceptibility pattern of each strain into a numerical value: the susceptibility pattern SSSSSR corresponded to 2 (0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 2) and the pattern RSSIRS to 5 (2 0 + 0 + 1 + 2 + 0). The minimum and maximum 'resistance load' were 0 and 12, respectively. Results: Associated resistance was high all through the observation period. As an example, trimethoprim resistance in E.coli resistant and sensitive to ampicillin was 28% versus 3% in 1993 and 43% versus 4% in 2003. The five most common is not yet standardized. The present study compared outcome of cut-off levels at 30 and 365 days on 14 years of surveillance data for E.coli and S.aureus. Materials and methods: All consecutive isolates of E. coli (n = 62380) and S. aureus (n = 24743) from routine susceptibility testing at our laboratory (1990) (1991) (1992) (1993) (1994) (1995) (1996) (1997) (1998) (1999) (2000) (2001) (2002) (2003) were included. Duplicates were identified and excluded based on a unique personal identification number, species and cut-off time (30 and 365 days) from first isolate. Susceptibility testing was performed as recommended by the Swedish Reference Group of Antibiotics and did not change over the years except for fluoroquinolones (norfloxacin 1990-1993, ciprofloxacin 1994-2000, nalidixic acid 2001-2003) .",

Twenty-three were positive for presence of Int1, and they could be divided into 13 RFLP types, six unique and seven which were also found in E. coli.A total of 19 distinct Int1 types with one to three gene cassettes were found in the 148 isolates. Four types accounted for 72% of the isolates, and two of these were associated only with E. coli.The predominant Int1-determined antibiotic resistance was directed towards streptomycin/spectinomycin (seven distinct genes in 127 isolates) and trimethoprim (eight distinct genes in 70 isolates). Six isolates carried a sat1 gene conferring resistance to the veterinary antibiotic streptotricin. The number of class 1 integrons carrying genes conferring resistance to \u00df-lactam antibiotics (four) or gentamicin (three) was conspicuously low. Conclusions: Presence of class 1 integrons and acquired resistance to sulphonamides were 2-3 times more prevalent in E. coli than in other representatives of Enterobacteriaceae.

The purpose of this study was to analyse the molecular basis of the drug-resistance in isolates collected from that setting. Methods: 113 drug-resistant E. coli isolates, collected from 72 healthy individuals, were subjected to clonal analysis by means of RAPD. Isolates presenting the most common multi-drug resistance (MDR) pattern (ampicillin, tetracycline, chloramphenicol, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole: A/T/C/S pattern) (n = 35) were investigated for the nature and transferability of resistance determinants, and for plasmid profiles.",

In contrast, sequence variability between genera (similarities of \u00a368%) and between species (similarities of \u00a3 82%) allowed a precise identification to the species level. In particular it was possible to differentiate Rhizopus oryzae from R. microsporus and to discriminate between the different Mucor spp. Only the sequences for the 5 A. corymbifera were heterogeneous with 60 to 100% similarities between strains. Interestingly, none of the studied species owned the universal fungal primer sequence ITS 2 / ITS 3.",

For strains identified as A. corymbifera, a higher number of isolates have to be studied. The molecular data obtained here are promising for development of new diagnosis methods of zygomycosis in patients. Objectives: Culture of infected tissues during zygomycosis is often negative. In these cases the only available diagnostic tool is histopathology demonstrating large, non-septated hyphae characteristic of zygomycetes. Nevertheless, identification at the genus or species level is not possible by conventional histopathology. The aim of this study was to evaluate the usefulness of rDNA sequencing for species identification in tissues of mice infected with various zygomycetes. Methods: Mice were infected intravenously with nine different species of the order Mucorales (Rhizopus oryzae, R. microsporus var rhizopodiformis, Absidia corymbifera, Mucor indicus, M. circinelloides, M. racemosus, Rhizomucor pusillus, Cunninghamella bertholletiae, and Syncephalastrum racemosum).

Mice challenged with C. bertholletiae and S. racemosum received 100 mg*kg)1*d)1 of hydrocortisone subcutaneously before infection. Mice were sacrificed 3-4 days post infection. Brain and kidneys were aseptically removed, homogenized and complete genomic DNA was extracted with CTAB/Chloroform. Fungal DNA was PCR-amplified with the universal fungal primer set V9D (5'-3', TTAAGTCCCTGCCCTTTGTA) and LS266 (3'-5', GAGTCGAGTTGTTTGGGAATGC).

Furthermore for six species, sequencing of the ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 region allowed identification of the infecting strain to the species level while technical problems impaired analysis of the sequences of C. bertholletiae and S. racemosum. Conclusions: We set-up animal models of zygomycosis for the most common species responsible for infections in humans and demonstrated that extraction, amplification and sequencing of fungal DNA is possible directly from infected tissues. Strains were cultured in liquid RPMI medium and DNA was extracted from the mycelium by DNEasy plant kit (Qiagen). ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 region DNA was then PCR amplified by using the universal fungal primers LS266 and V9D. Both strands sequencing was performed, sequences were aligned with Clu-stalW and both intra-and inter-species sequence similarities were assessed. Aligned sequences were also used to generate phylogenetic trees. Results: M. mycetomatis appeared to be a homogeneous species, with 91 to 100% homologies between strains (except for one strain that differed significantly and raises the issue of its identification). Similarly, few intra-species variations were found for C. lunata and E. jeanselmei, with 93 to 100% homologies between strains. L. senegalensis and L. tompkinsii showed intraspecies similarities of >99% but similarity between the two species was < 90%. In contrast, P. romeroi and M. grisea appeared heterogeneous with intra-species similarities of 40 to 100% and 53 to 100%, respectively. Inter-genera and inter-species variations were important (except between P. romeroi and M. grisea) with sequence homologies of < 80% between genera. Conclusions: P. romeroi and M. grisea are heterogeneous species whereas within the other species a high degree of sequence homologies are observed. These results show that sequencing of ITS region is a suitable tool for identification of black grains mycetoma agents usually difficult to identify by standard phenotypic methods.",

Methods: Eighty-four sequential bronchoalveolar lavage samples from patients analysed by methanamine silver and Giemsa staining methods were stored at )70\u00b0C and subsequently analysed by PCRs. The BALs were collected over a 20-month period. The real-time PCR was designed to the dihydropteroate synthase (DHPS) to be specific for P. jiroveci and enable sequencing of the PCR product to determine resistance mutations at nucleotide positions 165 and 171. A conventional PCR to the mitochondrial large sub-unit rRNA described by Wakefield et al (Lancet. 1990; 336:451-3) was also performed on all 84 BALs. Results: The staining methods showed that 16/84 (19%) patients had PCP. The real-time PCR and the conventional PCR both detected P. jiroveci in 19/84 (22.6%). All the samples positive by the staining method were positive and the 3 additional positives were detected by both PCR methodologies. Using the staining methods as the 'Gold Standard', the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value for the PCR methods were 100%, 96%, 84% and 100% respectively. The mean cycle threshold (Ct) value for the 16 stain positives was 31.5 and for the 3 stain negative/PCR positives was 41.5. Analysis of the clinical records and microbiological results of the 3 discrepant samples showed that no other microbiological agent was found and PCP was the most likely clinical diagnosis. The 19 positives were all sequenced and no resistance mutations were found. The time to perform the different methods was 2.5 hours, 3 hours and 5 hours for the staining methods, real-time PCR and conventional PCR. The sequencing could be performed directly after the real-time PCR and results were available in one working day.",

The most of antifungal drugs available for clinical use are targeted four molecules including: beta-glucan, sterol-alpha-demethylase, ergosterol and DNA/RNA synthesis. The limited selection of effective antifungal agents combined with the emergence of drug resistance, has resulted in a critical need for development new drugs directed against novel molecular targets. In the present study we tried to Characterize the Gene encoded Beta-tubulin protein in this fungus which can be used as a potential molecular targets of novel drugs.Clinical isolated of T. rubrum were cultured on liquid medium and the Nucleic Acids (DNA & RNA) were isolated from obtained mycelial mass by standard methods. The sequences of known Beta-tubulin genes in other fungi were aligned and pairs of 21 nt primers were designed from highly conserved regions. Using mentioned primers, we amplified predicted molecules by using genomic DNA as well as cDNA of T.rubrum as PCR templates.By the time, 1200 nucleotides have been sequenced from this new gene which encodes a polypeptide with 400 amino acids. Nucleotide sequence comparison in gene data banks (NCBI, NIH) for both the partial DNA and its deduced amino acid sequence revealed significant homology with members of the eukaryotic Beta-tubulin genes. The amino acid sequence of the encoded protein was about 82% identical to the sequence of Beta-tubulin proteins from other fungi.Considering the role of Tubulin protein in formation of mitotic spindle structure in the cells, the Beta-tubulin gene may be applied in antifungal research fields. Moreover it can be used to determining the molecular action of some drugs including mitotic spindle structure in fungi, leading to metaphase arrest. The probable mechanisms of Beta-tubulin expression inhibition as well as definition of its possible role in the physiological function of T. rubrum are still under investigation.

In 2 patiens the agent isolated from second blood culture was different from that isolated from the first one. In 4 cases out of 10 the results corresponded well with results of detection of mannan antigen or antimannan antibodies in serum of the patients. In no cases the blood sample was positive by cultivation. The possible cause of negative cultivation was antifungal therapy in most of these patients which could supress the growth of yeasts in blood cultures. Our results suggest that the combination of PCR detection of fungal DNA with the proof of mannan antigen and antimannan antibodies can help in the diagnostics of fungal blood stream infections, especially in patients under antimycotic therapy.

Early diagnosis is important to achieve the best outcome for these patients; however, definite proof often is difficult to obtain due to counterindicated invasive procedures.

Methods: Dengue RT-PCR was performed daily for 6 months on RNA extracted from serum (Qiagen viral RNA minikit). The PCR kit (Artus GmbH Germany) included an internal control for every sample and was performed on a lightcycler (Roche). We performed an in-house multiplex gel based PCR assay with primers aimed at C.albicans, C. glabrata, C.tropicalis and C. parapsilosis. The PCR was applied, without DNA extraction, to the supernatant from BactAlert FAN bottles that had been left to stand to allow the charcoal particles to settle. These bottles had flagged positive and been shown to contain yeasts by Gram's stain. Neat and doubling dilutions in saline to 1:8 were tested. Results: The inhibition control was positive for all sera tested with the Artus Dengue RT-PCR kit, meaning that the PCR process was successful without significant inhibition in any of the samples. Inhibition was detected using neat broth from BactAlert FAN bottles but was not detected at a 1:2 dilution. Conclusion: Inhibition of PCR performed on sera is not common and it is unnecessary to control for inhibition. PCR on the supernatant from BactAlert FAN bottles is subject to inhibition. However, PCR was successful on all supernatants diluted 1:2. This assay was used on samples known to contain yeasts, demonstrated by Gram's stain, so an absent signal would suggest inhibition or a species not recognised by the primers. While a negative result might delay the identification to species level and refinement of antifungal chemotherapy, it would not delay the diagnosis of candidaemia. This data supports the view that inhibition controls are unnecessary for PCR applications validated to perform adequately. Furthermore, inhibition is a considerable problem with bacterial cultures but it is not standard practice to detect and report this inhibition, so it would be inconsistent to make inhibition controls obligatory for nucleic acid tests. Briefly, the EIA is a sandwich style system that uses rabbit polyclonal antibody to Histoplasma antigen as capture; plates are then blocked and allowed to dry. Test samples are added, allowed to incubate and washed off. Next, the same polyclonal antibody used as capture but containing a biotin label is added followed by streptavidin-horse radish peroxidase. After incubation, the conjugates are washed off, and (3,3',5,5'-tetramethyl benzidine) TMB is added as substrate. The reaction is stopped using 2N H 2 SO 4 , and the endpoint optical density (OD) is read at 450 nm-630 nm. Results: Intralaboratory correlation was good with a single sample of purified galactomannan antigen testing positive on day one and negative on day two in both SSI and MVD labs. Interlaboratory correlation was excellent, comparing results from both labs for day two, each of the 18 samples and controls resulted in an identical result interpretation according to these guidelines where results are expressed as EIA units (EU): <1.0 EU is negative (n = 8); >1.0 -<2.0 EU is weak positive (n = 1); >2.0 -<10.0 EU is moderate positive (n = 4); and >10.0 EU is high positive (n = 5). All results remained within these categories at both laboratories. Conclusion: The excellent correlation of results supports the feasibility of developing a Histoplasma antigen EIA test kit that can be used for reference testing at SSI.",

All data were recorded in a departmental information system. Results: 79.165 BCs were drawn during the study period. 359 (0.45%; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.41-0.50%) yielded growth of yeast species (C. albicans 62.8%, C. glabrata 14.9% , C. parapsilosis 9.0%, C. tropicalis 3.3%, C. krusei 3.3%, other yeast species 6.8%).

Conclusions: Echinococcosis is a parasitosis that presents a big problem for Public Health in Albania. Based in our data the incidence of infection is very consistent every year. The parasite can affect adults and children as well. Women are infected approximately two times more than men due to longer exposure to domestic animals and the parasite. There is not a clear difference between urban and rural areas in terms of where the prevalence of the disease is higher. The reason is probably a persistant migration of the population from one area to another. The laboratory diagnosis of Echinococcosis based on one or more serological tests has a great importance for the treatment of the patients.",

Methods: Sera of 112 healthy Hungarian blood donors were collected between December 1999 and January 2000. The specimens were tested by Yop-specific IgG and IgA ELISAs (Mikrogen, Germany). Samples were also subjected to tube agglutination using Y. enterocolitica O3, O9 and Y. pseudotubercolusis I-II-III-IV-V antigens. Specimens exhibiting agglutination with yersinia antigens were also tested with brucella and salmonella OB and OD antigens. Results: Of the 112 sera tested 46 (41%) exhibited a positive anti-Yop reaction in the IgG, and 17 (15.1 %) in the IgA class, while the boundary figures were 7 (6.2%) and 6 (5.3%), respectively. All the IgA positive and boundary samples were also positive for IgG. Objectives: Y. enterocolitica and Y. pseudotuberculosis infections are manifested as enterocolitis, mesenteric lymphadenitis, reactive arthritis and erythema nodosum. Important factors in the pathogenicity of the yersinias are associated with the presence of virulence plasmid coded for release proteins (Yersinia outer membrane proteins, YOPs). The detection of antibodies to these proteins is a highly specific and very sensitive method for the serological diagnosis of all forms of yersiniosis. The aim of this study was the use of an enzyme immunoassay (ELISA) in combination with a western blotting assay for the detection of antibodies against YOPs of pathogenic Yersinia strains in serodiagnosis of yersiniosis. Methods: A total number of 171 sera collected from equal number of children, aged from 5-12 years, referred as probable cases of yersiniosis were tested. These children were hospitalised in the Paediatric Clinic of University Hospital of Ioannina (NW Greece) during a 4-year period (2001) (2002) (2003) (2004) Objectives: Human visceral leishmaniasis (HVL) is endemic in several foci in IRAN, such as Ardebil and Fars provinces (in North western and south part of IRAN) and in some region as sporadic. Visceral leishmaniasis in Iran is Mediterranean type and the causative agent is leishmania infantum and its main reservoir is dog. Methods: In this study direct agglutination test (DAT) was compared with indirect fluorescent antibody test (IFAT) for the diagnosis of visceral leishmaniasis in patients suspected of kala-azar.A total of 70 serum samples collected from suspected kala-azar patients mainly in the kala-azar endemic areas. The leishmania infantum antigens (MHO/TN/80/IPTi) for these studies were prepared in Department of parasitology, school of medicine, Isfahan university of medical sciences. The principal phases of the procedure from making DAT antigen were mass production of promastigotes of leishmania in the RPMI1640 + fetal bovine serum, Trypsiniznation of parasites, staining with coomassie blue and fixing with formaldehyde.",

Conclusions: These results showed that a simple local laboratory with one or two trained technicians is quite sufficient for DAT, sero-diagnosis and serological survey of kala-azar in an endemic area. According to the results of these studies, it seems that in Kala azar endemic areas, the clinical symptoms of Visceral leishmaniasis, particularly among the children with DAT antibody titers equal or >1:3200 is a good indication for specific treatment of Kala-azar.",

Objectives: Staphylococci, especially Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus aureus, are important pathogens in the context of implanted medical device infections. The ability to establish multilayered biofilms on the surface of foreign bodies significantly contributes to the pathogenicity of these species. The polysaccharide intercellular adhesin (PIA), synthesized by icaADBC encoded proteins, mediates biofilm accumulation in S. epidermidis and S. aureus. Therefore, PIA appears to be a suitable antigen for novel diagnostic tools. In order to measure the humoral immune response appropriate systems for the specific detection of anti-PIA-antibodies are demanded. Results: We here describe the development of an enzymelinked immuno sorbent assay (ELISA) specifically detecting anti-PIA antibodies in human sera. 96-well Maxisorp plates (Nunc) were coated with purified PIA. Using these PIA-coated plates, an IgG titer of 1:8000 was detected in the serum of a rabbit immunized with purified PIA. In contrast, in the pre immune serum 16fold lower titers were detected. Absorption of the anti-PIA antiserum against PIA-positive S. epidermidis 1457 lead to an 84 % reduction of the serum reactivity, whereas absorption against PIA-negative 1457-M10 had no effect, demonstrating the specificity of the test. This was confirmed by competition ELISA experiments where purified PIA but not pneumococcal or meningococcal capsule polysaccharides specifically inhibited binding of the antibodies to immobilized PIA up to 68 %. Using this ELISA, in serum samples from 10 patients with endoprosthesis-associated infections due to clonally independent icaADBC-and PIA-positive S. epidermidis strains anti-PIA-antibody titers ranging from 1:20000 -1:36000 were detected. In contrast, in a collection of serum samples from patients with endoprosthesis-related infections due to icaADBCnegative S. epidermidis and from healthy blood donors IgG titers were only 1:2000-1:6000.",

Ten isolates showed one hybridising band of either 6.3, 9.0 or 14 kb. Seven isolates showed two hybridising bands of 6.3 and 9.0 kb and one strain two banda of 6.0 and 9.0 kb, indicating the presence of two copies of a Tn916-Tn1545 like elements. Heterogeneity in these elements was observed. The E-test results indicated that isolates with two copies of tetracycline resistance elements were resistant (88%) or inducibly resistant to tetracycline (12%), whereas isolates with one copy were resistant (36%), inducibly resistant (18%) or susceptible (46%) to this antibiotic. Three isolates were also erm(B)positive and resistant to erythromycin. The bands obtained using tet(M) and erm(B) probes overlapped at 9.0 kb, indicating the presence of a Tn1545-like element. The association of these genes was also confirmed by PCR. Seven different alleles were identified sequencing the tet(M) gene of prototype strains among those examined. In the present study 75% of the specimens were positive for C. difficile TcdA/TcdB toxins, 31% were positive for CPEnt C. perfringens and 28% gave positive test results for both C. difficile and C. perfringens toxins. We were found relatively a small number of enterotoxigenic C. perfringens (CPEnt) strains. All strains C. difficile and C. perfringens were susceptible for metronidazole. The occurrence of C. perfringens (CPEnt) as etiologic agents of nosocomial diarrhoea is not known in Poland. In our laboratory, we have found a suprisingly significant number of C. perfringens enterotoxin (CPEnt) positive stools. We conclude that C. perfringens is a potential cause of AAD in Poland. Those willing to participate were instructed how to collect the specimen, and provided with a dacron swab, a sterile empty tube, and an envelope in which to place the tube. Subjects were asked to complete a short questionnaire on sexual practices and medical check-ups for sexually transmitted disease (STD). Specimens were returned to the laboratory within 36 h. C. trachomatis was detected using a previously validated inhouse PCR method. The tip of the swab was cut off using sterile scissors and placed into a 2-ml microcentrifuge tube to which 600 \u2021of PBS (pH 7.4) was added. The tube was vortexed for 30 s, and then the swab pressed against the wall of the tube to squeeze out the fluid before discarding it using sterile forceps. The fluid was centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 20 min, the supernatant discarded and the pellet resuspended PCR buffer containing proteinase K and Tween-20. It was incubated at 55\u00b0C for 1 h and then heated at 80\u00b0C to inactivate the proteinase K. Ten microlitres of the treated sample were used for PCR using primers for C. trachomatis. Thirty cycles of 30 s at 94\u00b0C followed by 1 min at 60\u00b0C and 1 min at 72\u00b0C were used for amplification, with final annealing of 7 min at 72\u00b0C and 7 min at 15\u00b0C. The amplified DNA was run on a 1% agarose gel and visualized with ethidium bromide. Positive and negative controls were used on each occasion. Results: Of 180 CSW invited to participate, specimens were collected from 163, none of whom were aware of a current infection with C. trachomatis.

In the final protocol, the internal control of the PCR kit was incorporated in the sample tube on the m1000 apparatus in order to control the whole extraction protocol. These extraction and PCR conditions were then evaluated in a prospective study involving 300 clinical specimens of sperm (n = 285) or urine (n = 15). Results: In the preliminary experiments, the specimens detected positive by Cobas Amplicor and kept frozen were all found positive by combining the automated extraction protocol and real-time PCR. The extraction protocol was found suitable either on crude sperms or on sperm pellets, with a reproducible quality of extraction on the m1000 apparatus, as evaluated after quantification of the human beta-globin gene. The sensitivity of detection in sperms was at least of 1 copy/microlitre elution volume of positive control. In the prospective study, 5 positive specimens were detected, one in urine (6.6%) and 4 in sperm (1.4%). The inhibition rate in sperm was 1.4% (4/285); a pretreatment of samples with proteinase K and SDS removed these inhibitors. The whole duration of the process, including automated extraction and real-time PCR testing, was 4 hours for at least 30 samples.

Objectives: To estimate efficacy of the hepatitis B immunoprophylaxis in children with malignant diseases. Materials and methods: 250 children with different malignancy at the age from 0 to 16 years (median 6 years) which received the chemotherapy were included in the study. 124 patients received an active immunization by the recombinant vaccines \u00abEngerix B\u00bb or \u00abHB-Vax II\u00bb by scheme: 0-1-2-6 months, 10 mkg -21 patients, 20 mkg -92 patients. 13 patients received a combined immunoprophylaxis -specific antibody \u00abHepatekt\u00bb 20 MU/kg by scheme: 0-1-2-3-4-5 months along with \u00abHB-Vax II\u00bb, 0-1-2-6 months, 10 mkg. Vaccination was conducted in the children without serologic marker of the hepatitis B at the first 3-7 day after the diagnosis of malignancy. 113 children with malignancy not received the specific immunoprophylaxis, and formed a control group. Results: After the 6 months, the level of the protective antibodies (anti-HBs) was exceeded 10 mMU/ml (the titre median 15.3 mMU/ml) in 66% of children, which received 20 mkg vaccines, and in 25% of children, which received 10 mkg vaccines (g < 0.05).

Currently, the diagnostic sensitivity of most commercial HBsAg tests is below 0.5 ng/ml. However, false negative results are still obtained. This may be due to the presence of HBsAg below the detection limit of the assay, which could occur in early acute disease or in chronic and convalescent phases of the disease. Mutant HBV strains with altered antigens have been shown to affect the reactivity of the antigens with some commercial HBsAg assays.

Conclusion: In chronic renal failure patients, the short schedule of vaccination against hepatitis B is less efficient than the standard 6-months schedule. A 4-week schedule may be indicated only in patients who have no time to receive a vaccination with a classic schedule.

Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is one of the main infectious agent through needle stick injury. Therefore, HBV vaccination is strongly recommended for HBV exposure risk group. Through the surveillance we studied how many HCWs could get anti-HBs after vaccination and analysed the effects of HBV vaccination in Korean HCWs. Methods: We surveyed 571 hospital HCWs (doctors, nurses, aid-nurses and technicians) about previous HBV vaccination history and tested HBsAg, anti-HBs with titer and HBcAb,IgG using enzyme immunoassay. After that, we recommended HBV vaccinations according to 3 cycle schedules (0.1 and 2 months) in 118 cases of anti-HBs negative HCWs. Results: Of 571 persons, 118 showed anti-HBs negative results. Among them, 58 persons had completely finished 3 cycle HBV vaccination programme. The ratio of male to female was 11:47(19%:81%). The positive rate of anti-HBs were 65.5%(38), 81.0%(47) and 93.1%(54) after 1st, 2nd and 3rd cycle respectively. However, the anti-HBs titers were not associated with vaccination cycles. The 4 cases of anti-HBs negative persons had no previous vaccination histories and HBcAb were also negative. The HBcAb negative group showed remarkably higher anti-HBs titers compared with HBcAb positive group (622 IU/mL vs. 52 IU/mL) though their anti-HBs formation rates were lower than HBcAb positive group (92% vs. Objective: Needle stick injury associated with HBV is not a rare accident among hospital healthcare workers (HCWs). The prevalence of HBV infection was reported as 5-8% in Korea. Therefore basic data about prevalence of HBV viral markers (HBsAg, HbsAb and HBcAb) with vaccination histories in health care workers are very useful for the guideline of hospital infection control and HCW benefit. Methods: We tried to survey 725 HCWs including doctors, nurses, aid-nurses and technicians and 571 HCWs (123 male and 448 female) participated in the surveillance and answered about previous HBV vaccination histories. HBsAg, HBsAb (Elecsys 2010, Roche) and HBcAb, IgG (Centaur, Bayer) were analysed with enzyme immunoassay. Results: The positive rate of HBsAg and HBsAb was 2.4% and 76.8% respectively. HBsAg())/HBsAb()) cases were 20.7%. The range of HBsAb positive rates were 64.3%-79.6% according to the occupational divisions. The division of nurse was the most (80%) and group of doctors (64%) were the least prevalent HBsAb positive groups respectively. Of all cases, 24.2% did not have HBV vaccination histories and 68.8% had experienced more than 1 time of HBV vaccination. The HBsAb titers between 100 and <1000 IU/mL were most popular in HBsAb positive cases. Among 571 cases, 74.1% showed negative HBcAb, IgG and 76.1% of them had HBsAb. The cases showing positive HBcAb also represented 78.1% positive in HBsAb tests. Conclusion: The prevalence of HBsAg and HBsAb in HCWa in a Korean hospital was similar to general population on Korea. We need more education or announcement for the group of doctors about HBV vaccination. About 75% of hospital HCWs had not been exposed to HBV mainly because of HBV vaccinations. However, no difference was found between vaccination group and non-vaccination group in HBsAb positivity, suggest-ing Korea is still high prevalent area about HBV infection. Therefore, we need to practice HBV vaccination programme for about 20% of HCWs in case of HBV exposures, such as a needle stick injury.",

Methods: HBsAg testing was done with Vidas HbsAg and HbsAg-Ultra (bioM\u00e9rieux), Advia Centaur HBsAg (Roche), Axsym HbsAg (V2) (Abbott), Abbott Prism HBsAg (Abbott) and Access AgHBs (Analis). HBV surface antibodies (HBsAb), HBV e antigen and antibody (HBeAg and HBeAb) were tested with Vidas (bioM\u00e9rieux), HBV core antibodies (HBcAb) with Access (Analis). DNA was extracted from serum and amplification was done by real time PCR with primers directed to the precore/core gene of HBV.For analysis of the S-gene sequence, cycle sequencing was done with primers targeting the small S-gene. Results: Before HTx, the patient was HBsAg and HBV DNA negative but HBcAb and HbsAb positive. Three years after HTx, elevated liver tests were found repeatedly but serological investigation for HAV, HCV, CMV, HSV and EBV was negative. Real time PCR detected high load of HBV-DNA. None of the above mentioned serological assays was able to detect HBsAg in the serum of the HTx patient. However, HBcAb, HBsAb, HBeAg as well as HBeAb were positive.The HBV small surface antigen sequences were analysed by cycle sequencing and compared with NCBI Genbank sequences. This revealed the presence of multiple missense mutations: 15 mutations (compared to AY236162) were found in the major hydrophilic loop (aa 98-169), the most antigenic part of the small surface antigen. Conclusion: The virus escaped detection by all commercial serological HBsAg assays tested. The majority of the antibodies used in these assays are directed against the small surface antigen, and binding is strongly influenced by the presence of missense mutations at crucial loci present in the viral DNA. Future serological assays for detection of HBsAg should take mutations in the major hydrophilic loop into account in an attempt to detect as much HBV mutants as possible.",

In Western Europe hepatitis E virus (HEV) infection is rare and only imported cases have been reported. Recently, autochthonous cases in some industrialized countries have emerged in patients who had never travelled to endemic areas .The aim of this study was to describe nine autochthonous sporadic cases of HEV infection in Madrid (Spain). Methods: From June 1999 to September 2004, nine patients with acute hepatitis and IgG anti-HEV antibodies in serum specimens were detected at our hospital. Viral markers for HAV, HBV and HCV were negative with an EIA assay (Assxym, Abbott Diagnostics). IgG and IgM anti-HEV antibodies were studied by EIA (Bioelisa HEV IgG and Bioelisa HEV IgM, Biokit; Barcelona, Spain). Detection of RNA-HVC and DNA-HVB was performed with TaqManR (Roche Diagnostics). All patients had increased aminotransferase levels and symptoms of acute hepatitis. Patients were questioned about epidemiological risk factors related to HEV infection such as travelling to endemic areas or contact with animals. Results: Anti-HEV IgG and IgM antibodies were found in all patients. Seven patients were males and two females, mean age 61.4 years (46-80) with mean ALT values of 1418 (84-5727).

One of the objectives of this survey was to assess the impact of the hepatitis B vaccination programme, which started in May 1996 and included a catch-up campaign for all adolescents aged 12-15. Methods: Venous blood from 2679 individuals were screened for the presence of antibodies to hepatitis A virus antigen and antibodies to hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) using an enzyme immunoassay.

In societies showing moderate endemicity, primary transmission route is personal contact, on the other hand water originated outbreaks may be seen. Methods and Results: In this study, a hepatitis A outbreak observed in a local school following an explosion in the sewer system in a street in Istanbul Sariyer on September 27th 2004, is investigated. 32 children attending this school and living at homes around had hepatitis A, clinically, the first case seen 25 days after the explosion. Age distribution of the children is 1-18 and the mean age is 8.4. The first case was detected on October 22nd and 21 cases were reported in the first 6 days and 32 cases were seen in 17 days. Water samples were taken and fecal contamination was searched at the school in order to find out the origin. The canteen and the toilets were also searched. All the students were checked up to find out new cases. Teachers and students were educated about the disease and hygiene by doctors of Health Group Presidency, continuity of education was provided by a doctor in charge throughout the outbreak and other schools around were checked and educated by cooperation with Directory of National Education. Origin research was also performed at homes of all cases and the families were informed about the disease and quarantine precautions. ISKI was quickly informed about the subject and controls by taking water examples and documentations were also done by ISKI. Conclusion: The dimensions of an outbreak of an infectious disease transmitted by water fecal-orally in a metropolis of 11 million population may be great. In our country report of hepatitis A is obligatory. Because of this, the origin of the disease is searched soon after reported cases and the isolation of the cases is provided. Hepatitis A vaccine is not included in the National Vaccination Programme of our country. If there is not a serious risk to have the disease in childhood, there is no need for passive immunization. All the contacts were evaluated in this respect, also. The outbreak was under control at the end of the first week by the precautions and education at the school with a population of 1400.",

Established underlying diseases for childhood herpes zoster were found in 17 (89%) of 19 cases. The most common underlying diseases were lymphoma (6 patients) and acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (5 patients). No history of varicella was recalled in 9 (47%) of 19 cases. The interval between varicella and herpes zoster ranged from 4 to 144 months. Involved dermatomes were thoracic (10 patients), servical (7 patients) and sacral (2 patients). Two dermatomal involvement was detected in only two children. Two children experienced mild pain during the eruption, without requiring specific therapy. In 3 (15%) of 19 cases, herpes zoster-associated complications including pneumonia, hepatitis and keratoconjunctivitis were noted. None of the patients was immunized against varicella. The mean period between the onset of rash and the initiation of acyclovir treatment was 2.4 \u00b1 1.1 days (range 1-5 days). Eighteen of 19 cases received intravenous acyclovir treatment. Five of these patients had received sequential parenteral/oral acyclovir treatment, whereas only one patient received only oral treatment. Acyclovir treatment was discontinued because of renal toxicity in one child. The mean treatment period was 7.7 \u00b1 1.0 days (range 7-10 days) in 18 patients. No cases with post herpetic neuralgia were recorded. Conclusion: Acyclovir treatment started on time, is very important for the prevention of progress of the disease. Acyclovir treatment is so effective that acyclovir prophylaxis seems unnecessary to prevent or modify clinical varicella in immunocompromised children. Varicella immunization is important for prevention of varicella and herpes zoster. Objectives: Herpesviruses are among the most 'successful' human pathogens. Inhibition of apoptosis is a common strategy of viral pathogenesis that favors virus replication and may contribute to oncogenesis. The herpes simplex viruses 1 and 2 (HSV1, HSV2) code for a variety of proteins that cooperate in blocking apoptosis triggered by virus infection. Nitric oxide (NO), a potentially toxic signal molecule, has been implicated in a wide range of diverse pathophysiological process. The crosstalk between cell destructive and protective signaling pathways, their activation or inhibition under the modulatory influence of NO will determine the possible role of NO in apoptotic cell death and/or survival. Acylovir's effect mechanism targets at the viral DNA polymerase, acts as a chain terminator. Its first phosphorylation step is catalyzed by the virus encoded thymidine kinase. Acyclovir's interactions with cell death and NO seem to be very important because of 'post treatmental cognitive functions'that may be encountered due to treatment processes for encephalitis, meningitis cases. Methods: HEp-2 cells were infected by HSV1 (KOS strain) (and UV-inactivated Mock of the same strain) and HSV2 (G strain) (and UV-inactivated Mock of the same strain). Infected cells were treated by non apoptotic doses of acyclovir (48.8; 24.4; 12.2; 6.1; 3; 1.5 lg/mL), respectively. Following 24 hours of infection cells were detected by Hoechst 33342 and propidium iodide for apoptosis/necrosis, and culture supernatants by Griess reagent for NO. Results: NO responses were significantly higher in HSV 1 infected cells in 48.4; 24.4; 12.2, but after 6.1, in 3 and in 1.5 NO responses were higher in HSV2 infected cells. Also in HSV1 infected cells with 48.4; 24.4; 12.2 doses of acyclovir, apoptotic responses were higher than HSV2. But necrosis responses were significantly higher in HSV2 infected cells (48.8; 24.4; 12.2; 6.1; 3 lg /mL). Conclusion: In this study, it is shown that there are significant differences between HSV 1 and 2 in apoptosis/necrosis, and NO responses. It is assumed that involvement of acyclovir in doses higher than 6 lg/mL may trigger the necrotic pathway in HSV2 infected cells, the same compound seems to cause statistically significant higher NO response in HSV1 infected cells in contrast to those infected with HSV2. These results deserve further studies in order to explain the effects of acyclovir in treatment processes especially in 'cognitive functions'.",

We have solved the crystal structure of UL44 to 1.85 A resolution. Remarkably, the structure revealed a dimer of UL44 shaped like a C-clamp that could partially surround double-stranded DNA. Each monomer resembles herpes simplex virus UL42, with the dimer interface near the base of a region of UL44 identified in the crystal structure as the 'connector loop'. Analytical ultracentrifugation and gel filtration measurements demonstrated that UL44 also forms a dimer in solution, and substitution of large hydrophobic residues along the homodimer interface with alanine disrupted dimerization and decreased DNA binding. In addition, to define individual residues in UL44 and UL54 that are crucial for interacting with each other, we have engineered several mutations both in the C-terminal region of UL54 and in the connector loop of UL44. Substitution of alanine for Ile135 in UL44 and for Leu1227 or Phe1231 in UL54 greatly impaired both the UL54/UL44 interaction in pull-down assays and long-chain DNA synthesis, identifying these residues as crucial for subunit interaction. Using isothermal titration calorimetry, we quantitatively measured the binding of peptides corresponding to the extreme C-terminus of UL54 to UL44. We found that a peptide corresponding to last 22 residues of UL54 bound specifically UL44 in a 1:1 complex with a dissociation constant of approximately 0.7 lM, and that substitution at UL44 residue 135 completely abolished binding to the peptide. Thus, the results identify specific side chains that appear to be crucial for UL54/ UL44 interaction. This information and the structure of UL44 may aid in the rational design of new anti-HCMV compounds which act by disrupting the UL44/UL44 or the UL54/UL44 interaction.",

A difference in the HHV-8 seroprevalence was found between the PH patients (3.0%) and the patients without PH (19.0%). Particularly, among the 33 patients with PH , one patient out of 16 with IPAH (6.3%) had serological HHV-8 antibodies, whereas no patient with secondary-PH had HHV-8 antibodies. Among the 42 patients with no clinical or diagnostic evidence of PH, five patients out of 29 with cystic fibrosis (17.2%), and three patients out of 13 with interstitial lung disease (23.1%) had HHV-8 antibodies, all of them affected by idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. No difference in the HHV-8 seroprevalence rate was reported neither in patients with cystic fibrosis nor in patients with interstitial lung disease Conclusions: A 11.5% HHV-8 prevalence rate similar to that found in the Italian general population was reported among candidates to lung transplantation. No relationship between HHV-8 infection and PH, both idiopathic and secondary, was shown. Objectives: Since the discovery of Kaposi sarcoma herpesvirus (KSHV) in 1994, many questions arose about the origin, transmission and pathogenesis of KSHV. The ORF K1 gene is used to define five major subtypes A-E, with 15-30% of amino acid variability. There is not previous reports of ORF K1 Real Time assay. Methods: We analysed the K1 gene phylogenetically in 17 Cuban and 19 German KS tissues (most HIV+) by nested PCR and sequencing. In addition, we studied for the first time-24 PBMC specimens from Cuban asymptomatic sexual contacts of KS patients for the presence of circulating KSHV DNA by Real-Time PCR and also we sequenced those whose results. Moreover, we compared KSHV viral load between PBMC and KS tissues.",

Phylogenetic characterization revealed the majority of German samples belonging to subtypes C (n = 13) and A (n = 6), as has been previously described for European KSHV strains. Cuban samples showed a wide range of subtypes, including A (n = 17.4 were A5), C (n = 7) and B (n = 2), and one newly described subtype E. Subtypes A5 and B have previously been reported as African genotypes and E subtype has been recently found in Amerindians from Brazil and Ecuador. Furthermore, Real-time PCR detected 5 additional patients with very low KSHV viral load in PBMC that were not detectable with nested PCR. The KSHV viral load in KS tissues was much more higher than in PBMC of asymptomatic infected patients, there was also correlation among KSHV antibodies and the two DNA amplification methods. Conclusions: The subtype variability reflects the mixed ethnic background of Cubans. This new DNA amplification assay (Real Time PCR) represents a reliable technique to identify individuals at risk for developing KS lesions as well as following KSHV viral load during therapy.

Plectasin is cidal as demonstrated by MBCs that are equivalent to the MICs and has rapid kill kinetics in time kill experiments. After 24 hours incubation in 90% human serum, Plectasin is stable as measured by both ELISA and antimicrobial activity. Conclusions: Plectasin is a novel antimicrobial peptide that displays potent antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive bacteria including drug resistant organisms. The peptide is rapidly cidal against all Gram-positive bacteria but inactive towards Gram-negative bacteria. Results reported here on serum stability as well as in vivo animal models suggest that Plectasin may have potential as a systemic therapeutic agent against Gram-positive bacteria.",

S. aureus normally produces four PBPs, which are susceptible to modification by b-lactam antibiotics, an event that leads to bacterial death. The gene product of mecA from MRSA is a penicillin-binding protein (PBP) designated PBP2a. PBP2a is refractory to the action of all available b-lactam antibiotics. Furthermore, PBP2a is capable of taking over the functions of the other PBPs of S. aureus in the face of the challenge by b-lactam antibiotics. The basis for resistance of PBP2a to inhibition by blactam antibiotics has been studied by us. These methodologies have been applied to investigations of three cephalosporins from ABRI (Antibiotic Research Institute, Vienna), Sandoz, which were specifically developed for inhibition of PBP2a in MRSA. Methods: The mecA gene was cloned and expressed in E. coli, and PBP2a was purified to homogeneity. Also, synthetic cell wall fragments have been produced for these studies. Results: The kinetic parameters for interactions of typical blactam antibiotics and PBP2a were evaluated. PBP2a manifests resistance to inhibition by available b-lactam antibiotics by attenuation of the microscopic rate constant for acylation (k2) and by elevation of the dissociation constants (Kd). The two factors working in concert result in drug resistance. The ABRI cephalosporins, developed for treatment of MRSA, exhibit lower Kd values and k2/Ks ratios were approximately one to two orders of magnitude higher than those of other b-lactams. We have documented that binding of portions of the cell wall outside of the active site of PBP2a facilitates the opening of the active site (from a closed conformation), such that PBP2a becomes more predisposed to modification by the ABRI antibiotics, manifesting in increases in k2/Ks of over 1000-fold compared to typical b-lactam antibiotics.",

Background: Tolevamer potassium-sodium (tolevamer) is a novel, high molecular weight, non-antibiotic polymer developed to treat Clostridium difficile associated diarrhoea (CDAD). The current form has been modified from an earlier compound, tolevamer sodium, by the addition of potassium to prevent the anionic polymer from exacerbating hypokalemia by binding and excreting intestinal potassium in the stool. Tolevamer sodium was shown to resolve the symptoms of CDAD with similar efficacy as vancomycin in a large Phase 2 study. Tolevamer is currently in Phase 3 development.",

Methods: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-design, multiple dose study consisting of a screening period, a 9 day treatment period and a 1 week follow-up period was conducted. For each dose group, 10 subjects were randomized: 8 to active drug, and 2 to matching placebo. Half the subjects in each dose group received a loading dose (single dose equivalent to a total daily dose) Objectives: N-chlorotaurine (NCT) is a long-lived oxidant produced by human leukocytes during inflammation. Its crystalline sodium salt can be synthetized chemically, and it has broad spectrum antimicrobial activity against bacteria, fungi, and viruses. Because of mild activity and therefore low toxicity NCT is thought to be useful as an antiseptic applicable to different body sites. We performed three clinical phase II studies to evaluate efficacy and tolerability in otitis externa, epidemic keratoconjunctivitis, and chronic leg ulcers with a purulent coating. Methods: Aqueous 1% NCT (55 mM) solution was applied topically for 5-7 days in all three indications. All studies were designed with a randomized test (NCT) and control group (standard medication). The otitis externa and epidemic keratoconjunctivitis study were double-blind. Evaluation was done clinically using a scoring system for subjective and objective symptoms and microbiologically. Results: NCT was well tolerated in all indications, little burning in the eye for a few minutes in few patients like sweat and significantly less burning (P < 0.05) than by chloramine T in purulent crural ulcers were the only side effects. Granulation and re-epithelialization in ulcers appeared earlier in the NCT group (P < 0.05). NCT was equally effective in removal of the purulent coating than the stronger antiseptic chloramine T. The clinical symptoms of external otitis decreased 2 days earlier in the test group than in the control group treated with a combination of polymyxin B, neomycin, and hydrocortisone (P < 0.01).

Using a cold aqueous extraction method, we have obtained a novel extract of allicin (AB1000) that we have reported is stable and highly active in vitro against methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA).Due to national publicity of AB1000, patients with long standing unresolved MRSA infections requested this agent for treatment. MRSA is commonly related to delayed closure for many chronic and acute wounds. This is associated with high levels of bacteria in tissues but they can also through toxin secretion. These toxins can cause local necrosis and disrupt the delicate balance of critical mediators such as cytokines and proteases necessary for healing progression. We present initial findings from three patients who have completed a course of treatment. These courses consisted of capsules (450 mg, 3 per day); spraying liquid AB1000 (1000 lg ml -1 ) onto the affected areas once per day and applying AB1000 Cream (500 lg ml )1 ) to the infected area once daily. Patients were screened, nasal and wound for MRSA prior and during treatment. All patients were nose and wound swab MRSA positive prior to treatment. All were over 60 years of age and had either major surgery or long term skin infections leading to the formation of ulcers infected by MRSA. Two of the MRSA infections were community acquired and one hospital acquired. The strains isolated from each patient were tested in vitro against AB1000 and all were susceptible.Patients reported an improvement in their condition after 2 and 6 weeks treatment and the infections resolved in 3-4 months. Although the timescales required for treatment may be longer than those normally required using antibiotics, the initial relief from weeping ulcers and pain was much quicker. It should be noted these the patients had been receiving unsuccessful treatment with antibiotics for months or years prior to treatment with AB1000. A possible reason for the initial relief from symptoms could relate to the reported activity of garlic extracts to neutralise bacterial exoenzymes in vitro. This could account for the findings that patients got relief from their symptoms before the MRSA were fully removed from the lesion site. Objectives: Targeted recombinant beta-lactamase (TRBL) has been designed to degrade beta-lactam antibiotic residues in the gastrointestinal tract and thereby inhibit the emergence of resistance. In the present study the changes in resistance rates and persistence of different intestinal Escherichia coli strains were followed in beagles during ampicillin treatment with or without TRBL.",

Selected 402 isolates were typed using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) after XbaI restriction of total DNA. Results: Vast genetic heterogeneity, including 25 different PFGE types displaying 19 different resistance patterns, was detected. The beagles harboured on average 5 PFGE types during the study and shared several common clones. Although the number of resistant isolates increased and similar resistance patterns were detected in all treatment groups, no single ampicillin-resistant PFGE type was widely spread between groups. Ampicillin resistance was found in 6 PFGE types and in 9 different combinations of co-resistance. The proportion of resistant isolates (98%, 36% and 28%) and number of dogs (6, 5 and 3) carrying ampicillin-resistant strains during the treatment was higher in AMP group than in AMP/TRBL and PLA groups, respectively. New resistant PFGE types appeared and extensively replaced the previous types in the AMP group but there were 2 cases where a previously susceptible strain acquired resistance during the treatment. In the AMP/TRBL group the slight increase in resistance was due to enrichment of resistant strains in dogs that already carried resistance. In the PLA group new resistant PFGE types appeared but their proportions remained moderate. Conclusions: TRBL seems to inhibit the selection pressure by preserving the genetic diversity of intestinal E. coli populations. Increase in resistance is due to selection of heterogeneous resistant strains rather than emergence of resistance among previously susceptible strains.",

The detection time, Cmax, Tmax, AUC0-infinity and per cent antimicrobial recovered from the beads were calculated. Results: Results are listed in the table as mean \u00b1 standard deviation of three values. No antimicrobial greater than the limit of detection of the assay was present for 2.5% linezolid loaded beads. Elution parameters of linezolid were similar for beads containing 7.5 and 15 % of antimicrobial. Objective: Polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) is used as a local antimicrobial delivery in the treatment and prevention of bone/ joint infection. We developed an in vitro assay to determine release profiles of antimicrobial agents from PMMA. In this study we compared the in vitro release kinetics of daptomycin or vancomycin in a continuous flow chamber with in vivo release in a rat model. Methods: Daptomycin or vancomycin (7.5% w/w) was loaded into the powder component of PMMA; the liquid monomer added and mixed. Antimicrobial loaded PMMA was formed into 3 mm beads and allowed to polymerize for 24 h. The effect of PMMA components and polymerization on the activity of daptomycin or vancomycin was determined by homogenizing loaded beads in 2 ml of Kreb's Ringer buffer and assaying the buffer for antimicrobial activity. In vitro antimicrobial release kinetics were determined by placing a bead in a chamber containing 1 ml of Kreb's Ringer buffer, with 1 ml/h Kreb's Ringer buffer flowing through the chamber. Buffer eluted from the system was collected hourly and assayed for antimicrobic using a bioassay. Each bead/antimicrobial was tested in triplicate. In vivo antimicrobial release kinetics were performed by surgically implanting single beads into bone defects in the proximal left tibia of rats. Three rats with a daptomycin loaded bead and three with a vancomycin loaded bead were sacrificed at 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 14, 18 and 21 d after placement. Bone tissue within 5 mm of the bead was recovered, homogenized in 2 ml Kreb's Ringer buffer, incubated 24 h, and assayed for antimicrobic.

Daptomycin loaded PMMA produced higher antimicrobial concentrations than did vancomycin loaded PMMA in vitro and in vivo. Objective: To compare the pharmacodynamics of daptomycin and vancomycin, killing kinetics of S. aureus were studied in five-day treatment courses over a wide range of ratios of the 24-h area under the curve (AUC) to MIC. Methods: A clinical isolate S. aureus 866 with MIC of daptomycin of 0.35 mg/L and MIC of vancomycin of 0.7 mg/L was exposed to once-daily daptomycin and twice-daily vancomycin for five consecutive days. Mono-exponential concentration-time profiles were simulated with half-lives of 9 h (daptomycin) and 6 h (vancomycin) over a 16-fold range of the AUC/MIC ratio: from 16-256 h. The antimicrobial effect was expressed by its intensity (IE-the area between the control growth curve in the absence of antibiotics and the time-kill/regrowth curve observed in the presence of antibiotic). The cumulative effect of each treatment was determined from time zero to the time the effect no longer could be detected, i.e. the time after the last antibiotic dose at which the number of antibiotic-exposed bacteria reached at least 9 LogCFU/ml. This value was the cutoff level used to determine IE. Results: With both daptomycin and vancomycin, bacterial regrowth followed initial killing over the entire range of the simulated AUC/MIC ratio. Background: The use of glycopeptides for febrile neutropenia has increased, following the prevalence of gram-positive (GP) infections among these patients. Withholding empirical glycopeptide treatment is ecologically wise stipulating that this does not result in increased mortality.

Questions were asked regarding both antimicrobial chemotherapy of choice and antimicrobial prophylaxis in managing febrile neutropenia. Results: Responses were received from 167 (76%) of the 220 haematology units providing care to patients with febrile neutropenia. Febrile neutropenia is empirically treated with piperacillin-tazobactam or carbapenem monotherapy by 10% of haematologists. Overall, dual therapy (i.e., an aminoglycoside plus a piperacillim-tazobactam) is prescribed by 72% of haematologists. When response to initial empirical therapy does not occur after 3-4 days, 32% of haematologists may add glycopetide (vancomycin or teicoplanin) or 29.1% may change to carbapenem and glycopeptide. Forty-eight per cent of haematologists will routinely add conventional amphotericin to the ongoing antibiotics in persistent neutropenia, compared to 39% using liposomal amphotericin. Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor is frequently used as an adjuvant in managing febrile neutropenia (47% of haematologists). For antifungal prophylaxis, fluconazole is prescribed by 57% of haematologist followed by itraconazole by 33%. Forty-seven of haematologists use antifungal prophylaxis in all neutropenic patients compared to 17% whom used antifungals only in patients with neutrophil less than 0.1 \u00b7 109/L. Conclusions: Rationalization of using antimicrobial chemotherapy in the management of febrile neutropenia, by adopting Study selection: RCTs comparing ciprofloxacin with an aminoglycoside as combination therapy to a beta lactam for the treatment of febrile neutropenia and reporting effectiveness, mortality, and/or toxicity data were included in the analysis.

After classic subculture methods, all isolates were characterized at species level by the Api 20 system. Minimal inhibitory concentrations were performed using the semi automated method Microscan according to NCCLS recommendations. All the investigated patients were neutropenic (WBC <1 \u00b7 10 to the power of 9 per liter) with fever (>38\u00b0C) and were under antimicrobial and antifungal therapy at the time of blood culture. Results: Over the two years period (2002) (2003) 586 blood cultures were performed on the basis of the physicians request from 81 patients hospitalized in the two oncology and one hematologist ward of our hospital. The mean length of neutropenia was 13 days. The pathogens were isolated from 64 blood cultures in 21 patients (25%). Among the 22 bacterial strains isolated from bloodstream infections, 72.7% were Gram negative strains (n = 16), 18,1% Gram positive cocci (n = 4), one strain L. monocytogenes and one strain C. kruzei. In the group of Gramnegative strains E. coli was dominant with an increase antibiotic resistance (7/9 resistant to Amoxicillin / Clavulanic acid and 5/9 resistant to Ciprofloxacin). All the Gram-negative rods were highly susceptible to Imipenem (15/16), Meropenem (16/16) and Piperacillin/tazobactam (16/16). In the group of Gram-positive bacteria glycopeptide resistant strains were no found. All the Staphylococci strains were susceptible to Methicillin. Conclusions: We observed rising trends in the number of Gram-negative isolates and in antibiotic resistance of all gramnegative rods. The empiric therapy with wide range antibiotics in febrile neutropenic cancer patients seems to be the optimal option, but the monitoring of antibiotic susceptibility of bacterial strains is still required. Varicella Zoster Virus (VZV) is frequently associated with mild hepatitis and rarely with acute liver failure. Immunologic impairment is a significant predisposing factor. Objectives: We report a 4 years-old girl with Acute Lymphoblatic Leukemia (ALL) and acute fatal liver necrosis after VZV infection. Methods/Results: She was the second child of the family, with a negative history of VZV disease or vaccination. ALL had diagnosed six months ago, the child was treated according to the ALL -BFM 2000 protocol and was then in complete remission. On the time of admission, she was three weeks on dexamethasone (10 mgr/m 2 /day) (re-induction). The child was first admitted in the Hematology/Ongology Department with severe abdominal pain, fever (38\u00b0C) and elevated transaminases. Next day, cutaneous lesions appeared on the chest and face, suggesting VZV infection, and antiviral therapy with acyclovir was immediately initiated. Two days later the patient was transferred to the PICU with severe clinical and laboratory deterioration, high fever, tachypnea with positive chest x-ray (right low lobe consolidation with pleural effusion), abdominal distention, liver enlargement, gross haematuria and GI bleeding, vesicular rash on the chest, face and scalp and generalized petechiae and echymoses. The patient had pancytopenia, marked elevated hepatic enzymes and bilirubin, hypoalbuminemia and severe disseminated intravascular coagulopathy. She was continuously transfused with FFP, RBC, PLT and cryoprecipitate. The child was intubated in hours, because of progressive respiratory and neurological deterioration. Renal failure was developed. Assistance was asked from a liver transplant team and the little girl was urgently transferred to a special department for emergency liver transplantation. Unfortunately, two days after transportation, the child developed deep coma and severe hypotension and died. VZV antibody levels were negative, but VZV DNA was detected from liver biopsy and blood specimen, with PCR. Conclusions: Immunocompromised children are potentially threatened of infections, such as highly contagious chickenpox. The mortality of VZV-induced hepatic failure is very high. Only few patients survived with liver transplantation.",

Objective: Leukocyte count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP) are often obtained on patients with prosthetic joints prior to arthroplasty surgery. We evaluated the value of these parameters for the diagnosis of prosthetic joint infection (PJI). Methods: We prospectively analysed preoperative leukocyte count, ESR and CRP level in patients prior to revision or resection knee or hip arthroplasty at Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN between January 1998 and November 2004. PJI was defined as growth of the same microorganism from at least two specimens, synovial fluid or periprosthetic purulence, acute inflammation on histopathologic evaluation, or the presence of a sinus tract. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive values (PPV) and negative predictive values (NPV) were calculated using 2 \u00b7 2 contingency tables. Results: 231 preoperative blood specimens from 227 patients prior to total knee (n = 192) or hip (n = 37) replacement were analysed. The median age was 70 years (range, 41-101 years); 55% were male. The primary diagnosis was osteoarthritis (n = 209), inflammatory joint disease (n = 13), trauma (n = 8) and osteonecrosis (n = 1). Causative organisms were coagulasenegative staphylococci (n = 26), Staphylococcus aureus (n = 8), enterococci (n = 3), Propionibacterium acnes (n = 3), corynebacteria (n = 3), viridans group streptococci (n = 2), mycobacteria (n = 2) and gram-negative bacilli (n = 2). Three infections were polymicrobial and 12 were culture-negative. 39 patients (61%) had received antimicrobial treatment in the month prior to surgery. Objectives: Neopterin is a sensitive indicator for activation of cell-mediated immune reactions and thus, determination of neopterin concentrations in various body fluids is of diagnostic marker in a variety of infectious diseases in which T lymphocytes and macrophages are involved. Cell mediated immune reactions play important roles in intracellular bacteria such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Brucella species. The aim of this study was to compare the serum neopterin levels in patients with active pulmonary tuberculosis, in patients with brucellosis and healthy subjects. Methods: Thirty-nine patients with active pulmonary tuberculosis ( 10 females, 29 males, mean age: 40.6) 16 patients with brucellosis (7 females, 9 males, mean age: 35.8) and 39 healthy subjects (16 females, 23 males, mean age: 41.2) were included in this study. The patients who had another infection, malignity, autoimmune disease , surgical intervention and recently blood transfusion were not included the study. Serum samples were collected from the patients and control groups and stored at )20\u00b0C until analysed. Neopterin concentrations were measured by ELISA according to the protocol of manufacturer by IBL (Hamburg, Germany). Results: Mean neopterin levels were 18.56 \u00b1 14.23 nmol/L in patients with active pulmonary tuberculosis, 33.82 \u00b1 22.27 nmol/L in patients with brucellosis and 9.87 \u00b1 2.90 nmol/L in healthy subjects, respectively.

Objective: A recently introduced automated generic RNA and DNA extraction system, m1000, enables a throughput of 48 samples in less than 2 hours. Several studies have shown that m1000 is a suitable automated extraction system for many different sample types feeding molecular diagnostics assays. Methods: Unlinked surplus specimens from the clinical routine were used. Cross contamination studies were designed with high titer samples interspersed between negative samples giving a checkerboard pattern on the m1000 subsystem. Diagnostic assays used during these studies were either commercially available or homebrew assays validated for the laboratory routine. Results: No cross-contamination was observed in using HIV RNA of 5-7 log copies/ml, HCV RNA of 5-7 log IU/ml, and polyomavirus DNA of 8 log copies/ml. A total of 437 serum or plasma samples were processed for RNA extraction using LCx HIV or HCV RNA Quantitative assays with 97.6-99.0% agreement to Cobas Amplicor Monitor HIV/HCV assays. Coextraction of HIV/HCV RNA from 28 serum or plasma samples revealed no impairment of LCx assay results when compared to monoextraction. Reaching a 100% agreement between manual and automated extraction on 53 initially positive urine samples on Cobas Amplicor Ct showed the feasibility of extracting bacterial DNA of C. trachomatis with m1000. Genomic DNA extraction from 31 whole blood samples for homebrew HLA-B27 typing revealed a 100% agreement to the manual extraction. Automated extraction of viral DNA of HBV from 25 serum or plasma samples revealed a correlation coefficient of r = 0.96 compared to the manual extraction. 2-7 replicates of HBV quantitation standards were tested with homebrew real-time PCR after automated extraction with excellent linearity and a 100% detection rate of all concentration levels down to 100 IU(ml. Viral DNA has been successfully extracted from spinal fluid, urine, cell culture supernatant, BAL, nasopharyngeal washing, breast milk, biopsy, leukocytes, and bone marrow samples for CMV, HSV, or polyomaviruses JC and BK testing with homebrew real-time PCR (n = 48). Conclusion: Taken together, these studies have shown that m1000 provides a versatile solution for automated extraction of viral RNA or DNA, and bacterial or genomic DNA from 12 different specimen types feeding 8 different molecular diagnostics assays in the field of hepatitis B/C, HIV, sexually transmitted diseases, transplantation, and HLA typing.",

Objectives: The genus Flavivirus comprises more than 70 viruses. Many of them cause severe human diseases. The genome of flavivirus, a single strand RNA molecule with positive polarity, is translated into a large polyprotein that is processed into structural and non-structural proteins by both viral and cellular proteases. The virus-encoded protease is a binary complex constituted by the NS3 protein and its co-factor, NS2B. As the viral protease plays a critical role in the virus replication cycle, it represents one of the main targets for antiviral therapy against members of the Flavivirus genus.The aim of this study was to develop an in vitro assay using the protease of several flaviviruses belonging to different groups in order to characterize their enzymatic properties, such as temperature, pH and salt-sensitivity and substrate specificity. Methods: Sequences encoding the viral proteinase were located on the genome of 8 flaviviruses. NS2B/NS3 proteinase were expressed as hexahistidine-tagged recombinant proteins and then purified by immobilized-metal affinity chromatography. Their enzymatic properties were characterized in vitro using BAPNA, a chromogenic substrate for trypsin-like proteases. Results: The protease moiety of the 8 flaviviruses were successfully produced and purified. 5 of them exhibited activity towards BAPNA. Effect of temperature, ionic strength and pH on enzymatic activity were determined. Our results suggest that the hydrophilic domain of NS2B is necessary for proteolytic activity. Conclusion: The system we developed will allow us to establish a screening test so as to identify or to design inhibitors active as antiviral drugs against one or more pathogenic flaviviruses. The lack of activity of 3 of the 8 proteases we assayed could indicate slight differences in flaviviral proteases' selectivity and activity.",

However, in certain areas of the world, these are not readily available. Storage of specimens on filter paper to be tested later at a centre is an attractive way to confirm a clinical diagnosis or for an epidemiologic study. We performed a pilot study to see if urine spots on filter paper can be used for dengue diagnosis. Methods: Adults and children admitted to King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital suspected of dengue infection were enrolled. Final diagnosis of dengue infection was based on the standard serum ELISA assay. Patients with negative serology served as controls. Urine specimens were collected twice, 5 days to 3 weeks apart, spotted on filter paper and stored at 4 degrees for a minimum of 10 days before testing. RT-nested PCR and ELISA were performed on extracts from the spots. Our ELISA criteria for urine were single IgM > 10 units for primary dengue infection or single IgG > 10 units or 2-fold increase in IgG titer with the second titer >10 units for secondary dengue infection. Results: 139 patients were enrolled. 64 and 71 specimens were analysed by RT-PCR and ELISA, respectively. The results are summarised in the Table: If 3 primary dengue cases were excluded, the sensitivity of ELISA for secondary cases were 84.21%. Conclusions: This is the first study using dried urine samples on filter paper for dengue diagnosis. In this study, fresh urine was spotted onto filter paper in the laboratory, and cross contamination was possible. Realistically, this process would be done on a near-patient basis with vastly lower likelihood of such contamination and thus better results of RT-PCR. Collection of urine is less invasive than that of blood and is especially suitable for children. This method would be highly applicable in epidemiologic studies, such as during dengue outbreaks. Due to a low number of primary cases in an endemic area such as Thailand, a study elsewhere is needed to assess the utility of urine spots in such cases.",

            "text": "A rapid sequencing based prototype assay for detection of high risk HPV strains in cervical samples Background: Human papillomavirus (HPV) is one of the most common causes of sexually transmitted diseases resulting in an estimated 288,000 deaths yearly from cervical cancer worldwide. Of more than 30 types found in the anogenital tract, at least 13 are considered high risk (HR), as they are significantly associated with progression to invasive cervical cancer. In an effort to accommodate high throughput screening for HR HPV types, we recently developed a prototype HPV assay using a Single Base Dye Primer Profiling (SBDPP) approach. In the present study, we evaluate prototype assay performance on 74 patient samples. Objective: To evaluate SBDPP assay for the detection of HR HPV strains in cervical samples. Methods: Genomic DNA purified from 74 retrospective cervical samples was used for this feasibility study. Fifty-four out of 74 were previously typed successfully with the Digene Hybrid Capture\u00e2 2 (HC2) assay. The remaining 20 samples yielded inconclusive results with the HC2 assay. Using consensus PCR primer sequences conserved among HPV types, a fragment of the L1 region was amplified in the presence of an intercalating dye. HPV-positive samples were identified by amplification Ct values and dissociation curve melting profiles, sequenced with a rapid SBDPP protocol and analysed on the ABI PRISM\u00e2 3100 Genetic Analyzer. HR HPV types were identified by their unique single base distribution profiles. In all cases the respective cervical samples were positive for the same HPV type. The HPV detection concordance was 14/21 (66.7%). The HPV detection concordance was better in histological diagnoses of cancer and high-grade lesions compared to low-grade lesions. The sensitivity of HPV detection in urine was similar to that in distilled water.",

High HPV type-specific concordance between cervical and urine samples and good sensitivity of urine detection are reported. Only specimens with two or more epithelial cells in 400 \u00b7 magnification are worth processing with the more expensive HPV detection method. This report supports the possibility that self-testing for HPV, using urine, will one day give to low-income groups and specific populations like young adolescents a good screening alternative. Objectives: Several diagnostic tests for the detection of SARS antibodies from serum have been previously evaluated, including ELISA and IIFT assays. This study evaluated a novel protein chip assay, the Coronavirus Protein Microarray (CoV-PM), that has been developed for the detection of antibodies to multiple coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV, comparing it to the currently accepted commercially available gold standard assay, the EUROIMMUN SARS-CoV IgG Indirect Immunofluorescence test (IIFT). Methods: The CoV-PM comprised of all the SARS-CoV proteins and protein fragments, along with proteins from 5 additional coronaviruses that infect human, cats, mice and cows. The arrays were used to probe a selection of 399 previously validated, challenge samples of human sera for antibodies to SARS-CoV that included samples from the same patients from different dates. These sera included 40 SARS-CoV IgG-negatives (neg) from acute SARS cases (ACUT), 164 SARS-CoV IgG positive (pos) from convalescent cases (CONV), 112 SARS-CoVneg from patients with other respiratory illness (RESP), and 84 from healthcare workers (HCW; 17 SARS-CoV IgG pos; 66 neg). Each grid on the CoV-PM was probed with 1 lL serum/patient, reacted with fluorescently labeled antibodies and signals were detected using a standard microarray scanner. Scans were analysed by two readers using a programme developed to predict the nature of each serum. Results: Of the 181 SARS-CoV-pos sera, 168 were read as positive by CoV-PM by both readers (93.3% sensitivity), while 8 CONV sera were read as CoV-PM pos by one reader but not by the other, whereas 16 and 7 were called neg and inconclusive by both readers. Interestingly, in the majority of cases, SARS-CoV pos sera that tested discrepant by CoV-PM were CoV-PM pos in other samples from the same patients from later dates. 64 HCW, 40 ACU and 100 RESP from 218 SARS-CoV-neg sera were CoV-PM-neg (specificity 99.1%), with SARS-CoV antibodies found in 1 HCW and 1 RESP while 2 others were inconclusive. Some of the SARS-CoV pos sera also reacted with 229E proteins, suggesting concurrent or prior infection with this coronavirus; some sera within this selection tested positive for 229E/OC43 by Western blot assay.",

            "text": "Conclusions: The CoV-PM appears to be a sensitive and specific method for the detection of SARS-CoV antibodies from serum. The added value of its ability to detect antibodies to other coronaviruses requires further evaluation. The prevalence of respiratory viruses in hospitalised patients is rather unclear. Due to the rather large effort of reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR methods, the poor sample quality of many specimens and the sensitivity of most rapid antigen detection tests, many viruses are not diagnosed. With nucleic acid tetection methods there is also question, whether there are acute replicating viruses or residual genetic material detected. In this presentation we describe our results from a study using a combined cell culture/PCR method suitable for detection of productive infection of different respiratory viruses. By cultivation of a total of 266 nasopharyngeal secretions and bronchioalveolar lavages (BAL) from children hospitalized in the local paediatrics department and from adult transplant patients on HEp-2 human larynx epithelial and MA-104 monkey kidney cells we were able to detect also slow growing viruses like human metapneumovirus (HMPV). The method was also able to detect Parainfluenza Virus or Rhinoviruses and to a certain extent Adenoviruses. Additionally Influenzaviruses, Respiratory-Syncytial Virus (RSV) and Adenoviruses were detected by commercial antigen detection assays. The epidemiology of respiratory viruses in Western Austria for the winter season 2003/04 reveals a Parainfluenza 1 outbreak as confirmed by sequencing right before the main Flu season, a relatively weak RSV season and many of HMPV isolations with some double infections as indicated below. Additionally the samples were also tested for 'exotic'agents like Mimiviridae. Mimiviruses are a new species which has been described most recently in water amoeba and their nearest relatives appear to be aquatic Phycodnaviruses. As replication of Mimivirus similar to the Leginella spp., which also replicate in amoeba, has been suggested to occur also in alveolar cells of humans we decided to test our patient samples using a 'suicide-PCR' protocol.",

The aim of our study was to detect intrathecal synthesis of specific IgG antibodies against varicella zoster virus in patients with idiopathic facial nerve palsy and to evaluate the importance of this examination for establishing the etiology of this disease and subsequent treatment. Methods: We investigated a cohort of 30 patients: 15 patients were diagnosed as idiopathic facial nerve palsy and 15 patients were diagnosed as neuroborreliosis (NB) with facial nerve palsy as a part of their clinical symptoms. Serum and CSF samples were analysed at each patient. We used the diagnostic kit of Human Company, Germany (Varicella-Zoster Virus Human ELISA IgG Antibody Test) and the diagnostic kit of Test-Line Company, Clinical Diagnostics, Czech Republic (EIA Borrelia garinii IgG) for the detection of specific IgG antibodies. The intrathecal synthesis was evaluated as specific antibody index -AI according to Reibe\u0155s method. Results: Intrathecal synthesis of IgG antibodies against varicella zoster virus was detected in 20% patients with idiopathic facial nerve palsy. All these patients had negative intrathecal antiborrelia antibody synthesis. In the NB subgroup all patients had negative intrathecal antibody synthesis against varicella zoster virus. The statistical significance of specific antibody intrathecal synthesis was confirmed by Spearman rank coefficient and Wilcoxon test. Conclusion: Our statistically supported data emphasize the importance of intrathecal synthesis of specific antibodies as a diagnostic method in patients with idiopathic facial nerve palsy. It reveals a subgroup of patients with viral ethiology who can thus profit from specific antiviral treatment. Methods: The panels were prepared in a pool of CSF specimens. Each panel consisted of 10 coded specimens: 4 negative specimens, 1 specimen containing cytomegalovirus (CMV), 3 specimens containing HSV type 1 at a concentration of 4.102 , 7.5, 102 and 3.75. 103 TCID50/ml on Vero cells and 2 specimens containing HSV type 2 at a concentration of 4.102 and 4.103 TCID50/ml. One specimen (containing HSV type1 at a concentration of 7.5. 102 TCID50/ml) was artificially inhibited by the addition of fraxiparine at a concentration of 356 U/ml.

Patient 2 (2.6 years) had CMV in liver (30.6), and was negative for the three herpesviruses in larynx and lung. Patient 3 (2 years) had EBV in amygdale (28.5), and CMV in amygdale (49.3) and kidney (34.3). Patients 4 (3 months) and 5 (a newborn) were negative for the three herpesviruses in lung.

Four different repeats of the experiment were performed, giving results for 1:100 dilutions of eight strains with 0 (control), 40, 20, 10, 5 lg/ ml vancomycin (1 set), 0, 8, 4, 2, 1 lg/ml (2 sets) and 0, 5, 4, 3, 2 lg/ml (1 set). Each set comprised of eight replicates of each condition. The plates were then incubated at 36\u00b0C for 20 hours before the wells were emptied by pipette, washed three times in 200 ll phosphate-buffered saline and air dried. They were then stained with 0.4% crystal violet solution for ten minutes before rinsing under gently running water. Biofilm density was measured as the optical density at 450 nm (OD > 0.12 taken as positive). Repeats of the same condition were combined by expressing the results as a multiple of the control condition. Statistical significance was assessed using the Mann-Whitney test (p < 0.5 taken as significant). Results: Five of the eight strains showed statistically significant increases in biofilm density in the presence of low vancomycin concentrations, resulting in biofilm-positive results in 95% of wells (see table) .",

Biofilm formation and resistance to multiple antibiotics are the major obstacles for a successful treatment. The aim of the study was to test Staphylococcus epidermidis isolates from patients with verified foreign body infections i) for their ability to form biofims and ii) for their susceptibility to 12 standard antibiotics, and compare these to 'wild type' Staphylococcus epidermidis isolated from the skin of healthy volunteers. Methods: Sixty patients with verified FBI were evaluated. Hundred and twenty-nine blood culture isolates from 60 patients with FBI, and 52-skin isolates from healthy, not hospital-associated, volunteers were analysed. Identification of Staphylococcus epidermidis was done using routine methods. To exclude doubles FBI isolates were genotyped by PFGE. The susceptibility testing was done using disk diffusion method according to the NCCLS. Antimicrobial agents tested were penicillin, oxacillin, erythromycin, clindamycin, gentamicin, amikacin, vancomycin, fosfomycin, fusidic acid, rifampicin, ciprofloxacin, trimethoprim and linezolid. Biofilm formation was tested using a microtiter plate biofilm model. Clinical Microbiology and Infection, Volume 11, Supplement 2, 2005 significant). More than 30% of all FBI strains were resistant to penicillin, oxacillin, erythromycin, clindamycin, ciprofloxacin and trimethoprim. The 52 'wild type' Staphylococcus epidermidis were generally more susceptible than the clinical isolates (p < 0.05): However, 46.2 % of these controls were resistant to penicillin and to erythromycin, 17.3% were resistant to clindamycin.",

Objectives: Biofilm expression in Staphylococcus epidermidis is a major virulence factor and attachment to polymeric surfaces leads to reduced susceptibility against antimicrobial substances. The alternative sigma factor SigmaB is an important regulator of biofilm formation in S. epidermidis. However, biofilm formation is under influence of additional yet uncharacterized regulators, which were examined in this study. Methods: The Tn917 insertion of the biofilm-negative mutant M12 generated in the biofilm-positive genetic background of S. epidermidis 1457 was identified by arbitrary PCR. The transcription of the icaADBC locus, essential for biofilm formation as well as of the inactivated genes was investigated. The function of the inactivated genes was characterized by complementation studies under different environmental conditions. Results: In M12 Tn917 was inserted at the distal end of an orf homologous to the regulatory gene purR in Bacillus subtilis. The gene upstream of purR is conserved between S. epidermidis, B. subtilis, and S. aureus furthermore two additional orfs (orf3 and orf4) homologous to B. subtilis, and S. aureus are located downstream of the Tn917 insertion site. Within the purR genes of S. epidermidis, B. subtilis, and S. aureus a highly conserved motif homologous to the consensus sequence for SigmaB dependent promoters was identified upstream of Tn917. The SigmaB dependent transcription of the orf3 and orf4 could be demonstrated in mutants with inactivation of sigB. In M12 transcription of the biofilm associated genes icaADBC was abolished, whereas the transcription of their negative regulatory gene icaR was unaffected. Complementation with the single genes showed no effect in M12, whereas complementation of M12 with orf3 and orf4 together was able to restore biofilm formation under high osmotic conditions. Interestingly, under standard conditions used for biofilm formation as well as under biofilm induction with subinhibitory concentrations of ethanol no biofilm formation was observed in the complemented mutant.",

Relative expression levels of RNAIII and sarA are higher in planktonic than in sessile bacteria.

In vivo, expression of all genes reaches a peak level between 1 and 2 h after implantation (0.5-1.5 log 10 times the expression level at implantation) and subsequently decreases towards its lowest level at 6 h. For agrA, expression remains stable during the whole observation period; expression of RNAIII and sarA decreases and remains thereafter at a very low level. SigB expression remains at a high level for the whole observation period, whereas expression of rsbV and rsbU increases. RsbU is expressed to a significantly higher degree than the other sigB operon genes.

Chemotherapy of such infections is seldom fully effective, due to high biofilm resistance. A number of alternative approaches to antimicrobial treatment have been proposed. The aim was to study the activity of antibiotics in monotherapy or in combination with lysostaphin, towards S. aureus biofilm. Methods: S. aureus: ATCC29213 (MSSA), A3 (clinical MRSA), 1474/01 (clinical hVISA), were used as planktonic cultures or 24hour-old biofilm built in the wells of microplate, in the chambers of a LabTekII chamber slide or on the polyethylene catheter. MICs of linezolid, vancomycin, oxacillin and lysostaphin for planktonic bacteria were determined according to the standards of NCCLS. BIC/BEC (Biofilm Inhibitory/Eradicating Concentration) were estimated by the MTT assay measuring active metabolism of bacteria that survived a single or cyclical dose of antimicrobials (antibiotic alone or in combination with subMIC lysostaphin given earlier or together with antibiotic). The integrity of biofilm treated with antimicrobials was also examined: in catheter study: visually by TTC reduction assay, in chambers of a LabTekII chamber slide: by staining with FITC and confocal fluorescence microscopy. Results: We have demonstrated the effectiveness of lysostaphin in the treatment (3-24 hours) of biofilm built not only on the flat surface (wells of microplate, chambers of a LabTekII chamber slide) but also on catheter extra-and intraluminal surfaces. MIC/BIC of lysostaphin were 0.25, 8/16 mg/L for MSSA and MRSA, 0.06, 4/8 mg/L for hVISA, respectively. The synergistic effect of subMIC lysostaphin + oxacillin was observed for MSSA and MRSA biofilms (BICoxa/Lin dropped after 24 h from >128 to <4 mg/L) but such effect was not demonstrated for hVISA strain (BICOxa was still >128 mg/L). SubMIC lysostaphin +linezolid or + vancomycin, given as 3 cycles therapy, were effective in disruption of MSSA, MRSA, hVISA or MSSA and MRSA biofilms, respectively. Thus, lysostaphin in combination with antibiotics, was effective in preventing the biofilm rebuilding (BEC) in experiments lasting 5 days.",

SLUC segments without biofilms were used as control. To study the outer membrane proteins (OMPs) of bacterial biofilms, cells were disrupted by sonication (40 kHz, two minutes in a sonication water bath) and OMPs were isolated as sodium-lauryl sarcosynate insoluble material and the proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE.

Methods: A combination of two genomic typing systems, the minisatellite-primed PCR (MSP-PCR) and the enterobacterial repetitive consensus sequence PCR (ERIC-PCR), was used to discriminate the 96 strains collected at a Portuguese Central Hospital and isolated from 5 different sources. The data was analysed using BioNumerics software. Bacterial adhesion to polystyrene (PS2h) and initial biofilm formation (PS6h) were studied by growing bacteria in LB in a modified microtiter-plate assay. Strains were screened for their capacity to adhere to hydrophobic biomaterials such as silicone and hexadecane (CSH) using a biphasic separation method. The opportunistic P.aeruginosa were also screened for their capacity to swim (flagella) and twitch (pili). All tests were run in triplicate. Results: Our combined genotypic and phenotypic analysis revealed extensive diversity in all the parameters within CLs of P. aeruginosa strains and no significant differences among CLs. However, small clusters of strains with relatively high PS2h and PS6h abilities can be found; one specific group containing 2 strains of CL1 (similarity 70%) are worth mentioning; a group of 2 strains from CL7 (similarity 60%) had low PS2h and PS6h abilities. Positive correlations (Spearman's) were observed between PS2h and PS6h (0.748, P < 0.01), between PS2h and CSH (0.233, P < 0.05), between PS6h and CSH (0.228, P < 0.05) and between PS6h and twitching (0.220, P < 0.01). The strain with highest adhesion value was one of the most efficient initial biofilm producer and other strain had the same behavior but had the lowest value. The strain with highest CSH was also one of the most efficient in adhesion to silicone and the strain with lowest adhesion was the same for the two parameters. Conclusion: Our results suggest extensive diversity, namely by wide variations in virulence parameters among strains within a CL and no significant differences between CLs in all the virulence parameters. These results also suggest the importance of hydrophobicity in adhesion ability to abiotic surfaces, the importance of twitching in biofilm formation and the correlation between PS2h and PS6h ability.

This recalcitrance could be due to selfaggregation and bacterial adherence to different substrata, generation of a protecting exopolysaccharidic mathrix limiting the antibiotic diffusion in the biofilm, underexpression of porins, overexpression of multidrug resistance pumps, the presence of persisters that survive in the presence of an antibiotic that inhibits their growth. For highlighting some of the abovementioned factors, we have investigated the antibiotic resistance levels of P. aeruginosa planktonic cells comparatively with cells growing in biofilms developed on central venous catheter pieces imersed in nutrient broth (original experimental model) or included in agar mimicking the biofilm mathrix.",

Moreover the majority of E. cloacae strains isolated from patients with HAP, hospitalized at ICUs showed resistance to ceftazidime. The aim of our study was the examination of virulence properties like: adherence to human cell line and forming biofilm of 15 strains of E. cloacae isolated from patients (infection or colonisation) and of 11 strains isolated from the body surface of German cockroaches collected in hospitals. The examination of ability to adherence to human cell line (Hep-2) was done according Knutton et al. method. Three patterns of adhesion were observed: A. aggregative; B. localized and C. diffuse adhesion. Moreover determination of activity of 3 selected chemical disinfectant to bacteria growing as a planctonic form (by evaluation MICs) and growing as a biofilm on catheter (effectiveness of working solution) was done. Patterns of adhesion to Hep-2 cell line varied among tested strains. The aggregative adhesion was observed among 2 strains of E. cloacae colonising patients and one isolated from infections. No one of 11 E. cloacae strains isolated from the surface of cockroaches showed this pattern of adhesion. According to statistical analysis the significant number of E.cloacae strains isolated from cockroaches presented lack of adhesion to Hep-2 cell line or diffuse adhesion in comparison to strains collected from patients. Totally 65% E. cloacae strains showed mannose-sensitive mechanism of adherence to Hep-2 cell line (71% of strains from the colonised patients, 62.5% of strains that caused infection and 63.6% of strains from the surface of cockroaches). 27% of the strains showed stronger adhesion in presence of mannose. Only one E. cloacae strain did not form the biofilm on catheter. The majority of tested strains growing 5 days on catheter were resistant to working solution of potassium persulfate, glucoprotamin and sodium dichloroisocyjanurate. However, E. cloacae strains that caused infection were the only resistant to all 3 disinfectants working solution, even if the MIC values were similar to the MICs of these strains from patient colonisation or from cockroaches.

The wildtype and mutant were tagged chromosomally with fluorescent markers and grown in continuous flowcell systems to characterize their biofilm formation using confocal laser scanning microscopy. Results: The wildtype stain was found to form thick irregularly shaped biofilms. The biofilms mainly consisted of loose clusters of bacteria, up to 40 lm thick. Although the biofilm covered most of the substratum, open areas were also present within and between the bacterial clusters. The non-capsulated mutant was also able to form biofilms; however the architecture differed from that of the wildtype. The non-capsulated mutant spread as a confluent thin layer of cells covering the substratum. The vast majority of the biofilm was less than 5 lm thick, and only occasionally thicker bacterial clusters resembling the wildtype biofilm phenotype were observed. Conclusions: K. pneumoniae cells are able to form thick biofilms when grown in continuous flow systems. The polysaccharide capsule was not found to be essential for biofilm formation per se but its absence significantly affected biofilm development and architecture. Future studies may reveal the influence of capsules on biofilm resistance against host defence systems and actions of antibiotics.

Influence of capsule on ability of the biofilm formation was estimated using uncapsulated mutants and their capsulated variants. In the investigations the urinary catheters-polyvinyl chloride Nelaton, latex Foley, all-silicone Foley and venous catheter-polyurethan Cavafix were tested.

Biofilm formation was measured using a polystyrene plate assay and media supplemented with oligosaccharides. The expression of genes was measured by real-time PCR and the locus was sequenced. Homology was assessed using BLAST and related programmes. Results: The genetic locus identified by us is also involved in maltose uptake and metabolism. The expression of genes in this locus is regulated by maltose and glucose in the growth medium indicating that nutritional oligosaccharides may promote or inhibit biofilm formation. While the wild-type strain was able to produce biofilm in medium containing either glucose or maltose, two mutants (one transposon mutant and one deletion mutant) showed opposite effects. A transposon mutant showed a reduced biofilm formation when grown in medium containing 1% glucose while a deletion mutant produced more biofilm when grown in glucose, but was unable to form biofilm when maltose was added to the growth medium. The sugar-binding transcriptional regulator bopD seems to bind to an operator upstream of the bop locus and a consensus binding sequence shown to bind to the maltose repressor MalR is present in the non-coding region upstream of bopA.",

Additionally, they are the primary cause of necrotizing fasciitis. The objective of this study was to evaluate the ability to form biofilms and the morphology of these biofilms produced by GAS isolated from blood of patients with sepsis and from the tissue of patients with necrotizing fasciitis. Methods: Twenty-six GAS isolates from blood cultures of patients with sepsis and bacteraemia, and 26 isolates from tissue of patients with necrotizing cellulitis and fasciitis were collected. They were isolated and identified using routine methods, and frozen at -73\u00b0C in BHI broth with 3% glycerol. To test their ability to form biofilms, the isolates were grown in microtiter plates in tryptone soya broth for 24 or 48 hours. To examine the morphology of the biofilm formation the isolates were either examined unfixed or fixed with 2% glutaraldehyd using electrone microscope scanning (Philips XL30 ESEM). For quantification they were fixed with 2% glutaraldehyd and dyed with 1% crystal violet to measure the mean optical density (OD using a routine microtiter-plate-reader at 550 nm wavelength. To calculate differences in the frequency in the groups the Fisher's exact test and to calculated differences in the OD the Mann-WhitneyU-Test were used. Results: Seventeen out of 26 isolates from patients with sepsis and 14 out of 26 isolates fom patients with necrotizing fasciitis formed biofilms (difference not significant). Scanning electron studies confirmed biofilm formation however it looked somewhat scarce in isolates from necrotizing fasciitis. For the biofilm forming isolates, the OD of isolates from sepsis were significantly higher than the OD of isolates from necrotizing fasciitis (0.996 versus 0.578, p < 0.001).",

            "text": "Objectives: Microorganisms tend to form biofilms consisting of cells embedded in a highly hydrated, extracellular polymeric matrix. Biofilms may be responsible for a wide variety of nosocomial infections. Sources of biofilm-related infections can include the surfaces of catheters, medical implants, dental unit water lines or other types of devices, as well as cooling towers, shower heads. The biofilm protects its inhabitants from antimicrobial agents, pH alterations, and confers protection against desiccation. It is possible to encounter desiccation in natural or man-made environments through evaporation, flowing-off or system shutdown. However biofilm-associated bacteria can survive for a while in the absence of water within systems. In this study the survival of heterotrophic bacteria, sulphate reducing bacteria (SRB) and amoeba were evaluated against short time desiccation. Methods: Biofilms were allowed to grow for 30 and 60 days on stainless steel coupons. For the desiccation experiment, coupons were taken out from the reactor and left air-dried. Desiccated cells were rehydrated in 10 ml of sterile phosphate buffer after 6, 24, 48, 72, 96, 168 hours and biofilm were removed from coupons. For enumeration of heterotrophic bacterial count, samples are plated on R2A agar for 10 days at 27\u00b0C. Postgate medium B was used for SRB cultures. For amoeba isolation biofilm homogenates were spread on non-nutrient agar plate overlaid with Eschericha coli. Results: After 72 h of desiccation of 30 d old biofilm, SRB growth was seen while no heterotrophic bacterial growth was observed. Whereas on 60 d old biofilm, heterotrophic bacterial growth was observed after 96 h, however SRB growth was seen after 168 h. No significant differences were found between zero time and 24 h counts regarding heterotrophic bacteria. Discussion: Heterotrophic bacteria are located at the biofilmwater interface; whereas anaerobic bacteria niched in the deeper layers of the biofilm. The ability of some pathogenic bacteria to survive within the cysts of amoebas is suggested as a possible mechanism by which the organism evades disinfection and spreads to colonize new environments. Bacterial resistance to desiccation has been reported frequently, but the maximal tolerance of microorganisms in the air-dried state is still unknown. The study showed that diurnal absence of water could not affect biofilm-associated microorganisms significantly.",

A mixture of six oral streptococci (S. mutans, S. mitis, S. oralis, S. sanguis, S. salivarius and S. sobrinus) was investigated to generate biofilms over a period of four days.Eight slabs each (with the adhering biofilms) were treated with one of the following solutions for one minute: a) Saline (0.9%, negative control), b) 0.2% chlorhexidine digluconate (CHX, positive control), c) 0.1% sodium benzoate (SB), d) 0.1% potassium sorbate (PS) and e) 0.06 sodium nitrite (SN). After treatment four slabs each were washed in saline and a vital-dead staining was conducted on the adhering biofilms. The slabs were then analysed in situ for biofilm thickness and vitality using confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM).From the other four slabs biofilms were dispersed in saline and the colony forming units (CFUs) on Columbia blood agar as well as total bacterial counts using DAPI-staining were determined. Results: The biofilm thickness of the different tested BES was between 12.3 and 35.8 lm in average. The vitality of the negative control was determined to be 86.14 \u00b1 4.6% and 37.27 \u00b1 8.11% for positive control. For sodium benzoate and potassium sorbate a vitality of 74.39 \u00b1 8.08% and 71.11 \u00b1 6.93% was measured, respectively. The treatment with sodium nitrite led to a vitality of 66.73 \u00b1 6.36%.The mean log 10 CFUs of untreated biofilm was determined to be 7.83 \u00b1 0.14 and 7.28 \u00b1 0.33 for the biofilm treated with CHX. After treatment with SB and PS the mean log 10 CFUs was 7.20 \u00b1 0.20 and 6.98 \u00b1 0.24, respectively. For biofilm treated with SN a mean log 10 CFUs was determined to be 7.12 \u00b1 0.40. The plating efficiency was determined as followed: 56. Chronic infections caused by biofilm-forming staphylococci represent serious medical problem. Their higher prevalence now-adays is associated with more frequent use of artificial implants and medical devices. Surface of these implants facilitates adhesion of bacteria, which than form biofilm. The knowledge of biofilm formation dynamics is fundamental for the understanding of processes running in the biofilm layer. The aim of this study was to determine with mathematical models the differences in biofilm formation in different conditions and to determine the minimum time and conditions necessary for the development of the homogenous and matured biofilm layer suitable for the antibiotic testing. The Staphylococcus epidermidis biofilm-positive strains were used in this study. As the positive control, strain CCM 7221 was used. The biofilm was grown on tissue culture microtiter plates. The strains were cultivated in different concentrations of glucose and at different temperatures. Each strain was cultivated simultaneously in 4 wells. In the first 48 hrs the data were collected every hour, than up to 96 hrs every 6 hrs. After cultivation the wells of microtiter plates were stained with crystal violet and the biofilm formation was assessed spectrophotometrically. Data were processed with the Multiple Analysis of Covariance (MANCOVA) and mathematical models were evaluated with Regression Analysis. For the image analysis and visualisation of the biofilm in different stages of formation, specific dyes (alcian blue, acridin orange, Rylux etc.) were also used. All tested strains showed better growth of the biofilm at the temperature of 37\u00b0C in the nutrientricher environment. The model can be simply described as follows: the first signs of bacterial adhesion were visible after 2-4 hrs of cultivation, the first homogenous but a very thin layer was visible after 5 hrs, after 7 hrs the biofilm layer was cca 3-times thicker. After 10 hrs the biofilm layer seemed to be mature-the changes in the thickness were not so evident after this time. After the cultivation longer than 34-42 hrs the parts of the biofilm layer started to detach, so the biofilm became unhomogenous. In the regression modelling, other nutrient and temperature conditions showed also different influence on the formation of biofilm. For the antibiotic testing, the biofilm cultivation for 12 hrs should be sufficient. Objective: Biliary stenting is a common treatment for the palliation of malignant obstructive jaundice. However, stent occlusion due to sludge adhesion remains an important clinical problem. For more understanding of the mechanism of such occlusion, the present work dealt with studying the bacteriological characteristics of bile samples. Methods: Taken from 40 patients with extra hepatic cholestasis before biliary decompression(group1). Also,bile samples and sludge material from13 patients presenting with recurrent jaundice due to late stent blockage (group2), were processed for microbiological and transmission electron microscopic study (TEM). Bacteriological analysis included isolation and identification of various bacterial species as well as detection of Bglucouronidase and several esterase activities (19enzymes)of the isolated species.",

The TEM examination of sludge material (group2) revealed the presence of clusters of Gram negative bacteria embedded in an amorphous matrix. The visualized microcolonies of bacterial growth were confined to the same morophotype for each case. Bacteriological analysis confirmed the TEM results and showed that the most frequent isolated species were Escherichia coli(E.coli) (41.6%), Samonella arizona (S. arizona) (25%) Klebsiella species (16.6%) and Enterobocter(8.3%) Although S. arizona isolated from blockage stents were the most abundant producers (14 out of 19) and they elaborated 4 out of 5 such enzymes, yet they recorded the longest patency duration among the blocked tudied stents. By TEM it was noticed that the biofilm matrix changed according to the type of bacteria detected. The biofilm matrix in S. arizona cases was shown to be fenestrated. It looked thick and more etectron dense when compared to the matrix of E. coli cases. The latter showed a clealr thin matrix, more electron lucent and detected fibres were mostly thin. Conclusion: The present work confirms the pivotal role of Gram negative bacteria in stent blockage therefore antibiotics against Gram negative bacteria are mandatory 24 hours before endoscopic retrogade cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). Also, the current study highlights the relation between the type of microorganism and the morphology of the formed biofilm matrix which may be an important underlying factor in stent blockage and its duration of patency.",

We describe this medical problem in a 57-yr old alcoholic man who had a biliary stent inserted because of intra-and extrahepatic bile stasis, probably caused by a cystic process in the pancreatic head that blocked the flow. Methods: A 7 cm long teflon coated polyurethane biliary stent was inserted endoscopically in the common bile duct. Antibiotic prophylaxis or treatment was not used and the patient was discharged in healthy condition after 5 days. Results: Two weeks after insertion of the biliary stent the patient was readmitted with sepsis, severe abdominal pain and increasing liver enzymes. Ultrasound scan revealed intrahepatic bile stasis, a large inflamed abscess in the pancreatic head, a fistula between the abscess and the common bile duct and blockage of the lumen of the stent. The stent was replaced by two 10 cm long stents. The patient was treated with ampicillin, metronidazole and gentamicin for only 3 days. Ampicillin susceptible E. coli were cultured from the blood. After 5 days the patient was discharged in healthy condition. Three weeks after the second stents were inserted the patient was admitted emergently with septic shock and treated with ceftriaxone, netilmicin and metronidazole. After 12 hours of intensive treatment the patient died. E. coli and K. oxytoca were cultured from the blood, pancreas, and the stents. Pulsed-field-gelelectrophoresis was performed and the E. coli cultured during the two septic episodes had the same pattern.

If the ACA was negative, a new QIA extract was made from which both PCR assays were redone. If the ACA and the RSA were negative, the RNA was presumed degraded and the sample excluded from the study. Results: The QIA-ACA detected SARS-CoV in 79 of 296 samples, whereas the MP-RSA detected SARS-CoV in only 32 of these samples. The MP-RSA did not detect any SARS-CoV in the 190 QIA-ACA SARS-negative samples. ACA detected SARS-CoV in 27 of 47 discrepant MP-RSA-negative/QIA-ACA-positive samples. The 20 remaining samples that were MP-ACA-negative were re-extracted by QIA from the initial homogenate and retested. 15 of these 20 new extracts were ACA positive and 5 that were ACAnegative were excluded from the study as the samples were presumed to be degraded. On retesting these with the RSA, only 4 of the 15 were found to be SARS-CoV-positive. Conclusion: In comparison to the QIA-ACA, the MP-RSA was substantially less sensitive, detecting SARS-CoV in only 46% of the tissue samples from confirmed SARS cases. The specificity of the combined assays was 100%. The lack of RSA sensitivity may be due to evolutionary mutations",

Among 88 new MRSA positive individuals in period B, 48 persons had throat swabs taken. 23 (47.9%) grew MRSA in throat combined with other sites. Five (10.4%) grew MRSA in throat only. Among 50 persons examined with perineum swabs, only 12 (24.0 %) were positive combined with other MRSA positive locations, but none were MRSA positive in perineum only. Discussion: In the last eight years, we have experienced a 70fold increase in new MRSA positive patients in Central Norway. Many outbreaks have not been thoroughly cleared because of wrong examination sites. Based on the finding of MRSA positive swabs from 5 persons from throat and none from perineum as the only location for MRSA, we conclude that throat swabs must be a part of routine MRSA screening.P1377 Evaluation of oxoid mannitol salt agar with cefoxitin for the detection of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus from surveillance specimens B.M.

TIG (GAR-936) is a parenteral investigational glycylcyline derivative of minocycline with a wide spectrum of activity including MRSA. We examined the inhibitory and bactericidal activity of DAP, TIG, TEI, and VAN against CA-MRSA and MDR-MRSA. Methods: One-hundred clinical stains of CA-MRSA and Fifty-Five MDR-MRSA (Resistant to at least four antimicrobials including oxacillin) defined by CDC definition and SCCmec type were evaluated. ATCC 29213 was used as a control. Molecular methods were used to determine SCCmec type and the presence of PVL and mecA gene. Minimum inhibitory concentrations and minimum bactericidal concentrations were performed per NCCLS. Bactericidal activity was evaluated using time kill experiments using two randomly selected strains from each group. Results: MIC50 (Range) of 100 CA-MRSA (SCCmec IV. For CA-MRSA the MBC ranged for DAP:0.12-1.0, TIG:0.12-16.0, TEI:0.25-4.0, VAN:0.25-4.0. MIC50 (Range) of 55 MDR-MRSA (Sccmec II) for DAP: 0.50(0.25-2.0), TIG: 0.25(0.06-1.0), TEI: 1.0(0.25-4.0) and VAN: 2.0(0.5-4.0). For MDR-MRSA the MBC ranged for DAP:0.25-2.0, TIG:0.25-16, TEI:0.5-4.0, VAN:1.0-4.0. Overall TIG and DAP exhibited low MIC against all 155 strains. Time kill experiments demonstrated that DAP = VAN > TIG = TEI (P < 0.05) against CA-MRSA. FOR MDR-MRSA DAP > VAN > TEI > TIG. DAP achieved 99.9% kill as early as 4 h against all strains. Conclusions: Given the limited therapeutic options for serious CA-MRSA and MDR-MRSA infections, DAP and TIG may offer additional options as they demonstrated good activity against clinical strains of CA-MRSA and MDR-MRSA. Against all isolates, 99.9% kill was achieved as early as 4 h for DAP against all isolates and TIG achieved > 2 log10 CFU/ml kill. Further investigations are warranted.

Obriadina (Nizhniy Novgorod, RUS)Background: Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpes virus (or human herpes virus type 8 HHV-8) is a recently discovered gamma-herpesvirus associated with 4 clinical and epidemiological variants of Kaposi sarcoma (classic, endemic, iatrogenic, and acquired immunodeficiency virus-associated), primary effusion lymphoma and multicentric Castleman's disease. Objective: The aim of this study was to learn the antigenic properties of new recombinant mosaic protein and to develop and evaluate a screening enzyme immunoassay (EIA) for the detection of anti HHV-8 IgG activity in serum specimens. Materials and methods: Mosaic of 2 antigenic domains from the proteins encoded by open reading frames 65 (140-170 aa) and K8.1 (32-62 aa) of HHV-8 was produced as GST fusion protein to develop an assay for the detection of anti HHV-8 antibodies.Assay conditions were optimized to reduce the possibility of false positive and false negative results. To validate the specificity and sensitivity of new EIA sera from HIV-infected individuals (n = 163), children (0-15 years) (n = 170), patients with sexual transmitted diseases (STD) (n = 136), and from European normal blood donors (n = 1349) were tested.

LBM is a peptide deformylase inhibitor (PDI), a class of compounds with a novel mechanism of action against Gram-positive (GP) organisms and some respiratory tract Gram-negative (GN) fastidious pathogens that is currently in clinical development. Methods: A checkerboard broth microdilution test method was used to test 108 clinical isolates: Enterobacteriaceae (ENT; 81), nonfermentative GN (NFGN; 15), N. meningitis (NM; 2), Staphylococci (included MRSA and MR-CoNS; 6) and Enterococcus spp. (4). Tests were performed using Mueller-Hinton broth (supplemented with lysed horse blood for NM). The following definitions were used in characterizing combination MIC results: antagonism (ANT), \u20214-fold increase of both agents; synergy (SYN), \u20214fold decrease of both agents; partial SYN (PSYN), \u20214-fold decrease of 1 agent/2-fold decrease of the other; additive (ADD), 2-fold decrease of both agents; indifference (IND), no decrease or only a 2-fold decrease or increase for 1 agent. Results: No ANT was observed for any isolate or tested combination. All 10 GP pathogens showed IND to the combination of LBM and AZT. The ENT showed a significant enhanced activity with 69-100% of each species giving additive or greater interaction results (exception, S. marcescens). Among Klebsiella spp. (KSP) isolates, 53% displayed SYN, E. coli (EC) and Enterobacter spp. (EBS) showed 56% PSYN or SYN and 80% of P. mirabilis (PM) showed PSYN. Among the NFGN, Acinetobacter (ASP) isolates showed 60% SYN and 40% PSYN, whereas only 27% of P. aeruginosa were PSYN or ADD. S. maltophilia (40%) and B. cepacia (20%) isolates displayed ADD effects; the rest were IND to the combination. One of the NM showed an ADD effect. Conclusions: The combination of LBM and AZT provided predominant SYN or PSYN interactions against many GN organisms (ASP, KSP, EC, EBS and PM).

Patient and Methods: A 64 years old man presented himself at our hospital with complaints of fatigue, fever and weight loss since a couple of weeks. Eight years ago he had received an aortic valve bioprosthesis. Under the working diagnosis of a bacterial endocarditis several blood-and a bone marrow samples were taken for culture. Incubation time was extended, however, all cultures remained negative. Since trans-esophageal-echoscopy of the valves could not confirm the diagnosis of an endocarditis, uncertainty concerning the diagnosis was growing.Finally, a 3 ml EDTA blood sample was taken for 16S rDNA PCR and sequencing. DNA was extracted from the sample by a bead-beating/silica/guanidinium thiocyanate procedure. Amplification was performed with universal bacterial primers. A positive signal was found and subsequent sequencing revealed a Bartonella species. A positive Bartonella serology (IgG titer 500) confirmed our 16S rDNA PCR finding and the diagnosis of a Bartonella endocarditis was made. Patient was treated with a combination of antibiotics. Conclusion: Direct detection of bacterial DNA in an EDTA blood sample using broad-range PCR and subsequent DNA sequencing is an important diagnostic tool, particularly helpful in cases where bacteraemia is suspected but bloodcultures nevertheless remain negative. One hundred and three HVT from 100 patients were studied. Twenty-two HVT belonged to 20 patients with definite EI. Eighty patients were free of IE and their 80 HVT were included as negative controls. Universal 16S rRNA gene PCR was made with primers PSL and P13P by real-time PCR in a Light-Cycler instrument using Sybr-green and 35 PCR cycles. days. The analytical sensitivity of this assay was 100 cfu/mg. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive and negative predictive values of this real-time PCR method were respectively: 100%, 98.76%, 95.6% and 100%.Conclusions: This method of universal real-time PCR followed by direct sequencing applied to resected heart valves has proved to be more sensitive, specific and rapid than conventional culture methods. This real-time assay makes it possible to predict IE by the number of cycles of PCR at which samples of HVT amplify.Supported in part by \\\\'Red Espa\u00f1 ola de Investigaci\u00f3 n en Patolog\u00eda Infecciosa' (REIPI -C03/14).P1293Outcomes of treatment of infective endocarditis with home intravenous antibiotic therapyM.A. Goenaga, C.

Methods: Serotyping using agglutination tests and immunochemistry, and virulence typing of isolates from our strain collections combined with a review of the literature on new types. Results: O174 and O175 were originally isolated from cases of human diarrhoea. The O174 strain is negative for known virulence genes, the O175 strain is positive for astA and daaC. Six new strains produced Verocytotoxin and were positive for vtx1, vtx2 or both genes. Additional virulence genes associated with diarrhoeal disease in humans were found in four of the strains. O176 and O177 strains were isolated from calves, O178 and O181 strains from meat, the O179 strain from human bloody diarrhoea, and the O180 strain from swine. Conclusion: The agglutination tests, the epidemiological and clinical data were more than sufficient for the establishment of O groups O174 through O181 as part of the existing serotyping scheme for E. coli and will serve to characterise strains of E. coli belonging to both diarrhoeagenic E. coli (DEC), extraintestinal pathogenic E. coli (ExPEC) and nonpathogenic E. coli.

SB broths were sub-cultured after 24 h onto SBA with cefoxitin disk (30 lg) and MRSA ID agar. S. aureus isolates were identified by coagulase test. Susceptibility to oxacillin was determined by cefoxitin disk method according to NCCLS. Identification and oxacillin resistance were confirmed by PCR for 16S rRNA, nuc and mecA genes. Results: MRSA strains were isolated in 55 (11%) specimens, either from primary MRSA ID (n = 53), primary SBA (n = 37), secondary MRSA ID (n = 53), or secondary SBA (n = 48), respectively. Sensitivities/specificities of the different media were: 96%/99% for primary MRSA ID, 63%/85% for primary SAB, 96%/99% for secondary MRSA ID and 86%/85% for secondary SAB. The combination of MRSA ID agar with salt enrichment broth did not increase the screening sensitivity in contrast with SBA. The median times to MRSA identification were 3 days for both agars (range 2-4 days) and 3 days after enrichment broth (range 3-4 days). Sixty-four per cent MRSA recovered from MRSA ID were detected after 24 h incubation. Conclusions: MRSA ID was found to be a sensitive and specific medium for the screening of MRSA carriage in hospitalized patients. Prolonged incubation of MRSA ID for 48 h increased the yield of this medium by 36%. According to the results obtained with the MRSA ID screen plate, it does not require the additional phase of enrichment broth. The direct consequences are a gain of time-to-result of 24 h as well as an important simplification of methodology for the culture surveillance of MRSA.R. Skov, A.R. Larsen, N.

In this paper we evaluate 10, 30 and 60 mcg Cefoxitin Neo-Sensitabs tablets for predicting methicillin resistance using a challenge set of S. aureus. Methods: A total of 196 recently isolated S. aureus all tested for presence of the mecA gene (EVIGENE, SSI, Denmark) were investigated. The mecA positive isolates (N = 62) were a challenge set consisting of the most heterogeneous resistant MRSA isolates found in a recent investigation (Skov et al, J Antimicrob Chemother). The isolates represented 39 different PFGE types (at least one band difference) and included isolates with oxacillin MIC <2 mg/L. The mecA negative isolates were consecutive blood culture isolates (N = 99) as well as the mecA negative isolates with the smallest cefoxitin zones in a recent evaluation (N= 35). S. aureus ATCC 29213 and 25923 were included as control strains in each run.

Sensitivity of the LSMoc medium (90%) was higher than sensitivity of the in house method (76%) (P < 0.01). However, in contrast to the CNA medium, the LSMoc medium required an additional 24-48 hours of incubation before it could be examined for the presence of MRSA. The LSMoc medium misidentified 22 isolates as MRSA (specificity 96.4%). These were mostly coagulasenegative Staphylococci, mainly belonging to the species S. capitis, which gave opacification. There was no difference in the number of MRSA isolates detected on the LSMoc medium by use of the oxacillin or cefoxitin disk. Conclusion: Use of the LSMoc medium increases the yield of MRSA, due to added enrichment for growth and ease of visual recognition of MRSA isolates. However, the medium still requires confirmation of presumptive MRSA isolates and requires prolonged incubation. Two evaluation methods for screening specimens to detect methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus Y. Mart\u00edn, A. Rezusta, J. Castillo, M.J. Revillo (Zaragoza, E)Objectives: Rapid assessment of clinical specimens for the presence of MRSA is an important part to control measures for infections taken to reduce the spread of MRSA and thus, to decrease hospitalization costs. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the sensitivity, specificity and the optimal incubation time from patient specimens by using ORSAB (Oxacillin Resistance Screening Agar Base) as a primary culture medium compared with those obtained by using a previous enrichment broth medium, Tryptone Soy Broth added with 75 lg/ml of aztreonam (TSB Azt). Methods: Every MRSA screening swab was inoculated initially onto ORSAB and incubated aerobically for 48 h at 35\u00b0C; the plates were examined after 24 and 48 h. At the same, each specimen was introduced in TSB Azt. After 24 h of incubation, they were subcultured onto ORSAB, following the same process described previously. All mannitol-fermenting colonies were confirmed as S. aureus by using a latex agglutination system (Pastorex Staph Plus Bio Rad). Resistance to methicillin was determined by the disk diffusion method according to the NCCLS. Results: Out of 404 studied samples, 90.35% were nose swabs. MRSA was detected in 15% of these samples. The sensitivity and specificity obtained when ORSAB alone was used were 96.6 and 48.3% respectively. When we previously used TSB Azt, the results were 94.9 and 49.5%. While 93.0% of MRSA was detected after 24 h of incubation in the first case, it was 98.2% after using an enrichment broth medium. Conclusions: ORSAB gave a positive result in 93.0% of the samples after 24 h of incubation. The three MRSA isolated only from direct culture onto ORSAB belonged to samples which had a low amount of microorganisms. Low specificity was especially due to Staphylococcus haemolyticus, very common in nose samples. With such a high number of nose samples, our study showed that the use of TSB Azt gave a minimum increase of sensitivity.M.E. Reverdy, S. Orenga, J.M. Roche, S. Delorme, J. Etienne (Lyon, La Balme les Grottes, Craponne, F) Objective: Nasal carriage of Methicillin-Resistant S. aureus (MRSA) is an important cause of nosocomial infection. Screening of patients during admission is recommended to reduce the incidence of MRSA. The aim of the study was to evaluate the new MRSA ID media (bioM\u00e9rieux) for rapid isolation and identification of MRSA. Methods: MRSA ID was compared to ORSAB medium (Oxoid). CNA sheep blood agar (COL) was used as the reference method. A total of 278 nasal swabs were inoculated directly on the media which were incubated 24 and 48 h at 35\u00b0C. Green colonies on MRSA ID, blue on ORSAB and typical S. aureus colonies on COL were regarded as presumptive MRSA isolates. Confirmation was performed using a coagulase test and PCR for mecA gene. Results: A total of 45 swabs were positive for MRSA. After 24 h incubation, 42, 38 and 42 MRSA strains were isolated on MRSA ID, ORSAB and COL respectively. MRSA isolates produced colonies of intense color on chromogenic media. The sensitivity of detection of MRSA ID (93.3%) was higher than ORSAB (84.4%). The number of false positives (FP) on ORSAB was higher (25 coagulase-negative Staphylococc -CNS, and 2 methicillin-sensitive S. aureus) compared to MRSA ID (3 CNS). If only taking into account colony color, the predictive positive value (PPV) was 93.3% for MRSA ID, 58.5% for ORSAB. If the coagulase test result was included, the PPV value of ORSAB became 95%. After 48 h, MRSA ID enabled the recovery of 1 MRSA strain more (43 strains) whereas 5 strains more were isolated on ORSAB (43 strains). However the PPV values of both media decreased because MRSA ID produced many pale green colonies of CNS, and ORSAB in the same way. Depending on the interpretative reading of the laboratory, FP on MRSA ID were easily differentiated from MRSA isolates. Conclusion: MRSA ID enables rapid and definitive identification of MRSA isolates. Sensitivity of MRSA ID after 24 h was higher than that of ORSAB. Reading of MRSA ID after 48 hrs is not recommended due to the possibility of FP results. The use of MRSA ID does not require any supplementary testing after 24 h, whereas additional tests are necessary for ORSAB media.Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate using of home made oxacillin for detection of MRSAMethods: 96 clinical isolates of S. aureus strains in Milad hospital were chosen for detection of MRSA Disk diffusion method was performed as recommended by National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS M2-A8 ) Collectively three kinds of xoacillin disks from different sources were tested. Two kinds of disks were home made (we called with sources of A and B) and the third was from other country (source c). E-test was selected as reference method. all test performed at the same condition. Results: By E-test method of 96 strains of S. aureus 51 strains were MRSA and 45 strains were susceptible to methicillin. Oxacillin disks from company A showed 94 MRSA, and two intermediate strains. There was not any susceptible strain by using this product. By using other home made oxacillin disk( B) 60 strains were MRSA , 21 strains intermediate and 22 strains susceptible to methicillin. By using oxacillin disks from other country(C )of 96 tested S. aureus isolates 52 strains were MRSA, 8.strain intermediate and 36 strains susceptible. Unfortunately, home made disks especially from A company showed very low sensitivity and specificity.Conclusions: This study reveals that in our country using of disk diffusion method is not reliable for detection of MRSA. This may be due to limitation in sources of oxacillin disks and very poor in quality of these products. It is strongly recommended that using of other methods such as E-test and oxacillin screen agar methods are highly preferable.P1385Evaluation of the new ATB STAPH and rapid ATB STAPH devices for oxacillin resistance detection in Staphylococci V. Vernet-Garnier, J. Madoux, C. De Champs, L. Mullier, G. Zambardi (Reims, La-Balme-les-Grottes, F) Objectives: Reliable, simple, rapid and low cost phenotypic methods are still needed for the oxacillin resistance detection in Staphylococci. Due to an heterogeneous expression, this detection is still challenging as demonstrated by the various protocols that have been proposed: NaCl complementation (2-5%), decreased temperature (30\u00b0C) or increased length of incubation (48 h), increased inoculum size, specific agar screen test, breakpoints redefinition according to the species and use of alternative markers (cefoxitin, moxalactam). The aim of this study is to evaluate how perform the oxacillin test included in both ATBSTAPH (ref. 14329)  and rapid ATB STAPH (ref. 14479) devices (bioM\u00e9rieux) versus the mecA gene detection (gold standard) and the oxacillin (5 mcg) and cefoxitin (30 mcg) disk diffusion tests (OXA DD, FOX DD). Methods: Two-hundred S. aureus strains were tested with the various methods (100 mecA+, 100 mecA)). DD tests were performed according to the French expert guidelines(CA-SFM  2004). For FOX DD, when an Intermediate (non conclusive) category was obtained, the result was considered S or R according to, respectively, the absence or presence of the mecA gene. An additional set of 100 coagulase negative Staphylococci (CNS) was tested with ATB STAPH only (50 mecA+, 50 mecA)). Oxacillin MIC and population analysis were also performed for the mecA+ strains not detected by the ATB devices. Results: Sensitivity and specificity results for oxacillin resistance detection of each method, versus mecA, are shown in theTable.Conclusions: This study highlights that ATB STAPH and rapid ATB STAPH devices perform as well as the FOX DD test and are superior to the OXA DD test for the detection of oxacillin resistance in S. aureus. ATB STAPH performances are still good when CNS are tested. The resistance is missed only for strains expressing heterogeneous resistance, as demonstrated by the low oxacillin MICs (\u00a31 mg/L) and the population analysis profiles. All methods show very good specificity, except ATB STAPH for which some S. aureus strains are overcalled resistant. Based on the 2004 CA-SFM guideline, the FOX DD test is sometimes non conclusive and this requires additional testing P1386 Detection of methicillin resistance in Staphylococci employing the Uro-Quick system S.

Results: We examined 1024 swabs for the presence of MRSA. With the PCR, there were 80 positive MRSA results that could be reported to the clinician after 24 hours . After 48 hours 38 MRSA could be reported from the ORSAB whereas conventional culture with a sheep blood agar plate yielded 67 MRSA. The final evaluation after 5 days resulted in 197 MRSA from blood agar combined with enrichment broth, 156 MRSA from ORSAB and 80 MRSA from PCR. No MRSA could be detected in 789 samples. Conclusions: Real-time PCR for detection of MRSA is a useful method for providing MRSA results within a very short period of time. The demand for a very sensitive method can only be met with a longer incubation time and the use of an enrichment broth which accounted in our study for additional 25% positive results.K. Becker, I. Pagnier, B. Schuhen, F. Wenzelburger, A.W. Friedrich, G. Peters, C. von Eiff (Munster, D)Objectives: Detection of carriers of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is crucial for infection control purposes. Numerous molecular methods, often simultaneously in multiplex format, to identify the mecA gene coding for methicillin resistance (MR) and genes specific for the species S. aureus have been introduced. However, application of molecular methods for detection of MRSA directly from specimens may be influenced by co-colonization with MR-coagulase-negative Staphylococci (CoNS) carrying the mecA gene. Studies investigating the frequency of the co-colonization with methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) and MR-CoNS on the skin and mucous membranes with the potential risk of false-positive results in molecular MRSA detection tests are missing. Methods: A total of 249 nasal swabs were collected directly at admission to the cardiac surgery department at the University Hospital of Muenster as well as from known MRSA carriers (n = 14). Only one swab per patient was included. Staphylococcal isolates were identified by standard microbiological procedures and confirmed by molecular methods. Methicillin resistance was determined by mecA amplification. Results: Growth of staphylococcal isolates were found in 232 (93.2%) of the nasal swabs comprising 66 S. aureus isolates consisting of 45 MSSA and 21 MRSA isolates and 311 isolates of CoNS (S. epidermidis, n = 216; S. haemolyticus, n = 31, other CoNS, n = 64). Overall, 130 (41.8%) CoNS isolates were tested methicillin resistant (MR-S. epidermidis, n = 98; MR-S. haemolyticus, n = 19, other MR-CoNS, n = 13). Co-colonization of the anterior nares with MSSA and MR-CoNS (MR-S. epidermidis, n = 6; MR-S. haemolyticus, n = 1; other MR-CoNS, n = 1) were found in 8 (3.2%) of the nasal swabs tested. Conclusion: Nasal co-colonization with MSSA and MR-CoNS was found in a low percentage. However, in a low MRSA setting, false-positive MRSA test results may lead to a couple of efforts in eliminating the patient's putative MRSA colonization and in additional infection control measures and, consequently, in a substantial increase in costs and personnel workload.",

            "text": "Methods: The validation of the assay was performed using 12 MRSA strains and 31 other strains of Staphylococci (not MRSA). A positive result was obtained for all MRSA strains and not with the other strains. 437 screening swabs from anterior nares and throat were obtained from patients hospitalized in the intensive care unit. S. aureus strains were identified according to their characteristic growth morphologies, Gram stain characteristics, reaction to catalase, coagulase production, colour of colonies on SAID culture media (Biomerieux) and LightCycler staphylococcus kit (Roche Diagnostics). Resistance to oxacillin was measured with an AST-P536 card on the VITEK-2 instrument (Biomerieux) and/or LightCycler MRSA detection kit (Roche Diagnostics). In order to gain time, we included an automated DNA extraction protocol on a LC MagNA Pure instrument and we realised the real-time PCR on a LightCycler instrument. Results: 24 MRSA could distinctly be detected by this PCR assay, Vitek-2 and/or LightCycler Staphylococcus-MRSA detection kits. From these, 14 were detected both by PCR and Vitek-2, 4 only by Vitek-2 and 6 only by the new PCR assay. The per cent of agreement is 97.7%. Conclusion: This real-time PCR assay represents a rapid and powerful method which can be used for the detection of MRSA directly from specimens containing a mixture of staphylococci. The turn-around-time for the whole process is only 4 hours. Detection of MRSA directly from blood cultures using real-time PCR P. Della-Latta, P. Pancholi, F. Wu (New York City, USA)Objectives: Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) septicemia is a life-threatening infection challenging both clinicians and laboratorians. Early detection of MRSA sepsis is of utmost importance to decrease patient morbidity and mortality, reduce empiric use of vancomycin and permit effective decisions for patient management. Real-time PCR using the IDI-MRSA (Infectio Diagnostic) commercial assay and various home-brew (HB) PCR assays have been used to detect MRSA directly from both colonized and infected patients. This study 1) evaluated a modification of the IDI-MRSA in comparison to a HB PCR assay for direct detection of MRSA from newly positive blood culture bottles 2) compared the performance of a modification of the IDI assay to conventional culture techniques 3) contrasted time to results of molecular and non-molecular procedures. Methods: Aliquots of blood culture bottles (BACTEC 9240, Becton-Dickinson) obtained from 368 patients at Columbia University Medical Center that signaled positive and that Gram stained as gram-positive cocci (GPC) in clusters, were tested with the IDI-MRSA assay and a HB PCR using the SmartCycler (Cepheid). The IDI system detects the staphylococcal cassette mecA -orfX amplicon; whereas the HB assay detects the nuc and mecA genes. The introduced modifications of the IDI system, which included one NaOH wash and two dilution steps with Tris-buffer, were necessary to decrease false-positive results due to high bacterial counts. The molecular methods were compared to culture using the MicroScan Walkaway SI (Dade Behring, IL) for identification and the oxacillin screen plate. Results: MRSA was detected from 37 of 368 (10%) of blood culture sets tested. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive and negative predictive values for IDI-MRSA compared to culture were 100%, 99.4%, 94.9% and 100%, respectively. Discordance of IDI and culture was observed in 0.5% of patients and was resolved using HB PCR. The IDI assay, as opposed to HB, accurately distinguished MRSA from the 0.4% blood cultures that were mixed with S. aureus and other bacteria, i.e. coagulase-negative Staphylococci (CoNS). MRSA detection by IDI was obtained within 2-24 hr compared to 48-72 hr by culture. Conclusions: The IDI real-time assay using the SmartCycler can be successfully adapted for accurate, same-day detection of MRSA directly from positive blood culture bottles, regardless of the co-existence of CoNS.P1392 Molecular diagnosis of Staphylococcus aureus isolates N.S.

Results: Analysis of the S. aureus multilocus sequence typing (MLST) database yielded seven single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that provide a D of 0.95 with respect to the MLST database i.e. if two sequence types are chosen at random from the database, there is a probability of 0.95 that they will differ at one or more of the SNPs. Recalculation of published S. aureus MLST-based studies has shown that a similar level of discrimination is obtained with actual collections of isolates. The SNP profiles are highly concordant with clonal complexes. A kinetic PCR method for interrogating the SNPs was shown to be robust, although a modified SNP set gave better results with crude genome preparations. The SNPs gave nine profiles with a 107 Australian MRSA isolates. The informative power of a number of binary genes in combination with the SNPs was tested, and it was found that testing for presence of the pvl, sdrE and cna genes, together with three mecA-associated plasmids increased the number of types to 21.Conclusion: A rationally designed S. aureus genotyping approach suitable for routine use on real-time PCR or medium density chip-based platforms has been demonstrated.

Unfortunately most institutions include only bloodstream infections (BSI) when describing the spectrum of infection in such patients, despite the fact that BSI account for only 25-35% of infections. Also most data bases do not include polymicrobial infections either. These omissions give an incomplete and erroneous impression regarding the spectrum of bacterial infection.

Peck, N.Y. Lee, J.-H. Song on behalf of the Asian Pacific Research Foundation for Infectious DiseaseObjective: To evaluate the adequacy of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) for prevention of urinary tract infection(UTI) in patients underwent renal transplantation in the setting where TMP-SMX resistance is common. Methods: All patients underwent renal transplantation at Samsung Medical Center from January 1998 and August 2002 were included with the completion of 2 year-follow-up. TMP-SMX was prophylactically administered during 12 months after renal transplantation. Their medical records and microbiologic data were reviewed. Results: A total of 336 patients were enrolled. (male to female ratio 191:145, mean age 39 \u00b1 10 years). 146 episodes of UTI were Klebsiella spp. (5%), and Streptococcus spp. (1%). Among 75 E. coli isolates, rates of resistance to TMP-SMX, ciprofloxacin, ampicillin/sulbactam, and ceftriaxone were 63%, 35%, 34%, and 1%. There was no difference in mortality rate related with the occurrence of UTI (p = 0.75). Conclusion: Despite of high prevalence of TMP-SMX-resistant E. coli, the incidence of UTI in renal recipients receiving TMP-SMX are similar to that in the setting where TMP-SMX resistance is uncommon. Nevertheless, because most episodes of UTI occur within 1 or 6 months of transplantation, further study is warranted to evaluate if additional preventive strategies during early period is needed.",

Jacobs (Brussels, B)Objective: The aim of the study was to review clinical and microbiological features of the nocardial infections diagnosed in our 858-bed academic hospital over the past 3 years. Patients and Methods: All patients with at least one sample culture positive for Nocardia sp between May 2000 and August 2004 were included. Underlying conditions, immunosuppressive treatments, site of infection, clinical, microbiological and radiological features, treatment and outcome were compiled. The identification was based on the morphology by Gram and modified Kinyoun stains, aspect of the colonies on blood agar, phenotypical tests and amplification-sequencing of a speciesspecific region of the 16S rDNA. Susceptibility tests were performed by E-test on Mueller-Hinton agar and interpreted according to NCCLS criteria. Results: Nocardia sp was recovered from 8 patients (5 males and 3 females, mean age 52 y.). All patients had predisposing factors: 4 were solid organ transplant recipients and 4 were treated with glucocorticosteroids. Infection involved the lung in 3 patients, CNS in 2, muscles and soft tissues in 1, and was Phenotypic and genotypic identification methods were concordant in all cases. All isolates were susceptible to trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) and amikacin and all but one N. farcinica strain (MIC imipenem/meropenem >32 lg/ml) were susceptible to carbapenems. Patients were treated with high doses of oral or i.v. TMP/SMX (3), i.v. meropenem (3), and the combination of TMP/SMX and meropenem (1). All patient rapidly improved except the patient infected with the N. farcinica strain resistant to carbapenem, until his initial meropenem treatment was replaced by high doses of i.v. TMP/SMX. Conclusions: Nocardia can cause various clinical syndromes in immunocompromised patients. Early microbiological diagnosis of nocardial infections enabled rapid appropriate management and favorable outcome of all patients. Furthermore, the initial clinical failure associated with carbapenem resistance of a N. farcinica strain underlines the need for rapid and reliable identification of Nocardia to species level and susceptibility testing.M.

Our work aimed at assessing the prevalence and clinical correlates to reactivation of seven herpesviruses in a single paediatric cohort. Methods: Between January 2001 and September 2004, 88 children and adolescents (aged median 8.7 yrs, range 0.2-20.5 yrs) underwent allogeneic HSCT. We tested 2383 blood samples drawn weekly for first three months after HSCT and less frequently thereafter. Viral loads were tested using real-time quantitative PCR, and normalised to 100000 human genomic equivalents. Results of EBV, CMV and HHV6 were available within one day, while HSV, VZV and HHV7 were tested retrospectively in 1405 representative samples. The provisional positivity threshold was set to 1000 normalised copies. PCR monitoring of viral load has proven useful for guiding preemptive therapy for EBV or CMV, as shown by only one death among 88 transplanted children. On the other hand, despite relatively high prevalence of HHV6 or HHV7, their prospective monitoring is unlikely to improve the prognosis of the patients, as the viruses seem to be relatively harmless. The absence of significant load of HSV and VZV may by associated with preventive administration of acyclovir and may therefore be specific for centres using this prophylaxis.The work is supported by grant of Ministry of Health of Czech Republic No. 7459 P1413 Quantitative PCR for EBV DNA in paediatric renal transplant patients K. Harvey-Wood, A. Balfour, J. Beattie, C. Williams (Glasgow, UK)Introduction: Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-induced post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) has been reported in between 1%-10% of all paediatric renal transplant recipients. PTLD is a heterogeneous group of conditions characterised by EBV-driven proliferation of B-lymphocytes in the face of impaired T-cell immune surveillance. We have performed longitudinal surveillance EBV DNA levels in renal transplant patients to attempt to correlate virological findings with changes in blood levels of EBV DNA. Aim: To determine the usefulness of longitudinal measurement of EBV levels in paediatric patients following renal transplantation. Methods: EBV in whole blood was quantified using real time PCR and clinical data on the patients collected. Results: We have found no correlation between the absolute level of EBV DNA and the development of PTLD. All patients who developed PTLD have positive PCR results but a number of patients without PTLD also had raised levels of EBV DNA. Conclusion: Longitudinal Quantitative measurement of EBV DNA allows the diagnosis of PTLD to be considered but in our population we have been unable as yet to set either and absolute cut off or rate of change of count which could be said to be diagnostic of PTLD.",

The IE-log AUC/MIC plots were linear and virtually superimposed for daptomycin and vancomycin. Based on the IE-AUC/MIC relationship of the IE, the anti-staphylococcal effect of the proposed therapeutic dose of daptomycin (4 mg/kg; AUC/MIC 1100 h for S. aureus 866) is 20% greater than that of two 1-g doses of vancomycin given at a 12-h interval (AUC/MIC 570 h). Conclusion: These findings predict greater anti-staphylococcal efficacy of clinically achievable AUC/MICs of daptomycin relative to vancomycin. Relative abilities of daptomycin and vancomycin to prevent the enrichment of resistant Staphylococcus aureus mutants in an in vitro dynamic modelA. Firsov, I. Alferova, M. Smirnova, I. Lubenko, S. Vostrov, E. Mirchink, Y. Portnoy, S. Zinner (Moscow, RUS; Cambridge, USA)Objectives: The mutant selection window (MSW) hypothesis has been successfully tested in our recent study with S. aureus 866 (MIC of DAP 0.35 mg/L and MIC of VAN 0.70 mg/L) exposed to daptomycin (DAP) and vancomycin (VAN) over a wide range of the 24-h area under the curve (AUC) to MIC. To explore if the AUC/MIC relationships of resistance are bacterial strain-independent, a less susceptible S. aureus 10 (MIC of DAP 1.1 mg/L and MIC of VAN 2.2 mg/L) was tested using the same model. Methods: Five-day treatments were mimicked with once-daily DAP (half-life 9 h) and twice-daily VAN (half-life 6 h). S. aureus 10 was exposed to a series of pharmacokinetic profiles of DAP and VAN that provide peak concentrations equal to the MIC, between the MIC and the mutant prevention concentration (MPC), i.e., within the MSW, and above the MPC (AUC/MIC 16-256 h). MPCs of DAP and VAN were 5.5 and 10.9 mg/L, respectively. Changes in the susceptibility of S. aureus 10 to DAP or VAN were examined by repeated MIC determinations at each 24 h and in the end of treatment. To determine the resistance frequency (f), the surviving organisms were counted by plating the specimens on agar containing 2 \u00b7 and 4 \u00b7 MIC of DAP orVAN.   Results: Both in terms of susceptibility testing and the population analysis, selection of the resistant mutants occurred at DAP and VAN concentrations that fell into the MSW (AUC/ MIC from 32 to 128 h) but not at concentrations out of MSW (AUC/MIC 16 and 256 h). Bell-shape AUC/MIC relationships of resistance of S. aureus 10 were similar to those observed with DAP-and VAN-exposed S. aureus 866 as well as with S. aureus exposed to fluoroquinolones. Based on these findings, an AUC/ MIC ratio that may protect from the selection of resistant mutants was predicted at 256 h for both DAP and VAN. For S. aureus 10, this protective value is less than AUC/MIC provided by usual 4 mg/kg dose of DAP (350 h) but not by two 1-g doses ofVAN (180 h). Conclusions: Clinically achievable concentrations DAP may be more effective than those of VAN in prevention of the selection of resistant S. aureus. Also, these findings support the MSW hypothesis.P1590The influence of Staphylococcus aureus accessory gene regulator function on the development of glycopeptide heteroresistance in an in vitro pharmacodynamic model B. Tsuji, M. Rybak (Detroit, USA)Objective: The development of glycopeptide heteroresistance in patients with S. aureus infections has been associated with prolonged exposure to sub-therapeutic levels of vancomycin. S. aureus which display accessory gene regulator (agr) dysfunction have been associated with persistent bacteraemia and may be predisposed to develop glycopetide resistance: sub-inhibitory concentrations of vancomycin have selected for heteroresistance in vitro in agr-null group II S. aureus. We studied the effect of administering varying exposures of vancomycin and the development intermediate-level glycopeptide resistance in agr positive and negative group II S. aureus in an in vitro pharmacodynamic model (IVPM). Methods: One agr+ group II (RN6607) and the respective agr) group II, null derivate (RN9120) strain of S. aureus were obtained from the Network on Antimicrobial Resistance in Staphylococcus aureus (NARSA). MICs were determined by Etest & microdilution according to NCCLS. An IVPM was used to simulate regimens of vancomycin of 1 g, 750 mg, 500 mg, 250 mg and 125 mg q12 h (Targeted Peak/Trough concentrations 40/10.0, 30/7.5, 20/5.0, 10/2.5 and 5/1.2 lg/ml). Simulations were performed in triplicate and bacterial quantification occurred over 72 h. The development of vancomycin heteroresistance was evaluated at 24, 48 and 72 h.Results: Pre-exposure vancomycin MIC were 1.0 against both agr+ group II and agr) group II strains. Against agr+ II S. aureus, exposure to all simulated of vancomycin regimens did not result in the development of resistance over 72 h. Post-exposure MICs for all regimens were \u00a32.0 lg/ml. Against agr) II, over 72 h, exposure to vancomycin 1 g q12 h (24 h Area Under Concentration Curve (AUCfree24/MIC:510 lg/ml/hr) and 750 mg q12 h (AUCfree24/MIC: 382) resulted in post-exposure MICs of 1-3 lg/ml. Increased post-exposure MICs up to 3 lg/ml were noted secondary to exposure to 500 mg (AUCfree24/MIC: 264) and 250 mg (AUCfree24/MIC: 123). Exposure to 125 mg (AUC-free24/MIC:67) resulted in the development of vancomycin heteroresistance, as post-exposure MICs increased to 6 lg/ml. Conclusions: Sub-optimal exposures of vancomycin resulted in the development of glycopeptide heteroresistance in agr-null group II S. aureus. These findings suggest that prolonged, lowlevel vancomycin concentrations or decreased vancomycin penetration in sequestered infections may provide conditions that select for glycopeptide heteroresistance.P1591 Killing kinetics of Staphylococcus aureus exposed to linezolid, alone and in combination with doxycycline, in an in vitro dynamic model M. Smirnova, I. Alferova, I. Lubenko, S. Vostrov, Y. Portnoy, E. Isakova, S. Zinner, A. Firsov (Moscow, RUS; Cambridge, USA)Objective: To predict the possible advantages of linezolid/ doxycycline combinations, their pharmacodynamics were stud-ied with S. aureus in an in vitro dynamic model that mimics human pharmacokinetics of the antibiotics. Methods: A clinical isolate of S. aureus at a starting inoculum of 8 Log CFU/ml was exposed to twice-daily linezolid (half-life 6 h), alone and in combination with once-daily doxycycline (half-life 15 h) for five consecutive days. The MIC of linezolid was 1.56 mg/L and MIC of doxycycline was 6.25 mg/L. With linezolid, a clinically attainable ratio of the 24-h area under the curve (AUC) to MIC (200 h) was simulated. To achieve the same AUC/MIC ratio with linezolid/doxycycline, a 60-h AUC/MIC of linezolid was combined with a 140-h AUC/MIC of doxycycline. In addition, similar five-day treatments were performed with linezolid at AUC/MIC of 60 h alone. To provide simultaneous mono-exponential elimination of linezolid and doxycycline with different half-lives, a previously described dynamic model was modified according to Blaser and Zinner. Results: Regardless of the simulated AUC/MIC, linezolid alone produced a relatively slow initial reduction of the starting inoculum (8 Log CFU/ml), with minimal numbers of surviving organisms on the second day and regrowth on the fifth day of treatment. AUC/MIC-dependent killing was observed beginning from the third day when numbers of surviving organisms were significantly lower after linezolid exposure at AUC/MIC of 200 than 60 h. The respective intensities of the anti-staphylococcal effect (IEs) were 180 and 110 (Log CFU/ml) \u00b7 h. The linezolid/doxycycline combination exhibited a more rapid initial killing followed by much lower numbers of surviving organisms with later regrowth. The respective IE was 1.7 times greater than mono-therapy with linezolid at the same AUC/ MIC (200 h) and 2.7 times greater than at linezolid's AUC/MIC of 60 h. Conclusions: These data predict the ability of doxycycline to enhance anti-staphylococcal effects of linezolid.Infections in neutropenic patientsP1592 Empirical antibiotics against Gram-positive infections for febrile neutropenia.

Overall failure was equivalent in both study arms, RR 1.00 [0.79-1.27] while failure including modifications occurred more frequently in the control arm due to empirical addition of glycopeptides, RR 0.76 [0.68-0.85]. Amphotericin was added more frequently to the intervention arm in nonblinded trials, RR 1.51 [0.80-2.83] but not in double-blind studies, RR 0.99 [0.75-1.33]. The subgroup of patients with documented GP infections was assessed and no difference in mortality or failure was detected. Meta-regression demonstrated no association between the rate of GP bacteraemia and the relative risk for mortality or failure. Empirical glycopeptides were associated with a significant reduction in bacterial superinfections, RR 0.38 [0.24-0.59], more specifically gram-positive superinfections, RR 0.21 [0.11-0.37], and increased nephrotoxicity, 1.43 [1.06-1.94].Conclusions: Addition of glycopeptides to the antibiotic treatment of febrile neutropenic patients, in general, can be safely deferred for the documentation of resistant GP infections. G. Martinelli, C. Hartman, L. Leonard, K.J. Tack (Milan, I; Ann Arbor, USA)Objectives: Gram-positive bacteria are common pathogens in neutropenic oncology patients. Linezolid (LZD) is effective for the treatment of infections caused by Gram-positive pathogens including methicillin resistant Staph spp., glycopeptide resistant Enterococcus spp., and multi-drug resistant Strep pneumoniae. LZD was compared to vancomycin (VAN) in a randomized, double-blind, multi-centre trial in febrile neutropenic oncology patients. Methods: Eligible oncology patients with febrile neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count <500/mm 3 ) and a proven or suspected Gram-positive infection received LZD (600 mg) or VAN (1 g) IV q12 h for 10-28 days. Test of cure (TOC) assessment was conducted 7 days posttherapy. Clinical efficacy was analysed using sponsor defined clinical outcome. Results: 605 patients were treated (304 LZD, 301 VAN); groups were similar with respect to demographics, comorbidities, severity/type of illness, and degree of neutropenia. Hematologic/lymphatic cancers were the most frequently observed (95.4% LZD, 93.7% VAN). Average duration of treatment was similar between groups (LZD 11.4 days; VAN 11.5 days). Mean time until defervescence (oral temperature \u00a3 37.5\u00b0C) in LZD patients was 6.4 days vs 6.7 days in VAN patients (p = 0.54). Overall mortality rate at 16 days posttherapy was 5.6% for LZD patients vs 7.6% forVAN (p = 0.31). Overall clinical success rates at FU were comparable between LZD and VAN in the intent-to-treat (ITT) population (57.0% vs 52.9%, p = 0.32). Clinical success rates within the subgroups of primary infections were also similar between LZD and VAN(Table 1). Microbiologic outcomes were similar in the two groups. Clinical laboratory results for hematology and biochemistry tests, such as change from baseline and clinically abnormal values, were similar between groups. Drug-related adverse events (DRAEs) occurred significantly less frequently for LZD patients than forVAN patients (52/303 [17.2%]  vs 72/300 [24.0%], p = 0.04). Nausea, vomiting, rash, erythema, and diarrhoea were the most frequently reported DRAEs for both treatment groups. No DRAE was reported significantly more often in the LZD group, however VAN patients reported a significantly higher percentage of drug-related kidney failure (LZD 0/303 vs VAN 4/300, p = 0.04). Conclusion: LZD is as effective as VAN and is a safe therapeutic option for treating febrile neutropenic oncology patients with proven or suspected Gram-positive infections of varying underlying etiologies.P1594UK Survey of antibiotic treatment of febrile neutropenia H.

Limitations: The study results may not be extrapolated to patients who received prior a quinolone for prevention of infection nor to patients who receive per os or intravenous treatment for febrile neutropenia in the outpatient setting. Conclusions: The combination of ciprofloxacin with a betalactam antibiotic should be considered as an important therapeutic option in hospitalized febrile neutropenic patients who have not been receiving a quinolone for prevention of infections.

Pach\u00f3 n (Seville, E)Objective: To describe epidemiology, aetiology, clinical and prognostic features of febrile neutropenia (FN) in patients with solid or haematological neoplasms. Method: Prospective observational study of all FN episodes, among patients admitted in Oncology and Haematology Departments during 21 months(November 2002-August 2004 with either haematological or solid neoplasm of any localization. Results: We studied 292 episodes of FN in 227 patients. 50.3% were males. Median age was 51 years (16-84). 79% had a haematological neoplasm, 21% a solid neoplasm, and 21% were blood stem-cell transplantation recipients. Most frequent malignat disease was acute leukaemia (36%) followed by lymphoma (24%). 22% had a chronic disease different from the neoplasm. A diagnosis of infection was established in 59% of episodes (N = 173), and in 48.5% of them an aetiological diagnosis was established. More frequent infections were pneumonia (30%), catheter infection (22%), primary bacteraemia (20%) and urinary tract infections (9%). 73 patients (42%) had bacteraemia. Bacteria (82%) were the most common infectious aetiology, followed by mixed infections by fungi and bacteria (14%) and fungal infections alone (4%). Between bacteria, the most frequent were: Staphylococcus coagulase-negative (30%), Escherichia coli (20%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (13%), Staphylococcus aureus (9%), Enterococcus faecium (3%) and Proteus mirabilis (3%). Between fungi the most frequent were Aspergillus spp (13%) and Pneumocystis jiroveci (3%). 21% of FN presented wtih severe clinical features, among them the most frequent were arterial hypotension (16%) and acute renal failure (8%). FN episodes with a diagnosis of infection had a higher frequence of severe clinical features in comparison with these with unknown aetiology (p = 0.003; RR 2.18; IC 95%: 1.3-5.3). Mortality at 30th day of episode was 17%. Pneumonia (p = 0.04;RR 2.2; IC 95%: 1.1-4.8), aetiological diagnosis of infection (p < 0.01;RR 2.3; IC 95%: 1.2-4.5), and septic shock (p < 0.001; RR 10; IC 95%: 3.5-28.9) were adverse outcome factors identified by multivariate analysis. Conclusions: Infection is the cause of at least 59% of FN episodes in patients with cancer. The aetiology of infection is established in one half of episodes, with a predominance of bacteria. Pneumonia and catheter infection are the most frequent infection foci. Pneumonia, aetiological diagnosis of infection and septic shock are adverse outcome factors in patients with FN and cancer.S. Levidiotou, P. Bouranta, H. Gesouli, G. Vrioni, C. Pappa, V. Alymara, K.L. Bourantas (Ioannina, GR)Objectives: Bloodstream infections are a major cause of morbility and mortality among patients with haematological disorder. The aim of the present study was the bacterial spectrum and antimicrobial susceptibility pattern of organisms causing bloodstream infections among patients hospitalized in a hematology centre. Methods: A total of 90 episodes of bacteraemia and fungaemia in 63 patients were identified. All patients were treated in the haematology ward during a 5-year period(2000)(2001)(2002)(2003)(2004) and had an underlying haematological disorder (lymphoma, leukaemia and myeloma). There were 42 male and 21 female patients, aged 17-80 years old. Results: A total of 101 microbial strains were isolated in 90 episodes. Fifty-one (50.5%) isolates were Gram-negative bacteria, forty-seven (46.5%) Gram-positive bacteria (46.5%) and 3% yeasts. Polymicrobial bacteraemia was observed in 11 from 90 (12.2%) episodes. The dominated pathogens were coagulasenegative Staphylococci (CNS) 24%, Pseudomonas aeruginosa 21%, E. coli 16%, Enterococcus spp. 8% and S. aureus 7%. The mortality rate was 30.15% (19 patients) being higher in patients with bacteraemia caused by P. aeruginosa, CNS and Klebsiella spp. Oxacillin resistance was detected in 43% of S. aureus isolates and in 63% of CNS. Vancomycin resistance was detected only in one strain E. faecium (12.5%). E. coli strains produced ESBL in 2/16 (12.5%). Among P. aeruginosa isolates, one strain was resistant to all tested agents, 14.3% were susceptible only to colistin and 9.5% only to carbapenems and colistin.Conclusion: The identification of the microbiology profile of bloodstream infections and antimicrobial susceptibility pattern of isolated strains may help in managing these infections in haematology patients, and reviewing infection control and antibiotic policies. Incidence of bacteraemia in patients with haematological and other malignancies after placement of central venous catheter G. Pedersen, M. N\u00f8rgaard, H.C. Sch\u00f8nheyder, H. Larsson, M. Kiiveri, E. Stolberg, P.W. Andersen, H.T. S\u00f8rensen (Aalborg, Aarhus, DK)Objective: Patients with cancer, and in particular patients with haematological malignancies are susceptible to infections including bacteraemia. Central venous access devices are used for intravenous chemotherapy in these patients, but data on the risk of bacteraemia are few. We therefore estimated the incidence of first time bacteraemia and type of microorganisms after placement of the first central venous catheter in patients with haematological (haem) and other types of cancer ('other'). Methods: We conducted the study in North Jutland County from 2000 to 2002 based on data from three databases: the Danish Cancer Registry (cancer patients of age >14 years), the Hospital Discharge Registry (central venous catheter and comorbidity) and the Bacteraemia Research Database (bacteraemia). Three different types of central venous access devices were used: short-term catheters (S) and two long-term catheters: Hickmann (H) and Port-a-cath (P). Results: A total of 362 patients were identified, 107 in the haem group and 252 in the 'other' group. The predominant malignancies were breast cancer (n = 121), non Hodgkin lymphoma (n = 32), ovarian cancer (n = 29), and acute myeloid leukaemia (n = 29). Compared with patients in the haem group, we found a predominance of elderly females in the 'other' group. The distribution of first central venous catheters was: S = 70 (haem: 46), H = 53 (all were haem patients) and P = 239 (haem: 8). A total of 83 patients presented with bacteraemia (haem: 55); the distribution in relation to catheters was: S = 33 patients, H = 26 patients and P = 24 patients. The incidence rate of bacteraemia according to catheter type was S = 8.3/person-year, H = 2.0/ person-year, and P = 0.2/person-year. Incidence rate ratio (IRR) for bacteraemia in patients in the haem group compared with the 'other' group was 13.4 (95% CI: 7.9-22.7) adjusted for age, sex and comorbidity. The most frequent microorganisms were Staphylococcus aureus (n = 20), polymicrobial (n = 17), Escherichia coli (n = 13) and coagulase-negative staphylococci (n = 9). Since all H. catheters were in the haem group and nearly all P. catheters in the 'other' group, we could not rule out the significance of catheter type.Conclusion: Patients with haematological malignancies have a 13-fold increased incidence of bacteraemia compared with other cancer patients. The significance of catheter type warrants further study. Aetiology and clinical outcome of blood-stream infections in patients with haematological malignancies in two Danish university hospitals 2000-2003 J.K. M\u00f8ller, B. Gahrn-Hansen, B.G. Bruun (Skejby, Odense, Hiller\u00f8d, DK)Objectives: To compare etiologies of blood-stream infections according to haematological diagnosis and clinical outcomes of dominating microbiological species/groups at two Danish haematological departments. Methods: A total of 995 blood-stream infections detected in 622 patients between 2000 and 2003 in the two departments were included. Blood-stream infections caused by coagulase-negative staphylococci, coryneforms and propionibacteria were excluded. Bactec \u00e2 (OUH) or BacT/ALERT \u00e2 (AUH) blood culture systems were used for blood culturing. Subcultivation and identification was done using standard microbiological laboratory methods. Haematological diagnoses and clinical outcomes were recorded retrospectively by electronic data analysis. Results: Distributions of haematological diagnoses at the two departments were approximately the same, except for myelomatosis that comprised 19% in AUH and 11% in OUH. We detected a total of 652 and 412 isolates in 609 and 386 blood-stream infections in 360 and 262 patients at AUH and OUH, respectively. A similar proportion of episodes in both hospitals (6%) were polymicrobial. The following differences between microbiological etiology were found: S. pneumoniae, non-haemolytic streptococci, and Gram-negative enterics occurred more frequently at AUH, while enterococci and Gram-negative nonenterics occurred more frequently at OUH. Bacteremia with S. pneumoniae was found in < 1% of AML patients and in about 25% of myelomatosis patients, while E. coli + K. pneumoniae bacteraemia occurred in about 60% of AML patients and 20% of myelomatosis patients. The mortality rate was highest in P. aeruginosa and fungal infections. Conclusion: It is important to perform local surveillance of blood culture etiology and clinical outcomes of blood stream infections, as these vary between haematological departments. Differences in mortality for specific microorganisms necessitate continuing considerations regarding optimal antimicrobial and adjuvant therapy.A.M. Spanaki, E. Markaki, N. Anagnostatou, P.

Ausina (Barcelona, E)The diagnosis of infection in patients with neutropenia secondary to chemotherapy is difficult because clinical signs are unspecific, being fever the only manifestation of sepsis in most of the cases. Objective: 1. To study the usefulness of procalcitonin (PCT) measurement for the diagnosis of systemic bacterial infection in neutropenic patients with fever. 2. To establish baseline values of PCT in patients with haematological malignancies at the time of admission as well as at the onset of neutropenia. Patients and Methods: 43 patients with diagnosis of haematological malignancies who underwent induction chemotherapy or were on conditioning regimens for stem cell transplantation were included. Sera samples on the day of admission, at the beginning of neutropenia, the first day of fever and daily for 6 days were collected. Immunoluminometric assay was used for PCT measurement. Episodes of fever were classified according to the clinical and microbiological diagnosis in three groups: (1) documented bacteraemia; (2) bacterial infection without bacteraemia; and (3) fever of unknown origin, with negative cultures. Results: PCT mean levels at the time of admission and at the onset of neutropenia were 0.337 and 0.33 ng/ml, respectively. Group 1: fifteen patients presented documented bacteraemia. The isolated microorganisms were Escherichia coli (4 patients), Klebsiella pneumoniae (1), coagulase-negative Staphylococcus (5), Streptococcus mitis (1), Staphylococcus aureus (1), Streptococcus salivarius (1) and Lactobacillus sp (1). PCT mean levels at 24-48 hours from the beginning of fever were 3.681 ng/ml in gramnegative and 1.73 ng/ml in gram-positive infections. Group 2: nine patients were included (urinary tract infection in 4, respiratory tract infection in 4 and catheter-related in one) with mean PCT level of 1.51 ng/ml. Group 3: twenty patients presented fever of unknown origin, related with mucositis in eleven of them. PCT mean level was 0.51 ng/ml. Significative differences were only observed between patients with gramnegative bacteraemia and patients with fever of unknown origin (p < 0.05) Conclusions: PCT levels remain at normal values in patients with haematological malignancies at the time of admission and at the beginning of neutropenia. Determination of PCT is useful in the diagnosis of neutropenic fever from infectious origin especially when gram-negative bacteraemia. Supported in part by Grants FIS P1/020098 and predoctoral grant from SEIMC.Results: At start of chemotherapy RANTES mean (SD) concentrations were 6561 \u00b1 3290 and fell progressively to a nadir of 1436 \u00b1 2038 pg/ml. Corresponding platelet concentrations fell from 104 (IQR 43-205) to 5.5 x 109/L. The correlation between platelets and RANTES was highly significant (r = 0.82 (IQR 0.72-0.89)), confirming platelets as the major source of RANTES. During episodes of SIRS/sepsis or severe sepsis/ shock mean RANTES levels were lower at 3394 and 2939 respectively (p < 0.01). Bacteremic pts also had lower RANTES levels (3022 vs 5111 pg/ml, p < 0.01) and platelet concentrations (18.1 vs 36.3, p = 0.07). In pts who survived the level at recovery was 6433 pg/ml, not significantly different from pre-chemotherapy values. 63 of 67 infection episodes resolved despite persistent low RANTES levels. However 4 of the 40 pts died (aspergillosis, candidosis, pneumonia or infectious colitis) -their RANTES concentrations were extremely low (1629) and irrecoverable. RANTES levels began to recover 4.5 days before platelet levels (p < 0.001) and 'bursts' of RANTES were observed during thrombocytopenia, suggesting an additional extra-platelet reservoir for RANTES. Platelet transfusions temporarily elevated the RANTES concentrations. When examined simultaneously within a nested mixed model regression analysis, platelets were the only independent variable among steroids, hematopoietic colony stimulating factor, recombinant human interleukin-11, sepsis status and neutropenia associated with RANTES concentration. The following figure illustrates the relation between RANTES and platelets in 1 pt.Conclusions: A significant hypo-RANTES immunologic environment is created by chemotherapy, driven by accompanying thrombocytopenia, but does not affect the ability of most patients with infection to recover and questions the role of RANTES in such situations. However patients who die from sepsis uniformly have profoundly low RANTES concentrations -whether RANTES is a surrogate marker or important for adequate host response remains a moot point.Procalcitonin, other markers of infectionP1604 Evaluation of procalcitonin as a diagnostic marker of bacteraemia S. Levidiotou, E. Papantoniou, A. Charitou, V. Charitou, H. Sakkas, D. Papamichael (Ioannina, GR)Objectives: Procalcitonin (PCT) was reported to be a reliable marker for severe bacterial infections. The aim of the present study was to clarify the diagnostic value of PCT in patients with bacteraemia. Methods: We prospectively determined the PCT level in 41 adult patients with bacteraemia hospitalized for a period of 4 months (September to December 2004). In 25 of those patients the bacteraemia was caused by Gram (+) bacteria: coagulasenegative Staphylococci (CNS) 12, Staphylococcous aureus 2, Enterococcus spp. 4, Pneumoniococcus 3, Clostridium perfingens 1, Corynebacterium acnes 3. In the remaining 16 patients the bacteraemina was caused by Gram (-) bacteria: Klebsiella spp. 6, E. coli 5, Pseudomonas aeruginosa 2, Acinetobacter baumannii 3. Serum PCT was estimated with an assay based on immunochemiluminescence (BRAHMS Diagnostica, Berlin, Germany).",

Belechri, D. Dimou, N. Ioakimides, N. Marougas, C. Kotsovassilis, P. Tsiodra (Athens, GR) Objectives: To evaluate whether measurements of PCT levels, can help distinguish acute fever due to UTI from fever of other non-microbial inflammatory processes, among elderly patients treated in an internal medicine department. Methods: We prospectively examined 77 patients with acute fever admitted in our department. Variables recorded included patient demographics and principal diagnosis. PCT, C-reactive protein (CRP), Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR) and white blood cell count (WBC) were measured. Blood samples were collected 24-48 hours after the presence of fever. Patients were distinguished according to aetiological diagnosis, based on clinical assessment and laboratory results, to those with fever due to urinary track infection (UTI) (Group A) and those with fever of other inflammatory processes (Group B). Statistical tests applied were Student's t-test and Chi-Square. Results: Of 77 study patients, 37 (48%) had fever due UTI and 40 (52%) due to other inflammatory processes. 32 (42%) were males, 45 (58%) females and mean age of patients studied was 73 years (\u00b1SD 7.6), The mean plasma concentrations of PCT in patients with UTI were 1.16 ng/ml (\u00b1SD 1.76) vs 0.41 ng/ml (\u00b1SD 0.5) in patients of Group B (p = 0.01). Patients in Group A, had as expected, higher values of ESR, 58 mm/h (\u00b1SD 33.4) vs 90 mm/h (\u00b1SD 28.9) (p < 0.0001) and CRP compared with patients in Group B, although the last did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.07). The mean values of WBC did not differ between the two groups, while percentage of neutrophil differ at a significant level (p = 0.002). Conclusions: Among hospitalized elderly patients with fever, levels of PCT seem to be higher among those with UTI compared to patients with fever of other inflammatory processes. PCT can probably be used as an indicator of bacterial infection among older patients with acute fever treated in a department of internal medicine. Procalcitonin trend identifies critically ill patients at high risk of mortality J. Jensen, M. Tvede, L. Heslet, T. Hartvig Jensen, K. Espersen, P. Steffensen (Copenhagen, DK) Objectives: Serum procalcitonin (PCT) has been shown to be an accurate predictor of sepsis, and elevation of PCT blood levels occurs early in the course of a bacterial infection. We investigated the PCT trend to evaluate this as a predictor of mortality in the intensive care unit (ICU). Methods: We enrolled all patients admitted to a multidisciplinary Intensive Care Unit in 2002. Daily PCT measurements, were carried out during the study period. Antimicrobial therapy was, among other factors, guided by the PCT course. The clinical end point was all cause mortality during the stay in the intensive care unit and in a 90-day follow up period of time. Results: PCT measurements evaluated in 472 critically ill patients. Overall mortality of critically ill patients in the one-year study was 19.1%. Odds Ratio for mortality in the ICU for patients with increasing compared to decreasing PCT trend after reaching a level of 1.0 ng/ml was after one day: 2.1 (95% CI 1.2-3.7), after two days: 3.4 (95% CI 1.7-7.0) and after three days: 6.0 (95% CI 2.6-14.1). Conclusion: PCT trend increase for one to three days is associated with high and increasing risk of mortality in the ICU. PCT trend may be a useful tool in fast stratification of critically ill patients in high and low risk patients. Procalcitonin PCT and other routine measured factors of bacterial infections I. Mora\u00f1 ska, J. Niscigorska, A. Boron-Kaczmarska (Szczecin, PL) Objective: Procalcitonin PCT is one of the recently accepted markers of the systemic inflammatory response to severe bacterial infections, especially to sepsis. The aims of this study were: 1. to analyse level of PCT in patients with confirmed sepsis and other infections with systemic clinical manifestations, 2. to assess possible correlations between PCT and other parameters used in routine diagnosis of infections. Methodology: We have analysed 28 patients with sepsis and systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), 20 men and 8 women, aged 17-80 years, mean 47,8. In all patients we have measured concentration of PCT (ng/ml), C-reactive protein CRP (mg/l), fibrinogen (mg/dl) and counts of leukocytes (K/ll) and platelets (K/ll). All measurements were made immediately after admission to hospital, before antibiotic treatment. In the statistical analysis W Shapiro-Wilk test, Pearson's and rang Spearman's correlation coefficients were used. P values below 0,05 determined statistical significance. Results: 1) The studied population contained 13 patients with confirmed sepsis (3-Staph. aureus, 5-Str. pneumoniae,1-Neisseria meningitidis, 2-Salmonella typi C, 1-Staph. hominis, 1-Leptospira icterohaemorrhagiae), 2 patients with bacterial meningitis, 2 patients with malaria, 11 patients with signs of SIRS caused by bacterial infections without positive blood cultures. 2) We observed high concentrations of PCT (>10 ng/ ml) in 11 patients with sepsis, 2 patients with malaria, 1 patient with bacterial meningitis and 5 patients with SIRS in course of localized bacterial infection. 3) CRP concentration ranges from 13,8 to 654,32 mg/l, fibrinogen from 115,9 to 1094 mg/dl, WBC from 2,39 to 39,2 K/ll, PLT from 11,8 to 304 K/ll. 4) We did not find any correlations between concentration of PCT and other inflammatory parameters like CRP, WBC, PLT and fibrinogen. Conclusions: 1) Our study confirmed previous observations that PCT is a very characteristic, early and sensitive parameter of severe systemic bacterial or parasitic infections. 2) PCT is an independent factor of severe systemic infections and did not correlate with other routine measured parameters like CRP, WBC, PLT and fibrinogen. 3) In our opinion measurement of PCT is very important in an early differential diagnosis of sepsis and should be made in clinical daily practice. Comparison of cerebrospinal fluid procalcitonin levels with serum C-reactive protein in the diagnosis of meningitis Z. Ozkurt, S. Erol, M. Ertek, K. Ozden, M.A. Tasyaran (Erzurum, TR)Objective: Procalcitonin (PCT) is a new marker connected to bacterial infection. The aim of the study was to evaluate clinical usefulness of serum procalcitonin measurements in the differential diagnosis of purulent versus tuberculosis and viral meningitis in adults.Methods: A prospective study including adult patients who were suspected of having meningitis and who were admitted to an Department of Infectious Diseases. The diagnosis of meningitis was based on clinical findings, Gram staining, culture, and chemical analysis of CSF. The value of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) PCT for differentiating between acute purulent, tuberculous and viral meningitis was assessed and compared to serum C-reactive protein (CRP) values. Thirty patients with acute purulent meningitis, 30 with tuberculous menengitis, 29 with viral meningitis, and 10 patients with a noninflammatory central nervous system diseases as the controls were included in this study. All CSF samples were taken at patient admission and PCT was detected by immunoluminometric assay (PCT LUMI-TEST, Brahms Diagnostica, Germany). Results: Mean CSF PCT concentrations were 0.18 ng/mL in purulent menengitis, 0.10 ng/mL in tuberculous menengitis and 0.10 ng/mL in viral meningitis, and 0.03 ng/mL in control. There was no any statistical difference in CSF PCT values between acute purulent, tuberculous and viral meningitis groups (p > 0.05). Mean serum CRP values were 19.1 mg/dL in purulent meningitis, 5.9 mg/dL in tuberculous meningitis, 2.1 mg/dL in viral meningitis and 0.3 mg/dL in the control group (p = 0.000).Conclusion: Serum CRP values were found useful, but not CSF PCT values, for differential diagnosis of meningitis. Additionally, CRP is a practical and an inexpensive diagnostic test.P1610Value of body temperature, white blood cell count and C-reactive protein for the diagnosis of intensive care unit-acquired infections: a prospective studyE. Akinci, A. Erbay, A. \u00c7 olpan, H. Bodur, M.A. \u00c7 evik, S.S. Eren (Ankara, TR) Objectives: Markers of infection like fever, high C-reactive protein (CRP) and leukocytosis may be associated with noninfectious causes like trauma, surgical operations and inflammations. Due to the patients in intensive care units are subjected to multiple inflammatory stimuli, the diagnosis of intensive care unit-acquired infections is difficult. The aim of this prospective study was detection of the value of CRP, white blood cell count (WBC) and body temperature for the diagnosis of intensive care unit-acquired infections. Patients and Methods: The patients staying for more than 72 hours in intensive care unit and had no infection during admission were included in the study. They were visited daily and data were recorded in to the individual forms. CRP was measured within 72 hours of admission and thereafter every three days. The patients were classified as 'infected' if infections were identified and as 'noninfected' if no infection was identified during their stay in the intensive care unit. The highest body temperature in the day (T max ), daily WBC count and CRP values were compared between the two groups statistically. STATA 7.0 (College station TX) programme was used for statistical analysis. Results: Sixty-seven patients were included in the study. Of these patients, 31 were within the infected group and 36 were within the noninfected group. In univariate analysis, CRP, T max and WBC were significantly high for the infected patients (p < 0.05). In multivariate analysis, only CRP was associated with infection significantly and independently (OR:1.037, %95CI:1.019-1.054, p < 0.001). The presence of CRP > 50 mg/L yielded sensitivity as % 75, specificity % 96.3, positive predictive value % 96.7 and negative predictive value % 72.2. After development of infection, the increase in CRP and T max was statistically significant (p < 0.05). For 27 (87%) infected patients, increase in CRP level was greater than 25%. Conclusion: This study concludes that CRP is the most useful parameter for the diagnosis of intensive care unit-acquired infections. According to this result, routine measurement of CRP level in intensive care units and follow up the changes in the serum concentration of CRP are recommended.

Type determinations for 24 HR HPV samples were concordant between the SBDPP and HC2. Of the 28 cervical samples identified as HR types, 5 samples were determined to be HPV mixed infections. Conclusion: This feasibility study demonstrates the potential of the SBDPP assay to type patients harbouring HR HPV strains. Genotyping results obtained with the prototype assay are highly comparable to the four-color DNA sequencing data. These findings confirm that a rapid SBDPP method can be used for high-throughput screening of cervical samples for the presence of HR HPV types.M. Dominguez-Gil, R. Ortiz de Lajarazu Leonardo, J. Eiros, A. Curiel, M. Moreno, S. Jimenez, L. Sobrino, I. Gracia, A. Tenorio, C. Labayru, M. Ortega, B. Hernandez, A. Rodriguez Torres (Valladolid, E)Introduction: The large variety of techniques available for detection and subtyping of the multitude of HPV types illustrates the fact that no single technique provides the ultimate and complete solution to this effect. Objective: Explain the diagnostic correlation between the techniques applied to detect HPV DNA and typing in cervical samples from women suspected to have ginecological lession selected to HPV. Methods: A total of 40 genital smears with HPV evidences were selected by a solution hybridisation assay (Hybrid Capture, Digene, Gaithersburg, USA). The applied hybridisation technique classifies the virus on those associated to a low or moderated-high risk of cell transformation. We analysed the agreement between these results and those obtained by PCR and subsequent typing by means of digestion with restriction enzymes (HPVfast, Genomica S.A.U., Madrid, Spain). We used a Papillomavirus Clinical Arrays (Genomica S.A.U., Madrid, Spain). Results: The results obtained by means of hybridisation were distributed as follows: 47.5% of the smears revealed HPV of moderated-high risk of cell transformation, 12.5% was associated to a HPV of low risk of transformation and the remaining 40% were positive on both groups of HPV. PCR revealed the presence of HPV DNA in 40% of analysed smears (N = 40). The 40% of moderated-high risk HPV was not detected by means of PCR. The 15% was not detected by means of DNA Microarray Format (N = 20). The 100% (N = 4) among low-risk HPV and the 75% (N = 16) of those positive for both HPV groups were not detected by means of PCR. The 100% of low-risk HPV and those positive for both HPV groups was detected by means of DNA Microarray Format.Conclusions: The detection of HPV DNA by hybridisation was associated in a greater percentage to positive results than it actually applied to the PCR Technique used. However hybridisation and DNA Microarray Format were in more agreement. The PCR identification technique was not able to detect a signification number of HPV positive samples, mainly on the HPV H-m risk and less for the others. Then there is a better correlation between DNA Microarray Format and DNA hybridisation for detection and subtyping of human papillomavirus and more discrepancies among PCR and hybridation A. Daponte, S. Pournaras, I. Mademtzis, I. Kristo, A.N. Maniatis, I. Messinis (Larissa, GR)Objectives: To evaluate the performance of Human Papillomavirus (HPV) PCR detection in urine compared with cervical swabs, among patients attending a colposcopy unit. The appropriate detection of HPV in urine would serve as a viable alternative for screening and prevention of cervical cancer. Methods: Paired urine and cervical specimens were collected from 60 consecutive patients referred to a colposcopy clinic. Urinalysis and urine microscopy was performed for evaluation of potential PCR inhibitors and specimen epithelial cell content. In-house PCR and a commercial PCR for the detection of HPV 16 and 18, as well as a commercial multiplex PCR for HPV 6, 16, 18, 31 and 33 were performed in all samples. To test the sensitivity of HPV detection in urine, urine samples were spiked with cell lines infected with HPV. Results: The in-house PCR exhibited the highest detection rate. Cervical samples were tested positive for the oncogenic HPV types 16 or 18 in 21 of the 47 (44.7%) cases of women that proved to have pre-malignant or malignant lesion by histology. 14 of the 47 (29.8%) urine samples, with histologically proven premalignant or malignant lesions were positive for HPV16 or 18.",

Ortiz de Lejarazu Leonardo, L. Sobrino, A. Tenorio, I. Gracia, M. Dom\u00ednguez-Gil (Valladolid, E)Objectives: Descriptive, retrospective and observational study to research the incidence of respiratory viruses in our environment and to evaluate the most useful samples and detection methods. Methods: The period of the study was 2000 January to 2004 May. We received 2763 diverse samples registering patient data (sex, age, source); 1694 serum for complement fixation test (CFT) and 1069 diverse samples for rapid detection methods (RDM): ADV), 14. Monthly evolution of samples received and positive cases shows that patterns of serum and the other samples are different. The 1st graphic represents the monthly sending of serum that does not follow a seasonal curve on the contrary than the other samples represented in the 2nd graphic; it occurs the same when we look at the positive results distribution. Samples: Serum was positive in 73 cases; nasopharyngeal wash in 276; pharyngeal smear in 33; Bronchoalveolar wash and tracheal aspirate, 4. Detection methods: CFT was positive in 73 cases; Shell vial culture was positive in 276, but in 132 was the unique method that achieve an isolation; ELFA in 134; DIF in 86; ICT was positive in 11 cases, but was only used since 2004 January. Rapid methods combined accurate 313 positive cases.Conclusions: Children are the most affected by human respiratory viruses, according with the bibliography. RSV and Flu A were the predominant viruses detected. The maximal monthly positively results for respiratory viruses reached in cold season but PIV do not followed a seasonal curve. Rapid detection methods are more sensitive than CFT. Based on these results, we recommend to take nasopharyngeal washes to combine rapid detection methods and accurate the best rate of virus isolation.P1625 Evaluation of a real-time NASBA assay for the detection of influenza A and B viruses in clinical respiratory samples J.N.

Paranhos-Baccal\u00e0 (Marcy l'Etoile, Lyon, F)Objectives: bioM\u00e9rieux is developing a real-time NASBA assay to detect Influenza A and B RNA in different kind of respiratory clinical samples. The Nuclisens EasyQ Influenza A+B assay, in combination with Nuclisens MiniMag sample preparation system, was evaluated on 89 nasal/throat swabs from hospitalized children during 2003/2004 influenza season at the Paediatric Emergency Department of Edouard Herriot hospital (HEH-Lyon, France). The assay is designed to detect in a single tube, a wide range of both Influenza A and B viruses by targeting conserved regions of the genome. The aim of this study was to evaluate the real-time NASBA sensitivity against classical cell culture method. Methods: 89 Nasal/throat swabs in transport medium from children 0 to 16 years age were used for the evaluation of Influenza viruses presence. RNA extraction was performed using the bioM\u00e9rieux Nuclisens MiniMag instrument and reagents. Extracted RNA were submitted to NASBA amplification and detection using the Nuclisens EasyQ Influenza A+B assay. The obtained data were analysed by Nuclisens Director 2.0 software. The results were then compared to the cell culture results already performed on the samples. Results: To be confident in the sensitivity of real-time NASBA assay, we showed that no interference was observed with Influenza A and B strains spiked in different negative swabs. Among 89 swabs tested in this study, real-time NASBA detected 10 (11.2%) samples for Influenza A and 2 (2.2%) samples for Influenza B. Comparatively, by cell culture method only 5 (5.6%) samples were identified as Influenza A and none as Influenza B. Interestingly, 1 Influenza A positive sample identified by cell culture was found negative in real-time NASBA. Conclusion: In this study, we showed that Nuclisens EasyQ Influenza A+B assay detected 50% more Influenza A virus than cell culture method. Moreover, real-time NASBA detected 2 Influenza B positive samples which were not detected by cell culture. In conclusion, our Nuclisens EasyQ Influenza A+B assay demonstrated clinical relevance in samples from hospitalized children suffering from respiratory diseases.

Mertens (Antwerp, B)Introduction: Parainfluenzavirus (PI) is a paramyxovirus causing acute respiratory illness, mostly in children. Four human PI have been described, PIV-I and PIV-II tend to produce epidemics in autumn and early winter, PIV-III has peak activity in spring and summer. PIV-IV usually causes mild upper respiratory disease. Objectives: To evaluate the indirect immunofluorescence assay (IIF) with pooled PI-I, II & III monoclonal antibodies (MAB) (Chemicon International) performed directly on respiratory specimens as compared to conventional shell vial culture (SVC) on VERO cells. Methods: 2272 nasopharyngeal aspirates of children presenting with respiratory symptoms between January 2002 and June 2004 were processed. PI detection was done with both the IIF performed directly on the specimen and IFF after SVC on VERO cells. Simultaneous detection of other common respiratory viruses was done using the appropriate techniques. Results: PI was detected in 116/2272 (5.1%)samples. 86 PI were detected by IFF performed directly on the sample (sensitivity 74.1%). In 5 IFF positive samples, no virus could be detected by the conventional SVC (specificity 99.8%). Positive (94.5%) and negative (98.6%) predictive values were excellent. Conclusion: IIF performed directly on respiratory specimens may prove to be a valuable technique for rapid PI detection in children presenting with respiratory illness, given the high specificity and predictive values of the test. Negative IFF results should be confirmed by conventional detection methods.",

            "text": "Objective: Cytomegalovirus is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in transplant patients. Efforts have focused on identifying patients at risk for disease (especially D+R-) before the onset of symptoms, in order to start pre-emptive antiviral treatment. In this study, we evaluated the use of quantitative real-time Taqman PCR on whole blood versus isolation of CMV from urine and respiratory tract specimens. Methods: 71 lung-transplant recipients were prospectively studied. At 400 time points PCR and rapid detection of CMV by shell vial assay (SVA, urine and throat) were performed on linked samples. Results: Concordance of the three test results was obtained in 76% (negative in 69%, positive in 7%). In 12.5% of the samples studied, PCR was positive with negative isolations. In 5.5% a negative PCR was obtained, with at least one positive isolation. Positivity of only one isolation site combined with a positive PCR was observed in a minority of cases (5% urine, 1% throat). Patients with consecutive low copy numbers in PCR ((500 c/ml) had intermittently positive isolations, with the best concordance between urine isolation and viral load. Rarely, isolations remained completely negative. For patients with continuously positive viral loads, there was a good correlation of PCR and isolations, although occasionally an isolation remained negative. In only 2 patients (both R+) three consecutive positive urine cultures were observed, with a negative viral load. For both patients there was no evidence of CMV disease. Other discordances between PCR (negative) and isolation (positive) were preceded or followed by positive PCR. Conclusions: In this patient population of lung-transplant recipients, viral load and virus isolation in urine were highly concordant.",

Corris (Newcastle upon Tyne, UK)Description: CMV is a major cause of mortality and morbidity in transplant (tx) recipients. We commence weekly Quantitative CMV PCR (QPCR) surveillance on our CMV positive (+) recipients four weeks post-tx for three months. The CMV mismatch (MM) recipients commence weekly QPCR for three months, two weeks after the cessation of prophylactic ganciclovir (GCV), which is given for the first three months post-tx in this group. CMV ( recipients receive no prophylaxis. During the surveillance period, pre-emptive therapy (Rx) with oral GCV is given if QPCR is (1 \u00b7 10 4 copies/ml and the patient is asymptomatic. IV GCV is given in symptomatic patients above this cutoff. Objectives: 1. To estblish whether there is a correlation between clinical symptoms associated with CMV disease and the viral load of CMV. 2. To review the present viral load cut-off above which pre-emptive Rx is considered in asymptomatic patients to prevent development of disease. Methods: We conducted a prospective analysis of patients' notes who underwent lung tx between Novemeber 2001 and November 2003. Thirty eight patients (>18 years) and one patient (<18 years) who survived six months were included in the study. Results: Of all the patients, six remained QPCR negative throughout the study (3 CMV MM, 3 CMV+). Twelve patients had low level QPCR levels, 10 3 -10 4 copies/ml, of which one MM patient developed symptoms and required pre-emtpive Rx. Eleven patients had QPCR levels of 10 4 -10 5 copies/ml, of which 4 (1 MM, 3 CMV+) received IV GCV for symptomatic disease. Nine patients had QPCR levels (10 5 copies/ml (4MM, 5 CMV+) of which 3 received treatment for symptomatic disease. Conclusions: We did not find any association between viral load level and development of CMV disease. Only 9 patients developed CMV disease requiring treatment, whereas 23 patients had raised QPCR levels with no disease. This data suggests that our current cut off of (10 4 copies/ml is appropriate for the initiation of pre-emptive therapy in asymptomatic patients and is effective in preventing disease.",

Torres (Hercules, USA)Objectives: Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is a ubiquitous pathogen in humans. CMV infection can be asymptomatic in immunocompetent adults, or life threatening in newborns and immunocompromised individuals. CMV IgM is a sensitive and specific indicator of on-going and recent infection, but may not be specific for primary infection due to the persistence of CMV IgM in some adults. IgG avidity testing has been useful in identifying and excluding non-acute infection when the IgM tests were discrepant (R. Kaul. et al. J. Clin. Microbiol. in press). We developed a CMV IgM assay specifically to detect IgM antibody to CMV using Bio-Rad's fully automated, random access BioPlex 2200 immunoassay analyzer (BioPlex) which measures multianalytes in a single test. This study examines the performance of the BioPlex CMV IgM assay in conjunction with a CMV IgM assay and an avidity test. Objectives: Staphylococcus epidermidis is a potential cause of nosocomial infection, and its pathogenicity is related to its ability to form a biofilm. The aim of this study was to assess the variation in biofilm density of Staphylococcus epidermidis strains (including the reference strain RP62A) at different concentrations and in different atmospheres. Methods: Staphylococcus epidermidis strains were cultured overnight in typtone soya broth with an additional 0.25% w/v glucose (TSB). Sterile flat-bottomed polystyrene 96-well cell culture plates were prepared with 100 ll of fresh TSB in 10 columns. 100 ll of overnight culture was added to an empty column, and serial dilutions performed in the TSB containing wells, with 100 ll discarded from the final dilution. One column was left blank as a reference. The plates were then incubated at 36\u00b0C for 20 hours before the wells were emptied by pipette, washed three times in 200 ll phosphate-buffered saline and air dried. They were then stained with 0.4% crystal violet solution for ten minutes before rinsing under gently running water. Biofilm density was measured as the optical density at 450 nm (OD > 0.12, weak positive; OD > 0.24, strong positive). 200 ll of 1:100 dilutions of overnight culture were added to the columns of 2 96-well plates. One set was incubated in normal atmosphere and the other in a 5% carbon dioxide enhanced atmosphere. Biofilm density was assessed as above. Each experiment was repeated three times. Results: For most strains the biofilm density of the serial dilutions remained approximately constant at dilutions above 1:4, although some showed a gradual reduction in density above this level. One strain showed a pronounced drop in biofilm density between 1:8 and 1:32 dilution. Eight of fifteen strains showed biofilm positive results above 1:4 dilution in all three repeats.Nine of fifteen strains showed increased biofilm densities in a normal atmosphere while four strains showed increased density in when grown in the presence of elevated carbon dioxide. Two strains did not show statistically significant (Mann-Whitney test) overall differences. Conclusion: This study shows that the biofilm density of some Staphylococcus epidermidis strains are affected by the dilution, and hence inoculum size, and the atmosphere. The results vary in a strain dependant manner. Objectives: Staphylococcus epidermidis is a potential cause of nosocomial infection, and its ability to form a biofilm is important in pathogenicity. This study was designed to evaluate the change in biofilm density of clinical isolates and the reference strain RP62A in the presence of an iron source and the iron chelator desferrioxamine. Methods: Staphylococcus epidermidis strains were cultured overnight in typtone soya broth with an additional 0.25% w/v glucose (TSB). Overnight cultures were diluted 1:50 in fresh TSB, and 100 ll used to seed the columns of sterile flat-bottomed polystyrene 96-well cell culture plates. Serial dilutions of Sigma iron supplement were prepared from a maximum of 4 ml/l and 100 ll added to the wells. This gave 1:100 dilutions of staphylococci with reducing concentrations of iron supplement from 2 ml/l. A reference control was provided by a 1:100 dilution without iron supplement. After 20 hours incubation the plates were washed in triplicate in phosphate buffered saline and stained with crystal violet. Biofilm density was assessed by recording the optical density at 450 nm (OD > 0.12, weak positive; OD > 0.24, strong positive). Some of the strong positive strains were tested in the presence of desferrioxamine with 2 ml/l iron supplement in the same manner as above, together with set of replicates without iron supplement. Results: 3/15 strains were biofilm negative at all iron concentrations. 2/15 strains gave weak positive to negative results at all iron concentrations. 4/15 strains were weak to strong positive without iron, and showed maximum biofilm density at 1.0 ml/l of iron supplement. The remaining 6/15 were strong positive and showed maximum density at 2 ml/l. Three of these strains were tested with desferrioxamine and showed increased density in the presence of the iron chelator. Conclusions: Iron supplementation increases the biofilm density of biofilm positive Staphylococcus epidermidis strains. Some strains show increased biofilm density in the presence of desferrioxamine. Even though desferrioxamine has previously been shown to inhibit the growth of S. epidermidis, it may be acting as a staphylococcal siderophore. Objectives: Staphylococcus epidermidis is a potential cause of nosocomial infection, and its pathogenicity is related to its ability to form a biofilm. The antibiotic vancomycin is often used to treat Gram-positive infections, although resistance can be found in some staphylococcal strains. The aim of this study was to assess the change in biofilm density of a variety of clinical isolates and the reference strain RP62A in the presence of vancomycin. Methods: Biofilm forming Staphylococcus epidermidis strains were cultured overnight in typtone soya broth with an additional 0.25% w/v glucose (TSB). Overnight cultures were",
