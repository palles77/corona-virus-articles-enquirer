However, the effects of cellular lipids on rotavirus assembly are still not fully understood. The present study analyzes the effects of lovastatin, an inhibitor of cholesterol biosynthesis, during rotavirus infection in MA104 cells with regard to viral growth and particle assembly. Following viral infection, a 2-log relative reduction of viral titers was observed in drug-treated cells, while viral mRNA levels in infected cells remained unaltered in both groups. Furthermore, the levels of some viral proteins in drug-treated cells were elevated. The observed discordance between the viral RNA and protein levels and the decrease in infectivity titers of viral progeny in the drug-treated cells suggested that the drug affects viral assembly, the viral proteins not being properly incorporated into virions. Transmission electron microscopic (TEM) analysis revealed that in drug-treated cells there was an increase in ''empty-looking'' rotavirus particles devoid of an electron-dense core as compared to the normal, electron-dense particles seen in untreated infected cells. The present study thus provides visual evidence of defective rotavirus particle assembly as a result of cholesterol depletion.",

As lipids are major constituents of the cell membrane, it is not surprising that they are implicated in cell entry mechanisms of many viruses such as the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), coronavirus, and the Semliki Forest virus (SFV), to name a few [14, 19, 20, 35] . Besides being involved in viral entry at the membrane level, cellular lipids are also essential for many intracellular processes of viral proteins such as post-translational fatty acid modifications (e.g., acylation, myristylation, palmitoylation and prenylation) and also play an important role in enveloped virus assembly and protein trafficking [1, 10, 15, 34] .",

            "text": "As lipids are critical to the biology of enveloped viruses, some of these viruses modulate the host-cell lipid metabolism to their advantage, by up-or down-regulating their lipid synthesis [2, 8, 16, 28] . However, recent reports have demonstrated the involvement of lipids in the cell biology of a non-enveloped, double-stranded RNA virus, the rotavirus, as well [3, 5, 6, 13, 33] . Rotavirus belongs to the family Reoviridae and is the leading etiological agent causing viral gastroenteritis in humans and animals [18, 31] . Parashar et al. [32] estimated a mean of 611,000 (range 454,000-705,000) deaths from rotavirus disease worldwide per annum. The role of lipids in rotaviral entry, specific lipid binding of the viral proteins, association of infectious virions or rotaviral proteins within lipid rafts for assembly, and release have all been documented [3-6, 13, 17, 29, 33] . Noteworthy among these studies are the ones that clearly underlined the role of lipid rafts in rotavirus biology by demonstrating that the viral proteins as well as the triple-layered infectious particle associate with rafts, both in culture and in cells of experimentally infected animals, and that the assembly of VP4 into the viral particle occurs as an extra-ER event [3] [4] [5] [6] 33] . Recently Delmas et al. [6] reported distinct differences in raft-type membrane microdomains between Caco-2 cells and another cell line, MA104 (monkey kidney epithelial cells), the two most commonly used cell lines for studying rotavirus replication in vitro. The present study demonstrates the effect of cholesterol depletion on rotavirus titers and assembly in MA104 cells by utilizing lovastatin, which inhibits HMG CoA reductase, the rate-limiting enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis. Our analysis revealed that while the drug treatment apparently reduces rotavirus titers in MA104 cells, transmission electron microscopy showed that the cholesterol-lowering drug has a profound effect on virus assembly and results in accumulation of defective, ''empty-looking'' particles inside the cell.",

Virus particles were extracted from infected cells by repeated freeze-thawing and then clarified by centrifugation at 3,0009g for 30 min. Virus particles in the supernatant were pelleted by centrifugation through a 40% sucrose cushion in a Beckman SW55 rotor for 90 min at 25,0009g. RNA was extracted using RNA-Stat (Tel-Test Inc., Friendswood, TX) as described previously (22, 23) . RT-PCR was performed to detect the levels of gene segments coding for one of the rotavirus structural proteins, VP7, and a non-structural protein, NSP4, using appropriate pairs of primers. RNA levels were semiquantitated by the end-point dilution method. The VP7 RNA segment was amplified using a set of forward (5 0 -CGCGGATCCGGCTTTAAAGAGAGAATTTCC-3 0 ) and reverse (5 0 -GATCTCGAGGGTCACATCGAACAAT TCTAA-3 0 ) primers, whereas the NSP4 gene was amplified using a set of previously published primers for SA11 [25] .",

In order to evaluate the effects of lovastatin on rotavirus RNA levels within cells (a) and in purified viral particles (b), RT-PCR was performed to detect the levels of rotavirus VP7 gene by the end-point dilution method. Serial twofold dilutions of the viral RNA were carried out for the analysis. Intracellular viral RNA levels were comparatively similar in both the drug-treated and control groups (a). On the other hand, purified particles (containing a mixture of complete and incomplete particles) reveal a drastic reduction of RNA levels in this mixed population of virus particles derived from the drug-treated cells (b). This indicates that the empty particles may be devoid of any viral RNA. Molecular weights (in base pairs) are indicated on the left side of the image treated and control groups, electron micrographs of areas containing both populations of particles were taken at random per cell. Micrographs were printed at a magnification of approximately 60,0009 and coded to blind the study, and the viral particles were counted and classified. A total of 1,663 particles were counted in 6 micrographs of normal cells. Of these, 1,392 (84%) had a dense core and 271 (16%) lacked the dense core. In the lovastatin-treated cells, out of a total of 1016 particles counted from 6 micrographs, 641 (63%) had dense cores and 375 (37%) were ''empty-looking'' particles lacking the electron-dense core.

Three different representative micrographs each of virus extracted from normal and drug-treated MA104 cells are indicated here. Virus extracts purified from normal MA104 cells contain more characteristic normal rotavirus particles that contain an electron-dense core (indicated by filled arrows). Virus material extracted from drug-treated cells demonstrates an increase in the number of 'emptylooking' particles that lack an electron-dense core (indicated by open arrows). A specific area of the micrograph (indicated by a line arrow) is magnified as an inset image for greater resolution. Magnification bar represents 100 nm infected cell. In this report, to investigate whether there was any difference in the availability of viral structural proteins and the non-structural proteins for virus assembly following lovastatin treatment, we selected VP4, which represents a viral structural protein and NSP2, as a representative non-structural protein, to measure viral protein levels. A reduction in the levels of either of these proteins would have indicated a direct effect on virus assembly and infectivity. However, the present analysis revealed an increase in viral protein levels following lovastatin treatment, which was unexpected and suggested that although the viral proteins were readily available in abundance, due to a mechanism that has not yet been identified, rotaviral assembly was being negatively affected. A very similar effect had been reported previously with Rous sarcoma virus infectivity in cells treated with another lipid-reducing agent, cerulenin [11] . However, in this case too, the underlying mechanism is not known.",

In contrast, the current study presents visual evidence of the effects of cellular lipidlowering, drug-mediated perturbations in rotavirus biology related to virus assembly.",
