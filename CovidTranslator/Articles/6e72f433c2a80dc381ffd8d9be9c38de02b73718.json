This novel CoV(SARS-CoV-2) has caused a national outbreak of severe pneumonia in China, and rapidly spreads around the world. This indicates that SARS-CoV-2 can directly invade the nervous system of patients, instead of injuring the nervous system through the immune response to SARS-CoV-2. This is the first evidence that SARS-CoV-2 has directly invaded the nervous system.",
