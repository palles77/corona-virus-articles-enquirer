Here, we compared Mpros from SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV. Despite a high level of sequence similarity, the binding sites of analysed proteins show major differences in both shape and size indicating that repurposing SARS drugs for COVID-19 may be futile. Furthermore, the analysis of the pockets' conformational changes during the simulation time indicates their flexibility, which dashes hopes for rapid and reliable drug design. Conversely, structural stability of the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro with respect to mutations of the binding cavity and adjacent flexible loops indicates that the protein's mutability will pose a further challenge to the rational design of small-molecule inhibitors. However, few residues contribute significantly to the protein stability and thus can be considered as key anchoring residues for Mpro inhibitor design.",

            "text": "In December 2019, the first atypical pneumonia outbreak associated with the novel coronavirus of zoonotic origin (SARS-CoV-2) appeared in Wuhan, China 1 . In humans, coronaviruses usually cause mild to moderate upper-respiratory tract illnesses, however, the rarer forms of coronaviruses can be lethal. Based on the genomic data analysis of SARS-CoV-2, Zhang et al. indicated that it is closely related to two SARS-CoV sequences isolated from bats in 2015 and 2017 2 . One of the key enzymes in the life cycle of coronaviruses is the main protease (Mpro). Together with non-structural proteins and the spike glycoprotein, it is essential for interactions between the virus and host cell receptors during viral entry 3 . While 12 residues differ between both coronaviruses, only one, namely S46 in SARS-CoV-2 (A46 in SARS-CoV), is located in the proximity of the entrance to the active site (Fig. 1A) . Such a small structural change would not be expected to substantially affect the binding of small molecules 4 and would suggest that repurposing SARS drugs against COVID-19 may be fruitful. To this day, several in silico attempts have been made, including a massive virtual screening (VS) for SARS-CoV-2 Mpro inhibitors using Deep Docking 5 and only the clinically approved drugs [6] [7] [8] . Regrettably, as we show, this strategy is not likely to succeed.",

The maximal accessible volume (MAV) of the binding cavities during the simulation time and the overall distribution of solvent in the protein's interior were inspected using ligand tracking approach 11 . Surprisingly, despite their high similarity (Fig. 1A) , the binding cavities of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 Mpros show significantly different MAV. Both proteins reduce their MAV upon inhibitor binding approximately 20%, but the maximal volume of SARS-CoV is over 50% larger than those of SARS-CoV-2 (Fig. 1B) . It is also worth noting that, despite the differences in size and shape between both Mpros binding cavities, the local solvent distribution approach always detects the highest water density next to the H41 residue, reflecting the position of a catalytic water of Mpro replacing the missing third catalytic site amino acid (Fig. 1B) . These findings 10 are supported by the movements of loops that regulate the active sites' accessibility in Mpros. We found that the C44-P52 loop of the SARS-CoV Mpro is more flexible than the corresponding loop of the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro, while the adjacent loops are mildly flexible (Fig. 1C) . It is worth adding, that this loop is carrying the unique SARS-CoV-2 Mpro residue S46. These results indicate a serious obstacle for Structure-Based Drug Design which focuses mostly on the similarities between the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 Mpros and might ignore the fact that the actual available binding space differs significantly. Therefore, repurposing SARS drugs against COVID-19 may not be successful due to major shape and size differences, and despite docking methods, the enhanced sampling should be considered.",

The combination of local solvent distribution and ligand tracking approach provided identification of those regions of the Mpros structures that attract molecular probes (so-called global hot-spots describing the intramolecular voids of the protein, and the local hot-spots describing the binding cavity). The largest number and the densest hot-spots are located within the binding cavity and the region essential for Mpros dimerisation 12 , between the II and III domains. In both Mpros the binding cavity is particularly occupied by urea and benzene molecules, which is especially interesting, due to the fact that these solvents exhibit different chemical properties. The general distribution of the global hot-spots from particular cosolvents is quite similar and verifies specific interactions with the particular regions of the analysed proteins. A notable number of hot-spots are located around the amino acids that vary between the SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV Mpros (Fig. 1D) . The benzene hot-spots for the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro structure are localised also deep inside the active site cavity, while SARS-CoV Mpro features mostly benzene hot-spots at the cavity entrance (Fig. 1E ). This is interesting since, in the absence of cosolvent molecules, the water accessible volume for SARS-CoV-2 Mpro was 50% smaller than in the case of SARS-CoV Mpro, underlining huge plasticity of the binding cavity and suggesting large conformational changes induced by interaction with a potential ligand. It is also interesting, that both global and local hot-spots of the SARS-CoV Mpro structure are located in the proximity of the C44-P52 loop, which potentially regulates the access to the active site.",

The future changes in Mpros structures can dash the effort applied for drug discovery. Indeed, the analysis of evolutionary-correlated residues shows that they are dispersed throughout the structure (Fig. 1E) . Among them, we identified also those that differ between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV Mpros, located on the C44-P52 loop (regulating access to the binding site) and the F185-T201 linker loop (contributing to Mpro dimerization 13 ). The correlated mutation analysis indicate that Q189 from the linker loop correlates with residues from the C44-P52 loop, whereas R188, A191, and A194 correlate with selected residues from all domains, but not with the C44-P52 loop. To further evaluate the effect of the 12 amino acid replacements on the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro structure stability, we calculated the differences in Gibbs free energies of protein folding corresponding to the wild-type. The replacements were found to stabilise the protein's folding (e.g., H134F: -0.85 kcal/mol) or have almost neutral character (e.g., R88K, S94A, T285A, I286L). Such a result was expected, since for successful virus transformation both stability and the performance of the Mpro have to be sustained. To examine the potential risk of further Mpro structure evolution we simulated the single nucleotide substitutions process to the SARS-CoV-2 main protease gene. If a substitution of a single nucleotide caused translation to a different amino acid than the corresponding residue in the wild-type structure, an appropriate mutation was proposed and the differences in Gibbs free energies of protein folding were calculated. A close look at residues located within 7\u212b from the N3 inhibitor suggests that mutations of residues that contribute to ligand binding or access to the active site are energetically favourable, likely to occur (Fig. 1F) . Some of the residues that are prone to mutate would provide the inactive enzyme (e.g., the residues forming the catalytic dyad), but others (e.g., amino acids from the C44-P52 loop, T45, S46, E47, L50) could significantly modify the inhibitors binding mode of Mpro.",

However, our results indicate also residues that are energetically unfavourable to mutate (P39, R40, P52, G143, G146, L167) and they could provide an anchor for successful drug design that can outlast coronavirus Mpros variability in future.

The systems preparation protocol and simulation conditions were taken from the previous work 15 (pH set to 7.4). AQUA-DUCT software was employed to inspect the MAV of the binding cavities during the simulation time and the overall distribution of solvent in the protein's interior. The region of interest was defined as a 5\u00c5 sphere around the centre of geometry of the active site residues (H41, C145, H164, D187), and molecules of interest were traced within the interior of a convex hull of the protein's atoms. Various cosolvents: acetonitrile, benzene, dimethylsulfoxide, methanol, phenol, and urea were used as molecular probes to investigate the most probable interaction sites of both apo Mpro structures. A total of 600 ns of MixMD simulations (protocol as for the cMD, the heating stage extended to 40 ps) were performed and ligand tracking approach was used to identify regions in which cosolvent molecules are being trapped and or/caged, located within the protein itself (global hot-spots) and inside the binding cavity (local hot-spots).",
