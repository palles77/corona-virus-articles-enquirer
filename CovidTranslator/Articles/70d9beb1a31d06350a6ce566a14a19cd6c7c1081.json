Nevertheless, uncertainty persists concerning the relative benefits of inducing mucosal vs systemic immunity to host survival following inhalational exposure to anthrax spores. This work examines the effect of delivering the licensed human vaccine (Anthrax Vaccine Adsorbed, AVA) combined with a CpG oligodeoxynucleotide (ODN) adjuvant intraperitoneally or intranasally to A/J mice. Results indicate that protection from inhalational anthrax correlates with the induction of a strong systemic rather than mucosal immune response, and demonstrate that protection is significantly improved and accelerated by the addition of CpG ODN.",

B. anthracis spores are highly resistant to environmental degradation, and upon germination produce a tripartite toxin that reduces the ability of the host's immune system to eliminate the pathogen [1] . Human exposure to anthrax typically arises following contact with infected livestock, and generally results in a mild form of cutaneous disease [2] . In contrast, inhalational exposure to anthrax causes severe and rapidly progressive disease that can culminate in death [3;4] . Anthrax Vaccine Adsorbed (AVA) is the only anthrax vaccine licensed for human use in the US and was approved based on it's ability to reduce susceptibility to cutaneous anthrax exposure. The release of anthrax spores designed for aerosol delivery by bioterrorists in 2001, and the resultant morbidity, mortality, and panic, underscored the need to improve the speed and efficacy of vaccine-induced protection against inhalational exposure [5] .",

After thorough washing, bound Abs were detected by adding HRP-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG or IgA (Southern Biotechnology, Birmingham, AL) followed by ABTS substrate (Kirkegaard & Perry, Gaithersburg, MD). Ab titers were determined by comparison to a standard curve generated using pooled sera from hyperimmunized mice, and were expressed as the reciprocal of the end point dilution following background subtraction.

            "text": "Current findings support several additional conclusions. First, intraperitoneal immunization induced a higher systemic but lower mucosal Ab response than did intranasal immunization (Table I and Figs 1,2) . Second, the addition of CpG ODN significantly increased the magnitude of the anti-PA response elicited by both routes of immunization (Tables I, 2 and Figs 1, 2 and 5). Finally, the addition of CpG ODN to AVA significantly reduced host susceptibility to infection by aerosolized anthrax within 5 days of administration (Fig 5) . Results indicate that this effect was not mediated through the induction of an innate immune response by CpG ODN, since none of the mice treated with CpG ODN alone survived challenge. Rather, we hypothesize that survival was influenced by the cumulative serum anti-PA response over the course of infection rather than solely at the time of pathogen exposure. Thus, vaccines capable of accelerating the induction of protective Abs when the host is subsequently infected may reduce morbidity and mortality long after the initial Ab response has waned. Studies designed to test this hypothesis, and determine whether co-administering CpG-adjuvanted AVA plus antibiotics can protect mice immediately after anthrax exposure, are underway.",

Previous studies showed that combining CpG ODN with systemically administered AVA accelerated and increased the production of serum IgG anti-PA Abs, thereby improving protection against systemic anthrax challenge [16;19] . Results from a phase I clinical study showed that adding CpG ODN to AVA boosted the serum IgG anti-PA responses of normal human volunteers by 6\u22128 fold and accelerated the induction of immunity by approximately 3 weeks (p. <.001 for both parameters) [27] . In that trial, no significant difference was reported in the frequency of severe adverse events in recipients of AVA plus CpG ODN vs AVA alone, although mild-moderate adverse events (including pain, warmth, and swelling at the injection site, and systemic effects such as fever and fatigue) were slightly more frequent in the former group [27] .",

They also indicate that serum Ab titers may provide a surrogate marker for protection against aerosolized anthrax spores. The combination of AVA plus CpG ODN significantly increased anti-PA Ab titers and accelerated the induction of protective immunity (conferring a significant increase in survival within 5 days of vaccination). Following the 2001 anthrax attacks, less than half of potentially exposed individuals completed the recommended course of antibiotics [28] . Thus, vaccinating individuals at risk of exposure to anthrax with CpG-adjuvanted AVA, perhaps in combination with short-term antibiotic therapy, might prevent pathogen dissemination and optimize the speed and reliability with which these individuals develop a protective immune response. In mice, this protection developed even before serum Ab titers began to rise, indicating that the magnitude of the Ab response over the course of the infection rather than solely at the time of challenge determines host survival.",
