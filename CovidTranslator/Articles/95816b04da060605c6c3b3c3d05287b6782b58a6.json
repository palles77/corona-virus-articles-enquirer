            "text": "Stress and immunosuppression are often underlying factors for many diseases affecting captive crocodilians. Stress has been defined as \"a physiological answer to a perceived threat that includes, but is not restricted to, increased adrenal secretion.\" 1 Stress is also thought of as any event that challenges homeostasis, and likely the response to that challenge involves more than an adrenal response. The autonomic nervous system, the hypothalamic adrenal axis, neuropeptides, neurotransmitters, and neuroimmunologic mediators all have a role in the response of the immune system to stress. 2 Studies in crocodilians have evaluated the stress associated with restraint, long-term corticosterone implants, cold shock, and stocking densities. 3-6 Lance et al. provide an overview of the physiology and endocrinology of stress in crocodilians. 7 Catecholamines, glucocorticoids, glucose, and lactate have been implicated in the stress response of crocodilians. In addition, an argument is made for immunosuppression on the basis of changes observed in the white blood cells. [3] [4] [5] 7 Factors that influence stress in crocodilian and reptile species are reviewed by Rooney and Guillette. 1 Enough evidence exists to suggest that stress plays an important role in the physiology of crocodilians, and it may indeed predispose them to illness. Overcrowding, handling, excessive noise, diet changes, water and air quality, temperature irregularities, and more should all be considered as predisposing or confounding factors of disease.",

In commercial operations, the workers may notice excess food remaining from the day before, which is sometimes followed by a perceived change in the behavior of the animals. One should not underestimate these observations because most workers are well tuned to the daily routine and behavior of the animals. A visit to the ranch or farm should be performed during feeding time to avoid additional stress to the animals. This also allows observation of the feeding and water change practices. At this time, a thorough history and a collection of animals for diagnostics and necropsy can be obtained.

Conversely, if a thermostat fails, allowing the heater to remain on, the animals' behavior may change because of increased temperatures.

However, dystocia (egg binding) can lead to a more prolonged anorexia that may be the first indication that the animal is ill. Unless the actual mating date is known or the reproductive cycle is monitored by ultrasonography, it can be very difficult to ascertain what constitutes true dystocia. In animals housed outdoors in their natural climate, dystocia should be considered if oviposition has not occurred for 30 days past the expected date. For those housed indoors or outside their natural climate, behavior together with plasma biochemistry, hematology, and diagnostic imaging can be used to aid in the diagnosis of dystocia. Secondary nutritional hyperparathyroidism can also cause animals to be lethargic and anorexic. This is more common in juvenile animals. Older animals may succumb to secondary renal hyperparathyroidism.",

Resolution of clinical signs was observed 6 weeks after improvement of husbandry in one case 19 and after 5 months in another case, with no changes in husbandry. 20 Lesions in crocodiles are described as 2-to 8-mm-diameter, yellow to brown, wartlike, sometimes firm, and unraised to raised nodules with occasional shallow ulcers. These lesions can be found on the head, palpebrae, nostrils, sides of the mouth, oral cavity, limbs, ventral neck, and coelom and at the root of the tail. 21, 22 Resolution of lesions was reported to occur as early as 3 to 4 weeks. 21 Light microscopy reveals epithelial hyperplasia, acanthosis, hyperkeratosis, and necrosis, and at times Borrel and Bollinger's bodies are also visible. [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] Secondary bacterial and fungal infections may also be present.

            "text": "Integumentary disease is often secondary to poor water quality, poor enclosure design, stress, and immunosuppression or a combination of these factors. Lacerations, abscesses, and draining tracts can all be observed in captive and wild crocodilians. Consequently, these open wounds can serve as a nidus for bacteria and fungi. An additional factor in commercial operations or small enclosures is the accumulation of a fatty slime layer on the surface of the water when meat supplements, in particular chicken, are fed in addition to a dry commercial diet. This slime attaches to the skin of the animals and the enclosure, creating an environment for bacterial and fungal growth. The same is true for accumulation of biofilm on the surface of the enclosure. A soap or detergent can be used as a surfactant to help reduce the fatty layer on the water surface. Any product used must be nontoxic, or the animals must be removed from the enclosure while in use. Fungal dermatitis is also common because many fungi thrive in the water column and environment of captive alligators. In most instances, both bacteria and fungi are present in skin lesions. Culture and sensitivity testing can be frustrating in these cases because of the mixed flora found in the lesions. The first step in addressing integumentary abnormalities is to analyze water quality and make improvements as needed. In addition to improvements in water quality, antimicrobial or antifungal therapy may be necessary. Medicating a large group of crocodilians is challenging because it must usually be done orally by mixing the medication with feed. In zoos or private collections, individual crocodilians can be medicated by injecting the prey item or via injection. A pole syringe can be used in large or aggressive animals. There is a lack of pharmacokinetic data for oral antimicrobials in crocodilians, and it has been shown that oral tetracycline is not effectively absorbed in American alligators. 15 These factors pose a challenge for effective treatment and the potential for promoting antimicrobial resistance. Therefore a combination of good hygiene, water treatments with disinfectants, and improved husbandry is recommended.",

Clinical signs associated with respiratory disease in crocodilians may include dyspnea, tachypnea, nasal discharge, excessive basking, abnormal swimming (either in circles or on one side of the body), and anorexia, among others. As the animals become weak, the basihyoid valve does not function properly and they can aspirate food or water. The pharyngeal anatomy of crocodilians makes aspiration unlikely in healthy animals. Therefore, if aspiration is suspected, evaluation for an underlying illness should be pursued. A number of rhinitis and pharyngitis syndromes have also been described in some crocodilian species. 13 Most respiratory infections are either bacterial or fungal in origin.

Accumulations of fibrous material or necrotizing lesions are commonly seen on necropsy (Fig. 136.10A and B ). This reaction is aggressive and can even lead to obstructions caused by the fibrous material. Obstruction can also occur with fecal impactions and torsions. Gastric ulcerations and abnormalities of the gastric mucosa are also routinely observed on necropsy and may be associated with stress and diet. Finally, the intestinal tract contains a large amount of Peyer's",
