            "text": "A cute colitis is a common cause of rapid debilitation and death in horses. More than 90% of untreated horses with this condition die or are euthanized, but horses that are treated appropriately usually respond and gradually recover over a 7-to 14-day period. Colitis-associated diarrhea is sporadic in occurrence and is characterized by intraluminal sequestration of fluid, moderate to severe colic, and profuse watery diarrhea, with resultant endotoxemia, leukopenia, and hypovolemia. The condition can affect adult horses of all ages but usually affects horses 2 to 10 years of age. Disease onset is sudden, and progression is rapid. The condition is often preceded by a stressful event. A definitive diagnosis is made in only about 20% of cases. Most antemortem and postmortem tests to determine etiology do not yield a definitive diagnosis.",

Under normal conditions, water and electrolytes are secreted by epithelial cells in the intestinal crypts, and most of this fluid is reabsorbed by the surface epithelial cells. Abnormal rates of secretion and absorption result in massive secretion and malabsorption by large intestinal mucosal epithelial cells, leading to severe dehydration and death.",

In contrast to other domestic animals and humans, horses have sudden, massive fluid loss and severe electrolyte imbalances that can result in death in hours. This distinctive clinical presentation in horses may result from several unique features of the large bowel of Equidae. Some of these include the large population of gram-negative endotoxin-bearing bacteria that reside in the large intestine and the markedly high mucosal prostaglandin concentrations, manifested by a marked chloride secretory response, compared with other species. Another possible reason for the distinctive clinical signs is the intense inflammation that results from activation of resident intestinal mucosal and submucosal phagocytic granulocytes by intestinal bacterial products after mucosal barrier disruption.",

It is important to rule out Salmonella spp-associated colitis because these organisms pose a risk for infection to other animals and constitute a potential zoonotic hazard. Because Salmonella organisms are often shed intermittently, five consecutive fecal samples (weighing 5 g or more) for culture and sensitivity or three consecutive fecal samples for polymerase chain reaction (PCR), 1 collected at 24-hour intervals, should be submitted. Neorickettsia risticii, the causative agent of Potomac horse fever, causes biphasic fever, laminitis, and colitis of variable severity. The disease is widespread in many parts of the United States, especially California and the mid-Atlantic states, and in Canada and Europe, with the highest prevalence of disease observed in horses residing in proximity to freshwater ponds and streams. In temperate climates, disease is most common during late spring through early fall. The diagnosis of N risticii-associated colitis may be supported by comparing paired serum titers using immunofluorescence assay testing 2 techniques, but diagnosis is confirmed using antigen detection by (1) identification of N risticii morulae in WBCs during the acute phase of the disease, (2) isolation of the organism from WBCs, or (3) PCR testing of WBCs or feces.",

This fluid deficit should be replaced rapidly (up to 6 to 10 L per hour in a 450-kg adult horse). After plasma volume has been restored and the horse is well hydrated, the volume of fluids administered can be adjusted but may still be as high as 120 mL/kg daily, depending on ongoing losses. In emergency situations, blood volume can be rapidly expanded and cardiac output increased by intravenous administration of a small volume of hypertonic saline (1 to 2 L of 7% saline). The resulting increase in blood tonicity causes fluid to move rapidly from the extracellular fluid space into the vascular compartment, which improves microcirculatory perfusion and helps prevent complications such as sepsis and multiple-system organ failure. Hypertonic saline administration also has immunomodulatory effects, antiinflammatory effects, and cardiac inotropic effects. Whereas polyionic crystalloids induce only a modest increase in intravascular volume and quickly leave the intravascular space for the interstitium, hypertonic saline increases plasma volume by three to four times the volume administered, and this volume expansion may last for up to 60 minutes. However, it is important to remember that hypertonic saline does not replace the fluid lost in the diarrhea. For this reason, a large volume of balanced polyionic fluid solution should be administered intravenously (at least 2 L per hour) after the hypertonic saline has been administered, until the hydration deficit has been corrected.",

Adverse effects may arise when unapproved products are used. Veterinarians must educate themselves and their clients in methods of safe practice by using safe and approved equine biotherapeutic products. Transfaunation with fecal liquor from a healthy horse has been used, but it is extremely important to confirm disease-free status in the donor horse because salmonellosis has been transmitted by this route and results of this procedure are equivocal with regard to benefit to the patient.",

However, affected horses can deteriorate rapidly, even in the face of aggressive medical treatment. Horses that continue to have frequent, profuse, watery diarrhea and ongoing systemic signs of endotoxemia and septicemia have a poorer prognosis for recovery. Diarrheic horses that are azotemic and have clinicopathologic findings consistent with ongoing hemoconcentration and hypoproteinemia also have a poor prognosis for survival. Antimicrobial administration may induce diarrhea, and horses with antimicrobial-associated diarrhea may have a worse prognosis than those with other types of acute diarrhea. Frequent complications of acute equine colitis include laminitis, thrombophlebitis, debilitation, and marked weight loss.",
