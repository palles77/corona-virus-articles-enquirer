Thus, preventing viral transmission by case isolation, quarantine, and social distancing is essential to slowing its spread. Here we model social networks using weighted graphs, where vertices represent individuals and edges represent contact. As public health measures are implemented, connectivity in the graph decreases, resulting in lower effective reproductive numbers, and reduced viral transmission. For COVID-19, model parameters were derived from the coronavirus epidemic in China, validated by epidemic data in Italy, then applied to the United States. We calculate that, in the U.S., the public is able to contain viral transmission by limiting the average number of contacts per person to less than 7 unique individuals over each 5 day period. This increases the average social distance between individuals to 10 degrees of separation.",

Without social distancing, if a single individual is infected with COVID-19, the average probability that any given person will be infected is (R0/k\u0305 ) d = (2.39/19.3) 6.63 = 0.967 \u00d7 10 -6 , or 1 in 1.03 million. Thus, if 1.03 million people become infected in the U.S., then it is likely that the epidemic will reach every person through networks of social contact, unless social distancing is kept in place until vaccines and anti-viral medications become available.",

For large networks, estimates using parameter averages can be robust. There are also numerous factors influencing viral transmission. This simplified model only includes main variables affecting the epidemiology of communicable diseases. Other factors to consider in the future include patient age, sex, pre-existing medical conditions, additional settings of contact such as various workplaces, restaurants, nursing homes, just to name a few. As more factors are taken into consideration, the social network model can be refined to provide more accurate predictions.",

The time from the beginning of collective social action to the inflection point of the epidemic is about 3 viral generation intervals, totaling 2-3 weeks. Once daily new cases are decreasing, social distancing measures can be gradually relaxed, in phases, to prevent rebound of viral transmission.",

This is also the standard of care for other communicable diseases such as tuberculosis, where clinically stable patients are discharged home after three negative induced sputum samples.",
