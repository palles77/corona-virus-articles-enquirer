WHO decides to determine a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) of 2019-nCoV. 2019-nCov was reported to share the same receptor, Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), with SARS-Cov. Here based on the public single-cell RNA-Seq datasets, we analyzed the ACE2 RNA expression profile in the tissues at different locations of the respiratory tract. The result indicates that the ACE2 expression appears in nasal epithelial cells. We found that the size of this population of ACE2-expressing nasal epithelial cells is comparable with the size of the population of ACE2-expression type II alveolar cells (AT2) in the Asian sample reported by Yu Zhao et al. We further detected 2019-nCoV by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from the nasal-swab and throat-swab of seven suspected cases. We found that 2019-nCoV tends to have a higher concentration in the nasal-swab comparing to the throat-swab, which could attribute to the ACE2-expressing nasal epithelial cells. We hope this study could be informative for virus-prevention strategy development, especially the treatment of nasal mucus. Severe infection by 2019-nCoV could result in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and sepsis, causing death in approximately 2% of infected individuals 1 . Once contacted with the human airway, the spike proteins of 2019-nCoV can bind the surface receptors of sensitive cells, and mediate the virus to enter into target cells. Recently, Xu et.al. modeled the spike protein and indicated that Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) could be the receptor for this 2019-nCoV 2 . Zhou et. al. showed that ACE2 is essential for 2019-nCov to enter HeLa cells 3",

Yu Zhao et al. analyzed the single-cell RNA-Seq data of the lung tissues from eight donors and found that ACE2 mainly expressed in the type II alveolar cells (AT2) 5 . They found that ACE2 shows significantly high expression in AT2 of an Asian donor. However, the abundance of ACE2 expression in the upper respiratory tract needs further identification.",

We found that KRT8 shows a wide expression in the cells of nasal brushing, bronchial biopsy, turbinate, and the lung tissue of the Asian donor. We used KRT8 as the marker of apical cells, and KRT5 as the marker of basal cells. We found KRT8 and SFTPC both mark AT2 in cells of the lung tissue of the Asian donor. We count the number of detected cells, cells with ACE2 expression, cells with KRT8 expression, and cells with both ACE2 expression and KRT8 expression in the single-cell RNA-Seq data of the nasal brushing, bronchial biopsy, turbinate and the lung tissue of the Asian donor (Table 1) . We found that about 3.2% and 2.1% of KRT8-expressing cells in the nasal brushing and turbinate samples show ACE2 expression, which is comparable to the percent of KRT8-expressing cells in the Asian donor having ACE2 expression.",

We found that 2019-nCoV is detected in his/her nasal-swabs, but not detected in his/her throat-swabs in two patients (patient W1 and Z1 in Table 2 ). In the patient Z2, 2019-nCoV is confirmed in his nasal-swab. But the PCR report of the throat-swab is suspected. In the patient Z4, 2019-nCoV is detected in both nasal-and throat-swabs.

Decades ago, the basal layer of the nasal mucosa was reported to have ACE2 protein expression, which suggests that the candidate host cells of 2019-nCoV exist in nasal tissue. However, the analysis is at the bulk level and could not calculate the number of host cells. Our single-cell RNA-Seq analysis suggests that a significant number of candidate host cells exist in nasal tissue. China is suffering from the 2019-nCoV right now. Our results suggest that we should pay more attention to protect nasal tissue from 2019-nCoV infection.",
