This has led to the development of immortal and stable cell lines with the capability of growth in suspension [4] . In recent studies, researchers have succeeded in growing Vero cells on micro-carriers for preparing suspension cultures of these cells [5, 6] . Rourou et al. [6] reported that suspension cultivation of agitated Vero cell cultures promoted measles and rabies virus production from these cells. In addition, Shen et al. [7] showed that suspension-adapted Vero cells cultivated without microcarriers produced higher amounts of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) than adherent Vero cells. However, some hurdles associated with Vero cells, such as longer cell doubling time and low cell viability, still remain to be addressed via the formulation of appropriate adaptation processes.",

Although we determined which serum-free condition (media) is suitable for Vero cell culture, we did not apply the culture media in shaking suspension culture system; the growth rate of Vero cells and virus productivity under such conditions are thus, still unclear. In this study, we showed that the shaking suspension system can induce higher productivity of Ad5 in Vero cells, but did not verify whether the established suspension culture system is also applicable to the production of other viruses; this should be verified in further study using various viral vaccine strains. We also did not confirm the tumorigenicity of suspension culture-adapted Vero cells because the adaptation process may change the characteristics of Vero cells. All these aspects need to be investigated and elucidated via future researches.",
