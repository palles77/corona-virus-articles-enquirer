First, the lipid layer would be a barrier for the transport of polar substances into and out of the cell. Second, it would be difficult to anchor the proteins and carbohydrates necessary for cellular recognition and communication at a lipid bilayer. Nature has solved these problems by developing special groups of proteins such as the peripheral membrane proteins that adsorb at the exterior of the membrane and the integral membrane proteins that penetrate into the membrane. It is probable that peripheral membrane proteins are adsorbed through electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions with both polar fucntional groups of the membrane lipids and portions of integral membrane proteins which protrude out of the membrane. 'Internal membrane proteins are of three types: transmembrane proteins which completely span the membrane and are exposed to the aqueous environment on both sides; proteins which have both an exposed and membrane embedded .portion; and proteins that are completely embedded within the lipid of the membrane.",

Detergents are not always compatible with chromatographic processes. Fortunately, the use of detergents and solubilizing agents such as SDS, zwitterionic detergents, non-ionic detergents, organic solvents, urea, and guanidinium hydrochloride has been examined in the SEC of proteins [ 3-81. There is also a series of reports on detergent use in the SEC of integral membrane proteins f g-151. Although SEC is of limited resolving power in the purification of membrane proteins [ 121, it has sufficient resolution to be used in the selection of detergents for solubilization [ 91, optimization of detergent concentration [ 111, and quick estimation of the purity of a sample purified by other techniques [ 131. SEC, using sodium cholate, EDTA, dithiothreitol (DTT) , and glycerol in the mobile phase to preserve activity, has also been used to study the induction pattern of microsomal cytochrome P-450 [ lo] . Still another application of SEC has been to monitor the aggregation state of detergent-solubilized sarcoplasmic reticulum adenosine triphosphatase [ 161. When SEC is used in the preparative mode it is usually in conjunction with another chromatographic step. The purification of spectrin subunits from erythrocytes by a combination of SEC and RPC is an example [ 171.

Although large amounts of organic solvent are occasionally used in the mobile phase to solubilize proteins, as in the case of chloroplast proteins [ 181, most IEC separations are carried out with either non-ionic detergents or the 3-[ ( 3-chloroamidopropyl) dimethylammonio] -l-trifluoroacetic acid ( CHAPS) zwitterion [ 24,251. There is strong evidence that the quality of the detergent as a solubilizing agent and its concentration has an impact on resolution in IEC. Using a series of polyethylene glycol alkyl ether (C,E,) detergents as a mobile phase additive it was possible to show that both alkyl chain length and the number of glycol residues influenced resolution of Escherichiu coZi K-12 membrane proteins in anion-exchange separations [ 191 (C&E, was optimal) . With both C&Es [ 191 and n-octyl-/3-D-glucopyranoside (octyl glucoside) [ 201, it was reported that resolution was better above the critical micelle concentration of the detergent. This was attributed to diminished protein aggregation on the column. The presence of EDTA in the extracting medium and mobile phase also increased resolution [ 201; apparently divalent cations are involved in aggregate formation. All three of these phenomena indicate that complete intermolecular dissociation of proteins is a prerequisite to good chromatographic resolution of membrane proteins.",

The problem in RPC is much the same as in IEC and SEC; the more hydrophobic membrane proteins are difficult to solubilize. Although recovery is more of a problem in RPC of membrane proteins than water-soluble proteins [ 261, it is still widely used. Khorana et al. [ 271 have made the observation that \"the straightforward application of current methods for sequencing water-soluble proteins to large hydrophobic membrane proteins such as bacteriorhodopsin is not feasible\". In addition, the extreme hydrophobicity of an RPC column makes elution of very hydrophobic proteins even more difficult. Khorana et al. [ 271 and Tahagahi et al. [ 281 have successfully solubilized proteins such as bacteriorhodopsin, cytochrome b6 and cytochrome b5 reductase with formic acid. Elution of proteins and peptide fragments from RPC columns was achieved with mobile phases containing 5% formic acid. The fact that formic acid can cleave aspartyl-prolyl (Asp-Pro) bonds, deaminates asparagine and glutamine, aggregates cleavage fragments, slowly destroys tryptophan residues, and is viscous, is a concern. Addition of ethanol to a final concentration of 70% in the extracting solvent diminished these problems.",

Since one of the peptides being examined had three asp-pro pairs which are known to be labile in acid, the possibility of fragmentation was examined. With this particular peptide no cleavage occurred in 24 h when the samples were incubated with a mixture of formic acid-acetonitrile (60~20). Again the addition of organic solvent diminished degradation. In all but a few cases, there was no change in proteins after 6 h of storage in the mobile phase as determined by electrophoresis and chromatography. Antisera prepared against proteins which had been purified by RPC with the 60% formic acid mobile phase reacted with intact virus. This indicated that sufficient native structure was recovered when these proteins were returned to a physiological environment that antibodies could be produced which were functional against native viral proteins. Although formic acid is a superior solubilizing agent, it should be appreciated that with silica-based sorbents substantial degradation, i.e. cleavage of the alkyl group from the support, occurred during its use. Inferior performance with other mobile phases may be experienced after use with formic acid because large areas of underivatized silica surface would have been generated. The most popular mobile phase still contains trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) and either acetonitrile or an alcohol such as ethanol, 2-propanol, or butanol [ 31-341. It has also been noted in the TFA system that quite different selectivity can be obtained by using mixtures of acetonitrile and 1-propanol [ 331. Selectivity varied almost continuously with the ratio of these two solvents. Separations which could not be achieved at one solvent ratio were easily accomplished at another. Pecoveries were typically greater than 90%. Prior to the introduction of formic acid and TFA, acetate (pH 6.5 ) with chloroform-methanol was successfully employed in the isolation of mitochondrial sector proteins [ 351.",

Although these two subunits have identical electrophoretic mobilities when analyzed by SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE), they could be widely separated by hydroxyapatite columns in the presence of SDS. Solutes were eluted in a 0.15-0.5 M sodium phosphate buffer gradient, pH 6.8, containing 0.1% SDS. There was some difference in resolution between hydroxyapatite columns from various suppliers. To avoid column dissolution, it was recommended that the mobile phase contain calcium and phosphate at the solubility product levels of calcium phosphate. However, the formation of a precipitate in the presence of SDS precluded the addition of calcium and phosphate to the mobile phase when SDS was present. This reduced the lifetime of the column.

A recent study on strong cation-exchange columns finds them to be equally effective under the same conditions used with the weak cation-exchange column [ 571.

It appears that for a single steroid there may even be multiple receptor proteins which vary with cellular differentiation [ 651. Since receptor proteins do not have unique spectral properties, they are generally detected (or assayed) by their ability to bind labelled steroids. Radiolabelling is the most widely used [ 65, , but fluorescent labelling has also been reported [ 661. The labelling of proteins with a steroid may be done before or after the separation [ 65-681 as shown in Fig. 5 . Post-separation detection is so time-consuming and labor-intensive that it is seldom used. Although much quicker and more widely used, preseparation labelling presents two types of problems. Many cytoplasmic proteins, in addition to specific receptor protein ( s ) , may bind steroids . This makes it difficult to differentiate specific steroid receptor protein (s) from those that bind steroid non-specifically. Fortunately, steroid receptor proteins have a higher affinity for labelled steroid than those that adsorb the steroid non-specifically. This difference in affinity is the basis for the second problem. During passage through the column, weakly bound steroid will begin to dissociate from proteins and either migrate through the column as free steroid or be adsorbed by the sorbent matrix [ 651. If dissociation is incomplete, the labelling pattern in the column effluent will be misleading. The degree of dissociation is due in large part to the binding constant of the steroid and the rate of dissociation. One of the ways to overcome this problem is to separate labelled proteins in the presence of a large excess of non-labelled steroid [ 68, 691. In those cases where the labelled steroid is weakly associated with protein, the large excess of non-labelled steroid will displace the labelled steroid.",

            "text": "The chromosomes of eucaryotic cells contain a family of small, basic proteins which are tightly associated with DNA and function to package it into nucleosome structural units. There are five major classes of histones which are designated Hl, H2A, H3B, H3, and H4 and differ in both relative molecular mass and amino acid composition. For example, Hl is a 21-kD protein containing 29% lysine wheras H2A and H3B have 14.5 and 13.7 kD, respectively, and are approximately equal in arginine and lysine content. These three histones also vary considerably among eucaryotic species, i.e. there is little sequence homology. In contrast, the 15.3-kD H3 histone and 11.3-kD H4 histone are arginine-rich and almost identical among species. A striking feature of the H4 histone is that the basic residues seem to be clustered at one end of the molecule where there is a net positive charge of 16. The fact that arginine and lysine constitute approximately one fourth of the amino acid residues in histones presents both an opportunity and challenge in their separation. Fractionation of all the major classes of histones has been achieved by RPC using a Cls or CN column [84-901. There are, however, some special requirements. The first is the use of end-capped columns. Non-end-capped columns gave very poor recovery in the case of C1s, Ce, and CN columns. Since this is not always the case with proteins, it is probably due to the very basic nature of histones. The second requirement was the use of TFA in the mobile phase. Using 0.3% TFA in an aqueous-to-acetonitrile gradient on a Waters Radial-Pak PBondapak Cl8 column it was even possible to split the H2A and H3 histones into less hydrophobic (LHP) and more hydrophobic (MHP) variants [ 851. When these two requirements are met, histones may be fractionated and recovered in greater than 95% yield. Although the CN column will not separate (MPH)H2A and H4 components, Gurley et al.

Excellent review articles on the separation of plasma lipoproteins [ 921 and apolipoproteins (apo) [ 931 have appeared recently. The function of the plasma lipoproteins is to transport phospholipids, neutral lipids, and cholesterol esters. Since the density of triglyceride (TG) is lower than that of protein, the density of lipoproteins decreases as they are loaded with TG. This is the basis for classifying plasma lipoproteins. High-density lipoproteins ( HDLs) contain approximately 3% TG and are of the highest density. The low-density lipoproteins ( LDLs) are of intermediate density with 10% TG while the very-low-density lipoproteins (VLDLs) contain 60% TG. In addition to the lipoproteins, plasma contains chylomicrons. Chylomicrons are particles of approximately 96% TG with a thin layer of protein coating the outer surface.

Unfortunately there are little data to support this conclusion except common logic and some work on glycopeptides. The retention behavior of glycosylated and non-glycosylated peptides of the same amino acid sequence showed very similar behavior in RPC [ 1211. However, glycosylated peptides eluted slightly earlier. When the amount of glycosylation was the same between two peptides, the one with multiple sites of glycosylation eluted first. This is to be expected. Retention of polypeptides in RPC is based on the hydrophobic contact area between the solute and alkyl ligands on the sorbent [ 1221. Hydrophilic portions of a molecule are directed outward toward the solution and do not participate directly in the adsorption process. Their contribution is simply to decrease the partition coefficient by making the compound more soluble. Differentiating among variations in the carboyhydrate portion of a glycoprotein is much more difficult. When the differences are the result of either steric shielding of charged groups or the addition or deletion of a charged species, i.e. an amino sugar or sialic acid, ion-exchange columns will be useful. For example, multiple glycosylated species of hemoglobin ( HbA1,, HbAi,,, HbA1,, and HbAJ and some antibodies can all be separated by IEC [ 631. However, as the degree of complexity in the glycoprotein increases through the introduction of charge in multiple-oligosaccharide chains, heterogeneity of charge within any one oligosaccharide, and steric shielding of charge in the polypeptide backbone by the carbohydrate, the ability of the ion-exchange system to discriminate among these myriad species will be overwhelmed.",
