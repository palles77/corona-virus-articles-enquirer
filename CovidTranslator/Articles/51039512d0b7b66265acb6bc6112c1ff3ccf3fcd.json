The SARS CoV genome sequence has been recently published. 2 The structure of the main proteinase, essential for SARS CoV replication, can be deduced from its similarity (43% sequence identity) to the X-ray crystallography structure of the proteinase from the porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), also a coronavirus. 3 Anand et al., who solved the structure of the TGEV proteinase (PDB code: 1lvo), 4 have produced a model for the SARS CoV proteinase (PDB code: 1p9t and 1pa5) using the former as a template. In addition, they propose a drug discovered to treat the common cold, AG7088, as a good starting point for SARS CoV inhibition. AG7088 by itself has failed to inhibit the SARS CoV in vitro. 5 Here, using simulations, we show that HIV-1 protease inhibitors may provide better starting points than AG7088 for inhibition of the SARS CoV proteinase.",

The number of grid points in the x-, y-, zaxes was 100\u00c2100\u00c2100 with grid points separated by 0.375 \u00c5 . Docking calculations were set to 100 runs. At the end of the calculation, AutoDock performed cluster analysis. Docking solutions with ligand all-atom root mean square deviation (RMSD) within 1.0 \u00c5 of each other were clustered together and ranked by the lowest energy representative. The lowest-energy solution was accepted as the calculated binding energy. The inhibitory constant (K i ) was calculated from the final docked energy according to Hess's law and used to define the binding affinity of the inhibitors. More details of our MD and docking protocols are available elsewhere. 6 Figure 1 lists our predicted binding affinities of 28 known inhibitors of HIV-1 protease as well as the compound proposed by Anand et al., to the TGEV proteinase structure. Of the 29 compounds evaluated, the inhibitor AG7088 is ranked 24th with low predicted binding affinity. On the other hand, several HIV-1 protease inhibitors bind to the substrate binding site of the TGEV proteinase with higher affinity. The structural similarity among these inhibitors can be categorized into two groups: The first group includes inhibitors that resemble the cyclic urea HIV-1 protease inhibitor, that is L-700,417, XK2, LDC, LGZ and DMP. The second group includes those molecules that mimic the peptide backbone conformation, that is, TPV, INU, 1IN, IDV, NFV and LPV. An identical ranking of binding affi-nities for the inhibitors is obtained if different random starting seeds for the simulations are used. Figure 2 compares the predicted binding modes of the TGEV proteinase to the inhibitor proposed by Anand et al., (Fig. 2a, in orange) and the inhibitor predicted to have the highest binding affinity (Fig. 2b, in green) . The figures show that the AG7088 inhibitor is predicted to partially fit into the binding pocket that the substrate would occupy, whereas the inhibitor with the highest binding affinity, L-700,417 (VAC), 10 mimics the substrate binding mode very well.",
