According to current research, a higher pro-inflammatory cytokine storm existed in COVID-19 patients with a severe or critical illness, eventually affected the prognosis [18] . For this, IL-6 antibody blocker, transfusion of convalescent plasma, and other therapies have been applied to counteract the cytokine storm [19, 20] . Therefore, with antiviral and autoimmune regulation effects, HCQ should be a protector in SARS-CoV-2 infection. In the present study, the reduced risk of progression to severe illness in patients with HCQ treatment also explained the intervention effect of HCQ on the pathological process of the COVID-19.",

This trial for SARS-CoV-2 has already been registered in the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (ChiCTR), the unique identifier: ChiCTR2000029559. Informed consent was obtained from all patients. From February 4, 2020, to February 28, 2020, 142 patients with confirmed COVID-19 were admitted. Diagnosis and classification of COVID-19 were based on the criteria of the China National Health Commission. For this trial, the selection criteria: 1. Age \u2265 18 years; 2. Laboratory (RT-PCR) positive of SARS-CoV-2; 3. Chest CT with pneumonia; 4. SaO 2 /SPO 2 ratio > 93% or PaO 2 /FIO 2 ratio > 300 mmHg under the condition in the hospital room (mild illness); 5. Willing to receive a random assignment to any designated treatment group and not participating in another study at the same time. The exclusion criteria: 1. Severe and critical illness patients or participating in the trial does not meet the patient's maximum benefit or does not meet any criteria for safe follow-up in the protocol after a doctor's evaluation; 2. Retinopathy and other retinal diseases; 3. Conduction block and other arrhythmias; 4. Severe liver disease (e.g., Child-Pugh score \u2265 C or AST> twice the upper limit); 5. Pregnant or breastfeeding; 6. Severe renal failure [estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) \u2264 30 mL/min/1.73m 2 ] or receiving renal replacement therapy; 7.

For cough, 15 patients in the control group and 22 patients in the HCQ treatment group had a cough in day 0, The cough remission time was significantly reduced in the HCQ treatment group.Notably, a total of 4 of the 62 patients progressed to severe illness, all of which occurred in the control group not receiving HCQ treatment. For adverse effects, it should be noted that there were two patients with mild adverse reactions in the HCQ treatment group, one patient developed a rash, and one patient experienced a headache, none severe side effects appeared among them.To further explore the effect of HCQ on pneumonia, we compared and analyzed the chest CT of patients on day 0 and day 6. In our study, pneumonia was improved in 67.7%(42/62) of patients, with 29.0% moderately absorbed and 38.7% significantly improved. Surprisingly, a larger proportion of patients with improved pneumonia in the HCQ treatment group (80.6%, 25 of 31) compared with the control group (54.8%, 17 of 31). Besides, 61.3% of patients in the HCQ treatment group had a significant pneumonia absorption. Discussion CQ and its derivatives have been broadly used as immunomodulators in the treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and other rheumatism [12]. As the pharmacological mechanism of CQ is further elucidated, its additional clinical applications, especially the antiviral activity, are also increasingly valued [13]. The efficiency of CQ has been proven in a variety of viruses, including human coronavirus [[14], [15], [16]]. Researchers have even reported both prophylactic and therapeutic advantages of CQ for SARS-CoV infection [17]. The severe acute respiratory syndrome caused by SARS-CoV-2 in several patients is quite similar to SARS-CoV in 2002 and is currently seriously threatening global health by triggering COVID-19. However, none specific drugs are available for the prevention or treatment of COVID-19. Recently, Wang et al. identified that CQ could effectively inhibit the replication and spread of SARS-CoV-2 in vitro [7]. Experts and guides for COVID-19 in China have also recommended chloroquine phosphate superior to the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection [8,9]. To assess the safety.",
