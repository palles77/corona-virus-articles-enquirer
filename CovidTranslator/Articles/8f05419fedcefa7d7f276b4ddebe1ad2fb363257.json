These conditions are known to have an effect on the labile Oacetyl groups in terms of loss and migration. For our analyses, it was crucial that the O-Ac-Sia composition as measured by GLC-EIMS reliably reflected that of native BSM. We therefore established an alternative protocol to release the Sias enzymatically, with all experimental procedures performed under conditions that would minimize O-acetyl release/migration. BSM (500 \u00b5g) was dissolved in 500 \u00b5l PBS, pH 6.5 and treated with 50 mU of Arthrobacter ureafaciens sialidase (AuS; Sigma) for 4 h at 37\u00b0C (note that reactions were performed at mildly acidic pH to prevent migration C7-O-acetyl moieties to C9; (Kamerling et al., 1987) . For comparison, the same amount of BSM was dissolved in 500 \u00b5l 2 M propionic acid and incubated at 80\u00b0C for 4 h. Sia samples were lyophilized and trimethylsilylated with a mixture of trimethylchlorosilane : hexamethyldisilazane : pyridine (1:1:5) for 30 min at RT. Derivatized samples were separated by GLC with a temperature program of 25 min at 220\u00b0C, followed by a gradient from 220\u00b0C to 300\u00b0C at 6\u00b0C/min, and finally for 6 min at 300\u00b0C using a Fisons Instruments GC8060 gas chromatograph equipped with an AT-1 column (30 m x 0.25 \u00b5m,",

Nuclei were stained with Hoechst-33258 (blue). 9-O-Ac-Sias as detected by PToV-P4 HE colocalize with GM130 (Golgi complex) and partially with COP-I (ER/Golgi), but not with calreticulin (ER) or with early endosomal antigen-1 (early endosomes). (B) Binding of virolectins P4 (green) and LUN (red) to non-permeabilized and permeabilized HeLa, HEK293T and HRT-18 cells is abolished by pre-treatment of the cells with the sialate-9-O-acetylesterase BCoV-Mebus HE + or with Arthrobacter ureafaciens neuraminidase (NA). Nuclei were stained with Hoechst-33258 (blue). No binding was observed with derivatives of LUN and P4 in which the O-Ac-Sia binding sites in the lectin domain was demolished by structure-guided single amino acid substitutions, providing additional proof for specificity of binding (data not shown). (C) Binding of virolectin MHV-S HE (green) to non-permeabilized Ederm cells is sensitive to pre-treatment of the cells with the sialate-4-O-acetylesterase MHV-S HE + .",
