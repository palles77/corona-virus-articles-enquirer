            "text": "Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) is one of the most challenging subjects of research in veterinary viral immunology, and the immune response against PRRS virus (PRRSV) still is poorly understood. Infected pigs develop a strong and rapid humoral response but these initial antibodies do not confer protection and can even be harmful by mediating an antibody-dependent enhancement of disease. In contrast, development of neutralising antibodies (NAs) is delayed and generation of cell-mediated immune responses, such as PRRSV-specific interferon (IFN)-c secreting cells, is initially erratic. In spite of this, induction of strong and rapid NAs and IFN-c responses seem to be required for effective vaccination. PRRSV strongly modulates the host's immune responses. The virus inhibits key cytokines, such as IFN-a, and may induce regulatory cytokines, such as interleukin (IL)-10. Development of NAs seems to be impaired by the existence of a decoy epitope close to the main neutralisation epitope in glycoprotein 5. This ability to modulate the host immune response probably varies among strains or isolates. The genetic diversity of the virus is very high and it has been shown that this diversity can have serious implications for the development of vaccines, since the immunity induced by one strain may be only partial against a different strain, even within the same genotype. With this panorama, the development of newer and universally efficacious PRRSV vaccines is challenging, but the present state of knowledge allows optimism if collaborative efforts are undertaken in the scientific community.",

The clinical features of PRRS are well known, a global picture of the epidemiology has been drawn, although some gaps remain to be filled, management and husbandry procedures have been devised for controlling the disease and vaccines are available. However, infection by PRRS virus (PRRSV) is still widespread and the virus is frequently reintroduced to farms after eradication. What are the reasons for such failures? The answer is not simple, but examination of the scientific literature and problems reported by pig veterinarians indicates that vaccines can be a useful tool, although their efficacy is far from being universal and complete. The approach of ''let's take a strain, let's attenuate or inactivate it and, voil\u00e0 ! the vaccine will generate sufficient immunity to protect against the disease'' is not valid for PRRSV.",

Circulating antibodies against PRRSV are detectable in some pigs by days 5-7 post-infection (PI) and all animals have seroconverted by day 14 PI (Yoon et al., 1992 (Yoon et al., ,1995 . PRRSV-specific immunoglobulin M (IgM) reaches a peak at day 14 PI and then declines to undetectable levels by 42 days PI. Concentrations of IgG reach a maximum at 21-49 days PI (Vezina et al., 1996; Loemba et al., 1996) . However, this rapid IgM and IgG response does not correspond to neutralising antibodies (NAs) (Yoon et al., 1994) . Nelson et al. (1994) studied the kinetics of the humoral response of pigs against an American strain of PRRSV. The earliest antibodies were directed against the 15 KDa nucleoprotein, followed by the 19 KDa M protein, then the 26 KDa glycoprotein 5 (GP5). Other studies showed that non-structural protein 2 (nsp2) contains a cluster of non-neutralising B-epitopes and probably is the immunodominant protein of PRRSV (Oleksiewicz et al., 2001; de Lima et al., 2006) . Most diagnostic tests detect antibodies mainly against the N protein. These antibodies appear around the first week PI and persist for several months, but do not correlate with protection.",

GP5, the main target for NAs, contains up to four glycosylation sites, located in or close to the neutralising epitope. American field strains of PRRSV lacking glycosylation sites in the upstream hypervariable region induced NAs more rapidly and more strongly in infected pigs than strains lacking the downstream glycosylation site at position 44 (N-44), even though all strains were equally susceptible to NAs (Faaberg et al., 2006) . As Spanish PRRSV strains have evolved from 1991-2005, there has been a trend to lose the glycosylation site at N-46 (equivalent to N-44 of American strains) and to maintain or gain glycosylations in the flanking regions (N-37 and N-53), consistent with selection of strains inducing weaker NA responses (Mateu et al., 2006) .",

NAs may protect against disease if present in sufficient quantities before infection, but they do not seem to be essential for clearing virus in blood during the course of the infection. PRRSV is able to modulate innate responses, probably through the regulation of IFN-a and IL-10 responses. Two different PRRSV genotypes exist that have evolved in parallel. Cross protection afforded by each genotype is only partial and genetic diversity within each genotype can be high enough to allow a vaccinated animal to be re-infected by a different strain of the same genotype.
