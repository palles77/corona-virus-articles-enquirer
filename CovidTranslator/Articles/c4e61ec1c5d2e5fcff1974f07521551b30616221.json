This study examines how this novel disease threat was depicted in the UK newspapers, using social representations theory and in particular existing work on social representations of HIV/AIDS and Ebola to analyse the meanings of the epidemic. It investigates the way that SARS was presented as a dangerous threat to the UK public, whilst almost immediately the threat was said to be 'contained' using the mechanism of 'othering': SARS was said to be unlikely to personally affect the UK reader because the Chinese were so different to 'us'; so 'other'. In this sense, the SARS scare, despite the remarkable speed with which it was played out in the modern global news media, resonates with the meanings attributed to other epidemics of infectious diseases throughout history. Yet this study also highlights a number of differences in the social representations of SARS compared with earlier epidemics. In particular, this study examines the phenomena of 'emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases' over the past 30 or so years and suggests that these have impacted on the faith once widely held that Western biomedicine could 'conquer' infectious disease. r",

Around 15% of patients affected required artificial ventilation and there was a relatively high death rate, in the order of 5%.

These are a collective coping mechanism which help people by imposing order on a seemingly chaotic and unpredictable novelty. The mass media is the major source of these representations, and both cultivates and reflects them. Social representations are best studied when 'new' concerns arise for different groups, for example genetic engineering or modern biotechnology (see, for example, Wagner, Kronberger, & Seifert, 2002) . A social representation consists of knowledge shared by members of a community about a given subject. It is disclosed by methodical study of the ''common sense'' knowledge of non-specialists on the subject. 'Representations are embodied in communication and in individual minds, shared in a way similar to language' (Bauer & Gaskell, 1999, p.167) . These representations construct the world through images, terms, descriptions, examples, models and metaphors. Thus in this paper I do not attempt to measure what 'the general public' or even the 'reading public' think in the way that a 'media effects' approach would. Instead, here I will focus on the media representations.",

Globalisation can mean many things: it is for many the worldwide spread of information, lifestyles, culture and technologies. But for many commentators, globalisation is primarily an economic force, implying that (nearly) all national economies are now networked with other economies around the world (Beck, 2000) . One of the consequences of economic globalisation and the weakening of the nation state is greater mobility of people, both rich and poor.

The calculations the 'expert' provides about risk tend to be treated as if they were value-free, unbiased 'objective' facts (Lupton, 1999) . Another model of risk is the Social Constructionist approach, which sees risk as an objective hazard, threat or danger but one that is inevitably mediated though social and cultural processes. This approach does not argue about the realities of the risk, but rather focuses on how they are politicised. Beck (1992) coined the term the Risk Society to characterise what he sees as this constant perception in late industrial or post-modern society of risk everywhere. But according to Joffe (1999) , the 'risk society' does not necessarily leave people with a heightened state of anxiety. Rather people have defence mechanisms, namely their representations of risks, which function to control anxiety.",

Since 1973, over 20 new infectious diseases have been identified by the United States Centre for Disease control in Atlanta, including Ebola, AIDS, hepatitis C and vCJD (Satcher, 1995) . SARS is just the latest to be added to this list. Some of these 'emerging infectious diseases' such as AIDS or Brazilian purpuric fever can be regarded as genuinely new. Others such as Hantaan viruses have been known in Asia for centuries but are now 'emerging' in other parts of the world. Hemorrhagic fevers such as Ebola have been recognised for a relatively long time. By 'emerging' what is more usually meant for a Western reader is 'emerging from the poor', in particular the poor in the developing world. The 'emergence' relates to modern communication and the media 'Symbolically, if not epidemiologically, Ebola spread like wildfire-as a danger potentially without limit. It emerged' (Farmer, 1999, p. 46) .",

Different groups blamed 'other people' (people not like us) for AIDS, the common factor being the shifting of the blame to the 'other', people outside of one's own community (Park, 1993; Treichler, 1988; Joffe, 1999; Farmer, 1999; Goodwin et al., 2003) .",

What he calls the mutation-contagion package is composed of the following core ideas: that microbes are on the rampage and that we are experiencing a 'wave of new assailants'; that microbes are cleverer than us and are evolving to 'outwit us'; that microbes and environment are conjoined in an ecological parable, and that population growth, environmental degradation and factors such as antibiotic overuse are responsible for this unfolding catastrophe; that microbes know no boundaries (through globalisation and travel); and that we are waiting for the next plague (apocalyptic prophesy). This package is clearly constructed around a frightening core with few instances of reassurance. However frightening this may be, the sense of threat is still somehow hypothetical. The diseases themselves and the likelihood that readers will be personally affected (at least for now) remain abstract and distant as the threat tends to arise in geographically distant or marginal populations. At the same time, the threats are offset by the promise of 'medical progress', which presents a stream of 'amazing new discoveries'. Soon after the initial reporting however, the tone of newspaper coverage tends to shift to what Ungar (1998) calls the containment package, which aims to defuse the potential panic that emerges early in the coverage. This containment package is ''erected on the metaphor of 'otherness''' (Ungar, 1998, p. 49) .",

Yet by the time it reappeared in Zaire in 1995/96, the climate had changed and 'emerging infectious diseases' were clearly much higher on the news agenda. Ungar (1998) uses his framework for reporting of other infectious diseases to examine the newspaper coverage of the 1995 Ebola outbreak in Canadian, the US and the British newspapers. He argues that the coverage embodies many of the most terrifying aspects of the mutation-contagion package: Ebola comes from elsewhere, fits the ecological parable, and is always paired with 'killer' or 'deadly', and is almost always accompanied by descriptions of liquefying organs and profuse bleeding. What characterised the Ebola coverage was that it could be the harbinger of a wider pandemic and attendant panic. 'Ebola, as the embodiment of the mutation-contagion package, represents a monster virus on a potential rampage' (Ungar, 1998, p. 47) .",

The 'appalling sanitary conditions' of many African hospitals are contrasted with the exemplary protective methods of the Western experts. A few days later, there is a further shift in the tone of the newspaper coverage, as attention is given to Western health teams, who, as opposed to the chaos in Zaire, are 'disease detectives'. By now Ebola is treated not as a rampaging virus, but as a disease that is difficult to catch. In particular, the 'stepping off a plane scenario' (where a person can travel across the world whilst carrying the infection) is undermined, often in the very newspapers who days before espoused it, as journalists begin to report that people with Ebola are not infectious until ill, and then unlikely to be allowed to catch a plane. Joffe and Haarhoff's (2002) analysis of the newspaper coverage of the same Ebola outbreak found that all articles about Ebola in the UK mentioned Africa; almost half linked this to monkeys; another half linked this to the lack of appropriate medical facilities there to deal with it. Beyond this, other factors implicated in the spread of Ebola are poverty, pollution, forest environment and tribal rituals. By symbolising Ebola as essential to Africa as a whole, it implies that such disasters are 'incontrovertibly African' (disaster ridden), and by implication that the West is superior. In terms of whether Ebola is a threat, the newspapers evoke fear by highlighting how terrifying and horrific it is (providing vivid descriptions of liquefying bodies); and by comparisons with AIDS. Alongside the fear theme, the articles are pervaded by an emphasis on how Ebola can be brought under control by isolation, quarantine and surveillance (by Westerners), at the same time rarely alluding to the role played by Africans, who are portrayed as passive and voiceless. The way that reassurance is provided is through the notion that Africa and the Africans are so different to 'us' (so 'other') that the disease will be contained, and will in reality provide nothing more that a hypothetical threat.",

(Ungar, 1998, p. 52) The discussion of the 'othering' in the context of AIDS and Ebola connects with Said's (1978) account of Orientalism, in which he argues that the construction of identity involves establishing opposites and what he labels 'others', 'whose actuality is always subject to the continuous interpretation and re-interpretation of their differences from 'us'' (Said, 1978, p. 332) . His central point is to contest the idea that there are geographical spaces with indigenous, radically ''different'' inhabitants who can be defined on the basis of some religion, culture or racial essence. Orientalism is a collective notion identifying ''us'' Europeans against ''those'' non-Europeans, and advocating that European identity is superior to all the non-European peoples and cultures. The resulting portrait of ''us'' and ''them'' is reductive and 'invidiously ideological'; where the West is portrayed as: rational, developed, humane, superior and the Orient, which is aberrant, undeveloped, inferiorythe Orient is at bottom something either to be feared (the Yellow peril, the Mongol hordes, the brown dominions) or to be controlled (by pacification, research and development, outright occupation wherever possible).

The sample was all the articles which mentioned SARS in the Sunday UK national newspapers only. The Sunday national newspapers in the UK (Independent on Sunday, Mail on Sunday, News of the World, Observer, People, Sunday Express, Sunday Mirror, Sunday Telegraph and Sunday Times) represent a broad spectrum of political viewpoints from left to right, as well as a spectrum of 'highbrow' to 'lowbrow' viewpoints (broadsheet to tabloid). Many of the articles that appeared in the daily newspapers on SARS were short descriptive pieces on how many new cases of SARS had been reported, or how a particular case in the UK had been confirmed or ruled out as having in fact been SARS. By contrast, the Sunday newspapers contained many longer articles on SARS, which were often more analytical and frequently more lurid. The final reason for the choice of Sunday newspapers was that by sampling every 7 days, it was possible to get a 'feel' for how the coverage had shifted focus over the course of the preceding week. stories (Bartlett, Sterne, & Egger, 2002; Entwistle, 1995) . Therefore, all the articles and editorials on SARS from the British Medical Journal and The Lancet for the same 4-week period following the announcement of SARS were also downloaded as full-text from the journals' Internet sites (16 articles). All the documents were then analysed using ATLAS/ ti 4.2 qualitative research software, with an initial coding frame based on Joffe and Haarhoff's (2002) and Ungar's (1998) work on Ebola, although new themes emerged and were included as the analysis proceeded.

The rapid dissemination of sudden acute respiratory syndrome around the world should be considered a rehearsal for the next pandemic of influenza, as it shows what will happen with a new human virus spread by the respiratory route, with no vaccines and antivirals in limited supply. However, the speed of communication in the virtual world is an advantage to the microbial detective. The tried and trusted forensic approaches of the classical virologist, the electron microscope and the tissue culture plate, become powerful investigative tools when the images of a suspect can be shared immediately between laboratories thousands of miles apart. (Zambon & Nicholson, 2003b, p. 669) Here we see two of the elements which were to be central to newspaper coverage throughout this period: this could the next plague, but followed immediately by the reassurance that Western scientific biomedicine can successfully contain it. The British Medical Journal and The Lancet contained long descriptions of which laboratories and which experts were investigating SARS. Another theme which emerged in both medical journals and the newspapers was the 'scepticism' about the official Chinese figures for the disease.",

The main theme that occurs by this point was the effect that SARS was having on the economy, particularly the Hong Kong economy, where major banks such as Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs were warning that the epidemic could tip the whole of Asia, and subsequently the world into a 'global slowdown'. Staff of Western companies in China and Hong Kong were ordered to stay home. The other sector of the economy affected was the commercial airlines and tour operators. British Airways was one of several airlines to announce that it was cutting flights to and from Hong Kong, reflecting decreased demand. Predictions were made that SARS could be the final straw for several airlines that were already in a weakened financial state following the war in Iraq.",

Scientists were mentioned (by name) in Winnipeg, Atlanta and London, often reporting that they were on the 'verge of a breakthrough' or that 'a test is only days away' (medical miracles). Because these are British newspapers, it is perhaps not surprising that they focused particularly on Dr. Maria Zambon's work at the Collingdale laboratory in North London: ''It is like a detective game, only on an extraordinary international scale'', she explained In a week which has seen the number of cases leap fivefold, her efforts could not be more crucial. Dark lines under her eyes attest to the fact that Zambon, mother of a young son, has spent the last three weeks analysing data and looking at samples late into the night. (Revill & Aglionby, 2003) Virologist Professor John Oxford of the University of London was widely quoted as saying that he did not think that SARS would constitute a major epidemic, as it was geographically distant, difficult to catch and tended to adversely affect those whose immune systems were already compromised by the secondary effects of poverty. However, his reassurances were often followed by death tallies from other past epidemics, and estimates that apart from the 2409 cases by then confirmed, as many as another 24,000 could be spreading the virus. (A few weeks later, after the time frame of this project, there were predictions that SARS could kill millions.)",

A frequently recurring theme was that SARS could mutate into a more infectious and potentially more lethal form. China in particular was said to be the source of so many of these epidemics because of its insanitary conditions and its reliance on fowl farming, where influenza viruses are said to originate (although scientists were not sure at this point that SARS was either a zoonose or an influenza virus). Bubonic plague, cholera, smallpox, etc. were all described, with their death counts. Ebola and AIDS were also described, thus contextualising SARS as a threat on a similar scale.

The early Ebola outbreak in 1976 also got little attention in the news media. Yet SARS evoked a worldwide response almost immediately.

The first descriptions always talk of the new threat being a 'killer' or 'deadly', and early on speculation follows on how the epidemic will play itself out. The predictions were dire: this could be the 'next plague', the 'big one we've been waiting for' and so on. But the melioration comes almost immediately when it is acknowledged that this probably is not 'the big one' but rather can be seen as a rehearsal for it.

Earlier epidemics are invoked, together with their death tolls: the Black Death, Spanish Flu and AIDS. For example, in the context of SARS the Spanish Flu epidemic of 1918 which killed around 40 million people was widely recalled; as opposed to, for example, the West Nile Virus outbreak in the New York in 1999 where there were (only) 62 cases and seven deaths (with 4156 US cases and 284 deaths since then) (PHLS, 2003) . Or another more relevant example which was infrequently cited in the coverage of SARS is the case of vCJD. There have been 137 cases vCJD of which 132 have died (up to 2003), but again this is very much lower than the figures that some were predicting at the height of that particular media scare (The UK CJD Surveillance Unit, 2003) . This use of earlier epidemics to illustrate the devastating potential of SARS was one of the features of the SARS reporting which is not present in the analyses of Joffe and Haarhoff (2002) and Ungar's (1998) work on Ebola (and which warranted a new code to be added to the coding frame here). Joffe (1999) points out that the link between a new disease and previous ones is made by this anchoring mechanism, which integrates the understanding of a new phenomenon by configuring it in terms of past epidemics (e.g. AIDS was initially configured in terms of earlier epidemics which had been linked to foreigners, out groups and perverse practices). Why then are some past events and not others chosen to anchor the new phenomenon? According to Joffe (1999) , the motivation is primarily to do with identity protection, which refers simultaneously to the protection of the in-group and self-identity (and to building its cohesion by negatively distinguishing the 'other' from it). Anchors are devices that the group finds comfortable, familiar and acceptable. At the same time, the chosen representation maintains the status of certain groups in society.",

The depictions of locals as passive, that had been a feature of the Ebola coverage also received no mention in the SARS coverage. However, this is because the only mention of the (mainland) Chinese themselves in the newspapers is to describe their officials as corrupt, secretive, incompetent, chaotic or mendacious. The Chinese people themselves are not depicted as passive (as were the Africans in the Ebola reporting), but they are invisible: for example, Dr. Urbani became for the newspapers the first person to identify SARS, rather than the first WHO official. Yet the newspaper allegations of a Chinese cover-up reveal that Chinese doctors were aware of this new disease before Dr. Urbani reported it. The Chinese themselves are rarely quoted and their opinions rarely sought. The only time they are depicted is when vivid descriptions of the filth, sputum, live animals for food and so on which are clearly meant to invoke disgust at the way 'they' live. Interestingly, Hong Kong, which has only recently ceased to be a British colony, is regarded as Western from the point of view of the UK newspapers; it is only the mainland Chinese authorities and people that are treated as 'other'.",

Whether it be African local customs in the case of Ebola or Chinese ones with SARS, all confirm the African/Chinese as 'other' (and by implication inferior to 'us'). And with both Ebola and SARS, the only hope of containment is provided by the promise of (Western) biomedicine.",

The last case of this epidemic was reported in China on the 25 June 2003. On 14 July, the WHO stopped publishing a daily table of the cumulative number of reported probable cases of SARS (WHO, 2003b) (although there may of course be a recurrence of SARS in the future). SARS undoubtedly presented a serious risk to human health in the realist sense, insofar as it was contagious to people in very close contact to an affected person (family members and health care staff in particular), but very much less infectious to people in ordinary social contact with someone with the illness. It was an illness which killed around 5% of those affected, but mostly those with other underlying health problems, but which was very much less dangerous to those in the West who were well-nourished and in otherwise good health.",

These successes are in part due to vaccination programmes, leading to the global eradication of smallpox, and dramatic reductions in the Western world in the incidence of, for example, diphtheria, polio, measles, whooping cough and mumps. Biomedicine has also produced major advances in drug therapy such as antibiotics leading to dramatic reductions in incidence of tuberculosis or syphilis for example (although incidence of both diseases is beginning to rise again in the West).",

And yet despite the modernity of the medium, the message is almost comfortingly familiar: The social representation of SARS resonates with representations of infectious diseases throughout history: we lay the blame for the new threat on those outside one's own community, the 'other'.",
