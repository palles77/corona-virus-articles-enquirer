            "text": "and for the CypAAcK:Cs the CypA:Cs-complex (PDB: 1CWA 7 ) was used. The program Coot 8 was used for model building, REFMAC 9 for refinement. All structure figures were prepared with PyMOL 10 . Data collection and refinement statistics are given in Supplementary Table 2. Examples of electron density for each determined structure have been submitted as Supplementary Figure 6. Immunodepletion experiments For standardization experiments, 100 ng of different ratios of Cyp:CypAcK (40:60, 60:40, 80:20, 100:0) were incubated with 1 \u00b5g of anti-acetyl-lysine antibody and incubated at 4\u00b0C for 1 h. For depletion 25 \u00b5l of protein-A-sepharose was added. The supernatant was analysed by SDS-Page and western-blotting using anti-CypA antibody.Calcineurin-Phosphatase-AssayThe assay was performed in a microtitre format, with a final concentration Cyp;Cs range from12 \u00b5M to 187.5 nM. Assay buffer contained 100 mM Tris/HCl pH 7.5, 200 mM NaCl, 12 mM MgCl 2 , 1mM DTT, 0.05% NP-40 and 1 mM CaCl 2 . The protein buffer was phosphate free and contained 20 mM HEPES pH 6.4, 100 mM NaCl, 2 mM \u03b2-mercaptoethanol. After addition of 25 ml of calmodulin (final concentration 25 nM), and 5 ml calcineurin-Phosphatase (final concentration 0.8 U/ml) the reactions were equilibrated to 37\u00b0C for 10 min. The reaction was started by addition of RII-phosphopeptide (0.15 mM) incubated at 37\u00b0C for 90 min and stopped by addition of 100 ml of malachit green solution. After incubation for 30 min the A 620 nm was read on a microplate reader (Tecan, Safire). The inhibitory dissociation constant K i was determined using increasing concentrations of the CypA:Cs complex, plotting the obtained absorption values against those and fitting a quadratic equation to the data Homogenous and site-specific incorporation of acetyllysine into CypA. (a&b) CypA can be immunoprecipitated from HeLa and Jurkat T cells (a) and the acetylated fraction detected by anti-acetyllysine antibody in both cell types (b). Recombinant CypA and CypAAcK are present as controls. (c) Quantification of acetylated CypA in HeLa and Jurkat cells using an immunodepletion approach. Endogenous CypA from cell lysate is depleted with anti-acetyllysine antibody and compared to nondepleted material by western blot with an anti-CypA-antibody. These results show that a substantial proportion of CypA is acetylated in both HeLa and Jurkat cells. Supplementary Figure 2: Standardization of acetyated CypA immunodepletion using recombinant proteins. 100 ng of different ratios of Cyp:CypAcK (40:60, 60:40, 80:20, 100:0) were incubated with 1 \u00b5g of anti-acetyl-lysine antibody and incubated at 4\u00b0C for 1 h. For depletion 25 \u00b5l of protein-A-sepharose was added. The supernatant was analysed by SDS-PAGE and western-blotting using an anti-CypA antibody. The resulting western blot is shown together with a plot of the measured intensity of each band. The intensities represent mean values of three measurements \u00b1 s.d. Application of this standardization gives acetylated CypA levels in HeLa of 50 \u00b1 5% and in Jurkat cells of 38 \u00b1 3%. Production of recombinant acetylated CypA (a) Analysis of CypA acetylation by western blot (500 ng of CypA/CypAAcK per lane). The recombinantly expressed CypAAcK is detected with both an anti-CypA antibody and an anti-acetyllysine antibody. (b) Molecular mass determination of CypAAcK using Electrospray-ionisation-mass spectrometry (ESI-MS). Determined mass = 18947.80 g/mol, expected mass= 18948.43 g/mol. Effect of acetylation on cyclosporine binding. Fluorescence titration of Cs into CypA either non-acetylated (a) or acetylated (b). Acetylation reduces binding by approximately 20-fold. Plots represent a single titration in which each data point is the average of 20 measurements. Error bars represent mean values \u00b1 s.d. Quoted affinities represent the mean of three experiments \u00b1 s.d. Enzyme inhibition of CypA by Cs. CypA (a) and CypAcK (b) was preincubated with increasing concentrations of Cs and the remaining isomerase activity determined. An inhibition constant Ki of 1.3 \u00b1 0.2 nM for CypA and an inhibition of 27 \u00b1 5.6 nM for acetylated CypA can be calculated from the data. Acetylation modulates calcineurin inhibition. Comparison of the ability of Cs complexed with non-acetylated (a) or acetylated (b) CypA to inhibit calcineurin phosphatase activity. Acetylation reduces inhibition by 2-fold. The quoted inhibition constants (K i ) represent the average of duplicate experiments. Error bars represent mean values of three measurements \u00b1 s.d.
