The bacterial pathogens most frequently found are enteropathogenic clones of E. coli, Shigella spp., Salmonella enterica subsp., Campylobacter spp. and Aeromonas spp. The most frequently identified causative viruses (outside local epidemics) include rotavirus, caliciviruses (norovirus and sapovirus), astrovirus and enteric adenovirus. Less prevalent viruses include paramyxovirus, morbillivirus, rubivirus and reovirus. The prevalence of norovirus has been recently estimated to be 12% in children under 5 years of age hospitalized for severe diarrhea and 12% of mild and moderate diarrhea cases among patients of all ages. 12 These authors estimated that noroviruses were responsible for up to 200 000 deaths of children <5 years of age in LMIC. 12 SURVEILLANCE Not all enteric pathogens are notifiable, depending on the country. Moreover, a recent study in six US states indicated that multiple steps between onset of food-borne illness and its investigation by a public health agency could take up to 3 weeks. 6",

Indeed, diarrhea is a contagious situation where infected persons are the main source of contamination, implying the isolation of the infected person as recalled by the recent outbreak of cholera in Haiti. 7 However, some enteric pathogens are zoonotic and contaminated poorly cooked food is the source of infection, as in the case of enteroinvasive Escherichia coli strains and Campylobacter 8 and Listeria monocytogenes. 9 Contaminated water is less likely to be a source of infection except in circumstances where there is a leak between potable and unpotable water networks. Water-borne outbreaks associated with recreational water (e.g., swimming or wading pools) are another source of acute diarrhea. These are associated most frequently with Cryptosporidium (50%) in treated water sources and with toxigenic E. coli (25%) and norovirus (25%) in freshwater sources. When there is a direct transmission of water-borne and food-borne pathogens, hands are increasingly recognized as vectors of enteric pathogens. 10 Travel is increasingly reported as a circumstance for acute diarrhea, including enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) infection. Aeromonas infections have been traced to aquarium water. 11",

Acute diarrhea is a syndrome that is frequently not differentiated clinically by a specific etiologic agent. The wide spectrum of evolution varies from self-limited disease to death. Death is mainly due to dehydration and acute diarrhea takes the highest toll among children in low-and middle-income countries (LMIC). This chapter examines the viral and bacterial causes of acute diarrhea, clinically defined by three or more loose or watery stools per day or a definite decrease in consistency and increase in frequency based upon an individual baseline lasting for less than 2 weeks. Parasitic infections of the gastrointestinal tract will be presented in Section 6 and diarrhea associated with food poisoning is discussed in Chapter 37. Diarrhea associated with Clostridium difficile infection is covered in Chapter 40.

The network observed that 6% of interviewed people reported an acute diarrheal illness during the 4 weeks preceding the interview, that is an annualized rate of 0.72 episodes per person-year. Rates of illness were highest among children younger than 5 years (1.1 episodes per person-year) and were lowest in persons aged \u226565 years (0.32 episodes per person-year). 2 A study in 2000 that estimated the economic burden of both infectious and noninfectious gastrointestinal and liver disease in the USA found that the most prevalent diseases",

This co-transport mechanism remains intact during most acute diarrheal disorders. It is for this reason that oral rehydration is effective during acute diarrheal illness. Osmotic diarrhea occurs when an absorbable solute, such as lactose, is not absorbed properly and retains water in the gut lumen. Infections that damage the intestinal epithelial cells either directly (rotavirus) or by a toxin (Shigella spp.) cause malabsorption and osmotic diarrhea. Secretory diarrhea results from an active, toxin-mediated secretion of water into the gut lumen. This is observed during cholera, and infection by Shiga-toxin producing Escherichia coli and Shigella species. Rotavirus also produces a viral enterotoxin, the nonstructural glycoprotein (NSP4). Lastly, diarrhea can result from infection-mediated intestinal inflammation. After ingestion, an enteric organism colonizes the intestinal epithelium by adhering to enterocytes. One of two pathways are generally followed depending upon the offending organism, either mucosal invasion or production of an enterotoxin.",

Poultry is a major source of infection. 14 Unpasteurized dairy products and water have been found to be sources for limited outbreaks. The incidence of infection with Campylobacter spp. is higher in LMIC than in industrialized nations and travelers to LMIC are at risk of Campylobacter infection. The pathogenesis of Campylobacter infections is poorly understood. C. jejuni and C. coli are the most frequently encountered species responsible for diarrhea. Signs and symptoms may vary from asymptomatic infections to include fever, abdominal cramps and diarrhea with or without blood and fecal white blood cells. Although generally self-limiting, relapse with chronic diarrhea is possible as well as extraintestinal infection including bacteremia. C. jejuni infection is the most often recognized infection preceding the development of Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome. 15 The mechanisms rely on the cross-reactivity between ganglioside-like motifs present in C. jejuni lipopolysaccharide and those of peripheral nerves. Also, this species has been associated with immunoproliferative small intestinal disease. 16 Species other than C. jejuni and C. coli are increasingly isolated from the stools of patients with diarrhea, including C. fetus, mainly isolated from extraintestinal sites, and C. upsaliensis.

E. fergusonii is frequently isolated from stools yet its pathogenic role is non proven, and E. albertii is a possible agent of acute diarrhea. 17 There are five groups of E. coli organisms associated with acute diarrhea: Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC), also named enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC); enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC); enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC); enteroaggregative Escherichia coli (EAEC); and enteroinvasive Escherichia coli (EIEC). STEC produce one or several Shiga toxins also known as verocytotoxins and are the E. coli organisms most frequently associated with acute diarrhea in industrialized countries. These organisms, including various E. coli O157 serotypes, are responsible for mild non-bloody and bloody acute diarrhea. 18 Non-O157:H7 STEC are associated with illnesses that differ from those caused by E. coli O157:H7. Most notably, they are found later and have a lower proportion of bloody diarrhea than in patients infected with E. coli O157:H7. 19 STEC are also responsible for an estimated 80% of HUS cases in about 4% of patients with enteric infection. Ground beef has been the major vehicle of transmission of O157 STEC, although other vehicles contaminated by bovine manure have been reported, including raw milk, sausage, apple cider, and raw vegetables and nonchlorinated water supply. Also, person-to-person transmission is responsible for outbreaks in communities. ETEC produce heat-labile (LT) and heat-stable (ST) enterotoxins and are a frequent cause of acute diarrhea in LMIC, thus being a frequent cause of travelers' diarrhea. ETEC infection manifests as relatively mild watery diarrhea and abdominal cramps, but without vomiting or fever. EPEC comprise organisms characterized by an adherence factor plasmid and the chromosomal locus of enterocyte effacement. These organisms are responsible for severe infantile diarrhea in LMIC, associated with fever, vomiting and prolonged evolution. Chronic diarrhea may follow EPEC infection and be responsible for malabsorption, weight loss and growth retardation. EIEC are responsible for an infection mimicking shigellosis.",

V. fluvialis, V. furnisii and Grimontia (Vibrio) hollisae cause sporadic cases of diarrhea worldwide. 32 V. alginolyticus is occasionally isolated from stools but there is little evidence for V. alginolyticus being actually responsible for intestinal infection and diarrhea.",

Y. enterocolitica, further divided into two subspecies enterocolitica and paleartica on the basis of 16S rDNA sequencing, 33 comprises more than 70 serotypes, five of them being associated with human infection. These strains encode for an enterotoxin and some strains harbor a chromosome-borne pathogenicity island which contains the yersiniabactin gene, providing the organisms with iron. Y. enterocolitica is primarily an environmental organism isolated from the gastrointestinal tract of numerous animals, most commonly swine, dogs and rodents. Its distribution is mostly in Northern Europe and the northern USA, reflecting its increased growth at cold temperatures. This species is responsible for gastroenteritis associated with the consumption of contaminated water and food, mainly poorly cooked swine meat. The disease spectrum comprises self-limited, acute diarrhea to terminal ileitis and mesenteric lymphadenitis mimicking appendicitis. Prolonged shedding has been observed. Sepsis is an uncommon complication observed in patients with an increased iron week. Rarely, these organisms are responsible for bacteremia and extraintestinal infections in immunocompromised patients. Contacts with animals and animal foods are the sources of infection with the Enteritidis serotype, being associated with chicken and egg products. Serotype Cholerasuis is adapted to cattle and serotype Dublin is adapted to pigs. The latter serotype harbors virulence traits in common with serotype Typhi, the typhoid fever agent. Typhoid fever is a lifethreatening sepsis rarely observed in industrialized countries but still of public health concern in LMIC (see Chapter 115). Humans are the only known reservoir for serotype Typhi, which is therefore transmitted by direct person-to-person contact and through contaminated water and food. A syndrome similar to typhoid fever is due to serotypes Paratyphi A, Paratyphi B and Paratyphi C.",

This is a motile, gram-negative, facultative anaerobe bacterium which requires a small concentration of sodium for growth. V. cholerae is primarily an aquatic inhabitant found in freshwater rivers and lakes as well as in estuarine and maritime environments. In these environments, V. cholerae is isolated from both the inanimate environment and from plankton and various bivalves, crabs, shrimp and prawns. A viable-but-not-cultivable state has been described in which regulation may be phage-dependent. 31 V. cholerae comprises three major subgroups, V. cholerae O1, V. cholerae O139 and V. cholerae non-O1, widely distributed in tropical and sub-tropical areas, including the Gulf of Mexico for V. cholerae O1. V. cholerae O1 chromosomes contain virulence cassette and pathogenicity islands, encoding virulence factors such as the pilus responsible for the attachment of V. cholerae O1 organisms to the intestinal epithelium, and the cholera enterotoxin responsible for the substantial excretion of electrolytes and water in the intestinal lumen. Two biotypes, designated Classical and El Tor biotypes, can be differentiated which resist in the inanimate environment comprising contaminated surfaces, water and food. Outbreaks of norovirus infection are observed in daycare centers where child vomiting can readily contaminate floor and fomites. 50 Accordingly, direct evidence for animals as reservoirs for human infection is still lacking. Noroviruses are the most prevalent cause of nonbacterial acute enteritis worldwide. 51 These viruses cause large outbreaks and provoke incapacitation for a few days; they have therefore been included in the list B of potential bioterrorism agents by the NIAID. Outbreaks mainly occur in institutions including healthcare centers. Cruise ships appear to be an emerging setting for norovirus infection. Also, air flight has been shown to be a circumstance for norovirus diarrhea, for both cabin crew and passengers. 52 The inanimate environment in healthcare centers is also a source for norovirus infection, and the viruses are resistant to routine cleansing and routine alcohol hand hygiene. 53 The diagnosis can be made within 10 minutes at point-of-care thanks to commercially available immunochromatographic tests.",

Based on group-specific antigens of the major viral structural protein VP6, rotaviruses can be classified in six groups A to G. Groups A to C infect humans, the other groups are found in animals. Human rotaviruses are responsible for severe acute diarrhea with dehydration associated with childhood death in low-and middleincome countries. In Europe, children with rotavirus-positive acute gastroenteritis were more likely to have lethargy, fever, vomiting and dehydration, and, therefore, more severe disease than were children with rotavirus-negative acute gastroenteritis. Dehydration was up to 5.5 times more likely in children with rotavirus-positive acute gastroenteritis than in those with rotavirus-negative acute gastroenteritis. 49 Acquisition of rotaviruses is likely from subclinical infection in parents or siblings but rotavirus infection can be a zoonosis. Rotaviruses are resistant in the inanimate environment which may participate as a source of infection, including nosocomial outbreaks. Rotavirus infection is seasonal, with a peak of incidence in winter/spring in temperate countries. Clinical symptoms include acute diarrhea for 2-3 days, fever, vomiting and anorexia. Rapid diagnosis at the point-of-care can be achieved within 15 minutes by using a commercially available lateral-flow assay with parallel detection of adenovirus.",

Noroviruses comprise five genotypes, the genotypes I, II and IV are responsible for human infections, the two other genogroups being animal-associated. Likewise, sapoviruses comprise five genogroups, the genotypes I, II, IV and V are responsible for human infections. These human viruses are highly contagious viruses Paratyphi C serotypes. O serotype determination is done by agglutination using pooled antisera while further H serotype determination is done by tube agglutination tests using broth culture and testing the two phases of the flagellar antigens. Campylobacter spp. are recovered by using the filtration method in parallel to selective, blood-containing or non-blood containing media and a micro-aerophilic atmosphere. Some Campylobacter spp. require 6% hydrogen in atmosphere. A 42 \u00b0C incubation temperature allows the growth of C. jejuni and C. coli but not all Campylobacter and Aeromonas spp. are recovered using blood agar incorporating 20 \u00b5g/mL ampicillin and produce \u03b2-hemolytic colonies. Further identification should be done for oxidase-positive and indole-positive colonies. Modified cefsulodin-irgasan-novobiocin agar is also suitable for the isolation of Aeromonas species. The interpretation of recovery of Aeromonas in stools must be cautious since there is no strong evidence that all Aeromonas isolates from stools are responsible for diarrheal infection. 72 Blood cultures are mandatory for the diagnosis of typhoid fever as well as bacteremia due to non-Typhi serotypes of Salmonella.",

Growth of Y. enterocolitica from stools is enhanced by incubation of selective media at 35 \u00b0C. A pectin agar should be used for the isolation of Y. enterocolitica from stools. V. cholerae will be visible as very motile, gram-negative slightly curved bacilli cultivated using a TCBS agar after enrichment. Yellow colonies of oxidase-negative bacilli can be confirmed, by 16S rDNA sequencing. In parallel to the search for pathogenic bacteria, the search for viruses should be done using electron microscope observation after negative staining as well as detection of rotavirus. Identification of bacterial colonies is now routinely done by using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. 73 Management Management of acute diarrhea should include the clinical evaluation of the patient, including risk factors for specific etiology and dehydration; rapid diagnosis of viral diarrhea; and treatment, including rehydration, antibiotic treatment and symptomatic treatment. Rehydration is a major therapeutic measure. Oral rehydration has a higher risk of paralytic ileus, but intravenous rehydration exposes patients to risks of intravenous therapy. For every 25 children treated with oral rehydration one will fail and require intravenous rehydration. 74 Rapid diagnosis of viral diarrhea is important in order to avoid unnecessary antibiotic treatment. Because of the absence of any antiviral drug effective against the viruses responsible for acute diarrhea, the management of viral diarrhea comprises the relief of symptoms and rehydration. Most acute diarrhea episodes are self-limiting and do not require antibiotic treatment. Meta-analysis has confirmed that antibiotic treatment is useful to shorten the duration of signs and symptoms in travelers' acute diarrhea. 75 When antibiotics should be prescribed, fluoroquinolones are the drugs of first choice, and one-day treatment is advocated except for Campylobacter and Shigella infections, which may be treated for three days. 76 In the case of patients returned from countries where fluoroquinolone resistance is prevalent, such as Campylobacter spp. in Thailand, azithromycin (500 mg \u00d71/d) could be used for three days (see also Chapter 37 and Practice Point 11). 77 Antimicrobial therapy for O157 E. coli enteritis remains a controversial issue because some studies reported a deleterious effect on the evolution of hemolytic uremic syndrome. The increasing resistance of S. enterica Typhi to antibiotics, notably to ciprofloxacin, makes the choice of first-line antibiotic treatment of typhoid fever more problematic (see Chapter 115). The majority of Y. enterocolitis gastroenteritis does not require antibiotic treatment, contrary to systemic infection which could be treated using trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (no resistant strain reported) or fluoroquinolones, despite the fact that a few resistant strains have been reported. 78 References available online at expertconsult.com.",

Serologic testing is useful for epidemiologic investigation of Campylobacter species infections. 64 Fresh stools should be collected in a clean container with a tight lid. Alternatively, a transport medium incorporating buffered glycerol in saline can be used. Rectal swab is an alternative specimen in selected situations. It is well established that hospitalized patients who did not enter the hospital with diarrhea are unlikely to develop diarrhea caused by other bacterial agents than C. difficile; therefore, stool culture should not be performed in patients hospitalized for more than 72 hours (the three-day rule) and a rapid detection of C. difficile toxins should be performed. 65 For routine purposes, testing a single stool specimen has acceptable sensitivity but testing a second specimen is mandatory when the first one had a more than 2-hour delay in transport. 66 Several techniques have been developed for the point-of-care diagnosis of diarrhea including the rapid (<30 minutes) agglutinationbased detection of rotavirus and adenovirus as well as the detection of C. difficile toxins. The rapid detection of C. difficile toxins A and B should be routinely performed for both out-clinic patients and hospitalized patients. Point-of-care detection of Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli in children using EIA has not been evaluated favorably. 67 A commercially available Campylobacter antigen detection kit has been favorably evaluated. 68 A dipstick test for the rapid detection of Shigella is under evaluation. 69 Multiplex real-time PCR assays are now commercially available for a 1-3-hour diagnosis of bacteria virus and parasites. 70 Further detection of the causative organism relies on stool examination in the clinical microbiology laboratory. Direct microscopic examination may yield motile bacteria such as Vibrio and Salmonella species and parasites. Although Gram-staining analysis of stool specimens may not be routinely done, it has demonstrated 66-94% sensitivity and >95% specificity for the rapid detection of Campylobacter species. 71 Culture of stools will focus on frequent pathogens and the systematic query of less frequent bacterial pathogens will be guided by the local epidemiologic situation. Pathogens routinely detected by culture of diarrheal stools include O157 E. coli, Shigella spp., S. enterica serotypes, C. jejuni and C. coli and Aeromonas spp. Enrichment of stools in O157, O111 and O26 serotypes of E. coli can be done by using specific, commercially available magnetic beads. Sorbitol MacConkey agar should be used for the isolation of O157 STEC as these organisms do not ferment D-sorbitol, contrary to the vast majority of other E. coli strains. S. enterica serotypes are better isolated by using an enrichment broth before plating onto selective media. Biochemical identification of Salmonella spp. and O (somatic), H (flagellar) and Vi (capsular) antigen serotyping should be performed in order to identify Salmonella enteritis Typhi (the typhoid fever agent, being capsular antigen Vi positive) and the most prevalent non-Typhi serotypes.
