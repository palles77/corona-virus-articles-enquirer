The finding of abundant activated hemophagocytic macrophages, or histiocytes, has led to their classification as a histiocytic disorder [3] . The underlying pathogenesis of MAS is poorly understood, but it is proposed to be triggered by an inciting event such as infection, malignancy, autoimmune conditions, or drugs, that leads to immune dysregulation [4] . The resultant overwhelming cytokine storm drives phagocytosis of blood cell precursors and the infiltration of macrophages into tissues, causing multiorgan dysfunction. Currently, there are no diagnostic criteria for MAS in adults, and the proposed classification criteria rely on our understanding from the pediatric population [1] . The findings of high fevers, cytopenias, hyperferritinemia, and hypertriglyceridemia should alert the clinician to the possibility of MAS.",

Of the two cases that described the timing of MAS relative to TNF inhibitor administration, one was in a patient with RA 2 months after discontinuation of etanercept, and one was in AoSD 2 months after initiation of adalimumab [12, 14] . Four of the cases reported had associated infections, including visceral leishmaniasis, disseminated histoplasmosis, liver abscess, or primary EBV, which were felt to be the primary trigger for MAS, though the TNF inhibitor was implicated as a contributing risk factor for the infection [8, 13, 15] .

These medications have been successful in treating some refractory cases of MAS, but their use may also rarely induce or aggravate autoimmune diseases, or trigger MAS in the setting of infection [1] . It has been proposed that TNF inhibitor blockade of macrophage activity is coupled with a compensatory immune system activation and rebound cytokine response [16] . This leads to an overall immune system dysregulation and may trigger hemophagocytosis. The explanation for this paradoxical effect on immune response will require further research.",

Two patients died despite receiving highdose corticosteroids; however, these patients presented with severe or late systemic disease that was previously not well controlled on prednisone [9, 12] . In the cases of MAS with an associated infection, three of the four patients received highdose corticosteroids in addition to treatment of underlying infection, and all four patients responded well and survived [8, 13, 15] . In the three reported cases of MAS in SpA, all three patients received high-dose prednisone and clinically stabilized [7, 8] . Dual treatment with high-dose steroids and anakinra, an IL-1 receptor antagonist, induced remission in our patient. Both agents have been shown to rapidly induce remission and ameliorate the cytokine storm in refractory and severe cases of MAS [4] . Anakinra was trialed first in our patient given his prolonged and high fevers, but given the Antibiotics (amoxicillin, clavulonic acid, erythromycin), IV immunoglobulin (2 g/kg), and 7 methylprednisolone boluses followed by prednisone",
