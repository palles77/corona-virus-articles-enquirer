Consider as you read a hypothetical proposed by David Fidler, a law professor at Indiana University. Professor Fidler imagined a scene in which Dr. Evil, who is considering possible targets for a bioterrorist attack, seeks legal advice. Rumpole the Malevolent, his lawyer, advises Dr. Evil that \"[y]our ideal legal target for a bioweapon attack is a country that, first of all, has a fragmented legal system, in that relevant legal powers to respond to a public health emergency are divided among actors at the national and local levels. Federalism is, for instance, a fragmented legal system\" (Fidler, 2001) . Should the United States change its system? Is it feasible to do so?",

            "text": "When the colonies first formed the United States, there was no national public health law. In a time when traveling any significant distance was rare, infectious disease outbreaks and epidemics were often localized, to an extent that is difficult to imagine today. Recall from Chapter 1 that the Supreme Court stated in Jacobson v. Massachusetts that enactment of quarantine and other health laws fell within the \"police power\" of each state. Before 1796, quarantines were solely the responsibility of state and local governments. Early federal involvement was minor. When Congress first passed a law to address quarantine, in 1796, it simply allowed the national government to assist state governments in the event of disease outbreaks. That general policy preference has endured. The structure of public health law today continues to be based on the premise that state and local health officials will, at least initially, take lead responsibility for most public health emergencies. But the federal role has grown dramatically.",

Moreover, their illnesses threatened the mercantile trade that was essential to the economy of the fledging nation. The origins of what is now the U.S. Public Health Service (PHS) began in 1798, when Congress established a fund to provide treatment for sick and injured merchant seamen.",

The trend toward federal control began after the Civil War. In 1870, the Secretary of the Treasury, in whose department the marine hospital fund was administered, initiated a major organizational reform of the system.",

The Treasury Department realigned the loose network of remaining hospitals into a Marine Hospital Service (MHS), administered centrally. A new position of supervising surgeon (later, the Surgeon general) was created to oversee the MHS. The second major event resulted from an 1877 yellow fever epidemic that spread rapidly from new orleans up the Mississippi River, a signal to the nation that increased mobility made localized control of infectious disease inadequate. Congress reacted by passing the national Quarantine Act of 1878, which conferred quarantine authority for the first time on a federal government agency, the MHS, and authorized the construction of federal quarantine facilities.",

They began wearing uniforms and served in the MHS as troops did in the military, subject to deployment to sites where they were needed. This development was formalized in 1889, with the renaming of the MHS physician group as the Commissioned Corps. In 1902, Congress changed the organizational name again, to the Public Health and Marine Hospital Service. Today, there remains a Commissioned Corps of health care professionals (including dentists, nurses, and pharmacists as well as doctors) in the PHS.",

It had served an important role in the Spanish-American War in 1898, when PHS doctors cared for wounded service members and operated quarantine stations to prevent troops infected with yellow fever from returning to the states from Cuba or Puerto Rico. The 1902 legislation authorized the President to use PHS officers in times of threatened or actual war. President Wilson signed an Executive order in 1917 that provided for the PHS to be deployed in World War I. A 1943 law went further and authorized the President to convert the PHS into a military service during times of war.",

This development came because the governments of states where major ports were located wanted to shift the cost of immigration-related health examinations and monitoring to Washington, where there was more expertise and a larger budget. In addition, local politics fostered graft. Politicians often rewarded supporters by appointing them as health officers to oversee incoming ships, a situation ripe for corruption. By 1921, all of the states had relinquished their role in policing persons and goods coming to the United States from abroad.",

Such assessments generally occur on a voluntary basis with the consent of the ill passenger. Where the quarantine officer reasonably believes that an ill passenger has a quarantinable disease, and the passenger is otherwise non-compliant, the quarantine officer may order the provisional quarantine of the passenger by serving the passenger with a written order, verbally ordering that the passenger be provisionally quarantined, or by ordering that actual restrictions be placed on a non-compliant passenger. The quarantine officer's reasonable belief would be informed by objective scientific evidence such as clinical criteria indicative of one of the specified quarantinable diseases, e.g., high fever, respiratory distress, and/or chills, accompanied by epidemiologic criteria such as travel to or from an affected area and/or contact with known cases.",

A provisional quarantine order is likely to be premised on the need to investigate based on reasonable suspicion of exposure or infection, whereas a quarantine order is more likely to be premised on a medical determination that the individual actually has one of the quarantinable diseases. Thus, during this initial three business day period, there may be very little for a hearing officer to review in terms of factual and scientific evidence of exposure or infection. Three business days may be necessary to collect medical samples, transport such samples to laboratories, and conduct diagnostic testing, all of which would help inform the Director's determination that the individual is infected with a quarantinable disease and that further quarantine is necessary.",
