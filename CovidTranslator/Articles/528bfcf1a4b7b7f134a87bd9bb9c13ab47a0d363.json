Here, we review recent progress from the field of pDC biology, focusing on: the molecular mechanisms that regulate pDC development and functions; the pathways involved in their sensing of pathogens and endogenous nucleic acids; the function of pDCs at mucosal sites; and their roles in infections, autoimmunity and cancer.",

The CDP is characterized by lack of lineage markers (LIN) and expression of Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3, also known as CD135), macrophage colony-stimulating factor receptor (M-CSFR, also known as CD115) and the receptor tyrosine kinase KIT (also known as CD117) 22-26 . Recently, a clonogenic progenitor downstream of CDP with prominent pDC potential has been reported 27 . This progenitor is LIN \u2212 KIT int/lo FLT3 + IL-7R\u03b1 \u2212 and does not express M-CSFR. It expresses high levels of E2-2 (also known as TCF4), the transcription factor that defines the pDC lineage 28 , and can be derived from CDPs under conditions in which is E2-2 is upregulated, i.e. exposure to M-CSF or thrombopoietin. A subsequent step in pDC development is the generation of a CCR9 \u2212 pDC-like common DC precursor that expresses some of the phenotypic markers of mature pDCs, such as CD11c, B220 and SiglecH, but has low or negligible levels of MHC class II and CCR9. This CCR9 \u2212 pDC-like common DC precursor retains the potential to differentiate into either pDCs or cDCs, depending on the tissue environment 29,30 . Therefore, the conversion of progenitors into pDCs or cDCs may happen not only at the CDP stage of development, but also closer to terminal pDC differentiation.",

However, pDCs can also secrete other pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, including interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-12, CXC-chemokine ligand 8 (CXCL8), CXCL10, CC-chemokine ligand 3 (CCL3) and CCL4. Moreover, expression of MHC class II and costimulatory molecules enables pDCs to present antigens to CD4 + T cells. Thus, the biology of pDCs is multifaceted (Figure 1 ).",

Human pDCs also continue to be extensively studied with a view to understanding their potential roles in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases, cancer and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection.

Human pDCs also express CD4, CD68, ILT3 and the receptor for IL-3 (also known as CD123). Accordingly, IL-3 mediates human pDC survival in vitro 3 . CD2 is a cell adhesion molecule that is expressed by a subset of human pDCs 13 . CD2 hi pDCs produce lysozyme, but whether this endows them with the capacity to lyse bacteria is unknown. The markers most commonly used to identify pDCs in mice are CD11c, B220, Ly6C, bone marrow stromal antigen 2 (BST2) and SIGLEC-H. In contrast to human pDCs, which are CD11c \u2212 , mouse pDCs express intermediate levels of CD11c . BST2 (also known as Tetherin 14 ) is fairly specific to pDCs and plasma cells in steady-state conditions but is induced on many cell types following exposure to type I and type II IFNs 15 . In cell suspensions from primary and secondary lymphoid organs, SIGLEC-H expression is mainly confined to pDCs 16, 17 and is downregulated upon activation 18 . However, specialized macrophage subsets in the spleen, lymph nodes and brain also express SIGLEC-H 17, 19 . In addition, studies in reporter mice have confirmed Siglech mRNA transcription in progenitor cells 18, 20, 21 . Mouse pDCs can also express CD8\u03b1 and, like human pDCs, CD4. In peripheral tissues, the majority of mouse pDCs express CC chemokine receptor 9 (CCR9), Ly49Q and SCA1; however, in the bone marrow these markers distinguish pDC subsets that differ in developmental stage and/or activation state (Box 1).",

FLT3 and its ligand (FLT3L) are crucial for pDC development 35 . In the absence of FLT3 signaling, pDCs are reduced in number in the lymphoid organs and bone marrow of mice 36, 37 . FLT3L promotes pDC development through activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3)-and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)-dependent activation of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) 38, 39 . LAMTOR2 is a member of the Ragulator complex known to inhibit mTOR signaling. Conditional deletion of LAMTOR2 in CD11c + cells (which include cDCs and pDCs) causes accumulation of FLT3 on the cell surface and massive expansion of pDC and cDC populations in older mice 40 . Recently, it was shown that FLT3L and type I IFN act synergistically to promote pDC development from common lymphoid progenitors by inducing upregulation of FLT3 41 . In addition to FLT3 signaling, M-CSF (also known as CSF1) may support the generation of pDCs 42 . Indeed, pDCs can be derived from M-CSFR + CDP 23, 27 and Csf1 \u2212/\u2212 mice have reduced numbers of both pDCs and cDCs 43 . By contrast, the growth factor GM-CSF inhibits FLT3L-driven pDC development 44 . GM-CSF-induced STAT5 signaling abolishes pDCrelated gene expression in FLT3 + progenitors and inhibits the transcription factor interferon regulatory factor 8 (IRF8), which is crucial for pDC development, as discussed below 45 .",

E2-2, along with the transcription factors E12, E47 and HEB (also known as TCF12), make up the E family of class I basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors 47 . E proteins form homodimers or heterodimers with each other and bind to conserved E box sequences, a process that can be perturbed by inhibitor of differentiation (ID) proteins. E2-2 binds to a large fraction of pDC-enriched genes and continuous expression of E2-2 in pDCs is required to maintain cell fate 28, 48 . Deletion of E2-2 in mature pDCs causes the loss of pDC-associated markers, spontaneous differentiation into cDC-like cells, upregulation of MHC class II molecules and, ultimately, an increase in the ability to prime T cells 48 . These cDC-like cells are similar to the steadystate noncanonical CX3CR1 + CD8\u03b1 + DC population that is related to pDCs 49 . CX3CR1 + CD8\u03b1 + DCs require E2-2 for development, harbor Ig heavy-chain (IgH) D-J rearrangements and are enriched for pDC-specific genes; however, they do not produce type I IFN in response to influenza virus and lack surface expression of classical pDC markers like B220 and BST2. Thus, noncanonical CX3CR1 + CD8\u03b1 + DCs may represent an alternative fate of pDC-committed cells that are unable to reach or maintain high enough levels of E2-2.",

Mice that express low levels of IKAROS lack peripheral pDCs, but not other DC subsets, and are impaired in their ability to produce type I IFNs in response to TLR7 or TLR9 ligands 222 . PU.1 directly regulates FLT3 expression in a concentration-dependent manner and is necessary for both pDC and cDC development 223 . XBP1 is a target of the unfolded protein response sensor IRE-1\u03b1 that maintains endoplasmic reticulum (ER) homeostasis and prevents activation of cell death pathways 224 . XBP1 deficiency results in impaired survival and reduced numbers of pDCs and cDCs 225 . Treatment of pDCs with the proteasome inhibitor Bortezomib reduces the active form of XBP1 and suppresses pDC survival and immunostimulatory functions by targeting ER homeostasis and the intracellular trafficking of TLRs 226 . Hypoxia-inducible factors influence hematopoiesis and maintain HSC function. Recently, it was shown that low oxygen content upregulates ID2 and suppresses FLT3L-induced pDC development, in a manner dependent on HIF1\u03b1 227 . GFI1 controls the development and functions of pDCs and cDCs in a STAT3dependent manner 228 and represses Rag transcription in pDCs 229 . NAB2 is a transcriptional corepressor that induces TRAIL expression in activated pDCs 230 . TRAILexpressing pDCs are tumoricidal 231 and induce apoptosis of CD4 + T cells in HIV viremic patients or after exposure to HTLV1 [232] [233] [234] .",

            "text": "The recognition of viruses or self nucleic acids by pDCs is mainly mediated by TLR7 and TLR9, which are located in endosomal compartments. Activation of these receptors in pDCs results in secretion of type I IFNs via the MyD88-IRF7 pathway as well as production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines via the MyD88-NF-\u03baB pathway (reviewed in [6] [7] [8] Whether engagement of TLR7 or TLR9 results in the production of type I IFN or proinflammatory cytokines depends on the type of compartment in which these TLRs encounter their ligands ( Figure 4 ) 93, 94 . Multimeric CpG-A oligonucleotides aggregate in early endosomes where they activate the MyD88-IRF7 pathway that induces type I IFNs. In contrast, monomeric CpG-B is transferred to an endolysosomal compartment, where it activates the MyD88-NF-\u03baB pathway that triggers expression of costimulatory molecules and pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion. IkappaB kinase-alpha (IKK\u03b1) 95 , osteopontin 96 and mTOR 97 are key components of the MyD88-IRF7 signaling pathway, while IRF5 is essential for MyD88-NF-\u03baB signaling 98, 99 . Trafficking of TLR9 to the subcellular compartment for type I IFN production is dependent on adapter protein 3 (AP3), as virus-or CpG-induced type I IFN expression is abolished in the absence of AP3 100, 101 . Forward genetic approaches have further identified Slc15a4, which encodes the peptide/histidine transporter 1 (PHT1), and BLOC1 and BLOC2 Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome proteins as key components required for TLR9 signaling in pDCs but not in other cell types 101 . However, TLR9-mediated recognition of large DNA-containing immune complexes is independent of AP3 102 and requires the convergence of phagocytic and autophagic pathways. This process is called microtubule-associated protein 1A/1B-light chain 3 (LC3)associated phagocytosis (LAP) and involves autophagy-related proteins but not the conventional autophagic pre-initiation complex. Recognition of live, single stranded RNA (ssRNA) viruses by TLR7 in pDCs also occurs in a distinct subcellular compartment that requires transport of cytosolic viral replication intermediates into the lysosome by autophagy 103 .",

The scavenger receptor SCARB2/LIMP-2 is highly expressed in pDCs and regulates TLR9dependent type I IFN production by mediating TLR9 endosomal translocation and IRF7 nuclear translocation 104 . Phospholipid scramblase 1 (PLSCR1) is a TLR9-interacting protein that regulates TLR9 trafficking to endosomal compartments and type I IFN production in pDCs 105 . PACSIN1 is an endocytic adapter specifically expressed in mouse and human pDCs that is essential for TLR9-induced type I IFN secretion but not pro-inflammatory cytokine production 54, 106 . VIPERIN is an IFN-inducible antiviral protein that promotes TLR7 and TLR9 signaling in pDCs by recruiting IL-1 receptor-associated kinase 1 (IRAK1) and TNF receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6) to lipid bodies and inducing nuclear translocation of IRF7 107 . In addition to having a role in pDC migration, DOCK2 is essential for TLR7-and TLR9-mediated type I IFN production in pDCs, most likely because of its influence on actin cytoskeleton and vesicular trafficking 108 . In the absence of DOCK2, phosphorylation of IKK\u03b1 and nuclear translocation of IRF7 are impaired in pDCs, but the capacity to produce pro-inflammatory cytokines is maintained. TLR9, but not TLR7, signaling is also dependent on Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) 109 . Blocking BTK inhibits all TLR9-induced responses in pDCs, including cytokine production and expression of costimulatory molecules. Additional studies are required to provide an integrated view of how all these molecules coordinate the trafficking and signaling properties of TLR7/9containing vesicles in pDCs.",

Although TLR11 and TLR12 can both recognize profilin, TLR12 is sufficient for profilin detection in pDCs and triggers the production of IL-12 and type I IFNs, which activate NK cells 110 . Furthermore, in contrast to Tlr11 \u2212/\u2212 mice, Tlr12 \u2212/\u2212 mice are highly susceptible to T. gondii infection, which suggests a critical role for pDCs in the induction of the innate immune response and host resistance. PSA is an immunomodulatory molecule expressed by the ubiquitous gut microorganism Bacteriodes fragilis 112 . pDCs exposed to PSA via TLR2 express MHC class II, inducible costimulatory ligand (ICOSL) as well as CD86, and stimulate IL-10 production by CD4 + T cells, all of which are required for protection against colitis 111 .",

Antigen presentation by pDCs can lead to CD4 + T cell activation or tolerance induction, depending on the context (Figure 1 ). When pDCs receive activation signals through TLRs or other pattern recognition receptors, they act as immunogenic cells. When pDCs are either unstimulated or alternatively activated such that they express indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) [135] [136] [137] [138] , ICOSL 139 , OX40L 140 , programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) 141 and/or granzyme B 142 , they promote tolerance to tumor cells, alloantigens and harmless antigens. Recent studies have proposed that pDCs that capture antigens in peripheral tissues utilize CCR9 to migrate to the thymus, where they induce deletion of antigen-specific thymocytes, thus contributing to immune tolerance 77 . It has also been reported that CCR9 + pDCs are potent inducers of regulatory T (T Reg ) cell function and can inhibit acute graft-versus-host disease induced by allogeneic CD4 + donor T cells in irradiated recipients 143 . This study defined pDCs as being either B220 + CD11c + CCR9 + or B220 + CD11c + CCR9 \u2212 , the former being the tolerogenic subset; however, a later study argued that B220 + CD11c + CCR9 \u2212 cells are not a subset of pDCs, but rather precursors of lymphoid tissue-resident cDCs 144 . In a mouse model of lung inflammation, adoptive transfer of CD8\u03b1 + pDCs suppressed the development of airway hyper-reactivity by inducing T Reg cells 145 ; however, it has been reported that CD8 subunit expression by mouse pDCs is variable and does not define stable subsets 146 . Corroborating this, earlier studies found that CD8\u03b1 is expressed by a fraction of pDCs in the steady-state but is induced on the majority of pDCs after activation 9, 147 . Thus, the role of pDC subsets in tolerance remains to be further explored.",

Antigens targeted to pDCs through DCIR are also presented to T cells 120 . In mice, it was shown that targeting a T cell epitope derived from myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) to pDCs via SIGLEC-H delays onset and decreases disease severity in a model of MOG-induced experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) by reducing the expansion and polarization of Th1 and Th17 cell populations 149 . In contrast, antigen delivery to pDCs via BST2 in combination with TLR agonists generates robust cellular and humoral immunity and protects mice against subsequent viral infection or tumor growth 150 . Thus, targeting antigen to pDCs can either promote or inhibit antigen-specific immune responses, depending on the antigen formulation and mode of stimulation or delivery.",

Human pDCs have recycling endosomes in which peptides can be continuously loaded on to MHC class I molecules, which enables efficient presentation of viral antigens to CD8 + T cells 153 . Through this mechanism, pDCs may contribute to adaptive responses during viral infections. 155 . Only in the case of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) and HSV-2 infections has pDC-derived type I IFN been shown to be critical for viral control in mice, reducing both morbidity and mortality [156] [157] [158] . A recent study found that individuals carrying inactivating mutations in the IRF7 gene have a severe defect in pDC function and are selectively susceptible to influenza virus infections 159 . It remains to be determined whether the pDC defect is sufficient to cause susceptibility to influenza or if IRF7 has a more general impact on the capacity of all cells to respond to the virus. Paradoxically, pDC responses to acute viral infections may not always be beneficial. Recent evidence indicates that excessive production of type I IFNs, probably by pDCs, during influenza virus infection in 129 mice can result in uncontrolled inflammation and TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL)-mediated apoptosis of bronchial epithelium 160 . Thus, the impact of pDCs on acute viral infections may vary considerably depending on the virus, route of infection and genetic background.",

In mouse, constitutive absence of pDCs or loss of their ability to signal through TLR7 and TLR9 in chronic LCMV infection appears to negatively impact T cell priming and viral clearance 157, 172 . Moreover, early administration of exogenous type I IFN prevents chronic LCMV infection. However, late type I IFN administration has no beneficial effects 173 . In fact, blockade of type I IFN signaling during chronic LCMV infection improves T cell function and diminishes viral persistence 174, 175 . Thus, there is a window of opportunity -i.e. early during infection -when type I IFNs and pDCs can be both beneficial and necessary to prevent or control chronic viral infection and preserve T cell numbers and functions. Sustained activation of pDCs is also detrimental in SLE because it results in the resistance of pDCs to therapeutic glucocorticoids (GC), which are often administered to patients with SLE to control inflammation 182, 183 . Bioinformatics and functional analyses have suggested that TLR activation prevents GC-induced pDC apoptosis by inhibiting miR-29b and miR-29c, which promote pDC apoptosis by targeting MCL1 and BCL2 184 . Endogenous GC also have an impact on pDC homeostasis and survival 185 . Regulation of endogenous GC concentrations involves conversion of inactive substrates to active 11hydroxyglucocorticoids by an enzyme complex containing 11\u03b2-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (11\u03b2HSD1) and hexose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (H6PDH). Under physiologic conditions, 11\u03b2HSD1-H6PDH increases the sensitivity of pDCs to GC-induced apoptosis; however, following activation with TLR ligands, the effects of enzyme activity are overridden. Genetic models that specifically address the contribution of pDCs in autoimmunity have been lacking until recently.

Analysis of MRL.Fas lpr mice lacking MyD88 showed that MyD88-dependent production of IFN-\u03b1 by pDCs contributes to SLE pathogenesis, particularly B lymphopenia, but not to nephritis 190 . Two recent studies using lupus-prone mice that specifically lack pDCs have confirmed that pDCs are pathogenic in SLE. Global or CD11c-specific Tcf4 haplodeficiency in lupus-prone mice nearly abolishes autoantibody production and glomerulonephritis 191 , whereas transient depletion of pDCs prior to disease initiation in BXSB mice impairs expansion and activation of B and T cells and reduces antinuclear antibodies and expression of type I IFN-induced genes in tissues 192 . Taken together, these studies validate pDCs as a therapeutic target in SLE.",

Viral clearance and protection against reinfection with rotavirus, an intestinal pathogen, is highly dependent on B cells 206 . Type I IFN production by human and mouse pDCs exposed to rotavirus appears to be necessary for B cell activation, virus-specific antibody secretion and viral clearance during infection 206 . How the microbiota influences pDC functions is largely unknown, but an earlier study found that colonization of the intestine with a restricted microflora resulted in lysis of pDCs by activated cytotoxic T lymphocytes 207 .

Injection of activated pDCs loaded with tumor-associated peptides into metastatic melanoma patients leads to favorable CD4 and CD8 T cell responses, indicating that vaccination strategies employing activated pDCs might be an attractive therapeutic strategy to overcome immune tolerance in certain types of cancer 244 . In an orthotopic murine mammary tumor model, intratumoral administration of a TLR7 ligand results in tumor-associated pDC activation and has a potent anti-tumor effect 245 . In the B16 melanoma mouse model, TLR-stimulated pDCs mediate tumor killing through expression of TRAIL and granzyme B 75 as well as through the activation of NK cells 246 . The ability of pDCs to produce cytolytic mediators and the functional relevance of this capacity in the elimination of target cells and immune regulation has been extensively debated; however, it has been shown that the FSME-IMMUN vaccine against tick-borne encephalitis stimulates pDCs to upregulate neural cell adhesion molecule 1 (NCAM1, also known as CD56) and TRAIL expression, thereby generating a subset of pDCs that combines the abilities of interferon production and antigen presentation with that of lysing target cells 247 . CD56 expression is also typical of several neoplastic human pDC tumors 248 .",

This observation raises the question of whether pDC and type I IFN depletion is a valid strategy for all SLE patients or should be adopted after stratification of the patients for pDC activity. Recent studies suggest that pDC dysfunction in autoimmune and inflammatory diseases may extend to scleroderma 212 , Sj\u00f6gren syndrome 213 , Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome 214 and atherosclerosis 215 . Is there a role for pDCs in other inflammatory diseases such as IBD? Is manipulation or elimination of pDCs a feasible therapeutic strategy for some of these diseases? Whether pDCs are valid targets during viral infections remains a matter of debate. While pDC activation may be beneficial at early stages of infection, depletion of pDCs may be considered during chronic viral infections, such as HIV, when type I IFN may exert negative effects.",

It will be important to continue to identify pDC-specific genes that can be used for development of pDC lineage-specific deficient mice and pDC-specific Cre deleters. With the recognition of pDC involvement in human pathologies, it is predicted that these cells will be more extensively evaluated for diagnostic and prognostic purposes. Indeed, it will be interesting to explore the therapeutic potential of monoclonal antibodies that selectively target pDCs in many of the disease scenarios discussed above.",

            "text": "Nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB) signaling that is induced by certain members of the tumour necrosis factor receptor superfamily and predominantly activates p52-RELB NF-\u03baB complexes. By contrast, canonical (or classical) NF-\u03baB signaling typically involves the activation of p50-RELA dimers and is induced by a wider range of pro-inflammatory stimuli The development of pDCs from CDPs is regulated by specific cytokines and transcription factors. FLT3L-STAT3 signaling promotes expression of E2-2, which is the master transcription factor required for pDC development. The absence of E2-2 or its deletion in mature pDCs results in the complete loss of pDCs or the differentiation of pDC-committed cells into cDC-like cells, respectively. In contrast, GM-CSF-STAT5 signaling blocks pDC differentiation during DC development by inducing expression of ID2, which is an antagonist of E2-2. The transcriptional cofactor MTG16 promotes pDC differentiation and restricts cDC development in part by repressing ID2. Transcriptional targets of E2-2 encode proteins associated with pDC development, homeostasis and function. SPIB, BCL11A and IRF8 are necessary for pDC differentiation and/or survival while RUNX2 controls pDC homeostasis through expression of the chemokine receptors CCR2 and CCR5, which permit egress from the bone marrow. CIITA promotes MHC class II expression. BDCA2, ILT7 and SIGLEC-H are markers that are selectively expressed by human or mouse pDCs and are involved in regulation of type I IFN production. TLR7, TLR9 and PACSIN1 enable pDC recognition of nucleic acids and pathogens (i.e. RNA and DNA viruses), resulting in type I IFN secretion and/or pro-inflammatory cytokine production. Swiecki pDCs express chemokine receptors and homing molecules that promote recruitment in the steady-state and during inflammation. Development of pDCs in bone marrow (BM) stromal cell niche requires CXCR4 expression, while pDC egress from the BM into the blood is dependent on CCR5 and CCR2. pDCs are attracted to tumors that produce CXCL12 (not shown) and the splenic white pulp via CXCR4. DOCK2, a hematopoietic cell-specific CDM family protein involved in CXCR4 signaling, is also necessary for pDC migration to spleen and lymph nodes (LNs). pDCs express CD62L, PSGL-1, \u03b21/\u03b22 integrins and the chemokine receptors CCR5, CXCR3 and CCR7 which mediate adhesion and chemotaxis to peripheral LNs and the splenic white pulp under normal and/or inflammatory conditions. Blood pDCs express the chemerin receptor, ChemR23, as well as A1-R, C3aR and C5aR, which may guide them to peripheral LNs and damaged tissues. CD2AP is an intracellular protein that regulates actin dynamics and promotes pDC migration to LNs under inflammatory settings. CCR2 drives the recruitment of pDCs to the skin following inflammation induced by the TLR7 agonist, Imiquimod. CCR6 and CCR10 are expressed by a subset of human tonsil pDCs and enable migration to inflamed epithelia producing CCL20 and CCL27 (not shown). CCR9 and its ligand CCL25 (not shown) promote trafficking of peripheral pDCs to the thymus and are required for pDC recruitment to the small intestine under both normal and inflammatory conditions. MAdCAM-1, \u03b27 integrin and CD103 also influence pDC trafficking to the gut. Finally, pDCs express CX3CR1 (not shown), which may impact their homeostasis. pDCs sense DNA viruses, synthetic CpG oligodeoxyribonucleotides (ODN) and endogenous DNA through TLR9. All TLR9 signaling requires MyD88 but additional factors determine whether TLR9 engagement will result in type I IFN (IFN-I) or pro-inflammatory cytokine production. These factors include mode of ligand entry, and the intracellular compartment where TLR9 encounters its ligand. TLR9 is transported to appropriate intracellular compartments by UNC93B 249, 250 and requires cleavage in order to recruit MyD88 251, 252 . DNA viruses, CpG ODN and small DNA immunecomplexes (DNA-ICs) enter pDCs through endocytosis and meet TLR9 in the early endosome. In contrast, large DNA-ICs are internalized by phagocytosis and encounter TLR9 and UNC93B in the early phagosome. If AP3 or LC3 are recruited then the IRF7 endosome or IRF7 phagosome is formed which leads to IFN-I production. Several molecules/pathways are involved in this process including IKK\u03b1, osteopontin (OPN), SLC15A4, BTK, BLOC1, BLOC2, DOCK2, PACSIN1, PLSCR1, VIPERIN, SCARB2 and the mTOR pathway. Alternatively, TLR9containing compartments can form NF-\u03baB endosomes or NF-\u03baB phagosomes resulting in the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines (i.e. IL-6, IL-12, TNF-\u03b1, etc). This process requires IRF5, BTK and SLC15A4. CpG ODN have different structures which results in trafficking to different compartments: CpG-A is transported to the IRF7 endosome and is a strong inducer of IFN-I, while CpG-B aggregates in the NF-\u03baB endosome and is a potent stimulator of maturation and cytokine/chemokine production. CpG-C exhibits properties of both CpG-A and CpG-B in that it can induce both IFN-I and pro-inflammatory cytokines. TLR7 stimulation by viral and endogenous RNA may follow similar pathways.",

The impact of pDCs also depends on the route of infection. pDCs provide an important source of type I IFN in systemic infections, when the virus reaches the circulation. In contrast, the requirement for pDCs in type I IFN-mediated antiviral defense during local viral infections appears to be necessary only if other lines of defense are broken. For example, in pulmonary infection with Newcastle disease virus (NDV), alveolar macrophages are the primary source of type I IFN; if they are eliminated then pDC-derived type I IFN becomes important",

            "text": "Diverse functions of pDCspDCs are a prominent link between innate and adaptive immune responses. Their ability to rapidly produce type I IFNs (IFN-Is) during viral infections promotes an antiviral state by inducing expression of interferon stimulated genes and apoptosis of infected cells. Moreover, IFN-I, IL-12 and IL-18 enhance NK cell activation and effector functions such as IFN-\u03b3 secretion and lysis of target cells. Expression of MHC class I (MHCI) and MHC class II (MHCII) along with costimulatory markers including CD80, CD86 and CD40 enable pDCs to cross prime CD8 + T cells and present Ag to CD4 + T cells. Production of IFN-I and IL-12 by pDCs supports accumulation and effector functions of CD8 + T cells as well as the polarization of CD4 + T cells into T helper 1 cells (Th1). pDC expression of IDO and ICOSL or production of TGF-\u03b2 and IL-6 promotes T Reg or Th17 commitment, respectively. Crosstalk between pDCs and invariant NKT (iNKT) cells occurs via OX40/OX40L and PD-1/PD-L1 interactions and dampens antiviral adaptive immune responses. pDCs impact B cell activation, plasma cell generation and antibody secretion through production of IFN-I, IL-6, BAFF and APRIL. TRAIL and Granzyme B (GrB) serve as immunoregulatory factors that endow pDCs with the capacity to kill tumor cells, induce apoptosis of infected CD4 + T cells and suppress T cell proliferation. Finally, pDCs secrete chemokines such CXCL8, CXCL10, CCL3 and CCL4, which attract immune cells to sites of infection or inflammation.",

Nucleic acids of mammalian origin can act as endogenous ligands for Toll-like receptors and may promote systemic lupus erythematosus. J Exp Med. 2005; 202:1131-1139. [PubMed: 16230478] Marco Colonna obtained his MD degree from Parma University, Italy, and completed postdoctoral training at Roswell Park Memorial Institute and Harvard University. He established an independent laboratory at the Basel Institute for Immunology in 1994 and became Professor of Pathology and Immunology at the Washington University in St. Louis in 2001.He focuses on innate immunoreceptors, a field in which his accomplishments encompass identification of the KIR receptors and HLA-C polymorphisms as their inhibitory ligands, as well as the LILR and TREM receptors.
