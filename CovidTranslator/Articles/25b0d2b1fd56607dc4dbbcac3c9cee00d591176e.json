            "text": "RNA interference (RNAi), a conserved mechanism triggered by small interfering RNA (siRNA), has been used for suppressing gene expression through RNA degradation. The replication of caliciviruses (CVs) with RNAi was studied using the Tulane virus (TV) as a model. Five siRNAs targeting the non-structural, the major (VP1) and minor (VP2) structural genes of the TV were developed and the viruses were quantified using qPCR and TCID 50 assay. Treatment of the cells with siRNA 4 hours before viral inoculation significantly reduced viral titer by up to 2.6 logs and dramatically decreased viral RNA copy numbers and viral titers 48 hours post infection in four of the five siRNAs studied. The results were confirmed by Western blot, in which the major structural protein VP1 was markedly reduced in both the cells and the culture medium. Two small protein bands of the S and P domains of the viral capsid protein were also detected in the cell lysates, although their role in viral replication remains unknown. Since the TV shares many biological properties with human noroviruses (NoVs), the successful demonstration of RNAi in TV replication would provide valuable information in control of acute gastroenteritis caused by human NoVs.",

NoVs are a leading cause of epidemics of nonbacterial acute gastroenteritis, affecting millions of people worldwide. The viruses are spread by fecal-oral pathways, through person-to-person contact, or by contaminations of environmental surfaces, water or food. They are highly contagious which usually result in large outbreaks in crowded communities or institutions such as schools, restaurants, hospitals, child care centers, nursing homes for the elderly, cruise-ships, and military settings. According to a recent estimation, NoVs cause 64,000 episodes of diarrhea requiring hospitalization and 900,000 clinic visits among children in industrialized countries, and 1,000,000 inpatient hospitalizations and 200,000 deaths of children under the age of five in developing countries (Patel et al. 2008) . NoVs are also the leading cause of foodborne illnesses and attributable to ~ 21 million cases in the United States annually (Hall et al. 2011) .",

Recently a cultivable monkey enteric calicivirus, the Tulane virus (TV) has been isolated, which could be a useful surrogate for human NoVs. TV is genetically more closely related to NoVs than to any other calicivirus genera . TV also recognizes the histo-blood group antigens (HBGAs) like human NoVs (Farkas et al. 2010) . The complete genome of TV is organized into three open reading frames (ORFs) similar to that of NoVs . ORF1 is composed of two-thirds of the genome, encoding the non-structural (NS) polyprotein, which is autocleaved to at least six functional units, including the N-terminal protein, NTPase, a small protein with yet unknown function, VPg, viral protease, and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) . Both NTPase and RdRp play an essential role in viral RNA replication (Tao and Ye 2010) . ORF2 encodes the major structural protein VP1, while ORF3 encodes a minor structural protein VP2 (Hardy 2005) .",

The current results showed that siRNAs targeting either the non-structural or the structural genes of the TV genome were highly effective in reduction of TV replication in the LLC-MK2 cells. Effective inhibition of calicivirus replication by antisense RNA was also observed for the feline CV (Stein et al. 2001 ) and the murine norovirus (MNV) (Bok et al. 2008) . The antiviral effects have been determined by qRT-PCR and TCID 50 and confirmed by Western blot analyses. One dose of siRNA delivered four hours before viral inoculation was highly effective for controlling TV replication for at least 48 hpi, with up to 2.6 logs of TCID 50 reduction by the most effective siRNA targeting to the viral NTPase gene.",

For example, two siRNA duplexes targeting the viral non-structural proteins, NTPase and RdRp, respectively, had very potent inhibition effect on TV replication. Although the function of NTPase remains unclear for TV, studies on the flavivirus have shown that functional inhibition of the NTPase may occur by competition or blockade of the NTP binding site, by conformational changes through immobilization of the switch region, by competitive inhibition of RNA binding, or by inhibition of unwinding via steric blockade of translocation of the NTPase along the template RNA (Borowski et al. 2002b , Borowski et al. 2002a ). The RdRp is involved in the synthesis of genomic and subgenomic RNA that is essential for calicivirus replication. Thus the selection of siRNA targeting the non-structural genes may be a choice of targets for highly efficient RNAi against CVs.",

However, the success of antiviral effect by the second siRNA targeting at a different region of the VP1 gene as well as by the siRNA targeting the VP2 gene suggested that the viral structural genes could also be a good target for RNAi against calicivirus, although a different finding by others was reported (Zheng et al. 2004) . The relative less efficiency of the structural siRNA in comparison with the nonstructural siRNA could be due to a potential high copy number of the structural genes than the non-structural genes, in which the structural genes were encoded in both genomic and subgenomic RNAs (Hardy 2005) .",

In general, a single dose of siRNA at four hours before viral inoculation was found to be sufficient for preventing TV replication for at least 48 hours. This result is consistent with the fact that no clear additive effect by additional dose of the same siRNA in a later time within the 48 hour period was necessary in our multiple dose treatment experiments (data not shown). However, slight increase of efficiency using a combination of more than one siRNA in compared with one single siRNA in a single dose treatment was indeed observed. The combination of both siRNAs targeting the non-structural genes (NTPase and RdRp, with half dosage for each) seemed more effective than a combination of siRNA targeting structural and non-structural genes (data not shown). While one dose seemed to control TV infection sufficiently for 48 hours, future study on extended course of disease may be necessary, because the illness of NoVs gastroenteritis usually lasts for 3-5 days and even longer for viral shedding (up to 4 weeks). This may require an alternative model, because almost all cells in siControl were infected (round and detached), which might no longer be susceptible to TV.",

The finding of both proteins inside cells but not in the culture medium supernatant indicated that neither of these protein fragments were part of the mature virions. Suggested function of P protein included involvement of host receptor recognition and immune regulation (Tan et al. 2004a , Tan et al. 2004b , Chen et al. 2006 , Tan et al. 2008 ). On the other hand, we still cannot exclude the possibility that these two protein fragments were random degradation products, particularly the molecular weight of the S protein seen on the Western blotting analysis was bigger than what was expected (~ 22 kDa) based on the predicted hinge region in the TV genome. The previous studies of detection of the P protein in stools used serum samples from NoVs infected patients (Greenberg et al. 1981 , Graham et al. 1994 which might not be able to detect the S domain protein.
