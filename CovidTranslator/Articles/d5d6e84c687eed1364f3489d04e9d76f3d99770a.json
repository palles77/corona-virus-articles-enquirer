            "text": "A population of Persian cats experienced an epidemic of feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) over 2 years. Twelve cases of FIP occurred in litters born during this period. Cats contracting FIP were all genetically related through the sire. Feline coronavirus (FCoV) genomic RNA was detected consistently in this study in biologic samples from adult cats, kittens suffering from FIP, and their siblings. Analysis of viral 7a/7b open reading frame (ORFs) were analyzed and revealed two distinct virus variants circulating in the population, one with an intact 7a ORF and one with two major deletions in the 7a ORF. The 7b ORFs were intact and similar among all virus isolates, although point mutations resulting in amino acid changes were present. The sire was determined to be infected with both variants, and was persistently virus-infected. We speculate the deletion variant arose from the non-deletion variant during viral replication in this population, possibly in the sire. #",

            "text": "Feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) is a serious disease of domestic and wild Felidae. It is an important disease of cats in multi-cat households, catteries, and shelters (Scott et al., 1992; Wolf, 1995) . This disease can manifest as an effusive peritonitis and/or pleuritis with a short course ending in death; or it may present as a more insidious disease with Veterinary Microbiology 81 (2001) [227] [228] [229] [230] [231] [232] [233] [234] granulomatous lesions affecting multiple organs that also progresses to death (Pedersen, 1987; Hoskins, 1993; Pedersen, 1995) . The etiologic agent of FIP is feline coronavirus (FCoV) . In environments where large numbers of cats are housed closely together, 75-100% of the animals may be seropositive to the virus (Pedersen, 1995) . Despite these numbers, FIP occurs sporadically -fatal disease is an uncommon manifestation of infection with FCoV. Virus factors are important to disease development, as virus strains vary in virulence (Pedersen, 1987) . Virulent FCoV is theorized to arise from mutation of the infecting FCoV during replication in the intestinal tract of infected cats (Poland et al., 1996; Vennema et al., 1998) . The 7b open reading frame (ORF), the 3 0 -most gene, has been speculated to have a role in virulence, as deletions in this region lead to decreased virulence (Vennema et al., 1992; Herrewegh et al., 1995; Vennema et al., 1998) . Despite this data, the specific virus and host factors involved in the production of lethal disease are not known.",

During the last 6 months of the FIP outbreak, a new sire was used and bred to the original sire's daughters. Morbidity and mortality has since decreased to 0-25% within litters (n \u00bc 4), with the last case occurring in spring of 1999. Amplification of FCoV 7a/7b ORF from the most recent cases of FIP (n \u00bc 4) have not been successful.

One variant had an intact 7a/7b ORF, while another had two major deletions in the 7a ORF. The latter group appears to be very closely related, and probably arose from a single mutant strain. The first deletion resulted in no change in the reading frame, but the second deletion led to an alteration of the reading frame by one nucleotide leading to an altered amino acid sequence in the predicted protein. We speculate that these deletions arose from ''looping out'' of RNA regions due to the predicted secondary structure of the single stranded RNA genome in this region (data not shown).

Thus, it is unclear if this start codon is present. If it is, translation of the 7a ORF in the deletion mutant would result in a predicted protein that is nearly half the size of the native protein (58 amino acids in deletion mutant versus 108 amino acids residues in the native virus).",

Other cats in this study may have also been dually infected with both virus variants, however, only one virus variant was identified by PCR in each of the remaining cats tested. This may be due to a quantitative difference in the amount of each virus variant in each cat tested. Both variants were circulating as every cat tested was infected with one of the virus variants. Some infected with the intact 7a/7b ORF variant were ill and some infected with the deletion mutant were ill. However, as both variants were circulating and thus, every cat was exposed to both variants, there may be a causal relationship between the mutation that occurred and the increased incidence of disease seen in this population. The variation in disease may be related to host factors, such as generation of an effective immune response, rather than solely to the virus itself. Alternatively, mutations in other genomic regions may be responsible for the variation in virulence observed with these isolates. Host factors may play an important role in the virulence of FCoV. Increased incidence of FIP in purebred cats, as well as in cheetahs, which are relatively genetically homologous, is known to occur (O'Brien et al., 1985; Foley and Pedersen, 1996) . In this investigation, all of the FIP victims were genetically related through the sire. Those related to him through both the queen and sire had the highest morbidity while those related to him through the queen or sire only had lower morbidity. This would support the belief that susceptibility to FIP following infection with FCoV has a host genetic component.",
