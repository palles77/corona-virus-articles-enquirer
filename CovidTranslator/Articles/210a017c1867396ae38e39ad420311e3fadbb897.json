            "text": "Human parainfluenza virus type 2 (HPIV2) is an enveloped, single-stranded, non-segmented, negative-sense RNA virus of the Rubulavirus genus in the Paramyxoviridae family [1] . Similar to respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza virus, HPIV1 and HPIV3, HPIV2 is an important cause of severe lower respiratory tract disease, including croup, bronchiolitis and pneumonia, in children less than 6 years old. HPIVs account for up to 18% of all pediatric hospitalizations for respiratory tract diseases, with HPIV2 alone estimated to be responsible for approximately 3% [2, 3] . In addition, HPIV2 causes significant morbidity in infants and children that requires medical attention but not hospitalization [2, 4] . Licensed vaccines are currently not available for any HPIV, despite their significant impact on public health.",

The live attenuated vaccine strategy offers several advantages over inactivated or subunit formulations, including the ability to elicit broadly protective immune responses consisting of local and serum antibodies as well as CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses [5] . Furthermore, live attenuated vaccines administered intranasally replicate in the respiratory tract in the presence of maternal antibody, permitting immunization of young infants, and cause an acute, self-limited infection that is readily eliminated from the respiratory tract [5, 6] . Finally, intranasal administration of live attenuated virus vaccines induces mucosal antigen-specific immune responses in the upper respiratory tract (URT), which have a major impact on limiting replication of respiratory viruses in the airways [7, 8] . Several cDNA derived, intranasally administered live attenuated virus vaccines have been evaluated in clinical trials and were found to be safe and immunogenic, including the licensed influenza virus vaccine (FluMist \u00ae ) and investigational vaccines against HPIV3 (rHPIV3cp45) and RSV (rA2cp248/404/1030 SH) [6, [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] .",

Extensive in vivo studies are often performed during preclinical vaccine development since cell lines generally do not accurately reveal the level of attenuation of viral vaccine candidates for the respiratory tract of humans. Furthermore, the restricted host range of human paramyxoviruses requires the use of non-human primates, a limited and expensive resource, to assess the level of attenuation. Therefore, the availability of an in vitro tissue culture model system that reflects the restriction of replication of attenuated human respiratory viruses in non-human primates and ultimately humans would be desirable for preclinical development of such live attenuated virus vaccines. Using an in vitro system, the level of attenuation of multiple vaccine candidates could be rapidly assessed and suitable vaccine candidates could be selected for further evaluation in non-human primates and in humans.",

In vitro models of human ciliated airway epithelium (HAE) derived from freshly isolated human airway cells and grown at an air-liquid interface have been shown to closely mimic the morphological and physiological characteristics of the human airway epithelium in vivo, including mucociliary transport [18, 19] . Furthermore, such HAE models have been used to investigate characteristics of viral infection for a number of respiratory viruses, including human coronaviruses, influenza A viruses, RSV, HPIV1 and HPIV3 [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] . Although each of these viruses infects ciliated cells in this model, the consequences of infection vary. For example, infection by influenza A viruses causes extensive early cytopathology in HAE [24, 26] , whereas RSV, HPIV1 and HPIV3 do not cause overt early cytopathology [20] [21] [22] . The ciliated cell tropism of these viruses and the critical role of ciliated cells in innate airway defense suggest a central role for ciliated cells in virus replication and spread with likely adverse consequences for the function of the epithelium of the respiratory tract [20] [21] [22] .",

We have chosen to test the utility of HAE to estimate the level of attenuation of a live attenuated cDNA derived HPIV2 vaccine candidate designated here as rHPIV2-VAC. This vaccine candidate has been administered to the upper and lower respiratory tract of African green monkeys (AGMs) and is currently in phase 1 clinical trials. rHPIV2-VAC was designed to contain three attenuating elements: a T to C substitution at nucleotide 15 in the 3 genomic promoter (15 T-C ); a substitution in the viral polymerase (L Y948L ); and a deletion in the polymerase (L del1724 ) [27] [28] [29] . The 15 T-C mutation was originally identified as a spontaneous mutation following in vitro passage of wild-type (WT) HPIV2 in LLC-MK2 cells. This mutation is nontemperature sensitive (non-ts) and efficiently attenuates the virus in both the upper (URT) and lower (LRT) respiratory tract of AGMs as well as in the LRT of hamsters [29] . The L Y948L mutation was originally identified as a ts attenuating mutation in the L polymerase of the HPIV3cp45 vaccine candidate [30] . The stability of the mutant HPIV2 L Y948L sequence was enhanced by genetically engineering a codon assignment that would require three nucleotide changes to revert to the original, wild-type tyrosine amino acid assignment [27] . This substitution mutation in HPIV2 resulted in ts and att phenotypes with restriction of replication observed in the LRT of AGMs and hamsters [27, 29] . Lastly, deletion of codons 1724 and 1725 in L of HPIV2 (L del1724 ) increased the level of temperature sensitivity and attenuation of rHPIV2 bearing the 15 T-C and L Y948L mutations and should confer a more stable attenuation phenotype than the point mutation from which it was derived (a L S1724I att point mutation in bovine PIV3) [27, 30] . The rHPIV2-VAC vaccine candidate virus, containing the above mutations, was found to be ts in vitro, with a replication shut-off temperature of 37 \u2022 C, and manifested restricted replication in the URT and LRT of AGMs [29] . The mean peak titer of rHPIV2-VAC was reduced 60-fold in the URT and 4000-fold in the LRT of infected AGMs compared to that of rHPIV2-WT [29] . rHPIV2-VAC induced a moderate rise in HPIV2 hemagglutination-inhibiting (HAI) antibodies in AGMs and immunization protected AGMs against wild-type HPIV2 challenge in both the UTR and LRT [29] .",

Our data demonstrate that HPIV2 infects ciliated cells only, that virus is released from the apical surface only, and that productive replication takes place in the absence of early gross morphological changes to the epithelium. Efficient replication of rHPIV2-WT in HAE allowed us to compare the level of restriction of replication of rHPIV2-VAC in HAE to that previously observed in AGMs. The restriction of replication of rHPIV2-VAC versus rHPIV2-WT in HAE at 32 and 37 \u2022 C correlated closely with that seen in the URT and LRT, respectively, of AGMs. Ongoing clinical trials will provide the vaccine virus replication data in seronegative children that is needed to assess the utility of the HAE system in identifying live HPIV2 vaccine viruses that are appropriately attenuated.",

Quantification of virus in the apical compartment provided evidence of rapid and robust replication and apical shedding of progeny rHPIV2-WT in HAE. Titers of rHPIV2-WT increased 100fold within the first 24 h following apical inoculation and reached a peak titer of approximately 10 6 TCID 50 /ml in the apical wash samples by day 2 post-inoculation (pi) (Fig. 1A) , indicating rHPIV2-WT was able to productively infect HAE.

By day 1 pi, viral antigen was detected in cells dispersed across the surface of HAE. However, despite high MOI inoculation, on average, only 8-10% of the surface epithelial cells were positive for viral antigen, indicating that only a minority of HAE cells were infected by the initial inoculum. Since rHPIV2-WT appears to infect primarily ciliated cells in the HAE (Fig. 4A) and 60-80% of the cells in a given HAE culture are of the ciliated cell type [38] , we estimate that only 10-20% of all ciliated cells in each culture were infected during inoculation. Infection of HAE with rHPIV2-WT produced maximum titers days 1-3 pi, which was demonstrated both by high levels of virus detected in the apical compartment and by the proportion of cells positive for HPIV2 antigen at those time points. The numbers of infected cells declined after day 3 and reached 50% of its peak by day 6 pi (Fig. 1C) . The decline in the number of infected cells correlated with a reduction in viral titer determined at day 6 pi. Still, significant numbers of cells stained positive for HPIV2 through day 6 pi, and viral shedding was detectable in the apical compartment through the final day of sampling.",

Following basolateral inoculation of HAE with rHPIV2-WT at a MOI of 5.0 TCID 50 /cell, virus could be detected in the apical compartment at titers ranging from 10 3.2 to 10 5.2 TCID 50 /ml by day 2 pi. To confirm that HPIV2 was indeed able to infect HAE following basolateral exposure, we repeated this experiment at a lower MOI of rHPIV2-WT (1.0 TCID 50 /cell). Again, rHPIV2-WT was observed to infect the HAE both apically and basolaterally as evidenced by detection of increasing virus titers in the apical wash samples ( Fig. 2A) . However, as virus titers in the basolateral compartment did not increase over the course of infection, HPIV2 appears to be shed primarily from the apical surface regardless of inoculation route ( Fig. 2A) . Additional cultures were inoculated (either apically or basolaterally) in parallel with rHPIV1-WT for comparison with rHPIV2-WT. Upon apical inoculation with rHPIV1-WT, robust HPIV1 shedding from the apical surface was detected, indicating productive infection of the HAE (Fig. 2A) . As was previously reported [20] , virus shedding into the basolateral compartment was not observed. Following basolateral inoculation with rHPIV1-WT, virus was detected at early time points (days 0-4 pi) in the basolateral wash samples, but the declining titer of virus during this period suggests that the virus detected represents residual inoculum and is not evidence of replication within the HAE. In contrast to our results for rHPIV2-WT, rHPIV1-WT virus shedding was not detected in the apical compartment of basolaterally infected HAE. Therefore, rHPIV1-WT infects the HAE after apical but not basolateral inoculation. The observation that rHPIV2-WT infected all cultures derived from four different donors via the basolateral surface, in contrast to HPIV1, which was not able to infect any of the cultures after basolateral inoculation, indicated that HPIV2 was capable of entering the HAE via apical and basolateral surfaces. En face immunostaining for HPIV2 and HPIV1 antigens verified that cells of the HAE were infected via both apical and basolateral inoculation with HPIV2 but not via basolateral inoculation with HPIV1 (Fig. 2B) .",

The moderate restriction of replication of rHPIV2-VAC in LLC-MK2 cells at 37 \u2022 C is compatible with the presence of ts att mutations in the vaccine virus [29] .

It was previously demonstrated that infection of HAE with rHPIV1-WT did not induce significant levels of type I interferon (IFN) secretion, while infection with a HPIV1 mutant encoding a defective HPIV1 IFN antagonist C protein induced high levels of IFN [20] . In these previous studies the induction of IFN correlated with the restriction of replication of the HPIV1 mutant in the HAE model. In the present study, we compared the concentration of type I IFN in the apical compartment following infection with rHPIV2-WT or rHPIV2-VAC to determine whether IFN played a role in the restriction of replication of either virus. Type I IFN was not (rHPIV2-VAC) or barely (rHPIV2-WT, 35 pg/ml IFN detected on day 4 only at 37 \u2022 C, lower limit of detection = 30 pg/ml) detectable in the apical compartment of cultures maintained at either 32 or 37 \u2022 C during the 6 days of study. This observation implies that a strong inhibition of IFN induction is operative in both WT and mutant HPIV2, supporting data from cell lines infected by HPIV2 [39] [40] [41] [42] [43] [44] [45] [46] [47] [48] . These findings indicate that the attenuation of rHPIV2-VAC for HAE is mediated by mutations that do not directly involve IFN production and that the restricted replication of rHPIV2-VAC specified by the attenuated mutations might contribute to the weak IFN response.",

Sections of HAE fixed on the final day of sampling (day 6) showed that neither rHPIV2-WT nor rHPIV2-VAC infection was associated with overt cytotoxicity or syncytia formation. In addition, mucociliary function determined by visual inspection of ciliary motion in infected HAE using a light microscope at each time point did not appear to be significantly compromised by HPIV2 infection.

The restriction of rHPIV2-VAC replication in HAE at 32 \u2022 C was not observed in the non-polarized LLC-MK2 cell line, where its replication was equivalent to that of rHPIV2-WT at permissive temperature. Thus, rHPIV2-VAC contains a host range attenuating mutation that specifies attenuation (i.e., restricted replication) in AGMs and HAE (32 \u2022 C) but not in LLC-MK2 cells. We suggest that the restriction in replication of rHPIV2-VAC at the permissive temperature of 32 \u2022 C in HAE is due to the 15 T-C mutation in the 3 genomic promoter, which was shown previously to be a non-ts mutation that specifies attenuation in both the URT and LRT of AGMs [29] . In both HAE at 37 \u2022 C and the LRT of AGMs, rHPIV2-VAC replication was highly attenuated (approximately 10,000-fold lower titers than rHPIV2-WT) likely due to the additive effects of the non-ts and ts attenuating mutations [29] . The correlation between the extent of vaccine attenuation in HAE and AGMs further strengthens the concept that HAE models are useful for determining the attenuation phenotypes of potential respiratory virus vaccine candidates. Other recent data with a V-deletion mutant of HPIV2, rHPIV2-V ko , also showed that attenuation of HPIV2 in vivo may be reflected in HAE, as this mutant was unable to grow to detectable levels in either HAE or AGMs [52] . However, clear demonstration of a quantitative correlation between attenuation in vivo and in HAE will require more extensive testing of a panel of viruses with varying levels of attenuation in both systems. Once the safety, level of replication, and immunogenicity of rHPIV2-VAC is determined in seronegative children, the level of sensitivity of both the AGM and HAE models in identifying a satisfactory level of attenuation of rHPIV2-VAC for humans will be known. If the rHPIV2-VAC is under-attenuated for seronegative infants, viruses that are more attenuated than rHPIV2-VAC in comparative studies in HAE and/or AGMs will be selected for further evaluation in humans.",

Although HPIV2 infection of HAE was less robust than that of HPIV1 and HPIV3 [20, 21] , HAE clearly supported HPIV2 replication with amplification of virus titer and can therefore be used to model characteristics of HPIV2 infection of the human respiratory tract in vivo.

In addition to its restricted replication, we observed a decline in virus titers from day 3 onward, indicating that, even in the absence of immune cells and a humoral immune response, virus replication is restricted by the innate epithelial immune system. Initially, we suspected that this decrease in virus shedding might be due to the production of cytokines and other immune mediators by the epithelial cells that suppress virus growth. Previous studies with HPIV1 mutants possessing mutations that disable the viral IFN antagonist genes indicated that type I IFN secreted by HAE cells was capable of reducing replication of viruses that were rendered susceptible to the antiviral effects of IFN [20] . However, our evaluation of the type I IFN response showed no link between IFN production in HAE and the reduction of HPIV2 replication, though this does not rule out a contribution of other innate epithelial cell responses to limiting virus replication. This was not surprising since rHPIV2-VAC does not posses mutations in the V protein, the known IFN antagonist gene of HPIV2. Rather, the failure to detect IFN in the cultures of rHPIV2-VAC infected cells reflects the restricted replication of this virus imposed by the mutations in L and the 3 genomic promoter. Future studies in HAE will likely further our understanding of both the innate immune responses of airway epithelial cells that limit the extent and duration of respiratory virus infection and the mechanisms by which host range mutations, such as the 15 T-C mutation, restrict replication in human ciliated epithelial cells.",

For example, influenza virus infection results in dramatic cytopathic effects in the columnar cells of HAE cultures within 48 h, with early cessation of cilial beat and eventual loss of columnar epithelial cells, although basal epithelial cells are spared [24, 26] . In contrast, cytopathology induced in HAE by HPIV1, HPIV3, and RSV infections is much more subtle than that induced by influenza viruses [21, 22] . Similarly, infection of HAE with HPIV2 did not induce syncytia formation or disruption of overall mucociliary function, and epithelial integrity was not dramatically altered compared to uninfected cultures from the same donor. However, these observations may be due partly to the low number of cells infected in each culture as cytotoxicity assays detected some alterations in the HAE that were not observed in histological analyses. This cytotoxicity could be due either to the death of infected cells by cytopathic effect of viral infection or by cellular apoptotic mechanisms. In contrast to rHPIV2-WT, rHPIV2-VAC exhibited minimal cytotoxicity determined by AK release, corresponding to lower levels of replication.",

Because HPIV vaccines are being developed for intranasal inoculation, vaccine strains must be able to productively infect apical, or luminal, cell surfaces for intranasal administration. Our studies confirmed that inoculation of the apical surface of HAE is a productive route of infection for rHPIV2-VAC, which supports intranasal inoculation as a means of vaccination. Interestingly, HPIV2 also appears to be able to enter the HAE via the basolateral surface. Other paramyxoviruses, such as measles virus (genus Morbillivirus), can also enter HAE via the basolateral surface yet, like HPIV2, measles virus is released primarily apically [25, 54, 55] . Whether the ability of HPIV2 to infect HAE after basolateral inoculation is of biological significance is unknown as no indication of HPIV2 viremia has been reported and signs of systemic illness (other than fever) are not seen in immunocompetent individuals [56] .",

In vivo, this would result in shedding into the lumen and away from underlying tissues, increasing the likelihood that infection will remain localized to epithelial surfaces in the respiratory tract. Although apical budding is not the only mechanism that restricts systemic spread of a virus, a similar restriction of virus release to apical surfaces has also been seen previously with the related parainfluenza viruses HPIV1 and HPIV3, as well as RSV and influenza A virus, and is consistent with the pattern of infection limited to the respiratory tract that is typically seen throughout the course of disease during human infection with HPIV2 [20] [21] [22] 24] . Clinical data also indicate that WT HPIV2 is shed lumenally and present in respiratory secretions whereas viremia or replication at distant sites has not been reported [57] . Similarly, HPIV2 viremia was not detectable in spite of high titer replication in the URT and LRT of AGM (unpublished data, ASN, ACS, and BRM). The observation that rHPIV2-VAC is released from the apical surface is important for vaccine development because it will unlikely cause viremia or spread to systemic organs in vaccines.",

This study extended analysis of rHPIV2-VAC to a human in vitro model system that is likely predictive of HPIV replication in the airways of seronegative children and demonstrated a consistent, high level of attenuation for rHPIV2-VAC in human ciliated epithelial cells at 37 \u2022 C, indicating that it is very unlikely to cause severe lower respiratory disease in seronegative children. The close correlation between limited growth of rHPIV2-VAC versus that of rHPIV2-WT in both AGMs and in HAE provides additional evidence that this virus will be attenuated in humans. Since rHPIV2-VAC is currently being evaluated in clinical trials as a live attenuated vaccine candidate for HPIV2, it will be valuable to compare data generated in HAE models to levels of replication in seronegative humans in order to fully assess the correlation between the level of attenuation of a vaccine candidate in the HAE model versus that in humans. If the clinical trials indicate that additional HPIV2 vaccine candidates need to be developed, HAE and rHPIV2-VAC can be used together to assess which candidates have favorable attenuation profiles for clinical development.",
