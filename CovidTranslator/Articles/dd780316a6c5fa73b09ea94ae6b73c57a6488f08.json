Following the identification of the first infections, on February 21, 2020, national authorities have put in place an increasing number of restrictions aimed at containing the outbreak and delaying the epidemic peak. Since March 9, the whole country is under lockdown. Here we provide the first quantitative assessment of the impact of such measures on the mobility and the social mixing of Italians, through the analysis of a large-scale dataset on de-identified, geolocated smartphone users. With respect to pre-outbreak averages, we estimate a reduction of 50% of the total trips between Italian provinces, following the lockdown. In the same week, the average users' radius of gyration has declined by about 50% and the average degree of the users' proximity network has dropped by 17% at national level.",

Nevertheless, with an estimated 60% undetected cases (10, 11, 12) the novel coronavirus is currently circulating uncontrolled worldwide. Recent results suggest that a large fraction of infectious individuals are asymptomatic (13) , dramatically shrinking the window of opportunity to contain local sporadic outbreaks by stopping chains of infection (14) . Therefore, several European countries are now enacting non-pharmaceutical interventions aimed at slowing and mitigating the epidemic to \"flatten the curve\" and avoid the collapse of their entire healthcare system due to severe cases requiring hospitalization and extended stay in intensive care units (15, 14, 16, 17) .",

Almost every day from February 25 to March 9, new and stricter policies have been declared in an increasing number of Italian provinces (see the Supplementary Material for a brief timeline).

This first-party data is collected from users who have opted-in to provide access to their location data anonymously, through a GDPR-compliant framework. Location is collected anonymously from opted-in users through a Software Development Kit (SDK) included in partner apps. At the device level, the operating system (iOS or Android) combines various location data sources (e.g., GPS, mobile network, WiFi networks, beacons) and provides geographical coordi-nates with an estimated accuracy level. Location accuracy depends on many factors and is variable in time, but it can be as accurate as 10 meters. Temporal sampling of anonymized users' locations is also variable and depends on the operating system of the device and on user behavioral patterns, but it is generally high-frequency. We remove short-time dynamics by aggregating the data over 5minute windows. The basic unit of information we process is an event of the form (anonymous hashed user id, time, latitude, longitude), which we call a user's stop in the remainder, plus additional non-personal metadata and location accuracy. We perform all our analyses on a panel of about 167,000 users who were active during the first week of the outbreak (February 22-28, 2020), i.e for whom there was at least one location collected during that week. This led to about 175 million data points over the 8 weeks of this study.",

We average different mobility and proximity metrics during the pre-outbreak period (between January 18 and February 21, 2020) and observe their weekly and daily evolution as the intervention policies are enforced. To measure mobility networks, We create origin-destination (OD) matrices by measuring the number users who have traveled between any two Italian provinces over a given day, or a given week. A trip between two provinces i and j is recorded whenever a user makes two consecutive stops in i and j with more than 1 hour difference between the two. To characterize individual mobility patterns, we use the radius of gyration r g (19) to quantify the mobility range of an individual during a given week. To measure social mixing, for every province we define a proximity network where nodes are individuals, and two individuals are connected by an edge if they made at least one stop within a distance d = 100 m from one other, within the same hour of the day. We then compute the average degree of such hourly proximity network, and average that over all the 1-hour slices of a given day, yielding a daily average degree k for every province. We use the daily time series of k to study how the mixing patterns defined above change as a consequence of mobility restrictions.",

On the other hand, provinces in Central and Southern Italy exhibit a less marked reduction of mobility, consistent with the initial interventions focusing on the North of the country (Fig. 1A) . During the same week we observe that for some provinces of the North, such as the Aosta Valley which is an important skiing resort area, the incoming volume of users slightly increased (+13%), suggesting that a non negligible fraction of users was still moving for recreational reasons at the time, or moving for self-quarantine outside of the major urban areas.",

Specifically, we measure the individual weekly radius of gyration, r g , for each user and we compute distributions of its values over all users who are resident in a given province. The home province of a user is defined as the province where the majority of a user's stops were recorded at night (8 PM -8 AM) as in Ref. (20) over the 5 weeks before February 21, 2020. By analysing variations in the weekly radius of gyration, we find a significant reduction in the characteristic distance traveled by individuals, starting on February 22, right after the initial COVID-19 outbreak was identified in Lodi. In Fig. 3 , we report the median weekly radius of gyration,r g , in the Italian provinces, comparing the value ofr g measured before the outbreak and during the outbreak. Even though mobility restrictions were enforced only in Lombardy and neighbouring regions, we observe thatr g has decreased in all provinces of Italy since the very beginning of the outbreak. Initially, as expected, we observe the largest percent decrease in the provinces of Lodi (LO), Imola (IM), Cremona (CR), at the center of the outbreak (Fig. 3A) . However, significant reductions are observed in some Southern provinces, like Taranto (TA) or Messina (ME), as well. As more restrictions were put in place, the average radius of gyration by province has further declined across the country, with an average 49% reduction in Week 3, from 13 km to 7 km, at national level. In Week 3, half of the users' population typically travelled less than 2 km, while before the outbreak half of the population was traveling more than 5.7 km a week (see Fig. S3 ). In particular, we observe the largest relative reduction ofr g (from 6.1 km to 1.3 km) in the province of Milan (MI) which did not appear among the top 20 provinces in the precedent weeks (Fig. 3C ).",

We evaluated the effect of NPIs on the social mixing of our users' sample, by defining a proxy of the potential encounters each user could have in one hour. To this aim, we built a proximity network among users based on the locations they visited and the hour of the day when these visits occurred. To create such a network, we assert proximity between any two users in the same province who were seen within a circle of radius R = 50 m in a 1-hour period. The procedure to build the proximity network is described in Fig. 4A . If two users have been in proximity several times in a day, this still counts as only one link in the network. To measure variations in the network structure over time, we look at the average degree of the network defined as k = 2E/N , where E is the number of links and N is the number of nodes of the network. It is important to remark that this is not a closerange contact network. Rather, it captures a looser notion of social mixing at the chosen spatial and temporal scales. A link between two nodes indicates the possibility that the corresponding individuals have had a close-range encounter during a given day. Fig. 4B shows how the daily average degree has changed over time in the 4 largest Italian provinces -Turin, Milan, Rome and Naples -since January 18. In the provinces of Turin and Milan we observe a declining trend in k starting immediately after the first interventions took place on February 24. In the province of Rome and Naples, we still observe a declining trend but with the presence of some peaks or a milder reduction in k during the first week of outbreak. This may be explained by the fact that Rome and Naples were far from the center of the outbreak and there were still few or no reported cases in the area, at that time. When looking at all provinces of Italy, a consistent picture emerge: during the first week of outbreak the effects of social distancing on the users' network were visible only in the Northern provinces and much less elsewhere (see Fig.  S4 in the Supplementary Information).",

It is worth noticing that a mild drop in mobility was observed in the entire country, with a slight increase only in a few provinces, suggesting that individuals started to change their mobility behavior even beyond the official guidance, probably aiming to reduce the risk of getting infected. We observed similar results by also considering different mobility metrics: both the median radius of gyration and the average degree of the users' proximity network consistently decreased all over Italy, with a few exceptions. Finally, when stricter measures were in place at the national level, the population reacted uniformly across the country, largely limiting trips between different provinces.",

Although the sample of users under study well matches the population distribution of the Italian provinces (see Fig. S1 ), it is not representative of the general Italian population in terms of age and socio-economic status although we verified that it does represent fairly well population distribution at the provincial level. The population under study is not constant over time because users can opt-out sharing their geo-location at any time. Also, the internal logic of the data gathering system might fail in sensing users who stop moving for a prolonged period of time. This suggests that our estimates may underestimate the true effects of mobility restrictions. Finally, we do not try to characterize the trips made by our users, and we have no information as to whether a given trip is among those with an authorized purposed. Therefore, our results should not be interpreted as an assessment of the adherence by the Italian population to the restrictions.",
