LKT binding induces activation, and subsequent cytolysis, of these cells. It is well known that active viral infection greatly increases the susceptibility of cattle to pasteurellosis. To better understand the mechanism by which this occurs, we investigated the effects of experimental in vivo infection of cattle with bovine herpes virus-1 (BHV-1) on the ex vivo interaction of bovine leukocytes with the M. haemolytica LKT. In this study, we demonstrated that active BHV-1 infection increased the expression of the b 2 -integrin CD11a/CD18 (as de\u00aened by the mAb BAT75) on bovine peripheral blood neutrophils, enhanced the binding of LKT to bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) leukocytes and peripheral blood neutrophils, and increased the killing of BAL leukocytes and peripheral blood leukocytes by LKT. In addition, BHV-1 greatly increased the number of BAL, resulting in many more LKT-responsive cells being present in the lungs. These \u00aendings might explain in part the increased susceptibility of BHV-1 infected cattle to pneumonic pasteurellosis. #",

            "text": "The bovine respiratory disease (BRD) complex remains a major economic problem for both beef and dairy cattle industries in North America, and throughout the world (Frank, 1989; Wittum et al., 1996) . One of the clinically severest components of BRD is pneumonic pasteurellosis (shipping fever), which is characterized by acute lobar \u00aebronecrotizing pleuropneumonia with extensive polymorphonuclear leukocyte in\u00afux and death within pulmonary alveoli (Slocombe et al., 1985; Leite et al., 1999) . Mannheimia haemolytica A1 is the primary bacterial pathogen responsible for shipping fever (Yates, 1982; Gonzalez and Maheswaran, 1993) . M. haemolytica produces several virulence factors, foremost of which is a leukotoxin (LKT), whose cytotoxic activity is speci\u00aec for ruminant leukocytes and platelets (Gonzalez and Maheswaran, 1993) . The LKT is a Ca 2dependent pore-forming cytolysin, that is a member of the family of bacterial toxins designated RTX (repeats in toxin) (Welch, 1991) . It has been reported that RTX toxins bind to b 2 -integrins on target cells (Lally et al., 1997) . M. haemolytica LKT was reported to bind to the b 2 -integrin CD11a/CD18 (LFA-1), or CD18 alone, on bovine leukocytes (Ambagala et al., 1999; Li et al., 1999; Jeyaseelan et al., 1999; Leite et al., 2000) . This binding induces formation of pore-like structures in the plasma membrane, resulting in both activation of leukocytes, and death by apoptosis and necrosis Czuprynski, 1995, 1996; Wang et al., 1998; Sun et al., 1999; Clinkenbeard et al., 1994) .",

The mechanism by which viral infection impairs resistance of cattle to pulmonary pasteurellosis has not been clearly elucidated. One mechanism that might be involved is the release of in\u00afammatory cytokines during viral infection (Ohmann and Babiuk, 1985; Gonzalez and Maheswaran, 1993) . These cytokines (i.e. IL-1b, TNF-a) can activate bovine leukocytes and modulate the migration, and functional activation of b 2 -integrins on bovine leukocytes (Nagahata et al., 1995) .",

The purpose of the present study was to determine whether BHV-1 infection increased CD11a/CD18 expression, LKT binding and LKT killing of bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and peripheral blood leukocytes in vitro. The results we obtained suggest that active BHV-1 infection enhances the biological response of bovine leukocytes to M. haemolytica LKT ex vivo.",

One week before initiation of the experiment, all animals were tested and found to be free of detectable serum neutralizing antibodies to BHV-1. The animals were randomly assigned to two groups. Experimental infection of six calves was accomplished by intranasal inoculation of 10 6 plaque forming units (PFU) of BHV-1 (Cooper strain) suspended in 10 ml of RPMI 1640 (Mediatech, Cellgro, Herndon, VA).

We recovered greatly increased number of BAL from the BHV-1 infected cattle, with alveolar macrophages and other mononuclear cells being the most prominent cell populations as reported previously (Foreman et al., 1981) . The presence of more LKT-responsive cells in the lungs of BHV-1 infected cattle could play an important role in the pathogenesis of pasteurellosis. LKTmediated activation and death of increased number of BAL would corroborate with the intense lung in\u00afammation and damage noted in pasteurellosis (Slocombe et al., 1985; Wittum et al., 1996) . It is presumed that the in\u00afammatory process elicited by BHV-1 infection results in secretion of cytokines locally and into the systemic circulation (Ohmann and Babiuk, 1985; Yoo et al., 1995) . These in\u00afammatory cytokines would induce increased expression of adhesion molecules on leukocytes and endothelial cells resulting in increased migration and functional activation of b 2 -integrins on leukocytes in the lung (Arnaout, 1990; Williams and Solomkin, 1999) .",

            "text": "In this study, we observed increased cytotoxicity of LKT for PBLs at 5 and 7 days postinfection. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells exhibited a slight increase in LKT binding at day 5 post-infection P > 0:05, whereas PMNs exhibited increased CD11a/CD18 expression and increased LKT binding at 5 and 7 days post-infection P < 0:05. These observations support the previously reported association between LFA-1 expression, and the binding and cytotoxic activity of LKT for bovine peripheral blood leukocytes (Ambagala et al., 1999; Li et al., 1999; Jeyaseelan et al., 1999; Leite et al., 2000) . We believe it is likely that the increased CD11a/CD18 expression by PMNs from BHV-1 infected cattle is mediated by in\u00afammatory cytokines secreted during viral infection, rather than the direct effects of the virus. This supposition is based on reports that productive infection by BHV-1 does not occur in bovine peripheral blood leukocytes (Foreman et al., 1982a,b) . We have previously reported that bovine PMNs stimulated with IL-1b in vitro increased CD11a/CD18 expression, LKT binding and cytotoxicity (Leite et al., 2000) . These latter effects were inhibited by addition of the same BAT75 anti-CD11a/CD18 mAb used in the present study. The BAT75 mAb is reported to bind to both CD11a and CD18, although the precise binding site has not been determined. As a result, our results do not allow us to exclude the possible contributions of other b 2 -integrins (i.e. CD11b/CD18) in our\u00afow cytometry studies. Recently, we have obtained preliminary data indicating that incubation of bovine PMNs with other cytokines (TNF-a, IFN-g) also upregulates CD11a/CD18, and LKT binding and killing (unpublished observations).",

Nor did we observe differences in the intensity of CD11a/CD18 expression by BAL cells from BHV-1 infected or control cattle ( Fig. 2A) . In contrast, we observed a signi\u00aecant increase in LKT binding (Fig. 3) , and LKT mediated killing (Fig. 4) , of BAL from BHV-1 infected cattle. Stimulation of leukocytes can lead to conformational changes in the b 2 -integrin molecules that result in increased receptor af\u00aenity, rather than increased receptor number (Hibbs et al., 1991; Barnett et al., 1998) . Thus, one possible explanation for the apparent discrepancy between increased LKT binding to BAL, without increased CD11a/CD18 expression, is that the in\u00afammatory process in the BHV-1 infected lung stimulated a conformational change in CD11a/CD18 that increased its af\u00aenity for LKT. We have previously reported that RGD peptides block the binding of LKT to resting, but not IL-1b stimulated, bovine PMNs (Leite et al., 2000) . This prior observation is also consistent with the inference that CD11a/CD18 on stimulated bovine leukocytes has an increased af\u00aenity for LKT. However, we cannot have the possibility that the mAb (BAT75A) recognize other b 2 -integrins on leukocytes that do not play a role as a receptor to LKT, or that BAL cells possess an additional LKT receptor, besides CD11a/CD18.",

Thus, it is possible it might bind to other members of the b 2 -integrin family. A second limitation is that we did not distinguish which peripheral blood cell population was most susceptible to the action of LKT, since we did not separate these cells into PMN and PBMC enriched populations before assessing cytotoxicity. Although the method used to assess cytotoxicity (Trypan blue exclusion) is tedious and more subjective than some assays, it has been used by our laboratory and others to determine cell viability, and offers relatively rapid results as compared to other methods (i.e. color development in MTT or XTT assays). One \u00aenal limitation of our study was the day that we chose to perform the BAL (day 4 post-infection). This time was chosen because some previous reports suggested that it fell within the window of increased susceptibility to pasteurellosis (Yates, 1982) . Fig. 5 . Proposed model for the mechanism of viral\u00b1bacterial synergism in BRD. Viral infection induces the release of inflammatory cytokines that stimulate CD11a/CD18 expression on leukocytes. This will enhance M. haemolytica LKT binding to bovine leukocytes. LKT binding will activate leukocytes to release inflammatory mediators (e.g. reactive oxygen intermediates, enzymes, etc.) that will damage lung tissue. Eventually, the LKT kills the leukocytes and impairs the clearance of bacteria from the lungs. Together, these effects will contribute to the severe pneumonia that characterizes BRD. However, we observed an increase in CD11a/CD18 expression and LKT binding to PMNs on day 5 and 7 post-infection, suggesting that, ideally, BAL would be performed more than once after infection (i.e. 3\u00b17 days post-infection). However, we were concerned that performing BAL more than once on the same animal would confound our analyses. Financial constraints prevented us from adding more animals that would have allowed us to sample BAL, at more than one time point, without lavaging any animal more than once.",
