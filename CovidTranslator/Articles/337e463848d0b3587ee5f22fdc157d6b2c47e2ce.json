These biomolecules can act at different stages of viral infection, particularly at the molecular level to inhibit viral growth. Enterovirus A71 (EV-A71), a non-enveloped RNA virus, is one of the causative agents of hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD), which is prevalent in Asia. Despite much effort, no clinically approved antiviral treatment is available for children suffering from HFMD. Flavonoids from plants serve as a vast reservoir of therapeutically active constituents that have been explored as potential antiviral candidates against RNA and DNA viruses. Here, we reviewed flavonoids as evidence-based natural sources of antivirals against non-picornaviruses and picornaviruses. The detailed molecular mechanisms involved in the inhibition of EV-A71 infections are discussed.",

More than 6000 compounds have been identified as flavonoids based on their basic structures consisting of C6-C3-C6 and they are divided into several classes such as flavonols, flavanones, isoflavones, flavones, and anthocyanidins. Due to a wide range of biological activities being exhibited by flavonoids, they have become molecules of interest for natural drug discovery research. In this review, antiviral mechanisms of flavonoids, mainly against Enterovirus A-71 (EV-A71), will be discussed to provide evidence-based efficacy of antiviral properties.",

Different flavonoids have been found to inhibit the virus through various mechanisms. Based on antiviral mechanisms of action, flavonoids can be prophylactic inhibitors, therapeutic inhibitors or indirect inhibitors by interaction with the immune system. Flavonoids that inhibit viral activity can be further divided into the following sub-categories.",

Many natural compounds of various chemical classes have been identified as potential therapeutic agents. Several flavonoids have been studied to evaluate their antiviral potential. For example, quercetin and quercitrin were first demonstrated by Cutting et al. (1949) to prophylactically inhibit rabies virus in mice [3] . Moreover, quercetin was found to exhibit its antiviral activity against vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) by activation of macrophages [4] . Biologically active components of Elderberry extract dihydromyricetin and tetra-O-methyl quercetin were found to inhibit influenza A virus in vitro, most likely by binding to viral mannose-rich hemagglutinin domains which are important for the virus to enter the host cells [5] . Mechanistic studies later showed that it was able to inhibit neuraminidase activity of influenza A virus by interaction with the subunit 2 of the hemagglutinin that resulted in virus entry inhibition [6] . Quercitrin, a rhamnoside derivative of quercetin, was found to inhibit the initial stage of viral replication of the influenza A virus, evident by a decrease in mRNA synthesis of the virus. The study also concluded that quercitrin was unable to interact directly with virus particles [7] . Quercetin was shown to inactivate the NS3 helicase and NS5 protease of hepatitis C virus (HCV) [8, 9] . Quercetin also blocked viral binding and entry of herpes simplex virus (HSV)-1, HSV-2, and drug-resistant HSV-1 to Madin-Darby canine kidney NBL-2 (MDCK) cells [6] . Another flavonoid derivative, 3-\u03b2-O-d-glucoside, was able to protect mice from Ebola virus infection when given prior to virus challenge. However, the mechanism by which this flavonoid inhibited viral entry is unclear [10] .",

Genistein inhibited Vpu protein that is involved in the formation of ion channels in infected cells and thus controlled the release of HIV [19] . Ginkgetin inhibited sialidase activity of influenza A virus and thus inhibited virus assembly and release [20] . Fisetin possessed post-infection anti-CHIKV activity by the inhibition of NS proteins 1 and 3 in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, it was observed that CHIKV E2 protein and its precursor pE2 were also downregulated during treatment with fisetin [21] . Similarly, a decreased replication process of DENV-2 was observed when Vero cells were treated with fisetin after DENV-2 infection. It was postulated that this antiviral activity could be due to the direct binding of fisetin to the viral RNA, thus impeding polymerase activity [22] . Kaempferol and its structural flavonol derivatives were studied to identify the suitable pharmacophore to design antiviral against the influenza A virus. This study revealed that most of the flavonols with structural similarity with kaempferol were able to noncompetitively inhibit neuraminidase enzyme. However, the exact interacting partner is still unknown [23] . Moreover, kaempferol was also reported to inhibit 3a channels of coronavirus and blocked the release of virus progeny [24] .

Tea catechins were studied in clinical trials by Matsumoto and co-workers (2011). They conducted a randomized controlled trial to study the effects of tea catechins in the prevention of influenza virus infections in healthcare workers in elderly homes. Tea catechins were effective in preventing the clinical incidence of influenza infections in the treatment group as compared to the placebo group [39] . Epigallocatechin (EGC), a tea catechin flavonoid, was reported to inhibit the replication of influenza A and B viruses by in vitro acidification of the lysosomal and endosomal environment through clathrin-mediated endocytosis [40] . Apart from having antiviral activity against the influenza virus, another flavonoid from tea catechins, epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), was shown to directly bind to CD4+ T-cells. This binding blocked the binding of the HIV-1 envelope protein (gp120) and caused viral entry inhibition [41] . EGCG was also demonstrated to bind to the glycoprotein B and glycoprotein D of HSV to render it non-infective [42] . Moreover, EGCG was shown to have potent antiviral activity against CHIKV by blocking its entry, probably by competing for cellular co-receptors of target cells such as heparan sulfate or sialic acid [43] . EGCG was also found to inhibit the replication of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) by inhibition of Zta, Rta and EA-D genes. This inhibition interrupted the MEK/ERK1/2 and PI3-K/Akt signaling pathway of the lytic cycle EBV [44] . EGCG also inhibited hepatitis B virus (HBV) replication by impairment of the production of pre-core mRNA and replicative intermediates of DNA [45] . Zika virus was also inhibited by EGCG, as it was able to interact with the lipid envelope and blocked the entry of virus into cells [46] . It also caused acidification in lysosomes to make an unfavorable environment for virus replication [47] . The antiviral activities of several other flavonoids according to the mechanisms of inhibition against various viruses are summarized in Table 1 . Structures of these flavonoids can be found in Supplementary material Table S1 : Molecular structures of antiviral flavonoids. [6] .

Quercetin decreased endocytosis of RV and reduced phosphorylation of Akt (effector of phosphoinositol 3-kinase) when epithelial cells were pretreated with quercetin. In addition, it also reduced viral infection when added 6 h post-infection in vitro. Moreover, it also repressed interferon and interleukin-8 response, resulting in lower viral RNA and capsid protein production. Quercetin demonstrated similar effects in vivo with decreased viral loads and suppression of viral immune mediators [50] . Quercetin was shown to protect mice when challenged with the quercetin-treated Mengo virus. It was interesting to note that there was no antiviral activity detected when quercetin was tested in L-929 cells [3] . This observation led to the study of the role of interferon induction in antiviral activity. However, there was no significant detection of interferons in drug-treated mice. This resulted in speculating that the antiviral activity was achieved by macrophage activation instead of interferon induction. In the same study, quercetin was also found to inhibit encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) by macrophage activation [4] . A methyl derivative of quercetin was shown to inhibit poliovirus by blocking the synthesis of viral genomic RNA and proteins [51, 52] . Similarly, trimethylquercetin was shown to inhibit the production of progeny coxsackievirus B4 (CV-B4) and protected the mice from death upon lethal challenge [53] . In another independent study, dihydroquercetin isolated from Larix sibirica was found to mediate the in vivo CV-B4 infection by inhibition of ROS induced oxidative stress [54] .",

Human hnRNP A1 is an interaction partner of viral internal ribosome entry site (IRES) whereas hnRNP A2 is highly similar to hnRNP A1. Upon interaction of IRES with hnRNP A1 and hnRNP A2, the viral translation process is activated. Structural and non-structural viral proteins are formed via cleavage by 2A and 3C proteases. This is followed by the replication and assembly of viral RNA into the capsid, maturation of viral particles and release of virus from the cells [69] .",

            "text": "Flavonoid classes differ from each other by various substitutions particularly phenolic or hydroxyl (OH) groups on its flavan nucleus. Flavonoids that have successfully accounted for antiviral activity against EV-A71 mostly belong to the flavonoid sub-classes flavonols and flavones. Flavones are dual fused aromatic rings (A and C) with an extension of a benzene ring (B) at position 2 of ring C (Figure 3 ) [87] . The skeleton \"ring A fused with ring C\" has previously reported to possess antiviral activity against the dengue virus NS2B-NS3 complex [88] . Moreover, hydroxylation on ring A, particularly on positions 5 and 7, was found to be favorable for antiviral activity against the influenza A virus [89] . Based on previous findings, it can be expected that the same structure could attribute towards antiviral activity against EV-A71. It can be observed that the anti-EV-A71 flavonoids with methylation have drastically improved the antiviral activity such as in the case of chrysosplenetin, eupafolin, penduletin and pruning (Table  4 ). Moreover, presence of methoxy substitution at the position 7 of ring A, along with hydroxyl or methoxy group at position 6 rendered higher activity with lowest IC50 values (chrysosplenetin, eupafolin, penduletin) amongst all evaluated flavonoids. Prunin, a glucoside of naringenin, having large glucose moiety at position 7 instead of methoxy substitution, interestingly showed potent antiviral activity as well. From these examples, it can be speculated that positions 6 and 7 of ring A require bulky group substitutions in order to possess potent activity against EV-A71. Possible interactions between different substitutions and EV-A71 could be studied in silico to determine the nature of bonds involved in antiviral activity. It must be noted the antiviral activity of flavonoids was evaluated against specific EV-A71 genotype/subgenotype. It is unknown if there is a broad spectrum of antiviral activities against other EV-A71 genotypes/subgenotypes.

            "text": "Flavonoids are abundant in fruits and vegetables and therefore are considered as safe and non-toxic for human consumption. However, the bioavailability of these flavonoids in their crude form is very poor. Use of isolated, purified or chemically synthesized small molecular weight flavonoids has increased prospects to reach the target. To further enhance the stability, solubility and improved systemic distribution, a nano-drug delivery system can be employed [90] . Despite possessing the potential to treat EV-A71 in vitro and in mice, flavonoids have failed to reach clinical trials. Some of the possible reasons could include infancy of in vivo studies on flavonoids against EV-A71 as there have been only two reports which were published in 2019, claiming absolute protection of mice by prunin and isorhamnetin [68, 72] . Moreover, lack of long-term toxicity data on purified flavonoids contributes challenges to further progress these potential molecules to clinical trials. Another important factor could be the development of resistance by mutant viruses against these flavonoids. Like any other drug candidate, purified flavonoids require regulatory approval from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) before it can be marketed as antivirals. Detailed pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamics and long-term toxicology studies on these flavonoids are necessary before they can be offered as a therapeutic option.",

These flavonoids were also found to be safe and non-cytotoxic to human cells as indicated by CC 50 values. Flavonoids such as prunin could confer 100% protection of neonatal mice while luteolin showed 91.67% protection against lethal challenges with EV-A71. However, flavonoids with higher IC 50 values can also serve as a potential antiviral against EV-A71. For instance, kaempferol and isorhamnetin exhibited higher IC 50 in vitro but both conferred significant protection of mice from viral challenge. The flavonoids that have not yet been tested in vivo could be further evaluated to identify their effectiveness.",

In light of the current finding of the in vivo efficacy of some flavonoids against EV-A71, it can be concluded that flavonoids have great potential to be developed as therapeutic candidates against EV-A71.
