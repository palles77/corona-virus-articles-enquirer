Five primers recommended by World Health Organization (WHO) were used to amplify the fragments by single PCR and multiplex PCR. Three target cDNA fragments (121, 182 and 302 bp), as well as the three different combinations of any two of these fragments, were amplified by single PCR.

So far, multiplex PCR has been used to detect transgenic products (1 ) and many viruses, such as smallpox virus (http://www.who.int/emc/pdfs/smallpoxenglish.pdf) and newcastle disease virus (2-3). Since we were not able to get SARS-CoV sample, and neither could possess a P3 laboratory, we synthesized artificially the target cDNA fragments of SARS-CoV according to the genome sequence of SARS-CoV in GenBank submitted by The Chinese University of Hong Kong, and used it as simulated positive samples.

Final concentration of each primer pair listed inTable 1was 0.2 \u00b5mol/L in both single PCR and multiplex PCR systems. Taq polymerase was added with 1 Unit for single PCR, 1.5 Unit for duplex PCR, and 2 Units for triplex PCR. ddH 2 O was added to the final size of 25 \u00b5L. PCR reactions were carried out using DNA Thermal Programmer (Biometra, Goettingen, Germany) as follows: 94\u2103 for 2 min, followed by 42 cycles of 94\u2103 for 30 s, 55\u2103 for 30 s, and 72\u2103 for 30 s. The final stage was 72\u2103 for 5 min.",
