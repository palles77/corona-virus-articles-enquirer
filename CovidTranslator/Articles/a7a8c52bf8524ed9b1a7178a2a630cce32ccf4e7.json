PDCoV has since been identified in Canada, China, South Korea and Laos [1, 6, 9] . In Thailand, PDCoV was first reported in 2015 [10] . However, it is unknown whether PDCoV was present in Thailand prior to 2015. We therefore conducted a retrospective study to detect the presence of PDCoV intestinal samples from Thailand that had been submitted for the identification of enteric diseases. Positive samples were subjected to full-length genome characterization followed by genetic analyses to compare Thai strains of PDCoV to those from other countries and to investigate the genetic similarity and the evolutionary relationships among them.",

Complementary DNA (cDNA) was synthesized from the extracted RNA using M-MuLV reverse transcriptase (New England BioLabs Inc., Ipswich, MA, USA).

These four provinces contain three major swine-producing areas of Thailand. These results suggest that PDCoV is widespread throughout Thailand. It is noteworthy that 144 samples (59.75%) were positive for PEDV and that samples that were positive for PDCoV were also positive for PEDV. The results suggest the presence of mixed infections with PEDV and PDCoV in pigs. The production records of the herd in which PDCoV was first detected showed that there had been three diarrhea outbreaks during 2014 and 2015, and both PEDV and PDCoV were detected. In three diarrhea outbreaks, the pre-weaning mortality rate was 56.9, 52.1 and 65.3%, respectively. However, we were unable to define the relationship between PEDV and PDCoV regarding to the primary or secondary causes of the diarrhea outbreaks. Whether coinfection with these viruses would necessitate more-complex control methods or would result in more-frequent, repetitive outbreaks requires further investigation. The pairwise nucleotide and amino acid sequence identity values of the full-length genome sequences of the four Thai PDCoV isolates are shown in Table 3 . These sequences were 98. .1% identical at the nucleotide and 97.4-97.9% identical at the amino acid level and were more closely related to each other and to variants from China and the United States than to Thai strains isolated in 2015, suggesting that the Thai PDCoV population is continuously changing.",

            "text": "In conclusion, we retrospectively investigated the presence of PDCoV in Thailand and found that PDCoV has been present in Thailand since at least February 2013 and that it is present in mixed infections with PEDV. Interestingly, the PDCoV variants in Thailand are different from variants in other countries and belong to a novel group of PDCoV strains. Evolutionary analysis suggested that the Thai PDCoV isolates likely diverged from a different ancestor from that of the Chinese and US PDCoV isolates, and the separation occurred after 1994. This study provides interesting results associated with the emergence and the evolution of PDCoV. Further investigation, including more retrospective studies of available samples, will provide a better understanding of this pathogen.",

Interestingly, the sample was also positive for PEDV. Four samples collected in 2014 from two farms in Ratchaburi were PDCoV positive. On one of these farms, samples from 2013 and 2014 were positive for both PDCoV and PEDV. In 2015, PDCoV was detected in eight samples collected from five farms located in Ratchaburi, Saraburi,",

The clustering of the PDCoV isolates in the Thai PDCoV clade is well supported, with a posterior probability of 0.9993.
