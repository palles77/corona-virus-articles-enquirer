Unfortunately, there is no effective antiviral drug or vaccine against the virus until now. Identification of new anti-ASFV drugs is urgently needed. Here, an up-to-date set of protein-protein interactions (PPIs) between ASFV and swine were curated by integration of PPIs from multiple sources. Thirty-two swine proteins were observed to interact with ASFVs and were defined as AIPs. They were found to play a central role in the swine PPI network, with significant larger degree, betweenness and smaller shortest path length than other swine proteins. Some of AIPs also interacted with several other viruses and could be taken as potential targets of drugs for broad-spectrum effect, such as HSP90AB1. Finally, the antiviral drugs which targeted AIPs and ASFV proteins were predicted. Several drugs with either broad-spectrum effect or high specificity on AIPs were identified, such as Polaprezinc. This work could not only deepen our understanding towards the ASFV-swine interactions, but also help for the development of effective antiviral drugs against the ASFVs. author/funder.

Several studies have identified multiple compounds which could inhibit ASFV infections 4 . For example, a recent study by Hakobyan et al. found that the rigid amphipathic fusion inhibitors displayed a potent and dose-dependent inhibitory effect on ASFV infection 6 . Another recent study by Arabyan et al. showed that the genistein could hamper the ASFV infection by inhibiting the ASFV type II topoisomerase 7 .

Besides, they may be more mutant-insensitive since the host protein evolves much slower than viral proteins. With the rapid development of high-throughput assays, a large amount of protein-protein interactions (PPIs) between virus and host has been accumulated. Analysis of these PPIs in the perspective of network can help identify host proteins of importance for viral infection, which could be taken as potential targets for antiviral research 8, 10 .

On the contrary, the drugs targeting the host protein may have the advantage of stable effect since the host proteins generally evolve far slower than viral proteins 24, 25 There were two limitations to this study. Firstly, the PPIs between swine and ASFV are far from complete. The ASFV encodes more than 150 proteins. Only 16 of them were involved in the PPIs analyzed here. Much more efforts are needed to generate a comprehensive PPI network between swine and ASFV. Fortunately, based on the limited PPIs between swine and ASFV, several antiviral drugs were predicted and had the potential for further development 26, 27 . Secondly, the drugs predicted here need further experimental validations. Several drugs with high specificity on AIPs, or with broad-spectrum effect, such as Polaprezinc, could be prioritized for validation.",

Both of them (highlighted in red-edge) were approved for use, suggesting their potential use for treating the ASFVs. Some drugs were observed to have strong specificity on the ASFV protein or AIPs, such as the Hydroxyurea(DB01005), Infliximab (DB00065), Adalimumab(DB00051), and so on. Hydroxyurea specifically targeted F778R. It is an antineoplastic agent that inhibits DNA synthesis through the inhibition of ribonucleoside diphosphate reductase. It may be used to inhibit DNA synthesis of the ASFV virus, thus blocking the proliferation of the virus. Infliximab specifically targeted TNF and is primarily related to inflammation control and neurological indications. It may be used to block the necrosis during the ASFV infection. Some drugs were observed to target multiple AIPs, such as Geldanamycin (DB02424), Polaprezinc (DB09221) and Andrographolide (DB05767). For example, Polaprezinc could target the TNF, HSP90AA1 and HSP90AB1, among which both HSP90AB1 and HSP90AA1 played a central role in the swine PPI network and swine-virus PPI network. Therefore, Polaprezinc may have a broad-spectrum effect in disrupting the swine-ASFV PPI network, and may inhibit the viral infections effectively.author/funder. All rights reserved.
