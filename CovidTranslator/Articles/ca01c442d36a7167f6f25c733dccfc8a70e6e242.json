            "text": "The autophagic machinery was first described in yeast, and homologues were found in mammals. The core components consist of more than 30 autophagy proteins (ATGs) 145 . Autophagy is controlled by the sequential activities of three key protein complexes: the serine/threonine protein kinase ulK1 complex (comprising ulK1, FAK family kinase-interacting protein of 200 kDa (FIP200; also known as RB1CC1), ATG13 and ATG101) [146] [147] [148] ; the phosphoinositide 3-kinase catalytic subunit type III (PI3KC3) complex (comprising Beclin 1, vacuolar protein sorting 34 (vPS34), vPS15 and ATG14l) 149, 150 and the ATG16l1 complex (comprising ATG16l1, ATG5 and ATG12) 151 . under nutrient-rich conditions, the serine/threonine kinase mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mToRC1) phosphorylates and inactivates the autophagy initiators ulK1 and ATG13. Nutrient starvation or rapamycin, which is an mToRC1 inhibitor, induces the formation of the active ulK1 complex, which ultimately phosphorylates and activates the Beclin 1-vPS34 complex 152, 153 . The lipid kinase vPS34 creates phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate (PtdIns3P)-rich regions on the surface of donor membranes, including the endoplasmic reticulum (eR), Golgi apparatus, eR-mitochondria contact sites, endosomes and the plasma membrane [154] [155] [156] [157] [158] . During autophagy initiation, PtdIns3P on the isolation membrane is recognized by the PtdIns3P-binding factors WD-repeat domain phosphoinositide-interacting protein 1 (WIPI1)-WIPI4 (ReF. 159 ). The binding of WIPI1 and WIPI2 to the PtdInsP3P-enriched phagophore is crucial for the recruitment of the ATG16l1 complex, which consequently facilitates lC3 lipidation. The ATG16l complex is generated through a ubiquitin-like (uBl) conjugation reaction in which ATG12 is conjugated to ATG5 by the sequential action of ATG7 and ATG10 (ReF. 160 ). ATG16l1 non-covalently binds to the ATG5-ATG12 conjugate to form a multimeric complex 151 . Another uBl molecule, lC3, is cleaved by the ATG4 protease at its C-terminal arginine to expose a glycine residue 161 and is subjected to a second uBl conjugation reaction involving ATG7 and ATG3 (ReF. 162 ). There are seven mammalian orthologues of ATG8 (lC3A, lC3B, lC3C, \u03b3-aminobutyric acid receptor-associated protein (GABARAP), GABARAPl1, GABARAPl2 and GABARAPl3; in this Review, we refer to them as lC3). The ATG16l1 complex then conjugates lC3 to phosphatidylethanolamine (Pe) to complete the reaction 163 . This lipidated form of lC3 mediates membrane tethering and fusion to extend the isolation membrane by recruiting membranes from multiple sources, leading to the formation of autophagosomes 164 . During the final maturation, autophagosomes are decorated with RAB7 and the tail-anchored SNAP receptor (SNARe) syntaxin 17 (STX17), which leads to fusion with lysosomes and degradation of sequestered substrates 109 . The Beclin 1-PI3KC3 complex subunit ATG14l directly binds the SNARe complex STX17-SNAP29 together with vesicle-associated membrane protein 8 (vAmP8). An adaptor called pleckstrin homology domain-containing protein family member 1 (PleKHm) binds to lC3, RAB7 and STX17. PleKHm1 recruits the tethering complex transmembrane and ubiquitin-like domain-containing protein 1 (HoPS; also known as TmuB1) and brings the autophagosome and lysosome together 165 . At this stage, the Beclin 1-vPS34 complex is identifiable by the presence of ultraviolet radiation resistance-associated gene protein (uvRAG) instead of ATG14l 149 .

Both adaptors activate nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB) for the synthesis of inflammatory cytokines and IFN regulatory factors (IRFs) for triggering IFN production 16 . TLR stimulation induces binding of MYD88 or TRIF to Beclin 1, which disrupts the Beclin 1-B cell lymphoma-2 (BCL-2) interaction and ultimately activates autophagy (FIg. 1) . Conversely, autophagy can inhibit TLR signalling by promoting the selective degradation of TRIF 17 (FIg. 1) Fig. 1 | Pattern recognition receptors and autophagy. In host cells, various pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs) recognize viral pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), which leads to the activation of transcription factors and the induction of the interferon (IFN) response. Endosomal Toll-like receptors (TLRs) recognize viral nucleic acids and recruit the adaptor proteins TIR domain-containing adaptor molecule 1 (TRIF) and myeloid differentiation primary response protein MYD88, relaying signals to the nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB) and mitogen-associated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways. Binding to MYD88 or TRIF causes Beclin 1 to dissociate from the B cell lymphoma-2 (BCL-2) inhibitory complex, resulting in the induction of autophagy. TRIF is targeted by selective autophagy by the tripartite motif-containing protein 32 (TRIM32)-TAX1-binding protein 1 (TAX1BP1) complex for degradation. JUN N-terminal kinase (JNK) phosphorylates BCL-2 to initiate Beclin 1-mediated autophagy. During RNA virus infection, retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) senses double-stranded (ds)RNA and signals through mitochondrial antiviral-signalling protein (MAVS) to activate interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3), leading to the production of IFN. To suppress RIG-I signalling, the autophagy protein 5 (ATG5)-ATG12 complex disrupts the interaction between RIG-I and MAVS. Interferon-induced, dsRNA-activated protein kinase (PKR) phosphorylates eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 subunit 1 (eIF2\u03b1) to induce autophagy. During DNA virus infection, the DNA sensor cyclic GMP-AMP (cGAMP) synthase (cGAS) produces the secondary messenger cGAMP, which activates stimulator of interferon genes protein (STING), IRF3 and IFN expression. Furthermore, cGAS competes with Rubicon for Beclin 1 binding, thus triggering autophagy. Beclin 1 also suppresses cGAMP production and activates ULK1 to phosphorylate STING for its degradation. ATG9 inhibits the aggregation of STING on Golgi apparatus-derived compartments to suppress the DNA sensing. STING undergoes desumoylation and chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA)-mediated degradation. Finally , extracellular IFN is recognized by the interferon receptor (IFNAR) and activates JAK-STAT (Janus kinase-signal transducer and activator of transcription) signalling. JAK1 and non-receptor tyrosine-protein kinase TYK2 phosphorylate insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) and IRS2, leading to the activation of the PI3K-AKT-mTOR (phosphoinositide 3-kinase-AKT-mechanistic target of rapamycin) pathway and forkhead box 3 transcription factor (FOXO3) as well as the expression of autophagy-related genes.

ATG5 also contributed to TLR9-induced IFN\u03b1 production in pDCs infected with herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) 19 . During viral infection, TLR activation tends to induce autophagy to improve IFN production, whereas the negative regulation of autophagy helps terminate TLR signalling. The RIG-I like receptors (RLRs) retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I; also known as DDX58) and melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 (MDA5; also known as IFIH1) sense viral RNAs in the cytosol and signal through interaction with mitochondrial antiviral-signalling (MAVS) via their caspase-recruiting domain (CARD), activating interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3), IRF7 and NF-\u03baB 20 . Although autophagy enhances IFN production in virally infected cells, it also can limit RLR-triggered IFN production. ATG5 deficiency increases the production of IFN in response to RNA viruses such as VSV and inhibits viral replication 21 . The ATG5-ATG12 complex and its binding protein (elongation factor Tu, mitochondrial (TUFM)) suppress dsRNA-induced production of IFN by disrupting RIG-I signalling 22 (FIg. 1 ). In addition, interferon-induced, dsRNA-activated protein kinase (EIF2AK2; also known as PKR) binds to Beclin 1 within the vacuolar protein sorting 34 (VPS34) complex, which initiates the formation of autophagosomes. PKR-mediated phosphorylation of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 subunit 1 (EIF2S1; also known as eIF2\u03b1) also induces autophagy 23 (FIg. 1) . The RLRs provide an example of how autophagy can negatively regulate immune signalling.",

Subsequently, cGAMP binds to and activates the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associated stimulator of interferon genes protein (STING), leading to IRF3 activation and IFN production (FIg. 1) . During HSV-1 infection, the DNA-sensing pathway and autophagy pathway converge: Beclin 1 interacts with and impairs the nucleotidyl transferase activity of cGAS, decreasing the amount of cGAMP available to stimulate STING 25 . Conversely, cGAS competes with the autophagy inhibitor Rubicon for Beclin 1 binding, thus triggering autophagy and stimulating the degradation of cytosolic viral DNA to avoid persistent immune stimulation 25 . In addition, cGAMP leads to the dissociation of ULK1 from 5\u2032-AMP-activated protein kinase catalytic subunit \u03b12 (AMPK), and activated ULK1 then phosphorylates STING, leading to its degradation 26 (FIg. 1) . Loss of ATG9 causes aggregation of STING on Golgi apparatus-derived compartments and increases STING-dependent production of IFNs 27 . During the late phase of HSV-1 infection, STING is also targeted by CMA-mediated degradation to terminate IFN signalling 28 . Additionally, cGAS-dependent signalling induces autophagy, which promotes pathogen clearance and functions as a negative feedback loop to turn off signalling.",

            "text": "The precise mechanisms controlling selective autophagy are still unclear. The best evidence for the specificity of autophagy comes from the selective degradation of large cellular structures, pathogens, damaged organelles and protein aggregates. The removal of these components by selective autophagy is crucial for cellular homeostasis. According to the cargo, there are different types of autophagy: reticulophagy (endoplasmic reticulum) 97 , mitophagy (mitochondria) 166 , ribophagy (ribosomes) 167 and pexophagy (peroxisomes) 168 . 'Xeno' means 'stranger' or 'foreigner'; thus, xenophagy refers to selective autophagy targeting intracellular pathogens. Xenophagy targets and removes intracellular pathogens, including bacteria and viruses. A hallmark of xenophagy is its coordination by the recognition of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAmPs) by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs). The invading microorganisms are first phagocytosed and then delivered to autophagosomes. Here, pathogen specificity is mediated by xenophagy signalling receptors, such as p62 (sequestosome 1), next to of BRCA1 gene 1 protein (NBR1), calcium-binding and coiled-coil domain-containing protein 2 (NDP52; also known as CAlCoCo2) and optineurin, which are a subset of PRRs called p62/SQSTm1-like receptors (SlRs) [169] [170] [171] [172] . SlRs contain cargo recognition domains (CDRs), which recognize ubiquitin or galectin on intracellular pathogens, and lC3-interacting regions (lIRs), which recruit membranes to autophagosomes. Additionally, NDP52 interacts through its galectin-interacting region with galectin 8, which binds to cytoplasmically exposed \u03b2-galactoside glycans on pathogen-damaged endosomal membranes 173 . Autophagy can target invading pathogens in a process termed lC3-associated phagocytosis (lAP), which describes the recruitment of lC3 to phagosomes. lAP does not involve sequestration in double-membrane autophagosomes; instead, lC3 binds to and decorates a recently formed but intact phagosomal membrane.",

Protein response is determined based on the conversion of soluble lC3-I to lipidated lC3-II, which can be detected by immunoblot or immunofluorescent visualization of enhanced green fluorescent protein-lC3 puncta formation. Furthermore, red fluorescent protein-GFP-lC3 dual fluorescence can be used to visualize autophagosome maturation and lysosome fusion. other markers of xenophagy include p62, ATGs, lysosome-associated membrane glycoprotein 1 (lAmP1), lAmP2 and upstream markers such as Beclin 1. The use of these markers, together with genetic knockdown of ATG effector proteins, will determine if a pathogen activates xenophagy during infection.

Autophagy can also contribute to antigen presentation when TAP is inhibited. Both HSV-1 and human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) encode TAP-blocking proteins 55 .

Adaptor protein p62 binds to ubiquitin-coated viral particles that are subsequently delivered to the autophagic machinery.

During hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, the host endoplasmic reticulum (ER) transmembrane protein SCOTIN associates with HCV non-structural protein 5A (NS5A) and leads to its degradation, restricting HCV replication. Poliovirus infection and membrane rupture are detected by galectin 8, targeting the virus to autophagosomes. Poliovirus uses HRAS-like suppressor 3 (PL A2G16) to escape from autophagic degradation. HIV-1 virion infectivity factor (Vif) is targeted by histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6) for degradation. The autophagy protein 5 (ATG5)-ATG12-ATG16L1 complex is recruited in the replication complex and restricts norovirus (NoV) replication through interferon-\u03b3 (IFN\u03b3)-inducible GTPases. In antigen-presenting cells (APCs), autophagy delivers intracellular and extracellular antigens to the endolysosome, where they are loaded onto major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules for presentation to CD4 + T cells. EBV nuclear antigen 1 (EBNA1) is the dominant CD4 + T cell antigen and is primarily processed in the autophagosome. HIV-1 Gag is also targeted by the autophagosome for processing. Autophagy regulates the internalization of MHC class I molecules from the cell membrane via AP2-associated kinase 1 (AAK1). UL138 from human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) and gB from HSV-1 are presented on MHC class I molecules in an autophagy-dependent pathway , when antigen peptide transporter (TAP)-dependent presentation is blocked. Autophagy also promotes an alternative pathway of class I presentation called cross-presentation. It modulates trafficking and processing of phagocytosed antigens from the endosome to MHC I, and autophagy induces antigen packaging in donor cells for release to APCs presented to CD8 + T cells in an autophagy-dependent pathway 57, 58 and colocalizes with LAMP2-positive late endosomal structures 57 (FIg. 2) . This suggests that autophagic viral cargos and antigens can access the MHC class I presentation machinery.",

These viral BCL-2 (vBCL-2) proteins mimic their cellular counterparts (cBCL-2) and attenuate autophagy through direct interaction with Beclin 1 (ReF. 70 ). Structural and biochemical analyses demonstrate that vBCL-2 has a markedly higher affinity for Beclin 1 and inhibits autophagosome formation more efficiently than cBCL-2 (ReF. 71 ). Moreover, vBCL-2 lacks the regulatory loop of cBCL-2 that is phosphorylated by JUN N-terminal kinase (JNK) 72 ; therefore, it can continuously associate with Beclin 1 (ReF. 73 ) (FIg. 3) . These data collectively show that vBCL-2 has evolved to be a highly potent autophagy inhibitor. Although EBV also encodes two vBCL-2 proteins (BHRF1 and BALF1), it is unknown whether they inhibit autophagy 74 . The K7 protein of KSHV promotes Rubicon-Beclin 1 interaction and inhibits the enzymatic activity of VPS34, which blocks the fusion of autophagosomes with lysosomes 75 (FIg. 3) . In addition, KSHV vFLIP, a homologue of the cellular FLICE-like inhibitor protein (FLIP; also known as ORF71), suppresses autophagy 76 by preventing ATG3 from binding and processing LC3 during autophagosome elongation (FIg. 3) . Interestingly, two KSHV vFLIP-derived peptides are individually sufficient for binding and releasing ATG3 from cellular FLIP, which results in robust autophagy and autophagic cell death 76 .",

When CVB3-infected cells were treated with inhibitors of autophagosome maturation, virion production was increased and p62 protein levels remained unchanged 82 , suggesting that viral replication increases the generation of autophagic membrane structures without progression to lysosomal degradation. FMDV also induces ATG5-dependent autophagosome formation and redistributes LC3 to punctate vesicles. However, this induction does not require the ZIKV non-structural protein 4A (NS4A) and NS4B activate autophagy by inhibiting AKT and mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1). Furthermore, the viral protease NS3 cleaves reticulophagy regulator 1 (FAM134B) to block reticulophagy so that ZIKV can use the ER as a replication site. Influenza A virus (IAV) M2 binds to and relocalizes LC3 to the plasma membrane. A highly pathogenic IAV H5N1 strain modulates the AKT-tuberin (TSC2)-mTOR pathway to induce autophagy. Human parainfluenza virus type 3 (HPIV3) also directly inhibits the interaction between syntaxin 17 (STX17) and synaptosomal-associated protein 29 (SNAP29) by expressing phosphoprotein P, resulting in the accumulation of autophagosomes.

            "text": "Autophagy and viral pathogenesis Ideally, cells use autophagy to control viral replication, destroy viral particles and activate immune signalling, all of which should prevent disease. However, the success of many viruses depends on the subversion and sequestration of host autophagic responses. For example, in neurons, autophagy is involved in HSV-1 replication and reactivation of latent infection 128 . During reactivation in neurons, HSV-1 can relocate to the central nervous system, and, there, the expression of the autophagy inhibitor ICP34.5 is involved in causing fatal encephalitis 129, 130 . Strikingly, 50% of mice infected with wild-type HSV-1 developed neuropathogenesis, whereas an ICP34.5mutant caused no symptoms 131 . ICP34.5-mediated inhibition of Beclin 1-dependent autophagy is a crucial regulatory step for HSV-1 pathogenesis in the central nervous system. Numerous cancer risk factors, such as ageing, obesity and chronic inflammation, disturb autophagy 132 . Accordingly, as improved autophagy correlates with tumour-suppression, its downregulation by viral infection may facilitate cancer development. Viruses that are associated with cancer development, including EBV, hepatitis B virus (HBV), HCV and KSHV, have evolved multiple strategies to avoid autophagy-mediated elimination, which can facilitate tumour progression. During reactivation, EBV replication and transcription activator (Rta) transiently activates autophagy through extracellular-signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signalling 133 , but early lytic viral products block autophagy and prevent degradation 134 . In Burkitt's lymphoma cells, the inhibition of autophagy increases EBV transcription and replication, which links the modulation of autophagy to EBV-associated malignancies 135 . The HBV small surface protein increases the risk of liver cancer by triggering the UPR and autophagy. Moreover, HBV X protein (HBx) binds to VPS34 and stimulates autophagy initiation. HBx also interacts with V-ATPase and impairs lysosome acidification, resulting in hepatocyte death 136 . Similar to HBV, HCV infection frequently leads to chronic liver diseases, liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. HCV-infected hepatocytes have high UPR levels, which activates autophagy, sustains viral replication and induces disease progression 137, 138 . As mentioned before, the KSHV vFLIP and vBCL-2 target ATG3 and Beclin 1, respectively, and these interactions block autophagosome formation and vesicle nucleation, thereby supporting KSHV replication and disease progression.",

Moreover, viruses manipulate autophagy for their immune evasion, replication and release from infected cells. The broad mechanisms that viruses use to interfere with autophagy are striking. Viruses that establish either acute or persistent infections often target similar host pathways, but they do so in unique ways and with different functional outcomes. Further, a virus may block certain aspects of autophagy while requiring others. For example, herpesviruses have genes that potently block autophagosome maturation, yet autophagosomes are the source of their outer membrane. Many RNA viruses exist in an intriguing balance in which they both cannot live with autophagy and cannot live without it. Each virus uses unique strategies to fine-tune autophagy signalling so that it can simultaneously escape destruction while harnessing the structural and nutrient benefits that autophagy provides. However, the exact functions of ATG proteins and the detailed mechanisms that govern autophagy during viral infection are still being elucidated. Further research is needed to clarify the detailed functions of autophagy for immunity against viral infections and for viral pathogenesis.",

ICP34.5 also recruits the phosphatase PP1\u03b1 to dephosphorylate eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 subunit 1 (eIF2\u03b1) and blocks tank-binding kinase 1 (TBK1)-mediated autophagosome maturation. HSV-1 tegument protein Us11 interacts with interferoninduced, double-stranded RNA-activated protein kinase (PKR) to prevent the phosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1 and regulates autophagosome formation. Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) encodes a functional homologue of ICP34.5 called TRS1, which can bind to Beclin 1 and inhibit autophagy. \u03b3-Herpesviruses carry viral homologues of B cell lymphoma-2 (vBCL-2), which attenuate autophagosome formation by interacting with Beclin 1. vBCL-2 evades JUN N-terminal kinase (JNK) phosphorylation, allowing it to bind to Beclin 1 with high affinity. Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) expresses another host protein homologue, vFLIP, that prevents autophagy protein 3 (ATG3) from processing LC3 during phagosome elongation. KSHV K7 interacts with Rubicon and inhibits fusion of the autophagosome with the lysosome. Viruses also control autophagosome formation and remodel vesicles for viral replication. Poliovirus induces autophagy to form a double-membrane vesicle (DMV) for replication. The poliovirus proteins 2BC and 3A increase LC3 lipidation and DMV formation. The foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) capsid protein VP1 uses the adaptor p62 for autophagosome formation. Mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) hijacks the LC3-coated EDEMsosome by accumulating endoplasmic reticulum (ER) degradation-enhancing \u03b1-mannosidase-like protein 1 (EDEM1) and OS-9 in DMVs. Flaviviruses (dengue virus (DENV), West Nile virus (WNV) and Zika virus (ZIKV)) use ER-derived membranes for viral replication.",
