It is our contention that one of the factors responsible for such emergence is the trade in wildlife and bushmeat in particular. This article considers the effect of increasing diversity in the species hunted on the probability of global epidemics such as SARS. In particular, we develop a mathematical model of the probability of such an outbreak in terms of the number of species hunted, the number of susceptibles, and the rate of contact. Hence, we postulate that local biodiversity loss and increasing rates of animal trafficking, and trade and transportation of animals to large cities-where there is a greater potential for person-to-person transmission-may increase the probability of such outbreaks dramatically.",

These two epidemics have also reemphasized the importance of zoonotic origins for many emerging infectious diseases (Desselberger, 2000; Weiss, 2001) . SARS is one of a number of recent examples of emergent zoonotic diseases where wild, nondomesticated species have been highlighted in the search for animal origins (Guan et al., 2003; Lau et al., 2005) The list of infectious diseases thought to have their origin in wildlife encompasses some of the most feared diseases including Ebola virus, Lassa virus, hanta virus, bubonic plague, and human immunodeficiency virus (Weiss, 2001) . Indeed, in a review of human infectious agents, it was found that emerging infections were more likely to be viral and more likely to be zoonotic than bacterial or protozoal pathogens (Woolhouse et al., 2001; Woolhouse and Gowtage-Sequeria, 2005) .",

We have recently raised the hypothesis that the international, and often illegal, wildlife trade may have been a significant factor in the emergence of SARS (Bell et al., 2004) . In this article, we further highlight the risks posed to human health by the wildlife trade and hypothesize that this risk may be increasing.

May (1988) drew attention to the low number of microbes described but was uncertain if this reflected underrecording or ''real'' low species richness. Colwell et al. (1994) suggested that just 1% of an estimated 5 \u00b7 10 5 viral species has been described. Although there have been some subsequent attempts to catalogue viral biodiversity at a local scale (Sabatini et al., 1965) , accurate estimates, of both total viral diversity and the proportion of microbial biodiversity potentially infectious for humans, remain elusive (Wilson, 1992) . However, it is likely that most of the, as yet undescribed, viruses are restricted to equatorial regions. Hunter and Izsak (1993) and, subsequently, Guernier et al. (2004) found a latitudinal gradient in diversity of human infectious diseases in parallel with that observed for most taxa (Pianto, 1967; Rosenzweig, 1995) .",

As hunting pressure at a particular site increases, there is a predictable shift in the species composition of harvested prey items ''hunter-capture profiles''-from a few large-bodied species to several smallbodied species (Jerozolimskia and Peres, 2003) . For example, in one wildlife market in Equatorial Guinea between 1991 and 1996, while the number of carcasses entering the market increased by 60% over that period, the accompanying increase in biomass was only 12.5% (Fa et al., 2000) . Consequently, any person involved in the hunting or processing of wildlife within such a trade system may have to capture/prepare greater numbers of individuals from an increasing range of species.",

In Southeast Asia, where the trade is predominantly of live animals, the demand for wildlife in traditional medicine, wildlife restaurants, and the pet trade poses a threat both to the persistence of viable populations of overharvested species and potentially to human health (Li and Li, 1998; Gonzalez, 2003; Duarte-Quiroga and Estrada, 2003) . In Vietnam, for example, the shift from subsistence hunting to sales in the wildlife trade for species such as civets, wild pig, deer, porcupine, and snakes appears to have been driven by increased market prices and increased national and international demand (Roberton et al., 2003) .",

These include: the number of animal-human interactions; the number of different species to which humans are exposed; the probability that any animal is carrying a pathogen; the nature of the human-animal interaction; the genetic susceptibility of the human hosts; the infectiousness of the pathogen for humans, and its virulence and geographical remoteness.",

R 0 can be defined as ''the expected number of secondary infections originated by a 'typical' infective individual when introduced into a population of susceptibles.'' Clearly, in the emergence of any new infectious disease which has not previously spread within a community and for which there is no related human pathogen providing cross-immunity, there will be no immune individuals within the population as a whole. If R 0 > 1, then the infection will propagate itself in the population and, if <1, the infection will become extinct in that community (Antia et al., 2003) . Anderson and Nokes (2004) define R 0 as the number of susceptibles present with which the primary case can come into contact, X multiplied by the length of time the primary case is infectious to others, which is the reciprocal of the recovery rate, multiplied by the transmission coefficient, b. In what follows, we will assume that the rate of host recovery is the same for each pathogen so that the transmission coefficient is, in effect, scaled to account for host recovery. This alleviates the need to introduce additional, possibly flawed, assumptions about the distribution of the recovery rate and its independence or otherwise of the transmission rate. Hence, the number of infections secondary to the index case is R 0 = bX.",

In this context, the exponential assumption has an additional desirable consequence. Multiplying b by a constant factor, c, to reflect the rate of contact results in an exponential random variable with parameter, ch and so the probability of an outbreak is Eq.
