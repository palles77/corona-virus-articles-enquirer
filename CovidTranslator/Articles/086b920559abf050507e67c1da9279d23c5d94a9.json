Globalisation of HIV/AIDS, of course, curbed such hubris, but medical and public health leaders, including the top tiers of WHO, viewed HIV as an exception to the rule. And as Michael Merson and Stephen Inrig detail in their agonising account The AIDS Pandemic: Searching for a Global Response, that notion of AIDS exceptionalism spawned an international non-response that allowed the virus to sweep across the world, becoming the third largest pandemic in human history.",

Today, health security and pandemic preparedness involve hundreds of organisations, initiatives, governing agencies, technologies, and businesses. Some of the efforts have already faltered, a few are promising. But all of humanity's attempts to forestall epidemics and bring speed and justice to global responses to outbreaks ultimately depend on a combination of political will, finances, biology, wisdom, and public health.",

            "text": "In his new book The End of Epidemics: the Looming Threat to Humanity and How to Stop It, Jonathan Quick, former President and CEO of Management Sciences for Health (MSH), rifles through the morass of preparedness and response initiatives and policy ideas that have arisen since 2014, synthesising a sevenpoint programme for epidemic prevention. MSH, a Boston-based health administration company, ranks in the top 30 of contractors that receive funds annually to implement US Government global health programmes, emphasising cost efficiency, linkages between public and private sectors, and accountable movement of finances. Outbreak mavens will find little in Quick's book to object to, as it presents a cogent summary of conventional wisdom on the topic. And because his background is in the management side of health, Quick offers a humane, readable, coherent analysis for would-be health leaders and disease responders, organised simultaneously as a handy reference tool for crisis response, and an outbreak explainer that in parts, thanks to assisting science writer Bronwyn Fryer, sizzles. Writing of the 1997 death of 3-year-old Lam Hoi-Ka from H5N1 influenza in Hong Kong, Quick and Fryer write, \"When Keiji Fukuda, an epidemiology expert at WHO, was asked what his first thought had been upon hearing the news that a brand new flu virus had killed a child, Fukuda replied that he remembered thinking, 'This is how it begins'.\"",

Although considered seasonal influenza, within 3 months of emergence it was on track to be the largest and deadliest influenza epidemic in the USA in at least a decade.

It's a health security framework that envisions investment in technological and medical methods for disease detection, prevention, control, and treatment, together with well funded systems of governance at all tiers of society.

The 2003 epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) spread in countries with strong UHC systems-Canada and Singapore-and in nations that as matters of national policy aspired to attain UHC, notably China and Hong Kong. Global spread of SARS and new strains of virulent influenza has had as much to do with national and international politics as the presence, or absence, of affordable health delivery systems. Even when political will is in place, as is the case with fighting the spread of antimicrobial resistance, the failure to concretely mobilise action and avert catastrophes is frustrating, aggravating, and omnipresent in all nations, with or without UHC and sophisticated medical delivery. The Zika virus emerged in Latin America's wealthiest nation, Brazil-a country that constitutionally guarantees UHC-in 2013, exploded in the country in 2015, and then spread across the Americas, eventually becoming an endemic, seasonal vector-borne agent throughout the region.",
