            "text": "With the ever-increasing awareness of the importance of protein glycosylation as a key player in inter-and intracellular communication, [1] [2] [3] [4] the need for powerful chemical tools to document sugar-protein cross-talk is rising. One reason for such interest in carbohydrate-protein interactions is their implication in the targeting of enveloped viruses such as HIV, influenza-, and coronavirus, 5, 6 an understanding of which will facilitate the design of carbohydrate-binding agents capable of neutralizing viral fusion and transmission. Different biophysical techniques have been used to monitor sugar-protein interactions, 7, 8 including NMR, X-ray crystallography, and more recently, surface plasmon resonance (SPR). The latter is fast gaining recognition because of its sensitivity, low sample consumption, and capability for real-time monitoring. In this technique, one of the two interacting entities (protein or sugar) is immobilized onto the surface of a sensor chip, the other one is flown across and the resulting read-out enables both quantitation and kinetic analysis of the interaction Among the two immobilization approaches possible, the sugar-on-chip option has demonstrable advantages 9,10 but requires a sugar in highly purified form and attached to the chip surface in a chemically well-defined manner. While the synthesis of complex carbohydrate structures is a fast expanding field, 11-15 the structural diversity encountered in nature cannot yet be fully met in the laboratory. Thus, some glycans (e.g., bacterial polysaccharide repeating units, elongated mucin-type glycans or complex N-glycans) cannot be efficiently produced for lack of suitable synthetic chemistries or glycosyltransferases/glycosidases, 16 and must be purified from natural sources. As the amount of material available is scarce, the immobilization chemistry to the sensor chip surface must be optimal to avoid losses of precious material. Although a direct aldehyde coupling has been described, 17 its efficiency is questionable.",
