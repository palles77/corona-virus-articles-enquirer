In less than a week, the explosive increase in the number of cases in several bordering regions and autonomous provinces of northern Italy placed enormous strain on the decentralized health system. Following an a dramatic spike in deaths from COVID-19, Italy transformed into a \"red zone\", and the movement restrictions were expanded to the entire country on the 8th of March. 25 All public gatherings were cancelled and school and university closures were extended through at least the next month.",

The first models mainly focused on the estimation of the basic reproduction number R 0 using dynamic mechanistic 35 mathematical models ( [3, 4, 5, 6] ), but also simple exponential growth models (see e.g. [7, 8] ). Compartmental epidemiological models like SIR, SIRD, SEIR and SEIRD have been proposed to estimate other important epidemiological parameters, such as the transmission rate and for forecasting purposes (see e.g. [6, 9] ). Other studies have used metapopulation models, which include data 40 of human mobility between cities and/or regions to forecast the evolution of the outbreak in other regions/countries far from the original epicenter in China [3, 10, 11, 5] , including the modelling of the influence of travel restrictions and other control measures in reducing the spread ( [12] .",

However, the incubation period does not 125 generally coincide with the time from exposure to the time that someone starts to be infectious. Regarding COVID-19, it has been suggested that an exposed person can be infectious well before the development of symptoms [15] . With respect to the incubation period for SARS-CoV-2, a study in China [16] suggests that it may range from 2-14 days, with a median of 5.2 days. Another study 130 in China, using data from 1,099 patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV ARD from 552 hospitals in 31 provinces/provincial municipalities suggested that the median incubation period is 4 days (interquartile range, 2 to 7). In our model, as explained above, 1 \u03c3 represents the period from exposure to the onset of the contagious period. Thus, based on the above clinical studies, for 135 our simulations, we have set 1 \u03c3 = 3. Regarding the recovery period, the WHO-China Joint Mission in a study that is based on 55,924 laboratory-confirmed cases has reported a median time of 2 weeks from onset to clinical recovery for mild cases, and 3-6 weeks for severe or critical cases [17] . Based on the above and on the fact that within the subset 140 of confirmed cases the mild cases are the 81% [14] , we have set the recovery period for the confirmed cases' compartment to be \u03b4 c = 1/21 in order to balance the recovery period with the corresponding characterization of the cases (mild, severe/critical).

Based on the above, the model yielded the following 310 numbers for the cumulative cases for March 19: \u2206E(t) = 112, 659, \u2206I(t) = 99, 951, \u2206I c (t) = 19, 327, R(t) = 55, 263, R c (t) = 4, 872, D(t) = 1, 770 (the reported confirmed cumulative numbers on March 16 were \u2206I c (t) = 19, 884, R c = 3, 778, D(t) = 2, 168). Thus, the model predicted fairly well the period from March 9 to March 19. 315 As discussed in the Methodology, we also attempted to forecast the evolution of the outbreak based on our analysis. To do so, we have considered a 90% reduction in the effective transmission rate starting on March 20, the day of announcement of even stricter measures in the region of Lombardy. The result of our forecast is depicted in Figure 5. As predicted by simulations, if the strict 320 isolation measures continue to hold, the outbreak in Lombardy is expected to fade out by the end of May, 2020 (lower and upper limits of the estimations are also shown).DiscussionThe crucial questions about an outbreak is how, when (DAY-ZERO), why it325 started, and when it will end. Answers to these important questions would add critical knowledge in our arsenal to combat the pandemic. The tracing of DAY-ZERO, in particular, is of outmost importance. It is well known that minor perturbations in the initial conditions of a complex system, such as the ones of an outbreak, may result in major changes in the observed dynamics. No doubt, 330 a high level of uncertainty for DAY-ZERO, as well as the uncertainty in the actual numbers of exposed people in the total population, raise several barriers in our ability to correctly assess the state and dynamics of the outbreak, Estimated number of the actual infected cases in the total population and the deaths at each day resulting from simulations from March 8 (the day of the lockdown of all Italy) to May 31 by considering a 80% reduction of the \"effective\" transmission rate until March 19 (based on the drop in the mobility in Lombardy as estimated by real-mobile phone data and the effect of social distancing) and then another 10% due to the even stricter measures for mobility announced by the government on March 20 and March 21. Dotted lines depict the upper and lower limits of the estimation.",

Such pieces of information would lower the barriers and help public health authorities respond fast and efficiently to the 335 emergency.This study aimed exactly at shedding more light into this problem, taking advantage of state-of-the-art tools of mathematical modelling and numerical analysis/optimization tools. To achieve this goal, we addressed a new compartmental SEIRD with two infectious compartments in order to bridge the gap340 between the number of reported cases and the actual number of cases in the total population. By following the proposed methodological framework, we found that the DAY-ZERO in Lombardy was the 21th of January, a date that precedes by one month the fate of the first confirmed case in the hardest-hit northern Italian 345 region of Lombardy. Furthermore, our analysis revealed that the actual cumulative number of infected cases in the total population in the period until March 8 was around 15 times the cumulative number of confirmed infected cases. Interestingly enough, regarding the estimation of the DAY-ZERO of the outbreak in Lombardy, a study posted in MedRxiv the same day as ours, reports the same 350 time period, between the second half of January and early February, 2020, as the time when the novel coronavirus entered Northern Italy, based on genomic and phylogenetic analyses [28]. Regarding the forecasting of the fade out of the pandemic in the region of Lombardy, in the first version of this manuscript that was submitted to 355 MedRxiv on March 17 and posted on March 20, we considered a 90% drop in the \"effective\" transmission rate as of March 8. This percentage is close enough to the drop that is estimated by real mobile data and studies quantifying the effect of social distancing and cautiousness (totaling 80%). In this current version, we updated our results by considering the new facts about the drop of human 360 mobility as announced on March 17 by the vice-president of the region and the new draconian measures announced on May 20-21 that include the closure of all parks, public and private offices and the prohibition of any pedestrian",

Here, we found an R 0 \u223c 4, which is similar to the values reported by many studies in China.
