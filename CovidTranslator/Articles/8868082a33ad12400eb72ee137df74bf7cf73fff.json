BUN was elevated in 27% overall and two thirds of patients who died. CT scan of the kidneys showed reduced density, suggestive of inflammation and edema. Cheng et al 13 recently reported that amongst 710 consecutive hospitalized patients with COVID-19, 44% had proteinuria and hematuria and 26.7% had hematuria on admission.

Other measures include prevention and treatment of complications by providing organ support, maintaining hemodynamic stability and prevention of secondary infection. Antiviral therapy There is no specific effective antiviral drug for COVID-19 at present. The guidelines of the Chinese National Health Commission recommend aerosolized inhalation of interferon\u03b1, and Lopinavir/Ritonavir. The specific therapeutic value and safety of Lopinavir/Ritonavir in COVID-19 patients is under investigation (ChiCTR2000029308) 20 . Successful treatment with remdesivir has been reported in a COVID-19 patient; a clinical trial on the efficacy of remdesivir in COVID-19 patients is currently underway in China (NCT0425266; NCT04257656)and is expected to be completed in April 2020. Chloroquine phosphate has been shown to have some efficacy against COVID-19 associated pneumonia in multicenter clinical trials conducted in China. 21 Extracorporeal treatments CRRT has been successfully applied in the treatment of SARS, MERS and sepsis 22,23 . Highvolume hemofiltration (HVHF) in a dose of 6L/hr removed inflammatory cytokines (IL-6) and improved the SOFA (Sequential Organ Failure Assessment) scores at day 7 in patients with sepsis 24 . Therefore, CRRT may play a role in patients with COVID-19 and sepsis syndrome. The potential role of extracorporeal therapy techniques needs to be evaluated, however. Glucocorticoids In a retrospective study of patients with SARS-CoV and sepsis, steroids, in a mean daily dose of 105.3 +/-86.1 mg in 147 of 249 noncritical patients (59.0%) reduced mortality and shortened duration of hospitalization, while 121 of 152 critical patients (79.6%) received corticosteroids at a mean daily dose of 133.5 +/-102.3 mg, and 25 died 25 . A subsequent retrospective observational study of 309 MERS patients showed that those who received high dose steroids were more likely to require mechanical ventilation, vasopressors and RRT 26 . In a metanalaysis of corticosteroid use in SARS patients, 4 studies provided conclusive evidence of harm (psychosis, diabetes, avascular necrosis and delayed viral clearance) 27 . Therefore, the use of steroids is controversial and not recommended by WHO due to potential inhibition of viral clearance and prolongation of the duration of viremia 28 . Convalescent plasma Preliminary clinical studies in China have shown that early application of convalescent plasma in patients with COVID-19 could accelerate clinical recovery 6 . Currently two trials: an open-label, non-randomized clinical trial (NCT04264858) and a multicenter, randomized and parallel controlled trial (ChiCTR2000029757) on the efficacy of convalescent plasma in patients with COVID-19 are underway in China.",

            "text": "Pregnant women, newborn and the elderly, and patients with comorbidities like diabetes mellitus, hypertension, cardiovascular disease are susceptible to COVID-19 infection and likely to have more severe illness often requiring ICU care. The impact of COVID-19 on CKD has not been reported 30 . COVID-19 infection presents a special threat to patients on dialysis. There are 7184 hemodialysis (HD) patients in 61 treatment centers in Wuhan city. At a single HD center in Renmin Hospital, Wuhan University, 37 HD out of 230 HD patients, and 4 of 33 staff members developed COVID-19 infection between 14 January and 17 February 2020 30 . A total of 7 patients on HD died, of whom 6 had COVID-19 infection. HD patients with COVID-19 had less lymphopenia, lower serum levels of inflammatory cytokines and milder clinical disease than other patients with COVID-19 infection. Management of patients on dialysis COVID-19 infection presents particular challenges for patients on dialysis, in particular, in center hemodialysis. Uremic patients are particularly vulnerable to infection and may exhibit greater variations in clinical symptoms and infectivity. In center HD significantly increases the risk of transmission of infection, including to medical staff and facility workers, patients themselves and family members, and all others. The Chinese Society of Nephrology 31 and the Taiwan Society of Nephrology 32 have recently developed guidelines for dialysis units during the COVID-19 outbreak. A summary of these guidelines is provided below: 1. A working team consisting of dialysis physicians, nursing staff and technologists should receive training in updated clinical knowledge of epidemic COVID-19, notification of infection at risk, epidemic prevention tools, and guidelines from the government, academic society, and hospital authority. The list of staff should be recorded and be retained by dialysis hospitals. 2. Information on travel, occupation, contacts, and clusters history (TOCC) of each medical staff, dialysis patient, their family members, residents of the same institution, and colleagues at work should be collected and updated regularly. 3. Latest care recommendations and epidemic information should be updated and delivered to all medical care personnel as needed. Training can be done peer to peer or online. 4. Group activities, including group rounds, group studies, and case discussions should be minimized. 5. It is recommended that staff members have meals at different time to avoid dining together. Goggles, masks, and hats should be removed before meals, and hands washed with flowing water. Talking during meals should be minimized to reduce the spread of droplets. 6. Staff should self-monitor their symptoms and should inform the team leader in case they or their family members develop symptom(s) suggestive of COVID-19 infection. 7. Entrance control, identification and shunting of people at risk of infection, body temperature measurement, hand washing, wearing proper (surgical or N95) masks throughout the process, machine disinfection, environmental cleanliness, good air conditioning and ventilation conditions, should be instituted. 8. Patients and accompanying persons should be given hands-free hand sanitizer while entering the dialysis room. Patients should wear medical masks and avoid meals during dialysis. They can bring convenience food such as candy to prevent hypoglycemia. 9. Patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 infection should be admitted to negative pressure isolation ward of specified hospitals. If the capacity of the isolation facility is overloaded, the \"Fixed Dialysis Care Model\" as below is recommended for dialysis patients under the 14-day period of quarantine for possible contact with COVID-19. 10. Place of dialysis treatment: patients should continue hemodialysis at the original hemodialysis center and not change to another center. 11. Dialysis shift and personnel: Do not change dialysis shifts and caregiver staff to avoid cross contamination and infection. Minimize the relevant contacts. 12. Patients who need vascular access surgery should be screened for novel coronavirus before the surgery. Operations on patients with confirmed or suspected novel coronavirus infection should be carried out in a designated room with necessary protection for medical staff. 13. Transportation: Public transport should not be used. Patients should arrange personal transportation and take fixed transportation routes. Transport personnel and escorts should wear surgical grade or N95 masks throughout. 14. All patients who have fever should be screened for novel coronavirus infection, and should be given dialysis in the last shift of the day until infection is excluded. 15. Pass route for entering hospital and dialysis unit: The pick-up and drop-off should not be shared with other dialysis patients. Entering and exiting with other patients at the same time should be avoided. The route, mode and time of transport of dialysis personnel should be fixed. 16. Precautions in dialysis unit: Patients should not be in close proximity; treatment and waiting areas should have good air conditioning and ventilation to remove droplet particles from the air.",
