The murine coronavirus, mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), causes acute hepatitis in its natural host and provides a useful model for understanding virus interaction with liver cells. The MHV accessory protein, ns2, antagonizes the type I interferon response and promotes hepatitis. We show that ns2 has 2 0 ,5 0 -phosphodiesterase activity, which blocks the interferon inducible 2 0 ,5 0 -oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS)-RNase L pathway to facilitate hepatitis development. Ns2 cleaves 2 0 ,5 0 -oligoadenylate, the product of OAS, to prevent activation of the cellular endoribonuclease RNase L and consequently block viral RNA degradation. An ns2 mutant virus was unable to replicate in the liver or induce hepatitis in wild-type mice, but was highly pathogenic in RNase L deficient mice. Thus, RNase L is a critical cellular factor for protection against viral infection of the liver and the resulting hepatitis.",

            "text": "Many viral infections induce acute and/or chronic liver pathology in humans, for which there are often no known effective therapies or vaccines. There is little known about the early virus-host interactions that determine whether an infection is established, highlighting the need to understand mechanisms regulating the pathogenesis of viral hepatitis. The liver is constantly exposed to intestinal derived antigens present in the blood circulating through the liver sinusoids and, therefore, has evolved a unique immune environment that is relatively tolerant to foreign antigens and permissive to chronic infections (Crispe, 2009; Neumann-Haefelin et al., 2007) . Thus, the innate immune response is a particularly important defense against pathogen invasion of the liver. Type I interferon (IFN) is the first line of defense available to restrict viral infection including infections with human hepatitis viruses (Garc\u00eda-Sastre and Biron, 2006; Qu and Lemon, 2010) . Kupffer cells (liver macrophages) found in the liver sinusoids are among the first cells to encounter viruses and as such, along with endothelial cells present a barrier that must be breached in order to access hepatocytes in the liver parenchyma (Crispe, 2009) . Indeed, it has been reported that IFN signaling in macrophages is crucial for control of hepatitis induced by mouse hepatitis virus (Cervantes-Barrag\u00e1 n et al., 2009 ) and lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (Lang et al., 2010) .",

            "text": "Type I IFN, primarily IFN-a/b, produced by virus-infected cells, induces expression of over four hundred interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), whose products cooperate to induce an antiviral state. One potent antiviral IFN induced activity is the 2 0 ,5 0 -oligoadenylate synthetase-ribonuclease L (OAS-RNase L) pathway (Sadler and Williams, 2008) (Figure 1 ). After infection, IFNs induce a group of OAS genes whose products are activated by viral double-stranded RNA (dsRNA). OAS uses ATP to generate the 2 0 ,5 0 -linked oligoadenylates with the structures [p x 5 0 A(2 0 p5 0 A) n ; x = 1-3; n R 2 (2-5A)]. 2-5A binds to the ubiquitous cellular endoribonuclease RNase L, causing inactive RNase L monomers to form activated dimers (Dong and Silverman, 1995) . RNase L cleaves single-stranded regions of both viral and cellular messenger RNA (mRNA), leading to inhibition of viral replication and protein synthesis (Silverman, 2007) . In addition, detection of the newly generated short RNAs by cellular pattern recognition receptors, MDA5 and RIG-I, further enhances IFN production and the ensuing antiviral activities (Malathi et al., 2007) . The concentration of 2-5A is believed to be the primary factor controlling RNase L activation. The cellular enzyme 2 0 -phosphodiesterase (2 0 -PDE, also known as PDE12) has been proposed to reduce or prevent 2-5A-mediated activation of RNase L by degrading 2-5A, presumably to prevent excessive tissue damage caused by the effects of RNase L (Kubota et al., 2004) . The antiviral activity of the OAS-RNase L pathway has been demonstrated during infections of mice with numerous RNA and DNA viruses (Flodstr\u00f6 m-Tullberg et al., 2005; Li et al., 1998; Samuel et al., 2006; Scherbik et al., 2006; Washenberger et al., 2007; Xiang et al., 2002; Zhou et al., 1997) .",

Previous studies using reverse genetics and MHV strains with different tropisms demonstrated that events that occur after viral entry play a crucial role in the likelihood of liver invasion and the development of hepatitis (Navas and Weiss, 2003) . Indeed, we recently reported that MHV accessory protein ns2 confers the ability to antagonize the type I IFN antiviral response in macrophages and that this is required for efficient viral replication in the liver and the development of hepatitis (Zhao et al., 2011) . Based on sequence homology to cellular phosphodiesterases, ns2 had been predicted to be a cyclic phosphodiesterase (Mazumder et al., 2002; Snijder et al., 2003) . We show here that ns2 has in fact a 2 0 ,5 0 -phosphodiesterase activity that can downregulate intracellular levels of 2-5A, thereby preventing the activation and antiviral activity of RNase L. Our results underscore the importance of the OAS-RNase L pathway in vivo for protection of the host from developing viral hepatitis.",

            "text": "Resists RNase L Activity MHV differs from many other viruses in that it stimulates type I IFN production in only limited cell types, primarily in macrophages (Roth-Cross et al., 2008) and plasmacytoid dendritic cells (Cervantes-Barragan et al., 2007) . Furthermore MHV displays cell type-specific sensitivity to the antiviral effects of IFN treatment, with macrophage lineage cells being most successful in restricting MHV replication (Rose and Weiss, 2009; Zhao et al., 2011) . We also observed that MHV was unable to prevent IFN induction by a coinfecting virus and was also unable to protect a coinfecting virus from the effects of IFN (Roth-Cross et al., 2007) . Thus, we reasoned that MHV is unable to subvert major IFN signaling pathways, but rather may interfere with one or more IFN-induced antiviral activities. Indeed, a previous study showed that MHV-A59 infection does not promote RNase L-mediated degradation of 18S and 28S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) in HeLa cells (Ye et al., 2007) , suggesting that the OAS-RNase L pathway may be downregulated. To more directly evaluate the role of RNase L in MHV replication, we compared the replication of wild-type A59 in bone-marrow derived macrophages (BMMs) from wild-type C57BL/6 (B6) mice or from mice genetically ablated for RNase L expression [RNase L \u00c0/\u00c0 (B6)]. The kinetics of accumulation of A59 genome RNA were indistinguishable in the two cell types (Figure 2A) , as was the extent of infectious virus replication ( Figure 2D ). In contrast, the genome RNA levels of Sendai virus (SeV) and encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) were approximately 16-fold and 64-fold higher at 12 hr after infection in BMMs derived from RNase L \u00c0/\u00c0 mice, compared with B6 ( Figures 2B  and 2C , respectively). These results indicate that RNase L activity restricts the replication of both SeV and EMCV but not that of MHV A59. After infection, viral RNA is detected by pattern recognition receptors RIG-I and MDA5, resulting in the induction of IFN-a/b, which in turn induces ISGs, including OAS. OAS is activated by dsRNA to produce 2-5A, which activates RNase L. RNase L degrades cellular and viral RNA producing more RNA that is recognized by MDA5 and RIG-I, resulting in enhanced IFN induction. 2 0 -PDE cleaves 2-5A and inhibits the activation of RNase L. MHV ns2, like the cellular enzyme 2 0 -PDE, is a 2 0 ,5 0 -phosphodiesterase. OAS, 2 0 -5 0 -oligoadenylate synthetase; 2-5A, 2 0 ,5 0 oligoadenylate; 2 0 -PDE, 2 0 -phosphodiesterase. Table S1 .",

Furthermore the A59 mutant virus, ns2-H126R, carrying a single amino acid substitution in a predicted phosphodiesterase catalytic His residue (Mazumder et al., 2002; Roth-Cross et al., 2009; Snijder et al., 2003) , is attenuated for replication in macrophages (Zhao et al., 2011) . Thus, we hypothesized that ns2 could protect the viral genome RNA from RNase L-mediated degradation through its phosphodiesterase activity, which might cleave 2-5A, thereby reducing the level of inducer of RNase L activity. To test this hypothesis, we first compared the replication kinetics of A59 and ns2-H126R in BMMs derived from B6 and RNase L \u00c0/\u00c0 mice. Along with robust replication of A59 in B6 BMMs ( Figure 3A ), we observed extensive lysis of most of the cells by 48 hr postinfection (p.i.), while most of ns2-H126R-infected BMMs remained intact ( Figure 3C ). The few cells left intact after A59 infection expressed viral antigen, while there were small numbers of cells expressing viral antigen after ns2-H126R infection. In contrast, in RNase L \u00c0/\u00c0 BMMs, ns2-H126R recovered the ability to replicate efficiently, with similar kinetics ( Figure 3A ) and induced similar wide spread cell lysis as A59 ( Figure 3C ). Similar results were obtained for two other mutants carrying single amino acid substitutions in ns2, H46A, and L94P ( Figure S1 available online). These data suggest that ns2 confers the ability to antagonize the antiviral activities of RNase L.",

A59 replicated to 10-fold higher titer in PKR \u00c0/\u00c0 as compared to B6 BMMs, indicating that MHV is sensitive to the antiviral effects of PKR. However, the replication kinetics of ns2-H126R in PKR \u00c0/\u00c0 BMMs were the same as in B6 BMMs ( Figure 3B ), indicating that ns2 does not antagonize PKR, but rather specifically inhibits the OAS-RNase L pathway.

In both B6 and RNase L \u00c0/\u00c0 BMMs, the concentration of 2-5A in ns2-H126Rinfected cells was significantly higher than that in A59-infected cells. It should be noted that the 2-5A concentration in RNase L \u00c0/\u00c0 BMMs, as measured by activation of RNase L in a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based assay (see the Experimental Procedures) after infection with either viral strain was much lower than that in virus-infected B6 BMMs ( Figure 4D ), probably because induction of optimal OAS levels is dependent on an active OAS-RNase L pathway (Malathi et al., 2007) .",

Since ns2 was predicted to have phosphodiesterase activity, we hypothesized that ns2 could display a similar enzymatic activity to 2 0 -PDE and directly cleave 2-5A, thus reducing the activation of RNase L. To test this hypothesis, we expressed ns2, ns2-H126R, and murine 2 0 -PDE in E. coli and purified the recombinant proteins as described in the Supplemental Experimental Procedures.

            "text": "Our previous studies demonstrated that after intrahepatic (IH) inoculation of A59, viral replication is robust in the liver by 3 days postinfection (d.p.i.), peaks at 5 d.p.i., and is mostly cleared by 7 d.p.i. (Navas et al., 2001; Roth-Cross et al., 2009) . In contrast, ns2-H126R replicates minimally in the liver (Roth-Cross et al., 2009; Zhao et al., 2011) . However, in mice depleted of macrophages prior to infection, ns2-H126R replication and induction of hepatitis were significantly enhanced, approaching that of A59 (Zhao et al., 2011) . Taking these in vivo data in combination with the finding that ns2-H126R replicates minimally in B6 BMMs ( Figure 3A ) (Zhao et al., 2011) , we speculated that the ability to replicate in Kupffer cells (liver macrophages) was a prerequisite for spread of virus into the liver parenchyma and for the consequent development of hepatitis. Since ns2-H126 recovers the ability to replicate in RNase L \u00c0/\u00c0 BMMs ( Figure 3A ), we predicted that the ns2 mutant virus would also replicate and spread in the absence of RNase L activity in vivo. For testing of this hypothesis, both B6 and RNase L \u00c0/\u00c0 mice were inoculated IH with 200 PFU of either A59 or ns2-H126R and virus titers in the liver were quantified. In B6 mice, A59 replicated to high titers peaking at 5 d.p.i., whereas ns2-H126R replicated near the limit of detection. In contrast, in RNase L \u00c0/\u00c0 mice, ns2-H126R reached titers, comparable to those attained by A59 ( Figure 6A ), reflecting that wild-type ns2 expression is not necessary for efficient replication in the absence of RNase L expression. Notably, there was no significant difference in A59 titers between livers from B6 mice and RNase L \u00c0/\u00c0 mice, indicating that ns2 is efficient at antagonizing RNase L activation in B6 mice. Surprisingly, however, by 7 d.p.i., there were striking differences in viral clearance between B6 and RNase L \u00c0/\u00c0 mice. While both viruses were nearly cleared from the liver of B6 mice at 7 d.p.i., there were still considerable titers of both A59 and ns2-H126R in the livers of RNase L \u00c0/\u00c0 mice ( Figure 6A ).",

Though not statistically significant, the low, but detectable titers of virus at 7 d.p.i. in the spleen, lung, and kidney of RNase L \u00c0/\u00c0 mice were all higher than in B6 mice, perhaps resulting from the delayed clearance in the liver.",

MHV and other closely related (A) Four-week-old B6 or RNase L \u00c0/\u00c0 mice were inoculated intrahepatically with A59 or ns2-H126R (200 PFU/mouse). At 3, 5, and 7 d.p.i., organs were harvested and homogenized, and virus titers were determined. The dashed line represents the limit of detection and the error bars represent the SEM (n = 5). Asterisks indicate that differences are statistically significant (*p < 0.05 and ***p < 0.001). betacoronaviruses (de Groot et al., 2012) encode ns2 proteins that together with related proteins of toroviruses and human rotavirus form a protein family (known also as LigT-like or family II) with cellular proteins of diverse origins, some of which possess cyclophosphodiesterase (CPD) activity. The family is part of a larger superfamily of 2H phosphodiesterases characterized by the presence of a pair of conserved His-x-Thr/Ser motifs (Mazumder et al., 2002; Snijder et al., 2003) . We were unable to demonstrate that ns2 has a CPD activity using as substrates 2 0 ,3 0 cAMP, 3 0 ,5 0 cAMP, and ADP-ribose 1 00 ,2 00 cyclic phosphate (unpublished data), but instead found that ns2 is a 2 0 ,5 0 -phosphodiesterase cleaving, and thus eliminating, 2-5A, the activator of RNase L. In this respect, ns2 resembles the E. coli 2 0 -5 0 -RNA ligase, also within the 2H phosphodiesterase superfamily, which can ligate 2 0 ,5 0 linkages of the noncognate tRNA splicing intermediates and is also able to carry out the reverse 2 0 ,5 0 -phosphodiesterase reaction in vitro (Arn and Abelson, 1996) . Before this study, 2 0 -PDE (PDE12) of the different exonuclease-endonuclease-phosphatase family (Goldstrohm and Wickens, 2008) was the only mammalian enzyme known that cleaves the 2 0 ,5 0 bond in 2-5A. Accordingly it was proposed to be a key regulator of the OAS/RNase L system (Kubota et al., 2004) . Thus, two proteins, 2 0 -PDE and ns2, both of which can cleave 2-5A, evolved independently. It remains to be seen whether other incompletely characterized homologs of ns2 of the viral and cellular origins have similar substrate specificity.",

Thus, the susceptibility to RNase L in vitro and in mice varies among viruses and cell types (Silverman, 2007; Zhou et al., 1997) . HIV (Martinand et al., 1999) and EMCV (Martinand et al., 1998) induce expression of an RNase L inhibitor protein, RLI (a.k.a. ABCE1). However, RLI is apparently less efficient than ns2 in the control of RNase L activity during EMCV infections (Figure 2) . The group C enterovirus genome contains a conserved RNA structure that inhibits the activity of RNase L (Townsend et al., 2008) . Herpes simplex virus I (Cayley et al., 1984) and SV40 (Hersh et al., 1984) induce synthesis of 2-5A derivatives that antagonize or fail to activate RNase L. Vaccinia E3L protein antagonizes OAS by reducing the level of dsRNA available and successfully escapes the effects of RNase L (Xiang et al., 2002) . Based on the finding that the A59 nucleocapsid (N) protein could functionally replace the E3L protein in rescuing vaccinia virus DE3L from the antiviral effects of IFN it was suggested that N could also bind dsRNA, thus interfering with the activation of OAS (Ye et al., 2007) . However, expression of N protein, in the context of MHV infection, is clearly not potent enough to shut down OAS-RNase L pathway as ns2-H126R induces RNase L-mediated cleavage of rRNA in BMMs (Figure 4A ). In contrast, rRNA cleavage was not detectable in A59 infected BMMs, providing further evidence that ns2 is a potent antagonist of the OAS-RNase L pathway. The comparable level of A59 replication in B6 and RNase L \u00c0/\u00c0 BMMs and in the infected liver at least through 5 d.p.i. suggests that ns2 is able to completely antagonize RNase L activity, although there may be cell types in which this is not complete. Our findings demonstrate a mechanism by which the OAS-RNase L pathway can be antagonized, that is by blocking the activation of RNase L through the ns2-mediated cleavage of 2-5A.",

One possible reason for the delay in clearance is that RNase L \u00c0/\u00c0 mice have lower levels of apoptosis and in addition are relatively resistant to apoptosis, resulting in increased numbers of cells in the thymus and spleen (Zhou et al., 1997) . Indeed, we observed increased virus titers in the spleen of infected RNase L \u00c0/\u00c0 mice compared to B6 mice even at 3 d.p.i. (Figure 6A ). This could potentially confer defects in adaptive immune responses; the T cell response, responsible for viral clearance, peaks at 7 d.p.i., the time at which differences in RNase L \u00c0/\u00c0 and B6 mice infections are detectable. RNase L \u00c0/\u00c0 mice were, however, eventually able to clear virus; there was no detectable infectious virus, viral RNA, N protein or pathology in the liver by 30 d.p.i. (Figure S3B ). The requirement for basal RNase L activity in the timely clearance of MHV is under investigation.",

This correlates with basal levels of ISGs and MHV-induced IFN production, which differs among cell types, with the highest expression in macrophages (Ida-Hosonuma et al., 2005; Zhou et al., 1997). Accordingly, we found that the basal levels of (C) Livers were harvested from mock-or virus-infected mice (n = 5) at 3, 5, and 7 d.p.i., and RNA was isolated. TNF-a and IFN-g mRNAs were quantified by qRT-PCR, normalized to b-actin mRNA level, and expressed as the fold change relative to mock infected with the formula 2 \u00c0D [DCT] .The error bars represents the SEM. Asterisks indicate that differences are statistically significant (*p < 0.05). See also Table S1. expression of mRNAs for genes encoding active OAS proteins (Kakuta et al., 2002) , OAS1a, OAS2, and OAS3, were also higher in macrophages as compared with primary hepatocytes (data not shown) (Asada- Kubota et al., 1998) . We hypothesize that Kupffer cells serve as a gateway to restrict entrance from the sinusoids into the liver parenchyma. Indeed, it has been reported that IFN signaling in macrophages is crucial for control of hepatitis induced by MHV (Cervantes-Barrag\u00e1 n et al., 2009) as well as by LCMV (Lang et al., 2010) . We propose that upon infection of Kupffer cells, the IFN response, most importantly the OAS-RNaseL pathway, creates an antiviral state restricting infection and limiting spread of virus to the parenchymal hepatocytes, thus preventing hepatitis. However, ns2 facilitates viral replication in Kupffer cells by antagonizing the OAS-RNase L pathway, thus downregulating the IFN response and enhancing entry into the liver parenchyma. Depletion of macrophages confers susceptibility to ns2-H126R as well as increased susceptibility to A59 (Zhao et al., 2011) , supporting the notion that the Kupffer cells provide protection against invasion of the liver parenchyma.",

However, we found that clearance is delayed in the brains (data not shown) as in the livers ( Figure 6A ) of RNase L \u00c0/\u00c0 mice. Similarly, the MHV-JHM v-2.2 variant replicated to a similar titer in the CNS during acute infection of B6 and RNaseL \u00c0/\u00c0 mice; however, v-2.2 spread into microglia/macrophages within the gray matter of the spinal cord and induced more demyelination in RNase L \u00c0/\u00c0 mice than in B6 mice (Ireland et al., 2009) . (While there are no published data on ns2 expression by v-2.2, it is very likely to express an active ns2 as the closely related JHM.SD encodes an ns2 capable of inhibiting RNase L in vitro [data not shown].) These findings support our previous conclusion that the requirement for ns2 expression for MHV virulence is organ specific (Zhao et al., 2011) ; they also show that basal levels of RNase L expression are required for efficient MHV clearance in the brain as well as the liver ( Figure 6 ).",

            "text": "Our results underscore the important role of RNase L in host restriction of viral infection of the liver. The success of IFN-a treatment of chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) may depend in part on the susceptibility of viral RNA genome to degradation by RNase L, which cleaves single-stranded viral RNA on the 3 0 sides of UU and UA dinucleotides. Cleavage of HCV genome RNA by RNase L releases a small RNA that is recognized by RIG-I and thus serves to enhance IFN induction (Malathi et al., 2010) . Indeed, the strains of HCV that are most susceptible to IFN-a treatment are those strains with genomes predicted to be most vulnerable to RNase L-mediated degradation (Han et al., 2004; Washenberger et al., 2007) . Thus, enhancement of the activity of the OAS-RNase L pathway may have potential for antiviral therapy for liver infections. A possible approach to enhancing RNase L mediated viral RNA genome degradation might be to limit activities of enzymes that degrade 2-5A; treatment with an inhibitor for 2 0 -PDE was shown to decrease vaccinia virus replication in vitro (Kubota et al., 2004) . In this regard, inhibitors of virusencoded phosphodiesterases that degrade 2 0 ,5 0 -oligoadenylates could provide an avenue for development of targeted antiviral drugs.",
