A limited number of human H5N1 infections have been reported from Vietnam and Thailand, with a mortality rate approaching 70%. Deaths have occurred in otherwise healthy young individuals, which is reminiscent of the 1918 Spanish influenza pandemic. The main presenting features were fever, pneumonitis, lymphopenia, and diarrhea. Notably, sore throat, conjunctivitis, and coryza were absent. The H5N1 strains are resistant to amantadine and rimantadine but are susceptible to neu-raminidase inhibitors, which can be used for treatment and prophylaxis. The widespread epidemic of avian influenza in domestic birds increases the likelihood for mutational events and genetic reassortment. The threat of a future pandemic from avian influenza is real. Adequate surveillance, development of vaccines, outbreak preparedness, and pandemic influenza planning are important. This article summarizes the current knowledge on avian influenza, including the virology, epidemiology, diagnosis, and management of this emerging disease.",

This is the largest outbreak of avian influenza in poultry ever described. Most of these countries experienced outbreaks of avian influenza for the first time. During the past 3 months, more than 100 million domestic poultry have died, or they have been culled to contain the epidemic and prevent the potential transmission to humans. Despite the widespread infection of avian influenza viruses among poultry in Asia, reported infection in humans has been rare to date. As of , only Vietnam and Thailand have reported influenza H5N1 infection in humans. Thirty-two human cases were laboratory confirmed, resulting in 22 deaths, a mortality rate approaching 70%. 1 However, most of the affected countries have limited capacity for surveillance of human disease. In addition, poultry production contributes substantially to the economies of the affected countries, resulting in considerable political pressure to minimize the extent and seriousness of the epidemic. Therefore, the reported human cases of avian influenza may be underestimated.",

Two of the 3 key criteria that characterized the pandemic of 1918-1919 have already been fulfilled in the current epidemic: (1) the ability of the virus to infect humans resulting in high mortality and (2) a global immunologically naive human population. 3 The third criterion, efficient human-to-human transmission, has thus far not been observed. 4 The adaptation that would result in human-to-human transmission might involve changes in the receptor properties or improved viral replication efficiency. This adaptation might be achieved by mutation of an avian virus genome or by mixing segments of an avian virus with segments from a virus already adapted to humans (genetic reassortment), leading to the emergence of a new influenza subtype with pandemic potential. 5 Both events may occur easily. First, influenza viruses mutate frequently, potentially allowing them to change the host receptor specificity from avian to human. 6 Second, the segmented viral genome allows the exchange of genes between viruses if they infect the same host cell, which serves as the \"mixing vessel.\" 7 In the current H5N1 outbreak in Asia, no genetic reassortment among avian and human influenza viruses has been found; all genes are of avian origin. 4, 8 However, the widespread epidemic of avian influenza in domestic birds increases the likelihood for mutational events and genetic reassortment. In view of the high mortality observed in the limited number of infections in humans, the prospect of a severe pandemic is of considerable importance. 9 We review current knowledge about avian influenza, including the virology, epidemiology, diagnosis, and management of this emerging disease.",

A key difference among influenza virus types is their host range. 10 Type A viruses have been isolated from a wide range of species, including humans, pigs, horses, seals, ferrets, mink, whales, and birds. Types B and C viruses infect humans predominantly but have also been isolated from seals and pigs, respectively. 7 Influenza A viruses can be divided into subtypes based on surface glycoproteins, hemagglutinin and neuraminidase. To date, 15 different hemagglutinin (H1-H15) and 9 neuraminidase (N1-N9) proteins have been identified. 10 Hemagglutinin facilitates entry of the virus into host cells through its attachment to sialic acid on epithelial cell receptors, promotes membrane fusion, and elicits protective neutralizing antibody response. Hemagglutinin is the crucial component of influenza vaccines. Neuraminidase has enzyme activity, which cleaves sialic acid on virion proteins, facilitating the release of progeny virions from infected cells. It is an important target for antiviral agents. 11 Although all influenza A virus subtypes have been found in birds, only 3 different hemagglutinin (H1, H2, or H3) and 2 different neuraminidase (N1 or N2) proteins have circulated widely in humans.",

During antigenic drift, mutations occur because of the lack of the proofreading activity of viral RNA polymerases. As a consequence, new antigenic variants emerge constantly, allowing the virus to evade immune recognition and giving rise to annual epidemics. The antigenic drift of influenza viruses requires the replacement of influenza strains used in the vaccine every several years. 12 During antigenic shift, new strains appear to which most humans have no immunity and that have the potential to cause severe global outbreaks of human influenza. These pandemic strains derive from nonhuman viruses by interspecies transmission of the whole virus or by genetic reassortment between avian and human viruses that have infected a single cell. Pigs have receptors for both avian and human influenza viruses and have been considered an intermediate host for the reassortment of influenza viruses. Reemergence of a previously circulating virus to which most of the population is immunologically naive is another mechanism by which pandemic strains can occur. 13 The nomenclature of influenza viruses includes the type of virus (A, B, or C), host of origin (excluding humans), geographical site of origin, strain number, and year of isolation, followed in parentheses by the antigenic description of the hemagglutinin and neuraminidase glycoproteins, eg, A/chicken/Hong Kong/258/97 (H5N1).",

The predominance of these receptors in different tissues partly reflects the tropism of influenza in different species. 5 Receptor specificity and inability of efficient replication in vivo were believed to provide a barrier against human infection by avian influenza virus. High doses of avian influenza virus strains were required for replication in volunteers. The first human infections by avian H5N1 virus in Hong Kong in 1997 showed that receptor specificity was not a definitive host restriction factor. 14 In this epidemic, an intermediate host was not necessary for transmission of avian strains to humans.",

In 1995, 178 turkey farms in Minnesota were affected by influenza virus H9N2, resulting in an economic loss of approximately $6 million. 15 Moreover, avian influenza viruses of low pathogenicity can mutate into highly pathogenic viruses after circulating for several months. During the 1999-2001 epidemic in Italy, the H7N1 virus mutated within 9 months to a highly pathogenic form, and more than 13 million birds died or were culled. 1 Since 1997, outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza have increased in frequency and severity, and the number of novel strains suggests that the next influenza pandemic is imminent. 9 In 2004, outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza occurred among chickens at farms in Delaware, Pennsylvania, Texas, and Maryland. The diseased and exposed birds were killed, and a quarantine zone was implemented around the affected farms. On February 20, 2004, H5N1 infection was confirmed in 2 dead domestic cats and in a tiger in a zoo in Thailand. To date, these animals have not been considered susceptible to influenza viruses. This raises concern about the need for surveillance in animals other than birds. 1",

These permanent live animal markets (wet markets) are embedded strongly in the food culture of Asian countries. Close human contact with live animals provides an ideal environment for the zoonotic transfer and evolution of infectious disease agents. 17 The most important control measure for containing the outbreak in Hong Kong in 1997 was rapid destruction of the entire poultry population, proper disposal of carcasses, and rigorous disinfection of farms. To reduce the risk of reemergence of avian influenza, all aquatic birds were removed from retail markets, including ducks, geese, and quails (source of the H5N1 strain). Monthly \"clean days\" were introduced when all markets are emptied and cleaned simultaneously. New regulations mandate quarantine of poultry in designated farms in mainland China for 5 days and testing for H5 infection before importation to Hong Kong. 18 Other control measures include continuous surveillance of influenza virus strains in humans and in birds, careful protection of cullers through appropriate personal protective equipment, restrictions on the movement of live poultry, and use of the human influenza vaccine to reduce the risk of coinfection in poultry workers and cullers. 4",

This figure is at least double the number of soldiers killed on the battlefields of Europe during World War I. Other less catastrophic pandemics occurred in 1957 (Asian influenza), 1968 (Hong Kong influenza), and 1977 (Russian influenza). The Asian (H2N2) and Hong Kong (H3N2) pandemic strains were generated by reassortment between human and avian viral genes. The Russian influenza virus (H1N1) circulated in the 1950s and reemerged in 1977. The illness occurred almost exclusively among persons younger than 20 years. The relatively low mortality rate associated with this pandemic can be attributed to the immunity of older individuals who had antibodies from their previous exposure to nearly identical viruses. 7",

In 1997, the first documented direct transmission of an avian influenza virus to humans occurred in Hong Kong, when an H5N1 strain caused a severe respiratory disease in 18 previously healthy young adults, 6 of whom died. 3 The outbreak in Hong Kong was controlled by the destruction of the entire poultry population; within 3 days, more than 1.5 million chickens were killed. In 1999, avian influenza H9N2 viruses were isolated for the first time in humans; 2 children were hospitalized with uncomplicated upper respiratory tract infection in Hong Kong, and both recovered completely. 19 In May 2001 and in February and April 2002, the poultry stocks in Hong Kong were again destroyed when the highly pathogenic H5N1 virus reemerged in flocks. However, no more human cases of H5N1 influenza were identified until February 2003, when 2 cases were confirmed in 2 Hong Kong residents after travel to China, 1 of whom died. 19 In February 2003, a large outbreak of H7N7 avian influenza occurred in poultry farms in the Netherlands. 20 The virus caused mild illness in several farm workers, but a veterinarian who had visited an affected farm died of pneumonia. The virus isolated from the fatal case displayed 14 amino acid substitutions, which possibly contributed to the increased disease severity. All farm workers received mandatory influenza vaccination and prophylaxis with oseltamivir. 21 The H7N7 poultry outbreak subsequently spread to Germany and Belgium but was eventually controlled by destruction of more than 30 million domestic poultry. In February 2004, another outbreak of H7N7 avian influenza occurred on a poultry farm in British Columbia, Canada, and resulted in at least 5 humans with infection, mainly conjunctivitis. 1 Recently, the crystal structure of the hemagglutinin from the 1918 virus was determined, explaining why this virus was able to spread efficiently in the human population despite retainment of the avian receptor-binding site. 6 ",

The H5N1 influenza virus can be detected by rapid antigen tests, virus culture, and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). At least 6 rapid antigen detection assays are commercially available and provide results in 15 to 30 minutes but are not as sensitive or specific as virus culture or RT-PCR. 10 Virus isolation in cell cultures enables further antigenic and genetic characterization, drug susceptibility testing, and vaccine preparation.

Conventional and real-time PCR assays detect diverse influenza type A viruses, including the avian H5N1 strains. 28, 29 Polymerase chain reaction primers are directed to the conserved matrix gene of the virus, and therefore this assay would be expected to detect recombinant avian strains of the virus.

However, no efficacy trials have been performed due to the small number of human cases. Because a potential vaccine may be in short supply, antiviral drugs may play an important role in reducing the severity and spread of infection during the first stages of a pandemic. 32 For prophylaxis, oseltamivir should be administered to individuals exposed to H5N1 avian influenza within 48 hours. Therefore, a global influenza strategy in the 21st century calls for stockpiling antiviral drugs and drafting plans for rapid distribution. 9",

Recently, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued guidelines for airline flight crews and persons meeting passengers arriving from areas with avian influenza. 30 Protection of persons involved in outbreak eradication activities includes strict adherence to hand hygiene practices and the use of appropriate personal protective equipment (gloves, disposable clothing, shoe covers, safety goggles, and particulate respirators). 30 During handling of human specimens, formation of aerosols and droplets should be minimized.",

Alternative means of producing H5 and H7 vaccines were exploited, including the plasmid-based reverse genetic technology. 9 A vaccine strain can be created by merging selected hemagglutinin and neuraminidase genes from the target virus with a laboratory virus.
