While recent findings largely support the previous recommendations for extended use and limited reuse in certain situations, some new cautions and limitations should be considered before issuing recommendations in the future. In general, extended use of FFRs is preferred over limited FFR reuse.

Employers benefit from FFR reuse compared to single use by extending the lifetime of the FFR so that fewer need to be purchased. There is no specific restriction on the number of uses or donnings. Rather, historical guidance is focused on the length of time the FFR can be used and identifying situations when the FFR should be discarded. In general, NIOSH (2) specifies that the service life of all filters on NIOSH-approved respirators is limited by considerations of hygiene, damage, and breathing resistance and that any filter should be replaced if it becomes soiled, damaged, or causes noticeably increased breathing resistance. In workplaces that could produce high cumulative particulate filter loading (i.e., >200 mg), the service time for N95 FFRs should only be extended beyond 8 hr of use (continuous or intermittent) by performing an evaluation that demonstrates that continued use will not reduce the filter efficiency.",

            "text": "Because of the concerns that previously used FFRs may be contaminated with infectious material (i.e., act as a fomite), the factors that a health care employer considers in formulating FFR use policies (e.g., single vs. reuse) for its employees are also different from employers in industrial settings. Despite this concern, FFRs are reused under certain conditions in health care. (11) In the health care context, reuse is defined as a HCW donning the same FFR for a series of close patient contacts and doffing it at the end of each of the close patient contacts before it is discarded. Even when FFR reuse is practiced or recommended (discussed in the next section), restrictions are in place (e.g., discard when FFR is contaminated or damaged, becomes difficult to breathe through, and so on) which limits the number of times the same FFR is reused. Thus, FFR reuse is sometimes referred to as \"limited FFR reuse.\" Options for limited FFR reuse were provided when FFRs were first introduced as the minimum level of respiratory protection for HCWs in close contact with patients with tuberculosis. (4) (5) (6) Another related FFR use practice, termed \"extended use,\" involves donning a FFR and wearing it for multiple patient encounters without doffing and redonning between patient visits. Thus, the same FFR is worn continuously (for up to several hours) across multiple patient encounters before it is doffed. This practice is only practical when bundled with the practice of cohorting, which involves locating patients with a common diagnosis in the same unit, ward, or zone. Extended use can be implemented separately from reuse (i.e., like single use, discard the FFR once it is doffed) or combined with reuse. Compared to single use and reuse, recommendations for extended use in health care are fairly recent. The first time extended use of FFRs was identified as an option was during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic. (12) Both extended use and limited reuse of FFRs allow the employer to reduce its consumption of FFRs, prolonging existing supplies during a pandemic or respiratory pathogen outbreak or to save money and reduce waste during day-to-day operations (e.g., close contact with tuberculosis patients) by using fewer FFRs, (13) similar to the benefits found for industrial settings. This commentary examines recommendations related to extended use and limited reuse of FFRs in health care. Key scientific and policy issues are highlighted along with considerations for policy makers to weigh when making decisions on whether to recommend extended use and/or limited reuse of FFRs during routine health care situations and for public health emergencies involving respiratory pathogens that have the potential for aerosol transmission. Finally, key knowledge gaps are discussed to identify additional data needs that could enhance understanding of the risks for transmission of diseases associated with FFR extended use and limited reuse. Table I summarizes past and current recommendations for extended use and limited reuse of  FFRs. CDC recommendations were selected for this analysis because of their widespread  recognition in health care. In 2007, CDC published general infection control guidance for isolation precautions, which included a list of all pathogens and medical procedures in which respiratory protection was recommended. (14) For certain pathogens affecting defined populations (e.g., TB) or infectious agents of special interest to health care (e.g., epidemiologically important organisms such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)] and influenza), CDC publishes detailed specialized infection control guidance. For this analysis, we selected all of the respiratory pathogens in which specialized infection control guidance was published as either interim or final recommendations and included the use of respiratory protection (N95 FFR or higher). This strategy provided a diversity of respiratory pathogens for analysis. These situations include two recent outbreaks/pandemics (2004 SARS and 2009 H1N1 flu), two routine situations (TB and seasonal influenza), and two pathogens of concern (Avian Influenza A (H5N1) and Avian Influenza A (H7N9)).",

However, the CDC recommendations on limited reuse and extended use have primarily considered the specific pathogens involved and the specific characteristics of the event. The first key factor is whether contact transmission is possible for the pathogen. Contact transmission of pathogens occurs through direct or indirect contact with the patient or the patient's environment via blood or body fluids (e.g., respiratory secretions). For pathogens in which contact transmission (e.g., fomites) is not a concern, limited reuse of FFRs has been determined to be a viable option. For TB, the CDC maintains that \"a respirator classified as disposable can be reused by the same HCW as long as it remains functional and is used in accordance with local infection control procedures.\" (15) Infection control guidelines for TB (14) recommend only airborne precautions; contact isolation precautions are only needed if extrapulmonary lesions are draining, which occurs rarely. Contact transmission of TB is thought to be highly unlikely. (16) This contrasts with the recommendations for seasonal influenza where contact with contaminated surfaces and objects is considered a possible mode of transmission. (17) In situations where airborne precautions are recommended, and contact precautions are recommended or contact transmission is possible, the second key factor in the CDC recommendations is the likelihood of a localized shortage of the FFRs needed to protect HCWs during high-risk procedures. The use of FFRs for protection of HCWs during routine infectious disease procedures generally does not result in a FFR shortage, as evidenced by CDC's guidance to wear a FFR during aerosol generating procedures (AGPs) on patients diagnosed with seasonal influenza; this does not include an option for FFR extended use or reuse. (17) extended use, or limited reuse, but instead refer back to the general CDC infection control guidance (14) which specifies single use. These recommendations are consistent with the other four recommendations in Table I based on the potential for contact transmission of these pathogens and that FFR shortages are unlikely in the near-term.",

Moyer and Bergman (30) conducted a laboratory evaluation of the intermittent use (short-term use once per week) of N95 filters over several months. Filtration efficiency was reduced to below 95% for filters from 2 of the 3 manufacturers after 9 and 13 weeks of simulated reuse. Researchers at the Institut de recherch\u00e9 Robert-Sauv\u00e9 en sant\u00e9 et en s\u00e9curit\u00e9 du travail (IRSST) validated the long-term filter performance of a single N95 FFR model. (31) For inert particles below 200 nm, filter efficiency levels remained above 97.3%, even after 5 hr of particle loading (i.e., continuous use). Not surprisingly, another study found that samples from 19 of 21 N95 FFR models stored for up to 10 years had expected levels of filtration performance. (32) Fit-Fit is a measurement of the efficacy of the seal between the FFR and the face of the wearer. Components of the FFR, such as straps, face seal material, shape, and adjustable nose bands influence FFR fit. Several studies have analyzed strap performance and fit for multiple donnings of FFRs. Roberge simulated donnings and reported reduction in the strap load for each successive donning with the majority of the reduction occurring after the first donning. (33) However, the FFR model with the lowest restorative strap performance load was still able to pass fit-testing. Bergman et al. examined the effect of FFR reuse on fit by measuring the fit factors of 6 FFR models donned by 10 subjects up to 20 times with wear times of approximately 2 min between each donning. (34) FFR fit gradually decreased over multiple consecutive donnings; however, good fit was observed for some subjects on some models even after 20 donnings. The best levels of fit were observed for the first five donnings, likely because of the relatively little wear on FFR components (e.g., head straps and nosepieces) compared with later donnings.",

Fit of FFRs is also a concern for extended use where the FFR may become wet and deformed due to moist exhaled breath and facial perspiration. Hauge et al. measured realtime fit while HCWs performed three 10-min simulated patient care scenarios. It was determined that initial fit was predictive of fit during the tasks as the five subjects with initial fit factors greater than 200 registered simulated workplace protection factors greater than 400, and the three subjects with initial fit factors less than 200 had simulated workplace protection factors ranging from 132 to 326.

WPF is a measure of the protection provided by a properly functioning respirator when correctly worn and used in the workplace and is determined as the ratio of the particle concentration outside the respirator over the particle concentration inside the respirator. Infectious bioaerosols are hard to detect and differentiate from noninfectious bioaerosols. (36) Furthermore, assuring compliance during all periods of exposure in the health care setting is challenging. (37) Several studies in other workplaces have assessed protection over extended periods of continuous use by measuring the WPFs: up to 224 min in a steel foundry (38) ; 172 min in a concrete factory (39) ; and 60 min on farms. (40) All three studies concluded that the N95 FFRs provided levels of protection consistent with expectations (i.e., protection factors were \u2265 the assigned protection factor of 10), with reported geometric mean WPF values ranging from 18 to 223. No evidence of reduced protection as a function of time was noted in these studies. The aerosol challenge encountered at the farm locations consisted of biological aerosols such as endotoxins and fungal spores which are more closely related to the bioaerosols in a hospital than to the dust encountered at the foundry and concrete factory.",

Reuse involves multiple repeated uses (donnings) of the same device, and it is possible that some components (straps, nose clips, and so on) could begin to degrade over time and reduce protection. These effects are likely specific to each model of FFR, but the only study published (34) to date on this topic suggests that limiting FFR reuse to no more than five donnings or reuses would provide an adequate safety margin.",

(45) Median tolerance times of 6.6 hr and 5.8 hr were reported for the two FFR models without exhalation valves. Only 16 and 18 of the 27 subjects using those two models were able to complete all four 2-hr use periods of continuous use; the most reported reason for stopping use was head and facial discomfort (e.g., heat). In a follow-up analysis of the same data, it was concluded that FFR discomfort negatively affects respirator tolerance over time, but respirator intolerance is not associated with perceived self-reported exertion. (46) Although the number of participants was small, a recent study reports greater tolerance of extended use of FFRs among HCWs. (47) They reported that 9 of 10 study participants (nurses) were willing to wear FFRs for the entirety of two full 12-hr shifts, stopping only to eat and drink, because it was the end of their shift, or because the FFR was too uncomfortable. The nurses tolerated FFR continuous wear for an average of 223 min on day A study conducted in a teaching hospital in Brazil considered changes in appearance and possible physical damage resulting from FFR reuse. (48) A new N95 FFR was distributed to each nurse once per month and reused as needed until the next new N95 FFR was provided. The researchers found that within 5 days, the majority of the distributed cone-shaped FFRs exhibited visible \"wear and tear,\" indicating possible physical damage (caused by folding them for storage in a pocket) and visible stains/dirt on the FFR interior and exterior surfaces.",

Similar to other potential fomites (e.g., surfaces, medical devices, and stethoscopes (49) ) assessing the level of risk of self-inoculation associated with touching a used FFR is complex. It is very difficult to trace a specific hospital-acquired infection to a particular object.

Factors that influence the risk of self-inoculation directly associated with handling a contaminated FFR include the quantity of respiratory pathogens deposited on the FFR surface (i.e., contamination levels), viability of the pathogen, transfer efficiency of the pathogen from FFRs to the hands of the wearer, and area of hand contact with the contaminated surface.",

However, simple mathematical models can be used to provide some estimates. In one study, influenza aerosol concentration, breathing rate of the wearer, time of patient interaction/FFR use, and particle retention efficiency of the FFR were used as inputs to a linear model to estimate influenza contamination levels inside and on the surface of the FFR (C FFR ). (52) Using this model, an increase in any parameter results in higher levels of C FFR (i.e., total number of pathogens on the FFR). For a typical HCW scenario, using model input values estimated from the peer-reviewed literature, the model calculated that C FFR would be approximately 4500 influenza viruses given an influenza aerosol concentration of 12,000 viruses m -3 , a breathing rate of 1.140 m 3 hr -1 , a particle retention efficiency of the FFR of 0.991, and a 20-min patient interaction/FFR use time. The values for influenza aerosol concentration and wear time found in the literature varied more than other parameters used in the model. Thus, for extended use which involves longer wear times, the number of pathogens available for transfer to the hands is increased.",

(53, 54) In addition to administrative controls, the use of engineering controls such as local exhaust ventilation might reduce C FFR . Similarly, previous recommendations issued during the SARS outbreak suggested the use of a surgical mask or faceshield on top of a FFR to reduce C FFR (26) ; although subsequent work has identified a number of potential concerns, including regulatory compliance with this approach.

(56, 57) However, modern (post-1995) FFRs are made of polypropylene, which cannot serve as a nutrient for bacteria. (58) Studies confirmed that surrogates for TB were not able to grow on polypropylene-based filter media, even under incubation conditions.

While growth is not an issue because these pathogens require a host organism to propagate, their persistence or survival on surfaces is a concern. In general, the evidence indicates that viruses are more persistent on nonporous substrates compared with porous materials such as FFRs. Bean et al. reported laboratory-grown influenza A and influenza B survived for 24-48 hr on hard, nonporous surfaces but survived for <8-12 hr on porous substrates. (62) Similarly, another study (63) found that influenza remained viable for 8 hr on FFR samples, but infectivity dropped below detection limits at <24hr. However, Tiwari et al. examined the persistence of two avian respiratory viruses including influenza H13N7 on various substrates and although they found that both viruses survived longer on nonporous surfaces than on porous ones, the viruses remained active for up to 6 days. (64) In one laboratory study, pH1N1 was detected on FFRs for up to 6 days with an average of 90% reduction (1 log) in viability during this time period. (65) Similar findings were found using MS2 phage as a surrogate for respiratory viruses. (66) A surrogate for SARS coronavirus, transmissible gastroenteritis virus, was shown to remain viable for 24 hr on FFR samples with an estimated 99% (>2 log) reduction in titer. (67) )",

However, similar to estimating contamination levels, models can be used where estimates of the key input parameters are available.

For extended use, it is likely that only the finger tips are used to touch the FFR surface (e.g., to reposition the FFR). The total surface area of the volar portion of the fingertips has been estimated to be 7.34 cm 2 . (85) However, when implementing FFR reuse, the proper donning process requires a user seal check step, which requires the user to cover the entire FFR surface by cupping both hands around the filter surface. In this situation, A h would be very similar to A FFR , which has been estimated to be approximately 175 cm 2 , but varies among the various FFR models. Assuming uniform deposition of the pathogen over the surface of the FFR, applying input values of 4,500 FFR -1 for C FFR and 0.1% as an approximation for E t to the equation results in an estimated 4.5 pathogens being transferred to the hands of the HCW during the user seal check step and <1 pathogen for each touch involving a fingertip.",

Steps in the fomite pathway such as the transfer of viable pathogens from hands to respiratory tract ports of entry, transport of viable pathogens to the site of infection, and the infectious dose of the pathogen are not unique to extended use and reuse of FFRs, but are common to any potential fomite. A full assessment that takes into account these steps is beyond the scope of this commentary. However, the model developed by Nicas and Sun indicates that each successive step in the fomite pathway further reduces the number of infectious pathogens reaching the site where infection can occur, reducing the risk of self-inoculation from practicing FFR extended use and/or limited reuse. (51) In theory, extended use should not present a significant self-inoculation hazard, as ideally, the HCW's hands should never come in contact with the contaminated filtering surface when proper doffing protocols are followed. (86) However, the Rebmann study (47) reported that HCWs touched or adjusted their FFR on average 10-20 times per 12 hr. shift. Even with this amount of contact, our analysis, based on the data and the models discussed above, suggests that very few pathogens are likely to make it to the site of infection each time the hand or fingertip comes in contact with the FFR. Thus, extended use is considered minimal risk for typical patient interactions (Table II) when coupled with training and education to reinforce proper use (e.g., don't touch the FFR surface) and adherence to hand hygiene recommendations.",

Several studies have addressed this issue. Most recently, Fisher et al. examined virus reaerosolization from FFRs and concluded that the risk of virus transfer to the environment from the FFR was negligible, a finding key to extended use and reuse. (87) FFRs were challenged with virus-containing droplet nuclei with a size range of 0.65 to 7.0 \u03bcm (with the majority <1.1 \u03bcm) and challenged with reversed airflow to simulate a sneeze or cough. The highest reaerosolization of 0.21% occurred with a droplet nuclei challenge while a droplet challenge led to reaerosolization of less than 0.0001%. These findings are consistent with earlier studies that examined reaerosolization of bacteria and inert particles. Qian et al. and Willeke and Qian reported the reaerosolization of less than 0.2% for bacteria deposited on N95 FFRs as aerosols and challenged with a reverse airflow consistent with a violent sneeze or cough. (88, 89) Kennedy and Hines found that less than 0.3% of polystyrene latex microspheres reaerosolized from FFRs when dropped from a height of 3 feet (90) Overall, these data provide evidence that the risks of secondary exposure due to reaerosolization or rough handling associated with FFR extended use or limited reuse can be considered negligible (Table II) . Similar to the fomite concerns discussed above, secondary exposure risks could increase as C FFR , the number of pathogens on the FFR, increases (i.e., higher C FFR = higher levels of reaerosolized pathogen), so steps taken to limit FFR contamination (e.g., masking patients, faceshields, local exhaust ventilation systems) should be implemented where possible.",

            "text": "While OSHA is responsible for regulating employers to provide a safe workplace for their employees and CDC makes public health recommendations that are often adopted by hospitals, FDA has a different role in health care settings. The FDA regulates the manufacture and labeling of medical devices. (96) Medical devices are cleared by the FDA under the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act based upon data submitted by the manufacturer to support the claimed intended use of the product. Under 21 CFR 878.4040, FDA classifies surgical N95 respirators as a type of surgical apparel, intended to be worn by operating room personnel during surgical procedures to protect both the surgical patient and the operating room personnel from transfer of microorganisms, body fluids, and particulate material. As part of the labeling requirement, FDA recommends that manufacturers state whether a device is intended to be a reusable device or a single-use disposable device. (9) Some surgical N95 respirator models are cleared by the FDA with claims of being a singleuse device, while other manufacturers do not make such claims. (10) For surgical N95 respirators labeled as \"single use only,\" extended use or limited reuse could be considered as an \"off label\" use of these products. FDA has specific requirements for reuse (\"reprocessing\") of single-use medical devices. (97) Unfortunately, as discussed earlier in this manuscript, some hospital use practices for these types of medical devices such as limited FFR reuse were first recommended (4) (5) (6) (7) and put into practice prior to FDA's involvement. There is also a general lack of awareness among infection control professionals and safety/ employee health administrators in understanding FDA's role in regulating surgical N95 respirators. (98) These factors contribute to the prevalence of \"industrial N95 FFRs\" used in health care settings. These industrial N95 FFRs are NIOSH-certified FFRs, but have not been cleared by the FDA as medical devices. Several of these industrial N95 FFRs were stockpiled by the CDC in the Strategic National Stockpile. (99) In the future the different regulatory and policy perspectives will need to be factored into FFR extended use and limited reuse recommendations. For example, recommendations for operating rooms, where soiling and potential contamination from blood borne pathogens will likely occur, might be different. In those situations, limited reuse should only be considered after consultation with the surgical N95 respirator manufacturer and local hospital infection professionals. benefits (e.g., cost savings, ability to extend existing supplies, reducing the \"burn rate,\" and so on) of FFR extended use and limited reuse.",

However, decisions on how to protect exposed workers must be made in the present and cannot wait until additional evidence is available. In the interim the available evidence can be useful for policy-based and pragmatic public health decision ideologies. (100) As discussed by Rosella and coauthors, (100) emerging public health situations require a balance between various factors. Both evidential and policy considerations are important.

In public health emergencies, policies on FFR extended use and limited reuse should weigh the risks for disease transmission against the risk of disease transmission associated with sacrificing because of FFR shortages (e.g., foregoing respiratory protection or using surgical masks for pathogens or activities where N95 FFRs are recommended). Decisions regarding whether FFR extended use or limited reuse should be recommended need to continue to be pathogenand event-specific. The two most important factors driving this decision should be whether the pathogen is likely to spread (in part) via contact transmission and whether the event could result in or is currently causing a FFR shortage.",

An exception is reuse of FFRs after AGPs, where higher FFR contamination levels are likely to occur. Education and training should be emphasized to reinforce the need for proper hand hygiene when redonning the FFR, including inspection of the device for physical damage and performing a user seal check.

Various models related to fomite transfer were presented where little experimental data are available for use as inputs. In particular, data on actual FFR contamination levels from various health care situations and transfer efficiency of pathogens from FFRs to the hands are limited. While several papers have been published on survivability of various respiratory pathogens on FFRs and the effectiveness of antimicrobial technologies, it is not known how generalizable the results are, which makes it difficult to fully assess risk. Well-designed and carefully controlled studies carried out using consistent test methods appropriate to FFR reuse might reduce some of these uncertainties.Moreover, the infectious dose of various pathogens for the various transmission routes is not well understood, an issue further complicated by newly emerging pathogens and strains. Research and development efforts such as Project BREATHE (Better Respiratory Equipment using Advanced Technology for Health care Employees)(3) that promote the development of better respirators for health care workers are needed to identify novel technologies and designs (e.g., launderabilty, a \"no touch\" user seal check, and so on) to address some of the additional concerns posed by extended use and reuse. The paucity of data on many of the practical aspects of FFR extended use and reuse also suggests that additional studies are needed to validate preliminary findings regarding the acceptable number of donnings and to develop best practices for storage, labeling, and education/ training. Surveillance data on FFR usage, including extended use and reuse, during routine operations and public health emergencies are needed to better understand the possible J Occup Environ Hyg.
