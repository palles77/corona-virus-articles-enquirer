Clinical parameters (body temperature and respiratory disease scores), virological and immunological profiles [ELISA and virus neutralizing (VN) antibody titers], macroscopic lung lesions and viral load in the lungs (quantitative realtime PCR and cell culture assay) were assessed in vaccinated and both genotype 1 and 2 PRRSV challenged pigs. Our results showed that the commercial vaccine failed to protect pigs adequately against the clinical disease, viremia and lung lesions caused by the challenged field isolates, Kazakh strains of PRRSV type 1 and type 2 genotypes. In contrast, clinical protection, absence of viremia and lung lesions in D/KV/ADJ vaccinated pigs was associated with generation of VN antibodies in both homologous vaccine strain LKZ/ 2010 (PRRSV type 2) and a heterogeneous type 1 PRRSV strain (CM/08) challenged pigs. Thus, our data indicated the induction of cross-protective VN antibodies by D/KV/ADJ vaccine, and importantly demonstrated that an inactivated PRRSV vaccine could also induce cross-protective response across the viral genotype.",

Two types of PRRSV vaccines are commercially available, modified live virus (MLV) vaccine and a killed virus (KV) vaccine (Charerntantanakul, 2009) . PRRS MLV vaccine has been shown to provide protective efficacy against PRRSV infection in the field; however, it provides limited protection against heterologous viruses. Additionally, PRRS MLV vaccine has the intrinsic risk of reversion to a virulent strain (Kwang et al., 1999) . Though PRRS KV vaccine is safe to use in pigs, it elicits insufficient immunity in pigs (Lee et al., 2014) . Overall, commercially available PRRS KV vaccine does not induce strong required immune response, and thus failed to protect pigs against viremia to homologous as well as heterologous viral challenges (Nilubol et al., 2004; Scortti et al., 2007; Zuckermann et al., 2007) .",

Passive transfer studies demonstrated that the PRRS VN antibody response is responsible for viral clearance from the blood and lungs, and reduce transplacental transmission of the virus, thus played a significant role in protective immune response against PRRS (Lopez and Osorio, 2004; Osorio et al., 2002) . Recent research efforts aimed to improve protective immune response to PRRS KV have been focused on utilizing potent vaccine adjuvants, which help to reduce viremia, lung lesions and clinical disease in homologous and heterogeneous PRRSV challenged pigs. Several types of vaccine adjuvants have been investigated for their ability to potentiate the immune response to PRRS vaccines (Charerntantanakul, 2009; Li et al., 2013) , for example polymeric adjuvant Montanide TM Gel (Deville et al., 2012; Parker et al., 2008; Tabynov et al., 2015) . Previous work in our laboratory demonstrated that Montanide TM Gel 01 potentiates the immune response of a candidate inactivated PRRS vaccine , but at that time the efficacy was not compared with the commercial vaccine.",

In the assay, 6-FAM (6carboxyfluorescein) was used as a reporter dye for detection of type 1 and type 2 PRRSV; and the alternative reporter dye CY5 was used for detection of extraction/inhibition control. The reaction volume per well included 17.25 ml of EZ-PRRSV TM MPX 4.0 Reagent (includes buffer, primer and probes), 0.75 ml of Enzyme Blend and 7 ml of the extracted serum sample. Each PCR run included two positive controls for type 1 and type 2 viruses and one negative amplification control. Negative and positive controls per well contained 17.25 ml of EZ-PRRSV TM MPX 4.0 Reagent, 0.75 ml of Enzyme Blend, 0.25 ml of inhibition control and 7 ml of the positive (3.5 ml of type 1 and 2 PRRSV) or negative control (1 \u00c2 TE buffer). Plates were briefly mixed by shaking on a vortex mixer (10 s), centrifuged, and loaded into the thermal cycler (7500 Fast Real-Time PCR System; Applied Biosystems 1 , Foster City, CA, USA). The thermal cycling conditions were as follows: one cycle at 48 C for 15 min, one cycle at 95 C for 2 min, 45 cycles at 95 C for 5 s and 60 C for 40 s. Samples with C t values < 38 for either genotype PRRSV were considered positive. Quantification of samples was expressed in terms of the number of RNA copies per ml for serum and copies per gram of lung tissues. These estimates were based on linear extrapolation of the cycle threshold values against a standard curve generated by serial dilutions of known amounts of in vitro transcript RNA product (1 \u00c210 1 to 1 \u00c210 8 copies per ml).",

In the D/KV/ADJ-vaccinated pigs, VN titers against LKZ/2010 were detected at DPFV 42 (Fig. 3A) .

A rapid VN antibody response against LKZ/ 2010 virus was observed in the D/KV/ADJ vaccinated pig group 3 indicating that the vaccine induced better protective memory immune response. To assess broad VN antibody activity, we used heterologous PRRSV strain (type 1) CM/08 in VN assay and detected VN titers at DPFV 42 in pig groups 3 and 4 vaccinated with D/KV/ADJ (Fig. 3B) .

However, each vaccine type possesses its own strengths and limitations. Due to safety issues inactivated vaccines are preferred over attenuated vaccines; however, efficacy of current inactivated PRRSV vaccines is questionable (Renukaradhya et al., 2015a; Scortti et al., 2007; Vanhee et al., 2009; Zuckermann et al., 2007) . Inactivated PRRSV vaccine under field situations showed to elicit protective immune response under certain conditions, which was depending on the strain of infecting field virus. By employing a controlled inactivation procedure and using a suitable adjuvant, an inactivated PRRSV vaccine could be developed that systematically induces PRRSV specific VN antibody response after two vaccinations in na\u00efve piglets (Nilubol et al., 2004) . Serum VN antibodies have been identified as a key component of protective immunity against PRRSV infection (Osorio et al., 2002) . Researchers have previously showed that an inactivated vaccine could induce VN antibodies resulting in strong to partial virological protection in challenged pigs (Misinzo et al., 2006; Renukaradhya et al., 2015a) . Experiments of passive transfer of VN antibodies in pigs prior to PRRSV infection showed VN antibodies could fully protect pigs against viremia and reproductive failure (Lopez and Osorio, 2004; Osorio et al., 2002) . However, others observed only low to moderate degree of protection against heterologous strains of virus when pigs were immunized with inactivated PRRSV vaccines (Labarque et al., 2004; Lager et al., 1999) . But intranasal delivery of poly(lactic-coglycolic) acid nanoparticle-entrapped UV-killed PRRSV vaccine adjuvanted with soluble Mycobacterium tuberculosis derived whole-cell lysate showed the induction of cross-protective immune response in pigs (Binjawadagi et al., 2014a (Binjawadagi et al., , 2014b .",

A commercial killed PRRSV vaccine (C/KV/ADJ, strain NVDC-JXA1, type 2) was selected as a reference vaccine, which has been in use for immunization of pigs against PRRS in most of the pig farms in Kazakhstan.

After challenge by day 6 all the C/KV/ADJ vaccinated pigs became seropositive. However, we did not observe VN titers to LKZ/2010 or CM/08 in the serum pre-challenge, and only a slightly elevated neutralizing antibody response was detected post-challenge in C/ KV/ADJ-vaccinated pigs. These results are consistent with other published studies (Scortti et al., 2007; Zuckermann et al., 2007) , wherein vaccination with inactivated PRRSV candidate vaccines slightly improve VN antibody response post-challenge. Moreover, comparable to mock-vaccinated pigs, C/KV/ADJ vaccinated animals became ill post-challenge and manifested characteristic clinical signs of PRRS (severe respiratory disorders with high scores), with simultaneous detection of viremia. Noticeable macroscopic lung lesions were observed at necropsy in all the mock-and C/KV/ADJvaccinated pigs challenged with LKZ/2010 (type 2) or CM/08 (type . Data in (A) indicates the mean PRRSV AE SEM RNA copy numbers of 5 or 10 pigs in each group, and data in (B) were expressed as the geometric mean AE SEM log 10 TCID 50 /ml of 5 or 10 pigs in each group. Serum samples of pigs were collected up to DPC 14 (63 DPFA) challenged with PRRSV (LKZ/2010 or CM/08). The limit of detection by the assay kit was 10 3 RNA copies per ml. The limit of detection for the virus titration assay was 10 0.75 TCID 50 /ml. 1) virus, and detected high challenged viral RNA copy numbers in the lungs. Thus, we conclude that the commercial C/KV/ADJ vaccination in pigs does not protect against clinical disease, viremia and lung lesions against field variants of Kazakh strains of PRRSV. These results are in line with earlier studies, such as vaccination against PRRS in the field provides variable degrees of protection, and reports of clinical outbreaks of PRRS in vaccinated pigs have led to doubts about efficacy of current commercial PRRSV vaccines (Geldhof et al., 2012; Thanawongnuwech and Suradhat, 2010) .",

Interestingly, the VN titer did not reduce after challenge in any pig vaccinated with D/KV/ADJ, and the animals had consistently high VN titers against both homologous and heterogeneous PRRSV. This data is in agreement with an earlier study, which showed that high VN titers are required at the time of challenge to offer full protection against high dose of virus used to infect animals (Geldhof et al., 2012) . The detectable levels of replicating PRRSV was absent post-challenge in D/KV/ADJ vaccinated pigs, which could be attributed to early appearance (pre-challenge) of VN antibodies targeting the putative neutralizing epitopes on the PRRSV GP5 and M proteins (Yang et al., 2000) , but it needs further investigation.

            "text": "In this study, although our candidate BEI-inactivated PRRSV vaccine adjuvanted with Montanide TM Gel 01 ST provided protection against homologous (type 2) and heterogeneous (type 1) strains of virus, this does not confirm that this vaccine formulation would cross-protect against other heterogeneous and heterologous field strains of viruses; which needs further vaccine trials. Due to lack of sequence data of vaccine and challenge viruses used in this study, it is likely that though the commercial vaccine virus and the challenge virus strain are type 2 viruses, the level of genetic variability is not known. However, to our knowledge, this is the first report demonstrating that an inactivated PRRSV vaccine could also provide cross-protective response against a different viral genotype in pigs, which offers new perspectives for the development of effective and safe PRRSV vaccines.",
