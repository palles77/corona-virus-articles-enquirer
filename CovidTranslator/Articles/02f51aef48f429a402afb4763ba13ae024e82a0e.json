Additionally, LAMP amplicons, which can reach lengths of up to 500 base pairs, (but typically remain <300 for detection reasons 2 ) have been extensively studied in other LFIAs. Additional data not included in this publication showed no significant effect (no difference in final signal) even when we used samples containing large products produced by LAMP (~200 base pairs) on our 2DPN.",

In order to compare the performance our device to other literature, we calculated the percent difference of the enhanced signal intensity relative to the AuNPs signal intensity, shown below. From this data the average percent difference for all sample concentrations above the LOD (5E11 copies/mL) was 116%. Four-parameter logistic (4PL) models are typically used to model signal intensity as a function of sample concentration in ligand-binding assays, such as ELISAs 4 .

The signal output of the 2DPN showed test line intensity changes as a function of sample concentration. The fit of the ELISA (R 2 =0.9771) with our data, indicates that our paper-based dried reagent ELISA assay can generate results like that of a traditional ELISA ( Figure S3 ).

In academic research, low-cost design specifications are typically assessed by a bill of materials. For example, Richards-Kortum's paper reporting on the development of a paper-based HIV-1 drug resistance detection device included a bill of materials that summed $12.69 6 . However, the academic prototype cost estimation often varies widely from actual commercial prices. While a pregnancy test could be made in a lab from $0.22, commercially available pregnancy tests in the US start at a price of $3.50 7 . Although such a cost analysis does not take into account production costs and factory overhead, the bill of materials does provide some insight on whether or not the devices would be within a feasible cost range in low income areas. We therefore still found it useful to assess our raw materials cost, although we acknowledge that commercial costs of this device after manufacturing would be higher. We estimate the total material cost of our 2DPN to be approximately $1.82. ",
