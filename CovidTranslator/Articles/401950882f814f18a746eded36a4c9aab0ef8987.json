            "text": "Bronchiolitis is one of the most common infectious respiratory conditions of early childhood 1,2 and is associated with multiple different viruses. 3 Most children who develop bronchiolitis have a mild course, but 2% to 3% of children with bronchiolitis are hospitalized 4, 5 and ,1% are admitted to an ICU, are intubated, or die. [6] [7] [8] [9] Despite objective physical examination findings for respiratory distress (eg, respiratory rate and degree of retractions), the difficulty and uncertainty of determining the appropriate level of supportive care for children with bronchiolitis is well documented by marked variability in acute care and disposition. 7,10-12 One reason for this variability may be that the clinical course for children with bronchiolitis tends to be variable and dynamic. 13 Indeed, the subgroup of children with severe bronchiolitis requiring continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) and/or intubation remains ill defined. This lack of understanding may hinder treatment advances, as well as mechanistic research, because this group of children may respond differently to medications and/or have different longterm clinical outcomes. 14, 15 Researchers have identified demographic, environmental, medical history, and laboratory risk factors for severe bronchiolitis 1, 5, 8, [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] in single-center studies, [25] [26] [27] [28] retrospectively, 28, 29 in children with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) only, 6 and in children with RSV before the use of palivizumab. 6, 25 In contrast, we performed a prospective, multicenter, multiyear study of .2000 children hospitalized with bronchiolitis to investigate the historical, environmental, clinical, and pathogenic factors associated with CPAP and/or intubation. We hypothesized that children aged ,2 months, with low birth weight, and with preadmission room air oxygen saturation ,90% would predict the need for CPAP and/or intubation.",

Regarding young age, several studies have identified age ,6 weeks as predictive of severe bronchiolitis, 6,46,47 but On initial presentation, the clinical factors of apnea, severe retractions, room air oxygen saturation ,85%, and inadequate oral intake all independently predicted the need for CPAP and/ or intubation. These 4 factors clearly paint the picture of an infant in respiratory distress and, although beyond the scope of this analysis, may be markers for children who are born with reduced lung function. [48] [49] [50] One of these 4 factors is apnea, and we found in a previous prospective study that apnea in the ED was associated with ICU admission. 16 Similarly, a retrospective chart review study of 185 children aged ,12 months with RSV bronchiolitis by Kneyber and colleagues 21 found that children with apnea were more likely to be intubated. These prospective data confirm that apnea is a serious event in children with bronchiolitis and predicts the need for CPAP and/or intubation. Another factor of interest was room air oxygen saturation. Compared with the referent room air oxygen saturation value of .94%, oxygen saturation values between 85% and 93.9% were not predictive of CPAP/intubation. However, children with ,85% oxygen saturation were more likely to require CPAP and/ or intubation, and this value is lower than the previously identified value of 90%, which represents the inflection point on the oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve. 6 These oxygen saturation data provide a different, less conservative perspective about the severity of a child' s bronchiolitis illness that may help to more appropriately triage children to intensive care.",

            "text": "Also of interest were the factors not associated with the need for mechanical respiratory support. For example, previous studies suggest that boys are more likely than girls to have severe bronchiolitis, 5, 9 but in the present data we did not find an association between gender and the severe bronchiolitis outcome, defined as requiring CPAP and/or intubation. Regarding the viral etiology of bronchiolitis, some data suggest that RSV-A 24,25 and viral coinfections 51,52 are associated with more severe bronchiolitis symptoms. We found that RSV-A is more common in children requiring CPAP/intubation on the day of admission, but not more common overall among children requiring mechanical respiratory support. Moreover, our previous data identify that children with RSV/HRV coinfections have a protracted severe illness, but not necessarily a higher intensity of illness as represented by intensive care outcomes, such as CPAP/ intubation. 3 Children born to mothers who smoked during pregnancy have impaired lung function at birth 53 that has been shown to persist through childhood. 54, 55 Furthermore, smoke exposure increases the incidence and severity of bronchiolitis. 19, [56] [57] [58] Our smoke exposure data extend these findings and are the first to demonstrate that maternal smoking during pregnancy is independently associated with bronchiolitis requiring CPAP and/or intubation even after controlling for 9 other factors. Different mechanisms for the harmful effects of smoke exposure have been examined, but they are beyond the scope of this analysis. 59, 60 These data clearly demonstrate the respiratory risks associated with in utero smoke exposure and reemphasize the priority that should be placed on smoking cessation, especially in pregnant women. 61 Another interesting finding is that almost 40% of the children who required mechanical respiratory support on the day of presentation had difficulty breathing for ,1 day before presentation. Fortunately, no child in our study died. Nevertheless, it is informative to compare the tempo of respiratory decline in this subgroup of children with bronchiolitis with descriptions of children with influenza who died during 2 recent influenza seasons. Bhat and colleagues 62 described that, during the 2003-2004 influenza season, 29% of children died within 3 days of the onset of illness and 5% died within 1 day. In addition, in a description of the 2009 novel H1N1 pandemic in Argentina, Libster and colleagues 63 described that 3 children (23%) died within 3 days of the onset of symptoms. Although there are few data on this topic, high levels of cytokines have been associated with reduced severity of illness in bronchiolitis, 64, 65 which is the opposite for influenza. 66 Further study on the acute immune responses of this subgroup of children who have rapid respiratory decline may provide further insight into how RSV and HRV pathogenesis may differ from influenza in infants.",

The study participants were enrolled in academic medical centers, and, therefore, these results may not be generalizable to community medical centers. Furthermore, there is institutional variability in care and resource utilization, including CPAP and intubation, for children with bronchiolitis not explained by severity of illness. 7 Commenting on the appropriateness of these procedures is beyond the scope of these data. However, CPAP and 17 16 intubation are major interventions with associated complications, [33] [34] [35] [36] and this outcome should have less practice variability than admission to the ICU. In addition, this was an observational study, and, therefore, the chest radiographs were not performed systematically. Despite our intriguing results, we did not include this variable in the multivariable models given the high potential for bias. Last, mothers who smoke during pregnancy continue to smoke after delivery and it is difficult to distinguish between environmental exposure to smoke in utero or ex utero. Nonetheless, these smoking data provide more evidence to continue to encourage smoking cessation.",

The present data not only build on and extend previous findings about the respiratory ramifications of in utero smoke exposure for infants, but they also emphasize the need for continued work on smoking cessation. In addition to the demographic, historical, and clinical variables that predicted the need for mechanical respiratory support, we found a novel subgroup of children with bronchiolitis that have a rapid respiratory decline. Although this large study has clarified the characteristics of the children who have the most severe bronchiolitis, the next steps are to examine why and how these children differ from the majority of children who do not require mechanical respiratory support. As bronchiolitis research moves forward, the subgroup of children with rapid respiratory decline will be of particular interest and may yield important insights for the future management of children with bronchiolitis.
