We report the introduction and expression of a fusion DPT protein containing immunoprotective exotoxin epitopes of Corynebacterium diphtheriae, Bordetella pertussis, and Clostridium tetani in tobacco chloroplasts. Using biolistic-mediated transformation, a plant-optimized synthetic DPT gene was successfully transferred to tobacco plastomes. Putative transplastomic T0 plants were identi-Wed by PCR, and Southern blot analysis conWrmed homoplasmy in T1 progeny. ELISA assays demonstrated that the DPT protein retained antigenicity of the three components of the fusion protein. The highest level of expression in these transplastomic plants reached 0.8% of total soluble protein. To assess whether the functional recombinant protein expressed in tobacco plants would induce speciWc antibodies in test animals, a mice feeding experiment was conducted. For mice orally immunized with freeze-dried transplastomic leaves, production of IgG and IgA antibodies speciWc to each toxin were detected in serum and mucosal tissues.",

Plants can be used as bioreactors for the production of appropriately safe and inexpensive vaccines, and contribute to reduced costs associated with vaccine transportation and storage (Giddings et al. 2000; Koya et al. 2005; La et al. 2007 ). Plant-based vaccine production has been reported in several plant species, including potato (Mason et al. 1996) , tobacco (Liu et al. 2005; Mason et al. 1992; Zhang et al. 2006 ), tomato (McGarvey et al. 1995 Sandhu et al. 2000) , lettuce (Kapusta et al. 1999) , carrot (Marquet-Blouin et al. 2003; Rosales-Mendoza et al. 2007) , and alfalfa (Dong et al. 2005 ), among others. Feeding studies conducted in animals (Huang et al. 2001; Rosales-Mendoza et al. 2008; Thanavala et al. 1995) and humans (Tacket et al. 1998 (Tacket et al. , 2000 have demonstrated that candidate vaccines produced in plants are eVective in eliciting protective immune responses. This vaccine production approach will also have a positive impact on public health measures in developing countries that lack of proper refrigeration systems for storage of traditional vaccines. As plant-based vaccines are administered orally, these vaccines avoid the use of injections, thus eliminating discomfort and more importantly the risk of disease transmission via re-use of contaminated syringes and needles Richter et al. 2000) .",

Following analysis of transgenic tomato plants, it has been demonstrated that the DPT transgene is integrated into the genome, transcribed, properly translated, and accumulating at levels of 0.006% of total soluble protein (TSP) ). In addi-tion, we have demonstrated that three doses of 270 mg each of freeze-dried tomato triggers speciWc immune responses in mice (Soria-Guerra et al., unpublished) . These studies suggest that the DPT could be used as a viable multicomponent DPT subunit vaccine. However, low levels of expression of the DPT protein in tomato plants render this plant-based candidate vaccine less desirable for commercial use as an oral vaccine. In this study, we report on the transfer and expression of the DPT fusion gene, re-designed for expression in tobacco chloroplasts. Recovery of transplastomic T1 tobacco plants accumulating high levels of the recombinant DPT fusion protein is reported. The antigenicity of all three components of the DPT fusion protein is also conWrmed in these transplastomic tobacco plants by ELISA assays. Following oral feeding of freeze-dried transplastomic tobacco leaves in test mice, immunogenic responses are observed.",

This vector is designed for integration of foreign genes into an MunI restriction site between trnN-GUU and trnR-ACG in the inverted repeat region of the chloroplast genome (Zou et al. 2003) . Several modiWcations have been made to the pKCZ vector in order to express the DPT and aadA genes as bicistrons under the control of the plastid 16S rRNA promoter (Prrn). First, a synthetic plastid 16S-rRN-promoter (Prrn) fused to the 5\u0408-UTR of gene 10 from the bacteriophage T7 (T7G10) was prepared using synthetic oligonucleotides. The 5\u0408-UTR region of this promoter was ligated to the pKCZ vector at restriction sites NheI and BglII of the pKCZ-UTR. Then, the vector pKCZ-UTR was digested with SpeI and NheI in order to delete the aadA expression cassette, and self-ligated to generate pKCZ-UTRdel. An aadA expression cassette was released from the pKCZ vector by SmaI-EcoRV digestion, and cloned downstream of the Prrn-UTR at AfeI and PmlI sites of pKCZ-UTRdel to generate the pBic vector. The DPT coding sequence was subcloned into the pBic vector digested with XbaI and XhoI restriction enzymes. The resulting plasmid was named pBic-DPT (Fig. 1a) . A positive clone was selected following restriction analysis and sequenced. All cloning and analysis procedures were performed following standard protocols (Sambrook et al. 1989) . DNA for plastid transformation was prepared using the Qiagen Plasmid Midi Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA).",

In order to reduce side eVects, a few attempts have been made to produce a multicomponent recombinant DPT vaccine. Boucher et al.

In another report, expression of the tetanus fragment C toxin in chloroplast transformed plants reached 10-25% of TSP content (Tregoning et al. 2005) . In this study, the DPT transgene was expressed under the control of the Prrn promoter and the 5\u0408-UTR T7G10, reported to mediate high expression in plastids (Kuroda and Maliga 2001a) . The relatively low DPT content obtained in transplastomic tobacco plants in this study might be attributed to several factors. Among these, it is likely that the sequence immediately downstream of the start codon, which has been associated with translation eYciency, might contribute to low levels of expression (Kuroda and Maliga 2001b) . Several reports indicated that the amount of recombinant proteins expressed in chloroplasts was lower than 1% of TSP (Maliga 2004) . For example, Lee et al. (2006) reported levels of 0.002-0.004% of TSP of the viral capsid protein antigen against Epstein-Barr virus expressed in tobacco plastids. They suggested that this low level of protein accumulation was likely due to post-transcriptional events and protein stability. Herz et al. (2005) reported that expression levels in plastids were very much dependent on the vector, promoter, and translational control element(s), among others. Therefore, these various factors might have contributed to the low levels of expression observed in this study. Mice feeding studies were conducted using freeze-dried tobacco leaves of transplastomic line E1, expressing DPT. Results suggested that the recombinant DPT protein induced speciWc systemic and mucosal antibody responses in vaccinated mice. To determine whether eVective protective immunity was induced, it will be necessary to assess animal responses and survival to lethal challenge with each of the exotoxins. Moreover, future research would involve targeting the transfer of the DPT transgene into edible crops such as lettuce or carrot that have been recently successfully transformed via plastid transformation (Kanamoto et al. 2006; Kumar et al. 2004 ).",

This further demonstrated successful transformation of plastids with a fusion protein of complex oligemeric structures that remain functional and retain their antigenicities. Moreover, this candidate plant-based vaccine was immunogenic via oral route delivery in mice. This model system would allow for the development of new experimental DPT subunit vaccines having several advantages, including safe and eVective production and delivery, reduced side eVects, and low cost of production.",

Anti-tetanus toxin (a) or anti-diphtheria toxin (b) Western blot analysis using 20 g of TSP from three plants of transplastomic tobacco line E1 (lanes 1-3) and non-transformed wild-type plants (Wt). c ELISA assay: 50 ng of total soluble protein (TSP) from these plants was analyzed using an anti-tetanus toxin polyclonal antibody, an anti-diphtheria toxin polyclonal antibody, and an anti-Bordetella pertussis toxin. Values correspond to means of three replications along with standard deviations. d Levels of DPT protein in leaves of these plants. The amount of DPT was determined using ELISA by comparing the plant sample with a standard curve generated using known amounts (0.5, 1.5, 2.5, and 5 ng) of the tetanus toxoid.
