Inhibition of protein synthesis arises in part due to activation of the dsRNA-dependent protein kinase R (PKR), and in part due to signaling by conserved small RNAs that contain 2',5'-linked oligoadenylates (2-5A) 1-4 . The action of 2-5A is sufficient for arrest of translation, independent of PKR, and at least in some cell lines 2-5A is the main cause of translational arrest 5 . In human cells, 2-5A is synthesized by three enzymes: oligoadenylate synthetase 1 (OAS1), OAS2 and OAS3 (OASs), which function as cytosolic dsRNA sensors using dsRNA binding for activation 6, 7 . The activity of the OASs is normally low to allow housekeeping protein synthesis, but it increases in the presence of viral or host dsRNA molecules 8 . 2-5A has a strong antiviral effect, against which many viruses have evolved 2-5A antagonist genes that are essential for infection 9-16 . proteins and stops lactation, presumably as a mechanism to prevent passing infection via breast feeding 19 .",

            "text": "All of the effects of 2-5A arise from the action of a single mammalian 2-5A receptor, pseudokinase-endoribonuclease L (RNase L) 20 . 2-5A binds to the ankyrinrepeat (ANK) domain of RNase L and promotes its oligomerization and formation of a dimeric endoribonuclease active site [21] [22] [23] . This dimer further assembles into high-order oligomers 24 that cleave viral RNAs 16, 18 and all components of the translation apparatus, including mRNAs 25 , tRNAs 26 and 28S/18S rRNAs 27, 28 . The resulting action of RNase L inhibits global translation, which puts all proteins, including IFNs, at risk of arrest during a cellular response to dsRNA. The impact of translational shutdown by RNase L on IFN synthesis and paracrine IFN signaling is unknown. Measurements of 2-5A/RNase L activity have been limited by the need for biochemical analysis, which are incompatible with live cells. To address this challenge, we developed a realtime 2-5A biosensor and used it to elucidate the kinetics of 2-5A-mediated RNase L activation and translational arrest taking place during the cellular response to immuno-stimulatory dsRNAs. Our biosensor can detect in situ 2-5A synthesis in mammalian cells and thereby it establishes a heretofore missing platform for cell-based applications. These applications can range from live cell screens for modulators of innate immune responses to mechanistic analysis of dsRNA sensing, which we describe in our present work.",

Here we developed a biosensor for continuous and non-invasive 2-5A monitoring in live cells. The biosensor was designed based on the crystal structures of the cellular 2-5A receptor RNase L 22, 24 ( Fig. 1A) , which indicate that the N-terminal ANK domain of RNase L is sufficient for 2-5A sensing and provides a minimal dimerization module 24 . In a single ANK protomer, the N-and C-termini in cis are separated, but upon dimerization of two ANK domains, which bind notably head-to-tail, the C-/N-termini become positioned in trans next to each other (Fig. 1B) . We employed this in cis vs in trans N-/C-distance decrease to drive a dual-split-luciferase sensor.",

It has been shown that knockout of OAS3 is sufficient to inhibit 2-5A synthesis in human cells 11 . We found that biosensor exhibited a robust response to poly-IC in OAS1-KO and OAS2-KO cells. In contrast, the response was lost in OAS3-KO cells ( fig. S2 ), providing a confirmation that 2-5A synthesis gave rise to the reporter activity. RNase L may be activated by local production of 2-5A 30 , at secrete sites inside cells (the cytosol). Notably, OASs are present not only in the cytosol, but also in the nucleus [31] [32] [33] , which further supports that 2-5A accumulation could be nonuniform with subcellular spaces.

Indeed, 2-5A produced at the center of a HeLa cell, may take only several seconds to diffuse across the nucleus, through the nuclear pores, and to become evenly distributed between the nucleus and the cytosol ( Fig. 3E ).

At time points well beyond translational arrest, we observed an increase in antiviral activity (Fig. 5C ) and ISG induction by two orders of magnitude from media of poly I:C-treated WT and RNase L -/cells (Fig. 5D ).

In this setting, cells were first treated with poly-IC for three hours, which stopped protein synthesis but did not yet activate a strong transcriptional IFN response. Next, anisomycin was added to arrest all protein synthesis and the cells were kept for three additional hours. Control cells were kept for the same duration without anisomycin. During the last hour, media was changed to remove poly-IC, but anisomycin treatment was continued to keep the cells translationally arrested. When IFN activity in the media was assayed, we found The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder.

A control experiment showed that anisomycin was compatible with IFN sensing by na\u00efve cells (Fig. 5F ). Of note, anisomycin had a mild stimulatory effect on ISG mRNAs due to an unknown mechanism; this effect acted in the opposite direction from blocking IFNs and thus did not affect the suitability of anisomycin as a control in our tests. Together, our experiments indicated that IFNs are indeed translated when the bulk of protein synthesis remains silenced by 2-5A.",

In the ISR, the arrest of translational initiation can be bypassed by mRNAs encoding stress proteins, such as ATF4 and IBTK\uf061 due to the presence of 5' uORFs that increase translation under conditions of limiting initiation 45 .

            "text": "First, we estimate diffusive relaxation rate in a simplistic cell without the nucleus. This will define how fast a non-uniform concentration of 2-5A should relax in a sphere the size of a cell. The slowest mode to relax will be the spherically symmetric one with a single peak at the cell center, and zero gradient at the cell membrane (reflecting boundary conditions). The diffusion equation with no sources or sinks is: \u2202c/\u2202t = D\u00b7\u2207 2 c, which in the case of spherical symmetry simplifies to \u2202c/\u2202t = D\u00b7(1/r 2 )\u00b7\u2202/\u2202r(r 2 \u00b7\u2202c/\u2202r). This simplifies further if we make the substitution c = u/r, and use \u2202c/\u2202r = (1/r)\u00b7\u2202u/\u2202r -(1/r 2 )\u00b7u and \u2202c/\u2202t = (1/r)\u00b7\u2202u/\u2202t, yielding (1/r)\u00b7\u2202u/\u2202t = D\u00b7[(1/r 2 )\u00b7\u2202/\u2202r(r\u00b7\u2202u/\u2202r -u)], and finally \u2202u/\u2202t = D\u00b7\u2202 2 u/\u2202r 2 . We can expand u in eigenfunctions of the right hand side, which are just sines .

Rather than solving for complete generality, we note that we want the slowest decaying mode for which c is finite at r=0 (eliminating cosines), and has a no-flux boundary condition at the sphere's radius R. No flux at R implies \u2202c/\u2202r = 0, which implies that \u2202u/\u2202r\u00b7(1/u) = 1/r at r = R. Therefore, k\u00b7cos(k\u00b7R)/sin(k\u00b7R) = 1/R, i.e. tan(k\u00b7R) = k\u00b7R, and we need to solve this equation to obtain k. The lowest-k solution (slowest mode of diffusion) is k\u00b7R = 4.49. After defining k* = 4.49/R, we find the corresponding relaxation rate of this mode from the diffusion equation: (-\uf06c k* )\u00b7u = -D\u00b7k* 2 \u00b7u, so that \uf06c k* = D\u00b7k* 2 .",

            "text": "Up to this point, we have neglected contributions to the solution for u(r,t) that are zero when acted on by \u2207 2 , so we can add terms c 0 (t)\u00b7r or c 1 (t) to u(r,t), or equivalently terms c 0 (t) or c 1 (t)/r to c(r,t). Only the constant term satisfies continuity at the center of the sphere for c(r,t), as well as zero flux at the boundary, and this constant term does not decay in time. So the solution for c(r,t) at long times has the form: c(r,t) = c 0 + (c*/r)\u00b7exp(-\uf06c k* \u00b7t)\u00b7sin(k*\u00b7r). It approaches the constant c 0 at very long times, with the leading spatially non-uniform term decaying at a rate: \uf06c k* = D\u00b7k* 2 = D\u00b7(4.49/R) 2 .

            "text": "To evaluate how the nuclear envelope changes the relaxation rate between cytoplasm and nucleoplasm, we need to examine the ratio of the sum of circumferences of the nuclear pores to the circumference of the nucleus 50 . This ratio is given by pore diameter times number of pores divided by nuclear diameter: 5.2 nm x 2000/20 microns \u2248 0.5. From the calculations of Zarnitsyn et al. 50 for transport through a collection of pores contained within a disc-shaped region in a flat sheet, the above value of 0.5 corresponds to transport at ~ 25% of the free diffusion limit. Therefore, in the presence of the nuclear envelope, we estimate that the net relaxation rate will be ~ 0.25\u00b7\uf06c k* ~ 1 s -1 , corresponding to a relaxation time of 2-5A between nucleus and cytoplasm of 1s.
