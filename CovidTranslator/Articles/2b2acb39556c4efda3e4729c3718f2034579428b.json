In some areas, the mortality reached as high as 10% of the infected patients (WHO). Viruses isolated from SARS patients have been confirmed to be a new type of coronavirus that is responsible for the outbreak (Enserink and Normile, 2003; Guan et al., 2003; Lai, 2003; Yan et al., 2003) . Coronaviruses are large enveloped, positive-stranded RNA viruses that cause diseases in human and animals (Chiu, 2003; Martina et al., 2003) . They have the largest genomes in all RNA viruses and replicate by a unique mechanism, which results in high frequency of recombination. Similar to influenza virus, coronaviruses are highly mutable and therefore the infection is extremely difficult to treat (Knipe and Howley, 2001) .",

When the virus replicates, errors are generated with a high frequency, making the virus particularly difficult to target. We therefore chose the target genes in the viral genome that are conserved in different strains of coronavirus. One of the candidates is RDRP (GeneBank AY 268070). This gene has 645 bp and codes a 215-amino-acid peptide. BLAST analysis shows that there is almost no mismatch in this region of coronaviruses. This sequence has no homology with any known human genes.",

The viruses were replicated in Vero-E6 cells at 35 jC. The cell culture supernatant was harvested 48 h after virus infection and stored at \u00c080 jC for future use. To test the anti-SARS virus potential of the shRNA expression plasmids, 1 \u00c2 10 5 Vero-E6 cells were seeded in a 24well plate and transfected with 0.5 Ag shRNA expression plasmid-A, its mutant plasmid-A* and another negative control, pSilence1.0-U6, respectively. Twenty-four hours after transfection, the SARS Cov-p9 viruses in the cell culture supernatant mentioned above were diluted at 1/ 100 000 and added to each well. After infection for 45 min at 35 jC, 1 ml modified Eagle's medium containing 0.8% methylcellulose was added to each well, and the plaques were visualized by staining with crystal violet 48 h after infection.",
