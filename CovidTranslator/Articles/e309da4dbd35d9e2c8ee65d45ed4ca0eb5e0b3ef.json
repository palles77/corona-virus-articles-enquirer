Host factors associated with more severe HRV illness included maternal and family history of atopy (median score 3.5, IQR [1.0-7.8] vs. 2.0 [1.0-5.2], and 3.5 [1.0-7.5] vs.2.0 [0-4.0]). In adjusted analyses maternal history of atopy conferred an increase in risk for more severe HRV bronchiolitis (OR=2.39, 95% CI:1.14-4.99, p=0.02). In a similar model, maternal asthma was also associated with greater HRV bronchiolitis severity (OR=2.49, 95% CI: 1.10-5.67, p=0.03). Among HRV, 35% were HRVA, 6% HRVB, and 30% HRVC.

Although it is well-recognized that the majority of upper respiratory illness 1 episodes in adults and children are associated with HRV, HRV historically have not been thought to play a significant role in infant respiratory illness or morbidity. During recent years, in studies using sensitive reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), HRV have been associated with a significant burden of disease in infants and young children14 , 15. Bronchiolitis, a lower respiratory infection in infants presenting with wheezing, rales, and respiratory distress, has typically been associated with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection15 -17, but a number of studies suggest that HRV are another important cause of bronchiolitis. 15 , 17 -19 Host factors for HRV illness are poorly defined compared with RSV illness. Copenhaver and colleagues found that among high-risk infants of atopic parents, daycare attendance and siblings were risk factors for HRV-associated wheezing. 20 However, the spectrum of HRVassociated illness among infants who are not at high risk for atopy, and host and viral risk factors for HRV-associated infant bronchiolitis are not well-defined. Some viral factors important in childhood respiratory morbidity have recently been elucidated in relation to wheezing illnesses in older children. These recent studies have found that a novel group of HRV, called HRV-C, is associated with a substantial burden of respiratory illness in sick children. 1, 2, [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] We sought to assess the importance of HRV, including HRV-C, as a cause of URI or bronchiolitis among term, non-low birth weight, previously healthy infants without known risk factors for bronchiolitis and to examine host and viral factors that may contribute to HRV pathogenesis. A better understanding of host and viral risk factors for HRV-associated infant morbidity will have implications not only for understanding HRV pathogenesis, but for treatment and disease prevention strategies.",

The primary goals of the cohort are to investigate the acute and the long-term health consequences of varying severity and etiology of viral respiratory tract infections and other environmental exposures on the outcomes of allergic rhinitis and early childhood asthma, and to identify the profile of children at greatest risk of developing asthma following infant respiratory viral infection32. Infants aged \u226412 months were enrolled at the time of a clinical visit (hospitalization, emergency department (ED) visit or outpatient visit) for bronchiolitis or URI from Fall through Spring 2004-2008. Repeat infections were not included. Demographic and clinical data were collected, and nasopharyngeal swabs were obtained by trained nurses for viral testing, as described below. The children underwent an outpatient follow-up visit between ages 12 and 24 months in the Vanderbilt General Clinical Research Center (GCRC), where infant and maternal blood was obtained and an additional parental questionnaire completed.",

HRVC strains were defined using a nucleotide identity of <90%, based on the calculated genetic relatedness of established serotypes as previously described 50 . The HRVC genotypes had a mean nucleotide identity of 66.2% (minimum 23.3% and maximum 99.6%), compared to HRVA (mean 72.0%, minimum 31.0% and maximum 99.8%) and HRVB (mean 73.5%, minimum 54.7% and maximum 99.8%).

We detected HRV in 18% of bronchiolitis cases and 47% of URI among infants enrolled over four respiratory viral seasons. Thus, HRV appears to be an important cause of infant bronchiolitis. Kusel et al. reported that among 263 infants with ARI during the first year of life, half were associated with HRV with HRV being the most common virus detected in children with upper and lower respiratory illness. 52 However, this finding has not been consistent. Another group identified HRV in only 9% of infants with bronchiolitis, 14 and others have detected HRV in 7-17% of bronchiolitis in children <2 years of age 53, 54 . This variability in apparent HRV burden may depend on both the study population and the years of study, as suggested by the differential circulation of HRV in each of the seasons studied in this investigation.",

Maternal atopy conferred over twice the risk of more severe HRV-associated respiratory illness as determined by the bronchiolitis severity score, independent of age, race, smoking, and gender. Korppi et al. compared infants <24 months of age with HRV vs. RSV-associated wheezing and reported that infants with HRV were older and more often had atopic dermatitis and eosinophilia.55 These data are consistent with our findings that infants with HRV-associated respiratory illness are older and that an atopic profile in the mother may be an important risk factor for more severe HRV-associated infant disease. Other cohort studies, such as the COAST study, have elegantly described risk factors for infant virus-associated wheezing and subsequent early childhood wheezing/ asthma; however, all infants in those cohorts had one or both parents with atopy or asthma and thus constituted a high-risk population. 11 , 12 , 20 In contrast, our study included infants with no history of maternal atopy as defined by the ISAAC questionnaire; 56% (354/630) of the infants enrolled did not have a history of maternal atopy. While there are not immediate clinical implications from our study for asthma development, children in this cohort are being followed until the sixth year of life and the outcomes of asthma and allergic rhinitis. This is the first study, to our knowledge, to find that maternal atopy is an independent risk factor for HRV disease severity among term non low birth weight infants who are not selected to be at high risk for atopy, suggesting that there is a genetic predisposition to HRV severity, and that risk factors for atopy may be linked with risk factors for innate immunity to HRV. Airway epithelial cells from asthmatic subjects have been shown to exhibit aberrant responses to HRV infection in vitro 56, 57; our findings suggest that these mechanisms may affect clinical disease.",

Infants with HRVB were more likely to require supplemental oxygen and have a longer duration of hospitalization compared to infants with HRVA or HRVC. Consistent with these findings, infants with HRVB tended to have higher bronchiolitis severity scores, although the number of HRVB strains was small as in other studies, 1, 2, 64 . HRVC was more commonly seen in black infants, compared with HRVA or HRVB. Our prior study also found HRVC to be significantly more common in black children <5 years of age who were hospitalized with ARI or fever during one year and in one study site, but this effect was not significant during both study years and in both sites in that investigation. 2 One cannot assume ethnic differences in predisposition to HRVC infection based on these limited data, as the effects could have merely been seen based on viral circulation patterns amongst different geographic or socioeconomic regions, but these findings suggest that both host and viral genetic factors may be important in disease pathogenesis.",

While many studies have detected HRVC as the predominant HRV species in the fall, suggesting it may play a role in the socalled September asthma epidemic [21] [22] [23] , other studies in different regions and years have found otherwise. Han et al reported HRVC to be more common in the spring and HRVA in the fall in South Korea in 2006, but co-circulation occurred during both seasons 28 . Consistent with our studies, Lau et al found HRVA and HRVC to alternate as the most common HRV species at different times during the peak seasons 65 . Alternate disease activity by species and seasons suggests possible viral interference or serological crossprotection between HRVA and HRVC 65 . While one study reported HRVC year-round without peaks in the spring and fall 25 , most studies do suggest that HRV species vary by season, year, and geographic location.

However, we performed highly sensitive molecular testing for the spectrum of viruses known to cause infant respiratory viral illness, including influenza, RSV, HMPV, PIV1-3 and HCoV including OC43, 229E, and NL63 (data not shown) with no other virus detected in 73.5% of the HRVpositive children, strongly suggesting that HRV was the causative pathogen. Other studies support these findings. [54] [55] In addition, this study cannot delineate population-based rates of HRV-associated LRI and URI, as the cohort did not equally enroll hospitalized and nonhospitalized infants, with nearly two-thirds of the cohort being hospitalized infants, thus over representing infants with bronchiolitis. A final limitation was that we evaluated only one geographic site. However, we report a comprehensive study over 4 years in a site that captures over 90% of Nashville Davidson county infant hospitalizations.",

            "text": "In this study, HRV were frequently associated with bronchiolitis and clinically significant URI in previously healthy term infants. Predominant HRV groups varied by season and year, with substantial genetic diversity. HRVB was associated with more severe disease in univariate analyses. Maternal atopy and asthma were associated with more severe infant HRV illness. This finding suggests that there are underlying susceptibility factors for HRV illness severity that are strongly linked with asthma susceptibility. As HRV is the virus most commonly associated with acute asthma exacerbations in children, future reports from this cohort, as longer term outcomes such as recurrent wheezing and asthma are identified, will help to clarify the complex relationship between host susceptibility and HRV infection.

Of all enrolled infants with bronchiolitis, 18% had HRV; of all infants with URI, 47% had HRV. Among the 162 infants studied with HRV, 81 (50%) had bronchiolitis and 81 (50%) had URI. One hundred four subjects had HRV only with no other virus detected, 44 (42%) of whom were hospitalized. Of the children infected with HRV alone, 37 (36%) were female, 32 (31%) were black, 18 (17%) Hispanic, 38 (37%) white, and 16 (15%) other race.
