Since cholesterol is known to play a key role in the entry of some other viruses, we investigated the role of cholesterol and lipid rafts in the host cell plasma membrane in Newcastle Disease Virus (NDV) entry. We used methyl-\u03b2-cyclodextrin (M\u03b2CD) to deplete cellular cholesterol and disrupt lipid rafts. Our results show that the removal of cellular cholesterol partially reduces viral binding, fusion and infectivity. M\u03b2CD had no effect on the expression of sialic acid containing molecule expression, the NDV receptors in the target cell. All the above-described effects were reversed by restoring cholesterol levels in the target cell membrane. The HN viral attachment protein partially localized to detergentresistant membrane microdomains (DRMs) at 4\u00b0C and then shifted to detergent-soluble fractions at 37\u00b0C. These results indicate that cellular cholesterol may be required for optimal cell entry in NDV infection cycle.",

            "text": "Newcastle Disease Virus (NDV), a prototype of paramyxoviruses, is an avian enveloped RNA-negative strand virus that causes respiratory disease in domestic fowls leading to huge economic losses in the poultry industry. The envelope of NDV contains two associated glycoproteins that mediate viral entry: the hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) and fusion (F) proteins. HN is the receptor-binding protein that recognizes and binds to sialoglycoconjugates at the cell surface [1] . The fusion protein is a metastable protein that undergoes a series of irreversible conformational changes to trigger the fusion of the viral and plasma membrane in a pH-independent manner [2] . Nevertheless, we have previously reported an additional pathway of NDV entry through caveolae-dependent endocytosis [3] . For most paramyxoviruses, including NDV, the triggering of F protein is HNdependent through its fusion promotion activity. The mechanism by which HN protein activates F in a homotypic manner is not well understood [4, 5] .",

Although their existence is still controversial, the resistance of these components to cold detergent extraction and mechanical disruption has been considered proof of their existence (for a review, see [6] ). Caveolae, a particular membrane raft subset, are cholesterol-and glycosphingolipidenriched plasma membrane microdomains, identifiable as stable invaginations of the plasma membrane, which are enriched in caveolin, a membrane protein that is tightly bound to cholesterol [7] . Lipids rafts have been implicated in functions such as membrane signaling and trafficking, signal transduction and the regulation of cell adhesion [8] .",

Thus, some authors have reported the independence of RSV entry from cholesterol [31] , whereas in other works the entry of RSV through caveolae in dendritic cells has been proposed [32] . Moreover, using small interfering RNA technology [33] showed that RSV use clathrinmediated endocytosis to productively infect cells. For NDV, it has been shown that lipid rafts are sites of NDV assembly and release [34, 35] . We have previously shown that the caveolin phosphorylating factor PMA inhibits NDV fusion [3] and that cholesterol depletion exerts an inhibitory effect on NDV interaction with the target cell, leading us to propose that a fraction of NDV may penetrate the cell through caveolae-mediated endocytosis [3] . In the present paper, we extend these studies with a view to clarifying the functional role of cholesterol in NDV entry. Depletion of cellular cholesterol by treatment with methyl-\u03b2-cyclodextrin (M\u03b2CD) inhibited NDV binding, fusion and infectivity. This inhibition was almost completely compensated by replenishing cellular cholesterol levels, suggesting that the effect of M\u03b2CD treatment on virus activities would be due to the removal of cholesterol. Analysis of the distribution of viral envelope glycoproteins in cholesterol-rich resistant membranes showed that viral glycoproteins partially associate with lipid rafts during initial virus adsorption and entry. Our data corroborate a role of cell membrane cholesterol during the early stages of NDV infection. A clear understanding of the role of lipid membrane components in viral entry should be useful in the future for designing antiviral agents and vaccines.",

To analyze whether cholesterol depletion was affecting the expression of viral receptors at the cell surface, after the M\u03b2CD treatment, cells were labeled with two fluorescent-labeled lectins, FITC-MALI and FITC-SNA. The binding of FITC-MALI to cells preincubated in the presence of sialidase from Vibrio cholerae was reduced as assessed by fluorescence microscopy (Supplementary Fig. S3 ) revealing the specificity of lectin binding to sialoglycoconjugates. The degree of binding of both lectins to treated cells was similar to that of control cells (Fig. 2b) , indicating that after cholesterol removal the receptor concentration was not modified at the cell surface. Nevertheless, when we analyzed the lectin-labeled cells by confocal microscopy, the FITC-MALI lectin-staining pattern was altered (Fig. 2c and Supplementary Fig. S4 ): upon M\u03b2CD treatment, the cell surface displayed patches enriched in sialic acid compound (Fig. 2c ), in agreement with previous reports [34, 46] .",

Fusion was assessed by transfer of the R18 red dye to the cell membrane. As a control of non-specific dye transfer, NDV was inactivated by incubation at 100\u00b0C for 2 min (NDV-R18 inact).

Our data revealed a correlation between the degree of cholesterol replacement (Fig. 4a ) and the degree of recovery of NDV activities ( Fig. 4 and Table 2 ). Viral fusion and infectivity were recovered by almost 100% in comparison with the control (Fig. 4b, d and Table 2 ); viral binding was recovered up to 70% (Fig. 4c) . In sum, the recovery of viral activities following cholesterol replenishment strongly supports the notion that the inhibitory effects of M\u03b2CD treatment on NDV activities would be due specifically to cholesterol depletion per se, and that this effect would be reversible. The effect of M\u03b2CD treatment on the synthesis of viral proteins in NDV-infected cells was also analyzed (Fig. 5) . In these experiments, Fig. 1b.

After 24 h at 37\u00b0C, the cells were observed under an Olympus IX51 inverted fluorescence microscope with a 10\u00d7 objective. Quantification of infectivity was accomplished by measuring the area of red fluorescence (infected cells that express the RFP) in pixels referred to the area of nuclei (blue fluorescence) of the field in three to seven random fields. Areas were quantified using the analysis tool in ImageJ software. Fig. 4d , means of two independent experiments. infection. These results indicated that the synthesis of viral proteins was reduced in cholesterol-depleted cells, in support of the infectivity inhibition data shown in Fig. 3 . We observed a certain stimulatory effect of protein expression in the presence of 200 \u03bcM exogenous cholesterol, which correlates with some enhancement of viral infectivity ( Table 2) . This enhancement might be related to the increase of cholesterol in the cell membrane above normal values (Fig. 4a) , although further research is needed to clarify the significance of this enhancement.",

We analyzed the association of viral proteins with isolated DRMs from ELL-0 cells by treatment with TX100 at low temperatures, followed by discontinuous OptiPrep flotation gradients, as detailed in Materials and methods. As a control, caveolin, a protein raft marker, was mainly present in the detergent-resistant fractions 5 and 6, whereas \u03b2-tubulin was mainly found in the detergent-soluble membrane fractions 11 and 12 (Fig. 6a) . For some samples, NDV was bound to cells for 1 h at 4\u00b0C (Fig. 6a, HN 4\u00b0C) ; for other samples, after virus binding for 1 h at 4\u00b0C, cells were shifted to 37\u00b0C for an additional hour (Fig. 6a, HN 4\u00b0C/37\u00b0C ). Then, the cells were lysed and layered at the bottom of a 40%-30%-5% OptiPrep density gradient. Fractions were collected from the top of the gradient and analyzed by Western blotting, probing with a polyclonal anti-NDV antibody. We found that after virus binding at 4\u00b0C, HN was distributed in both the low density Triton-insoluble fractions 5 and 6 as well as in the detergent-soluble fractions. Nevertheless, after viruscell samples shifting to 37\u00b0C, the association of HN to raft fractions was limited to fraction 6. These results were also corroborated in HeLa cells, where HN protein was distributed in both the raft and non-raft fractions (Fig. 6b, HN 4\u00b0C/37\u00b0C ). After M\u03b2CD incubation of cells (Fig. 6b, HN 10 mM M\u03b2CD), the viral protein concentration was reduced and was mainly associated with the non-raft fractions. After the replenishment of cholesterol (Fig. 6b, HN 10 mM M\u03b2CD + 200 \u03bcM Cho), the distribution of HN in the flotation gradient fractions was as observed in the case of the control cells (Fig. 6b HN 4\u00b0C/37\u00b0C ).",

            "text": "Among their different functions, membrane rafts exert a concentrating effect on proteins. Receptors and coreceptors of several viruses have been reported to be associated with lipid rafts on cell membranes such, as CD4 for HIV-1 [50] . During viral attachment, protein recruitment would facilitate protein interactions, leading to viral entry either through a concentration of viral receptors in lipid rafts and/or through a concentration of viral envelope proteins facilitating the formation of the viral protein fusion scaffold [48] . The dependence of the binding of HIV-1 envelope gp120 glycoprotein to lipid rafts on cholesterol strongly supports the idea that raft-colocalized receptors would be directly involved in virus entry [50] [51] [52] . Similarly, for NDV it could be speculated that rafts might act as a platform for local concentrations of receptors and coreceptors, such as glycosphingolipids and/or glycoproteins. During the very early binding steps, a percentage of HN would colocalize to lipid rafts (Fig. 6a, HN 4\u00b0C) shifting to non-raft fractions as the viral-cell interaction progresses (Fig. 6a, HN 4\u00b0C/37\u00b0C ). This could explain the negative effect of cholesterol removal on NDV binding. The partial colocalization of viral proteins to DRMs during binding suggests a weak or partial interaction with rafts, as proposed for other viruses [21, 22] . The different patterns of lectin staining in control and cholesterol-depleted cells suggest that a pool of sialic acid glycoconjugates recognized by NDV might be associated with lipid rafts and that could be modified after cholesterol removal, whereas sialic acid concentrations at the cell surface would not be modified (Fig. 2) . Surprisingly, the data presented here differ from our previous data, which showed that most HN was located in the DRM fractions after viral binding to COS-7 cells [45] . These differences might be cell-dependent, ELL-0 avian fibroblasts being the natural viral host. Additionally, the formation and enlargement of a fusion pore requires the concerted action of several viral proteins [53] . Therefore, the disruption of lipid rafts might hinder the assembly of the viral envelope glycoproteins needed for the formation of the fusion scaffold [54] . In this sense, it has been proposed that the increase in the antiviral potency of cholesteroltagged-peptides derived from the C-terminal heptad repeat regions of viral fusion proteins, including those of paramyxoviruses, would be related to the preconcentration or targeting of these peptides to lipid rafts [55, 56] .",

            "text": "Cholesterol removal and/or lipid raft disruption negatively affect the caveolae-and lipid raft-mediated endocytosis that is used as pathway of entry by several viruses [57] [58] [59] . Cholesterol has also been implicated as a regulatory factor in the entry of viruses that use clathrin and non-clathrin non caveolar/lipid raft endocytic pathways [49] . Recently, Melikyan's team [60] have demonstrated that HIV productively infects cells via clathrin-mediated endocytosis, which helps to explain the dependence of HIV on target membrane cholesterol [61] . Previously, we have reported the colocalization of NDV with caveolin and with the early endosome marker EEA1, leading us to propose that a certain percentage of the virus manages to penetrate the cell through caveolin-dependent endocytic pathways [3] . In this context, it is possible that removal of the cholesterol could negatively affect NDV entry by altering endocytic pathways. The absence of a total blockade of virus-cell fusion and infectivity after M\u03b2CD treatment (Table 1) , as well as the partial association of HN with DRM fractions, may suggest that NDV entry would take place in both raft and non-raft environments. Nevertheless, further research into how the association of NDV with lipid rafts facilitates viral entry is required. Our data indicate a stronger effect of cholesterol removal on NDV binding than on fusion (Table 1) . Moreover, after cholesterol replenishment, fusion and infectivity were almost completely recovered, whereas binding was not (Table 2) . Therefore, it could be argued that some non-productive binding sites were permanently removed after M\u03b2CD treatment, whereas productive binding sites were recovered after cholesterol replenishment, allowing viral fusion and infectivity to occur efficiently.",
