Although the rate of HAIs varies with the specific patient population and institution, some series have reported that more than 20% of critically ill neonates who survive more than 48 hours acquire a nosocomial infection [1] [2] [3] . Neonatal HAIs are associated with significant morbidity, mortality, and excessive direct health care costs [3] . Prevention of these infections should be a major priority in all neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) and nurseries. The most important risk factors for HAIs in neonates, gestational age and birth weight, cannot be modified. Close attention to clinical practice and the patient care environment is mandatory to minimize the risk of infections. This chapter reviews the epidemiology, microbiology, pathogenesis, and prevention of neonatal HAIs.",

Because transplacental transfer of maternal IgG occurs primarily in the third trimester, the serum IgG levels of many preterm neonates are very low. Soon after birth, maternal IgG levels begin to decline, and neonatal production of antigen-specific immunoglobulins begins. Serum IgG concentrations reach about 60% of adult levels by 1 year of age in term neonates [6] . Given the incomplete transfer of maternal IgG and an impaired ability to produce antigen-specific immunoglobulins, premature infants typically have significantly lower levels of serum IgG than their term counterparts, a difference that can persist throughout the 1st year of life. Developmental issues of other organ systems can also affect the risk of HAIs. The immature gastrointestinal tract, characterized by reduced acidification of gastric contents and the fragile integrity of the intestinal epithelium, provides another potential portal of entry for pathogens.",

The acquisition of normal colonizing flora is disrupted in hospitalized newborns for various reasons, including the presence of pathogenic bacteria in the hospital environment and on the hands of health care workers, the frequent use of antimicrobial agents, and exposure to invasive procedures. As a result, the microflora of infants in the NICU can be markedly different from healthy term infants [7, 8] . Multidrug-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) and Klebsiella, Enterobacter, and Citrobacter species colonize the skin and the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts of a high proportion of NICU neonates by the 2nd week of hospitalization [9] [10] [11] [12] .

With use of molecular techniques, even organisms typically considered to originate solely from normal flora (e.g., CoNS) have been shown to have clonal spread in the hospital setting, suggesting contact transmission by means of the hands of health care workers [28, 29] . Transmission via contaminated inanimate objects also occurs and has been described as a potential mechanism of spread of pathogens in multiple NICU outbreaks [27, 30, 31] .

Alternatively, as with any intravenous fluids, parenteral alimentation has the potential for intrinsic and extrinsic contamination, and fat emulsion especially may serve as a growth medium for certain bacteria and fungi. Finally, total parenteral alimentation and intravenous administration of fats likely delay the normal development of gastrointestinal mucosa because of lack of enteral feeding, encouraging translocation of pathogens across the gastrointestinal mucosa.

Although an infrequent cause of fatal infection, bacteremia caused by CoNS has been associated with prolonged NICU stay and increased hospital charges, even after adjustment for birth weight and severity of illness on admission [45] . A 10-year, prospective, multicenter Australian study found that 57% of all lateonset infections during the study period were due to CoNS. Molecular techniques suggest that infections caused by Staphylococcus epidermidis can result from clonal dissemination and that there is often concordance between the strains infecting infants and strains carried on the hands of health care workers [28, 46, 47] . In one study, four clones accounted for 43 of 81 study strains (53%) [28] . This finding suggests that a significant proportion of CoNS infections may be preventable by strict adherence to infection control practices. The fact that a hand hygiene campaign was associated with increased hand hygiene compliance and a lower rate of CoNSpositive cultures further supports this contention [48] .",

This hypothesis is consistent with the observation that enteric feedings have been associated with a reduced risk of gram-negative infections [79] . Pseudomonas aeruginosa, an opportunistic pathogen that can persist in relatively harsh environments, frequently has been associated with HAIs and outbreaks in NICUs. Nosocomial P. aeruginosa infections vary in their clinical presentation, but the most common manifestations are respiratory; ear, nose, or throat; and bloodstream infections [18] . P. aeruginosa infections, particularly bloodstream infections, have been associated with a very high mortality rate [80] . Risk factors for infection include feeding intolerance, prolonged parenteral alimentation, and long-term intravenous antimicrobial therapy [80] . Outbreaks owing to P. aeruginosa have been linked to contaminated hand lotion [81] , respiratory therapy solution [82] , a water bath used to thaw fresh frozen plasma [83] , a blood gas analyzer [84] , and bathing equipment [85] . Health care workers and their contaminated hands also have been linked with Pseudomonas infections in the NICU. In a study of a New York outbreak, recovery of Pseudomonas species from the hands of health care workers was associated with older age and history of use of artificial nails [86] . This and other studies suggest that the risk of transmission of Pseudomonas to patients is higher among health care workers with onychomycosis or who wear long artificial or long natural nails [86, 87] . As a result of these and other findings, the CDC revised its 2002 hand hygiene recommendations to include a recommendation against the presence of health care workers with artificial fingernails in intensive care units [88] .",

K. pneumoniae and E. coli are the organisms most commonly recognized as ESBL-producing organisms, but other ESBL-producing gram-negative bacilli are being increasingly identified. NICU outbreaks caused by other ESBL-producing organisms have been identified; transfer of ESBLcarrying plasmids to other Enterobacteriaceae organisms has been shown in several NICU outbreaks [111, 112] .

Over time, there was an overall decrease in candidemia in neonates weighing less than 1000 g, but no change in the distribution of Candida species.

The relative roles of gastrointestinal tract colonization and enteric translocation versus skin surface colonization and catheter-related infection are unclear and not mutually exclusive [121] . A prospective study, including 35 infected neonates, suggested that risk factors for candidemia included gestational age 32 weeks or younger, Apgar score less than 5, shock, disseminated intravascular coagulation, intralipid use, parenteral nutrition, CVCs, H 2 blockers, intubation, and length of stay more than 7 days [35] . Various other studies have largely confirmed or expanded on these results, including two more recent reports. A prospective, multicenter study by Benjamin and coworkers [116] analyzed data from 320 infants with extremely low birth weight and invasive candidiasis and found birth weight less than 750 g, male gender, delayed enteral feeding, and cephalosporin use all to be associated with disease. Cotten and associates [122] reported on 3702 infants with extremely low birth weight in 12 NICUs, linking candidiasis with third-generation cephalosporin use.",

Often, skin maceration is the presumed portal of entry. In a series of four patients who died of disseminated Aspergillus infection that started cutaneously, a contaminated device used to collect urine from the male infants was implicated [129] . Similarly, contaminated wooden tongue depressors, used as splints for intravenous and arterial cannulation sites, were associated with cutaneous infection owing to Rhizopus microsporus in four premature infants [130] . In addition to preterm birth, use of broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents, steroid therapy, and hyperglycemia are thought to be risk factors for mold infection.",

Postnatal CMV infection in premature infants can be severe, however, and associated with hepatitis, bone marrow suppression, or pneumonitis [152] [153] [154] . The incidence of postnatal CMV infections in preterm infants has decreased significantly with the routine use of CMV-seronegative blood products. At present, most postnatal CMV infections are acquired through breast milk [155] . Approximately one third of infants who are breastfed by mothers with CMV detected in breast milk can develop infection [156] . In one study, approximately 50% of these infants had clinical features of infection, and 12% presented with a sepsis-like syndrome. At present, no proven, highly effective method is available for removing CMV from breast milk without destroying its beneficial components. Some data suggest, however, that freezing breast milk before use may decrease the CMV titer, limiting subsequent transmission [157] . Person-toperson transmission within the NICU has also been documented [158, 159] , but the extent to which this occurs is controversial [160] . More detailed information on the clinical features and management of CMV is presented in Chapter 23.",

More recent data in neonatal patients have shown, however, that catheter placement in the lower extremity is not associated with an increased risk of infection in neonates [176] . Umbilical veins and arteries are available for CVC insertion only in neonates. The umbilicus provides a site that can be cannulated easily, allowing for collection of blood specimens and hemodynamic measurements, but soon after birth, the umbilicus becomes heavily colonized with skin flora and other microorganisms. Nonetheless, rates of catheter colonization and catheter-associated bloodstream infections attributable to umbilical catheters are similar to rates associated with other types of CVC. Colonization rates for umbilical artery catheters are estimated to be 40% to 55%; the estimated rate for umbilical artery catheter-related bloodstream infection is 5% [169] . Colonization rates are 22% to 59% for umbilical vein catheters; rates for umbilical vein catheter-related bloodstream infections are 3% to 8% [169] . Careful skin antisepsis before insertion of an intravascular catheter is crucial to prevention of intravascular device-related bacteremia. The CDC recommends chlorhexidine-based preparations because these products have been found to be superior to povidone-iodine in reducing the risk of catheter colonization (a recognized surrogate marker of catheter-associated bloodstream infections). Although not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in infants younger than 2 months of age, some NICUs have reported the off-label use of this product [177] .",

In a study performed in a community level III nursery, high-risk infants (infants with very low birth weight and others with critical illnesses) were randomly assigned to have a newly placed peripherally inserted central catheter \"locked\" several times a day with either a vancomycin-heparin solution or a heparin-only solution. The investigators noted a significant reduction in the incidence of catheter-related bloodstream infections (relative risk 0.13; 95% confidence intervals 0.01 to 0.57) [178] . A single-center randomized clinical trial of fusidic acid-heparin solutions infused and held within a catheter lumen was associated with a significant reduction in the incidence of catheterassociated bloodstream infections (6.6 versus 24.9 per 1000 catheter days; P < .01; relative risk 0.28; 95% confidence interval 0.13 to 0.60). The high rate of catheterassociated bloodstream infections in the control group of infants suggests that this intervention might not be beneficial in settings that have already achieved low infection rates [179] . Because many NICUs achieve substantial reductions in the rates of catheter-associated bloodstream infections through application of other evidence-based practices, the role of antiseptic lock solutions needs further investigation.",

A single-center study showed delayed onset of tracheal colonization in intubated infants who were positioned on their side; however, no studies have shown a clear reduction in neonatal VAP associated with strict adherence to this practice [189] . Appropriate placement of enteral feeding tubes should be verified before their use [190, 191] . To prevent regurgitation and potential aspiration of stomach contents by a sedated patient, overdistention of the stomach should be avoided by regular monitoring of the patient's intestinal motility, serial measurement of residual gastric volume or abdominal girth, reducing the use of narcotics and anticholinergic agents, and adjusting the rate and volume of enteral feedings [190, 191] . Oral decontamination, with the intent of decreasing oropharyngeal colonization, has been studied in adults and seems to reduce the incidence of VAP [192, 193] . Many NICUs have already adopted regular oral care as a component of their VAP prevention activities.",

These definitions do not distinguish, however, late-onset infections caused by transplacentally acquired organisms (e.g., group B streptococcus infections) from more typical nosocomial infections [210] . Distinction between maternal and hospital sources of infection is important, although difficult at times, because control measures designed to prevent acquisition from hospital sources would be ineffective in preventing perinatal acquisition of pathogens [211] . Surveillance for infections in healthy newborns also is challenging because of the typically short length of stay. Infections can develop after discharge, and these are more difficult for infection control practitioners to capture. Methods for postdischarge surveillance have been developed, but because most neonatal infections that occur after discharge are noninvasive [212] , such surveillance has not been widely implemented owing to concerns about the cost-effectiveness of these labor-intensive processes.",

Although many adult ICUs have begun to screen all patients routinely on admission for carriage of various multidrug-resistant organisms, this practice has not yet been consistently adopted by NICUs. Factors such as the perceived low rate of carriage of resistant organisms by infants have undoubtedly led some neonatologists to question the need for universal screening on NICU admission. Data have shown, however, that a significant reservoir of resistant organisms can exist in hospitalized neonates. After two patients developed clinical infections owing to VRE, surveillance cultures revealed that more than 15% of other patients in the same unit had unsuspected VRE colonization [109, 110] .",

The CDC \"Guideline for Hand Hygiene in the Health Care Setting\" calls for use of alcohol hand rubs, foams, or gels as the primary method to clean hands except when hands are visibly soiled [88] . Specific activities that have been independently associated with increased density of pathogens on health care worker hands include skin contact, respiratory care, and diaper changes. Additionally, investigators have shown that the use of gloves during these activities does not fully protect health care workers' hands from bacterial contamination [219] .

In addition, mothers should be instructed to perform hand hygiene and cleanse nipples with cotton and plain water before expressing milk in sterile containers [211, 241] .",

If not performed carefully, bathing can be detrimental to the infant, resulting in hypothermia, increased crying with resulting increases in oxygen consumption, respiratory distress, and instability of vital signs [177] . Although the initial bath or cleansing should be delayed until the neonate's temperature has been stable for several hours, removing blood and drying the skin immediately after delivery may remove potentially infectious microorganisms such as hepatitis B virus, HSV, and HIV, minimizing risk to the neonate from maternal infection [234] . When the newborn requires an intramuscular injection in the delivery room, infection sites should be cleansed with alcohol to prevent transmission of organisms that may be present in maternal blood and body fluids [170] . For routine bathing in the first few weeks of life, plain warm water should be used. This is especially important for preterm infants and full-term infants with barrier compromise such as abrasions or dermatitis. If a soap is necessary for heavily soiled areas, a mild pH-neutral product without additives should be used, and duration of soaping should be restricted to less than 5 minutes no more than three times per week [177] .",

A review published in 2003 described care regimens used for more than 2 decades, including combinations of triple dye, chlorhexidine, 70% alcohol, bacitracin, hexachlorophene, povidone-iodine, and \"dry care\" (soap and water cleansing of soiled periumbilical skin), and found variable impact on colonization of the stump [246] . The study authors suggested that dry cord care alone may be insufficient and that chlorhexidine seemed to be a favorable antiseptic choice for cord care because of its activity against gram-positive and gramnegative bacteria. They went on to stress, however, that large, well-designed studies were required before firm conclusions could be drawn. The current Perinatal Guidelines do not recommend a specific regimen, but warn that use of alcohol alone is not an effective method of preventing umbilical cord colonization and omphalitis [241] . The Perinatal Guidelines further recommend that diapers be folded away from and below the stump and that emollients not be applied to the stump [177] .",
