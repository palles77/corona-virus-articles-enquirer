Protection does not involve the suppression of virus replication in the central nervous system (CNS) or via augmentation of the antiviral antibody response. In the present report we have compared the CNS lesions induced by JHMV in lethally infected and T cell clone protected mice. The presence of virus-specific T cell clones induced a transient increase in mononuclear cell infiltration into the parenchyma of the brains of protected mice, consistent with previous data suggesting that a DTH response was responsible for protection. Immunohistochemical studies suggested further that virus was not replicating in the ependyma or cellular infiltrate, but that the presence of the T cell clone prevented neuronal infection. While the mechanism of effectively altering the in vivo cellular tropism is unknown, survival is accompanied by increased specific destruction of target tissues with fulminant CNS demyelination and an increased incidence of persistent infection.",

A number of viral infections induce primary demyelination in experimental animals (Martin and Nathanson 1979) . One model system that has been studied extensively is the JHM strain of mouse hepatitis virus (JHMV) infection of mice. JHMV is a member of the coronaviridae family of enveloped RNA viruses. In general, these viruses produce acute disease via direct cellular cytolysis. These viruses infect a wide range of animal hosts, including man, and cause a variety of chronic diseases by virtue of their ability to persist in different tissues (Wege et al. 1984) . In humans, this group of viruses represents one of the etiological agents causing the common cold; however, it also has been associated with acute gastroenteritis in infants and multiple sclerosis (Wege et al. 1984) .",

Although the exact outcome of JHMV infection depends on a number of these variables, the general pathological picture of an acute encephalomyelitis with primary demyelination due to a cytolytic infection of oligodendroglia is preserved. The CNS pathology of the acute JHMV infection in mice was initially described by Bailey et al. (1949) and has subsequently been described by numerous investigators (Lampert et al. 1973; Nagashima et al. 1978; Erlich and Fleming 1985) . The pathology of chronic infection with JHMV has been less well documented but in general consists of focal areas of primary demyelination in the CNS lasting more than one year after the acute infection (Erlich et al. 1987) .",

The antiviral antibody response has been implicated as one protective mechanism because early passive immunization with both neutralizing and non-neutralizing monoclonal antibodies prevents death due to JHMV (Buchmeier et al. 1984; Wege et al. 1984; Nakanaga et al. 1986; Fleming et al. 1989 ). However, antibodymediated protection from a lethal infection does not result from suppression of virus replication in the CNS, and the extent of demyelination is increased (Buchmeier et al. 1984) . It was therefore suggested that antibody prevented death by altering the local environment within the CNS, preventing or minimizing the infection of neurons, which would be more likely to result in death than the infection of oligodendroglial cells (Buchmeier et al. 1984 ). This concept is consistent with recent data showing that variants of JHMV infect primarily oligodendroglial cells and cause severe acute demyelination with little or no evidence of encephalomyelitis or neuronal infection (Fleming et al. 1986 . These variants also replicate in the CNS to essentially the same extent as lethal strains of JHMV (Fleming et al. 1986 .",

A macrophage has been implicated in the natural resistance of SJL mice to JHMV infection (Stohlman et al. 1980) ; however, in vitro analysis of macrophage-mediated antiviral activity was unable to substantiate either a direct or indirect role for macrophages in suppressing virus replication (Stohlman et al. 1982) .",

            "text": "To better understand the role of cell-mediated immunity during JHMV infection, JHMV-specific T lymphocyte clones were isolated and characterized (Woodward et al. 1984) . These clones proliferate in vitro in response to the E2 virion major envelope glycoprotein in an I-A restricted manner and have the cell surface phenotype Thy-1 +, Lyt-1 +, CD4 + . They induce an I-A restricted local delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) response in vivo, indicating they are of the DTH-inducer phenotype (Woodward et al. 1984) . In addition all four clones tested secrete gamma-interferon and interleukin-2 suggesting they are of the Thl subset (Mosman and Coffman 1987) . Adoptive transfer of these T cell clones prevents an otherwise lethal JHMV infection . Preliminary experiments indicate that these cells can be transferred up to 4 days prior to infection and still provide protection to recipients (unpublished observation). This suggests that the clones may survive in vivo for 4 days. Similar to the results of antibody-mediated protection (Buchmeier et al. 1984) , these DTH-inducer T cell clones did not suppress virus growth in the CNS of protected mice ). This suggests that the antiviral immune response to JHMV may have at least 2 distinct components, one that prevents death during the acute phase of the infection and a separate component(s) that eliminates infectious virus from the CNS. In this paper, we have carefully compared the pathological changes in the CNS of mice succumbing to JHMV infection to those in mice protected from the lethal phase of the disease by the adoptive transfer of a DTH-inducer T cell clone to better understand the mechanism of protection afforded by the induction of a virus-specific DTH response in the CNS, especially as it relates to the establishment of a latent CNS infection with chronic demyelination.",

We have previously shown that the replication of JHMV in the CNS is not decreased in the protected mice ). Sections were examined for the distribution of JHMV antigen to determine if the adoptive transfer of the DTH inducer T cells had altered the distribution of infected cells or if the virus present in the CNS of protected mice was due to replication in the infiltrating monocytes. In both untreated and protected mice at day 7, viral antigen was present in neurons (Fig. 3A) and glia (Fig. 3B ) as previously described (Fleming et al. 1986 ). At day 10, viral antigen was also found in glia in both groups and in neurons of the untreated mice (Fig. 3C) ; however, no viral antigen was found in neurons of the JHMVT group. Viral antigen was not detected in either the ependyma or in the cellular infiltrates in either group of mice. In addition, cells in the periventricular white matter having small round nuclei characteristic of oligodendrocytes were found to be positive for JHMV antigen at day 50 in the JHMVT group. This is consistent with previous reports of persistent JHMV in the CNS of mice surviving the acute disease (Erlleh and Fleming 1986). Large PAP positive amorphous clumps were also found in the corpus callosum at this time point (Fig. 3D) . Otherwise, no antigen was identified in either neurons or glia during the chronic phase of the infection, i.e., after day 50. ",

The data in this paper show that the adoptive transfer of DTH inducer T cell clones results in an acute DTH response in the CNS of infected mice coincident with the appearance of viral antigen. However, the major components of the DTH response, i.e., the mononuclear cell infiltration, cytokines, lymphokines and breakdown of vascular permeability are antigen-nonspecific effector mechanisms (Liew 1982) . We have recently addressed the role of these nonspecific effector mechanisms by inducing DTH responses to antigens other than JHMV in the CNS of infected mice (Stohlman et al. 1988) . We demonstrated that the presence of a vigorous DTH response in the CNS was not able to alter the pathogenesis of a lethal JHMV infection, suggesting that these antigen-nonspecific cells and mediators are not sufficient for protection.",

We have previously shown that JHMV will replicate in macrophages, including activated macrophages such as those elicited during the DTH response (Stohlman et al. 1982 ). Therefore, it was important to determine if the infectious virus recovered from the CNS of protected mice was derived from CNS cellular components or from the infiltrating mononuclear ceils. The data clearly show no evidence of virus replioation in the perivascular mononuelear cells, which comprise the majority of the DTH responding cells.",

            "text": "Protection from a lethal JHMV infection can also be mediated by the passive transfer ofmonoclonal antibodies specific for all 3 virus structural proteins (Buchmeier et al. 1984; Wege et al. 1984; Nakanaga et al. 1986; Fleming et al. 1989) . Virus nonneutralizing antibodies protect just as well as antibodies that can neutralize infectivity in vitro (Wege et al. 1986 ). Although the mechanism of protection is not clear, even in those instances where neutralizing antibodies have been examined they do not exert their protective effect by suppressing the quantity of infectious JHMV present in the CNS of infected mice (Buchmeier et al. 1984) . It has been suggested that protection is due to an alteration in target cell populations infected by the virus. Neurons are clearly infected in unprotected mice, while oligodendroglia are the cells infected predominant in mice receiving passively transferred anti-JHMV antibody (Buchmeier et al. 1984 ). Although we have previously shown that there is no difference in either the antiviral IgM and IgG responses in mice protected via the adoptive transfer of the virus-specific T cell clones , the data presented here show that the number of neurons infected at day 10 in the JHMVT mice was markedly reduced, if not altogether absent, compared to the control mice undergoing a lethal infection. Although the mechanism that alters the infection of neurons is unclear, in both the case of antibody and DTH inducer T cell mediated protection, immunomodulation clearly alters the effective tropism of JHMV for specific cells in the CNS. In both instances this results in a florid demyelination and paralysis without death of the mice. In addition, there was little or no change in the amount of infectious virus in the CNS compared to mice undergoing a lethal infection involving neurons. Taken together these data suggest that alteration of the specific virus-cell interaction, either by modulating the expression of the virus receptor or via immune therapy, leads to a circumstance in which the animals survive the lethal effects of the virus. However, protected mice exhibit increased evidence of demyelination and a propensity for chronic CNS viral infection.",
