As the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19 spread throughout the United States in early 2020, the federal government issued social distancing recommendations but left to the states the most difficult and consequential decisions restricting behavior, such as canceling events, closing schools and businesses, and issuing stay-at-home orders. We present an original dataset of state-level social distancing policy responses to the epidemic and explore how political partisanship, COVID-19 caseload, and policy diffusion explain the timing of governors' decisions to mandate social distancing. An event history analysis of five social distancing policies across all fifty states reveals the most important predictors are political: all else equal, Republican governors and governors from states with more Trump supporters were slower to adopt social distancing policies. These delays are likely to produce significant, on-going harm to public health. for helpful comments and suggestions, and Erika Steiskal for graphic design assistance.

(4) Broad public mandates for social distancing are also vital to help manage a key multiplier of COVID-19 fatality rates: a substantial fraction of patients require lengthy (on average 8 bed days) intensive care unit (ICU) support to survive acute respiratory distress, and uncontrolled spread of the disease is expected to generate at its peak far greater demand for ICU care than existing capacity can meet.(5; 2; 6) Public health experts have pleaded with officials to quickly mandate social distancing to flatten the curve of coronavirus infections -that is, reduce the peak caseload -before exponential case growth leads to hundreds of thousands or millions of deaths. In particular, it is important to keep peak levels low to prevent the fatality rate from rising to the levels seen in areas where hospitals are overwhelmed with cases. (7) In the United States, the emergence of the coronavirus has created a natural experiment in which elected officials face incredibly urgent and far-reaching policy decisions for which they typically have no personal experience or expertise, and for which the history of policy examples is either mere days old, or so dated as to be largely unknown except by public health experts. The most significant policy decisions of this kindboth in terms of their potential to mitigate the epidemic and their economic consequences -are mandates for social distancing through restrictions on public gatherings; closure or restriction of schools, restaurants, and other non-essential businesses; and orders for the public to stay at home. (8) Under the federal and state constitutions, the key actions fall to executives, and particularly to governors, whose powers in public health emergencies are typically singular and extensive.",

Even if the true doubling time of infections prior to social distancing is as long as a week, delaying these measures just three days would, all else equal, raise the eventual peak number of cases by more than 30%, potentially increasing total deaths by thousands or more in a given state.",

            "text": "Evidence from the 1918 influenza pandemic underscores the stakes for elected officials. In that earlier natural experiment, American cities faced similar decisions regarding social distancing policies. For example, Philadelphia decided to hold a parade welcoming soldiers returning from World War I, while St. Louis cancelled its parade, and ultimately experienced one eighth as many deaths per capita during that wave of influenza. The height of the infection in Saint Louis was two months later than in Philadelphia, and was far lower, with deaths peaking at fifty per hundred thousand rather than 250 per hundred thousand.(11; 12) Shortly after community transmission of the coronavirus was discovered in Washington and California in late February 2020, public health experts drew the comparison between Philadelphia and Saint Louis, hoping to inspire policymakers to promote social distancing. Nevertheless, in an echo of the decisions made a century before, there are significant differences in the timing of governors' decisions to mandate social distancing. For instance, on 6 March 2020, after Kentucky had its first confirmed case of COVID-19, Governor Andy Beshear (D) immediately called a state of emergency, encouraged social distancing, and closed bars and restaurants ten days later. But when neighboring Tennesse uncovered its first confirmed case of COVID-19 on March 5th, Governor Bill Lee (R) waited until 12 March to declare a state of emergency and finally closed restaurants and bars on 22 March. (13) Why did governors' responses to a sudden, shared threat differ? Under normal circumstances, governors' policy decisions are shaped by the national leaders and agenda of their political party and the demands of their own constituents, particularly those in their partisan base. Governors may also look to innovative peers and neighbors for examples to follow. But the fast-moving nature of the coronavirus threat, the need to rely on experts to understand complex scientific material, and uncertainty about the nature and scope of the threat might scramble all or some of these usual motivations. pandemic politics \u00b7 Adolph, Amano, Bang-Jensen, Fullman & Wilkerson The public health case for mandatory social distancing in the United States developed quickly in the wake of the first reports of community transmission on 26 February in Washington state. One might expect social distancing measures to quickly follow across the fifty states, perhaps more quickly in states with greater number of confirmed cases. But mandating social distancing is a difficult decision for any political leader. If these measures are successful in preventing widespread mortality, many members of the public who suffered the costs of these mandates may never fully comprehend the benefits. Indeed, the more successful the intervention, the more likely it will appear to many as an \"overreaction.\" Moreover, some states faced higher potential costs from these policies: closing schools is more painful in states where more children depend on schools for subsidized lunches and shutting restaurants and public places is more difficult in states highly dependent on tourism. (14) More generally, states with more limited economic resources are likely far less able to weather the deprivations caused by economic shutdowns, or to expand social insurance protections during mandated social distancing, and thus may be considerably more reluctant to take these steps.",

Numerous surveys have found significant partisan divides in public opinion about the severity of the coronavirus threat. (15; 16) Countering the message from public health leaders, the White House downplayed COVID-19. On 4 March 2020, President Trump insisted that COVID-19 was similar to the flu; two days later, he falsely claimed the situation in Italy was improving, and that the US was handling coronavirus much better than other industrialized countries. As late as 15 March 2020, with reported cases rising rapidly, Trump still maintained that the epidemic within the US was under control.(17) Similar messages filled news sources relied on by Republican voters. Fox Business host Trish Reagan insisted the pandemic warnings were a Democratic hoax and another effort to impeach the President, while Sean Hannity, another Fox News personality, validated the conspiracy theory that coronavirus was an effort by the \"deep state\" to \"manipulate markets, suppress dissent and push mandated medicines.\" (18) For governors already reluctant to impose draconian measures, this messaging both provided cover for inaction and may have reduced public support, particularly among Republican voters. And as social distancing measures have spread, Republican leaders, including Trump, have been more vocal in their desire to quickly rollback these measures to restore the economy.",

At the time of first community transmission in the US, virologists including Trevor Bedford suggested this strain had been circulating in Washington state since mid-January.

First, we expect much of the effect of these emergency measures on social behavior to be immediate. The state's power to compel socially responsible behavior is often said to act through \"quasi-voluntary compliance,\" in which most citizens choose pro-social behaviors given a cue from the state that is backed with the threat of sanction. (21) This effect should be all the stronger to the extent people treat costly social distancing measures as a credible signal of the viral threat. Second, our focus is on predicting the timing of governor's actions, which naturally points to announcement dates, rather than implementation dates which may be delayed (in the case of school closures, for example), by weekends and spring breaks. Figure 1 displays the timing of different states' adoptions of these five social distancing policies over the four-week study period. No state acted before 10 March, a full thirteen days after the first report of community transmission, yet by 15 March, uptake was rapid across states. In general, states typically started social distancing through recommendations or restrictions on public gatherings, then turned to restrictions on schools 2 We include recommendations in this category for two reasons: first, this was often the first action states took, and early actors did not always revisit these policies with a restrictive mandate; second, the target of these measures was typically large events that would be unlikely to maintain viable attendance under the cloud of a state recommendation to cancel events.",

This is the well-known hazard ratio, a common summary of event history models. Second, we use our estimated model to simulate the average delay each factor would cause if it were present in each state.

The policy diffusion literature suggests different ways to determine each state's \"peer group.\" Because the coronavirus spreads spatially, we focus on actions by neighboring states, and estimate the likelihood a state will implement a specific kind of social distancing as a function of the percentage of contiguous states also mandating that policy. We find that a state with no neighbors adopting a given policy was 32.0% (95% CI: 8.4 to 50.8) less likely to adopt it than a state with 50% or more of its neighbors adopting that policy. This corresponds to a delay of 1.20 days (95% CI: 1.13 to 1.26). Investigation of other possible mechanisms -including policy diffusion based on the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in neighboring states or based on the actions of peers a given state typically looks to for policy innovations -failed to uncover additional patterns of diffusion. We speculate that actions by neighboring states may grant cover to governors to take similar actions.(28)",

Indeed, Republican voters were more concerned about Ebola during Obama's presidency than they were about COVID-19 under Trump. (38) Second, all humans have difficulty accurately assessing risks that are small but not zero. (39; 40) In this case, Republican voters were more likely than Democrats to incorrectly assume that the COVID-19 fatality rate and disease burden was effectively the same as the flu.(15) Third, partisans' worldviews are shaped by cues provided by their leaders. (34) In the early stages of the US pandemic, President Trump strongly signaled in press conference and on social media that the coronavirus was an exaggerated threat or even a hoax, a position that was magnified and reinforced by Republican-leaning media outlets. Finally, Republican officials almost surely considered the possibility of reprisals -both to their political careers and discretionary federal assistance to their states -from a president who frequently attacks members of his own party that he perceives to be disloyal.

Some experts contend that authorities will need to alternate between two months of social distancing and one month of restored freedoms to reduce the likelihood that health systems are overwhelmed by severe cases until a vaccine is developed, produced, and circulated. (3; 44) This implies state governments will be asked to impose difficult social distancing policies not once, but many times. Each instance will be a test of whether states can act promptly to prevent COVID-19 cases from peaking at unmanageable levels. If Republican governors and states with Republican majorities continue to lag behind, the cumulative impact on those states, and on the country as whole through spillovers, could be vast. Baseline hazards are stratified across the five pooled social distancing measures: recommendations and restrictions on gatherings, school closures, restaurant restrictions, non-essential business closures, and stay-at-home orders. Each row shows the hazard ratio for (the counterfactual change in) the covariate listed at the left. Counterfactual changes are chosen to simplify comparison of hazard ratios for covariates with different scales of measurement. Covariates with both 95% confidence limits below 1.0 significantly reduce the chance of adopting an additional social distancing measure. Standard errors used to compute confidence intervals are clustered by state. The concordance index shows the proportion of all pairs of states for which the model correctly predicts which state will adopt a given social distancing mandate first. Schoenfeld residuals show no evidence of violation of proportionality for any covariate. The Efron method is used to resolve ties.",
