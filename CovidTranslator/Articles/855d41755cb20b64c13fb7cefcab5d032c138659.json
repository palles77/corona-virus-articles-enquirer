The values differ from earlier reports principally in higher values for total bilirubin, creatine kinase, and more particularly of total plasma and serum proteins .

The high values are presumed to result from muscle damage, a consequence of the problems of capture and restraint of farmed sows . Comparably high values have been recorded in periparturient sows (reported in Tumbleson et at, 1986) , in experimental young pigs subjected to constraint in slings (James et al., 1987) , and in pigs after experimental exercise (Doize et at, 1989) .

This suggests higher immunoglobulin concentrations, which was confirmed by serum protein electrophoresis (Fig . 3 , Table IV ) . The gamma-globulin concentrations were higher than those previously reported (Blood et al., 1983 ; Tumbleson et al, 1986 ), but showed no age dependency in the age range sampled . Data reviewed in Tumbleson et al. (1986) supports the suggestion that swine 1 year old or more show higher serum total protein than younger animals . The 1-year-old stock described by Reese et al. (1984) have lower protein levels, but were specific pathogen free . Friendship et al. (1984) , studying pigs from weaning to maturity, observed serum protein values that increased with age, adult sows showing ranges similar to those that we describe . Thus, although our protein reference ranges differ markedly from those in current use, they may be considered as more appropriate values for conventionally managed sows .",
