However, it is unclear how pDCs regulate the antiviral responses via innate and adaptive immune cells. We generated diphtheria toxin receptor transgenic mice to selectively deplete pDCs by administration of diphtheria toxin. pDC-depleted mice were challenged with viruses known to activate pDCs. In murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) infection, pDC depletion reduced early IFN-I production and augmented viral burden facilitating the expansion of natural killer (NK) cells expressing the MCMV-specific receptor Ly49H. During vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) infection, pDC depletion enhanced early viral replication and impaired the survival and accumulation of virusspecific cytotoxic T lymphocytes. We conclude that pDCs mediate early antiviral IFN-I responses and influence the accrual of virus-specific NK or CD8 + T cells in a virus-dependent manner.",

IFN-I confer resistance to viral infections and promote apoptosis of virally infected cells (Garc\u00eda-Sastre and Honda et al., 2005c; Pestka et al., 2004) . Moreover, IFN-I promote natural killer (NK) cell, dendritic cell (DC), T cell, and B cell functions (Banchereau and Pascual, 2006; Garc\u00eda-Sastre and Biron, 2006; Kolumam et al., 2005; Le Bon and Tough, 2008) .

            "text": "Besides producing IFN-I, pDCs may contribute to antiviral defense through additional mechanisms. pDCs express major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules and costimulatory molecules, and therefore may directly present viral antigens to CD4 + T cells and cross-present viral antigens to CD8 + T cells (Villadangos and Young, 2008) . In addition, pDCs are a source of proinflammatory chemokines, including CCL3, CCL4, CCL5, CXCL9, and CXCL10, which can attract activated CD4 + and CD8 + T cells to sites of infection (Sozzani et al., 2010) . pDCs also secrete interleukin-12 (IL-12), contributing to T helper 1 (Th1) cell polarization of CD4 + T cells (Asselin-Paturel et al., 2001; Cella et al., 2000) . Additionally, pDCs can directly kill virus-infected cells through FasL-and tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis inducing ligand (TRAIL)-dependent mechanisms (Chaperot et al., 2006; Hardy et al., 2007) . pDCs detect RNA and DNA viruses through two endosomal sensors, Toll-like receptors (TLR) 7 and TLR9, which induce secretion of IFN-I through the MyD88-interferon regulatory factor 7 (IRF7) signaling pathway (Blasius and Beutler, 2010; Honda et al., 2005a; Pichlmair and Reis e Sousa, 2007; Takeuchi and Akira, 2009 ; Thompson and Iwasaki, 2008) . Viruses reach TLR7 and TLR9 via receptor-mediated endocytosis or transport of cytosolic replication intermediates into endosomes by autophagy (Thompson and Iwasaki, 2008; Wang et al., 2007) . Various DNA and RNA viruses activate pDCs (Borrow and Bhardwaj, 2008; Cervantes-Barragan et al., 2007; Delale et al., 2005; Diebold et al., 2004; Jung et al., 2008; Krug et al., 2004a Krug et al., , 2004b Steinberg et al., 2009; Thompson and Iwasaki, 2008; Yoneyama et al., 2005; Zucchini et al., 2008) without the need for viral replication (Kumagai et al., 2009) . Moreover, TLR7-, TLR9-, MyD88-, and IRF7-deficient mice fail to secrete sufficient IFN-I after certain viral infections, resulting in increased viral replication and mortality in comparison to wild-type mice Honda et al., 2005b; Steinberg et al., 2009; Thompson and Iwasaki, 2008; Zucchini et al., 2008) . However, it is not clear whether pDCs are primarily responsible for TLR7-or TLR9-MyD88-IRF7-mediated antiviral responses in vivo. Moreover, whether pDCs impact the control of viral infection via mechanisms other than IFN-I in vivo is poorly understood.",

Moreover, the BST-2 Ag is expressed on pDCs and plasma cells in naive mice but is induced on most cell types after stimulation with IFN-I or IFN-\u03b3 (Blasius et al., 2006b) .

Administration of diphtheria toxin (DT) to these mice resulted in an almost complete and selective depletion of pDCs. pDC-depleted mice were challenged with representative DNA and RNA viruses, murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV), and vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), respectively. Our results demonstrated that pDCs provide an immediate but limited source of IFN-I that restricts viral burden only in the very early phase of infection. Lack of pDC-mediated containment of MCMV resulted in the increased expansion of NK cells expressing the Ly49H receptor. In contrast, during VSV infection, pDC depletion reduced the amplitude of primary CD8 + T cell responses resulting from impaired survival of virus-specific cytotoxic T cells (CTLs). Thus, pDCs impact virus-specific NK cell or CD8 + T cell responses in a fashion that is dependent on the infecting agent.",

Administration of DT to CD11c-DTR Tg mice selectively eliminates CD11c hi classical DCs. Emulating this approach, we generated Tg mice that express DTR under the blood dendritic cell antigen 2 (BDCA-2) promoter. BDCA-2 is a Ctype lectin that is exclusively expressed by human pDCs (Gilliet et al., 2008) . Although BDCA-2 is not encoded in mouse, we assumed that its promoter contains target sequences for pDC-specific transcription factors that might be conserved across species. Indeed, this assumption was correct; the transcription factor E2-2, which is a specific regulator of pDC development in mouse and human, was subsequently shown to interact with elements in the BDCA-2 promoter (Cisse et al., 2008) . Therefore, we generated a BDCA2-DTR Tg mouse on a C57BL/6 background in which pDCs were systemically depleted with high efficiency and specificity 24 hr after DT administration ( Figure 1 ). The DT-induced depletion persisted for 2 to 3 days; however, pDCs could be depleted for longer periods with repeated DT administration. The depletion efficiency in blood, spleen, liver, and lymph nodes was approximately 90% 24-48 hr after DT treatment (data not shown). To further demonstrate that DT specifically depletes pDCs, BDCA2-DTR Tg mice were bred to SiglecH-eGFP (enhanced green fluorescent protein) gene-targeted mice ( Figure S1A available online). In these mice, pDCs expressed high amounts of eGFP, whereas classical DCs expressed low amounts of eGFP ( Figure S1B ). DT administration to BDCA2-DTR Tg \u00d7 SiglecH-eGFP gene-targeted mice resulted in the selective depletion of pDCs whereas classical DCs were left intact ( Figure S1C ). Thus, the BDCA2-DTR Tg mouse is a unique tool to specifically investigate the function of pDCs in a variety of models.",

In DT-treated mice, pDCs were effectively depleted in spleen and liver without having major effects on the total numbers of cells ( Figure S2B-S2D) . Furthermore, we confirmed that DT treatment did not eliminate cells critical for antiviral responses such as virus-specific NK cells and CD8 + T cells during MCMV infection ( Figures S2E and S2F ). On day 3 postinfection (p.i.), viral titers in the spleen were significantly higher in DT-treated mice when a dose of 5 \u00d7 10 4 plaque-forming units (pfu) per mouse was administered whereas no differences were observed at a higher (1 \u00d7 10 5 pfu) dose ( Figure 2A ).

In these experiments, wild-type (WT) MCMV (5 \u00d7 10 4 pfu) as well as MCMV lacking m157 (\u0394m157 MCMV) (1 \u00d7 10 4 pfu) were used to infect mice. Our rationale for using \u0394m157 MCMV is that this virus escapes surveillance by Ly49H + NK cells in C57BL/6 mice (Lanier, 2008) , allowing the evaluation of pDC impact on viral control independently of Ly49H + NK cells. Salivary glands from pDC-depleted mice infected with either WT or \u0394m157 MCMV had significantly elevated viral loads ( Figure 2C ). We also examined the salivary glands from control and pDC-depleted mice infected with 1 \u00d7 10 5 pfu of WT MCMV for 8 days and found no differences in viral titers (data not shown). These results demonstrate that at lower doses of MCMV, the presence of pDCs can limit viral burden in the spleen, liver, and salivary glands. However, at higher inoculi of MCMV, pDCs are not sufficient to control viral loads. The results obtained with \u0394m157 MCMV infection also indicate that pDCs can control MCMV infection independently of Ly49H + NK cells.",

In the early phase of infection, NKcell activation and secretion of IFN-\u03b3 is independent of Ly49H engagement but depends on cytokines. During the later phase of infection, Ly49H + NK cells are selectively activated and proliferate in response to MCMV. After viral clearance, Ly49H + NK cells undergo contraction and generate a population of memory cells (Sun et al., 2009) . To assess the effect of pDCs on NK cell activity in the early phase of infection, we infected pDC-depleted and control mice with MCMV and measured spleen NK cell frequencies, activation, ability to kill target cells, and intracellular IFN-\u03b3 content. The overall frequencies of NK cells in the spleen declined overtime in both groups of mice ( Figure 3A ). At 36 hr p.i., NK cells from pDC-depleted mice had reduced expression of CD69 compared to control mice whereas mice from both groups at 48 hr p.i. expressed similar amounts of CD69 ( Figure 3B ). At 24 hr p.i., NK cells from pDC-depleted mice were less efficient at killing RMA-S target cells ( Figure 3C ). At 36 and 48 hr, this difference in specific lysis was no longer observed between control and pDCdepleted mice. Thus, in the absence of pDCs, activation and cytotoxicity of nonspecific NK cells is impaired very early on during infection.",

At later time points, pDC depletion does not affect the selective expansion and function of Ly49H + NK cells, which are in fact more abundant, most probably as a response to increased viral replication and subsequent engagement of Ly49H by m157.",

Thus, pDCs are the major source of IFN-I during the initial stages of MCMV infection whereas non-pDCs are responsible for the IFN-I produced at later time points (Asselin-Paturel et al., 2001; Dalod et al., 2002 Dalod et al., , 2003 Delale et al., 2005; Scheu et al., 2008) . In addition, pDC-depleted mice had 3-to 4-fold more serum IFN-\u03b3 than nondepleted mice 48 hr p.i. (Figure 4B ), reflecting the increased IFN-\u03b3 production by NK cells and NKT cells. The impact of pDC depletion on IFN-\u03b3 serum concentrations was dependent on the viral inoculum. DT-treated mice infected with low or intermediate doses of WT MCMV had higher concentrations of serum IFN-\u03b3 compared to control mice ( Figure 4C ). DT-treated mice infected with \u0394m157 MCMV also had elevated amounts of serum IFN-\u03b3. In contrast, no differences were apparent when DT-treated mice were infected with 1 \u00d7 10 5 pfu of WT virus. These results corroborate that the role of pDCs in early cytokine responses to MCMV infection is prominent only at low viral inoculi.",

To this end, control and pDC-depleted mice were infected intravenously (i.v.) with VSV-OVA. In control mice, B220 + Siglec-H + spleen pDCs were activated and expressed PDC-TREM as early as 6 hr p.i. PDC-TREM could also be detected on pDCs in the blood, bone marrow, and liver 24 hr p.i. (Figure S4 ). We also measured serum IFN-\u03b1 concentrations and virus titers in the spleen at different time points p.i. In the absence of pDCs, IFN-\u03b1 was reduced at 6 hr p.i. but not at 12 or 24 hr ( Figure 5A ). We also found a significant difference in viral loads between control and pDC-depleted mice at 6 hr p.i., whereas it was difficult to detect VSV-OVA in the periphery after 24 hr ( Figure 5B and data not shown).

Quantification of these two chemokines in the serum of VSV-OVA-infected mice revealed that both groups of mice produced CCL3 and CCL4 (data not shown and Figure 7A ); however, there was a significant reduction in serum CCL4 in pDC-depleted mice 24 hr p.i. To assess whether the reduction in CCL4 affected the recruitment of Agspecific CD8 + T cells, we examined the frequencies of adoptively transferred OT-I cells in spleens at early time points p.i. in control and pDC-depleted mice and compared them to that of naive mice. At 6 hr p.i., the frequencies of OT-I cells in control and pDC-depleted mice were comparable to uninfected mice, indicating that recruitment of Ag-specific CD8 + T cells was not impaired. At 22 hr p.i., the frequencies of OT-I began to decline and this reduction was more pronounced in pDC-depleted mice compared to PBS controls ( Figure 7B ), suggesting that pDCs may impact the survival of Ag-specific CD8 + T cells.",

At 9 hr p.i., the frequencies of OT-I begin to decline in the DLN of VSV-OVA-infected mice but not in the DLN of VSV-infected mice. At 25 hr p.i., the reduction in frequencies was even more dramatic in VSV-OVA-infected mice, suggesting that OT-I cells do in fact undergo Ag-induced apoptosis. To corroborate this finding, we evaluated the apoptosis of adoptively transferred OT-I cells in spleens of control or pDCdepleted mice infected i.v. with VSV-OVA by using Annexin V and CaspACE FITC-VAD-FMK (which binds to activated caspase). As anticipated, more apoptotic Ag-specific CD8 + T cells were evident in pDC-depleted mice, especially at 66 hr p.i. (Figure 7D ).

We first showed that pDCs can be almost entirely and specifically depleted in these mice, providing an optimal experimental system to evaluate pDC functions in vivo. This experimental model appears to be superior to depleting antibodies, because the available antibodies also recognize non-pDCs, potentially depleting other cells involved in immune responses. Cross-reactivity is particularly problematic when BST-2 antibodies are used during viral infections, because BST-2 is upregulated on a wide variety of cells in response to IFNs (Blasius et al., 2006b) , resulting in their depletion. Although Siglec-H is predominately expressed on pDCs (Blasius et al., 2006a; Zhang et al., 2006) , SiglecH-eGFP gene-targeted mice exhibited eGFP expression not only in pDCs but also in classical DCs, suggesting that the promoter of BDCA-2 is more suitable than that of Siglec-H to selectively drive gene expression in pDCs.",

We demonstrated that pDCs are essential for the production of IFN-I only during the initial stages of MCMV infection, which is in agreement with a study by Delale et al. (2005) . Additionally, we found that the impact of pDC depletion on anti-MCMV responses is highly dependent on initial viral dose, demonstrating that the antiviral capacity of pDCs is limited. Because defects in IFN-I or MyD88 signaling (Dalod et al., 2002 (Dalod et al., , 2003 Delale et al., 2005; Krug et al., 2004a; Steinberg et al., 2009; Zucchini et al., 2008) have more profound impacts on anti-MCMV control than does pDC depletion, we conclude that pDCs account only in part for the antiviral responses mediated by IFN-I and MyD88 signaling and other cells must be involved. CD11b + DCs are also capable of producing IFN-I and activating NK cells in a TLR-independent manner after infection with MCMV (Andoniou et al., 2005) . In addition, both TLR3 and TLR2 pathways, which are not operating in pDCs, have been implicated in the secretion of IFN-I during MCMV infection (Barbalat et al., 2009; Szomolanyi-Tsuda et al., 2006; Tabeta et al., 2004) .",

Therefore, pDCs might play a critical role in containing naturally spreading viral infections in physiological settings. Furthermore, the inability of pDCs to augment antiviral responses when higher MCMV doses are administered may be due to their limited numbers in infected organs, such as spleen, liver, and salivary glands. However, pDCs may be able to control higher viral loads during human infections such as varicella zoster virus, hepatitisCvirus, and molluscum contagiosum virus, which cause considerable accumulation of pDCs at sites of infection (Sozzani et al., 2010) .",

            "text": "Previous studies have shown that pDCs activate NK cells, suggesting that pDCs control viral spreading and replication indirectly through NK cell-mediated killing of MCMV-infected cells. In our study we evaluated the impact of pDC depletion on the control of \u0394m157 MCMV, which escapes surveillance by Ly49H + NK cells (Lanier, 2008) , and found that pDCs contribute to the control of MCMV independently of Ly49H + NK cells. Thus, IFN-I released by pDCs controls MCMV replication directly by inducing an antiviral state in other cells. As previously reported, we confirmed that pDCs also induce NK cell activation, but only during the early nonspecific phase of the NK cell response. In contrast, pDCs were not required for activation of MCMV-specific Ly49H + NK cells, which in fact were more frequent in pDC-depleted mice. This expansion of Ly49H + cells is most probably a consequence of increased viral titers and thus may compensate for the lack of pDCs and their ability to control viral replication. Accordingly, mice lacking IFN-I signaling exhibit preferential expansion of Ly49H + cells (Geurs et al., 2009 ). pDC depletion resulted in an increased frequency of IFN-\u03b3-producing NK cells and NKT cells in the spleen and liver, as wellas increased serum concentrations of IL-12p70 and production of IL-12 by classical DCs. Previous studies in interferon alpha receptor (IFNAR) gene-targeted mice and mice depleted of pDCs with antibodies have demonstrated that IFN-I signaling in classical DCs reduces IL-12 production during MCMV infection (Dalod et al., 2002 (Dalod et al., , 2003 . Our data corroborate a cross-talk between pDCs and DCs such that pDCreleased IFN-I limits IL-12 production by DCs and consequently IFN-\u03b3 production by NK cells and NKT cells. However, the impact of pDC depletion on systemic IL-12 was not as strong as that induced by blockade of IFN-I signaling, indicating that pDCs are only one of the sources of IFN-I that contribute to the control of the IL-12-IFN-\u03b3 axis.",

            "text": "Infection of BDCA2-DTR mice with VSV indicated a role for pDCs in the very early production of IFN-I and control of viral burden. Moreover, pDCs promoted the accumulation of Ag-specific CD8 + T cells, unveiling an important function of pDCs in adaptive immune responses. This pDC function may explain the delayed accumulation of T cells in the bronchoalveolar space of Ikzf1 L/L mice infected with influenza (Wolf et al., 2009 ) and the defective CTL responses against HSV-1 infection in pDC-depleted mice (Yoneyama et al., 2005) . We explored several mechanisms by which pDCs may promote CTL accumulation. We noticed that pDC depletion resulted in a significant reduction in serum concentrations of CCL4, which attracts CTLs to priming sites. However, pDC depletion had no clear impact on the recruitment of adoptively transferred Ag-specific CTLs. Although pDCs have been implicated in Ag presentation in several models (Villadangos and Young, 2008) , pDCs did not present Ag in VSV-OVA infection nor increase the Ag-presenting capacity of classical DCs. Instead we found that pDCs promoted the survival of Ag-specific CTLs. Because pDCs limit viral replication early in VSV-OVA infection, CTL survival may be explained by reduced activation-induced apoptosis. Additionally, pDCs may promote CTL survival through soluble factors such as IFN-I (Kolumam et al., 2005; Marrack and Kappler, 2004) .",

However, pDCmediated accumulation of CTLs may be essential in the control of other experimental infections, such as murine hepatitis virus (MHV), herpes simplex virus 2 (HSV-2), and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), in which pDC depletion impairs host antiviral responses (Cervantes-Barragan et al., 2007; Smit et al., 2006; Thompson and Iwasaki, 2008; Wang et al., 2006) . In conclusion, analysis of MCMV and VSV infections in our newly generated BDCA2-DTR Tg mice demonstrates that pDCs provide an early and transient source of IFN-I that partially controls viral replication. This pDC-mediated control of viral burden impacts the accrual of virus-specific NK cells or CD8 + T cells in a virus-dependent manner.",
