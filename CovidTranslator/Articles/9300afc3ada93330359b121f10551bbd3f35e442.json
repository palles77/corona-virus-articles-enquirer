            "text": "One of the reasons for the fast spread of SARS-CoV-2 is the lack of accuracy in detection tools in the clinical field. Molecular techniques, such as quantitative real-time RT-PCR and nucleic acid sequencing methods, are widely used to identify pathogens. For this particular virus, however, they have an overall unsatisfying detection rate, due to its relatively recent emergence and still not completely understood features. In addition, SARS-CoV-2 is remarkably similar to other Coronaviruses, and it can present with other respiratory infections, making identification even harder. To tackle this issue, we propose an assisted detection test, combining molecular testing with deep learning. The proposed approach employs a state-of-the-art deep convolutional neural network, able to automatically create features starting from the genome sequence of the virus.",

From a dataset of 553 complete genome non-repeated sequences that vary from 1,260 to 31,029 bps in length, the proposed approach classifies the different coronaviruses with an average ac-: bioRxiv preprint curacy of 98.75% in a 10-fold cross-validation, identifying SARS-CoV-2 with an AUC of 98%, specificity of 0.9939 and sensitivity of 1.00 in a binary classification. Then, using the same basis, we classify SARS-CoV-2 from 384 complete viral genome sequences with human host, that contain the gene ORF1ab from the NCBI with a 10-fold accuracy of 98.17% , a specificity of 0.9797 and sensitivity of 1.00. Furthermore, an in-depth analysis of the results allow us to identify base pairs sequences that are unique to SARS-CoV-2 and do not appear in other virus strains, that could then be used as a base for designing new primers and examined by experts to extract further insights. These preliminary results seem encouraging enough to identify deep learning as a promising research venue to develop assisted detection tests for SARS-CoV-2. At this end the interaction between viromics and deep learning, will hopefully help to solve global infection problems. In addition, we offer our code and processed data to be used for diagnostic purposes by medical doctors, virologists and scientists involved in solving the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. As more data become available we will update our system.",

In addition, SARS-CoV-2 has an estimated mortality rate of 3-4%, and it is spreading faster than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV [8] . SARS-CoV-2 assays can yield false positives if they are not targeted specifically to SARS-CoV-2, as the virus is closely related to other Coronavirus organisms. In addition, SARS-CoV-2 may present 25 with other respiratory infections, which make it even more difficult to identify [9, 10] . Thus, it is fundamental to improve existing diagnostic tools to contain the spread. For example, diagnostic tools combining computed tomography (CT) scans with deep learning have been proposed, achieving an improved detection accuracy of 82.9% [11] . Another solution for identifying SARS-CoV-2 30 is additional sequencing of the viral complementary DNA (cDNA). We can use sequencing data with cDNA, resulting from the PCR of the original viral RNA; e,g, Real-Time PCR amplicons ( Fig. 1 ) to identify the SARS-CoV-2 [12] .",

In this specific case, the new features are 165 specific sequences of base pairs that can more easily separate different virus strains (Fig. 12) . By analyzing the result of each filter in a convolutional layer, and how its output interacts with the corresponding max pooling layer, it is possible to detect human-readable sequences of base pairs that might provide domain experts with important information. It is important to notice that 170 these sequences are not bound to specific locations of the genome; thanks to its structure, the CNN is able to detect them and recognize their importance even if their position is displaced in different samples. For this purpose, we use the trained CNN described in Subsection 2.2, that obtained an accuracy of 98.75% in a 10-fold cross-validation. In a first step, 175 we plot the inputs and outputs of the convolutional layer, to visually inspect for patterns.

In SARS-CoV, this gene encodes a protein of 274 aa, that is related with 260 necrotic cell death [38] , chemokine production, inflammatory response [39] and may play an important role in virus life cycle [40] . With this information, we design a specific primer set for detection of SARS-CoV-2 using Primer3plus [41] .",
