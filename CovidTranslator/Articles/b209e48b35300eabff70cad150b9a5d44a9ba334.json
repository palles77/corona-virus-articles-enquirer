Leukocytes develop in the bone marrow from pluripotent and committed stem cells influenced by interleukins and colony-stimulating factors (Raskin, 1996) . Pluripotent stem cells provide a reserve compartment for hematopoietic cell (i.e., leukocyte, erythrocyte, platelet) production if bone marrow has been severely damaged by toxins, drugs, infectious agents, or radiation (Figure 4 -2). Pluripotent stem cells are found in both bone marrow and blood. They may affect repopulation of the bone marrow after a severe insult, provided proper stromal cells and growth factors are present. The number of pluripotent stem cells decreases with age, so younger animals generally have a better chance of restoring bone marrow function than do aged adults.",

The bone marrow cells are divided into the mitotic, maturation, and storage pools (see text). Neutrophils in blood are either in the circulating pool, which is sampled by a complete blood count (CBC), or the marginal pool, which is hidden from sampling via the CBC. Neutrophils move in one direction into the tissues, where they can be evaluated by cytology or histopathology. (Modified from Boggs DR, Winkelstein A: White cell manual, ed 3, Philadelphia, 1975, FA Davis.) The following discussion of bone marrow leukocyte production emphasizes production of neutrophils. Cellular \"pools\" are used to conceptualize the \"location\" of neutrophils within the bone marrow and blood and to simplify interpretation of bone marrow and CBC data (Figure 4-3) . Bone marrow is divided into two pools: The first, the mitotic pool of myeloblasts, promyelocytes, and myelocytes, provides a steady supply of neutrophils to meet tissue demand for these cells. The second pool is maturation and storage, which consists of metamyelocytes, bands, and segmenters that lack mitotic ability. These cells undergo progressive maturation and provide a reserve of segs to meet increased tissue demands for neutrophils until the mitotic pool increases neutrophil production. The maturation and storage functions are combined in Figure 4 -3. Neutrophil release from the bone marrow into the blood is age ordered according to maturity (segs, bands, metamyelocytes, myelocytes, and promyelocytes, in that order). As bone marrow stores of segs are depleted, nonsegmented neutrophils (nonsegs) (e.g., bands, metamyelocytes, younger neutrophils) are released into the blood, and a left shift occurs.",

Although neutrophils may be visible in respiratory cytologic samples and urine sediment, they are quickly lysed in the septic environment of the lumen of the bowel. In disease, the circulating halflife of neutrophils may be shortened considerably, accompanied by increased cell migration into tissues. In inflammation, excessive tissue neutrophils may be visible as exudate or pus. In diseases such as enteritis, tissue neutrophils may be hidden from cytologic or gross observation; however, increased tissue demand for neutrophils usually is reflected in the leukogram. The CBC allows quantitative and qualitative observations about leukocytes freely circulating in peripheral blood. The leukogram represents balance of leukocyte production in bone marrow, distribution in the vascular system, and emigration from blood vessels into tissues.

The common causes of neutrophilia and subsequent leukocytosis usually may be differentiated based on the immaturity of the neutrophils, the magnitude of the neutrophilia in the absence of leukemia, and the tendency of the lymphocytes to increase or decrease. Granulocytic leukemia is rare and not considered here. When the laboratory finding is present (Yes), the conclusion to the right is made. When the laboratory finding is absent (No), one moves down to the next differentiating feature. Inflammation may be responsible for total white blood cell (WBC) counts of less than 30,000 to 40,000 leukocytes/\u00b5l that are associated with lymphopenia because of concurrent stress.

Inflammation may also be suggested by the magnitude of leukocytosis (if it exceeds that expected with corticosteroid or epinephrine-associated conditions). When mild neutrophilia is present without a left shift, the specific cause of leukocytosis may be unclear. In such instances, the absolute lymphocyte count may be useful.

The greatest leukocytosis and left shift are expected early in acute inflammation. This period is also accompanied by the lymphopenia of stress. During later phases of inflammation, a more mature form of neutrophilia is expected, because bone marrow hyperplasia and marrow production of neutrophils should be adequate to allow maturation of neutrophils before release into blood.

In addition, neutrophils are shifted from the marginal pool (where they cannot be counted) to the circulating pool (where they are quantitated by the WBC count). A left shift is not expected with stress or corticosteroid treatment. Nuclear hypersegmentation of neutrophils (called a right shift) is more likely because corticosteroids decrease emigration of and prolong the circulating half-life of neutrophils in the blood (see Table 4 -4). As neutrophils age, progressive nuclear hypersegmentation or lobulation develops. Hypersegmented neutrophils have five or more nuclear lobes. Corticosteroids also increase the bone marrow release rate of neutrophils, which is a major cause of the leukocytosis. However, this effect is usually too mild to stimulate release of bands and metamyelocytes in the presence of a normal bone marrow storage pool of neutrophils.

Possible causes of decreased myelopoiesis include decreased production of neutrophils (i.e., myeloid hypoplasia, ineffective granulopoiesis, bone marrow necrosis) or bone marrow lesions (i.e., myelofibrosis, disseminated granulomatous infection, leukemia) that displace normal hematopoietic tissue (see Chapter 2). A cause (e.g., estrogen or phenylbutazone toxicosis) is infrequently discovered by examination of bone marrow; however, one may determine whether myeloid hypoplasia or myelophthisic disease is responsible. Ineffective granulopoiesis is suggested when leukopenia is accompanied by normal to increased numbers of developing myeloid cells in the bone marrow (in the absence of overwhelming infection). Cells are destroyed in the bone marrow (\"recycled\") before maturation and so are not released into the blood. This situation occurs to a small degree in healthy dogs (i.e., the myelocyte sink) but is exaggerated in diseases such as canine parvovirus infection and feline leukemia virus (FeLV) infection. Approximately 50% of FeLV-positive, neutropenic cats have marked granulocytic hyperplasia with a shift to immaturity, whereas 50% have myeloid hypoplasia suggesting viral destruction of hematopoietic tissue. Persistent neutropenia despite myeloid hyperplasia in FeLV-infected cats indicates ineffective granulopoiesis, provided increased tissue consumption of neutrophils is not responsible for the neutropenia. Ineffective granulopoiesis may also be a drug idiosyncratic reaction (e.g., phenobarbital).",

This tissue predilection may cause enteritis (with or without bloody diarrhea) or leukopenia. Massive neutrophil exudation into the damaged gut contributes to leukopenia. Leukopenia is transient and usually occurs early in canine parvovirus disease, so it may be missed without multiple CBC. Mast cells from the inflamed gut may be detected in blood smears. Neutrophilic leukocytosis is expected with recovery. During periods of intense granulopoiesis, a leukemoid reaction plus some disturbance of normal cell maturation may occur.

Eosinophils kill parasites by attaching to them and forming a digestive vacuole between the eosinophil and parasite. Eosinophils degranulate potent molecules such as major basic protein and eosinophil peroxidase, which damage the wall of the parasite or ova. More intense eosinophilic response occurs with parasites within tissues (e.g., heartworms, strongyles, migrating lung flukes such as Paragonimus kellicotti). Endoparasites, such as Giardia species or tapeworms that do not invade tissue generally do not incite eosinophilia. Some parasites may not stimulate eosinophilia until they die and expose previously hidden antigens. Production of eosinophilia is an immune response.

The characteristic WBC appearance should be recognized and reported to avoid undue concern to clinicians reading the CBC who may otherwise consider inflammation or dysplastic changes associated with leukemia. The nuclear chromatin pattern of the granulocytes appears coarse and mature, and the cytoplasm is clear and devoid of toxic changes. PHA presents as a lifelong \"degenerative left shift\" but is usually an incidental finding. Neutrophils function normally, and a predisposition to infection has not been demonstrated. PHA occurs in both dogs and cats and is presumed to be inherited in an autosomal dominant manner (Latimer, 1995; Latimer and Robertson, 1994) . However, PHA may be inherited in an autosomal incompletely dominant pattern in Australian shepherds, suggesting that the expression of the anomaly is governed by two or more alleles (Latimer, Campagnoli, and Danilenko, 2000) .",

A large buffy coat may be noted when measuring the PCV because of marked leukocytosis or thrombocytosis. Blast cells have a large round nucleus, fine chromatin pattern, and one or more prominent nucleoli. Reactive and blast-transformed lymphocytes are often present in small numbers (e.g., 1 to 5/blood smear) and are not diagnostic. Numerous reactive and blasttransformed lymphocytes may occur in ill, nonleukemic animals (e.g., 1% to 5% of WBC) and may mimic leukemia. Rare mitotic figures do not indicate leukemia because mitotically active cells such as rubricytes, promyelocytes, myelocytes, monocytes, and reactive lymphocytes are encountered in nonleukemic animals. Morphologic irregularities may include developmental changes of dysplasia, such as megaloblastic erythroid precursors that have an excessive amount of cytoplasm and unusual nuclear chromatin pattern, enlarged segs with many nuclear lobes (i.e., macropolycytes), enlarged highly vacuolated platelets, or dwarf megakaryocytes, and asynchronous maturation wherein maturity of nucleus and cytoplasm differ. White cell counts in leukemia are variable from leukocytosis, leukopenia, or even within normal limits. Anemia is often nonregenerative but rarely hemolysis is found in some forms of leukemia. Thrombocytopenia or less commonly thrombocytosis is associated with the other hematologic changes. Laboratory tests used to diagnose hematopoietic neoplasia or myelodysplasia and evaluate the extent of involvement include bone marrow evaluation, biochemical profiles, cytology, serology, and urinalysis, in addition to hematology. If changes in the blood are not diagnostic, bone marrow examination may confirm leukemia. Blast cells are often found in much higher numbers in marrow than in blood. Bone marrow evaluation should involve optimally an aspirate and core biopsy with concurrent peripheral blood evaluation. Cytology of effusions or solid tissue masses help to determine a primary source. Serology is indicated for evaluation of leukemia-causing viruses. Protein evaluation of the serum and urine is helpful in determining the presence of gammopathies associated with lymphoproliferative conditions (see Chapter 12).",

The following information is for those choosing to treat leukemic cases and who need a more specific diagnosis for treatment choices. Definitive diagnosis of specific leukemias usually requires a veterinary clinical pathologist. Slide review from routine CBC with Wright's-stained smears of EDTA anticoagulated blood may allow differentiation of the cellular origin, such as lymphoid from myeloid (i.e., nonlymphoid). Evaluation of the bone marrow is often necessary to classify the leukemia, because the blood may not be representative of the degree of leukemic involvement. If cell morphology in a leukemic patient is insufficient to determine the cell lineage, one may use specialized tests (i.e., cytochemistry, electron microscopy, immunocytochemistry) usually conducted at academic institutions or referral laboratories. Cytochemistry involves nonimmunologic cytoplasmic markers for enzymes, lipids, or glycogen within the cell (Raskin and Valenciano, 2000) . Enzymes include peroxidase found in certain granulocytes and nonspecific esterases found in monocytes or T lymphocytes (see Table 4 -7). NOTE: Leukemia is less common than other causes of alterations in leukocyte numbers and morphology. Stress, inflammation, and reactive lymphocytes are much more common. Electron microscopy is helpful to study the ultrastructural features of the cytoplasm and nucleus Stevens, 1985a and 1985b) . Immunocytochemistry involves staining of specific cell surface antigens by the use of antibodies such as monoclonal antibodies against CD3 (T cells), CD4 (helper cells), CD8 (cytotoxic or suppressor cells), CD14 (monocyte progenitors), CD21 (B cells), and CD79 (B cells) (Moore and Vernau, 2000) . Blood and bone marrow specimens for these special procedures require specific instructions in handling, preparation, and fixation.

This veterinary system separates lymphoid neoplasms by immunophenotype and tumor site location primarily supported by morphologic criteria and may provide better prognostic information than previous classification schemes. Histopathology plays a key role in using this system. The lymphoid leukemic forms are classified as acute or chronic. An abundance of blast cells or immature cells characterizes acute leukemia.

Differentiation of CLL from ALL or lymphoma with a leukemic blood profile is based on the relatively mature appearance of lymphocytes in CLL versus finding lymphoblasts in the other conditions. Lymphocytes in CLL are larger than normal and more homogeneous in appearance than in normal animals. Diagnosis of CLL is aided greatly by magnitude of the lymphocytosis, which may exceed 40,000 to 100,000 lymphocytes/\u00b5l. Maximum lymphocytosis in extreme immune reactions (e.g., chronic canine rickettsial infections) seldom exceeds 25,000 lymphocytes/\u00b5l and usually is less than 15,000 lymphocytes/\u00b5l. Lymphocytosis in cats with strong persistent, immune stimulus in nonleukemic diseases may reach higher maximum lymphocyte counts (e.g., 40,000/\u00b5l). Reactive lymphocytosis in young, asymptomatic cynomolgus monkeys can reach 70,000 lymphocytes for 1 or 2 weeks. These extreme changes may be called a lymphocytic leukemoid reaction.

Subtypes M1-M7 are defined by the cell of origin and the degree of differentiation (Raskin, 1996) . Cytochemical staining (see Figure 4 -10 and Table 4 -7) or immunocytochemistry is used to distinguish the subtypes. For example, acute myeloblastic (myelogenous) leukemia (AML-M2) usually consists of neutrophils, but coproduction of basophils and eosinophils may occur. Total leukocyte counts are variable, but extreme leukocytosis may occur. Blast cells are often found in circulation. Severe anemia and thrombocytopenia may accompany AML. Myeloblasts, promyelocytes, and atypical cells denote subtypes M1 to M3. Myeloblasts may have a moderately basophilic cytoplasm with few small azurophilic granules. A disorderly maturation sequence also suggests neoplasia but may occur during repopulation of the bone marrow after cellular destruction (e.g., toxin, parvovirus). Repopulation of the bone marrow begins with immature cells (i.e., myeloblasts, progranulocytes, myelocytes), without the expected predominance of mature bands and segmenters; this appearance initially resembles leukemia, but progressive maturation eventually restores a normal marrow cell population. Diagnosis may require reevaluation of the bone marrow after a few days.",
