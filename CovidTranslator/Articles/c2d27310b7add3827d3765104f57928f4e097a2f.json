            "text": "Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV), a member of the Phlebovirus genus in the Bunyaviridae family, is transmitted by mosquitoes and infects both humans and domestic animals, particularly cattle and sheep. Since primary RVFV strains must be handled in BSL-3+ or BSL-4 facilities, a RVFV cell-cell fusion assay will facilitate the investigation of RVFV glycoprotein function under BSL-2 conditions. As for other members of the Bunyaviridae family, RVFV glycoproteins are targeted to the Golgi, where the virus buds, and are not efficiently delivered to the cell surface. However, overexpression of RVFV glycoproteins using an alphavirus replicon vector resulted in the expression of the glycoproteins on the surface of multiple cell types. Brief treatment of RVFV glycoprotein expressing cells with mildly acidic media (pH 6.2 and below) resulted in rapid and efficient syncytia formation, which we quantified by \u03b2-galactosidase \u03b1-complementation. Fusion was observed with several cell types, suggesting that the receptor(s) for RVFV is widely expressed or that this acid-dependent virus does not require a specific receptor to mediate cell-cell fusion. Fusion occurred over a broad temperature range, as expected for a virus with both mosquito and mammalian hosts. In contrast to cell fusion mediated by the VSV-G glycoprotein, RVFV glycoprotein-dependent cell fusion could be prevented by treating target cells with trypsin, indicating that one or more proteins (or protein-associated carbohydrate) on the host cell surface are needed to support membrane fusion. The cell-cell fusion assay reported here will make it possible to study the membrane fusion activity of RVFV glycoproteins in a high-throughput format and to screen small molecule inhibitors for the ability to block virus-specific membrane fusion.",

The inherent difficulty of studying aspects of RVFV under these conditions can be avoided if assays are developed that allow for investigation of the viral proteins in a BSL-2 setting. For example, a cell-cell fusion assay using only the glycoproteins G N and G C would make it possible to study the structure and function of these proteins under BSL-2 conditions. While fusion assays for members of the Bunyaviridae family have been described, including La Crosse virus in the genus Orthobunyavirus and Hantaan virus in the genus Hantavirus, no fusion assay has been described for viruses in the genus Phlebovirus (Arikawa et al., 1986; Jacoby et al., 1993; Ogino et al., 2004; Plassmeyer et al., 2005; Pobjecky et al., 1986) . One of the difficulties in the development of a cell-cell fusion assay for RVFV is that its glycoproteins are targeted to and retained in the Golgi, where the virus buds. When expressed individually, G N is targeted to the Golgi while G C is retained in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (Gerrard and Nichol, 2002; Wasmoen et al., 1988) . Thus, G N is necessary for the proper Golgi localization of G C during viral assembly.",

While plasmid vectors did not allow for sufficiently high levels of expression to achieve this goal, expression of the glycoproteins from an alphavirus replicon vector led to readily detectable cell surface expression. We found that brief low pH incubation of multiple cell types expressing the RVFV glycoproteins on their surface resulted in cell-cell fusion. Expression of the omega and alpha subunits of \u03b2-galactosidase in the effector and target cells, respectively, made it possible to quantify fusion by measuring enzymatic activity of the\u03b1-complemented \u03b2-galactosidase (Holland et al., 2004) . Cell-cell fusion was induced when cells were incubated at pH 6.2 or below, occurred over a broad range of temperatures, and was dependent upon one or more trypsin-sensitive proteins (or protein-associated carbohydrate) on the surface of target cells. The development of a high-throughput cell-cell fusion assay for RVFV will make it possible to study the structure-function relationships of the viral glycoproteins and to identify host cell factors needed to support RVFV entry.",

When the RVFV glycoproteins were expressed from the plasmid vector, they were targeted to the Golgi and were not expressed on the cell surface at levels that could be detected, consistent with other studies (Gerrard and Nichol, 2002; Wasmoen et al., 1988) (Figs. 1A and B) . Since proteins that are retained in the Golgi can sometimes be targeted to the cell surface upon overexpression (Bos et al., 1993; Linstedt et al., 1997) , we next examined the localization of the RVFV glycoproteins when expressed from the alphavirus vectors. When compared to expression via pWRG7077, we found that both the VEE and Sindbis virus vectors produced high levels of the RVFV glycoproteins as judged by immunoblot analysis ( Fig. 1E and data not shown), though G N and G C were too close in size (55 kDa and 57 kDa, respectively) to clearly resolve. In addition, both G N and G C were detected on the surface of non-permeabilized cells when expressed via the VEE vector (Figs. 1C and D). Similar results were obtained with the Sindbis-like virus replicon, but because the VEE replicon particles (VRP) could be produced to higher titers, these were used in subsequent experiments.",

The next day, the cells were stained with hyperimmune mouse ascitic fluid prepared against RVFV and analyzed by flow cytometry. We found that expression of the RVFV glycoproteins from the pWRG7077-R4 plasmid resulted in low levels of surface expression, while expression via the VRP resulted in much higher levels of surface expression (Fig. 1F) .

Therefore, 24 h after infection with VRPs, we briefly incubated cells in a low pH buffer to induce conformational changes in the glycoproteins that might normally occur after endocytosis of the virus. If the glycoproteins undergo the proper conformational changes, the membranes of two adjacent cells may fuse, forming a syncytium. We found that several cell types formed syncytia following expression of the RVFV glycoproteins and brief treatment at pH 5.2, including 293T/17 cells, HeLa cells, FLK cells, Huh-7 and HepG2 liver cells, CHO cells, and Vero cells ( Fig. 2 and data not shown). Syncytia formation was not observed when cells were maintained at neutral pH nor was fusion observed when cells infected with a control VRP expressing no glycoproteins (vector 3014) were incubated at either low or neutral pH (Fig. 2) .

Low pH-triggered syncytia formation of VEE replicon particle infected cells. Vero, Huh-7 (human hepatoma), or FLK (fetal lamb kidney) cells were infected with either an empty VRP (vector 3014; expresses no glycoproteins) or a VRP expressing the RVFV glycoproteins as indicated in the figure. Results with the negative control empty vector are shown only for the Vero cells. After 24 h infection, the cells were treated with buffer at pH 7.4 or pH 5.2 for 1 min then incubated with DMEM 10% FBS for 2 h. The cells were then fixed with methanol, stained with Giemsa, and photographs taken. Arrows indicate syncytia. gene after syncytia formation. However, due to the ability of alphavirus replicons to inhibit host protein synthesis after infection (Kaariainen and Ranki, 1984) , multiple approaches that relied upon the expression of a reporter gene subsequent to cell-cell fusion failed. Therefore, we explored the use of the \u03b2-galactosidase \u03b1-complementation-based fusion assay. In this assay, the alpha subunit of \u03b2-galactosidase is expressed in one cell population, while the omega subunit is expressed in another. If fusion between the cell populations occurs after they are mixed, the alpha and omega subunits (produced prior to cell-cell fusion) assemble and functional \u03b2-galactosidase is formed, the activity of which can be readily quantified following cell lysis and addition of a chemiluminescent substrate (Holland et al., 2004) . By expressing the relatively stable omega subunit in 293T/17 cells 24 h prior to infection with an alphavirus replicon vector, we reasoned that sufficient protein would remain following alphavirus-induced host-cell protein synthesis shut-off such that fusion could still be assayed.",

For a cell-cell fusion assay to be developed, either the viral glycoproteins need to be expressed on the cell surface or large amounts of virus need to be added to the outside of cells to induce fusion-from-without. Since we sought to develop an assay that would enable us to manipulate the viral glycoproteins to test structural and functional hypotheses, we investigated approaches that would result in delivery of RVFV G N and G C to the cell surface. Gerrard and Nichol have shown that, when coexpressed, both G N and G C are delivered to the Golgi by virtue of a targeting signal present within the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of G N . Interestingly, some G N reached the cell surface under their conditions, raising the possibility that the RVFV glycoproteins are localized to the Golgi at least in part by a retrieval mechanism from the cell surface (Gerrard and Nichol, 2002) . If so, then overexpression of the glycoproteins could alter the steady state distribution of G N and G C such that sufficient levels are attained on the plasma membrane for the induction of cell-cell fusion. Indeed, the distribution of several cellular proteins that reside in the Golgi can be altered upon overexpression, resulting in enhanced delivery to the cell surface (Bos et al., 1993; Linstedt et al., 1997) .",

            "text": "Expression of the RVFV G N and G C polyprotein from an alphavirus vector resulted in readily detectable surface expression of these molecules. The alphavirus replicon technology can be used to express a variety of proteins, including other viral glycoproteins that are not naturally targeted to the cell surface and are therefore difficult to manipulate in cell-cell fusion or pseudovirion assays (Heise et al., 2003; Thompson et al., 2006) . Cells expressing the RVFV glycoproteins on the cell surface formed syncytia when incubated at mildly acidic pH, suggesting that this virus utilizes one or more endocytic pathways for cellular infection, with endosomal pH playing a critical role in inducing the fusion reaction. Other members of the Bunyaviridae family for which acid pH dependence has been shown include La Crosse, Hantaan, and California encephalitis viruses (Gonzalez-Scarano, 1985; Gonzalez-Scarano et al., 1984; Hacker and Hardy, 1997; Jacoby et al., 1993; Ronka et al., 1995) . Thus, the fact that RVFV glycoproteins induced cell-cell fusion at low pH is not surprising. However, it remains to be determined if RVFV needs other cellular factors in addition to low pH for membrane fusion to occur. For example, the SARS coronavirus (Simmons et al., 2005) and Ebola virus (Chandran et al., 2005) envelope proteins require a low-pH dependent endoproteolytic cleavage event in order for fusion to be elicited, while the ASLV envelope protein must first bind to its specific receptor, which triggers conformational changes in the envelope protein that render it competent to elicit membrane fusion upon subsequent exposure to low pH (Mothes et al., 2000) . Since cell surface RVFV glycoproteins were capable of eliciting efficient cell-cell fusion, it is less likely that proteolytic activation of either G N or G C is a required triggering event, though this possibility cannot be ruled out. Whether binding to a specific receptor might be needed prior to acid treatment is also not known and cannot be addressed at present since the receptor(s) for RVFV is unknown.",

Experiments examining the susceptibility of Culex pipiens and Aedes fowleri mosquitoes to RVFV determined that adult mosquitoes held at lower temperatures (13-19\u00b0C) were less susceptible to RVFV infections, which correlates with our data indicating less RVFV-induced fusion at lower temperatures (Brubaker and Turell, 1998; Turell, 1989; Turell et al., 1985) ; however, there is no evidence that fusion efficiency is the only factor in mosquito susceptibility to RVFV infection.",

In the context of a cell-cell fusion assay, the presence of antibodies may not completely block the proximity of the overexpressed RVFV glycoproteins to the target cell membrane.

            "text": "Because RVFV infects many cell types, with no known cell refractory to RVFV infection, it is likely that the receptor for RVFV is widespread or that there is no single receptor needed for virus infection. As noted previously, some acid-dependent viruses require specific receptors, whereas others can elicit fusion with artificial membranes at low pH, thus demonstrating that the presence of host cell proteins is not required (Corver et al., 2000; White and Helenius, 1980) . To further explore the target cell requirements for RVFV glycoprotein-mediated fusion, we treated target cells with trypsin and found that this largely abolished RVFV-dependent membrane fusion, though it did not affect fusion elicited by VSV-G. This indicates that a host cell surface protein or protein-associated carbohydrate is necessary for RVFV cell-cell fusion, and perhaps for virus infection as well. Currently, we are in the process of analyzing a more extensive panel of proteases for their effects on RVFV fusion.",

While there is no specific experimental evidence for this, the pH dependence of the virus and the necessity for both G N and G C for fusion are consistent with a class II fusion mechanism. The fusion assay described here will allow further investigation of the structural elements of G C necessary to induce cell-cell fusion. The development of this quantitative cell-cell fusion assay will make it possible to more fully explore the conditions needed for RVFV-induced membrane fusion, to study the structurefunction relationships of the viral glycoproteins, and to screen for small molecules that block RVFV entry or fusion that could be used as antiviral drugs.",
