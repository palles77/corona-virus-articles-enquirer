Strips were removed to the laboratory in Eagle's based culture medium, without antibacterials (Stott et al., 1976) , cut into small pieces of 2-3 mm 3, set in six-well plastic Petri dishes (2 per well) and covered with 3 ml of medium. The cultures were then incubated at 37\u00b0C in a CO 2 incubator for 1-2 hours prior to inoculation with 108 colony-forming units (cfu) of washed bacteria in 0.1 ml and returned to the incubator. aureus strain M60 and E. coli strain P4 were used to inoculate the cultures. These were originally obtained from clinical cases of bovine mastitis and were isolated at the National Institute for Research in Dairying, Shinfield, UK. Bacteria were stored at a density of approximately 108 cfu/ml at -20\u00b0C in Todd-Hewitt broth containing 25% (v/v) glycerol and revived by growth in Todd-Hewitt broth at 37\u00b0C for 18 hours. Bacteria were harvested by centrifugation (3000 g, 15 min), washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.2) and resuspended in PBS to a density of 109 cfu/ml.

Figure 6 . Streptococcus uberis, 18 hours after inoculation; bacteria only adherent to detaching epithelial cells, none adherent to the microvilli of healthy cells. SEM; bar = 6/zm DISCUSSION None of the five bacteria used in this study showed any tropism for live epithelium, whether it was lining large ducts or the smaller, more centrally located ducts from which the secretory tissue is derived. The failure of these recognized mammary pathogens to adhere to healthy mammary gland epithelium would appear to support the findings in mice by Anderson (1978) that adhesion is not an important factor in their pathogenicity. A limited tropism for sloughed, effete ductular epithelium was seen, particularly with the three species of streptococci, and this may explain the discrepancy between the results reported here and those previously published by Frost and colleagues (1977) , who may have had a high proportion of effete cells in their in vitro test system. Up to 100% of cells extracted by the method used by those authors may stain with trypan blue (J.A. Leigh and others, unpublished observations). Alternatively the apparent invasion by E. coli of flattened epithelium could have resulted from phagocytosis by the epithelium (Figure 8 ). The overwhelming majority of bacteria of all species were attached to the exposed connective tissue around the periphery of the cultures, which could be particularly relevant once the bacteria have broached the mammary epithelium. All the species tested were able to penetrate the stromal tissue of the cultures to a variable degree. S. uberis appeared able to utilize the putative venules or lymphatics for this purpose, perhaps through adherence to fibrin overlying the endothelium.",
