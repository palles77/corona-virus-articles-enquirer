Influenza viruses attach to host cells by specific binding between the HA head region and sialylglycan that is expressed on the host cell surface. Influenza viruses also recognize terminal sialic acid (Sia) and galactose linkage patterns on sialylglycans (Imai and Kawaoka, 2012) . Human influenza viruses preferentially bind to \u03b12,6-linked Sia (\u03b12,6 Sia), whereas most avian viruses preferentially bind to a sugar chain ending in \u03b12,3-linked Sia (\u03b12,3 Sia). This plays a key role of the interspecies barrier that prevents AI viruses from easily infecting humans. Therefore, it is believed that a switch of HA receptor specificity from \u03b12,3 Sia to \u03b12,6 Sia is essential for the emergence of a pandemic influenza virus (Watanabe et al., 2012b) .",

H5N1 virus can be directly transmitted from birds to humans and cause a severe respiratory disease with high morbidity (60%) (WHO, 2014) . Fortunately, all human H5N1 infections have been restricted to people with close contact with infected poultry and there has been no sustained human-to-human transmission. However, repeated bird-to-human transmission may allow H5N1 viruses to acquire HA mutations that change their receptor specificity from \u03b12,3 Sia (bird-type) to \u03b12,6 Sia (human-type), thereby generating a pandemic virus. H5N1 virus has now diverged genetically to form 10 phylogenetically and phenotypically distinct clades (designated clades 0-9) in different geographic areas (Watanabe et al., 2013) . Such complex ecology and diversification in the field increase the pandemic potential of H5N1 virus (Peiris et al., 2007) . In addition, other subtype AI viruses, such as H9N2 and H7N9, have also been directly transmitted to humans (Garcia-Sastre and Schmolke, 2014).",

A 1 mg/ml solution of each sialylglycopolymer (non-conjugated with colored latex) was prepared in PBS, and 100 ml of this solution was added to each well of 96-well microtiter plates (Polystyrene Universal-Bind Microplates, Corning, USA). The plates were then irradiated with 254 nm ultraviolet light for 10 min, and each well was washed three times with 250 ml PBS. Each well was blocked with 200 ml SuperBlock Blocking Buffer (Thermo Scientific, USA) at room temperature for 1 h. After washing with ice-cold PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 (PBST), a serial dilution of 256 HAU of an influenza virus in PBST was added to the wells, and the plates were incubated at 4\u00b0C for 12 h. After five washes with ice-cold PBST, monoclonal antibody against influenza virus nucleoprotein, which is a structural protein of the viral particle, was added to each well, and the plates were incubated at 4\u00b0C for 2 h. The wells were then Virus Biotin -HA antibody The mixture was then applied on the sample pad. During migration though the sialylglycopolymer pad, virus-C179 antibody complexes formed a colored sialylglycopolymer-virus-biotinylated antibody complex, which was captured by avidin at the test line. Accumulation of the trimetric complex produced a visible test line with the color of the bound sialylglycopolymer (\u03b12,3 Sia, blue; \u03b12,6 Sia, red). Excess complexes and free sialylglycopolymers were captured by lectin at the control line. The strip test was completed 15 min after the virus-antibody complex was applied on the sample pad.

A preliminary study showed that C179 reacted with all of the group 1 influenza HAs in this study, while monoclonal antibodies against the antigenically variable HA head region only reacted with some of these HAs (Table S1 ). C179 binding to the HA stem region has been reported to not interfere with the interaction between sialylglycans and the HA head region (Okuno et al., 1993) , which enabled its use in the strip test to detect sialylglycan-HA complexes.",

Each mixture was then pipetted onto a test strip sample pad or, alternatively, a sample pad was immersed in the virus mixture. This allowed the mixture to migrate along the strip by capillary action. During migration through the sialylglycopolymer pad, the virus-C179 complex was able to form a complex with \u03b12,3 Sia or \u03b12,6 Sia depending on the virus HA receptor binding affinity. Principle of the subsequent reaction is mainly based on two types of interaction: avidin-biotin interaction and lectin-glycan interaction. As the virus-C179-sialylglycopolymer complex migrated along the test strip, it was captured at the test line by avidin-biotinylated C179 interaction. Accumulation of the trimeric complex resulted in visual blue and red test lines on the \u03b12,3 Sia strips and \u03b12,6 Sia strips, respectively. If a viral HA did not bind either sialyglycopolymer, there was no visible test line because the captured virus-C179 dimeric complex was colorless. Excess complexes and free sialylglycopolymers were captured at the control line by lectinglycan interactions, resulting in visible blue and red control lines on the \u03b12,3 Sia strips and \u03b12,6 Sia strips, respectively. The results of this assay were observed by eye 15 min after deposition of the virus mixture onto the strips. The presence of double blue lines on the \u03b12,3 Sia strip and double red lines on the \u03b12,6 Sia strip indicated virus binding affinity to \u03b12,3 Sia and \u03b12,6 Sia, respectively. Only a blue control line on the \u03b12,3 Sia strip and only a red control line on the \u03b12,6 Sia strip indicated no binding affinity to \u03b12,3 Sia and \u03b12,6 Sia respectively, or that the amount of virus was below the limit of detection of this assay. If a control line did not appear within 15 min, the test was considered invalid. Thus, the complete assay took only 30 min.",

Previous studies reported that HA Q192H and 128\u0394/I151T mutations increased viral binding affinity for \u03b12,6 Sia (Watanabe et al., 2011) . Therefore, rEG/D1 Q192H and rEG/D1 128\u0394/I151T were generated by introducing the Q192H and 128\u0394/I151T mutations into EG/D1 HA to produce representative interphyletic viruses for this study. The virus binding assays showed that Suita/117 and Japan/434 had binding specificity for \u03b12,6 Sia ( Fig. 2A and B) . In contrast, EG/D1 and rEG/D1 had binding specificity for \u03b12,3 Sia ( Fig. 2C and D) .

This was in agreement with the previous report that sublineage A/B viruses have generally acquired an increased human-type receptor binding affinity (Watanabe et al., 2011) . In contrast, all the H5N1 strains that were isolated in Viet Nam and Indonesia showed typical bird-type receptor specificity. Several variant-type strains with increased \u03b12,6 Sia binding affinity have been reported in some Asian countries (Auewarakul et al., 2007; Boltz et al., 2010) . However, acquisition of human-type receptor affinity by Asian H5N1 viruses seemed to be strain-specific, which may explain why the Asian H5N1 viruses tested in this study did not show dual receptor specificity. Further evaluation of the test strips using larger numbers of Asian H5N1 strains may detect interphyletic viruses in these areas.",

Epidemiological studies have reported a few exceptional virus strains that recognized distinct sialylglycan topologies (Xiong et al., 2013) .
