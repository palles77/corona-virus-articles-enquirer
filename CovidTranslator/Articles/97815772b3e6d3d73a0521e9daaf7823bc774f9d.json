            "text": "Feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIP virus: FIPV), a feline coronavirus of the family Coronaviridae, causes a fatal disease called FIP in wild and domestic cat species. The genome of coronaviruses encodes a hydrophobic transmembrane protein, the envelope (E) protein. The E protein possesses ion channel activity. Viral proteins with ion channel activity are collectively termed ''viroporins''. Hexamethylene amiloride (HMA), a viroporin inhibitor, can inhibit the ion channel activity of the E protein and replication of several coronaviruses. However, it is not clear whether HMA and other viroporin inhibitors affect replication of FIPV. We examined the effect of HMA and other viroporin inhibitors (DIDS [4,4 0 -disothiocyano-2,2 0 -stilbenedisulphonic acid] and amantadine) on infection by FIPV serotypes I and II. HMA treatment drastically decreased the titers of FIPV serotype I strains Black and KU-2 in a dose-dependent manner, but it only slightly decreased the titer of FIPV serotype II strain 79-1146. In contrast, DIDS treatment decreased the titer of FIPV serotype II strain 79-1146 in dose-dependent manner, but it only slightly decreased the titers of FIPV serotype I strains Black and KU-2. We investigated whether there is a difference in ion channel activity of the E protein between viral serotypes using E. coli cells expressing the E protein of FIPV serotypes I and II. No difference was observed, suggesting that a viroporin other than the E protein influences the differences in the actions of HMA and DIDS on FIPV serotypes I and II.",

            "text": "The FCoV virion is mainly composed of the nucleocapsid (N), envelope (E), membrane (M), and peplomer spike (S) proteins [13] . FCoV has been classified into serotypes I and II based on the amino acid sequence of its S protein [7, 10] . Both serotypes consist of two biotypes: FIPV and feline enteric coronavirus (FECV) [22] . FECV infection is asymptomatic in cats; however, FIPV infection causes FIP. Some proteins encoded by the coronavirus genome show ion channel activity. For example, the 3a and E proteins of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and the 4a protein of human coronavirus (HCoV)-229E have been reported to show ion channel activity [15, 25, 26] . Viral proteins with ion channel activity have also been reported in other viruses and have collectively been termed ''viroporins'' [12] . The involvement of viroporins in replication and budding has been confirmed in influenza virus, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and hepatitis C virus (HCV). The replication of these viruses was shown to be markedly inhibited by viroporin inhibitors. Amantadine, 4,4 0 -disothiocyano-2,2 0stilbenedisulphonic acid (DIDS), and hexamethylene amiloride (HMA) have been identified as viroporin inhibitors. Wilson et al. [25] reported that HMA, an inhibitor of the E protein ion channel, inhibits viral replication of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) and HCoV-229E, but the antiviral effect of HMA on FIPV has not been clarified.",

The growth of cells was significantly lower after 2-4 hours in cells with the induction of the GST ? E protein than in cells without induction (Fig. 4B, pDEST15 ? KU2E and pDEST15 ? 79-1146E). In contrast, no significant differences in growth were observed between cells with the induction of only GST ? S1 and GST proteins and cells without induction (Fig. 4B, pDEST15 ?

The relationship between inhibition of E. coli cell growth and E-protein-expression-induced changes in membrane permeability was investigated by assessing the incorporation of a substrate of b-galactosidase, ONPG, by E. coli cells. The uptake of ONPG in cells was significantly higher after 12-24 hours in cells with the induction of the GST ? E protein than in cells without induction (Fig. 4C , pDEST15 ? KU2S1 and pDEST15). In contrast, no significant changes were observed in the uptake of ONPG between cells with the induction of the GST ? S1 protein and cells without the induction (Fig. 4C, pDEST15 ?-KU2S1).

            "text": "Viroporins are hydrophobic, low-molecular-weight viral transmembrane proteins [20] . The presence of viroporins has recently been reported in many viruses [1, 3, 8, 9] , and their functions have been clarified. A viroporin forms an oligomer and makes a hydrophilic pore in host-infected cells and endosome membranes. These pores have been shown to transport substances inside and outside the cell membrane and are involved in the homeostasis of intracellular ions, changes in cell membrane polarity, localization of intracellular substances, and budding and release of virus particles. Liao et al. [13] and Madan et al. [16] reported that the E proteins of SARS-CoV and MHV, belonging to the genus Betacoronavirus, function as viroporins. The function of the E protein as a viroporin has been also clarified in a member of the genus Alphacoronavirus (HCoV-229E) [25] . It was recently reported that the 3a protein of SARS-CoV and the 4a protein of HCoV-229E function as viroporins [15, 25, 26] . We investigated the inhibitory effects of viroporin inhibitors on replication of FIPV serotypes I and II using Fcwf-4 cells. The inhibitory effect of viral replication was investigated by measuring the virus titer in the culture supernatant. Amantadine showed no inhibitory effect on viral replication, whereas HMA drastically inhibited FIPV serotype I replication in a dose-dependent manner but only slightly inhibited FIPV serotype II. HMA drastically decreased the titers of FIPV serotype I strains Black and KU-2 in a dose-dependent manner but decreased the titer of FIPV serotype II strain 79-1146 only slightly. In contrast, DIDS decreased the titer of FIPV serotype II strain 79-1146 in a dose-dependent manner but did not decrease the titers of FIPV serotype I strains Black and KU-2. This may be due to a difference in ion channel activity of viroporin between serotypes I and II FIPV. HMA is a sodium channel blocker [11] , whereas DIDS is a chloride channel blocker [19] , suggesting that the function of the sodium channel blocker is dominant in the viroporin of serotype I FIPV, whereas the function of the chloride channel blocker is dominant in serotype II FIPV.",

Using these transfectants, the function of the FIPV E protein as a viroporin was investigated with reference to a study by Liao et al. [12] . Since the E protein is hydrophobic, it was assumed that the protein aggregates in the cytoplasm of E. coli cells and is not expressed in the cell membrane. To avoid E protein aggregation, a GST fusion protein was prepared. Griffin et al. [13] and Melton et al. [17] reported that the expression of GST-tagged viroporin did not influence the ion channel activity of viroporin in E. coli and mammalian cells. Cell growth was (C) Influence of FIPV E protein expression on the membrane permeability of E. coli cells. E. coli cells were induced (black circle) or not induced (white circle) with L-arabinose. The cells were collected at the indicated times post-induction. Cells were resuspended with ONPG solution and incubated at 30\u00b0C for 2 h. After incubation, b-galactosidase activity was measured using the culture supernatant. b-galactosidase activity was measured at 405 nm. ** p \\ 0.01 vs. no treatment with L-arabinose (control). *, p \\ 0.05 vs. no treatment with L-arabinose (control). Data represent three independent experiments significantly inhibited in E. coli cells transformed with pDEST15 ? KU2E and pDEST15 ? 79-1146E from 2 hours after induction, which suggests that the FIPV E protein expressed on the E. coli cell surface functioned as a viroporin. The movement of substances in the bacterial cell membrane may have been altered, and intracellular substances essential for the survival of E. coli cells may have exited the cells. A significant elevation in b-galactosidase activity levels was noted 24 and 48 hours after the induction in E. coli cells transformed with pDEST15 ? KU2E and pDEST15 ? 79-1146E, respectively. The FIPV E protein was assumed to be expressed on the E. coli surface and to have increased the cell surface permeability, which promoted the incorporation of ONPG into the cells and the reaction of intracellular b-galactosidase with ONPG. Intracellular b-galactosidase may also have exited the cells and reacted with extracellular ONPG. These phenomena have also been reported in E. coli cells expressing the SARS-CoV E protein and influenza virus M2 protein [5, 12] . These findings strongly suggest that the FIPV E protein functions as a viroporin.",

After inoculation, cells were cultured in maintenance medium containing viroporin inhibitors (10 lM HMA and 100 lM DIDS) with 1.5 % carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC-MEM) or without carboxymethyl cellulose (MEM). In the case of cells cultured in CMC-MEM, the cell monolayers were incubated at 37\u00b0C for 48 hours and fixed and stained, and the resulting plaques were counted. In the case of cells cultured in MEM, the culture supernatants were collected at 48 hours postinfection, and the virus titer was determined by TCID 50 assay. The black bars indicate treatment with viroporin inhibitors, and the white bars indicate treatment with the solvent as a control. Data from two groups were analyzed by Student's t-test, and multiple groups were analyzed by one-way ANOVA. (B) Effect of HMA on the plaque morphology of FCoV Effect of viroporin inhibitors on FIPV infection 1167 analyzed the growth kinetics of the virus at low and high MOI. HMA and DIDS did not inhibit plaque formation of either serotype at low or high MOI. However, treatment of cells infected with FIPV serotype I at an MOI of 0.01 or 0.001 with 10 lM HMA significantly reduced the size of plaques and decreased the virus titer in the culture supernatant. Treatment of cells infected with FIDV serotype II at an MOI of 0.01 with 10 lM HMA and 100 lM DIDS also decreased the virus titer in culture supernatant but did not reduce the size of plaques. These results suggested that HMA decreases the extracellular level of serotype I FIPV and possibly serotype II FIPV titers.",
