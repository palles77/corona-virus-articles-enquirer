            "text": "The emergence of intestinal organoids, as a stem cell-based self-renewable model system, has led to many studies on intestinal development and cell-cell signaling. However, potential issues regarding the phenotypic stability and reproducibility of the methodology during culture still needs to be addressed for different organoids. Here we investigated the transcriptomes of intestinal organoids derived from the same pig as well as batch-to-batch variation of organoids derived from different pigs over long-term passage. The set of genes expressed in organoids closely resembled that of the tissue of origin, including location specific functions, for at least 17 passages. Minor differences in gene expression were observed between individual organoid cultures. In contrast, most tissue-specific genes were not expressed in the transformed jejunum cell line IPECJ2, which also showed gene expression consistent with cancer phenotypes. We conclude that intestinal organoids provide a robust and stable model for translational research with clear advantages over transformed cells.",

Two 5-week-old piglets were used for generating organoids following procedures previously described [11, 13] . Briefly, a 2 cm section of the mid-jejunum was dissected and placed in ice-cold PBS. After opening the sections longitudinally, jejunum segments were washed three times in ice-cold PBS and villi removed by carefully scraping with a scalpel. Small sections of the mucosa were cut from the muscle layer, divided into small cubes, and transferred into ice-cold PBS containing 30 mM EDTA and incubated with rotation at room temperature for 15 min. The PBS -EDTA was then replaced and incubation continued for 10 min at 37 \u00b0C. After washing in ice-cold DMEM supplemented with 5% penicillin/streptomycin (Gibco, Thermo Fisher Scientific), the crypts were dissociated by rigorous vortexing and passed through a 100 \u00b5m strainer into cold DMEM containing 5% foetal bovine serum (FBS, v/v). Crypts were pelleted by centrifugation at 300 x g for 5 min, and suspended in Matrigel (Basement Membrane, Growth factor reduced, REF 356231, Corning, Bedford, MA, USA). To improve surface tension, empty 24-well plates were pre-incubated overnight at 37 \u00b0C. Matrigel containing crypts was then plated at 7 domes per well (approx. 35 \u00b5l per well) and inverted to polymerize at 37 \u00b0C. After polymerization, 600 \u00b5l F12 cell culture medium (Gibco) was added, supplemented with 100 \u03bcg/ml primocin (Invivogen), 10 mM HEPES (HyClone), 1 \u00d7 B-27 (Gibco), 1.25 mM N-acetylcysteine (Sigma), 50 ng/ml human epidermal growth factor (R&D systems), 15 nM gastrin, 10 mM nicotinamide, 10 \u03bcM p38 MAPK inhibitor (Sigma), 600 nM TGF\u03b2 receptor inhibitor A83-01, and conditioned media for recombinant Noggin (15% v/v), Spondin (15% v/v), and Wnt3A (30% v/v) provided by dr. Kuo and Hubrecht Institute (Utrecht, the Netherlands). Organoids were passaged at a 1:5 ratio every 5 days using ice-cold DMEM by mechanical dissociation, centrifuged at 500 x g for 5 min, and plating in fresh Matrigel matrix droplets as previously described [11] .",

Jejunum organoids were grown for 3 and 12 weeks (4-17 passages) and extracted using ice-cold PBS. After washing twice in PBS, intact organoids were pelleted at 300 x g for 5 min and suspended in RLT lysis buffer and stored at -80\u00b0C prior to RNA isolation. Porcine jejunum epithelial cell line IPEC-J2 (ACC-701) was grown in DMEM F12 medium supplemented with 10% FBS and 5% penicillin/streptomycin (P/S, Gibco) in 75 cm 2 culture flasks. Data for one IPEC-J2 transcriptome was kindly provided by dr. Richard Crooijmans, via the Functional Annotation of ANimal Genomes (FAANG, BioSamples accession SAMEA4447551) [14] . For the analysis of the remaining two lines, IPEC-J2 at passage 87 and 91 were seeded at 5 x 10 4 cells/well in 24-well plates and grown to confluence within 48h with reduced P/S (1%). The monolayers were subsequently left to differentiate for 5 days, lysed using RLT-buffer, and stored at -80 \u00b0C prior to RNA isolation. Total RNA was extracted using an RNeasy mini-kit (Qiagen) following manufacturer's instructions including a 15 min on-column DNAse step. Preliminary tRNA concentrations, contamination and degradation were identified using Qubit (Thermo-Fisher) and gel-electrophoresis. The quantity and integrity of RNA was measured using a Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent).",

            "text": "The intestinal epithelium plays an essential role in the digestion and absorption of nutrients while also maintaining homeostasis with symbiotic microbiota [1] [2] [3] . The physical containment of microbes to the lumen and homeostasis of tolerance and immunity depends on the functions of different lineages of intestinal epithelial cell [2, 3] . For decades, scientists have exploited the replicative potential of immortalized intestinal cells as enterocyte models to study host-pathogen interactions and intestinal functions in vitro. Such monotypic cell models have led to important discoveries but have notable limitations. Immortalized cell lines can undergo significant genotypic alterations within a few passages in vitro which are potential threats to data reproducibility [4] [5] [6] . Furthermore, transformed cell lines often have altered pathway expression compared to primary cells [4] . Since 2009, when it was shown that intestinal adult leucine-rich repeat-containing G proteincoupled receptor 5 (LGR5+) stem cells [7] could be grown into organotypic cultures and propagated in 3D culture [8, 9] , there has been much interest in employing intestinal organoids as advanced models. A distinct advantage of organoids is the development of a crypt-villus axis with a similar spatial organisation of the heterotypic cell lineages found in the tissue of origin. Additionally, methods for generating polarised monolayers of organoids cells [10] have been optimised [11] to improve the versatility of the models, e.g. to study transport, and differential responses to luminal or basolateral stimulants. Another favourable property of organoids generated from adult intestinal stem cells is that they express specific functions associated with their original intestinal location [12] . This means that locationspecific functions of different parts of the intestine are intrinsically programmed in adult stem cells.",

However, there are some unresolved issues that need to be addressed to ensure reliability and reproducibility of results in this emerging field. As organoids contain different cell types there is potential for variability and problems with reproducibility which may compromise their application to phenotype individuals. To address this issue, we assessed the transcriptional stability of intestinal organoids differentiated from the same crypt batch and between organoids from different pigs over long-term passage. Furthermore, we compared expressed genes and pathways in organoids, the original epithelial tissue from which the organoids were derived, and IPEC-J2, a spontaneously transformed porcine cell line derived from the jejunum. The results show that intestinal organoids derived from adult stem cells closely resemble the epithelial tissue of origin in terms of expressed genes and provide a reference for researchers wishing to investigate specific small intestinal functions not present in IPECJ2.",

Only paired-end reads longer than 35 bp were included for further downstream analysis. Sequences were aligned against Ensembl Sus scrofa reference genome and annotation 11.1.91 [17] using Tophat (v2.1.1 [18] ). Transcriptomes were assembled with 5 bp intron overhang tolerance, merged, normalized, and analysed using the Cufflinks package (v2.2.1 [18] ). Differential expression was analysed with 0.01 false discovery rate (FDR) using cuffdiff with bias and weight correction and visualized in R using CummeRbund (v2.7.2 [18] ). Mapping analytics can be found in supplementary table S1. Fragments per kilobase million (FPKM) were calculated and logtransformed for downstream analysis. The sequencing data was also processed using CLC Genomics Workbench 11 (Qiagen) using identical reference genome, annotation and settings for identification of insertions/deletions, breakpoints, structural variants, and track generation.

Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA, Qiagen) was used for determining overlapping networks of expressed genes between tissue and organoids, and overall expression of molecular and cellular development of organoids between time-points.

Triplicate batches of each organoid were separately cultured for 12 weeks by passaging approximately every 5 days. After 3-and 12-weeks continuous culture (4-17 passages) RNA was isolated from the organoids for RNA sequencing ( Figure 1A ). Within the first 2 passages after isolation, the organoids acquired a budding phenotype, which might be attributed to whole crypt isolation also containing transit amplifying cells in differentiation stages; as opposed to basal culture after two weeks forming a more cyst-like phenotype. After 2 weeks continuous culture the organoids formed spheroids ( Fig 1B) but maintained different cell lineages, as shown with UEA-1 staining for Paneth and Goblet cells (Fig 1C) , and a constant chromosome count after 12 weeks (Fig 1D) . Similarly, RNA was isolated from the spontaneously transformed porcine jejunum cell line IPEC-J2 at passage number 67, 87 and 91. RNA sequencing data was analysed using a customised analysis pipeline and CLC genomics workbench 11. Multidimensional scaling showed the transcriptomes of the organoids clustered closely together, despite 12-weeks continuous passage and isolation from different pigs ( Fig. 2A) . It was also evident that the transcriptomes of the tissue and organoid samples were most similar, not separating in the first dimension, whereas IPEC-J2 separated from tissue in both dimensions. A correlation matrix of transcriptomic data from all samples revealed highest similarity for replicate samples of the same origin ( Fig 2B) .",

All samples shared expression of 9117 genes, and a large set of genes was commonly expressed between organoids and tissue exclusively (1762 genes; Fig 3A) . Genes associated with different overlapping areas of the Venn diagram were categorized by gene ontology using TOPPfun (Sup table X1 ). However, the dataset for expressed genes in organoids still contained 1304 genes not annotated denoted with an unknown gene ID, and after conversion to human orthologues using g:profiler [24] , only 121 of these unknown ID's with unknown function acquired a gene annotation (Sup table X2 ). Nevertheless, after conversion most of the 1304 genes did contain a gene description (80.6%). It is therefore evident that further curation of the porcine ontology database is necessary to generate a more comprehensive reference genome for transcriptomics research. The top clusters of pathways expressed in organoids are involved in basal molecular and cellular function as well as physiological system development, reflecting the interactions with extracellular factors and self-organisation of organoid microanatomy (Fig 3B) . Pathways of particular relevance for organoid models such as homeostasis and innate immunity were significantly expressed in organoids. Cellular homeostatic signalling or activation pathways included integrin, mTOR, Sirtuin, PPAR\u03b1 and RXR\u03b1, with typically more than 40% of genes in the annotation being expressed (Fig 3C) . Immunity-pathways included important cytokine and cytokine receptor signalling pathways (e.g. TNFR1, IL8, JAK/STAT, PKR) and innate immune signalling (NF-kB, ERK/MAPK, iNOS). Ingenuity pathway analysis of the 1762 expressed genes shared only between organoids and tissues revealed pathways associated with GPCR and Ephrin signalling, which is associated with processes such as cell migration and stem cell differentiation (Fig 4A) . Pathways associated with the endocrine functions of cells were also identified including signalling via tryptophan derived melatonin and serotonin.

Genes encoding complement factors were also specifically expressed in tissue and organoids. Recent studies integrating intestinal transcriptomes deposited in public databases suggest that intestinal expression of complement pathways plays a homeostatic role, being upregulated by inflammatory challenges to control microbial invasion or colonisation (Benis et al., personal communication, and [25] ). From this data it is evident that many complement factors are expressed in organoids and tissue (Fig 4B) . A key difference between IPEC-J2 and organoid or tissue was the specific expression of hormones associated with Enteroendocrine cells, such as CCK which induces secretion of digestive enzymes and PYY, a satiety hormone (Fig 4C) . The genes identified in the human protein atlas to be enriched in the small intestine (i.e. jejunum) [20, 26] were checked for expression in porcine jejunum tissue as well as organoids and IPEC-J2 cells. Most of the porcine orthologues (65% in tissue samples) were indeed expressed in epithelial tissue from the pig jejunum ( Fig 5A) . Moreover, between 74-86% of the porcine jejunum tissue-specific genes were also expressed in organoids, whereas only 32% were expressed in IPEC-J2 cells (Fig 5A) . Genes associated with general digestion (SI, FABP1), absorption (solute-carriers; SLC-genes), or immunity (IL22RA1) were exclusively expressed in the tissue and organoids. Some of the genes associated with secreted peptides for immunity and digestion were not expressed in organoids and IPEC-J2 (i.e. MEP1A, MEP1B, AQP10, CCL11). Genes which are specific for the different cell lineages found in the small intestinal epithelium [27] , were generally highly expressed in organoids (Fig 5B) but largely absent in IPECJ2. Surprisingly IPEC-J2 lacked expression of some genes commonly associated with mature absorptive enterocytes, even though cultures of this cell line are reported to differentiate into functional epithelium [28] . Initially our dataset suggested lack of mucin 2 (MUC2) gene expression using Ensembl gene annotation. However, we identified a high number of RNA-seq reads from organoids and tissue mapping to the chromosomal locus associated with MUC2 in the NCBI database (XM_021082584, Chromosome 2, bp 689,363-719,542) ( Fig 5C) . We verified the expression of MUC2 in porcine organoids and tissue using histology confirming mucin production and secretion as described previously [11, 13] (Fig 5D) . ",

All differentially expressed genes were distributed across 9 common ontologies ( Fig 7B) and consisted of only 1.93 to 3.67 % of the annotated genes in each biological process. This included processes such as small molecule biosynthesis, organic acid metabolic processes and response to nutrient levels. Variation in expression of genes in organoid cultures over time may therefore be due to differences in nutrient abundance in culture medium, and replicative activity, rather than permanent loss or gain of functions. Long-term passage also resulted in differential down regulation of 78 and 137 genes in organoids 1 and 2, respectively (n=3 per group, Fig 7C) . The only common ontology found for these genes was small molecule biosynthetic process, which was also included in genes upregulated after long term passage (Fig 6B) .

            "text": "Transformed and cancer cell lines commonly display aneuploidy and mutations affecting cellular physiology, which may further change during long-term passage. Intestinal organoids are considered an attractive alternative to transformed cell lines, but there are no studies evaluating the variability of the transcriptome in different batches of organoids generated from the same crypts and the effect of long-term culture on genomic stability and the transcriptome. In this study, we compared gene expression in the porcine transformed jejunum cell line IPECJ2, organoids derived from adult stems cells of the porcine jejunum and the intestinal tissue from which they were derived. The genes highly expressed in tissue, but not organoids or IPEC-J2, were mostly involved in immune cell, extracellular matrix or muscle contraction pathways. This is most likely due to the presence of elements of the (sub)mucosa, including lamina propria immune cells in the tissue sample. Porcine intestinal organoids possessed the different epithelial cell lineages found in tissue for at least 17 passages without apparent changes to the karyotype. An interesting observation in organoids was the high expression of LYZ which is often associated with Paneth cells. Until recently Paneth cells were considered to be absent in the porcine small intestine [32, 33] . Paneth cells facilitate regeneration of the intestinal mucosa after metaplasia and produce high amounts of LYZ in presence of intestinal disease or damage [34, 35] . The set of genes expressed in organoids closely resembled that of the tissue of origin, a characteristic reported for other types of organoids [36, 37] . Moreover, organoids expressed the majority of gene orthologues (>74%) associated with jejunum specific functions in humans for at least 17 passages, showing that the adult stem cells retain their locationspecific functions over long-term culture [12, 38] . Overall the batch to batch variation in organoids from the same animal was low, which may have been aided by concurrent passage and consequently differentiation state. The functions of genes which significantly altered expression between organoids from different animals or different cultures suggests they arise from differences in abundance of nutrients in culture medium or replicative activity, rather than permanent loss or gain of functions. The main described benefits of the jejunum cell line IPECJ2 are its non-cancerous origin and stability for more than 98 passages [28, 39] . However, we observed multiple indications of increased expression of genes associated with cancer or tumors in IPECJ2 (passage 67-91). For example, these included ANXA1 and CALD1 [40] , as well as insertions and deletions in the tumor suppressor APC [31] . We conclude that porcine jejunum organoids more closely resemble jejunum tissue than IPECJ2 and provide a robust model for gene expression studies for at least 12 weeks of culture. As such they provide an advanced model for mechanistic studies on host-microbe interactions and intestinal physiology [41] . Organoids are also likely to avoid changes in glycosylation patterns seen in cancer or transformed cell models. The RNA-seq data provides a valuable resource for researchers to assess the suitability of intestinal organoids for studying specific pathways or biological processes. Pig organoids can be rapidly generated from left over slaughter material without requirement for ethical approval. Thus, they have potential to be used to identify new phenotypes and investigate the role of genetic polymorphisms in susceptibility to enteric infections or other production traits. Furthermore, porcine intestinal physiology is considered to closely resemble that of humans increasing the potential for translation of results to humans. Moreover, recent progress in developing robust methods for generating 2D monolayers from 3D organoid cultures facilitates apical exposure to test substances and also opens up possibilities for studying epithelial transport [11, 42] .
