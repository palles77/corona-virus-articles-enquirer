            "text": "In recent decades, many new flavi-like viruses have been discovered predominantly in different invertebrates and, as was recently shown, some of them may cause disease in humans. The Jingmen tick virus (JMTV) group holds a special place among flavi-like viruses because, in contrast to the \"classic\" flaviviruses and other flavi-like viruses, they have a segmented ssRNA(+) genome. Two segments of the JMTV genome have homology with regions of the flavivirus genome encoding polymerase and helicase-protease proteins. JMTVs have several open reading frames (ORF) in segments encoding glycoprotein(s) and capsid protein and these ORF are specific only to them. JMTVs greatly differ in virion size. We isolated three strains of Alongshan virus (ALSV), which is a representative of the JMTV group, from adult Ixodes persulcatus ticks collected in two geographically-separated Russian regions in the tick cell line IRE/CTVM19. One of the strains persisted in the IRE/CTVM19 cells without cytopathic effect for three years. Most virions purified from tick cells were spherical with a diameter of approximately 40.5 nm. In addition, we found smaller particles of approximately 13.1 nm in diameter. We obtained full genome sequences of all four segments of two of the isolated ALSV strains, and partial sequences of one segment from the third strain. Phylogenetic analysis on genome segment 2 of the JMTV group clustered our novel strains with other ALSV strains. We found evidence for the existence of a novel upstream ORF in the glycoprotein-coding segment of ALSV and other members of the JMTV group. Significance Statement We isolated three strains of Alongshan virus (ALSV) from adult Ixodes persulcatus ticks from two geographically separate areas of Russia in the Ixodes ricinus tick cell line IRE/CTVM19. One of the strains persisted in the IRE/CTVM19 cells without cytopathic effect for three years. Our study confirmed the value of tick cell lines in virus isolation and maintenance of persistent infection. The majority of virions of the ALSV strain Miass527 were enveloped spherical particles with a diameter of 40.5\u00b13.7 nm. We found evidence for the existence of a novel upstream ORF in the glycoprotein-coding segment of ALSV and other members of the Jingmen tick virus group.",

Using codon alignment of four previously-described ALSV strains (MH158416, MN107154, MN107158, MN095520) and the three strains sequenced in this study, we discovered two regions of high conservation in the VP1a ORF ( Figure 4A ). The first one corresponded to the 3`-terminal region of the ORF. We believe that such high conservation in this region was caused by an overlap with the VP1b ORF.

Sequences MN095532 and KX377514 were found to have unknown nucleotides in the middle of the segment and were not used in the analysis. For these sequences, nuORF was confirmed to be intact. We then constructed a phylogenetic tree (Supplementary file 10) that allowed us to identify three groups (Jingmen, Yanggou and Alongshan viruses) that should be analysed separately due to phylogenetic distance. All JMTV sequences with full segment 2 (21 entries) known to date (November 8, 2019) have a nuORF. We performed analysis of the JMTV segment 2 sequences ( Figure 4B ) and Synplot2 showed high conservation in the first ~100-codon region. This demonstrates that the region associated with nuORF is conserved more highly than would be expected under neutral evolution in both ALSV and JMTV sequences.",

In addition, we found smaller particles with a diameter of 13.1\u00b12.1 nm, which had either electron-translucent or electron-dense cores. Presumably, they could represent either: a) glycoprotein aggregates, similar to the \"classic\" flavivirus nonstructural protein 1, which is i.e., slightly larger than the small particles that we saw in the same fraction of Miass527-infected .

Further investigations are needed to clarify the nature of these particles.",

The microscopy revealed that most virions of the strain Miass527 were enveloped spherical particles with a diameter of 40.5\u00b13.7 nm (Figure 2, A, B, Supplementary file 4). They had either electron-translucent or electron-dense cores. The viral particles with an electron-dense core could have lost genomic RNA (Figure 2, B, Supplementary file 6). In the same gradient fraction we found small spherical particles with a diameter of 13.1\u00b12.1 nm, which had electron-translucent or electron-dense cores (Figure 2, C, D, Supplementary file 5). These small particles could be virions with incomplete genome, protein structures or some other unidentified component of IRE/CTVM19 cells. The pellet obtained after ultracentrifugation of uninfected IRE/CTVM19 culture supernate was separated by sucrose density gradient ultracentrifugation.

Segment 1 contained a flavivirus-NS5-like protein with polymerase and putative methyltransferase domains and a predicted signal peptide on the N-terminus of the protein. Segment 3 contained a flavivirus NS3-like protein with proposed functions of serine protease and RNA helicase (Figure 3). Both proteins had transmembrane regions corresponding to the previously-mapped strain H3. Segment 4 contained two non-flavivirus-related ORFs. There was a slippery sequence (G GTT TTT) and some evidence of an RNA-structured region (Supplementary file 7) and we believe that the VP3 ORF may be expressed via -1 ribosome frameshifting (Figure 3), as was previously shown for other ALSV strains. Regarding the VP1a and VP1b ORFs in segment 2, transmembrane regions and N-glycosylation sites were also in positions in the predicted amino acid sequences similar to the other ALSV strains",

            "text": "while the isolation of the virus detected in Finnish ticks failed in Vero and two human cell lines(Kuivanen et al., 2019). The Chinese JMTV strain isolated from A. javanense ticks replicated successfully in the R. microplus embryo-derived tick cell line BME/CTVM23 but failed to grow in Vero, DH82 (canine monocyte-macrophage-derived cells) and C6/36 (Aedes albopictus mosquito) cells(Jia et al., 2019). We isolated three tick-derived strains of ALSV using the tick cell line IRE/CTVM19; our results, together with those of the previous studies reporting successful in vitro isolation and continuous propagation of JMTV group viruses(Jia et al., 2019;Wang et al., 2019aWang et al., , 2019b, suggest the possibility that mammal-derived viruses will more readily infect mammalian cells, while tick-derived viruses may be more infective for tick cells. However, additional isolations of JMTV group viruses will be required to test this theory and the possible underlying genetic causes. For the first time we showed that the ALSV strain Miass527 can persist in tick cells for at least three years. It was previously shown that the tick cell line IRE/CTVM19 may harbour an unknown rhabdovirus(Bell-Sakyi and Attoui, 2016). Our experiment confirmed the presence of a rhabdovirus and suggests that it does not interfere with the persistence and active reproduction of ALSV in IRE/CTVM19 cells. Persistent infection in tick cells and ticks could affect virus properties, as was previously shown for tick-borne encephalitis virus(Belova et al., 2017).",

            "text": "80% amino acid identity in the NS5-like protein), it is likely that the nuORF indeed encodes a functional virus protein. Nevertheless, further studies are needed to confirm its expression and function during the virus life cycle.Interestingly, an ORF of a more distant member of the JMTV group, the mosquito-borne Guaico Culex virus(Ladner et al., 2016), was discovered in the same genome region. It also encodes a small protein, but with no amino acid identity to the nuORF. A mass spectrometry analysis of the Guaico Culex virus virion proteins did not identify any peptides that belong to this putative ORF, thus making its product (if it is indeed expressed) a nonstructural protein(Ladner et al., 2016).If the nuORF product protein is indeed functional at some point during ALSV replication, it would most likely be a minor membrane protein. Such proteins are present in a variety of RNA viruses and perform different functions. For example, in flaviviruses, small membrane proteins NS2B and NS4A (with sizes similar to the nuORF) perform multiple functions, ranging from enzyme cofactors(Lindenbach and Rice, 2003;Shiryaev et al., 2009) to participation in particle formationMu\u00f1oz-Jordan et al., 2003) and protection against the cellular antiviral response. Influenza A M2 protein acts as a proton-selective ion channel (DiMaio, 2014), whereas Coronavirus E protein acts as a viroporin and plays a role in induction of the regulation of the unfolded protein response(Schoeman and Fielding, 2019). Nevertheless, confirmation of the nuORF expression and understanding of its possible functions should be subjects for further studies.",
