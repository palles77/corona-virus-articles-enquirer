The drive for more complete structural characterization of proteins and their interactions, coupled with the increasing availability of instrumentation and easy-to-use software for data analysis and interpretation, is expanding the utility of the technique beyond the domain of the biophysicist and into the realm of the protein scientist. However, the absence of publication standards and the ease with which 3D models can be calculated against the inherently 1D scattering data means that an understanding of sample quality, data quality, and modeling assumptions is essential to have confidence in the results. This review is intended to provide a road map through the small-angle scattering experiment, while also providing a set of guidelines for the critical evaluation of scattering data. Examples of current best practice are given that also demonstrate the power of the technique to advance our understanding of protein structure and function.",

            "text": "The small-angle scattering of X-rays from macromolecules in solution and its relationship to basic shape information has been understood for over 80 years. 1 The earliest biological small-angle X-ray scattering experiments, performed in the 1950s, necessarily used easily purified proteins such as hemoglobin and ovalbumin. Although data interpretation at that time was restricted to relatively simple parameters, such as radius of gyration, it was believed even then that the most important application of small-angle scattering would be to the study of biological macromolecules. 2 In the 1970s and 1980s, the molecular biology revolution and advances in instrumentation saw some growth in applications of the technique. A significant advance in this period was in the use of small-angle neutron scattering with contrast variation to characterize the shapes and dispositions of components within bimolecular complexes. Neutron contrast variation revealed that DNA was wrapped around the outside of nucleosome core particles providing an understanding of how DNA was packaged in chromosomes 3 22 years before the first high-resolution crystal structure of the nucleosome appeared. 4 Through the 1970s and 1980s, two groups, Engelman and Moore and coworkers, and May et al., used neutron contrast variation to systematically map the positions of protein and RNA subunits within the ribosome leading to a comprehensive map of the 30S subunit 5 and a partial map of the larger 50S subunit. 6 It would take another 8 years before the first high-resolution crystal structure of the large subunit of the ribosome would appear. 7 With the sophistication and, at the time, unique nature of these experiments, the main challenge lay in data interpretation, and experts in theoretical and computational methods were required for data analysis and modeling. These difficulties have largely been overcome by the ready availability of powerful desk top computers and the development and continual improvement of data interpretation and modeling tools; today the most widely used is the ATSAS suite of programs from the Hamburg EMBL (European Molecular Biology Laboratory) group led by Svergun and coworkers 8 as it has been developed explicitly for structural biology applications and is readily downloaded from the web complete with user manuals. These developments have made small-angle scattering accessible to the broader structural biology community. Consequently, the scope of questions that can now be answered by small-angle scattering is growing rapidly, and its potential application to biology has never been greater.",

In the case of crystallography and NMR, the pressure to develop such standards grew as the techniques became more widely used, and so the development of broadly accepted standards must also evolve as the use of small-angle scattering continues to grow. As small-angle scattering yields data that are inherently one-dimensional, and the user invariably is looking to support a three-dimensional model, overinterpretation of the data will always be a risk if not given careful consideration. Importantly, the absence of quality control in sample characterization and data reduction can mislead the experimenter. In this review, we describe the small-angle scattering experiment, its range of application, and the necessary quality control measures. A particular emphasis is given to the importance of standards for demonstrating sample quality, and the power of other biophysical and biochemical methods in providing constraints for modeling that will reduce the likelihood of overinterpretation of the scattering data. It is intended that this review be a guide to the nonspecialist small-angle scattering experimenter, so that they may avoid potential pitfalls as the biological applications continue to expand into new territory.",

            "text": "X-rays and neutrons have properties of plane waves, that is, amplitude and wavelength, and as they pass through matter, secondary wavelets are generated by interactions with individual atoms, and the resulting coherent scattering can constructively or destructively interfere. The diffraction patterns from proteins in crystals that are exploited in crystallography are the result of such interference, between wavelets scattered by atoms within protein molecules that are regularly spaced in the crystal lattice. Small-angle scattering arises from the coherent secondary wavelets that are scattered by atoms within a single molecule, and as a result it is observed for molecules in crystals or in solution. Although small-angle solution scattering is often described as a low-resolution technique (as it does not provide information on atomic coordinates), it is more appropriate to describe it as a technique capable of providing high-precision information with respect to size and shape. 9 It is the rotational averaging of the molecules in solution that limits the information content of small-angle scattering more than the resolution limits of the experiment. Indeed, although crystallographers refer to resolution in terms of the highest angle data measured, as it is a measure of the smallest distances between scattering centers that can be resolved, the small-angle scattering specialist will refer to the resolution limits more often in terms of the smallest angles for which data can be measured as it is this resolution limit that determines the longest distances that can be characterized by the data. This effect is a direct result of the reciprocal nature of the scattering data with respect to real space dimensions, and the condition for the minimum angle required to characterize a scattering particle with a given maximum dimension is given below.",

Traditionally, the radiation is of a single wavelength (or narrow band of wavelengths), although the development of pulsed neutron sources has led to time-offlight neutron scattering instruments that can use white radiation to maximize flux. The scattered radiation is recorded on a detector, while the direct beam is usually absorbed by a beam stop; the size and position of which are key factors determining the minimum angle measured in an experiment. New developments in solid-state devices have led to detectors that can absorb an intense direct X-ray beam without incurring damage.",

Just as a diffraction image can be Fourier transformed to obtain the Patterson function that is used to locate heavy atom positions in X-ray crystallography, so too can an I(q) profile be Fourier transformed to give P(r) (the radial Patterson function), which describes the probable frequency of interatomic vector lengths (r) within a protein. The P(r) profile is sensitive to the symmetry and domain structure within proteins and as such can yield information concerning the shape and volume occupied by a protein or protein complex. An excellent demonstration of the effect of protein shape on the P(r) curve is reported in Figure 5 , page 1746 of Svergun and Koch. 10 Because scattering data can only be measured over a finite q range, P(r) calculations depend upon indirect Fourier transform methods and as such they depend upon assumptions, such as the fact that P(r) is zero at r \u00bc 0 and at the maximum linear dimension, D max . As a result, D max is a ''soft'' or model parameter in the interpretation of scattering data, and its uncertainty is highly dependent on the quality of the scattering data. Further, data must be measured to q values <p/D max to accurately characterize the longest dimensions of the particle. 11 It is generally not valid to assign an error to D max .",

The scattering powers of nuclei are determined by the properties of the neutron-nucleus interaction and vary in a nonsystematic manner with atomic number and isotopes of the same element can exhibit very different neutron scattering powers. One of the largest differences in neutron scattering power is that between naturally abundant hydrogen ( 1 H) and its stable isotope deuterium ( 2 H or D). It is therefore possible, in a small-angle neutron scattering experiment, to have different contrasts for two interacting proteins if one protein is deuterated. A contrast series is obtained by Figure 2 . Small-angle scattering from a complex between a deuterated and nondeuterated protein: the contrast variation experiment. The figure illustrates contrast variation using a structure (PDB: 3GMR) of T-cell surface glycoprotein CD1d1 in complex with beta-2 microglobulin. Theoretical scattering profiles were generated for the protein complex in which the beta-2 microglobulin component had its nonexchangeable hydrogens deuterated to 60% in silico. 66 (A) The proteins each have the same electron density and hence X-ray scattering density and the small-angle X-ray scattering profile therefore yield information on the shape of the entire complex as a uniform contrast (depicted as all black) particle. (B) The neutron scattering contrast for the deuterated (90% gray) and nondeuterated (40% gray) components is distinct, and it is therefore possible to measure scattering from each individual component by solvent matching the scattering density of the other by H/ D substitution in the solvent. The nondeuterated protein will be solvent matched around 40% D 2 O, whereas the deuterated protein's solvent match point will be 90% D 2 O, this value depending upon the deuteration level of the protein (60% in this example). (C) A theoretical set of data acquired for different %D 2 O in the solvent (a contrast series) yields information on the shapes and dispositions of the deuterated and nondeuterated proteins. From the contrast series, it is possible to extract scattering profiles corresponding to the deuterated and nondeuterated components (red and blue, respectively) and a crossterm (green) that is related to their relative dispositions. Note that because of the smaller size of the deuterated component, the corresponding P(r) needs to be multiplied by a factor of five to observe the curve clearly. Also, the cross-term contains negative values for I(q) and therefore must be plotted on a linear scale.",

The presence of inappropriate disulfide formation can be detected by SDS-PAGE run with and without b-mercaptoethanol (BME). The nonreducing gel will contain higher MW species corresponding to dimers, trimers, and so forth, of the sample protein if disulfide-mediated aggregation is present.

This parameter (along with partial specific volume and Dq) can be critical for data evaluation (see later) as an accurate MW determination can be used to demonstrate sample monodispersity. Accurate concentrations are also required if the oligomerization state of the sample is to be investigated. Typically, concentrations are determined spectrophotometrically by measuring the absorbance at 280 nm, using calculated extinction coefficients. 14 The accuracy of this method is related to the extinction coefficient of the protein, its purity, and the absorption properties buffer constituents. Results obtained from proteins carrying no tryptophan residues must be treated with skepticism as errors significantly greater than 10% have been observed. Inaccuracies in protein concentration can mislead the experimenter, especially if one is depending on I(0) for the determination of the MW or volume of the scattering particle. Great care must be taken to ensure sample purity (small amounts of highly absorbing contaminants such as nucleic acids can result in overestimation of sample concentration). Solvent blanks can also be a source of error. For example, when using DTT to maintain reducing conditions or as a free radical absorber to minimize radiation damage (see later), one needs to be aware that there can be different rates of DTT oxidation between the proteincontaining samples and buffers. These differences can result in a net difference in the measured UV absorbance at 280 nm of a sample against its solvent blank as DTT absorbs strongly in this region as its absorbance is dependent on its oxidation state.",

Solvent mismatch is often best minimized by using a last step dialysate as the solvent blank. Often, samples need to be concentrated before the scattering experiment, and it is tempting to use the filtrate from a centrifugal device as the solvent blank.

Radiation-induced aggregation must be assessed on a case-by-case basis as it depends upon characteristics such as molecular mass, composition, and structure of each individual protein. As the effects are dose-dependent, a useful strategy for X-ray scattering experiments is to collect several exposures and compare the resultant scattering profiles. Radiation-induced aggregation will be evident in increasing R g and I(0) values with time. Multiple exposures allow the experimenter to determine how long an exposure the sample can withstand before the data become unusable. If no time dependence for the R g and I(0) values is observed, the data from the multiple exposures can be combined into one dataset for analysis. For some laboratory-based X-ray instruments, it is impractical to collect data for multiple periods of sufficiently short duration for this approach. In these cases, performing SDS-PAGE before and after sample irradiation is good practice for each new protein under study. Because of the low energy of cold neutrons (equivalent to infrared electromagnetic energies), radiation damage is rarely seen in neutron scattering. The term 'cold neutrons' refers to the fact that the longest wavelength (4-6 \u00c5 ) neutrons are used for small-angle neutron scattering to maximize resolution (q min ) and these wavelengths are obtained by passing thermal neutrons through a cold source, such as liquid hydrogen.",

If the sample contains monodisperse, identical particles, and the data are measured to low enough q to reliably characterize their largest dimensions, then the plot will have a discernable flat region in the lowest q regime. 20 The next analysis should be a Guinier plot, which is most sensitive to the longest distances present in the sample. A source of bias for the long-distance information in the scattering signal is protein aggregation, which can cause an upturn in the Guinier plot (which can be dramatic or simply appear as a ''smiling'' Guinier) and associated increases in the observed R g and I(0) values. A downturn in the Guinier plot (the ''frowning'' Guinier) is symptomatic of interparticle interference-an effect due to correlated distances between particles in solution caused by Coulombic repulsion 21 (discussed later). Examples of Guinier plots for lysozyme data are shown in Figure 3(D-F) . Importantly, if aggregation (including oligomerization) or interparticle interference is sufficiently subtle, the Guinier plot can be perfectly linear, but the R g and I(0) values will not be accurate, being either too large or too small, respectively, and thus bias any 3D modeling performed using the scattering data. 22 A linear Guinier plot is therefore necessary, but not sufficient, for the accurate interpretation of globular proteins, and good practice is to always show it along with the secondary standards that confirm the scattering particle has the expected volume or mass (see below).",

Proteins do not have hard surfaces, and as such, the distribution of longest dimensions is expected to approach zero (at D max ) in a concave fashion as viewed from above the horizontal axis [ Fig. 3(G,J) ]. An abrupt arrival of P(r) at zero suggests that the chosen D max is artificially short. Badly aggregated samples may give small peaks in Figure 3 . Effects of interparticle interference and aggregation on small-angle scattering data. It is often difficult to assess sample quality from I(q) plots alone (A-C). Guinier plots (D-F) can be instructive, as deviations from linearity are clear indicators of interparticle interference (E, orange) or aggregation (F, red). The P(r) presented with a single chosen D max (G-I) can be deceptive, and it is possible that only severe aggregation is detected (I, red). Behavior of the P(r) at extended D max values (J-L) gives the clearest indication of sample quality. It is important to note that the subtle cases (K, dark yellow and L, magenta) may escape detection by these initial data inspection methods, and as such comparison of the data to secondary standards is essential. In evaluating these differences of around 1 \u00c5 in R g , it is important to note that such a difference is well outside the precision with which R g can be determined (generally to within a few tenths of \u00c5 for a small-to medium-sized protein), and that this degree of inaccuracy will significantly bias any 3D modeling performed against the scattering data. P(r) at high r values or the P(r) curve may never approach zero appropriately [ Fig. 3(I,L) ], whereas samples exhibiting interparticle interference will reach D max at artificially small values [ Fig. 3(H,K) ]. In some cases, especially where the scattering molecules have flexibility, it may be difficult to choose D max . In these cases, Guinier-determined R g and I(0) values may be used as a guide. Importantly, one must always keep in mind that D max is a soft parameter in P(r) modeling; for high quality data with accurate background subtractions D max can be chosen with reasonable reliability, but confidence in the choice of D max depends upon understanding how the P(r) transform behaves for a range of chosen D max values. The emergence of easy to apply 3D modeling methods has led to a practice of skipping or failing to report P(r) and Guinier analyses, yet these are important steps in evaluating data quality and sample integrity.",

(2), I(0) is proportional to the sample concentration (C); however, aggregation or interparticle interference effects can complicate this relationship. A decrease in I(0)/C with increasing C is indicative of interparticle interference and will be accompanied by an apparent decrease in R g . Such effects are often linearly dependent on concentration and can therefore be eliminated by extrapolation to infinite dilution. 23 Alternatively, charge screening (by increasing the ionic strength of the solvent) or adjusting the pH to nearer the isoelectric point of the protein can perturb the Coulombic repulsion and reduce the interference effect. 24 An increase in I(0)/ C, and accompanying increase in R g with C, indicates concentration-dependent aggregation or oligomerization. In the latter case, this can be instructive, as monomer-multimer equilibria may be present in solution (an example of such a study is the measurement of the monomer-dimer equilibrium constant for the SARS CoV main proteinase 25 ). It may be possible to find a low concentration range where the aggregation is eliminated; alternatively, changes in pH or ionic strength may be helpful. A concentration series should always be measured to demonstrate that the data are free of effects that would bias any structural interpretation. The subtle example of interparticle interference shown in Figure 3 may not have been detected had a concentration series not been performed.",

Verification that the scattering particle has the expected MW or volume is perhaps the most important measure to ensure that the structural parameters and interpretation are accurate for the molecule of interest. Few published small-angle scattering experiments report calibrated I(0)s and those that do often do not provide sufficient information to demonstrate the accuracy of this calibration. This lack of standard practice is a significant issue for those who want to assess the reliability of the data interpretation. Typically, the I(0)s are calibrated in one of two ways: by comparison with a known particle of similar composition such as a protein standard or by placing the data on an absolute scale using the scattering from water. Both methods require accurate protein concentration determination of the molecule of interest. When the secondary standard is a protein, the standard will typically have a large extinction coefficient at 280 nm and is measured under conditions in which it is known to be monodisperse and free of interparticle interference effects (e.g., glucose isomerase 26 or lysozyme 27 ). The measured I(0) values, normalized to concentration (in mg/mL) and expected MW, should be constant, provided that the molecule of interest and the standard are of similar mean contrast and the same partial specific volume [Eq. (3)]. If the molecule (or complex) has a different scattering density than the standard (e.g., proteins and polynucleotides), the differences in contrast and partial specific volume must be accounted for. Because I(0) is proportional to the square of the partial specific volume and contrast, small errors or differences in these parameters can result in quite large errors in the MW determinations. Hence, great care must be taken to understand the assumptions behind these calculations and the accuracy of each parameter.",

Subsequent to our scattering experiments, we solved the crystal structure of Sda and observed a tight hexamer that caused us to test our earlier conclusions from the scattering data. 32 Multiangle laser light scattering combined with a reexamination of the NMR data suggested that the trimer was weakly associated and probably an artifact of the high protein concentration required for structural analysis. Further reexamination of the scattering data revealed that the trimer was a significantly better fit to the scattering data than the dimer; the v 2 for the fit dropping to 0.85 (with no steric clashes) from 1.08 (with some steric clashes).

As stated above, rotational averaging limits the information content in a small-angle scattering experiment. As such, the data are susceptible to overinterpretation with the increasing parameterization of any modeling calculation. This problem is not unique to small-angle scattering. In crystallographic refinement, overparame-terization is indicated by a significant drop in the R factor without a concomitant drop in the free-R factor. 33 In this situation, restraints are applied (such as noncrystallographic symmetry and geometric restraints) to reduce the degrees of freedom in the refined parameters. The limited information content of the small-angle scattering experiment prevents the calculation of a free-R factor equivalent, and so an understanding of the nature of the modeled parameters is essential to avoid overinterpretation. To that end, an ''Occam's razor'' approach is recommended, that is, that additional parameters be introduced only when simpler models fail to adequately explain the data. Additionally, data from complimentary techniques can be a powerful source of restraints to greatly improve the confidence in the uniqueness of best-fit models. Conversely, inconclusive modeling can indicate a need for restraints and hence direct further experimentation. Here, we discuss some of the applications of small-angle scattering, the type of analyses that are appropriate, and the nature of additional information that can be used to provide restraints.",

The dummy atom approach allows multiple models to be generated. The program DAMAVER 47 may be used to place models into structurally similar classes and then generate an average structure from each class. It is tempting to use the number of models generated in each class as an assessment of the likelihood that average structure is correct. However, this probability argument is insufficient grounds for dismissing a particular class, and additional information (such as structure predictions, domain models, or EM data) is required. On the other hand, one class of models having a significantly greater goodness-of-fit measure to the experimental data can be grounds for favoring that averaged model. It is unusual for ab initio structures to be presented alone as they are highly parameterized models and seldom yield biologically relevant information. As small-angle scattering provides information on the large-scale features, it is often possible to model multisubunit proteins based on high-resolution structures of domains, either of the protein in question or from structural homologues. Although it is possible to superpose the atomic structures on the ab initio model using SUPCOMB, 48 it is often more useful, and more revealing, to perform rigid-body refinement against the scattering data using SAS-REF. 49 As one or more molecules are free to move in space, rigid-body refinement can also suffer from overparameterization, and multiple nonunique solutions may be obtained. To reduce this problem, distance and symmetry constraints (obtained from mutagenesis, FRET, or residual dipolar coupling from NMR) can be included in the modeling calculation. SASREF is also capable of modeling against multiple datasets, such as those derived from a neutron contrast variation series or X-ray data from subcomponents of a modular protein or complex. This increase in the number of input scattering curves again helps in addressing the problem of the uniqueness of possible solutions. Here again, however, care needs to be taken to demonstrate that all the scattering curves relate to the same structure; for example, in the case of a neutron contrast series, I(0) analysis is needed to demonstrate that there is no D 2 O-induced aggregation; in the case of X-ray scattering from subunits or truncated proteins, one needs to demonstrate that the truncation or disassociation has not induced conformational changes.",

In practice, model structures are often missing loops and/or interdomain linkers that may be disordered. The program BUNCH 49 is capable of performing the rigid-body refinement while modeling missing loops as dummy residues. BUNCH is especially useful for multidomain proteins where X-ray scattering has been performed on various partial constructs, such as polypyrimidine tract binding protein. 50 The use of a combination of ab initio shape restoration and rigid-body refinement is demonstrated by the study of the N-terminal domain organization of cardiac myosin binding protein C (cMyBP-C). 51 DAMMIN revealed an elongated structure consistent with four folded domains. With that information, it was possible to construct homology models (consistent with analysis by circular dichroism spectropolarimetry) for the two unknown domains. Combined with NMR structures for the known domains, a rigid-body model was refined with BUNCH to yield a model consistent with the original DAMMIN structure. This model was then used in a small-angle neutron scattering study to demonstrate that cMyBP-C decorates actin filaments with implications for the regulation of heart muscle contraction. 52 Other demonstrations of ab initio modeling of such modular proteins include the transcriptional regulator PUR-a 53 and the protein filamin, 54 which crosslinks the cell membrane with the cytoskeleton. In the latter example, the small-angle scattering results drove further NMR studies to reveal a previously unseen immunoglobulin domain-pairing interaction.",

This strategy allows the extraction of scattering functions describing each component and the cross-term relating their positions in space. 13 Neutron contrast variation studies also obviate the need for perfectly matching the component and solvent scattering densities. A good example of such a scenario is the complex formed between the sporulation histidine kinase, KinA, and its inhibitor, Sda, from Bacillus subtilis. 31 By deuterating Sda and performing small-angle neutron scattering with contrast variation on the complex, it was possible to extract structural information for each component. The binding of the inhibitor caused a compaction of the dimeric KinA (seen as a reduction in R g and D max compared with the X-ray scattering), and an increase in the apparent dimension of the Sda component resulting from the two Sda molecules binding on opposite sides of the kinase dimer. A structural homologue of KinA and the NMR structure of Sda were used in rigidbody modeling against the entire contrast series data (including X-ray scattering) using SASREF7 (which incorporates the contrast information). A similar experiment was performed for the complex between KinA and its second inhibitor KipI [pictured in Fig. 1(D) , third panel from left]. 60 The results of these two experiments showed that the inhibitors bind the base of the KinA dimerization domain and not the flexible hinge between the dimerization and catalytic domains as had been previously proposed. 30 With this information, redirected mutagenesis and biochemical studies 61 led to new understanding of the mechanisms involved in bacterial signaling pathways; particularly, that KipI and Sda inhibited not only the autokinase reaction but also the phosphotransferase reaction. The crystal structure of a homologous kinase, KinB, from Geobacillus stearothermophilus, also was solved in complex with Sda, 62 confirming that the Sda binding site was correctly predicted by the neutron scattering model, albeit with a 180 rotation of Sda-information that was beyond the resolution of the smallangle scattering experiment.",
