            "text": "The genus Rotavirus is classified as a member of the family Reoviridae of the RNA viruses. Rotaviruses are round particles 68 nm in diameter and are composed of two separate shells (capsids). The capsids surround a 38-nm icosahedral core structure, which in turn encloses the 11 double strands of RNA in the core. This structure gives the virus its characteristic appearance of a wide-rimmed wheel with spokes radiating from the hub, from which its name was derived (rota is Latin for \"wheel\"). 8 Rotaviruses are classified based on antigenic properties of various proteins found in the capsid structure. The VP6 protein on the inner capsid of the virus determines the rotavirus group. 9 Most viruses infecting humans are classified as group A, although rotaviruses from groups B and C have occasionally been associated with human diarrheal disease as well. The next level of classification is the subgroup, which is determined by other antigenic differences among the VP6 proteins. At least two subgroups are known to exist. 9 Subgroup typing has proved important in the study of patients who experience more than one episode of rotaviral infection. In these patients, recurrent infections usually but not necessarily involve agents of different subgroups, which suggests that subgroup antigens are not sufficient for inducing the production of protective antibodies. 10 Finally, the rotaviruses are classified into a variety of serotypes based on the antigenic differences of VP7 glycoprotein or the VP4 protease-sensitive hemagglutinin proteins that are found in the outer capsid. 11 VP4 is designated as the P antigenic protein because it is cleaved by the protease trypsin at the intestinal level, and VP7 is designated as the G antigenic protein because it is a glycosylated structure. There are at least 42 different G/P strains with different serotype combinations. However, five serotypes, G1P8, G2P4, GP8, G4P8, and G9P8, are the predominant circulation rotavirus G/P serotypes. 12 The prevalence of serotypes can fluctuate from year to year, 13 and although the five most common serotypes are responsible for approximately 95% of infections worldwide, there are substantial geographical differences. For example, in a recent global study, G1P8 was responsible for more than 70% of infections in North America, Australia, and Europe but less than 30% in South America, Asia, and Africa. 14 ",

Respiratory transmission has been suggested but not proved. 16 Rotavirus is highly contagious because very few infectious virions are needed to cause disease in susceptible hosts. 17 Although the virus may affect all age groups, it most commonly produces disease in children between 6 and 24 months of age. Before vaccination, most children developed rotavirus antibodies by the age of 2 years, which helps to explain the observed decreased incidence of rotaviral infection in later",

Diarrhea caused by rotavirus usually lasts from 2 to 8 days. 25 Shedding of virus into the intestinal lumen begins about 3 days after infection and may persist for as long as 3 weeks. 26 A comparison of the characteristics of rotaviral infections with those of other enteric viruses is presented in Table 39 -1. In addition to gastrointestinal symptoms, patients with rotavirus often have respiratory tract symptoms. 16 Unlike fever and vomiting, none of the respiratory manifestations associated with rotavirus infection are helpful in the recognition of rotaviral disease. 27 The clinical symptoms of rotavirus infection are more severe in patients with underlying malnutrition. In the malnourished murine rotavirus model, a smaller inoculum is required for infection, less time is required for incubation, and the symptoms are more severe. 28 In addition, rotavirus replication can occur in the liver and kidney, at least in immunocompromised hosts. 29 Children and adults who are immunocompromised because of congenital immunodeficiency or because of bone marrow or solid organ transplantation sometimes experience severe or prolonged rotavirus gastroenteritis. 7 The severity of rotavirus disease among children infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is thought to be similar to that among children without HIV infection. 7",

In this outbreak, only some of the patients had diarrhea; the predominant clinical manifestation was vomiting and nausea. Virus particles were visualized by immune electron microscopy on fecal material derived from the Norwalk outbreak. This represented the first definitive association between a specific virus (Norwalk virus) and acute gastroenteritis. Subsequently a number of similar etiologic agents were identified; before the cloning of the prototype Norwalk virus genome, 45 these viruses, which were a group of morphologically diverse, positive-stranded RNA viruses that caused acute gastroenteritis, were identified as Norwalk-like agents. These organisms were also named for the communities in which they were first isolated (e.g., Montgomery County, Hawaii, Snow Mountain, Taunton, Otofuke, and Sapporo viruses). Based on reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), the sequence structure of these viruses has enabled their classification as human caliciviruses (HuCV). Human caliciviruses are now recognized as a leading cause of diarrhea worldwide among persons of all ages. 46 With the use of molecular tools, HuCV have now been preliminarily classified into four genotypes, represented by Norwalk virus, Snow Mountain agent, Sapporo virus, and hepatitis E virus. 47, 48 Recently the nomenclature of two genotypes has changed, renaming Norwalk virus as norovirus and Sapporo virus as sapovirus. 49 This HuCV classification system may allow the development of assays based on recombinant HuCV antigens or PCR products rather than the current cumbersome classification schemes that rely on human reagents (convalescent outbreak sera) of varying sensitivity and specificity. Molecular tools have already allowed the identification of HuCV as agents of both pediatric and adult viral gastroenteritis in foodborne outbreaks as well as outbreaks in nursing homes, hospitals, and a university setting. Despite the potential for future understanding of the contribution of individual HuCV to outbreaks of nonbacterial gastroenteritis, Norwalk virus still remains the prototypic agent of HuCV, and it is described in greater detail in the following section.",

            "text": "Transmission of norovirus is most often fecal-oral. Unlike rotavirus, this usually involves the spread of infection to a large population through a common source rather than from direct, person-to-person contact. In one outbreak, an infected bakery employee transmitted the virus through food products to approximately 3000 people. 52 Outbreaks have also been related to ingestion of raw oysters and clams and to contaminated water supplies. Spread of this disease has been documented in closed-in populations such as those in long-term care facilities and cruise ships. 53 In addition to its fecal-oral spread, there is some evidence that norovirus is transmitted through a respiratory route in the form of aerosolized particles from vomitus. Contamination of environmental surfaces with norovirus has been documented during outbreaks. 54 Although previously referred to as \"winter vomiting disease,\" norovirus produces outbreaks of disease that can occur throughout the year. 55 Several characteristics of norovirus facilitate their spread in epidemics: (1) low infectious dose (fewer than 10 viral particles), (2) prolonged viral shedding, (3) stability of the virus in relatively high concentrations of chlorine and a wide range of temperatures, and (4) the fact that repeated infections can occur with reexposure. 46 Pathophysiology. The histologic changes induced by norovirus in an infected host have been studied in small bowel biopsies from infected volunteers. Those volunteers who remained free of clinical symptoms had normal biopsy specimens, whereas those with symptoms exhibited marked, but not specific, changes, including focal areas of villous flattening and disorganization of epithelial cells. On electron microscopy, microvilli were shortened, and there was dilatation of the endoplasmic reticulum. These volunteers had repeat biopsies 2 weeks after the illness, and normal histology was again present. Other investigators have demonstrated the presence of normal gastric and rectal histology in patients affected by norovirus as is typical of viral gastroenteritis. Using norovirus virus-like particles (derived from capsid proteins) researchers have recently demonstrated that human histo-blood group antigens may act as receptors for norovirus infection 56, 57 and may explain the varying host susceptibility observed in outbreaks and volunteer studies. 58 Clinical Manifestations. The clinical manifestations of disease produced by the norovirus include nausea, vomiting, and cramping abdominal pain (see Table 39 -1). Diarrhea is said to be a less consistent feature of this illness. In the original outbreak, only 44% of patients experienced diarrhea, whereas 84% had vomiting. Other studies, however, have found that diarrhea occurs in most children and experimentally infected adult volunteers who become ill from this virus. Fever occurs in approximately one third of affected patients, but respiratory symptoms are not typically a part of this illness. An incubation period of approximately 24 to 48 hours has been noted before the onset of symptoms, 50 and symptoms persist for 12 to 48 hours. The typical symptoms of infection are in part also seen in premature infants but with a huge variety of clinical courses including abdominal distention, apnea, and sepsis-like appearance. 59 Diagnosis and Treatment. Norwalk virus could be detected in fecal samples for a median of 4 weeks and for up to 8 weeks after virus inoculation; peak virus titers are most commonly found in fecal samples collected after resolution of symptoms, and presymptomatic shedding was more common in persons who did not meet the definition of clinical gastroenteritis. 60 RT-PCR assays have been developed for detection of noroviruses in clinical and environmental specimens, such as water and food. 61,62 RT-PCR followed by nucleotide sequencing has been useful in epidemiologic studies, and also various commercial stool enzyme immunoassay (EIA) detection methods have been developed 46 ; the sensitivity is genotype dependent. 63 A rapid and accurate diagnostic assay is not widely available, but the presence of four epidemiologic features of norovirus disease can be useful in confirming norovirus as a cause of outbreaks: (1) vomiting in more than half of affected persons, (2) mean incubation period of 24 to 48 hours, (3) mean duration of illness of 12 to 60 hours, and (4) absence of bacterial pathogen in stool culture. 64 The treatment for norovirus is supportive; oral rehydration solutions are used if necessary. Significant dehydration is uncommon, and the need for hospitalization is rare. A number of candidate vaccines are currently being evaluated.",

Members of this group, originally described in Berne, Switzerland, and Breda, Iowa, and named for those cities, have been seen in the feces of humans with diarrheal disease. 74 Because of the pleomorphic structure of toroviruses, electron microscopy was inadequate to prove an etiopathogenic role of these viruses in diarrheal disease. The more recent findings of torovirus-like particles by immunoassay, using validated anti-Breda virus antiserum, lends additional weight to the hypothesis that these are agents of human gastroenteritis. 75 Their causative role in human disease, however, remains unproved. Similarly, picobirnavirus is known to cause disease in animals and has been isolated from stools of humans with diarrheal illness. 76 Cytomegalovirus has been associated with enteritis and colitis.

Each serotype is referred to by its genus and serotype names (e.g., Salmonella typhimurium) rather than the formally correct S. enteritidis, serotype typhimurium. S. choleraesuis and S. typhi are known to have only one serotype each. The most common serotypes in infants are Typhimurium, Newport, Javiana, Enteritidis, and Heidelberg. 78",

As much as 30% to 40% of infant diarrhea, particularly in those less than 6 months of age, may be caused by EPEC, and in some studies EPEC infection exceeds that of rotavirus. [138] [139] [140] [141] In North America and the United Kingdom, EPEC infections were common during the 1940s through the 1960s; now they are most commonly associated with sporadic cases and nosocomial or daycare outbreaks. 142, 143 However, because of the general unavailability of serotyping, the true incidence of EPEC-associated diarrhea may be underestimated. A 1997 study in Seattle children with diarrhea, and a 2005 study in Cincinnati in which DNA probes were used to screen E. coli present in stool, found a high incidence of EPEC-like organisms (atypical EPEC) in this population. 144, 145 The hallmark of EPEC infection is the \"attaching and effacing\" lesion seen in the intestine. This lesion is characterized by destruction of microvilli and intimate adherence between the bacterium and the epithelial cell membrane. Directly beneath the surface of the adherent organism, there are marked cytoskeletal changes in the enterocyte, including accumulation of actin polymers. Often, the bacteria are raised on a pedestallike structure as a result of this actin accumulation. A number of steps are probably responsible for the development of this attaching and effacing lesion. As proposed by Donnenberg and Kaper, 146 EPEC pathogenesis consists of three phases: (1) localized adherence, which brings the bacteria in close contact with the enterocyte (e.g., docking); (2) signal transduction, including increases in intracellular calcium and protein phosphorylation; and (3) intimate adherence, a multigene process encoded in the bacterium by a locus of enterocyte effacement. 147, 148 The dramatic loss of absorptive microvilli in the intestine presumably leads to diarrhea via malabsorption. Although this is probably the predominant mechanism, some evidence suggests that a separate secretory mechanism is also involved.",

            "text": "ETEC are recognized as an important cause of diarrhea in infants in developing areas of the world. In endemic areas, children in the first few years of life may be infected several times each year. It is an important cause of diarrhea in infants and in travelers from developed to undeveloped countries, especially in regions of poor sanitation. 151 In the United States, cases of ETEC among children are uncommon. ETEC is also a major cause of traveler's diarrhea in adults. Fecal-oral transmission and consumption of heavily contaminated food or water are the most common vehicles for ETEC infection. The prevention of the spread of ETEC depends on ensuring appropriate sanitary measures: handwashing and proper preparation of food, chlorination of water supplies, and appropriate sewage treatment and disposal. 151 The production of disease by ETEC begins with colonization of the small intestine. There the bacteria depend on fimbriae (also called pili) to facilitate attachment to the mucosal surface and overcome the forward motion of peristalsis. This attachment process causes no detectable structural changes in the architecture of the brush border membrane but does allow the bacteria to release their enterotoxins, heat-labile toxin (LT) and heat-stable toxin (ST), in close proximity to the enterocyte brush border membrane where toxin receptors are present. 152 These toxins in turn stimulate adenylate cyclase (in the case of LT) or guanylate cyclase (in the case of ST), and both ultimately result in a net fluid secretion from the intestine (see the reviews by Cohen and Giannella 153 and by Sears and Kaper 154 ). Two endogenous ligands for the ST receptor, guanylin and uroguanylin, have been identified. 155, 156 This discovery is consistent with the hypothesis that ST is a superagonist and exerts its diarrheal action by means of usurping a normal secretory mechanisms in the intestine (e.g., by molecular mimicry of these less potent endogenous ligands). Uroguanylin may also act as a hormone regulating salt and water excretion in the kidney in response to an oral salt load. 157 Clinically, ETEC infection causes nausea, abdominal pain, and watery diarrhea. Stools typically contain neither mucus nor leukocytes. ETEC can be diagnosed with the use of bioassays such as the suckling mouse assay, immunoassays, or gene probes specific for either ST or LT. PCR assays are also available. However, none of these assays is commonly used in the clinical microbiology laboratory. Supportive measures are sufficient therapy for most cases of ETEC diarrhea, with oral rehydration a mainstay of therapy. Antibiotics, including trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole, have been shown to decrease the duration of fecal excretion of the organisms. Quinolone antibiotics may be more effective, 158 but they are not recommended for use in children. Rifaximin was also shown to provide protection against and treatment for travelers' diarrhea. [159] [160] [161] Cholera toxin (CT) is more than 80% homologous to LT, and vaccination with CT-B subunit (CT-B) based vaccines elicits a protective immune response against LT-producing ETEC strains. Peru-15 (an oral live attenuated candidate cholera vaccine) has been engineered to express and secrete high levels of CT-B; this candidate vaccine Peru-15pCTB has promising characteristics of an oral, single-dose, bivalent cholera/ETEC vaccine 162 and is currently undergoing Phase 1 clinical trial.",

Clinically, both Shigella and EIEC infections are characterized by a period of watery diarrhea that precedes the onset of dysentery (scanty stools containing mucus, pus, and blood). More commonly, in contrast to Shigella, only this first phase of watery diarrhea is seen in EIEC infection. This illness is clinically indistinguishable from other causes of bacterial diarrhea (e.g., ETEC) or nonbacterial infectious diarrhea. In a minority of patients with EIEC infections, the dysentery syndrome of characteristic stools, tenesmus, and fever is also seen. Bacteremia is not reported. Infection due to EIEC is uncommon, but foodborne outbreaks of disease have occurred in the United States and aboard cruise ships. Diagnosis is dependent on bioassay (the Sereny test), serotyping, ELISA, or DNA probe techniques. None of these tests is commonly available in the clinical laboratory. Treatment is currently limited to supportive measures, although ampicillin given intramuscularly has been associated with bacteriologic cure and clinical improvement.",

E. coli O157:H7 is the most common cause of infectious bloody diarrhea in the United States. 165 Similarly, HUS, which is defined as the triad of acute renal failure, thrombocytopenia, and microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, is also highly associated with antecedent E. coli O157:H7 infection.",

            "text": "Stx-producing E. coli infections may occur in sporadic cases, but they have also been associated with outbreaks of disease in nursing homes, day-care centers, and other institutions; several reviews have been published. [166] [167] [168] [169] It is estimated that E. coli O157:H7 causes approximately 10,000 to 20,000 infections per year in the United States alone and may be responsible for 250 deaths annually. 170 Inadequately cooked hamburgers were most likely the source of the first outbreak and remain the most common vehicle of transmission. In 1993 there was a large epidemic in the western United States; inadequately cooked hamburgers were again implicated as the cause. Aside from ground beef, many other food vectors have been implicated. Epidemics have been attributed to apple juice or cider, and large-scale outbreaks in Japan have been associated with bean sprouts. Contaminated water has also been a source of infection. 171, 172 Common to all of these outbreaks is a reservoir of Stx-producing E. coli in the intestines of cattle and other animals that are asymptomatic. Infection is spread either by direct contact with intestinal contents or through droppings or water runoff from contaminated pastures. A low infectious dose for Stx-producing E. coli and the resistance of these organisms to gastric acid and to the food preserving process (high salt and drying) contribute to the high attack rate. The low infectious dose also contributes to frequent person-to-person transmission. [166] [167] [168] [169] Nonfoodborne outbreaks have been associated with attending child day care, 173 drinking contaminated water, 174 and swimming in unchlorinated water. 175 Both the very old and the very young appear to be at increased risk for Stx-producing E. coli infection and its complications. [166] [167] [168] [169] Clinical features and complications of E. coli O157:H7 infection include bloody diarrhea, nonbloody diarrhea, HUS, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, and, uncommonly, asymptomatic infection. 166 Symptoms may persist for several days or, less commonly, for several weeks. Early reports suggested that carriage of the organism was brief and that prompt culture was necessary to recover these organisms. 176, 177 More recently, prolonged shedding has been observed. 173, 178 This has led to the recommendation that two negative stool cultures be obtained before a child is allowed to return to day care. 173 The identification of Stx-producing E. coli is made difficult because it is not possible to differentiate disease-producing E. coli from normal enteric flora on the basis of standard microbiologic techniques. There are currently six techniques for identification of Stx-producing E. coli: biochemical markers with serotyping (most commonly used), serum antibody tests, cytotoxin bioassays, DNA hybridization, PCR-based tests, and cytotoxin detection (including ELISAs). Some of these methods (e.g., toxin-based assays) detect the presence of cytotoxinproducing organisms, including non-O157 serotypes. It may be important to use both biochemical markers and toxinbased assays in clinical practice to identify organisms that are truly pathogenic. 179 The increased use of non-culture-based methods, such as Shiga toxin enzyme immunoassays, has resulted in a dramatic increase in reports of non-O157 Stxproducing E. coli.",

Therefore, an important aspect of treatment of Stx-associated hemorrhagic colitis is making the correct diagnosis and avoiding unnecessary diagnostic studies such as angiography and laparotomy. The mainstay of therapy for hemorrhagic colitis is the management of dehydration, electrolyte abnormalities, and gastrointestinal blood loss. Antimicrobial agents may help by killing the bacterial pathogens, but they may also cause harm by increasing the release and subsequent absorption of Stx. 180 Trials of antibiotic treatment of Stx-producing E. coli infection are inconclusive. Although these organisms are uniformly sensitive to antimicrobials in vitro, at present there is no evidence that antimicrobial therapy is helpful in diminishing the severity of illness, shortening the duration of fecal excretion, or preventing HUS. 181 Of greater concern is a study suggesting an increased incidence of HUS in those treated with antimicrobials. 182 An attempt to assimilate findings of published series on the subject via a metaanalysis failed to identify an increased risk of HUS in those treated with antimicrobials. 183 Regardless, until more data are available on this topic, most experts would agree that treatment of Stx-producing E. coli with antimicrobials is not advisable. 184 Rifaximin does not cause replication of phage or strain lysis and therefore might not increase the risk of HUS, but it has not been studied in humans with O157 infection. 185, 186 A multicenter trial failed to demonstrate an improved clinical course in pediatric patients treated with Stx-binding resin. 223 Other toxin neutralizing therapies are currently under investigation, including the use of G3 receptor analogues and monoclonal antibodies. 186, 187 ",

There was uncertainty about EAggEc pathogenicity because these organisms are found in apparently healthy individuals and because some epidemiologic studies failed to show an association with disease. 189, 190 However, evidence from volunteer studies 191, 192 and outbreaks 193 has confirmed the pathogenicity of some EAggEC strains. Studies at Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center have shown that EAggEC are an important unrecognized cause of acute infant diarrhea. 145 The mechanisms by which these organisms cause disease is thought to involve adherence to the intestinal mucosa including dispersin protein, a newly identified EAggEC virulence factor, followed by secretion of one or more enterotoxins and/or stimulation of IL-8 release by a flagellar protein. [194] [195] [196] DAEC are less well characterized but have also been associated with diarrheal disease.

            "text": "Of great interest in the study of C. difficile is the difference in the incidence of isolation of the organism and its toxin in various age groups. C. difficile toxin has been found in the feces of 10% of normal-term neonates and 55% of those in a neonatal intensive care unit. 197 Most infants found to have toxin in their stools are asymptomatic. A small group of toxin-positive infants have signs and symptoms of necrotizing enterocolitis, but no clear relation to C. difficile or its toxin has been demonstrated. The presence of C. difficile toxin in these asymptomatic infants may indicate the coexistence of some protective antitoxic substance 198 or may reflect a lack of appropriate toxin receptors in patients in this age group. 199 The incidence of C. difficile toxin positivity decreases beyond the neonatal period. The incidence of asymptomatic carriage in children older than 2 years of age approaches that in healthy adults (about 3%). Furthermore, not all of these organisms are toxin producers. Adults who develop disease from C. difficile infection are also more likely than children to experience severe colitis symptoms, although there are some reports of severe infection in infants, especially those with underlying intestinal pathology such as patients with Hirschsprung's disease or necrotizing enterocolitis. 200 Beginning in December 2002, outbreaks of an unexpectedly large number of C. difficile cases were reported in Quebec, Canada. 201 These outbreaks were characterized by a 4.5-fold increased prevalence over historical incidence rates, a 5-fold increase in mortality, and a 2.5-fold increase in the proportion of complicated cases. During the outbreaks in Canada, a new hypervirulent strain, identified as BI/NAP1/027, was found to be responsible for the increased prevalence and severity. 201 All pathogenic strains of C. difficile produce toxin A or B or both. This BI/NAP1/027 hypervirulent strain produces 16 times more toxin A and 23 times more toxin B than other strains and has now been found throughout the United States and in many parts of the world. Although rates of C. difficile infection are increasing coincidentally with this new strain, it does not appear that the increased prevalence is predominantly due to the emergence of the BI/NAP1/027 strain. Non-BI/NAP1/027 community-acquired strains appear to be more important to the overall increased disease burden. During 2005, nonhypervirulent strains caused severe disease in generally healthy persons in the community at a rate of 7.6 cases per 100,000 population without the usual risk factors of older age, exposure to health care facilities, or antimicrobial use. 202 A 5-year retrospective study revealed an increase in the number of patients seen in the emergency department with community-acquired C. difficile infection. 203 A recent prospective cohort study found C. difficile toxin in 6.7% of stool samples tested in children seen for diarrhea in a children's hospital emergency department in Seattle; this rate is may be an underestimate because in this study only toxin B positive strains were identified. 204 A similar incidence of community-acquired C. difficile associated diarrhea was found in Connecticut. 205 Pathogenesis C. difficile elaborates two important toxins responsible for the inflammation, fluid, and mucus secretion as well as damage to the intestinal mucosa. Toxin A, which is responsible for the activation and recruitment of inflammatory mediators, is a large protein (308 kDa) that binds to an enterocyte surface receptor and activates an intracellular G protein-dependent signal transduction mechanism. 206 Bound toxin results in altered permeability, inhibition of protein synthesis, and direct cytotoxicity. Toxin B demonstrates cytotoxic effects. Most strains produce both toxins, but there are some that elaborate only one or none. 207 A third \"binary toxin\" or cytodistending toxin (CDT) (actin-specific ADP-ribosyltransferase) is found in 1 to 16% of infected patients and may be associated with more severe diarrhea. Binary toxin has enterotoxic activity in vitro, but its role, if any, in the pathogenesis of C. difficile infection is not yet clear. It may act synergistically with toxins A and B in causing severe colitis. 208 The ability to form spores is thought to be a key feature in enabling the bacteria to persist in patients and the physical environment for long periods, thereby facilitating its transmission. C. difficile is transmitted through the fecal-oral route. Postulated risk factors include contact with a contaminated health care environment, contact with persons who are infected with and shedding C. difficile, and ingestion of contaminated food. 205 Some studies reveal increase risk in patients on gastric acidsuppressing medication. 207",

Stool culture requires specialized laboratory technique, and it will identify organisms that are not toxin producers, making interpreting a stool culture a challenge. Enzyme immunoassays can detect toxins A and/or B, are rapid, and are less expensive, with a turnaround time of a few hours. They have high specificity, but sensitivity is between 65 to 85% because of the high level of toxin that needs to be present. 207 Sigmoidoscopy in cases of pseudomembranous colitis typically reveals friable white exudate overlying multiple ulcerated areas. The histologic findings of such lesions are depicted in Figure 39 -4. Less commonly, pseudomembranes may not be present in the rectosigmoid but may be present in the more proximal colon.",

Children older than 2 years of age should be evaluated in the same manner as older children and adults, and infection should be considered even in the absence of prior antimicrobial exposure. 200 In cases of mild diarrheal illness caused by C. difficile, discontinuation of any antibiotics the patient is receiving may be sufficient therapy. Although vancomycin is the only U.S. FDA-approved drug for treatment of C. difficile infection, oral metronidazole remains the first-line therapy for mild infection. Compared with vancomycin, metronidazole is much less expensive and has similar efficacy, but in severe infection vancomycin is more effective. 208 In cases of severe illness and especially in cases of pseudomembranous colitis, treatment should include oral vancomycin.",

Aeromonas infection is also seasonal, occurring more often in the summer months. 216 Not all Aeromonas species are pathogenic. In a prospective control study of children with diarrhea, Aeromonas was isolated only from control subjects. 145 The method of pathogenesis remains unclear. Both cytotoxic 219 and enterotoxic 216 properties have been observed, but neither these nor other pathogenic mechanisms are found consistently in strains isolated from patients with Aeromonas-associated disease. 217 Aeromonas caviae, a commonly isolated species, demonstrates both adherence and cytotoxin production. 220 Clinical symptoms attributed to Aeromonas can be grouped into three categories: (1) acute watery diarrhea, the most common syndrome; (2) dysentery, which usually is self-limited; and (3) persistent watery diarrhea. Cramping abdominal pain and vomiting may also occur. 219 Symptoms may occasionally be severe and, especially when dysentery is present, have been incorrectly diagnosed as ulcerative colitis. 218 In mild cases of Aeromonas infection, supportive treatment should suffice. In patients who are immunocompromised, are otherwise acutely ill, or have persistent illness, treatment with antibiotics is recommended. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole is usually effective (trimethoprim, 5 mg/kg [maximum 160 mg], plus sulfamethoxazole, 25 mg/kg [maximum 800 mg] per dose, given every 12 hours for 14 days), as are tetracycline, chloramphenicol, and the aminoglycosides. 216 Most strains of Aeromonas are resistant to the penicillins, including ampicillin. 216 Plesiomonas P. shigelloides, like Aeromonas, is commonly found in the environment, 221 especially in bodies of water, including water from a home aquarium. 222 Unlike Aeromonas, however, Plesiomonas has been reported to occur in epidemics, with contaminated water often found to be the cause. 221 Plesiomonas is also known to be spread through improperly cooked seafood. 223 The pathogenesis of disease caused by P. shigelloides is not well understood. A cytotoxin has been found in some strains 221 but not in others. An invasive mechanism is also suspected, because of the colitis symptoms. 223 In addition to small-volume stools with leukocytes and possible blood, patients may also experience severe abdominal pain. Fever has been seen in approximately one third of patients. 223 In one group of adult patients, symptoms persisted longer than 2 weeks in 75% and longer than 4 weeks in 32%. 223 Diagnosis of P. shigelloides is made by stool culture. Although this illness is usually self-limited, treatment with antimicrobial agents has been shown to decrease the duration of symptoms, 223 with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole or aminoglycosides suggested as appropriate choices. There are no controlled trials of antimicrobial treatment of gastroenteritis caused by this organism.",

Enterotoxigenic Bacteroides fragilis (ETBF) organisms have been isolated from both healthy persons and those with diarrhea. 230 The only known virulence factor of ETBF is the B. fragilis toxin that stimulates secretion of the proinflammatory cytokine, IL-8. 231 Epidemiologic associations with diarrhea in children have been shown for ETBF in several studies 232-235 but not others. 236 A recent observational study in Bangladesh followed children more than 1 year of age and adults to identify individuals infected with B. fragilis. 231 A total of 1209 patients with diarrhea were screened, and 417 (34.5%) yielded B. fragilis, of which 86 (7%) were ETBF. The clinical presentation of infection included abdominal pain, tenesmus, and nocturnal diarrhea that lasted a median of 3 days and resulted in dehydration in 14% of individuals. Fecal leukocytes, lactoferrin, and proinflammatory cytokines increased in the ETBF-infected patients.",

Diarrhea is typically nonbloody and watery. Fatigue and sleepiness is frequently reported after an incubation period of 24 hours or less.
