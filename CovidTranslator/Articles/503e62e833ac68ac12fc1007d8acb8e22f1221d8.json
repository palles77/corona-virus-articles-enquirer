Two amino acids differed between the S proteins of these viruses; one was located in the signal sequence and the other was in the putative cleavage site. The amino acid at position 12 in the signal sequence was S in MHV-2 and C in MHV-2f. The amino acid sequence of the cleavage site of MHV-2 was HRARS, while that of MHV-2f was HRARR, showing one amino acid replacement at position 757. In DBT cells infected with MHV-2, the S protein was not cleaved, while the S protein of MHV-2f was cleaved. The S protein of MHV-2f expressed in a transient vaccinia virus expression system was cleaved and was fusogenic in contrast to the nonfusogenic activity of uncleaved MHV-2 S protein.",

These results showed that MHV-2 does not fuse cells due to the lack of cleavage of its S protein. This conclusion differs from studies on the activity of syncytium formation by the S proteins of fusogenic MHV-JHM and -A59 strains. Possible reasons for these differences in fusion activity are discussed. \u1b67 1997 Academic Press",

This mutation could influence the cleavage of the S protein, since a host cell-derived were deleted from the S2 subunit. The overall S genesequence homology between MHV-2 and cl-2 was proteolytic enzyme is reported to recognize the amino acid sequence RRARR in this position for JHMV and 82.23%, excluding the deleted sequence. Comparison of the nucleotide sequences of MHV-2 and -2f revealed only 2 nucleotide replacements (35, C to G and 2271, C to A). Both of these changes led to the replacement of the predicted amino acids. One was the 12th amino acid from the initiation codon which is located in the signal sequence (Fig. 3) . The amino acid at position 12 in MHV-2 was S and in MHV-2f was C. The other replacement was located in the basic amino acid cluster of the cleavage site (Fig. 3) . The amino acid at position 757 was S in MHV-2 and R in MHV-2f. To compare these two positions among various MHV strains, DNA fragments including the signal sequence region and the putative cleavage site were amplified. Sequence analysis of the PCR product showed that MHV-2 had unique amino acids at posi- of serine with arginine at position 757 appeared to influence the cleavage of the S protein. As expected, the MHV-2f S protein was cleaved, in contrast to the cleavage resistance of nonfusogenic MHV-2 S protein. The other mutation at position 12 was located in the signal sequence that is considered to be removed from the mature S protein soon after synthesis. Transportation of the S protein to the cell surface was detectable in both MHV-2-and -2f-infected cells, indicating that this mutation in the signal sequence had little effect on transporta- of the S1 subunit (24). The transmembrane region (12) and a predicted heptad repeat region of the S2 subunit (25) are also proposed to influence the fusion activity. RRAHR for A59 (23, 22) . To determine whether the S proteins of MHV-2 and -2f are cleaved, we performed These regions were identical in fusogenic MHV-2f and nonfusogenic MHV-2, and therefore are unlikely to have Western blotting analysis using cell lysates infected with MHV-2, -2f, and JHMV cl-2 (Fig. 4A) . Cell lysates collected affected the fusogenic activities of MHV-2 and -2f. In fusogenic strains JHMV and A59, cleavage of the S 18 hr p.i. were used in Western blotting, and the S protein was detected with S2-specific monoclonal antibody protein is not absolutely required, because the S proteins of these viruses with mutations in the putative cleavage (kindly provided by Dr. S.

We describe here that the S protein of MHV-2 failed to 2-infected cells. The 150-kDa protein may represent a nonglycosylated form of the mature 180-kDa protein that induce fusion due to a lack of cleavage. Perhaps the S proteins of fusogenic MHV strains induce fusion without is observed in the MHV-A59 S protein (12) . In contrast, the 150-and 90-kDa bands were detected in the lysates cleavage of the S protein. In contrast, the MHV-2 S protein required cleavage for activation of its fusion ability. of MHV-2f-and JHMV cl-2-infected cells. Most of the mature 180-kDa S protein was cleaved to S1 and S2",
