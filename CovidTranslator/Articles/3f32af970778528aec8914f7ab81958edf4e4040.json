During embryogenesis ligaments and tendons are attached to cartilage, but subsequent metaplasia of fibroblasts at their attachment site results in formation of fibrocartilage. This extends into the tendon or ligament, and endochondral ossification proceeds within the remaining cartilage. Enthesitis is inflammation of the site of tendon or ligament attachment to bone. An enthesophyte is a bony spondylopathy that develops at an enthesis ( Fig. 21.6 ). 5 Because enthesophytes, osteophytes, and ankylosing spondylopathy appear radiographically similar, confusion in terminology often occurs when referring to these structures on a radiograph. To separate osteophytes around or within joints from enthesophytes, knowing the location of the common entheses is useful information (Figs. 21.7, 21.8, and 21.9) . In complex joints such as the carpus and tarsus, a large number of intraarticular ligaments are present. Every diarthrodial joint has a joint capsule, and intraarticular and periarticular ligaments and joint capsules insert onto bone at their respective entheses. New bone formations arising in or around joints where no known entheses are present are usually referred to as osteophytes.",

Joint laxity may be palpated and visualized radiographically (Figs. 21.26 and 21.27). 28, 29 Subsequent radiographic changes are those of degenerative joint disease (Fig. 21 .28) developing as (1) perichondral osteophyte formation, (2) remodeling of the femoral head and neck, (3) remodeling of the acetabulum, and (4) increased opacity of subchondral bone of the femoral head and acetabulum. A line of enthesophytes on the caudal aspect of the femoral neck, termed the Morgan line, has been described as an early sign of coxofemoral degenerative joint disease (Fig. 21.29 ). 30 As the degenerative process advances, the femoral neck becomes thickened, and the surface of the neck becomes irregular as a result of the growth of a collar of perichondral osteophytes. The acetabulum loses its cuplike shape and becomes shallow. Increased bone opacity of subchondral articular surfaces represents bone sclerosis, which is a response to cartilage thinning. Subchondral cyst formation is an infrequent manifestation of The cranial margin of the femoral head is separated from the adjacent acetabulum by a fine radiolucent line, which represents the joint cartilage and a microfilm of synovial fluid (black arrows). The shape of the radiolucent joint space is symmetric. Many screening programs require that the extended ventrodorsal radiograph of the coxofemoral joints be made and submitted for evaluation. The method of obtaining the extended hip projection, as required by the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) for example, is similar to projections used by other screening programs internationally. With the dog in dorsal recumbency, the hind limbs are extended with the femurs parallel and the stifles rotated inward so that the patellae are located over the middle of the cranial surface of the distal femur. The x-ray beam should be centered over the coxofemoral joints, and the radiograph should include the entire pelvis and femurs. The pelvis must appear symmetric in the radiograph, without evidence of rotation (see Figs. 21.30A and 21.32). Failure to anesthetize the subject may decrease radiographic sensitivity for signs of coxofemoral joint laxity. Because the extended ventrodorsal projection is an insensitive method of detecting signs of coxofemoral subluxation, 32 care must be taken to ensure accurate subject positioning and satisfactory radiographic quality.",

This neutral position avoids spiral tensioning of the joint capsule that forces the femoral head into the acetabulum and artificially reduces subluxation, a significant disadvantage of the extended hip projection. Hind limbs are held with the femurs positioned neutrally, and a radiograph is made while the coxofemoral joints are compressed to obtain an image of Methods of evaluating the coxofemoral joints can be divided into those that identify joint laxity proactively and those that examine for radiographic evidence of degenerative joint disease. Phenotypic screening programs used internationally fall into the latter group and rely on assessment of the extended ventrodorsal radiographic projection (Fig. 21.32A ), although this projection is an insensitive indicator of coxofemoral joint laxity. To identify coxofemoral joint laxity reliably, a stressed ventrodorsal projection is used. With the femurs in a distracted position (see Fig. 21 .32B), coxofemoral laxity can be quantified and the calculated laxity index (i.e., Distraction Index) used to rank individual dogs within their breed with respect to hip joint tightness or looseness. 32 The Distraction Index (DI) is also a useful indicator of the likelihood of future coxofemoral degenerative changes. This information can be obtained at a much earlier age by using distraction radiography than with the standard extended ventrodorsal projection. Assessing coxofemoral laxity is an important component of complete radiographic assessment of the coxofemoral joints. ",

A useful technique for radiographic assessment of a sprained joint is stress radiography (Figs. 21.37 and 21.38). Stress radiography involves application of force to the joint to demonstrate displacement. The forces applied are the same stresses to which the joint would be subjected in normal daily activity and are defined as compressive, rotational, traction, shear, and wedge forces (Fig. 21.39) . 36 An example of a compressive stress is a radiograph of a joint during weight bearing. Ligamentous trauma, as in carpal hyperextension injuries, is readily detected by this technique. The cranial drawer sign seen in cranial cruciate ligament trauma is a practical example of a shearing stress. It is stress that is used routinely in clinical examination of the stifle. The same manipulative procedure may be applied to the stifle during radiography to capture the amount of cranial drawer in the image. Traction stress involves pulling the osseous components of the joint away from one another. One application of traction stress involves capital physeal fractures of the femoral head. ",

Occasionally the neoplasm initially appears relatively nonaggressive, mimicking a simple cyst, only to change later into a more extensive and destructive disease (Fig. 21.61) . Destruction of cancellous bone may be extensive and most commonly occurs on both sides of the joint. The tumor is locally invasive with a capacity to metastasize. 56 Distant metastasis, particularly to the lungs, occurs in as many as half of reported patients. 54 Many neoplasms mimic the radiographic appearance of synovial sarcomas (Fig. 21.62) . In a study of joint neoplasms, synovial sarcomas were represented in only 27% of patients. 57 Other neoplasms with a radiographic appearance similar to that of synovial sarcomas included fibrosarcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, fibromyxosarcoma, malignant fibrous histiocytoma, liposarcoma, and undifferentiated sarcoma. Primary bone tumors can occur in close proximity to a joint and can extend to involve destruction of subchondral bone (Fig. 21.63 ).",
