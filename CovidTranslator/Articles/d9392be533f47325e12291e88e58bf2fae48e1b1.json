Symptoms and severity were not different between children with HMPV only compared with HMPV co-infection. Children with HMPV subgroup A infection were more likely to require supplemental oxygen.

            "text": "Human metapneumovirus (HMPV) is a leading cause of acute respiratory tract infection, and the incidence of hospitalization is highest in young children. 1 Prevalence varies from year-to-year, and the four subgroups (A1, A2, B1, and B2) circulate unpredictably, even within similar geographic regions. [2] [3] [4] HMPV reports from the Middle East have primarily consisted of retrospective or single-year prospective studies; therefore, the true prevalence and characteristics of HMPV in Middle Eastern children are not well described. [5] [6] [7] Given the emergence of Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) virus in this region, prospective surveillance studies are important for understanding the etiology and epidemiology of viral respiratory illnesses. [8] [9] [10] No vaccines or therapeutics are currently licensed for HMPV, but recent studies have identified potential vaccine candidates and monoclonal antibodies to prevent and treat severe disease. 11, 12 Therefore, recognizing at-risk populations and markers of disease severity could help target the use of these agents. Reports of such populations have been conflicting and were conducted mostly in high-income countries. Hospitalization in HMPV-infected children has been linked to age <6 months, viral load, and household crowding. 13, 14 Female sex, prematurity, and presence of a chronic medical condition were also associated with severe disease. 14, 15 Approximately 40% of US children hospitalized with HMPV have underlying medical conditions, 1 and viral load is not consistently a predictor of severe disease. 16, 17 Whether one HMPV subgroup causes more severe disease also remains undetermined, with conflicting data. 18, 14, 19, 20, 21 Viral co-infections in children are common and may increase the likelihood of hospitalization. [22] [23] [24] The relationship between single HMPV infection and co-infection has not been well described. In a small cohort of intensive care unit (ICU) patients with HMPV, children with multiple viral pathogens did not have increased mortality. 15 Some studies reported that children with both HMPV and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) had more severe disease, 25, 26 but this relationship has not been upheld. 27 A major limitation of these studies is sample size and retrospective design. enrollment, and had to have fever and/or respiratory symptoms with one or more of the following admission diagnoses: acute respiratory illness, apnea, asthma exacerbation, bronchiolitis, bronchopneumonia, croup, cystic fibrosis exacerbation, febrile seizure, fever without localizing signs, pharyngitis, pneumonia, pneumonitis, pertussis, pertussis-like cough, respiratory distress, rule-out sepsis, or upper respiratory infection. Exclusion criteria were children \u22652 years, not enrolled within 48 hours, children with fever and neutropenia, and newborns who never left the hospital. Subjects could be included more than once during the study period for a new illness. The Institutional Review Boards of Vanderbilt University, Jordan University, and the Jordanian Ministry of Health approved the study. Written consent and clinical/demographic data were obtained from parents/guardians. Missing data and length of stay were obtained from medical records.",

Significant and near significant variables (P<0.10) from univariate analysis were used in a multivariate logistic regression model. A type I error rate of a=0.05 was used throughout, unless otherwise specified. Statistical analysis was carried out in IBM SPSS Statistics (version 22.0) and R (version 3.1.1). 35 We used a Bayesian hierarchical model to derive population prevalence estimates for each of the three years of the study. 36 Al-Bashir hospital admissions data were filtered to exclude children not residing in Amman. Estimates of the <2-year-old Jordanian population were obtained from the World Bank database and the proportion residing in Amman from the 2012 national census. 37 These values were used in a binomial model to estimate the population of children <2 years old in Amman in 2010-2012. The market share for Al-Bashir hospital was modeled as a random variable and the probability of enrollment set to 71.4% (5 of 7 days) and used in a binomial model. Prevalence was given diffuse beta (1, 5) priors for all models. Models were fitted using Markov chain Monte Carlo methods 38 in PyMC 2.3 software. 39 Models were checked for convergence using the Gelman-Rubin diagnostic 36 and for goodness-of-fit using posterior predictive checks. 40",

Previously established factors such as young age were independently associated with disease severity. However, prematurity, daycare, and smoke exposure were not associated with severe disease, and breastfeeding was not protective. Prematurity and daycare are underrepresented factors in this population, highlighting that factors contributing to severe disease differ substantially between geographic and developing regions. We did not find an association with viral load and disease severity, which corroborates some studies. 16, 17 Interestingly, viral load was significantly lower in the ICU group, the majority of whom (81%) were co-infected with RSV. Young age and RSV co-infection may have contributed to severity in the ICU subjects, since HMPV viral load was lower than non-ICU patients. Unlike other studies, female gender and past medical history were not associated with severe disease. 15 We identified a unique group of children with HMPV infection and no LRTI symptoms at admission. Approximately 25% developed an oxygen requirement during hospitalization, suggesting that upper respiratory disease may have progressed to the lower tract. These children were notably younger than the LRTI cohort. Despite the lack of LRTI symptoms on admission, 13% required ICU care and the overall median length of stay was 5 days. Fever without respiratory symptoms is a recognized clinical syndrome in young children with other respiratory viruses, particularly influenza. 47, 48 Therefore, young children with fever should be screened for HMPV infection as they may present without classic LRTI symptoms but develop severe disease. Recognition of HMPV could avoid unnecessary antibiotics in these children, and they could benefit from an antiviral or vaccine in the future.",

Thus, the epidemiology of previously established risk factors in this population are different than other cohorts where these factors are often predictors of respiratory virus severity. Previous studies have used hospitalization, clinical severity scores, and ICU mortality as markers of disease severity.

Our study highlights that the epidemiology of established risk factors are unique to specific populations. Pediatricians should be aware of local epidemiology and risk factors and recognize that young children and children with HMPV A may be at higher risk for severe disease and benefit from future development of antivirals and monoclonal antibodies.
