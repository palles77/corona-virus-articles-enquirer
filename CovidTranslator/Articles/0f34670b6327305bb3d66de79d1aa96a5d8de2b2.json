There are broadly two distinct PRRSV genotypes, the European (type I) and the North American (type II), Dovepress Dovepress 1520 Binjawadagi et al which possess a wide range of intra-and intergenotypic, genetic, and antigenic diversity. 2 Therefore, developing preventive measures to control PRRS outbreaks has been a challenge to the global swine industry.",

            "text": "Though both modified live virus (MLV) and inactivated PRRSV vaccines have been in use since 1994, control of disease outbreaks has remained unsuccessful. Live virus vaccines are successful in reducing the clinical disease, but are invariably implicated in spreading the mutated viruses to susceptible pigs. 3 In contrast, available inactivated PRRSV vaccines are safe, but they have failed to elicit protective immunity even against homologous infections. 4 In addition, killed vaccine antigens do not undergo intracellular antigen presentation pathways to induce a strong cytotoxic T-cell (CTL) response, which is necessary for clearance of intracellular pathogens like viruses. [5] [6] [7] Thus, research aimed at developing better cross-protective inactivated PRRSV vaccines is warranted. Therefore, several innovative strategies should be adopted to strengthen potency and efficacy of inactivated/killed PRRSV vaccine antigens (KAg), with respect to suitable methods of viral inactivation and purification, use of potent adjuvants, route, and efficient delivery of vaccine to protect Ags from rapid enzymatic degradation in the body.",

            "text": "Since PRRSV infects primarily the pig respiratory tract and the target cells are lung alveolar and interstitial macrophages, 8 induction of strong local mucosal immunity in the respiratory tract is important. The intranasal route of delivery of vaccines to control primary respiratory infections has shown great promise in induction of protective mucosal (ie, local) as well as systemic immunity. 5, 9, 10 Poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) is a synthetic biodegradable polymer used successfully in particulate delivery of inactivated vaccines. [11] [12] [13] The adjuvant Mycobacterium tuberculosis whole cell lysate (M. tb WCL) was shown to augment immunogenicity of both live PRRSV vaccine and PLGA-nanoparticles entrapped with killed PRRSV antigens (NP-KAg) without causing any side effects in pigs [14] [15] [16] [17] and with other vaccines in rodents, guinea pigs and rabbits. 18, 19 Unlike complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA), M. tb WCL is free from water-insoluble toxic cell wall components of the bacterium, 20, 21 and it is endotoxin free and contains only water-soluble components. 19 Therefore, unlike CFA, M. tb WCL does not cause any toxicity or granulomatous lesions at the site of inoculation. 19 Previously, we have shown that a single dose of PRRSV KAg-entrapped in PLGA (50:50) nanoparticle (NP-KAg) elicits both mucosal and systemic immune responses. 22, 23 Recently, NP-KAg coadministered intranasally twice with M. tb WCL induced cross-protective anti-PRRSV immune response in blood to a challenged heterologous PRRSV, associated with a significant reduction in viremia. 14 In this report, we made use of various types of the lung samples of that recent study 14 to evaluate viral load and local mucosal immunity both at airway surfaces and in the lung parenchyma, and also microscopic lung histopathology in vaccinated, heterologous PRRSV-challenged pigs.",

In pig Groups 3 and 5, although the ratio was close to one, the detected amount of virus-specific IgG1 and IgG2 subtypes were low ( Figure 3A-D) .",

These data were consistent with the gross lung lesions, especially in pig Groups 2 and 3; also, these pig groups had irregular fever with reduced feed intake during first week postchallenge. In contrast, the absence of any clinical PRRS disease and gross lung lesions in Group 6 pigs was associated with the absence of detectable microscopic lung pathology, and the lung architecture was comparable to mock pigs ( Figure 6I vi) . The other pig group which had moderately reduced lung lesions was Group 4 (KAg + M. tb WCL) ( Figure 6I iv), suggesting the adjuvant mediated protective immune response in pigs.

[41] [42] [43] [44] [45] Since PRRSV primarily infects the lungs of pigs, its effective control appears to be possible by induction of strong respiratory mucosal immunity. Thus, development of a novel PRRSV mucosal vaccine is warranted. Further, among the mucosal routes, intranasal delivery of NP-based vaccine elicits a higher and longer duration of IgG and IgA antibody responses compared to rectal, oral, or intramuscular routes. 46 In the lungs, PRRSV infects both alveolar and interstitial macrophages, 47 and greater than 90% of BAL cells are macrophages. 48 We investigated anti-PRRSV response both in BAL cells and LMNCs. CD11c + APCs are richly present in the lungs in both BAL cells and LMNCs, but they differ in their antigen presentation potential. APCs present in the lung mucosal surfaces (represented by BAL cells) activate only antigen-primed T-cells, while APCs in the lung parenchyma (represented by LMNCs) activate both na\u00efve and antigen-primed T-cells. 49 Therefore, our study comprehensively investigated overall immune responses and viral load in the lungs of pigs vaccinated and challenged through the intranasal route.",

            "text": "Inactivated vaccines are safe, but suitable adjuvant and delivery system are critical to boost their efficacy. Several unsuccessful attempts were made to develop protective killed PRRSV vaccines. 29, 52 A recent study using UV-or BEI-inactivated PRRSV (1 \u00d7 10 8 TCID 50 per dose) coadministered with either Freund's incomplete or Suvaxyn oil/water adjuvant elicited the VN titer of greater than 16 associated with partial clearance of homologous viral challenge. 53 In that study, CMI response was not investigated. PLGA is the food and drug administration (FDA)-approved agent, and PLGA-based intranasal delivery of PRRSV vaccine was found safe in pigs. 14, 22, 23 One of the strategies to augment uptake of particulate antigens by APCs is by increasing its surface hydrophilic nature of the particles by coating with a nonionic surfactant, Polaxamer 188. 54, 55 Efficient Th1-immunity-inducing adjuvants are critical to promote a strong CMI response to subunit and inactivated virus vaccines. 56 The water-soluble components of M. tb WCL, such as heat shock protein-70 57 and Pro-Glu/PPE, 58 are potent adjuvants. In addition, four other water-soluble components in M. tb WCL, such as short-and long-chain poly-peptidoglycans, acetylated peptidoglycans, and tetrasaccharide-heptapeptide, have potent adjuvant effects comparable to CFA in inducing production of antibodies in rabbits coadministered with an inactivated influenza virus vaccine. 19 PLGA-NP vaccine coadministered with a potent adjuvant elicits a protective immune response. 59 We demonstrated potent adjuvant effects of M. tb WCL to PRRS-MLV, [15] [16] [17] 60, 62 and also to NP-KAg, with no side effects. 14 Our initial studies using a single dose of NP-KAg elicited partial cross-protective immune response in pigs. 22, 23 To potentiate the efficacy of NP-KAg vaccine, in a recent study NP-KAg was evaluated by coadministering intranasally twice with either entrapped or unentrapped M. tb WCL. Our results suggested that combination of NP-KAg with unentrapped M. tb WCL significantly cleared the challenged heterologous virus from the circulation, supported with strong humoral and CMI responses in the blood. The enhanced T-and B-cell responses in adjuvanted NP-KAg-vaccinated pigs were attributed to concerted effects of both PLGA and M. tb WCL. 14 Induction of strong local mucosal immunity and clearance of heterologous PRRSV from vaccinated pig lungs is important for effective control of PRRS. Therefore, in this study we investigated the immune responses exclusively both at mucosal surfaces and parenchyma of pig lungs. Our results indicated that adjuvanted NP-KAg (Group 6 pigs) did potentiate anti-PRRSV immune response in the lungs, as indicated by the following parameters: 1) increased PRRSV-specific IgG and IgA response with enhanced antibody avidity and VN titers, and balanced Th1 and Th2 immune responses; 2) upregulated secretion of Th1 (IL-12 and IFN-\u03b3) and downregulated immunosuppressive (TGF-\u03b2 and IL-10) cytokines; 3) enhanced frequency of ISCs and IFN-\u03b3 producing CD4 + , CD8 + , CD4 + CD8 + T cells, \u03b3\u03b4 + T cells, and NK cells, and expanded frequency of APCs; and most importantly, 4) complete clearance of detectable replicating challenged heterologous PRRSV and tenfold reduction in viral RNA load in the lungs. Further, the microscopic lung lesions ( Figure 6I ) strongly supported the observed virus clearance and immunological responses.",

Like in PBMCs, increased but comparable frequency of other IFN-\u03b3 + lymphocyte subsets in both restimulated and unstimulated cells was observed in LMNCs of Group 6 pigs, suggesting that other T-effector and NK cells were actively secreting IFN-\u03b3 in the lungs to PRRSV-challenge infection.

In the lung homogenates of low-dose (but not high-dose) adjuvanted NP-KAg-vaccinated pigs, high avidity IgA response was observed; the reason for this discrepancy could be the time of lung sample collection. Overall, our results suggested that virus-specific functional IgA response at mucosal tissues (lungs) was enhanced in adjuvanted NP-KAg-vaccinated pigs. Further, our results indicated that in the lung mucosal surfaces, IgA isotype appears to play an important role, while in the lung parenchyma both IgA and IgG isotypes contribute to protective immune response. VN antibodies against putative neutralizing epitopes on PRRSV GP5 and M glycoproteins play an important role in PRRSV clearance. 65 In Group 6 pigs, high levels of cross-reactive VN titers were detected against a challenged PRRSV MN184 strain, another heterologous type II viral strain, and most importantly-even against a highly variant heterogenotypic strain (PRRSV SD03-15), confirming the broadly cross-protective nature of adjuvanted NP-KAg vaccine formulation. Further, PRRSV antibody avidity results were positively correlated with VN titers, in agreement with a previous report. 31 Typically, killed vaccines elicit a predominantly Th2 response, but NP-based vaccines drive either a balanced or Th1-biased response, 46 required for efficient clearance of virus. 66 In Group 6 pigs, enhanced and balanced Th1-Th2 humoral and CMI responses were detected. A robust CMI response is essential for complete protection against PRRSV. 17 A crucial Th1 cytokine, IFN-\u03b3, is produced by NK cells, \u03b3\u03b4 T cells, CD4 + and CD8 + T cells, and CD4 + CD8 + T cells. Enhanced secretion of IFN-\u03b3 and the presence of increased frequencies of IFN-\u03b3 + memory CD4 + and CD8 + cells in the lungs of adjuvanted NP-KAg-vaccinated pigs have confirmed the additive effect of PLGA-mediated delivery and adjuvanticity of M. tb WCL. A possible mechanism of improved CMI response in Group 6 pigs was mediated by cross-presentation of PLGA-entrapped Ags to CD8 + T cells through MHC class I molecules, of dendritic cells and macrophages. 67 Thus, our results were consistent with the previous reports on PLGA NP-based vaccines, which elicited strong effector and memory CMI responses. 68, 69 In addition, increased levels of another important Th1 cytokine, IL-12, 70 was detected in the lungs of adjuvanted NP-KAg-vaccinated pigs, associated with reduced production of immunosuppressive cytokines, IL-10 and TGF-\u03b2, which play a vital role in PRRSV pathogenesis. 17 The \u03b3\u03b4 T cells are present in high frequency in pigs and are involved in both innate and adaptive immunity at mucosal tissues. 71 Enhanced frequency of activated \u03b3\u03b4 T cells in the lungs of Group 6 pigs was observed. Significantly reduced production of IL-6 in Group 6 pigs indicated the absence of inflammatory response in the lungs of Group 6 pigs.",

PLGA-entrapped Hepatitis B subunit vaccine coadministered with an encapsulated adjuvant failed to induce strong antibody response, 72 consistent with our results observed in Group 5 pigs (NP-KAg + NP-WCL). Further, pigs vaccinated with both adjuvant and KAg unentrapped formulation (Group 4) exhibited Th2-biased and weak IFN-\u03b3 response, associated with partial clearance of replicating PRRSV. The presence of 5-10 fold fewer PRRSV RNA copies in the lungs of adjuvanted NP-KAg-vaccinated pigs and the absence of detectable replicating challenged virus is consistent with a previous report, wherein qPCR failed to differentiate infectious and noninfectious virus, and inactivated PRRSV is relatively stable in the environment. 73 Further, in samples with low levels of PRRSV RNA copies, cell culture method has failed to detect the replicating virus. 74 PLGA-based vaccine delivery is shown to dramatically reduce the required vaccine dose by up to 63 times. 69 PLGA-NP-based vaccine delivery is getting global recognition for effective delivery of subunit/inactivated mucosal vaccines, because their size, contents, and cell targeting properties can be engineered. 59 Our study has demonstrated that PLGA-based adjuvanted NP-KAg vaccine induced strong anti-PRRSV immunity both systemically 14 and locally at the lungs.
