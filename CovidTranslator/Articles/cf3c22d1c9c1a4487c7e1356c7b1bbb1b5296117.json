Methods: This study identified SARS-CoV ORF6-interacting proteins using the phage displayed human lung cDNA libraries, and examined the association of ORF6ehost factor interaction with Type I IFN antagonism. After the fifth round of biopanning with Escherichia coli-synthesized ORF6-His tagged protein, the relative binding affinity of phage clones to ORF6 was determined using direct enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Results: The highest affinity clone to ORF6 displayed the C-terminal domain of NPIPB3 (nuclear pore complex interacting protein family, member B3; also named as phosphatidylinositol-3kinase-related kinase SMG-1 isoform 1 homolog). The coimmunoprecipitation assay demonstrated the direct binding of ORF6 to the C-terminal domain of NPIPB3 in vitro. Confocal Journal of Microbiology, Immunology and Infection (2017) 50, 277e285 imaging revealed a close colocalization of SARS-CoV ORF6 protein with NPIPB3 in human promonocytes. The dual luciferase reporter assay showed that the C-terminal domain of NPIPB3 attenuated the antagonistic activity of SARS-CoV ORF6 on IFN-b-induced ISRE (IFN stimulated response element)-responsive firefly luciferase activity. In addition, confocal imaging and Western blotting assays revealed that the increases in STAT-1 nuclear translocation and phosphorylation occurred in the transfected cells expressing both genes of ORF6 and NPIPB3, but not in the ORF6-expressing cells in response to IFN-b. Conclusion: The overexpression of NPIPB3 restored the IFN-b responses in SARS-CoV ORF6 expressing cells, indicating that the interaction of SARS CoV ORF6 and NPIPB3 reduced Type I IFN antagonism by SARS-CoV ORF6.",

            "text": "The pandemic outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) arose from Guangdong Province of China in November 2002, and eventually infected > 8500 people worldwide. 1, 2 The Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), which emerged from the Arabian Peninsula in 2012, was globally identified in 941 laboratory-confirmed cases with 347 related deaths until December 26, 2014, according to the World Health Organization (http://www.who.int/csr/don/ 26-december-2014-mers/en/). The CoV genome is a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA of w30 kb; it contains 14 potential open reading frames (ORFs) and encodes replicase (ORF1a and ORF1ab), structural proteins (spike, nucleocapsid, membrane, and envelope), and accessory proteins (ORF 3a, ORF 3b, ORF6, ORF 7a, ORF 7b, ORF 8a, ORF 8b, and ORF 9b). 3 These accessory proteins could be dispensable for virus replication, but might have a specific function in viral infection. ORF3 and ORF 7a proteins activate JNK (c-Jun N-terminal kinase) and NF-kB (nuclear factor kappa B) signaling, upregulate interleukin-8 and RANTES (regulated on activation, normal T expressed and secreted), and modulate apoptosis and cell cycle. 4, 5 ORF 3b and ORF6 proteins modulate the host innate immune response, including inhibition of Type I IFN production and signaling. 4, 5 The SARS-CoV ORF6 protein localizes in the membrane of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi apparatus in infected cells 6 ; ORF6 overexpression triggers the ER stress in transfected cells. 7 The ORF6 protein is dispensable for viral replication in vitro and in vivo, 8 but associates with viral escape from the innate immune system, particularly inhibition of Type I interferon (IFN) production and signaling pathways. 7, 9 ORF6 protein interacts with the C terminus of karyopherin alpha 2, leading to impeding the nuclear import of phosphorylated signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) in response to IFN-b. Thus, SARS-CoV ORF6 protein is an antagonist of Type I IFNs. In this study, we identified cellular ORF6-interacting factors using phage display human lung cDNA library, further examining the association of SARS-CoV ORF6 and host factors in Type I IFN antagonism. The C terminus of nuclear pore complex interacting protein NPIPB3 (nuclear pore complex interacting protein family, member B3; Gene ID: 23117), also known as phosphatidylinositol (PI)-3-kinase-related kinase SMG-1 isoform 1 homolog, displayed on phage surface showed the highest binding affinity to recombinant ORF6 protein. The interaction of ORF6 and NPIPB3 was analyzed using coimmunoprecipitation in vitro and colocalization in cells. The effect of NPIPB3 overexpression on Type I IFN antagonism of ORF6 was determined using dual-luciferase reporter assay system, and STAT1 phosphorylation and nuclear translocation.",

For the production of E. coli-synthesized ORF6 protein, pTriEx-ORF6 was transformed into E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells.

The recombinant ORF6 protein was used for the selection of its interacting cellular factors with phage-displayed human lung cDNA library. After the fifth round of biopanning, ORF6-specific binding phage clones eluted were selected from single phage plaques, amplified in E. coli for determining relative ORF6-binding affinities. Each phage clone was performed by direct binding enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay inORF6coated wells (Figure 2 ).

CCNL1 displayed on phage clone number 16, containing an arginine-and serine-rich domain and a cyclin domain was required for spliceosome assembly and regulated splicing. 17 ribonucleoproteins, suggested as a germ cell-specific splicing regulator. 19 ORF6-interacting phage clone number 40 displayed the C-terminal domain of NPIPB3 (Figures 2  and 3 ). NPIPB3 had many alternative names such as nuclear pore complex-interacting protein-like 3, protein pps22-1, KIAA0220-like protein, nuclear pore complexinteracting protein B type, and PI-3-kinase-related kinase SMG-1 isoform 1 homolog. 20 NPIPB3 containing a transmembrane region at the N terminus was recognized as a membrane protein and served as an RNA splicing factor. NPIPB3 was upregulated in epithelial Caco-2 cells after exposure to probiotic Lactobacillus acidophilus L-92, linking with immune response, DNA binding, and protein synthesis. 21 NPIPB3 was also identified to bind IFN-a promoter. 22 In this study, overexpression of NPIPB3 C-terminal domain reduced the antagonistic activity of Type I IFN by SARS-CoV ORF6 protein (Figures 6e8) . The diacidic cluster motif (residues 53e56) was found in the ORF6 protein, as the critical determinant of subcellular localization to vesicular structures. 23 Interestingly, the C-terminal domain of NPIPB3 had several four positively charged residue (KRRR) repeats. Therefore, ionic interactions could be linked with the binding interaction between SARS-CoV ORF6 and NPIPB3 C-terminal domain. In addition, the interaction between SARS-CoV ORF6 and NPIPB3 C-terminal domain might influence the binding interaction between ORF6 and karyopherin alpha 2; thus, the C-terminal domain of NPIPB3 recovered the nuclear import carrier function of karyopherin alpha 2 in ORF6-expressing cells, correlating with STAT1 nuclear translocation after IFN-b treatment (Figure 7 ). In addition, overexpression of the NPIPB3 Cterminal domain reduced IFN-b-induced phosphorylation of STAT1 at Tyr701 (Figure 8, lane 2) . Tyrosine-protein kinase JAK1 (Janus kinase 1) contained a putative phosphoinositide binding site; an interaction between JAK1 and PI-3kinase was reported in interleukin-2 signaling pathway. 24 Meanwhile, NPIPB3, also known as PI-3-kinase-related kinase SMG-1, showed functional and structural similarities to PI-3-kinase. 25 Therefore, NPIPB3 overexpression might increase the interaction with JAK1, which influenced IFN-binduced JAK/STAT signaling, resulting in the decrease of STAT1 phosphorylation at Tyr701.",

The IFN-b treatment stimulated STAT1 nuclear translocation in vector control cells [Figures 7B(1)e(3)], but not in ORF6-expressing cells [Figure 7B(7)e(9)]. However, NPIPB3 C terminus overexpression significantly enhanced IFN-b-induced STAT1 nuclear translocation in ORF6-expressing cells [Figure 7B(10)e(12)]. In addition, Western blotting indicated NPIPB3 C terminus overexpression enhancing IFN-binduced STAT1 phosphorylation at Tyr701 inORF6expressing cells(Figure 8).
