The model is Markovian of the SIR type in which the total population is constant and individuals meet a random number of other individuals at each time step. Individuals remain infectious for R time units, after which they become removed or immune. Individual transition probabilities from susceptible to diseased states are given in terms of the binomial distribution. An expression is given for the probability that any individuals beyond those initially infected become diseased. In the model with a finite recovery time R, simulations reveal large variability in both the total number of infected individuals and in the total duration of the epidemic, even when the variability in number of contacts per day is small. In the case of no recovery, R = 1, a formal diffusion approximation is obtained for the number infected. The mean for the diffusion process can be approximated by a logistic which is more accurate for larger contact rates or faster developing epidemics. For finite R we then proceed mainly by simulation and investigate in the mean the effects of varying the parameters p (the probability of transmission), R, and the number of contacts per day per individual. A scale invariant property is noted for the size of an outbreak in relation to the total population size. Most notable are the existence of maxima in the duration of an epidemic as a function of R and the extremely large differences in the sizes of outbreaks which can occur for small changes in R. These findings have practical applications in controlling the size and duration of epidemics and hence reducing their human and economic costs.",

New diseases, such as ebola, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), avian or bird 'flu', and West Nile virus emerge, and historically significant diseases, such as diptheria and polio, re-emerge. Smallpox, considered to have been driven to extinction many years ago, has reemerged as a threat due to the possibility of bioterrorists procuring laboratory samples of the bacterium (see [1] , for a quantitative analysis). Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is currently threatening to cause more deaths than the great outbreaks of plague in the 14th century (of the order of 25 million deaths or one in four Europeans at the time) and influenza, which caused about 20 million deaths in the early 20th century [2] . Furthermore, epidemics in agricultural animals may have catastrophic economic consequences such as in the recent outbreaks of foot and mouth disease in Britain.",

However, it seems apparent that the nature of epidemic growth and spread is for the most part stochastic.

In these models there are successive generations, indexed by t = 0, 1, 2, . . ., of infectives which are only capable of infecting susceptibles for one generation after which they do not participate in the epidemic process. Suppose the population size is n, a constant and let the numbers of susceptibles and (new) infectives of generation t be X(t) and Y(t), respectively. Then the initial condition is X(0) + Y(0) = n and X(t + 1) + Y(t + 1) = X(t), t = 0, 1, 2, . . ., as the infectives and susceptibles of generation t + 1 are drawn from the susceptibles of generation t.

Despite its apparent simplicity, the Reed-Frost model is not readily analyzed for large n, so that approximations have been sought, such as branching processes in the early stages and a normal approximation for estimating the final size of the epidemic; i.e., the total number infected [16] . However, Ball and O'Neill [19] have succeeded, via a construction of the epidemic process due to Sellke [20] , to find the distribution of the final size of an epidemic in the Reed-Frost and other models -see also [21] .

One of these concerns the group of individuals encountered by a given individual on a particular day. The most realistic situation would make this group consist of a core subgroup which was met almost on a daily basis, such as family members or colleagues, together with a random subgroup whose numbers and composition would change each day, consisting of persons met in travelling or other activities, such as sporting events, shopping or entertainment. Some interesting results have recently been found for models with some such features [17, 23] but here it was decided to simplify the model by making the group met by each individual not necessarily the same each day, consisting of a fixed number plus a random number, all being chosen at random from the rest of the population. The second feature consists of a period of R days after the infection of an individual such that only during this period is the individual infected and capable of infecting susceptible individuals. We will mainly be concerned with ascertaining the total number of diseased individuals and how long it takes for the disease to vanish from the population (if ever). The case R = 1 is considerably simpler, so we give some analytical formulas for this case and consider a formal diffusion approximation for the number infected as a random function of time.",

The total number of individuals met by person i over (t, t + 1] is thus N i (t) = n i + M i (t). An alternative way to view this is that individual i never has less than n i contacts. We here consider time homogeneous models so that the distribution of M i (t) is the same for all t.

In Figs 1 shows the empirical (simulated) distribution (histogram) of the total number of infected individuals at the end of the epidemic. The number of trials for the upper histogram is 500, whereas for the lower histogram it is 5000. We report empirical statistics for the latter case. The maximum number of cases was 64 and the minimum number was 2 (for the latter, there were no new infections beyond the initially infected individuals). The mean number of total cases was 8.39, the standard deviation was 8.44 and the most frequent occurrence was that of no new cases (size 2). The most notable feature is that the same parameter set can lead to either zero or very few new cases or to a large outbreak in which nearly one third of the population becomes infected. This important effect could of course not be discerned with a deterministic model. Fig. 2 shows the corresponding sets of results (500 and 5000 trials) for the duration of the epidemic, defined as the time required to reach an epoch in which there are no current infectives. The empirical statistics, based on 5000 trials, are as follows. The minimum duration was 2 days (recovery of the initially infected and no new cases) and the maximum duration was 33 days with a mean of 6.52 days and a standard deviation of 4.64 days. The most likely occurrence was a duration of 2 days (no new cases).

When susceptibles are potentially exposed to infectives for 3 or 4 days, the entire population is infected whenever p > 0.2 and there is over 50% penetration for p as small as 0.05. An aspect of special interest is the change in the mean final number of cases when R changes. For example, when p = 0.1, for a recovery period of R = 2, the mean final number infected is nearly 400. In contrast, when R = 1, the mean final number infected is less than 50, so there are eight times as many cases, on average, when the recovery period is 2 days as for a recovery period of 1 day. This observation is of great interest in reducing the burden of an epidemic, which is measured not only in human suffering and inconvenience, but also economic cost. The mean number of cases can be reduced not only by reducing the transmission probability p but also, and quite dramatically, by reducing R. In practice this reduction in R could be effected by either making sure that diseased individuals are prevented from circulating in the population as soon as possible after they become infective, or possibly by the use of medication or treatment which accelerates recovery.",

By contrast, at intermediate values of p, as R increases there is a rapid increase of mean epidemic size. Hence at such values of p, reducing the infectious period can have an extremely beneficial effect on the containment of the spread of the disease.",

By analytical and simulation methods we considered how the parameters of the model affected the time course of the spread of the disease and the final outcome in terms of total cases and total duration. Apart from the initial condition there are four variable elements: n, the total population size; p, the probability of transmission from diseased to susceptible; R, the number of days an individual remains infective; and the set of N i , i = 1.2, . . . ,n, where N i is the random number of contacts per day made by individual i; N i may have fixed and random components. A degree of scale invariance was noted in the sense that the fraction of the population ultimately infected depended on the fraction initially infected rather than the absolute size of the population. This possibly can be interpreted by considering that each initially infected individual more or less starts his own epidemic independently of other initially infected individuals. An approximate expression was easily obtained for the probability of any or zero new cases after t = 0. We found that there was considerable variability of response as a small number of initially infected individuals have the capacity to give rise to either very small outbreaks or, for the parameters considered, with small probability, very large outbreaks, as seen in Fig. 1 . The corresponding durations also exhibited great variability. For the case R = 1 a formal diffusion approximation was obtained for the number of cases as a function of time, which also leads to a useful approximate logistic equation for the mean number of cases.",

Most noteworthy were the maxima in the mean duration that occur as the contact rate and the probability of transmission increase, and the drastic reductions in the size of the outbreak as the recovery period is reduced for certain, but not all, ranges of the other parameters. These findings may have practical applications as they shed light on some of the factors controlling the size and duration of epidemics and hence their human and economic costs. More simulations will be required to do a thorough investigation of the factors involved. In addition, asymptotic analysis may be useful for large n as well as a comparison of results from the present model with those for differential equation models and the original Reed-Frost model. These aspects will be the subjects of future articles.",

The number of trials for the upper histogram is 500, whereas for the lower histogram it is 5000. We report empirical statistics for the latter case. The maximum number of cases was 64 and the minimum number was 2 (for the latter, there were no new infections beyond the initially infected individuals). The mean number of total cases was 8.39, the standard deviation was 8.44 and the most frequent occurrence was that of no new cases (size 2). The most notable feature is that the same parameter set can lead to either zero or very few new cases or to a large outbreak in which nearly one third of the population becomes infected. This important effect could of course not be discerned with a deterministic model. Fig. 2 shows the corresponding sets of results (500 and 5000 trials) for the duration of the epidemic, defined as the time required to reach an epoch in which there are no current infectives. The empirical statistics, based on 5000 trials, are as follows. The minimum duration was 2 days (recovery of the initially infected and no new cases) and the maximum duration was 33 days with a mean of 6.52 days and a standard deviation of 4.64 days. The most likely occurrence was a duration of 2 days (no new cases). The variability in the duration is as striking as for the size of the epidemic, especially considering that there is no variability in the number of daily contacts. In the results shown in Figs. 1 and 2 we have employed samples of 500 and of 5000. The larger sample size is included in order to give a better indication of the underlying distributions, which could be obtained within a theoretical framework. If we consider the process {(X(t), Y 0 (t), Y 1 (t)), t = 0, 1, 2, . . .} with initial value (n \u00c0 1, 1, 0) and state space f\u00f0x; y 0 ; y 1 \u00de 2 Z 3 \u00fe : x\u00fe y 0 \u00fe y 1 6 ng, then the duration is the time T to absorption of the process on the x-axis, with Y 0 (T) = Y 1 (T) = 0, and the total number infected is n \u00c0 X(T). Although an analytical approach via Markov chain theory is potentially feasible to find the distributions of T and X(T), the formulas are so unwieldy that we restrict our attention to estimation by simulation.",
