In this study, the relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU) values, effective number of codon (ENC) values and nucleotide content were investigated, and a comparative analysis of codon usage patterns for open reading frames (ORFs) of 22 BVDV genomes, including 14 of genotype 1 and 8 of genotype 2, was carried out. A high A?U content and low codon bias were found in BVDV genomes. Depending on the RSCU data, it was found that there was a significant variation in bias of codon usage between the two genotypes, and a geographic factor exists only in genotype-1 of BVDV. The RSCU data have a negative correlation with general average hydrophobicity (GRAVY), aromaticity and nucleotide content. Furthermore, the overall abundance of C and U has no effect on the synonymous codon usage patterns. In contrast, the A and G content showed a significant correlation with the nucleotide content at the third position. In addition, the codon usage patterns of BVDV are similar to those of 22 conserved genes of Bos taurus. Taken together, the genetic characteristics of BVDV possibly result from interactions between natural seclection and mutation pressure.",

The patterns indicate that the least frequently used codons in the host were also the nonpreferred codons of the viruses, such as UCG (Ser), CCG (Pro), ACG (Thr), CGU, CGC, CGA, CGG (Arg) and GCG (Ala), and some highly scattered codons including CUA (Leu), AGG (Arg), AUA and AUU (Ile).

Mutation pressure is the change in some gene frequencies due to the repeated occurrence of the same mutations. There are not many biologically realistic situations where mutation pressure is the most important evolutionary process. However, for RNA viruses, the mutation rate is sometimes high enough that mutation pressure needs to be considered. It is well established that synonymous codon usage reveals genetic information about some viral genomes [10, 14] . In this study, the evidence suggests that the synonymous codon usage bias in BVDV genes is low (mean ENC = 51.43, greater than 40). Therefore, together with published data on codon usage bias of some RNA viruses, such as influenza A H5N1 virus and SARS coronovirus, with mean values of 50.91 and 48.99, respectively [10, 33] , the low frequency of codon usage bias for RNA viruses is similar to some degree. Bahir et al. also reported that there is a strong resemblance in codon usage between viruses and their host cells [2] . This suggests that the characteristics of low codon bias may assist BVDV to replicate efficiently in the host cells.",

This is supported by the highly significant correlation between codon usage indices (f 0 1 ) and A%, U%, G%, C%, A 3 %, U 3 %, G 3 % and C 3 % values ( Table 6 ). The relationship between authentic ENC values and (G?C) 3 % is weaker than that of the expected values (Fig. 2) . We suggest that mutation pressure is one of the main factors responsible for the variation of synonymous codon usage in genomes of BVDV. Further analysis showed that these C 3 % values of BVDV isolates were low, with an average Table 5 Correlation analysis between the A, U, C, G content and the A 3 , U 3 , C 3 , G 3 content in all ORFs (Table 3) . Meanwhile, the U 3 % value is higher than the C 3 % value (mean U 3 %: mean C 3 % = 19.97:17.47), but only one U-ended codon, AGU, is used as a preferentially used codon. This indicates that natural selection is possibly involved in the patterns of synonymous codon usage. No correlation was found between C%, or U% and A 3 %, U 3 %, G 3 %, or C 3 % ( Table 5 ), suggesting that nucleotide constraints are involved in codon usage patterns due to low U% and C% values. Aromaticity is one of the factors in variations in amino acid usage [19] . The f 0 1 values had a negative correlation with the aromaticity of each protein (Table 5 ).
