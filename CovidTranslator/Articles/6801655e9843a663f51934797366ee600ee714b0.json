ESBL detection should be routinely performed in clinical laboratory as false reporting would results in treatment failure despite in vitro sensitivity.",

            "text": "Background: Biofilm formation represents one of the major health problems due to its difficulty to be eradicated. Most studies focus on seeking for new antibiotics to treat biofilms but very little focus on the bacterial virulence factors' genes related to biofilm formation. Aim(s)/Objective(s): In our work we are trying to find the relationship between biofilm formation and Quorum Sensing (QS) virulence factors' genes. This might give new insights for using new therapeutic alternatives other than the traditional antibiotic. Method(s) : In this work, the amount of biofilm formation of the antibiotic resistant strains of Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae at different time points of growth (6, 12, 24 and 48 hours) was determined using Biofilm Formation Assay (Tissue Culture Plate Assay; TCP). Six wells and 96 wells tissue culture plates were used in this study using LB broth and nutrient broth, and in static and shaking incubation conditions. Results: Results showed that amount of biofilm produced varies according to the bacterial growth stage at 6, 12, 24 and 48 hours of growth and culture conditions (static or shaking) in addition to the type of the growth media. Discussion and/or Conclusion(s): In conclusion, quantity of biofilm produced is affected by the strain type, growth stage and culture conditions. Using these result, next step will be the selection of the highest biofilm producer strains for deletion of one of the QS controlled virulence gene and study this effect on strain's biofilm formation ability.",

The correlation of isolates from aspirates and swabs was 60%. Two aspirates did not yield significant growth but yielded heavy and moderate growth from wound swabs. In one wound swab additional organism (Pseudomonas sp) was isolated from the same wound and one wound swab yielded scanty coliform growth but nil growth from aspirate. In two closed, inflamed cellulitic area with nil growth from aspirate wound swab was not taken. Discussion and/or Conclusion(s): The FNA microbiopsy technique in this study used only a small amount of tissue for sampling, which was not painful for patients. It was possible to obtain aspirate from closed cellulitic tissue where simple swab was not possible. The aspirate results yielded less pathogens and fewer organisms compared to wound swabs reflecting more accurately the state of the wound infection and response to antimicrobial treatment.",

            "text": "Trends and variations in antimicrobial susceptibility testing between laboratories in North West England: implications for interpretation of surveillance data Background: While the problem of antibiotic resistance is well understood within the infection prevention community, there remains some confusion about a potential risk of resistance against disinfectants and antiseptics (biocidal substances). Aim(s)/Objective(s): Assess available literature and knowledge on application of biocidal substances to identify the risk of relevant microbial resistance to these substances and the potential risk of promoting antibiotic resistance. Method(s) : Review and evaluation of available literature. Results: Whereas antibiotic resistance can be defined as an increased minimum inhibitory concentration, resistance to biocidal substances must be defined as failing defined log reduction according to accepted standards as outlined in EN 14885 at concentrations and contact times, which deliver kill of standard test organisms. Also, genetically determined resistance must be distinguished from phenotypic adaptation, which is found e.g. in biofilms. Using these definitions, the development of relevant resistance to biocidal substances has not been observed in more than 50 years of routine use. Notably, antibiotic resistance was found even before broad clinical use of these substances. Given the broad and unspecific mode of action of biocides, it is unlikely that this will happen. Correct use of biocidal substances like avoiding sublethal exposure of microbes under conditions supporting microbial growth and selection further reduce this risk. It was also demonstrated that correct use of biocidal substances does not promote antibiotic resistance. Discussion and/or Conclusion(s): It is concluded that correct use of biocidal substances may provide opportunities to reduce the risk of spread of antibiotic resistance. between hospitals including patient mix. This may bias the results preventing effective benchmarking of antimicrobial prescribing quality indicators. Aim(s)/Objective(s): To develop and implement a standardised audit methodology using the same patient mix and speciality of staff examining antimicrobial stewardship indicators across a region. To achieve 90% in agreed audit standards. Method(s) : Quality indicators, audit standards, data collection criteria and patient specialties applicable to all hospitals in the region were agreed. Trust antimicrobial pharmacists collected and analysed data on 100 patient cases from agreed specialities between November and December 2015. Results: Ranges and means are reported. Standard1: Antimicrobial choice reasonable: (range 67-97%) mean 85% Standard 2: Indication documented: (range 33-97%) mean 79% Standard 3: Stop/review date documented: (range 20-95%) mean 64% Standard 4: 72 hour prescribing decision: (range 50-94%) mean 73% Standard 5: Pharmacist screen: (range 57-86%) mean 72% Standard 6: Not reasonable but screened: (range 4-36%) mean 17% Standard 7: Consultant review; (range 73.5-100%) mean 86%. Discussion and/or Conclusion(s): This audit allowed a consistent approach to data collection; patient mix and data interpretation were comparable. There was no indicator where the region achieved 90% and there was a wide variation in many indicators. This data is useful to highlight outlying and achieving Trusts encouraging best practice sharing across the region. This audit will be repeated annually, allowing effective comparisons to be drawn. Method(s) : 15 blood isolates of LRCoNS were characterized for mechanism of LR. Species identification was done by sequencing of 16S rRNA gene. Demographic data, clinical and antibiotic history and co-morbid conditions were recorded through chart review. Linezolid and glycopeptides MIC was determined by microbroth dilution and Etest respectively. PCR was performed for cfr gene and domain V region of the 23S rRNA. Mutations were detected by sequencing of five copies of 23S rRNA gene. Results: LR was observed in diverse species of CoNS (9 S. haemolyticus, 3 S. cohnii and 3 S. arlettae). All LRCoNS were noscomially acquired. All patients had co-morbidities without prior exposure to linezolid, clindamycin or chloramphenicol. Mean age was 30 years (8 month -80 year). All isolates were susceptible to vancomycin and 10 were teicoplanin resistant. Linezolid MIC ranged from 8-32 \u03bcg/mL and cfr gene was detected in all isolates. Novel mutations were detected; G2614T (n = 10) and C2384T (n = 1) in domain V region of 23S rRNA. One isolate of S. arlettae showed both mutations. Among three isolates no mutation was identified. There was no correlation between linezolid MIC and cfr gene, type of mutation detected, number of mutant copies. Discussion and/or Conclusion(s): LR is emerging in diverse species of CoNS without prior exposure. Multiple mechanisms contributed to resistance and novel mutations were detected. Resistance mediated by cfr gene is of great concern as it can be rapidly disseminated and capable of transmitting horizontally between diverse species. ID: 4776 Bacteriophages in prophylaxis of healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) in a neurosurgical intensive care unit (ICU) Background: Phages have been used to prevent and/or treat infectious diseases of bacterial etiology for almost a century. Aim(s)/Objective(s): The purpose of this research was to establish the effect of a single administration of bacteriophage in patients of neurosurgical ICU on circulation of hospital pathogens. Method(s) : 42 patients on prolonged mechanical ventilation in an ICU were administered a 20 mL dose (10 8 pfu/mL) of bacteriophage cocktail per os, some patients had multiple administrations. A phage cocktail combined host range was 73% of the antibiotic-resistant strains (A.baumannii, K.pneumoniae, P.aeruginosa) isolated in the ICU. Anti-phage IgG-antibodies were tested by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Results: A.baumannii, K.pneumoniae, P.aeruginosa were isolated from the samples of the patients' endotracheal aspirate (ETA), blood, urine and feces, with a content of up to 87%. In the first episode of trials, one day after a 3-day therapy, effective sanitation was confirmed in 62.5% of the cases. Pharmacokinetic tests have shown that per os administered bacteriophages penetrate through the gastrointestinal tract into blood, feces, urine, ETA. Repeated therapy did not result in a significant eradication of pathogens. Anti-phage immunity after the intake of preparation was tested by ELISA for presence of significant titers of specific IgG-antibodies. Discussion and/or Conclusion(s): The right course of action for using bacteriophage cocktails in ICUs will be to establish fixed contents of phage species in the cocktail with subsequent selection of phage strains (or mandatory alteration with new phage strains in cases of repeated administration for the same patient), active against current pathogens in the ICU, from an existing Phage Bank.",

Lelek 1 , Silje Bakken J\u00f8rgensen 1 , Andre Ingebretsen 2 . 1 Akershus University Hospital, 2 Oslo University Hospital Background: Clostridium difficile associated diarrhoea (CDAD) causes considerable morbidity and mortality world-wide. The emergence of virulent clones has increased CDAD morbidity in many countries. Aim(s)/Objective(s): To assure early outbreak detection in our hospital, we have established a local CDAD surveillance system. Method(s) : CDAD is diagnosed by the hospital microbiology laboratory by a two-step method using LAMP-technology. All positive samples are subsequently cultured, and C. difficile isolates are ribotyped at the national C. difficile reference laboratory. Infection control staff monitors new cases weekly. Results: During 2014 and 2015, 195 cases of CDAD were identified. 83 acquired their CDAD more than 48 hours after being admitted to the hospital, 68 acquired CDAD outside of the hospital, and 44 were only treated in primary care. Ribotypes 081, 131, 207 and NO24 occurred solely in hospitalized patients, while 087 and 106 were found only in patients that had not been admitted. There were a few others that originately only outside of the hospital. Discussion and/or Conclusion(s): The departments with the highest occurence of CDAD were the infectious diseases department and the haematology department. There was no significant accumulation of specific ribotypes on any ward. The distribution of ribotypes in our hospital differs from previously published distributions from other countries.",

Aim(s)/Objective(s): We aimed to assess the antibiotic susceptibility pattern of S. aureus from clinical specimens in a tertiary care hospital in Eastern India. Method(s): S. aureus was isolated and identified using standard methods between July 2015 and April 2016. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed per CLSI 2015 using standard discdiffusion or Etest. Results: Total 284 S. aureus were obtained from pus (61.6%), respiratory tract (10.9%), urine (9.5%), blood (8.8%), body fluids (6.3%), and catheter tips (2.8%). Overall, 127 (44.7%) were MRSA, while 158 (55.6%) were multidrug resistant. MRSA was highest in respiratory samples (67.7%), followed by urine (59.2%) and blood (56.0%). High resistance was to penicillin (81.7%), erythromycin (62.3%) and ciprofloxacin (52.1%), while low-level resistance was to linezolid (0.7%), tigecycline (2.1%), rifampicin (8.1%) and doxycycline (9.5%). All were susceptible to teicoplanin. 166 (58.4%) isolates were susceptible to vancomcin (MIC \u22642 \u03bcg/mL), while 118 (41.5%) demonstrated reduced vancomycin susceptibility (RVS) (MIC >2 \u03bcg/mL). The proportion of isolates with RVS was similar in both MRSA (53/127, 41.7%) and methicillinsensitive S. aureus (MSSA) (65/157, 41.4%). Discussion and/or Conclusion(s): High percentage of S. aureus demonstrated RVS, which may limit its usefulness in MRSA and be associated with increased complications in MSSA infections. Linezolid, tigecycline, rifampicin and doxycycline may be considered as alternatives. As the glycopeptide resistance is increasing globally commensurate with their increased use, the rates of vancomycin resistance along with other antibiotics among S. aureus should be investigated periodically.",

            "text": "Background: A 56-year-old diabetic with urosepsis had imaging confirming emphysematous pyelonephritis. Augmentin resistant enterobacter was cultured in admission urine and blood. As clinical condition deteriorated piperacillin/tazobactam was switched to Meropenem empirically and repeat imaging confirmed renal abscesses formation. Radiologically-guided drainage of pus yielded enterobacter again and drain fluid grew VRE. The patient was discharged after recovery was made with three weeks of ertapenem and linezolid. Readmission was required due to persisting urosepsis compounded by multi-organ failure. Urine again cultured enterobacter which was now AmpC positive but remained carbapenem sensitive. Imaging (third series) showed renal abscess recurrence not amenable for drainage. There was further clinical deterioration after initial recovery with Meropenem and attempts of continuous treatment in the community, from where urine cultured enterobacter resistant to carbepenems secondary to AmpC activity and porin loss. Further readmission culture yielded two different strains of E. coli, both were ESBL producers with Ciprofloxacin and Carbapenem sensitive and resistant strains. Imaging showed repeated recurrence of renal abscesses, which were drained radiologically. Treatment with meropenem, linezolid, ciprofloxacin and caspofungin saw marked clinical improvement, and repeat invasive cultures yielded no growth. Discussion and/or Conclusion(s): Source control is key in managing urosepsis. Empirical escalation of antimicrobial treatment at times of clinical deterioration without source control with abscess drainage in this case led to prolonged carbapenems use and the inevitable development of carbapenem resistance. Nephrectomy was indicated here due to recurring sepsis. However, one has to consider nephron preservation in patients with significant cardiovascular comorbidities, and the high peri-operative morbidities/ mortalities associated with unstable patients. Background: Neutropenic sepsis is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality amongst cancer patients receiving treatment. The management of which remains a challenge. NICE guidelines discourage the routine empirical use of aminoglycosides with broad-spectrum antibiotics because of toxicity concerns. However, with the emergence of resistant strains of micro-organisms; clinicians must identify those at risk and adjust antimicrobial agents based on a local antibiogram. Aim(s)/Objective(s): To review antibiotic usage, microbial identifications and antimicrobial sensitivities amongst adults with neutropenic sepsis. Method(s) : Data was collected as part of a retrospective audit of neutropenic sepsis at Hillingdon Hospital between 1/4/15 and 31/5/16. Results: There were eighty-three cases of neutropenic sepsis in sixty-three patients, forty-two of these were haemato-oncology patients and twenty-one oncology. Twenty-seven of fifty-eight positive culture results were gram-negative organisms. Eight isolates were resistant strains including six cases of Enterobacteriaceae and two cases of Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. Within the six resistant strains of Enterobacteriaceae, three isolates were ESBL producing, two were AmpC beta producing and one was Tazocin resistant by another mechanism. Five of six resistant Enterobacteriaceae strains were identified in haemato-oncology patients. Four of these strains were resistant to single agent Tazocin but sensitive to both Gentamicin and Meropenem. Discussion and/or Conclusion(s): Our small study supports the use of Gentamicin with Tazocin as first-line emperical anti-microbial therapy in high-risk haemato-oncology patients. A close collaboration between the microbiology and the frontline clinicians is essential in providing optimum antimicrobial therapy for neutropenic sepsis.",

The aim of this study was to determine if cadexomer iodine as a mono-therapy could reduce biofilm phenotype bacteria colonizing diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) invivo Results: Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Prevotella melaninogenica, Elizabethkingia meningoseptica, Propionibacterium acnes and Pseudomonas stutzeri were the most abundant bacterial species present across the samples before and after treatment. We observed a significant decrease in the diversity of and changes in the community composition after treatment with an increase in bacterial abundance. The presence of biofilm was determined via scanning electron microscope. We found that Iodosorb reduced but did not remove biofilms from 50% of the samples, whereas 36% revealed no changes and 14% started to produce biofilm. Log reductions of biofilm cells indicated that in 9 of 15 patients, a reduction of between 1 and 3 log 10 was possible. Discussion and/or Conclusion(s): Given the inherent tolerance of biofilms to many forms of antimicrobials, cadexomer Iodosorb demonstrated the ability to decrease bacterial diversity, load and biofilm formation. The effectiveness of this topical antimicrobial maybe increased further if used as an adjunct therapy in a biofilm based woundcare model. Additional analysis of wound characteristics and any shifts in community diversity are required to clarify why some wounds bacterial loads increase with the apparent use of cadexomer iodine.",

Aim(s)/Objective(s): In 2014, octenisan was introduced Trust wide for routine washing for all patients. This study aimed to review the introduction assessing the use, acceptability and susceptibility. Method(s) : Usage data, in the form of number of bottles of octenisan was ascertained for March 2014 to April 2015. Two questionnaires were developed to determine both staff and patient opinion regarding the information received about the antiseptic, the usage and acceptability. MIC and MBCs to octenisan were established for a panel of 77 MRSA isolates pre and post octenisan introduction. Results: The usage of octenisan varied by clinical area. A total of 237 staff and 99 patient questionnaires were completed and demonstrated a need for improved communication regarding both the availability and the correct duration for application, with only 3% knowing correct duration. Both patients and staff stated that they would be happy to continue using octenisan (98%) with no skin irritation being reported. Eleven isolates had an MBC >1 \u03bcg/mL, with the number increasing post introduction 9.8% (5/51) versus 23.1% (6/26). Discussion and/or Conclusion(s): Octenisan was widely accepted by both staff and patients, but there is a need for improved communication to ensure the product is being used effectively, especially in light of evidence of an increase in decreased susceptibility. on FQ resistance rates are scarce as resistance to first line drugs had been a trickle in Singapore, with only four rifampicin resistant and six multi drug resistant cases in 2011.

Concern was raised that the widespread use of FQs, often for urinary and respiratory tract conditions, may be selecting for FQ resistant MTB and that we aren't aware of it because we don't test enough isolates. Note that FQ resistance is 50-60% amongst hospital strains of Enterobacteriaceae. The concern was that when rifampicin resistance does become more common, we may then unearth a hidden problem of FQ resistance that may precipitate the emergence of 'XDR' TB. Aim(s)/Objective(s): To measure the prevalence of fluoroquinolone resistance in MTBC. Method(s) : Clinical samples from 364 patients, submitted between 2014 and 2016, that were smear and subsequently TB PCR positive were tested for quinolone resistance by amplification and sequencing of the quinolone resistance determining region. Results: A single mutation associated with quinolone resistance, either A90V, D94G or S91P, was found in three samples. Discussion and/or Conclusion(s): This FQ resistance rate of <1% is lower than the 2.5% rate reported in a study from the USA in 2009 and is lower than the rate of 3.5% seen in local MTBC with resistance to a first line drug. Results: We observed MGIT 960 PZA-resistance and a pncA mutation in 21 of 48 isolates. pncA mutations were detected in 3 MGIT 960 PZAsusceptible isolates. The sensitivity of pncA sequencing for detecting resistance was 100% (95% Confidence Interval (CI): 81.0% to 100%) and specificity 88.9% (95% CI: 69.7% to 97.1%). We identified 3 mutations not previously reported in the literature. Discussion and/or Conclusion(s): Amongst these isolates pncA sequencing is a good predictor for PZA-resistance in if used in conjunction with the MGIT 960. Three new mutations were identified. Future research should include evaluation of pyrazinamidase activity, rpsA and panD genes.",

Results: 10 CRGNB isolates were identified (K. pneumoniae 7, P. aeruginosa 2 and 1 A. baumannii) from 9 individual patients. Colistin MIC ranged from 8 to 256 mg/L. Median age was 53 years (range 30-94), 5 males. Eight patients were admitted to the ICU. Two patients had received kidney transplants abroad within the preceding 3 months. Six patients required mechanical ventilation during their hospital stay; all patients had central venous access. Only 4 patients had active CRGNB infection, all caused by K. pneumoniae (bacteraemia 1, urinary tract infection with secondary bacteraemia 1, hospital acquired pneumonia 1 and intra-abdominal infection 1). Treatment regimens included tigecycline, meropenem, co-trimoxazole and colistin for a median duration of 14 days (range 6-32). Clinical and microbiological response was achieved in all but 1 patient. Five patients were colonised with CRGNB (K. pneumoniae 3, P. aeruginosa 1 and A. baumannii 1). Site of colonisation was the respiratory tract in 3, wound in 2 and urinary tract in 1 patient.

Pennine Acute Hospitals Trust Background: Multi-drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is defined as an infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains resistant to at least rifampicin and isoniazid, whereas extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) has additional resistance to any fluoroquinolone and at least one injectable second line drug (amikacin, kanamycin or capreomycin). In 2014, 502 cases of MDR-TB and two cases of XDR-TB were reported in the UK. These patients require complex costly antibiotic regimens with significant toxicities, and outcomes remain poor. This highlights the need for more clinical experience with newer agents such as bedaquiline. Aim(s)/Objective(s): Our aim is to present our experience of managing MDR/XDR-TB, as well as to present our findings in three patients managed using bedaquiline. Results: At our unit we have managed thirteen patients with MDR-TB and one patient with XDR-TB between 2011 and 2015. We present three of these patients who received six months of bedaquiline through the compassionate use programme as part of their treatment course. We explore the challenges in the two MDR-TB cases that led to bedaquiline use in the second phase of both patient's treatment, and the sensitivities that led to use of bedaquiline from the outset in our case of XDR-TB. Furthermore we discuss the significant risk of toxicity with bedaquiline, including prolongation of the QTc interval, and suggested monitoring schedules. All three patients improved following treatment and have not required further TB treatment to date. Discussion and/or Conclusion(s): This case series highlights the complexities of managing resistant TB and adds to experiential evidence of the use of bedaquiline.",

Some will be suitable for receiving their antibiotics in the community through OPAT (outpatient parenteral antimicrobial therapy) services. These services include: administration of the intravenous antimicrobial treatment in a hospital out-patient clinic; at home by general or specialist nurse; or patient self-administered following training. In the UK there is uncertainty regarding which service represents the best value for money. Aim(s)/Objective(s): This study aimed to estimate the cost-effectiveness of these different OPAT services. Method(s) : A cost effectiveness decision analytic model was developed using a discrete event simulation technique. The model estimated costs and outcomes using quality adjusted life years (QALYs). OPAT services were simulated including nurses and consultation room capacity for a given population at risk. Results: For short term infection, hospital outpatient administration was the most expensive service and provided negligible QALY gains compared to services provided by nurses visiting at home. Administration at home by a specialist nurse was estimated to be the most cost-effective service. For long term infections, whilst patient self-administration was the cheapest option, specialist nurse administration offered the most QALY gain resulting in a combination of the two services being the most cost-effective configuration. Discussion and/or Conclusion(s): Nurse administration and patient self-administration of intravenous antimicrobial treatment were the most cost-effective strategies. However a lack of service capacity will result in treatment delays, greater health risks and increased costs which eventually impact on service cost-effectiveness.",

Imperial College London Background: Wide inter-and intra-individual pharmacokinetic (PK) variability has been observed in vancomycin therapy. We developed and investigated, in-silico, two closed loop-systems for precision antimicrobial delivery of vancomycin against defined PK-PD targets. Method(s) : A Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controller and an Iterative Learning Controller (ILC) were designed to control continuous and intermittent vancomycin infusions, respectively using therapeutic drug monitoring levels. One-and two-compartment PK models obtained from 24 patients receiving vancomycin were used to evaluate the controllers. Variables such as weight, clearance, ethnicity, gender, and age were considered. Intra-day variability of clearance and sensor error were simulated to produce more realistic in-silico conditions. For the PID controller, a continuous vancomycin sensor, was assumed. A 24-hour Area-Under-the-Curve(AUC):Minimum-Inhibitory-Concentration (MIC) (AUC:MIC) > 400 was defined as success target for both controllers. The PID controller was evaluated using the two-compartment model and the set-point (i.e. plasma concentration) was periodically adjusted (e.g. 6 hourly) in order to achieve the overall 24-hour target. The ILC controller was tested using the one-compartment model, a 12-hour sampling time, a 1000 mg initial dose, and a trough level set-point of 10 mg/L. Results: The PID controller achieved the set-point (AUC:MIC > 400) for all 24 individuals in less than 5 hours. For the ICL controller, 22/24 simulated individuals achieved AUC:MIC > 400. 2/22 individuals had AUC:MIC > 700 that may be associated with toxicity. Discussion and/or Conclusion(s): Both the PID and ILC controller simulations attained required PK-PD targets. The PK profiles obtained were within acceptable ranges observed in clinical practice. This provides evidence to support the potential feasibility of using closedloop systems for antimicrobial delivery.",

Increasing resistance to carbapenems (often considered the last line in antibiotics in the treatment of gram-negative infections) has led to the requirement for rapid and robust methods for the analysis of carbapenemase activity in these organisms. Aim(s)/Objective(s): From September 2014, NHS Lothian has been performing in-house multiplex real-time PCR for OXA-48, VIM, NDM, KPC and IMP carbapenemase-producing organisms alongside Rapidec Carba NP testing and detection of growth on ChromID CARBA SMART media. The sensitivity and specificity of these assays were assessed over a 24 month period. Method(s) : This review detailed the investigation of 81 isolates from the period September 2014 to Aug 2016 including 38 carbapenamasepositive isolates and 43 carbapenemase-negative isolates. Results: The sensitivity and specificity of the in-house PCR to detect the OXA-48, VIM, NDM, KPC and IMP (\"big 5\") targets was assessed to be 100% and 100%. The chromogenic screening agar ChromID CARBA SMART had a sensitivity of 97.3% and a specificity of 95.3% for detection of carbapenemase-producing organisms. The Rapidec Carba NP had a sensitivity of 97.3% and a specificity of 97.6%. Two OXA-23 producing isolates and two IMI-producing isolates were all positive by Rapidec Carba NP and characterised by ARMRL Colindale. Discussion and/or Conclusion(s): The overall compilation of Carbapenemase-producing Organisms over the 24 month period in NHS Lothian was NDM (21%), OXA-48 (29%), VIM (24%), IMP (11%), KPC (5%), OXA-23 (5%) AND IMI (5%). A robust, reliable and rapid workflow for laboratory detection of Carbapenemase-producing organisms has been validated for use in NHS Lothian.",

QMUL Background: Oral microbiology investigation forms an important role in managing orofacial infections and patient care. Recently, the Public Health England (PHE) updated their oral mucosal standards for microbiology investigations (SMI) . Candida infection is one of the most frequent oral infections that require proper diagnosis, for optimum management especially with the increased immunocompromised population and the reported emergence of antifungal resistance. Therefore, this study analysed the antifungal resistance in oral Candida infection. Aim(s)/Objective(s): To analyse the antifungal resistance pattern in oral Candida infection reported by one of the oral microbiology laboratory in a dental hospital in the UK. Method(s) : Data from oral microbiology laboratory reports was collected electronically retrospectively in a two-year period (2014) (2015) . Subsequently, Oral Candida reports were studied and the sensitivity patterns were analysed. Results: In the period between the 1st of January 2014 to the 31st of December 2015, a total of 2051 oral mucosal swabs received, only 29% (594/2051) of these swabs grew yeasts, 95.6%(568/594) of the yeast isolates were identified to species level. Susceptibility tests were performed for 9.5% (54/568) of the reported Candida. Candida was reported 100% sensitive to Ambizome, Itraconazole, Nystatin, Caspofungin and voriconazole, and 95% to Fluconazole and Echinocandin. Resistance was reported only in non-albicans Candida (Candida glabrata, Candida krusei and Candida guilliermondii). Discussion and/or Conclusion(s): This study highlights that Candida isolated from oral infection remains very sensitive to the commonly used antifungal agents. However, sensitivity testing is still justified in cases of failure of treatment, immunocompromised patients and infection with non-albicans Candida.",

Since 2012 there has been a Scottish national alert flagging newly identified plasmid mediated transferable mechanisms via the cfr gene and recently the Optr-A gene. The Optr-A gene encodes an ABC transporter which confers resistance to oxazolidinones and phenicols. We have identified three separate Optr-A mediated Linezolid resistant Enterococcus faecalis isolates from urine samples in NHS Grampian from 2014 to 2016. It is extremely rare to identify this resistance mechanism. Aim(s)/Objective(s): To describe these three cases and investigate risk factors for acquiring these infections and identify potential links between patients Method(s): To review lab system records, and Vitek 2 sensitivities and typing for comparison; to collate clinical information and establish whether the patients were managed for acute episodes of urinary infection; and to identify epidemiological risk factors for acquiring these isolates including past medical histories, hospital admissions, links to farming, and travel histories including to Ireland. Results: The results from the lab system search and the case histories from GP interviews will be described. Discussion and/or Conclusion(s): Plasmid mediated mechanisms are of considerable public health importance due their potential to transfer and confer resistance to other strains and species. Background: Published literature from resource-limited settings is infrequent, although urinary tract infections (UTI) are a common cause of outpatient presentation and antibiotic use. Point-of-care test (POCT) interpretation relates to antibiotic use and antibiotic resistance. Aim(s)/Objective(s): We aimed to assess the diagnostic accuracy of POCT and their role in UTI antibiotic stewardship.",

Results: In 247 patients, 82.6% female, the most common symptoms were dysuria (81.2%), suprapubic pain (67.8%) and urinary frequency (53.7%). After excluding contaminated samples, UTI was diagnosed in 52.4% (97/185); 71.1% (69/97) had a significant growth on culture, and >80% of these were Escherichia coli (20.9% produced extendedspectrum \u03b2-lactamase (ESBL)).

Hinchingbrooke NHS Hospital Background: There have been a number of UK national guidelines to support Antimicrobial Stewardship pulished recently. The diversity of these resources, given that they have been produced by different expert groups, and at different time points, makes it challenging for teams to establish which guidance to follow. In response to this, the recommendations from these national resources were reviewed and collated into one complete AMS tool to provide clarity to enable the recommendations to be followed. The intention is to use the tool to enable a peer review of AMS activities in acute NHS Trusts in the East of England region. Aim(s)/Objective(s): To develop a tool to facilitate the peer review of antimicrobial stewardship activities in acute hospitals in the EoE. Method(s) : Guidance from national documents relating to antimicrobial stewardship were reviewed and used to formulate a draft tool. This tool was circulated to the EoE regional antimicrobial pharmacist's network for comment. The draft tool was used as part of a pilot peer review visit at two acute hospitals. Results: Feedback received from the participants of the pilot peer review informed the publication of the final peer review tool. The tool was able to identify gaps in antimicrobial stewardship practice at each site. Discussion and/or Conclusion(s): The next stage of implementation will be to adopt a peer review process using the tool across the East of England region. We hope that this system will provide a unique and systematic review of AMS activities and lead to recommendations for improvement and sharing of best practice throughout the region.",

Aim(s)/Objective(s): To implement a ward based antimicrobial stewardship programme for nurses highlighting key opportunities for intervention, encouraging 'antibiotic conversations' and acting as effective safety nets. Method(s) : Ward buzz session ran over 6 weeks from May -June 2015. Materials and training were tested separately. Training was focused on antibiotic policies and key opportunities to initiate antibiotic conversations. Pre/post training questionnaires were used to assess the impact of training and nurse confidence levels. Paired T-test was used to assess impact. Results: 13 nurses were trained and 12 pre/post questionnaires were returned. 83% (n = 10) of nurses said it changed their practise. 100% would recommend training to colleagues. A statistically significant increase in confidence in initiating conversations ( p = 0.046) was observed. Pre-training 75% of nurses had \u22642 conversations per week, post-training 67% had \u22653 conversations. A statistically significant increase in confidence assessing vancomycin levels (P = 0.005) was demonstrated. No significant change in confidence with gentamicin was seen ( p = 0.054). Overall nurses were more confident at querying antibiotic prescribing, a clear safety benefit for patients. Discussion and/or Conclusion(s): Although the sample size was small, nurses showed increased awareness of antibiotic policies and increased confidence in using them, resulting in increased nurse initiated antibiotic conversations.

Results: Twenty seven employees consented and were interviewed. Twenty participants were pharmacists with nineteen employees working mainly in a large chain across five regions, 14 had been in practise for up to five years. Most interviewees thought that the pharmacy was an ideal place to engage patients in an antimicrobial stewardship initiative with a need for a multi pronged approach. Although the tool was perceived to be useful, few were aware it existed or had any experience in using this. A lack of training around antimicrobial stewardship was also identified.

Aim(s)/Objective(s): To determine the delivery by community pharmacists of the antimicrobial resistance strategy, pharmacist's views on challenging GP's about antibiotic prescribing and point of care testing for early detection of infections. Method(s) : This study required and received ethics approval. Following consent, a questionnaire was sent out in January 2016 to participating community pharmacists across Calderdale and Kirklees. Results: Of the 50 questionnaires received, 28 pharmacists (56%) were aware of their local antibiotic guidelines and 38 (76%) did not monitor local antibiotic prescribing from their GPs, whereas 15 (30%) never ask patients what an antibiotic is for. Qualitative data from the study showed pharmacists thought this question too sensitive but would discuss if written on a prescription for antibiotics. Only 23 (46%) pharmacists always check for allergies, 32 (64%) explained the dose, 31 (62%) explained about completing the course, 26 (52%) explained about the avoidance of sharing antibiotics and there is support from 37 (74%) for point of care testing, 45 (90%) for expansion of a vaccination programme and 38 (76%) for more emphasis on hand washing. Discussion and/or Conclusion(s): Potential practice improvements by community pharmacists include the indication on an antibiotic prescription, a checklist including allergies of patients, counselling (avoiding sharing), general hygiene and patient self-help guides. The study also suggests diagnostic services are something community pharmacists would develop which may show further implementation of the 5-year antimicrobial strategy.",

To investigate patient views on trust in healthcare professionals giving advice on antibiotics and views on NHS 'treating your infection' leaflets. Method(s) : This study received ethical approval. Consent from 10 pharmacies allowed data to be collected from patients obtaining a prescription for antibiotics in January 2016. Patients received a questionnaire, a participant information leaflet and NHS 'treating your infection' leaflet. Results: Of the 121 questionnaires, 83 patients (69%) saw community pharmacists before their GP for cold/flu, 90 (74%) stopped antibiotics before completing the course, 20/90 (30%) felt better, 16/90 (7%) had side effects, 48 (40%) flushed leftovers down the toilet. One hundred (83%) patients supported their indication on their prescription but for eg. HIV, chlamydia, 18 (18%) changed their mind with 91 (75%) saying they knew about antimicrobial resistance via the media, however 81 patients (67%) didn\u2032t trust this source. The NHS self-help guide was favoured by 92 (76%) and 104 (86%) supported community pharmacy access to their record. Discussion and/or Conclusion(s): A check list of community pharmacy antibiotic counselling points would improve adherence to the 5-year antimicrobial strategy, ensuring relevant information is from trusted sources. The indication on antibiotic prescriptions at the patient's discretion, would help to improve antibiotic monitoring and counselling. ",

Aim(s)/Objective(s): These consults offer ward-based infection education, promote prudent antimicrobial prescribing and support clinical colleagues optimise infection investigation and management. They support the wider antimicrobial stewardship agenda in NHSGGC, which combines persuasive and restrictive strategies to promote safe, effective and prudent antimicrobial use. Method(s) Background: 16S rRNA PCR (16S PCR) is utilised in clinical microbiology to identify organisms from culture negative clinical specimens, with the potential to optimise empiric antimicrobial management. Selected critical specimens were referred to a UK laboratory for 16S PCR on a case-by-case basis and after review of local culture results. Method(s): We investigated if 16s PCR influenced antimicrobial management over a one year period (2015), by conducting a retrospective review of specimens sent for 16S PCR. Specimen type, result turnaround time (TAT) and the clinical impact of a positive result were evaluated. Results: Seventy-eight specimens were sent from 60 patients, with an average TAT of five days (range 1-11). A large proportion (35, 45%) were from neurosurgical patients and included; CSF (17), bone flap (5) and intracranial material (13). Overall, positive results were received on 33 specimens (42%) from 28 patients (46%). Of those, treatment information was available for 24 (86%), with de-escalation to a narrower spectrum agent upon receipt of positive 16S PCR possible for five (20%). Of 32 patients, from whom 45 specimens were sent, with DNA not detected, treatment information was available in 21 (66%), with two patients having antimicrobials discontinued upon receipt of the negative result. Discussion and/or Conclusion(s): 16S rRNA PCR has a role in antimicrobial stewardship for complex infection requiring lengthy treatment courses, whereby providing evidence of presence of microbial DNA may support de-escalation decisions or absence of microbial DNA may support decisions to discontinue empiric treatment in selected patients.",

Method(s) : This study received ethical approval. Questionnaires were handed out to University of Huddersfield students at a stand promoting awareness of antimicrobial resistance on Antibiotic awareness day November 2015. Results: From 90 questionnaires, 54.4% (n = 49) students missed and/or stopped before the antibiotic course ended, 72.2% (n = 65) correctly identified antibiotics solely effective against bacterial infections and a chi-squared test determined healthcare/applied science students were more likely to correctly identify this showing a statistically significant result ( p = 0.038) with a small effect (Phi = 0.219). For cold/flu symptoms only 66.7% (n = 67) students saw a pharmacist before GP however 61.1% (n = 55) support the cause of infection on their prescription with 21 of these feeling uncomfortable for personal conditions such as chlamydia, HIV and thrush. Handwashing was important for 70.9% (n = 61) who used good hand washing technique. Discussion and/or Conclusion(s): Students' knowledge on antimicrobial resistance needs improving, many students were not taking their antibiotics correctly.

Senior pharmacists were tasked to perform monthly ward stewardship visits, supported by further education and referral of complex cases to the stewardship MDT. Activity is reviewed, collated and discussed at pharmacy directorate meetings. This approach is supported by a comprehensive stewardship strategy within the Trust. Results: This intervention significantly increased the number of stewardship encounters (149 patients reviewed monthly by pharmacy and 123 by the MDT). Pharmacist-led rounds had a lower intervention rate (31%vs46%) and made different intervention types, most commonly improving prescription documentation, and dose adjustment, with similar rates of IV to PO switch (6%vs8%). CDI rates were significantly reduced (by 53% in 2013/14) and have remained under trajectory. Documented clinical review has increased from 77% to 90%. Discussion and/or Conclusion(s): The rounds have positively contributed to stewardship within the Trust. Work in 2016/17 will focus on understanding clinical variation in these stewardship rounds both in the number of patients reviewed and the intervention rates. Background: The slow implementation of electronic prescribing and medicines administration (EPMA) has been identified as a barrier to stewardship in the UK.

NHS Borders Background: The benefits of multidisciplinary wardrounds in promoting good antimicrobial stewardship have been previously described. Antimicrobial Stewardship (AMS) Wardrounds require access to current data on the patients under their review and should have a secure system of recording their activity for future reporting. In this regard the usefulness of the ICNET NG system in surveillance by hospital Infection Control and Prevention Teams has been well established. Aim(s)/Objective(s): This study investigated the potential to extend the use of the system to hospital AMS wardrounds. Method(s): Data on patients referred to the AMS wardround at a general hospital were recorded using the ICNET NG \"live staging\" system. The reasons for referral were classified into one of three categories (alert antimicrobials, aminoglycoside courses >3 d, clinical pharmacist request). Outcomes after AMS wardround were classified into one of five categories (continue, change, stop, IV to oral switch, referral for outpatient antibiotic therapy (OPAT). The system was qualitatively compared to the previous paper-based method by users Results: Data on patients referred to the AMS wards round over a period of 6 months was reviewed. Users' experience of using the ICNET software suggested benefits of the electronic system in terms of accessibility to relevant patient data and ease of activity reporting Discussion and/or Conclusion(s): The ICNET NG Clinical Surveillance software can be used as a patient monitoring and recording tool for AMS wardrounds.",

Andrew Seaton 5 . 1 Healthcare Improvement Scotland, 2 NHS Lothian, 3 University of Strathclyde, 4 NHS National Services Scotland, 5 NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde Background: Guidance from the Scottish Antimicrobial Prescribing Group on use of carbapenems and piperacillin/tazobactam ( piptaz) was implemented through incorporation into local guidance in 2014. Aim(s)/Objective(s): Our aim was to establish the extent to which this local guidance was being translated into clinical practice. Method(s): A bespoke point prevalence study (PPS) was performed in acute hospitals during October 2015 using a validated web-based tool to determine whether prescribing complied with local guidance. Anonymised data from all patients prescribed these antibiotics was collected, input to the PPS website and local reports generated. Data for all boards were then aggregated to create national reports. Results: The PPS was completed by 13 of the 15 health boards and 478 prescriptions were analysed. Results showed that compliance with prescribing policies for use of meropenem, the most frequently used carbapenem, was high but compliance varied considerably for piptaz. Documentation of indication for use was recorded in 90% of meropenem prescriptions but was less well documented for piptaz use. Documentation of a review or stop date for both meropenem and piptaz varied greatly (0-100%) but was generally low. Board-level data have allowed identification of boards with high compliance with these measures, and sharing of good practice. Discussion and/or Conclusion(s): This study demonstrates variation in practice across Scotland and is the second stage of an improvement programme to optimise the use of meropenem and piptaz. Further qualitative work is ongoing to evaluate clinician behaviour in use of these antibiotics to inform a national improvement plan.",

NHS Lothian Background: IVOS ward-rounds were implemented in NHS Lothian acute hospitals in 2014 as a means of improving antimicrobial stewardship. The contribution of the Antimicrobial Pharmacists' on these ward-rounds to achievement of improved antimicrobial prescribing has not been formally assessed before. Aim(s)/Objective(s): The aim of this study was to assess the effectiveness of the Antimicrobial Pharmacists' contribution to achievement of improvements in antimicrobial stewardship as part of the IVOS ward-rounds programme in NHS Lothian. Method(s): All pharmaceutical care interventions were recorded by the Antimicrobial Pharmacists on eight IVOS rounds. The interventions were reviewed by NHS Lothian's Antimicrobial Team (AMT) and risk assessed for possible adverse outcomes for patients. The results were feedback to the medical staff as part of an antimicrobial stewardship education programme to help improve safe antimicrobial prescribing. Results: A total of 240 patients were reviewed during the eight IVOS rounds. 46 additional interventions and 29 referrals to medical staff were made by the pharmacist. The majority of the pharmaceutical care interventions were assessed as being moderate to high risk for possible adverse patient outcomes. These interventions were used to inform an antimicrobial stewardship education programme which was delivered to the 4 wards where the IVOS study was undertaken. Discussion and/or Conclusion(s): Documentation and assessment of pharmaceutical care interventions on IVOS ward-rounds is a novel approach to improvement of antimicrobial stewardship by medical staff. Review of the Antimicrobial Pharmacists' interventions and subsequent development of an education programme for junior medical staff on antimicrobial stewardship has facilitated achievement of improved antimicrobial prescribing.",

With the threat of a 'post-antibiotic era' looming, it is the next generation of doctors who will be at the forefront of the battle against antimicrobial resistance. Aim(s)/Objective(s): We sought to explore the knowledge, attitudes and perceptions among fourth year medical students at Brighton and Sussex Medical School (UK) regarding antimicrobial stewardship. Method(s): We distributed a knowledge, attitudes and perceptions survey to fourth year medical students completing their formal Infectious Diseases module. The surveys were completed during teaching session and then formed the basis for discussion. Results: There were a total of 91 respondents over five separate sessions from April 2015 -March 2016. Just 36% of students were familiar with the term 'antimicrobial stewardship'. Students strongly agreed that antibiotics are overused in the UK and that resistance is a problem in the UK, but were neutral with regards to resistance being a problem in their hospital. Only 9% felt confident in prescribing antibiotics. Specific areas of weakness included de-escalation of antibiotics, dosing, and transitioning from IV to oral antibiotics, as well as appropriate prescribing in the context of known resistance. Discussion and/or Conclusion(s): Our findings suggest that students perceive resistance as a national/international problem rather than a local problem, and that future prescribers lack knowledge and understanding of antimicrobial stewardship required to counter the spread of resistance. Further studies are required to clarify the generalisabilty of these findings and guide future medical school curricula.",

Aim(s)/Objective(s): To assess the indications and how early provision of PCT results influence patients' management and outcome. Method(s): Details of 130 PCT episodes were collected from 104 patients admitted to Basingstoke and North Hampshire Hospital (BNHH). Patients were followed prospectively for 7 days to assess the outcome. Results: The majority of patients were between 40-90 years (95%). 62% of them were males. The main indications for PCT were to support the diagnosis or exclusion of bacterial infection [n-60, (46%)] and to assess the response to treatment [n-33, (25%)]. Only 8% of PCT were done for earlier stopping of antibiotics when a course already started. In 37% of episodes, the clinicians were continued the same antibiotics.

There was no significant change in AKI rate among elective patients. Discussion and/or Conclusion(s): We found that a change in orthopaedic antibiotic prophylaxis policy in NHS Grampian was associated with an increase in post-operative AKI. This is consistent with observations in other boards and supports the new recommendation away from this policy made by SAPG in 2012. A key feature of Epic is the intervention reporting module ('iVent') which allows pharmacists to communicate any interventions and recommendations they have made. We investigated the use of iVents specifically to document AMS interventions. Aim(s)/Objective(s): 1. To investigate the types of AMS interventions and classify types and clinical impact of intervention 2. To assess whether there are differences in AMS interventions made between clinical areas and pharmacist grades. Method(s): A report was generated collating all AMS iVents recorded by pharmacists over a one year period. A peer-review group comprising antimicrobial pharmacists and consultant microbiologists was consulted to decide on suitable categories for data analysis. iVents were then sorted according to these categories and assigned values for their potential clinical impact. This group also reviewed a random sample of 50 interventions to assess agreement for categories and severity and whether the intervention made was clinically appropriate. Categories of intervention included administration advice, dose optimisation, course length optimisation, patient counselling, therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM), choice of agent advice, vaccination referrals, IV to Oral Switch, Supply Issues and stopping unnecessary prescriptions. Results: Preliminary data from a one-month period (April 2016) demonstrated that: 1. 503 interventions were made 2. the most common AMS intervention is for antimicrobials requiring TDM and the least common patient counselling and IV to oral switching 3. most interventions are made on intensive care wards and the fewest on neurology wards 4. number of interventions made increases with grade of pharmacist 5. most interventions have 'medium' clinical impact ID: 4840 Personalised feedback of antibiotic prescribing data to primary care teams Jacqueline Sneddon 1 , William Malcolm 2 , Marion Bennie 2 , Helen Storkey 3 , Terry McLaughlin 2 , James Smith 2 , Charis Marwick 4 , Bruce Guthrie 5 , Sean Macbride-Stewart 6 , Dilip Nathwani 4 . 1 Healthcare Improvement Scotland, 2 NHS National Services Scotland, 3 NHS national Services Scotland, 4 NHS Tayside, 5 University of Dundee, 6 NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde Background: In Scotland feedback of prescribing data has proved successful with GPs for high risk medicines and dental practitioners for antimicrobial. A similar approach was designed to complement other interventions to reduce unnecessary antibiotic use by GPs. Aim(s)/Objective(s): This study aimed to establish a programme to provide GP practices with quarterly reports on their own antibiotic prescribing data along with benchmarking information. Method(s): A study steering group was established and funding secured for creation of data reports. The pilot phase involved 50% of practices in four health board areas, randomly selected using a stratified sampling frame, receiving the report. Details of these practices were obtained and automated email messaging set up. Results: Practices will receive quarterly reports containing their rates of antibiotic prescribing compared to local and national benchmarks along with suggested actions and details of support resources. The first report focussed on total antibiotic use and included key messages about improving use of antibiotics for respiratory tract infections. Reports were emailed directly to GP Practices along with a letter from the Chief Medical Officer. The next three reports will focus on urinary tract infection, risk of Clostridium difficile infection and skin and soft tissue infections. Following a time series analysis of changes in prescribing rate in the intervention practices compared to control practices we plan to implement the intervention across all GP practices in Scotland. Discussion and/or Conclusion(s): This automated feedback intervention is an attractive addition to our stewardship programme as it is supported by good evidence and can be implemented nationally at relatively low cost.",

Many antimicrobial stewardship initiatives have primarily targeted doctors and pharmacists, however the potential contribution that nurses could make in this area has not yet been fully explored. Aim(s)/Objective(s): The primary aim of this initiative was to enhance nursing knowledge around antimicrobial stewardship by focusing on the key areas of nursing influence. A secondary focus was to encourage appropriate urine sampling in the older adult population and those with indwelling urinary catheters through the promotion of the Scottish Antimicrobial Prescribing Group UTI management resources. Method(s): Educational programmes were delivered to all community hospital nursing teams in NHS Tayside over a 12 month period. Questionnaires were issued pre and post intervention to assess the impact of the intervention. Results: Comparisons between the pre-intervention and postintervention questionnaire demonstrate an improvement in nursing knowledge in relation to antimicrobial stewardship and infection management. This was statistically significant in six of the fourteen questions (p = \u22640.01). There was a statistically significant reduction in urine samples submitted for culture after the intervention, from mean 20.9 to 14.9 per 1000 OBD per month (difference 6.0, t-test p = 0.009). Discussion and/or Conclusion(s): Nurses are the constant in the delivery of patient care, therefore, as a profession they are ideally placed to enhance antimicrobial management within the multidisciplinary team. Through education and awareness nurses can significantly impact on infection outcomes and contribute to optimising antimicrobial treatment whilst delivering high quality, safe and patient focussed care.

NHS Lothian has been slower to reduce use and one factor may be recommendations for prolonged courses of broad-spectrum antibiotics by secondary care. Aim(s)/Objective(s): This study looks at prescribing data to identify whether or not extended courses of broad-spectrum antibiotics are a significant contributory factor to overall use Method(s): The Prescribing Information System for Scotland provided a six year time series analysis, comparing NHS Lothian with the other NHS Boards for overall antibiotic, and broad-spectum use. Prescribing Information System identified prescribing of prolonged courses of broad-spectrum antibiotics. Current Lothian Joint Formulary (LJF) clinical indications were reviewed and the expected resultant prevalence calculated. This was compared with current use. The amount of antibiotics prescribed for longer duration than LJF recommendations was analysed. Results: NHS Lothian remains the lowest total user of antibiotics in primary care. There has been much slower reduction in broadspectrum use, but it is now below the Scottish average. 10% of prescriptions were for longer than 14 days, the recommended longest duration in the LJF. The majority of these prescriptions were for 21 days, with only 0.8% of all co-amoxiclav prescriptions being for longer than 28 days. Discussion and/or Conclusion(s): Analysis of PIS data confirms that there is some prescribing of prolonged courses of broad-spectrum antibiotics, but not at a significant level. Prescribing duration of co-amoxiclav is mostly in line with the LJF, and at an expected level for the clinical conditions indicated for treatment.",

Aim(s)/Objective(s): The aim of this study is to evaluate the impact of the interventions made by antimicrobial stewardship team (AST) during their ward rounds on antimicrobial consumption and clinical outcome in a large district Hospital. Method(s): Twice weekly antibiotic stewardship ward round (ASW) was introduced in April 2016. Information on patients on antibiotics was collected from pharmacy records. Outcome of AST interventions over two month period were analysed. Monthly antibiotic consumption per 1000 admissions was monitored. Compliance with NG Quality standard 121 Statement 4 was audited. Data on clinical outcome and readmission within 28 days were also collected. Results: We reviewed 157 courses of antibiotic. The most commonly prescribed antibiotic during this period was tazocin (23.5%) followed by augmentin (21.6%). Approximately 88.5% of prescribed antibiotics were compliant with the trust antimicrobial guideline. AST stopped 54.7% of antibiotic courses, specified stop date for 19.7%, optimised dose in 2%, switched 5% to PO, de-escalated 7% & escalated 1.5%. More than one of the previous intervention was recommended for 5.7% of the courses. Out of 47 antibiotic courses audited, 42.5% met NG QS while it was not applicable in 40.5% of cases. Total antibiotic and tazocin consumption were significantly reduced from a baseline of 4472 and 252 DDD/1000 admissions respectively prior to intervention to 4211 (7%) and 170 (23%) DDD/1000 admissions post intervention. Discussion and/or Conclusion(s): Our ASW proved to be effective in optimisation antibiotic therapy and significantly reducing antibiotic consumption over short period without compromising patient care.",

Method(s): The following data were extracted for patients with a mycobacterial infection and at least one amikacin dose and peak concentration: age; weight; height; creatinine concentration; amikacin doses, concentrations and times. A MAP Bayesian pharmacokinetic analysis provided individual estimates of amikacin volume of distribution (V) and clearance (CL), which were used to predict end of infusion (1 h) and trough amikacin concentrations using guideline dosage regimens. Results: Data were available from 83 patients (49 male) of whom 51 received OD and 32 TW dosing.

UK Antimicrobial Stewardship guidance 'Start Smart Then Focus' encourages clinicians to undertake active 'review & revision' of prescribed antibiotics 48 hours after initiation. Aim(s)/Objective(s): We developed and piloted an intervention to support 'review and revise' prescribing decisions in acute respiratory infection (ARI), which remains the commonest indication for antibiotics. Method(s): Options for a simple, evidence-based 'RAPID' (Reducing unnecessary antibiotic prescribing in dyspnoea) decision tool were developed, before being iteratively reviewed and refined by a multidisciplinary working group. Stop criteria incorporated clinical observations, biomarkers and radiology. Antibiotic prescribing was reviewed at baseline and on day 2 of admission for unselected patients over 45 days before and 35 days during the intervention. Clinical teams were responsible for applying defined stopping criteria. Results: Across both time-points, 318 patients were prescribed ARI antibiotics. Criteria for stopping antibiotics at 48 hrs were defined as: a normal chest radiograph, day2 average NEWS score \u22644 and CRP \u2264 100. Antibiotics were prescribed unnecessarily in 35/144 patients (24.3%) in the pre-intervention phase. During the intervention phase, 38/174 prescriptions should have been stopped according to the RAPID criteria (21.8%) but only one fifth were actually stopped. Discussion and/or Conclusion(s): Even with good stake-holder engagement use of a stand-alone clinical decision tool did not reduce antibiotic prescribing in the acute medical setting. Safely reducing unnecessary antibiotic prescribing is likely to require more resource intensive interventions such as dedicated stewardship wardrounds. Background: Inappropriated prescribing was a matter of salient concern in China.",

Aim(s)/Objective(s): The aim of this study is to audit compliance with NICE QS statement 4 in relation to presumptive diagnosis of UTI and to find out whether microbiological samples were taken before starting antimicrobial therapy. Method(s) : This study was carried out in care of elderly wards in a large district hospital over a two week period. All patients prescribed antimicrobials for urinary tract infection were identified daily by the ward based pharmacist over the study period. Microbiological results were collected and interpreted by microbiologist. Clinical notes were reviewed and data was analysed. Results: We identified 28 patients on antimicrobials for UTI. The median patient age was 85 years old (71-97). Our study showed that 57% had urine dip while 86% of the patients had a urine culture done. Seventy nine (79%) were on the appropriate antimicrobial treatment based on the current culture results. C-Reactive protein (CRP) was raised (>20 mg/L) in 82% of the patients. Discussion and/or Conclusion(s): Our results showed that compliance with the trust antimicrobial guidelines and NQ standards was achieved in the majority of cases. Raising awareness of the staff to the importance of microbiological investigations is key to ensure appropriate antibiotic use. Background: Serum procalcitonin (PCT) is a more specific and sensitive biomarker for detecting bacterial infection compared to CRP and white cell count. We report on the use of PCT measurement as a diagnostic tool to support clinical decision making around antibiotic use in patients suspected of infection. Aim(s)/Objective(s): The aim of this study was to audit the use of serum PCT measurement in relation to antibiotic prescribing in a hospital setting. Method(s): Patients on medical and surgical wards (excluding ICU/ HDU) who had undergone PCT testing were audited during a 3 week clinical attachment in microbiology. Antibiotic prescribing decisions were reviewed from the notes within 24 hours of PCT results in accordance with Hampshire Hospitals' Guidelines. Results: Using the threshold of 0.25 mcg/L, 34 of 69 PCT results were elevated and 35 were negative. In 21 out of 34 (61.7%) elevated results, a clinical diagnosis of bacterial infection was supported and patients started, continued, or escalated antibiotics. In 26 of 35 (74.3%) negative PCT results, antibiotics were appropriately either withheld (68.6%) or stopped (5.7%). Discussion and/or Conclusion(s): We believe these findings to be clinically important as PCT results can aid clinicians in decision making regarding the withholding or cessation of antibiotics. This in turn reduces unnecessary prescriptions of \"just in case\" antibiotics. Serum PCT measurement can help achieve hospital antibiotic CQUIN targets and, importantly, reduce selective pressure and antimicrobial misuse in the rising era of antibiotic resistance.",

Aim(s)/Objective(s): The aims were to assess the use of Piperacillin-Tazobactam (Tazocin) within the Royal Hampshire County Hospital and the compliance of clinicians with expert advice and/or prescribing guidelines. Method(s): A real life audit was carried out by identifying patients prescribed Tazocin through the use of the electronic prescribing software, JAC. Over an 8 day period 36 patients were found and a case note review performed to assess the reasoning and circumstance of antibiotic prescription. Results: 27 patients (75%) were prescribed Tazocin according to trust guidelines or following advice from microbiology, 9 (25%) were not deemed compliant. Within the sample the majority of diagnoses were of an intra-abdominal or respiratory nature, in 39% and 36% of cases respectively. 26 prescriptions (72%) did not have a stop date. Discussion and/or Conclusion(s): Clinicians did not follow local protocol in 25% of cases irrespective of clinical appropriateness. Stop dates were included in a small proportion of prescriptions. Although the CQUIN can be a challenge, the findings here suggests it is potentially achievable by improving compliance with local guidelines and expert microbiology advice.",

Imperial College NHS Healthcare Trust Background: Point prevalence surveys (PPS) can demonstrate strengths and areas for improvement within antimicrobial stewardship (ASP) programmes but are inherently labour-intensive. Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust has undertaken PPS since 2002. In 2015/16 electronic prescribing (e-prescribing) was introduced, providing an opportunity to reassess delivery of PPS. Aim(s)/Objective(s): We aimed to evaluate how the introduction of e-prescribing affected PPS in terms of ease of data collection and human resources. Method(s): All inpatients scheduled to receive anti-infectives on the day of data collection were included in the February 2016 study. Antimicrobial pharmacists noted time taken to audit each clinical area and any significant ASP interventions made before analysis of results. Results: Of 84 wards (1267 patients) reviewed, 36 retained paperbased systems, 4 utilised specialist intensive care prescribing programmes and 44 had moved to e-prescribing. Whilst overall antimicrobial prescribing indicators remained similar to previous years, the average PPS time taken per ward (hh:mm) was reduced from 1:07 for paper-based areas to 00:24 for e-prescribing locations (00:32 in intensive care areas). On paper-based wards, interventions identified were around dose optimisation whereas those identified via electronic systems mainly concerned course duration. Discussion and/or Conclusion(s): Electronic record and prescription systems have dramatically reduced the time taken to undertake PPS. Even greater efficiency improvements are anticipated in future, following Trust-wide adoption of electronic prescribing. Interventions identified on paper systems involved dose optimisation whereas these were not seen within e-prescribing areas. It is hypothesized that in-built e-prescribing user support influenced the interventions identified. Background: In NHS Grampian the Antimicrobial Management Team co-ordinate annual antibiotic point prevalence audits across all acute hospitals, as recommended by the Scottish Antimicrobial Prescribing Group. Aim(s)/Objective(s): To monitor compliance with local antimicrobial guidelines, against agreed audit standards. Method(s): Data was collected by pharmacists using a standard data collection form over 2 days in November/December each year. The Antibiotic Pharmacists, in liaison with Medical Microbiologists, assessed whether antibiotic prescribing was 'appropriate'. Compliance against audit standards was calculated. A report summarising the results for all medical wards was disseminated to clinical staff each year and individualised reports sent to wards with the lowest rates of compliance with the audit standards. Method(s): As part of our Antimicrobial Stewardship strategy, we reviewed daily all pharmacy requests for protected antibiotics (i.e., meropenem, ertapenem and linezolid) in our Trust. We reviewed the case notes, drug chart and laboratory information system to evaluate the rationale for starting the protected antibiotic and whether the prescription was appropriate or not. The appropriateness of the prescription was discussed in a daily clinical meeting attended by Medical Microbiology Doctors and Antibiotic Pharmacists. The possible outcomes of the multi-disciplinary discussion were:",

The protected antibiotic was started as an escalation in most patients and a discussion with Microbiology was documented in half of the cases. The most common indication for starting the protected antibiotic was the recent isolation of a MDR organism not covered by the non-protected option, whilst allergy to penicillin was a contributing factor in choosing a carbapenem in around 20% of patients. The prescription was judged as appropriate in approximately 3/4 of all cases. Treatment de-escalation or stopping the whole antibiotic therapy was recommended for all patients receiving an inappropriate prescription and in some of the patients receiving an appropriate prescription.

University of Malaya Background: Fosfomycin (FM) was first introduced following the fermentation of Streptomyces strain in 1969. Following its unique position for uncomplicated UTI, its appropriate use is of paramount importance to mitigate the emergence of resistance. Aim(s)/Objective(s): We aim to look at the current practice of prescription in our large outpatient clinic. Method(s) : This is a retrospective study carried from April 2015 to May 2016 in primary care clinics affiliated to University Malaya Medical Centre, Malaysia. We recruited any patients above 12 years old who received single dose oral FM. We divided the patients into guideline compliant (GC) and non-guideline compliant (NGC) groups based on available consensus. Results: 100 patients were recruited from a list of 139. The median age was 54.6 (IQR 15-88) and female predominates (81%). 57 of the subjects had at least one co-morbidity and hypertension predominates (40%). There were 91 NGC occurrences. Reasons for NGC were asymptomatic bacteriuria/ABU (18, 19.7%), acute pyelonephritis (13, 14.2%), complicated UTI (16, 17.6%) and inappropriate investigations (urine culture (21, 23.1%) and ultrasound of kidney (4, 4.3%)). Urine analysis was the commonest test performed (87, 97%). FMT was prescribed wrongly in 66 subjects (wrong indications). Discussion and/or Conclusion(s): The data above illustrates the dire need for education in term of UTI management by the primary care physicians. The misuse of FM was common and not in accordance to the guideline. The additional investigations may be reflective of \"nonuncomplicated\" nature of UTI. In addition, the lack of susceptibility data on FM against the local contemporary urinary isolates should be addressed.",

Real outcome measures like 'infections cured' or 'resistance pressure' are elusive. Surrogate outcome measures like antibiotic consumption metrics are tendentious and confounded by other factors. So usually we measure process, typically by audit of antimicrobial prescribing. But audit is easy to do badly and difficult to do well: decisions are spread out in time and place as new information emerges, objective standards are difficult to set and we need to be careful that we are auditing stewardship specifically rather than medical practice more generally. The typical 'compliance audit' is unlikely to capture these complexities. We have developed an audit tool that assigns a score out of 10 to the decisions made at initiation ('start Smart\u2032) and a score out of 5 to the decisions made as treatment continues. We have refined this over several years and have now piloted its use in a systematic programme of audit and feedback on our Integrated Assessment Unit and back-ofhouse medical wards. Aim(s)/Objective(s): To describe deployment of our QASI-2 tool in a pilot systematic audit programme designed to assess the feasibility of the QASI-2 approach and to measure the quality of antimicrobial prescribing in our medical unit. Method(s): QASI-2: key aspects of the tool Results: Summary charts describing 322 initiation audits and 369 continuation audits Data on time taken to perform QASI-2 audits Discussion and/or Conclusion(s): Useful and feasible approach though time consuming Acceptable to clinical teamsgood engagement Importance of defining what constitutes a course.",

Oncology inpatients are susceptible to infection due to cancer and chemotherapy-associated immunocompromise, but use of broad-spectrum antibiotics is not always warranted. Aim(s)/Objective(s): This project aims to identify and tackle barriers to appropriate antibiotic prescribing in oncology inpatients at Southampton General Hospital. In doing so, we hope to reduce inappropriate use of broad-spectrum antibiotics. Method(s): Over one week, all twenty oncology inpatients who had received at least 72 hours of antibiotics were identified (excluding haematological cancer patients and those receiving stem cell transplant). We audited antibiotic choice and duration, investigations to identify infection source and severity, compliance with local guidelines, and outcomes of antibiotic reviews. The results were disseminated, and good practice guidelines were produced and incorporated into the Trust's application-based antibiotic policy. Results: Tazocin was used in 55% of patients, with no clear justification in 46% of these. Nearly 70% of patients received long antibiotic courses (>7 days), and no changes were made in 70% of antibiotic reviews. There was inadequate use of documentation, cultures to guide antibiotic prescribing, and of tools to assess infection risk (e.g. MASCC score not used in any patient with febrile neutropenia) or severity (e.g. blood lactate measured in only 36% of patients). Discussion and/or Conclusion(s): Inappropriate broad-spectrum antibiotic use was associated with inadequate assessment of infection risk, source and severity. By educating and empowering clinicians to improve these domains, we hope to reduce inappropriate antibiotic use (re-audit pending at the time of writing).",

We analysed major UK scientific research conferences to investigate the level of AMS behaviour change intervention reporting. Method(s): Leading UK 2015 scientific conference abstracts for 30 clinical specialties were identified and interrogated by four researchers. All AMS and/or antimicrobial resistance (AMR) abstracts were identified using validated search criteria. Abstracts were then independently reviewed by three researchers with reported behavioural interventions categorised using the behaviour change wheel framework described by Michie and colleagues. Results: Overall, conferences ran for 110 days with >57,000 delegates. 311/12,313 (2.5%) AMS-AMR abstracts (oral and poster) were identified. 118/311 (40%) were presented at the UK's infectious diseases/ microbiology conference. 56/311 (18%) AMS-AMR abstracts described behaviour change interventions. The commonest abstract reporting behaviour change interventions were quality improvement projects [44/56 (79%) ]. In total 71 unique behaviour change functions were identified. Policy categories; \"guidelines\" (16/71) and \"service provision\" (11/71) were the most frequently reported. Intervention functions; \"education\" (6/71), \"persuasion\" (7/71), and \"enablement\" (9/71) were also common. Intervention categories \"incentivisation\" and \"coercion\" and policy categories \"fiscal\" and \"legislation\" were not reported in any identified abstracts. Discussion and/or Conclusion(s): Despite the benefits of behaviour change interventions on antimicrobial prescribing, very few AMS-AMR studies at UK state-of-the-art conferences report implementing them in 2015. AMS interventions must focus on promoting behaviour change towards antimicrobial prescribing. Greater emphasis must be placed on non-infection specialties to engage them with the issue of behaviour change towards antimicrobial use.",

Results: Only 52 patients had blood cultures taken prior to the first dose of antibiotics. 25 patients had no cultures taken at all. Being apyrexial on admission was associated with a failure to take cultures, as was presenting with biliary sepsis and also being admitted to the surgical ward. 25% of blood cultures taken before antibiotics were positive compared to 13% of blood cultures taken after antibiotics.

QMUL Background: Antimicrobial stewardship is one of the most important strategies to tackle the increasingly serious threat of antimicrobial resistance globally. The Faculty of General Dental Practitioners (FGDP) and the Public Health England (PHE) issued guidelines to regulate the use of antimicrobials in primary dental care. However, poor adherence was reported in the literature. Barriers to guidelines adherence are expected to be different according to the local setting. Therefore, analysing these barriers is a very important step before developing the antimicrobial stewardship intervention. Aim: To develop a validated knowledge and attitude assessment tool assessing barriers and facilitators to guidelines adherence. Method: A questionnaire was developed based on Mitchi's behaviour change wheel to assess capability, motivation and opportunity in relation to the dental antimicrobial prescribing habits. The knowledge part of the questionnaire was modified from a previously published tool (Palmer et al., 2001) . After a peer review and consultation stage, a pilot audit was conducted. To validate the tool the results of the pilot was compared to the results of a prospective antimicrobial prescribing patterns audit in the same setting. Result: 30 participants took part in the questionnaire and 200 antimicrobial prescription episodes were also audited. There were no statistical significant difference in the concordance rate with the national and local guidelines when comparing the questionnaire and the prospective audit. Conclusion: We aim to present the newly developed knowledge and attitude assessment tool, which can be used to audit antimicrobial prescribing patterns and identify the best local antimicrobial stewardship interventions in dentistry. Background: Despite the recent advances in diagnostic and therapeutic strategies, infective endocarditis remains challenging to treat and thus associated with bad prognosis in terms of morbidity and mortality, particularly when uncommon microorganisms are involved.",

Results: A mitral valve vegetation was incidentally discovered by intraoperative transoesophageal echocardiography in a 70-year old lady undergoing aortic valve replacement. Empirical antibiotic treatment for infective endocarditis with gentamicin and teicoplanin was started. The precise identification of the causative agent relied on genotypic characterisation with 16S rDNA gene sequencing. Microbiologic culture was subsequently performed to obtain the antimicrobial susceptibility profile and adjust the antibiotic regimen accordingly. The patient was treated with a 4-week course of vancomycin and meropenem, followed by a further 2 weeks of daptomycin due to the identification of vancomycin-resistant enterococci in a rectal swab. After a long in-hospital stay, the patient eventually recovered clinically and biochemically and transthoracic echocardiogram demonstrated a well functioning mitral valve without residual lesions from the endocarditis. Discussion and/or Conclusion(s): This is, to the best of our knowledge, the first report showing that Paenibacillus provencensis can be a pathogen in humans and that a member of the genus Paenibacillus may be involved in native valve endocarditis. This case also emphasis the importance of 16S rDNA gene sequencing by real-time polymerase chain reaction, as a rapid and accurate method to identify microorganisms, like Paenibacillus, which can be missed by conventional microbiology investigations.

Discussion and/or Conclusion(s): Following confirmation of brucellosis she was treated with 6 weeks of ciprofloxacin and 2 weeks of gentamicin. She has had a good response and 6 months later remains well with only mild encephalopathy at times. Human brucellosis remains rare in the UK. This case highlights the need to consider it in those patients who present with pyrexia of unknown origin and have travelled to an endemic area. Due to her liver condition her treatment regimen was chosen to avoid rifampicin. The initial concern she might require a liver transplant has abated. Background: Visceral leishmaniasis is a rare illness to present in the UK although it should be considered in the differential when there is an appropriate travel history. A 76 year old male retired civil engineer had been under the haematologists for investigation of pancytopenia since November 2015. He presented with symptoms of weight loss, night sweats, loss of appetite and lethargy. He had a background of Psoriatic Arthritis for which he took Methotrexate. His travel history included holidays to North America, Morocco and more recently Spain. Lymphoma was considered a likely diagnosis with evidence of splenomegaly on imaging. He was listed for a splenectomy after repeated splenic biopsies came back showing only reactive changes. Results: His Leishmania serology came back strongly positive (Leishmania DAT Positive at a titre of 409,600 and Leishmania K39 test: Antibody to Leishmania K39 antigen: positive) a few days prior to his planned splenectomy. Discussion and/or Conclusion(s): Visceral Leismaniasis was considered the most likely diagnosis. He was treated with standard liposomal amphotericin B 3 mg/Kg (5 days). At latest follow up he has made a good recovery. His platelet count is now normal and haemoglobin and white cell count are improving. Leishmania was not considered in the initial differentials and it was a few months before his serology was performed. Although the majority of cases occur in countries such as Bangladesh, Brazil, India and Sudan it is also endemic in the Mediterranean area. Consideration should be given for this diagnosis if there is an appropriate travel history especially in an immunosuppressed individual. Background: A 72 year old Australasian holidaymaker was brought by ambulance to A + E complaining of severe, abrupt onset abdominal pain, present for 6 hours, and a sore throat for 4 days. On examination she was febrile 39.1\u00b0C, and was holding her neck. Her throat appeared normal with no cervical lymphadenopathy, but her anterior neck was tender. She was tachyopneic 40/min, saturation 95% on air, with HR 87 and BP 140/76. There was central and right upper quadrant abdominal tenderness. CXR showed a small right pleural effusion, also seen on CT abdomen which also demonstrated consolidation, but no other cause for her pain. Over three hours she became hoarse; complaining of \"a frog in my throat\". Nebulised adrenaline, intravenous ceftriaxone and dexamethasone were administered. A CT neck revealed significant soft tissue swelling and thickening of the epiglottis. Her airway was immediately secured and she was transferred to intensive care. Blood cultures were positive the following day with Gram-negative diplococci, later identified as Neisseria meningitidis. She was extubated within 24 hours, and completed 7 days of IV ceftriaxone before discharge. The Scottish Reference Laboratory confirmed the N. meningitidis serogroup Y with a rare MLST type for Scotland. Since 2014 Scottish figures show serogroup Y accounts for 15% of N. meningitidis isolates, is invasive in 79% of cases (CSF, eye or blood culture), and affects older adults mean 66 years of age (range 1-89) and female > male (16F:8M). Serogroup Y is only rarely implicated in epiglottitis, with only a handful of cases previously reported.",

Whilst emergency services worked to free him, he became submerged underwater. Aim(s)/Objective(s): On arrival to hospital he had severe respiratory compromise requiring endotracheal intubation. Computer tomography revealed bilateral alveolar opacities with air bronchograms suggestive of aspiration. Bronchial washings were obtained and piperacillin-tazobactam was commenced empirically. A beta-haemolytic oxidase-positive Gram-negative organism grew on blood agar after 24 hours. Biochemical identification confirmed the organism was Aeromonas hydrophilia; the isolate tested resistant to piperacillintazobactam and sensitive to ciprofloxacin and meropenem. Method(s): After review on Intensive Care by the Microbiologist, piperacillin-tazobactam was switched to intravenous ciprofloxacin. The patient deteriorated with respiratory failure, sepsis and diarrhoea. Meropenem was added after repeat bronchial washings. A mould grew on blood and Sabouraud agar, identified by microscopy as Aspergillus fumigatus. Results: Voriconazole was commenced and within 72 hours he had significantly improved. However profuse watery diarrhoea continued. Auramine staining of a stool sample revealed Cryptosporidium cysts, later identified as Cryptosporidium hominis. Following continued improvement, he completed fourteen day courses of meropenem, ciprofloxacin and voriconazole. His diarrhoea slowly settled and he was discharged home a week later. Discussion and/or Conclusion(s): The mechanism of the trauma in this case led to several water-borne infections. In reported literature on near-drowning, Aeromonas species is the commonest cause of earlyonset pneumonia. Pseudoallescheria boydii is the commonest fungal infection, usually with a delayed presentation. Aspergillus infection has been reported in a small number of cases and usually has a poor prognosis. Background: A 47 year old man presented with progressive weight loss, lymphadenopathy, back pain, visual disturbance, myoclonus and poor memory. Aim(s)/Objective(s): Due to progressive physical deterioration the patient was admitted for investigation. A number of differentials were considered including malignancy, lymphoma and sarcoidosis. On examination he was cachectic with palpable inguinal lymph nodes. Neurological examination revealed myoclonic jerks of the arm and reduced upwards gaze but normal power and reflexes. The patient complained of ocular pain, photophobia and floaters in the vision. Examination of the eyes revealed a non-descript intermediate uveitis. Method(s) : Numerous investigations were performed including an upper gastrointestinal endoscopy and biopsy. Histology of the duodenal biopsy showed features highly suggestive of Whipple's disease. Fixed paraffin curls from the duodenal biopsy were positive for Tropheryma whipplei by 16S rRNA PCR. PCR of CSF was also weakly positive. Results: The patient was treated with 2 weeks of intravenous cotrimoxazole due to penicillin allergy, then oral co-trimoxazole planned for at least 1 year. His symptoms started improving and weight increased by day 10 of treatment. Discussion and/or Conclusion(s): Whipple's disease is extremely rare and difficult to recognise. This patient fit the characteristic demographics being a middle-aged Caucasian male. He did not complain of diarrhoea, the most common feature of Whipple's disease, but this may have been masked by opioids taken for back pain. His neurological and ocular symptoms are recognised but rarer features of Whipple's disease. This case highlights the importance of taking appropriate biopsy samples, clinical awareness of Whipple's disease and identifying pathognomonic features on histology.",

            "text": "Aneeka Chavda, Poonam Kapila, Abhinav Kumar. Sherwood Forest Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, King's Mill Hospital Background: We report a case of a 55 year old Turkish male with a background of ulcerative colitis who presented with a two week history of increasing shortness of breath. He progressively deteriorated despite being treated with broad spectrum antibiotics and unfortunately died. Evidence of phagocytosis on blood film along with high serum ferritin (14,519 microgram/mL) and multi organ failure led to diagnosis of haemophagocytic syndrome (HPS). Four days after his death, the respiratory samples tested positive for Mycobacterium tuberculosis. HPS due to Mycobacterium tuberculosis is uncommon and only a handful of cases have been reported predominantly in the immunocompromised. 1 HPS is an aggressive and life-threatening syndrome of excessive immune activation; the excessive inflammation is thought to be caused by a lack of normal down regulation of activated macrophages and lymphocytes. 2 Infection is a common trigger, both in those with a genetic predisposition and in sporadic cases. Prompt initiation of treatment is essential for the survival of affected patients. Often the greatest barrier to a successful outcome is a delay in diagnosis, which is difficult because of the rarity of this syndrome, the variable clinical presentation and the lack of specificity of the clinical and laboratory findings. 1 Between 1300 and 1800 malaria cases are reported each year in the UK, although it is estimated this only represents 65% of the total number of cases. 2 Post malaria neurological syndrome (PMNS) is a rare complication of severe malaria with a prevalence of 1.2 per 1000 in those treated for Plasmodium falciparum Malaria (PFM). 3 It is more common in severe malaria than uncomplicated malaria and has been associated with the use of mefloquine in malaria treatment. 3 Discussion and/or Conclusion(s): We present a 67 year old Caucasian male returning from The Gambia with severe PFM, having not taken antimalarial chemoprophylaxis. He was treated with intravenous artesunate at a tertiary referral centre but required intubation, ventilation and haemofiltration. Following primary treatment and improvement he subsequently deteriorated, developing generalised weakness and increasingly confusion with a reduced Glasgow Coma Score (GCS). After extensive investigation and exclusion of alternative causes PMNS was diagnosed. He was treated with IV hydrocortisone due to his depressed GCS and absence of any contra-indications. He made a rapid clinical improvement and was discharged without neurological impairment. We explore the decisions leading to the use of corticosteroids in this case and similar presentations reported in the literature. Background: A 71-year-old man developed symptoms of systemic infection and generalised body aches five weeks following a transurethral resection of prostate (TURP) for previous retention of urine. Blood and urine cultured Morganella species. He was treated accordingly with piperacillin/tazobactam for one week. Good clinical response was observed but ongoing symptoms, now predominantly lower back pain, necessitated a second admission. Although there was no systemic sepsis and inflammatory markers remained normal, a magnetic resonance imaging of the spine confirmed a discitis at the level of his L2 vertebra. Biopsy/aspiration of the spine was not pursued to avoid delay in the initiation of antimicrobial treatment and our patient made a full recovery of symptoms with ertapenem for 6 weeks, and a repeat MRI nine months following the onset confirmed complete resolution of discitis. Discussion and/or Conclusion(s): Bacteraemia following urological intervention is not unusual, especially for those who had previous instrumentation and indwelling catheters, which predispose colonisation of bacteria in the lower urothelial tract. Patients presenting with urosepsis associated with non-specific symptoms following urological procedures need prompt symptom specific investigations to diagnose uncommon manifestations of bacteraemia in order to avoid delay in treatment and to improve prognosis. It would also be reasonable to monitor the patients if symptoms are unusual and lingering. In the era of aging population needing more urological interventions alongside increasing antibiotic resistance we are likely to see a greater incidences of Gram negative sepsis following urological intervention and clinicians need to be vigilant in the diagnosis and treatment of complications. Results: His lactate was 6.6 mmol/L on admission and the blood culture grew gram negative bacilli. CT scan and Ultra sound scan did not suggest any suspicious lesions. He went on to develop multi organ failure with disseminated intra vascular coagulation, acute liver failure and atrial fibrillation. It was noted in the Intensive Care unit that he had a right index finger abrasion with black margins and was confirmed by the patient as a dog bite injury before the onset of his illness. Discussion and/or Conclusion(s): An overwhelming post splenectomy infection (OPSI) is rare and associated with a high mortality rate (40-70%). The most common organisms are encapsulated organisms such as Streptococcus pneumoniae (50-90%), Nisseria meningitides, Hemophilius influenzae and Streptococcus pyogens (25%). Capnocytophaga canimorsus is a commensal gram negative bacterium present in the saliva of dogs and this case informs us to consider Capnocytophaga canimorsus as an infective organism in association with dog bite injury. The diagnosis was made as septic shock from possible Capnocytophaga canimoris organism.",

GBS meningitis must not be considered exclusive to the peripartum infectious period or to patients with co-morbid illnesses 3. Further research is required to characterise any genetic predisposition to both bacterial and viral CNS infections. Reference Background: Case: 29 year old Pakistani lady who presented at 26 weeks gestation with 1 week history of acute fever of unknown origin and PV bleeding. She was initially diagnosed with chorio-amnionitis and delivered prematurely at 27 weeks via caesarian section for foetal distress. Two days later she deteriorated with hypoxia, respiratory distress, ground glass changes on CT Chest, confusion and high protein, low glucose and lymphocytes on CSF analysis. She was transferred to ITU and the baby to the neonatal unit. Discussion: Empirical treatment was started for listeria, TB, bacterial and viral CNS infection. TB was later identified on CSF PCR and eventually cultured from sputum, urine and CSF, consistent with miliary TB (defined as progressive, widely disseminated haematogenous TB). TB is one of the great chameleons of the ID world, and can be notoriously difficult to diagnose with unique diagnostic challenges present in pregnancy and in the neonate. Diagnosis during pregnancy affords opportunity for specific testing at birth to determine risk of vertical transmission. Congenital TB most commonly presents approximately 24 days after delivery. We suggest the following: prophylaxis should be initiated at birth with full investigation to exclude neonatal TB. All available samples should be cultured, including gastric lavage, mother's placenta and endometrial samples. If TB is confirmed then the baby should be fully treated for TB.",

Apart from reporting a severe anaphylactic allergy to penicillin, her past medical history was unremarkable. MRI showed destruction of C5 and C6 as well as a partially liquefied pre-vertebral soft tissue mass compressing the cord for which she had emergency anterior cervical decompression and reconstruction surgery. Due to her penicillin allergy, and need to penetrate biofilm, an empirical combination of intravenous vancomycin, clindamycin and oral rifampicin was commenced, later changed to clindamycin and rifampicin when S. pneumoniae was isolated from tissues removed at operation. The isolates were sensitive to penicillin clindamycin, rifampicin and daptomycin. Shortly afterwards, development of a maculopapular rash attributed to clindamycin necessitated changing to oral rifampicin and intravenous daptomycin, both continued for 3 months as an outpatient from which she recovered well. The pneumococcus was serotyped as serotype 6C and is not currently covered by any of the available conjugate vaccines. The recognition of this emerging serotype raises the question as to whether or not the current pneumococcal vaccines need to be developed to include emerging strains such as this.

A 53 year-old previously fit and well gentleman was admitted generally unwell and pyrexial with an aortic murmur and visual loss secondary to panuveitis. Results: Trans-oesophageal echocardiogram showed evidence of aortic valve endocarditis. Five sets of blood cultures grew Streptococcus pneumoniae. Vitreous humour cultures showed no growth. Discussion and/or Conclusion(s): He was treated with intravenous vancomycin and gentamicin, changed to intravenous benzylpenicillin after 2 days with sensitivities.

Infective endocarditis due to Streptococcus pneumoniae mainly affects individuals without a previous cardiac history. It predominantly affects the aortic valve as in this case. Pneumococcal endocarditis is often associated with endophthalmitis and meningitis (Austrian syndrome). Our patient did develop endophthalmitis but there were no signs or symptoms of meningitis, and thus a lumbar puncture was not performed.

Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust Background: A 35 year old man who injected drugs presented to A&E with a painful thigh and double vision. He was admitted under surgery and had incision and drainage of a thigh abscess and received flucloxacillin. He underwent CT head to assess the double vision; this was normal. Over the next 48 hours, he continued to complain of double vision. He was haemodynamically stable and apyrexial. He went on to develop dysphonia, dysphagia and stridor. He was referred to Infectious Diseases and on review, he had bilateral ptosis, ophthalmoparesis, non-reactive pupils, dysarthria and flaccid paralysis of the neck, facial muscles and tongue. Results: A clinical diagnosis of wound botulism was made and the patient was transferred to intensive care, where he received anti-toxin and was intubated. He had further debridement and received penicillin and metronidazole. He made good neurological recovery, with mild diplopia at discharge after 18 days. Culture of pus and tissue from the debridement confirmed Clostridium botulinum (type B). Discussion and/or Conclusion(s): Wound botulism is a rare diagnosis, but well recognised in people who inject drugs (PWID).

Infection in human is occupational related occuring as a result of contact with animals and their products and waste. Human infection can be a mild cutaneous infection known as erysepeloid. Diffuse cutaneous form and a serious although rare complications with septicaemia and endocarditis have been reported. Aim(s)/Objective(s): Clinical case review Method(s): We report a 74 year old female patient who was diagnosed with infective endocarditis caused by Erysepelothrix rhusiopathiae. She presented with a history of being unwell on and off, febrile and lethargic for 6 weeks. She was anaemic and had temperature and a pan systolic mumur on examination. Results: Echocardiography showed abnormal mitral valve leaflets with vegetation and possible perforation of the anterior leaflet and vegetation on the aortic valve. She was empirically started on intravenous amoxicillin & gentamicin after taking the blood cultures. Blood cultures isolated a gram positive bacilli which was resistant to vancomycin. The organism was identified as Erysepelothrix rhusiopathiae by VITEK and confirmed by the Reference Laboratory. She was treated with high dose intravenous Benzyl penicillin for 4 weeks with a good outcome with no valve replacement. No epidemiological risk factors found on this patient. She had no history of penicillin allergy. Discussion and/or Conclusion(s): Rapid identification of Erysepelothrix rhusiopathiae from other gram positive organisms is critical in the appropriate management of infective endocarditis especially if the patient has a history of penicillin allergy. Background: Neisseria meningitidis is a rare but important cause of meningitis and septicaemia. Invasive meningococcal disease is associated with significant morbidity and mortality, with the highest incidence of infection being seen in children (aged <5 years) and younger adults (aged 16-25 years). Nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea are well-documented symptoms of meningococcal infection however presentation with predominantly gastrointestinal symptoms is rare, being recently described in the 2015 UK outbreak. The unusual presentation with diarrhoea was associated with Group W N. meningitidis in teenagers, which progressed to severe disease. To date only one case of fulminant meningococcemia associated with the primary presentation of gastroenteritis has been reported in an elderly patient. Aim(s)/Objective(s): We report two cases of group B invasive meningococcal disease in elderly patients who presented with primarily gastrointestinal symptoms. Results: In both cases, the patient had presented with an acute history of vomiting, diarrhoea and fever. One patient remained haemodynamically stable requiring minimal support, the other who had multiple comorbidities presented in septic shock requiring ITU support. Neither patient exhibited any other focus of infection and had no evidence of CNS infection. Both patients had blood cultures taken on admission that were positive for N. meningitidis, later being identified as group B by molecular testing. Both patients were treated with IV Ceftriaxone 2 g BD for 7 days and made a good recovery being discharged home. Discussion and/or Conclusion(s): Clinical manifestations of invasive meningococcal disease can vary. It is important as clinicians to be aware of atypical presentations to ensure prompt diagnosis and effective treatment.",

Results: We present a rare case of mixed MTB and NTM infection where the rapid Cepheid GeneXpert \u00ae MTB/RIF polymerase chain reaction (PCR) on a primary sputum sample helped confirm a clinical diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis infection and directed the laboratory to carefully examine the culture isolates which ultimately confirmed the presence of both MTB and NTM. Discussion and/or Conclusion(s): This case illustrates the utility of rapid molecular testing for MTB on a primary clinical sample that benefitted both the clinician and laboratory in resolving a diagnostic conundrum.",

NHS Lothian A 12-year old male was referred plastics by a neighbouring Trust's emergency room after sustaining an avulsion injury of his left lateral thigh while zip-lining in the forest. The wound had both skin and fat necrosis with underlying infected haematoma. Immediate washout and debridement was undertaken with samples of tissue, swabs and fluid sent to microbiology lab for microscopy, culture and sensitivity and vacuum pump applied. The samples isolated Staphylococcus aureus as well as two Clostridiaone identified as a C. sordellii and the other as C. botulinum using API32both sensitive to metronidazole and co-amoxiclav. Public Health England Reference laboratory did not detect Clostridium botulinum neurotoxin A,B,E or F and both Maldi-TOF and 16s PCR confirmed the isolate as a C. sporogenes, a non-toxin forming Clostridium species which can be identified as C. botulinum using API32. The patient improved, had a skin graft and was sent home within 12 days. Clostridial wound infections after penetrating trauma are potentially deadly if not immediately debrided and appropriate antibiotics given. Initial management must include surgical debridement and antibiotic therapy. If neurological symptoms had developed it is crucial to have a supply of antitoxin and intensive care facilities available. It is also vital to engage reference laboratories in the identification of clinically significant isolates.",

York Teaching Hospital Background: Capnocytophaga canimorsus is a slow growing, Gram negative bacillus that is a normal commensal of the dog oral cavity. Human infection is uncommon but may be severe, even in immunocompetent individuals, and is strongly associated with dog exposure or bite. Aim(s)/Objective(s): We report a case of fulminant sepsis due to C. canimorsus in an immunocompetent patient and aim to increase awareness of this potentially fatal pathogen. Method(s): A previously well 44-year-old male arrived in A&E by ambulance with an 18-hour history of diarrhoea, vomiting and sweating. On arrival he was tachypnoeic, tachycardic and hypotensive, with a petechial/pupuric rash on his upper body and lactate 13.5 mmol/L. He received cefotaxime for potential meningococcal sepsis within 15 minutes of arrival and subsequent doses of piperacillin-tazobactam, linezolid, gentamicin and human normal immunoglobulin. Despite intensive supportive treatment, he died 8 hours after arrival at hospital. Results: The anaerobic bottle of admission blood cultures signalled positive after 28 hours incubation with Gram negative bacilli seen. The organism failed to grow, but C. canimorsus DNA was detected by 16S PCR. Review of hospital records revealed an A&E attendance in 2013 for a bite from his own dog. Discussion and/or Conclusion(s): Infection with C. canimorsus most commonly manifests as systemic sepsis and can be indistinguishable from meningococcal disease. It is usually susceptible to first-line antimicrobials for severe sepsis, including third-generation cephalosporins and piperacillin-tazobactam, but may produce extended spectrum beta-lactamases. It is likely that empiric antimicrobial therapy was adequate in this case, but the patient succumbed to irreversible multi-organ failure and disseminated intravascular coagulation.",

She denied fever or any other symptoms. No h/o recent travel or contact. On examination, she was afebrile with stable haemodynamics and normal JVP. There were no audible murmurs or pericardial rub. Blood tests revealed raised inflammatory markers with evidence of AKI and raised cardiac enzymes. The ECG showed diffuse ST elevation in chest leads. Chest x-day showed clear lung fields but minimally enlarged cardiac silhouette. Patient was treated for STEMI and transferred for PCI. Method(s) : On arrival at the tertiary care hospital, the dyspnoea had significantly worsened with haemodynamic instability. Blood biochemistry revealed worsening LFT, cardiac enzymes and AKI. Auscultation of chest revealed muffled heart sounds with tachycardia but no murmurs. Coronary angiogram was normal. Echocardiogram showed a 5 cms thick collection in the pericardial sac. As patient was symptomatic, pericardiocentesis was performed. 300 mL pus aspirated via a pig tail drain. I.v. piperacillin-tazobactam 4.5 g b.d. was commenced after collecting blood culture. Results: The biochemical analysis of the pericardial fluid revealed normal protein, very low glucose and raised LDH. Microscopy of the pericardial fluid showed 2 + polymorphs while the Gram stain showed Gram-negative cocci. Hence antibiotic switched to 2 g of i.v. ceftriaxone. Patient was clinically stable on day 2 while blood parameters improved gradually over next 7 days. The blood cultures did not isolate any organism. Patient underwent surgical pericardiectomy and discharged home after completing total 8 weeks antibiotic therapy.",

            "text": "Background: A 72 year old caucasian male presented with a 3 days of increasing back pain. He had a past medical history of bladder calculi and excess alcohol intake. He reported no foreign travel history and no significant animal or occupational exposures. After admission the patient became confused and feverish, and was treated with 5 days of co-amoxiclav. This was escalated to piperacillin-tazobactam due to persisting fever. An MRI spine showed multi-level lumbar discitis and a psoas abscess. A transthoracic echocardiogram demonstrated a mitral valve lesion with severe mitral regurgitation. Blood cultures during admission were negative, but were taken on antibiotic treatment. Urine microscopy did not indicate infection. Serology for coxiella and brucella was eventually negative. The patient switched treatment to IV vancomycin and IV gentamicin, and was transferred to the local cardiothoracic surgery unit for assessment. The patient underwent valve replacement, and the excised valve was sent for microscopy and culture. The gram stain showed gram positive cocci. Staphylococcus epidermidis was grown from broth cultures but direct cultures were negative. This was not felt to be consistent with the patient's presentation and the valve was referred for 16s PCR. This was positive for Aerococcus urinae. Aerococci are a rare cause of endocarditis, and endocarditis with spinal infection has only been reported in one case of which we are aware. This provided a unifying diagnosis for the patient given his risk factors of bladder calculi, male gender and age. The patient responded to 4 weeks of treatment with Benzypenicillin and gentamicin. The purpose of this study was reviewing the incidence of UTIs after SPC insertion, to note the most common MSU result in patients with UTIs and to notice the relation between rate of UTIs and demographical factors and length of time between the injury and the SPC insertion. Method(s): A retrospective study of SCI patients that had supra pubic catheter insertion in 2015 was conducted at the National Spinal Injury Centre. Data were collected from electronic medical records. For statistical analysis Minitab 14 was used. Results: 64 patients were identified. Mean age was 60.5. The incidence of UTIs was 23% (15 out of 64). All the patients had prophylactic antibiotic. 12 patients with UTIs had midstream specimen of urine (MSU) collected. 7 patients had MSU sent after antibiotic commenced. Mixed growth was the most common MSU result. 43 procedures were done during the first admission to the spinal centre. Time from the injury was on average 5 months. No statistical association between occurrence of UTI and age, sex, and time from the injury. Discussion and/or Conclusion(s): MSU collection pre antibiotic treatment is good practice and it should be a rule to limit the use of wide spectrum antibiotics. Culture tests are futile if taken after antibiotic therapy. UTIs was common in the population examined even using prophylactic antibiotic treatment. Future research should look at the prophylactic antibiotic use and effectiveness. Background: Enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) are a leading cause of infantile diarrhea. At present, E. coli populations are structured in seven major phylogenetic groups. Strains responsible for extraintestinal infection belong to phylogroups B2 or D than A or B1. Phylogroups E and F contain strains, of which O157:H7 is the best known member, and form a sister group to phylo-group B2 respectively. The phylogroup C is closely related but distinct from phylo-group B1. Aim(s)/Objective(s): The aim of this study was to gain insight on the distribution of phylotypes in enteropathogenic Escherichia coli virulence genes and their association with clinical characteristics in children under five years of age suffering from diarrhea in Delhi, India. Method(s): 80 diarrheagenic E. coli strains were isolated from children with diarrhea and examined for the presence of enteropathogenic E. coli by real time PCR after performing antibiotic susceptibility testing. A quadruplex PCR was performed to distribute isolates among seven phylogroups as described by Clermont et al, 2013. Statistical analysis was used for the comparison of the categorical data. Results: 64 (80%) were found to be EPEC. There was predominance of phylogenetic group A (38) followed by phylogenetic groups B1 (14), D (4), F (3), B2 (2), C (2) and E (1). One isolate remain unclassified. In silico studies was performed to understand their relationships. Background: Little is known about the use of antibiotics and the extent of antibiotic associated diarrhoea (AAD) in spinal cord injuries (SCI) patients. Aim(s)/Objective(s): The study aim was to (i) record the use of antibiotics; (ii) establish the prevalence of AAD and; (iii) assess if there is any seasonal variation with respect to antibiotic use and incidence of AAD. Method(s): A retrospective study was conducted in three British SCI centres during October 2014 to June 2015. Data was collected using a standardised questionnaire. We define AAD as 2 or more watery stools type 5, 6 or 7 (Bristol stool scale) over 24 hours. Results: Six-hundred-and-twenty-five adults (median age: 55 years, 31.5% female) with SCI (54.4% tetraplegia; 39.3% complete SCI) were included. Of 124 (19.8%) patients on antibiotics, the top three indications for antibiotics were urinary-tract infections, skin-infections and pressure ulcers infection. Twenty-one of 124 (16.9%) developed AAD. No statistical difference was observed on number of antibiotics, severity of SCI, use of proton-pump-inhibitors and H 2 -blockers and use of laxatives in both groups. AAD was more common in the summer season when compared to spring, autumn and winter. (32.3%, 6.9%, 16%, 16.1%, p = 0.04). AAD was associated with older adults ( p < 0.01); tetraplegia ( p < 0.01); hypoalbuminaemia ( p = 0.02) and elevated body-mass-index ( p = 0.02). Urinary-tract-infection was more common during the autumn season ( p < 0.01).",

Background: Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) is known to form a biofilm and colonize on damaged skin of the hands. Aim(s)/Objective(s): We investigated changes in the quantity of S. aureus on the hands and changes in skin damage when using a hand-cleansing formulation with potassium oleate but without a sanitizer (Formulation A), which is highly effective in removing S. aureus biofilm and causes minimal skin damage. Design: Prospective, crossover, double-blind commissioning test. Setting and participants: This study included 14 medical staff members at Geriatric Health Services Facility \"Cosmos\". Intervention: The participants used two types of hand-cleansing formulations (Formulations A and B), each for 4 weeks. S. aureus of the hands was cultured from swab samples on agar plates. Surface Evaluation of scaliness (SEsc), an indicator of scaliness and dryness of keratin, was measured using a UV-microscope as a marker of skin damage. Results: The quantity of S. aureus after using Formulation A for 4 weeks was 10 1.08\u00b10.05 colony-forming units (CFU)/mL, a statistically significant decrease from the quantity of S. aureus (10 1.59\u00b10.19 CFU/mL) just before use (P = 0.029). Additionally, the SEsc after using Formulation A for 2 weeks (2.02 \u00b1 0.59) was significantly lower than the SEsc 2 weeks before use (2.85 \u00b1 0.48) (P = 0.042). With Formulation B, the quantity of S. aureus and the SEsc did not significantly change from before to after use (P > 0.05).",

Demographic, clinical, diagnostic and therapeutic data that contributed to therapeutic decision making were collected from hospital information system. Results: We identified 28 patients with a positive result: 27 were immunosuppressed, 1 unknown; 27 had abnormal chest radiology (CT or chest radiograph) with 8 mentioning PCP; samples from four of 19 patients sent for Grocott staining were positive. Twelve of 28 patients started treatment before sample collection (median 2 days; range 1-7 days), 1 was on prophylaxis. Two were treated after sample collection before the result. Following the positive result, 14 continued treatment, 9 started treatment and one prophylaxis. Twenty of 23 patients received \u226521 days of treatment. Three of the treated patients died during the hospital admission, 2 were discharged but died within 90 days from admission. The remaining 18 treated patients and all untreated patients survived over 90 days from admission.

National guidance is available to inform management and this has been translated to local guidelines within Pennine Acute Hospitals NHS Trust. Aim(s)/Objective(s): The aim of this project was to evaluate local compliance with both national and local standards and to improve service as highlighted. Method(s): An audit was conducted of all hospital acquired toxin positive C. difficile cases (\u226572 hours post admission) between 1st January 2015 and 31st December 2015 which totalled 54 patients. Audit standards evaluated severity assessment, MDT involvement, appropriate treatment, monitoring, escalation and stopping of inappropriate antibiotics/proton pump inhibitor therapy. Data was taken from patient notes, infection control notes, the electronic prescribing system and microbiology documentation. Results: The audit demonstrated that an MDT approach is in place with good communication of results and infection control liaison. There was also evidence to support that patients were being regularly reassessed and concomitant use of broad spectrum antibiotics reviewed. The vast majority of patients (69%) were commenced on oral vancomycin. Mortality outcomes from the audit were comparable to national standards. Areas for improvement include documentation of initial assessment and severity stratification both in clinical and microbiology notes. 26% of patient could not be assessed for severity which could potentially have led to under or over treatment. Discussion and/or Conclusion(s): Actions from this audit have focused on increased education to clinicians and involvement around initial assessment, therapy choices and documentation. New guidelines have been initiated and supportive assessment tools developed ahead of a planned reaudit in 2016-17.",

Results: Blood culture timing could not be commented on 23(57%) patients due to the delayed suspicion of Infective endocarditis in this group, as echocardiography was advised by Microbiologists following positive blood cultures. Out of 40 patients, 12(30%) were found to have Streptococcal species causing endocarditis. Enterococcal species were found in 8 (20%) patients. Six patients had Staphylococcus aureus, 1 patient had MRSA, 1 had Staph epidermidis and one patient had Candida albicans. 4 patients were found to have unusual pathogens (Erysephalothix rusipathiae, Haemphilus parainfluenzae, Eschericia coli, and Citrobacter spp). 7 patients were found to have culture negative Infective endocarditis. Prior antibiotic therapy and inappropriate timing of blood cultures was the most probable reason for a 5 cases of culture negative endocarditis. Discussion and/or Conclusion(s): Good clinical assessment and consideration of risk factors and taking 3 sets of blood cultures at appropriate time is the key for the diagnosis of Infective endocarditis and its appropriate management. Background: A previous audit showed 15% of patients who presented to Charing Cross adult A&E were diagnosed with a urinary tract infection (UTI). Criteria for diagnosis varied and 47% of patients had a urine culture sent without clear clinical indication. Public Health England provides primary care guidance on UTI diagnosis. This study looked at using this guidance, with the addition of fever and confusion as symptoms which may also present when patients attend hospital, to ensure samples are sent appropriately. Aim(s)/Objective(s): To improve investigation and diagnosis of UTI in A&E.",

Symptoms and antimicrobial therapy were recorded for all patients who had a sample sent for two weeks pre and post introduction from electronic medical records. Results: The number of samples sent decreased from 714 to 378 following introduction of guidance. The proportion of patients who had a urine sent with one or no symptoms of UTI fell from 64% to 45%. The proportion of samples with no growth or no significant growth fell from 39% to 24%. Pre-intervention, 34 patients with no symptoms had growth in their urine (asymptomatic bacteriuria). Of these, 10% were commenced on antibiotics. This decreased to 22 patients asymptomatic bacteriuria and 1 received antibiotics. Discussion and/or Conclusion(s): Introduction of guidance has led to fewer samples sent for culture and decreased the proportion with no growth. It has also decreased the number of patients receiving inappropriate antibiotics for asymptomatic bacteriuria. Results: A. schaalii isolates were identified from 14 patients, mean age 70 years (range 46-92). The commonest source of infection was urinary; 5 patients had bacteraemia secondary to urosepsis and 5 had positive kidney urine or bladder biopsy cultures. Four presented with scrotal abscess, breast abscess, necrotising otitis externa and pacemaker pocket infection. Some isolates were assessed as clinically insignificant. Patients who were given antibiotics received empirical piperacillin/ tazobactam or co-amoxiclav, to which all isolates were susceptible. 12 patients were discharged; 2 patients with bacteraemia received piperacillin/tazobactam but died shortly afterwards. Discussion and/or Conclusion(s): Our findings support the role of A. schaalii in urinary infection and bacteraemia, particularly in elderly patients with urological abnormalities. Its clinical significance is less clear in other infections. Formal identification is advised to prevent its misclassification as a contaminant in blood and urine cultures and to improve the understanding of its pathogenic potential.",

There have been only six previously reported cases worldwide. To our knowledge, these are the only two UK cases and maybe the largest case series of L. maceachernii ever reported. Results: Patient one presented in September 2014 with severe pneumonia and a previously undiagnosed, underlying lymphoproliferative disorder. The patient died of this infection eight days later. Patient two presented in November 2015; a renal transplant patient with cough and diarrhoea. A CT scan showed right basal pneumonia. The patient died eight weeks later with respiratory failure caused by infections including Legionella. Neither case had travelled during the typical Legionellosis incubation period. In both cases Legionella spp. was detected by in-house qPCR as part of initial respiratory screen. Thereafter confirmed as L. maceachernii at the Scottish National Reference laboratory. Levofloxacin was used as the core treatment. In the UK, Legionellosis is a notifiable disease. Lothian health protection team investigated both cases but no clear source was identified from multiple environmental samples. No household members developed infection. Discussion and/or Conclusion(s): L. maceachernii may be an emerging cause of legionellosis. Diagnosis is dependant on the use of PCR and culture as routine urinary antigen testing and serology do not detect this species. No clear link was established between the two cases despite both living within Lothian region and no clear environmental exposure was identified. These two cases (and previous case reports) suggest L. maceachernii is associated with a high mortality, particularly in the immunosuppressed.",

            "text": "Background: Meningitis can occur in children with 'normal' CSF microscopy. Nevertheless, decisions to treat for bacterial meningitis will often be based on an 'elevated' CSF white cell count (WCC) response. Typically 'normal' CSF WCCs consist of lymphocytes and not neutrophils. CSF WCCs are also higher in normal term infants, compared to older children, though fall rapidly after the first few weeks of life. Aim(s)/Objective(s): To establish reference ranges for CSF cell counts for routine reporting from a microbiology department in a specialist paediatric hospital. Method(s): We review the interpretative guidance from NICE and PHE for what constitutes a normal CSF WCC in children. The NICE clinical guidance document CG102 (\"Meningitis (bacterial) and meningococcal speticaemia in uder 16s: recognition, diagnosis and management\"; 2010 updated 2015) was compared and contrasted to the PHE UK Standard for Microbiology Investigation B27 (\"Investigation of Cerebrospinal Fluid\"; issue 6, 2015). Results: In neonates, NICE suggests treatment for bacterial meningitis if the CSF WCC is at least 20/mm 3 but does not comment on the expected number of neutrophils. In older children, >5 WCC/mm 3 or >1 neutrophil/mm 3 is considered abnormal. PHE guidance uses the following age related CSF WCC ranges/mm 3 neonates 0-30, 1-4 years 0-20, 5 years to puberty 0-10, adults 0-5, but makes no comment on the significance of the neutrophil count. Results: A total of 52 patients with CPO were identified (60% male, mean age 65). In-patient hospital stay in the past year was documented for 33 patients; abroad (n = 16), UK (n = 13), both (n = 4). 27 patients (52%) had positive clinical samples and 19 (37%) were treated for infection including; urinary tract (n = 4), pneumonia (n = 3), intraabdominal (n = 3), intra-abdominal and pneumonia (n = 3), blood stream (n = 2), and osteomyelitis (n = 2). After multivariate analysis, having CPO isolated from clinical samples was associated with infection (OR = 11.86, 95%CI: 1.47-95.46, p = 0.020). The overall 30-day mortality rate was 16% from first positive sample, and in those treated for infection, 42% from the start of treatment. All eight deaths occurred in patients with a history of hospitalisation within the previous 12 months but this association did not reach statistical significance ( p = 0.79). Discussion and/or Conclusion(s): Patients with CPO are at risk of infection with high mortality.

Some bacteria acquire antimicrobial resistance against a range of antibiotics, which has created a serious concern to the public health. Therefore, it is vital for health professionals to recognize the presences of antibiotic-resistant organisms and to take appropriate actions where required. Aim(s)/Objective(s): The purpose of this study is to estimate the prevalence of antibiotic-resistant organisms -ESBL (Extended Spectrum Beta-Lactamase producers), C. difficile, VRE (Vancomycin-Resistant Enterococci) and MRSA (Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus) isolated in stool samples of both in-patients and the community, and calculate %carriage of each resistant organism within the two groups. Method(s): 200 diarrheal stool samples from both inpatients and the community were collected and cultured.. The bacterial growth in the cultured samples were identified and recorded after 24 and 48 hours of incubation. Results: 25% of samples were positive for Gram negative bacilli resistant organisms; 2% were positive for VRE; 4% were positive for C. difficile; 0.5% were positive for MRSA. Discussion and/or Conclusion(s): The prevalence of ESBL found in this study showed an increasing trend compared to the results of previous studies and the amount of VRE found was lower. The % carriage of C. difficile was found higher compared to the values in the past. Only 0.5% was found to be MRSA positive, which is consistent with the decreasing trend suggested in other reports.",

Method(s): Aggregometer was used to measure the effect of S. aureus PSM\u03b13 on platelet aggregation. Flow cytometry was used to measure the effect of S. aureus PSM\u03b13 on affinity of integrin \u03b1IIb\u03b23 to fibrinogen and exposure of P-selectin on surface of platelets.

The level of fibrinogen binding to integrin \u03b1IIb\u03b23 was significantly reduced in response to thrombin or CRP-XL due to presence of S. aureus PSM\u03b13 and exposure of P-selectin on the surface of platelets was also reduced. This indicates that platelet fail to activate and recruit other platelets. S. aureus PSM\u03b13 induced VASP phosphorylation in human platelets at residue Ser157. Discussion and/or Conclusion(s): The experimental data from this study show that S. aureus PSM\u03b13 toxin to be an inhibitor of platelet activation. This inhibition due to increasing the levels of cAMP that activate the PKA that prevents any further platelet activation. Results: 30 adults tested positive for Mycoplasma. 60% (18/30) were male, mean age was 45 years (21-82). 43% had an underlying chest comorbidity or were immunocompromised. Commonest presenting symptoms were cough (93%), fevers (93%), sputum production (79%) and shortness of breath (66%). The mean peak WBC count was 10 \u00d710 9 /L, CRP 161 mg/L and ALT 142 IU/L. 85% (22/26) patients had abnormal chest X-rays. 87% (26/30) received an initial antibiotic effective against mycoplasma. After PCR result, use of beta-lactams fell from 16 to 6 whilst tetracycline monotherapy rose from 6 to 15 patients. Mean length of hospital stay was 5 days. 47% (14/30) were tested for antibody titre. 3/14 had negative serology but these were all tested within 8 days of symptom onset. Discussion and/or Conclusion(s): Our cohort were predominantly young, male patients presenting with LRTI symptoms. It included patients with erythema multiforme major, myocarditis and acute delirium, which are all recognised phenomena associated with mycoplasma. Most patients received initial antibiotics effective against mycoplasma and many had treatment rationalised following PCR result suggesting that testing changed practice. Introduction: The Streptococcus bovis group has an association with endocarditis and gastro-intestinal tract malignancy. This association is strongest with S. gallolyticus subspecies gallolyticus previously known as S. bovis biotype I. We reviewed the clinical presentation and antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of Streptococcus bovis group blood culture isolates in NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde. Methods: Using a list generated using our LIMS system TPath we reviewed the electronic patient records of all patients who had isolated Streptococcus gallolyticus, Streptococcus lutetiensis, Streptococcus infantarius or Streptococcus pasteurianus from blood cultures. Results: We present the breakdown of specialities under which these patients were managed, whether the blood culture was monomicrobial or part of a mixed culture, whether the patient had any prosthetic material, the penicillin minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), whether a deep source was identified and mortality to date. Conclusions: Results have guided the training of medical staff locally in managing these infections and allowed us to give locally accurate information to the clinical teams when advising on isolates of these organisms. Discussion and/or Conclusion(s): Four main pathogens predominate among ophthalmological samples from a tertiary referral London eye hospital. Among these pathogens, AMR for commonly used agents is high. This epidemiology must be integrated into empiric antimicrobial prescribing decisions for this patient cohort. Furthermore, the high rates of AMR suggest sampling for culture and susceptibility from all suspected bacterial eye infections be undertaken, enabling subsequent targeting of antimicrobial therapy. Background: Sexual health clinics in Barts Health currently perform direct near-patient inoculation of selective plates for Neisseria gonorrhoeae (NG) for all suspected cases of gonorrhoea using disposable inoculation loops. The Sigma Transwab is a liquid medium transport swab which is M40-A2 compliant and comprises a cellular polyurethane foam for efficient absorption and release of the specimen. It is designed to improve the recovery of NG, allowing plate inoculation to occur centrally under controlled laboratory conditions. Aim(s)/Objective(s): To evaluate and compare the recovery of NG from the Sigma Transwab versus the conventional inoculation loop from symptomatic patients in sexual health clinics in Barts Health Trust. Method(s): 80 patients with suspected gonorrhoea had samples taken with both the Sigma Transwab and the routine disposable loop. The loop was used to inoculate a selective plate in the peripheral clinic and the Transwab was transported to the main laboratory for inoculation. Both plates were incubated in parallel and plates examined at 24 and 48 hours for culture growth. Results: 18 out of a total of 80 patient samples were culture-positive for NG. The disposable loop method picked up all 18 positive samples whilst the Transwab only picked up 9 positive cultures. All 9 positive NG cultures missed by the Transwab grew after only 24 hours. Discussion and/or Conclusion(s): The Transwab was found to be inferior to the traditional method with regards its ability to recover viable gonoccocus. Through this evaluation we were able to assess, improve and evaluate current provision of gonococcal culture as highlighted by United Kingdom Accreditation Service.",

It is commonly found in contaminated water. As pathogen it seems to mainly cause lineassociated infections. Only a few cases of skin infections caused by M. mucogenicum have been published. Aim(s)/Objective(s): Here we would like to present a case of a persistent rash with M. mucogenicum repeatedly grown from tissue samples. Method(s): The patient's consent was obtained. Results: A patient in her mid-sixties was seen by dermatology because of venous eczema and bilateral lower limb oedema. She is known to have rheumatoid arthritis. On physical examination a papular voilaceous rash on the left lower leg was noted. She reports slow progression of the rash over a two year period. The patient had been immunosuppressed due to methotrexate treatment when the rash first developed. Histopathologically, tissue taken from the rash appeared as noncaseating granulomatous inflammation. Further samples from two biopsies of the rash were sent to the reference laboratory. M. mucogenicum grew after 8 days incubation from each sample. The organism tested susceptible to amikacin, clarithromycin, doxycycline, imipenem and linezolid. Discussion and/or Conclusion(s): This finding was interpreted as clinically relevant. M. mucogenicum was found in two biopsies with a concurring clinical and histopathological picture. A prolonged course of doxycycline is planned and follow up of the patient will be under the care of the dermatology team. Non-tuberculous mycobacteria such as M. mucogenicum can cause a wide range of infections. Due to their acid-fast nature, appropriate diagnostic methods should be chosen if an infection with these organisms is a possibility. Background: A solution of HAI germs' increasing antibiotic and disinfectant resistance problem requires development and implementation of new effective approaches to pathogens destruction. Aim(s)/Objective(s): To study an effectiveness of pulsed xenon ultraviolet (UV) radiation continuous spectrum generated by 'Alfa-01' irradiating device against clinical strains of MDR bacteria's (MRSA, VRE, P. aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, K. pneumonia), \u0421. difficile spores and Mycobacterium terrae test strain. Method(s): Plastic and metal surfaces contaminated with the corresponding bacteria and \u0421. difficile spores were exposed to radiation. The initial contamination was 10 6 -10 7 . The surfaces were placed vertically and horizontally against the irradiator at 1.5-4-meters distance. The exposure time was 5 and 10 minutes for bacteria, 4, 8, 16 and 30 minutes for Mycobacteria, and 4, 8, and 16 minutes for C. difficile spores. Sheep red blood cells were used as biological burden. Results: After 5-minute treatment of horizontally and vertically aligned plastic and metal surfaces contaminated with bacterial strains (except \u0421. difficile and mycobacteria) an effective decrease of microbial count has reached from 4 lg to 7 lg. For mycobacteria and C. difficile spores on the surfaces placed vertically at 2-meter distance from the irradiator, the 100% elimination of microorganisms was achieved in 8 minutes, for 4-meter distancein 16 minutes. Discussion and/or Conclusion(s): The high efficiency of the continuous spectrum pulsed UV against all tested HAIs pathogens allows for recommending the irradiating device with pulsed xenon lamps for wide use at hospitals.",

Hospital Universitario La Fe Aim(s)/Objective(s): To assess the efficacy of chlorhexidine-impregnated wipes [Clinell-Wash \u00ae (Vesismin/Ibersurgical)] to prevent multiresistant bacteria (MRB) colonization and infection in an intensive care unit (ICU). Method(s): A prospective observational study in a 24-beds critical care unit was designed. Chlorhexidine wipes were introduced for daily washing of patients undergoing mechanical ventilation as for those patients colonized by MRB. To assess the efficacy of chlorhexidine wipes, evolution of number of patients and ICU-stays with MRB colonization were analysed during 11 months. Number of nosocomial infections compared with the equivalent period last year was analysed. Data analysis was conducted through Stata software v.13.0, using Jisquare test to compare proportions. Evolution of patient colonization over the months was evaluated using a linear regression model. Results: During the intervention period, 1835 patients were admitted to the ICU [mean age: 61.1 (SD: 15) years; APACHE II (Median (IQR): 30 (18-25)]. Following the introduction of chlorhexidine wipes, a significant reduction in the incidence of patients with MRB colonization over the months was observed (\u03b2 = \u22120.04; r2 = 0.438; p = 0.027). No significance reduction in number of ICU-stays with MRB colonization was found (r2 = 0.03; p = 0.279). A significant reduction in the overall incidence of nosocomial infection in the intervention period compared to the equivalent period last year was observed (2.23% vs 3.91%; p = 0.004). No contact dermatitis was observed in treated patients. Discussion and/or Conclusion(s): Chlorhexidine-impregnated wipes reduces the incidence of colonization and infection by MRB, appearing as a practical tool to prevent nosocomial infections in critical care units.",

Improved quality control by close monitoring of the cleaning of endoscopes can contribute to the identification of endoscope at risk for patient to patient transmission. Aim(s)/Objective(s): Demonstrate contribution of clean monitoring with Adenosine-triphosphate (ATP) bioluminescence test in the reprocessing of flexible endoscopes to the overall process quality. Method(s): The bedside flush, manual cleaning and automated endoscope reprocessing (AER) process steps of routine reprocessing of 60 clinically used gastroscopes have been monitored on six nonconsecutive days with an ATP test in a German teaching hospital. Results: The study shows an unstable cleaning outcome of the reprocessing. Although the cleaning performance of the manual cleaning and the AER was relatively stable, the study suggests that the endoscopic procedure or the effectiveness of the bedside flush drives the overall outcome of the endoscope cleaning. Influence of the condition of specific endoscopes and the invasiveness of the procedure are shown. Discussion and/or Conclusion(s): Clean monitoring of the reprocessing of flexible endoscopes with a rapid, sensitive and quantitative ATP test can help identifying endoscopes at risk to contribute to pathogen transmission and can provide immediate feedback to the operator. A systematic surveillance can provide improvement to the overall quality control of reprocessing endoscopes and helps hospitals in documenting their process quality.",

However, although this may reduce or delay the formation of biofilm, it will not prevent it. A tap capable of being easily removed from the plumbing system, and being dismantled for thermal disinfection, has been developed by Armitage Shanks. In this study the Markwik21 tap assembly was artificially contaminated with a biofilm-producing strain of P. aeruginosa and processed in a validated benchtop thermal washer disinfector (WD). Method(s): A Markwik21 tap was dismantled, each component contaminated by immersion/flushing with a suspension of the test organism, and left in a humid environment for 7 days. The components were then processed in a WD. Sampling occurred before and after disinfection to establish pre and post disinfection counts. Testing was performed in triplicate.",

ATP testing is easy to use, is a broad measure of cellular contamination, and provides a real time alternative to visual inspection. However, ATP testing is subject to variability problems that affect the interpretation and usefulness of the results. This variability includes inherent variability arising from device performance issues that causes imprecision and difficulties with the limits of quantitation. Aim(s)/Objective(s): To improve the validity of cleanliness measurements using ATP testing. Method(s): A series of experiments has defined the dynamic range of several available ATP testing systems. The performance characteristics indicated both imprecision (due to variability), limits of detection and limits of quantitation for the devices tested. Statistical methods were applied in the development of a new sampling algorithm to overcome the risks of variability in practical ATP testing. The sampling algorithm uses a three tiered, brand specific cleanliness thresholds and a cleanliness verification step to ensure that surface cleanliness is verified using a validated cleaning method based on existing aseptic techniques. Results: The results of the algorithm have indicated that the method is easy to use and provides the user a quantified, more accurate measurement of the real cleanliness status of surfaces and devices.",

In patients colonized in multiple locations (n = 44) and/or with risk factors (n = 56), the treatment was successful in respectively 54.5% and 57.1% of the patients. Most patients (81.4%) became negative after just one attempt. Overall, 67% of the carriers remained negative up to one year of follow up. Discussion and/or Conclusion(s): The success rate of MRSA decolonization is just below 70%, even with patients estimated to have a low chance of success included. Therefore, a universal rather than a targeted MRSA decolonization strategy seems to be justifiable. Method(s): Six orthopaedic flexible drill bits (FDB) were contaminated with trypic soya broth containing 5% sheep blood and Staphylococcus aureus (10 8 cells/mL), allowed to dry for 4 hours and subjected to prerinsing, manual or automated cleaning.

            "text": "Background: Clinical surfaces may become contaminated with microorganisms. Cleaning and disinfection are crucial interventions in minimising the spread of healthcare associated infections. Viable organisms have been shown to persist in dry biofilms even after terminal cleaning and disinfection. This work demonstrates the use of dry biofilm testing to investigate the efficacy of various disinfectant approaches. Method(s): Staphylococcus aureus (NCIMB 9518) biofilms were grown in Tryptone Soya Broth on 10 mm stainless steel discs (2B finish) at 20-23\u00b0C for 12 days with rotation between wet and dry phases at 37\u00b0C every 48 h. Dry biofilms were exposed to disinfectant solutions with varying exposure times or wiped with disinfectant wipes using the ASTM2967-15 test. For comparison wet biofilm of S. aureus grown for 48 h and dried S. aureus inoculum (EN 13727) were used. Disinfectants included chlorine, glutaraldehyde and peracetic acid. Assessment of efficacy measured: biomass reduction by crystal violet staining, biofilm recovery indicated by a pH indicator colour change and transfer of bacteria from surface to surface. Results: Treatment of dry biofilms with wipes showed 60-90% reduction in biomass while biocidal solutions alone showed little reduction in biomass. Both modes of treatment did not achieve the ideal 3-4 log 10 reduction in CFU; some biofilm recovery was seen with the colorimetric medium after 24-48 h. Wet biofilms grown for 48 h showed no recovery in the colorimetric medium after 24-48 h. Dry biofilms, in contrast to 'wet' biofilms and planktonic cells, were found to persist after biocidal exposure highlighting the need for an improved anti-biofilm approach. Background: The necessity of proper disinfection and sterilization cannot be overemphasized for successful prevention and control of Healthcare Associated Infections (HAIs). Improper sterilization poses serious threat of infections over the patients. Aim(s)/Objective(s): To assess the impact of a multimodal intervention program to improve the decontamination practices of medical instruments among the healthcare workers (HCWs) at secondary level healthcare facilities in Bangladesh. Method(s): A yearlong quasi experimental study was conducted at two secondary level healthcare facilities in Bangladesh, where a total of 772 HCWs participated that included physicians, nurses, laboratory technicians, ward boys and cleaning staff. The multimodal intervention program consisted of education on standard decontamination process, skill enhancement through on job training and improvement of decontamination facilities. Compliance to standard decontamination practices was measured through direct observation before and after the intervention. Results: Continuous improvement of compliance on standard methods of disinfection and sterilization was seen after the intervention. Remarkable compliance was achieved-78.95% at the Institute of Child and Mother Health (ICMH) and 86.95% at General Hospital, Sirajgonj (GHS) ( p < 0.0001). Indicator tape for sterilization was introduced at both hospitals and the compliance significantly increased from 0% to 57.90% at ICMH and 0% to 65.22% at GHS ( p < 0.0001). Cleanliness of sterilization room improved from 63.64% to 89.47% at ICMH and 43.59% to 95.65% at GHS. Discussion and/or Conclusion(s): The study results show that the implemented multimodal intervention improved the standard decontamination practices among the HCWs, which in turn will play a critical role in preventing and controlling healthcare associated infections.",

Each bed space is fitted with standard issue flame-retardant 100% polyester curtains (Sunlight, UK). A UVo\u2122 system (Hygiene Solutions, Kings Lynn, UK) was operated within a bedspace behind closed privacy curtains, and UV levels outside the curtains measured using a Bentham dmc150 double monochromator system (Bentham Instruments Ltd, Reading, UK) spectrum range 250-410 nm. Measurements at head, abdomen and ankle heights were made with the use of a polystyrene, body shaped maniken placed outside the closed curtains. Results: The lowest value of effective treatment dose was equivalent to around 11 times that of the maximum permissible UV exposure and the maximum treatment dose was around 260 times this exposure limit. Discussion and/or Conclusion(s): It would not therefore be advisable to operate a UVC system with only hospital curtains screening off the bedspace from other patients or staff. Background: Although steam sterilization failures have been reported due to failure to remove air from the load, a classic example being the Devonport incident from the 1970's. There is still widespread denial in some healthcare groups that the presence of air can contribute to sterilization failures. Aim(s)/Objective(s): The aim of this study was to investigate steam penetration into dental handpieces using benchtop non-vacuum sterilizers commonly used in dental practice. Method(s): Three different types of handpieces were investigated for steam penetration into handpiece lumens using chemical indicators (CI), biological indicators (BI) and thermocouples/data loggers (TC). Non-vacuum (type N) Benchtop steam sterilizers were investigated in both the laboratory and general dental practice setting. In the laboratory we tested 4 different makes with 3 machine models for each make. In the General Dental Practice setting we tested seven nonvacuum benchtop sterilizers. Results: Results in the laboratory demonstrated BI failure for 15/1152 tests, CI failure for 9/1152 tests, typical delays in reaching sterilization temperature ranged from 0 to 165 seconds detected using TC. In general dental practice we detected BI failure rate of 34/378 tests, CI failure rate of 25/378 tests. And TC failure rates of 28/42 (defined by a temperature delay of 2\u00b0C, SHTM 2010). Discussion and/or Conclusion(s): In conclusion, we have demonstrated that type N sterilization of dental handpieces is unreliable due to trapped air in handpiece lumens. As a minimum we recommend that dental handpieces used in invasive procedures should be steam sterilized in a vacuum benchtop steam sterilizer.",

Aim(s)/Objective(s): Assess the performance of a DM dedicateddisinfectant during the maintenance of incubators. Identify potential sources of infection. Evaluate sampling material for reliability and accuracy. Method(s): 15 incubators were sampled with Rodac plates and environmental swabs before and after disinfetion. Rodac plates were applied on mastress and swabs on doors. Tranpsort liquid form swabs was spread on specific chromogenic media. Plates were identified and blind-counted by different operators. Results: After disinfection, doors were free of contamination, mattresses (2/15) presented a residual contamination (1 CFU) with S. saprophyticus or Pseudomonas. S. aureus was more oftenly present on mattresses (9/15) than doors (6/15) and was not observed anymore after disinfection. When disinfection and sampling were performed by 2 different operators, an incubator appeared really positive. Contamination after disinfection? Inadequate disinfection? RODAC plates are more reliable than 100 \u03bcL from a swab to detect a potential contamination. Swab sampling followed by spreading on chromogenic media allows the examination of the complexity of bacterial flora. Discussion and/or Conclusion(s): Umonium38 \u00ae Neutralis presented bactericidal activity at 0.5% after 10 min. RODAC plates were a powerful indicator of bacterial contamination. Mattresses were more contaminated than doors, with bacteria from enterobacteriae and/or Pseudomonas clusters. Mattress is a critical item to be disinfected and monitored.

Results: The post-intervention monitoring achieved levels of TVCs conforming to the limits of the Italian standard for drinking water. However, during the six months of surveillance after 30 days of shock, chairs showed an increase in TVCs. No significant differences were found between the TVCs detected in the dental chairs receiving treatments versus the control.

Device A effectively reduced >4 log CD from the bedside table despite heavy soiling. Conclusion: Enhanced-disinfection (UV-irradiation) is effective against MRSA, KP and CD spores and can reduce contamination from surfaces missed during terminal cleaning.

Quantitative real-time PCR of 16s rRNA gene was used to quantify the total number of bacteria present. Live/dead viability staining in conjunction with confocal laser scanning microscopy and scanning electron microscopy were used to visually confirm bacterial viability and biofilm presence respectively. Results: 40% of air-water channels and 50% of working channels were bacterial culture positive.

However, users need to consider a balance between the turnaround time (TAT), sensitivity/specificity, ease of use and cost of the test. Aim(s)/Objective(s): To evaluate the new Enigma MiniLab PCR-based POCT that tests for RSV, influenza A and B (without any subtyping), against our in-house respiratory PCR assay, in an adult bone marrow transplant/oncology unit, during the 2015-2016 influenza season. Method(s): Symptomatic, consenting patients requiring treatment and isolation for influenza-like illness were tested by taking two swabs, one each for the Enigma POCT (TAT = 90 minutes) and in-house assay (TAT = 6 hours). Results: In total, 86 samples were tested. For RSV, influenza A and B, respectively: 80, 81, 81 samples were NEG on both assays; 2, 3, 3 samples were POS on both assays; 1, 2, 0 samples were POS on the inhouse assay and NEG on the POCT; whereas, 3, 0, 2 samples were found POS on the POCT and NEG on the in-house assay. The POS% on the POCT and in-house assay, respectively were: RSV: 5.8% Background: An 18 year old asylum seeker travelled from Eritrea to the UK overland through Libya, the Mediterranean, and Europe. He presented with a month's history of fever, weight loss, malaise and abdominal pain. Initial investigations including a chest X-ray, routine bloods, abdominal ultrasound, malaria films, HIV test, and blood and urine cultures were all unremarkable apart from raised inflammatory markers. Sputum cultures grew Haemophilius influenzae but despite a course of amoxicillin the fevers continued. A wide differential was considered in view of the ongoing fevers, travel history and lack of organ focus. Extensive investigation was performed including a CT of the chest, abdomen and pelvis, brucella, leishmania and coxiella serology, a bone marrow biopsy, stool cultures and microscopy, and a vasculitis screen but no cause was found. A PET scan was performed to localize the presumed infective or malignant lesion and allow targeted biopsy. Multiple metabolically active abdominal and thoracic lymph nodes not apparent on CT were seen. EBUS collected insufficient sample for definitive histology. Given his country of origin, clinical picture and a positive T-spot test a diagnosis of occult tuberculous lymphadenitis was made and antituberculous therapy was started. The patient defevresced and put on weight. Subsequently a stool culture and the lymph node biopsy sample grew Mycobacterium bovis.",

Results: In this study we performed direct identification of isolates from 102 blood culture bottles which flagged positive, using a centrifugation method and compared these results to identifications obtained using traditional culture and identification methods. Correct identification was achieved in 65% of monomicrobial infections compared to traditional methods, with a greater proportion of Gram negative organisms being correctly identified (69%) than Gram positive organisms (63%). Ten blood culture bottles investigated in this study were polymicrobial, the direct identification method correctly identified one organism in 7 of these samples, in each case the likely pathogen was identified (e.g. Staphylococcus aureus or Enterococcus spp.) whereas probable contaminants were not. We also performed a retrospective analysis of antibiotic prescribing for patients included in this study to determine whether the correct identification of blood culture isolates using direct identification methods, improving the turnaround time by at least one day, would improve antibiotic prescribing practice and could in turn improve patient outcome.",

Method(s): A retrospective audit of all patients presenting with suspected meningitis who had lumbar puncture (LP) for suspected meningitis over an eighteen month period was performed. Case identification was undertaken by reviewing all CSF samples received by laboratories. Data was collected from case notes using a pro-forma adapted from the recent guidelines. Results: 75 patients were included. 2 patients had their LP in <1 hour. Mean time to LP was 13 hours (range 1-107) from presentation. 57 patients had neuro-imaging prior to LP. In 22 of these patients there was no indication for this. Other reasons for delayed LP included uncontrolled seizures, deteriorating GCS, agitation, patient refusal, and technically challenging LPs. 54 patients had blood cultures sent and 18 patients had blood sent for bacterial PCR.

Background: Scopulariopsis species are common soil saprophytes widely distributed in nature, previously isolated from plant debris, air and moist indoor environments. S. brevicaulis appears to be the most commonly isolated species with S. gracilis being the second most common. Ocular involvement has only rarely been reported and there remains a paucity of cases of Scopulariopsis keratitis within the literature. Aim(s)/Objective(s): This is a case of highly unusual Scopulariopsis gracilis fungal keratitis occurring in the interface between graft and host following a descemets stripping endothelial keratoplasty in which a contaminated graft was transplanted. To the best of our knowledge this is the first time Scopulariopsis gracilis fungal keratitis is reported and given its incidence following the implantation of a contaminated endothelial keratoplasty. Method(s): The infection likely occurred secondary to contamination of the dextran transport medium in which the human cornea was transferred from an eye bank. Scopulariopsis gracilis was subsequently isolated by the reference laboratory. Results: The slow growth of fungus was only detected on day 3 of culture. The sample was however released prior to this and implanted on day 2. Subconjunctival dexamethasone postoperatively may have encouraged the rapid growth of the fungus. The occular fungal infiltrates first enlarged despite therapy but later cleared after changing anti-fungal regime. Discussion and/or Conclusion(s): Patient had good treatment response with complete resolution of the fungal keratitis. Diagnosis was made promptly and treatment initiated early (topical G voriconazole & Amphotericin as well as oral Voriconazole & Itraconazole). The infected graft was removed promptly with repeat intracameral injections of anti-fungal agents. Background: Aspergillus fumigatus is a major fungal pathogen transmitted by the airborne route. Excavation of soil during construction/ renovation is thought to increase the spore burden and risk of nosocomial acquisition. Air sampling is performed for hospital surveillance, particularly during major construction to ensure engineering controls are effective.

Sabouraud dextrose agar was used to select A. fumigatus colonies, and Roswell Park Memorial Institute 1640 agar containing itraconazole/voriconazole screened for triazole resistant A. fumigatus. Results: Areas with controlled ventilation, and sealed windows, generally had satisfactory counts. Two wards without controlled ventilation repeatedly showed high Aspergillus counts which was addressed by installing portable HEPA filters. The Stem cell transplant unit consistently had satisfactory results. A. fumigatus CFU counts outdoors were generally higher than those indoors.

Background: Basal skull osteomyelitis is a challenging condition: surgery risks serious morbidity and mortality; the optimum duration of antibiotics is unknown. We have seen cases referred to the outpatient parenteral antimicrobial therapy (OPAT) service for conservative treatment. Aim(s)/Objective(s): We wished to determine complications on OPAT, the duration of intravenous antibiotics, and overall treatment success. Method(s): Retrospective analysis of a clinical OPAT database from 2009 to 2016, with individual review of case notes. Results: We found six cases of basal skull osteomyelitis treated on the OPAT service. Of these, 4/6 had a complication requiring admission: 1/4 antibiotic side effect; 1/4 line thrombosis; and 2/4 related to worsening condition. Subsequently 3/4 were discharged back to OPAT. The mean duration of antibiotics on OPAT was 44 days, mean total IV antibiotic duration was 66 days and mean overall treatment duration including oral antibiotics was 94 days. OPAT treatment success, defined as completion of intended intravenous antibiotics whilst on OPAT was 5/6. Overall treatment success, defined as completion of intended intravenous (on OPAT and inpatient) and subsequent oral antibiotics was 6/6. Of note, one case failed a twelve week course of antibiotics but achieved success following a repeat twelve week course of IV followed by twelve weeks of oral antibiotics. Although all patients finished their intended course of antibiotics, 3/6 had ongoing morbidity including: hearing loss 2/3; and ear discharge needing surgery 1/3.",

The incidence rates of the acquisition of MDRO and the rates of CLABSI were compared. Results: The overall rate of MDRO acquisition was 4.38 cases per 1000 patient-days before chlorhexidine bathing versus 2.03 cases per 1000 patient-days after the introduction of the wash cloths, a 53.6% reduction. The overall rate of CLABSI was 1.95 per 1000 catheter days at the start of the washing period versus 1.40 per 1000 catheter days at the end, a reduction of 28.2%. Discussion and/or Conclusion(s): Introduction of daily chlorhexidine washing appeared to be an effective intervention to reduce the rates of MDRO acquisition and decrease the infection rates in the ICU. Aim(s)/Objective(s): We performed a detailed evaluation of S. aureus carriage in critical care HCWs. Method(s): Consenting critical care HCWs in a teaching hospital in Southern England were serially screened for S. aureus carriage over 14 months. Data on demographics, co-morbidities, and medical care were collected. Longitudinal nasal carriage was defined using carriage profile indices (CPI) (total culture-positive swabs over total swabs). Measures of association were calculated using multivariate logistic regression. Results: Of 198 HCWs 147 (74.2%) were female, 146 (73.4%) were <40 years and prevalence of co-morbidities was low. Nasal carriage at study entry was identified in 54/149 (36.2%) nurses, 16/40 (40.0%) doctors and 3/9 (33.3%) physiotherapists (8 MRSA (all nurses)) and was associated with concurrent nursing home employment (OR 11, 95%CI 1.2-106.1, p = 0.038) and living with a partner (OR 2.2, 95%CI 1.1-4.3, p = 0.02). Serial screening revealed 73 HCWs (38.2%) intermittently carried S. aureus (CPI = 0.07-0.93), 36 (18.9%) were always culture-positive (CPI = 1) and 82 (42.9%) always culture-negative (CPI = 0). Of these serially screened HCWs, 54 (28.3%) (52 nurses, p < 0.001) received \u22651 course of antibiotics during the study. HCWs receiving antibiotics were twice as likely to carry S. aureus intermittently (OR 2.5, 95%CI 1.3-4.7, p = 0.006). Discussion and/or Conclusion(s): Longitudinal nasal carriage of S. aureus in critical care HCWs reveal diverse intermittent carriage profiles associated with receipt of antibiotics.

Universal MRSA decolonisation in critical care units is thought to reduce MRSA incidence and be a cost-effective method of controlling MRSA in this setting. Before 2014 all critical care patients at UHB received MRSA decolonisation therapy. In June 2014 UHB implemented a revised strategy for the control of MRSA and discontinued the use of universal decolonisation in critical care. Aim(s)/Objective(s): To review the effect of universal decolonisation on the incidence of MRSA acquisition and MRSA bacteraemia in a clinical care unit. Results: There was an increase of 31 acquisitions (55%; P < 0.005) and increase in bacteraemias from 5 to 11 (P < 0.005) in the 1-year period following the changes compared to the previous 12 months. Given these significant increases in the incidence of MRSA bacteraemias universal decolonisation was reintroduced into critical care. There has been a reduction of 37 acquisitions (46%; P < 0.005) and decrease in bacteraemias from 7 to 2 in the 6 month period following the reintroduction of routine decolonisation in critical care. Audits revealed no significant changes in hand hygiene compliance; appropriate use of personal protective equipment or environmental cleanliness during these periods. The clinical activity in critical care did not change during this time. Discussion and/or Conclusion(s): We suggest that routine decolonisation for MRSA in critical care is an effective strategy to reduce the spread of MRSA and the incidence of MRSA bacteraemia.",

NHS Improvement is responsible for overseeing foundation trusts, NHS trusts and independent providers. It offers support providers need to enable them to deliver consistently safe, high quality, compassionate care to patients. Infection prevention and control (IPC) remains high on the patient safety agenda in England. It is estimated that only around two-thirds of healthcare improvements go on to result in a sustainable change, which achieves the planned objective (Health Foundation, 2013) . Sustainable change is more likely to result from a model that involves patients and staff in developing, designing and implementing changes, rather than from a 'command and control'/top down model (Health Foundation, 2013) . In response, to this the four Heads of IPC in NHS Improvement and the quality improvement support specialists developed a 90 day IPC quality improvement (QI) collaborative programme for 24 Trusts/ Foundation Trusts in England. The aim was to promote shared; learning, best practices and innovations with colleagues from other provider organisations and to cultivate new approaches to developing and sustaining effective IPC. This poster discusses the collaborative approach used, and the experiences of the six Trusts within Midlands and East which participated; Bedford Hospital, Northampton General Hospital, The Royal Wolverhampton Trust, University Hospitals North Midlands, United Lincolnshire Hospitals and West Hertfordshire Hospitals.",

Aim(s)/Objective(s): To audit compliance within NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde (GGC) with the recommendations to repeat urine cultures in pregnant women with a previous positive urine culture. Method(s): Retrospective review of urine cultures from pregnant women within GGC over a 6 month period. Results: Between April and October 2015, GGC processed 240 positive urine cultures from 202 pregnant women. Of the samples, 58% came from secondary care settings, 40% from primary care settings, with the remaining 2% from unknown locations. 38.6% and 49.6% of all samples were repeated within a 1-month and 2-month period respectively. At the time of analysis, 28% of samples had not been repeated. There was no significant difference between primary and secondary care.

Results: The study showed that the motivational factors for intersectoral collaboration were: focus on organisation and structure in the organisations, collaboration through networks, awareness of the importance of clear communications paths and focus on the professional competencies in relation to infection hygiene. A structured collaboration with the establishment of an actual infection control organisation resulted in access to expert knowledge, security among the personnel as well as motivation to work with infection control as an area of focus. Discussion and/or Conclusion(s): Nosocomial infections in patients transferring from one health sector to another can likely be prevented by the introduction of knowledge of infection control to all levels of personnel in the sectors, and by entering into a formalised collaboration across the health sectors with the aim of establishing an intersectoral infection control organization. Background: Leptospirosis is a zoonotic infection occurring worldwide but is endemic in tropical countries. The clinical presentation is heterogeneous, ranging from an undifferentiated febrile illness to 'Weil's disease'. Serological testing is the main diagnostic modality. Aim(s)/Objective(s): To review serological testing for Leptospirosis at our institution over a 10-year period and describe the clinical features of cases. Method(s): We identified patients from two tertiary care hospitals in Edinburgh, United Kingdom, who had samples sent to a Public Health England reference laboratory for Leptospirosis testing between 2006-2016. Clinical, laboratory and microbiological information on cases was collected retrospectively. Complete details were unavailable for four cases. Results: 480 samples were sent for Leptospirosis IgM ELISA testing: 450 were negative, 26 were positive and four were equivocal. There was no temporal trend to testing. The positive results came from 14 patients with a median age of 26 years. Nine cases were imported, mostly from Asia and with a history of fresh water exposure. Patients presented with non-specific symptoms: fever (10/11); myalgia (8/11); gastrointestinal symptoms (8/11); and headache (7/11). Laboratory evidence of hepatitis (8/10), acute kidney injury (5/10) and lymphopenia (8/10) was common. One patient developed 'Weil's disease' with multi-organ failure. Antimicrobials were administered in seven cases, usually doxycycline (5/7). There were no deaths. Discussion and/or Conclusion(s): Leptospirosis is an uncommon infection in Scotland. Most cases are imported, in contrast to recent UK-wide data, and this may be attributable to the Scottish climate. The clinical presentation is protean and mild hepato-renal involvement is common even in the absence of organ failure.",

IE is treated with antibiotics and, according to the European Society of Cardiology guidelines, some cases may be amenable to Outpatient Parenteral Antimicrobial therapy (OPAT). However, there is currently little literature available on the use of OPAT for IE. Aim(s)/Objective(s): This study aims to determine the safety and efficacy of OPAT in treating IE. Method(s): All 43 IE patients (50 episodes) referred to the NHS Lothian OPAT clinic were reviewed, the gathered data analysed and Duke criteria fulfilment noted where possible. Results: The mean patient age was 58 years, 27/43 were male and 41/43 were accepted to OPAT. Streptococci spp. were the infective organism in 23/50 episodes, with 9/50 and 4/50 for Staphylococcus spp. and Enterococcus spp. respectively. 11/50 episodes were prosthetic valve IE. 21/43 patients had a relevant co-morbidity. Adverse events were recorded for 8/50 episodes, of which 5 were drug-related and resolved with treatment change. 4 patients required elective valve replacement surgery following OPAT discharge. Of the 48 episodes completed over 3 months ago, there were 3 deaths, including both patients not accepted to OPAT, and one death due to unrelated causes. Discussion and/or Conclusion(s): Therefore, in a selected group, it is possible to successfully treat IE using OPAT and thus reduce the number of inpatient days associated with this condition. This could potentially allow more cost-effective use of resources as well as reduce risks associated with prolonged hospitalisation. Background: Non-typhoidal salmonella, NTS, infection commonly causes gastroenteritis after ingesting contaminated food. Bacteraemia is unusual and is associated with immunosuppression. The incidence of NTS bacteraemia increased with the HIV epidemic but as potent immunosuppressant medications become more widely used these patients will also be at risk. Aim(s)/Objective(s): We present a case of recurrent NTS bacteraemia with a mycotic aortic aneurysm in a patient taking methotrexate. Method(s): Case report: A 69-year-old man presented with fever and right flank pain, one month after starting methotrexate for Wegener's granulomatosis. Other co morbidities included angina, atrial fibrillation and chronic kidney disease. Blood cultures grew Salmonella enteritidis. It transpired he been treated 4 months earlier for a bacteraemia with the same organism. CT showed a dissecting aneurysm of the abdominal aorta extending to the right common iliac artery, which was too large for surgical intervention. A plan was made for lifelong antibiotic suppression. Results: His treatment was complicated by pancytopenia with ceftriaxone and seizures whilst on ciprofloxacin. He changed to trimethoprim and amoxicillin but repeat CT scan at 4 weeks showed progression of the dissection. He continued treatment but died 6 weeks later. Discussion and/or Conclusion(s): NTS bacteraemia should prompt investigation for immunosuppression as well as a search for an underlying source. Mycotic aneurysms with NTS have a high mortality. Surgical repair with an extended course of appropriate antibiotics is recommended. Patients may need lifelong suppressive treatment, which may be difficult to tolerate. Even with surgical resection of some infected material antibiotic suppression may still fail.",

Royal Liverpool University Hospital Background: Bacterial meningitis and meningococcal sepsis are rare but important conditions associated with serious morbidity and mortality. Early recognition and treatment is essential to minimize deleterious effects. Management relies on appropriate use of neuroimaging, lumbar punctures (LPs) and prompt antibiotic therapy to avoid delayed treatment as exemplified in recent guidelines. 1 Aim(s)/Objective(s): To investigate the management of meningitis in adults (>18 years) since the publication of updated UK joint specialist societies guidelines. 1 Method(s): A retrospective audit of electronic and paper case notes from January 2015-June 2016 against current guidelines. 1 Results: We reviewed 15 records; 73.3% (11) of patients entered through A&E, 11 (73.3%) were female with mean age of 40.3 years (SD: 17.65). Of those reviewed; 8 (53.3%) were likely bacterial meningitis: 4 (27%) pneumococcal, 1 (6.6%) HSV 1, 1 (6.6%) pharyngitis and 1 (6.6%) migraine. Immediate LP was contraindicated in 26.7% (4) of cases. Immediate LP was carried out in 20% (2) of those with no contraindication. No LP was performed within 1 hour. Antibiotics were administered at a median time of 274 minutes after arrival to hospital (IQR: 123-571 minutes). Only 7.1% (1) of patients had a LP before antibiotics.",

These populations are of potential relevance to vaccine design. However, only a limited set of epitopes exhibit such responses, and thus directing these remains an issue. Aim(s)/Objective(s): We have developed a simple and tractable adenoviral model to define the critical rules governing epitopespecific memory inflation, which in parallel informs us further on adenoviral vaccine T cell responses. We tested whether minimal epitope-insert adenoviral vectors (called \"minigene vectors\"), can provide effective, targeted vaccine responses against a range of epitopes.

However vaccination practice had several flaws the most common being incorrect number of doses per primary schedule. Discussion and/or Conclusion(s): There are several gaps in vaccination practice when compared to national guidelines.

However, vaccine uptake among HCWs is below the national target (40%). Aim: To identify the attitudes and beliefs of HCWs towards influenza vaccine and their influence on vaccine uptake. Method(s): Study Design: A qualitative retrospective systematic review. Electronic data sources reviewed: These included CINAHL, Medline, Embase, Cochrane Library, PsycINFO and PubMed (2000-2015) . The search was performed using defined MeSH terms and keywords. Studies related to influenza vaccination on patients were excluded. Background: Immunization against diphtheria, poliomyelitis and pertussis was initiated in 1938, 1958 and 1959 respectively in Singapore. Aim(s)/Objective(s): The aim of the study was to examine the prevalence of pertussis, diphtheria and poliovirus antibodies in healthcare personnel in Changi General Hospital. Method(s): Annual health screening of healthcare personnel in Changi General Hospital was conducted in September 2014. Residual sera from health care personnel were collected. Human IgG antibodies against Bordetella pertussis, diphtheria toxoid and poliovirus (all 3 serotypes simultaneously) were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Results: A total of 352 healthcare personnel were recruited; 150 healthcare personnel in 21-30 age group, 150 in 31-40 age groups and 52 personnel in above 40 age group. The seroprevalence of antibodies against all 3 serotype of poliovirus was 68.47% (95% CI 63.4-73.1%). It decreased significantly with age from 94% in 21-30 age group, 60% in 31-40 age group and 19.23% above 40 age group (P = 1.05). The presence of pertussis antibodies was demonstrated in only 38.06% of the healthcare personnel (95% CI 33.2-43.2%). The seroprevalence decreased from 44.6% in 21-30 age group, to 36% in 31-40 age group and 25% in above 40 age group (P = 0.026). The seroprevalence of diphtheria was found in 93.75% of healthcare personnel (95% CI 0.7-95.8%) and increased above 90% in all 3 age groups. Discussion and/or Conclusion(s): Waning immunity against poliovirus beginning at age 30 was demonstrated. A significant proportion of healthcare personnel lacked immunity against pertussis. Routine pertussis and polio boosters should be given to healthcare personnel to ensure sustained immunity against these diseases. Background: On 1st September 2015, the United Kingdom became the first country to integrate Bexsero \u00ae , a vaccine against meningococcal group B into the national immunisation schedule. This vaccine is associated with higher rates of fever when given alongside routine immunisations compared to routine immunisations alone (51-61% versus 23% respectively). Public Health England have recommended the administration of prophylactic paracetamol to all infants receiving this vaccine in order to decrease unnecessary General Practice or Accident & Emergency attendances, alleviate parental concern and distress for the child. There are no data available regarding the incidence of fever in preterm neonates receiving this vaccine or recommendations on prophylactic paracetamol specific to preterm infants. Aim(s)/Objective(s): The aim was to monitor the response to immunisation in this vulnerable population. Method(s): We prospectively collected data on all preterm neonates receiving Bexsero \u00ae vaccine on a tertiary neonatal unit. We recorded the incidence of fever and other adverse events in the 48 hours following immunisation. Results: Between September 15 and July 16, 38 infants were immunised. The gestational age at birth ranged between 23 + 2 and 36 + 3, with a median age of 26 weeks. They were immunised at a median age of 10 weeks. One infant (2.6%) developed fever >38 degress in the 48 hours post-immunisation. Other significant events that occured post immunisation were repiratory deterioration in 2 infants (5.3%) and suspected sepsis in 4 infants (10.5%). Discussion and/or Conclusion(s): The incidence of fever greater than 38 degrees was significantly lower in our cohort of preterm infants than in term infants immunised with Bexsero \u00ae . high education qualifications (73.9%) and currently employed (49.1%) in a field not related to health (84.9%). 64.6% did not visit a general physician nor a gynecologist regularly. 85.6% were aware of cervical cancer. 53.9% correctly identified HPV infection involvement in the pathogenesis of cervical cancer. 35.6% were aware of HPV infection but 80.4% believed their information was lacking. 37.6% of participants had been screened by Pap smear for cervical cancer at least once in their lives whereas 9% did not know what a Pap smear was. Screening was significantly associated with cervical cancer awareness and regular visits to general health physicians and gynecologists. 11.7% of participants aged 18-35 were vaccinated against HPV. Vaccination uptake was significantly associated with cervical cancer awareness, religion, field of work and studies, and regular visits to gynecologists. Background: The severity and impacts of Ebola and Zika viral diseases emerging epidemics public health threat of international concern in low and middle income countries has been echoed. The gravity and dangers of the lack of local and international functioning emergency preparedness and smart response actions remain of concern to African citizenry and the global community. Aim(s)/Objective(s): The paper examines research and knowledge gaps in strengthening early warning and surveillance strategies in emerging threat and epidemics preparedness and intelligent response in sub-Sahara Africa. Method(s): A systematic and quasi-explorative method was used to assess relevant peer-review literature on emerging Zika and Ebola threats and epidemics gaps in preparedness and emergency response in Africa continent. Results: Our findings showed that the unprecedented Ebola and Zika epidemics gaps and consequences on population health and economy have thought us the value of establishing and sustaining local and national robust and reliable capacities and mechanisms to deal with evolving and future crisis. Hence, adequate partnerships in commitment and financial investment in scaling up operational research and R&D is imperative. Novel, more sensitive and rapid diagnosis, development of effective and safe Zika and Ebola treatment and vaccines, but also contextual early warning and surveillance strategies in evidence-based community alertness and education, engagement and participation, and coordinated efficient utilization of local and international assistance in smart response are paramount. Discussion and/or Conclusion(s): The paper provides practical and programmatic recommendations in improving strategic early warning and surveillance strategies integration and alignment of local and national \"One health\" strategy priorities and programs in sub-Sahara Africa.",

Aim(s)/Objective(s): To investigate and manage the increasing GRE incidence in the hospital. Method(s): Between Jan-Jun 2015, the infection prevention and control team investigated the increase in the number of GRE reports issued by the laboratory using passive surveillance. All necessary data required for the investigation was collected prospectively. All isolates during the same 6 month period were sent for typing. Results: The increase in incidence was localised to 4 specific \"hub\" sites in the hospital. These included the general surgical ward, critical care unit, haemato-oncology ward and general medical ward. Patients in the medical wards carried GRE in predominantly their urine samples, while patients on the surgical and critical care wards were more often colonised in wounds or on devices. Of the 40 isolates typed by PFGE, 18 were reported to be unique strains. Only one of these 40 had no contact with healthcare in the last year. There were three probable cross transmission events. Antibiotic use and presence of indwelling device was most common risk factors. An infection control bundle was instituted in July 2015 following which a significant reduction in GRE was noted. Discussion and/or Conclusion(s): Targeted invention control bundle in surgical, critical care and haemato-onclogy wards which included 1. weekly antibiotic audits 2. enhanced environmental cleaning 3. cohorting/isolating patients, without recourse to active surveillance, and 4. emphasis on hand hygiene was successful in reducing incidence significantly in the trust. Discussion and/or Conclusion(s): This mutidisciplinary involvement included weekly measurement of CDI numbers to inform improvement in real time, changes in the testing for and treatment of CDI and the improvement to ensure effective decontamination of mattresses, commodes and bedpans. The overall result was 57% reduction in the number of hospital acquired CDI in 2015.",

Consequently morbidity, mortality, and hospital costs increase. Moreover, MDROs are easily transmitted and cause outbreaks often difficult to contain in care facilities. Aim(s)/Objective(s): In Belgium, the Outbreak Support Team (OST) is created to give the opportunity to the care facilities, struggling with outbreaks involving MDROs, to call for help from an external partner without being blamed or stigmatized. Method(s) : This OST is a collaboration between the regional health authorities in charge of infectious diseases, the Scientific Institute of Public Health, and the National Reference Laboratories. The help, offered by OST, includes scientific support, site visits, advice on prioritizing actions, and (rarely) enforcement. Results: The contribution of the OST to outbreak management will be described. Several tools have been developed: a checklist to inventory the measures, transfer-and transport documents to standardize the communication about MDRO contaminated patients, initiatives to increase the knowledge of MDRO at other care sectors like nursing homes, revalidation centers, and homecare. Based on our experience and on the hand of examples, some recurrent triggers for the development of and fitfalls in the control of an outbreak can be listed. Discussion and/or Conclusion(s): Despite the expertise present and the measures taken in the hospitals, the OST can help to control the outbreak.

In the University Hospital of Brussels, the incidence of new patients with CPE rose from 1 case in 2010 to 35 cases in 2015. Between January and August 2015, 6 patients became infected/colonized with CPE during their stay in the same room in intensive care unit (ICU). Results: The time period between those patients was relatively small and although the strains belonged to different species with different antibiograms and mechanisms of resistance, the hypothesis was that the environment could be a possible source of transmission. Investigation suggested that the evil doer was a contaminated sink. Besides other strains, C. freundii type OXA-48 was frequently isolated from patients and sinks. To investigate the phylogenetic relationschip between those strains, PGFE was performed. The strains isolated from patients and the sink in the implicated room were highly related and pointed to sink to patient transmission. Samples in the other ICU rooms were also taken, revealing that 9 out of the 32 sinks were contaminated with CPE. To control the outbreak, the sinks and their plumbings were replaced by new ones with another structure, they were flushed every morning with a glucoprotamin solution and routines regarding sink practices were improved. In the eight months period after replacements of the sinks, only one new patient with CPE was detected in ICU. Discussion and/or Conclusion(s): In conclusion, this outbreak highlights that sink drains can accumulate strains with resistance genes and become a potential source of CPE. Method(s): During December 2015 three patients on the ward tested positive on the same day for RSV with one case discharged home, one asymptomatic case remaining on the ward and the final case nursed with infection control precautions in place due to the presence of symptoms. An outbreak was declared and the ward closed to admissions/transfers when a fourth patient case was confirmed. Infection control precautions included patient and staff screening, isolation/ cohorting of cases, exclusion of symptomatic staff and personal protective equipment (including surgical face masks). Over the course of the outbreak the situation was assessed by an outbreak control team using the hospital infection incident assessment tool (HIIAT). Results: A total of 8 patients and 2 staff tested positive during the outbreak. Four patient cases required treatment with Ribavarin and immunoglobulin. The ward remained closed for a total of 8 days, reopening when the outbreak was declared over. Asymptomatic patient carriers were detected and possibly contributed to ongoing cross transmission. Discussion and/or Conclusion(s): A review undertaken has provided recommendations including, isolation of a patient when symptoms first detected, exploration of near patient testing and development of an early alert to highlight increased incidence in the community setting. In high risk patient groups asymptomatic carriage is an important consideration. Background: Pneumocystis jirovecii is a serious opportunistic fungal infection of immunosuppressed patients. Its incidence is increasing in England. Previously associated with HIV/Aids it is increasingly recognised in patients immunosuppressed due to cancer/transplant treatment. Aim(s)/Objective(s): We describe the learning from investigating 3 outbreaks in one region, including diagnostic approaches, the availability, utility and interpretation of genotyping, the role of environmental sampling and control measures. We also describe the current national surveillance for fungal infections, including Pneumocystis jirovecii. Method(s): Each incident was identified through clinical recognition and hospital based surveillance. Outbreaks were declared and control teams formed. Descriptive epidemiology and analytical case-control studies were undertaken. Genotyping was undertaken in 2 incidents. Limited environmental investigations were undertaken for one and detailed, repeated environmental sampling undertaken in another. PCR combined with clinical and radiological findings was used for diagnosis. Results: Three outbreaks were identified (2012) (2013) (2014) (2015) across three different teaching hospitals in one region (2 renal units and 1 across multiple specialities). 25, 88 and 12 patients were identified in the respective outbreaks. Genotyping was available for 2, showing clonality in the isolates obtained. Environmental deposition was identified in one incident (surfaces and air handling systems). Discussion and/or Conclusion(s): Pneumocystis jirovecii outbreaks are difficult to investigate, not least because of the lack of systematic national surveillance. Culture is not currently possible, the diversity of genotypes in localities and nationally is underdeveloped and the ecology and epidemiology incompletely understood. Our investigations have advanced our understanding of these complex incidents which carry a substantial morbidity and mortality for affected patients. In the current study we evaluated the genetic variation in a subset of outbreak clinical samples with the hypothesis that these isolates have unique biological characteristics that serve to prolong the outbreak. Method(s): Fitness assays, mutation rate and whole genome sequencing were performed to test for selective advantage and compensatory mutations. Results: The fitness and the mutation rate of the resistant isolates were not different from either the reference strain H37Rv, the other susceptible isolates in the lineage or unrelated isoniazid susceptible and resistant samples.",

Discussion and/or Conclusion(s): This detailed analysis of the genetic variation of these INH-R samples suggests that this outbreak consists of successful, closely-related, circulating strains with heterogeneous resistance profiles and little or no associated fitness cost or impact on their mutation rate. Specific deletions and SNPs may be a peculiar feature of these isolates, which can potentially explain their persistence for years. Method(s): Samples from patients in whom Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia (PJP) was suspected were analysed with PJPCR in a single Public Health England (PHE) laboratory.

Results: The same genotype 811/81 was found in patients and the healthcare environment. 9/10 stacks (air handling unit) were PJPCR positive. 81/811 strain was present on the intake filter serving the renal ward and on another extract filter. In wards that had previously had patients with PJP, 7/12 surface samples from air vents, pathology chute, light fitting, supply air-vents were PJPCR positive. No genotyping was possible. Air sampling was negative for PJPCR. Following the deep clean, all samples were negative. Discussion and/or Conclusion(s): Further work is required to understand the significance of environmental PJ and its role in the transmission and pathogenesis of PJP. The results were available on Monday 1 June. Three further patients developed laboratory-confirmed rotavirus infection between 1 and 6 June. Of the five cases, three had diarrhoea and vomiting, one had diarrhoea only and one had vomiting only. Typing results were available for four patients and all had the same non-vaccine strain: G12P8. All the infections were hospital acquired but it was not possible to establish the source. Results: In all, 21 patients were assessed for gastrointestinal symptoms and thirteen had stool samples tested, of which five tested positive. The bays containing the symptomatic patients were closed, confirmed cases were transferred to side rooms, and remained there until at least 8 days after the onset of symptoms or until they had been asymptomatic for 48 hours, whichever was the later. Enhanced infection control (EIC) measures were implemented. All the patients recovered. The bays were deep-cleaned and re-opened, and EIC measures were stood down on 17 June. Discussion and/or Conclusion(s): In the literature rotavirus is rarely described as a cause of diarrhoea and/or vomiting in adults, and the outbreak highlights the need to test for this pathogen. While there is no specific treatment, identification of rotavirus enables advice to be given on the duration of isolation, important in a clinical setting where length of stay often exceeds the infective period.",

Results: The longest duration of virus in semen was 91 days, much longer than the previously reported 62 days. Discussion and/or Conclusion(s): Our results suggest the duration of persistence of ZIKV in semen is variable but may be protracted in some individuals, indicating the potential for prolonged sexual transmission. Our findings are useful for establishing the likelihood of sexual transmission, informing family planning and national guidelines which currently recommend that asymptomatic males returning from countries with ongoing ZIKV transmission should only use barrier protection for 8 weeks to reduce the risk of sexual transmission.",

            "text": "Failure of routine practice to detect a community MRSA cluster of EMRSA15: description of a public health investigation Background: Here we report a public health investigation of a cluster of genomically related isolates of epidemic methicllin resistant Staphylococcus aureus-15 (EMRSA-15), the dominant lineage in UK hospitals and long-term care facilities. These isolates were identified through whole-genome sequencing (WGS) in patients residing in the same geographical area and registered to the same general practice. This cluster had not been detected by routine practice, including Post Infection Review (PIR). Aim(s)/Objective(s): We aimed to identify related cases, epidemiological links between patients and the potential for ongoing transmission. Method(s): Closely related MRSA isolates were identified using WGS from a 12-month prospective observational study that was conducted between 2012 and 2013 at a regional microbiological laboratory, and additional case-finding. Public health investigation consisted of a retrospective analysis of healthcare data to identify potential epidemiological links and prospective on-site observation and sampling to determine the potential for ongoing transmission. Results: The cluster comprised 27 isolates from 15 cases, including two bacteraemias. The cluster lacked a clear epidemiological link to a single hospital, suggesting community transmission. On-site observation identified several areas where practice could be improved, but samples from staff and environmental sites were negative for MRSA. Discussion and/or Conclusion(s): The dependence on WGS for identification of this community cluster of EMRSA-15, despite the presence of two fatal bacteraemias, suggests a potentially beneficial role for targeted WGS in routine practice. As highlighted by this study, community spread of MRSA is an increasingly recognised transmission pathway, but hospital-centric infection control procedures do not reflect this. Aim(s)/Objective(s): To better characterise this outbreak, a retrospective analysis of measles cases between 2010 and 2016 was performed at a large central London teaching hospital, which has had 12.3% of all measles cases in London in 2016. Method(s) : Electronic patient notes and laboratory reporting systems were used to retrospectively analyse the clinical course and demographic information of 60 patients with laboratory-confirmed measles diagnoses (RT-PCR positive and/or IgM positive/equivocal with IgG either positive/negative) between 2010 and 2016. Results: Of the 60 patients with confirmed measles, 44 (73%) were aged 15 and older. Delayed diagnosis due to misattribution of the measles rash to a drug reaction was seen in 3 (5%) of patients. Of the 30 patients with full clinical information available, 23 (77%) were not placed in respiratory isolation within 15 minutes of arrival to A&E, thereby requiring contact tracing of large numbers of exposed patients. 3 (10%) presented to hospital up to more 3 times after their first visit. The median number of hospital doctors reviewing a patient pre-diagnosis was 2 (IQR 1-2; range 1-6). Discussion and/or Conclusion(s): The reasons for delayed diagnosis include lack of recognition of measles by clinicians despite seemingly classical presentations, highlighting a clear need for improved awareness and education. Our measles control strategy therefore should focus on both clinician education as well as awareness regarding infection control measures.",

There is increased incidence reported from other European countries as well. Aim(s)/Objective(s): To evaluate Clostridium difficile 078 infections. Method(s): In the teaching hospital, patients with C diff ribotype 078 were evaluated Results: 16 patients have been identified with C diff ribotype 078 since January 2015. There were 6 females and 10 males. Mean age was 80 yrs (range 70-98 except one of 49 years). With the available data 4 had resolved within 30 days. 11/16 (69%) patients died following this infection. Six died within 30 days whilst 5 died after 30 days. All 16 of these cases have been linked to the same cluster using VNTR profile/DNA finger printing. Discussion and/or Conclusion(s): Extensive mapping was done to see movements of these patients in the hospital. No single ward had been identified where all 16 patients have been through. They've been cared for in 18 different wards. Majority of the patients have been admitted through MAU. Public Health England also undertook patient mapping, no links (Trust or community) were identified. We believe that equipment and the environment is a key causative link, therefore cleanliness was the focus for the management of the outbreak. Hydrogen peroxide decontamination of enteric isolation rooms were done routinely as standard. Hyper toxin producer Clostridium difficile 078 was associated with high mortality rate. Background: Malassezia is a basidiomycetous fungus that is a commensal of human and animal skin. Although rare, Malassezia species are an important cause of nosocomial infection and fungemia in preterm neonates and immunocompromised patients. M.pachydermatis colonizes the stratum corneum of dogs, with reports of zoonotic transmission by healthcare workers being well documented. Risk factors for colonisation in neonates include the degree of prematurity, corresponding skin condition, endotracheal intubation and indwelling vascular catheters. Aim(s)/Objective(s): In January 2016, 3 babies in a 13-cot neonatal unit isolated M.pachydermatis from ear swabs taken as part of routine microbiological screening. Following identification an outbreak investigation was initiated. Before 2016 M.pachydermatis had never been isolated in the unit, furthermore no change had been made to the laboratory procedure for processing neonatal screens. Method(s): As part of the outbreak investigation, all babies on the unit were screened weekly. Infection control measures included education on standard infection control precautions, hand hygiene and compliance with uniform policy. Equipment disinfection was also reviewed. Background: Influenza can cause significant morbidity and mortality in the elderly. Influenza vaccination is recommended in high-risk groups (elderly, significant co-morbidities) to prevent infection. Aim(s)/Objective(s): To describe an influenza outbreak in an elderly rehabilitation ward and to audit diagnosis and management against Infection Control and Prevention Trust guidelines. Method(s): Following identification of the Influenza A H1N1 virus, all patients were risk assessed and treated as per Trust protocol. Symptomatic patients had oropharyngeal swabs taken to confirm the diagnosis. They were treated with Oseltamivir. Influenza vaccination status was checked with patients or confirmed with patients' GPs. Anonymised data was collected. Staff members were risk assessed and their vaccination status was checked. Staff was consented for use of anonymised data in research: data was recorded by staff type. Results: 18 patients were present on the ward: 4 patients' vaccination status was unknown. 7 patients were vaccinated, 7 were not vaccinated. Of the 7 vaccinated patients, 1 patient was symptomatic and influenza positive. Of the 7 non-vaccinated, 4 were symptomatic and found to be influenza positive. Zero patients with influenza died or required higher care.",

More than 90% (461/499) were asymptomatic carriers identified through screening or contact tracing. 11 blood culture isolates were identified. 21 different wards had at least one patient with VRE. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and Multi-locus sequence typing (MLST) indicated a single-strain outbreak. Discussion: Containing the outbreak was costly and tedious. We believe this was mainly due to the lack of guidelines, standardized laboratory methodology and organizational culture. Despite increasing rates of colonization in our hospital, there have been few adverse outcomes related to VRE. What actually defines a cost-effective infection control intervention? Antibiotic resistance knows no geographic borders and VRE is said to be \"a canary in the mine\". Should VRE actually be one of our main concerns in the future? Conclusion: VRE has not been eradicated form our hospital. We must remain vigilant to prevent another large outbreak but getting back to baseline may be illusive. Method(s): Healthcare facilities with outbreaks involving multi-drug resistant organisms (MDRO) can ask for support from the national Outbreak Support Team (OST). Results: Outbreak1: September 2014-April 2015 (strain USA300, t008): 14 infected and 5 colonized persons among 10 families, several relapses observed. The index case had a history of noninvestigated relapsing skin infections. The outbreak was reported 5 months after onset. Outbreak2: September-December 2015 (strain USA300, t008): 3 families involved with 4 infected and 4 colonized cases. A HCW with a known CA-MRSA history started working in the ward few days before the index case was identified. Outbreak3: January-April 2016 (strain USA400, t1931): 6 families involved with 6 infections (mostly breast abscesses) and 6 colonizations (4 patients, 2 HCW). The index case was a patient with non investigated relapsing skin infections who probably contaminated HCW1, who further contaminated HCW2. The outbreak spread among mothers and babies. All outbreaks were successfully managed through close collaboration between OST, Medical direction, infection control teams, maternity HCW and laboratories. Discussion and/or Conclusion(s): Controlling the spread of CA-MRSA requires carefully elaborated strategies. Although mothers are mostly in good health, compliance to hand hygiene recommendations remains essential in maternity wards. Early declaration of outbreaks is important. Screening mothers with skin disease history before delivery could be a protective measure. Results: As well as describing the organisms, infection categories and care settings involved in infection incidents during this time period the report also highlighted potential reporting biases. The report found lower levels of reporting of CDI and Staphylococcus aureus than expected given that there has been no significant change in infection incidence for these pathogens according to national surveillance; there was also considerable variation in reporting (no. of reports) between boards. Previously, NHS Boards were required to report all incidents assessed as amber or red to HPS, reporting of HIIAT green incidents to HPS was voluntary; if a bias exists it is possibly due to variation in application of the HIIAT resulting in under reporting. Discussion and/or Conclusion(s): In April 2016 reporting of all nonnorovirus HIIAT green incidents was made mandatory in NHSScotland. It is anticipated that this mandatory reporting will reduce potential reporting biases and enable HPS to provide a more accurate picture of infection incident epidemiology in NHSScotland. This study provides a baseline against which to measure the impact of non-norovirus HIIAT green reporting and may also provide an opportunity to improve consistency of healthcare associated infection incident assessment in NHSScotland.",

Recent outbreaks have been reported in the literature including the S. capitis clone NRCS-A, characterised by vancomycin resistance or heteroresistance. In a recent French study S.capitis late onset sepsis was found to be a risk factor for severe morbidity. With advances in laboratory methods and use of MALDI-TOF identification of Coagulase negative staphylococci (CNS) to species level is being performed more frequently. Aim(s)/Objective(s): We describe an outbreak of S. capitis in a Scottish neonatal intensive care unit. Method(s): 3 patients with S capitis bacteraemia were identified over a 16 day period. Blood culture isolates were identified using MALDI-TOF. During subsequent investigations a further case was detected taking the total number to 4 cases in 1 month. Two of the patients were treated for infection; the other two were considered contaminants. Results: Pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) of the blood culture isolates revealed the same pulsotype. Infection control measures implemented included increased environmental cleaning, education and a review of staff skin health in the unit. Environmental screening was undertaken but was negative with no source identified. Discussion and/or Conclusion(s): S capitis is an emerging pathogen in neonates. No source was found in our outbreak which was brought under control by implementation of infection control measures. Use of MALDI-TOF was pivotal in identifying this outbreak. Laboratories should give consideration to identifying CNS from neonatal units to species level to enable early outbreak detection.",

            "text": "Background: The 2014/5 Ebola (EVD) epidemic in West Africa (WA) resulted in a large international humanitarian response. Health care workers (HCWs) from WA were disproportionately affected, and a few international HCWs were infected. Aim(s)/Objective(s): Since asymptomatic EVD has been described, we tested international returnees for EVD antibodies. Method(s): An online consent and survey link were distributed using a snowball technique. Eligibility criteria included having travelled to WA during the epidemic and never having tested positive for Ebola virus or received a filovirus vaccine. Oral fluid collection devices were posted and returned using standard mail. Samples were tested using an IgG capture ELISA. Non-exposed UK controls were tested. Results: 268 individuals responded and submitted a sample; 152 (56.7%) were women. The majority (253, 94.4%) travelled to Sierra Leone. Roles included, but were not limited to; laboratory (95, 35.4%), clinical (124, 42.3%), epidemiologist/research (37, 13.8%), community engagement/burial (19, 7.1%) and water/sanitation/engineer (14, 5.2%). A total of 233 (86.9%) returnees spent time in Personal Protective Equipment (PPE), of whom 22 (9.4%) had concerns about exposure during removal, and 54 (20.1%) described possible significant EVD exposure. 57 (21.3%) described a febrile/diarrhoeal illness in WA or within 1 month of return. Of the 268 returnees, two had reactive results on IgG capture assay. Neither was reactive on a competitive ELISA using plasma. Discussion and/or Conclusion(s): A high proportion of international responders reported potential exposure to EVD, and reported a febrile illness during the incubation period for Ebola. Improvements in training and procedures, and consistency in PPE equipment and removal may mitigate this. Background: In early September 2016, three cases of invasive Group A streptococcal (iGAS) infection were identified who shared the same rare emm type (emm ST9). These cases were investigated by the East of England Health Protection Team (HPT) to identify common links and oversee the implementation of control measures. Aim(s)/Objective(s): 1. Identify and eliminate a potential source of exposure 2. Identify any further linked cases 3. Prevent ongoing transmission Method(s): An incident management team (IMT) was convened. This discussed case epidemiology, possible mechanisms for transmission and further investigations. The HPT agreed actions with the community health healthcare trust infection control team (ICT) to prevent further transmission. Results: Initial investigations identified that the cases were resident geographically close to each other (3 miles) and received wound care for bilateral leg ulcers from the same community nursing team. The community healthcare service provider infection control team (ICT) assessed the nursing team and preliminary findings identified two nurses who had visited all three cases during their incubation period, one of whom was symptomatic with tonsillopharyngitis. These staff were screened and antibiotic chemoprophylaxis arranged. A piece of equipment (bandage scissors) was also used between patients, subsequently taken out of use. Discussion and/or Conclusion(s): This outbreak highlights the susceptibility of patients receiving wound care. Whilst prevention of transmission from asymptomatic carriage is not always possible, the importance of exclusion or temporary redeployment of healthcare staff with symptomatic infections should be highlighted. Method(s) : A retrospective analysis of cases was carried out. We matched these cases with two case linked controls. Results: Of the nine patients affected, the median age at presentation was 65 years (range 24-77 years). Median time to disease onset was 5.8 years post-transplant (range 0.5-10.4 years). At diagnosis, all patients had a functioning graft with a mean eGFR of 29.3 mL/min (range 15-41 mL/min), significantly lower than controls (70.0 mL/min +/\u221223.5) ( p = 0.0007). There was no significant difference in immunosuppression regimens. All patients were lymphopenic at diagnosis (mean 0.2 \u00d7 10 9 /L), significantly lower than our control population at corresponding time of diagnosis (mean 0.9 \u00d7 10 9 /L) ( p = 0.028). Four patients required mechanical ventilation and two required dialysis. Four patients died within three months of presentation. ",

IFN-\u03b3 \u2212/\u2212 or IFN-\u03b3 receptor IFN-\u03b3R \u2212/\u2212 knockout mice rapidly succumb to tuberculosis. The pathogen has evolved many ways to mitigate the effects of IFN-\u03b3. The down regulation of IFN-\u03b3R on the surface of macrophages is one such strategy. Aim(s)/Objective(s): The objective of the study is to characterize IFN-\u03b3 mediated macrophage responses to mycobacterial infections, key host factors regulating IFN-\u03b3R expression on macrophages in response to M. tb infection and to explore the dichotomy in the profile and susceptibility patterns of this very immunologically relevant cytokine. Method(s): Human THP-1 cell line, murine bone marrow derived macrophages (BMDMs) and human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were used for study. Flow cytometry, confocal imaging and western blots were employed for investigations. Results: Data shows that both M. tb and M. bovis BCG are potent down regulators of IFN-\u03b3R on macrophages. Many host factors and signalling pathways are employed by M. tb to exhibit this phenomenon. TLR pathway specifically, adaptor molecule TRAF6, calcium homeostasis, PKC and MAPK ERK are involved in aiding M. tb mediated receptor down modulation. Also, genes of calcium cysteine protease pathway which were previously identified by our lab and linked to mediating negative immunity against M. tb also regulate IFN-\u03b3R on macrophages in response to M. tb infections. Discussion and/or Conclusion(s): Thus M. tb employs various host factors to elicit its immune suppressive effects to downregulate surface receptor expression of IFN-\u03b3R. By down regulating the receptor levels the pathogen is successfully able to avert the protective effects of IFN-\u03b3.",

            "text": "Background: Staphylococcus aureus is an invasive human pathogen associated with significant mortality. Host-pathogen dynamics during infection are poorly understood but recent work demonstrates that with high dose inocula, an immunological bottleneck allows clonal expansion of few bacteria, which go on to cause abscesses. Models of S. aureus infection are characterized by the requirement for a large bacterial inoculum and the impact of surrounding microflora on S. aureus pathogenicity is under-explored. Aim(s)/Objective(s): To interrogate the clonal expansion phenomenon further and to investigate the need for a large bacterial inoculum to establish S. aureus infection, mixed strain inocula were tested in both the zebrafish embryo and murine models of systemic infection. Results: In both infection models, purified, particulate bacterial cell wall peptidoglycan was able to augment infection by low dose S. aureus but inert particulate beads or solubilised peptidoglycan did not. Commensal bacteria e.g. Micrococcus luteus were also able to augment pathogenesis of low dose S. aureus. In the murine model, the infective dose could be lowered from 10 7 to 10 4 CFU in the presence of these potentiators and the liver appears to be the focal point of loss of immune control. Innate immune dysfunction and chemokine dysregulation have been shown to underpin this augmentation phenomenon. Discussion and/or Conclusion(s): These results have important ramifications regarding human S. aureus disease as it may begin to explain how initiation of infection occurs, as S. aureus primarily enters via a wound or invasive procedure. These data demonstrate that other bacteria (and even their components) enable S. aureus to initiate infection. Trust commenced in 2009 as a patient safety initiative amid reported increased incidence of Surgical Site Infections (SSIs). Before this time, infection incidence was unclear because data collection was not standardised. Aim(s)/Objective(s): We aimed to establish baseline SSI rates in adult cardiac surgery and employ targeted interventions as per Department of Health and National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) best evidence guidelines. This gave us an opportunity to standardise practice and improve patient outcomes, quality, safety and efficiency in line with organisational targets. We also aimed to embed the SSI detailed investigation protocol mirroring the NICE SSI quality standard (2013). Method(s): We developed and established use of local data collection protocols in line with Public Health England recommendations and identified local champions. This strong SSIS leadership helped us to develop a multidisciplinary collaborative approach that eased the burden of data collection and optimised open communication. This enabled us to address potential practice concerns more effectively through a series of initiatives. Results: SSI rates fell from 5.4% in 2009 to 1.1% in 2015 and CABG rates from 6.5% in 2009 to 1.2% in 2015; considerably below the national average (4.7%). We saved an estimated \u00a3706,000 over a 7 year period. Discussion and/or Conclusion(s): The use of local champions and a multidisciplinary collaborative approach enabled us to successfully implement evidence based practice and demonstrate significant reductions in SSI incidence. Background: The most common methods for caesarean section skin closure are metal staples or absorbable sutures. Both oppose skin edges to facilitate wound healing. Staples are regarded as quicker and easier than sutures to use. To date no large study has conclusively demonstrated that staples are associated with an increased risk of SSI. The morbidity associated SSI that may be increased with the use of staples would outweigh the increase in time required for closure with sutures. Aim(s)/Objective(s): To evaluate the risks of surgical site infection (SSI) after caesarean-section wound closure with surgical staples versus absorbable subcuticular suture. Method(s): NHS hospitals in Northern Ireland performing c-sections are mandated to perform prospective SSI surveillance during the inpatient stay and in the community setting. CDC-NHSN definition of SSI was used. Information collected included age, BMI, previous c-sections, ASA-score, urgency of operation, closure used, procedure duration and antibiotic prophylaxis. We compared SSI rates for staple and suture closure, in low transverse C-sections, during 2008-2015. Results: 39,752 C-sections were included; 29,834 received sutures and 9,918 had staples. Of those closed with staples, 0.8% developed an SSI in hospital, compared to 0.4% in the sutures group ( p < 0.001). At the end of community follow-up the incidence was 12.1% in the staple group and 9.3% in the suture group ( p < 0.001). Median operative time was longer in the suture group compared with staples (37 vs. 35 minutes). Discussion and/or Conclusion(s): This is one of the largest studies to demonstrate that staple closure was associated with significantly higher SSI rates compared with suture closure.",

A lack of knowledge and variation in application of guidance had been identified as barriers to implementation of infection prevention practice (IPP) in theatres. To address this we developed an assessment toolkit for systematic evaluation of adherence to IPP across the surgical pathway. Aim(s)/Objective(s): To undertake a pilot study of an assessment toolkit for assuring practice for SSI prevention. Method(s): An assessment framework of seven IPP standards was developed, based on evidence-based guidance and divided into discrete elements. Each element measured standard 'present' and 'applied' and was scored as 2 (compliant), 1 ( partially compliant), 0 (non-compliant). Performance was measured as percentage compliance for each standard. Pilot study participants were recruited by the partnership and chose the theatre specialties to assess. Data was captured on practical problems encountered, ease of application/ interpretation, and omissions. Results: The toolkit was used by seven hospitals in 15 theatres. Overall compliance was 62.1% (range 47.1-88.9%); scores were higher for standard 'applied' (77.4%) than 'defined' (67.3). Compliance scores were highest for instrument asepsis (96%) and lowest for pre-op warming (42%), skin disinfection (55%) and surgical environment (58%). The toolkit was reported as easy to use and valuable for identifying gaps in IPP. Discussion and/or Conclusion(s): This pilot study has demonstrated non-compliance with recommended IPP for surgical patients and found that the assessment tool was valuable for identifying and addressing deficiencies. The toolkit has been revised to incorporate feedback from the pilot study and the final version made available. (9.1%) were organ space. In colon surgery, male sex (OR:1.57,95% CI:1.14-2.15) and stoma (OR:2.65,95%CI:1.8-3.92) were independent risk factors for OE infection while laparoscopic surgery (OR:0.5,95% CI:0.38-0.69) and oral prophylaxis (OR:0.7,95%CI:0.51-0.97) were protective. In rectal surgery, male sex (OR:2.11,95%: CI:1.34-3.31) and surgery duration (OR:1.49,95%CI:1.03-2.15) were independent risk factors for OE infection while oral prophylaxis (OR:0.49,95%CI:0.32-0.73) was protective. Readmission (8.1% vs 4.7%, p 0.001) and length of stay (13d \u00b1 14d vs 11d \u00b1 12d, p < 0.001 were significantly higher in rectal compared to colon surgery. There were no differences in clinical cure and mortality rate between groups. Discussion and/or Conclusion(s): Colon and rectal surgery differ in incidence and risk factors for organ space SSI although clinical cure and mortality rate were no significantly different. Background: Surgical site infections (SSI) account of up to 20% of HCAI, and cost on average \u00a32,100 per case with reports of increased mortality and morbidity. A dedicated SISS Team was introduced in September 2012. All knife-to-skin procedures in in-patients were surveyed, with post discharge surveillance at 30 or 90 days. Aim(s)/Objective(s): To present one Trusts first 3 years results following the introduction a whole system approach to surgical site infection surveillance (SSIS) exceeding national UK expectations. Method(s): Data was collected using a combination of electronic and manual methods in elective and emergency patients excluding day cases. Monthly feedback was given to surgeons on individual SSI rates and by procedure with comparison to specialty performance. Results: From September 12 to September 15 an average of 509 patients per month were surveyed with a total of 18,338 in the period. The SSI rate for confirmed infections fell from 10% to 2.6% during the period with varying results in specialities. A positive impact on length of stay and number of readmissions was also identified. Expanded results will be presented in the poster. Discussion and/or Conclusion(s): Investment in the SSIS Team and procurement of a surveillance system, with subsequent feedback of results has resulted in reductions in SSI. This has impacted positively on Trust resources and patient safety.",

Royal Victoria Infirmary, Newcastle upon Tyne NHS FT Background: Data collected as part of SSI surveillance of spinal infections with a view to improve practice on all fronts to reduce SSI rates. New protocol for antibiotic prophylaxis in spinal surgery was introduced last year and it was agreed at SSI meetings to audit this. Aim(s)/Objective(s): Aim: To audit use of antibiotic prophylaxis in spinal surgeryto look at timing (time difference from KTS), extended dose of antibiotic in operations lasting more than 3 hours and choice of the antibiotic agents used. Data collected as part of SSI surveillance of spinal infections with a view to improve practice. Method(s): Retrospective data collection of various elements of antibiotic prescribing in relation to the antibiotic protocol was carried out for a period of 4 weeks. Results: Data for timing of antibiotic administration in relation to KTS (knife to skin), choice of antibiotics, repeated doses of cephalosprin in prolonged operations and post op antibiotic cover was analysed. Discussion and/or Conclusion(s): Timing of antibiotic administration was poor overall (within 30-60 min of KTS), there was unnecessary administration of antibiotics post op, choice of antibiotics used as per protocol was satisfactory. Detailed analysis of data is being fed back to relevant anaesthetic and surgical teams to help address change in practice.

This study aims to map surgical procedures that have the highest associated SSI burden (in terms of volume, risk and cost) with current surveillance activities to shape current and future surveillance priorities, both on a national and a local level. Method(s): This mapping study compares multiple surgery types by patient volume, infection rate, excess length of stay and excess costs attributable to SSI, proportion of hospitals currently undertaking surveillance, and mean priority ranking as reported in the 2014 PHE survey of Trusts. For the national mapping, the study uses data from Hospital Episode Statistics, SSISS, and from the literature. At a local level, the patient volume, risk, and cost are calculated from laboratory data, patient administrative data and financial data, and these figures compared with local surveillance arrangements. Results: The results are displayed in a matrix using heat mapping. Colour matching along rows indicates a high degree of agreement between risk, burden, cost, and current and future priorities. Caesarean section (CS) has low agreement. Discussion and/or Conclusion(s): There are some significant mismatches between SSI burden and current surveillance, particularly for caesarean section which has a high SSI risk and patient volume but no national surveillance, while many Trusts indicate CS is a priority area.",

Incidence is 1-6% depending on surgical location. Treatment is extremely challenging and involves graft removal, revascularization, debridement and often empirical broad spectrum antibiotics for prolonged courses. Early postoperative grafts are especially at risk. Transient bacteraemia secondary to; poor dental hygiene, skin breakdown/diabetic complications, recurrent urinary-tract infection, constipation, poor general hygiene all pose significant risks to the in-situ graft. Prevention is better than cure! Aim(s)/Objective(s): To develop a patient information leaflet, given to patients at pre-op clinic, to inform, educate and limit the risk of PVGI. Results: A patient information leaflet was constructed clearly stating risks of transient bacteraemia. Specifically encouraging: \u2022 Good general hygiene; good hand hygiene and genitourinary cleanliness (especially if the surgery scar is located in the groin), keeping dressings clean, checking for signs of infection and contacting the GP if concerned, no sharing of personal items like razors/ toothbrushes. \u2022 Maintenance of good skin care: keeping the skin moisturised to prevent cracking, regular diabetic check-ups and good glucose control. \u2022 Maintaining good dental hygiene; preventing plaque build-up, regular dental check-ups, avoiding rinsing after brushing. \u2022 Treatment of genito-urinary infections: good toilet habits and avoiding constipation, keeping hydrated, for males over 60 years old reporting problems that many be prostate related. Discussion and/or Conclusion(s): The simple but effective leaflet addresses a previously neglected area. It gives basic information on maintaining good health after surgery and may help prevent the catastrophic complication of graft surgery in the form of PVGI. Background: While advances have been made in infection control practices, SSIs remain a substantial cause of morbidity, prolonged hospitalization and death. Surveillance of SSI with feedback of appropriate data to surgeons has been shown to be an important component of strategies to reduce SSI risk. A successful surveillance program includes the use of epidemiologically-sound infection definitions and effective surveillance methods, stratification of SSI rates according to risk factors associated with SSI development, and data feedback. Aim(s)/Objective(s): To report the SSIs from PVBY surgeries stratified by risk index. Method(s) : This is a prospective study in which all cases of PVBY surgeries are reported in a special denominator sheet and all infected procedures are reported on numerator sheet. Case definition of health care associated SSI is adopted from National Health Safety Network (NHSN). The study started from January 1st 2015 until December 31st 2015. Cases are stratified by risk index which assigns surgical patients into categories based on the presence of three major risk factors: operation lasting more than the duration cut point, wound class and ASA score.",

Discussion and/or Conclusion ( (2013) (2014) (2015) from immigrants of North and Sub-Saharan Africa resided in African immigrant campus, Tripoli-Libya. The participants were interviewed, and relevant information was collected, including socio-demographic, ethnic, and geographic variables. Each sample was tested for HCV and HIV using ELISA. The genotypes were assigned using specific genotyping assay and correlated with demographic factors. Results: Of the immigrants studied, 1078(7.6%) were positive for HCV, 192(1.4%) HIV and 479(3.4%) for both HCV &HIV. The prevalence of HCV was higher among individuals from Nile river (3.6-18.7%) of North Africa(NA), followed by those from West Africa(WA) (2.1 to 14.1%), Horn of Africa(HOA)(6.8-9.9%) and less among those from Maghreb countries(1.4 to 2.7%). HIV and HCV/HIV co-infection were higher among HOA (60 (1.7%)&175 (5%) and WA (95 (1.9%) & 211(4.2%). Five genotypes were detected including genotypes 4, 1 and 2 accounted for 329(36.1%), 326(35.8%) and 131(14.4%) followed by genotype 3 for 87(9.5%) strains. Genotype 5 was isolated from HOA 18 (2%) and WA 20(2.2%) individuals. The prevalence of HCV, HIV and HCV/HIV co-infection were considered to be high with a unique disparate distribution among African immigrants crossing towards Europe. This should be reflected on the prevention efforts in Europe and North & sub-Saharan Africa. 4% [14.9-21.8 ] (N = 111) for nurses, nursing assistants. The overall coverage was steady for 34% of HCF between 2015 and 2016. Most of the HCF (87%) organized an information campaign. Main topics were influenza vaccination strategy (71%), protective measures (54%). 97% of HCF carried out a vaccination campaign. The organization was shared between Occupational health team (OHT) (43%), ICT (43%), the hospital pharmacy (43%). HCW were vaccinated by their colleagues (53%), OHT (47%), ICT (17%). Posters reminding wearing a mask were present in 79% of HCF, mainly in the hospital entrance. Masks were available in the emergency, maternity and pediatric departments. Discussion and/or Conclusion(s): Despite broad and well-documented vaccination campaigns, the coverage remains low for all HCW categories. Implementing behavioral change in HCW is warranted as well as providing masks and guidance for appropriate use beside vaccination. Antimicrobial susceptibility and genetic analysis of these isolates were determined using 12 different antibiotics and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) to characterize the isolates. spatial-epidemiological analysis was conducted to reflect the changing pattern of A baumannii within the country. Results: The genetic analysis showed eight distinct PFGE patterns varied from one region to another with a significant increase of Clone 1 in West and East regions. The strains showed a high resistance to all antibiotics tested with few strains were sensitive to gentamicin and Carapenems. Discussion and/or Conclusion(s): The emergence and spread of multidrug-resistant A. baumannii among Libyan hospitals care settings suggest an urgent intervention programs to prevent the colonization and infection by resistant pathogens. Aim(s)/Objective(s): To show the burden of HAIs and to introduce a surveillance method. Data on patient characteristics, prevalence of catheters and antimicrobials were also collected. Method(s): 19 municipalities were invited in this voluntary point prevalence survey (PPS) in September 2015. The infection control nurses of the hospitals were instructed to collect the data form the patient charts. The questionnaire (a modification of HALT-2 protocol by ECDC), data analysis and feedback were provided by our study team. Results: Twenty-two hospitals from 16 municipalities participated and collected data on 2218 inpatients. Of these, 48% were receiving acute care, 32% rehabilitation, 18% long-term and 2% terminal care. On the study day, 11% (range by hospital, 4-24%) of the patients had at least one HAI, one-third originating from other hospitals. The most common HAIs included lower respiratory tract infections (24%), urinary tract infections (15%) and skin infections (13%). Fourteen percent had a urine catheter and 18% had a vascular catheter. Twenty-nine percent were receiving least one antimicrobial. The most commonly used antimicrobials were cefuroxime, cefalexin and fluoroquinolones; 41% of the antimicrobials were used for HAI. No MRSA infections were detected. Discussion and/or Conclusion(s): HAI surveillance and prevention in primary care hospitals require improvement in primary care. PPS is an appropriate tool. The prevalence of antimicrobial use was high, especially the fluoroquinolones. Resistant microbes were rare, so far.",

Antibiotics were grouped by class and expressed in defined daily doses (DDD) per 1000 patient-days( pd), from 2009 to 2013. MDRO were grouped into resistant to 3rd generation cephalosporins, carbapenems and oxacillin and compared to carbapenems, polymyxins and glycopeptides use. Hospitals were grouped in private, philanthropic and public. Public hospitals were divided into social organization (SO) or not, the former is privately managed with public funding. Correlation between MDRO incidence and antibiotic use was investigated for 2012 and 2013. Results: Between 2009 and 2013, mean number of reporting hospitals was 198. 35% of reporting hospitals were public and 33% of these were SO. Cephalosporins were the most prescribed drugs, although there was a decreasing trend in the period. Polymyxins had the greatest increase in use (125%), mostly in public hospitals. Among public hospitals, comparing SO and public administration there was a difference in antimicrobial use for glycopeptides, carbapenems and polymyxins ( p = 0.04, 0.008 and 0.001). There was no difference in MDRO incidence. Discussion and/or Conclusion(s): In conclusion, we observed a significant increase in polymyxin use. In the public level, we observed a discrepancy between the incidence of MDRO and broad-spectrum antibiotics use in different administrative regimens. These data should guide public health policies. Results: A total of 439 reports were made between 2001 and 2015, including 114 reports from the operating theatre. The reporting rate fell significantly from 32% (52/164) in Period I to 23% (62/275; p = 0.0036) in Period II. Analysing the contents, rates at intraoperative management and delivery of instruments were significantly reduced from 17% to 12% ( p = 0.015) and from 7% to 3% ( p = 0.015), respectively. Conversely, the rate at equipment disposal showed no change (4%). The rate of hepatitis C virus-positive injuries showed no significant change (Period I, 15%; Period II, 16%), suggesting that the submission rate of reports was largely static. Results after implementation were also similar, comparing the first 5 years with the subsequent 5 years. Background: Observational hand hygiene auditing (OHHA) involves a trained observer monitoring healthcare worker compliance with five identified moments for hand hygiene. The effectiveness of OHHA is uncertain despite widespread adoption. Aim(s)/Objective(s): To examine the effect of OHHA on the incidence of methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and vancomycin resistant enterococci (VRE) bacteraemia. Method(s): We conducted a retrospective time series in four acute hospitals in the Republic of Ireland over the period 2009 to 2014. The OHHA intervention was introduced to three sites in 2011; the fourth site acted as a control and did not introduce OHHA. We compared the change in the incidence of methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) bacteraemia, vancomycin resistant enterococci (VRE) bacteraemia and alcohol based hand gel (ABHR) consumption, in intervention versus control sites. Results: There was a significant reduction in MRSA bacteraemia in the control ( p < 0.01) but not the intervention ( p = 0.77) sites over the study period. When the difference of the differences was compared there was no statistically significant difference ( p = 0.09) between intervention and control sites. There was no significant reduction in VRE bacteraemia in the control ( p = 0.18) or intervention ( p = 0.42) sites. There was a significant increase in ABHR consumption in the intervention ( p = <0.01) sites and a decrease in ABHR consumption in the control ( p = 0.05) site. When the difference of the differences was compared this was not statistically significant ( p = <0.07) in either the intervention or control sites. Discussion and/or Conclusion(s): The implementation of OHHA does not appear to be associated with a reduction in bacteraemia or with an increase in ABHR consumption.",

The Infection Prevention and Control Team (IPCT) formed a group to facilitate the appropriate data collection. Focusing on risk and contributory factors the group aimed to determine if SABs were avoidable or not. All cases were reviewed to ensure they were managed in line with guidance on management of proven or suspected SAB in adults Aim(s)/Objective(s): This initiative aimed to better understand the cause of the SAB, determine the potential avoidance, to intervene to minimize the risk of a SAB occurring due to the same cause again. Method(s): Using the Plan Do Study Act cycle and the national eSAB tool, a surveillance form was created for the IPCT to investigate the SAB. Identifying the entry point, source and record procedures/ interventions in the last 30 days. Assessments were made regarding medical history, device placement, and whether the patient had any prosthetics. For quality improvement the group reviewed the implementation and completion of bundles such as Peripheral, Central Vascular and Urinary Catheter. Discussion and/or Conclusion(s): The IPCT along with the multidisciplinary team discuss the results of the surveillance and identify quality improvement. Audits ar carried out if the SAB is found to be related to a device. IPCT engage with clinical teams to assist with the implementation of bundles and support auditing. Clinicians in charge received a letter detailing the outcome of SAB surveillance, offering the chance to respond to the information.

Aim(s)/Objective(s): To know the incidence of HAIs appeared in our unit during 2015. Method(s): We performed a prospective observational epidemiological study. All patients who remained in the NICU more than 24 hours were included. The classification criteria of HAI were the NEO-KISS. Incidence rates and cumulative incidence of various infections, as well as their confidence intervals were calculated. Results: 118 patients, 65 men and 53 women were studied, and 38% of patients had a weight less than 1500 grams. The incidence density overall was 11.7 per thousand stays, and accumulated incidence in 17.8% patients, bacteremia associated central venous catheter 9.3 per thousand catheter days, I am not going no pneumonias associated with mechanical ventilation. Preterm infants less than 1000 grams had the highest infection rate 24.5%. The most frequent germ were Escherichia coli. Discussion and/or Conclusion(s): The most frequent bacteremia infection has been associated with central venous catheter 8.2 per thousand catheters day. The OR of having a HAIs according to weight at birth is 13 for those under 1000 grams compared to children of 2,500 grams or more. In relation to infection and sex, we found that men have a slightly higher risk of infection women, 27.1% versus 17%. Background: Irish Public hospitals receive annual block funding based on historical spending and activity patterns, without explicit adjustment for the rate of hospital acquired infection. Aim(s)/Objective(s): We aimed to ascertain additional financial cost per routine case of Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) and the cost of a CDI outbreak in our hospital. Method(s): A micro-costing approach was used to estimate the additional cost of CDI per patient identified during August 2015 and for a CDI outbreak managed that month. Resource use was quantified based on review of patient charts, pharmacy prescribing data, prospective collection of administrative resource input, and records of cleaning expenditure. Results: The additional cost of routine (non-outbreak) CDI in 13 inpatients in August was \u20ac75,680 (mean \u20ac5,820/patient) with cleaning, pharmaceuticals, and additional length of stay (LOS) being key cost drivers. Additional LOS ranged from 1.75 days to 22.55 days. Seven patients were involved in a CDI outbreak. Bed closures (58 lost bed days, estimated value \u20ac34,585), five outbreak control meetings (mean staff cost/meeting \u20ac546, aggregate cost \u20ac2,728), and additional outbreak-related cleaning (costing \u20ac9,654) represented the additional CDI outbreak-associated costs. Excluding the value of lost bed days, outbreak costs were \u20ac12,382. Therefore total spending on CDI during August was \u20ac88,062 (a mean of \u20ac6,773 across all patients). Discussion and/or Conclusion(s): Investment in disease prevention may be offset by cost savings. This analysis suggests that investment in C. difficile prevention could offer a net financial benefit in some circumstances, as well as improving value for money and clinical outcomes. Method(s) : 171 EMRSA-15 isolates sampled between 1985 and 2015 across Birmingham were whole genome sequenced and VNTR typed. WGS data was mapped to the reference strain HO50960412 and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) from the core genome were used to generate a phylogenetic tree using Bayesian phylogenetics. VNTR data was generated by PCR amplification of 7 tandem repeat loci. Results: 5082 SNP-sites were used to construct a phylogenetic tree revealing a distinct clade of 91 (52%) isolates (BHM clade) that diverged from the rest of the Birmingham population in 1995. The remaining 80 isolates were more diverse with a wider range of divergence dates (1986 to 2015) . Variation in repeat number was only observed at loci L13, L16 and L21, with L21 and L16 showing the highest variability. Mapping of VNTR data onto the tips of the tree revealed that all isolates with two tandem repeats at L13 (n = 91) mapped to the BHM clade while isolates with 3, 4 or 5 tandem repeats were dispersed throughout the rest of the tree. Discussion and/or Conclusion(s): WGS provides a high degree of discrimination amongst the Birmingham isolates, highlighting the presence of a highly related clade, which is identifyable by a specific repeat number at one loci with VNTR. Results: 90 cases were reviewed; 59 (65%) were female; average age 72 with range 0-97 and mode 88; 39 (43%) were \u226580 years old; 13 (14%) were care home residents; the commonest source of the bacteraemia was urinary -54 (60%); 77 had dehydration status recorded on admission; 13 (20%) of the patients admitted from home were recorded as dehydrated compared with 5 (38%) of the patients admitted from care homes; 24 of the patients with urosepsis had been seen by their GP. Five of these patients had received an antibiotic to which their isolate was sensitive; 5 had received an antibiotic to which their isolate was resistant; only two of the admissions followed a urinary catheter change; in 7, an alternative diagnosis had been made and urosepsis not considered; in the remainder, there was no information available. Discussion and/or Conclusion(s): Prevention of admissions due to E coli bacteraemia should focus on the elderly and on measures to prevent urosepsis. However only 24 (44%) of the patients with urosepsis had seen their GP before admission and only in 5 of these might there have been an opportunity to prevent admission if the correct antibiotic was used. The study does reinforce that it is important to match antibiotic formularies to local sensitivities. were female, and 93% had risk factors for complications. 38% had received the seasonal flu vaccination. In 2014-2015 60% had Influenza A (6 H3; 3 not-typed), and 40% Influenza B (one patient had both). In 2015-16, 93% were Influenza A (11 H1; 1 H3; 2 not-typed) and 7% Influenza B. Median time to sampling from admission was 4 days (IQR2-6). Length of inpatient stay was 11 days (6-16), and length of ITU admission 17 days (IQR10-28). Repeat respiratory sampling was performed at day 5 in 51%, with 52% remaining positive, and day 10 in 65%, with 21% remaining positive. All patients received Oseltamivir, median duration 6 days (IQR5-9) with 13 (45%) receiving a prolonged course or escalation to Zanamivir (Nebulised/Intravenous) due to ongoing symptoms. An Oseltamivir resistant mutation (E119V) was detected in 1 of 3 patients tested. 5/29 (17%) patients died during the illness. Discussion and/or Conclusion(s): Results suggest an urgent need to improve vaccination uptake. Equally, they highlight the importance of increased clinical suspicion and speed of diagnostic sampling, as well as repeat sampling to demonstrate response to antivirals and timely instigation of resistance testing. Background: Some samples with a positive Influenza A matrix result presented without an H1N1 or H3N2 subtype in our routine one tube multiplex. None were associated with travel or especially severe disease so H5N1 or other more virulent subtypes were not suspected. Aim(s)/Objective(s): We investigated to determine the 'unknown' subtypes as part of pandemic planning. Method(s): Samples reported to be Influenza A without subtype by the clinical laboratory between May 1 st and August 14th 2015 were further interrogated with singleplex assays. Haemagglutinin sequences were compared with online sequences collected in 2015 (GISAID). Results: Of 925 Influenza reports, 66 were reported as Influenza A with subtype undetermined. These cases first appeared on May 4 th , reached a peak at 5 cases per run in mid June and then faded away with the last one on August 14 th . In 38 of these 66 the ct was considered so weak that a mismatch between matrix and subtype could be expected. Of the remaining 28 one was H3N2 but 27 were identified as H1N1 with mutations affecting both primers and the probe but still within the pdm09-lineage; 16 clustered with A/Bangladesh/4001/2015 A /H1N1. Discussion and/or Conclusion(s): Investigation of unbalanced results enabled us to witness a wave of imported influenza which may be connected with the numerous immigrant Bangladeshi workers in Singapore. It is a reminder of the normal movement of influenza and its potential for unseen global travel. The mutations are expected to interfere with the WHO recommended primers/probe; one mutation is in the probe and two in the reverse primer region. Background: According to official data, infections after delivery in Poland are rare. Aim(s)/Objective(s): The objective of this study was the assessment of perinatal antibiotic consumption as a method to verify some official data on infections in an obstetric patient population. Method(s) : For the evaluation of perinatal antibiotic consumption, data on the antibiotics purchased in outpatient care were used (years 2012-2013). The analysis took into consideration antibiotic prescriptions within 30 days from the date of delivery. In order to evaluate the consumption of antibiotics, daily defined dose (DDD) per 100 deliveries was used. Results: In the analyzed period, 68,088 deliveries were recorded in the Ma\u0142opolska province, out of which 56.5% were vaginal and 43.5% by cesarean section. The average length of hospital stay was 4.1 days. In this group, 7.4% of women purchased antibiotics as part of the outpatient obstetric care. The average consumption of antibiotics in studied population was 108.3 DDD. Increased consumption of antibiotics was observed in case of C-sections, among the youngest patiens and the patients from the countryside. Discussion and/or Conclusion(s): According to official data in years 2013-2014, fewer than one patient per 100 births by C-sections developed a surgical site infection. According to the Polish PPS data, rate of all forms of infections among obstetric patients was 1.2%. These ratios are much lower than the literature data for this patient population (5-7%). Presented results of antibiotic consumption show that surveillance of infections in this population poses a challenge for infection control teams and staff looking after the patients in Poland.",

            "text": "A retrospective analysis of contact screening for pulmonary and non-pulmonary tuberculosis cases in Lothian, Scotland Millicent Goodwin 1 , Eleanor Strong 1 , Ceri McSparron 2 , Susan Vaughan 2 , Janet Stevenson 2 , Adam T Hill 2 , Ian F Laurenson 2 . 1 University of Edinburgh, 2 Lothian TB service, Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh Background: The NICE tuberculosis clinical guideline (NG33) update in January 2016 amended guidance to only offering screening to contacts of patients with pulmonary or laryngeal TB. The revision was to \"limit testing to contacts of people with potentially infectious TB\" suggesting that non-pulmonary TB (NPTB) infection did not pose such a risk. Aim(s)/Objective(s): To assess the possible impact of the changed guidance. Method(s): Outcomes of contact screening pulmonary (PTB) and NPTB cases within Lothian prior to the guideline amendment were assessed by reviewing records of patients with PTB or NPTB and their contacts over an 8 year period (2008-2015 inclusive) within Lothian, Scotland. All contacts were screened for latent and active infection using a combination of IGRA testing, chest Xrays, and tuberculin skin testing. Results: 1502 contacts of PTB cases and 519 contacts of NPTB cases were successfully screened. 142 (9.45%) contacts of PTB cases had latent TB infection, whilst 27 (1.80%) had active TB infection. In contrast, 67 (12.91%) of NPTB contacts had latent TB infection, and 13 (2.50%) were considered to have active TB. Latent TB was identified more frequently in NPTB contacts ( p = 0.03) but no difference in active TB cases ( p = 0.3). Discussion and/or Conclusion(s): These results demonstrate that NPTB in addition to PTB is an excellent target for screening as significant case finding of both latent and active TB cases are identified. This study provides clear evidence that not screening contacts of NPTB cases will hinder Scotland achieving the WHO target of elimination of TB by 2050. Background: Surgical patients are one of the most common patient groups acquiring nosocomial bloodstream infections (BSI). Since the risk of BSI is related to length of hospital stay, BSI rates are usually reported by patient-days. However, the risk likely varies by patient characteristics and operation types. Aim(s)/Objective(s): We evaluated the risk and outcome of BSIs following surgery by different operation types. Method(s): Data on BSI cases was collected in Helsinki University Hospital (1922 beds) during 2009-2014 as a part of the national hospital-wide surveillance for nosocomial BSIs and the number of operations was obtained from the hospital database. Unit of pediatric surgery was excluded. Results: A total of 711 BSIs (29% of all nosocomial BSIs) following 427518 operations were identified; 244 (34%) were related to intensive care. The rate was highest in cardiovascular (8.7/1000 operations) and urogenital (3.6/1000) surgery and lowest in gynecology (1.0/1000) and orthopedics (1.2/1000). Of the BSIs, 347 (49%) were primary and 364 (51%) secondary. Surgical site infection was the most common source of secondary BSIs. The most common pathogens in primary BSIs were coagulase negative staphylococci (16%) and Staphylococcus aureus (14%) and in secondary BSIs S. aureus (26%) and Escherichia coli (20%). 28-day case fatality ranged from 0% in gynecology/ obstetrics to 21% in cardiovascular surgery. Discussion and/or Conclusion(s): Risk and outcome of BSI varied considerably by operation type, most likely partly related to patients' underlying illnesses. Besides surgical site infections, remarkable proportion of BSIs was associated to central lines, providing an additional focus for preventive efforts. Background: In recent years, carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (CR-Kp) has become endemic in Italy and effective strategies are needed to reduce its burden in the hospital setting, particularly in high risk wards. Aim(s)/Objective(s): To assess the effect of intensified infection control measures, including active surveillance of gastrointestinal colonized patients, on reducing the circulation of CR-Kp and the incidence of the CR-Kp bloodstream infection in the intensive care units (ICUs), equipped with nearly 40 beds, of the tertiary 1,300 acute-care beds regional referral center university hospital, I.R.C.C.S. AOU San Martino-IST of Genoa, Liguria region, north-west Italy. Method(s): The intervention effect was analyzed with interrupted time series regression analysis. The study included a pre-intervention period (January 2009 -December 2011) and an intervention period (January 2013 -December 2015). During 2012, intensified control measures, particularly routine rectal screening, were implemented and reached high level of adherence. Monthly incidence of first positive culture result for CR-Kp, either including or excluding rectal swab, and CR-Kp BSI were compared. Results: Preliminary results demonstrated that the incidence of first positive culture results for CR-Kp, including rectal swab, significantly decreased in the intervention period compared with pre-intervention period (slope: \u22120.15; p-value: <0.05). A similar result was obtained also excluding rectal swab (slope: \u22120.17; p-value: 0.005). A decreasing trend, even though not statistically significant, was observed for the incidence of CR-Kp BSI (slope: \u22120.08; p-value: 0.11).",

Aim(s)/Objective(s): This is a prospective study conducted to detect HAIs according to CDC definition, main infection sites, common microorganisms, mortality rate and risk factors such as age and length of stay. Method(s): This study was carried out in a neurology department, faculty of medicine, Mansoura University, Egypt, from January 2014 to December 2015. Isolation, identification and antimicrobial susceptibility were carried out. An outbreak of UTI due to Candida species was detected and RFLP was done for typing and tracing source of infection. Results: Elderly patients and those having prolonged length of hospital stay were at higher risk of acquiring HAIs. Higher mortality rate was associated with patients having HAIs, blood stream infection, mechanical ventilation and low Glasgow Coma Scale. HAIs were detected in 413 samples. The three most commonly reported organisms were Klebsiella pneumoniae 107 (26%), followed by Candida spp 67 (16%) and MRSA 65 (15.7%). Regarding site of infection, urinary tract infection was the commonest site 185 (44.8%) followed by respiratory tract infection 90 (21.8%), blood stream infection 73 (17.7%) and wound infection 65 (15.7%). Imipenem was the most effective antibiotic against Gram negative bacteria. Vancomycin and imipenem were found to be the most effective against Gram positive bacteria. Discussion and/or Conclusion(s): HAIs prevention represents a real challenge to minimize HAIs limiting mortality, antibiotic resistance and outbreak emergence.",

There is increasing evidence that glycopeptide resistance, particularly to teicoplanin is increasing in CoNS. Aim(s)/Objective(s): This is a retrospective analysis to evaluate teicoplanin and vancomycin susceptibilities in CoNS isolates from sterile site samples. Method(s): All CoNS isolates from sterile site samples submitted to our laboratory between January 2013 and April 2015 were evaluated. A total of 846 CoNS were isolated during that period. The majority of the isolates were from blood cultures (49.5%), orthopaedic (bone, joint and wound) samples (27.7%), peritoneal dialysis fluid (6.6%) and sternum (5%). Etest strips were used to determine teicoplanin MICs. Vancomycin susceptibilities were initially performed using Etest strips.

At the Royal Free Hospital, universal CS is performed for Intensive Care Unit (ICU) patients and risk-based CS is performed for private, renal, liver, haematology, infectious diseases (ID), stroke and oncology patients. Aim(s)/Objective(s): To review the number of patients screened for carbapenemase-producing organisms (CPO) and cases detected. Method(s): The laboratory information system was searched for all CS samples between July 2013 and December 2015. CS was performed using broth enrichment cultures containing imipenem discs until December 2013 and chromID CARBA (Biomerieux) from January 2014 onwards. Suspected CPOs were confirmed by the reference laboratory. Results: CS was performed for 25,787 samples from 7,520 patients, with an average of three samples per patient (median = 2, IQR = 1-4). The majority of samples were from ICU (52%), private (15%) and renal (12%) patients. From the 7,520 patients screened, 44 (0.59%) new cases of CPO were identified. Detection rates per patient screened were: 0.49% (ICU); 1.16% ( private); 0.12% (renal); 2.17% (haematology); 0.55% liver; 0% (stroke, oncology and ID); 0.82% (other specialties). Detection rates per patient screened increased significantly from 12/3145 (0.38%) in 2014 to 29/3685 (0.8%) in 2015 (OR = 2.07, 95%CI = 1.02-4.46, p = 0.031). Discussion and/or Conclusion(s): The cost-effectiveness of implementing CS is unknown. The yield from CS of high-risk patients in our hospital is currently low, however detection rates have increased significantly over the last two years. CS of high-risk patients is important due to the increased risk of infection associated with high mortality.",

A major component of the economic cost due to health care associated infections can be captured my measuring the additional length of stay (LOS) due to these infections. Aim(s)/Objective(s): The preference for modelling LOS instead of monetary valuation of hospital cost stems from a belief that many decisions about healthcare investments are made in the short term where most financial expenditures are made for costs which are fixed. However, estimating excess LOS due to HAI is complicated due to the fact an infection increases duration of hospital stay but at the same time risk of infection increases with duration of stay. This problem of endogenous variables can potentially be addressed by using appropriate statistical methods. Method(s): This systematic review examined papers in PubMed published between 1997 and 2016 and identified English language studies that estimated increased LOS due to HAIs. Results: The methodological approaches used in the literature to estimate excess LOS due to HAIs include case reviews, matched comparisons and regression analyses. The choice of estimation methodologies can affect the accuracy of the resulting estimates and due to that estimates of LOS varied widely between studies reviewed. Studies examining LOS attributed to HAI varied considerably in design and data collected. Discussion and/or Conclusion(s): This review summarises the most recent statistical methodologies and the message is that a robust application of these can address key gaps in our understanding of HAIs and their effects on healthcare. Background: Antimicrobial resistant (AMR) infectious complications following transrectal ultrasound (TRUS)-guided prostate biopsy are increasing, and include urinary tract infection (UTI) and bloodstream infection (BSI). Aim(s)/Objective(s): A prospective multi-disciplinary local infection surveillance programme was established for men undergoing prostate biopsy and results of the first two years (2014-2015) are described. Method(s): Ciprofloxacin is standard prophylaxis. Intravenous gentamicin is added if risk factors are identified from pre-procedure AMR assessment. A man representing with suspected infection is investigated and managed according to the local guideline. UTI and BSI surveillance within 15 days of biopsy, using European (ECDC) definitions is performed. Rates are expressed per 100 biopsies. Root cause analysis (RCA) is completed for confirmed UTI or BSI. Results and interventions are discussed at biannual team meetings. Results: The rate of microbiologically-confirmed infections per 100 biopsies decreased by 26% from 1.534 (2014) to 1.133 (2015) , with E. coli the causative pathogen in 100% and 78% non-susceptible to ciprofloxacin. There was a contemporaneous 62% increase in the rate of microbiologically-unconfirmed infections from 1.227 to 1.983, despite 100% compliance with sending blood cultures and urine. No man who represented with suspected infection had gentamicin added to ciprofloxacin prophylaxis, as AMR risks were not evident preprocedure. Discussion and/or Conclusion(s): Implementation of an AMR risk assessment, robust infection surveillance and management processes and RCA led to a 26% reduction in infection. The contemporaneous increase in non-microbiologically confirmed infections, despite full compliance with testing, warrants further investigation. Background: Invasive Candida infection is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Standardised surveillance programmes for such infections are limited. Aim(s)/Objective(s): To investigate incidence of Candida species isolated from blood and cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) over a five year period. Method(s): A retrospective review was conducted between January 2011 -December 2015 of blood and CSF resullts where Candida species was isolated, antifungal susceptibility and patient outcomes. Results: Candida was cultured from blood (n = 75) and CSF (n = 4) of 79 patients. Nine patients had documented recurrent infections. The average time of positive culture was day 28 of admission. Male and females were equally affected. The average age was 55 years (range 16 to 91 years). Ten patients (13%) were in critical care at time of culture.",

Cases were of nosocomial origin, caused by a dominant clone (Iberian clone), which produced outbreaks, especially in intensive care units, and serious infections associated with invasive devices. The implementation of an intensive control program resulted initially in a significant decrease in new MRSA cases, but an upward trend was observed during last years explained partially by clone replacement and changes in the clinical epidemiology of MRSA. Aim(s)/Objective(s): To determine the current clinical epidemiology of MRSA cases over a period of 15 years in a tertiary care hospital. Method(s): Prospective surveillance of MRSA cases reported daily by the Microbiology Service: Collection of systematic information, regarding acquisition and sample source. Implementation of a control program based in active surveillance, contact precautions and decolonisation. Results: From 2000 to 2015, 6.714 MRSA cases were identified. Most significant changes regarding clinical epidemiology between periods were as follows: Rate of cases detected by active surveillance cultures (35% vs 63%); nosocomial acquisition (69% vs 13% of cases), incidence rate of nosocomial MRSA clinical samples (0.42 vs 0.16/1,000 patientsday), and incidence rate of nosocomial bacteraemia (0.12 vs 0.02 /1,000 patients-day). Discussion and/or Conclusion(s): A significant reduction of nosocomial MRSA transmission and nosocomial MRSA bacteraemia cases were observed throughout the study period. A surveillance program of MRSA including implementation of a multifaceted infection control program was essential to reduce nosocomial rates in our center. Results: We found that from 2012/13 to 2015/16 cases of E. coli BSI fell by 0.21% from 481 to 469 per year however the case rate rose from 118 to 145 per 100,000 occupied bed days. The average age of cases was lower at RFH than at BCF: 67 versus 70 years for pre-48 hour cases and 61 versus 75 years for post-48 hours cases (both p < 0.001). There was a decreasing trend in the proportion of post-48 hour cases at BCF (9.8% to 5.1%, p = 0.004) and a non-significant increasing trend at RFH (12.1% to 16.6%, p = 0.088). On multi-variate analysis, compared to BCF, cases at RFH were more often associated with augmented care (OR = 5.25,95%CI:3.53-7.80,p < 0.001), non-A&E/ medical/geriatric specialties (OR = 2.47,95%CI:1.96-3.11,p < 0.001), non-emergency admission (OR = 1.78,95%CI:1.78-2.69,p = 0.006), and post-48 hour onset (OR = 1.54,95%CI:1.07-2.24,p = 0.021). Discussion and/or Conclusion(s): Analysis of E. coli BSI by Trust site revealed differences in epidemiology that will be important considerations in planning measures to reduce cases. Results: From 2011/12-2015/16 E. coli BSI cases varied between 214 and 246 per year, however the proportion that were likely to be or possibly healthcare associated infections (HCAI) fell 30% from 53% to 37% (chi-squared test for trend: p < 0.001). On multivariate analysis, compared to \"community\" cases with no contact with the hospital in the previous three months, the proportion of HCAI cases was significantly higher in cases diagnosed on day 0-1 of admission but with previous contact with the hospital within three months (OR = 10.38, 95%CI:6.86-15.71), and in cases diagnosed on day 2 of admission onwards (OR = 15.94, ). For the 488 (43%) HCAI cases, the following year-on-year trends were seen: decreasing association with vascular access device use ( p = 0.02), and increasing associations with other invasive device use ( p < 0.002), catheter use ( p = 0.006), surgery or other invasive procedures (p < 0.001). Discussion and/or Conclusion(s): Factors associated with E. coli BSI HCAI are changing. Further investigation by root cause analysis will be required to determine what proportion of E. coli BSI HCAI may be preventable. Background: The shifting genetic background of methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) requires the regular update of the PCR based rapid detection assays. The Research-Use-Only Xpert MRSA NxG is a new Cepheid assay designed to be highly effective at detecting current MRSA isolates in nasal swabs without requiring cold room storage and with a long shelf life. detected by all media. A total of 40, 48, 47 and 43 CPE were detected on MacI, MacD, MacC ESBL and TSB broth respectively. Sensitivity was highest for MacD (96%) (94%). Specificity was maximum for MacI (97%). The performance of media varied with carbapenem MIC and carbapenemase gene associated with CPE isolate. Discussion and/or Conclusion(s): No single method is 100% sensitive and specific for CPE detection. The choice depends on type of carbapenemase gene prevalent locally. Combination of media increases the sensitivity and specificity.",

Aim(s)/Objective(s): To better understand how to reduce the scale of HAI epidemic spread we compared and explored the characteristics of patient transfer patterns in the French healthcare network to identify their potential role in epidemic spread of HAIs within the network. Method(s): Three patient transfer networks were compared: two with only HAI related patients (a specific and a more sensitive definition), and all transferred patients. We assessed network characteristics, computed centrality, community measures, and compared these networks to Erdos-Renyi random models and to networks with randomly selected patients. Results: More than 10 million patient transfers were recorded in France in 2014 for 2.3 million patients, building a network of 2063 hospitals and 50026 connections. The network of specific-HAI patients was composed of 1266 hospitals and 3722 connections for 13627 patient transfers, while the suspected-HAI network was composed of 1975 hospitals and 18812 connections for 128681 patient transfers. These networks displayed a scale-free structure for hospital's number of connections (in and out), and transfers. They also feature a smallworld characteristic. Communities within the networks had small average inner distances between 22km to 88km, depending on the modularity of the community detection algorithms. Discussion and/or Conclusion(s): These characteristics may have a tremendous effect on the diffusion of nosocomial pathogens. In addition, different patient inclusion criteria could impact network characteristics and the identification of key hospital centres, patient flow trajectories, and regional clustering that may serve as a basis for novel wide-scale HAI control strategies.",

Aim(s)/Objective(s): This study's aim was to assess the accuracy of ICD-10 codes for infectious diseases diagnoses and recording of antimicrobial resistance. Method(s): The ICD-10 codes from 100 discharges in the Regional Infectious Diseases Unit, Western General Hospital, Edinburgh starting on June 1 st 2015 were recorded. Corresponding discharge letters were reviewed to verify the accuracy of the codes. Microbiological records of the admission were checked to confirm that all relevant information had been recorded on the discharge letter. Results: Sixty-eight discharges had appropriate ICD-10 codes relating to the discharge letter. Of the 32 inappropriate codes 21 were incomplete, 8 were inaccurate, 2 were unconfirmed diagnosis and one diagnosis had not been coded. On reviewing the microbiology 16 results were unrecorded in discharge letters that would impacted the ICD-10 codes. Sixteen of the pathogens identified were resistant to one or more antibiotics. However, only 2 of the discharge diagnoses mentioned antimicrobial resistance and no ICD-10 resistance codes were used. Discussion and/or Conclusion(s): Although a small sample size, this audit highlights that the use of hospital ICD-10 databases for epidemiological surveillance of infectious diseases diagnoses and antimicrobial resistance would not currently give an accurate picture. There are areas where the ICD code format could be improved to allow for adequate representations of infectious diseases diagnoses including recording of the clinical impact of antimicrobial resistance. Increased awareness in doctors of the coding process and education of the coders is recommended.",

Aim(s)/Objective(s): The goal of the application is reconstructing the most likely paths of infection and classifying places and individuals into different risk groups. We study the time-varying structure of contacts reconstructed from the data sets collected in Polish and Swedish hospitals. We will apply theory of temporal networks to improve computer-assisted hospital infection analyses. Method(s): The algorithm processes data from the register of patient admissions and discharges from each hospital unit (wards, clinics, etc.), microbiological laboratory test results and medical staff register. The patients' structure of contacts ( persons who had visited the same care facility) and functional paths are reconstructed. Epidemiological models are implemented on a temporary network of contacts (where each link can provide a path for the pathogen transmission). Results: In a preliminary setup, we analysed only one alarm pathogen: MRSA. With simulated infection paths, we were able to compute network measures for patients. We obtained the risk of getting infected, based on the patient's incoming connections, and the risk of spreading infections resulting from outgoing connections (both analogous to Google algorithm). Discussion and/or Conclusion(s): We provide a costless preventive computer-assisted tool against HAI. The biggest effort from hospital administration is mapping hospital topology, entered manually by a hospital employee. Later on, data is imported from hospital information system. The results of the algorithms are presented 'real-time' to an hospital epidemiologist for interpretation and applying preventive control. Background: A substantial and sustained increased incidence of invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) has been observed across the North East of England (NEE) from April 2014, reversing the decline that Background: Invasive meningococcal disease (IMD) in the UK is predominantly due to serogroup B, with the burden of disease among children under 5 years. In September 2015, the UK implemented a targeted serogroup B vaccine, Bexsero \u00ae , into the national childhood immunisation schedule at 2, 4 and 12 months. Aim(s)/Objective(s): To design and implement a genomic scheme for rapid and scalable surveillance of vaccine antigens in response to this selection pressure. Method(s): All culture-confirmed IMD isolates (n = 2016) from 2010-11 to 2013-14 from UK (Meningitis Research Foundation Meningococcus Genome Library) and Republic of Ireland were included. Whole genome sequences were hosted on PubMLST Neisseria public database (http://pubmlst.org/neisseria/). A novel Bexsero \u00ae Antigen Sequence Type (BAST) scheme was implemented and used to analyse the presence of vaccine antigens (fHbp, NadA, NHBA and PorA). Results: There were 1966 isolates for which BAST was determined, with 647 unique BASTs. The nine most frequently occurring BASTs accounted for 39.4% of all isolates (n = 775). BAST was strongly associated with clonal complex (Cramer's V 0.946). BASTs were largely stable over time, except for the increase in clonal complex 11 associated BAST-2. The 14 most frequent BASTs were present in all areas, but there was variation in the prevalence of BASTs between the four geographic regions. Discussion and/or Conclusion(s): The Meningitis Research Foundation Meningococcus Genome Library is a publicly available, online repository of IMD isolates, facilitating high resolution analysis of bacterial genomes. The presence of a few predominant BASTs with temporal and geographical stability, suggests that use of the associated vaccine antigens could provide high vaccine coverage.",

            "text": "Conor Bowman, Damien Mack, Robin Smith, Susan Hopkins. Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust Background: In England, from 2010 to 2014, Klebsiella and E. coli bloodstream infections (BSI) rose 21% and 16% across England. The UK government ambition is to half preventable Gram-negative BSI by 2020. Aim(s)/Objective(s): To identify the differences between these two pathogen BSIs to allow focused interventions to be developed. Method(s): All Klebsiella or E. coli BSI at a university teaching hospital between 1/1/2014 and 31/12/2016 were extracted from the laboratory information management system. Clinical data was extracted from the patient clinical records and hospital administration system. A hospital-acquired BSI (HABSI) was defined as onset \u2265 day 3 of the hospital admission. Results: In 2014-2015, 458 E. coli and 172 Klebsiella BSI were detected. Patients with E. coli were less likely to be male (50% v 61%) and were older (median age 72y V 64y) than those with Klebsiella BSI. The greatest burden of HAI occurred in E. coli compared to Klebsiella (126 V 84 patients); though 48% of all Klebsiella were HABSI compared to 28% of E. coli. The top two commonest sources of BSI were urinary tract (E. coli 46% V Klebsiella 28%) and hepatobiliary (21% for both bacteria) infections. Preventable infections were assessed as very likely or possibly for 36% of E. coli and 47% of Klebsiella BSI, predominantly related to devices, procedures or inappropriate initial antibiotic therapy. Discussion and/or Conclusion(s): There are significant demographic and clinical differences between E. coli and Klebsiella BSI. However targeting device insertion and care, surgical prophylaxis and empiric treatment guidelines could reduce these HABSI. Background: The new case number in Papua, easternmost part of Indonesia Archipelago is remained stable although so many efforts of leprosy elimination programs were carried out. It shows that the transmission of Mycobacterium leprae is actively happen. Aim(s)/Objective(s): Aims of this study are to detect Mycobacterium leprae using Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) in asymptomatic household contact in order to observe the transmission of Mycobacterium leprae in early stage before the clinical manifestation and to observe the risk factors of transmission. Method(s): This is cross sectional with descriptive design study. Sample population were 35 symtomatic leprosy patients and 4 asymptomatic household contacts for each patient. Environment factors that observed are periode of living with the patient, intencity and number of person in a house. The nasal swab, skin silt and blood samples was collected from all subjects. The DNA was extracted from nasal and skin silt. Results: Thirty five leprosy patients and 107 asymptomatic household contacts were recruited as subjects in this study. The result show that Mycobacterium leprae can be detect on 100% leprosy patients and 19,62% of household contact using PCR. Risk factors that statistically significant associated with transmission of Mycobacterium leprae is the period of living together with leprosy patients (P: 0,002). Discussion and/or Conclusion(s): The conclusion of this study is PCR can be used to detect Mycobacterium leprae in household contact without clinical cardinal sign as well as in leprosy patients with cardinal sign. The risk factors that influence the transmission of Mycobacterium leprae is the period of living together. Background: Admission is recommended for all imported Plasmodium falciparum infections, despite studies in UK specialist and district settings claiming safe selective-outpatient management. We established admission criteria at Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Woolwich for P. falciparum and present potential benefits to outpatient management in a UK district general hospital and barriers to implementation. Aim(s)/Objective(s): We aim to determine whether it is possible to implement an ED risk-assessment protocol for outpatient management of adult, uncomplicated P. falciparum infection safely. Objectives are to determine appropriate referral, audit documentation of outpatient/admission criteria and ascertain whether outpatient P. falciparum management is a rational pursuit. Method(s): Patient notes were gathered for adults with P. falciparumpositive blood films between 01/08/2014 and 31/11/15 ( protocol implementation from 01/03/2015) and searched retrospectively for documentation of criteria used to determine uncomplicated infection and suitability for outpatient management. Results: During the study period, 52 adults were diagnosed with P. falciparum with 42.3%(22/54) eligible for outpatient management. 25.0%(13/52) had a heart rate >120 on admission, 17.3%(9/52) a parasitaemia of >2% and 13.5%(7/52) associated AKI. Of the 13 patients suitable for outpatient management after pathway implementation, 0 were referred to outpatient services. All had uneventful admissions. Average admission was 2.05 days; 29 hospital-bed-days could have been saved with appropriate outpatient referral-pathway use. Discussion and/or Conclusion(s): Improved staff education and referral-pathway awareness is required to assess the true feasibility of outpatient P. falciparum management; in theory it could save QEH 32 hospital-bed-days/year (approximately \u00a312,800). Eligibility criteria were well-documented and suitable patients made quick recovery. High-powered, multi-centre studies are necessary to establish statistical safety.",

            "text": "Discussion and/or Conclusion(s): C. cayetanensis is a coccidian protozoan parasite. The diarrhoea is usually self-limiting, but can be prolonged (lasting weeks to months if untreated), copious, and explosive. Transmission occurs by ingestion of contaminated food and water. It is endemic in many countries including Mexico. Outbreaks occur because the oocysts are resistant to standard water chlorination treatments. Standard laboratory procedures for OCPs do not detect Cyclospora. The laboratory should be notified that Cyclospora is considered. Special techniques to identify Cyclospora include acid-fast stains, safranin stains, and lactophenol cotton blue stains. Public Health England 3 recommends that returning travelers from Mexico with diarrhoea are tested for Cyclospora. Positive cases should be reported to PHE and samples referred to the Cryptosporidium Reference Unit in Swansea for confirmation and typing. Background: Cutaneous myiasis caused by the tumbu fly Cordylobia anthropophagia in the African tropics and the bot fly Dermatobia hominis in Latin America is a common well reported skin complaint both of travellers and residents of endemic areas. The British Army frequently exercises overseas, and in particular soldiers exercising in the Belize jungle are at risk of developing bot fly infestation. While the larvae can be easy to remove in the early stages, late instars, particularly of Dermatobia hominis often require surgical removal. We developed a novel porcine model of botfly removal to aid in the training of medical staff deploying on exercises in areas with endemic cutaneous myiasis. Commercially obtained maggots were inserted under the skin of a pig's trotter which had been prepared to replicate a typical lesion. Students received a lecture on cutaneous myiasis, including a video and photos of removal, before having multiple attempts at the practical, safe removal of larvae from the botfly model using a cruciform incision and simple surgical tools under supervision. They received feedback on their performance. Students reported an increase in confidence in their ability to safely remove larvae after their training. Usefully, training materials are easily obtained from a butcher's and tackle shop making this model cheap and easy to replicate.",

In the meantime, the patient's husband, Mr X, was admitted to the hospital with fever and loss of appetite. On review of the clinical history, it was revealed that both patients had recently travelled to the Punjab area of India and to Spain. After four days of incubation, an organism was isolated from Mrs X's blood culture. Although not identified on routine MALDI-ToF mass spectrometry, the organism was confirmed as Brucella melitensis. A few days later the same organism was isolated from her husband's blood culture. Discussion: Mr and Mrs X had non-focal and focal brucellosis respectively. The couple had mostly likely acquired the disease during their recent trip to the Punjab where they reported drinking unpasteurised milk supplied by a local farmer. The incidence of brucellosis in many parts of the world, particularly Asia, remains largely unknown. The WHO recognises the disease may be endemic in India and is likely to be under diagnosed and under reported. Learning Points \u2022 Brucella melitensis is not reliably identified by MALDI-ToF mass spectrometry in a clinical laboratory. This has the potential to complicate the diagnostic process and delay appropriate patient management. \u2022 Despite understanding the need to boil milk prior to consumption, Mr and Mrs X did not always adhere to this advice. This highlights the significant role of human behaviour in the acquisition and transmission of infectious diseases.",

G3, the commonest genotype seen indigenously in the UK, is spread mainly by consumption of pork products and is increasing in incidence. HEV is not commonly considered in the initial differential diagnosis or investigations for patients with abnormal liver function tests. Aim(s)/Objective(s): Here we present four recent cases of confirmed HEV infection where this was not considered likely from the initial clinical presentations. Method(s): Patient case records were reviewed. Results: Case one was a twenty-three year old man with a background of diabetes and substance abuse. Initial management was based on a presumed paracetamol overdose. Case two was a middle aged woman who presented with weakness, dry cough, and back pain. This patient required intensive care support for Guillian-Barr\u00e9 Syndrome. The third case was a seventy-seven year old gentleman who presented with bronchopneumonia requiring ITU support where he was noted to be jaundiced. The fourth case was an eighty year old man who enjoyed good health until presenting with weight loss and jaundice. He was investigated for pancreatic malignancy and gall bladder pathology. Discussion and/or Conclusion(s): In common, all these patients had deranged ALT and bilirubin but a normal INR. None of these patients had HEV considered early in their presentation although they were screened for the other hepatitis viruses. We present these cases to remind people to consider HEV as an increasing cause of typical and atypical presentations of hepatitis.",

Causes of encephalitis include a range of infectious and non-infectious disease processes. The majority of cases result from viral infection. The aetiology of encephalitis remains unknown in up to 58% of cases in the UK (Granerod et al., 2010). Aim(s)/Objective(s): Real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is central to the diagnosis of viral encephalitis and identification of the causative pathogen.

As HHV-6 DNA can be congenitally integrated into the host genome corresponding blood samples were also tested. 10 of the patients had corresponding blood samples tested. 2 of these samples were negative in the blood and positive in the CSF indicating a likelihood of active infection. Discussion and/or Conclusion(s): Identification of the aetiology of encephalitis is crucial to the management of the condition and this study provides evidence that suggests the inclusion of HHV-6 in routine diagnostic screening of CSF may be beneficial in management. Results: Based on infection control inspections we identified multiple routes of potential transmission from poor hand hygiene, inappropriate PPE usage, environmental cleanliness issues and issues around phlebotomy practice using reusable Asceptic Non Touch Technique (ANTT) trays. We found multiply phlebotomy procedures reusing ANTT trays which were often inadequately cleaned in some instances being soiled with blood. Disposable ANTT trays are now used for separate phlebotomy procedures. Despite the fact that the exact route or routes of infection were not identified, inappropriate hygiene standards in parenteral treatment leading to viral hepatitis transmission was the likely source of transmission. Discussion and/or Conclusion(s): The report highlights that transmission of healthcare-associated HCV infection continues to occur. The results suggest that use of NS5B sequencing can reduce ambiguity about potential transmission events in healthcare and inform infection prevention control about the routes of transmission. Results: 150 patients had confirmed exposure to an influenza infection. Of these, 110 (73%) were over 65 years, 7 (5%) were pregnant, 2 (1%) were children under six months of age, 39 (26%) were diabetic, 94 (63%) had one or more chronic conditions (cardiovascular/liver/ neurological/renal/respiratory), 21 (14%) had severe immunosuppression, 4 (3%) were obese and 3 (2%) did not have any risk factors.",

Mycobacterial Growth Indicator Tube (MGIT) 960 resistance determination may overestimate phenotypic resistance compared with the now obsolete Bactec 460. Mutations in the pncA gene, which encodes the enzyme pyrazinamidase, cause the majority of PZA-resistance. Aim(s)/Objective(s): To determine whether pncA sequencing predicts PZA-resistance by comparing mutation presence to the phenotypic MGIT 960 result amongst isolates also resistant to isoniazid and/or rifampicin. Method(s): We examined 48 M. tuberculosis isolates referred to the Scottish Mycobacteria Reference Laboratory between 2006 and 2015.

Establishment of the biofilm phenotype confers the bacteria with significant tolerance to systemic antibiotics and the host immune system meaning the twin strategy of thorough joint debridement and prosthesis removal often remain the only possible course of therapeutic intervention. Protection of the prosthesis and dead space management may be achieved through the use antibiotic loaded cements and beads which aim to release high localised concentrations of antibiotics to the surgical site. Aim(s)/Objective(s): The antibacterial and antibiofilm efficacy of these materials is poorly understood. We have performed an array of in vitro studies against a selection of important gram negative and gram positive pathogens involved in PIs to better understand their potential clinical benefit. Method(s): Acrylic cement and various non-acrylic materials prepared as beads loaded with antibiotics were evaluated for their capacity to both inhibit biofilm formation and kill preformed biofilms using agar diffusion assays, viable cell counts, confocal and scanning electron microscopy. Studies to model the release of antibiotics from mineral based cements permitted an understanding of antibiotic elution kinetics and the bacterial response.Results: Agar diffusion assays demonstrated antibacterial concentrations of eluting antibiotics lasting for up to 111 days, dependent on the cement type, antibiotic and bacterial strain. Antibiotic-loaded beads attenuated early bacterial colonisation and reduced biofilm formation for multiple days post inoculation. Established biofilms were harder to clear.

ID: 4854 Varicella immunisation in healthcare workers in a large London teaching hospital Ons El Hayet Ben Ismail, Tabitha Mahungu, Joan Adeniji, Dianne Irish. Royal Free NHS Trust Background: Varicella (chickenpox) is an acute, highly infectious disease caused by the varicella zoster virus (VZV). In 2003, the Department of Health (DoH) recommended that nonimmune healthcare workers (HCWs) should receive varicella vaccine. HCWs with a negative or uncertain history of chickenpox or shingles should be serologically tested and a full course of VZV vaccine offered only to those without VZV antibody. Aim(s)/Objective(s): To determine the uptake of VZV vaccination in HCWs in a large London teaching hospital. Method(s): A retrospective review of all the HCWs tested for VZV IgG between 01/01/2011 to 31/012/2015 was performed. Results: 3456/3630 (95%) HCWs tested for VZV IgG antibody were positive. 152/3630 (4%) were negative and 22/3630 (1%) were equivocal. 75/174 (43%) of the susceptible HCWs received 2 doses of VZV vaccination. 20/174 (11%) received only one dose and 79/174 (45%) did not receive any doses. Data from the 58/99 susceptible HCWs who did not receive the full course show: 6 had health reasons, 16 declined and 36 had left the Trust. Of the non-immune HCWs, demographic data was available for 140/174: 60/140 (43%) were allied health professionals, 45/140 (32%) were nurses, 24/140 (17%) were doctors and 11/140 (8%) were administration Staff.

Mazin Barry, Abdulaziz Alsubaie, Meshal Alotaibi, Abdulrahman Aljadoa, Abdulaziz Alhamad, Turki Alotaibi, Khaled Almohaimede, Omar Alharbi. King Saud University, College of Medicine, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia Background: Many cases of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Corona Virus (MERS-CoV) have been confirmed worldwide. Around 80% of the cases have been diagnosed in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA). The risk of international disease spread is especially worrying given the KSA's role as the home of the most important Islamic pilgrimage sites. Aim(s)/Objective(s): To determine the knowledge about MERS-Cov among Arab pilgrims and to assess the relationship between the knowledge and different socio-demographic characteristics. Method(s): A cross-sectional study was carried out during Ramadan 2015 in the Holy Mosque in Mecca, Saudi Arabia. Self-developed questionnaires were collected conveniently from 417 Arab participants Results: The majority of the respondents were familiar with MERS-CoV (91.3%). Saudis had a significantly higher knowledge about MERS-CoV compared to non-Saudis. (56.92 \u00b1 18.55 vs. 44.91 \u00b1 25.46, P = 0.001).

Using the NHS Scotland Infection Intelligence Platform cases were linked to patient-level community prescribing data to measure antibiotic exposure in the 30 days prior to admission. Results: Between April 2010 and March 2014 there were 73,981 patients admitted with indicator infections. In patients admitted with indicator conditions there was a 1.9% increase in the proportion that received antibiotics in the 30 days prior to admission over the study period, despite a 0.8% decrease in the proportion of the whole population who received antibiotics in primary care.Discussion and/or Conclusion(s):There is no evidence SAPG interventions to reduce unnecessary antibiotic use have resulted in patients with serious infections respiratory tract infections not receiving antibiotics. This study found increased antibiotic use in patients with indicator infections. This should provide reassurance to clinicians and support further improvements in prescribing in primary care.

Aim(s)/Objective(s): We studied the relation between PTZ consumption rate and the clinical indications with PTZ being recommended as first line empirical therapy. Method(s): 10 acute Trusts provided PTZ consumption data (expressed as DDD/1000 admissions) for 2015/16. ESPAUR PPS Survey 2011 results showed that five clinical indications (Respiratory, Skin and Soft Tissue/Bone/Joint, Urinary Tract, Sepsis and Gastrointestinal indications) accounted for 90% of antimicrobial use. We reviewed first line empirical PTZ recommendations for these five indications for each of acute Trust in the region. PTZ consumption data and antimicrobial guidelines were compared and analysed. Results: The results showed that Trusts with higher (6/6 Trust) and lower (3/4 Trust) than average PTZ consumption recommended PTZ as first line therapy for the majority of clinical indications (=>3/5 indications). Discussion and/or Conclusion(s): Our results show that the empirical guidelines do not influence PTZ consumption data. Other factors such as duration of PTZ use, dosage used (Three times a day vs Four times a day) and guideline compliance may influence the consumption data. Further analysis which includes these factors would be useful to understand the different PTZ consumption data within the region. ID: 4926 A Novel, NICE teamwork approach for the antimicrobial stewardship in a teaching hospital Milind Khare, Deborah Gnanarajah, Wijitha Weerakoon, Julia Lacey. Royal Derby Hospital Background: 'Start Smart -Then Focus' -Antimicrobial Stewardship Toolkit for English Hospitals was introduced in March 2015 by Public Health England. NICE guideline for Antimicrobial Stewardship came in August 2015. Aim(s)/Objective(s): To review effectiveness of continuing weekly antibiotic audits by clinicians from April 2015 onwards. Method(s): The audits are carried by medical staff auditing all patients on an antimicrobial on a particular day, either on a weekly or monthly basis depending on past performance. Audits are forwarded to the antimicrobial pharmacist who reviews them in conjunction with the consultant microbiologist. Audit criteria are (1) Antibiotic choice is in line with Trust guidelines OR culture and sensitivity results OR there is a documented justified reason for deviation from the guidelines. (2) There is a stop or review date on the prescription. (3) Antibiotic treatment is reviewed 48-72 hours after starting and the prescribing decision documented added for 2016/17 antimicrobial CQUIN.4) Appropriate samples sent for cultures and sensitivity testing Results: There was an increase in the overall number of audits completed in May 2016, with the highest number since October 2015.Results improved in May 2016, with the target for stops dates being achieved and appropriateness improving from 80% to 83%. Sending of samples for culture and sensitivity fell slightly to 78%, however, this was still a big improvement on previous results.

King's College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust Background: Monthly point-prevalence audits have been conducted at King College Hospital (KCH) since 2010 and at Princess Royal University Hospital (PRUH) from 2014. Trust-wide reports are produced and discussed at Infection Control Clinical Leads meetings. Results are fed back to individual teams at Divisional governance meetings and included on performance scorecards. Aim(s)/Objective(s): To drive improvements in antimicrobial stewardship. Method(s): Junior doctors at KCH and pharmacists at PRUH record compliance with KPIs once a month (targets in brackets): 1. Indication(s) recorded (90%) 2. Stop/Review date recorded (90%) 3. IV to oral switch not overdue (95%) 4. Prescribed according to guidelines (90%) Spreadsheets are submitted to the Surveillance Team for collation.Results: Numbers of patients audited at KCH varied between 2,050 and 2,879 per quarter with an average of 38% on antimicrobials. At PRUH between 478 and 1472 patients were audited per quarter with an average of 27% on antimicrobials. Indications were recorded for over 95% (KCH) and 67% (PRUH). At KCH, Stop or Review compliance decreased by 5% between the first quarter and third quarter of 2014 but, was consistently above 90% in 2015. At the PRUH this ranged between 54.5% and 79.1%.

Imperial College London Background: Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a leading patient health and safety issue, yet there is a paucity of data describing bacterial epidemiology among UK ophthalmic populations. Aim(s)/Objective(s): To explore AMR trends among bacterial isolates from a tertiary eye hospital in west London. Method(s): Interrogation of the laboratory information management system enabled retrospective identification of all bacterial isolates from ophthalmic samples in fiscal years 2012 to 2015. Results: 466 isolates were identified from 401 patients (53% male, median age 42, range 1-92). 31.5% of samples were corneal scrapings (147/401), 32.4% were eye swabs (151/466). The remainder included contact lens fluid, wound cultures and skin swabs. The most common organisms cultured were S. aureus (130/466; 27.9%), P. aeruginosa (105/466; 22.5%), H. influenzae (33/466; 7.1%) and S. pneumoniae (29/401; 7.2%). P. aeruginosa predominated among corneal scrapings (70/147; 47.6%), while eye swabs disproportionately grew S. aureus (50/151; 33.1%). Of the 466 isolates, 262 were tested against chloramphenicol; 16.7% (44/262) were resistant, including some P. aeruginosa, S. aureus and S. marcescens. 190 isolates were tested against fusidic acid (the active component of fucithalmic), with 23.6% (45/190) resistant, including 33.3% (15/45) of S. aureus.

Aim(s)/Objective(s): The objectives were to determine the rate of Surgical Site Infections (SSIs) after spinal surgery, to identify the risk factors (RF) associated with SSIs and to suggest corrective means. Method(s): SSIs had been identified by active prospective surveillance. RF were collected retrospectively. Multivariate analysis was performed. The setting was a university-associated pediatric hospital. Patients were children aged from 4 to 25 years old with a neuromuscular or idiopathic scoliosis, who underwent spinal surgery between 01/01/2011 and 31/12/2015. Results: There were 21 infections following 326 fusions (6.4 per 100 operations). The sex ratio (M/F) was 0.41. The yearly SSIs attack rates were 1.6%, 10.3%, 5.7%, 4.2% and 10.5%. The mean age of infected (Inf.) and not infected (N. inf.) patients were similar (16.2 years) in both groups. The infection involved S. aureus (46%) and enterobacteriae (28%). Concerning patient-associated RF, there were statistical difference for the weight (Inf.: 36.4 \u00b1 19.3 kg; N. inf.:43.5 \u00b1 15.3 kg; p = 0.008), and the size (Inf.:142.8 \u00b1 21.8 cm; N. inf.:150.8 \u00b1 17.7 cm; p = 0.041). If the Body Mass Index is inferior to 15 kg/m 2 , the rate ratio was 4.09 (95%CI: 1.5-10.7; p = 0.004) and with multivariate analysis, only this condition was a RF (95%IC: 0.117; 0.884; p = 0.028). ASA score was also a RF (Chi2 test: p = 0.048). Concerning surgery-associated RF, the mean duration of surgery was statistically different (Inf.: 270 \u00b1 68 cm; N.inf: 231 \u00b1 86 cm; p = 0.011). Discussion and/or Conclusion(s): Our results suggest to decolonize patients with mupirocine five days before surgery and to offer them an enteral nutrition one year before intervention.ID: 4681 Measuring compliance with infection prevention practice across the surgical pathway: pilot study of the OneTogether Assessment Toolkit Jennie Wilson 1 , Kathryn Topley 2 , Deborah Xuereb 3 , Tracey Radcliffe 4 , Deborah Pike 5 , Sophie Singh 2 , Dawn Stott 6 , Reg Lloyd 7 , Ruth Collins 8 .

Traditionally associated with a self-limiting illness, infection can become chronic in immunosuppressed populations with associated significant morbidity and mortality. At present there are no clear guidelines for testing and monitoring for HEV in transplant recipients. Aim(s)/Objective(s): To determine the point prevalence of viraemic HEV infection in solid organ transplant (SOT) and haematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) recipients undergoing transplantation between January 2013 and December 2015.Method(s): Stored extracts of whole blood from patients undergoing SOT (liver and/or kidney) or HSCT were tested using a commercial real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction kit for HEV RNA. Samples were tested at baseline, 30, 60 and 90 days post-transplant. Results: 259 HSCT, 262 Liver and 349 kidney transplant patients were included with 2452 samples meeting the inclusion criteria. Prevalence of HEV viraemia in HSCT patients was 0.65% at baseline, 0.85% at 30 days, 0.96% at 60 days and 1.08% at 90 days and in liver transplant patients was 0.43% at baseline, 0.43% at 30 days, 1.06% at 60 days and 0.72% at 90 days. None of the kidney transplant patients had HEV viraemia. Discussion and/or Conclusion(s): Prevalence of viraemic HEV infection in SOT and HSCT patients is low at baseline and remains low throughout the early post transplant phase.

Discharge summaries were scanned for mention of either a superficial skin infection, or deep infection. Telepath, the microbiology laboratory system, was also scanned to identify any organisms isolated from microbiological samples during these episodes. Results: Interpretation of data showed the rate of infection to be 6.13%. This is over five times the rate recorded in the Public Health England Surveillance document. Discussion and/or Conclusion(s): This highlights the difficulties of surgical site surveillance when there are no clear guidelines on acceptable rates of infection. Many factors will affect this rate such as patient characteristics, co-morbidities, type of surgery, length of surgery, operating conditions, aseptic techniques, skin prep and antibiotic prophylaxis. A full range of quality improvement measures mapped to the NICE standards for SSIs have been implemented. Background: Marked differences in surgical site infection (SSI) rates in different European countries have been observed. Aim(s)/Objective(s): To understand the degree to which differences in reported SSI rates in Norway and England are attributable to methodological differences, a collaborative study was undertaken. Method(s): A comprehensive review of national surveillance methods, participatory requirements and data quality was undertaken. Data from September 2012 to January 2015 were pooled for categories of surgery included in both programmes and analysed using logistic regression (adjusted for sex, age, ASA score, wound class, postoperative hospital days, operation duration). Results: Whilst both countries broadly followed CDC/ECDC protocols for SSI surveillance, notable differences were identified in the application of post-discharge case finding methods and case definitions for superficial infection. Comparison of surveillance categories in common to both countriescoronary artery bypass graft (CABG), colon surgery, cholecystectomy and hip prosthesisidentified significant differences in patient populations (ASA score, wound contamination), length of stay, duration of surgery. Multivariable analysis restricted to inpatient and readmission-detected deep incisional and organ/space infections within 30 days of surgery identified significantly higher rates of SSI in Norway than England for colon surgery (aOR = 0.43, 95% CI 0.36-0.52), total hip (aOR = 0.21, 0.17-0.26) and partial hip replacement (aOR = 0.11, 0.08-0.14). In contrast, SSI rates were comparable for CABG and cholecystectomy. Discussion and/or Conclusion(s): Residual differences in SSI rates not explained by patient or surgical risk factors were apparent for colon and hip replacement surgery. Further cross-border investigation should be undertaken to explore these differences and identify opportunities for reducing SSI rates.",

Recent Registry data show that deep infection rates in joint replacement surgery may be deteriorating. We used settle plates to monitor air quality in a contemporary operating theatre during joint replacement surgery. Aim(s)/Objective(s): Initially (first phase) we compared practice to Charnley's data. We then (second phase) had all staff using body exhaust systems. We then (third phase) used data from laser imaging airflow studies to predict optimum locations for the surgical instrument trolleys. Our aim was to use settle plates to localise contamination on the instrument trays. Method(s) : Operations were carried out in an Howorth Exflow ultra clean enclosure. In phase 1 and phase 2 packs of 10 Petri dishes were placed with five dishes on the instrument trolleys and five dishes around the periphery of the operating theatre. Dishes were opened when the incision was made and closed one hour later. In phase 3 eight petri dishes were placed, four on each trolley in defined positions. Petri dishes were incubated for 48 hours and the number of colonies counted. Background: Surveillance of surgical site infection (SSI) after craniotomy was initiated in 2012 because of presumption of high infection rates. About 200 procedures are performed yearly in our hospital. From 2012 to 2015 the yearly rate of SSI rate increased from 7.7% to 14.9%. The aetiology was gram positive cocci and Propionibacterium acnes in 64% of cases and gram negative species, particularly Enterobacter spp and P. aeruginosa in 36% of cases. Aim(s)/Objective(s): To describe a multifaceted intervention to reduce the SSI in craniotomy and the impact of these interventions on SSI rates. Method(s): Prospective surveillance of SSI in a 700-bed university hospital in Barcelona, Spain. All patients admitted for elective or urgent craniotomy from October 2012 to May 2016 were prospectively followed for 30 days after surgery or 1 year if implant. Interventions: In November 2015 we implemented the following interventions: (a) head wash inside the operating room with povidone-iodine and saline (b) surgical antibiotic prophylaxis within 30\u2033 prior incision, (c) vancomycin powder (1 g) in subgaleal space before skin closure, (d) sterile head wash at the end of surgery and (e) coverture of surgical incision with a sterile absorbent wrap to prevent moisture. Results: From January to June 2016, 58 patients were followed; 50% women, median age 52y (range: 20-80), 90% with implants. During this period no surgical site infection was observed. Discussion and/or Conclusion(s): The introduction of a multifaceted intervention of SSI prevention in craniotomies was safe and drastically reduced the number of infections. However, a longer surveillance is needed to verify these outstanding results.",

Outcomes for MDR-TB are poor with cure rates under 50% in Europe compared to 98% for drug sensitive TB. The World Health Organisation, European Centre for Disease Control and National Institute for Clinical Excellence recommend monitoring MDR-TB contacts for two years through chest radiography (CXR) and clinical examination. Aim(s)/Objective(s): This service evaluation retrospectively analysed surveillance of 103 contacts of MDR-TB cases managed by Birmingham and Solihull TB service between 2010 and 2015. Of these, four were extra-pulmonary MDR-TB contacts. Method(s): Service standards were set as: all contacts \u226518 years old require three CXRs, four clinician contacts, and if \u226435 years old, a mantoux/IGRA test within a three year window. A proforma was created and data were obtained from electronic medical records. Results: Analysis of pulmonary contacts found 14% had \u22653 CXRs whilst 32% had 1 \u2264 x \u2264 3 CXRs. 53% had no CXR. 11% completed 24 months of follow-up. 63% had partial follow-up, 24% had none and 2% had ongoing follow-up.

Aim(s)/Objective(s): We investigated the prevalence of a multiresistant strain of Staphylococcus capitis in this centre over 11 months. Method(s): Cefoxitin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci (FOX-R-CNS) from blood cultures of neonates >72 hours old were speciated using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionisation time of flight (MALDI-ToF) spectrophotometry. Cefoxitin-resistant isolates of S. capitis were sent to the Staphylococcus Reference Unit, London for further work. Results: Between 1st July 2015 and 31st May 2016, 102 CNS were isolated. There were 38 FOX-R-CNS grown from 26 neonates. A male baby born in Leeds at 31 weeks gestation grew S. capitis from blood cultures in the third week of neonatal unit stay. The isolate was confirmed to belong to the same multi-resistant clone seen in other neonatal units worldwide. The source of the late-onset CNS bacteraemia was thought to be a central venous catheter used for administration of total parenteral nutrition in this very low birth weight baby (1.22kg). The intravenous catheter was removed and the baby was successfully treated with daptomycin. Discussion and/or Conclusion(s): Within the Leeds Centre for Newborn Care, there is currently a low prevalence of the multiresistant S. capitis strain that has caused clonal outbreaks in neonatal units worldwide, including UK. There is a need for on-going surveillance given vancomycin selective pressure in neonatal units and we will continue to monitor for the emergence of this multiresistant strain.",

Aim(s)/Objective(s): Our objective was to provide comprehensive and accurate metrics concerning the risk of death and the excess in length of stay due to NI acquired in ICU. Method(s): NI (nosocomial pneumonia, central venous catheter related infection, bacteraemia and urinary tract infections) were continuously recorded from 2004 to 2012 for every patient hospitalised more than two days in one 30 beds medical ICU according to the protocol of the French's Survey Network for ICU-Acquired Infection (REA-RAISIN). We merged data from the local diagnosis-related group system (PMSI) to add information about the whole hospital stay, including primary diagnosis. For each type of NI, we assessed the impact of NI with the state-of-the-art statistical models: extended Background: Healthcare-associated infections (HAI) point prevalence surveys, repeated periodically, provide an effective epidemiological tool for monitoring the extent of the phenomenon. Aim(s)/Objective(s): i) To estimate HAI prevalence and antimicrobial use, (ii) to study microbial ecology and (iii) to identify risk factors for HAI at the tertiary 1,300 acute-care beds regional referral center university hospital, I.R.C.C.S. AOU San Martino-IST of Genoa, Liguria region, north-west Italy. Method(s): During January-February of three consecutive years (2014-2016), we conducted three point prevalence surveys of HAI and antimicrobial use by adopting the protocol of the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), Version 4.3.Results: Overall, we enrolled 2820 patients, with a median age of 73 years (IQR: 57-82), a male:female ratio = 0.96:1 and a median hospital stay of 8 days (IQR: 3-17). Nearly half of the patients had a ultimately or rapidly fatal McCabe score. HAI prevalence decreased from 15.5% in 2014 to 13.2 in 2016. Bloodstream and low-respiratory tract infections represented the most frequent site of HAI. Antibiotic treatment prevalence remained nearly 47% in the period. We observed an increase in the isolation of Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli. At multivariate analysis, statistically significant risk factors for HAI resulted length of hospital stay, worst McCabe score, presence of central and peripheral line, and presence of urinary catheter. Discussion and/or Conclusion(s): The study allowed us to increase knowledge for the prompt implementation of appropriate preventive interventions, aimed at controlling one of the most important public health problems in our country. Background: Pneumocystis jirovecii colonisation is a risk factor for the development of PCP disease. Few studies have compared individuals with P. jirovecii colonisation to those with PCP disease. Aim(s)/Objective(s): To describe the epidemiology of P. jirovecii colonisation and PCP disease in order to inform preventive measures. Method(s): From July 2011-July 2012 information on demographics, clinical severity and clinical features for all hospital inpatients in NI aged \u226518 years with P. jirovecii confirmed in any respiratory tract sample. We defined PCP or P. jirovecii colonisation using clinical and radiological findings. We compared demographics and clinical variables for PCP compared to P. jirovecii colonisation calculating adjusted median unbiased estimate (AMUE) of the odds ratio (OR) using multivariable exact logistic regression, adjusting a priori for age and sex. Results: There were 13 P. jirovecii colonisations and 36 PCP cases, with no difference in age (P = 0.1) or sex (P = 0.4). There was no difference in the proportion admitted to ICU (P = 0.9), the length of stay following P. jirovecii detection (P = 0.9) or 30-day all-cause mortality (P = 0.8). The odds of PCP increased with exposure to chemotherapy (AMUE OR 8.73; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.84, \u221e), immunosuppressive drugs (AMUE OR 12.1; 95% CI 1.94, \u221e) and an HIV diagnosis (AMUE OR 16.2; 95% CI 1.71, \u221e). Discussion and/or Conclusion(s): Our study showed no difference in clinical severity between individuals colonised with P. jirovecii and those with PCP. Given the higher odds of PCP in those exposed to chemotherapy, immunosuppressive drugs and those with HIV we propose decolonisation should be considered in these groups. patients and children \u2022 contact tracing for staff contacts \u2022 antiviral prophylaxis for contacts \u2022 incident reporting \u2022 consideration of whether an incident meeting is required \u2022 patient outcome There is guidance on which sections should be completed by one of the medical microbiologists and/or one of the infection prevention and control nurses.

Aim(s)/Objective(s): We aim to determine the analytical performance of the Research-Use-Only (RUO) Xpert MRSA NxG using a frozen samples biobank previously assayed by culture, Xpert MRSA Gen3 RUO and BD-MAX MRSA XT. Method(s): A frozen library obtained in a previous study made of 155 nasal swabs discharged in saline (119 prospective and 36 swabs from known MRSA culture positive patients) was screened with the new RUO Cepheid Xpert MRSA NxG. 100\u03bcl of the suspension was assayed on a GeneXpert IV platform. The same starting material had been previously used for culture and molecular assays. Results: 141 samples contained the required volume of 100\u03bcl. The sensitivity and specificity of the Xpert MRSA NxG were 93.3% and 100%, respectively, while the positive and negative predictive values were 100% and 96.9%, respectively. Three out of the 45 positive samples tested were falsely negative and two unresolved. Suspensions from four of these five isolates were appropriately detected by the Xpert MRSA NxG assay. Discussion and/or Conclusion(s): The Xpert MRSA NxG proved to be as effective as the previously released Xpert MRSA Gen3 while further expanding the subtypes coverage, decreasing runtime from 77 to 70 minutes and providing room temperature storage and extended shelf life.",

However, linking a manually fulfilled database with potential typing mistake with another one is challenging. Aim(s)/Objective(s): Our objective was to develop an algorithm to link two databases when no explicit linkage key exists. Method(s): Our algorithm calculates a 'link likelihood score' (LLS) between each pair of possible record in each database. The lower this LLS is, the more probable the matching between the two records. To take account of possible mistyping, this score was based on Levensthein distances for non-numerical data and various calculations for numerical data. We checked the accuracy by manually review 10% of the non-perfect matching pairs and systematically when the score was over a threshold. The algorithm was implemented in the opensource R software. We applied this method by linking data from a prospective study's database about nosocomial infection in the intensive care unit (REA-RAISIN) with our local DRG system. Results: Among the 7479 records of our database, almost all observations (99.8%) were linked with related records in the DRGbased database. Without our algorithm only 5448 (72.8%) with a perfect matching would be linked. No linking error was found when the LLS was under the threshold. Among the 134 record manually reviewed with a LLS above the threshold, only 14 (0.2%) were excluded due to the lack of matching record between the databases. Discussion and/or Conclusion(s): This original algorithm implemented in a free software could be adapted to link potentially any other database. Background: With encouraging progress in GBS vaccine development, attention is increasingly focusing on identifying the breadth of potential target groups for immunisation. Aim(s)/Objective(s): Our study aimed to quantify the incidence of GBS sepsis associated with pregnancy and childbirth. Method(s): Laboratory confirmed GBS infections diagnosed from normally sterile sites (invasive GBS disease, iGBS) in England in 2014 were extracted from national surveillance data (SGSS). Records were linked to HSCIC Hospital Episode Statistics using NHS number and analysed to identify pregnancy or childbirth within 6 weeks of GBS diagnosis. Cases were compared to normative data on maternities from ONS and HSCIC. Results: Of 1601 patients diagnosed with iGBS infection in England in 2014, 1546 (97%) were successfully linked to a hospital admission record. Of these, 185 (12%) were identified as maternal infections, 0.28/ 1000 maternities. The median age of maternal cases was 30y (18-44y). Seven cases were associated with miscarriage. Of 168 cases with information on the interval between diagnosis and delivery, 74% (124) were diagnosed on the day of delivery, 10% (16) antepartum and 17% (28) postpartum. Of the 140 intra/antepartum infections, 41% were emergency C-section deliveries. Although the proportion of preterm (<37 week) deliveries was similar between cases and national data (7% vs 8%), a higher proportion of stillbirths were associated with maternal GBS infection, 3% vs 0.47% ( p < 0.001). Discussion and/or Conclusion(s): Our study identified a substantial burden of maternal GBS infection with an associated higher risk of stillbirth. Prevention of maternal infection should be a priority for future public health strategy.",

Aim(s)/Objective(s): In this study, we examined the appropriateness of indwelling urinary catheters and the association with CAUTI among hospitalized patients. Method(s): Six point prevalence surveys were conducted from a random sampling of 1297 beds unit, semi-annually, beginning May 2012. Data on urinary catheter utilization and CAUTI were collected from participating units. Since November 2014, we captured urinary catheter appropriateness as defined by the international HICPAC Guidelines 2014.

Infections caused by them are more problematic to manage due to reduced antimicrobial choice and are associated with poorer outcomes. As they as transmissible between individuals, their rapid detection in colonised patients is vital in containing their spread and starting appropriate empirical antimicrobials when required. Based on national guidelines and local risk assessment, patients at Central Manchester Foundation Trust are screened for colonisation with CPE using one of two molecular methods; CARBA-R (Cepheid, Sunnydale, California) or an in-house nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT). Samples with a positive NAAT are subsequently cultured to attempt to isolate the CPE. Aim(s)/Objective(s): To establish the epidemiology of CPE in screening samples in this high incidence setting. Method(s): We retrospectively analysed the results of more than 68,000 rectal swabs submitted to the laboratory for the purpose of screening for the carriage of CPE. Results: We present the epidemiology of KPC, OXA-48 and NDM, including organism identification and susceptibility data in this large cohort of patients. Background: The emergence and spread of carbapenemase producing Enterobacteriaceae (CPE) is a clinical and public health concern both nationally and internationally. In this hospital, the first documented case of CPE was described in 2009 and since then the number of new cases has risen exponentially year on year since 2013 accounting for 53% of the total national burden in 2015. Aim(s)/Objective(s): The aim of a quality improvement project (QI) was to reduce newly identified CPE cases from 27 (the total for the first 6 months in 2015) to 13 for the first 6 months 2016. It was opportune to review all aspects of the management of CPE from a QI perspective including financial costs and the impact of an infection cohort ward. Method(s): A series of PDSA cycles were undertaken, as a consequence of baseline audits, to enhance compliance with CPE infection prevention and control processes around screening and diagnostics, hand hygiene, care bundles for devices and contact precautions. The daily cost of each of the patients in the project group and an average cost per night identified for each bed night attributable to the CPE care element of the patient stay was calculated. Results: Sixteen new CPE cases were identified for the first 6 months of 2016 with a cost saving of \u20ac682,086 for this time frame. Discussion and/or Conclusion(s): The impact of the QI measures utilised have evidenced a safer, more efficient and higher quality of care provided to the patient population on the cohort ward. Background: Group C and G streptococci (GCS, GGS) are associated with pharyngitis and skin/soft tissue infections, and bear genetic similarities to Group A Streptococcus (GAS). Increased incidence of invasive GAS in the UK suggests analysis of the epidemiology of GCS/ GGS is warranted. Aim(s)/Objective(s): To identify epidemiological trends in GCS/GGS isolates among beta haemolytic streptococci (BHS) in community and inpatient settings across a population of 2.5 million in North West London, over six years. Method(s): All BHS isolates were retrospectively identified from clinical samples submitted to a centralised laboratory serving the study population from March 2009-February 2015. Results: Community: 9069 BHS isolates were identified. There was a negative temporal correlation in the proportion of GCS/GGS among BHS from 27% in 2009 to 12% in February 2015 (rs \u22120.66, p < 0.001), concomitant with a fall in GAS from 38% to 22% (rs \u22120.44, p < 0.001). Hospital: 2670 BHS isolates were identified. For GCS/GGS as a proportion of BHS there was again a negative temporal correlation from 18% in 2012 to 12% in 2015 (rs \u22120.52, p = 0.002), yet GAS rose from 10% to 19% (rs + 0.40,p = 0.02). Discussion and/or Conclusion(s): Among BHS, GCS/GGS from community and hospital samples fell between 2009 and 2015. A less significant fall was seen in GAS in the community, yet GAS in a hospital setting increased. This is in keeping with increased invasive GAS incidence under investigation by Public Health England. The concomitant fall in GCS/GGS warrants further investigation of transmission patterns, including network analysis and molecular virulence and fitness.",

The campaigns combined educational sessions for healthcare workers, promotion of alcohol-based hand rubs and patient awareness. Hand hygiene compliance of healthcare workers was measured by direct observation and data transferred by email to the Scientific Institute of Public Health (WIV-ISP), between 2005 and 2011. A new web tool compatible with wireless tablets was developed in 2013 for both direct data entry and real time feedback to hospitals. Aim(s)/Objective(s): The objective of the web tool was to provide hospitals with a user friendly password protected system for easy/ direct data entry and real time performance feedback. Method(s): Using SharePoint technology, an observation roster standardised according to World Health Organisation specifications was designed and built for data entry. The data entered are stored directly into tables in an SQL database. Data integrity and validity are automatically done upon entry. SAS Enterprise Guide is then used to analyse data using SAS stored processes and results are then reported back to hospitals depending on the selection made from the prompts. Results: The number of opportunities (compliance rates) before intervention increased from 73,663 (49.6%) during the first campaign to 123,204 (64.1%) during the fifth campaign when the tool was introduced.Background: First described in the 1960s, parechoviruses (PeV) belong to the family Picornaviridae and are non-enveloped, single-stranded, positive-sense RNA viruses. There are multiple genotypes, but PeV genotype 3 in particular has a noted association with severe disease in neonates and infants. Currently there is no specific antiviral drug or vaccine against this virus. Aim(s)/Objective(s): To describe an unexpected series of PeV cases in a local paediatric population. Method(s): In infants who present to the emergency department at Leicester Royal infirmary with signs of sepsis (including fever, lethargy, poor-feeding, irritability) a lumbar puncture is performed as part of the routine septic work-up and the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is referred to microbiology for viral PCR testing, including HSV, VZV, enterovirus and PeV. Results: During May-June 2016 PeV was detected in the CSF of 15 (and counting) neonates and infants (median age 33 days; range 8-197 days). In addition, for one severely ill neonate on intensive care, further testing also demonstrated the presence of PeV RNA by PCR testing in faeces, blood, a broncho-alveolar lavage (BAL) and a throat swab, confirming disseminated PeV infection. All samples have been sent to the PHE reference laboratory for viral sequencing and phylogenetic analysis. Discussion and/or Conclusion(s): Since the introduction of this PeV CSF PCR assay in our laboratory, three years ago, there have only been a few cases detected per year so these cases represent an unusual surge in numbers. Further clinical details and molecular epidemiological analysis will be presented and possible reasons for this sudden rise in cases discussed. (1) (2) (3) (4) , parechovirus as well as Mycoplasma pneumoniae. This extended screen was applied to symptomatic children admitted to hospital who were RSV Antigen negative on NPA and adult symptomatic patients were either immunocompromised (haematology and oncology) or on ICU with community acquired pneumonia. Over 1500 samples were tested during this period. Results: For children, analysis showed that co-infection was common and that a positive result correlated with shorter duration of inpatient stay. For adults, screening showed that both influenza and RSV infections had been underdiagnosed/ missed, particularly for critically ill patients. Screening symptomatic patients on admission led to improved infection prevention and control measures and better cohorting including those managed on ITU and a Respiratory ward. Many immunocompromised patients had co-infections making cohorting more problematic. Discussion and/or Conclusion(s): Following these findings, new algorithms for testing both short and long respiratory PCR panels are being introduced for patients admitted during the winter of 2016/17.",
