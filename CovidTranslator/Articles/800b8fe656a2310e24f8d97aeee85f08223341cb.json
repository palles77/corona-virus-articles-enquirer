PHYSIOL BEHAV 59(3) [569][570][571][572][573][574][575][576][577] 1996.--This study examined the effects and aftereffects of naturally occurring upper respiratory tract illnesses on mood and performance. Twenty-six subjects (12 males, 14 females, mean age 23 years 10 months, age range 18-39 years) were tested once a week for a period of a month. Fifteen subjects were suffering from a common cold on the first week and the other 11 subjects were matched healthy control,;. Subjects attended for an initial 3-h testing period that consisted of a set of practice trials and two test sessions involving mood rating and performance of a battery of tests measuring psychomotor functions, attention, and memory. Sessions 3, 4, and 5 took place 1, 2, and 3 weeks later, respectively. In addition to measuring mood and mental performance, symptom severity was rated on a subjective checklist. The results showed that subjects with a cold reported an increase in negative mood and that this was only significant in the first week. Impairments of psychomotor function (simple reaction time and tracking) were also observed at this time. Performance of sustained and selective attention tasks was also impaired in subjects with colds but this effect was only significant in the second week. Other fu:~ctions such as working and semantic memory were unimpaired in subjects with colds at any point in the experiment Overall, the present results confirm many of the earlier results obtained in studies of experimentally induced upper respiratory tract illnesses. Indeed, these results are both of great practical importance and theoretical interest and further studies must now elucidate the mechanisms underlying these effects.",

Cold virus infection did not produce impairments on simple memory tasks, such as digit span or free recall tasks. However, with more complex story recall, cold subjects actually showed improved memory for unimportant information presented prior to virus challenge, but were otherwise less able than controls to follow the theme when the complete test was run during the illness (30). 3. Influenza infection, unlike cold virus infection, was observed to increase reaction time on tasks where there is uncertainty as to where the next target will appear (25). These tasks included the variable foreperiod reaction time task, a visual search task, and a detection task. In contrast, a cold virus did not affect performance on a vigilance task (20). Influenza, but not cold infection, also increased distractability from irrelevant stimuli on the Stroop colour-word test (19). On two choice reaction time tasks (5), the performance of influenza sufferers was not impaired if the target appeared in a known central location, but response was slower if the location was uncertain (29). Cold sufferers, however, had slower reaction times on both tasks, suggesting a general motor slowing, whereas influenza infection may be impairing an attentional mechanism. 4. Neither infection with cold nor influenza appeared to effect complex cognitive tasks such as logical reasoning. Speed of retrieval of semantic knowledge held in long-term memory is also unaffected (30). 5. Mood ratings taken during illness were also virus specific.",

Other impairments were observed even in the absence of symptoms. For example, performance impairments were also found on some tasks during the incubation period and in volunteers with subclinical infection (infection established by biological methods but without symptoms) (25). In addition, results from one study (29) showed that performance can still be impaired in convalescence when subjects are no longer symptomatic. It is extremely difficult to study effects in the incubation period of naturally occurring illnesses or to examine the effects of subclinical infection. In contrast to this, effects on performance and mood can easily be studied while subjects are symptomatic and while they are convalescing. This approach has demonstrated that naturally occurring influenza B illnesses produce similar changes to those reported in earlier studies using experimentally induced infections (23). The present study also followed the same research strategy and was a forerunner to more sophisticated studies involving prospective designs and virological assays intended to detect the nature of the infecting agent (24), which allows comparisons to be made across different cold-producing viruses.",

These are summarised below and the present study was designed to test these alternative views. 1. One might expect the pattern of performance and mood changes found in naturally occurring illnesses to be similar to those observed following experimentally induced infections. Two possible outcomes would support this view: the first being where effects are identical to the previous studies, the second involving selective changes but not necessarily identical ones to those found in earlier research.",

On the basis of this one would not expect to replicate the effects obtained with experimentally induced infections. Indeed, if different viruses produced opposing effects one would not necessarily expect to find differences between the subjects with URTIs and matched healthy controls. 3. The illnesses that followed experimentally induced infections were typically very mild. In real-life URTIs are usually more severe and such illnesses could produce more global changes in performance and mood. The present study not only considered the period when the person was symptomatic but also examined possible aftereffects of naturally occurring URTIs. Again, several possible views of the outcomes could be put forward. First, the size and pattem of the impairments present during and after the illness might be directly related to symptom severity. Secondly, symptoms might change over time and other changes related to these new symptoms might appear. Finally, changes in performance and mood might be independent of symptom severity and type. It was hoped that the pattern of results obtained would shed light on the mechanisms by which any changes in performance or mood were produced.",

To reduce the impact of differences other than the illness factor two methodological features were included. First, a homogenous sample of subjects (university students) was recruited. Secondly, a detailed profile of each subject's personality, recent mental health status, and health-related behaviour was recorded by administration of a series of questionnaires.

Subjects carried out the tests in a counterbalanced order; half of the subjects completed six computerised tasks first, whereas others began with another six tasks, mostly of paper and pencil type. Each subject repeated the same order across all test sessions, with different versions of the identical tasks used in session 1.

Other impairments were observed even in the absence of symptoms. For example, performance impairments were also found on some tasks during the incubation period and in volunteers with subclinical infection (infection established by biological methods but without symptoms) (25) . In addition, results from one study (29) showed that performance can still be impaired in convalescence when subjects are no longer symptomatic. It is extremely difficult to study effects in the incubation period of naturally occurring illnesses or to examine the effects of subclinical infection. In contrast to this, effects on performance and mood can easily be studied while subjects are symptomatic and while they are convalescing. This approach has demonstrated that naturally occurring influenza B illnesses produce similar changes to those reported in earlier studies using experimentally induced infections (23) . The present study also followed the same research strategy and was a forerunner to more sophisticated studies involving prospective designs and virological assays intended to detect the nature of the infecting agent (24) , which allows comparisons to be made across different cold-producing viruses.",

One might expect the pattern of performance and mood changes found in naturally occurring illnesses to be similar to those observed following experimentally induced infections.

On the basis of this one would not expect to replicate the effects obtained with experimentally induced infections. Indeed, if different viruses produced opposing effects one would not necessarily expect to find differences between the subjects with URTIs and matched healthy controls. 3. The illnesses that followed experimentally induced infections were typically very mild. In real-life URTIs are usually more severe and such illnesses could produce more global changes in performance and mood. The present study not only considered the period when the person was symptomatic but also examined possible aftereffects of naturally occurring URTIs. Again, several possible views of the outcomes could be put forward. First, the size and pattem of the impairments present during and after the illness might be directly related to symptom severity. Secondly, symptoms might change over time and other changes related to these new symptoms might appear. Finally, changes in performance and mood might be independent of symptom severity and type. It was hoped that the pattern of results obtained would shed light on the mechanisms by which any changes in performance or mood were produced.",

Closer inspection of the data revealed that the medication taken was of the \"cough sweet\" variety rather than analgesics or caffeine-containing treatments. Such preparations were therefore unlikely to affect subjects' performance per se. Also, there was no difference between the groups with regard to medication taken in the most relevant time period, the 2 h immediately prior to testing.

Similarly, tasks that showed no effects of either colds or influenza in the Common Cold Unit studies (e.g., logical reasoning, semantic processing) were unaffected in the present study. Other tasks that showed impairments following experimentally induced illnesses were not impaired in the present study. This could reflect several things, the two most obvious being differences in the virus producing the illness and a difference in testing procedure. In the present study there was no effect of having an URTI on performance of the pegboard task. An earlier study (28) found an impairment following challenge with a respiratory syncytial virus. It is highly unlikely that any of the subjects in the present study were infected with this virus as it typically infects young children, and failure to replicate could, therefore, reflect the virus specificity of the original result. Alternatively, the absence of an effect on the pegboard task (and the search and memory task) could reflect the fact that in the original study subjects were tested four times a day for the whole 10 days of the Common Cold Unit trial whereas here they were only tested once a week.",

Subjects with URTIs were slower on the focused attention and categoric search choice reaction time tasks when they had mild symptoms (as at the Common Cold Unit) but not when these were more severe (week I). Evidence for effects of the illness extending into the third week was slight. Only one choice reaction time measure was significantly different and, given the number of analyses conducted, this could reflect a chance effect. However, a number of tasks (e.g., simple reaction time task, tracking task) showed that the URTI group were worse than the controls across all sessions (although this difference was not always significant). Such differences could reflect a general difference in the characteristics of the groups that has not emerged from the checks on matching. To eliminate this possibility further studies should use a true prospective design where baseline measures are taken when all subjects are healthy. The results could also be due to transfer effects from the \"colds\" condition to the subsequent \"well\" condition. Alternatively, the \"aftereffects\" of the illness may be genuine but may be slight and require a more powerful design to detect them. Finally, it may be that some individuals recover quickly from an illness whereas others have a slower recovery rate. This view is supported by the fact that the variability of the scores in the URTI group increased each week (see simple reaction time and tracking tasks).",

In the acute phase of the illness there was a general increase in negative affect and selective performance impairments. The profile of performance changes associated with the illness (and the pattern of unaffected tasks) generally matched results found previously for the same tasks. Differences between the present results and the earlier studies may possibly be due to procedural changes, or to viral or illness specificity of certain effects. Alternatively, they could reflect the fact that some of the original findings were random effects that would not have replicated even at the Common Cold Unit. The pattern of performance changes varied from week 1 to week 2 and this could possibly reflect the type and severity of the symptoms. In contrast to this, no general effects remained in the final asymptomatic part of the study (weeks 3 and 4), although subgroups of the sample may still have been impaired at this time. Such issues need to be considered in studies with larger sample sizes than the one used here. Further research is now required to determine the nature of the mechanisms underlying the effects of URTIs on the brain and behaviour, and in addition it is essential to assess the impact of these illnesses on efficiency and safety in real-life settings.",
