Everyone from the age of 5 to 65 years is on social media every day with billions of users sending messages, sharing information, comments, and the like [1] . With the advancement in information technology, social networking sites such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and LinkedIn are available for the users to interact with families, colleagues, and friends. As a result, social activities are shifting from real things to virtual machines [2] . Analyzing the behavior of individuals from social networking sites is a complex task because there are several methods used. By gathering information from different resources and then analyzing that information, the behavior of the users can be examined. In this research, we have collected different studies about assessing human behavior with the help of social media and compared them according to the different methods used by different authors [3] .",

Moreover, some studies [14, 21] proposed more than one method to analyze individuals' behavior. A major issue in this area is the security and privacy of the information that the users put on the social media. However, some of the studies included in this review provided suggestions and methods to help secure the personal information of users. Many authors also discussed machine learning technique to observe the personality of social networking site users.",

It is found that there were 69 different methods used by the researchers to analyze their Table 6 Demographic and Behaviour Trends From the Different Social Media According to age: Age group between 45 and 55 use more Facebook than Twitter and Instagram. More than 79% of this age group use Facebook according to current trend Use of smart phones: Another reason of using social media have been increased in the past year is smart phones. Smart phones have more visual interaction and people can access the social media easily. Advancement in the mobile phones play very important role in the increased users of social media According to location: More people use the social media while they go out for dinner with family and friends. Other locations where people like to use social media is gym, cinema and home specially in lounge room area more than other rooms According to time: More than 70% people use internet in the evening and 57% people use as a first thing in the morning. There is minimum use of social media during Breakfast, lunch, at work and commuting Frequency of using social networking sites: More than 35% people use social media more than five times a day as compared to 20% people who never use social networking site in a day. There are only 3% people who use once a week APPS: More than 68% use apps to access the social media and fewer people use websites to access the social media data. From these methods, the most common technique to analyze the behavior of individuals was analysis techniques. From this study, it is clear that there is need for more research to predict the personality and behavior of individuals on the Instagram. This study found that 50% of research was done on Twitter and 11 different analysis techniques were sued. While reviewing the research articles, it was clear that the researchers have used more than one method for data collection and behavior analysis. Table 1 has all the data analysis of the paper reviewed in the study. Furthermore, unlike past research papers, this chapter included the attributes of the number of users and the limitations of the work done. These studies mostly focused on Twitter with some research on Facebook and Instagram. In this research paper, we have attempted to fill the gap by including the number of users and limitation attributes. There are some challenges to find the solutions to the issues that have been discussed, but these require urgent attention. This study should be useful as a reference for researchers interested in the analysis of the behavior of social media users.",
