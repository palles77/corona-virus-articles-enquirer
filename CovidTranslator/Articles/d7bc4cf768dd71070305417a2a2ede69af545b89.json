Sewage sludge, increasingly referred to as biosolids, is an inevitable product of wastewater treatment. Conventional wastewater treatment processes comprise separate process streams for the liquid and solid fractions (sludge). The overall aim of treatment (in terms of solids) is: (i) to reduce to the minimum the amount of solids in the treated effluent in order to achieve discharge standards; and (ii) maximize the level of solids in the sludge in order to minimize the volume requiring further treatment and disposal.",

The screenings are usually removed from the process stream and disposed of separately by landfilling or incineration. Occasionally, screenings may be shredded (comminuted) to reduce their size and returned to the process stream. This may cause problems with downstream processes and, as a consequence, is rarely practised at works which incorporate secondary (biological) treatment. The other component of preliminary treatment is grit removal, which is accomplished in chambers (or channels) or by centrifugation, taking advantage of the greater settling velocities of these solids. The material is largely inorganic in nature and is usually disposed of to landfill.",

Factors affecting the amount of sludge applied to agricultural land include topography, land use, climatic conditions, and the availability of alternative means of disposal. In the UK, sludge production is increasing, principally as a result of the EU Directive on the treatment of urban wastewater (CEC, 1991) .

So-called 'enhanced' treatment processes, such as composting, lime addition and thermal drying, were capable of reducing numbers of E. coli to the detection limit of the analytical method. For all of these methods, over 90% of results showed bacterial reductions of 6 log or greater. Lagooning of sludge was capable of significantly reducing numbers of E. coli and, depending on the method of operation, reductions in the order of 5 log were observed. Mesophilic anaerobic digestion (MAD), the process carried out at the majority of sites surveyed, reduced numbers of E. coli by, on average, between 1.4 and 2.3 log depending on the solids content of the product. For sites producing a liquid product (2 -4% ds) 78% of all reductions for were in the range 1 to 2 log. Where digested sludge was subsequently dewatered to produce a cake, 89% of results showed reductions in the range 2 to 4 log.

The transmission of cryptosporidiosis is zoonotic and the possibility exists offoodborne infection arising from the use of sewage sludge in agriculture. Stadterman et al. (1995) found that a laboratory activated sludge plant removed 98.6% of seeded Cryptosporidium parvum oocysts. In a comparison of different treatment regimes, activated sludge and anaerobic digestion were found to be the most effective means of removing oocysts, the latter destroying 99.9% in 24 hours. Studies of anaerobic mesophilic digestion under laboratory conditions showed that oocysts added to the contents of a digester operating at 358C rapidly lost viability (as measured by excystation), decreasing to 17% after 3 days from an initial 81% viability (Whitmore and Robertson, 1995) . Losses of viability in distilled water and anaerobic sludge at 358C were similar, amounting to 90% after 18 days, indicating that the principal effect on viability was temperature. Oocysts exposed to mesophilic anaerobic digestion for 3 days and then stored for a further 14 days were completely inactivated. Aerobic digestion or pasteurization, both at 558C, caused 92% loss of viability in 5 minutes. Thermophilic anaerobic digestion at 508C resulted in complete inactivation within the first 24 hours (Whitmore and Robertson, 1995) .",

Relatively few cells (2% of total) were transported away from the soil surface and into the deeper layers of the soil. Run-off following heavy rainfall resulted in a loss from the soil of 7% of the E. coli applied in the slurry. A recent ecological study on predation of E. coli O157 by Acanthamoeba polyphaga has shown that the bacterial cells are capable of surviving and even replicating within this common environmental protozoan (Barker et al., 1999) .

In England and Wales, during 1999, there were nearly 5000 laboratory confirmed cases of cryptosporidiosis (n \u00bc 4759) (Anon, 2000a) ; in the USA the estimated number of cases is 300 000 of which 10% are believed to be foodborne (Mead et al., 1999) . Oocysts of C. parvum are environmentally hardy and, under certain conditions, may remain viable for many months. Survival studies in microcosms containing untreated river water showed that oocysts are extremely persistent, the times for 10 log reductions in viability being 160 days at 158C and 100 days at 58C (Medema et al., 1997) . Investigations into the survival in soils treated with sewage sludge showed that viability declined by 20 -40% at 208C over 44 days. Temperature was the principal factor affecting oocyst survival (Whitmore and Robertson, 1995) .",

The most relevant data were reported by Mawdsley and colleagues (1996a) who studied the transport of Cryptosporidium oocysts through soil following the application of slurry to a poorly draining silt clay loam soil. Bovine slurry seeded with 5 \u00a3 10 9 C. parvum oocysts was applied to the surface of soil blocks (80 cm \u00a3 56 cm \u00a3 20 cm) removed from a perennial ryegrass ley at an application rate equivalent to 50 m 3 /ha. The blocks were irrigated 24 h following slurry application and periodically thereafter. Samples of run-off (at 4 cm depth) and leachate (at 20 cm depth) were collected and the number of oocysts enumerated. After 70 days the blocks were destructively sampled and examined for the presence of oocysts. Experiments were carried out in triplicate. Numbers of oocysts leaching from the blocks declined from 8.4 \u00a3 10 6 on day 1 to 2.3 \u00a3 10 4 at day 70. Oocysts levels were consistently lower in run-off compared with the leachate from the base of the soil blocks. Numbers fell below the limit of detection after 21 days and 28 days in two blocks, but were detectable in the third block for the duration of the experiment (70 days). These results suggest that oocysts tend not to become associated with soil particles, being either transported away in run-off or moving vertically downwards through the soil column. The majority of oocysts were retained in the top 2 cm of soil (Mawdsley et al., 1996b) .",

This is particularly the case for the emerging pathogens such as STEC and Cryptosporidium. There have been attempts to assess the risks posed by Cryptosporidium in drinking water supplies (Gale, 1996 (Gale, , 1999 Haas, 2000) . However, the foodborne route has not been modelled, probably because of the received view that cryptosporidiosis is primarily waterborne, despite evidence demonstrating the potential for foodborne transmission. Cryptosporidium oocysts have been found on the surface of fresh, raw vegetables obtained from retail markets (Ortega et al., 1991; Monge et al., 1996) . In the UK, an outbreak of cryptosporidiosis affecting 50 school children was linked to the consumption of improperly pasteurized milk (Gelletli et al., 1997) . In the USA, outbreaks have been associated with the drinking fresh-pressed apple juice (non-alcoholic cider) (Millard et al., 1994) . Outbreaks of cryptosporidiosis associated with infected food-handlers demonstrate clearly the potential for significant foodborne transmission of Cryptosporidium (Besser-Wiek et al., 1996; Quiroz et al., 2000) . On the other hand, it is clear that STEC infection is primarily foodborne (Mead et al., 1999) . Data are required on the levels of STEC in treated sludge, their survival following land application and the potential for transfer to food crops before a microbiological risk assessment can be performed. Research is currently being undertaken to address these issues.",

The risks to human, animal and plant health were taken into account when developing the current regulations and codes of practice. The fundamental principle (for reducing disease transmission risk) implicit to these controls on the use of sludge in agriculture is the concept of imposing multiple barriers to the recycling of pathogens from sludge to their hosts. The effectiveness of this approach is borne out in practice as noted by the Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution (RCEP, 1996) which concluded that, 'There are no instances in the UK in which a link has been established between the controlled application of sewage sludge and occurrence of disease in the general population through water or food contamination'.
