As to March 10, 2020, a total of 80924 laboratory-confirmed cases had been reported in China, and 32778 confirmed cases overseas, which represents a trend of global spread(4). On 11 March 2020, the world health organization declared the COVID-19 as a global pandemic. Theoretically, the most effective strategy for epidemic is early diagnosis, quarantine and treatment. Therefore, how to diagnose COVID-19 early is of great importance. It's now the period of seasonal influenza, and the clinical symptoms of COVID-19 are similar to common respiratory diseases (influenza, common cold, viral pneumonia, etc.), which indicates the differential diagnosis are difficult for clinicians. At present, the diagnostic gold standard for studies had described the differences in clinical characteristics between ICU and non-ICU patients (7) (8) (9) (10) , however very few scientists focused on confirmed and unconfirmed groups (11) . Therefore, we described and compared the epidemiological history, clinical, laboratory characteristics and imaging features between confirmed and unconfirmed COVID-19 groups aim to providing a reference for the COVID-19 differential diagnosis, prevention and treatment.",

This was similar to SARS-CoV, which spread through the respiratory mucosa and infect other cells, triggering a series of inflammatory responses and cytokine storm, resulting in changes in lymphocytes (21) . Therefore, the reduced white blood cell count and lymphocytes could be used as a reference index for clinical diagnosis of COVID-19.

In addition, chest CT was helpful for monitoring the dynamic therapeutic effect of patients during treatment (27) . It was worth noting that 9 of the 62 confirmed COVID-19 patients in this study had no abnormal lesions in chest CT. Therefore, suspected cases with epidemiological history, clinical manifestations and abnormal laboratory tests should be diagnosed combined with the results of RT-PCR test.",

Of these patients, 4 cases (6.5%) were critically illness and 3 (4.8%) patients with asymptomatic infection. 8 (12.9%) of the patients in confirmed group had coexisting chronic diseases. The average time from epidemiological exposure to symptoms onset was 7.0 (3.5-9.0) days. A total of 31 (50.0%) patients were clustered and 2 patients had a history of exposure to the Huanan seafood market; 40 patients (71%) were residents of Wuhan or had visited the city; 29 (46.8%) cases with contact confirmed COVID-19 or febrile patients; exposure history was unknown in 12 (19.4%) patients. The most common symptoms on admission were fever (49 [79.0%]), dry cough (37 [59.7%]), fatigue or myalgia (15 [24.2%]). Less common symptoms were productive cough, diarrhea, chest tightness, headache, sore throat, upper airway congestion, dyspnea. In the unconfirmed patients, the average age was 41.3\u00b114.7 years (range 19-81 years), with 68 males (67.3%).
