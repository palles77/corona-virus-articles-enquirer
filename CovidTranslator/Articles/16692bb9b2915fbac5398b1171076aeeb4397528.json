The causal agent of this disease was found to be a coronavirus, and the disease was named severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) (1) . We are approaching the tenth anniversary of this dramatic event, which challenged public trust and government and health system capacity to address public health issues. What have we learned and what lessons have we acted upon during these years?",

The coronavirus has been structurally described, associated with likely animal reservoirs (bat and civet cat), and demonstrated to be transmitted by droplets and possibly by aerosolization and contact with contaminated fomites. Transmission seems relatively easy because the basic reproduction number (R 0 ) is 2.2-3.7, but transmission is greatly enhanced by occa-sional supertransmitters. The number of deaths from SARS is considerable; the case-fatality rate is \u224810%. Masks and other personal protective gear, along with active surveillance, case detection, contact tracing, isolation, and quarantine, were effective measures in reducing transmission. Even a relatively limited outbreak cost cities and countries many billions of dollars in lost business and productivity in addition to the human and economic costs of the extraordinary health and public health measures that were needed to identify and contain the disease (2) .",

            "text": "During and following the outbreak, 8 broader national and international policy, operational, and systems needs were identified by public health officials. The first need was stronger and more integrated coordination between animal and human public health. This need is currently being addressed in One Health efforts by the World Health Organization, the Food and Agriculture Organization, the World Organisation for Animal Health, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and the Public Health Agency of Canada (3). The second need was enhanced disease and symptom surveillance systems that would share information quickly within countries and across borders. The third need was capable and responsive public health laboratories whose crucial role in infectious disease outbreaks includes establishing the etiologic agent, confirming the diagnoses in clinically suspected cases, supporting surveillance activities, and providing insight into the most effective infection control practices. The fourth need was for infection control to be stressed constantly in all health care settings. The fifth need was for development of clear criteria for isolation and quarantine and evaluation of the effectiveness of such measures. Isolation and quarantine were applied inconsistently with varied and often vague criteria (travel from an infected country, fever, sitting in an airplane near a traveler suspected of having SARS). Several sites believed that their isolation and quarantine efforts were helpful in reducing disease spread (4, 5) . The sixth need was for making risk assessment and communication as necessary components of the public health skill set to be used continuously during a health threat to a population (6) . The seventh need was a prompt and practiced public health response with broad geopolitical responsibility and authority, spanning and linking political jurisdictions from municipalities to states/provinces to national and global levels. This response is better performed when preparedness training and a national incident response system have been routinely incorporated into the public health system. The eighth need was for national public health institutes (NPHIs) that have value in preventing and controlling outbreaks and other health threats (7) . Even in the absence of an NPHI, the success of such entities in time of health crisis argues for at least establishing a central focus for coordination and leadership with delegated responsibility and authority.",

Yet, despite their differences in history, scope, and resources, NPHIs all provide core public health functions that improve the efforts of their countries to address health challenges within and beyond their borders. These functions include population health assessment, health protection (surveillance and response), disease and injury prevention, health promotion, and research (evidence to inform policies and programs). In many countries, the NPHI plays a major role in developing and supporting local capacity, at the municipal and state/ provincial levels, through training, technical assistance, tools, guidelines, staff assignments, and financing.",

The second benefit is increased capacity to mount a quick, decisive, and coordinated response during a public health emergency. More than 80 NPHIs are organizationally linked through the International Association of National Public Health Institutes (IANPHI) (8), which promotes creation of new NPHIs (in Mozambique, Guinea-Bissau, and El Salvador) and assists in expanding the breadth and depth of existing NPHIs (e.g., in Uganda, Nigeria, Togo, Morocco, Ghana, C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, Rwanda, Bangladesh, Ethiopia, Tanzania).
