Infections of bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV) and bovine 25 parainfluenza virus-3 (BPI-3) are among the important contributing factors for the development 26 of pneumonia in young animals. These viral agents either primarily cause pneumonia or 27 predispose animals to the development of pneumonia. Although, the role of BRSV and BPI-3 in 28 the pathogenesis of pneumonia is well established, there are no reports of involvement of BRSV 29 and BPI-3 from Indian cattle and buffaloes suffering from pneumonia. In the present 30 investigation, we performed postmortem examinations of 406 cattle and buffaloes which were 31 below twelve months of age. Out of 406 cases, twelve (2.95%) cases were positive for BRSV 32 and fifteen (3.69%) cases were positive for BPI-3, screened by reverse transcriptase polymerase 33 chain reaction (RT-PCR). Further, positive cases were confirmed by sequence analysis of RT-34 PCR amplicons and direct immunofluorescence antibody test (d-FAT) in paraffin-embedded 35 lung tissue sections. BRSV positive cases revealed characteristic findings of bronchiolar 36 epithelial necrosis, thickened alveolar septa by mononuclear cells infiltration and edema; 37 alveolar lumens were filled with mononuclear cells and numerous syncytial cells were seen 38 having intracytoplasmic inclusions. The BRSV antigen distribution was found to be in 39 bronchiolar and alveolar epithelium and syncytial cells in the lung sections. In fifteen cases 40 where BPI-3 was detected, bronchointerstitial pneumonia in the majority of cases with thickened 41 alveolar septa by mild macrophage infiltration, hyperplasia of type-II pneumocytes and 42 bronchiolar necrosis along with syncytial cells having intracytoplasmic inclusions in the majority 43 of cases were observed. The BPI-3 antigen distribution was found to be in bronchiolar and 44 alveolar epithelium and syncytial cells in the lung sections. RT-PCR amplicons of BRSV and 45 BPI-3 obtained were sequenced and their analysis showed homology with already available 46 sequences in the NCBI database. It is the first report of detection of BRSV and BPI-3 from 47 pneumonic cases by RT-PCR and d-FAT from cattle and buffaloes of India, indicating the need 48 for more epidemiological studies. 49 employment opportunities and provides social and financial security. In the course of 67 development of livestock industry, the health of replacement progeny calves is an important 68 component of total operation profitability as the heifer calf is the foundation of the future herd 69 (Razzaque et al., 2009). However, calves are usually neglected as they do not bring any 70 immediate financial return and the cost of their maintenance considerably adds to the production 71 cost of milk. Pneumonia is associated with high morbidity and mortality of calves and incurs 72 great economic losses to the farmers due to the losses by death, treatment costs, reduced growth 73 and productivity (Mellado et al., 2014). It is estimated that calf mortality of 20% can reduce the 74 net profit of an enterprise by 40% (Blood and Radostits, 2007). 75 Some calf diseases can result of the complex interaction of the management practices, the 76 environment factors, infectious agents and the calf's immune system (Wudu, 2004). Pneumonia 77 is the second major cause of morbidity and mortality among calves after diarrhea and may 78 account for 50% mortality in the affected animals (Veena and Sumathi, 2011). It is the most 79 common postmortem finding in calves at 1-5 months of age and calf morbidity may go up to 80 50% in a herd (Manjari et al., 2015). It is the most important contributor to the losses in the beef 81 and dairy cattle industries on account of the cost incurred on the metaphylactic and therapeutic 82 uses of antibiotics and reduced growth performance of affected animals (Gagea et al., 2006). 83 Pneumonia in young animals is associated with viruses, bacteria and mycoplasma, which 84 include bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV), bovine parainfluenza virus type 3 (BPI-3), 85 bovine herpesvirus type 1, bovine viral diarrhea virus, bovine coronavirus, Pasteurella 86 multocida, Mannheimia. hemolytica, Haemophilus somnus, Salmonella dublin, Arcanobacterium 87 pyogenes and Mycoplasma spp. (e.g. M. bovis and M. dispar) (Bednarek et al., 2012).

The BPI-3, 103 a negative sense RNA virus of Respirovirus genus under Paramyxoviridae family, contributes to 104 tissue damage and immunosuppression in stressed calves resulting in severe bronchopneumonia 105 from secondary bacterial infection. Clinically, BPI-3 infection may be manifested with 106 asymptomatic to severe respiratory illness; however, in most cases, the clinical signs include 107 coughing, fever and nasal discharge (Maidana et al., 2012). 108 Pneumonia in bovines represents a great threat to animal health, farm welfare and 109 profitability, despite the large availability of antimicrobials, vaccines and anti-inflammatory 110 drugs for treatment and prevention in the country. Currently, among all respiratory 111pathogens, Pasteurella spp. has been most commonly reported to be associated with pneumonia,",

            "text": "associated with many abiotic and biotic factors and is the result of 255 interactions between a wide range of pathogens, and other stresses (Lorenz et al., 2011). There 256 are multiple reports in the literature, indicating respiratory affections as one of the important 257 causes of morbidity and mortality, specifically in young animals. Viruses like BRSV and BPI-3 258 play an important role in the development of pneumonia (Murray et al., 2017). Although these 259 viruses have been shown to be primary respiratory pathogens in experimental studies, they can 260 compromise the pulmonary defenses thereby facilitating bacterial colonization and pathogenesis 261 of pneumonia (Booker et al., 2008). However, there are no reports of involvement of BRSV and 262 BPI-3 in the cases of pneumonia from India in cattle and buffaloes.263Hence, the present study was planned to detect BRSV and BPI-3 and examine 264 pathological processes involved in fatal cases of pneumonia. Young animals aged less than 12 265 months were selected since pneumonia is primarily a problem in young calves less than 6 months 266 with peak occurrence from 2 to 10 weeks, but it can be noticed more frequently in calves up to 1 267 year of age(Sivula et al., 1996). Calves vis-a-vis adult animals often suffer because of the 268 waning influence of maternal immunity, and their own still relatively na\u00efve immune system.pneumonic cases of bovines by RT-PCR. Although BRSV is well recognized as one of the major 271 pathogens associated with bovine respiratory disease complex (BRDC) from many countries 272 (Valarcher and Taylor 2007; Sacco et al., 2014), no systematic studies have been carried out for 273 the investigation of BRSV in the ruminant population of India, barring few reports viz. 274 seroprevalence of 65.33% in cattle in Orissa (Hazari et al., 2002), 47.06% in cattle and buffaloes 275 in Punjab (Goswami et al., 2017) and 50% in cattle in Himachal Pradesh (Katoch et al., 2017) by 276 using ELISA. In the present study, the frequency of BRSV detection was determined to be 277 2.95% (12/406) by RT-PCR which is lower as compared to the earlier seroprevalence reports of 278 BRSV from India. This is because of repeated exposure of adult animals vis-\u00e0-vis calves to the 279 virus infection throughout their life as well as possibility of re-infections (Hoppe et al., 2018).280Moreover, in the present study, the lung tissues were also screened for the detection of BRSV 281 antigen unlike earlier reports of serosurveillance.282 Grossly, BRSV positive lungs were observed with cranioventral consolidation, 283 emphysema, edema and deflation of diaphragmatic lobes and swollen edematous 284 tracheobronchial lymph nodes. The observations are in concordance with the earlier findings of 285 Andrews and Kennedy (1997) and Sacco et al. (2014). Microscopically, characteristic lesions of 286 bronchointerstitial pneumonia were observed in ten cases and few were diagnosed as fibrinous 287 bronchopneumonia and interstitial pneumonia. Similar findings were also reported by Gershwin 288 et al. (2015) and Blodorn et al. (2015). The presence of bronchointerstitial pneumonia with 289 multinucleated syncytia and inclusions in the present study are in consonance with the findings 290 of Brodersen (2010) in the BRSV affected animals. It is because of the replication of the virus in 291 the alveolar macrophages and F glycoprotein induces fusion of the infected cells, formation of 292 syncytia and spreads to the adjacent cells (Schrijver, 1998). BRSV is a known primary pathogen 293 pathogens as also reported earlier (Panciera and Confer, 2010). BRSV has a special predilection 295 to ciliated bronchiolar epithelium, it's attachment to the ciliated epithelial cells is mediated by 296 the heparin binding domains on G glycoprotein (Sacco, 2012). Findings of fibrinous 297 bronchopneumonia with the presence of fibrinous exudate with inflammatory cells and 298 interstitial pneumonia were in accordance with earlier reports (Murray et al., 2017). It may be 299 due to the release of a cascade of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the infected cell, recruiting 300 neutrophils, lymphocytes, and macrophages to the affected area (Caswell and Williams, 2016).301 The BRSV antigen was demonstrated in the cytoplasm of bronchiolar and alveolar epithelium 302 and syncytial cells as observed previously (Flore et al., 2000; Ceribasi et al., 2014). Flore et al. 303 (2000) reported 19.5% (7/41) incidence by indirect immunofluorescence (IFA) in young cattle 304 from Brazil. All the four sequences of partial fragment of BRSV were closely related to 305 sequences from Belgium, Brazil, USA and UK (Prozzi et al., 1997; Almeida et al., 2006; Yunus 306 et al., 2001; Furze et al., 1997) and distantly related to selected BRSV sequences from Denmark, 307 Czech Republic and France (Larsen et al., 2000; Valentova et al., 2005; Valarcher et al., 2000).",

In India, 313 there are few reports of BPI-3 associated sero-prevalence of 27.81% (Goswami et al., 2017) and 314 57.58% (Katoch et al., 2017) in Punjab and Himachal Pradesh, respectively. Variable incidence 315 of BPI-3 has been reported as 13% and 14.81% by Klima et al. (2014) and Murray et al. (2017), 316 respectively in young cattle from North America and Ireland. In the present study, an incidence of 3.69 % of BPI-3 was observed by RT-PCR from pneumonic young cattle and buffaloes which 318 could be due to selection of younger animals and their less exposure to the viral agents. 319 Grossly, BPI-3 positive lungs were associated with focal to multifocal consolidation of 320 cranio-ventral lobes with the firm to a rubbery consistency and emphysema/edema in the 321 diaphragmatic lobes leading to failure of the lungs to collapse.

These mechanisms lead to the suboptimal mucociliary 334 escalator and depressed local cellular immune response which is may be the reason for the 335 development of severe lesions of fibrinous and suppurative bronchopneumonia observed in the 336 present study.
