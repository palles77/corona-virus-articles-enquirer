Now as an ornamental groundcover, Lonicera japonica commonly planted in many areas for sprawling habit, numerous sweetly fragrant white flowers, attractive evergreen foliage, and become naturalized in Argentina, Brazil, Mexico, Australia, New Zealand and United States. Due to Lonicera japonica has escaped from cultivation in several places, becoming a major nuisance, and is restricted in parts of North America and New Zealand (Starr et al., 2003) . But in China, 1500 years ago, Lonicera japonica has been planted largely in Fengqiu county of Henan province, and the flowers of Lonicera japonica have been used as the local and traditional medicine in clinical practice for the treatment of exopathogenic wind-heat, epidemic febrile diseases, sores, carbuncles, furuncles and some infection diseases. Scine 1995, Lonicera japonica has been listed in the Pharmacopoeia of the People's Republic of China and more than 500 prescriptions containing Lonicera japonica have been used to treat various diseases in China (http://www.zysj.com.cn). The modern pharmacological studies showed that Lonicera japonica and its active principles possessed wide pharmacological actions, such as antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, antiviral, antiendotoxin, blood fat reducing, antipyretic and other activities (Wang, 2008c) . Most of these actions matched to those traditional uses seriously. At the same time, it was also used as food, healthy beverage in the world (Wang, 2010) . Along with Lonicera japonica being used and cultivated in more and more countries, the chemical compounds have been extensively studied. Essential oils, organic acids, flavones, saponins, iridoids and inorganic elements as the main compositions were isolated and identified. Among of them, essential oils and chlorogenic acid have been proved with some good pharmacological effects, and were though as the active compounds of Lonicera japonica. In current Chinese Pharmacopoeia (Committee for the Pharmacopoeia of PR China, 2010), chlorogenic acid (1) has been officially used as the indicator compound to characterize the quality of this herb.",

The flowering duration of individual plant is usually 5-8 days, but the flowering period is from May to September in the field, can be divided into six stages, i.e. the juvenile bud stage, the third green stage, the second white stage, the complete white stage, the silver flowering stage and the gold flowering stage. Lonicera japonica often grows in hillside scrub, rocks pile and roadside, and the highest altitude is 1500 m. Due to its beautiful flowers and strong roots, Lonicera japonica was cultivated for people to watch, conserve water and soil in world. In traditional Chinese medicine, due to the outline form of sprawling and twining lianas, and the different flower colors, the dried flowers or flower buds of Lonicera japonica was named as Jin Yin Hua and Ren Dong in TCM. Both the chemical contents and compositions of Lonicera japonica flowers vary in a floweringdependent characteristic with the collection time ( Fig. 1) . ",

The important components that characterize the volatiles of honeysuckle flowers were identified as linalool, (Z)-jasmone, (Z)-jasmin lactone, methyl jasmonate, and methyl epi-jasmonate. In addition, changes of the volatile components emitted from the living flowers throughout the whole day were investigated by dynamic headspace analysis using GC and GC-MS, and the strongest odor was found to be emitted in the middle of the night (Ikeda et al., 1994) . In 2010, Feng (2010) identified the content of chlorogenic acid from Lonicera japonica in different habitats by TLC. Results showed the content were 3.43%, 3.14%, 1.62% and 2.11% in Shanxi, Shandong, Hubei and Henan, respectively.",

The mainly increased compositions were low molecular number and low-boiling point compounds. But the compounds with high content were similar at each month, which were linalool (13.47%, 13.47%, 7.92%), dibutylphthalate (10.26%, 7.54%, 7.67%) and carvacrol (7.92%, 10.09% and 6.67%). Then, the highest levels of chlorogenic acid were found at the second white and complete white flowering stages. The results indicated that the best time to harvest Lonicera japonica flowers for essential oils was the silver flowering stage, and for chlorogenic acid was the second white or complete white flowering stage . Wu et al. (2009) has analyzed the components of essential oils in different parts of Lonicera japonica. 85 compounds were identified with GC-MS method, and only seven of which were mutual in the buds, leaves and stems, the main compounds were benzaidehyde, hexadecanoic acid, diethyl phthalate and hexadecanoyl, respectively. At the same time, the marked difference was showed in the main compositions of the buds, leaves and stems. The content of alkanes in stems was the highest, and in leaves was the lowest; the content of aldehydes in leaves was the highest, and in buds was the lowest; the content of the acids in buds was the highest, and in stems was not found. This difference of the chemical compositions implied the leaves and stems could not be used as the succedaneum of the buds in TCM.",

This extract directly inhibited both COX-1 and COX-2 activity, the expression of IL-1\u2424-induced COX-2 protein and mRNA. But higher dose of the extract was required to suppress the expression of mRNA than protein. This result indicated that the extract acted translationally or post-translationally at lower doses and transcriptionally or post-transcriptionally at higher doses (Xu et al., 2007) . Kang et al. examined the effect of water fraction of Lonicera japonica on trypsin-induced mast cell (HMC-1) activation. After stimulated with trypsin (100 M), Lonicera japonica could inhibit TNF-\u2423 secretion, tryptase mRNA expression and trypsin-induced ERK phosphorylation at a dose-dependent manner. However, it did not affect the trypsin activity even with 1000 g/ml. These all indicated that Lonicera japonica might inhibit trypsin-induced mast cell activation through the inhibition of ERK phosphorylation than the inhibition of trypsin activity (Kang et al., 2004) . On the other hand, the anti-inflammatory effects of water extract in proteinaseactivated receptor 2 (PAR2)-mediated mouse paw edema has been investigated. The results indicated that at doses of 50, 100 and 200 mg/kg o.p., it showed significant inhibition of both change in paw thickness and vascular permeability induced by PAR2, the inhibition rates were 41.8%, 69.1%, 70.9%, and 40.2%, 69.7%, 68.8%, respectively. The water extracts (100 mg/kg) also significantly inhibited PAR2 agonists-induced myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity and TNF-\u2423 expression in paw tissue. (Tae et al., 2003 ) Su et al.

The ratio of IC 50 of these two compounds for HIV-1 RT and HDNAP-\u2423 was 2.0 and 2.2. While 3,4di-O-caffeoylquinic acid (8) and methyl 3,4-di-O-caffeoylquinic acid (31) exhibited higher inhibitory effects on HDNAP-\u2423 than HIV-1 RT (Chang et al., 1995) .

In 2009, Rahman et al. evaluated the antibacterial potential of essential oil from flowers and ethanol extracts from leaf. A remarkable antibacterial effect of the oil and extracts has been revealed against Listederia monocytogenes ATCC 19116, Bacillus subtilis ATCC 6633, Bacillus cereus SCK 111, Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 6538 and KCTC 1916), and Salmonella enteritidis KCTC 12021, Salmanella typhimurium KCTC 2515, Enterobacter aerogenes KCTC 2190 and Escherichia coli ATCC 8739. The diameters of inhibitions zone were 20. 3, 17.8, 15.2, 16.3, 14.1, 15.3, 14.0, 12.4, 12.1, and 16.2, 15.4, 14.0, 15.0, 14.1, 14.1, 14.2, 12.2, 10.3 mm, respectively. MIC values were 62.5, 62.5, 250, 125, 250, 125, 250, 500, 500, and 125, 125, 250, 125, 125, 250, 250, 500 , 500 g/ml. These findings suggested that the oil and extracts from Lonicera japonica may be a potential source of preservatives for the food or pharmaceutical industries (Rahman and Kang, 2009) . And the antibacterial activities, against Bacillus cereus and Staphylococcus aureus, of the floral bud from Lonicera japonica were found by agar-well diffusion method in vitro. The diameters of inhibition zone were 6.3 and 7.2 mm, and this activity may be closely associated with the existence of phenolic constituents (Shan et al., 2007) . Meanwhile Lonicera japonica also has showed the marked antibacterial activity against fourteen strains, including Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus hemolyticus, Escherichia coli, Bacillus dysenteriae, Bacillus comma, Bacillus typhosus, Bacillus paratyphosus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Bacillus tuberculosis, Streptococcus mutans, Bacillus adhaerens, Bacteroides melanogenicus and Haemophilus actinomycetemcomitans, and so on. And the antibacterial study against different serotypes of Streptococcus mutans demonstrated that the extracts of Lonicera japonica could inhibit 87.5% strains with MIC 25 mg/ml (Sun, 2002; Song et al., 2003) .",

The reducing power of the polysaccharides has a direct correlation between antioxidant activity and concentration of certain plant extracts, and ultra-filtration fraction has a significant inhibit effect on superoxide radicals generated in a PMS/NADA/NBT system. Administered to rats, crude polysaccharides extracts (50-400 mg/kg) could reduce lipid peroxidate malony dialdehyde (MDA) content, improve glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) and catalase (CAT) activity, and enhance significantly superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity in serum and tissue (Li, 2008b) . Lan et al. (2007) used the biochemical method to investigate the activity and scavenging capability on free radicals of the membrane-protecting enzyme, which was extracted from flower bud, leaf and wattle of Lonicera japonica in different harvest time. The activity of the enzyme was increased since April and reached the highest level in June. The activity of the enzyme extracted from leaf was higher than those from flower bud and wattle, and the scavenging capacity of the extract from the flower bud on OH and H 2 O 2 free radicals was stronger than those from leaf and wattle. Meanwhile the scavenging capacities on free radicals of five medicinal plants of Lonicerae from several provinces of China have been investigated. All the samples showed the scavenging capacities on three kinds of free radicals (O 2 \u2212 , \u2212 OH, H 2 O 2 ) at some extent, and the samples from Henan and Shandong showed stronger scavenging capacities than those from Jiangsu province.

The apoptosis induced by PDT combined with Lonicera japonica extract was accompanied by DNA condensation, externalization of phosphatidylserine and formation of apoptotic bodies, it showed to be caspase-3-independent apoptosis via activation of AIF. P38associated pathway may be involved in apoptosis induced by PDT with Lonicera japonica in CH27 cells. These demonstrated that they induced CH27 cells apoptosis was probably related to its ability to change the protein expression and distribution of heat shock protein 27 (Leung et al., 2008) . When the aqueous extract of Lonicera japonica (100 g/ml) was applied to the HepG2 cells, the lysates of the treated cells were associated with increased stimulatory phosphorylation of JNK and p38 as compared to the basal value, similarly to the MAPK activation profile of PCA. Further experiments showed that this aqueous extract also decreased the viability of HepG2 cells to 50%. So Yip thought that the aqueous extract of Lonicera japonica could trigger HepG2 cell death in a JNK-dependent manner (Yip et al., 2006) .",

The content of luteolin and chlorogenic acid in the Flos Lonicera should be more than 0.1% and 1.5%. An efficient microwave-assisted extraction (MAE) technique has been developed to extract chlorogenic acid from flower buds of Lonicera japonica. The yield of chlorogenic acid rapidly reached 6.14% within 5 min under the optimal MAE conditions, i.e. 50% ethanol as extraction solvent, 1:10 (w/v) of the solid/liquid ratio and 60 \u2022 C of extraction temperature . Today, with the development of modern separation and identify techniques, it is widely accepted that the quality cannot be measured by mono-content. As the main and effective components of Lonicera japonica, essential oils and flavones were paid attention to qualitative and quantitative analysis Lonicera japonica. In 2008, Wang et al. (2008d) used normal HPLC-MS to separate and analyze the essential oils. 192 compounds were identified, and this technology provided the better method to analyze the chemical compounds of Lonicera japonica and should be beneficial for the study of the contents and active compounds.",

By accurate mass measurements within 4 ppm error for each molecular ion and subsequent fragment ions, as well as the 'full mass spectral' information of TOF-MS, a total of 41 compounds including 13 iridoid glycosides, 11 phenolic acids, 7 saponins, and 10 flavonoids were identified in a methanolic extract (Qi et al., 2009) . In order to differentiate the sources and comprehensively control the quality of this medicinal plant, Chen et al. (2007) thought coupled with principal component analysis would be a well acceptable strategy. At the same time, capillary electrophoresis with electrochemical detection (CE-ED) also was employed to analyze active ingredients of Lonicera japonica. Operating in a walljet configuration, a 300 mm diameter carbon-disk electrode was used as the working electrode, which exhibits a good response at +0.90 V (vs. saturated calomel electrode) for four analytes. Under the optimum conditions, the analytes were baseline separated within 20 min in a 50 mmol/L borax buffer (pH 8.7). Notably, excellent linearity was obtained over two orders of magnitude with detection limits (S/N = 3) ranging from 0.1 to 0.5 mg/L for all the analytes (Peng et al., 2005) .",

It has been recognized as a rapid and reliable means for the identification and qualification of herbal medicines. Li et al. (2006) has employed the binary chromatographic profiling in fingerprint analysis of Lonicera japonica, Correlation analysis showed that six chromatographic peaks in ethanol extract were positively correlated with in vitro bacteriostasis activity. Two standard fingerprints were developed with 10 genuine samples of Lonicera japonica. Similarity analysis with a limited number of samples showed a fair consistence in the chromatographic profiling of Lonicera japonica from various sources and two harvests, and significant differences from other species. Combination use of the two fingerprints demonstrated confirmative identification and quality assessment of Lonicera japonica. Thanabhorn et al. (2006) has evaluated the acute and subacute toxicity of the ethanol extract from the leaves of Lonicera japonica. The single oral dose of the ethanol extract at 5000 mg/kg did not produce mortality or significant changes in the general behavior and gross appearance of the internal organs of rats. In subacute toxicity study, the ethanol extract was administered orally at a dose of 1000 mg/kg/day for a period of 14 days. The satellite group was treated with the ethanol extract at the same dose and the same period and kept for another 14 days after treatment. There were no significant differences in the body and organ weights between the control and the treated group of both sexes. Hematological analysis and clinical blood chemistry revealed no toxicity effects of the extract. Pathologically, neither gross abnormalities nor histopathological changes were observed. Then, Chang et al. (2003) assessed the toxicological assessment on food safety of the flower bud of Lonicera japonica. Acute toxicity test showed LD 50 > 15 g/kg Bw. on mice orally. And micronucleus test of bone marrow cell and Salmanella typhimurium/mammals microsomal enzyme test showed it was safe without mutagenesis. Meanwhile no toxicity test on mice and in antifertility test on SD female mouse. In summary, the extract was found to be fairly nontoxic when oral acute and subacute toxicities in rats were performed. Chronic toxicity study is needed for further support the safe use of this plant.",

But recently, chlorogenic acid and luteolin were found in other medicinal plants, and even the contents were higher than Lonicera japonica (Committee for the Pharmacopoeia of PR China, 2010). So employing chlorogenic acid and luteolin to control the quality of Lonicera japonica lacked specificity. At the same time, Wu suggested that the antibacterial of the flavones of fresh flower buds were 4 times of chlorogenic acid, and iridoids were also presented the marked biology activities (Wu et al., 2001) . The different habitat, harvest's time, medicinal parts, extraction methods, fresh flowers and dry flowers would result in the different chemical compositions and the quality of Lonicera japonica. So, how to exclusively and accurately control the quality of Lonicera japonica in TCM and preparations should be studied further.",
