            "text": "Worldwide, the leading cause of paediatric mortality and morbidity in the postneonatal period remains lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs). The WHO (World Health Organization) estimated that more than 800 000 of the 5.6 million total deaths in children less than 5 years old were caused by LRTIs in 2016. 1 A meta-analysis found a hospital-based case-fatality ratio of 6.1% in children in lowincome countries with severe LRTI, compared with 3.9% in high-income countries. 2 Children with LRTI can present with a highly variable package of symptoms including cough, tachypnoea, dyspnoea, fever, rhinitis, chest pain, abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhoea, headache and lethargy. The WHO guidelines states tachypnoea as the main diagnostic criterion for pneumonia requiring an antibiotic. 3 However, distinction from upper airway infections and other illnesses such as asthma/bronchiolitis, anaemia or malaria can be challenging when minimal diagnostic tools are available. 4 Furthermore, in many low-and middle-income countries, treatment policies are empiric or based on foreign guidelines, due to a lack of local causal studies. 5 These could be reasons why research has discovered an overdiagnosis and overprescription of antibiotics to treat pneumonia in low-income countries. 6 One of the biggest public health problems of this century is antimicrobial resistance. It threatens the effective treatment of major infections and is induced by an overuse and inappropriate usage of antibiotics. 7 This phenomena has major consequences: higher health-related costs because of the necessity of more expensive antibiotics, rising mortality rates due to Pathogens Causing Respiratory Tract Infections in Children Less Than 5 Years of Age in Senegal 2 Microbiology Insights untreatable infections and an increasing danger for the immunosuppressed patient. 7, 8 Moreover, viral causes of LRTIs have become seemingly more important. 9 Ancient studies in mostly Western countries frequently described Haemophilus influenza B (Hib), Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Moraxella catarrhalis as major causative pathogens of LRTIs. 10, 11 Nonetheless, while in 2000, S pneumoniae was responsible for 600 000 deaths in children, in 2015, this number dropped to 294 000 children. 12 Recent developments, such as the implementation of the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine and the Hib vaccine, are responsible for a reduction in the burden of these respiratory bacteria but may also have induced a shift in the pathogens causing LRTIs. 9, 13 Recent research in Senegal indicated viruses as main pathogens of all acute respiratory tract infections (ARTIs), both upper and lower. The frequency of virus detection was even higher than those found in several other countries. 14,15 Viruses most commonly found in Senegal were respiratory syncytial virus (RSV ), adenovirus, rhinovirus, influenza virus A, enterovirus, human bocavirus, and parainfluenza viruses. 16 Furthermore, there are indications that nowadays ARTIs are more often caused by the sequential or concurrent interaction of different pathogens and that the presence of multiple organisms is linked with the existence of a LRTI and with severity of disease. 17, 18 To reduce paediatric mortality caused by LRTI, while fighting antibiotic resistance, more knowledge about the cause of respiratory infections, especially in low-and middle-income countries, is essential. Case-control studies have been conducted in Africa, investigating the association between different pathogens and pneumonia. These studies found strongest associations for S pneumoniae, Bordetella pertussis, RSV, influenza virus A, and human metapneumovirus. [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] However, these studies were conducted in hospitalized settings while most children with LRTI are treated in primary care clinics.",

They found a lower prevalence of S pneumoniae (18% of cases) in comparison with our study (48% of cases) and a prevalence of M cattharalis of 15% where we did not detect this pathogen. Dieng et al used different swab sampling techniques (bronchoalveolar lavage, sinus fluids, and throat swab) depending on the site of infection. Moraxella cattharalis causes otitis media and sinusitis rather than LRTI, possibly explaining the higher detection rate. 30 Furthermore, their study covered a full year, including all seasons. Although our study was conducted during 2 months, it covered the rainy season, which is known for its respiratory infections. 15 Streptococcus pneumoniae was the most prevalent bacteria in our sample. Recent case-control studies in low-income countries found similar prevalence in cases and controls, even though those countries have lower vaccination coverages. 19, 21, 24, 31 In Western countries with a similar vaccination coverage to Senegal, S pneumoniae rates in children with ARTI are evidently lower than we detected. 32 Possibly, disease burden of S pneumoniae is high in Senegal due to serotype replacement following the introduction of the pneumococcal vaccine, as has occurred in many other countries. 33 Staphylococcus aureus is a bacteria frequently detected in these studies. 19, 21, 24 They used nasal/nasopharyngeal swabs, but the literature does not mention major differences in detection of S aureus between nose or throat. 34 Another explanation is the use of PCR for detection of bacteria.",

Furthermore, it confirms a generally shifting pattern towards viruses of pathogens causing ARTIs. Some pathogens were more prevalent in other settings, such as human metapneumovirus, PIV, and Mycoplasma pneumoniae. 19, 22, 24, 42, 43 Low prevalence of these pathogens was found in our study, possibly due to seasonality or their possible higher prevalence in severe infections.",

Approximately 90% of cases have been treated with antibiotics, whereas only 31.7% had a pneumonia and should have been treated as such following WHO criteria. Moreover, most of the antibiotic treatments concerned broad-spectrum antibiotics, whereas a narrow-spectrum penicillin is recommended in the primary care setting. Literature confirms that practices are similar in other low-income countries. [44] [45] [46] The main strength of this study is the inclusion of all ARTIs within a primary care clinic. This gives insight into the pathogens causing the infections. Other strengths are the large number of pathogens tested for, with PCR and culture testing for bacteria, and the inclusion of treatment methods. An additional strength is that all data were gathered by one researcher, hereby decreasing the risk of variation in swabbing technique.",

Furthermore, selection bias could have occurred, because no matching was done. The average age of controls is lower than the average age of children with a respiratory infection, probably due to the young age of children enrolled in vaccination programmes. However, we did not discern significant heterogeneity regarding pathogens in different age groups (except for the mentioned differences in prevalence of RSV ) or living areas. Another limitation is the use of only throat swabs. The nasopharyngeal swab is found to be superior in detecting influenza virus, S pneumoniae, and Moraxella species, but oropharyngeal swabs are superior for the detection of M pneumoniae and H influenzae. [47] [48] [49] [50] It is preferable to use both techniques, but limited resources inhibited that. There was a lack of a gold standard such as chest X-ray for pneumonia. By taking a clinical definition of ARTI, there is possible overlap with other feverish diseases such as malaria and gastrointestinal illnesses. Other limitations are the short duration of the study and a lack of follow-up data of patients due to nonresponse to phone calls. We might have missed data on severity of illness and hospitalizations.",

In this population, illness was mainly caused by influenza virus A and B, RSV, and S pneumoniae, which confirms a generally shifting pattern towards viruses in pathogens causing ARTIs. We suggest continuation of this case-control study for a full year, and further research on serotypes and resistance patterns of bacteria present in children with ARTI.

We recommend reduction of antibiotics prescription, especially broad-spectrum antibiotics, for children with an ARTI visiting a primary care clinic.",
