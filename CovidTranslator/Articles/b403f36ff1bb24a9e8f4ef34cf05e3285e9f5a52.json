Additional impact of recent outbreak on the global and state economies further complicates decision making on admissions, given high projected rates of hospitalizations and deaths. Early lung manifestations of COVID-19 infection consist of peripheral and basal predominant ground-glass opacities progressing to organizing pneumonia pattern in the later stage 2,4 . Notwithstanding that nearly 50% of patients imaged in the first 2 days after the symptom onset had normal chest CT 4 , serial CT imaging is valuable in assessing progression of lung abnormalities 2,4 . Accuracy of CT diagnosis of COVID-19 infection depends on radiological expertise due to the complex morphological patterns of lung involvement that can change in extent and appearance over time. The limited number of subspecialtytrained thoracic radiologists hampers reliable interpretation of complex chest examinations in Iran and other developing countries, where general radiologists and occasionally clinicians interpret chest imaging. Furthermore, in order to reduce exposure in healthcare settings during an epidemic, health services limit referrals to subspecialty medical centers.The availability of radiology imaging equipment is an important part of high-quality patient care, particularly in developing countries.
