However, the techniques to identify and produce such antibodies tend to be arduous and sometimes the heavy and light chain pair of the antibodies are dissociated. Here, we describe a relatively simple, straightforward protocol to produce human recombinant monoclonal antibodies from human peripheral blood mononuclear cells using immortalization with Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) and Toll-like receptor 9 activation. With an adequate staining, B cells producing antibodies can be isolated for subsequent immortalization and clonal expansion. The antibody transcripts produced by the immortalized B cell clones can be amplified by PCR, sequenced as corresponding heavy and light chain pairs and cloned into immunoglobulin expression vectors. The antibodies obtained with this technique can be powerful tools to study relevant human immune responses, including autoimmunity, and create the basis for new therapeutics.",

            "text": "In this paper, we describe in detail the technology that we use for the development of IgG human antibodies, with a complete overview of all the steps from PBMC isolation to the in vitro antibody generation. This protocol can be used for the analysis of any type of human IgG profile. In our laboratory, B cells producing IgG antibodies have been successfully separated from the rest of PBMCs after sorting. Fifty sorted B cells 8 can then be plated in multi-well plates and immortalized by EBV and TLR-9 activation, for the clonal expansion of single B cells. As feeder cells, fibroblasts from human embryonic lung tissue have been used, cell line wi38, which facilitates the visualization of the immortalized B cells. From these B cells, the sequences of the heavy and light chains of the immunoglobulin can be obtained by PCR, and the antibodies' genes cloned in immunoglobulin G expression vectors and produced in vitro. Using this technique, single antibodies with exactly the same antibody sequence found in the donor can be studied. resuspended in complete RPMI medium, or with wi38 attached to the culture flask and trypsinized after the irradiation. Follow the method for trypsinization indicated by the supplier of wi38 cells. Irradiate the number of cells necessary to cover the wells needed for plating IgG+ B cells (1% of the total PBMC counted in step 1.11). 3. Plate 90 \u00b5l containing 5,000 irradiated wi38 cells in each well of the 96 round well plate. Leave the wells in the outside row of the plate empty (because they evaporate faster), and only use the 60 wells in the middle of the plate for plating cells. Fill the outer wells that are framing the plate with 200 \u00b5l of PBS. 4. Place them in an incubator at 37 \u00b0C at 5% CO 2 , until needed. 7. Monitor clone growing and change media after the 3 rd and the 4 th week of growing again by taking 90 \u00b5l of media and adding 100 \u00b5l of complete RPMI 1640 media supplemented with 1 \u00b5g/ml of CpG (ODN2006) and 50 U/ml of IL2. Use the collected supernatant to monitor IgG production by ELISA as in step 6. Note: After one month clone growing should be evident by observing aggregates of round cells that usually lie in the middle of the round bottom well. 8. At this step, change media in the same way that the previous weeks but only with complete RPMI 1640 media. A good indicator to know the right moment to change media is the media color, if it is becoming yellowish cells need a media exchange. Note: All the clones' supernatants with 3 standard deviations over the blank will be considered positive for IgG human antibodies. For confirmation of the positive clones this ELISA should be repeated at least three times in different supernatants of the same clone. Also to discard the possibility of unspecific cross reactivity is recommended to assure that there is no signal when supernatants are incubated in uncoated but blocked wells. At this step, a detection assay to screen for the antigenic specificity of the antibodies of interest can be performed prior to proceed to section 7.",

For extracting RNA from larger amounts of cells, or from the pellet stored in step 5.11 use the high pure RNA isolation kit. Other systems of RNA extraction can also be suitable at this step. Follow the instructions of the manufacturer. 4. For cell numbers between 1 x 10 6 and 1 x 10 4 use the reverse transcription system, following the instruction of the manufacturer. Other systems for first strand cDNA synthesis can also be used. 6. Use 1 \u00b5l of the first PCR mix to perform the 2 nd PCR. Use the same reagents that in step 8.2 but using the suitable mix of primers (see Table   1 ). For the 2 nd PCR use the following conditions: 94 \u00b0C for 5 min; (50 cycles of: 94 \u00b0C for 30 sec; 56.5 \u00b0C for 30 sec and 72 \u00b0C for 55 sec); 72\u00b0C for 7 min; let it cool down at 4 \u00b0C. Include a blank in the reaction, to detect possible PCR contaminations. 7. Prepare an agarose gel as described in 8.5. Run the gel to visualize the PCR product as in 8.5.1 Use the amplifications which contain the right size fragments for cloning in step 9 and produce the antibodies in step 10. 8. Sequence the DNA, by using 10 \u00b5l reaction containing: 100 ng of the 2 nd PCR, 0.2 \u00b5M of the primer or primer mix, 1 \u00b5l of the terminator and 1 \u00b5l of the buffer. Perform the sequencing reaction under these conditions: (25 cycles of: 96 \u00b0C for 10 sec; 50 \u00b0C for 5 sec; and to 60 \u00b0C for 4 min); 60 \u00b0C for 7 min; let it cool down at 4 \u00b0C. 9. Purify the sequencing reactions with microspin G50 columns following manufacturer's instructions. Evaluate the sequences of the ligation in an automatic sequence analyzer as described before 18 . Electropherograms should be clean and correspond to a single immunoglobulin sequence. Note: If the PCR products show unclear or mixed immunoglobulin sequences, please consider to clone them using the TopoTA system, to obtain isolated sequences and then proceed to step 9. ",

In this ELISA a standard curve for IgG is tested, together with the supernatant of the clones and the blanks. The complete sequence of a human IgG antibody obtained applying the steps described in this manuscript is shown in Figure 3 . This sequence has been obtained after cloning the immunoglobulin heavy and lambda chain pair from a clonally expanded B cell. Variable and constant regions of the heavy and light chain can be characterized with this technique. After obtaining the sequences, antibodies sequences can be cloned and produced in vitro in HEK cell cultures. ",

This protocol includes some advantages over previously published techniques. One of the advantages is that the antibody produced keeps the heavy and light chains corresponding to the original pair in the B cell clone. The identification of IgG antibodies can be done in any type of human donor, and there is no need for exacerbation of the immune response due to vaccination 5 . The use of the fibroblast cell line wi38 as a feeder cell, allows a more rapid detection of the growing clones, since they are morphologically different and very easy to differentiate, compared to the PBMCs used as feeder cell in previously described works 1, [6] [7] [8] . Moreover the use of wi38 as a feeder cell favors the freezing of big amounts of cell aliquots that can be easily thawed and cultured before every experiment.",

If the blood has been waiting too long for centrifugation, or after the extraction of the PBMCs, they are not stored in the appropriate freezing conditions; as such the number of viable cells will be reduced, along with the number of the B cell IgG producing clones obtained. For that reason, an early extraction and a good preservation of the PBMCs are recommended for a successful outcome. The number of IgG producing clones will be limited to the number of PBMCs at the beginning of the experiment. Higher numbers of PBMCs will give higher numbers of IgG producing clones and a diverse antibody production. Another critical step is the cloning of the PCR fragments of the light and heavy chains of the antibody. If the ligation is not successful after several attempts, an extra step of cloning the 2 nd PCR product in a TopoTA system is recommended. The digestion of the insert with the appropriate enzymes can be easier in the TopoTA vector, for a subsequent ligation in the pFUSEss expression vectors.",

The ratio used should be 1 : 2 (vector : insert). 5. Use 1 \u00b5l of the ligation to transform DH5\u03b1 bacteria. Follow DH5\u03b1 manufacturer' conditions for transformation. Spread bacteria in blasticidin or zeocin plates, depending on the type of vector used. Incubate the plates O/N at 37 \u00b0C.",
