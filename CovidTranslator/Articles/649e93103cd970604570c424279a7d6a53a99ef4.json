Seven hospitals from the southeastern Ontario region fed electronic CC data into the system. Routine patient data collected without identifi ers include date and time of visit, demographic information, 5-digit postal code of residence, Canadian Triage Acuity Score, and CC or reason for visit. The National Ambulatory Care Reporting System (NACRS) gathers data for hospital-and community-based ambulatory care, day surgery, outpatient clinics, and EDs. Records contain patient diagnosis according to International Classifi cation of Diseases, 10th Revision-Canadian Enhancement (ICD-10-CA) codes. Every hospital in Ontario submits data to NACRS, and the system includes demographic, clinical, and administrative data for the entire province (9) . Telehealth Ontario is the teletriage helpline available free to all Ontario residents 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Callers are connected to skilled nurses who assess symptoms over the phone and assist callers in making the most appropriate healthcare decision (10) . Each caller's demographics are recorded, and each call is assigned a guideline after the nurse has gone through a list of questions about why the person has called.",

These potential benefi ts cannot be tested because no large-scale outbreaks have occurred since the inception of our real-time syndromic surveillance system. Protocols of many pandemic-preparedness plans include monitoring of real-time systems. When a pandemic occurs, syndromic surveillance may be able to help healthcare workers recognize a potential outbreak, which theoretically could help them mitigate effects on society earlier. Our study demonstrates that in southeastern Ontario, ED CCs accurately refl ect respiratory conditions of patients in the area. The correlations found strongly suggest that EDSS accurately monitors respiratory disease in the community and contributes to early detection of respiratory disease outbreaks. We continue to monitor the system from day to day and have increased the number of reporting hospitals to 9. Future studies will use laboratory data to assess the value of advanced warning on a number of syndromes captured in our system.",

Analysis comparing the EDSS respiratory CCs with the Telehealth Ontario calls about respiratory disease (Figure)resulted in a Spearman correlation coeffi cient of 0.91, indicating good correlation. Analysis comparing the EDSS respiratory CC to all NACRS respiratory disease diagnoses resulted in a Spearman correlation coeffi cient of 0.98, indicating very good correlation.
