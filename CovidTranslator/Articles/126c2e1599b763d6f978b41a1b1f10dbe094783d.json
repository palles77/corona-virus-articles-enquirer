This stimulation, which also occurs with DNA or RNA-containing immune complexes and synthetic TLR7 and \u22129 agonists, is dependent upon the transcription factor IRF-7, which is expressed at high constitutive levels in pDC. In addition to releasing as much as 3\u221210 pg of IFN-\u03b1/cell, pDC are also potent modulators of the immune response. In this review, we discuss the signaling pathways in pDC, their roles in linking innate and adaptive immunity, and their roles in infectious disease and autoimmunity.",

In the course of their studies they determined that, rather than being mediated by a component of the first virus, as they had hypothesized, the interference instead was mediated by a soluble factor that could be transferred to an uninfected culture and confer virus-resistance on that culture. This discovery of the substance they termed \"the interferon\" provided the impetus for the development of the whole field of interferon biology that continues to be vigorous to this day. Interferon, like most of the early cytokines that followed it, was named for its first observed biological function: prevention of viral infection. It was not for a couple of decades, however, that the role of interferon beyond \"interference\" began to be appreciated. Thus, although the designation \"interferon\" has stuck (unlike the early designations for some of cytokines, such as \"T cell growth factor (TCGF)\", which were replaced by less-descriptive interleukin designations), the interferons are now well-appreciated for their roles not just as anti-viral agents, but also as immune modulators and cell growth regulators.",

Although the primary type I IFN producing cell in the peripheral blood was initially assumed to be a monocyte [4] , it was subsequently determined by several research groups, including ours, that the cell in blood that produced the majority of the IFN in response to enveloped viruses was a low frequency, MHC Class II positive cell distinct from T cells, B cells, monocytes and NK cells [5] [6] [7] [8] . Although many cell types in the body are capable of producing type I IFN, these lineage-negative cells were found to be particularly potent, with a single cell able to produce 1\u22122 IU of IFN in response to viral stimulus, an amount that is 10 \u2212100 times more than most other cells. These cells were termed \"natural IFN producing cells or \"NIPC\" by Gunnar Alm's group in Uppsala, Sweden, with the \"natural\" referring to their belonging to the early, innate immune response, then known as \"natural immunity\" [6] . Through the persistent efforts of a small number of groups in both Europe and the United States, including our own, who studied the NIPC, much was learned about the function of these potent IFN-producing cells. Morphologically, the NIPC are large cells with an abundant cytoplasm and an apparent well-developed rough endoplasmic reticulum. Evidence from our group and the Rinaldo group pointed towards the cells being related to the family of dendritic cells [9] [10] [11] ; however, it was clear that they were distinct from classical DC, which did not produce IFN-\u03b1 [12] .",

These cells were subsequently found to be prevalent in the lymphoid tissues in pathological conditions including Hodgkin's lymphoma, Castleman's disease and Hodgkin's disease (reviewed in [14] ). Major progress into the nature and function of these cells, however, had to await the development of the modern field of cellular immunology and the sub-speciality field of dendritic cell biology. Several decades after their initial description by Lennert and Remmele, these cells were erroneously identified as either \"plasmacytoid T cells\" [15, 16] or \"plasmacytoid monocytes\" [17] based on their cell surface markers and lymphoid tissue localization. The identity of the cells as dendritic cells came from Y-J Liu and colleagues who isolated them from the T cell-rich areas near the high endothelial venules in tonsils [16] ; they termed these cells \"DC2\" based on their maturation into Th2-inducing DC upon culture with IL-3 and CD40 ligand. The DC2, as shown by electron microscopy had abundant cytoplasm with extensive endoplasmic reticulum (hence their apparent similarity to plasma cells, from which the name \"plasmacytoid\" derives), indicating that they were poised to produce a large amount of protein; however, what that protein was remained to be determined.",

These cells, also known as myeloid dendritic cells (or mDC) are known to differentiate from the common myeloid hematopoietic precursor. The most commonly used model system for studying cDC in humans is that of the monocytederived dendritic cells (MDDC), which are obtained by culturing peripheral blood monocytes in the presence of GM-CSF and IL-4 for approximately seven days. At the end of this culture period, the MDDC are non-adherent cells that lack the monocyte cell surface marker, CD14, and exhibit a dendritic morphology and are highly efficient at capturing antigen . In mice, cDC are typically derived by culturing bone marrow cells in the presence of Flt3L, which also induces the differentiation of pDC [20] . These so called \"bone marrow-derived DC\" can be further separated into pDC and cDC subsets by cell sorting. Likewise, administration of Flt3L in vivo to either humans or mice results in the mobilization of both subsets of DC into the periphery. However, although it is possible to demonstrate in vivo transformation of peripheral monocytes to DC upon stimulation, there is recent evidence that these cells can also come directly from the bone marrow.",

            "text": "While both the pDC and cDC can clearly be derived from a common hematopoietic precursor, the precise relationship between the pDC and cDC remains controversial. One of the earliest investigations of the cells now known as pDC placed these cells in the myeloid lineage due to their expression of the receptor for GM-CSF [21] whereas others have proposed a lymphoid lineage based on their expression of gene products associated with the lymphoid lineage including the pre-T cell receptor-\u03b1 (pT\u03b1), a partially rearranged immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH), V-pre B, Spi-B, and notch-1 [22] . A further relationship of pDC to the lymphoid lineage was suggested by the finding that the ectopic expression of Id3 and Id2 in CD34+ progenitor cells inhibited not only the development of T cells and B cells, but also pDC [23] . However, the current view is that there is considerable plasticity in the DC lineages; for example, Shigematsu et al. recently demonstrated that pDC could be derived from either myeloid or lymphoid precursors and that the lymphoid associated transcripts for IgH, RAG and pT\u03b1 could be found in both lymphoid and myeloid-derived pDC [24] . Indeed, not only are the pDC and cDC lineages seemingly plastic, the myeloid and lymphoid lineages are themselves now recognized to be plastic, with common lymphoid/myeloid progenitors reported to give rise to both T cells and myeloid cells or both B cells and myeloid cells [25] .",

            "text": "Most recently, studies have indicated that DC subtypes maintain functional plasticity even after their differentiation. For example, Reis e Sousa and colleagues demonstrated that cDC, not normally considered to be high producers of IFN-\u03b1, when infected with a DC-tropic strain of LCMV can make high levels of IFN-\u03b1, and that non-pDC could produce high levels of IFN\u03b1 when double-stranded RNA was directly delivered to the cytoplasm, thus mimicking virus infection [26] . While these observations may just represent plasticity in the ability of defined subsets to produce IFN-\u03b1, Oldstone and colleagues have reported actual conversion of murine bone marrow-derived pDC precursors into myeloid DC upon infection with LCMV [27] . This conversion was independent of cell division of the pDC precursors and involved induction of IFN; moreover, this conversion could only occur upon infection of bone marrow pDC precursors, not of peripheral pDC, suggesting that plasticity was a function of less mature pDC. It has been suggested that this reversible programming of pDC into cDC may serve to efficiently sustain the adaptive immune response [28] .",

            "text": "Recent studies carried out in mice have begun to illuminate the transcriptional requirements for development of subsets of DC. For example, Ozato and colleagues studied mice singly or doubly knocked-out for the transcription factors IRF-4 and IRF-8 [29] . Mice that lacked both of these transcription factors were devoid of both pDC and cDC. Reintroduction of the IRF-4 and IRF-8 restored normal development of both DC subsets. For pDC development, IRF-8, and to a lesser extent, IRF-4 were found by these investigators to be essential for pDC development. Another transcription factor that has been strongly associated with the development of pDC is the zinc finger protein Ikaros that serves as a repressor and is required for the development of several lineages. Mice with low levels of Ikaros expression were found to lack peripheral blood pDC but not other DC subsets [30] . These mice were unable to produce IFN-\u03b1 in response to TLR7 and \u22129 agonists or to murine cytomegalovirus, whose DNA is a natural ligand for TLR9. The bone marrow of these mice was found to contain precursors of pDC that were blocked in their terminal differentiation to pDC. These precursors of pDC were found to express genes that are normally not expressed in pDC, suggesting that the function of Ikaros is to silence an array of genes to allow the terminal differentiation of the pDC.",

            "text": "pDC are best known for their extraordinary ability to secrete high levels of IFN-\u03b1 in response to many DNA and RNA viruses as well as synthetic TLR9 and TLR7 agonists. In fact, it has been reported that the type I and type III (discussed below) IFNs account for 60% of the genes expressed in activated pDC [31] . In addition to producing large quantities of IFN-\u03b1 (as much as 3\u221210 pg/cell in response to a strong stimulus such as HSV-1), pDC also produce IFN-\u03b2 (but at much lower levels relative to IFN-\u03b1) as well as additional type I IFNs that signal through the same IFN\u03b1/\u03b2 receptor including IFN-\u03ba and IFN-\u03c9 in response to stimulation with HSV (Table II) [31, 32] . At the message level, we [32] and others [31] found that the range of IFN\u03b1 subtypes produced by pDC in response to HSV or Sendai virus is very broad and appears broader than the response of monocytes or MDDC to Sendai virus [32] . Protein levels of the individual IFN-\u03b1's expressed by the pDC have not been determined because of the current paucity of antibodies that can reliably distinguish between these very similar proteins. The subtype composition of the IFN-\u03b1 subtypes produced by the pDC may be very important in that although the IFN\u2212\u03b1's all signal through the same receptor, there have been marked differences reported in their biological functions. For example, IFN-\u03b11, which we found to be abundantly expressed by pDC, has relatively weak antiviral activity and may be more important in immunomodulation [33] . In addition to their expression of IFN-\u03b1 protein, pDC also express the type I IFN receptor and respond to IFN-\u03b1 with upregulation (or \"priming\") of IFN-\u03b1 production (reviewed in [14] ); this occurs at least in part through the upregulation of IRF-7 [34] , the key transcription factor for type I IFN gene expression [35] (to be discussed below). Moreover, autocrine production of IFN-\u03b1 by pDC is known to be a survival factor, and to some extent, a maturation factor, for these cells in vitro [36] [37] [38] and is required for activation and migration of pDC in vivo [39] .",

The type III IFNs, which exhibit some limited structural homology with the type I IFNs, are encoded on a different chromosome than the type I IFNs and signal through a distinct receptor that shares one of the chains of the IL-10 receptor (IL-10R2) [40] . Unlike the type I IFN genes, the IFN-\u03bb genes have introns. Despite these differences, the expression of the type I and type III IFNs appears to be coordinately regulated [42] . To date, the major difference between the signaling of type I and III IFNs is not in the responses that are observed, but, rather, in the more limited expression of the IFN-\u03bb receptor: while IFNAR is expressed on many cell types, the expression of the IFN-\u03bb receptor is more limited. Interestingly, pDC but not resting peripheral blood monocytes express the IFN-\u03bb receptor, and pDC respond to stimulation with IL-29 followed by HSV stimulation with enhanced expression of both type I and type III IFN (manuscript in preparation).",

What makes these cells such exquisite producers of IFN-\u03b1 is of great interest. Although signaling pathways for the induction of IFN-\u03b1 have been well-studied, most of these pathways were worked out in model cell systems, not in pDC. Studying signaling pathways in pDC is inherently more difficult for several reasons; first, to date, there are no pDC lines that mirror the responses of freshly-isolated pDC, although there have been reports of leukemic cells that are apparently of pDC origin [53] ; second, pDC are present in very low frequency in human peripheral blood and lymphoid tissue, accounting for approximately 0.2\u22120.5% of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells [54] . Isolation of pDC by positive or negative techniques by either magnetic or fluorescent cell sorting can yield high purity cells, but in limiting numbers; however, we have demonstrated that positive selection of pDC using anti-BDCA-4 magnetic beads compromises their function [55] . In mice, most investigators utilize pDC that are derived from bone marrow cultured with Flt3L, which allows for studying pDC from mice that either do not express or over-express specific genes. The caveat for these latter studies, however, is that murine pDC do not exactly mirror human pDC in phenotype or function. However, despite these difficulties, much has recently been learned about the mechanisms of induction of IFN\u03b1 in pDC using both murine and human systems.",

Early studies demonstrated the importance of viral glycoproteins in induction of IFN-\u03b1 production in that blocking of HSV virion-associated glycoproteins, and in particular gD, inhibited interferon production. Likewise, antibody to gp120 blocks HIV-1 induction of IFN-\u03b1 in pDC (reviewed in [14] ). A specific role for glycosylation of viral membrane proteins in IFN induction was demonstrated by Charley and colleagues who showed that mutation of the single glycosylation site on the M protein of transmissible gastroenteritis virus abolished the ability of the virus to induce IFN in porcine NIPC [59, 60] . While a few studies have suggested that gD from HSV-1, which is an envelope glycoprotein required for viral entry into cells, or gp120 from HIV-1 can induce IFN\u03b1, in the absence of viral nucleic acids [61, 62] , these responses are relatively weak and have not been observed with all glycoprotein preparations. In contrast to an IFN-stimulating role for gp120, Martinelli et al. recently demonstrated that HIV-1 gp120 inhibits TLR9-mediated (but not TLR7-mediated) induction of IFN-\u03b1 as well their activatoin pDC [63] .",

While the natural ligands for BDCA-2 have not been determined, antibody directed to this receptor was subsequently delivered to endosomes and was processed and presented by the pDC [68] . Our laboratory reported that pDC express low levels of another Ctype lectin receptor, the mannose receptor, and that antibody blockade prevented IFN-\u03b1 production in pDC but not monocytes against several enveloped viruses [9] . However, these blocking experiments were carried out using intact antibodies, and we subsequently demonstrated that production of IFN-\u03b1 by pDC is sensitive to cross-linking with antibodies to a variety of different cell-surface receptors, not just BDCA-2, thus raising caution about the interpretation of blocking studies in pDC using cross-linking antibodies [55] . Indeed, the sensitivity to crosslinking of cell surface antigens raises concerns about the use of pDC positively selected using BDCA-4 for functional studies.",

Coyle and colleagues have implicated HMGB1, a nuclear DNA-binding protein that is released by necrotic cells, as an essential component of DNA-containing immune complexes that signal through TLR9 [71] . The DNA/HMGB1 complex was found to associate with the cellular receptor RAGE and resulted in IFN-\u03b1 production by pDC. Moreover, HMGB1 bound to CpG-A (but not CpG-B) and also resulted in augmented IFN-\u03b1 production through TLR9 and RAGE. In addition to being secreted by necrotic cells, HMGB1 is released by CpG-stimulated human pDC, and regulates the production of IFN-\u03b1 and maturation of pDC in an autocrine [72] . However, HMGB-1 has also been demonstrated to have immunosuppressive effects on cytokine production by pDC [73] .

For example, UVinactivated HSV-1, UV-or heat-inactivated influenza and AT-2-inactivated HIV-1 are all good inducers of IFN-\u03b1 in pDC [18, 75] . In fact, we have demonstrated that HSV-1 expressing GFP under the control of an early immediate promotor, at multiplicities of infection (MOI) that are optimal for induction of IFN-\u03b1, do not express the GFP, indicating that pDC are not infected by this virus (unpublished result). Inhibitors of endocytosis and micropinocytosis such as monodansylcadaverine and di-methyl ameloride inhibit IFN-\u03b1 production by pDC in response to HSV, implicating a direct delivery of the virus to the endosome where it is uncoated and the viral nucleic acid gains access to the TLR7 or \u22129. However, in contrast, UV-inactivation of some ssRNA viruses such as vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) and respiratory syncytial [50, 76] abolishes the ability of these viruses to induce IFN. Iwasaki and colleagues have recently offered an explanation for the apparent requirement for viral replication for the induction of IFN-\u03b1 by these ssRNA viruses. They reported that cytosolic viral replication intermediates could be transferred to the endosome by the process of autophagy, and that it is these cytosolic replication intermediates that serve as pathogen signatures recognized by TLR7 [77] . Moreover, the pDC were shown to spontaneously form autophagosomes, even in the absence of infections, leading to the intriguing possibility that this represents a constitutive cytoplasm sampling pathway in pDC.",

            "text": "5.3.1. TLR7/9-dependent signaling in pDC-The classical signaling pathways for induction of IFN-\u03b1 have been well-studied in model cell systems. In the classical pathway, virus stimulation results in the phosphorylation of constitutively expressed IRF-3, its translocation to the nucleus and transcription of a subset of IFN-\u03b1 genes. These then stimulate the infected cells in an autocrine or paracrine manner to upregulate the expression of IRF-7, which in turn is phosphorylated and translocated to the nucleus, leading to the full expression of the IFN-\u03b1 genes [78] . However, unlike fibroblasts and most other peripheral blood mononuclear cells, we and others found that pDC express high constitutive levels of IRF-7 that can rapidly translocate to the nucleus following virus stimulation [32, 34, 35] . Using IFNAR \u2212/\u2212 mice, Asselin-Paturel et al. demonstrated that this IRF-7 pathway proceeds even in the absence of IFN feedback signaling in virus-infected mice but not in response to CpG [39] . In contrast, however, Taniguchi and colleagues reported that pDC from IFNAR \u2212/\u2212 mice failed to give robust IFN-\u03b1 production in murine splenic pDC [35] . In the same study, these investigators reported that IRF-7 is required as the \"master regulator\" of both the classical and TLR7/9/MyD88 IFN-induction pathways. Moreover, while mice lacking IRF-3 expression were unable to produce IFN-\u03b1 through the classical pathway, the ability of pDC to produce IFN in a TLR9/MyD88-dependent manner was intact. In contrast, IRF-7 \u2212/\u2212 mice failed to produce IFN-\u03b1 through either pathway. Interestingly, the ability of pDC to produce inflammatory cytokines was intact in the IRF-7 \u2212/\u2212 mice, indicating the IFN specificity of the IRF-7 pathway.",

            "text": "As noted above, the endosomal pathway of recognition of viral nucleic acids is through TLR7 (for ssRNA viruses [75, 79] ) and TLR9 (for DNA viruses [36, 80] ). These TLR are expressed at high constitutive levels in both murine and human pDC [81] ; however, it should be noted that other cell types express TLR9, including B cells, and other murine antigen presenting cells as well as some non-hematopoietic cells also express TLR9. Thus, expression of TLR9 is not sufficient to explain the high IFN-generating capacity of pDC. Honda et al. have suggested that it is the ability of pDC to retain CpG (and presumably virus) in the endosome that distinguishes pDC from other cells [66] . In addition to viruses, synthetic ligands can also activate IFN-\u03b1 production by pDC through these TLRs; ssRNA and imidazaquinolones activate pDC through TLR7 [75, 82] , while CpG-A sequences activate through TLR9 [41] . Recently, Golenbock and colleagues have demonstrated for the first time direct binding of CpG sequences to pre-formed TLR9 homodimers; binding of CpG but not inhibitory CpG to the inactive TLR9 homodimers led to conformational changes that allowed for close apposition of the cytoplasmic TIR dimers, which presumably sterically allows for the recruitment of signaling adaptor molecules [83] . Whether the same occurs for TLR7 activation remains to be determined. A requirement for higher order structures of CpG-A and for ssRNA binding to TLR9 and TLR7, respectively, have also been demonstrated [79, 84] ). Interestingly, this requirement for higher order structures seems to be limited to signaling for IFN production since CpG-B, which can stimulate maturation of pDC but is a poor stimulator of IFN-\u03b1, does not generate the higherorder structures. Wang et al. also demonstrated a higher signaling threshold for induction of IFN-\u03b1 than NF\u03baB-dependent IL-8 induction in response to viral RNA inTLR7-transfected HEK cells [79] ; whether this is also true in pDC remains to be determined.",

The pathways for IFN-\u03b1 and inflammatory cytokines bifurcate downstream from MyD88. For induction of IFN-\u03b1, there is formation of a molecular complex, called by Honda et al. a \"cytoplasmic trnsductional-transcriptional processor\" (CTTP) [85] , which is now known to include the adaptor MyD88, the ubiquitin ligase TNF receptorassociated factor 6 (TRAF6), interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase (IRAK)-4 and IRAK-1 (Figure 1 ). IRAK-4 phosphorylates IRAK-1, which in turn is the kinase that phosphorylates IRF-7. pDC from IRAK-1 deficient mice were found to be severely deficient in the activation of IRF-7 and the production of IFN-\u03b1, emphasizing the role of this kinase rather than TBK-1 or IKK\u03b5 in phosphorylating IRF-7 through the TLR7/9/MyD88 pathway [86] . For cytokine production through the TLR7/8 pathway, however, neither IRF-7 nor IRAK-1 are required. A role for I\u03baB kinase-\u03b1 (IKK-\u03b1), a serine/threonine kinase, in TLR7/9 induced IFN-\u03b1 production was recently described [20] . Interestingly, IFN-\u03b2 gene expression was not dependent on IKK\u03b1; however, how IKK-\u03b1 cooperates with IRAK-1 or how it is selectively required for IFN-\u03b1 induction is not currently known.",

We previously demonstrated that pDC express high levels of IRF-5 and that the range of alternatively-spliced isoforms that they express is distinct from those in other peripheral blood mononuclear cells [32, 87] . In TLR7/9 signaling, the CTTP can have either IRF-7 or IRF-5 associated with it. Initial in vitro studies with cell lines suggested a role for IRF-5 in regulation of IFN-\u03b1 production [88] ; however, using IRF-5 \u2212/\u2212 mice, Taniguchi and colleagues reported normal IFN-\u03b1 production but decreased inflammatory cytokine production in response to CpG-A, whereas IRF-7 was absolutely required for IFN-\u03b1 generation in pDC in response to CpG-A [89] . However, more recently, these authors have reported that IRF-5 \u2212/\u2212 mice are highly susceptible to virus infection and that there is a profound, cell-type dependent deficiency in IFN-\u03b1 production in these mice, with mouse embryo fibroblasts from IRF5 \u2212/\u2212 mice producing normal levels of IFN-\u03b1, but greatly decreased IFN-\u03b1 in the serum of HSV or VSV-infected mice [90] . Yasuda et al. studied IFN induction in mouse cells by human IgG-RNA immune complexes from patients with systemic lupus erythematosus as well as conventional TLR7 and 9 agonists. Surprisingly, they found that the RNA immune complexes as well as CpG-A induction of IFN-\u03b1 was dependent on TLR7, IRF-7 and IRF-5 [91] . Moreover, they further reported that IFNAR \u2212/\u2212 mice had decreased levels of IL-6 production, suggesting a requirement for IFN-\u03b1 feedback even in the presence of IRF-5. Part of the explanation for the differential results between the earlier Taniguchi study and the study by Yasuda et al. is the dose of CpG-A used: in the former, 1\u03bcM CpG was used whereas in the latter study, 50 nM was used; in the latter study, when the concentrations of CpG were increased, the differences between the WT and IRF5 \u2212/\u2212 mice were less pronounced. Thus, under physiological conditions, such as in stimulation of pDC by immune complexes in patients with SLE or with in vivo viral infection, the amount of available TLR7 or \u22129 ligand may determine the requirement for IRF-5 and IFN-feedback signaling in addition to IRF-7 for induction of IFN-\u03b1.",

Osteopontin is a phosphoprotein that is expressed in DC as well as macrophages and activated T cells after viral infection. Secreted osteopontin (Opn) functions as a cytokine or chemokine, but a portion of the Opn is retained within cells. In a recent study, Shinohara et al. have demonstrated the T-bet dependent upregulation of Opn and its secretion by CpG-stimulated pDC [92] . Opn \u2212/\u2212 mice were found to be deficient in TLR9-dependent IFN-\u03b1 production but not NF\u03baB-dependent proinflammatory cytokines. Interestingly, this deficiency was not due to a lack of secreted Opn, but, rather to internal Opn (Opn-i). The Opn-i was found to co-localize with MyD88 and lack of Opn-i resulted in deficient IRF-7 translocation in pDC. Further evidence for the importance of Opn in pDC-induced IFN-\u03b1 production was the finding that Opn\u2212/\u2212 mice had a deficient IFN-\u03b1 response to in vivo HSV infection, deficient IFN-activated NK activity and deficient IFN-dependent cross-presentation of antigen by pDC.",

            "text": "While the majority of studies of production of IFN-\u03b1 by pDC have implicated the TLR7/9 pathways described above, it is clear that pDC are also able to respond to viruses that enter the cytoplasm. These responses typically require the infection of the pDC (and not just inactivated virus) and the subsequent recognition of the viral nucleic acid replication intermediates by cytoplasmic sensors. Hochrein et al. described TLR9-independent induction of IFN-\u03b1 in response to HSV [36] ; the TLR9independent IFN-\u03b1-inducing viral component was found to be heat-sensitive, suggesting a role for an RNA intermediate, or possibly, a viral protein in this IFN induction. Moreover, the TLR9-independent IFN-\u03b1 production was exhibited by bone marrow pDC but not splenic pDC, suggesting that such recognition may depend on the stage of pDC maturation. dsRNA is a wellknown replicative intermediate of many viruses. dsRNA is able to activate IFN-\u03b1 production through PKR, but the retinoic acid-inducible gene-I (RIG-I) and the melanoma differentiationassociated gene-5 (MDA-5) cellular helicases have been implicated as the prevalent cytoplasmic receptors for dsRNA leading to IFN-\u03b1 production [93, 94] . In addition to the sensing of dsRNA by RIG-I and MDA-5, the existence of an intracellular sensor for DNA has been suggested [95] . While it is known that the RIG-I/MDA-5 pathways are operative in myeloid DC, a role for cytoplasmic sensors of dsRNA or DNA in IFN-\u03b1 production by pDC has not been demonstrated; however, such cytoplasmic sensing could explain the requirement for virus replication in the IFN induction by some viruses. Alternatively, as described above, the studies of Isakawa and colleagues have implicated autophagy as a means to deliver cytoplasmic RNA to TLR7-expressing endosomal compartments, thus bypassing a need for cytoplasmic sensors [77] . The redundant mechanisms for IFN-\u03b1 induction in pDC are complemented by the redundancy in cell types that can produce IFN-\u03b1. As described above, IRF-7 \u2212/\u2212 mice are highly susceptible to infection with HSV; however, mice lacking TLR9 or MyD88 were found to be relatively resistant to HSV infection, indicating both the importance of IRF-7 signaling and IFN-\u03b1 and the functional redundancy of IFN-producing cells [35, 96] .",

            "text": "Dendritic cells, including pDC, are uniquely poised at the interface of innate and adaptive immunity. While many cell types in the body are able to produce type I IFNs, the majority of these cells require viral gene expression before they are recognized by intracellular sensors. The ability of pDC to produce IFN-\u03b1 in response to inactivated viruses or viral nucleic acids in the absence of replication has a clear advantage: many viruses have the ability to block IFN\u03b1 production in the cells they infect. For example, Kaposi's sarcoma herpes virus (HHV-8), encodes an immediate early gene whose product interferes with the function of IRF-7, while NS1 proteins of influenza virus sequester dsRNA, paramyxovirus inhibits the helicase of MDA5 and the P protein of rabies and Ebola viruses inhibit IRF-3. Other viruses encode IRF mimics that inhibit normal IRF-regulated gene expression (reviewed in Haller et al. [97] ). By being able to produce IFN-\u03b1 in the absence of virus gene expression (i.e. without the requirement for infection), pDC are thus able to bypass these evasion strategies and produce a vigorous immune response. Moreover, the ability of pDC to migrate from the blood to the lymph nodes where they can interact with T cells as well as their their ability to migrate to sites of inflammation [17, 98] also positions these cells ideally at the interface between innate and adaptive immunity. A summary of some of these interactions is shown in Figure 2 . pDC, in their role as NIPC and also through their production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, influence a variety of other cell types as well as themselves. One obvious function of pDC production of IFN-\u03b1 is to set up a localized antiviral state in neighboring cells. However, while viral interference is clearly important, and was, in fact, the first described function of IFN, the most important role of IFN-\u03b1 production by pDC is to provide an interface between these innate immune effectors and other cells of the innate and adaptive responses.",

IFN-DC, which are MDDC generated from monocytes cultured with IFN-\u03b1 plus GM-CSF rather than IL-4 plus GM-CSF, express higher levels of MHC Class I and express TLR7; these IFN-DC are able to respond to TLR7 agonists and induce CD8 + T cell activation [99] . pDC-derived IFN-\u03b1 production is also important in regulation of the pDCs themselves. IFN-\u03b1 production by many cell types is influenced by prior exposure to IFN-\u03b1, a phenomenon known as priming. We have demonstrated that pretreatment of pDC with IFN-\u03b1 efficiently primes for the production of both IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03bb (manuscript in preparation). Virus stimulation of pDC or the addition of exogenous IFN-\u03b1 upregulates the expression of IRF-7 in pDC [34] .

Upon maturation, pDC lose their capacity to produce IFN-\u03b1 and gain the capacity to present antigen. While most studies indicate that MDDC, the best studied of the myeloid-type DC, are better antigen-presenters than pDC due to their higher rate of endocytosis and higher expression of MHC Class II [16] , numerous studies have demonstrated the ability of pDC to function as APC for both CD4 and CD-8positive cells [16, 17, 105] . In response to viruses and TLR7/9 ligands, pDC produce large amounts of IFN-\u03b1 and induce Th1 differentiation [38] ; indeed, IFN-\u03b1 itself is a Th1-biasing cytokine [106] . As noted above, murine, but not human, pDC produce IL-12, which also induces Th1 differentiation. Evidence in support of the link between pDC-derived IFN and Th1 responses is the observation that virus-stimulated pDC stimulate na\u00efve T cells to produce IFN-\u03b3 and IL-10, whereas human pDC activated in the non-IFN-inducing conditions of IL-3 and CD40L stimulation were found to skew the T cells towards Th2 responses [16] .",

Immature pDC are present in the blood, bone marrow and secondary lymphoid organs and can be recruited under stimulatory conditions to diverse areas in the body including (but not limited to) the skin, the cerebrospinal fluid, the synovium, the gut, the vaginal mucosa and the lung (reviewed in [14] ). Moreover, pDC are known to infiltrate many tumors and are associated with lesions in the skin of patients with SLE. It has been suggested that since pDC are not at the major sentinel sites in the body, their main roles may be in modulating the strength, duration and quality of NK, T and B cell responses through their cytokines and presentation of antigen [107] . While it is not possible to review all of the studies regarding pDC in human defense and autoimmunity, or to discuss their roles in cancer, we will touch upon a few of the diverse findings that demonstrate the important in vivo roles of pDC, with apologies to the many investigators whose work we are unable to discuss.",

While studies in humans have provided important correlative information regarding pDC in disease, the identification of pDC in mice [45, 113, 114] and the development of antibodies to pDC-specific markers [115, 116] has allowed for carrying out experiments to dissect the role of pDC and their gene products in host defense. Murine pDC share many characteristics with human pDC, including morphology and function, but there are notable phenotypic as well as functional differences; notably, as described above, murine pDC produce significant amounts of IL-12, while human pDC do not [31, 45] . pDC studies in the murine model have typically involved either the use of knockout mice with deletions of genes specific to particular components of the pDC signaling pathways or by depletions of pDC in vivo. Many of in vivo mouse studies have uncovered the functional redundancy in the immune system; for example, as described above, deletion of IRF-7 had more profound effects on resistance to infection with HSV than deletion of MyD88 or TLR9; these studies demonstrate the importance of type I IFN (as evidenced by the IRF-7) requirement but demonstrate that the source of the IFN is not limited to pDC [35] . In a study by Ciavarra et al., in vivo depletion of pDC by mAb lead to decreased priming and clonal expansion of na\u00efve, virus-specific CD8+ T cells in mice infected with VSV [117] , even though the majority of the pDC-depleted mice were able to clear the virus infection. Lund et al. have recently demonstrated that pDC are recruited to the vaginal mucosa in HSV-2-infected mice and function there as innate antiviral effector cells, effectively reducing the viral load [118] . In a murine RSV model, pDC were recruited to the lung and were able to inhibit RSV replication and reduced pulmonary inflammation and airway hyperresponsiveness, thus emphasizing the role of pDC in this compartment [119] . TLR3 and TLR9-deficient mice have been shown to have decreased resistance to infection murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) associated with decreased type 1 IFN and IL-12 production; MyD88-deficient mice were found to be more susceptible to MCMV then TLR3 or TLR9deficient mice, suggesting either redundant or complementary defense (reviewed in [120] ).",

Deficient IFN production was observed in the patients and was strongly predictive, along with deficient CD4 cells, of progression to opportunistic infections and death. Although we determined that there was a decreased frequency of functional NIPC in the patient samples [54] , not until the definition of the phenotype of pDC was it possible to equate this functional deficiency with decreases in both the numbers and function of circulating pDC [124, 125] .",

Both cDC and pDC express relatively low levels of CD4, as well as HIV co-receptors CXCR4 and CCR5, thus making them targets for HIV infection. Early studies suggested that PDC are highly susceptible to HIV infection in vitro [126, 127] and thus could be killed by the virus. However, the purity of the isolated cell population obtained by negative selection was not verified, and the extent of virus infection and replication were not well quantified. Recently, studies have failed to detect efficient HIV replication in highly purified pDC unless the cells were matured by CD40L [128] . Although other studies found both cDC and pDC are susceptible to HIV-1 infection, it was noted that cDC are more susceptible than PDC from the same donor by p24 antigen determination [129] [130] [131] , and pDC were able to produce IFN-\u03b1 upon HIV-1 exposure, perhaps making them more resistant to HIV-1 infection than mDC. Using donor-matched cDC and pDC directly from blood, it has been demonstrated that these two cell types have opposing roles with respect to infection of T cells with HIV-1. cDC were found to enhance HIV-1 infection through capture of the virus and subsequent transmission to T cells, whereas, in contrast, irrespective of their maturation state, pDC were found to inhibit HIV-1 replication in T cells by secretion of IFN and an additional, as yet unidentified, heat-sensitive small molecule of less than 3 kDa [51] .",

However, while this might occur early in disease, it has recently been reported that there is a parallel loss of both myeloid and plasmacytoid DC from blood and lymphoid tissue in simian AIDS [132] . Likewise, in a small study, Biancotto et al. have recently that there was a dramatic depletion of pDC and cDC in HIV+ vs. normal human lymph nodes [133] . Thus, deficient pDC in peripheral blood cannot be accounted for simply by redistribution of these cells to the lymph nodes. Our own studies indicate that the functional deficiency of the pDC remaining in the circulation in HIV-infected patients results from increased apoptosis, increased maturation, and replacement of dying or migrating pDC with less mature pDC (Feng et al., manuscript submitted).",

This upregulation of TRAIL then leads to apoptosis of these uninfected, HIV-exposed CD4 + T cells. These authors conclude that the immunopathogenic aspects of IFN-\u03b1 would outweigh its beneficial effects in patients with significant HIV burden in their lymphoid tissues. Further studies will be required to reconcile this point-of-view with the recent findings of pDC depletion in lymph nodes in both SIV and HIV infection.",

SLE is associated with an \"interferon signature\" in the tissues -i.e. upregulation of IFN-responsive genes. Many patients with SLE have measurable circulating levels of IFN-\u03b1. As in HIV infection, SLE patients also have decreased numbers of circulating pDC but pDC redistribute to the skin where they produce IFN-\u03b1 and most likely are the source of the serum IFN-\u03b1 (recently reviewed by Baccalla et al. [135] ) As noted above, the IFN-\u03b1 production in SLE is driven by immune complexes of antibody and either DNA or RNA from damaged cells; these immune complexes can either be recognized by Fc\u03b3RII receptors on pDC, or through the cellular receptor RAGE, as described above. The pDC-derived IFN then acts on mDC to trigger T cell-mediated autoimmunity and the promotion of B cell differentiation into plasma cells that produce autoreactive antibodies. It should be noted that aberrant production of IFN-\u03b1 is also associated with other autoimmune conditions and therapeutic administration of IFN-\u03b1 sometimes leads to development of SLE, or, in experimental models, diabetes [135] . Interestingly, there is an association between certain IRF-5 polymorphisms in susceptibility to SLE [136] as well as some other IFN-associated autoimmune conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis [137] ; given the high expression of IRF-5 in pDC and the recent evidence for its role in IFN generation, it is likely that these polymorphisms are affecting pDC function. Therapeutic approaches that target this dysregulation of the pDC/IFN-\u03b1 system in SLE are currently under development.",

Likewise, the obscure cells described by Lennert and Remmele have moved from plasma-like cells to natural IFN-producing cells to pDC and are now recognized as central players in the immune system. However, despite all we have learned about induction of IFN-\u03b1 and its effects on the immune system, and as quickly as the biology of pDC is being revealed, there is much we still don't understand about pDC and their production of IFN-\u03b1 and other cytokines and how they contribute to the developing immune response and to immunopathology. From studies in patients and in mouse models of disease, it have become clear that type I IFNs have both beneficial roles in interfering with viruses and in bridging protective innate and adaptive immune responses, but also have the potential to have immunopathological effects. Key to therapeutic manipulation of these cells will be a better understanding of how the balance between protective and pathological effects of pDC and type I IFN can be maintained (Fig. 3) .

Dr pDC have been demonstrated to respond to viral RNA and DNA through a unique molecular complex known as the \"cytoplasmic transductional-transcriptional processor\" (CTTP) (86) . Virus enters the cell either by endocytosis or, potentially, direct fusion with the cell membrane. It is uncoated in the acidic endosome and the viral DNA or RNA interacts with TLR9 or TLR7, respectively. Intracellular signaling occurs through the CTTP, which can contain either IRF-5 or IRF-7. IRAK4 phosphorylates IRAK-1, which in turn is responsible for IRF-7 phosphorylation. IRF-7 is required for the transcription of IFNA genes, while IRF-5 is involved in transcription of inflammatory cytokines. Recent evidence, however, suggests that IRF-5 is also required for IFN-\u03b1 production. IRF-8 is also expressed in pDC, but its function in IFN induction is not known. Viruses that enter the cytoplasm and replicate may induce IFN-\u03b1 through TLR7/9-independent pathways (shown with question marks); alternatively, viral RNA or DNA may enter the endosome through autophagy (not shown in figure) , thus entering the TLR7/9 pathway. pDC respond to stimulation with viruses, CpG and DNA or RNA-containing immune complexes with the production of IFN-\u03b1, IFN-\u03bb and pro-inflammatory cytokines. pDC then, either directly in a cell-contact dependent manner or via their soluble products, activate components of the innate (NK, monocytes, myeloid (conventional) DC) responses. Activated pDC migrate to the lymph node, upregulate co-stimulatory molecules and present (or crosspresent) antigen to CD4, CD8 cells or Treg. Depending on the nature of the stimulus, pDC may activate Th1 responses (typically in response to viruses) or Th2 (in non-IFN-\u03b1 stimulating conditions). pDC have also been implicated in the development of B cell maturation to antibody-secreting plasma cells and in establishment of immunological memory. Induction of IFN production by pDC results in an altered immune response. A deviation to either extreme will result in a pathological condition. pDC deficiency leading to low levels of IFN-\u03b1 production will result in an inadequate immune response allowing for susceptibility to viral infections, whereas overly high levels of IFN-\u03b1 can induce hyper immune activation, which may lead to autoimmune conditions or, in the case of HIV-infection, CD4 death.",
