However, its effect on uptake rate, i.e., price elasticity of demand, has not been well studied. Methods: Japan's decentralised vaccination programme allows observation of various pairs in price and uptake rate of flu shots among the elderly by the municipality from 2001/2002 to 2004/2005 season. We combine our sample survey data (n = 281), which monitor price, subsidy and uptake rate, with published data on local characteristics in order to estimate price elasticity of demand with panel model. Results: We find price elasticity of demand for influenza vaccine: nearly zero in nationwide, nearly zero in urban area, and \u22121.07 in rural area.",

The elderly is more vulnerable to the disease among them, which sometimes results in hospitalisation or death [1] . One way of countering this public health issue is to implement vaccination programme targeting the elderly [2] , since influenza vaccine is considered as effective not only in preventing contraction of the disease [3] , but also reducing risk of death after contraction [4] . Although some recent studies cast doubts as to the latter effectiveness, i.e., reducing mortality [5] [6] [7] , a number of countries or regions organise such vaccination programmes [8] . In Japan, national gov-ernment has set up a nationwide influenza vaccination programme for people aged 65 and over since 2001/2002 season.",

However, the response of the elderly as a consumer in regard to price changes, i.e., price elasticity of demand, has not been well studied. Theoretically, knowledge of price elasticity is of great help to design an efficient subsidy programme including vaccination programmes [9] , but a few are reported in the literature. A correlation between subsidy levels and uptake rates is found in multinational comparison incorporating 18 developed countries [10] ; a rise in uptake rate that is resulted from Medicare coverage in the U.S. [11] ; the removal of fee increases uptake rate in an intervention study in Denmark [12] ; price elasticity of demand, \u22120.022, 0168-8510/$ -see front matter \u00a9 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

This arrangement makes the area of each municipality a market for flu shots, and it is possible to observe pairs of various prices and uptake rates.

National average of uptake rate, the demand, increased remarkably from 29.9% in 2001/2002 season to 49.6% in 2004/2005 season, which resulted in 41.1% over all seasons. Similar increases are also observed in urban area and rural area, while higher rates are observed in rural area than in urban area. It should be noted that the observed period is the beginning of the programme, during which there is supposed to bring about the broad diffusion of vaccination [28] . Additionally, outbreaks such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2002/2003 season and avian flu in 2002/2003 season occurred, and a word, \"influenza\", was heavily publicised during these seasons. The need of preparation for the emergence of pandemic influenza virus was also emphasised by the government in the follow-ing years. Such information may have affect on consumers' behaviour. National average of price in all seasons is \u00a51134 (US$9.86: US$1 = \u00a5115). The lowest price is \u00a50 (US$0), and the highest \u00a52500 (US$21.74). A shot is slightly more expensive in rural area than in urban area. National average of density of shot location, the non-cash price, is 2.0 per km 2 , and it ranges from 0.0023 per km 2 to 20 per km 2 . Urban average is smaller than rural as anticipated. National average of income, the activity level of local economy, is \u00a53,439,000 (US$29,900), and it ranges from \u00a52,407,000 (US$20,900) to \u00a54,970,000 (US$43,200). Urban average is larger than rural as anticipated. National average of subsidy is \u00a52962 (US$25.76), and it ranges from \u00a50 (US$0) to \u00a54599 (US$39.99), while national average of subsidy level 72.1%, from 0% to 100%. Urban municipal authorities tend to expend more subsidy than rural authorities. Table 2 shows the results of OLS estimation of Eq. Negative non-cash price elasticity is found in most of the models, which is also anticipated. Activity level of local economy is not significant as a determinant of the demand in all models. Table 3 shows the results of OLS estimation of Eq. becomes significant as a determinant of the demand in national model and urban model. Table 4 shows the results of panel estimation of Eqs. (3) and (4), random effect models and fixed effect models. Random effect models are selected over pool models by Breusch and Pagan Lagrangizan Multiplier tests, which reject null hypothesis that the variance of individual effect is zero. The demand depends significantly on price in rural model. Negative price elasticity is estimated as \u22120.00581 in national model, and \u22120.0537 in rural model, while positive price elasticity is estimated as 0.0248 in urban model, which is similar to pool models. Non-cash price elasticity becomes positive without significance in all models. With negative coefficient, activity level of local economy is significant as a determinant of the demand in national model and urban model, which is the same as pool models.",

The selection of fixed effect models among models estimated by diagnostic tests is not unexpected, when the rise in uptake rates through a process of diffusion and relative invariability of variables such as price, density of shot location, and average income per capita, are taken into account. The estimators in fixed effect models should be most statistically efficient among those models, and the figures of price elasticity can be considered as estimators after controlling not only observed factors but also unobserved ones. The almost totally price inelastic result at national level is probably due to the contribution by urban samples, of which number is much larger than rural. Price elasticity of nearly zero in urban area is surprising, which contrasts with the previously reported relatively elastic \u22120. 26 [14] . Even if we limit by the season for the sake of comparison, our results, \u22120.00323 to \u22120.0384 is obviously less elastic. Perhaps this difference is explained by the difference in 'urban area' surveyed. In our survey, only 14.5% of urban samples inhabit the 13 big cities surveyed by the previous study.",

A benefitcost analysis of current Japanese programme speculates potential benefit gain obtainable from increasing subsidy based on the estimation of price elastic demand in big cities [14] . But given the price inelastic results of this study, it is not recommendable to hastily raise the subsidy level at least in urban area. Since we demonstrate the cost-effectiveness of current programme with average subsidy level of 71%, of which results unchanged even when the effectiveness of reducing mortality is assumed negligible, elsewhere [31] , more effort on public relations or health education without the increase of subsidy level may be a preferred policy in urban area.

When organising a vaccination programme, managers should be careful about the balance between subsidy and other efforts, by taking the characteristics of the locality into account and with price elasticity of demand in mind.
