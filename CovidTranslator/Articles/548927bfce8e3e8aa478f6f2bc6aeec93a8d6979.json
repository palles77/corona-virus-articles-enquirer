            "text": "In myocardial infarction (MI) however, angiogenesis plays a much more benign role, allowing neovascularization following myocardial ischemia. For this reason, therapeutic myocardial angiogenesis is being explored as a therapeutic option in ischemic heart disease. 8 Neovascularization of atherosclerotic plaques contributes to the development of the plaques, increasing the risk of rupture. The clinical complications of atherosclerosis, for example, MI and stroke, are mainly caused by thrombus formation, which results from rupture of an atherosclerotic plaque and exposure of tissue factor to the blood. An atherosclerotic plaque is formed when platelets adhere to subendothelial collagen. Tissue factor captures factor VII(a) from the circulation and initiates coagulation and fibrin formation to stabilize the primary platelet plug. 9 The formed blood clot can then either locally occlude the blood vessel or embolize and occlude a narrower vessel downstream. In both cases this manifests itself in the clinical symptoms of MI or stroke. It is thought that intraplaque microvessels contribute to the unstable plaque phenotype and are mainly derived from the vasa vasorum by angiogenic sprouting, followed by ingrowth into the lesion. 4, 10, 11 Recently, Rademakers et al. demonstrated that plaqueassociated vasa vasorum were angiogenically active and, albeit poorly, perfused. 7 Moreover, plaque-associated vasa vasorum showed increased permeability, reduced blood flow, and increased leukocyte adhesion and extravasation. These characteristics could contribute to plaque progression and destabilization. Imaging of plaque-angiogenesis could ascertain the exact importance of intraplaque angiogenesis in the prediction of plaque growth and rupture.",

This motif emerged as a recurring sequence during phage display experiments directed against a 5 b 1 integrin, and also surfaced in phage display experiments against a v b 3 integrin. 19 As CD13 is selectively expressed in angiogenesis, it can serve as a target for molecular imaging tracers to noninvasively visualize angiogenic processes in vivo.

Soon, it was found that CD13 was a receptor for NGR-containing peptides. 26 Although CD13 appeared to be the major target of NGR containing peptides, there are large differences in NGR binding among CD13 isoforms. NGR peptides preferentially bind to CD13 on endothelial cells of small angiogenic vessels and to a much lesser extent on CD13 positive large blood vessels or CD13 expressing macrophages. 27 This may be due to the differential utilization of O-glycosylation sites among CD13 isoforms or to conformational changes induced in some CD13 isoforms due to complexation with the proangiogenic protein galectin-3 or other unidentified compounds. 19 3. Structure of aminopeptidase N (CD13) CD13 (EC.3.4.11.2) is a broad specificity aminopeptidase with a preference for neutral amino acids. CD13 occurs as a soluble and a membrane-bound form and multiple distinct glycoforms have been reported. The structure of the 967 amino acids long human CD13 protein has not yet been resolved. However, the membrane-bound form of the protein is known to occur as a non-covalent homodimer with a relative molecular mass of 160 kDa. Each of the monomers consists of a short N-terminal cytoplasmatic domain, a single transmembrane domain and a large, glycosylated extracellular domain that contains the aminopeptidase active site. 28 In addition to the membrane-bound form, soluble CD13 has also been reported in both plasma and urine. 29 ",

Its amino acid substrate order preference has been determined to be Ala > Phe > Tyr > Leu > Arg > Thr > Trp > Lys > Ser > Asp > His > Val. Known peptide substrates of CD13 include the enkephalin, kinin, and hemorphin neuropeptides, the vasoactive angiotensins, the immunomodulatory tetrapeptide tuftsin, and the chemotactic peptides monocyte chemotactic protein 1, and N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine. 29 In addition, human CD13 is a viral receptor for a number of viruses, including human coronavirus 229E and possibly also human cytomegalovirus (HCMV). This function was shown to be independent from its catalytic function, since neither active site mutations nor active site inhibitors affected virus binding to CD13.",

More recently it was observed that the asparagine residue in NGR can spontaneously convert into the isoaspartate resulting in isoDGR. IsoDGR mimics the RGD motif, which is a well-known integrin binding motif. 32 The asparagine to isoaspartate conversion is a known protein aging reaction. The first step for this conversion is the nucleophilic attack of the peptide bond nitrogen of the adjacent amino on the asparagine side chain carbonyl. This leads to the formation of a cyclic succinimide intermediate and the loss of one molecule of ammonia. The succinimide intermediate can undergo hydrolytic ring opening at either carbonyl in the imide ring, giving rise to aspartate or isoaspartate. Isomerization also occurs during this reaction, but only to a limited extent. The major products of the reaction are L-aspartate and L-isoaspartate, typically in a 1:3 ratio (Scheme 1).",

Generally, conversion of asparagine to aspartate can take hours, days or years and depends on a number of factors, including protein microenvironment, pH, ionic strength and temperature.

While CD13 was found to be expressed on vessels in healthy myocardium and also on larger vessels, the cNGR-based probes were found to bind preferentially to CD13 positive small vessels in the angiogenic infarction area. The spontaneous neovascularization through angiogenesis and arteriogenesis likely determines prognosis in patients with coronary artery disease, making this a promising new tool in the cardiovascular imaging toolbox.

In addition, the cNGR-conjugated QDs were barely detectable in muscle tissue, indicating the high specificity for angiogenic vessels compared to regular blood vessels. Finally, TPLSM showed colocalization of cNGR-conjugated QDs with endothelial cells in the tumor vasculature, validating that the binding was specific. 48 This initial study was followed up by a more in depth study of the pharmacokinetic and tumor imaging properties of these cNGR-QD conjugates. In comparing two pharmacokinetic models for the distribution of cNGR-QDs, it was found that a two compartment model fitted best with the observed data. This two compartment model comprised the blood space and endothelial cell surface. Addition of a third extravascular-extracellular compartment revealed an irrelevantly low extravasation parameter and was therefore neglected. Interestingly, some accumulation of cNGR negative QDs in tumor tissue was also observed, probably due to easier extravasation and the presence of large intercellular spaces in tumor tissue. 49 ",
