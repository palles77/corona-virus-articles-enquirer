Emerging infectious diseases are now recognized at an alarming rate of one per year, resulting from emergence of novel infectious agents or re-emergence of previously described diseases [1] . In this paper, we explore the utility of various imaging techniques in the evaluation and management of emerging infectious diseases. These include diseases with systemic manifestations caused by the Ebola, Zika, and Chikungunya viruses, and infections with predominantly respiratory manifestations caused by H1N1, MERS, and SARS viruses. While Multi-and Extensively Drug Resistant Tuberculosis continue to play an important role as emerging infectious diseases, this topic is beyond the scope of this work. An approach to imaging in resource-limited settings will also be discussed, with an emphasis on the necessary safety precautions to prevent nosocomial spread of these infectious agents.",

Small outbreaks have occurred in Africa since its discovery, with population growth and direct interaction with wildlife contributing to increased spread of the virus. There are four viral strains in the genus Ebolavirus that cause disease in humans, with an overall average fatality rate of 50% [4] . The more virulent Zaire Ebolavirus has a 67% fatality rate and was responsible for the West African Epidemic of 2013 that started in Guinea and quickly spread to Liberia and Sierra Leone. The epidemic peaked in 2014 and ended in 2016, and was the largest recorded EVD outbreak with over 28,000 cases and 11,000 deaths (although the magnitude of the outbreak is likely underestimated) [3] . EVD is ongoing, with recent smaller outbreaks in the Democratic Republic of Congo in 2018 [5] . African fruit bats are believed to be the reservoir host for humans and other primates.",

A key component of EVD management is containment and control of the highly contagious infection, including contact tracing, use of personal protective equipment, and safe burial practices. Treatment is supportive, including intravenous fluid and electrolyte repletion. Additional supportive methods such as mechanical ventilation and temporary hemodialysis are sometimes utilized in the developed world, but are unavailable in resource-limited settings, where treatment is often limited to oral rehydration [8 \u2022\u2022 ] .

Due to its systemic, non-specific manifestations, imaging is most useful for monitoring supportive treatment, rather than evaluating the direct effect of the disease on specific organs [7, 8 \u2022\u2022 ]. Although infrequently available in resource-limited settings, when supportive measures like central venous access or mechanical ventilation are accessible, more specific indications for imaging exist. For example, point of care ultrasound (US) is useful for central venous catheter placement and assessing for associated complications, such as pneumothorax or deep venous thrombosis [10] . Chest radiography is useful in monitoring cardiopulmonary status, assessing central line and endotracheal tube placement, and determining when aggressive measures like endotracheal intubation are indicated [10] .",

Other hospitals have developed similar protocols and successfully prevented the spread of Ebola virus to healthcare workers treating their Ebola patients [7, 9] . When developing a protocol for safely imaging patients with Ebola virus, it is important to use products that adequately kill the virus without damaging the medical equipment. For example, chlorine-based cleaning products may cause erosion of the electrical contact plates of US batteries and charging docks [10] . Ideally, a fully digital system where the x-ray detector can transmit images wirelessly should be used. This would allow the equipment to remain in the patient's room throughout treatment. However, this is usually not available in areas affected by EVD [7, 8 \u2022\u2022 ].",

Congenital infection causes direct cellular injury to brain tissue, resulting in microcephaly and retinal damage, with less common defects including congenital contractures and hypertonia. In adults and older children, Zika infection may cause several neurologic manifestations, including Guillain-Barre Syndrome and neuropathy [16] . The WHO recommends continued vigilance for Zika virus infection, which continues to spread due to climate change, urbanization, and globalization [17] . There is no specific treatment for Zika infection, although several vaccines entered clinical trials in 2017.",

The most common prenatal ultrasound finding is microcephaly, defined as head circumference more than two standard deviations below the mean for gestational age [18 \u2022 ]. However, prenatal normocephaly does not exclude congenital Zika infection, as microcephaly can develop after birth. A study of expectant mothers with confirmed Zika infection in Colombia found a 15-to 24-week delay between maternal diagnosis and development of fetal microcephaly, with the earliest detection at 24-week gestational age [15] .

In the first influenza pandemic of the 21st century, the infection spread to more than 190 countries and territories, causing an estimated 61 million cases [30] [31] [32] . The H1N1 2009 influenza virus resulted from reassortment of multiple existing influenza strains including two swine strains, one avian strain, and one human strain, resulting in the name ''swine flu'' [33] . In contradistinction to seasonal influenza, the pandemic H1N1 infection was more virulent in younger adults, obese patients, and pregnant patients. In August 2010, the WHO announced that the H1N1 2009 influenza virus has moved into the post-pandemic period, and that the virus is expected to cause seasonal flu for years to come. During the 2013-2014 season, H1N1 was the predominant virus causing influenza-like illness, with significant morbidity and mortality [34] . Clinical features include fever, cough, rhinorrhea, dyspnea, myalgias, and gastrointestinal symptoms, with secondary complications ranging from bacterial pneumonia to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) [30] . Although the infection was mostly self-limited, 274,000 hospitalizations and 12,500 deaths were reported in 2009, and the CDC reported that 25% of hospitalized patients required ICU admission [31, 32] . Treatment includes supportive measures, antivirals in patients at high risk of complications, and antibiotics for secondary bacterial infections. Chest radiographs are the most frequently utilized study in the evaluation of H1N1 infection. Up to 56% of initial studies in H1N1-infected patients are normal [35, 36] . In severe cases or with disease progression, patients may rapidly develop bilateral ground glass opacities, consolidation, and reticular opacities, predominantly in the mid to lower lung zones [36] [37] [38] [39] [40] [41] . Radiographic abnormalities correlate with disease progression, with bilateral, diffuse, peribronchovascular consolidation correlating with the subsequent need for mechanical ventilation and development of ARDS [41] (Fig. 5) . Up to 67% of hospitalized patients with H1N1 will require mechanical ventilation [41] . Chest radiographs are also helpful in monitoring for short-and long-term complications of H1N1 infection, such as secondary bacterial pneumonia, ARDS, or pulmonary fibrosis (Figs. 6, 7) .",

The CT findings mirror CXR abnormalities, with ground glass opacity being most common (53% of cases), followed by ground glass opacity with consolidation (33%), consolidation (20%), and interlobular septal thickening (27%) [54] . More rarely and later in the disease course, crazy paving, tree-in-bud nodularity, organizing pneumonia, and cavitation have been described. While not typical of viral pneumonias, pleural effusions are noted in 33% of patients and serve as a poor prognostic indicator. As with CXR, CT involvement can be quantified using the same six-zone scoring system, with a higher score associated with a higher mortality rate in adults [53] . While the incidence of abnormalities detected on CT appears lower than the corresponding CXR abnormalities, this is likely related to utilization of CT only in patients with high suspicion of disease whose CXRs were normal or showed only subtle abnormalities that required further characterization. When there is confirmed or suspected MERS infection, appropriate patient isolation with airborne droplet precautions, as described for H1N1-infected individuals, are necessary to safely image the patients while preventing nosocomial transmission to healthcare workers and patients.",

            "text": "Extrapulmonary radiographic manifestations of SARS are not widely reported in the literature, although SARS-CoV isolates have been found in the bowel, spleen, liver, lymph nodes, and kidneys at autopsy [57] . Because many SARS patients received high-dose corticosteroids, osteonecrosis and decreased bone density have been reported [62, 63] . Similar to patients with suspected MERS infection, appropriate isolation of the SARS-infected patient is important to prevent nosocomial transmission. Patients should be screened and appropriately isolated and masked for safe imaging and diagnosis. In the 2003 outbreak, 75% of SARS cases in Singapore were contracted in the hospital setting, with 10 cases directly linked to the imaging department [64 \u2022 ]. This highlights the importance of early suspicion and appropriate isolation, specifically within the imaging department.",

Emerging infectious diseases often arise in resource-limited settings, where radiography and ultrasound can contribute to initial diagnosis and monitoring of disease complications. CT and MRI, when available, also contribute to evaluation of disease progression. In the setting of highly contagious disease entities such as SARS or Ebola, it is imperative to understand methods of disease transmission, as well as adhere to appropriate disinfection protocols while imaging to limit nosocomial disease spread. As new disease outbreaks are unpredictable and can spread rapidly, it is important for radiologists to recognize the impact medical imaging can have on the global dissemination of these highly infectious disease agents.
