The inadequate availability of biological reference materials for these pathogens poses a genuine obstacle in pursuit of these objectives, and the lack of a comprehensive and equitable framework for developing reference materials is a weakness. We outline the need for internationally standardized biological materials for high-threat pathogens as a core element of global health security. We also outline the key components of a framework for addressing this deficiency.",

In 2015, WHO launched the Research and Development Blueprint for Action to Prevent Epidemics, a global strategy and preparedness plan that seeks to build upon the successes and address the gaps identified during the 2014 EVD outbreak by focusing on severe, emerging diseases with the potential to create a public health emergency and for which inadequate treatment and preventive options are currently available (8, 9) . The blueprint is organized such that operations fall into 4 clusters of activities: 1) improving coordination, 2) accelerating research and development processes, 3) developing norms and standards, and 4) streamlining operational research and development response during outbreaks. Furthermore, the second cluster, which focused on accelerating research and development processes, is subdivided into 3 distinct areas of work: 1) assessing epidemic threats and defining priority pathogens; 2) developing research and development roadmaps to accelerate evaluation of diagnostics, therapeutics, and vaccines; and 3) outlining appropriate regulatory and ethical pathways.",

For each priority disease on the list, a research and development roadmap is to be produced that encompasses diagnostics, vaccines, and therapeutics. The first research and development roadmap to have been developed and published is for Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) (12) , which serves to inform the roadmap generation process for other diseases on the priority pathogen list. Within the MERS-CoV roadmap, development of reference reagents has been identified as a priority, but the major operational and ethical issues associated with sourcing and obtaining bulk starting material for such reagents have not been discussed. An allied initiative is the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness and Innovation (CEPI), whose aim is to accelerate development of vaccines for high-threat pathogens (13) . The necessity for reference materials in development and evaluation of new diagnostics, vaccines, and biotherapeutics has been recognized by CEPI by the formation of a Working Group on Standards and Assays, but they are not explicitly considered in the WHO research and development blueprint.",

On August 8, 2014, WHO declared the Ebola outbreak in West Africa to be a public health emergency of international concern. This declaration led to subsequent concerted efforts from the international scientific community to accelerate development of Ebola vaccines, with funding, regulatory and ethical review, expert advice, and manufacturing support being initiated at extraordinary speed (22) . Although vaccine development was considered to be a relatively successful component of the Ebola research and development efforts, and the recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus-Zaire Ebola virus showed high efficacy in a ring vaccination trial (23), this development came too late to have any major effect on the course of the West Africa epidemic. Other candidate vaccines also underwent clinical evaluation, and encouraging safety and immunogenicity data were generated from phase 1 and 2 trials of several candidates. However, studies were performed by different groups with a variety of immunogenicity assays and reference reagents being used, making comparison of immunogenicity results complicated (24) (25) (26) (27) (28) . A set of biological standards that are common to all assays would enable calibration and harmonization of assay data between trials, and could prove vital in determining correlates of protection and clinical outcomes. These standards would also enable better selection of candidate vaccines to transition from the preclinical stage to clinical evaluation. There has been considerable interest in biological therapies for emerging epidemic threats (29) . Convalescent-phase plasma and monoclonal antibodies have been evaluated as treatment for Ebola (30, 31) and have been considered as therapies for Zika virus (32) and MERS-CoV (33, 34) , forming a key focus of the MERS-CoV research and development blueprint roadmap (12) .

Simple blood draws can complicate field operations in the midst of an epidemic, and logistical issues regarding processing and storage of acute, potentially infectious samples can also present many obstacles. However, the ideal starting material for production of antibodybased reference preparations is serum or plasma from convalescent-phase patients. Novel methods for generating fully human immunoglobulin for use as reference materials have been explored when human plasma is not readily available, such as inoculation of transchromosomal cattle and subsequent isolation of antibodies (35, 38, 39) . However, this technology is still relatively new, and convalescent-phase serum is considered superior because it will most closely represent a clinical sample and has a polyclonal range of antibody specificities that can be further optimized by pooling samples. Although many previous clinical studies of the research and development blueprint priority diseases have resulted in collection and storage of plasma from convalescent patients, several obstacles would largely preclude these samples being repurposed to generate reference materials. These issues include sample volume, receipt of appropriate consent, appropriate records, documentation of sample provenance, and willingness of researchers to share samples. A more suitable alternative to repurposing old samples would be to initiate clinical studies with objectives that include acquisition of blood samples for production of reference materials for each of the research and development blueprint priority diseases. However, such studies would have several challenges.",

In addition, these pathogens most commonly cause outbreaks in resource-constrained environments, where poor healthcare infrastructure, limited diagnostic capability, and suboptimal disease reporting systems would limit retrospective identification of suitable patients (40) . For development of Ebola antibody IRPs, plasma was obtained either from recovered EVD patients in Sierra Leone who were enrolled in a convalescent-phase plasma trial or as donations from countries not directly involved in the outbreak (Italy, Norway, the United Kingdom, and the United States) (14, 15) . However, it would be inappropriate to use this example as a model for sample acquisition because it required occurrence of a large and devastating outbreak for a concerted international response to be successful.",

Global initiatives, such as the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infections Consortium, exist to facilitate the rapid response to emerging infectious disease and epidemic threats by aiding the sharing of clinical research tools, such as open-access clinical study protocols. Initiatives such as this consortium would be well placed to bring together international partners and coordinate a collaborative framework to outline processes for acquisition of samples for generation of reference materials.

Such information should be contained in a detailed participant information sheet that should be provided to the donor in advance of providing consent.

At the present time, only a small number of institutions manufacture and provide reference materials to WHO for use as IRPs. Therefore, export of samples to these institutions is an essential step in the production of IRPs for epidemic diseases. Initiatives exist to facilitate sharing of benefits arising from the use of, and access to, human and nonhuman genetic material. An example of such an initiative is the Pandemic Influenza Preparedness (PIP) framework launched by WHO in 2011. The PIP framework seeks to address concerns of low-and middleincome countries that sharing of influenza virus specimens with WHO was not matched with assurances that benefits derived from such sharing would be equitably distributed (41) . Concerns about inequitable sharing of benefits were further exacerbated during the 2009 influenza A(H1N1) pandemic because of unequal access to vaccines (42) . Despite the example set by the PIP framework, more recent epidemics of other infectious diseases have continued to raise issues with regard to sample sharing. For example, local export restrictions in Brazil prevented sharing of well-characterized samples during the recent Zika virus epidemic, thereby presenting an obstacle to rapid development and assessment of diagnostics (43, 44) .",

Negotiations between relevant parties and preemptive interaction between researchers and donor country authorities could lead to clearly defined, mutually agreed upon processes for acquisition and export of samples.

The safe acquisition, processing, exporting, and importing of samples from recovered emerging high-threat disease patients would require careful planning. Requirements would be based on natural history of a specific disease, study site, and patient characteristics, such as period of convalescence since the acute illness. Liaison with national authorities in donor and recipient countries with regard to exportation and importation regulations and requirements would be necessary. In addition, most of these diseases occur primarily in low-and middle-income countries and often in remote or rural settings, where access to accurate medical records and diagnostic tools will be limited.
