Yet, the impact of CARV infection on lung allograft function and survival after lung transplantation is not well defined. Prior studies of CARV infections after lung transplantation have come to varying conclusions with respect to CARV impact on CLAD and graft survival. [14] [15] [16] [17] Viral infections may indirectly influence the development of CLAD via the induction of acute allograft rejection, but recent evidence argues against such a mechanism.

Multivariate Cox proportional hazard models were developed with the covariates being: age at transplantation, type of transplant (single or double), pr-transplant diagnosis, transplant era (2-year time intervals starting in 2000), time-dependent Pseudomonas aeruginosa respiratory isolation (including both colonizations and infections), time-dependent Aspergillus species respiratory isolations (including both small and large conidia), timedependent cumulative acute rejection score, and time-dependent CLAD for the graft loss outcome. Aspergillus and Pseudomonas are common isolates previously identified as significant risk factors in subsets of this cohort, and were therefore included in the model to minimize confounding. 8, 9 For time-dependent Aspergillus, Pseudomonas, and CLAD, each patient is considered to be unexposed to the infection or condition at the time of transplant and is then, upon first infection or diagnosis of CLAD, considered to be exposed for the remainder of the observation period. Variables significant at the p < 0.10 level in univariate analyses were included in multivariate analyses (CMV did not reach criteria for inclusion). The associations between viral infection and the outcomes CLAD and graft loss were assessed using 2 time-dependent approaches to measuring infection: 1) Patients are considered unexposed to viral infection at transplant and then considered to have viral exposure after experiencing any viral infection, and 2) patients are considered unexposed to viral infection at transplant and then categorized as having exposure to asymptomatic viral infection, symptomatic viral infection, or viral pneumonia as they experience episodes of viral infection ranging in severity level. In the time-dependent construction of viral infection severity, a patient retained the highest severity level experienced to date. Univariate Cox proportional hazard models were used to assess the association between time-dependent exposure to the virus's adenovirus, coronavirus, coxsackie/echovirus, influenza A or B, metapneumovirus, parainfluenza, rhinovirus/enterovirus, and RSV and the outcomes CLAD and graft loss. A repeated measure, mixed effects model incorporating all tacrolimus values was used to account for intra-subject correlation among observations. Hazard ratios (HR) are reported with their corresponding confidence intervals (CI) in brackets.

In Kumar, et al 2005, only 8% of patients initially without lower respiratory tract symptoms progressed to lower respiratory tract disease, and all those progressing had either influenza A or parainfluenza viruses. 25 Our data argues against nonpneumonia CARV infections negatively impacting CLAD onset and graft survival. This is clinically important with the contemporary use of high-sensitivity nucleic acid amplification testing that detects viruses in lower and potentially clinically insignificant numbers. Although specific anti-viral medications are only available for a limited number of CARV, the decision to administer adjunctive therapy or inhaled ribavirin is complicated by issues of cost, physical isolation of patients, potential aggravation of respiratory symptoms, and concerns of teratogenicity among healthcare personnel. 26, 27 The finding that infections caused by adenovirus and parainfluenza virus were more likely to progress to CLAD is probably because these viruses were more often associated with viral pneumonia when encountered. We were not able to statistically demonstrate this for Coxsackie/echovirus group, but we suspect the association with CLAD is being driven by a subpopulation of the viruses detected with this PCR reaction, thereby diminishing our ability to see an association with viral pneumonia in this viral group. Prior studies have emphasized that at least for human rhinoviruses, lower respiratory tract disease is associated with a higher viral load. 28 It may be that the PCR-only group of viruses categorized as Coxsackie/ echovirus, which contained a large number of HRV, represented HRV infections with higher viral loads and lower respiratory tract disease. RSV was not an independent risk for CLAD in our study, but has been independently associated with BOS in numerous pre-PCR era studies. We suspect this is due to an unavoidable bias in earlier studies that relied upon passive case detection, limiting CARV identification to sicker patients, and the use of less sensitive, non-PCR based methods in which the paramyxoviruses are more likely to be identified.",

A recent prospective study of 112 lung transplant recipients found a mean transitory loss of 106 mL of FEV1 compared with preinfection lung function testing. 21 Yet, the mechanism by which viral pneumonia increases the risk for CLAD and graft loss is not entirely understood and this study does not directly address this issue. Cases of viral pneumonia may evolve to acute lung injury and diffuse alveolar damage. 29, 30 Diffuse alveolar damage does increase the subsequent risk of CLAD and death after lung transplantation, perhaps via the CXCR3 chemokine axis. 31 Weigt et al also demonstrated that increased CXCR3 ligand CXCL10 and CXCL11 concentrations in BAL during CARV infections predicted FEV1 decline at 6 months. 7 Although these studies suggest a potential mechanism for how CARV pneumonia leads to CLAD, further studies of the lung allograft inflammatory state during and after CARV are necessary to better elucidate the responsible pathways.",

            "text": "Study limitations include the retrospective, single-center nature of this study with an inherent risk of bias that was minimized by using multivariate analysis. Multiplex PCR was not introduced in our laboratory until October 2009, over 9 years into our study time period, although this did not impact our assessment of outcomes. We hypothesize that the reason its introduction did not impact our model is that significant viral infections caused by influenza, parainfluenza, enterovirus, RSV, and adenovirus were already being identified adequately prior to the introduction of PCR testing. We suspect that our relatively low rates of influenza infection can be explained in part by high rates of influenza vaccination in our cohort and preemptive therapy with oseltamivir during peak season. Another limitation includes the difficulty in diagnosing viral pneumonia in immunocompromised patients who may have subtle imaging findings not easily seen on chest radiographs. Most patients in our study did not have CT scans at the time of CARV diagnosis. This may have resulted in underestimating the total number of patients with pneumonia. The irregular PFT follow-up times after CARV episodes in our cohort did not allow us to determine what is the greatest time period of risk for CLAD following CARV without introducing significant bias into our models. Furthermore, while we have positive data for each CARV episode, we have little negative data and cannot comment upon the duration of viral exposure. Bacterial coinfection during or shortly after CARV may contribute to graft loss and CLAD. However, we observed only 14 cases of this concurrent viral and bacterial infection state in our data set (defined as within 30 days of 1 another). Given this small sample size we were underpowered to detect our expected effect.",

We did not find that any particular CLAD phenotype was more commonly associated with viral pneumonia.CARV did not impact graft loss (HR 1.34 [0.98, 1.83], p = 0.07) when analyzed without regard for clinical severity. However, when consideration of clinical severity was included in the analysis, viral pneumonia alone was associated with increased risk (HR 2.78 [1.55, 5.00], p < 0.01) (Figure 4). Asymptomatic viral infection (HR 0.74 [0.39, 1.43], p = 0.37) and symptomatic viral infection (HR 1.39 [0.63, 3.04], p = 0.41) did not reach statistical significance for graft loss. Aspergillus (HR 1.37 [1.04, 1.79], p=0.03), Pseudomonas (HR 1.90 [1.44, 2.51], p<0.01), and CLAD (HR 5.06 [3.72, 6.88], p<0.01) also increased the risk of graft loss (Figure 4).We also considered whether some individual viruses were more likely than others to increase the risk of CLAD or graft loss.Indeed, adenovirus (HR 13.42 [2.81, 64.59], p < 0.01), parainfluenza (HR 2.18 [1.34, 3.56], p < 0.01) and Coxsackie/echovirus (HR 2.60 [1.29, 5.29], p = 0.01) increased the risk of CLAD.
