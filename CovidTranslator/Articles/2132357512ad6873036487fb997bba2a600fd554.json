The increased availability of preprocessed foods and the improved survival of persons with immune defects have affected the sources and nature of foodborne illness (1) (2) (3) (4) . Increased mobility of Americans through interstate travel has complicated the identification and investigation of outbreaks. New technologies for outbreak investigation have the potential to greatly assist public health officials in successfully managing these changing factors. We describe an outbreak of Salmonella enterica serotype Javiana infections affecting a large group of geographically dispersed organ transplant recipients. The prompt and successful investigation of this outbreak was facilitated by the use of Web-based surveys.",

Our approach allowed us to contact and question several hundred geographically dispersed persons in a matter of days. Survey respondents' answers were automatically stored in a secure electronic database, eliminating the need for data entry. With the development of questionnaire templates, a public health official could select sets of questions and precoded answers from pull-down menus and modify them to design an outbreak-specific, Web-based questionnaire that is automatically linked to an electronic database (5) .

Use of a Web-based investigation tool limited responses to only those Transplant Games attendees with known email addresses and Internet access. The initial response rate to our survey was only 34%; households with ill persons may have been more likely to respond to our Web-based survey. However, most (>75%) respondents to both surveys were from households in which no one had experienced illness, which provided us with a sufficient number of responses from both well and ill persons to identify the source of the outbreak. Hospitalized and severely ill persons may have been too sick to respond to the survey or may have been unable to access the Internet, which limited our ability to calculate accurate hospitalization or attack rates among persons attending the Transplant Games.

A Web-based approach to data collection can also play a critical role in rapidly sharing data in outbreaks involving multiple jurisdictions (7) .

She is currently a clini-cal fellow in the Division of Infectious Diseases and a postdoctoral fellow at the Center for AIDS Prevention Studies at the University of California, San Francisco.
