The recombinant proteins induce immune responses and have several benefits over current vaccine technologies, including increased safety, economy, stability, versatility and efficacy. Antigens expressed in corn are particularly advantageous since the seed can be produced in vast quantities and shipped over long distances at ambient temperature, potentially allowing global vaccination. We have expressed the B-subunit of Escherichia coli heat-labile enterotoxin and the spike protein of swine transmissible gastroenteritis virus at high levels in corn, and demonstrate that these antigens delivered in the seed elicit protective immune responses.",

The dissection of pathogens into their various components allows the development of specific subunit vaccines that are just as efficacious but are safer than whole pathogen vaccines. However, despite recent advances in vaccine research, the most common route of vaccination remains that of parenteral injection. The development of a broadly applicable oral delivery system remains a goal for the efficient widespread administration of vaccines, but unfortunately this has proven impractical in most cases to date. The use of subunit vaccines for oral delivery has been generally resisted because of the obvious likelihood of protein degradation in the gut. Furthermore, even if the protein were to survive within an oral delivery system, there is no certainty that trafficking the protein to the gut would be sufficient to mount an immune response.",

            "text": "Recently, transgenic plants have been investigated as an alternative means to produce and deliver vaccines. There are several reports demonstrating that antigens derived from various pathogens can be synthesized at high levels and in their authentic forms in plants [1] [2] [3] . When administered orally, by feeding, such antigens can induce an immune response [4, 5] and, in some cases at least, result in protection against a subsequent challenge with the pathogen [6, 7] . Certain antigens expressed in plants have shown sufficient promise to warrant human clinical trials [8, 9] . This has led to optimism that the inherent advantages of plants can be used to dramatically change the way in which we deliver vaccines, and indeed that plants can become the delivery vehicle of choice for future vaccines. Combining the normal use of plants as human foods and as animal feed, with the production of vaccine subunit components in plant tissues, should allow vaccines to be produced at a fraction of the cost of other approaches. For the same cost, the recipient may take 100 or even 1000 times the dose of antigen that would be delivered by the parenteral injection route. We are exploring the use of corn grain as a particularly convenient delivery system for edible vaccines using both human and commercial animal examples, including vaccines against enterotoxigenic strains of Escherichia coli (ETEC) and swine transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV).",

This toxin has a multi-subunit structure very similar to cholera toxin and consists of a pentamer of receptor binding (B) subunits and a single enzymatic (A) subunit [12] . Approximately 66% of ETEC strains harbor LT, and in about half of these strains LT is the only toxin present [13] .

It is a highly contagious enteric disease that is characterized by vomiting, severe diarrhea and high mortality in piglets less than 2 weeks of age. The causal agent of TGE is a multi-subunit, enveloped, single-stranded RNA virus, TGEV, belonging to the genus Corona6irus of the family Coronaviridae [15] . It contains three structural proteins designated M, N and S. Protein M is an integral membrane protein, N is a phosphoprotein that encapsulates the viral RNA genome, and S (spike) is a large surface glycoprotein [15] . Pigs that survive a first infection are immune to subsequent infections of the virus [16] , probably due to local mucosal immunity in the intestine through the activation of S-IgA. Thus, vaccines that target the activation of the mucosal surface of the intestine are particularly attractive in the control of TGE and similar diseases. We have expressed the S protein of TGEV in corn and show that it is protective in a piglet feeding trial.",

This signal sequence is cleaved upon protein export and results in high levels of protein accumulation in the cell wall [17] . A maize codon optimized version of the S protein of TGEV was constructed in a similar manner and also fused to the barley a-amylase signal sequence.

Immature zygotic embryos were isolated from the ears under sterile conditions and washed twice with co-cultivation medium. A suspension of A. tumefaciens was added directly to the embryos and the mixture was vortexed vigorously for 30 s and incubated at room temperature for 5 min. Embryos were placed scutellum side up onto co-cultivation medium and were incubated at 19\u00b0C in the dark for 3-5 days. They were then transferred to antibiotic-containing medium without herbicide selection and were incubated for a further 3 days in the dark at 27-28\u00b0C. Subsequently, embryos and calli were transferred to fresh herbicide containing selection medium every 2 weeks, and the callus was finally transferred onto regeneration medium.

On days 0 -10 of the study all piglets in each of three groups of 10 animals were withheld from feed overnight, prior to administering corn to two of the study groups. The corn ration for a piglet consisted of either 100 g of wild type corn or 50 g of transgenic corn (corresponding to approximately 2 mg of the S protein of TGEV) mixed with 50 g of wild type corn. The corn was mixed with medicated milk replacer to give a thick oatmeal-like consistency. For the two groups of piglets receiving corn, a line of prepared meal sufficient for the whole group was placed on a clean dry floor and attempts were made to ensure that each piglet received an adequate portion. The piglets were then returned to regular water and medicated weaning rations. Piglets in the third group were orally vaccinated with the current commercially available modified live vaccine MLV TGEV on days 0 and 7 of the study according to label directions. On day 12 of the study all animals were orally challenged with a 2 ml dose of virulent TGEV (Purdue strain, titer 10 7.6 FAID 50 's per dose). Prior work had shown that this dose should produce a clinically typical TGE watery diarrhea in 21 -28 day old piglets that would persist for 7 -10 days, but would not be lethal. Following challenge, piglets were scored twice daily for signs of diarrhea (normal= 0, creamy =1, watery=2) and other symptoms (dehydration and depression, or anorexia= 1, vomitus= 3, moribund or death =10) to give a total clinical score. The clinical symptom data for each study group are presented as a percent morbidity incidence (number of animals with clinical signs\\2 divided by total number of animals), a percent morbidity incidence and duration (total number of clinical observations\\ 2 divided by total number of pig days), and a clinical severity index (total clinical score divided by total number of pig days).

Firstly, transgenic plants are usually engineered to express only a small antigenic portion of a pathogen or toxin, eliminating the possibility of infection or innate toxicity and reducing the potential for adverse reaction. Secondly, since there are no known human or animal pathogens that are able to infect plants, concerns with viral or prion contamination are eliminated. Thirdly, the successful synthesis of foreign proteins in transgenic crops rely on the same established technologies to sow, harvest, store, transport and process plant material as those currently used for food crops, making transgenic plants a very economical means of large-scale vaccine production. Fourthly, the expression of foreign proteins in the natural storage tissues of plants maximizes protein stability, so reducing the need for refrigeration and keeping transportation and storage costs low [17] . Fifthly, the formulation of multi-component vaccines is possible by blending the seed of transgenic lines expressing different proteins. Sixthly, direct oral administration is possible when the chosen proteins are expressed in commonly consumed food plants to give edible vaccines.",
