In an attempt to address this, avian and human influenza HA pseudotyped retroviruses have been successfully employed in antibody neutralization assays. In this study we generated an equine influenza pseudotyped lentivirus for serological screening. This was achieved by co-transfection of HEK293T cells with plasmids expressing the haemagglutinin (HA) protein of an H3N8 subtype equine influenza virus strain, HIV gag-pol and firefly luciferase reporter genes and harvesting virus from supernatant. In order to produce infective pseudotype particles it was necessary to additionally co-transfect a plasmid encoding the TMPRSS2 endoprotease to cleave the HA. High titre pseudotype virus (PV) was then used in PV antibody neutralization assays (PVNAs) to successfully distinguish between vaccinated and non-vaccinated equines. The sera were also screened by single radial haemolysis (SRH) assay. There was a 65% correlation between the results of the two assays, with the PVNA assay appearing slightly more sensitive. Future work will extend the testing of the PVNA with a larger number of serum samples to assess sensitivity/specificity, inter/intra-laboratory variability and to define a protective titre.",

A number of avian and human influenza virus subtypes have been pseudotyped and used in such serological assays ( Temperton et al, 2007; Temperton and Wright, 2009; Corti et al, 2011; Garcia and Lai, 2011) . A pseudotype virus has the 'core' of one virus (e.g., a retrovirus) and the outer 'envelope' protein of another (e.g., the HA of influenza virus). The core virus has deletions in the genome making it replicationdeficient, and harbours a reporter transgene (e.g., luciferase). The envelope glycoprotein permits entry into susceptible target cells. During cell transduction, the pseudotype virus (PV) genome becomes integrated in the cell genome and expresses the reporter gene. Thus the number of transduced cells can be quantified and the subsequent inhibitory effects of antibodies in serum on PV entry determined (Temperton et al, 2007; Temperton and Wright, 2009; Garcia and Lai, 2011) .",

The HA1 mediates binding to the sialic acid receptor, while HA2 is involved in membrane fusion. A number of proteases have been implicated in this cleavage process. The HA0 of highly-pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) viruses of the H5 and H7 subtypes (e.g., A/Viet Nam/1203/2004 (H5N1)) have a polybasic cleavage site containing multiple arginine and lysine residues that are cleaved by ubiquitous subtilisin-like endoproteases such as furin (reviewed in Steinhauer, 1999) . All other influenza A viruses, including low pathogenicity avian influenza viruses, seasonal human influenza and H3 equine influenza viruses, have monobasic cleavage sites with a single lysine or arginine residue ( Figure 2 ). It has been shown that cleavage at these sites is mediated by specific type II transmembrane serine proteases such as TMPRSS2 and HAT (human airway trypsin-like protease) found in human airways (B\u00f6ttcher et al, 2006; . Consequently, we included a plasmid expressing the TMPRSS2 protease in the transfection procedure to mediate cleavage of the monobasic cleavage site in the equine pseudotype virus. By this approach, a high titre EIPV was successfully generated.",

In a comparison of SRH, neutralization using swine embryo kidney (ESK) cells and HI tests using serum samples from horses that had received two doses of vaccine, Yamagishi et al (1982) found reasonable correlation between the assays. The correlation between the SRH assay and the neutralisation test was 75% (r = 0.75). This is comparable to the 65% correlation (r = 0.65) seen between SRH and PVNA in the present study.
