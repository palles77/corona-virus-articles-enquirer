[2] [3] [4] [5] The speed at which infectious diseases spread today is due, in part, to global migration and travel. Diseases typically thought to exist only in specific areas of the world are now being seen in non-traditional areas. Factors contributing to disease emergence include population growth, climate and ecological changes, increasing contact with animals, international trade, and inadequate public health infrastructure. In addition, there are multiple other factors that affect the spread of infectious diseases, including mutation, cultural practices, 6 poor living conditions, the availability of clean water and proper sanitation in less developed countries, drug resistance, natural disasters, immunization practices, and distrust of the medical community. Diseases previously brought under control by vaccinations in the United States may be transported into the country by travelers from other countries. 6 Education on methods for infectious disease control and containment is a priority. In planning for infectious disease outbreaks, it is essential to include local public health and private resources. 3 ",

A pandemic plan is recommended that ensures business continuity in the event of a widespread outbreak of an infectious disease. Such plans are implemented in concert with appropriate jurisdictional agencies and include procedures for the care of exposed, infected, and deceased individuals. 8 The CDC standards limit transport of patients who require diagnostic and therapeutic procedures that cannot be performed in their rooms. 9 Pandemic threats are forecast to appear at faster rates, so preparation times between pandemics will grow shorter and emergency nurses must be ready to respond. 5 The impact of an infectious disease outbreak may be mitigated by advanced planning and preparedness. It should start with screening new-hire employee health, immunization history, antibody titer assessment, and respiratory N-95 fit testing requirements. 3, 5, 6, 10 One way to ensure a healthy workforce is to generate immunity to infectious diseases via mandatory disease-specific vaccinations. 3, 11 With migration of people growing globally, infectious diseases can now spread at an unprecedented rate. 6 Well-trained staff, educated in the importance of taking a detailed exposure history, including recent travel or exposure to ill persons as well as exposure to pets or other animals, can be the first line of defense in preventing the spread of disease. Respiratory hygiene and cough etiquette, in addition to hand hygiene and personal protective equipment, are now considered part of standard precautions. 13 The spread of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus by patients and their family members highlights the need for prompt implementation of standard precautions with patient, family, and visitor education. 9 Seven major human diseases have come under some degree of control worldwide because of vaccines: smallpox, diphtheria, tetanus, yellow fever, whooping cough, polio, and measles. 12 While vaccinations may be available, some individuals choose not to vaccinate due to fear of side effects or because of religious or personal beliefs. Individuals from countries where vaccination rates are very low pose a risk to emergency care providers and the public upon entering this country. 7 Mandatory reporting requirements for confirmed infectious diseases, which vary from state to state, help to control these diseases.",
