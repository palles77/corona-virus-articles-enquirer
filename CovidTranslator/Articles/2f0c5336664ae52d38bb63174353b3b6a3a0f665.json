It is an enveloped, positive-stranded RNA virus with a genome of approximately 30 kb, encompassing five major open reading frames (ORFs) which encode the replicase polyproteins, the spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N) proteins. Besides these major proteins, SARS-CoV genome also encodes five to eight putative accessory proteins that share little homology with any known proteins of other coronaviruses [2, 3] .",

For instance, group-specific ORFs of murine coronavirus were found to be non-essential for viral replication, yet their deletions were attenuating in natural hosts [5] . Recent research on the SARS-CoV have also indi-cated that accessory proteins SARS 3a, 3b and 7a could induce apoptosis [6] [7] [8] . On the other hand, coronavirus infection in the early stages had been reported to stimulate epithelial cells, causing cellular proliferation and squamous metaplasia in the lungs [9] . Interestingly, SARS 6 has been shown to increase DNA synthesis in mammalian cells of epithelium origins [10] .",

Several studies had suggested that human SARS-CoV evolved from SARS-CoV-like virus harbored in exotic animals such as palm civet cats [11] . Evolutionary studies of zoonotic and human SARS-CoV have indicated that in the early phase of the SARS epidemic, ORF8 was encoded as a single ORF while isolates of human SARS-CoV at a later stage of the epidemic contained a 29-nucleotide deletion which resulted in two ORFs designated as ORF8a and ORF8b [11] . This deletion might be associated with transmission of the virus during the epidemic [12] . In this study, the cellular localization and functional roles of SARS 8b were examined.",

The expected bands of EGFP (27 kDa) and SARS8b-EGFP (36.6 kDa) were observed, indicating the proteins were expressed in the cells. Interestingly, a smaller band with size of about 30 kDa was observed in both transfected Vero E6 and CHO cells (Fig. 1, lanes 2 and  5) . This band was speculated to be a truncated form of the SARS 8b-EGFP protein due to proteolytic cleavages, which are common processing steps of viral proteins. For instance, Ito et al. reported that the 3a protein of SARS-CoV might undergo specific proteolytic processing [14] . Studies have also shown that the multiple cleavages of the precore protein of the hepatitis B virus resulted in different sizes of smaller proteins which could be translocated from the cytosol to other compartments of the cell [15] . SARS 8b may possibly employ similar mechanism as the 3a or the precore protein and the smaller band might be a processed form of the protein. However, further investigation is required to verify this hypothesis.",

Although the ability of SARS 8b in cell proliferation may seem counterintuitive to the apoptotic characteristics of SARS 3a, 3b and 7a [6] [7] [8] , past examples have shown that accessory proteins produced by a virus can be multifunctional and sometimes elicit counteracting effects. For instance, p12 I , one of the accessory proteins of the human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) which localizes at the ER and cis-Golgi compartments, is able to promote T-lymphocytes proliferation and enhances the effectiveness of viral transmission during the early stage of infection [20] [21] [22] . Interestingly, HTLV-1 p13 II , which is another accessory protein of HTLV-1 that localizes in the inner membranes of mitochondria, displays apoptotic effect on both animal model and human Jurkat T-cells [23, 24] . Therefore, it is possible that SARS 8b work in a similar fashion as the HTLV-1 p12 I , causing cell proliferation that helps in viral transmission in the early stage of the infection. In fact, the cell proliferative effect of SARS 8b in epithelial cell lines used in this study is consistent to the pathology of epithelial proliferation observed in SARS patients [9] .",

Studies have also shown that SARS 3a, 3b and 7a could cause apoptosis in mammalian cells [6] [7] [8] . In this study, we examined the effects of SARS 8b on DNA synthesis in the context of mammalian cell lines as a prelude. The possibility that in the context of the complete SARS-CoV genome, the function of the SARS 8b may not be related to an increase in DNA synthesis cannot not be excluded. For instance, a combination of SARS-CoV 8b and some other accessory proteins may function to shut off host macromolecular synthesis. Further analyses will be required to verify the significance of the cell proliferative function of SARS 8b in the context of SARS-CoV infection and the whole viral genome. Nevertheless, consistent with the previous report of the presence of SARS 6 and SARS 8b mRNA associated with SARS-CoV infection [26] , the results in this study further substantiate the compatible co-expression of the two viral proteins in the cells. The distribution of SARS 8b throughout the cell suggests its potential to interact with multiple cellular partners as well as the products of the SARS-CoV genome located both in the cytoplasm and nucleus which may in turn modify cellular function, i.e. DNA synthesis.
