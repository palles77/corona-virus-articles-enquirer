            "text": "Numerous living organisms possess fascinating structural coloration. However, transparency in insects is rare to observe among terrestrial life due to significant surface reflections between living tissues and air 1,2 . In this context, the longtail glasswing C. faunus butterfly is an interesting example given it possesses the structural basis to support both reflection-based coloration and transmissionbased transparency. The transparency of the postdiscal area can be well-explained by effective medium theory and a transfer matrix model similar to other anti-reflective subwavelength nanostructures found in nature considering low absorption of chitin 2, 3 . The subwavelength nanodomeshaped structures of the postdiscal area induces a refractive index with a linear gradient from 1 for air to 1.56 for the chitin membrane, and effectively reduces surface reflection 2,3 . Nanodome-shaped structures of the postdiscal area are hexagonally arranged and hence, a hexagonal unit cell was considered with an area of Ahex = \u221a3/2d 2 where d is the center-to-center distance between adjacent nanodomes. The radius of the nanodome at height z was provided by r(z) = r0 \u221a(1 -z/\u210e), where h is the height of the nanodomes, and r0 is the base radius that is equal to d/2. Consequently, the postdiscal nanodome area at height z is given by ATP(z) = \u03c0r0 2 (1z/h), and the volume fraction of chitin as a function of actual height is given by:",

No UV signature in the postdiscal areas was observed, whereas the basal areas showed violet-coloured reflectance under UV illumination ( Supplementary Fig. S3 ). The short-range-ordered nanostructures with subwavelength periods in the postdiscal areas exhibited minimal scattering and high transparency in the UV-VIS light. However, similar nanostructures in the basal areas with larger inter-structural spacing comparable to the light wavelength generated backscattering in the UV range. The short-range order of the nanostructures in the spatial arrangement introduces a phase correlation in the backscattered light, leading to a coherent reflection peak in the UV regime as shown in Supplementary Fig. S4A . The characteristic length scale of the nanostructures generates such strong backward scattering of light within a narrow frequency range 8 . In general, for any wave vector of k > kb/2, short-range structural order introduces a phase correlation of light scattered by adjacent particles 9 . kb ranges between 0.021 nm -1 and 0.032 nm -1 in our 2D FFT calculation of the basal area and hence kb/2 corresponds to the frequencies in the blue spectrum.",

The UV signature with a peak at a wavelength of 345 nm is confirmed by the optical spectra shown in Supplementary Fig. S4A of the basal area. The total reflection of postdiscal area is remarkably low over the whole UV-VIS regime. In order to confirm that the UV reflection of the basal area is structure-based, we removed the structural effect by soaking the wing in bromoform (n = 1.57) to match the refractive index of the inter-structural space to that of the nanostructures. After soaking, we repeated the reflection measurement and observed no reflection from the basal region confirming the structural origin of the reflection property ( Supplementary Fig. S4B ).",

Indeed, it has been shown that increase in surface hydrophobicity (contact angle change from 15\u00ba to 100\u00ba) correlated directly with increase in surface adsorption of bacteria, algal spores, and eukaryotic cells [33] [34] [35] [36] The second possible case occurs when the cell membrane does not elongate to fill the gaps in the nanopatterned substrate. It has been shown that this situation leads to a reduction in adhesion points between the substrate and cells 39 , leading to poor adhesion of cells on patterned surfaces as compared to a flat surface and consequently easier detachment. Therefore, nanotopology-driven outcomes such as membrane deformation or reduction in adhesion points contribute towards destabilizing the interaction between the cell membrane and substrate, improving resistance to cellular adsorption. Our results demonstrate that nanostructured Si3N4 surface shows a drastic decrease in both prokaryotic and mammalian cellular adhesion as compared to a flat substrate (with or without plasma treatment) due to the increased contribution from the nanotopology (Supplementary Fig. S17C-D) . This is evident from the fact that greater cell adhesion resistance is offered by the nanostructured Si3N4 surface over the plasma-treated Si3N4 surface of a similar contact angle.",

A sharp reduction in adherent live cell density was observed upon structuring Si3N4 with nanostructures (n = 10 representative images). b, HeLa cell viability was quantified as the ratio between the number of dead to living cells per field-of-view using 10 representative fields-of-view captured through widefield epifluorescence microscopy (n = 10 representative images). Higher rates of physically induced lyses were observed with increased nanostructured Si3N4 aspect-ratios. The aspect-ratio of 0.45 chosen to implement the nanostructured Si3N4-membrane for the IOP-sensing implant is highlighted in red. The experiment was conducted once. Error bars are given by the standard deviation about the mean. The decrease in cavity gap size results in a blue-shift of the FP-cavity resonance spectrum which would be detected through reflection spectroscopy. c, A measured raw spectrum (top) and how its peaks map into the pre-characterization lines (bottom) generated in benchtop studies performed on the sensor before implantation. Each pre-characterization line represents the position of the associated peak as a function of pressure. The lines were generated by placing the sensor inside a pressure-controlled chamber connected with a reference digital pressure gauge and a pressure controller, and during a pressure ramp at a step size of 0.2 mmHg, the peak locations of each raw spectrum at a given pressure (provided by the digital pressure gauge) is recorded along with the pressure level. The relation between the given pressure and the associated set of the peak locations is one-to-one mapping. During in vivo studies, an IOP-identification algorithm maps the location of the major peaks in the raw spectrum reflected from the sensor to the best matching IOP-level using the pre-characterization lines. d, Custom-built hand-held detector interfaced with a CCD camera and a mini-spectrometer for live in vivo IOP detection in awake New Zealand white rabbits.",

Decrease in protein adsorption as a function of increasing surface wettability becomes evident when comparing the results obtained for plasma treated and non-plasma treated substrates, as shown in Supplementary Fig. S17B. After 2 hours of incubation, the extent of protein adhesion on the plasma-treated Si3N4 and nanostructured Si3N4 surfaces are almost the same. This could be attributed to the dominance of the antifouling contribution from the hydrophilicity as the length-scale of the nanotopology of the nanostructured Si3N4 surface is over an order of magnitude greater than the size of proteins, implying that the nanoscale geometry effect is possibly negligible.",

Being in the same length-scale or more typically an order of magnitude smaller than cells, nanotopology plays a greater role in biofouling resistance against bacteria and mammalian cells (Supplementary Fig. S17C-D). Various reports have claimed that structured surfaces reduce biofouling as compared to flat substrates 21,33,34 . Two primary cases can be considered when cells are interacting with patterned substrates. The first case is when cells can elongate to increase their interaction with the surface and fill the gaps between nanostructures 37 . This cellular elongation directly leads to an increase in surface tension along the cell membrane and has been modelled by Pogodin et al. assuming a planar piece of membrane 38 . The increase in interfacial surface energy is described by 38 , \u03b70 represents the surface density of adsorption sites on the membrane; \u03b5 represents energy gained per unit of adsorption site; \u03b1(r) represents the local degree of cell membrane stretching at point r; and d\u03c3 is the elemental surface area. The integration is performed over the total contact area between the cell membrane and the nanostructured surface. For high-aspect-ratio structures such as the nanopillars (diameter 160 nm, height 200 nm) described by Pogodin et al 38 , stretching of the membrane can eventually lead to rupture and cell lysis. For low-aspect-ratio nanostructures structures with an average diameter of 345 nm and height of 150 nm, our experimental results have not shown any signs of cell lysis (Supplementary Fig. S14-16), indicating that while membrane elongation is likely increasing \u03b3CS in equation 6 and improving biocompatibility of the substrate, cell membranes are not rupturing.",

Supplementary Figure S4 | Reflection spectra of postdiscal and basal transparent areas of C. faunus wing. a, The UV signature of the basal area is clearly visible while the reflection from the postdiscal area is negligible confirming the violet-coloured reflectance under UV illumination of the basal area as seen in Fig. 2a of the manuscript. b, The UV-VIS reflection spectra were obtained when soaking the wing in an index-matching liquid (bromoform, n = 1.57) to cancel out the structural contribution. In this case, no reflectance was observed under UV illumination from the basal area confirming the structural origin of this unique UV signature. Supplementary Figure S5 | Biophysical interaction between HeLa cells and the nanostructures on the C. faunus wing. The nanostructures have an aspect-ratio of approximately 1. Cell densities decreased with increased incubation time, indicating disruption of cellular growth (n = 5 representative images). The experiment was conducted once. Error bars are given by the standard deviation about the mean. Supplementary Figure S6 | Biophysical interaction between E. coli and the nanostructures on the C. faunus wing. Several (n = 20) high-resolution SEM images of E. coli on the nanostructures were observed. a, Close to 85% of the observed fields-of-view contained bacteria with significantly altered morphology indicating that the nanostructures disrupt bacterial shape and integrity possibly through localized stretching and stresses much like in high aspect ratio nanostructures reported in literature. b, The remaining 15% of the observed fields-of-view contained larger bacteria that maintained their shape despite marginal stretching clearly observed on their periphery. Scale 1 \u00b5m. Supplementary Figure S7 | Structural variation of the nanostructured Si3N4. 3D atomic force microscopic images of nanostructured Si3N4 templates with aspect-ratios ranging from 0.15 to 0.90. The aspect-ratio chosen for the nanostructured Si3N4-membrane and sensor is highlighted in red. Supplementary Figure S8 | Contact angle variation of the nanostructured Si3N4. The wetting properties of nanostructured Si3N4 templates with aspect-ratios ranging from 0.15 to 0.90 (n = 4 measurements). Unmodified flat Si3N4 (aspect-ratio = 0) is moderately hydrophilic. Through structuring, the hydrophobicity of nanostructured Si3N4 increased. The aspect-ratio chosen for the nanostructured Si3N4-membrane and sensor is highlighted in red. The experiment was conducted once. Error bars are given by the standard deviation about the mean. Supplementary Figure S9 | Simulated transmission profile of the flat and nanostructured Si3N4 membranes. The simulated transmission profile of the a, flat and b, nanostructured Si3N4 membranes are in good agreement with experimental transmittance measurements shown inFig. 3.The nanostructured Si3N4-membrane shows significant reduction in the angle dependence.Supplementary Figure S10 | Scattering effects of nanostructures on Si3N4-membrane. By gradually increasing the aspect ratio (height) of the nanostructures from 0 (i.e. flat membrane) to 0.45 in a FEM simulator using the exact geometry of the fabricated samples, a gradual increase in the total transmission is observed. Protein resistance of the nanostructured Si3N4 templates. The resistance against the adhesion of albumin and streptavidin was measured through intensity-based fluorescence microscopy (n = 12 representative images). Nanostructured Si3N4 templates with different aspect-ratios (0 -0.90) were studied. In both cases, a sharp decline in protein adhesion was observed upon structuring the Si3N4 (aspect-ratio \u2265 0.15). The protein adhesion on the flat Si3N4 (aspect-ratio = 0) was comparable to that of the positive control. The aspect-ratio of 0.45 chosen for use with an IOP-sensing implant is highlighted in red. The experiment was conducted once. Error bars are given by the standard deviation about the mean.Supplementary Figure S12 | Bacterial resistance of the nanostructured Si3N4 surface. Fluorescent micrographs of positive control, flat Si3N4, and nanostructured Si3N4 surfaces incubated for 4 hours in E. coli cultures transformed with green fluorescent protein (GFP)-expressing pFluoroGreen TM plasmid. Minimal bacterial adhesion is observed on the nanostructured Si3N4 surface compared to the flat Si3N4 and control surfaces. Scale bars, 100 \u00b5m. Supplementary Figure S13 | Bacterial adhesion as a function of fluorescence intensity. The average E. coli fluorescence intensity observed on the nanostructured Si3N4 surface was considerably lower than the flat Si3N4 surface (***P \u2264 0.001, one-way ANOVA with post-hoc Tukey test, s.d., n = 5 representative images). Adjustments were made for multiple comparisons. The experiment was replicated two times. Error bars are given by the standard deviation about the mean. Supplementary Figure S14 | SEM image of E. coli on the nanostructured Si3N4 surface. The nanostructures (circled in red) do not disrupt the shape of the cells (circled in white) and therefore do not induce physical lysis as seen in high aspect-ratio structures. Here, antifouling is achieved through anti-adhesion. Scale 1 \u00b5m. Supplementary Figure S15 | HeLa cell mortality ratio.

            "text": "Importance of nanoscale surface topology in anti-biofouling of the nanostructured Si3N4 surface. a, Contact angle vs. time elapsed after plasma treatment: flat Si3N4 surfaces were plasma-oxidised in order to lower their contact angles to values comparable to the nanostructured Si3N4 surface (n = 2 measurements). Plasma oxidation produced non-permanent enhanced hydrophilicity that dissipates in 24 hours. b, Bovine serum albumin (BSA) adhesion measured as a function of fluorescence intensity on untreated flat, plasma treated flat Si3N4 and nanostructured Si3N4 surfaces: in case of protein anti-adhesion, hydrophilicity plays a greater role than the nanotopology of the nanostructures (n = 12 representative images). c, E. coli adhesion measured as a function of fluorescence intensity after 4 hours of incubation (n = 3 representative images). d, HeLa cell density measured after 12 hours and 24 hours (n = 5 representative images). For cells, nanotopology plays a greater role as indicated by greater adhesion resistance offered by thenanostructured Si3N4 surface over the plasma treated Si3N4 surface of a similar contact angle. The experiment was conducted once. Error bars are given by the standard deviation about the mean. Supplementary Figure S18 | Fabrication process flow of the nanostructured IOP sensor. The top and bottom substrates are separately fabricated and later assembled together. Supplementary Figure S19 | IOP calculation from the sensor-reflected spectrum. a, microoptical IOP sensor implant schematic. The hermetically-sealed Fabry-Perot (FP) IOP sensor has two important surfaces: (1) a flexible deformable Si3N4-membrane serving as an optomechanical sensing element and forming the top surface of the FP-resonator; and (2) a reflective Si mirror-like surface that forms the bottom surface. The two surfaces are separated by a gap thereby forming an FP cavity. If IOP increases, the Si3N4-membrane deflects inwards, decreasing the cavity gap size. b,",
