One classification is based on cause (infectious and non-infectious diseases) while the second is based on effect (chronic and acute diseases). 1 Many chronic diseases have an infectious origin, such as cervical cancer (human papillomavirus -HPV) and liver cancer (hepatitis B and C viruses). Many patients with infectious diseases require long-term care. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection has become a chronic disease in many countries. 1 Furthermore, some chronic diseases have a short duration. Pancreatic cancer is called a chronic disease despite the fact that very few sufferers survive even 1 year. Finally, some non-infectious diseases, such as diabetic ketoacidosis and myocardial infarction, require acute care.",

Many chronic diseases are associated with behavioural risk factors. 2 Although these diseases are not themselves communicable, their behavioural risk factors (e.g. smoking, excess alcohol consumption, poor nutrition and physical inactivity 2 ) are readily transferable from one population to another, through international travel and modern communication. Unlike many infectious diseases, transmission of ''agents'' of chronic diseases does not even require physical contact. Ideas about smoking and physical inactivity can be transmitted globally and instantly, through satellite broadcasts and the internet.",
