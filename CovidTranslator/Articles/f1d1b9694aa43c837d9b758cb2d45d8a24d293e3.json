            "text": "Horizontal DNA transfer is an important factor of evolution and participates in biological diversity. Unfortunately, the location and length of horizontal transfers (HTs) are known for very few species. The usage of short oligonucleotides in a sequence (the so-called genomic signature) has been shown to be species-specific even in DNA fragments as short as 1 kb. The genomic signature is therefore proposed as a tool to detect HTs. Since DNA transfers originate from species with a signature different from those of the recipient species, the analysis of local variations of signature along recipient genome may allow for detecting exogenous DNA. The strategy consists in (i) scanning the genome with a sliding window, and calculating the corresponding local signature (ii) evaluating its deviation from the signature of the whole genome and (iii) looking for similar signatures in a database of genomic signatures. A total of 22 prokaryote genomes are analyzed in this way. It has been observed that atypical regions make up $6% of each genome on the average. Most of the claimed HTs as well as new ones are detected. The origin of putative DNA transfers is looked for among $12 000 species. Donor species are proposed and sometimes strongly suggested, considering similarity of signatures. Among the species studied, Bacillus subtilis, Haemophilus Influenzae and Escherichia coli are investigated by many authors and give the opportunity to perform a thorough comparison of most of the bioinformatics methods used to detect HTs.",

Their current diversity results from events that have modified genomes during evolution. While some of these events happen at the nucleotide level (point mutation, indel of few nucleotides), others [strand inversion, duplications, repetitions, transpositions and horizontal transfers (HTs)] may concern significant parts of the genome. It has been postulated that HTs (exchange of genetic material between two different species) were very frequent during the first stages of evolution and are essentially subsisting nowadays in prokaryotes (1) (2) (3) (4) . As a consequence, the detection of HTs appears crucial to the understanding of the evolutionary processes and to the qualitative and quantitative evaluation of exchange rate between species (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) .",

            "text": "Genes from a given species are very similar to one another with respect to base composition, codon biases and short oligonucleotide composition (15, 16, (22) (23) (24) . As a general rule, usage of oligonucleotides varies less along genomes than among genomes (24) (25) (26) (27) . In addition, it has been observed that transferred DNA retains (at least for some time) characteristics from its species of origin (8, 14) . These particularities are used alone or in conjunction to detect DNA transfers between species (8, 12, 13) . Transferred DNA is consequently detected on the basis of some of its singularities with respect to the sequence characteristics of the recipient species. However, these techniques suffer several drawbacks and weaknesses (28) (29) (30) that led us to consider generalizing the above approach for the screening of atypical regions in sequences. In fact, the genomic signature that accounts for all possible biases in DNA sequences has been shown to be speciesspecific (26, 27, 31, 32) . The signature is approximately invariant along the genome in such a way that the species of origin of DNA segments as small as 1 kb could be identified with a surprisingly high efficiency by means of their signatures (25, 27) . As a consequence, the sequence signature may be most often (at least in bacteria) considered a valuable estimation of the genomic signature. Assuming that (i) transferred DNA fragments exhibit signature of the species they come from and (ii) recipient and donor signatures are different, the screening of local variations of signature along genomes is expected to reveal regions of interest where HTs might be located. In addition, the status of HT is strongly suggested if the signatures of these regions of interest are found close to the signature of other species.",

Genomes are consequently sampled by means of a sliding window with an appropriate size. In fact, it would be interesting to have windows the smallest as possible for highest sampling accuracy. However, intra-genomic variability of signature increases for small windows. In addition, variability depends on species and word length. Base composition (1-letter word), 2-and 3-letter words are poorly speciesspecific: they do not allow a good discrimination between species (25, 27) . As a general rule, the longer the words (up to 9-letter long), the higher the specificity of the signature (25, 27, 31) . However, counts of long words in small windows are too low to allow a reliable estimation of the parameters. In our hands, the analysis of 4-letter words in a sliding window of 5 kb (with a 0.5 kb step) offers a good trade-off between reliability of count, file size and computational charge, whatever the species. In addition, a double-strand signature (called local signature thereafter) is computed for each window to get rid of variations induced by strand asymmetry (38) (39) (40) (41) (42) .",

Although the vast majority of local signatures look mostly the same (believed to be instances of the recipient species signature), some of them may greatly differ. In order to avoid potential biases linked to these outliers, it has been subsequently decided to select typical local signatures on the basis of their similarities, observed after clustering. The underlying idea is that typical local signatures aggregate in few large groups, whereas outliers are found in small complementary groups at a great distance from the recipient genome signature. Groups were consequently determined with the K-means clustering tool, using every scheme of clusters between 3 and 8 for each species. Finally, the best scheme of clusters was obtained by a decision tree-based partition [CART algorithm (43) ]. The purpose of the CART algorithm is to predict values of a categorical dependent variable (clusters of local signatures in this work, each signature being characterized by its distance to the estimated genomic signature) from one or more continuous and/or categorical predictor variables [the different clustering schemes (3-8 clusters) in this work]. The CART algorithm thus provides an optimal split between groups collecting signatures close to the estimated recipient genome signature and the others groups. For each species, a clustering scheme is selected (e.g. the 5-group clustering) and a partition offered (continued example: group 2 and 3 on one side; 1, 4 and 5 on the other). The recipient species signature is subsequently calculated as the mean of the signatures of the groups belonging to the partition with the smallest distance to the estimated genomic signature.",

All distances in a high dimension space seem to be comparable since they increase with the square root of the dimension of the space, whereas the variance of their distribution remains unchanged. In fact, the radius of the hyper sphere holding 99% of the signatures of our database is only seven times the nearest neighbor distance (smallest distance between two species). Small differences in distance may consequently be considered highly significant.",

Most signatures from minority clusters are detected in this way. Isolated signatures are detected as well, while very few signatures from the recipient species clusters are selected (1%).

In fact, a high cutoff distance takes place in species that display a high intragenomic variability, also expressed by a high mean distance to the host (Table 1) .

Distances of outlier from first potential donor often fall within the intra-genomic range ( However, in some instances, the outlier-to-donor distance is too great to consider the 'closest' species as potential donor. In contrast, unusual small values deserve a specific attention. In particular, the very small distance between bacteriophage SPBc2 and '2150751-2285750' atypical region (d = 2) allows to spot the part of B.subtilis genome where bacteriophage SPBc2 is incorporated (12, 47) . Other regions in the genome are also found similar (in terms of signature) to bacteriophage SPBc2. Most of them correspond to bacteriophages, imbedded in B.subtilis genome, whose free forms are not sequenced (12, 47) . Observed similarities with SPBC2 are, however, expected since signatures of phages usually share some characteristics with the species they infect (48) . The SPBc2 sequence is the only foreign sequence identified in B.subtilis, using homology as criterion (BlastN, with parameters set to default). In fact, Blast analysis of B.subtilis outliers leads to contrasted results. Besides SPBc2 and 7 out of 9 prophages imbedded in the genome, the only atypical regions identified are those containing the 30 rRNA genes coded in B.subtilis genome. The only few genes that are homologous to parts of atypical regions are found in species belonging to the Bacillus genus. It is interesting to note that no house-keeping genes (except rRNA) are detected in atypical regions.

About 50% of atypical regions are less than (or around) 2.5 kb long. Numbers for H.influenzae are clearly at variance with those for B.subtilis: a smaller percentage of the genome qualifies as atypical and the average size of atypical regions is also smaller. This result is examined below in the context of intra-species signature variability (see Discussion).",

            "text": "Numerous approaches for detecting horizontal gene transfers have been proposed in the last 2 decades. Phylogenetic trees of protein or DNA sequences, unusual distribution of genes, nucleotide composition (including codon biases) are some of the HT features that are considered within the framework of these models (16, 34) , Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) (12, 14, 35) and Factorial Correspondence Analysis (FCA) (37) are some criteria that are currently employed. Each of the resulting models has its own advantages and caveats (28) (29) (30) . As it has been recently pointed out by Ragan (49) and Lawrence and Ochman (50) , each approach deals with a particular subset of HTs, being for example more efficient for detecting recent transfers, or more effective for the detection of ancient HTs. Our approach, which is clearly based on oligonucleotide composition, assumes that different species have different signatures but does not rely on any other assumption. It is not surprising, therefore, that the genomic signature approach provides results (in terms of % of DNA transferred) in reasonable agreement with those proposed by Garcia-Vallve (16) and Nakamura et al. (14) for the 22 species that were analyzed in common. Correlations between percentages of HTs found by these three methods are highly significant Two species are extensively studied for HT content: B.subtilis (five methods including ours) and E.coli (six methods including ours). H.influenzae is also analyzed by Garcia-Vallve (16) and Nakamura (14) . Comparisons of methods are presented in Tables 2-4 and detailed in Supplementary Materials 3, 5 and 7. A voting procedure (majority rule) has been implemented to determine the status of genes with respect to atypicality. For that task, our initial analysis is converted in terms of genes (Supplementary Materials 3, 5 and 7). Degree of agreement between methods is subsequently observed using the statistical Kappa coefficient (51) . Kappa measures the degree of agreement on a scale from minus infinity to 1. A Kappa of one indicates full agreement, a Kappa of zero indicates that there is no more agreement than expected by chance and negative values are observed if agreement is weaker than expected by chance (a very rare situation). (14, 13, 11, 13 and 15%, respectively). The number of detected genes per method is close, ranging from 457 for Nakamura (14) to 599 for this work (median 537). Detailed votes are given in Table 2 . Among the 4100 genes of B.subtilis genome, 1011 genes are detected by at least one method (about 25% of B.subtilis genes). The number of 'single vote' genes ranges from 116 for Garcia-Vallve (16) to 47 for Nicolas (12) . A total of 470 genes make up the majority consensus set and we detected 453 of them, which is the best score of the five methods. The best agreement with the majority consensus (in terms of Kappas) is reached by Nicolas (12), followed by our method and Moszer (36) ( Table 2 ). Our method gets the best agreement with Nicolas (12) and the worst with the other HMM method used by Nakamura (14) (pairwise Kappa comparison, Table 2 and Supplementary Material 3). In fact, Nakamura approach is at variance with every other approach (14) . It gets the lowest Kappa with the Garcia-Vallve (16) Hayes (35) Lawrence (34) Nakamura (14) Medigue (49) This work majority consensus or with whatever other methods. From Table 2 , the probable number of HT genes in B.subtilis would range from 230 to 1011 with a 'reasonable' estimation around 470 corresponding to the majority consensus. It is to be noted that our method is unable to find two genes that are detected by every other methods (Supplementary Material 3) . These genes are 338 and 236 nt long, respectively, as compared with 2500 nt, the median size of atypical regions detected by our method (Table 1) . Clearly, our method is not appropriate for detecting short isolated atypical genes.",

Meanwhile, the percentage of outliers as reported by our approach rises to 20% and the percentage of 'single vote' genes reaches 24%. As expected, a high cut-off distance provides few single vote genes at the risk of missing some potentially transferred genes. Lowering the cut-off increases the proportion of single vote genes with the advantage of detecting most of the potential transfers (Supplementary Material 7) .

In fact, outliers meeting the first criterion generally aggregate into several heterogeneous clusters (K-means clustering) that usually include samples from each strain/species. In some instances, however, some strains/species were absent from the cluster. It was subsequently considered that the corresponding regions might have been recently acquired by the relevant strains/ species. Table 5 shows a selection of potential recently transferred genes.

It is to be noticed that the method allows detecting several atypical non-coding regions (Supplementary Materials 3, 5 and 7). One major difference between HMM and signature method lies beyond the time required for the learning process, in the few resources that HMM can mobilize to deal with a short 'one of its kind' HT.

With the help of environmental considerations, it is subsequently possible to identify (or collect clues about) potential donors. The search for donor makes use of non-homologous sequences. Partially sequenced species become consequently eligible, inasmuch 1.5 kb of the genome is available (25, 27) . Thanks to the exponentially growing rate of nucleotide databanks, the search for donor species by means of the sequence signature will turn more and more pertinent and fruitful in the future. In this context, it is worth noticing that computational power is clearly not an issue since the CGR algorithm described in this paper is fast and of 0 order (calculation time is proportional to the number of nucleotides).",
