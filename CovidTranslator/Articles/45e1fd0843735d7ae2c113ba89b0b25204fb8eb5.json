            "text": "After insertion of polypeptides into, or translocation across the membrane of the ER, some polypeptides remain in that organelle as resident proteins, while others are transported to distal compartments of the endomembrane system. If they reach the plasma membrane and lack a membrane anchor they are released into the extracellular space by exocytosis. The maintenance of the characteristic protein composition of the organelles that comprise the secretory pathway requires that their proteins possess localization signals that determine their site of accumulation. The concentration in the ER of certain proteins that tend to escape from this organelle is assured by mechanisms that involve their retrieval from post-ER compartments, while other ER constituents are actually prevented from leaving the organelle (Sabatini and Adesnik, 1995; Teasdale and Jackson, 1996) . The retrieval from a post ER compartment of escaped luminal ER proteins carrying a Cterminal KDEL-type motif is effected by a well characterized receptor, which resides in the Golgi apparatus when not carrying a ligand (Munro and Pelham, 1987; Lewis and Pelham, 1992) . Similarly, some type I membrane proteins that may escape the ER have two critical lysine residues in positions -3 and -4 or -5 relative to their carboxyl termini (Jackson et al., 1990 (Jackson et al., , 1993 that constitute a signal recognized by coat proteins that function in the formation of vesicles that mediate retrograde transport from the Golgi apparatus to the ER (Letourneur et al., 1994; Fiedler et al., 1996; Cosson et al., 1996; Cosson and Letourneur, 1997) . Some ER type II transmembrane proteins contain a cytoplasmically exposed N-terminal double-arginine motif that also serves as a retrieval signal (Schutze et al., 1994) . Several mechanisms can lead to retention of proteins that do not have identifiable retrieval signals. Misfolded or incompletely folded proteins in the ER lumen may interact with chaperones, such as BiP, calnexin or PDI, which themselves have retrieval signals (Teasdale and Jackson, 1996; Leitzgen and Haas, 1998; Degen and Williams, 1991; Bergeron et al., 1994) . Retention of ER membrane proteins may also be achieved by functional interactions of their luminal domains with an organized matrix of luminal ER proteins, or by interaction of their cytoplasmic domains with cytoskeletal elements, such as microtubules (Dahll\u00f6f et al., 1991) . Another mechanism that may lead to retention of membrane proteins would entail their incorporation into oligomeric complexes or even larger assemblies that cannot be included in carrier vesicles that leave the organelle. Such macromolecular assemblies have been described and they involve components of the translocation apparatus in the ER, including the oligosaccharyltransferase (OST) complex that catalyzes the N-glycosylation of nascent polypeptides (Sabatini and Adesnik, 1995; Kreibich et al., 1978a, b; Hortsch and Meyer, 1985; Wiedemann et al., 1989; Sitia and Meldolesi, 1992; G\u00f6rlich et al., 1992) . Similar macromolecular assemblies have been implicated in the retention of membrane proteins in individual Golgi stacks (Swift and Machamer, 1991; Machamer, 1991; Munro, 1991; Nilsson et al., 1991, Nilsson and Warren, 1994) .",

The ribophorins are transmembrane glycoproteins that were originally identified as the first markers for the rough portions of ER membranes (Kreibich et al., 1978a, b) . They were later shown to be subunits of the OST complex responsible for transferring a preassembled oligosaccharide from a membrane bound lipid donor to an acceptor asparagine residue within a nascent polypeptide (Kelleher et al., 1992) . RI and OST48, and probably also RII, have a type I transmembrane disposition, whereas Dad1 apparently has a U-loop disposition (Makishima et al., 1997) . We have recently shown that the luminal domain of OST48 interacts with those of RI and RII and that the cytoplasmic domain of OST48 has affinity for the cytoplasmically exposed N-terminal tail of Dad1 (Fu et al., 1997) . Furthermore, the OST complex interacts directly with Sec61p, the core component of the protein translocation apparatus that constitutes the translocation channel (G\u00f6rlich et al., 1992) and also provides sites for ribosome binding (Kalies et al., 1994) .",

            "text": "Results obtained over many years have demonstrated that components of the translocation apparatus, including those involved in the cotranslational modification of newly synthesized polypeptides, are part of a proteinaceous network that confines these membrane proteins to the rough domain of the ER (Kreibich et al., 1978a, b; Hortsch and Meyer, 1985; Marcantonio et al., 1984; Amar-Costesec et al., 1984) . Incorporation of proteins into this network was suggested to be an effective means of preventing their exit from the ER towards the Golgi apparatus (Sabatini and Adesnik, 1995; Kreibich et al., 1978a, b; Hortsch and Meyer, 1985; Sitia and Meldolesi, 1992) . Because newly synthesized components forming such a putative network do not become immediately incorporated into the oligomeric complex, and yet do not escape from the ER Ivessa et al., 1992) we hypothesize that individual subunits themselves carry ER localization motifs that guarantee their retention until they are assembled into the network. While OST48 contains a typical dilysine retrieval motif at the C-terminal -3 and -5 positions, no retrieval motifs can be recognized in RI, RII and Dad1. In this study, we searched for ER localization domains in RII and found that retention information is contained independently in the cytoplasmic domain and in a region encompassing the transmembrane domain together with a short luminal flanking segment.",

            "text": "The primary sequence of this glycoprotein, derived from the corresponding cDNA (Pirozzi et al., 1991; Crimaudo et al., 1987) , reveals that the nascent polypeptide contains a cleavable amino terminal signal sequence. This results in the ERtranslocation and the N-glycosylation of the large amino terminal domain (516 residues). The putative transmembrane domain consists of 23 highly hydrophobic amino acids and it has an average hydrophobicity of 1.9, which is typical of polypeptide sequences expected to traverse the membrane in an alpha-helical conformation (Kyte and Doolittle, 1982) ( Fig. 1 ; see also Fig. 2 ). The C-terminal portion of RII (aa 540 to 609) contains two additional weakly hydrophobic regions (aa 553 to 572 and 584 to 600) with average hydrophobicities of only 1.3 and 1.4, respectively, that cannot be regarded as potential membrane anchors (Kyte and Doolittle, 1982) . It would appear, therefore, that RII, like RI, has a type I membrane disposition. Nevertheless, the cytoplasmic exposure of the C-terminal 70 amino acid segment of RII has not been clearly demonstrated. Indeed, previous studies (Crimaudo et al., 1987) with canine pancreatic rough microsomes (RM) found RII to be remarkably resistant to digestion with proteases. We found, however, that if the microsomes are first stripped of ribosomes by a pretreatment with K -acetate and EDTA, digestion with proteinase K leads to the production of a 55 kDa protected fragment of RII that corresponds in size to a RII molecule from which the cytoplasmic domain has been removed (Fig. 3, lane b) . In accord with previous findings (Crimaudo et al., 1987) , we also found that, when digestion was carried out in the presence of Triton X-100, a small amount (30% compared with that in lane b) of a fragment of about 52 kDa (Fig. 3, lane d) was generated, which apparently corresponds to the amino terminal luminal domain of the protein which is at least partially resistant to proteolysis. The luminal protein BiP was completely resistant to proteolytic digestion, unless detergent was added to dissolve the membranes (Fig. 3 , compare lanes f and h). We will refer to this segment (aa 540 to 609) as the cytoplasmic domain of RII, although we cannot rule out completely the possibility that the two moderately hydrophobic domains in the 70 amino acid Cterminal region of RII interact with the lipid bilayer. In order to identify which domains within RII contribute to its retention in the ER we transfected HeLa cells with chimeric constructs in which one or more domains of RII were replaced by the corresponding domains of the Tac antigen, which is the alpha subunit of the interleukin-2 receptor (Leonard et al., 1984) . The Tac antigen is a type I transmembrane protein of 222 J. Fu, G. Pirozzi et al. EJCB Fig. 2 . The hydropathy plot of the C-terminal region of RII. The Cterminal portion of RII (aa 485 \u00b1 609) was subjected to hydropathy analysis according to Kyte and Doolittle (1982) . Arrows define the three hydrophobic regions. The numbers above the arrows correspond to the amino acid numbers that define the borders of these regions, while the numbers under the arrows represent the average hydrophobicity within this region. Fig. 3 . Western blot analysis of ribophorin II in protease-treated microsomes. Rough microsomes stripped of ribosomes by treatment with EDTA and K acetate (Walter and Blobel, 1983) were incubated on ice for 2 h without added protease (lanes a, c, e, g) or in the presence of 0.2 mg/ml proteinase K (lanes b, d, f, h). Samples in lanes c, d, g, h received, in addition, Triton X-100 at a final concentration of 0.5%. Each reaction was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting with an antibody against RII (lanes a \u00b1 d). The blot was then stripped and reprobed with an antibody against BiP (lanes e \u00b1 h). Molecular masses of marker proteins (in kDa) are shown on the right. 251 amino acids, with a short cytoplasmic domain of 13 amino acids (see also Fig. 1 ). Because the Tac antigen lacks intrinsic ER retention or retrieval signals and, when expressed in transfected cells, is rapidly and efficiently transported from the ER to the plasma membrane (Leonard et al., 1984) , portions of this protein have frequently been used to construct chimeras in which they provide a neutral framework for the identification of sorting signals (Cosson et al., 1991; Manolios et al., 1990; Bonifacino et al., 1990a, b) . Schematic representations of RII-Tac chimeras used in this work are shown in Fig. 1 . The legend also explains the abbreviations used to designate these constructs.",

Because of the limiting amounts of endogenous OST subunits in the transfected cells, most of the overexpressed RII polypeptides are not expected to be integrated into the hetero-oligomeric OST complex. The efficient retention of the unassembled RII, as indicated by the absence of cell surface immunofluorescence (Fig. 4c) , suggests that this OST subunit may contain one or more intrinsic ER localization signals. In contrast to cells expressing the full-length RII, immunolabeling of non-permeabilized cells expressing the luminal domain of this OST subunit (II.-.-) showed a punctate surface labeling, which is likely to correspond to secreted molecules that were retained in intercellular pockets near the sites of exocytosis at the plasma membrane (Fig. 4e) . Immunolabeling after permeabilization showed not only the characteristic ER reticular staining pattern, but also an increased labeling in the perinuclear region of the transfected cells, as would be expected for II.-.molecules which traverse the Golgi apparatus (Fig. 4f) .",

Therefore, the behavior of a chimeric protein (II.T.T; see Fig. 1 ) was assessed, consisting of the complete luminal domain of RII fused to the transmembrane (19 amino acids) and cytoplasmic domain (13 amino acids: Thr-Trp-Gln-Arg-Arg-Gln-Arg-Lys-Ser-Arg-Arg-Thr-Ile) of the Tac antigen. Immunofluorescence analysis showed that the II.T.T chimera exited from the Golgi apparatus and reached the plasma membrane, where it could be labeled in non-permeabilized cells (Fig. 4g) . In permeabilized cells, a significant fraction of the II.T.T chimera localized to vesicular structures as indicated by the pronounced punctate labeling pattern that suggest accumulation of the protein in lysosomes (Fig. 4h) . Double immunofluorescence experiments labeling both RII (Fig. 4i ) and the lysosomal membrane protein LAMP-2 (Fig. 4j) demonstrated that a large fraction of the chimera indeed accumulated in sites that contain the lysosomal marker.",

In addition to the N-glycosylated (II.II.II), and non-glycosylated forms (II.II.II*) of the endogenous RII (see also lane a), three additional polypeptides were obtained when cell lysates were immuneprecipitated with anti-RII antibody (Fig. 5, lane c) : a diffuse band of lower electrophoretic mobility (II.T.T 0 ; M r $ 72 kDa) and two sharp bands of higher electrophoretic mobility (II.T.T; M r $ 60 kDa and II.T.T*; Mr $ 51 kDa). The band corresponding to II.T.T was sensitive to Endo H (Fig. 5, compare lanes c  and d) indicating that it possessed a high-mannose oligosaccharide and had not yet exited from the ER. In contrast, the modified chimeric polypeptide (II.T.T 0 ) was resistant to Endo H (Fig. 5, lane d) but sensitive to endo F (II.T.T 0 *, Fig. 5 , lane e) and, therefore, had reached the medial region of the Golgi apparatus. The observation that even after Endo F digestion the modified polypeptide (II.T.T 0 *) migrated as a diffuse band of lower electrophoretic mobility compared with II.T.T*, suggested that, in addition to an N-linked oligosaccharide, it may also contain O-linked sugar residues. This was confirmed by treatment of the immunoprecipitate with neuraminidase and O-glycosidase, which shifted most of the radioactivity into a band corresponding to II.T.T that carries only an N-linked oligosaccharide (lane f). Additional digestion with N-glycosidase F (lane g) resulted in the accumulation of the radioactivity in the band corresponding to the deglycosylated form (II.T.T*). Since constructs which contain only the luminal domain of RII exit freely from the ER we conclude that this part of the molecule folds properly and binding of chaperones to the luminal domain plays no role in the retention of RII in the ER.",

On the other hand, cells expressing T.II.T showed intense ER staining (Fig. 6D ) and only about 20% of them showed also rather faint surface labeling (Fig. 6C) . These observations suggest that the transmembrane domain of RII contains a retention signal, although it is unable to retain all the chimeric molecules in the ER. The rather efficient retention of T.II.T in the ER is strikingly demonstrated by the fact that after a 30 min pulse and 3 h chase period the chimeric molecules remain fully Endo H sensitive (Fig. 7, lanes g and h) , in striking contrast to the Tac antigen (T.T.T) itself, which during the same chase period becomes almost fully Endo H resistant (Fig. 7, lanes c and d) . Thus, although the surface fluorescence of non-permeabilized cells revealed that a significant amount of the chimeric protein (T.II.T) reached the cell surface (see Fig. 6C ), the fraction of the total T.II.T molecules synthesized during the pulse period that exits from the ER is biochemically undetectable and corresponds to less than 5% of the labelled proteins.",

It appears, therefore, that although the luminal domain of RII by itself does not contain a detectable ER localization signal (Figs. 4 and 5), it nonetheless augments the retention activity of the transmembrane domain (compare Fig. 6C and E) . A similar localization enhancement function has been previously demonstrated for short luminal portions adjacent to the transmembrane domain of some Golgi enzymes (Machamer, 1991; Nilsson and Warren, 1994; Munro, 1995; Colley et al., 1992) . As was suggested for the Golgi membrane proteins the short luminal segment of RII may serve to properly position the transmembrane domain within the lipid bilayer of the ER, which may enhance the retention capacity of the transmembrane domain [26] . We therefore expressed several T.II.T-related chimera in which the RII transmembrane domain was preceded by juxtamembranous luminal RII regions of decreasing length. The chimeric polypeptide containing a 15 amino acid segment of the luminal domain (aa 502\u00b1516 ) in addition to the RII transmembrane domain was totally excluded from the cell surface and only detectable in the ER (Fig. 6H ). This demonstrates that the transmembrane domain of RII together with a short luminal flanking region serves as an efficient ER retention motif. ",

In addition, we show that both the cytoplasmic and transmembrane domains of RII independently contain ER retention information but, in order to be totally effective in mediating retention, the transmembrane domain must be accompanied by a short contiguous sequence of 15 amino acids from the luminal domain. Our observations, therefore, support the notion that the individual subunits that compose the oligomeric OST complex contain separate retention motifs, despite the fact that the function of these motifs may no longer be required after the polypeptides are integrated into the functional OST.",

It was suggested that their incorporation into a large proteinaceous network within the ER membranes provide a mechanism that not only prevents the individual polypeptides from entering the smooth domains of the ER but also is responsible for the flattened cisternal morphology characteristic of rough ER membranes. Incorporation into a protein network within the rough ER membrane would also be expected to prevent resident ER polypeptides from entering vesicular carriers in which proteins destined for distal regions of the endomembrane system are transported. It also seems likely that the generation of vesicles by budding, which requires a pliable membrane, would be impeded by the presence of a rigid proteinaceous network in areas of the rough ER. In contrast to the OST and the components of the translocation apparatus (Kreibich et al., 1978a, b; Hortsch and Meyer, 1985; Wiedemann et al., 1989; Sitia and Meldolesi, 1992; G\u00f6rlich et al., 1992; Kelleher and Gilmore, 1997; Kelleher et al., 1992; Hartman et al., 1993) , other ER membrane proteins that participate in general metabolic functions, such as members of the electron transport chains that include cytochrome P450 and b5, are apparently not part of the RER-specific proteinaceous network and are found in both rough and smooth portions of the organelle (Teasdale and Jackson, 1996; Sitia and Meldolesi, 1992; Kreibich et al., 1983; Szczesna-Skorupa et al., 1994) . Although the retention mechanism for these proteins has not been characterized, it is possible that these proteins are also part of higher order complexes that result in their retention in the ER.",

Since we have shown that the luminal domains of both RI and RII interact with that of OST48 (Fu et al., 1997) , a conceivable explanation for the retention of newly synthesized ribophorins in the ER would have been that they simply associate with OST48. Such a piggy-back retention mechanism cannot account for the localization of newly synthesized ribophorins in the ER, since we have shown that the ribophorins remain in the ER even when overexpressed and produced at levels far higher than that of endogenous OST48. Moreover, a variant of OST48 in which the two lysine residues close to the C-terminus are replaced by serine \u00b1 which allows this OST48 variant to be efficiently transported to the cell surface \u00b1 does not lead to the concomitant exit of endogenous ribophorins from the ER (Fu and Kreibich, unpublished observations) . In fact, coexpression of RI or RII with the OST48 variant results in their complete retention in the ER. This finding supports the presence of independent retention information in the ribophorin polypeptides.",

These chaperones, which may be involved in the assembly of the oligomeric OST, themselves contain retrieval signals that assure that their ligands are available in the ER for the assembly of the oligomers (Teasdale and Jackson, 1996) . Interaction with ER chaperones may, in fact, be the mechanism for retention of a truncated form of ribophorin I that consists only of the luminal domain of the protein . It is clear, however, that the interaction of chaperones with the luminal domain of RII cannot be responsible for retention of the protein in the ER, since we found that, when synthesized as a truncated polypeptide or as part of a chimera \u00b1 h) , and T.T.II (lanes i \u00b1 l) were pulse labeled and chased for 0 or 3 h.

While most of T.T.T acquire Endo H resistance after a chase period of 3 h (lanes c and d), T.II.T (lanes g and h) or T.T.II (lanes k and l) were still sensitive to Endo H.",

Indeed, we found that the II.T.T chimera was degraded with a T 1/2 of 2 h and that this degradation was prevented by leupeptin, a well known lysosomal protease inhibitor (Pirozzi and Kreibich, unpublished results) . We do not yet have information on the route followed by this chimera to reach the lysosomal compartment after its processing in the Golgi apparatus. Some lysosomal membrane proteins, like lgp120 are delivered directly from the Golgi apparatus to lysosomes (Hart and Mellman, 1992) , while other proteins are known to reach the lysosome only after they are delivered to the plasma membrane and then internalized by endocytosis (Mellman, 1996) . No internalization signal has been demonstrated in the a-subunit of the IL-2 receptor (for review see Mellman, 1996) . The two possible routes to the lysosome are not mutually exclusive and a combination of the two may account for the transport of II.T.T to lysosomes. However, the indirect route involving passage through the plasma membrane should be a minor one, since in a pulse chase experiment we found no measurable levels of labeled chimera at the cell surface, as indicated by its susceptibility to protease digestion.",
