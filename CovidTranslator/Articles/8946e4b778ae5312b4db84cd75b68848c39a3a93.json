We evaluated the utility of the FRIDU during 1 year of operation. We analyzed 1,562 patients who were hospitalized after FRIDU screening between August 2015 and July 2016. The level of isolation recommended during their screening at the FRIDU was compared with the level deemed appropriate given their final diagnosis. Of the 1,562 patients screened at the FRIDU, 198 (13%) were isolated, 194 (12%) were reverse isolated, and 1,170 (75%) were not isolated. While hospitalized, 97 patients (6%) were confirmed to have a contagious disease requiring isolation, such as tuberculosis; 207 patients (13%) were confirmed to be immunocompromised and to require reverse isolation, mainly due to neutropenia; and the remaining 1,258 patients (81%) did not require isolation. The correlation coefficient for isolation consistency was 0.565 (P < 0.001). The sensitivity and negative predictive value of FRIDU screening for diagnosing contagious disease requiring isolation are 76% and 98%, respectively. No serious nosocomial outbreaks of contagious diseases occurred. During FRIDU screening, 114 patients were admitted to the resuscitation zone due to clinical instability, and three of these patients died. The initial isolation levels resulting from FRIDU screening were moderately well correlated with the isolation levels required by the final diagnosis, demonstrating the utility of pre-hospitalization screening units. However, the risks of deterioration during the screening process remain challenges.",

After the 2015 outbreak of fatal MERS-CoV at our institution (5, 14) , a febrile respiratory infectious disease unit (FRIDU) with a negative pressure ventilation system was separately constructed outside the ED; to prevent the spread of contagious diseases within the hospital, this unit triages and determines isolation levels for all emergency patients prior to their admission to the ED or hospital. However, data on the utility of such screening units are limited. We compared patients' initial FRIDU-determined isolation level with the level associated with their final diagnosis and assessed the limitations of the screening system. We hope this study will help efforts to integrate isolation strategies into ED contagious disease management procedures.",

When a patient was determined to be clinically deteriorated at the FRIDU, the patient was moved to the resuscitation zone equipped with a portable negative pressure ventilation system or isolated in a single room with a door in the ED. After FRIDU screening, patients were categorized according to the following three isolation levels based on the attending ED physician's diagnosis: 1) suspected of having a contagious disease requiring isolation (e.g., patients with influenza or pulmonary tuberculosis), 2) immunocompromised status requiring reverse isolation (e.g., patients with neutropenia), or 3) not requiring isolation (e.g., patients with a urinary tract infection). After the initial diagnostic work up, some patients requiring hospitalization were directly admitted from the FRIDU without entering the ED; some were hospitalized or discharged after entering the ED and receiving additional medical examinations; and some were discharged, referred elsewhere, or followed by the outpatient clinic without entering the ED or being hospitalized.",

Patients who were diagnosed with contagious diseases were more likely to have a transplant history, but, oddly, they were less likely to have fever or leukocytosis. These results imply that commonly used clinical parameters, such as fever or leukocytosis, may not be enough to accurately discriminate between contagious and non-infectious diseases. In our study, only 62 of 97 (64%) patients with a contagious disease had a fever and 89 (92%) had leukocytosis. Both of these proportions were significantly lower than those for the remaining patients with non-contagious diseases (P = 0.031 for fever, P = 0.008 for leukocytosis). However, a more general interpretation of these findings is limited in that our institution is one of the largest tertiary-referral centers in Korea, and our patients generally have relatively severe or complicated conditions. There have been very few studies conducted on pre-hospital triage. During the 2009 influenza pandemic, an influenza-like illness scoring system was used to triage 1,840 ED patients with acute respiratory illness treated at a Mexican hospital (17) . In a study conducted in Qatar, a surveillance system protocol reduced the number of patients who needed to be tested for MERS-CoV at an ED (18) . However, to date, no data on the utility of screening systems outside the ED of tertiary medical centers have been collected at the pre-hospitalization stage, especially https://doi.org/10.3346/jkms.2017.32. 9.1534 for all emergency center patients; thus, our study is unique and significant.",

The greatest concern was that some patients deteriorated during FRIDU screening, and 3 of the 114 patients who were moved to the resuscitation zone during our study period died in the ED. Although the medical facilities in the FRIDU are well established, special medical resources, such as computed tomography, were not available or applied late, and the screening process is focused on contagious diseases; hence, critically ill patients are at risk of clinical deterioration during the screening process.",

During the study period, an average of 12 patients were screened daily in the FRIDU, which means that the screening process was activated every 2 hours, and the FRI-DU required staffing 24 hours a day. For these reasons, the ideal tertiary hospital ED isolation system still may not be enoughalthough most hospitals are still far from the ideal. A study conducted in the United Kingdom in 2007 found that only 24% of 203 hospitals reviewed had isolation facilities available in the ED (19) . A recent evaluation of 48 infectious disease isolation facilities in 16 European countries found that only 18 facilities fulfilled the definition of a high-level isolation unit, and only 34 had all essential equipment for negative pressure (20) . Given that disasters such as the recent outbreak in Korea (5) can affect not only public health but the economy (6), we believe that a more efficient screening process is needed.",

First, the screening criteria for contagious diseases were not validated, especially regarding the definition of fever, which was very low ( \u2265 37.5\u00b0C). Second, mainly due to the retrospective design, we could not evaluate the degree to which the screening system was more effective than the previous system at preventing nosocomial outbreaks. Third, we analyzed just patients who were hospitalized after screening, so we could not know final diagnosis of the patients such as discharged, referred or followed by the outpatient clinic. Forth, our study population was not representative in terms of baseline clinical characteristics, such as comorbidity, because our study was conducted at a large tertiary-referral center.",

However, the problems of clinical deterioration during screening and the financial and personnel costs remain. Therefore, further system-level stu-dies on triage strategy are needed. ",
