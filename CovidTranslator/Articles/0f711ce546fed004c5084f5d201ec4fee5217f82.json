To identify novel centromere protein (CENP) targets of anticentromere antibodies (ACA), and to investigate their association with clinical manifestations of systemic sclerosis (SSc). Methods. A CENP-focused protein microarray was fabricated by spotting 14 purified CENP. These microarrays were individually incubated with 35 ACA-positive SSc sera and 20 ACA-negative healthy control samples. Newly identified CENP autoantigens with high sensitivities were selected for validation and characterization. Results. Statistical analysis revealed 11 CENP are potential target antigens of ACA in patients with SSc. Of them, 5 [CENP-P, CENP-Q, CENP-M (isoform I), CENP-J, and CENP-T] are novel, among which CENP-P and CENP-Q showed high sensitivities in ACA-positive SSc sera of 34.3% and 28.6%, respectively. Subsequently, 186 SSc sera (35 ACA-positives and 151 negatives), 69 ACA-positive sera from other various autoimmune diseases (primary Sj\u00f6gren syndrome, systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, and primary biliary cirrhosis), and 31 healthy sera were assayed for the presence of anti-CENP-P and -Q autoantibodies by ELISA followed by Western blotting analysis. CENP-P and -Q autoantibodies were detected in ACA-positive sera of various disease groups; among them, SSc showed the highest detection rate. Anti-CENP-P was also found in 9 of the 151 ACA-negative sera. Analyses of the correlation with clinical information showed anti-CENP-P-positive patients had higher levels of IgG, IgA, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate among the ACA-positive cohort and were more vulnerable to renal disease in the ACA-negative patients with SSc. Regardless of ACA status, anti-CENP-P or Q-negative patients seem to be predominantly affected by interstitial lung disease. Conclusion. CENP-P and CENP-Q were identified as novel ACA autoantigens by CENP microarray assays followed by validation of ELISA and Western blotting. Both of them have prognostic utility for interstitial lung disease. CENP-P was associated with renal disease in an ACA-negative cohort.",

The IIF pattern normally shows discrete speckled nucleoplasmic staining in HEp-2 cells at the interphase and distinct centromeric dots that are visible for each chromosome pair in the metaphase plate. ACA have been repeatedly demonstrated as useful biomarkers in the diagnosis of systemic sclerosis (SSc), where their sensitivity is about 20%-35%. ACA are closely associated with CREST syndrome, a limited form of SSc, and can also serve as predictors of a more benign and protracted course 2 . In addition, ACA are thought to be associated with pulmonary arterial hypertension 3, 4 and cardiac conduction blocks 5 .",

Immunostrips and/or ELISA assays using recombinant CENP-A and CENP-B have been used in some clinics for detection of ACA. Other known target antigens of ACA include CENP-D 14, 15 , CENP-E 16 , and CENP-O 17 discovered in SSc, and CENP-F 18 , CENP-G 19 , CENP-H 20 , and CENP-I 21 in other diseases. However, a recent study tested 95 sera with ACA, and found none reacted to CENP-H, -I, -K, -L, -M, -N, and -U, and only 1 reacted weakly to CENP-T 22 . Additionally, autoantibodies against several CENP have been associated with clinical manifestations, for example, the level of anti-CENP-B antibodies correlated with a less extensive skin involvement in SSc 23 , and pSS patients with anti-CENP-H antibodies had a lower frequency of rheumatoid factor than those without 20 . Additionally, Gelber, et al found that the dual presence of anti-CENP-B and -C was most frequently seen in SSc, while anti-CENP-C alone was predominantly found in patients with pSS, and further suggested that obtaining antibodies to specific centromere antigens was diagnostically useful 24 .",

Subsequently, each CENP, together with negative and positive controls ( Figure 1A) , was printed in triplicate within 12 identical blocks on a single slide to produce the CENP microarray. To evaluate the quality of the microarrays, an anti-GST monoclonal antibody was used to visualize and quantify the CENP immobilized on the slides ( Figure 1B ). All CENP on the microarray produced GST signals significantly above background and each feature showed highly reproducible signals with pairwise correlation coefficients of 0.999, indicating that this microarray is of high quality (Figure 1 , B-C). Identification of new CENP antigens for ACA by protein microarray. To determine whether additional CENP could be recognized by ACA, 35 ACA-positive SSc sera were individually incubated with the CENP microarrays ( Figure  1 , D-I). As a comparison, a cohort of 20 ACA-negative healthy subjects was also assayed in the same fashion. Using the mean value plus 3 SD of the healthy subjects as a cutoff, 11 were used to conduct the ELISA assay (supplementary data available from the author upon request). In total, 31 and 12 SSc sera were positive for CENP-P and -Q, respectively (supplementary data available from the author upon request). To validate them, all of these positives were subjected to WB using recombinant CENP-P and -Q proteins. We also included GST protein because CENP-P and -Q proteins were GST-tagged. No significant signals were observed for the GST protein (~26 kDa) for all samples (Figure 3 ). Twenty-three and 11 sera gave expected immunoreactive bands at 58-62 kDa for CENP-P and CENP-Q, respectively, and were considered true positives ( Figure 3 , Table 1 ).",

For patients with SSc, ACA have been shown to be useful diagnosis biomarkers for phenotypic subsets, as well as prognosis markers 37 . We fabricated a CENP-focused protein microarray to comprehensively survey their autoimmunity status in patients with SSc. In addition to the recovery of 6 known ACA antigens, 5 CENP were identified as potential novel autoantigens in SSc. Validation results from ELISA and Western blotting demonstrated that both CENP-P and -Q are actual centromere autoantigens for ACA. In addition, anti-CENP-P autoantibodies were also present in ACA-negative sera (6.0%). In theory, a serum sample that can recognize a CENP should be able to stain the kinetochore and show an ACA-positive pattern in the IIF assay. However, we found that quite a few sera samples found to be ACA-negative by IIF were actually anti-CENP-B and/or -A positive by both commercial immunostrip assay and centromere protein microarray. Similarly, anti-CENP-P was found in IIF-negative sera. This discrepancy may suggest that either the IIF method is not sensitive enough, requiring higher antibody titer, or the CENP-P protein/epitopes are buried in the complex that blocks the access of their autoantibodies. On the other hand, 1 serum sample determined by IIF to be ACA-positive failed to recognize any of the 14 CENP in our microarray analysis as well as CENP-A and CENP-B by commercial immunostrips (supplementary data available from the author upon request), suggesting there might be additional autoantigens in the kinetochore yet to be discovered.",

However, whether the autoantibodies against these 3 CENP are associated with specific clinical manifestations or laboratory features needs further analysis with larger cohorts. In our microarray, we included 2 isoforms for CENP-M, and only isoform I reacted with some ACA-positive sera. The 2 isoforms are identical in the first 102 amino acids, but differ greatly in their remaining sequences. Thus, the epitopes responsible for the autoimmunity of CENP-M must reside in the last 72 amino acids of isoform I.",
