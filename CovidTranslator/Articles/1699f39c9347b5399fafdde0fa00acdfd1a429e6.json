            "text": "S ince Edward Jenner's discovery of the smallpox vaccine 200 years ago, vaccines have been one of the most lifesaving health interventions for humankind and, conversely, one of the most underused health interventions in developing countries. The implementation of childhood vaccines in the United States and other industrialized countries led to a rapid and large decrease in morbidity and mortality from common childhood diseases. The smallpox eradication program, led by the World Health Organization (WHO) from 1967 to 1977, ended deaths from smallpox, a disease that once killed millions of children and adults each year. 1 Beginning in the early 1980s, the development of routine immunization programs by WHO and UNICEF for children in developing countries led to a sustained program of administration of lifesaving vaccinations as part of primary healthcare systems. Since the launch of these routine immunization programs in most countries, more than 20 million deaths have been prevented from vaccine-preventable diseases ( Fig  1) . Ongoing initiatives to eradicate polio, reduce measles mortality rates, eliminate measles from discrete regions of the world, and introduce additional vaccines have been remarkably successful. However, more than 1.4 million children died from vaccine-preventable diseases in 2002, 610,000 from measles alone, suggesting that great challenges still exist to fully utilize the potential of lifesaving vaccines (WHO, unpublished data). This article reviews the status of current immunization initiatives, summarizes lessons learned, and makes recommendations for a healthier world through the use of vaccines.",

Only India, Pakistan, and Afghanistan in Asia, and Egypt, Nigeria, and Niger in Africa continue to have ongoing transmission of polio. 2 In 2003, 10 countries reported poliovirus importations, eight from West and Central Africa. Independent commissions established by WHO have certified the interruption of polio transmission in three WHO regions (American, European, and Western Pacific) comprised of 135 countries and territories and 3 billion people. 3 The partnership to eradicate polio is led by WHO, Rotary International, UNICEF, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), with additional support provided by numerous countries, private foundations, and private companies. Strategies to eradicate polio include strengthening routine childhood immunization programs, surveillance for acute flaccid paralysis to detect possible cases of polio, and supplemental immunization activities to interrupt poliovirus transmission rapidly. During National Immunization Days (NIDs) to eradicate polio, all children younger than 5 years of age receive polio vaccine without regard to previous vaccination status. The successful implementation of these strategies in more than 200 countries and territories has prevented more than 250,000 deaths and nearly 5 million cases of paralysis since the initiative was launched in 1988. The inclusion of vitamin A supplementation during NIDs to children in most developing countries has reduced mortality from Vitamin A deficiency by more than 1 million children since 1988. 2",

By early 2004, the Partnership appears to be on course to meet the objective and already has reduced the number of deaths to 610,000 in 2002, a 30 percent reduction in mortality compared with global measles mortality in 1999. 6 PAHO developed the following successful strategies to eliminate measles: (1) the implementation of initial mass vaccination campaigns for all children aged 9 months to 14 years to interrupt the transmission of measles quickly, (2) the maintenance of a high degree of population immunity by providing routine vaccination of children at 12 months of age on an ongoing basis, and (3) mass vaccination campaigns held every 3 to 4 years in which all children younger than 5 years of age born since the previous campaign are targeted regardless of previous vaccination status. The strategies designed to eliminate measles and reduce measles mortality are similar and include improving first-dose measles coverage and providing a second-dose opportunity for children through either routine immunization programs or supplemental measles campaigns. The PAHO vaccination strategies were complemented by a sensitive surveillance system, including investigation and laboratory confirmation of all cases through effective virologic surveillance, to detect suspected measles transmission. 7",

A strategy document was published by UNICEF/WHO/UNFPA in 2000, in which the agreed goal of MNT elimination would be achieved by reaching all child-bearing age women at high risk for tetanus with three doses of tetanus toxoid vaccine (TT) by 2005. 11 Supplemental strategies include promoting clean deliveries and improving surveillance for MNT to target interventions and sustain elimination.",

No effective vaccines against HIV/AIDS or malaria have been developed. Although the existing TB vaccine (BCG) offers limited protection against childhood forms of the disease, protection against the most common adult form is limited. A successful vaccine against HIV is thought to be scientifically feasible. Some candidate vaccines are at different levels of clinical testing, but efficacy against naturally occurring HIV remains to be demonstrated. For malaria, although significant progress has been attained in vaccine development, an effective vaccine is considered to be at least 10 years away. Research into new TB vaccines to replace BCG has produced some potential candidates, but it is not likely that anything will be available for about 8 to 10 years.",

The most notable recent achievement in surveillance worldwide has been the establishment of surveillance systems for acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) in almost every country in the world in support of the eradication of polio. Even countries in emergency situations such as Afghanistan and Angola have well-functioning AFP surveillance systems that effectively direct polio immunization activities to interrupt circulation of wild poliovirus. The AFP surveillance system includes a laboratory network that not only confirms suspected polio cases rapidly but also provides genetic information on each virus to determine its origin, vital in the late stages when only a few cases remain. The achievements of AFP surveillance have led to new efforts to improve surveillance for a variety of other diseases including measles, yellow fever, and neonatal tetanus using the same AFP system for detection, reporting, investigation, and laboratory confirmation of cases. In addition, substantial progress has been made in developing countries to establish effective laboratory-based surveillance to define bacterial causes for meningitis and to determine disease burden to justify vaccination programs.",

Secondary health objectives must be complementary and synergistic. The addition of Vitamin A to polio vaccination campaigns (both Vitamin A and polio vaccine are administered orally in developing countries) represents an excellent example of a secondary strategy that helped to improve children's health significantly without compromising the primary objective of eradication of polio. \u2022 Funds to support implementation of vaccine initiatives are imperative. In middle-income countries, the addition of limited funding can help to galvanize the governmental machinery (health workers, media, treasury officials, etc.) in support of immunization initiatives.
