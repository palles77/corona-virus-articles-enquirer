Generalized additive model was applied to explore the effect of temperature, humidity and diurnal temperature range on the daily death counts of COVID-19. There were 2,299 COVID-19 death counts in Wuhan during the study period. A positive association with COVID-19 daily death counts was observed for diurnal temperature range (r = 0.44), but negative association for relative humidity (r = \u22120.32). In addition, one unit increase in diurnal temperature range was only associated with a 2.92% (95% CI: 0.61%, 5.28%) increase in COVID-19 deaths in lag 3. However, both 1 unit increase of temperature and absolute humidity were related to the decreased COVID-19 death in lag 3 and lag 5, with the greatest decrease both in lag 3 [-7.50% (95% CI: -10.99%, -3.88%) and -11.41% (95% CI: -19.68%, -2.29%)]. In summary, this study suggests the temperature variation and humidity may also be important factors affecting the COVID-19 mortality.",

We used GAM to analyze the associations between meteorological factors (temperature, DTR, relative humidity and absolute humidity) and the daily death counts of COVID-19. The core analysis was a GAM with a quasi-Poisson link function based on the previous studies (Almeida et al., 2010; Basu et al., 2008) . We first built the basic models for death outcomes without including air pollution or weather variables. We incorporated smoothed spline functions of time, which accommodate nonlinear and nonmonotonic patterns between mortality and time, thus offering a flexible modeling tool. Then, we introduced the weather variables and analyzed their effects on mortality. Akaike's information criterion was used as a measure of how well the model fitted the data. Consistent with several recent time-series studies (Cheng and Kan, 2012; Zeng et al., 2016) , the penalized smoothing spline function was applied to control the effects of confounding factors, such as time trends, day-of-week and air pollution. The core GAM equation is: on day t; \uf061 is the intercept; \u03b2 is the regression coefficient; X t is the daily level of weather variables on day t; s() denotes the smoother based on the penalized smoothing spline. Based on Akaike's information criterion (AIC), the 2 degrees of freedom (df) is used for time trends and 3 df for air pollutants, temperature and relative humidity; DOW is a categorical variable indicating the date of the week.",

            "text": "Fig. 2 showed the exposure-response relationship curves between meteorological factors and COVID-19 mortality at the same day (lag 0). Generally, the curves tended to be not associated with COVID-19 mortality for DTR but were strongly positive for temperature. In addition, the curves associated with relative humidity and absolute humidity presented similar linear trends, which indicated that the higher level of humidity might cause decrease in the COVID-19 mortality. To confirm these results, lag and cumulative effects were discussed in the following analysis. Researchers confirmed that respiratory infection was enhanced during unusually cold and low humidity conditions (Davis et al., 2016) , indicating low humidity might also be an important risk factor for respiratory diseases. A 25-year study found that humidity was an important determinant of mortality, and low-humidity levels might cause a large increase in mortality rates, potentially by influenza-related mechanisms (Barreca, 2012) , similar to a study carried out in the United States (Barreca and Shimshack, 2012) . Consistent to these findings, our results also indicate that the risk of dying from COVID-19 decreases only with absolute humidity increasing. Breathing dry air could cause epithelial damage and/or reduction of mucociliary clearance, and then lead to render the host more susceptible to respiratory virus infection; The formation of droplet nuclei is essential to transmission, but exhaled respiratory droplets settle very rapidly at high humidity so that it is hard to contribute to influenza virus spread (Lowen et al., 2007) . Moreover, the transmission of pandemic influenza virus is efficient under cold, dry conditions (Steel et al., 2011) , and influenza virus survival rate increased markedly in accordance with decreasing of absolute humidity (Shaman et al., 2009 ), which may be very similar to coronavirus. Therefore, the increase of COVID-19 mortality may also be related to the lower humidity in winter. J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f ",

            "text": "COVID-19 outbreak has caused great health burden around the world. In this study, we examined the relationship between meteorological factors and COVID-19. Our results showed significant positive effect of DTR on the daily mortality of COVID-19, and a significant negative association between COVID-19 mortality and ambient temperature as well as absolute humidity. The results indicate that the effects of DTR and humidity should also be paid attention when estimating the death causes of COVID-19.finding suggested that the phagocytic function of pulmonary alveolar macrophages declined under cold stress in vitro experiment(Luo et al., 2017). Breathing cold air can lead to bronchial constriction, which may promote susceptibility to pulmonary infection(Martens, 1998). Additionally, since SARS-CoV-2 is sensitive to heat, and high temperature makes it difficult to survive, not to mention the beneficial factors for virus transmission like indoor crowding and poor ventilation in cold days(Bunker et al., 2016). Also, cold temperature has been discovered to be associated with the reduction of lung function and increases in exacerbations for people withCOPD (Donaldson et al., 1999). DTR represents a stable measure of temperature, which is an indicator of temperature variability to evaluate effects on human health, including mortality and morbidity(Easterling et al., 1997). Also, abrupt temperature changes may add to the burden of cardiac and respiratory system causing cardiopulmonary events and high DTR levels may be a source of environmental stress(Sharafkhani et al., 2019). It is said that the windows of inpatient wards were asked to remain open for 24h a day and avoid using air conditioning in Wuhan hospitals due to ventilation necessity, therefore the indoor variation trend of meteorological factors could be very close to the outdoor environment. Concerning about this condition",
