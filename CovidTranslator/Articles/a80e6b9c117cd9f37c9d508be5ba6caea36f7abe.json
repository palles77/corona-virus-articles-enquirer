A common characteristic of these agents is that they are weak bases and accumulate within acidic intracellular compartments, notably lysosomes, thereby elevating pH (Ohkuma and Poole, 1978) . Perturbation of the pH within lysosomes and related vesicles has been shown (Helenius et cd., 1980; Marsh et cd, 1983) to inhibit the fusion of the prelysosomal (or endosomal) membrane with the viral envelope of the togavirus, Semliki Forest virus.

Again, as in the case of intracellular kmmk-HOURS RI. virus, the subsequent replication curves and final virus titers are very similar, whether monitored from control or ammonium chloride-treated cultures. The above results suggest that the action of ammonium chloride is to attenuate a step in MHV replication, which once overcome, permits normal virus production.

            "text": "Eflects of ammonium chloride on earlg stages of MHV ir&ection. In agreement with the studies by Krzystyniak and Dupuy (1984) , our preliminary experiments had shown that MHV adsorption to L cells was unaffected by the presence of ammonium chloride. Accordingly, all studies reported in the present paper were performed with the addition of ammonium chloride immediately following the adsorption period. The entry of MHV into the host cell appears to be one involving viropexis (David-Ferreira and Manaker, 1965) in which virus inoculum is internalized within a cytoplasmic vesicle or endosome. In order to investigate whether ammonium chloride affected the process of virus internalization, MHV-adsorbed cells were warmed to 37\" for various intervals in the presence or absence of ammonium chloride, then stripped of external virus with proteinase K, and as-sayed for internalized virus by infectious center assay. The results shown in Fig.  2A demonstrate that virus internalization occurred with equal efficiency, whether or not ammonium chloride was present. In either case, uptake of MHV into the cell occurred rapidly upon exposure to 37\" and was essentially complete after 2 hr. Events subsequent to virus uptake, which result in the liberation of viral genome into the cytosol have not been characterized in coronavirus replication. One possibility, analogous to that observed with many enveloped viruses, is that the viral envelope undergoes fusion with the membrane of the surrounding vesicle (e.g., Marsh et c& 1983) . Since this latter fusion event is known to be inhibited by lysosomotropic amines in the case of infection with certain viruses, such as the enveloped togaviruses , we monitored the effect of ammonium chloride on the eclipse phase of MHV infection. Virus uncoating, as well as any other degradative processes occurring during the eclipse phase, can be monitored by following the decline in infectivity of internalized MHV inoculum. In order to allow a reasonable degree of virus internalization to occur MHV-adsorbed cells were warmed to 37' for 20 min in medium with and without ammonium chloride. Under these conditions, approximately 50% of cellbound virus is internalized ( Fig. 2A) . Cells were then treated with proteinase K to remove external virus, incubated at 37\" in the presence or absence of ammonium chloride, then subsequently lysed and assayed for infectivity of internalized inoculum. While this procedure does not permit analysis of events occurring during the first 20 min, it is evident from the results shown in Fig. 2B , that the eclipse phase in MHV infection is strikingly affected by the presence of ammonium chloride. At the first time point examined (20 min) virus eclipse was seen to occur more rapidly in the absence of ammonium chloride, as judged by an approx 17% decrease in relative infectivity of intracellular inoculum. The effect of ammonium chloride on virus eclipse became more pronounced with time. Thus, while in normal MHV infection, virus eclipse was complete by 3 hr PI, the process occurred with clearly less efficiency in the presence of ammonium chloride (Fig. 2B) , so that even as late as 5 hr PI considerable infectivity was associated with the internalized virus inoculum. We interpret these data on the eclipse stage of MHV infection as suggesting an inhibitory effect of ammonium chloride on one or more processes involved in the uncoating of MHV. It is not possible to say at present as to which proportion of the eclipsed virus represents legitimate endosomal uncoating as opposed to a possible \"dead-end\" pathway of lysosomal degradation. Indeed, in light of the infectious center data (Table 2) , it is apparent that, even in the presence of ammonium chloride, MHV must eventually uncoat to a similar degree as that attained in untreated cells. Given the evidence that ammonium chloride inhibits the activities of both lysosomes (Ohkuma and Poole, 1978) and endosomes (Maxfield, 1982) the results of Fig. 2B are best explained on the basis of combined inhibitory actions on lysosomal/endosomal processing of internalized MHV.",

If the eclipse phase is the primary site of action of ammonium chloride during MHV replication, then attenuation or delay of infection at this early stage would be expected to give rise to similar delays in subsequent virus-encoded functions. Since the first easily assayable function following eclipse is viral RNA synthesis, we examined levels of MHV RNA produced in infected cells maintained in the presence or absence of ammonium chloride. Radiolabeled RNA obtained at 6 hr PI from MHV-infected L-2 cells, maintained in the presence or absence of ammonium chloride, was subjected to agarose gel electrophoresis and autoradiographic analysis. The normal pattern of MHVencoded RNAs numbered according to the convention of Siddell et al. (1983) was obtained (Fig. 3 , lane C). When ammonium chloride was present immediately following adsorption, the level of radiolabeled MHV RNA was reduced (Fig. 3 , lane 0) to 8% of the control level, as determined by comparative densitometric scanning of lanes 0 and C. When the addition of ammonium chloride was delayed by 1, 2, or 3 hr following adsorption, thus permitting progressively in the absence (C) or in the presence of ammonium chloride, added either immediately after adsorption (0), 1 hr PI (l), 2 hr PI (2), or 3 hr PI (3). Viral RNA was radiolabeled by culturing the infected cells with [8Hjuridine in the presence of actinomycin D. Cultures were harvested at 6 hr PI, and the RNA was extracted and analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis. An autoradiograph of the dried gel is shown. Numbering of the MHV-specific RNA bands follows the convention of Siddell et aL (1983) . more virus uncoating, the levels of radiolabeled MHV RNA were seen to increase (Fig. 3, lanes 1, 2, and 3) to 34, 52, and 85%, respectively, of that obtained in the normal MHV infection (lane C). Furthermore, the normal electrophoretic pattern of MHV RNA was obtained in the presence of ammonium chloride. In order to determine whether the effect of ammonium chloride on viral RNA synthesis was one of inhibition or attenuation, a quantitative time-course analysis of viral RNA levels was performed on MHVinfected cells maintained in the presence or absence of ammonium chloride. As shown in Figs. 4A and B, MHV-infected L-2 cells, maintained in normal medium, first showed detectable levels of viral RNA at 3 hr PI; this was delayed until approx 6 hr PI when ammonium chloride was present. Nevertheless, the ammonium chloride-treated culture eventually (at 12 hr PI) produced levels of viral RNA very similar to the maximum levels produced in the untreated culture. Although the kinetics of RNA synthesis were noticeably slower in the presence of ammonium chloride, this is likely due to a certain degree of desynchronization in the initiation of RNA transcription, as a consequence of the protracted eclipse (uncoating) stage (Fig. 2B) . Thus, it would appear that ammonium chloride does not inhibit viral RNA synthesis in a quantitative manner, but rather delays its onset.",

Studies with both avian (Chasey and Alexander, 1976 ) and murine (David-Ferreira and Manaker, 1965; Krzystyniak and Dupuy, 1984) coronaviruses have demonstrated that uptake of viral inoculum occurs predominantly by viropexis. As a result, virions are observed in cytoplasmic vesicles within 1 to 2 hr postinoculation (David-Ferreira and Manaker, 1965) . There has to date, however, been no documentation, by electron microscopic or other means, of the uncoating process of intracellular coronaviruses. A role for lysosomal involvement in coronavirus replication was first suggested by Mallucci (1966) who noted that the lysosomotropic agent, chloroquine, reduced MHV yields from inoculated mouse peritoneal macrophages. In a recent study, Krzystyniak and Dupuy (1984) described an inhibitory effect of the lysosomotropic agent, ammonium chloride, on the replication of MHV. These authors noted that when the addition of ammonium chloride to MHVinfected cells was delayed until 3 hr PI, the inhibitory effect was largely abrogated, suggesting that an early event in the replication cycle was affected.",

All posteclipse parameters examined (progeny MHV production, cell fusion, viral protein synthesis, and viral RNA synthesis) were found to be chronologically displaced by about 4-7 hr when the infection was performed in the presence of ammonium chloride. These results demonstrate that ammonium chloride intervenes primarily at a stage prior to, or including, synthesis of viral RNA (positive-sense species) during the MHV replication cycle. This stage is likely that of uncoating as suggested by the protracted eclipse (Fig. 2) in the presence of ammonium chloride. Of interest in the present study is our finding that, in the presence of ammonium chloride, viral polypeptides appear to be synthesized with normal apparent molecular weights. In particular, there was no detectable change in the SDS-PAGE mobility of the major viral glycoprotein (Ez) which could be ascribed to altered glycosylation. Apparent alterations in glycosylation of viral glycoproteins have been observed in herpesvirus infections of human embryonic lung cells, when maintained in ammonium chloride at a concentration of 50 mM (Kousoulas et al, 1982 (Kousoulas et al, , 1983 but not at 20 mM (Holland and Person, 1977) . Concentrations of ammonium chloride higher than 20 mM were found in our preliminary experiments to be cytotoxic to the mouse L-2 cells used for MHV infection.",
