            "text": "Objectives: Use of point-of-care testing is increasing, however many haematology analysers can only determine granulocyte count without further differentiation into neutrophils, eosinophils and basophils. Since the diagnosis of life-threatening neutropenia in cancer patients requires a distinct neutrophil count, this study aimed to determine the comparative performance between the neutrophil and granulocyte count. Design and methods: A database of 508 646 venous full blood count results measured on a laboratory reference analyser was mined from a large oncology unit. The relationship between granulocyte and neutrophil counts was assessed. Multinomial logistic regression was used to classify results into neutropenia grades using an equivalent granulocyte count. Results: Granulocyte to neutrophil count correlation was 0.997. The accuracy for classification into neutropenia grades using the derived equivalent granulocyte count ranges was 96.4%. Identification of results with a neutrophil count < 1.5\u00d710 9 cells/L using an equivalent granulocyte count of < 1.69\u00d710 9 cells/L resulted in sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values of 98.0%, 99.5%, 97.8% and 99.5%, respectively. Conclusions: These results describe the relationship between granulocyte and neutrophil counts, measured on a laboratory analyser, in a large population of patients with malignancies and receiving anti-cancer therapies. However, this relationship must be established using a point of care testing system with a three-part differential count before considering the possibility that a granulocyte count can guide clinical decisions in the absence of a definitive neutrophil count, to reduce the frequency and severity of neutropenic complications in patients receiving cancer treatments.",

The initial three-part differential count expanded to the five-part differential count, with differentiation of the granulocyte count into neutrophil, basophil and eosinophil counts. Viral and bacterial infections are arguably the most common cause of acquired neutropenia [6, 7] , through margination of neutrophils and destruction by circulating antibodies [8] . Neutrophil levels may also be decreased due to congenital haematological malignancies [9] , as a result of radiotherapy [10] or through the use of cytotoxic chemotherapy drugs [11] . Extreme reductions in neutrophil count can lead to serious complications such as febrile neutropenia (fever > 38\u00b0C and neutrophil count < 0.5\u00d710 9 cells/L [12] ), increasing the risk of sepsis-associated mortality [13] , necessitating urgent clinical assessment in at risk patients. Thus, most chemotherapy patients are given immediate empirical antibiotics upon suspicion of infection [14] . In such patients, access to a rapid differential white count is vital as delays in administration of broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotics are associated with increased mortality risk, but overtreatment with unnecessary antibiotics has opportunity costs [15] .",

However, it should be noted that these guidelines assume a full clinical assessment is carried out. Three-part differential analysers might have the potential to be used as point of care devices where the patient may be remote from the clinician; therefore, this work analysed the performance of granulocytes with reference to neutrophil count thresholds greater than 0.5 \u00d7 10 9 /L to allow for safety margins required due to absent clinical information. The important clinical question is: if using the equivalent granulocyte count indicates the patient has an ANC above the specified threshold, how sure can we be that this is correct? As an example, using granulocyte count to indicate a neutrophil result is less than 1.0 \u00d7 10 9 /L, the best performing granulocyte count in terms of balancing false negatives with false positives would be < 1.13 \u00d7 10 9 /L, but in order to obtain no false negative results, a significantly higher threshold needs to be used. This would be offset by increasing the false positives. It is a clinical decision as to whether this is acceptable, and is dependent upon the consequences of misclassification of a result. However, this concept would have to be tested in an appropriate clinical trial setting with a point of care testing (POCT) system with a 3-part differential measurement capability. The strength of this data is the large cohort of patients employed in this analysis, with a wide variety of patients in terms of their neoplasm diagnosis, other co-morbidities, demographic information and many possible neutrophil abundancies. All grades of neutropenia are represented and this may be due to cytotoxic treatments such as chemotherapy or the cancer diagnosis itself.",

Firstly, the methodology of granulocyte extraction by summating its differentials is not a direct result from a haematology analyser and therefore may underestimate errors between readings. Secondly, both measurements were made on a 'state-of-the art' haematology analyser in a central laboratory, albeit as part of routine daily practice. Thirdly, there are recognised differences in the quantitation of individual white cell species with the use of different detection technologies. This means that variation in the counting technology due to cell population differences may impact on the results, e.g., in the presence of blast or immature granulocytes or neutrophils.",

Such high-risk patients would include those with eosinophilia or basophilia, or active allergic conditions. This study has considered the single result in the context of decision making; it is possible that such measurements may be used for routine monitoring. We conclude from this large cohort of data that the granulocyte count warrants further consideration as a surrogate indicator of neutrophil count. It could be used to indicate the CTCAE grade of neutropenia and its use could be considered in patients with suspected febrile neutropenia, where an alternative neutrophil count may not be readily available. However, it must be recognised that this relationship has been established with both measurements made on an established laboratory analyser system. This relationship cannot be assumed to be applicable to laboratory analysers employing different detection methodologies or to POCT systems. Therefore, the findings from this study cannot be extrapolated to the POCT situation. If POCT, using a three-part differential white count, is to be considered for monitoring patients on chemotherapy away from the hospital setting, then the relationship between the granulocyte and neutrophil count must be established using the technologies that will be used in routine practice [30] [31] [32] ; with an appropriate cohort of patients exhibiting the range of neutrophil counts expected to be experienced, and as a precursor to a clinical trial. expressed are those of the author(s) and not necessarily those of the NHS, the NIHR or the Department of Health.
