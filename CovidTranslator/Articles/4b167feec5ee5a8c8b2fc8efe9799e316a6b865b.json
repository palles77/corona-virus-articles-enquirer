Faecal samples taken from 15 cows before and after calving as well as faeces taken from their calves daily from birth to two weeks of life were tested for rotavirus by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and compared with an ELISA and a latex agglutination commercial test. Rotavirus excretion was not detected in faeces from cows around parturition by any of the three tests. However, all of their calves shed rotaviruses during the observation period. The onset of rotavirus excretion determined by PAGE ranged from day 2 to day 8 of life (day 4.8 + 1.8 on average) and lasted for 4 to 7 days (5.3 + 1.1 days on average). Chi-square test showed a significant association (P= 0.0001 ) between the presence of rotavirus and the altered consistency of calves faeces. All the three tests showed similar results (overall agreement 92.5%) but discrepancies were detected mainly at the beginning or at the end of the rotavirus excretion period. Results obtained with both commercial kits closely paralleled each other and parameters other than sensitivity, specificity, diagnostic accuracy or predictive values have to be considered as selection criteria.",

            "text": "Neonatal calf diarrhoea is a major threat to the cattle industry due to mortality, medical costs and poor growth of calves in both dairy and beef herds. The syndrome has a great aetiological complexity and numerous pathogens have been reported in association with the disease (Woode and Bridger, 1975; Woode et at., 1976; Moon et at., 1978; Tzipori, 1981 accepted to be an important cause of neonatal diarrhoea in calves throughout the world with its greatest frequency and severity within the first two weeks of life (Acres et al., 1977; De Leeuw et al., 1980) . Large numbers of rotavirus particles are excreted in faeces of diarrheic calves and are highly resistant to inactivation. Thus, the main source of rotavirus in an outbreak results from environmental contamination and the spread of infection can temporarilly be broken by thorough cleaning and disinfection of the premises (McNulty and Logan, 1983 ) . However, subclinically infected older calves and adult cows may play a role in the spread of infection to young calves as well as in the perpetuation of infection within a herd (Goto et al., 1986) . Various methods have been developed for rapid detection of rotaviruses in faecal samples; these include electron microscopy (considered for a long time as the reference method), immune electron microscopy, counter immuno-electrophoresis, complement fixation, fluorescent antibody tests, different immunoassays using antibodies labelled with radioisotopes or enzymes (ELISA), latex agglutination and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE). Some of these tests are commercially available.",

The herd had a history of recurrent neonatal diarrhoea for previous years. Pregnant cows were vaccinated with a bacterin against E. coli K99+ (Imocolibov, Rhone-Merieux laboratories) approximately three weeks before the expected calving date and were usually moved to a communal house one week before calving. The calves were separated from their dam a few hours after birth and moved to a communal pen next to the cows where they remained for at least 10 days and then they were transferred to fattening units with 40-50 calves per unit. Each calf was bucket-fed its mother's colostrum during the first day of life (2 feedings, 3 litres per feeding), the first feeding being usually within 12 hours after birth, and pooled cows colostrum during the second day of life in the same conditions. Thereafter, they were fed milk replacers from an automatic feeder.",

In the abscence of a standard, the Kappa statistic was used for comparison.

Kappa statistic is an overall measure of agreement between two tests and is useful for measuring agreement in the absence of a standard. It compares the observed proportion of samples in which the tests agree with the proportion that would be expected to agree by chance. Kappa calculation was carried out as described by Goodman and Kruskal ( 1972 ) . For interpreting Kappa values the following benchmarks can be considered: a result between 0.0 and 0.20 indicates a slight agreement, between 0.21 and 0.40 is a fair agreement, between 0.41 and 0.60 is a moderate agreement, between 0.61 and 0.80 is a substantial agreement and between 0.81 and 1.00 is an almost perfect agreement.",

That indicates that most calves were exposed to infection very soon after birth. Excretion of rotavirus in calves faeces has been reported before 48 hours of age but such an early detection is infrequent (Acres and B abiuk, 1978; De Leeuw et al., 1980) . The delay in excretion of the virus under field conditions is probably because of the presence of specific colostral antibody within the gut lumen and the elimination of this antibody renders the calf susceptible to overt infection as suggested by De Leeuw et al. (1980) . So, the early detection of rotavirus in faeces detected in the present study could be due to an inadequate feeding of colostrum.",

Recently, Kodituwakku and Harbour (1990) reported an intermitent excretion of rotavirus in 10 asymptomatic cows throughout pregnancy although rotavirus excretion and diarrhoea were detected in only one of their calves and Goto et al. ( 1986 ) have indicated that the perpetuation of rotavirus infection within a herd may result from persistent or chronic infections in older calves and adult animals. However, it is generally accepted that once an outbreak is underway, young calves act as amplifiers of the infection and that environmental contamination is the major source of infection for newborn calves, whereas maternal infection is of minor significance (Dagenais et al., 1980; McNulty and Logan, 1983; Goto et al., 1986; Murakami et al., 1987) .",

Most discrepant results were positive by PAGE while negative by latex agglutination ( 16 samples ) and negative (or gray zone ) by ELISA ( 10 samples ) and all of them except three corresponded to the first or last positive sample in the PAGE shedding pattern, when the viral content in faeces was probably low. These results seem to indicate a higher sensitivity of the PAGE test compared with that of latex agglutination and ELISA. The same explanation may be given for the discrepant results observed in calf no. 2 (days 4 and 6 ) and calf no. 11 (day 7) in which a discontinuous shedding pattern was detected by PAGE but we have no certainty.",
