The impacts of the pattern on epidemic dynamics in heterogeneous metapopulation networks, wherein each node represents a subpopulation with any number of individuals, are investigated by using a mean-field approach. The results show that the pattern does not alter the epidemic threshold, but can slightly lower the final average density of infected individuals as a whole. More importantly, we also find that the pattern produces different impacts on nodes with different degree, and that there exists a critical degree k c . For nodes with degree smaller than k c , the pattern produces a positive impact on epidemic mitigation; conversely, for nodes with degree larger than k c , the pattern produces a negative impact on epidemic mitigation.",

A key issue in this field is how to find the threshold of an epidemic outbreak, and the remarkable results have been obtained that the epidemic threshold is a positive value in homogeneous networks [1, 2] , but tends to zero in a wide range of SF (scale-free) networks with large size [3, 4] . Most of these studies mainly focused on epidemic dynamics in static networks, where each node represents a single individual and the connections between individuals are fixed.",

In fact, people generally have awareness and change their behaviors (including canceling their trips) to respond to an epidemic outbreak, and such behavior changes have been proved to affect the network structure and epidemic dynamics [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] . To the best of our knowledge, so far there has been no report, except Ref. [29] , that has explicitly considered the response of the variation of human travel rates in epidemic dynamics. In Ref. [29] , the authors assumed that the human mobility rate is adjusted according to the local epidemic prevalence in the destination subpopulation. In this case, only the probability of human traveling to the infected subpopulation is affected. However, in some other cases, a lethal epidemic outbreak can cause reduction of travel in global scope, not just in local infected regions, because of people fearing to be infected on trips. For example, in 2003, the spread of SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) in several provinces of China led to a decrease of travel all over the country [30] .",

[29] , we introduce a time-varying human mobility pattern to model the time variation of global human travel due to the emergence of an epidemic. In this pattern, human mobility rates are governed by the global epidemic prevalence and the fraction of people who have awareness of the epidemic spreading. In addition, not just by simulation method, we also theoretically explore the impacts of the mobility pattern on metapopulation epidemic dynamics. Interesting results are found as follows: (i) the time-varying mobility pattern does not alter the epidemic threshold, but it can slightly lower the final average density of infected individuals as a whole; (ii) more importantly, we also find that the pattern can produce different impacts on nodes with different degree, and that there exists a critical degree. For nodes with degree smaller than the critical degree, the pattern produces a positive impact on epidemic mitigation; conversely, for nodes with degree larger than the critical degree, the pattern produces a negative impact on epidemic mitigation. This paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, the metapopulation epidemic model with the time-varying human mobility pattern is suggested. In Section 3, by applying the MF (mean-field) approach, the theoretical analysis of the model is performed. Section 4 gives the simulation results. Conclusions and discussions are presented in Section 5. In addition, Appendix gives the method of calculating the critical node degree in details.",

The networks are generated with the UCM (uncorrelated configuration model) [36] based on the Molloy-Reed algorithm [37] . Two networks are generated for these simulations: the first network has V = 1000 nodes with degree distribution P(k) \u223c k \u22123 (2 \u2264 k \u2264 V 1/2 ) characterized by the first moment \u27e8k\u27e9 = 2.86 and the second moment \u27e8k 2 \u27e9 = 11.16, respectively. The second network has V = 2000 nodes with degree distribution P(k) \u223c k \u22122.5 (2 \u2264 k \u2264 V 1/2 ), and the first and second moments are \u27e8k\u27e9 = 3.6 and \u27e8k 2 \u27e9 = 23.8, respectively. In order to reduce the influence of random factors on the simulation results, each simulation result shown in the figures is averaged over 20 independent realizations of different initial infected individuals. At the initial time step, all individuals are randomly distributed in the nodes. In Fig. 1 , we report the simulation results for the normalized stationary average infection density as a function of the population density in the network with \u03c9 1 and \u03c9 2 equal to 0 or 1. We can see from \u27e8k 2 \u27e9 = 0.73 (wherein the parameters are \u03b2 = 0.1, \u00b5 = 0.1, \u27e8k\u27e9 = 2.86, and \u27e8k 2 \u27e9 = 11.16) regardless of whether mobility rates are changed or not (i.e., \u03c9 1 = \u03c9 2 = 0 or \u03c9 1 \u0338 = 0 or (and) \u03c9 2 \u0338 = 0). So this validates the theoretical prediction with respect to the epidemic threshold. Fig. 1(b) shows the simulation results obtained for the second network with \u03b2 = 0.1 and \u00b5 = 0.2. Obviously, the simulated values of the threshold are all almost equal to the analytical value \u03c1 c = 1.08 calculated according to the given parameters (i.e., \u03b2 = 0.1, \u00b5 = 0.2, \u27e8k\u27e9 = 3.6, and \u27e8k 2 \u27e9 = 23.8).

It can be seen that the stationary infection density in the Case II pattern is always less than that of the Case I pattern irrespective of the \u03c1 value. This means that the time-varying mobility pattern can slightly mitigate the global epidemic spreading as a whole. Moreover, we also find that, in a certain range of \u03c1 (e.g., 5 \u2264 \u03c1 \u2264 15 in Fig. 1(a) and 2 \u2264 \u03c1 \u2264 18 in Fig. 1(b) ), the value of \u03c1 I /\u03c1 in the Case II pattern is significantly lower than that in the Case I pattern, whereas such difference is very small if parameter \u03c1 does not lie in this range. The main reason for the occurrence of this phenomenon can be explained as follows. On the one hand, when the value of \u03c1 is too small, each node has on average very few individuals. In such a case, a mobility rate change can hardly alter the total average number of contacts. On the other hand, the larger the density of individuals \u03c1 is, the more individuals move among the nodes, and the faster the infected individuals move to most nodes. Once most nodes have infected individuals, decreasing the mobility rate cannot effectively affect the epidemic prevalence in the stationary state.",

It is easy to see from Fig. 4 (a)-(d) that there always exists a common point at which the \u03c1 S,k values are equal for the two patterns, regardless of the \u03c1 value. Here, we denote the nodes' degree corresponding to the common point as the critical degree k c . For nodes with degree smaller/larger than k c , the relative density of susceptible individuals \u03c1 S,k of the Case II pattern is higher/lower than that of Case I pattern. Moreover, it is noticed that the equation \u03c1 S,k + \u03c1 I,k = k\u03c1/\u27e8k\u27e9 is always satisfied for these two cases. So we can derive that the relative density of infected individuals \u03c1 I,k of the Case II pattern is lower/higher than that of the Case I pattern for nodes with degree smaller/larger than \u03c1 c . This means that k c is a critical threshold with respect to the node degree separating the positive impacts from the negative impacts on epidemic mitigation. This phenomenon can be understood as follows. The nodes with higher degree have more individuals, and this is convenient for epidemic spreading inside those nodes. So the infection densities in the stationary state are higher than those in nodes with lower degree nodes. Compared with the Case I pattern, the Case II pattern can decrease the number of individuals moving among nodes.

It is found that the time variation of human mobility rates does not alter the epidemic threshold, but it can lower the final average density of infected individuals as a whole. More importantly, we have also derived a critical value with respect to the node degree. For nodes with degree smaller than the critical value, our pattern produces a positive effect on epidemic mitigation. Conversely, for nodes with degree larger than the critical value, it produces a negative effect on epidemic mitigation.",

These results enable us to better understand epidemic dynamical behavior in heterogeneous social networks. Certainly, more complicated time-varying mobility patterns can be defined based on other more realistic mobility patterns such as recurrent mobility or traffic-dependent mobility. This deserves further investigation in future work.",
