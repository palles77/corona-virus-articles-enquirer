Here we describe for the first time, the identification and characterization of type I IFNs of dromedary camel, which are the most important cytokines in the innate host immune response against viruses. We cloned camel IFN-\u03b1 coding sequences and identified a total of eleven subtypes. The canonical IFN-\u03b1 subtype designated as IFN-\u03b11 contained a 555-bp Open Reading Frame encoding a protein of 184 amino acids. Recombinant IFN-\u03b11 protein was produced in E. coli and purified from inclusion bodies. Recombinant camel IFN-\u03b11 induced the mRNA expression of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) in camel kidney cells. The purified protein also showed potent in-vitro antiviral activity against Camelpox Virus in kidney cells. The identified camel IFN-\u03b1 protein and the subtypes will facilitate a better understanding of the host immune response to viral infections in camel and the development of potential antiviral biologicals for zoonotic diseases for which camel act as a reservoir.",

            "text": "The interferons (IFNs) of vertebrates constitute the primary line of defense of host immune response against invading pathogens. These helical proteins are classified into type I (viral interferons), type II (immune interferon or IFN-\u03b3) and type III (IFN-\u03bb) interferons based on the amino acid sequence, chromosomal location and the specific receptors used for signaling (Pestka et al., 2004) . Type I IFNs form the primary line of defense in the host immune response against viral pathogens which comprise of IFN-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b2, IFN-\u03c9, IFN-\u03b5, IFN-\u03ba, IFN-\u03c4 and IFN-\u03b4 (de Weerd and Nguyen, 2012d) . In the human genome, type I IFN genes are intronless and are arranged in tandem from IFNB to IFNE spanning a region of \u223c400 kb on the short arm of chromosome 9 (D\u00edaz et al., 1994; Roberts et al., 1998) . The first primordial IFN gene is believed to have originated 500 million years ago and eventually diverged into IFNA and IFNB around 400 million years ago. The IFNA gene evolved again and duplicated many times to produce the multiple IFNA subtypes present in human and other animals (Gillespie and Carter, 1983) . In mammals, IFN-\u03b1 is one of the major type I IFN proteins modulating the host immune response against viruses and is the only type I IFN used in therapeutic practice (Antonelli et al., 2015) . Thirteen functional IFN-\u03b1 subtypes have been reported in human (Kuruganti et al., 2014) . These are produced as precursor proteins with a 23 amino acid hydrophobic signal polypeptide at the N-terminus which is cleaved off before mature IFN-\u03b1 proteins are secreted from the cells. Four conserved cysteine residues are present in the mature proteins of all IFN-\u03b1 subtypes and are located at 1, 29, 99 and 139 positions in the protein sequence. Multiple IFNA genes have been reported in other domestic animals as well. Fourteen IFNA genes have been reported from porcine and the recombinant proteins exhibited antiviral activities against porcine viruses in-vitro (Cheng et al., 2006) . Recombinant bovine IFN-\u03b1 showed antiviral activity to vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) and Bovine Viral Diarrhea Virus (Li et al., 2010; Yanagida et al., 2004) . IFNA genes have been identified from the horse and bacterially expressed recombinant equine IFN-\u03b1 exhibited antiviral effect against equine herpesvirus (Himmler et al., 1986; Steinbach et al., 2002) .",

            "text": "Camelids are a unique group of mammals with distinct immunology, the most important being the single-chain antibodies. Camelids originated in North America during the Eocene period and the present-day members have evolved to adapt to diverse challenging habitats ranging from hot deserts of Asia to cold high altitudes of South America. They are the only surviving members of the mammalian suborder Tylopoda and are represented by the Old World Camelids (the dromedary and the Bactrian camel) the New World camelids (alpaca, llama, guanaco, and vicu\u00f1a) . Though considered a hardy species, the dromedary camel is still susceptible to many viral, bacterial and protozoan pathogens. One of the most contagious and infectious diseases affecting the dromedary camels is Camelpox. It is enzootic to every region of the world (except Australia), where camels are reared, and severely impact the economy of communities dependent on camels for milk, meat, transportation, and sport. This disease is caused by Camelpox virus (CMLV), belonging to the genus Orthopoxvirus of the Poxviridae family. Like many members of the poxviruses, CMLV is also host-restricted to a single host -Camelus species (Duraffour et al., 2011b) . However recent reports of human infections in India, the Middle East, and Africa have pointed out the zoonotic threat of the camelpox virus (Bera et al., 2011; Khalafalla and Abdelazim, 2017) . Although the CMLV vaccine has been developed, the disease is still prevalent since the vaccination is not widely used and only calves above six months of age are protected by vaccination. Identification of host immunomodulatory genes targeted by CMLV and development of antivirals for treatment have been suggested as key areas for research in Camelpox (Duraffour et al., 2011b) . Dromedary camels are also reported to be the reservoir of another major zoonotic diseasethe Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and as a direct source of infection to humans (Gossner et al., 2016; Wernery et al., 2017) .Type I interferons play an important role in the host response against MERS-CoV. Interaction of the MERS-CoV with the human antigen-presenting cells (APCs) and dendritic cells significantly induce the expression of type I and III IFNs, particularly IFN-\u03b1 (Scheuplein et al., 2015) . IFN-\u03b12b treatment along with ribavirin is effective in treating MERS-CoV (Falzarano et al., 2013) . There are no reports of IFN-\u03b1 from the dromedary camel or any other members of the mammalian family Camelidae in spite of its role in the dissemination of many zoonotic infections. For elucidation of the role of IFN-\u03b1 in these major emerging zoonotic viral infections, it is necessary to isolate and characterize these key immune genes from dromedary camel.",

Recombinant camel IFN-\u03b11 protein induced the mRNA expression of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) and conferred antiviral resistance to camel kidney cells against camelpox virus infection in-vitro. The recombinant IFN-\u03b1 proteins could be used to develop specific immunological tools for the detection and management of these diseases in camelids.",

Hence, the expression construct was transformed into Rosetta 2(DE3) strains of E.coli which carried tRNAs for 7 rare codons (AGA, AGG, AUA, CUA, GGA, CCC, and CGG). Rosetta 2(DE3) E.coli carrying the CdIFN-\u03b11 expression construct produced a specific band of the expected size of \u223c 22 kDa upon IPTG induction (Fig. 5A ). Almost all of the overexpressed recombinant CdIFN-\u03b11 protein was found to be in the inclusion body and none in the soluble fraction in SDS PAGE analysis ( Supplementary  Fig. -S3-D) .",

Human IFN-\u03b11 has two disulfide bonds between Cys-1/Cys-98 and Cys-29/Cys-139.

In addition to these four cysteines, human IFN-\u03b11 has an additional cysteine residue (Cys-86), which is not present in human IFN-\u03b12.

            "text": "No N-linked glycosylation sites are predicted in any of the camel IFN-\u03b1 mature proteins. N-linked glycosylation is predicted in a few murine IFN-\u03b1, four porcine IFN-\u03b1, two mink interferons and only human IFN-\u03b114, and none of the other IFN-\u03b1 subtypes. Since IFN-\u03b1 is intronless and does not need glycosylation for its activity, prokaryotically produced recombinant IFN-\u03b1 has been the first choice for commercial production. However prokaryotic expression of interferons in heterologous expression systems like E.coli poses other technical challenges like the presence of rare codons and formation of insoluble inclusion bodies. There were 22 rare codons in the mature proteincoding sequence of camel IFN-\u03b1 which severely hampered recombinant expression. Recombinant expression of the protein was improved after the usage of Rosetta 2 (DE3) strain of E.coli which supplemented the tRNAs for 19 of the 22 rare codons present ( Supplementary Fig. S3 -A, B & C) . When overexpressed in E.coli, recombinant human IFN-\u03b1 Fig. 7 . A: Camel Kidney Cells were pretreated with recombinant IFN-\u03b11 or His 6 -tagged control protein or medium alone for 4 h. Cells were then infected with Camelpox virus (MOI = 0.1) for 1 h. Fresh medium was added to the cells and allowed to grow for another 24 h. Cells were observed using a Nikon Eclipse Ti-S inverted microscope and images captured with the NIS-Elements D 3.10 Software (Nikon). B: Reduction of CMLV DNA in IFN-\u03b11 pre-treated Camel Kidney cells infected with CMLV: After 24 h post-infection, the supernatant was collected and DNA isolated. CMLV DNA was quantified by RT-PCR (TaqMan) assay using primers CLMV-qTF/CLMV-qTFR and 5\u2032-FAM-labeled CMLV QT Probe that recognized the CMP48 L gene of CMLV. A standard curve made from 10-fold serial dilutions of viral DNA standard run under the same conditions in qPCR was used to estimate the viral DNA quantity. Results represent the mean \u00b1 SEM of three replicates. C : Dosedependent antiviral activity of recombinant CdIFN-\u03b11 : Camel Kidney Fibroblast cells were pre-treated with four-fold serial dilutions (500 ng/ml to 7.8 ng/ml) of purified recombinant Cd-IFN-\u03b11 or Control His-tagged protein and then infected with camelpox virus (moi of 0.1). Cells were observed on Nikon Eclipse Ti-S inverted microscope and images captured. D: The antiviral activity was expressed as the percentage of cells surviving following the camelpox virus infection when compared to the uninfected control. A. Premraj, et al. Molecular Immunology 119 (2020) 132-143 tends to form insoluble protein aggregates termed inclusion bodies, which are insoluble and do not exhibit biological activity (Babu et al., 2000) . Prior to recombinant expression, we analyzed the mature protein sequence of the dromedary camel IFN-\u03b11 in PROSO-II (http:// mips.helmholtz-muenchen.de/prosoII/), a sequence-based protein solubility evaluator. Recombinant camel IFN-\u03b11 was predicted to be insoluble when expressed in E.coli upon PROSO-II analysis and was later confirmed by small-scale expression studies. We used a purification strategy in which His 6 -tagged CdIFN-\u03b11 proteins in inclusion bodies were initially solubilized using 6 M GuHCl as a denaturing agent, captured on a His-affinity column and finally eluted out after on-column refolding ( Supplementary Fig. 3D & E) . Before use in in-vitro assays, to confirm the identity of recombinant protein as IFN-\u03b1, we analyzed it by western blot with an anti-human IFN\u03b1 antibody. For animals like camels which have limited species-specific immunological reagents, we have to rely on antibodies targeted against proteins of other well-studied organisms. The anti-human IFN-\u03b1 antibody recognized the recombinant camel protein, but the sensitivity seemed lower especially at low target concentration of the target protein (Fig. 5B ). This may be due to the lesser amino acid identity between the human and camel IFN-\u03b1 proteins. For better sensitivity, anti-camel IFN\u03b1 specific antibodies need to be generated, keeping in mind of the role of camel as a potential reservoir of zoonotic diseases like MERS. Primary evaluation of the biological activity of the purified recombinant CdIFN-\u03b11 protein was performed by qRT-PCR analysis of the mRNA expression of different interferon responsive genes in camel kidney cells in vitro. The recombinant IFN-\u03b11 protein induced the mRNA expression of key interferon-responsive genes like ISG15, Mx1, Viperin and RIG1 (Fig. 6) . Hundreds of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) have been identified so far and they form the major interferoninduced effectors contributing to antiviral activity. These IFN effector genes work in combination to induce a potent antiviral state (Schoggins and Rice, 2011) . Mx1 effectively blocks viral replication, whereas viperin inhibits the early stages of viral entry and replication. ISG15 is a ubiquitin-like protein that has been reported to inhibit viral release and also modify viral as well as host proteins to elicit an antiviral response. Pre-treatment of the camel kidney cells with the recombinant CdIFN-\u03b11 is presumed to induce a signaling cascade leading to the expression of these ISGs which further confer antiviral activity.",

Pre-treatment of recombinant prokaryotically expressed Camel IFN-\u03b11 conferred resistance to Camel kidney cells in vitro against the cytopathic effects of CMLV. Preliminary evaluation of antiviral activity was conducted by visual observation of the reduction in cytopathic effects of CMLV in IFN-\u03b11 treated cells (Fig. 7A) . The antiviral effect of IFN-\u03b1 pretreatment in vitro could be confirmed by quantitative real-time PCR estimation by showing reduction of the CMLV viral load and also by measuring the cell survivability ( Fig. 7B and D) . As the most abundant subtype of IFN\u03b1 present among the clones screened and having identical protein sequence to that from a potential IFNA gene identified in a few Camelus whole-genome contigs, we selected CdIFN-\u03b11 for preliminary recombinant expression and bioactivity testing. It would be interesting to compare the antiviral activity of all the camelid IFN\u03b1 subtypes against different camel viruses.",

Many of these viruses encode multiple genes to antagonize or modify the host immune response by interfering with the interferon response, pro-inflammatory cytokine and chemokine pathways. CMLV has been reported to encode a few proteins that inhibit IFN-\u03b3, TNF-\u03b1, and chemokines. CMS-252, a protein similar to VACV B19R secreted by CMLV is reported to bind to IFN-\u03b1 with low inhibitory potency (Duraffour et al., 2011b) . Recombinant camel IFN-\u03b1 proteins hence could be useful both in understanding the immune/counter-immune strategies of host/ virus, as well as for the development of potential biological antivirals for CMLV. The IFN-\u03b11 protein we generated seems to be the first recombinant antiviral camelid-specific type I interferon. Considering the high level of sequence similarity with the predicted IFN-\u03b1 from other species, the dromedary IFN-\u03b1 recombinant proteins could be used in other camelids also.",
