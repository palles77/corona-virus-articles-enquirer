The number of infections did not significantly influence respondents' responses. We identified two broad classes of respondents: those who were mortality averse and those who were expenditure averse. Education was found to be a predictor of group membership. Conclusion Overall, there was considerable support for government interventions to prevent or mitigate outbreaks of emerging infectious diseases, including those that greatly restricted individual liberties, as long as the restrictions showed a reasonable chance of reducing the adverse health effects of the outbreak.",

In the aftermath of the 2009 influenza pandemic, particularly severe criticism was voiced from some European quarters that health authorities and WHO over-reacted in their response to the influenza A(H1N1) pandemic of 2009. 25 Others argued that the prior experiences with SARS-CoV and H5N1 justified a robust response to the influenza A(H1N1pdm09) pandemic in 2009. 22 23 For instance, in Singapore, where SARS-CoV caused 238 infections, 33 deaths and reduced annual GDP by 1%, 26 there was a strong governmental response, with over 8000 contacts of SARS-CoV cases quarantined. 27 Singapore's health authorities used similarly robust measures during the influenza pandemic in 2009, and initially mandated isolation of confirmed cases, quarantining of exposed individuals, and temperature screening in hospitals, public places and ports of entry. 28 This was in spite of the paucity of evidence that such measures would make any difference to the overall course of the pandemic.",

It has to calibrate policy to the public's willingness to accept the trade-offs associated with a given response to the outbreak, and a framework is needed for assessing this while recognising the diversity of views between and within populations as to what they value. This framework must be able to accommodate a diversity of scenarios on the key characteristics of the threat, and the suite of public health interventions available.",

            "text": "Public health policy makers have several constituencies, but chief among these is the populace on whose behalf they make decisions. Yet, while tolerance and potential impact of interventions can (and should be) be assessed through surveys, 29 when it comes to pandemic preparedness, it is remarkable how little is known about what interventions the general population actually wants their governments to undertake. This gap is especially noteworthy due to the considerable personal burden imposed by some interventions and the backlash against what some deemed excessive measures during the 2009 influenza pandemic. 25 30 To this end, we conducted a 'conjoint' discrete choice experiment to explore the Singapore public's willingness to accept certain containment and mitigation strategies under various outbreak scenarios, spanning a range of infection and fatality rates. Specifically, we assess three broad questions: (i) How informed are the public about infectious disease outbreaks and the effectiveness of different interventions? (ii) How much do the public support interventions-quarantine, isolation of contacts, school closure and mass screening-that restrict civil liberties in an outbreak? (iii) How consistent are overall preferences for intervention policies throughout the population? Are there subgroups whose preferences are in opposition to the majority? We hypothesised that the population would be broadly supportive of interventions that restricted their civil liberties, but that they might be averse to monetary impacts of those interventions. Our work was motivated by the past vulnerability of Singapore to a diversity of emerging infectious disease threats such as Nipah virus in the 1990s 31 to SARS-CoV in 2003, 32 Chikungunya in 2008, 33 pandemic influenza A(H1N1pdm09) in 2009 34 and the Zika epidemic in 2016, 35 and its perceived vulnerability to future threats, given its location at the centre of Southeast Asia where various highly pathogenic strains of avian influenza continue to spread, its role as a transport hub, its highly urbanised environment and its tropical climate, which permits year round transmission of many viruses. 36 These results are hence intended to allow policy makers to identify policies which will have high levels of public support and are hence expected to translate into high levels of compliance, while exemplifying a method that can be used to address the same questions in different settings.",

            "text": "Overall, utilities of all participants were high for the more intense control measures, that is, given the same number of infections and deaths, respondents reported preferring mandatory isolation, quarantine and social distancing. It is not clear how effective social distancing measures would be in a mild outbreak, however, as many respondents reported that they would not voluntarily reduce how frequently they go out to eat or shop. It may be the implicit recognition of this that made the majority Open Access of participants recognise that isolation and quarantine should be mandatory rather than voluntary. Results reveal that the preferences of the population are not uniform; respondents could be broadly categorised into two groupings: one group (mortality averse) was strongly motivated to reduce the number of deaths and willing to accept interventions that did so, whereas another (expenditure averse, 37% of our respondents) was tax averse, and not in favour of any measures that might increase their taxes, even at levels comparable to the per capita costs of Singapore's routine dengue vector control programme. 56 Discrete-choice experiments can inform policy makers as to how much support there would be for potentially disruptive measures such as quarantine, isolation and school closures, and what kind of public health information might garner support from those otherwise not in favour. In Singapore, given our findings, this might involve stressing the necessity of such measures to reduce mortality, to co-opt the mortality-averse group, and to minimise the economic impact, to gain support from the sizeable tax-averse group. Studies such as this one can also identify misperceptions among the public that may hinder support for effective control. Two such examples surfaced in our study: (1) temperature screening islandwide received considerable support by our survey participants, although temperature screening at the country's main airport was estimated only to pick up around one imported case in four in 2009, 28 and was increasingly ineffective as the infection became more widespread, 57 and (2) the predicted risk of infectious disease outbreaks was considerably underestimated: 2013 saw \u223c 20 000 dengue infections in Singapore, but the mean forecast risk of an outbreak infecting at least 200 people was a mere 29%. Future studies might evaluate the effect of priming respondents with accurate public health information before eliciting their preferences. We included interventions that would be considered for use in response to an emerging infectious disease, and so did not consider vaccination given the lead time needed to develop a vaccine. For many vaccine-preventable infections, however, decisions about whether to be vaccinated are made by the individual, rather than by the government, and so alternative study designs might be better suited to determining features that lead to vaccine uptake and support, such as standard cross-sectional surveys. 58 Ethical issues regarding loss of liberty during an outbreak were not covered in our experiment, and should be explored in future studies, together with more contextual information on why policies were favoured or not. 59 Beyond its direct application to Singapore, our work holds a wider relevance on how governments and global health authorities can use such methods to inform better management of epidemics and pandemics. It has been argued that, during the influenza pandemic in 2009, the failure of WHO and government health agencies was not so much in their assessment of the severity of the threat or what interventions might be effective against it, but in being able to effectively communicate the risk and the benefits of select mitigation strategies. 60 61 Prior assessment of population level preferences could help identify thresholds of epidemic severity which could serve as triggers for the implementation of more disruptive measures. In addition, information from such surveys could be used to explain the rationale for particular decisions, with hierarchical cluster analysis used to support the targeting of different messages to audiences with different values. Whereas surveys have been performed retrospectively to gauge support for government responses to specific circumstances like the SARS-CoV outbreaks in 2003 and influenza pandemic in 2009, 62 63 our method is the first conjoint analysis that quantifies public support for government interventions over a realistic range of outbreak scenarios and parameters.",

A further limitation is that the study design elicits the public's preferences and trade-offs between known interventions and known outcomes of those interventions. However, at an early stage of an outbreak of a novel pathogen, policy makers face grave uncertainty about the outcomes of interventions because the characteristics of the pathogen's transmission routes and potential, the severity and symptoms of the disease it causes, and the public reaction is unpredictable. As a result, the decisions by policy makers must continue to be based on scientific advice and political imperatives. Surveys such as this one permit a better understanding of those political imperatives in emerging infectious disease outbreaks.",

Each set of options contained one level for each attribute SARS-CoV outbreaks, quarantined suspected cases and enforced the isolation of actual cases. Both of these measures were included as attributes with two levels for each: mandatory and voluntary. The cancellation of mass gatherings was also included as an attribute with levels ranging from no cancellations to the closure of schools and prohibition of other types of mass gatherings. Temperature screening using thermal scanners was used during both the two events in Singapore and was therefore also included with different levels indicating whether the screenings were to be conducted only at border checkpoints, at checkpoints and other sites within Singapore, or not at all. Finally, a monetary attribute was included which posited a hypothetical one-time tax to fund control efforts with the following values: S$15, S$20, S$40 and S$50 (in 2013 S$1\u2248US$0.80). The two remaining attributes described the outcome of an infectious disease outbreak in terms of two metrics: the expected number of infections (five levels ranging from 200 to 1 000 000 cases) and the expected number of infection-related deaths (five levels; 0-180 deaths). Attributes and levels for the survey were determined through literature review, cognitive interviews and piloting a draft instrument (n=50)",
