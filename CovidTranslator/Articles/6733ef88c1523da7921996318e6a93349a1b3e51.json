Coronaviruses are a family of enveloped, single-stranded RNA viruses, with SARS CoV being a new group within this family. Since seroepidemiologic data suggested that SARS CoV had not previously been endemic in humans, it seemed likely that this was a virus of animals that had crossed the species barrier to humans in the recent past. This hypothesis was further supported by anecdotal reports that some patients who had SARS in Guangdong Province in November and December 2002 reported a history of occupational exposure to live, caged animals that are used as exotic \"game food\", a culinary delicacy in southern China . SARS-like coronaviruses were isolated from Himalayan palm civets and from raccoon dogs in one market in Guangdong Province where wild game animals are sold. In addition, persons involved in the wild animal trade in Guangdong had a higher seroprevalence of SARS CoV than unrelated controls . These findings support (but do not prove) that live game animals may be potential sites of interspecies transmission.",

In some instances, fecal-oral modes of transmission may have been implicated, such as in the one well-publicized community outbreak in an apartment complex in Hong Kong. The leading hypothesis is that small virus-containing droplets from the contaminated sewage entered the bathrooms. However, other modes of transmission are the exception, although the SARS virus is hardy enough to last in the environment for several days under experimental conditions. The spread of SARS was initially exponential, with hospital settings serving as amplifiers. SARS was transmitted primarily, but not exclusively, in healthcare settings, generally 5 or more days after the onset of disease and from patients who were severely ill (Donnelly et al., 2003) . Transmission to casual and social contacts is uncommon, but has been described. Asymptomatic or mild infections are rare, and do not appear to contribute to the chain of infection.",

In East Asia, tourist arrivals dropped by 41% between April 1st and 21st compared to the same period in 2002, with the following Asian destinations suffering in particular -China, Hong Kong, Vietnam and Singapore. Over the months of the outbreak, there was a drop of 12 million arrivals in Asia and the Pacific, constituting a 9% drop compared to the previous year. According to Rick Miller, vice president of research and economics at the World Travel & Tourism Council (WTTC), the impact of SARS on these countries has been four or five times the impact of 11 September in the United States. In the first 5 months of 2003, overseas and domestic tourist arrivals in Beijing dropped by 480,000 and 8.7 million, respectively, generating losses as high as 11 billion Yuan (US$1.3 billion). The hotel occupancy rates in Beijing fell down to 10%. Four lakh foreign tourists cancelled their tours to Vietnam in 2003.

On 1 April, a European airline retrenched a group of employees owing to a drop in travellers. Severe decline in customer numbers occurred for Chinese cuisine restaurants in Guangdong, Hong Kong and Chinatowns in North America; a 90% decrease in some cases. Businesses recovered considerably in some cities after promotion campaigns. Hong Kong merchants withdrew from an international jewelry and timepiece exhibition in Switzerland. Swiss officials enforced a full body check of the 1000 Hong Kong participants, which resulted in diplomatic tensions between the two countries. An estimated several hundred million HK dollars in contracts were said to be lost as a result. Some conferences and conventions scheduled for Toronto were cancelled, and the production of at least one movie was moved out of the city.

Of these, approximately 1.8 million were reported as arriving from affected areas; this estimate is likely to be low given the difficulties in tracking travellers and the fact that many airline passengers change planes en route. Inadequate data exist to evaluate the effect of distribution of these notices. Mainland China reported distributing 450,000 notices and detecting four SARS cases that may have been linked to the notices.

In Singapore, there were six imported cases of SARS, of which only the first case led to secondary transmission and eventually to the large outbreak there (Wilder-Smith, Paton, & Goh, 2003a) . After implementation of screening methods at the Singapore airport, no further importation of patients with SARS occurred. In total, 442,973 passengers were screened between 31 March and 31 May 2003, and of those, 136 were sent for further SARS screening and observation, but none was diagnosed as having SARS (Wilder-Smith et al., 2003a) .

An estimated Canadian $7.55 million was invested in airport screening measures in Canada (St John et al., 2005) . SARS has an extremely low prevalence, and the positive predictive value of screening is essentially zero (St John et al., 2005) . Screening at entry points is costly, has a low yield and is not sufficient by itself. However, one may argue that entry screening is justified in light of the major economic, social and international impact that even a single imported SARS case may have. However, new imported SARS cases need not lead to major outbreaks if systems are in place to identify and isolate them efficiently. Rather than investing in airport screening measures to detect rare infectious diseases, investments should be used to strengthen screening and infection control capacities at points of entry into the healthcare system (St John et al., 2005) .",

In the most comprehensive investigation, involving three flights with extensive passenger tracing and laboratory confirmation of index and secondary cases, a wide range of risk was noted. In one extensively investigated flight, in which the secondary attack rate was 18.3%, the risk of infection was increased for persons seated close to the index patient, but most passengers who became infected were seated farther away, even though their individual risk was lower (Olsen et al., 2003; Lim et al., 2004) .",

In conclusion, the overall risk to airline passengers is quite low. Aircraft ventilation systems are believed to be highly efficient at keeping the air free of pathogens, which they do by exchanging the air in passenger cabins every 3-4 min and passing the circulated air through high-efficiency particulate-arresting (HEPA) filters designed to filter out all particles larger than 0.3 \u00d7 1 \u03bcm (Olsen et al., 2003) . The risk of aircraft transmission may have been further reduced, thanks to the implementation of safety measures and exit screening. The WHO reports that no transmission on an airline was identified after 23 March 2003. The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) have published guidelines on how to deal with airline passengers with symptoms suggestive of SARS and how to protect flight crew members and other passengers (www.cdc.gov/ncid/sars/flight_crew_guidelines.htm).",

Droplet precautions include frequent hand washing. A thermometer, gloves and hand sanitizers or antimicrobial hand wipes, possibly face masks should be taken along. The routine use of masks is controversial. With the exception of the Amoy Gardens cluster in Hong Kong, SARS transmission in the community from aerosols or in social settings appears to be very rare. However, isolated cases of transmission in taxis or in a large mass gathering (religious meeting in Toronto) have been reported. To minimize the possibility of infection, close contact with large number of people should be avoided, and visiting hospitals with an ongoing SARS epidemic should be strongly discouraged. Travellers are strongly recommended to be vaccinated against influenza and the rationale for this needs to be explained to them: although the influenza vaccine does not protect against SARS, it will minimize episodes of febrile illness and therefore reduce the number of misdiagnoses and lower the overall incidence of diseases that mimic SARS (Wilder-Smith & Ang, 2003) . Moreover, it will reduce the risk of a febrile episode, which may be picked up at airport screening and lead to delays at the airport or even quarantining.",

These data emphasize two things: first, it is a diagnostic challenge for clinicians trying to diagnose SARS on a background of multiple other causes of common upper respiratory infections; second, travellers are susceptible to infectious respiratory pathogens (Wilder-Smith & Freedman, 2003) . This facilitates not only the spread of SARS, but also the spread of influenza and novel respiratory pathogens yet to emerge. Individual clinicians must be vigilant in detecting suspicious circumstances and reporting to appropriate authorities, especially as the heightened awareness of SARS begins to wane.",

SARS gave a new sense of urgency to the revision, which is (at the time of writing), now close to its completion. Revised IHR should give some teeth to a framework that will facilitate three main public health measures for the containment of SARS and other potential new respiratory pathogens: prevention of subsequent community transmission via early identification and isolation of cases, and provision of technical expertise to allow for the prevention of hospital transmission via effective infection control.",

Communicating clearly the content and meaning of changing travel alerts, advisories and bulletins from the WHO and national authorities is a primary task. Many countries issue alerts or bulletins to provide accurate information about the status of SARS at a destination, and these need to be distinguished from outright travel advisories against non-essential travel to the area.",

In the case of SARS, interventions at a country's border should not detract from efforts to identify and isolate infected persons within the country, monitor or quarantine their contacts, and strengthen infection control in healthcare settings.
