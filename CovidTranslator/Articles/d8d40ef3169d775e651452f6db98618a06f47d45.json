This paper analyzes interactions between three groups in time and space using a classic SIR (susceptible, infected, and recovered) epidemic model. Through social network theory and analog simulation analysis, we utilize data from China's Sina Weibo (a popular social media platform) to conduct empirical research on 101 major incidents in China that occurred between 2010 and 2017. We divide these emergencies into four types-natural disasters, accidents, public health events, and social security events-and conduct a simulation using three examples from each group. The results show that government control of public opinion is both cheaper and more effective when it occurs at the initial stages of an incident. By cooperating with the government, the media can facilitate emergency management. Finally, if netizens trust the government and the media, they are more likely to make cooperative decisions, maintain interest, and improve the management of online public sentiment.",

These 50 bloggers were randomly selected as nodes from among the bloggers who posted early evaluations. We then randomly selected five nodes as initial information publishing sources. Then, five individuals who forwarded or commented on events from each of those five nodes were randomly selected, giving us a 75*75 propagation matrix model. This allowed us to analyze the spatial propagation effect between 75 nodes for each of the 101 emergencies studied. If one node forwards or comments content to another node, the relationship value between those two nodes is 1. If the two nodes have no forwarded comments, then the relationship value is 0. The relationship between a node and itself is 1. We used UCINET software to calculate the density of each event. Fig. 1 shows that information on emergencies begins with network communication. The media publishes information, which attracts netizens, who begin to participate in disseminating the information. During this dissemination period, the emergency is still developing, and information increases geometrically through an increase in media coverage. Over time, as shown in the figures, an increasing number of netizens become concerned about the emergency and the available information, and media communication reaches its peak. At this stage, the government then takes emergency measures that take into consideration the public interest, thereby effectively controlling the evolution of the emergency.",

Some nodes are in a core position while others transmit information, and still others are only bystanders. For example, in Fig. 4 , official media-such as Vista World, Financial Network, Pear Video, and the People's Daily-are at the center of the networks, indicating that these nodes are active in public opinion transmission. They are more vocal and can influence a wider range of people. These are also regulation nodes that are important for the propagation of public opinion during an emergency and that are more able to intervene and control communication between and transmission to other nodes. Fig. 4 and Tables 1 through 4 illustrate that the centrality of natural disasters and public health events do not change drastically with an increase of public opinion heat. Rather, the media has a significant role in guiding nodes during these two types of emergencies: Netizens obtain news on an event directly from official media, such as the People's Daily, in the early stages of an incident. Since they trust this media source, they then quickly spread public opinion by forwarding, commenting upon, and paying attention to official media sources. There are not many intermediate links in the network. As a result, public opinion does not fluctuate very much. After accidents and social security incidents, however, media is not always at the center of a network. Instead, netizens are active in the communication process, and individuals are likely to be the center of networks. This suggests that in these two types of emergencies, netizens are vulnerable to misinformation.",

At the beginning of an emergency, mainstream media play a crucial role in rapid reporting of real information on an emergency, especially accidents and social security incidents. In the early stages of public sentiment evolution, the influence of the media is insufficient, and it is, therefore, necessary for the government to give relevant information to the public. The government also needs to strengthen the public's judgment of information and reduce misinformation. Such methods will reduce the value of information dissemination by individuals and maximize the effectiveness of media communication.",

In the era of big data, the government must handle public opinion incidents quickly, promptly, and efficiently in order to fulfill the public's need to receive information promptly. Otherwise, they may risk the expansion of public opinion networks, which will increase the difficulty in guiding public sentiment as the emergency continues to evolve. Especially in major emergencies involving national security and the safety of lives and property, the government should decisively intervene in publicity control and information dissemination. Moreover, the use of fast and effective media should be maximized to communicate the \"voice\" of the government, conduct quick and positive online guidance, and strengthen communication with the public and the media to ensure the smooth spread of online public sentiment.

The most important measure for the government to effectively control and guide online public sentiment is to build credibility. The speed and transparency of the government's disclosure of emergency information is another key factor: The faster the government discloses information, the greater its transparency and credibility, and the more likely it is to calm rumors and foster the steady evolution of public opinion. Governments must pass information disclosure laws to clarify their responsibility to provide information to the public in emergencies. Meanwhile, an information exchange system between the government and the media, netizens, and other social groups should be established to correct and adjust the government information reporting system. A qualified and dedicated team of government spokespersons should be created, relying on government authority to publish during the early period of online public sentiment after an emergency.",

First, a multi-agent modeling and simulation method is used to simulate interactions between netizens and netizens, between the media and netizens, and between the media and government. This is done to illuminate the evolution of public opinion and the effects of governance over time. Second, an SNA method is used to analyze the characteristics of key node structures and the important actors in the network of public opinion communication during an emergency. Because of the complex factors affecting emergencies and the difficulty in obtaining data, the construction of the model is inaccurate, and the four types of emergencies are analyzed from a time perspective. By enriching the data, we hope to find, through the model, the distribution characteristics of the four types of emergencies and find the root causes of the evolution of public sentiment during emergencies.",

This would be beneficial to netizens as it would reduce loss of interest and improve the comprehensive management of online public sentiment. However, because of the limited ability to acquire data, this paper extracted 75 individuals in the study of the spatial structure of public sentiment evolution, and the data is relatively poor. Moreover, the time evolution model assumed many parameters to be linear, rather than actual changes, which are nonlinear. The accuracy and depth of the research need to be improved.
