This disease is of considerable economic importance and is primarily controlled through biosecurity and immunization with live attenuated and inactivated IB vaccines of various serotypes. In the present study, we tested the safety and efficacy of an attenuated predominant Chinese QX-like IBV strain. The results revealed that the attenuated strain has a clear decrease in pathogenicity for specific-pathogen-free (SPF) chickens compared with the parent strain. Strain YNinoculated birds had clinical signs of varying severity with 30% mortality, while the attenuated group appeared healthy, with less tissue damage. The attenuated strain also had relatively low tissue replication rates and higher antibody levels. The superior protective efficacy of the attenuated strain was observed when vaccinated birds were challenged with a homologous or heterologous field IBV strain, indicating the potential of the attenuated YN (aYN) as a vaccine. Producing a vaccine targeting the abundant serotype in China is essential to reducing the economic impact of IB on the poultry industry.",

            "text": "The main method of protecting chickens from IB is inoculation with both attenuated live and inactivated vaccines. Although inactivated vaccines are cheaper and easier to administer, the poultry industry prefers to use live vaccines rather than inactivated ones, as they are more effective (Huang and Wang, 2006) . Despite widespread vaccination in China and other countries, IB outbreaks still occur sporadically because of little or no cross protection between different IBV serotypes (Cook et al., 2001; Liu et al., 2009 ). Specifically, a new IBV variant has been circulating in China since 1998 (Wang et al., 1998) . This virus has been identified as the QX strain and has been primarily associated with various renal pathologies (Terregino et al., 2008 Zsofia et al., 2009 . Phylogenetic analysis showed that the IBV isolates that clustered with QX were mainly Chinese isolates. These results further indicated that IBV isolates that are prevalent in China were significantly evolutionarily distant from Mass-type strains. However, Mass-type vaccine strains (e.g., H52, H120, Ma5, and W93) are mainly IBV vaccine strains typically administered in China today, which may not be able to provide efficient protection against field strains. Other vaccine strategies including combination of Mass type vaccine with 4/91, Conn type etc., were attempted before and could get a broader protection than the Mass type vaccine alone (Cook et al., 2001 (Cook et al., , 1999 . However, the 4/91 and Conn type vaccine have not been licensed as commercial vaccines in China nowadays. Thus, it will be necessary to rapidly develop new vaccines against the QX-like field strains.",

As previously demonstrated in some reports, cross-protection is poor between different serotypes and genotypes of IBV strains. Consequently, currently available vaccines cannot provide sufficient protection for heterologous challenge Gelb et al., 2005; Liu et al., 2006) . The S1 gene of IBV has serotype-specific and neutralization-specific epitopes. Serotype evolution and the genetic diversity of IBV are monitored by analysis of the S1 gene. The majority of QX-like IBV isolates present in the field in China had poor similarity in the S1 part of the spike protein with vaccine strains, indicating the antigenic differences and large evolutionary distances between vaccine strains and IBV field strains in China (Liu et al., 2006; Zhao et al., 2014) . Despite the widespread use of live attenuated IBV vaccine (mass serotype), such as strains H120, H52, and Ma5, vaccinated chicken flocks usually fail to achieve complete protection against field virulent IBV challenge. The poultry industry has, in recent years, detected an increasing incidence of outbreaks related to QX-like IBV strains of different serotypes in many countries (Abro et al., 2012; Terregino et al., 2008; Valastro et al., 2010; Xu et al., 2007) . Optimal vaccines against circulating IBV strains in China require attenuated vaccines designed from local strains in China. A previous IBV isolate (the YN strain) was passaged 118 times through SPF chicken embryonated eggs. As a result of this process, the virus becomes more adapted to the embryo, reflected by more efficient replication and higher pathogenicity for the embryo (data not shown). This attenuated YN strain was inoculated via the oral or oculonasal route into SPF chickens to compare the tissue tropism and pathogenicity to its parent strain.",

These lesions appeared to damage the host cell, leading to the loss of cellular functions and decreasing immunity, increasing the opportunities for secondary or multiple infections (Davies et al., 2009 ).

We also observed that the viral RNA levels in the tracheas of birds in both groups declined after the peak, then reached another small peak. Loss of ciliated columnar epithelium, and, presumably, the associated viral replication in those cells, is a common lesion with IBV infection (Callison et al., 2006; Geerligs et al., 2011) .

Therefore we invested the efficiency of the YN attenuated strain to determine if it could provide protection against the homologous and heterologous virulent strains. The results indicated that the strain aYN protected SPF birds against morbidity and mortality from challenge with the highly virulent strains YN and SD.",

There was a clear decrease in ciliostasis scores in the YN attenuated vaccinated groups compared with the unvaccinated groups after challenge with homologous and heterologous virulent strains, indicating the YN attenuated strain could protect the respiratory tract efficiently. In addition, virus shedding in the infected chickens is a big challenge to the control of infectious bronchitis virus. It would encourage viral spread among chickens and support virus persistence. Thus the reduction of virus excretion should be taken into consideration when choosing the vaccine type and program. In our experiment, a significant decrease was observed in the vaccinated groups after challenge. We also noticed that the virus shedding inhibition in YN challenged group was more significant than the SD challenged group, which indicating that the vaccine strain could provide a better protection against the challenge with homologous strains.",

The S1 gene is responsible for induction of protective immunity, and small differences in S1 contribute to poor cross protection . It has been shown that a number of amino acid residues in S1 contribute to IBV attenuation (Cavanagh et al., 2005; Liu et al., 2007) . Besides the S1 subunit, the nucleocapsid protein can also induce protective immune responses in chickens (Boots et al., 1992) . Previous studies have shown that amino acid substitutions within the replicase gene may result in attenuation following serial passage in embryonated eggs (Armesto et al., 2009 ). Further genetic investigation will be necessary to determine the key mutations responsible for the attenuation in this sample. Moreover, the stability of the vaccine and its tendency to revert should be investigated in the future study before administration in the field to ensure the security and reliability of this vaccine.",
