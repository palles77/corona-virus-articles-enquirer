Over the past 25 years, the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund (IMF), and the World Trade Organization (WTO) have increasingly dominated policymaking in developing countries, leading to substantial eff ects on health. 1 Furthermore, global threats to health, such as HIV/AIDS, severe acute respiratory syndrome, avian infl uenza, and climate change, need eff ective collective action at the international level. 2 Therefore the system of global governance is of central, and growing, importance to health.",

            "text": "However, global governance is becoming increasingly controversial, particularly in the case of global economic institutions. Controversies have included: the World Bank's and IMF's undemocratic weighted-voting structures; the so-called tradition by which the USA and European Union (EU) eff ectively appoint the respective heads of these organisations; and the abuse of economic and political power by the USA and EU to pressurise developing countries to accept potentially damaging concessions in WTO negotiations. 3, 4 By comparison, the UN has tended to be seen as relatively democratic, neither sharing the IMF's and World Bank's weighted-voting system nor showing the routine circumvention of democratic and transparent processes that characterise the WTO. The UN and its specialist agencies have been criticised as being: starved of resources; increasingly dependent on dis cretionary funding; compromised in their neutrality; and sidelined by the major powers in favour of the World Bank, over which these powers exert greater control. However, criticism of the UN's democratic processes has been more limited, and has focused mainly on the selection processes for agency heads, notably those of WHO. 5, 6 Ilyana Kuziemko and Eric Werker 7 recently highlighted systematic use of aid from the USA and resources from UN agencies (mainly UNICEF) to \"buy\" the votes of countries on the UN Security Council. These researchers reported that countries receive about 59% more US aid and about 8% more UN aid during the time that they are on the UN Security Council than at other times. These fi gures increase to 170% and 53%, respectively, when important issues are at stake. Overall, US$17 million in aid is diverted in a typical year, and $53 million in an important year, for each of seven or eight countries. Aid is at normal levels in the years immediately before and after UN Security Council membership. The additional UN aid is almost entirely attributable to UNICEF, an agency with close links to the US administration and which is (by another consistently observed tradition) headed by a US citizen (currently, former US Agriculture Secretary, Ann Veneman). Kuziemko and Werker's conclusion that these fi ndings are evidence of an attempt by the USA to buy votes on the UN Security Council seems compelling. However, they have not analysed votes to assess how eff ective such eff orts are, citing problems in the methods for trying to doing so, and they have not assessed how the fl ow of aid from other donors is aff ected.",

If successful, such attempts skew international decision-making away from the common good, resulting in outcomes that will be less favourable for those in greatest need. The credibility and legitimacy, and thus the eff ectiveness, of international bodies will be undermined, making it still more problematic to fi nd eff ective solutions to global challenges such as poverty, health, and climate change. Decisions of the UN Security Council, whose remit extends to the legitimate use of military force and economic sanctions, may have profound eff ects on health, as exemplifi ed by the experience in Iraq. [12] [13] [14] Moreover, even if voting patterns are unaff ected, allocation of scarce aid resources according to donors' geopolitical agendas rather than to need or potential eff ect reduces the eff ectiveness of aid in achieving objectives such as poverty reduction and health. 15 In few cases can the health implications be greater than in UNICEF, whose programmes are targeted strongly at health-related activities, such as immunisation and girls' education.",

There is little reason to expect a diff erent outcome at the global level.
