The severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus papain-like protease (PLpro) is a DUB that cleaves ISG15, a twodomain Ub-like protein, and Lys48-linked polyUb chains, releasing diUb Lys48 products. To elucidate this specificity, we report the 2.85 \u00c5 crystal structure of SARS PLpro bound to a diUb Lys48 activitybased probe. SARS PLpro binds diUb Lys48 in an extended conformation via two contact sites, S1 and S2, which are proximal and distal to the active site, respectively. We show that specificity for polyUb Lys48 chains is predicated on contacts in the S2 site and enhanced by an S1-S1 0 preference for a Lys48 linkage across the active site. In contrast, ISG15 specificity is dominated by contacts in the S1 site. Determinants revealed for polyUb Lys48 specificity should prove useful in understanding PLpro deubiquitinating activities in coronavirus infections.",

In these cases, specificity is dictated by direct readout of a particular isopeptide-linkage via binding the primed (S1 0 ) Ub and unprimed, or proximal, (S1) Ub across the DUB active site. In one case, Lys11specificity of the OTUD2 catalytic core is achieved by recognizing S1 0 Ub and S1 Ub across the DUB active site, an activity that is aided by another domain that contacts a third Ub in a distal S2 site (Mevissen et al., 2013) . Lys48-linked Ub chains are highly abundant in cells (Kirkpatrick et al., 2006) , and their conjugation to other proteins targets them for proteasomal degradation (Chau et al., 1989) , but the molecular basis for DUB recognition of Lys48-linked Ub chains remains unclear.",

We report the crystal structure of SARS PLpro bound to a diUb Lys48 -ABP. The structure reveals SARS PLpro DUB recognition of an extended Lys48-linked diUb chain via distinct S1 Ub and S2 Ub binding sites, and biochemical studies show that S2 Ub binding is most important for polyUb processing.

This unique activity is striking when compared to the related MERS PLpro, since they are structurally similar and share 52% amino acid sequence homology (B\u00e1 ez-Santos et al., 2014) . While SARS PLpro efficiently cleaves higher-molecular-weight (HMW) polyUb Lys48 conjugates, it exhibits poor activity in cleavage assays using free diUb chains or mono-or di-ubiquitinated substrates, such as IkBa ( Figure 1A) . These data supported a model whereby SARS PLpro uses distal Ub binding site (S2) to recognize diUb Lys48 across S2-S1 ( Figure 1B ), rather than across S1-S1 0 , as is typical for most DUBs.",

            "text": "To provide evidence for this model, a singly N-terminal biotintagged triUb Lys48 chain ( Figure 1C ) was generated (Figures S1A-S1G) and cleaved using SARS PLpro. Analysis of cleavage intermediates shows that the N-terminal biotin-label is retained on the diUb product ( Figure 1D , right), suggesting that tri-ubiquitin (triUb) recognition requires binding via S2-S1, in a distal-to-proximal direction ( Figure 1C , top schematics). In contrast, cleavage intermediates produced by other USP-family DUBs contain mixtures of mono-and diUb products bearing the biotin tag (Figure S2A) . USP21 CD and USP2 CD show little preference, while MERS PLpro displays a slight preference. We next took advantage of linkage-specific diUb activitybased probes that place warheads at the isopeptide linkage (Figure 1E, ''in-between''; Mulder et al., 2014) or proximal end (Figure 1E, ''distal diUb Lys48 ,'' green, right cartoon; Flierman et al., 2016) . The distal diUb-ABP bears an isosteric non-hydrolyzable triazole linker in lieu of the native isopeptide linkage ( Figure S2B ). In labeling assays with SARS PLpro (Figure 1E ), the distal diUb Lys48 -ABP (green) reacted well, monoUb-ABP (orange) reacted slowly, and the in-between diUb Lys48 -ABP (red) reacted poorly, and quantification shows distal diUb Lys48 -ABP adduct forms most efficiently in comparison to other probes (Figures 1F and S2C) . The observation that SARS PLpro formed adducts least efficiently with the in-between diUb Lys48 -ABP probe (compare to monoUb-ABP), suggests that it might bind the inbetween diUb Lys48 -ABP via S2-S1, preventing it from binding and reacting via S1-S1 0 interactions ( Figure S2D ). Importantly, the in-between diUb Lys48 -ABP efficiently labels other DUBs that do not exhibit diUb preferences ( Figures S2E and S2F ). With the ideal reagent in hand, we set out to determine the structural basis for diUb Lys48 recognition by SARS PLpro.",

The related viral DUB, MERS PLpro, recognizes S1 Ub in a similar manner, yet specific contacts to the S1 Ub-Ile44 patch are not identical (Bailey-Elkin et al., 2014a) . Additionally, SARS PLpro cradles S1 Ub with its fingers domain, with S1 Ub interaction surfaces comprising the largest buried interaction surface area ($890 \u00c5 2 ). In comparison to apo SARS, both structures with monoUb and diUb bound reveal similar displacements of the BL2-loop ( Figure S3E ) that accommodates the Ub C-terminal tail in the active site (Ratia et al., 2014) . When compared to the monoUb-bound SARS PLpro complex, a small conformational change is observed in S1 Ub with respect to displacement of a loop between Ub amino acids 51-57 that is next to Lys48 and the triazole linkage ( Figures S3F and S3G ). To query if displacement could be due to the triazole linkage, our diUb structure was compared to Lys48-linked diUb (PDB 1AAR) revealing that amino acids 51-57 adopt a similar conformation to that observed proximal Ub distal Ub S1 S2 S1' S1 S1 BIOTIN + + S2-S1 / S1' recognition / cleavage S2 /S1-S1' BIOTIN BIOTIN cleavage direction S1 S2 + S2 /S1-S1' BIOTIN S1' Ub-Lys48 and S2 Ub-Gly75 indicating minimal contacts to SARS PLpro.

Other contacts to the S2 Ub core include SARS PLpro residues Asn129, Asn178, and Glu180 from the palm domain, with the latter contacting S2 Ub-Lys11 ( Figure 2E ).",

Nonconservative substitutions of a cluster of residues in SARS PLpro that are in proximity to the S2 Ub-Ile44 hydrophobic patch (e.g., SARS PLpro F70S/E71K/H74G) or individual substitutions F70S and H74G greatly reduce Ub chain cleaving activity by SARS PLpro, as assayed on pentaUb Lys48 ( Figure 3A , top, green; Figure S4B ) and tetraUb Lys48 ( Figure S4C ). In contrast, SARS PLpro N178A/E180K and E180K substitutions, residues that contact S2 Ub-Lys11, have a less pronounced effect on pentaUb Lys48 ( Figure 3A , top, green; Figure S4B ) or tetraUb Lys48 ( Figure S4C ). These data suggest the importance of distal S2 Ub contacts, as the S1 Ub binding surface remains intact in these mutants. Further supporting a dominant role for S2 Ub interactions is the observation that mutation of residues surrounding the S1 Ub-Ile44 patch have a modest effect compared to S2 Ub-Ile44-disrupting mutations for pentaUb Lys48 ( Figure 3A , bottom, blue; Figure S4B ) and tetraUb Lys48 ( Figure S4C ) especially the M209S, R167S, R167S/E168R mutants. The E168R mutant, and a helix-swap mutant that replaces SARS residues with those in MERS PLpro (R167S/E168R+helix), have somewhat diminished activities. And while the N178A/E180K ( S2 Ub-contacting via Lys11) and R167S/E168R+helix mutants ( S1 Ub-contacting via Gln49/Arg42) display diminished polyUb cleaving ability, their defects are less than that observed for the F70S/E71K/ H74G ( S2 Ub-contacting via Ile44) mutant. The catalytic mutant (C112A) has no activity.",

It is worth noting that diUb Lys48 cleavage by SARS PLpro requires 5-fold higher concentration of enzyme compared to tetraUb Lys48 to observe activity. SARS PLpro wild-type (WT) activities were also compared to enzymes carrying mutations in the S1 Ub and S2 Ub binding sites using Lys48-linked diUb Lys48 and tetraUb Lys48 substrates ( Figures 3C and 3D ). As expected, the SARS PLpro S2 Ub mutant (F70S/E71K/H74G) exhibits diminished activity against tetraUb Lys48 ( Figure 3C , top) yet retains WT-level activity on diUb Lys48 ( Figure 3C , bottom). Thus, S2 Ub recognition is dispensable for diUb Lys48 cleavage, consistent with an S1-S1 0 binding mode being relevant for diUb Lys48 cleavage. In contrast, the S1 Ub mutant (R167S/E168R+helix) has diminished diUb Lys48 cleavage activity yet retains the ability to cleave tetraUb Lys48 chains with characteristic accumulation of diUb intermediates ( Figure 3C ). Single point mutants of the composite mutants (F70S for S2 Ub, E168R for S1 Ub) exhibit similar cleavage profiles ( Figure S4C ). These results suggest that mutations predicted to disrupt S1 Ub recognition do not prevent cleavage of tetraUb Lys48 when an intact S2 Ub binding surface is present. As earlier, mutations within SARS PLpro predicted to disrupt contacts to S2 Ub near Lys11 have a modest effect on tetraUb Lys48 cleavage, and combining mutations designed to disrupt both S2 Ub-Ile44 and -Lys11 patches are not additive (data not shown). Additionally, mutations designed to disrupt contacts to S2 Ub, alone or in combination, do not display gain-of-function activity toward diUb Lys48 , suggesting that disrupting S2 Ub interaction does not convert SARS PLpro into a DUB with stronger preference for S1-S1 0 binding.",

Michaelis-Menten kinetic analysis of monoUb-and diUb Lys48 -AMC cleavage by SARS PLpro and its selected S2 Ub and S1 Ub mutants reveals that SARS PLpro cleaves the diUb Lys48 -AMC about $37-fold more efficiently than it cleaves monoUb-AMC ( Figure 3E , black and red, respectively; Table 2 , compare apparent k cat /K M values of 3.3E+04 M \u00c01 s \u00c01 for monoUb-AMC to 1.26E+06 M \u00c01 s \u00c01 for diUb Lys48 -AMC). Moreover, kinetic comparison of SARS PLpro mutants reveals that loss of S2 interactions (F70S/E71K/H74G; Figure 3E , green; Table 2 ) results in an $33-fold loss of catalytic efficiency (k cat and K M could not be measured independently, and the S2 mutant could not be saturated by the diUb Lys48 -AMC substrate, indicative of a binding defect). Thus, the S2 mutant converts SARS PLpro into an S1-dependent, monoUb-based DUB. In contrast, mutation of either the hydrophobic interaction in the S1 Ub site (M209S, Figure 3E , light blue; Table 2 ) or polar contacts to S1 Ub (R167S/E168R, Figure 3E , dark blue; Table 2 ) results in a modest decrease in catalytic efficiency, an effect mainly driven by a 2-to 3-fold increase in K M without a corresponding loss in k cat (Table 2) . Assaying additional point mutants at a single monoUb-or diUb Lys48-AMC substrate concentration mirrors these trends ( Figure S4D , top). Importantly, S2 mutants do not exhibit diminished monoUb-AMC cleavage rates ( Figure S4D , bottom), consistent with gel-based experiments, as they maintained activity when processing diUb Lys48 into monoUb. Structure-based alignment of the Lys48 linkage visible in the triazole-linked diUb Lys48 -ABP$SARS-PLpro crystal structure to native Lys48 in free diUb Lys48 (PDB: 1AAR) suggests that the triazole-linkage mimics the distance and geometry of a native isopeptide-bond ( Figure S4E ). To test if the triazole linkage is a good functional mimic of the native isopeptide-bond, we generated a native isopeptide-linked diUb Lys48 -AMC reagent (Figure S4F ) and assayed initial cleavage rates for triazole-linked and native diUb Lys48 -AMC substrates ( Figure S4G) . Results indicate that the triazole linker is a faithful mimic of the isopeptide bond as initial cleavage rates are similar (despite native diUb Lys48 -AMC being contaminated with monoUb-AMC precursor; see Figure S4F ). SARS PLpro could not be saturated using the native substrate due to insufficient quantities, so inhibition studies were performed with triazole-linked or native isopeptide diUb Lys48 -AMC as substrates to calculate inhibition constants (K i ) using Lys48linked Ub chains as inhibitors.

Although dynamic, diUb conformations can be stabilized by interactions between Ub molecules, sometimes templated by their interacting partners (Ye et al., 2012) . Linkage specificity for most DUBs characterized thus far is determined by contacts across the protease active site with diUb occupying S1-S1' sites (Keusekotten et al., 2013; Mevissen et al., 2013; Sato et al., 2008 Sato et al., , 2015 . As shown previously, SARS PLpro is poor at cleaving diUb and does not strictly require a specific linkage across S1-S1 0 (B\u00e9 k\u00e9 s et al., 2015). Given the extended conformation of diUb Lys48 observed in complex with SARS PLpro and the paucity of contacts to the diUb Lys48 linkage ( Figure 2C ), we hypothesized that SARS PLpro might indirectly sense linkage specificity by requiring that diUb occupies both S2 Ub and S1 Ub sites, a requirement that would place limits on the type of chain that could be accommodated because of differences in chain topology and distance between individual Ub molecules relative to the two Ub binding sites.",

Although not as efficient as diUb Lys48 -ABP, diUb Lys27 -ABP exhibited better labeling efficiency compared other linkage-specific diUb-ABPs, which reacted at levels similar to monoUb-ABP ( Figure 4A and S5A). Since covalent activitybased probes are very reactive, we also tested linkage-specific diUb-AMC substrates by analyzing initial cleavage rates by SARS PLpro. These results suggest that SARS PLpro activity is highly restricted to diUb Lys48 -AMC cleavage ( Figures 4B and  S5B ) as diUb Lys48 -AMC is cleaved $100-fold faster compared to other linkages. Each chain-forming residue in S1 Ub is available for conjugation in our diUb Lys48 -SARS PLpro complex (Figure 4C ), but the distance between S1 Ub-Lys48 and the SARS-Phe70 S2 Ub binding site is closest (26 \u00c5 ) with each of the other sites requiring an additional 10 to 15 \u00c5 to span between the conjugated lysine and S2 Ub binding site ( Figure S5C ). This raised the possibility that linkage-specificity across S2-S1 is enforced by restricting access to other topologies by requiring that SARS PLpro read the distance between diUb Ile44 hydrophobic patches via S2-S1 ( Figure 2B ), a requirement that is only satisfied by chains carrying Lys48 linkages. Accordingly, assaying homotypic linkage-specific tetra-ubiquitin (tetraUb) chains in endpoint cleavage assays also confirmed SARS PLpro to be Lys48-specific ( Figure 4D ).",

We noticed greater defects for diUb Lys48 -AMC cleavage for some SARS PLpro mutants (especially E180K, N178A/E180K, E168R, and R67S/E168R+helix) compared to gel-based assays using polyUb Lys48 substrates.

            "text": "To determine if a Lys48-linkage was also preferred across S1-S1 0 ( Figure 4E ), we assayed SARS PLpro and its S2 Ub-Ile44 mutant (F70S/E71K/H74G) for cleavage of homotypic Lys48and Lys63-linked tetraUb chains and a mixed linkage tetraUb chain consisting of two Lys48-linked dimers linked by Lys63 (see schematics in Figure 4F ). This latter mixed chain could be recognized by SARS PLpro in S2-S1, but its cleavage would require accommodation of a Lys63-linkage across S1-S1 0 . A time course reveals that SARS PLpro readily cleaves homotypic Lys48 tetraUb chains but is inactive on homotypic Lys63 tetraUb chains. Interestingly, the mixed chain is cleaved when the Lys63 linkage is presented across S1-S1 0 , but only when an intact S2 site is present ( Figure 4G ). Initial cleavage rates ( Figure 4H) show that SARS PLpro is $5-fold slower in cleaving the mixed chain compared to the homotypic Lys48-linked chain, suggesting some specificity for a Lys48 linkage across S1-S1 0 . More importantly, the S2 Ub-Ile44 mutant exhibits faster cleavage rates on homotypic Lys48 chains than on mixed or on homotypic Lys63linked chains (Figures 4G and 4H ). Taken together, these data suggest a measurable specificity for Lys48 across S1-S1 0 , even when diUb Lys48 recognition via S2-S1 is compromised. Thus, Lys48-specificity of SARS PLpro is enforced by S2-S1 recognition but complemented by a preference for Lys48 linkages across S1-S1 0 , suggesting that SARS PLpro would be most active on polyUb Lys48 chains. Consistent with the hypothesis of S2-S1-S1 0 recognition of polyUb Lys48 chains, di-and monoUb-conjugated IkBa accumulates during cleavage by SARS PLpro (Figure 1D , IkBa), while unmodified IkBa remains static ( Figure 1D , lighter exposure IkBa). These data suggest that SARS PLpro acts efficiently on polyUb Lys48 chains in a diUb-dependent manner yet generates mono-and diUb-conjugated substrate remnants that may no longer represent its preferred substrate.",

Because the S2 binding site is important for diUb Lys48 cleavage as described here and as proposed previously (Ratia et al., 2014) , we sought to directly compare mutations in S2 and S1 of SARS PLpro and their impact on ISG15 cleavage activity. SARS PLpro S1 Ub and S2 Ub mutants were used to cleave ISG15-AMC using Michaelis-Menten kinetics ( Figure 5A ). Mutations have contrasting effects for ISG15-AMC cleavage (Figure 5A ; Table 2 ). The S1 polar mutant ( Figure 5A , dark blue) exhibits greater defects for ISG15-AMC cleavage with minimal effects diUb Lys48 -AMC cleavage. In contrast, the S2 mutant exhibits major defects for diUb Lys48 -AMC cleavage with less severe defects in ISG15-AMC cleavage. To confirm these differential effects, we utilized lysates prepared from IFNb/MG132-treated cells that contained polyUb Lys48 chains and ISG15-conjugated substrates and added recombinant SARS PLpro mutants (Figure 5B ). Analyzing loss of HMW polyUb Lys48 -conjugates and the appearance of free ISG15, indicative of cleavage of ISGylated substrates, reveals contrasting effects for S2 and S1 mutants ( Figure 5C ). While the S2 mutant compromises polyUb Lys48 chain, but not ISG15 cleavage, the S1 mutant has the opposite effect. Finally, we compared other SARS PLpro mutants for cleavage of diUb Lys48 -AMC and ISG15-AMC (Figure S6B) . Overall, S2 Ub site mutants (green) show minimal loss of ISG15-AMC cleavage activity, while S1 Ub mutants (blue), particularly those containing the E168R mutation, have a pronounced loss-of-function effect. Thus, ISG15 recognition appears more dependent on interactions within S1 and perhaps an alternative S2, while diUb Lys48 recognition is more dependent on contacts within S2. It is difficult to rationalize these effects in the absence of a structure of ISG15 bound to SARS PLpro, but it appears clear that ISG15 recognition differs in details when compared to diUb Lys48 recognition ( Figure S6C ).",

Here, we reveal the structural basis for diUb Lys48 recognition and specificity by SARS PLpro. Coupled with mutational, biochemical and kinetic data, our structure helps to explain the strict Lys48linkage specificity exhibited by this viral DUB, which is primarily enforced by engaging the diUb module within S2-S1, and enhanced by a slight preference for Lys48-linked Ub across S1-S1 0 ( Figure 5D ). To our knowledge, the diUb Lys48 -SARS PLpro structure represents the only available structure of a linkage-specific DUB bound to a Lys48-linked Ub chain, a result enabled by recently developed diUb activity-based probes (Flierman et al., 2016) .",

This mode of Ub chain recognition has only been reported for the catalytic core of OTUD2, where an additional bind-ing site mediates interaction with a Lys11-linked diUb (Mevissen et al., 2013) . Through modeling, mutational analysis, and the crystal structure of a monoUb-bound SARS PLpro, the Mesecar group suggested that SARS PLpro is an S2-S1 mode DUB (Ratia et al., 2014) and that the distal Ub would be recognized by a hydrophobic surface in SARS PLpro, involving Phe70. Our current study illuminates the structural basis for this interaction. We provide biochemical evidence that the S2 Ub interface has a dominant role in diUb Lys48 recognition and polyUb chain cleaving activity, since mutating the distal S2 Ub recognition surface is more detrimental than disrupting the proximal S1 Ub recognition surface. We also provide evidence that SARS PLpro Lys48specificity is complemented by a preference for Lys48-linked chains across S1-S1 0 .",

(D) Schematic representation of SARS PLpro substrate specificity. Dashed lines can indicate the -AMC substrate, a non-Lys48-linked Ub unit, or a protein substrate. See also Figure S6 . 2016). As such, it is likely that the virus has already achieved its full replicative potential before SARS PLpro would encounter ISG15. Additionally, the function of substrate-conjugated ISG15 in anti-viral immunity in humans is now in question (Bogunovic et al., 2012) , as a non-conjugatable form of ISG15 was shown to have similar activities as WT ISG15, likely via stabilization of USP18 (Zhang et al., 2015) . Given the preference for polyUb Lys48 and diUb Lys48 over ISG15, it appears likely that polyUb Lys48 -conjugated substrates are the primary cellular targets of SARS PLpro. These observations suggest that SARS PLpro activities against ISG15 targets may not be as relevant for coronavirus infection as previously thought.",
