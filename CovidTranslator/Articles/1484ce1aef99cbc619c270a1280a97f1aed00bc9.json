A Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) model was developed and experimentally validated. The developed CFD model was used to calculate the spatial distributions of the mean age and mean residual lifetime of air in the bus environment and evaluate the efficiency of the bus ventilation system. Additionally, the passengers' exposures to a variety of environmental conditions were experimentally monitored in \"real world\" field campaigns using the Harvard University shuttle bus system. Real time continuous monitoring systems were used to assess indoor environmental quality in the buses. It was found that CO levels were very low, while the levels of particulate matter varied and were influenced by the ambient air penetrated into the bus through the operation of the doors and the ventilation system. The CO 2 level was found elevated and greatly affected by occupancy conditions. The elevated CO 2 level indicates that the current bus ventilation is insufficient to dilute air pollutants in the bus especially under heavy occupancy conditions. This lack of sufficient ventilation indicates an elevated risk for airborne transmitted diseases in such a popular public transportation system.",

In a study performed in Munich, Germany showed that the concentrations of PM 10 in buses and trams depended on the ambient sources and the road traffic conditions [4] . In a similar study performed in another urban setting, Guangzhou, China, the parameters such as poor vehicle emission controls, poor vehicle maintenance and high-density traffic conditions were linked to poor indoor air quality in buses. Furthermore, it was found that the concentration levels of carbon monoxide (CO) and PM 10 in buses could be lowered substantially by using a HVAC system [5] . This is due to the \"protective\" effect of mechanically ventilated and air-conditioned buses which results to a lower indoor penetration factor for a variety of air pollutants (CO, PM 2.5 , PM 10 , etc) [6] . Chan [3] also reported that CO 2 concentration could be up to 10 times higher than outdoor concentrations under overcrowded conditions, which is usually the case during rush hours. However, there are a limited number of studies focusing on the effect of ventilation strategies on diluting or removing air pollutants generated inside the buses.",

Under a steady state condition, this is equivalent to the concentration averaged over the exhaust opening.

It resulted in an air exchange rate of 57.6 ACH based on the assumption that there was 100% outside air supplied in the bus and no air recirculation which may not be the case in real world operations. In addition, the previous studies reported high ACH in automobiles. For example, the air exchange rate was measured between 36.3 and 47.5 ACH in an automobile with windows and doors closed and ventilated on 100% fresh air under stationary conditions [29] , and averagely 92 ACH at a speed of 105 Km/h [30] . Therefore, the air exchange rate of 57.6 ACH agrees with the published studies.",

Fig. 3 shows the spatial distribution of air velocity in the bus. As shown in cross section AeA 0 , the air close to the front windshield was heated and moved upward, an indication of a \"drafty\" condition in the proximity of the driver. Moreover, an eddy was generated in the mid upper region as shown in cross section BeB 0 . In cross section DeD 0 , a large eddy was shown at each side of the bus. These eddies are indicative of the highly turbulent nature of the flow in the bus environment. However, overall, the air velocities were mostly distributed under 0.3 m/s in the bus. This is almost satisfactory based on the ASHRAE Standard 55-2004 [24] , which has a limit of 0.2 m/s for air velocity. Fig. 4 shows the spatial distribution of air temperature in the bus environment. Air temperatures were within AE1 C of the set point (20.2 C) in the passenger compartment with the exception of the area close to the windows and floor. As shown in cross sections BeB 0 and CeC 0 , large air temperature gradients were present close to the floor, primarily because of the high thermal losses and the very poor air circulation under the seats. The same large temperature gradients were also shown close to the front windshield and the floor in the driver's space. there was not a great agreement between measured and simulated results. This is expected since it is a known limitation of the standard wall function used in the model for the wall surfaces covered by a low Reynolds number turbulent flow. This might be also attributed to a cold air infiltration close to the floor, which was not considered in the CFD model. Fig. 6 shows the spatial distribution of the mean age of air in the bus. For the driver's breathing zone, the mean age of air was calculated to be generally in 62e86.8 s. In the front compartment, it was mainly in the range of 49.6e62 s. In the rear compartment, it was mostly less than 62 s (with the exception of the area involved in the developed eddy as shown in Fig. 3(d) ). It is worth to point out that in general, fresh air can reach most of the area covering passengers' breathing zone within 74.4 s.",

It is necessary to point out that this is under the assumption that the measured air temperature in the bus is equal to the operative temperature and the clothing conditions of the passengers and drivers is 1 Clo as stated in the ASHRAE standard. Operative temperature was not measured in the field experiments and it can be higher than the air temperature if thermal radiation is considered. Therefore, Fig. 10 is considered just an approximation of the thermal comfort conditions in the bus. As shown in Fig. 10 , most of the results were distributed at the \"warmer side\" of the thermal comfort zone but still in the comfort zone based on the ASHRAE standard 55-2004.

It usually varied from around 1000 ppm, and sometimes reached the levels of over 2000 ppm. It is worth to point out that based on the guidelines of the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) for indoor environments, CO 2 concentration levels higher than 1000 ppm is an indication of inadequate ventilation [25] . Furthermore, Fig. 11 reveals that CO 2 concentration levels in the bus were linked with the passenger occupancy. As it was expected, the CO 2 concentration level increased with higher occupancy load. Moreover, the CO 2 concentration level decreased sharply when the doors were open and increased soon after doors were closed in most cases due to the dilution effect from infiltrating air. The CO concentration levels were below 1.9 ppm, much lower than the 8-hour average limit of 9 ppm, which was recommended by the US National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS). Additionally, as it is shown in Fig. 12 , the CO concentration level generally reached its peak values when the doors were open to load and unload passengers. This is a clear indication of the influence of the traffic conditions in the street on the CO concentration level.",

As it is shown in Fig. 13 , PM 2.5 concentration generally did not exceed 20 mg/m 3 except for the \"heavy traffic hours\" in the morning and afternoon (before 9:30AM and after 14:00PM). It is worth pointing out that PM 2.5 concentrations during peak hours were found to be an order of magnitude higher. This is due to the high traffic conditions during peak hours and PM 2.5 particles are well correlated with mobile sources (traffic conditions). Similar to the CO concentration level, the PM 2.5 concentration level reached its highest values when the doors were open to load and unload passengers, a clear indication of particle penetration from outdoors. Similar trend for the PM 10 concentration level is shown in Fig. 14 .",

Their concentration levels were always very small when the doors were closed and generally reached their peak values when the doors were open. Since there are no indoor sources of CO, the only reasonably explanation for this change is that the use of mechanical ventilation in the bus provided a \"shielding effect\" in terms of particulate matter and CO. This agrees with the results from the previous studies on air-conditioned buses [6] . However, the CO 2 concentration levels were found to be usually high and not in compliance with indoor environmental guidelines and standards. This is an indication of inadequate ventilation that is linked to an increased risk for airborne transmitted diseases. The simulation results also confirmed the lack of ventilation efficiency and found the mean residual lifetime of air in the bus for the breathing zone of passengers to exceed 112 s in some areas of the bus.

The high CO 2 concentration levels found in the field campaigns is a good indicator of insufficient venitlation in the buses.
