The infiltration of neutrophils into granulomatous lesions is unusual for a viral disease, but it is a typical finding of FIP. This study aimed to investigate the reason for the lesions containing neutrophils in cats with FIP. Neutrophils of cats with FIP were cultured, and changes in the cell survival rate were assessed. In addition, the presence or absence of neutrophil survival factors was investigated in specimens collected from cats with FIP. Furthermore, it was investigated whether macrophages, one of the target cells of FIPV infection, produce neutrophil survival factors (TNF-alpha, GM-CSF, and G-CSF). We showed that virus-infected macrophages overproduce neutrophil survival factors, and these factors act on neutrophils and up-regulate their survival. These observations suggest that sustained production of neutrophil survival factors by macrophages during FCoV infection is sufficient for neutrophil survival and contributes to development of granulomatous lesions.",

FCoV consists of three major proteins: nucleocapsid (N) protein, membrane (M) protein and peplomer spike (S) protein [23] . FCoV is classified into serotypes I and II according to the amino acid sequence of its S protein [19, 20] . Both serotypes consist of two biotypes: feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) virus (FIPV) and feline enteric coronavirus (FECV). Thus, there are types I and II FECV and FIPV in FCoV. FECV is asymptomatic in cats, but FIPV causes FIP. It has been proposed that FIPV arises from FECV by mutation [8, 29, 37] , but the exact mutation and inducing factors have not yet been clarified. FIP is a fatal disease, characterized by vasculitis associated with granulomatous inflammation containing B cells, neutrophils and macrophages. The infiltration of neutrophils into granulomatous lesions is unusual for a viral disease, but it is a typical finding of FIP [28] .",

The possibility of feline vascular endothelial cell injury caused by metalloproteinase-9 and TNF-alpha produced by FIPV-infected monocytes has also been reported [12] . We reported that virus replication in macrophages induced TNF-alpha production, and the TNF-alpha produced was involved in aggravation of the FIP pathology: TNF-alpha produced by FIPV-infected macrophages was involved in lymphopenia and an increase in the level of the cellular receptor of type II FIPV, aminopeptidase N [34] . TNF-alpha reportedly inhibits neutrophil apoptosis [22] , suggesting its involvement in the infiltration of neutrophils into granulomatous lesions in cats with FIP, but this has not yet been clarified. It is also unclear whether FIPV-infected macrophages/monocytes produce factors other than TNFalpha that are related to the survival of neutrophils.",

The transfer of peripheral blood neutrophils to marginal tissues, destruction of neutrophils due to excess antibody production, and direct cell death caused by viral infection are considered to be the causes of neutropenia [3, 16, 18, 19] . In human immunodeficiency virus and canine parvovirus infections, a reduced neutrophil count has been suggested to allow severe bacterial infection [14, 15] . Feline immunodeficiency virus and feline panleucopenia virus infections also affect stromal cells in the bone marrow, thus leading to a decreased production of neutrophils [17, 26] . In contrast, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus, which belongs to the same family as FIPV, can also cause neutrophilia [39] . Neutrophilia has been also reported in cats with FIP [25] . Paltrinieri [24] reported that cytokines accelerate the delivery of neutrophils to the inflamed lesions, thereby prolonging the lifespan of circulating neutrophils. He also reported that the apoptosis of neutrophils is delayed by cytokines, thus increasing the life of neutrophils in lesions. It is likely that neutrophilia in cats with FIP is associated with the infiltration of neutrophils into granulomatous lesions. However, there seems to be no established theory to explain the infiltration of neutrophils into granulomatous lesions in cats with FIP. In humans, the lifespan of neutrophils is short. When neutrophils are isolated from peripheral blood and cultured in vitro, apoptosis is induced, and about half of the cells die within 24 h [27] . When neutrophils isolated from peripheral blood of SPF cats were cultured for 24 h, more than 60% died, suggesting that feline neutrophils also die due to apoptosis, similar to human neutrophils. Furthermore, coculture with specimens from FIP cats increased the survival rate of neutrophils, suggesting that the production of factors involved in the survival of neutrophils is enhanced in FIP cats, and these factors act on neutrophils and prolong their lifespan.",

These cytokine mRNA levels were also elevated in macrophages infected with FIPV and MAb 6-4-2, clarifying the presence of neutrophil survival factors in the macrophage culture supernatant. It was suggested that: (1) FIPV-infected macrophages release TNF-alpha, GM-CSF, and G-CSF in response to virus replication, and (2) these cytokines act on neutrophils and prolong their survival. We previously reported that FIPV-infected macrophages produced TNFalpha and B-cell differentiation/survival factors, and these factors may have been involved in lymphopenia and hypergammaglobulinemia [33] [34] [35] . Kipar et al. [12] suggested that FIPV-infected monocytes are involved in feline vascular endothelial cell injury. Cytokines and chemical mediators produced by FIPV-infected macrophages/monocytes may play an important role in the pathogenesis of FIP in cats. Fig. 5 The culture supernatant of FIPV-infected macrophages promotes neutrophil survival. SPF-cat-derived alveolar macrophages (2 9 10 6 cells) were cultured with medium alone, FIPV, or FIPV and MAb 6-4-2. The culture supernatant was collected after 72 h. The virus titer in the culture supernatant was measured by the plaque assay method (left). The neutrophils of SPF cats (1 9 10 6 ml -1 ) were cultured at 37\u00b0C for 24 h in the presence of each culture supernatant (final dilution of 1:5), and cell viability was assessed by the WST-8 assay (right). n = 6. ND not detected Fig. 6 Relationship between TNF-alpha, GM-CSF, and G-CSF mRNA expression and FIPV replication in macrophages. SPF-catderived alveolar macrophages (2 9 10 6 cells) were cultured with medium alone, FIPV, or FIPV and MAb 6-4-2. The cells were collected at 0 h (as a control) and 72 h. The intracellular TNF-alpha, GM-CSF, and G-CSF mRNA expression levels were measured by RT-PCR. TNF-alpha, GM-CSF, and G-CSF mRNA were quantitatively analyzed in terms of the relative density value to mRNA for the housekeeping gene GAPDH. n = 6 Neutrophil survival factors produced by macrophages in cats 779 TNF-alpha, GM-CSF, and G-CSF are cytokines inhibiting the apoptosis of neutrophils [5, 13, 21, 22] . These cytokines are secreted by macrophages and T cells. When these cytokines act on neutrophils, the intracellular apoptosis-inhibitory protein level increases, whereas the apoptosis-promoting protein level decreases, prolonging the survival of neutrophils [5, 38] . In inflammatory diseases, such as cystic fibrosis and Kawasaki disease, the pathological condition is aggravated as the survival time of neutrophils is prolonged [5, 36] . Moreover, the pathological aggravation of inflammatory diseases is associated with protease and reactive oxygen species produced by neutrophils [6, 32] . These mediators may also be produced in excess and aggravate the granulomatous lesions in FIP cats. We are now progressing with studies on the expression of apoptosis-inhibitory and -promoting proteins in neutrophils of FIP cats.",

Addie et al. [1] reported that FCoV re-infection of anti-FCoV antibody-positive domestic cats might not result in the development of ADE. The involvement of neutrophils in the enhancement of FIPV production in macrophages and the influence of macrophages on neutrophil survival should be investigated further.",
