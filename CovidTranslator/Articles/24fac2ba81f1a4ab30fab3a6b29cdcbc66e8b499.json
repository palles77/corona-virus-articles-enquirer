In the past few decades, we have witnessed an explosion in our understanding of the mechanisms underlying antigen presentation, immune recognition of infected cells, cellular sensing of pathogens, and signalling pathways that induce antimicrobial states in infected cells. Surprisingly, however, microbiologists and immunologists have long overlooked one of the greatest challenges that the immune system faces in dealing with intracellular pathogens -that is, the problem of how to dispose of a microorganism without disposing of the entire infected cell. A seemingly simple strategy to tackle this challenge is now beginning to unveil itself. Mammalian cells use an evolutionarily conserved lysosomal degradation pathway known as autophagy to selectively dispose of intracellular pathogens.",

            "text": "Autophagy also functions in diverse aspects of immunity [5] [6] [7] . Although the term autophagy means 'to digest oneself ' , it is now clear that the autophagy pathway also eliminates intracellular pathogens, including viruses, parasites and bacteria (a process sometimes referred to as xenophagy) [7] [8] [9] [10] . The autophagic sequestration of viral components can also fuel MHC class II presentation of endogenous antigens 11 and the production of type I interferons (IFNs) in response to Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) signalling 12 . Furthermore, autophagy may directly affect T-cell homeostasis 13, 14 . More speculatively, autophagy may have a role in the prevention of autoimmunity and inflammatory disorders [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] . Here, we provide an introduction to the molecular mechanisms of autophagy, discuss the major recent advances in autophagy and immunity, and highlight important unanswered questions in the field. Autophagy: a lysosomal degradation pathway There are several morphologically and functionally distinct forms of autophagy, including macroautophagy (herein referred to as autophagy), microautophagy, chaperone-mediated autophagy and others that involve the selective degradation of specific organelles (such as peroxisomes, mitochondria and the endoplasmic reticulum). During the initiation of autophagy, a damaged organelle or a portion of cytosol is sequestered in a structure known as the isolation membrane or phagophore (FIG. 1a) . The phagophore then becomes enlarged during the elongation stages by the addition of new membrane -the origin of which is still unclear. The phagophore seals to form an autophagosome, an organelle that is distinguished from the conventional phagosome by the presence of a double delimiting membrane (two lipid bilayers) and intra-lumenal cytoplasmic content. During maturation, autophagosomes fuse with lysosomes to form autolysosomes in which the captured material is degraded. The capture of intracellular pathogens is thought to follow a similar path (FIG. 1b) , although the sequestration of microorganisms during autophagy has not been studied as extensively as that of cellular contents. Most cells undergo some level of autophagy while adjusting their biomass, removing protein aggregates or eliminating damaged organelles (such as mitochondria). The classical signalling pathways that regulate autophagy have been reviewed extensively elsewhere 21, 22 , whereas signals of particular relevance to immunity are discussed later. Key players in autophagy regulation are the serine/threonine kinase mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR; also known as FRAP1) and the class I and class III phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI3Ks). Two well-characterized stimuli that induce autophagy are amino-acid starvation and growth-factor withdrawal 2 . In response to growth-factor stimulation, class I PI3Ks generate phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate (PtdIns(3,4,5)P 3 ) on the plasma membrane by phosphorylating phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns(4,5)P 2 ) and in turn PtdIns(3,4,5)P 3 activates mTOR, thereby repressing autophagy. The class III PI3K vPS34 (also known as PIK3C3) generates phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate (PtdIns3P) by phosphorylating The cellular events during digestion of self constituents or intracellular pathogens follow three distinct stages: initiation (formation of the phagophore), elongation (growth and closure) and maturation of a double membrane autophagosome into an autolysosome. a | Autophagy sequesters and removes cellular constituents from the cytosol, including surplus or damaged organelles from the cytosol. b | Autophagy can eliminate bacteria (free in the cytosol or inside a phagosome), viruses and protozoan parasites in a manner similar to the elimination of self constituents.",

In cellular starvation settings, autophagy functions to preserve cellular bioenergetics by providing metabolic substrates (obtained through bulk cytoplasmic degradation), which maintains macromolecular synthesis and ATP production. Another important function of autophagy that probably underlies its protective role against diverse pathologies is its ability to perform 'routine housecleaning' and also to clean-up toxic or damaged cytoplasmic constituents, a process that may have more selectivity than autophagy induced by cell starvation. This function of autophagy contributes to its protection against neurodegenerative disease; it has a basal role in preventing the abnormal accumulation of ubiquitylated protein aggregates and it specifically degrades toxic aggregate-prone mutant polyglutamine expansion proteins. The degradation of damaged mitochondria and other organelles also may underlie the antiageing effects and the tumour suppressor effects of autophagy, by helping to reduce genotoxic stress and to prevent DNA damage and genomic instability. In parallel to cleaning-up endogenous cellular constituents, autophagy cleans up intracellular microorganisms, thereby protecting against disease caused by intracellular pathogens. Autophagy also can selectively deliver microbial genetic material and antigens to the innate and adaptive immune systems. Some of these effects on immune regulation and bacterial clearance may explain the recently uncovered genetic linkage between autophagy genes and susceptibility to Crohn's disease.",

The beclin-1-vPS34 autophagy complex can be activated by the beclin-1-interacting partners, uvRAG (uv radiation resistance associated gene) 26 and AMbRA1 (activating molecule in beclin-1-regulated autophagy) 27 , and inhibited by another beclin-1-interacting partner, bCL-2 (b-cell lymphoma 2) 28 . Pharmacological induction of autophagy can be achieved using rapamycin, a drug that inhibits mTOR activity 29 , whereas pharmacological inhibition of autophagy can be achieved using 3-methyladenine, a drug that inhibits class III PI3K activity 30 . It is noteworthy, however, that as mTOR and class III PI3Ks have pleiotropic cellular functions, both of these drugs are potent, but not specific, regulators of autophagy. Knockdown of expression of autophagy-related genes by small interfering RNA (siRNA) is therefore an indispensable tool for selectively probing the role of autophagy in defined biological processes. The execution of autophagy is mediated by evolutionarily conserved proteins known as the autophagy-related (ATG) proteins 31 . The molecular mechanisms by which this group of proteins mediates autophagy has been the subject of recent reviews 3,32-34 and is depicted schematically in FIG. 2. Autophagosomal membrane formation and expansion is facilitated by two specialized protein conjugation systems (FIG. 2) , the ATG8 (known as LC3 in mammals) system and the ATG12 system. This results in the carboxy-terminal conjugation of LC3 to the lipid phosphatidylethanolamine (Pe) and the localization of lipidated LC3 (LC3-II; also known as ATG8-Pe) to autophagic membranes. Membrane-associated LC3-II has become the most universally used marker for the detection of membranes that are undergoing autophagy. Interestingly, LC3 interacts with p62 (sequestosome-1; also known as SQSTM1), a protein that recognizes polyubiquitylated protein aggregates (that are too big Autophagy is regulated by a set of autophagy-related proteins (ATG proteins). In the absence of amino acids or in response to other stimuli, ATG1 and a complex of the class III PI3K (phosphoinositide 3-kinase) VPS34 and beclin 1 lead to the activation of downstream ATG factors that are involved in the initiation (a), elongation (b) and maturation (c) of autophagy. a | In amino-acid-rich conditions, VPS34 contributes to mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) activation and inhibition of ATG1 and autophagy. The sources of membrane for autophagosome initiation and elongation may include those containing the only known membrane integral ATG protein ATG9, redistributing between a resting location to autophagosomes in an ATG1-and PI3K-dependent manner. ATG9 redistribution may depend on ATG18, which binds phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate (PtdIns3P). b | The elongation and shape of the autophagosome are controlled by two protein (and lipid) conjugation systems, similar to the ubiquitylation systems: the ATG12 and LC3 (also known as ATG8)-phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) conjugation pathways, which include E1-activating and E2-conjugating enzymes. ATG12 is initially conjugated to ATG7 (an E1-activating enzyme) and then is transferred to the E2-like conjugating enzyme ATG10. This intermediate presents ATG12 for conjugation to an ATG5 lysine residue. The ATG5-ATG12 conjugate, stabilized non-covalently by ATG16, triggers oligomerization on the outside membrane of the growing autophagosome, and enhances LC3 carboxy-terminal lipidation through the LC3 conjugation system. Upon autophagosome closure, ATG5-ATG12-ATG16 and LC3 (delipidated by ATG4) are recycled. c | LC3 associated with the lumenal membrane remains trapped in the autophagosome and is degraded during maturation into the autolysosome, which involves fusion of autophagosomes with late endosomes, including endosomal multivesicular bodies and lysosomal organelles, and dissolution of the internal membrane. VPS34 has a role in the formation of late endosomal multivesicular bodies and lysosomal organelles contributing to the maturation stages of autophagy. to be disposed of by the proteasome) and may deliver them to autophagosomes for degradation 35 . Although only studied so far in the context of targeting polyubiquitylated protein aggregates, an interesting question is whether LC3 may interact with p62 or other proteins to target microorganisms for degradation or antigens for presentation through the MHC class II pathway.",

There was a lack of markers to unequivocally identify autophagosomes; it was difficult to follow the dynamic fate of intracellular bacteria; and it was difficult to determine the significance of bacterial association with autophagosomal membranes in host defence. Indeed, several studies proposed that autophagy was a 'microorganism-friendly process' that supported the intracellular survival of certain pathogens 37 .

It was known that PtdIns3P participated in phagolysosomal biogenesis and microbial clearance upon macrophage phagocytosis of microorganisms 39, 40 . This link prompted investigations into a potential role of increased PtdIns3P production 41 and, by extension, autophagy 42 -as PtdIns3P is involved in the initiation of autophagy downstream of mTOR -in eliminating certain intracellular pathogens, such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis, that block normal phagolysosome biogenesis. Gutierrez et al. showed that the mycobacterial-imposed block in phagolysosomal maturation can be overcome by activating cellular autophagy, either through starvation or inhibition of mTOR 42 . Nearly simultaneously, other studies determined that autophagy can capture intracellular bacteria that lyse the phagosome and escape into the cytosol (such as Shigella spp.) 43 or extracellular bacteria that manage to invade the host cytoplasm (such as Group A Streptococcus) 44 . Other studies have confirmed these initial findings and extended the list of intracellular bacteria and parasites targeted by autophagy to include Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella enterica, Francisella tularensis and Toxoplasma gondii 8, 9, [45] [46] [47] [48] [49] .",

First, the size of autophagosomes that engulf intracellular bacteria tends to be considerably larger than 'typical' autophagosomes (that is, those clearing up cytoplasmic constituents) 44 , raising the possibility that these autophagosomes may have a different biogenesis than typical autophagosomes. Nevertheless, there are similarities in size between LC3-positive structures that clear large protein aggregates 50 and the LC3-positive bacteria-containing autophagosomes 44 . This suggests that the formation of these large autophagosomes, if distinct from classical autophagy, is not reserved exclusively for microorganisms.",

As autophagy is designed to engulf membranous organelles 4,38 , the autophagic enclosure of a pathogen within a membranous vacuole, such as a phagosome, should not represent an obstacle to autophagic elimination. This question has been answered experimentally using the parasite T. gondii. In T. gondiiinfected cells, two different but equally potent pathways of autophagic elimination of the pathogen operate: one that disrupts the parasitophorous vacuole that harbours the protozoan 9 and the other that does not require disruption of the parasitophorous vacuole 8 . Thus, encasement of the pathogen in a vacuole does not seem to represent a physical barrier to autophagic capture and elimination. It has been proposed that damage to the vacuolar membrane containing the organism may precede its autophagic sequestration 9 , but it is not yet known whether such damage or a molecular modification of the target membrane leads to autophagic uptake.",

One possibility is that microbial proteins may be marked for autophagy by modifications, such as ubiquitylation, that are already known to modify bacterial products 52 , or by other yet to be identified molecular tags. Alternatively (or in addition), patternrecognition receptors, such as TLRs, NOD-like receptors and RIG-I (retinoic-acid-inducible gene I)-like helicases, may recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) to stimulate autophagy. A related possibility is that exposure of certain epitopes at the surface of a microorganism may be involved in microbial targeting to autophagosomes. For example, exposure of a Shigella epitope that is normally unexposed (due to masking by another Shigella-encoded protein) leads to autophagic bacterial capture in cells infected with mutants lacking the epitope-masking protein 43 . Another possible signal that links microbial presence and autophagy could be the generation of reactive oxygen intermediates, as these are often associated with pathogen recognition by host cells and are also known to induce autophagy 53, 54 . Future research into the mechanisms underlying the induction of autophagy by microorganisms and their targeting to autophagosomes is likely not only to uncover the specifics of how the autophagic machinery recognizes foreign material in the cytoplasm but also may shed light on how the autophagic machinery detects the cell's own damaged organelles, aggregated proteins and other cytoplasmic targets for lysosomal degradation.",

It is not yet known whether autophagy also targets viruses during cell entry, but this seems probable based on extrapolations from findings in bacterial systems. If true, this could explain why the ratio of virus particles per cell often needs to be very high for cells to become productively infected by viruses.

So, similar to bacteria, viruses may have also found ways to harness the autophagic machinery for their own replicative benefit. The best-studied examples are the mammalian picornavirus poliovirus and the murine coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus 56, 57 . In infections with either of these viruses, knockdown of expression of autophagyrelated genes reduces viral yields. Interestingly, however, a Drosophila melanogaster picornavirus also replicates in association with double-membrane vacuoles (which are morphologically similar to the 'autophagy-like' double-membrane vacuoles associated with mammalian picornavirus replication) but autophagy genes are not required for its normal replication 58 . This suggests that the requirement for the autophagic machinery in the generation of double-membrane vacuoles that support picornavirus replication may be cell-type specific or restricted to certain phylogenetic hosts. Furthermore, the replication of vaccinia virus, a DNA virus that replicates in the cytoplasm in association with double-membrane vacuoles, also does not require the autophagic machinery 59 . So, it is unclear to what extent viruses exploit the autophagic machinery to obtain membrane anchors for their cytoplasmic replication. even in circumstances in which components of the autophagic machinery are necessary for viral replication, it is unknown whether the viruses are truly subverting the host autophagic pathway or merely using a partially overlapping pathway that is involved in membrane trafficking and rearrangement.",

In plants, RNAi-mediated silencing of several different autophagy-related genes increases local replication of tobacco mosaic virus and results in the uncontrolled spread of programmed cell death beyond infected plant cells 60 . In mice, enforced neuronal expression of the autophagy-associated protein beclin 1 reduces alphavirus replication and alphavirus-induced neuronal apoptosis and protects mice from lethal virus-induced encephalitis 61 .

This challenge may be met, at least in part, by using the autophagic pathway for the delivery of cytoplasmic viral nucleic acids to endosomal TLRs, which would then lead to the induction of type-I-IFN-dependent innate immune responses (FIG. 4) So, similar to the use of autophagy for endogenous antigen presentation in adaptive immunity (described later), autophagy may be used for the delivery of endogenous viral nucleic acids to their cognate innate immunity detectors. The precise details of how the autophagy machinery senses viral RNA and targets it to endosomal TLR7 remain to be elucidated. Moreover, it is still unclear how the nucleic acids of DNA viruses, and even other RNA viruses, are targeted to endosomal TLRs in plasmacytoid dendritic cells, as viral replication is not required for type I IFN production in plasmacytoid dendritic cells infected with herpesviruses (DNA viruses) or influenza virus (an RNA virus) 12, 65 .

However, it is not yet clear how universal a role autophagy has in the delivery of self and foreign cytosolic and nuclear antigens. Interestingly, high levels of autophagy activity are observed in the thymic epithelial cells of newborn mice that transgenically express a fluorescently tagged autophagy marker (green fluorescent protein (GFP)-LC3) 71 , suggesting that autophagy may indeed enable thymic epithelial cells to present self antigens to lymphocytes during positive and negative selection. Yet, the role of autophagy in MHC class II presentation of self antigens has not yet been directly examined. Moreover, whereas ebNA1 is processed by autophagy, two other epstein-barr-virusencoded nuclear antigens, ebNA2 and ebNA3C, are preferentially processed by intracellular transfer of antigenic moieties and endocytic uptake from the culture media 72 , indicating that autophagy may only be used for MHC class II presentation of certain endogenously produced viral antigens. A fascinating question is why, even in the same cell, some microbial antigens, but not others, gain access to the MHC class II antigen-presentation pathway by autophagy.",

Chaperonemediated autophagy imports individual cytosolic proteins containing specific pentapeptide recognition motifs into the lysosome via a particular isoform of lysosome-associated membrane protein 2 (LAMP2a) and an accessory chaperone, the heat-shock protein HSC70. Importantly, targeting to the chaperonemediated autophagy pathway is intrinsic to a large fraction of self proteins, as the targeting signal (KFeRQ) is present in roughly 30% of all cytosolic proteins 75 . Although the relative contribution of autophagy and chaperone-mediated autophagy in endogenous MHC class II antigen presentation is not yet known, Zhou et al. have shown that chaperone-mediated autophagy may regulate MHC class II presentation of several cytoplasmic antigens 76 . Overexpression of LAMP2a or HSC70 increases cytoplasmic self antigen presentation, and diminished HSC70 expression reduces MHC-class-II-restricted T-cell responses to these antigens. Now that it is known that autophagic pathways may have a role in MHC class II presentation of endogenous antigen, many important new questions arise. How important are these pathways for adaptive immunity to intracellular pathogens? what is the relationship between autophagic elimination of intracellular pathogens and MHC class II presentation of microbial antigens? Does autophagic degradation of pathogens provide a source of antigens for loading into MHC class II compartments and/or does the autophagic machinery independently capture newly synthesized microbial peptides? How are microbial (and self) antigens targeted for autophagic delivery to MHC-class-II-loading compartments? beyond immunity against infection, what is the broader significance of autophagic antigen processing and presentation in an MHC-class-II-dependent manner?

Not only does autophagy, at least in certain contexts, enhance innate and adaptive immune responses, but in parallel, cytokines, receptors and ligands involved in innate and adaptive immunity enhance autophagy. Immune signalling molecules that have been shown to positively regulate autophagy in some contexts include PKR 77 , IFN\u03b3 (and its downstream effector immunity-related GTPases) 9, 42, 45, 78, 79 , tumour-necrosis factor (TNF) 53, 80, 81 , and the CD40-CD40L (CD40 ligand) interaction 8 . by contrast, autophagy is negatively regulated by the T H 2-type cytokines, interleukin-4 (IL-4) and IL-13, although this has been shown so far only in a non-immune cell line 82-84 . In general, there is a correlation between activation of autophagy by immune mediators and the control of infection with intracellular pathogens. The PKR signalling pathway is an important arm of the innate defence pathway against viruses 85 and is required for virusinduced autophagy 55, 77 . Cell-mediated immunity can induce autophagy through CD40-CD40L stimulation and protect target cells against the vacuolar parasite T. gondii 8 . IFN\u03b3 and TNF are crucial for protection against infection by mycobacteria and other pathogens that replicate in macrophages, and are potent inducers of autophagy in both macrophages and other cell types 9, 42, 45, 53, [78] [79] [80] [81] . It is interesting to note the contrasting roles that the T H 1-type cytokines IFN\u03b3 and TNF, and the T H 2-type cytokines IL-4 and IL-13 (REF. 81 ) may have on the regulation of autophagy. Perhaps, T H 1-cell responses activate autophagy, thereby affording protection against intracellular microorganisms, whereas T H 2-cell responses dampen the autophagic response, thus, potentially explaining the negative role that the T H 2-cell response has in the control of intracellular pathogens 86 .",

Moreover, Atg5 -/-T cells develop normally in the recipient thymus, but fail to repopulate the periphery due to overwhelming cell death.

The pathogenic mechanisms of Crohn's disease are poorly understood but are speculated to involve a dysregulated immune response to commensal gut bacteria and possibly defects in mucosal barrier function or bacterial clearance 94, 95 . It is therefore possible that defects in autophagy lead to altered clearance of and/or altered immune responses to commensal gut bacteria. Given the possible role of autophagy in peripheral tolerance, another speculation is that, in the setting of decreased autophagy, tolerance induction might fail and produce gut-reactive immune responses. As the intestine is a site of constant epithelial-cell shedding owing to apoptosis and regeneration, defective autophagy might also contribute to the pathogenesis of this inflammatory disorder by interfering with apoptotic cell clearance. Studies in targeted mutant mice with conditional deletions or mutations of autophagy genes should help to elucidate the pathogenetic mechanisms of Crohn's disease.",

Yet perhaps, with confrontations between primitive eukaryotes such as amoebae and bacteria, this ancient lysosomal degradation pathway evolved and became exquisitely adapted to orchestrate a multipronged defence against intracellular pathogens. The autophagy pathway degrades intracellular pathogens, and delivers microbial genetic material and antigens to the necessary cellular compartments for activation of innate and adaptive immunity. In addition to its role in defence against pathogens, it also is involved in immune-cell homeostasis and potentially, in preventing inflammation and autoimmunity. The journey forward -in deciphering how autophagy executes these and, similarly, other not yet identified immune functions -will be an exciting challenge for immunologists.",
