            "text": "Dendritic cells (DCs), important early targets of Ebola virus (EBOV) infection in vivo, are activated by Ebola virus-like particles (VLPs). To better understand this phenomenon, we have systematically assessed the response of DCs to VLPs of different compositions. VLPs containing the viral matrix protein (VP40) and the viral glycoprotein (GP), were found to induce a proinflammatory response highly similar to a prototypical DC activator, LPS. This response included the production of several proinflammatory cytokines, activation of numerous transcription factors including NF-kappaB, the functional importance of which was demonstrated by employing inhibitors of NF-kappaB activation, and activation of ERK1/2 MAP kinase. In contrast, VLPs constituted with a mutant GP lacking the heavily glycosylated mucin domain showed impaired NF-kappaB and Erk activation and induced less DC cytokine production. We conclude that the GP mucin domain is required for VLPs to stimulate human dendritic cells through NF-kappaB and MAPK signaling pathways.",

The recent outbreak of Marburg hemorrhagic fever in Angola, West Africa that caused over 200 deaths with a mortality rate approximating 90% underscores the severity of filovirus infection . Ebola virus (EBOV) infections are also associated with a high mortality rate that ranges from 40 to 90% (Mahanty and Bray, 2004) .

            "text": "Infection with the Zaire EBOV causes a rapid hemorrhagic fever that can result in death within the second week after the onset of symptoms (Mahanty and Bray, 2004) . Several observations suggest an association between a nonfatal outcome after filovirus infection and the development of an effective adaptive immune response. For example, fatal cases of EBOV hemorrhagic fever (EHF) show signs of an impaired immune response (Bray and Geisbert, 2005; Hoenen et al., 2006) , lacking the development of a cellular immune response (Sanchez et al., 2004) and in comparison with nonfatal cases, demonstrating little or no circulating antibodies against the virus (Baize et al., 1999) . Thus, a rapid and effective adaptive immune response may be required for recovery. Data also suggest that a strong well regulated innate inflammatory response is associated with a better outcome after EBOV infection (Baize et al., 2002; Leroy et al., 2000) . Antigen presenting cells such as DCs and macrophages that act as a vital link between the early innate and later adaptive immune response (Reis e Sousa, 2004) serve as early targets of EBOV infection in vivo (Geisbert et al., 2003) and likely play a prominent role in the pathogenesis of EHF (Bray and Geisbert, 2005) . These observations are thus consistent with the idea that the earliest interactions of the virus with the innate immune response influence the outcome of disease.",

In contrast to infection with EBOV, Ebola VLPs comprised of VP40 and GP were previously shown to stimulate both macrophages and DCs (Bosio et al., 2004; Wahl-Jensen et al., 2005a) , and based on this capacity, the VLPs have been proposed as vaccines against filoviruses Ye et al., 2006) .

We have (1) carefully characterized which VLP components contribute to the activation and (2) defined the signaling pathways activated by the VLPs. Our results suggest that VLPs are similar but not identical to a prototypical activator of DCs, lipopolysaccharide (LPS), in their capacity to induce cytokine production, activate cellular transcription factors and to activate NF-\u03baB and MAP kinase signaling pathways. They also demonstrate that NF-\u03baB activation plays a critical role in both VLP and LPS induced DC activation and that full activation of DCs requires that the GP on the surface of the VLPs possess an intact carbohydrate-rich mucin domain. These data therefore define mucin domain-dependent signaling pathways that likely contribute to EBOV pathogenesis.",

Equivalent nuclear protein concentrations (total of 7.5 \u03bcg) were used in the Protein/ DNA array I (Panomics, Fremont, CA) to determine transcription factor (TF) activity following the manufacturer's protocol. Very briefly, biotin-labeled probes (TransSignal Probe Mix) were added to nuclear extracts and incubated for 30 minutes at 15\u00b0C. This allowed activated TFs to bind probes forming a complex. After uncomplexed probes were washed away using spin columns, the protein/DNA complexes were disassociated. The column eluate containing freed labeled probes was incubated with membranes spotted with the probe complements. The hybridized spotted membranes were then washed, incubated with streptavidin-HRPO, washed again and developed by chemiluminescense. Each transcription factor is represented by a pair of duplicate spots on the array. One duplicate set being a dilution of the other set. Arrays were developed using several exposure times in order to avoid signal saturation. At each exposure, films of the arrays were scanned and the intensity of spots quantitated using ImageQuant software. The average signal of duplicate spots was then obtained. If duplicate spots varied more than 25%, they were eliminated from the analyses. In order to compare the transcription factor signal from one membrane (sample) to the control (untreated DCs), signals were normalized by dividing the sample signal with the signal of an unchanged TF (selected from that specific exposure). To be more stringent, signals were normalized against two TFs. According to the manufacturer, >2 fold changes in signal are deemed to be significant. We chose to deem significant those signals (i.e. NF-\u03baB) that had a greater than 2 fold difference as compared to the control when normalized against both normalizing TFs. Moreover, almost all transcription factors found to be activated at the 10 minute mark were also found to be significantly altered at the 30 minute time point as compared to control. Therefore, the 10 and 30 minute arrays reinforced the credibility of the transcription factors found to be up or down-regulated. In a few exceptional cases, TFs were upregulated at only one of the two time points, as highlighted in Table 2 .",

Fig. 1D lane cVLP shows the silver stained proteins from cVLPs. To identify these proteins, individual components of the VLPs were excluded from each transfection, with the exception of VP40 since it is required for efficient VLP production ( Fig. 1D lanes -GP, -NP, -VP35, -VP30, -VP24). The exclusion of GP produced a silver stain that lacked a smear from 110\u2212150 kDa (see lane -GP) present in other lanes while exclusion of the NP protein lacked the sharp band found at \u223c105 kDa. This banding pattern is consistent with the expected sizes of the glycosylated GP and NP EBOV proteins (Fig. 1C) , respectively. It is interesting to note that bands appeared at approximately 35 kDa, but exclusion of VP35 failed to eliminate these bands (Fig. 1D , lane -VP35). Therefore, although VP24 and VP35 were present within VLPs (Fig.  1C) , their contribution to the final cVLP was minimal. In Fig. 1E , VP40, VP40+GP VLPs were silver stained. A smear is present in the VP40+GP VLP that corresponds to the expected size of GP and a \u223c40kDa band is present in VP40 and VP40+GP lanes (Fig. 1E ) which would correspond to the expected size of VP40.",

Day 5\u22127 monocyte-derived immature DCs that expressed no CD14, low MHCII, and high CD11c on their cell surface (not shown) were used in these and subsequent experiments. Equivalent protein concentrations of VLPs (10\u03bcg/mL) were added to DCs. We used 10\u03bcg/mL of VLPs, also used previously to stimulate DCs (Bosio et al., 2004) , because it was subsaturating for cytokine production (not shown). Twenty four hours post-treatment spent supernatant was tested for the presence of IL-8, a marker of DC stimulation. As depicted in fig. 2A , DCs treated for 24 hours with LPS (10 ng/mL), VP40+GP and cVLPs, secreted similar levels of IL-8 (\u223c2000\u22122500 pg/mL) while VP40 VLPs secreted less (\u223c400 pg/mL). This experiment was repeated two more times and showed similar results when supernatants were tested for the presence of both IL-8 and IL-6. It should be noted that although the absolute amounts of cytokine varied from experiment to experiment, possibly due to differences in DCs derived from different donors, the trends remained the same. These results are consistent with other studies that demonstrated that VP40+GP VLPs could more efficiently stimulate human DCs than VLPs that lacked GP (Wahl-Jensen et al., 2005a; Ye et al., 2006) . To exclude the possibility that the VLPs were contaminated with LPS, VP40+GP VLPs and LPS were boiled for 1 hour. The resulting samples were then used to stimulate DCs. In the case of LPS, boiling did not inhibit or enhance LPS mediated DC cytokine secretion (not shown). However, as previously shown (Bosio et al., 2004) , boiling of the Ebola VLPs abolished their ability to stimulate DCs (not shown). These results suggest that GP makes a major contribution to the stimulatory function of the VLPs while no effect of the internal components NP, VP35 and VP24 were detectable.",

Total dendritic cell lysates were generated and subjected to western blotting for I\u03baB\u03b1 (Fig. 3A) . NF-\u03baB is held in the cytoplasm by I\u03baB proteins, including I\u03baB\u03b1. Upon stimulation by ligands that induce NF-\u03baB via the classical pathway (for example by LPS or TNF\u03b1), I\u03baB\u03b1 is phosphorylated and subsequently degraded releasing NF-\u03baB which translocates to the nucleus and activates transcription of a variety of genes, including the I\u03baB\u03b1 gene. Fig. 3A shows that TNF\u03b1 and LPS treatment of DCs induces I\u03baB\u03b1 degradation within 10 minutes. However, VLP treatment induces a significant decrease in I\u03baB\u03b1 levels only after 30 minutes.",

To control for the NF-\u03baB peptide inhibitor, a control peptide was also used to pretreat the DCs. Supernatants from VLP stimulated DCs were tested for the presence of IL-6 ( Fig. 3B) or a marker of cell death, lactate dehydrogenase (Fig. 3C ). As shown in fig. 3B and C, at concentrations that did not have detectably toxic effects upon cells, the presence of inhibitors but not control peptide profoundly inhibited IL-6 secretion. The peptide inhibitor of NF-\u03baB interferes with NF-\u03baB nuclear translocation, while the IKK2 inhibitor inhibits IKKB, the upstream kinase that phosphorylates I\u03baB.

            "text": "Expression of EBOV GP in human cells can have a profound effect on the phenotype of that cell, and these effects are partly due to the heavily glycosylated mucin domain located in the GP ectodomain (e.g. (Sullivan et al., 2005; Yang et al., 2000) ). However, the mucin domain does not appear to be required for GP to mediate cell attachment and entry (Jeffers, Sanders, and Sanchez, 2002; Manicassamy et al., 2005; Yang et al., 2000) . To test whether the mucin domain was required for stimulation of DCs, a mucin-deletion GP mutant (\u0394309\u2212476) was generated. First we tested whether the GP\u0394mucin would be incorporated into VLPs. 293T cells were mock, VP40, VP40+GP and VP40+GP\u0394mucin transfected for 48 hours and the presence of VLPs was tested by western blotting for VP40 after VLP purification. Although mock contained no VP40 protein (see \"mock\" lane, Fig. 5A ), VP40 containing VLPs could be isolated from VP40, VP40+GP and VP40+GP\u0394mucin transfected 293T supernatants. Therefore, VLP production was not inhibited by the co-expression of the GP\u0394mucin mutant. Furthermore, electron microscopy performed on the VLPs demonstrated that VP40+GP\u0394mucin VLPs had a similar morphology toVP40+GP VLPs, including the appearance of a GP-decorated surface (not shown). To test the level of GP incorporation into VLPs, equivalent amounts of VP40, VP40+GP and VP40+GP\u0394mucin VLPs were subjected to an anti-GP ELISA (Fig. 5B ). Mock and VP40 VLPs show equivalent ODs while GP and GP\u0394mucin containing VLPs demonstrate equivalent ODs. Therefore, similar levels of WT and mutant GP are incorporated into VLPs. Equivalent amounts of GP and GP\u0394mucin containing VLPs were then used to stimulate DCs (along with LPS control) for 10, 30, 60 and 120 minutes after which DCs were harvested and lysates subjected to western blot analysis for ikappaB\u03b1, pERK1/2 and total ERK1/2 (Fig. 5C) . The WT VLPs, as previously shown in Figure 5 , induced ikappaB\u03b1 degradation at 30 and 60 minutes whereas a significant decrease in ikappaB was not apparent in cells treated with the VP40+ GP\u0394mucin VLPs. Further, the moderate increase in ERK phosphorylation was more apparent in the GP wild type containing VLPs as compared to the mutant GP containing VLPs (Fig. 5C ). Densitometry analysis on the ikappaB\u03b1, phospho ERK and control ERK bands within the western blot confirmed differences in the ratios of ikappaBa and phospho ERK to total ERK between VLPGP and VLPGP \u0394mucin treated DC lysates (not shown). Equivalent amounts of GP and GP\u0394mucin containing VLPs were also used to stimulate DCs (along with LPS control) for 20 hours after which supernatants were tested for the presence of IL-8 (Fig.  5D ). As shown in Figure 5D , unstimulated DCs secreted relatively low levels of IL-8 similar to those secreted by VLP+GP \u0394mucin treated DCs, while both LPS and VLP+GP treated DCs secreted approximately ten fold more IL-8 than the unstimulated control. Finally, to confirm that deletion of the mucin domain did not alter the ability of VLPs to associate with DCs, we employed GFP-tagged VLPs. We constructed and expressed a GFP-VP40 chimeric protein.",

            "text": "Our data identify novel signals triggered by EBOV VLPs within human DCs. These studies provide molecular context to previous observations that EBOV VLPs activate DCs and macrophages. These results also point to specific signaling pathways that may be activated by the initial interaction of EBOV with DCs and which may influence the outcome of EBOV infection. Previous studies have demonstrated that VP40+GP VLPs, but not VP40 VLPs could stimulate DCs (Bosio et al., 2004; Ye et al., 2006) . In our hands, VLPs containing the viral matrix protein, VP40 and the viral glycoprotein, GP, were found to induce a proinflammatory response. The importance of GP for the DC response is expected, and fits with its ability to induce a variety of cellular responses. The EBOV GP is the viral attachment and fusion protein (Bar et al., 2006; Feldmann et al., 2001) , and it also exerts a variety of additional effects upon cells, including surface protein modulation (Simmons et al., 2002; Takada et al., 2000; Wahl-Jensen et al., 2005b) , induction of anoikis (Alazard- Dany et al., 2006; Ray et al., 2004) , and stimulation of cytokine production from human macrophages (Wahl-Jensen et al., 2005a) and dendritic cells (Bosio et al., 2004; Ye et al., 2006) . Moreover, its vascular cytotoxicity is thought to be play an important role in virulence (Yang et al., 2000) . In contrast, the presence of other viral proteins; of which NP was the most abundant, did not substantially alter DC responses. This observation is in spite of the fact that other viral components might be expected to modulate host cell responses to VLPs given their previously described functions. For example, the VP35 and VP24 proteins interfere with signaling pathways related to interferon responses (Basler et al., 2003; Basler et al., 2000; Bosio et al., 2003; Hartman, Towner, and Nichol, 2004; Reid, Cardenas, and Basler, 2005) (Reid et al., 2006) . It remains unclear whether the VP35 and VP24 in \"complete\" VLPs reflects an inability to modulate DC responses when introduced into cells via VLPs or their relatively low abundance in the VLPs.",

            "text": "VLPs containing the viral matrix protein (VP40) and the viral glycoprotein (GP) were found to induce a proinflammatory response highly similar to a prototypical DC activator, LPS. This response included the production of several proinflammatory cytokines, as measured by a multiplex cytokine assay. Specifically, inflammatory cytokines IL-6, TNF\u03b1, and chemokines IL-8, MIP-1\u03b1, RANTES and IP-10 are all secreted by VP40+GP (Fig. 2) and cVLPs (not shown) stimulated DCs. This is consistent with previous studies that demonstrated the secretion of the above-mentioned cytokines (Bosio et al., 2004; Warfield et al., 2003; Ye et al., 2006) with the exception of IFN protein-10 (IP-10), a protein which acts to attract activated T cells and which plays a role in responses to viral infection (Dufour et al., 2002) . Additionally activation of NF-\u03baB and numerous other transcription factors (TFs) were demonstrated, with a multiplex TF array, following either VLP or LPS treatment of DCs. TFs activated by ten minutes were, for the most part, also stimulated after thirty minutes of VLP treatment (Table 2) . Therefore, the results of the ten minute array corroborated the results of the thirty minute array. This also showed that VLP treatment induced rapid signaling. This raises the possibility that the activation may be occurring shortly after interaction of the VLP with receptors present at the plasma membrane of DCs. Further studies are needed to clarify whether internalization of the VLPs by the immature DCs is a requirement for DC stimulation. It is interesting to note that NF-\u03baB was activated (>2 fold change) by VLPs, as compared to an unstimulated control, within 10 minutes of treatment (Table 2 ). However, in fig. 3 , I\u03baB\u03b1 decreased significantly only after 30 minutes. The reason for this seeming discrepancy is unclear, but may reflect the fact two different parameters are being measured using two different assays. Nevertheless, NF-\u03baB was shown to be activated by VLPs using two independent assays.",

This was addressed by employing previously described NF-\u03baB inhibitors. Specifically, IL-6 cytokine production was abolished when NF-KB inhibitors SN50 and IKK2 inhibitors were used to pretreat DCs stimulated with VLPs. The SN50 peptide inhibitor blocks NF-KB nuclear translocation while IKK2 blocks IKK\u03b2, a component of the IKK kinase complex. Taken together, these data indicate that VLPs induce I\u03baB\u03b1 degradation and that NF-\u03baB activation is important for IL-6 secretion.",

Of these, Ets, SIE, STAT and USF TF family members can all be phosphorylated by the stress-induced MAPKs. Consistent with the potential MAPK activated TFs discovered through the array; we also demonstrated that VLPs can significantly activate ERK1/2 (Fig. 4) . However, unlike LPS treatment, VLPs did not detectably activate p38 and SAPK/JNK (Fig. 4) . Although both LPS and VLP treatment activated ERK1/2, they did so with different kinetics. As previously demonstrated in a study showing the kinetics of LPS-stimulated DC ERK1/2 activation (Ardeshna et al., 2000) , ERK1/2 phosphorylation was maximal by 30 minutes while VLP treatment induced ERK1/2 activation that lasted up to 1 hour ( Fig. 4-5) .

As noted above, the heavily glycosylated mucin domain is required for several cellular responses to GP but is not required for GP-mediated cell attachment and entry, at least for GP pseudotyped viruses (Jeffers, Sanders, and Sanchez, 2002; Manicassamy et al., 2005; Yang et al., 2000) . Although GP\u0394mucin was incorporated into VLPs at levels similar to GP, the VLPs containing GP\u0394mucin could not stimulate DC i\u03baB\u03b1 degradation and ERK phosphorylation to the same extent as VLPs containing wild type GP. The GP\u0394mucin VLPs also failed to induce IL-8 production (Fig. 5) . The fact that the neutralizing antibody used in our ELISA (Fig. 5B ) could bind the GP\u0394mucin in the VLPs and the fact that both wild type GP-VLPs and GP\u0394mucin-VLPs can associate with DCs to similar levels ( Fig. 5E ) suggests that GP\u0394mucin is in a native conformation and that VLPs with GP\u0394mucin can still infect cells. Since both wild type and mutant VLPs could presumably mediate virion entry, this would not explain the difference in signaling. Further studies are required to understand how the mucin domain contributes to signaling leading to DC stimulation.",

It should be noted that it is difficult to exclude the possibility that a small amount of contaminating LPS could play a role in the stimulating capacity of our VLPs, however as previously demonstrated (Bosio et al., 2004) , VLPs, unlike LPS, lose their stimulatory capacity when boiled (not shown). We also find that the minimal values obtained in the limulus amebocyte lysates assay employed to quantify endotoxin levels (< 0.03 IU/ \u03bcg total protein, not shown and (Fuller et al., 2006) ) were similar for GP\u0394mucin VLPs as compared to GP VLPs (not shown). Therefore endotoxin contamination cannot explain the differences seen between the two types of VLPs.. Since LPS signals through TLR4, it is tempting to speculate that VLPs may also stimulate DCs through a TLR. However, GP interacts with a variety of cell surface molecules. The identity of the primary receptor(s) mediating EBOV entry is controversial (Simmons et al., 2003b) and one cannot exclude signaling from this receptor(s) as contributing to DC activation. In addition, GP can interact with a variety of other molecules, including Ctype lectins, that are present upon DCs, monocytes and/or macrophages (Alvarez et al., 2002; Marzi et al., 2004; Mohamadzadeh et al., 2006; Simmons et al., 2003a; Takada et al., 2004) . Given that the mucin domain is more glycosylated than other regions of GP, it is intriguing to speculate that interactions between C-type lectins and the mucin domain might contribute to signaling within the DCs.",

Previous studies suggest that EBOV infection of DCs leads to poor pro-inflammatory cytokine production and DCs that are not fully matured and fail to effectively activate a T cell response Mahanty et al., 2003) . We hypothesize that the signals activated by EBOV VLPs represent signals that are also transduced by live EBOV and contribute to the aberrant activation of DCs. Experiments are thus underway to define the mechanism(s) by which these pathways are activated by VLPs and to evaluate their significance in the context of EBOV infection.",
