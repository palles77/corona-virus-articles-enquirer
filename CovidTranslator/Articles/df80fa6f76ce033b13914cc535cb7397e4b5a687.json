In addition, declining sanitation and the onset of drug-resistant pathogenic organisms have increased the spread of re-emerging infectious diseases, such as tuberculosis and malaria [3, 4] . Although major treatment for these infectious diseases is antibiotic administration, the only fundamental prophylaxis is vaccination for a biological preparation that improves immunity to a particular disease.

The epidermis and dermis are highly populated by dendritic cells (DCs), which are potent Ag-presenting cells (APCs) with important immunostimulatory and migratory activities (Fig. 1) . Langerhans cells (LCs) in the epidermis and dermal DCs (dDCs) in the dermis are important for the induction of Ag-specific immune responses in the TCI system. Thus, if Ag can be efficiently delivered to LCs or dDCs resident in the epidermal layer or dermis, TCI might elicit an effective immune response. However, there is a difficulty to overcome for development of TCI system. The uppermost layer of the epidermis is the stratum corneum (SC), which consists of about 20 layers off lattened, enucleate, and keratin-filled corneocytes surrounded by lamellae of around eight lipid bilayers [10, 11] . The lipid bilayers consist Fig. 1 . Skin immune system. The skin is enriched with various immunocompetent cells such as LCs, keratinocytes, and several dDCs. Keratinocytes are mainly involved in the induction of innate immunity. LCs and dDCs capture external Ag, migrate into regional lymph nodes, present Ag to T cells, and activate Ag-specific T cells and B cells. Activated T cells and B cells migrate to each tissue and induce Ag-specific immune responses. primarily of cholesterol, free fatty acids, and ceramides. As the SC is the principal barrier to the penetration of substances, it is difficult to efficiently deliver adequate Ag to cutaneous APCs through the SC by just applying Ag onto bare skin. Therefore, in order to develop effective TCI systems, technologies must be established that promote Ag penetration through the SC.",

Keratinocytes could effectively convert exogenous stimuli into host homeostatic responses [7, 13] . In particular, they express numerous toll-like receptors on their surface or in endosomes [14] . Also, another type of receptor has been discovered on keratinocytes: nucleotide binding-domain oligomerization domain-like receptors [15, 16] . These receptors allow the keratinocytes to recognize bacterial components, namely, pattern-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). In case external Ag do enter, keratinocytes produce cytokines and chemokines. TNF-\u2423 and IL-1\u2424 constitute the signals necessary for LCs or dDCs to migrate to a regional lymph node [17] . Like keratinocytes, LCs and dDCs express these receptors that contribute to the maintenance of an inflammatory environment [18, 19] . This inflammatory microenvironment, innate immunity, arises from the first contact with a vaccine component and contributes to different extents to the production of pro-inflammatory molecules that strongly contribute to the primary events of the adaptive immune response, that is, activation of skin-resident APCs. When vaccine Ag is administrated into skin, Ag-specific immune responses are induced by these mechanisms. Thus, the skin is clearly an attractive organ for Ag delivery to elicit immune responses.",

In a few years, also, reports suggesting the existence of several dDC subsets have been published in mice [23, 24] . It was generally assumed that the expression of langerin in the skin was strictly confined to LCs in the epidermis, but this view has been altered by current data indicating that a large population of langerin-positive cells corresponds to dDCs [25] [26] [27] . Classical langerin-negative dDCs express the macrophage Lipid-based vesicles Nano-bio interaction, flexible bilayer mixes with SC and disrupts it",

It was also reported that CD103-negative, CD11bnegative dDCs exist in the dermis [29] . Especially, CD103-positive dDCs but neither dermal CD103-negative dDCs nor LCs were shown to have a crucial role in the induction of Ag-specific CD8-positive T cells (Th1-type immune responses) [30] . Recent progress was made in identifying potential homologs of mouse dDC subsets by examining human dDCs. Human skin APCs also divided into two groups on the basis of localization, LCs in the epidermis and dDCs in the dermis. Epidermal LCs preferentially induced the differentiation of CD4-positive T cells secreting Th2 cell cytokines and were efficient at crosspriming naive CD8positive T cells [31] . Human dDCs can be distinguished into several subsets; CD1a/1c-positive dDC, CD14-positive dDCs, and CD1a/1cnegative, CD14-negative, CD141-positive dDCs by phenotype and function in the homeostatic and inflamed skin [31] [32] [33] [34] . Human CD1a/1c-positived dDCs and CD14-positive dDCs do not express langerin and can be classified based on their reciprocal expression of CD1a and CD14, which are thought to be equivalent to mouse CD11b-positive dDCs [32] . However, the relative contributions of these subsets to the generation of immunity or tolerance are still unclear [32, 33] . Yet, specialization of these different populations has become apparent. Human CD14-positive dDCs can promote antibody production by B cells [31] . In addition, CD1a/1cnegative, CD14-negative, CD141-positive DCs exhibit specialized cross-presenting function and express a number of markers associated with mouse CD103+ DCs [34] .",

Simon et al. reported a clinical study of the immunogenicity of trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine administrated by the Lec-traJet M3 \u00ae RA disposable syringe jet injector, which was cleared for sale and use by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 2009 [52] . In jet injector systems, Ag-specific immune responses are induced and administration methods are simple, but ampoules are needed in the same way as in conventional injection systems, indicating the need of a cold-chain for transport and storage.",

Several groups have reported that TCI using gauze patches or adherent patches induced Ag-specific immune responses [53] [54] [55] [56] [57] . Application of a LT-containing single-ply polyester-rayon gauze patch onto human skin increased the anti-LT IgG titer in serum [53] . Although the other groups also have reported developing TCI systems for practical use and showed their safety and efficacy [54] [55] [56] [57] , these systems comprised a gauze patch as the TCI device. Because they require the gauze patch to be saturated with Ag solution just before application to the skin, such TCI systems are inconvenient and require cold storage and transportation of the Ag solution, as do conventional injectable vaccination systems. In addition, the disadvantage of patch-based TCI system is the requirement of skin preparation system (SPS) or cyanoacrylate skin surface stripping (CSSS) procedures to remove SC before patch application for improvement of Ag penetration into skin. These methods may carry a risk of increasing sensitivity to secondary infection by disrupting SC as a cutaneous barrier, which is a safety issue. Thus, the development of more easy-to-use and safer patch-based TCI system is desirable.",

            "text": "It is very important to deliver antigenic proteins to the skinresident APCs for induction of Ag-specific immune responses. Therefore, we analyzed biodistribution of Ag after transcutaneous administration by a hydrogel patch. There was marked penetration of the Ag into the epidermal layer of intact skin after 6-h application of a hydrogel patch containing TR-OVA to the auricle skin of mice (Fig. 3B) . In human and tissue-engineered skin models, a hydrogel patch also promoted the penetration of antigenic proteins through the SC [60] . Although theories of conventional transdermal drug delivery suggest that skin structure and composition do not allow for the penetration of materials larger than 500 Da [10, 11] , our transcutaneous vaccination system delivered antigenic proteins (45-150 kDa) into the epidermal layer [58, 59] . We proposed the following mechanisms for penetration of Ag into the skin. First, the concentrated antigenic proteins on the surface of the patch might generate a high concentration gradient of antigenic proteins in the skin, which is critical for producing the driving force needed to accelerate passive diffusion and distribution. This theory is supported by our observation that the distribution of TR-OVA in the epidermal layer was not simply a result of spreading the TR-OVA solution on the intact skin surface, and that the application of the filter paper immersed in Ag solution did not enhance either Ag penetration or antibody titer [58] . Second, humectation and hydration of the skin to which the hydrogel patch is applied might loosen intercellular gaps in the SC, which contributes to improve the penetration of water-soluble substances. According to our observations, Ag penetration via our patch system occurred mainly through the intercellular gaps of the SC. In fact, there are several reports that an increased water content in the SC leads to increased membrane fluidity and decreased electrical resistance [63, 64] . Although it is possible that antigenic proteins penetrate into the epidermal layer through hair follicles -there are some reports that hair follicles allow for even nanoparticles to reach the epidermal layer in skin [65] [66] [67] -our hydrogel patch enhanced Ag penetration on a tissueengineered skin without pores [60] , suggesting that this pathway contributes little to the penetration of Ag into the skin promoted by a hydrogel patch. Through a combination of these mechanisms, our patch vaccine system promoted the penetration of water-soluble macromolecular proteins into the SC.",

TCI using a hydrogel patch elicited toxoid-specific immune responses and the serum titer of antibody in the TCI groups were equivalent to or greater than those of the subcutaneous immunization (SCI) group ( Fig. 3E and F) . In rats vaccinated with combined TT and DT, both TT and DT-specific IgG antibodies were detected in serum as efficiently as that in rats vaccinated with each toxoid alone, suggesting that our TCI using a hydrogel patch is applicable to a combination vaccine. As mixed inoculationis now recommended in vaccination, our TCI formulation is suitable for practical use. We also demonstrated that TCI using a hydrogel patch containing TT and DT induced little adverse reactions in local and systemic toxicity assessments [61] , indicating that hydrogel patch-based TCI formulation is a non-invasive vaccination method. In addition, on the basis of IgG subclass analysis, it was suggested that our TCI using the hydrogel patch formulation predominantly elicited a Th2-type immune response rather than a Th1-type immune response [58, 59] . Further analyses are necessary to elucidate the Th2-dominant mechanism in our patch vaccination.",

Most practical vaccine Ags are in a particulate state, for example, the less virulent strains of bacteria. The development of a different TCI system that is effective for use with all Ag forms is needed. A microneedle array contains many micrometer-sized needles that can create a transport pathway large enough for proteins and nanoparticles, but small enough to avoid pain [68] [69] [70] [71] [72] [73] [74] . Microneedle arrays can penetrate the SC barrier and deliver Ag to immunocompetent cells in the skin more efficiently than other TCI systems. In addition, the use of a disposable array is suitable for selfadministration. Thus, microneedles are the most attractive devices for the development of effective TCI systems. Microneedles were first conceptualized for drug delivery in a 1976 patent [75] . Since then, several type of microneedles have been developed and they are classified into four types with respect to mechanism of action: (1) solid microneedles for pretreatment of the skin to increase permeability, (2) microneedles coated with drug that dissolves in the skin, (3) polymer microneedles encapsulating the drug that fully dissolves in the skin, and (4) hollow microneedles for infusing the drug into the skin.",

This system, however, remains the risk of breaking cutaneous barrier by insertion of microneedles into skin.

Two weeks after last vaccination, these mice were each infected intranasally with 6 \u00d7 10 5 PFU of the A/PR/8/34(H1N1) virus. (A) At the indicated points, sera collected from the mice were assayed for the titer of HA-specific IgG by ELISA. (B) Body weight was measured each day after infection and is presented as a percentage of the original weight before infection (day 0). (C) Six days after infection, the lungs were collected from the mice and the number of viruses in the lung homogenate was determined with a plaque assay system. Data are expressed as mean \u00b1 SE of results from (A) 13 or (B and C) 10 mice. Arrowheads indicate vaccination points. (Fig. 4A) . The microneedles on the MH were dissolved by water in the skin and thus had no danger of remaining in the skin, making our MH safer than traditional microneedle arrays made of metal or stainless steel. In fact, the microneedle tips were fully dissolved at 1 h (Fig. 4B) . Application of each MH caused only temporary skin irritation and the skin barrier function after insertion recovered immediately [76] , suggesting that the holes caused by insertion of each MH closed up quickly. These results suggest low probability of causing secondary infection by application of MH. In observation of skin sections after application of each MH containing fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-silica particles, they were clearly detected (Fig. 4C) , suggesting that the MH delivered particulate Ag into the epidermis or dermis without regard for the Ag form. In addition, the MH size can be used to control the depth of Ag delivery, meaning that each MH might deliver Ag to specific skin-resident APCs, LCs in the epidermis or several dDCs in the dermis.",

After challenge with A/PR/8/34 influenza virus, mice in the TCI group showed no remarkable weight loss, similar to those in the IMI group and INI with CT group (Fig. 5B ).

Several research groups have conducted clinical studies of TCI using patch formulations or microneedle systems in recent years ( Table 2 ). Glenn et al. first reported the results of TCI using a patch in humans [55] . Application of a patch containing LT as Ag resulted in robust LT-specific antibody responses. In addition, their group used LT to investigate patch vaccination against traveler's diarrhea in a phase II clinical trial and found that the 59 LT-patch recipients were protected against moderate-to-severe diarrhea (protective efficacy [PE] 75%) and severe diarrhea (PE 84%) [53] . LT-patch recipients who became ill had shorter episodes of diarrhea (0.5 vs 2.1 days) with fewer loose stools (3.7 vs 10.5) than recipients of placebo [55] . Since then, numerous studies of devices that serve as simple, easy-to-use, and low-invasive TCI systems have been undertaken. Etchart et al. showed that TCI of human adult volunteers with live-attenuated measles induced Ag-specific immune responses in their phase I/II clinical study [54] . Combadiere et al. demonstrated that TCI with an inactivated influenza vaccine induced a significant increase in influenza vaccine-specific CD8 responses compared with those obtained from the intramuscular route [90] . However, these TCI systems require cyanoacrylate skin surface stripping for Ag delivery into skin, which might cause skin irritation as one of the side effects.",

As shown in Fig. 6D , anti-TT IgG and anti-DT IgG increased (paired-t test; p < 0.01) following the first vaccination using the TCI formulation, indicating that a single application of our TCI formulation could induce an immune response in humans. We also administered a second vaccination to five subjects in whom neither antibody titer was significantly increased by the first vaccination. The IgG titers increased in a part of subjects following the second vaccination, suggesting that an additional application increases the efficacy of the TCI formulation. Antibody titers on day 365 after application of the TCI formulation were maintained at a higher level than those on day 0 in all subjects examined, although antibody titers tended to be lower on day 365 than on day 60 [62] . Conventional patch-based TCI systems require the pre-treatment of disrupting or removing SC, but our hydrogel patch achieved Ag penetration into skin without removing the SC and Ag-specific antibodies were produced in some subjects by a single application in humans, which represents a safety and efficacy advantage.",

In order to distribute the vaccine across the world to people who need it, especially those in developing countries, easy-to-use, low-cost, and low-invasive vaccination methods instead of conventional injection systems are required. TCI offers an attractive avenue for the development of needlefree prophylaxis. The main challenge to be addressed during the development of TCI systems is to ensure accurate delivery of Ag to the epidermis and dermis through the SC.
