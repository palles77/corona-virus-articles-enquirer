In a field that has traditionally relied on an established system of mandatory and voluntary reporting of known infectious diseases by doctors and laboratories to governmental agencies, innovations in social media and so-called user-generated information could lead to faster recognition of cases of infectious disease. More direct access to such data could enable surveillance epidemiologists to detect potential public health threats such as rare, new diseases or early-level warnings for epidemics. But how useful are data from social media and the Internet, and what is the potential to enhance surveillance? The challenges of using these emerging surveillance systems for infectious disease epidemiology, including the specific resources needed, technical requirements, and acceptability to public health practitioners and policymakers, have wide-reaching implications for public health surveillance in the 21st century.",

These systems are designed to collect and analyze structured data based on established surveillance and monitoring protocols tailored to each disease (ie, used for calculating the incidence, seasonality, and burden of disease), in order to gather relevant information about populations of interest to detect changes in trends or distributions in the population. Data on such indicators are reported by health care providers and diagnostic laboratories, by legal mandate or voluntary agreement, and are collected by surveillance specialists in governmental health agencies. This information then can be verified through communication between the governmental health agencies and the persons collecting the data in health care settings.",

The goal is to find increased numbers or clusters at a specific time, period, and/or location that might indicate a threat. Statistical methods set against thresholds of increased cases or clusters are crucial to finding potential health events. They are based on the relevant attributes of each infectious disease, such as epidemiological parameters like regional incidence, seasonality, and the known burden of disease. Thresholds can also be adjusted using statistical algorithms to vary sensitivity and specificity so that the detection procedure is refined to better suit the needs of the epidemiological situation for a disease or a specific area.

            "text": "The ability of indicator-based surveillance systems to detect potential threats more quickly is lacking, however. Although generating signals based on statistical thresholds can provide an aggregation that will speed up a threat assessment, the data itself may not be the most recent. First, there is often a time lag between the occurrence of an event and the indicator-based surveillance. That is, data input and retrieval for indicator-based surveillance often rely on specific case definitions and reporting requirements that differ for physicians in hospital and community care and for laboratories, thereby causing delays in reporting to health agencies. Delays also may be caused by time lags between reporting procedures from the reporting bodies and the authorities who receive, store, and process the data, that is, by the structure of notification systems in official public health agencies that often trickle up from the local, state, and federal levels. Second, indicator-based systems are sometimes poorly equipped to detect new or unexpected occurrences of disease, owing to the predefined epidemiological attributes assigned to each infectious disease for which information is collected. This was true during the first cases of SARS-CoV in 2002 and pandemic H1N1/09 influenza in 2009, which at first were not detected because the existing systems could track only the clinical and epidemiological attributes for corona or influenza infections that had already been discovered and defined, but not new strains of viral infections. Incidentally, such shortfalls provided the impetus for the systemic improvement of indicator-based systems. By demonstrating the importance of detecting unknown but similar diseases, it became evident that new data sources and methods for monitoring such data were critical. 3 As a result of the SARS-CoV epidemic, for example, health agencies began to seriously consider ways to monitor symptoms and syndromes (ie, clusters of symptoms for particular diseases) in order to provide appropriate and fast detection with the most efficient use of required human resources.",

            "text": "Similar to indicator-based surveillance, event-based surveillance is based on the organized and rapid capture of information about events that can be a risk to public health. But rather than relying on official reports, this information is obtained directly from witnesses of real-time events or indirectly from reports transmitted through various communication channels (eg, social media or established routine alert systems) and information channels (the news media, public health networks, and nongovernmental organizations) ( Table 1 ). Monitoring that relies on data from these Internet sources can be used to detect threats not specifically found by indicator-based surveillance, since this information relies less on data structured and filtered through the aforementioned preestablished structures for surveillance. Event-based surveillance can identify events faster than indicator-based reporting procedures can, and it can detect events that occur in populations not able to access formal channels for reporting. In addition, event-based surveillance can be used with other established indicator-based methods, thereby enhancing the combined arsenal for combatting critically prevalent pathogens with a high threat potential, such as influenza virus or Escherichia coli. The scientific literature recently referred to this comprehensive framework of combined activities from both indicator-based surveillance and eventbased surveillance systems as \"epidemic intelligence,\" a contemporary understanding of the 1950s term with roots in public health innovation for surveillance systems at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the establishment of the Epidemic Intelligence Service (EIS).

The heuristics learn as their output is verified against a set threshold for the epidemiological attributes of health events that have been extracted, thus improving monitoring over time. The system aggregates the extracted events into outbreaks, across multiple documents and sources, before returning the extracted information to the system. Users of the system often prefer a more structured approach, but it may present too much information (in some cases up to 1,000 events per day). The large amount of \"information noise\" also may be a hindrance, since users are then required to sift through it manually. HealthMap alleviates noise by integrating data from a variety of electronic sources that already have been moderated (ProMED-mail, WHO-validated official alerts, and the Eurosurveillance RSS multinational outbreak news site), all of which are fed into a classification engine (ie, a parser), which uses the information to produce disease and location output codes.

Our review also articulates the factors that might influence the integration of such surveillance activities into official systems. The usefulness of new information sources via event-based surveillance depends on whether the information can enhance the data collection from existing surveillance methods and also on several factors related to the challenges for all systems' acquisition of data on infectious disease surveillance. 29, 30 For most epidemiologists, the process of gathering data from the Internet is complex, as it includes text mining (searching for health-related content from websites or social media), preparation (extracting and filtering relevant health-related information), and presentation of only the most relevant content (disseminating the information). In general, data are acquired and processed either automatically or by people, often relying on individual technologies for users' interaction with the data to tag (mark or catalog) the information for future use, and to comment on the information (for sharing and collaboration with other scientists), which can also be used to inform machine-learning algorithms (eg, statistical filters for data retrieval, such as Bayesian models). Systems often use automatic programming interfaces (APIs), a type of filter through which the data are passed in order to extract specific information. This is a good way of managing large sources of data from the Internet, which can be cumbersome and contain much content not related to health. These APIs process, extract, augment, and compile the epidemiological attributes in the data (ie, metadata) from multiple sources. For example, healthrelated attributes could include the data source, a relevant health term, the location, and the time of transmission. Natural language-processing systems extract from the feeds such relevant concepts as disease names and references to a geographic location. The information is then often assigned a dissemination format based on the information type (ie, epidemiological attribute) retrieved, through a network (eg, GPHIN), the Internet, email (ProMED-mail), or SMS (EWRS), or it is plotted on a geographic information system (GIS) published on the web (eg, HealthMap). The time needed to get from a potential data source to extracting and presenting epidemiological information that can be used as quickly as possible for preparedness or responses is critical. The results vary widely, depending on the combination of technologies used and whether or not human mediation is involved.",

In developing countries with a large disease burden, surveillance infrastructures that can use health information in the absence of traditional surveillance institutions can be critical to prevent an outbreak or reduce its impact. 35 Recent work has begun in this area to seek out information on health threats using mobile phone technology, Internet-scanning tools, email distribution lists, or networks that complement the early warning function of routine surveillance systems. [36] [37] [38] [39] [40] Our research showed that the majority of event-based surveillance systems are based in North America and Europe, with fewer local, event-based systems monitoring epidemic threats in Africa, Asia, the South Pacific, and South America. Guidance and training to create such systems on the ground should be considered, as this can lead to a faster assessment of health threats and a more rapid response by local authorities.",

In order to generate a list of search keywords appropriate for retrieving articles relevant to \"event-based surveillance systems,\" we conducted a series of preliminary searches by author, as well as by the terms \"event-based\" and \"surveillance\" using the search engine PubMed. We then repeated the process to ensure that the searches were thorough. A total of 130 articles were retrieved and subjected to a rapid review of titles and abstracts to build the final keyword list for all subsequent searches. The list was reviewed and agreed upon in collaboration with surveillance epidemiologists. All subsequent searches were done separately using the PubMed, Scopus, and Scirus databases. The search was a combination of all the key terms generated by using Boolean functions of \"and\" and \"or.\"Data Abstraction and Study Selection. For abstractions of the articles retrieved from the keyword searches, we developed inclusion criteria consisting of articles with a focus on infectious diseases, surveillance, outbreaks, and those specifically describing an event-based surveillance system; only those systems covering or intersecting with human health surveillance; and only those written in English. Our exclusion criteria were topics dealing with bioterrorism, technical aspects of security (eg, video surveillance), sentinel surveillance, or any surveillance not based on human health and infectious diseases. We also excluded articles without available abstracts. Due to the large number of articles found in each of the databases, the first stage of abstraction included applying our inclusion and exclusion criteria only to titles, which was extended to abstracts in all cases in which the classification relevance from titles alone was difficult. The full study protocol is available online. 24 Data Synthesis and Extraction. The Boolean search using PubMed produced 9,161 articles (320 articles were retained); Scopus yielded 32,824 articles (298 articles were retained); and Scirus yielded 160,637,507 articles. By default, Scirus lists all retrieved articles by relevance; we reviewed only the first 6,000 articles and found 79 articles to be",
