            "text": "The symptoms of rhinorrhea secondary to influenza and cold virus or seasonal and perennial allergic rhinitis are circadian rhythmic. Cough frequency and handkerchief use by persons suffering from virus-induced rhinorrhea are more prominent during the daytime, especially during the initial hours after awakening from nocturnal sleep. The elevation in sublingual temperature as well as the decrement in mental alertness associated with influenza in particular are more profound at this time. Sneezing, blocked nose, and runny nose secondary to allergic rhinitis are also greater in intensity during the morning in approximately 70% of sufferers. The day-night variation in symptom intensity amounts to approximately 20% of the 24-hour mean level The treatment of these diseases and their symptoms has traditionally involved equal-interval, equal-dose (homeostatic) medication schedules. The effects of antihistamine and antiinflammatory medicines may be enhanced by timing them to the daynight temporal pattern in symptom manifestation and intensity to achieve an optimization of their beneficial effects with control of toxicity, that is, as a chronotherapy. (J ALLERGY CLIN IMMUNOL 1995; 95:1084-96.) Key words: Circadian rhythms, colds, influenza, allergic rhinitis, rhinorrhea, chronotherapeutics Biological functions are not constant over time as implied by the concept of homeostasis. Instead they undergo predictable and thus rhythmic variation over specific time domains--the 24 hours, month, and year, for example. Biological processes exhibit a rather precise time structure defined by both the totality of cycles of various period durations and the phase relationships (peak and trough times) of the rhythmic functions of the same period.X, 2 Chronobiology is the science concerned with the study of biological rhythms, their mechanisms, and the bioclocks that drive them. Chronobiological investigations demonstrate that the biological time structure is an endogenous, genetic trait. [3] [4] [5] Rhythms are coordinated by specialized diseases are affected by the circadian time structure, which leads to prominent 24-hour patterns in their manifestation and exacerbation. Asthma 2\u00b0 and ulcer 21 disease tend to worsen or occur only at night; migraine headache, 22 rheumatoid arthritis, 23 exertional angina, 24 myocardial infarction, 25 and thrombotic stroke 26 are most common or more severe during the initial hours of diurnal activity. 1 Studies pertaining to the pathophysiology of these and other diseases are typically conducted during the daytime at the convenience of both the investigators and subjects. The findings of daytimeconducted studies, however, may not be representative, especially for those disorders that worsen or occur during the nighttime. The chronobiology of asthma has been the subject of scientific investigation for more than 30 years. Most patients are prone to nocturnal exacerbations of dyspnea. Circadian rhythms in endocrine function, the autonomic nervous system, and airway inflammation are contributory. 2\u00b0 The signs and symptoms of infectious and allergic rhinitis are likely to be affected by these and other circadian functions and processes. The purpose of this article is to (1) review the evidence of circadian rhythms in the occurrence and severity of rhinorrhea and (2) examine circadian rhythm-based treatment strategies for improving the pharmacotherapy of viral and allergic rhinitis.",

Indeed, only two published reports could be located by a thorough review of the medical literature published during the past 20 years. The investigations of Smith et al. 27 focused on the day-night pattern in symptom intensity of individuals challenged with cold or influenza viruses. Healthy volunteers without a history of allergic rhinitis, respiratory or other organic disease, and free of medication use served as subjects. Volunteers were quarantined for 3 days to ensure absence of infection. Thereafter, nasal drops containing either influenza B, corona virus or rhinoviruses RV2 and RV9, or saline as placebo were administered to different persons in a double-blind manner. After a 2-to 3-day incubation period while residing in a special study unit, subjects were assessed for signs and symptoms of infectious disease. Handkerchief use and sublingual temperature were assessed at specific times during the day and evening by subjects who had symptoms of the cold viruses. In addition, mental alertness was self-assessed four times daily by those who had symptoms of influenza B virus.",

The cold virus had no effect on the circadian rhythm of sublingual temperature or mental alertness. Kuhn et al. z8 assessed the circadian pattern of cough in 65 diurnally active university students suffering from acute respiratory illness, presumably the common cold. Participants had symptoms for no longer than 48 hour when studied. Cough frequency was determined by an audiorecording method. The total number of coughs was reported at 6-hour intervals during a 24-hour control baseline period and thereafter during treatment with guaifenesin (400 mg) or placebo every 6 hours for an additional 36 hours. Cough frequency was highest during the hours of activity and lowest overnight during the baseline period as well as during placebo and guaifenesin treatment ( Fig. 1 ).",

Graphs of the 3-hour averages of symptom intensity scores show the prominent day-night variation in the severity of sneezing as well as blocked and runny nose (Fig.  4) . All the symptoms were worse in the morning at the start of the activity period. However, a second, less prominent evening peak in symptom intensity was also apparent. The magnitude of the day-night variation in the other surveyed symptoms--eye irritation, itchy nose, cough, and dyspnea--was trivial.

We refer to these as homeostatic treatment strategies. However, the need for medication may not be constant throughout the 24 hours. Many chronic diseases, such as rheumatoid and osteoarthritis, 23 ischemic heart disease, 24-26 asthma,13, 20 and ulcer disease, 21 for example, exhibit rather predictable variations in their occurrence or severity over a 24-hour period. The symptoms of infectious and allergic rhinitis also undergo predictable day-night variability; in most patients they are most intense in the morning upon arising from sleep and least troublesome in the afternoon. The demonstration of circadian patterns in the manifestation and intensity of human diseases, including rhinitis, suggests that the requirement for medication is not the same throughout the 24 The medication was least effective when most of or all the daily dose was administered in the morning around breakfast time (Fig. 6) . Evening administration (10 mg) was especially effective in patients who exhibited predominantly morning symptoms (Fig. 7) . No sedative effect was observed. Moreover, one of the major side effects of the medication, dry mouth, was minimized or completely averted by the evening dosing schedules. 36, 37 The chronotherapy of mequitazine for allergic rhinitis entails a daily treatment regimen in which all or most of the daily dose is administered in the evening. Comparable study of other antihistaminic or decongestant medications is unknown. One corn-paw (Ferndale Laboratories) recommends that its decongestant-antihistamine product, Kronofed (60 mg pseudoephedrine and 4 mg chlorpheniramine) be taken in unequal doses, one third the daily dose in the morning and the remaining two thirds before bedtime. The rationale for this administration schedule appears be based on the fact that first-generation Hi-antagonists exert a sedating effect; the greater evening dose helps induce sleep at night. However, the unequal dosing strategy might be more beneficial for the control of the disease than the equal-interval, equal-dose regimen, since it takes into account the circadian rhythmic aspects of allergic rhinitis.

The rationale for the chronotherapy of corticosteroids is the extensive amount of research demonstrating that the suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical axis is dependent on the circadian timing of synthetic corticosteroid hormones.4a-43 Doses timed during the initial hours of the activity span, which correspond in time to the peak plasma cortisol level, are less adrenal suppressive than are those timed late in the evening or at night when the endogenous hormone level is low. Because supper and bedtime administration of tablet corticosteroids poses an elevated risk of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical suppression and perhaps other side effects, equalinterval, equal-dose (three to four-times daily) homeostatic treatment regimens are not recommended as a long-term treatment strategy. 4e, 43 In addition, morning and mid-day corticosteroid tablet administration is more effective in treating nocturnal asthma than is evening administra-tion22, 42 The use of tablet corticotherapy in the long-term management of rhinorrhea is a relatively uncommon practice except for the most severe cases. Topical corticosteroid aerosols are much more popular. Research on the chronotherapy of aerosol corticosteroids is just commencing. 44,45 Initial studies on asthmatic patients have been conducted recently by Pincus et al. 45 In their studies oncedaily afternoon (3:00 PM), high-dose aerosol corticotherapy was more effective on lung function than once-daily morning (8:00 AM) or evening (8:00 PM) timings.

The staging of endogenous 24hour rhythms is accomplished by one's daily activity (in light) and sleep (during darkness) routine. Night workers adhere to a different clock-hour schedule of sleep and activity than do day workers. Shiftworkers undergo readjustment of their circadian time structure with each rotation that entails alteration of the sleep-wake pattern. In the majority of studies on rhinorrhea, there was no standardization of the sleep-wake synchronizer schedule of circadian rhythms, nor was there mention of the subjects' sleep-wake routine. In addition, information on medication use was oftentimes lacking or incomplete. Even when it was known that patients received medication to manage allergic rhinitis, the dose and schedule of the medications were not always specified. In spite of these drawbacks in investigative methods, prominent day-night patterns in the symptoms of both viral and allergic rhinitis were detected. In the case of allergic rhinitis, the circadian variability was documented in studies conducted in different counties, in women and men, in the young and elderly, in smokers and nonsmokers, in newly diagnosed and chronic sufferers, and in patients with seasonal and perennial rhinitis. 3\u00b0-32, 47-49 In diurnally active individuals, symptoms most commonly started or were most severe during the morning after awakening from nighttime sleep.",

Unfortunately, specific symptoms were not self-assessed repeatedly during the 24 hours; thus determination of the magnitude of the temporal variation could not be accomplished. Nonetheless, prominent day-night variation in the manifestation of the infectious disease was detected. In patients with mild to moderate symptoms of cold or influenza, handkerchief use was respectively one and one half to fourfold greater during the morning hours between 8:00 and 11:00 AM than during the afternoon. The effect of influenza on mental alertness and sublingual temperature was also time dependent. The decrement in alertness and increment in temperature were most pronounced in the morning. The frequency of coughing due to acute respiratory illness, most likely a cold virus, was greatest during the daytime and least overnight both before and with treatment by placebo or guaifenesin syrup. 28 Most studies of the day-night variation in the symptom intensity of allergic rhinitis relied on patient recall. Questionnaires or diary cards were used to survey patients during clinical visits and home study or by mailings to randomly selected individuals.3O, 33.47-49 While this investigative method is useful for exploring the existence of temporal patterns in disease, it does not allow one to quantify the extent of variation in the symptom intensity experienced by Patients. Reinberg et al. 32 used a repeat-measures, self-assessment protocol to ascertain the occurrence and intensity of symptoms four times daily. They found that the magnitude of the 24-hour variation in the intensity of sneezing, nasal congestion, and nasal drainage was around 20% on average. However, because data collection was restricted to the hours of daytime activity only, the estimate of the extent of the variability in symptom intensity may be conservative. Patients oftentimes complain that their sleep is disturbed because of severe nasal congestion causing difficulty in breathing overnight. Thus the time when the nasal congestion of allergic and perhaps infectious rhinorrhea is most severe maybe somewhat earlier than determined by surveys restricted to the daytime hours only-. Close review of the published reports on allergic rhinitis reveal a second time, between supper and bedtime, when symptom intensity is elevated. 31, 32, 49 The limited data published thus far on viral rhinorrhea reveal only a single morning time peak in symptoms during the 24 hours. The second peak of symptoms experienced by some sufferers of allergic rhinitis might represent a late-type reaction to antigens9 Such reactions have also been reported for allergic asthma and dermatitis. 51, 52",

Although the mechanisms underlying the observed variation in rhinorrhea have yet to be elucidated, several explanations have been put forth. Some suggest that the increased morning use of handkerchiefs by cold and influenza sufferers represents the need to clear the upper airways of secretions that accumulate during nocturnal sleep. Others cite the role of the prone position during sleep as contributing to the worsening of nasal congestion overnight. The severity of morning symptoms of allergic rhinitis is commonly blamed on antigen exposure, particularly house dust mite, mold, and feathers, in the bedroom during nocturnal sleep.

The processes underlying the pathophysiology of inflammation are modulated by certain circadian rhythmic processes. 53 The symptoms of other inflammatory diseases, such as asthma and rheumatoid arthritis, are worse during nocturnal sleep or in the morning on awakening. Laboratory rodent research reveals the rate and extent of the edematous response to phlogistic agents, the mucopolysaccharide carrageenan, 54, 55 the antibiotic polymycin B, and croton oil, 56 vary by up to threefold according to the circadian time of their administration. Time-dependent differences in the inflammatory response may be related to the circadian rhythm in cortisol. 54 Experimentally induced edema is greatest when plasma cortisol level is lowest (during the rest span) and least when cortisol is highest (during the activity span); adrenalectomy results in loss of circadian rhythmicity in the edematous response. Rhythms in the bradykinin, prostaglandin E2, arachidonic acid, tissue blood flow, and the number and functional capacity of macrophages plus other inflammatory cells are thought to be involved. 23,5761 Circadian rhythms in plasma cortisol and the autonomic nervous system plus day-night differences in airways inflammation, reactivity, and clearance may also play a role because they are known to contribute to the worsening of lung function and asthma overnight. 13, 20 The traditional treatment of rhinorrhea consists of decongestant and Hi-receptor antagonist med-ications. Topical nasal corticotherapy is used, particularly in the management of allergic rhinitis. Generally such medications are administered several times daily. Times of drug administration during the day and night are selected primarily to ensure patient compliance. Circadian dependencies and attributes of rhinorrhea, even if appreciated by the medical community, are unfortunately seldom taken into account in the scheduling of pharmacotherapy.

Moreover, the findings of two clinical trials involving topical corticosteroids imply that both the morning and afternoon peaks in symptom intensity or occurrence observed in some patients can be moderated by equal-interval, equal-dose treatment regimens. 48, 49 The advantage of a chronotherapy for aerosol corticosteroids for allergic rhinitis has yet to be explored. Initial chronotherapeutic trials on asthma patients with corticosteroid aerosols show that the therapeutic efficiency varies with time of administration; high-dose inhalation corticotherapy timed to the middle of the patient's activity span (about 8 hours after awakening from nighttime sleep) results in a greater improvement in pulmonary function as measured by spirometry than does morning or evening once-a-day administration. 45 Circadian rhythmicity in the effect of ipratropium bromide on rhinorrhea has yet to be explored.

Strength of antihistamine effect according to treatment time and dose is expressed as clock-time difference in cutaneous response to histamine during antihistamine versus placebo treatments. Antihistamine effect was longer in a dose-dependent manner when medications were ingested in the morning. Magnitude of peak effect was greater in a dose-dependent manner after evening treatment.

Participants conducted self-assessments of symptom intensity four times daily for 7 consecutive days to quantify the effect of the treatment regimen. Mequitazine was most effective in moderating the morning peak and overall 24-hour level of symptom intensity of allergic rhinitis when two thirds or all the 7.5 or 10 mg daily dose was ingested around dinner time. Time-dependent effects of 7.5 mg of antihistamine mequitazine (Pharmaka, France) administered in unequal morning (breakfast, B) and evening (dinner, D) doses for allergic rhinitis. When all or most of the daily dose of mequitazine was ingested in the evening, there was enhancement of drug effect. (From Reinberg A. Chronopharmacology of Hi-antihistamines. In: Lemmer B J, ed.
