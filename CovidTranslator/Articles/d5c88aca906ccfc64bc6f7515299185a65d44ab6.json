            "text": "Epithelial cells are important target cells for coronavirus infection. Earlier we have shown that transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus (TGEV) and mouse hepatitis coronavirus (MHV) are released from different sides of porcine and murine epithelial cells, respectively. To study the release of these viruses from the same cells, we constructed a porcine LLC-PK1 cell line stably expressing the recombinant MHV receptor cDNA (LMR cells). The MHV and TGEV receptor glycoproteins were shown by immunofluorescence to appear at the surface of the cells and to be functional so that the cells were susceptible to both MHV and TGEV infection. Both coronaviruses entered polarized LMR cells only through the apical surface. Remarkably, while the cells remained susceptible to TGEV for long periods, infectability by MHV decreased with time after plating of the cells onto filters. This was not due to a lack of expression of the MHV receptor, since this glycoprotein was still abundant on the apical surface of these cells. TGEV and MHV appeared to exit LMR cells from opposite sides. Whereas TGEV was released preferentially at the apical membrane, MHV was released preferentially at the basolateral surface. These results show that vesicles containing the two coronaviruses are targeted differently in LMR cells. We propose that the viruses are sorted at the Golgi complex into different transport vesicles that carry information directing them to one of the two surface domains. The apical release of TGEV and the basolateral release of MHV might be factors contributing to the difference in virus spread found between TGEV and MHV in their respective natural hosts, the former causing mainly a localized enteric infection, the latter spreading through the body to other organs. \u1b67 1996 Academic Press, Inc.",

For TGEV these results are in agreement with our earlier observations in the parental cell line, LLC-PK1 (8) . The amount of MHV proteins synthesized in the LMR cells decreased when monolayers of increasing age were used. Thus, monolayers infected at 85 hr p.s. hardly produced any MHV proteins. This observation was not due to the cells becoming generally less metabolically active: no such time-dependent decrease in virus-specific protein synthesis was seen after TGEV infection (Fig. 2) . The apical entry of the viruses was confirmed in an immunofluorescence experiment in which filter-grown LMR cells were again infected with MHV or TGEV from the apical or basolateral side at different times p.s. and fixed for staining 6 hr later. Figure 3 shows that the entry of MHV into the cells was not yet polarized when cells were infected at 4 hr p.s. From 8 hr p.s. on, virus entry became restricted to the apical membrane domain. The same results were found for the entry of TGEV (results not shown). From about 48 hr p.s. entry of both viruses was due to their inability to pass the filters and reach the cells at later time points postseeding, cells grown for 73 hr on filters were treated with that, depending on the experimental conditions, up to 50% of the cells could be doubly infected by both TGEV 30 mM EGTA for 30 min at 37\u040a.

The amounts of MHV and TGEV proteins synthesized in doubly infected cells were much lower than the basolateral side (data not shown).

Similar results were found when viral particles were affinity purified from the media by adding monoclonal antibodies against the spike proteins of TGEV and MHV in the absence of detergent (data not shown). The ratio between MHV viruses released into the basolateral and apical medium decreased in older monolayers. Possible reasons for this observation are discussed elsewhere (10) .
