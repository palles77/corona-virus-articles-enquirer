Swift identification and implementation of transmission based precautions (TBP) for patients known or suspected of having an epidemiologically important pathogen is important. ED staff, particularly triage nurses, are pivotal in detecting and preventing infection, including healthcare associated infections (HAI). Methods: MEDLINE, CINAHL, PubMed and Ovid were searched for articles published between 2004 and 2015 using key search terms: infection control/prevention and emergency department(s), triage, and transmission based precautions and emergency department(s), and triage, to identify common themes for discussion. Systematic review/meta-analysis was not in the scope of this exploration. Findings: Themes were identified relating to HAI and ED practices and grouped into: assisted detection of conditions for which TBP is required, ED and TBP, mass-causality event/bioterrorism/pandemic/epidemic, infection control not TBP and multi-resistant organisms not TBP. The literature is heavily influenced by worldwide epidemic/pandemics and bioterrorist risks resulting in increased awareness of the importance of swift identification of syndromes that require TBP, but only in these situations. Conclusion: Implementation of appropriate TBP, changing triage practices, training and measures to assist decision-making could assist in preventing HAI in the ED context. A systematic quantitative review of the literature is recommended to guide practice change research.",

Emergency departments (ED) have a significant role in identification, triage and application of proven infection prevention and control (IPC) measures to curb the risk of transmission of communicable disease within the healthcare setting. Best practice indicates this is achieved through the swift identification and implementation of transmission based precautions (TBP) for patients who are known or suspected of having an epidemiologically important pathogen. Emergency departments are often viewed as healthcare safety net providers with the num-ber of ED presentations steadily increasing over recent years [1, 2] . This added pressure from both the community and primary care providers can potentially further strain a compromised or inadequate triage system and place healthcare worker and patient safety in jeopardy.",

These precautions are therefore warranted when there is a potential for a patient to be infected, or colonised in some cases, with a relevant pathogen [3, 4] . Community outbreaks of infectious disease can be easily amplified in the healthcare setting if wellestablished IPC principles and policies are not being practiced. This is particularly true of respiratory pathogens such as respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and Bordetella pertussis or those spread through airborne transmission such as measles and tuberculosis. In late 2003 the world saw an outbreak of a new respiratory virus causing illness and mortality in both patients and health care workers. By mid-2004 the pathogen, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), was identified and the world prepared for a pandemic response. The year 2009 saw a novel influenza A (H1N1) strain causing significant illness across the globe, resulting in a pandemic [5] . In 2014 the largest known outbreak of Ebola virus disease (EVD) occurred (and is still continuing) in West Africa with devastating human, economic and societal effects in that region. With the recent spread of Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in the Asia-Pacific region it is timely to consider how prepared EDs are to recognise presenting infectious diseases and implement the appropriate IPC precautions.",

Therefore when the need to step-up precautions occurs there is a limited baseline level of practice and compliance to build from. For example, hand hygiene is widely recognised as a foundation of infection prevention. The latest national compliance rate for hand hygiene in Australia is 82.2% across all healthcare workers [8] . Variation exists between professions with nurses and midwives at 84% and medical staff at 68.9% with other healthcare workers (such as allied health professionals and ancillary staff) in between. With baseline compliance at this level, one of the most basic aspects of IPC, there is little reason to suspect that this would not contribute to healthcare workers becoming ill.",

            "text": "Similarly the compliance with transmission based precautions is often less than ideal. High patient volume in acute care limits the ability to place patients suspected of requiring single rooms in these until a diagnosis is confirmed. This creates a potential reservoir of infection for both patients and healthcare workers alike. It has also been shown that health care workers can be reluctant to implement transmission based precautions until a diagnosis is confirmed due to perceived and real imposts on time and resources, plus administrative patient flow pressure. Human factors may lead to a situation where the healthcare workers are cognitively overloaded and as their regular practice may be less than 100%, small breaches can occur that they themselves do not identify as breaches. The 'To Err is Human' report in 2000 identified the gap between what is recommended practice and actual practice [9] . Consistently this gap is identified in the application of transmission based precautions as well as other infection prevention strategies potentially leading to health care acquired infections in patients and health care workers [10] . The director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Dr Tom Frieden was recently quoted as saying ''There are 75,000 deaths each year from infections spread in hospitals in the U.S. We know no matter how good our recommendations for hand washing and personal protective equipment are, we have to have a large margin of safety for how they will actually be implemented in the field'' [11] suggesting that the CDC acknowledges that clinicians are not always going to follow IPC guidelines, and this is largely unintentional. Yet, accepting standards that put patients, staff and visitors at risk goes against legal and ethical responsibilities of health care staff. This reinforces the need for practices to be second nature for health care workers to ensure that as the potential for harm increases small errors do not have fatal consequences. The practice of infection prevention and control is not an optional extra for clinical practice and patient management, it is essential to both patient and healthcare worker safety. The ability to recognise infectious conditions and implement the appropriate TBP at all times and not only at times of heightened awareness is therefore particularly relevant in the ED context.",

Emerging and reemerging infectious diseases, international travel, mass gatherings, incomplete vaccination, overpopulation, urbanisation all place pressure upon contemporary healthcare and the ability to contain infectious disease [5, 13] . These issues combined with increasing ED presentations of patients with non-emergent concerns, noncommunicable disease and a co-morbid ageing population indicate there is increased and arguably dangerous pressure upon ED staff to provide swift triage and care to patients [18, 20] . Regardless of this pressure, however, there is an imperative for the appropriate application of TBP in this setting. Failure to identify a significant communicable condition and the subsequent implementation of TBP has led to a number of infectious disease outbreaks to occur amongst patients, staff and visitors both after admission to the ED and whilst in the waiting room [14, [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] . The most obvious of these would be the reported transmission of SARS and pandemic influenza, however, infectious diseases such as gastroenteritis, scabies, tuberculosis, other airborne organisms and pertussis are well represented [14, [21] [22] [23] 25, 27, 29, 30] . Emergency department clinical staff, particularly those who have first contact with presenting patients, must be familiar with common infectious disease as well as those that are emerging or re-emerging locally and globally [13, 20, 31, 32] .",

Therefore these tests can be used to validate the use of TBP for patients who are identified as requiring them through syndromic surveillance or the cessation/modification of TBP if the syndromic assessment is not substantiated [55] . In doing this a reduction in ED bed pressure can be achieved as patients are able to be cohorted and/or accommodated via other appropriate mechanisms [54, 55] . Unfortunately implementation of POCT in many EDs is not seen as feasible due to funding and space requirements. Studies into the cost/benefit of such systems are required and should include the offset costs of reduced ED bed pressure and increased through put.",

Assisting triage and ED staff through training and real time syndromic surveillance methods, including POCT where applicable, can facilitate better outcomes. There are however areas in the research, such as observation of the application of TBP at triage and in the ED setting generally, that warrant further investigation. While undertaking this narrative review of the literature it has become clear that a more robust systematic quantitative literature review is required. Despite this, a paucity of evidence has been found around the appropriate application of TBP in the ED setting at times when heightened awareness is not occurring.",
