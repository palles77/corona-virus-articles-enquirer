It was found that simultaneous application of these heterogeneous and homogeneous AOPs (UV/TiO 2 /H 2 O 2 or S 2 O 8 2\u2212 ) is not desirable due to some physico-chemical retarding effects. The influence of temperature on the reactions was examined in the range of 15-45 \u2022 C and a kinetic power law model jointed with the Arrhenius equation was introduced. A pseudo first order reaction rate is appropriate for UV/S 2 O 8 2\u2212 and UV/TiO 2 processes under optimum conditions, while this order for UV/H 2 O 2 process is 2.27. Meanwhile, the initial rates of degradation in UV/TiO 2 process can be described well by the Langmuir-Hinshelwood kinetic model. Analysis of energy consumptions (thermal and electrical) revealed that increasing in temperature is an effective factor for lowering the energy cost of the preferred process of UV/S 2 O 8 2\u2212 .",

            "text": "Advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) can be used as promising techniques for in situ destruction and mineralization of many organics in water and wastewater [6, 7] . AOPs are based on the generation of very reactive species such as \u2022 OH and SO 4 \u2022\u2212 radicals that quickly oxidize a broad range of organic pollutants [8, 9] . But unlike the non specific oxidation ability of hydroxyl radicals, sulfate radicals act as a relatively selective oxidant that react with certain organic compounds, especially benzene derivatives with ring activating groups [10] . AOPs can be separated into heterogeneous (e.g. UV/TiO 2 ) and homogeneous (e.g. UV/H 2 O 2 and UV/KPS) systems. UV/TiO 2 process is based on the use of ultraviolet light ( < 400 nm) and TiO 2 semiconductor photocatalyst. TiO 2 has received increasing attention because of its low cost, relatively high chemical stability, and the possibility of using sunlight as a source of irradiation [11] [12] [13] . The process is initiated by UV irradiation of the semiconductor to excite an electron from the valence band (VB) to the conduction band (CB) resulting in formation of a high energy electron-hole pairs (Eq. (1)). The highly oxidative valence band hole (redox potential of 2.8 V) may directly react with the surface-sorbed organic molecule or indirectly via the formation of \u2022 OH radicals [14] . The reaction of the photo-generated holes with hydroxyl ions and water molecules adsorbed on the surface of TiO 2 yields hydroxyl radicals (Eq. (4)) [15, 16] as well. Also, the conduction band electron (e CB \u2212 ) is negative enough to reduce the oxygen molecules, present in the solution (Eq. (3)). The generated hydroxyl radicals are powerful oxidizing agents and attack organic pollutants, present at the surface of TiO 2 or near it (within 500 m) and of course the reaction rate of hydroxyl radicals with pollutants decreases as the distance from surface increases [17] . Dissolved oxygen plays an important role in TiO 2 photocatalysis reaction to assure sufficient electron scavengers present to trap the excited conduction-band electron from recombination [18] . These functions cause the degradation of dye according to the following reactions (R is an organic compound) [7, 17, 19] :",

Potassium persulfate (KPS) recently was shown to be an effective disinfectant and/or oxidant for the Norwalk virus, foot and mouth disease and Coro-naviridae (causing severe acute respiratory syndromes SARS) [24] . It has also been reported to be effective for degrading organics in hazardous wastewaters in acidic or basic media through direct chemical oxidation [25] .

Adding TiO 2 particles in the solution causes two different effects: (i) rising active catalyst surface which leads to generating more active species in the media and more degradation efficiency, (ii) increas- ing the media turbidity which leads to a decrease in the amount of lights, reached to the catalyst surface and hence, diminishing the degradation efficiency. These two opposite effects will result an optimum amount for the catalyst dosage. This optimum value is attributed to the geometry and working conditions of the photoreactor where the surface reaction is initiated upon light photon absorption [35] . When the amount of TiO 2 increases, the solution turbidity will increase and the excess TiO 2 particles can create a light scattering effect that reduces the surface area of TiO 2 being exposed to light illumination and the photo-catalytic efficiency. In general, this phenomenon is called as \"inner filtration effect\" in photo-catalysis [36] . Therefore, any chosen photo-reactor should operate below this limit of TiO 2 dosage, to avoid excess catalyst and ensure efficient photons absorption [20] . Fig. 4 shows an improvement in degradation efficiency from 13.6% to 41.1% when catalyst concentration is increased and then decreases. The positive effect of adding TiO 2 particle is intense up to 5 mg/L and then will be mild, because of reaching to inner filtration effect. The catalyst concentration, therefore, can be limited to 5 mg/L, while the degradation efficiency is remained around the maximum level. The subsequent relevant experiments were performed using this concentration of TiO 2 particle.",

As it is observed, TX-100 can be photo-degraded with UV irradiation. The corresponding degradation after 60 min is around 13.6% under natural pH. In photolysis, substrate can degrade by a combination of direct photolysis (decomposition of organic molecules by bond cleavage) and photooxidation (with generated free radicals) [38, 39] .

The case of pseudo first order reaction is in agreement with the results of other related researches [23, 29, 49] .

A reduction in the required electrical energy for treating 1 m 3 of the substrate solution is appropriate, when temperature is increased. Considering the natural gas as the most common industrial used fuel for supplying thermal energy and its average heat of combustion which is about 39 MJ/m 3 (corresponding to 0 \u2022 C and 101.3 kPa) and also its cost in U.S. (about 5.07 US$/28 m 3 ) [53]; meanwhile, the cost for supplying 1 kWh industrial electricity in U.S. (about 0.065 US$) [53]; therefore, total cost of treatment process (E E + E Q ) can be calculated at various temperatures (15 \u2022 C is considered as the base temperature). The results are given in Fig. 13 . It can be seen that by increasing in temperature, the total treatment cost is decreased considerably (despite significant increase in thermal energy cost). This matter is due to the significant enhancement in degradation efficiency with temperature, as discussed in Section 3.4.

(ii) Appling homogenous AOPs, UV/H 2 O 2 and UV/KPS under the optimum conditions of pH and temperature in addition to 270.3 mg/L of KPS or 34.0 mg/L of H 2 O 2 results a 80.9% degradation of TX-100 in 60 min and a perfect degradation of it in only 30 min, respectively. (iv) Homogenous AOPs are more effective than heterogeneous one and UV/KPS process can be introduced as the best. (v) Simultaneous application of homogeneous oxidants with UV/TiO 2 process cannot be desirable due to some retarding physico-chemical phenomena. (vi) A pseudo first order kinetic model, including temperature parameter, can adequately describe the degradation rate for the processes of UV/KPS and UV/TiO 2 , but an order of 2.27 for UV/H 2 O 2 process. (vii) The Langmuir-Hinshelwood kinetic model showed a good agreement for the initial rates of degradation for UV/TiO 2 process. (viii) The COD removal in the case of UV/KPS reaches to 61.2% after 60 min.
