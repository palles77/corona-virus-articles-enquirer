First, we observed three types of antibody responses in COVID-19 patients, strong, weak and non-response. Second, we found that the earlier response, higher antibody titer and higher proportion of strong responders for IgM and IgG were significantly associated with disease severity. Third, the weak responders for IgG antibodies had a significantly higher viral clearance rate than that of strong responders. These data indicates strong antibody response is associated with disease severity, and weak antibody response is associated with viral clearance, which resembles SARS 21 and MERS 15 .

This may have epidemiological significance and need further investigations in large-scale cohorts.No major differences were found between the clinical characteristics of patients in this Chongqing cohort and those reported in Wuhan 2,10-12 . However, few patients had kidney injury. During one-month observation, half severe patients and most non-severe patients were discharged, which indicates milder illness of this cohort compared with relatively more severe infections of Wuhan patients reported. Through epidemic alarm from government and media, patients with fever and upper respiratory tract symptoms were asked to go to hospital at an early stage 13 .We characterized SARS-CoV-2 viral dynamics in a hospitalized patient cohort. Our data provideimportant findings for this newly discovered virus infection in human. First, unlike SARS-CoV 14 and MERS-CoV infection 15 , SARS-CoV-2 viral shedding in the nasopharyngeal swabs, sputum and stools appeared in the early phase (3-5 days from symptom onset), peaked in the first week, decreased in the second week, and persisted up to 38 days from illness onset. The viral load was highest in sputum, higher in nasopharyngeal and lower in stools. Second, SARS-CoV-2 shedding in sputum is much longer and stable than that in nasopharyngeal and stool. Third, SARS-CoV-2 RNA was just detected sparsely with low loads in the plasma and urine of minor patients. Forth, it is cough but not fever aligns with the viral shedding in nasopharyngeal and sputum. Our analysis suggests that the viral RNA shedding pattern of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 resembles that of patients with influenza 16 and appears different from that seen in patients infected with SARS-CoV 14 and MERS-CoV 17 . Although viral RNA in the nasopharyngeal swab disappears quickly, testing of multiple types of samples, including nasopharyngeal, sputum and faecal samples",
