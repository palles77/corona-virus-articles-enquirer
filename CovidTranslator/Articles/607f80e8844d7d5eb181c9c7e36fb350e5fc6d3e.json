The type I IFN receptor (IFNAR) is composed of subunits IFNAR1 and IFNAR2; the type II IFN receptor (IFNGR) is made up of subunits IFNGR1 and IFNGR2; and the type III IFN receptor (IFNLR) consists of subunits IFNLR1 and IL-10R\u03b2, the latter of which is shared by the IL-10 receptor. Of the three Interferon (IFN)-mediated antiviral responses are central to host defence against viral infection. Despite the existence of at least 20 IFNs, there are only three known cell surface receptors. IFN signalling and viral evasion mechanisms form an immensely complex network that differs across species. In this Review, we begin by highlighting some of the advances that have been made towards understanding the complexity of differential IFN signalling inputs and outputs that contribute to antiviral defences. Next, we explore some of the ways viruses can interfere with, or circumvent, these defences. Lastly, we address the largely under-reviewed impact of IFN signalling on host tropism, and we offer perspectives on the future of research into IFN signalling complexity and viral evasion across species.",

Each class of IFN-type I, II and III-signals through a distinct heterodimeric receptor and induces gene expression through the Janus kinase-signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK-STAT) signalling pathway (Fig. 1 ). In humans, type I IFNs are comprised of IFN-\u03b2, 13 subtypes of IFN-\u03b1, as well as IFN-\u03b5 and IFN-\u03c9. A number of distantly related genes and pseudogenes have been identified in other species and are included in the type I classification. Three type III IFNs (IFN-\u03bb1, IFN-\u03bb2 and IFN-\u03bb3) were simultaneously discovered by two groups in 2003 and shown to be structurally related to interleukin-10 (IL-10) (refs. 9, 10 ) . A fourth type III IFN, IFN-\u03bb4, was identified in 2013 and was associated with impaired clearance of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection 11 . The type II IFN class has only one member: IFN-\u03b3. Given that type II fits the classic model of one ligand for one receptor, this Review will focus only on type I and III IFNs.",

Type I IFN signalling within humans antagonizes innumerable viruses, such as influenza virus, West Nile virus (WNV), yellow fever virus (YFV), vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), dengue virus (DENV), herpes simplex virus (HSV) and several hepatitis viruses 13 . As such, evading type I IFN signalling is crucial for viruses to successfully replicate within their hosts, as is demonstrated by many flaviviruses; Zika virus (ZIKV), Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), WNV and DENV are all able to antagonize type I IFN signalling in human cells to promote replication of their genomes 14 . Deleting individual type I IFNs in vivo has revealed some of their specific roles during viral infection: within its extensive repertoire of immune functions, IFN-\u03b2 is required for the production of IFN-\u03b1 during vaccinia virus infection 15 and IFN-\u03b5 protects the female reproductive tract against HSV (ref. 16 ). Less is known about type III IFNs, although studies have shown they are critical for antagonism of many viruses, particularly at epithelial surfaces 17 . However, across type I and III IFNs, there are vast differences with respect to their regulation and signalling outputs, which can dictate viral evasion strategies and ultimately impact host and tissue tropism.",

While many aspects of IFNs have been reviewed extensively elsewhere 12, 13, 18 , this Review will attempt to construct a holistic picture of the complicated relationship between IFN signalling and viral infection. To this end, we will progressively expand in scope with each section. We will begin at the level of individual IFN receptors, then broaden out to a discussion of IFN-mediated antiviral defences. We will then tackle some of the ways viruses can modulate or evade these defences. Lastly, we will consider how this intricate relationship between viruses and IFNs impacts host tropism. receptors, only IFNGR has one ligand: IFN-\u03b3 (ref. 19 ). In contrast, the type I and III receptors are shared by many IFNs. While the type I receptor is present on all nucleated cell types, the type III receptor is restricted mainly to epithelial cells, although some studies have observed that other cell types-such as epithelial cells 20 and neutrophils 21 -are responsive to type III IFNs. Evidence suggests that type I and III IFNs can differentially engage their receptor to produce different signalling outcomes 22, 23 .",

Other factors that could not be extensively addressed here include post-translational modifications, epigenetics and epitranscriptomic regulation of IFN signalling components 24, 25 . Among epigenetic modifications are STAT-mediated acetylation of histone H3 (ref. 26 ) and IFN-stimulated ubiquitination of histone 2B (ref. 27 ), both of which are associated with elevated expression of ISGs. Epitranscriptomic regulation includes RNA modifications by adenosine deaminases acting on RNA that inhibit IFN signalling 28 . Combinations of all of these factors may allow the type I and type III IFN receptors to process a dynamic range of signalling inputs during viral infection.

This stability can be influenced by numerous factors, among which is ligand binding strength. Across type I IFNs, ligand binding affinities for IFNAR vary significantly, with IFN-\u03b2 displaying the strongest affinity 32 . Differences in binding affinities appear to arise from the specific interactions each IFN makes with its receptor in addition to conserved ligand anchor points 33 . Type I IFNs that bind more strongly form a more stable ternary complex with the two receptor subunits, potentially resulting in increased binding duration 34, 35 . Binding of type III IFNs with IFNLR forms a similar ternary complex, the stability of which increases when ligands are engineered to bind more strongly 36 . These studies suggest that stronger ligand binding affinities can stabilize the type I and type III receptors by increasing the duration of binding between the receptor subunits and ligand.",

For example, type I and type III IFN signalling induces expression of ubiquitin-specific protease 18 (USP18) (ref. 37 ), rendering the type I IFN receptor insensitive to IFN-\u03b1 but not to IFN-\u03b2, thus implicating USP18 in the differential signalling activities of type I IFNs (ref. 38 ). Since overall IFN receptor expression remains unaltered, USP18 may participate in regulating receptor plasticity by preventing IFN-\u03b1 (but not IFN-\u03b2) subtypes from recruiting IFNAR1 to the type I receptor complex 39 . Other well-characterized negative feedback mechanisms involve suppressor of cytokine signalling (SOCS) proteins, namely SOCS1 and SOCS3, whose targets include JAK1 (ref. 40 ) and tyrosine kinase 2 (TYK2) (ref. 41 ), which otherwise cross-phosphorylate to propagate the IFN signal relay and stabilize the receptor subunits. STAT proteins 1-6 have complicated roles in either propagating IFN signals or fine-tuning the cascade. For example, IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2-induced expression of STAT3 negatively regulates type I IFN signalling by sequestering STAT1 monomers 42 or targeting transcription of IFN signalling components 43 . Strikingly, type III IFN signalling is negatively regulated by SOCS1, but not by SOCS3 or USP18 (ref. 44 ). These data indicate that negative regulatory mechanisms contribute to different signalling outcomes for type I IFNs, as well as the observed signalling differences between type I and III IFNs.",

Increased expression of these components in response to IFN-\u03b2 prolongs expression of ISGs, resulting in enhanced viral resistance 46 . In addition to promoting the secretion of cytokines, positive feedback mechanisms can lock cells into an autocrine signalling loop that sustains IFN signal transduction 47 . Many positive regulatory mechanisms are cell type-specific, but certain factors such as IRF7 are thought to be common across many tissues 48 .

The first ISGs discovered (now considered 'classical ISGs') were shown to induce potent antiviral responses by themselves (for example, Mx proteins 61 or Protein kinase R (ref. 62 )). Over time, however, the identification of less-potent ISGs indicates that weaker ISGs work together to temper the immune response depending on the type and magnitude of infection 59 .

Some viruses are targeted primarily at a specific point during infection; for example, many ISGs that target HCV do so during translation of the entering genome 63 . Other viruses, such as DENV and WNV, are targeted by a number of ISGs at multiple stages of the viral replication cycle 65 . ISGs can exert virus-specific activities; for example, IFN-\u03b1inducible protein 6 was found to selectively inhibit replication of certain flaviviridae family viruses by interfering with the formation of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) microenvironments 66 . Combinations of ISGs frequently increase defences against viruses. Additive effects were observed when pairs of ISGs were tested against viruses from different families, such as HCV, HIV-1 and YFV (ref. 63 ). ISG feedback loops also enhance or fine-tune antiviral effects by regulating expression of other ISGs or IFNs (ref. 45 ). In particularly striking cases, ISGs act in a manner that appears pro-viral on first glance. While some ISGs may indeed be co-opted by viruses to facilitate viral infection, others with curiously 'pro-viral' functions may in fact be working to fine-tune the IFN response against viral infection. For example, in humans (but not mice), ISG15 interacts with In early studies aiming to understand IFN signalling outputs, differential ISG outputs and cellular responses were linked with variations in the receptor-binding affinities of IFNs. Type I IFNs that bind more strongly to IFNAR, such as IFN-\u03b2, induce a subset of ISGs that are not expressed by the binding of weaker IFNs; furthermore, universally expressed ISGs are induced to a greater extent by IFN-\u03b2 (refs. 64, 69 ) . A linear correlation exists between the binding affinities of type I IFNs and their anti-proliferative potency; however, the relationship between receptor-binding affinity and antiviral activity is less straightforward 32 . Although the signalling outputs of type III IFNs have been less thoroughly explored, an engineered IFN-\u03bb that binds IFNLR with increased affinity leads to a corresponding increase in antiviral activity 36 . In contrast, increasing the binding affinity of a synthetic type I IFN does not increase antiviral activity compared with wild-type IFN, which may suggest that type I IFNs already exert their maximal antiviral potency 36 . Future studies should continue to explore how other factors contribute to the complexity of IFN-mediated transcriptional and antiviral signalling outputs.",

Further research suggests that type III IFN signalling acts as the first line of defence in the lung epithelium during early influenza virus infection, and subsequent signalling by type I IFNs may offer enhanced protection during the later stages of viral spread 72 . Additionally, a comprehensive analysis of the antiviral landscape in mice infected with influenza virus found diverse antiviral gene signatures, indicating that the magnitude or number of rounds of influenza infection dictates the nature of IFN protection 73 .

The organelle-damaging effects of certain viral infections signal to the host cell that something is amiss, prompting the cell to trigger antiviral responses through IFN signalling. In a healthy cell, ER stress induced by the unfolded protein response leads to ER-associated protein degradation 84 . Conversely, in a cell infected with influenza A virus (IAV), a potent antiviral response is triggered by the overproduction of viral haemagglutinin glycoproteins which stimulate the unfolded protein response 85 , offering a new perspective on the role of the ER during viral infection. Further, the homocysteine-induced ER protein (HERP), induced by the unfolded protein response and by ER stress, is implicated in antiviral immunity against IAV and several other RNA viruses. Mitochondrial antiviral signalling protein (MAVS), a vital host protein involved in the retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) like receptor (RLR)-IFN signalling cascade, was shown to enhance HERP expression following viral infection 86 . HERP then binds TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) to amplify the MAVS signalling cascade 86 , which, in turn, represses the replication of several RNA viruses, including Sendai virus (SeV), IAV, VSV and enterovirus 71 (EV71) (ref. 86 ) (Fig. 4) . Similarly, viruses such as DENV and ZIKV can cause mitochondrial damage through elongation induced by viral non-structural proteins during infection 87 , but, in the past few years, several studies have come to conflicting conclusions regarding cellular defences against RNA virus-induced damage to this vital organelle, as outlined below. It has been shown that IFNs can be induced in healthy cells when mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) stress is induced by a deficiency in mtDNA binding protein 88 . This points to a role played by the fidelity and/or decompartmentalization of mtDNA in antiviral signalling. On the one hand, viruses from different viral families can prompt leakage of mtDNA into the cytosol, stimulating the DNA sensor cGAS, thereby elevating ISG expression through stimulator of IFN genes (STING)-IRF3 dependent signalling 88, 89 . DENV (an RNA virus) has evolved to disrupt this canonical DNA sensing pathway by virally encoded, protease-mediated cleavage of STING (refs. [89] [90] [91] . Additionally, the DENV non-structural protein NS4B causes mitochondrial elongation, compromising the integrity of ER-mitochondrial interfaces that are critical for RIG-I-mediated innate immune signalling 87 . Similarly, it was shown that other RNA viruses of diverse families, such as VSV, Sindbis virus, SeV, IAV and reovirus type 3 Dearing strain, all replicate at higher levels in cells expressing short-hairpin RNAs targeting STING (ref. 92 ). On the other hand, however, it is argued that STING exhibits an antiviral response through translational inhibition in an RLR-dependent manner and is not required for the sensing of leaked mtDNA due to organelle damage. This conclusion was drawn from findings that cells depleted of mtDNA are able to retain their ability to diminish viral RNA replication in a STING-dependent manner, and that STING-dependent translational inhibition does not depend on MAVS (ref. 92 ). These findings argue that RLR responses to RNA viral infections mediate IFN induction through MAVS and restrict viral translation through STING. Regardless of mechanism, RNA viruses must bypass these innate IFN signalling pathways to successfully and robustly replicate. More research is needed to understand the exact, and likely multifaceted, functions of STING during viral infection.",

HSV-1, a DNA alphaherpes virus, was shown to induce the relocalization of host-derived 5S ribosomal RNA pseudogene 141 (RNA5SP141) from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, where it binds RIG-I and induces the type I IFN response 93 . This occurs due to viral induced shutoff of RNA5SP141-interacting proteins, thus freeing RNA5SP141 for interaction with RIG-I; silencing of RNA5SP141 was shown to dampen the antiviral response to not only HSV-1, but also to Epstein-Barr virus and IAV (ref. 93 ). Further, host RNAs were shown to facilitate the host immune response to Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV), a gammaherpesvirus, which is capable of establishing latent and lysogenic infections. It was discovered that KSHV lytic reactivation from latency is restricted by RLRs through recognition of host-derived RNAs (ref. 94 ); this is accomplished by an infection-induced reduction in a cellular triphosphatase, leading to the accumulation of misprocessed, noncoding RNAs that are detected by RIG-I. These results, taken together with the above findings regarding cGAS-STING, demonstrate our recent advances in understanding the surprising interplay between the virus and host prior to IFN induction.",

Notably, YFV also uses its NS5 protein to antagonize STAT2 and the STAT-signalling pathway, but this requires events upstream of IFN signalling to take place (specifically, phosphorylation of STAT1 and polyubiquitination of YFV NS5) (ref. 106 ). Less closely related viruses, such as human parainfluenza virus types 1 and 3 (hPIV1 and hPIV3) and SeV, also antagonize the STAT-signalling pathway by inhibiting STAT protein phosphorylation and/or STAT nuclear translocation, thereby blunting ISG induction [107] [108] [109] [110] . Similarly, by mutating the critical residues of the STAT binding domain of rabies virus P protein, mice do not progress to a lethal neurological disease state, even following direct cranial inoculation by the mutant virus 111 , demonstrating that STAT inhibition is required for the lethality of the virus.

See Table 1 compare holistically and are typically carried out on a single-species level. This usually results in studies without sufficient power to understand and identify key evolutionary features, leaving it hard to draw meaningful conclusions from expanding data sets. The first piece of the puzzle is to understand how other species respond, or are immune to, varying infections that plague humans. Genomicor transcriptomic-based studies are useful to investigate these differences, but require a well-annotated reference genome for the species in question as well as an ample number of samples from different donors to ensure the data represents the larger population. Identifying gene orthologues between species can be fruitless without a complete or near-complete reference genome for each species of interest. However, these complications pale in comparison to what we can learn about host-pathogen interactions from analysing other species, and we can be continually surprised by how other hosts combat, or even tolerate, viral infections.",

These conserved ISGs highlight the longstanding role of the innate immune system in responding to different pathogens. Additionally, ISG expression patterns were more similar in more closely related species than distant ones, while 14 conserved IFN repressing genes were upregulated in all species that target different points in the type I IFN pathway, demonstrating the importance of avoiding excess stimulation of these pathways 112 .

Originally, it was thought that certain species of bats become asymptomatically infected with these viruses due to enhanced potency of their antiviral response. A new hypothesis has recently emerged that immune responses in bats are differentially regulated compared to other species, leading to tolerance rather than clearance of infection. This differential immune regulation may occur because the metabolic demands of flight cause DNA damage, which releases host mtDNA into the cytoplasm. This is exemplified by Egyptian Rousette bats (Rousette aegyptiacus), in which the type I IFN subfamily IFN-\u03c9 is expanded to almost two dozen subtypes, whereas humans only have one 115 . Some bat species constitutively express type I IFNs (namely IFN-\u03b1) (ref. 116 ), but IFN-\u03c9 subfamily genes are only highly induced in R. aegyptiacus following infection with VSV. Additionally, bats have a high occurrence of point mutations in the innate immune signalling protein, STING. The Ser 358 residue of STING is conserved across all non-bat mammals 117 and is a critical phosphorylation site for downstream IFN activation in these species. In bats, however, this residue can be mutated to asparagine, histidine or aspartic acid, preventing activation of cGAS-STING and thus resulting in a dampened innate immune response 117 . Taken together, these studies shed light on how bats evolved to differentially regulate innate immune signalling pathways, leading to infection tolerance and allowing them to be a reservoir for zoonotic pathogens. Notably, in other species such as mice, mutations in STING don't impart a tolerance of viral infection, but rather prevent infection by some viruses altogether. Mice do not support productive infection of many flaviviruses that affect humans, and one key mechanism behind this was recently elucidated. The viral protease NS2B3 in ZIKV, WNV and JEV, but not YFV, was found to mediate cleavage of human STING, increasing the permissiveness of mouse cells expressing human STING to ZIKV infection (including higher production of infectious particles and greater ZIKV RNA copy numbers) 14 ; strikingly, murine STING is not cleavable by viral proteases in DENV (ref. 118 ) or ZIKV (ref. 14 ), thereby restricting the ability of these viruses to infect mice. Notably, STING-deficient mice are not more susceptible to ZIKV infection, pointing to other redundant antiviral pathways controlling ZIKV infection in vivo 14 . However, cGAS-or STING-deficient mice are more likely to progress to lethal infection by several DNA viruses 119 , demonstrating the vital role of this IFN signalling pathway's ability to hinder viral replication following infection. Further, mouse STAT2, but not human STAT2, is known to restrict early DENV replication 96 , conferring additional resistance against DENV to mice. Similarly, the NS5 protein of ZIKV is able to bind and degrade human STAT2, but not mouse STAT2, preventing ZIKV from evading the innate immune response in mice 99, 100, 120 , and subsequently establishing a successful infection. Due to differing immune responses to differing infections, it can be hard to relevantly study these pathogens using mammalian model organisms. Recently, however, a large step forward for ZIKV was made by the generation of an immunocompetent mouse model for ZIKV infection. By garnering a key mutation in the NS4B gene of ZIKV to enhance replication in neuronal stem cells and the brain in mice, and replacing mouse STAT2 with human STAT2, an immunocompetent mouse model with which to study ZIKV was generated 121 , allowing for further research of this important human pathogen.",

Many factors have been proposed to explain how type I IFNs signal differently through their shared receptor. However, it is still unclear how many of these factors function individually as well as together. It is still relatively unknown as to what extent type III IFNs produce different signalling outputs and whether these outputs result from the same mechanisms that impact type I signalling. Further, given the complexity and vastness of ISG outputs uncovered by large-scale screening efforts, more work is needed to fully understand the transcriptional profiles associated with IFN signalling and their effect on viral antagonism. Future studies should continue to investigate the roles of upregulated ISGs and the antiviral consequences of downregulated genes in response to IFN signalling, which have been understudied so far.",

These affinities correspond with differences in certain signalling outputs. As of yet, the binding affinities of type III IFNs have not been calculated. (2) Negative regulation: gene products induced by IFN signalling have the ability to negatively regulate the cascade at various stages; for example, SOCS1 and SOCS3, which interfere with TYK2 and JAK1, and STAT3, which can suppress STAT1 monomers, preventing homodimerization. (3) Positive regulation and signal amplification: factors such as STAT1, IRF9 and IRF7 can enhance IFN signal transduction. This leads to prolonged expression and secretion of antiviral cytokines and IFNs that can adjust the IFN cascade or lock the cell into an autocrine signalling loop. (4) Receptor expression and assembly: levels of receptor expression at the cell membrane contribute to differential signalling abilities of IFNs across cell types. Further, alterations to receptor assembly, such as the kinetics of subunit endocytosis, can influence signalling. (5) Biomolecular condensation: formation of cellular compartments caused by phase separation of biomolecules appears to influence various stages of IFN signalling; for example, phase separation of cGAS facilitates sensing of viral genetic material to induce expression of IFNs.

Since ISG15 possesses well-documented antiviral properties68 , these findings point to a species-specific ability of ISG15 to adjust the IFN signalling cascade during the later stages of viral infection in humans. Such studies indicate that ISGs can modulate the host's antiviral response to fit the type of virus or stage of infection.",
