No effective treatment for this disease was verified, so the morbidity and mortality rate were supposed higher than flu. The Traditional Chinese Medicine is widely used in clinical practice in China, but many other countries of the world to deal with diseases that remain clinically challenging. Supportive therapies are mainly used in clinical practice, such as oxygen therapy, antiviral therapy and corticosteroid therapy, because there is no specific effective treatment 3 . According to past experiences in the treatment of infectious diseases in China, Traditional Chinese Medicine, including herbal formulas, can be used to prevent and treat such infectious disease [4] [5] . Therefore, Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) is widely used in the treatment of COVID-19 in China promptly. Here we introduce the herbal formulas that are commonly used in Chinese hospitals.",

Yupingfeng San, a kind of preventative patent medicine, is chosen because of the nature of the lungs' diseases, listed in table 1. Yupingfeng San is an ancient herbal medicine in TCM and used to protect lung Qi and avoid pathogenic Qi. In this medicine, there are three herbs: Astragalus, Fangfeng and Atractylodes. Astragalus can improve lung Qi and can reduce phlegm. Fangfeng can relieve the pathogenic Qi, remove dampness and relieve pain. Atractylodes enhances the spleen Qi, which can affect our digestion and absorption. Previous studies has shown that Yupingfeng San could regulate the body's immune function.

If the lung Qi does not work properly, it will cause lung heat and dampness and some typical symptoms, including fever, cough, sore throat and fatigue. So we used the method of \"clearing lung heat and dampness\" to treat it. Two types of prescriptions, called Sangju yin and Yinqiao san, are commonly used in clinical treatment, and are shown in table 2. The main function of these two prescriptions is to clear lung heat, expel phlegm, relieve cough, regulate the patient's lungs and restore normal lung function. Clinically, we chose Yinqiao san for patients who had high fever and Sangju yin for patients who had severe cough. Table 2 Two types of prescriptions for mild patients.",
