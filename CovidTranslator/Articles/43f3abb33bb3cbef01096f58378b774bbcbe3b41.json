Small interfering RNA (siRNA) offers a new tool with potential therapeutic applications for hepatitis B virus (HBV). Given the importance of sequence identity in the effectiveness of siRNA and the heterogeneity of HBV sequences among different isolates, a short hairpin RNA (shRNA)-expressing plasmid, pSuper/HBVS1, was developed to target a region conserved among major HBV genotypes and assess its effectiveness control of HBV. Methods: HBV replication-competent plasmid was cotransfected with pSuper/HBVS1 to HuH-7 cells or to mice. The levels of viral proteins, RNA, and DNA were examined in transfected cells and animals. The effects of pSuper/HBVS1 on clinical isolates with genotypes B and C were also determined. Results: pSuper/HBVS1 significantly decreased levels of viral proteins, RNA, and DNA for HBV genotype A in cell culture and in mice. Comparable suppressive effects were observed on clinical isolates of genotypes B and C. A clone with a silent mutation in the target region was identified from a patient with genotype C. This mutant revealed diminished sensitivity to pSuper/HBVS1 and could be selected out in the presence of pSuper/HBVS1 in cell culture. Conclusions: These findings indicated that shRNA could suppress HBV expression and replication for genotypes A, B, and C, promising an advance in treatment of HBV. However, the emergence of resistant mutants in HBV quasispecies should be considered.",

In plants, it serves as a host-defense mechanism against viruses and transposable elements (reviewed in Waterhouse et al 7 ) . After the discovery that RNAi pathways also exist in mammalian cells and that the use of siRNA can avoid cell death induced by dsRNA longer than 30 nucleotides, 8 siRNA has emerged as a novel therapeutic approach in the fight against human viral infections. This study therefore examined whether siRNA can in-hibit HBV replication and expression and exhibit the potential to combat chronic hepatitis B.",

However, variation of sequences among different viral isolates in clinical settings and emergence of resistant mutants constitute potential problems hindering the efficacy of siRNA. This work identified a target site for siRNA that is conserved among HBV genotypes A to G. A plasmid expressing shRNA targeted this site significantly inhibited the steps in HBV replication that occur in cultured cells and in mice.

Further testing concerned whether or not pSuper/HBVS1 could also inhibit the expression and replication of HBV with different genotypes from clinical isolates. Because genotypes B and C are the most prevalent genotypes in Asia, including Taiwan, this study focused on these 2 genotypes. The effect of pSuper/S1 was examined on a heterogeneous mixture of amplified HBV genomes from clinical samples without cloning. Full-length HBV genome of genotype B or C was amplified from the patient's serum by PCR. The PCR products were digested with SapI and transfected to HuH7 cells with pSuper/ HBVS1 or pSuper. A previous study has demonstrated that linear monomeric HBV genomes with SapI ends can initiate a full replication cycle, leading to viral antigen expression. 20 Our results showed that pSuper/HBVS1 could also suppress expression of HBsAg and HBeAg of HBV genotypes B and C from clinical isolates to a similar extent as on a laboratory clone of genotype A ( Figure 5 ).",

The results resembled those on PCR products (data not shown). Nevertheless, 1 of 10 clones from a patient with genotype C proved more resistant to pSuper/HBVS1, al- though the total PCR product from the same patient showed no obvious resistance to pSuper/HBVS1 treatment. After sequencing, this particular clone (pHBV-CI-m) was found to exhibit a silent mutation in the target sequence of pSuper/HBVS1 ( Figure 6A ). This mutation did not change the amino acid sequence of either the polymerase gene or the surface gene. Neither directly sequenced PCR product nor the other 9 clones from the same patients displayed this nucleotide change within the target sequence of pSuper/HBVS1, indicating that this mutant clone represents only a minor population. The next concern was whether or not this mutant clone would be selected out in the presence of pSuper/ HBVS1. Mimicking the heterogeneous population of HBV in patients, pHBV-CI-m was mixed with pHBV-CI-wt at a ratio of 1:9 and transfected to HuH-7 cells in the presence of pSuper/HBVS1 or pSuper. The HBV genome was purified in the culture supernatants at days 2 and 5 posttransfection. An HBV fragment covering the target sequence of pSuper/HBVS1 was amplified and the PCR products cloned. In the presence of pSuper/HBVS1, the proportion of HBV with mutant sequence was significantly increased at day 5 posttransfection, as reflected by the results from sequencing PCR products directly and at least 10 individual clones for each experiment. In the electropherogram of PCR product sequencing, it was evident that the dominant signal had changed from \"T\" to \"C\" for the sample treated with pSuper/HBVS1 at day 5 posttransfection but not at day 2 posttransfection ( Figure 6B ). Results of sequencing individual clones also revealed the increase of the mutant clone (summarized in Table 1 ). At day 2 posttransfection, ratios of mutant clone were quite similar for samples from cells cotransfected with pSuper or with pSuper/HBVS1 (20%). At day 5 posttransfection, the ratio rose significantly to 43% in the sample treated with pSuper/HBVS1, and the ratio remained at 25% for the sample treated with vector pSuper alone (Table 1 ). In another independent experiment, the ratios of mutant clones from cells transfected with pSuper/HBVS1 and pSuper were 30% and 10%, respectively, at day 5 posttransfection.

What makes pSuper/HBVS1 distinctive is that its target site is the only one conserved for 7 HBV major genotypes (A to G) among all siRNA target sequences published so far. Only genotype H contains a nucleotide difference within the pSuper/HBVS1 target sequence. Nucleotide 472 (the same nucleotide in the previously identified pSuper/HBVS1 resistant clone) is G in genotype H rather than T in other genotypes. Nevertheless, genotype H is not common worldwide. Given the high heterogeneity of HBV sequences and the sensitivity of siRNA to the changes of sequences, 28 it is advantageous to design potent siRNA targeting highly conserved regions among various HBV isolates. However, it is very challenging to develop an siRNA targeting highly conserved regions and also being very effective for HBV. In fact, pSuper/ HBVS1 is the only one found so far. Conservation of an siRNA target sequence can generalize the utility of siRNA to different HBV genotypes and strains, as illustrated by the suppressive effects of pSuper/HBVS1 on the expression of HBV genotypes A, B, and C in this study. Although the inhibitory effects of pSuper/HBVS1 on other genotypes were not tested because of lack of clinical samples, pSuper/HBVS1 very likely can suppress the expression of other genotypes with the conserved target sequence.",

            "text": "Although this and other studies have proved the feasibility of using siRNA to control HBV expression and replication in vivo and in vitro, emergence of resistant mutants may be problematic. Previous studies on using siRNA to control replication of human immunodeficiency virus or poliovirus in culture have noted the emergence of resistant mutants. 29 -32 These resistant mutants either emerged de novo with molecularly cloned viral genomes 29, 30 or were likely present in the initial virus population and selected out in the presence of siRNA. 32 In this study, an HBV variant with a silent mutation within the target site of pSuper/HBVS1 was found from one HBV chronic carrier. To our knowledge, this is the first experimental proof that resistant mutant indeed preexists in the quasispecies of HBV patients. Data were also presented supporting the notion that this mutant can be selected out in the presence of siRNA. This finding, together with others, underlines the importance of sequence identity of siRNA to its target sequence to be effective. Combinations of multiple siRNA targeting separate regions of the genome can alleviate the problem of resistant mutants. Use of siRNA targeting functionally indispensable and conserved regions can further minimize this problem, reducing the numbers of siRNA used and therefore the cost. For pSuper/HBVS1, the mutation identified for pHBV-CI-m at nucleotide 472 caused silent mutation for both surface and polymerase genes within this conserved target region. In genotype H, the difference at nucleotide 472 left unchanged the amino acid sequence of HBV surface proteins, causing Leu to Val conservative change in the polymerase reading frame. These findings implied that probably only very few mutations can be tolerated by HBV within pSuper/HBVS1 target sequence. Therefore, preventing the emergence of resistant clones can be simply achieved by including shRNA against the mutant sequence. This problem may also be overcome by combining with other antiviral strategies or siRNA targeting host factors that are dispensable for cell but essential for virus. Because all HBV transcripts overlap in their C terminals, a single shRNA targeting multiple critical transcripts simultaneously could be designed to maximize the inhibitory potency. In this regard, pSuper/HBVS1 targets all HBV major transcripts except X mRNA. Interestingly, this investigation found that pSuper/ HBVS1 suppressed the expression of HBsAg more efficiently than that of HBeAg, although it targeted the same sequence on the transcripts for these 2 proteins. In contrast, the S-target siRNA used by Klein et al resulted in greater suppression of HBeAg than HBsAg. 18 Song et al also noticed that the same siRNA could have varying suppressive effects against human immunodeficiency virus in different cell types. 33 Currently, it is uncertain why siRNA exerts differential suppressive effects on the same target sequence on different RNA molecules or in different cell types. One possible speculation is that the target sequence in different RNA molecules may have different secondary structures or are bound with different proteins and thus make their accessibility to the same siRNA different.",

            "text": "In natural infections, HBV uses covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA) as the template for transcription. Therefore, to treat chronic HBV infection, the siRNA needs to either sustain in the infected hepatocytes to continuously degrade HBV RNA or to inactivate cccDNA from transcription. Thus far, siRNA-induced gene silencing in mammalian cells seems to be transient because of the likely lack of the RNA silencing-amplification mechanism present in worms and plants. 34 Recently developed lentivirus, retrovirus, and adenovirusassociated virus (AAV)-based shRNA expression vectors may provide a promising approach for long-term expression in mammals, although safety issues would be a concern. The effect of siRNA/shRNA on cccDNA of HBV would not be easy to address in the experimental systems used in the current study. Neither HCC cells transfected with HBV DNA nor mice hydrodynamically injected with HBV DNA have been generally proficient in providing cccDNA templates for pregenomic RNA synthesis. 26, 35 Recent advances in inducing DNA methylation by siRNA in human cells 36, 37 have shed light on using siRNA to inactivate HBV cccDNA from transcription. Further studies will address the effects of siRNA on HBV cccDNA.",

The quick advances of siRNA technology, including optimization of target sequences, improvement of delivery methods, and expression vectors, would definitely render siRNA more clinically feasible and useful in the future. Furthermore, more knowledge of the working mechanisms of the siRNA-mediated effect on DNA genome and systemic silencing in plants and other organisms (reviewed in Agrawal 38 ) would facilitate the development of strategies to induce these activities in mammalian cells. By then, siRNA will have become an even more potent and ideal therapeutic agent for HBV as well as other viral infections.",
