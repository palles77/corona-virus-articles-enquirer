HRI is the only stress kinase required 324 for translational inhibition in response to arsenite treatment in mouse embryonic 325 fibroblasts [27] . HRI kinase can also be activated by other cellular stresses including 326 osmotic stress and heat shock. To further assess if the enhanced reovirus infectivity 327 following sodium arsenite treatment was a consequence of HRI activation, we assessed 328 viral protein expression, the percentage of infected cells and viral yield in response to 329 heat shock. We used stress granule induction in response to heat shock as an indirect 330 measure of HRI activation ( Figure 4A ). Our attempts to induce stress granules in CV-1 331 cells with heat shock were only able to achieve no greater than 25% of cells containing 332 stress granules. Because of this, we assessed the effects of heat shock induction of stress 333 granules in L929 cells. Heat shock for 45 minutes at 44\u00b0C resulted in ~88% of L cells 334 containing stress granules ( Figure 4A ). Similar to our observations in CV-1 cells pre-335 treated with sodium arsenite, viral protein expression was enhanced at 10 and 18 h p.i. in 336 L cells exposed to a 45 min heat shock prior to infection ( Figure 4B ). However, heat 337 shock activation had no impact on the percentage of infected cells or viral yield in L cells 338 ( Figures 4C-E) . These findings suggest that in L-cells, heat shock enhances protein 339 expression, but does not affect either the numbers of infected cells or the per cell yield of 340 virus. Although heat shock activates HRI kinase, its effect on cells differs from sodium 341 arsenite. Together, these data indicate that sodium arsenite pre-treatment perturbs the cell 342 in a way that is beneficial for reovirus compared to other activators of the HRI kinase. 343 344 All rights reserved.

To 260 facilitate translation, cellular factors including eIF3, eIF4G and ribosomal subunits are 261 recruited to the viral factory [23]. Many of these initiation factors are similarly 262 compartmentalized within stress granules [24]. To date, most studies have focused on the 263 induction of stress granules in response to viral infection, or viral suppression of stress 264 granule formation during an infection. To our knowledge, no studies have been 265 performed to assess the impact of the presence of stress granules on reovirus infection. 266",

We then assessed the percentage of infected cells at 18 h p.i.. Consistent with our 354 previous data, pre-treatment (-0.5 h p.i.) with sodium arsenite prior to inoculation with 355 virus resulted in an increase in the percentage of infected cells (Figures 5A-B). Although 356 pre-treatment had the greatest impact on reovirus permissivity, treatment with sodium 357 arsenite at 0, 1, 2 and 4 h p.i. resulted in an increased percentage of infected cells as 358 compared to untreated reovirus-infected cells (Figures 5A-B). Addition of sodium 359 arsenite at 6 h p.i. or later had no effect on the percentage of infected cells at 18 h p.i. 360(Figures 5A-B).

The effect of SA was greatest when added 449 before reovirus adsorption but was still beneficial if treatment occurred within the first 4 450 h of infection. Translation of reovirus mRNAs rises sharply at ~ 6 h p.i. and peaks at ~12 451 h p.i. [30]. Given that the rising level of viral protein synthesis is concomitant with 452 continued host protein synthesis, it is possible that SA treatment selectively reduces the 453 translational machinery available for host protein synthesis [30].

            "text": "460 It is known that under times of stress and reduced availability of active eIF2, cells 461 can utilize other initiation factors to ensure translation of select mRNAs. These factors, 462 including eIF2A, eIF2D, ligatin, MCT-1/DENR, and N-terminally truncated eIF5B 479-463 1220 , can promote efficient recruitment of Met-tRNA Met i to the 40S/mRNA complex under 464 varying circumstances [35-39]. Several viruses take advantage of these alternative 465 initiation pathways including Sindbis virus and poliovirus [36, 39]. We have noted that 466 two of these factors, eIF2A and eIF5B localize to viral factories within infected cells 467 (unpublished observations, JSLP). As yet, we do not know if these factors play a 468 functional role in translation of viral mRNAs within VFs or if they are being sequestered 469 to prevent cellular mRNA translation. 470 We cannot exclude the possibility that pre-treatment of cells with SA has other 471 effects that promote viral replication independently of eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation. Reovirus 472 is an oncolytic virus, preferentially infecting cancer cells. This phenomenon has been 473 linked to a mutationally-active Ras pathway, however reports have been conflicting 474 regarding Ras dependency [40-43]. Cancer cells have elevated levels of chaperones that 475 facilitate the high levels of protein synthesis typical of transformed cells. The efficiency 476 of mRNA translation is increased in the presence of supplemental recombinant Hsc70 477 and the rate of translation elongation may be regulated by chaperone availability [44]. 478",
