Aspiration pneumonia usually is manifest as infiltrates in the superior or basilar segments of either lower lobe or the posterior segments of the upper lobes, depending on the position of the patient at the time of aspiration. Legionella infections frequently begin with patchy bronchopneumonia or poorly marginated nodular densities, but later this progresses to lobar or multilobar consolidation; cavitation is unlikely without superimposed bacterial infection. Newly diagnosed pulmonary tuberculosis in the adult may present various roentgenographic patterns other than upper lobe infiltrates with or without cavitation,30 lower lobe infiltrates, pleural effusions, and hilar adenopathy.",

However, bacteremic pneumococcal pneumonia may be Gram's stain-positive and sputum culture-negative. 3 Some investigators believe that sputum samples in which there are more than 10 epithelial cells per 100 X field should be rejected for culture because this indicates upper airway contamination. 36 Since the clinician uses information from many sources other than the sputum culture in making the diagnosis of pneumonia and in determining its cause, sputum samples generally are acceptable if they con-tain 25 or more leukocytes per 100 X field. 44 The most purulent portion of the specimens should be Gram's stained and cultured. The Gram's stain and culture of sputum are only two sources of information that are helpful in differential diagnosis and in planning treatment.
