The EV genus now contains more than 100 genotypes, and the HPeV species contains 16 genotypes (www.picornaviridae.com). As the number of genotypes increases, the diagnostic methods need to be validated and updated if necessary in order to ensure a high sensitivity and specificity.

Therefore, it seemed prudent to develop a diagnostic test that included both EV and HPeV. Consequently, the EV assay in use at Statens Serum Institut (SSI) was updated and combined with a previously published HPeV assay (Baumgarte et al., 2008) , thereby creating a multiplex one-step real-time RT-PCR (reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction) assay for simultaneous detection of EV and HPeV.

A contemporary study by Bennett et al. (2011) has also described an enterovirus parechovirus multiplex PCR assay. Their study used two published EV and HPeV assays in multiplex format comparing two commercially available enzyme kits. In this study a new enterovirus assay has been developed and combined with an established parechovirus assay, and the functionality of this multiplex assay has been demonstrated. A continuous revalidation and update of existing EV assays is essential as the number of viruses has been increasing considerably over the last few years. Both the multiplex assay by Bennett et al. (2011) and the assay presented in this paper have been evaluated with the 2010 EV/HPeV QCMD panel. The same high sensitivity for EV was found with both tests, whereas the method presented by Bennett et al. seems to be slightly more sensitive for HPeV-3 as their method alone could detect the highest dilution (10 \u22126 ) of HPeV-3.",
