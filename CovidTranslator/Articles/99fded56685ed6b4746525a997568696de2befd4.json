Cross-species transmission appears to be quite common among bats, which may contribute to their unique reservoir potential. Therefore, understanding the importance of bats as reservoirs requires examining them in a community context rather than concentrating on individual species. Here, we use a network approach to identify ecological and biological correlates of cross-species virus transmission in bats and rodents, another important host group. We show that given our current knowledge the bat viral sharing network is more connected than the rodent network, suggesting viruses may pass more easily between bat species. We identify host traits associated with important reservoir species: gregarious bats are more likely to share more viruses and bats which migrate regionally are important for spreading viruses through the network. We identify multiple communities of viral sharing within bats and rodents and highlight potential species traits that can help guide studies of novel pathogen emergence.",

In addition, many bat species are gregarious, living in dense aggregations, and some roosting sites can house diverse assemblages of bat species (Kunz 1982; Kuzmin et al. 2010) , which could facilitate transmission of pathogens and sustain acute-immunising infections. In evolutionary terms, bats are ancient mammals, and it has been hypothesised that viruses that evolved in bats may use conserved cellular receptors enhancing their ability to transmit viruses to other mammals (Calisher et al. 2006) . The diet of some species has been hypothesised to facilitate transmission of viruses; after feeding, frugivorous bats often leave partially eaten fruit behind which can be contaminated with viruses (Chua et al. 2002; Dobson 2005) . Bats are the second most diverse mammalian order with over 1100 species, with many overlapping species distributions; multiple regions across the globe are home to more than 40 bat species, allowing for species to interact and potentially spread viruses between them ( Fig. 1 ; Calisher et al. 2006; Luis et al. 2013) .",

However, we collapse the bipartite network (separate nodes for viruses and host species) to a unipartite projection, weighting contacts between host species by the number of viruses they share. In the same way social networks can highlight the disproportionate importance of specific individuals, such as 'super-spreaders', in population-level disease dynamics, our networks can highlight the importance of certain species in host-virus communities and disease emergence. In addition, we can use other network methods to look at substructures, or 'communities' in the network, highlighting sets of highly interconnected species (Newman 2004) .",

Degree in bats ranged from 0 to 53 with a mean of 15.0 and in rodents ranged from 0 to 78 with a mean of 12.5 (Table 1 ; See Fig. S3 for degree distributions). The mean degree and mean weighted degree were significantly higher in bats than in rodents. There was significant transitivity (the probability that the adjacent nodes of a node are also connected) in both bats and rodents. Assortativity in bats was significant, suggesting that bat species with high degree tend to interact with other bat species of high degree (and low degree with low degree), but there is no evidence of this in rodents (Table 1) .",

These characteristics have been hypothesised as important mechanisms for viral maintenance and spread (Calisher et al. 2006; Luis et al. 2013 )bat species with distributions that overlap with a greater number of other bat species, and particularly those which are gregarious, will have greater interspecific contacts and chance for cross-species transmission. At some roosting sites, bat densities can be as high as 3000 bats per square metre, and some roosts house diverse assemblages of species (Constantine 1967; Kunz 1982) . High densities can lead to high contact rates, facilitating pathogen transmission and persistence. These dense roosting sites are often caves, therefore we had hypothesised that propensity to roost in caves would be an important predictor of viral sharing in bats. However, colony size (gregariousness) was more important than where the colony roosts. Large colony sizes do not occur on the same scale in rodents and may have led to the higher mean degree and connectance in bats compared to rodents. Species with high betweenness might not have or share the most viruses, but could play a key role in disseminating viruses because they can connect disparate regions of the network. Migration was the most important host trait associated with betweenness in bats. Long-distance animal movement has been hypothesised to enhance geographic spread of infectious disease, however, evidence in most cases is lacking (Altizer et al. 2011 ). In the bat network, many of the shortest network paths went through regional migrants (moving 100-500 km annually), which were more important than long-distance migrants (> 500 km). This is consistent with the idea of 'migratory culling' (Bradley & Altizer 2005) in which the physiological stress of long-distance migration can increase mortality of infected individuals.",

This is the first analysis we are aware of that attempts to identify communities of pathogen sharing at a global scale. These communities reveal which species are most highly connected, providing insight into virus maintenance and spread. They may also be useful in guiding public health strategies.

The importance of sympatry is reflected in similarities between viral and host species richness maps (Fig. 1 ). Locations where host species diversity is highest generally have more viruses. However, bats in Europe and India have greater viral richness than predicted by the host species richness map (Fig. 1a,c) , and this does not appear to be due to sampling bias (Fig. S7) . The community context may provide additional insight. There are two host-virus communities connecting Europe to East Asia where species richness is high (Fig. 3c,f) , and these communities may provide a bridge. Higher viral richness than expected from host species richness in India may also reflect connections with areas of high species richness in S.E. Asia (Fig. 3c) . For the viral richness maps, we assumed that the virus exists throughout the distribution of its host(s) analogous to the fundamental niche concept (Hutchinson 1957; Harris & Dunn 2010) and representing the broadest possible distribution. However, there may be barriers that restrict the realised niche of a virus. For example Rhinolophus ferrumequinum hosts SARS-like coronavirus and Japanese encephalitis virus, and its range extends from E. Asia to W. Europe, but the populations in E. Asia and Europe do not appear to mix (Flanders et al. 2009 ).",

As interest in reservoirs of emerging infectious diseases increases, especially in bats, we predict that results such as these will further strengthen our findings and allow for more refined analyses at the community level.

We found that although both the bat and rodent networks were smaller (the bat network was reduced to 120 species and 744 links; and the rodent network to 145 species and 738 links), the connectance remained relatively steady (5.2% in bats and 3.5% in rodents), suggesting that the apparent greater viral sharing in bats compared to rodents is not merely a function of recent attention on bats.

Although our database only has 9% of extant rodent species and 13% of extant bat species, the rodents in our database have been more studied overall and more studied for viruses than bats even when removing the most highly studied, lab rodents -Mus musculus and Rattus norvegicus (significant by t-test on log number of citations for the species name, means = 4.90 & 4.44, P = 0.002; and the species name + virus, means = 1.99 & 1.43, P < 0.001). We would expect more of the total viral community to have been identified in the more highly studied group of species (rodents), thus the sampling bias should increase the apparent connectance in rodents compared to bats. However, this does not account for species not in our database. If the rodent species that have not been sampled share more viruses than the bat species that have not been sampled, then these results may not hold. Similarly, the species trait data was only available for roughly 37% of the bat and rodent species in our networks, which corresponds to 5 and 3% of known extant bat and rodent species respectively; therefore, the species traits associated with important hosts may also change as our knowledge increases. New viruses are being discovered frequently, suggesting that there are many more viruses yet undetected in both bats and rodents. Therefore, our conclusions and the maps of viral diversity for both orders (Fig. 1 ) may change significantly as our knowledge increases.
