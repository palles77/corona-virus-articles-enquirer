Besides GPI-linked alkaline phosphatase in Aedes aegypti mosquito-larval midguts, membrane-bound aminopeptidase N (AaeAPN) is widely thought to serve as a Cry4Ba receptor. Here, two full-length AaeAPN isoforms, AaeAPN2778 and AaeAPN2783, predicted to be GPI-linked were cloned and successfully expressed in Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) cells as 112-and 107-kDa membrane-bound proteins, respectively. In the cytotoxicity assay, Sf9 cells expressing each of the two AaeAPN isoforms showed increased sensitivity to the Cry4Ba mosquito-active toxin. Double immunolocalization revealed specific binding of Cry4Ba to each individual AaeAPN expressed on the cell membrane surface. Sequence analysis and homology-based modeling placed these two AaeAPNs to the M1 aminopeptidase family as they showed similar four-domain structures, with the most conserved domain II being the catalytic component. Additionally, the most variable domain IV containing negatively charged surface patches observed only in dipteran APNs could be involved in insect specificity. Overall results demonstrated that these two membrane-bound APN isoforms were responsible for mediating Cry4Ba toxicity against AaeAPN-expressed Sf9 cells, suggesting their important role as functional receptors for the toxin counterpart in A. aegypti mosquito larvae.",

Of particular interest, the Cry4Ba toxin from Bt subsp. israelensis is specifically active against mosquito larvae of the genus Aedes and Anopheles, vectors of various human diseases including dengue fever, chikungunya, yellow fevers and malaria [2, 3] . After ingestion by susceptible insect larvae, these Cry toxins which are produced as insoluble protoxins are solubilized in the larval midgut lumen (generally alkaline pH for dipteran and lepidopteran larvae) prior to their activation by gut proteases to yield 65-kDa active toxins [2, 4] . According to all the known Cry structures, the activated toxins consist of three distinct functional domains: an a-helical bundle (DI), a b-sheet prism (DII) and a b-sheet sandwich (DIII). DI and DII have been revealed as membrane-pore formation and receptor recognition, respectively [5] . Recently, we have demonstrated that charge-reversal mutations at Asp 454 (D454R and D454K) located within a receptor-binding loop of Cry4Ba-DII markedly increases the toxin activity against lesssusceptible Culex larvae, suggesting a role of the charged sidechain in determining target specificity [6] .",

The recombinant AaeAPN expression vectors were subsequently transfected into the insect Sf9 (Spodoptera frugiperda 9) cells using Cellfectin, following manufacturer's protocol (Invitrogen).",

Protein inclusions were collected by centrifugation at 6000\u00c2 g, washed and subsequently re-suspended in distilled water.

The 65-kDa activated toxin was further purified by sizeexclusion chromatography (Superose 12 10/300, GE Healthcare) and eluted with the carbonate buffer (pH 9.0) at a flow rate of 0.4 mL/min. The purified Cry4Ba protein fraction was then concentrated with a 10-kDa-MWCO Millipore membrane (Merck KGaA) and analyzed by SDS-PAGE.",

Also, another dipteran APN from Anopheles mosquitolarvae (AgAPN2) expressed in E. coli was shown not to have glycosylation for Cry11Ba binding [17] unlike some identified lepidopteran APNs that need the sugar moiety for binding to their toxin counterparts [7, 28] .",

To quantitate this observation, cell viability assay was performed. The result showed an increase in percent mortality of Sf9 cells expressing AaeAPN2778 (35.0 \u00b1 4.5%) and AaeAPN2783 (27.0 \u00b1 2.2%) when compared to the control Sf9 cells expressing CAT (10.0 \u00b1 0.8% cell mortality) (Fig. 2B ). Cell mortality mediated by these two AaeAPNs was similar to AaeALP (31.7 \u00b1 2.8% cell mortality) which has been previously identified as a Cry4Ba receptor [12] , suggesting that both AaeAPN2778 and AaeAPN2783, like AaeALP, share a common role as a toxin receptor mediating the Cry4Ba cytotoxicity. Moreover, this result was in agreement with our previous study that AaeAPN2778-or AaeAPN2783-knockdown larvae became less susceptible to the Cry4Ba toxin [14] , strongly suggesting that these two APN isoforms serve as functional receptors for the Cry4Ba toxin in A. aegypti mosquito-larvae.",

Both the Cry4Ba toxin and AaeAPNs were detected on the cell membrane surface with extensive colocalization ( Fig. 3I and L) , indicating that Cry4Ba was able to bind only to Sf9 cells-expressing membrane-bound AaeAPNs or AaeALP. These results also suggested that both AaeAPN isoforms were expressed in Sf9 cells as membrane-bound proteins. Taken altogether with the cytotoxicity results suggest that specific binding of Cry4Ba to its single counterpart (AaeAPN2778 or AaeAPN2783) is sufficient for mediating the toxin activity against individual receptor-expressing Sf9 cells without the need of pre-interaction with another receptor. Nevertheless, it has been shown both in vivo and in vitro for lepidopteran-specific Cry1A toxins that pre-binding of the toxin to cadherin-like receptors is required for toxin oligomerization prior to interacting with second membrane-bound receptors (e.g. APNs or ALPs) for insertion and pore formation [7, 30] .

Human endoplasmic reticulum aminopeptidase 1 (PDB 2YD0) [20] was therefore selected as a template for homology modeling as it showed the highest similarity with 50% and 46% to AaeAPN2778 and AaeAPN2783, respectively. To validate the models, the stereochemical quality of AaeAPN2778 and AaeAPN2783 showed the overall QMEAN score of 0.609 and 0.591, respectively, suggesting good quality models as estimated model reliability is between 0 and 1, with higher values for more reliable structures [23] . In addition, Ramachandran plot analysis revealed that 97.3% and 97.6% of AaeAPN2778 and AaeAPN2783 amino acid residues, respectively, are present in the most favored and additional allowed positions [24] , suggesting that both 3D-modeled structures are mostly in the sterically favorable main-chain conformations.",

This suggests that AaeAPNs displayed high structural conservation among the M1 aminopeptidase family. It should be noted that in the most variable domain IV there is no predicted N-/ O-glycosylation site in the Thr-rich C-terminal stalk regions (see Supplementary Fig. 1 ) which are believed to be a part of Cry1Abinding regions for the lepidopteran APNs [7] , suggesting different toxin-binding sites between lepidopteran-and mosquito-APNs. Interestingly, when compared the variable domain IV of these two AaeAPNs among insect APNs that have been reported as Cry toxin receptors including Lymantria dispar APN [31] , M. sexta APN [32] , H. virescens APN [26] and An. gambiae APN [17] , the conserved negatively charged residues were found only on the two AaeAPNs: Glu 734 , Asp 735 , Asp 775 and Glu 802 for AaeAPN2778; and Glu 724 , Asp 725 , Asp 765 and Glu 790 for AaeAPN2783 (see Fig. 4B , as indicated by *). These conserved-negatively charged patches placed them on the surface-exposed loops of both AaeAPN structures (Fig. 4C) , possibly being involved in binding to the Cry4Ba toxin via ionic interactions and hence determining target specificity against Aedes larvae. Further studies, to better understand more critical insights into Cry4Ba toxin-receptor interactions, charged reversed mutagenesis on these putative interaction sites would be of great interest. Likewise, point mutations to positively charged sidechains on receptor-binding loop regions of the Cry4Ba toxin itself might perhaps improve the toxin activity and specificity against Aedes larvae, consistent with previous findings that Cry4Bacharged-reversal mutants (D454R and D454K) exhibit increased binding affinity and larval toxicity to Culex larvae [6] .",
