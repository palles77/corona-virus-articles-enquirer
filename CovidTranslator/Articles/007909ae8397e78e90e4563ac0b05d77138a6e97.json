One approach involves the effective utilization of tricyclo[3,3,0,02'8]octanone derivative as a building block. This methodology enabled the efficient synthesis of loganin, chrysomelidial, forthyside aglycone and other cyclopentanoid natural products. The same methodology was independently developed by Demuth et al. (4) and widely utilized for the synthesis of iridoids and polyquinanes. Similar methodology utilizing [3, 3 ,0]-octane derivatives has been known and successfully applied for the synthesis of iridoids (5) . The second approach is the effective utilization of (+)-genipin as a chiral building block whose functionality is quite fit for the synthesis of polyfuntional iridoids and related natural products. Furthermore, (+)-genipin is easily obtained by the enzymatic hydrolysis of geniposide with Cellulosin AC-40 and it can be supplied from industry in Kg scale. The altemative non-enzymatic efficient method which we developed is the hydrolysis of geniposide using hydroxymercuration followed by treatment with SnCl2 or sodium 3mercaptopropionate. The second methodology enabled the efficient synthesis of loganin, penstemide, didrovaltrate, plumericin, allamandicin, plumieride, gardenoside, garjasmin, asperuloside, cerbinal, baldrinal, secologanin, sweroside, gentiopicroside, kingiside, morronoside, sarracenin, petiodial and udoteatrial in optically active form.

We have embarked upon the synthesis of polyfunctional iridoids via the same intermediate which may be easily obtained from an ordinary starting material. We selected tricyclo[3,3,0,02 '8] octanone as the varsatile intermediate. Tricyclo-[3,3,0,02 '8] octanone, obtained from photolysis of bicyclo [2, 2, 2] octenone or decomposition of 2-cyclopenten-l-yldiazomethylketone with cupric sulfate, was transformed with formic acid or ptoluenesulfonic acid into functionalized bicyclo [3, 3, 0] octanone, which has a distinguishable functional group in the each five membered ring and can be led into cyclopentanoid natural products via the selective conversion of the functional group. We have applied this versatile intermediate, tricyclo [3,3, 0,0^ '8] octanone towards the synthesis of polyfunctional iridoids, chrysomelidial, loganin and forsythide. 79% yield.

The two isomers were easily separated by column chromatography. This desired ketal was oxidized with chromium trioxide-pyridine complex in methylene chloride to give the corresponding ketone 4 which, upon alkylation with methyl lithium in ether at -78 \u00b0C followed by treatment with p-toluenesulfonic acid in aqueous THF, afforded the ketoalcohol 5 in 81% yield. Refluxing of 5 with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazine in methanol for 30 min produced the corresponding hydrazone in 93% yield. Treatment of this resulting hydrazone with excess n-butyl lithium in THF, followed by oxidation with osmium tetroxide in ether, and acetylation gave in 75% yield the stereoisomeric mixture of diacetates and triacetate in a ratio of 83:14:3. Diacetates were treated with phosphoryl chloride in pyridine at 50 \u00b0C for 3 h to form in 97% yield a mixture of the desired tetra-substituted olefin and tri-substituted olefin in a ratio of ca. 15:85 by ^H-NMR. Reduction of the tetrasubstituted olefin mixture with lithium aluminium hydride in ether followed by oxidation with sodium periodate in ether-water (1:1) at 4 \u00b0C for 24 h afforded chrysomelidial in excellent yields. The same oxidation of the trisubstituted olefin produced the hydrate 6, which was transformed into chrysomelidial by refluxing in 50% aqueos acetic acid in 99% yield. The diacetate was also converted to chrysomelidial by the same procedure.",

Dihydroxylation of genipin disilylether (27) with osmium tetroxide followed by the selective elimination of the secondary alcohol via triflate gave disilylether of gardenoside aglycone (28) in good yield. Upon treatment of 28 with PPTS in aqueous acetone, the silyl group attached to the primary alcohol was first hydrolyzed to give gardenoside aglycone silyl ether. The prolonged reaction time, however, caused transposition of the tertiary hydroxy group to yield the desired C6 hydroxylated compounds as a mixture of stereoisomers 29 in about 3.6 to 1 ratio. This observed hydroxy transposition was significant in that the transposition of hydroxyl group in the proposed biosynthetic pathway (22) of gardenoside from geniposide proceeded in the opposite direction. The major isomer (p-hydroxy) was converted into asperuloside aglycone silylether as shown in Scheme 7. Treatment of the alcohol 30, obtained by silylation of the primary alcohol in 29, with potassium hydride in THF cleanly afforded the hydroxy acid, which was then lactonized with DCC to give the desired lactone 31. Finally hydrolysis of the silyl group to the primary alcohol followed by acetylation of the resulting alcohol completed the synthesis of asperuloside aglycone silylether. Garjasmin was synthesized from 28 by treatment with a large excess amount of TBAF (5 equiv.) followed by acidification with p-toluenesulfonic acid (p-TsOH) in 53% yield.",

In our synthesis of plumericin and allamandicin, plumierde which was thought to be a biogenetic precursor (29) was selected as the key intermediate. We first attempted the coupling of genipin with methyl acetoacetate. Selective protection of the hydroxyl group of genipin hemiacetal followed by acetylation produced allyl acetate 32. Palladium % allyl complex mediated coupling reaction (30) of ally lace tate with sodium salt of methylacetoacetate produced the coupling product 33 in quantitative yield. Protection of the ketone as an acetal followed by reaction with osmium tetroxide yielded the dihydroxy compound 34. Both lactonization and dehydration proceeded in high yield by the treatment of 34 with sodium methoxide followed by treatment with trifluoromethanesulfonic anhydride, 4-dimethylaminopyridine and DBU.",

Desilylation of 36 with tetrabutylammonium flouoride (TBAF) in the presence of 2 equiv. of acetic acid followed by Michael addition of the alcohol produced the tetracyclic ether 37 in quantitative yield. The final step is the stereoselective reduction of the keto group to give allamandicin. After many fruitless attempts, it was found that this reaction was best performed by the reduction with triethylsilane in CF3CO2H at 0 \u00b0C to accomplish the synthesis of (+)-allamandicin. In this case (+)-^/?/-allamandicin (38) and (+)-iso-allamandicin (39) were aslo obtained. Any reductions in basic conditions gave fruidess results. When this reduction was carried out at room temperature, a mixture of (+)-plumericin and (+)-iso-plumericin (40) (75:25) were obtained in 50% yield.

In order to control Cg stereochemistry, we tried an alternative route. NATURAL PRODUCTS RELATED TO IRIDOIDS Udoteal, a marine linear diterpene, is considered to be a key intermediate for the biosynthesis of petiodial, udoteatrial, halimedatrial, halimedalactone and halitunal having an iridoid framework. On the other hand, seco-manoalide, a sesterterpene having a y-hydroxy butenolide ring, is considered to be formed from a linear sesterterpene whose functionality is very similar to udoteal. It may be possible to think that synthetic seco-manoalide analogue, which is a remarkable phospholipase A2 inhibitor, will be isolated in the future. (-)-Petiodial was isolated from the marine algae, Udotea petiolata, collected in Naples (58) and from Udotea Flabellum (59) in Cambean independently. This monocyclic diterpenoid dialdehyde shows significant biological activities against several marine bacteria, inhibits of cell division in fertilized sea urchin eggs, and is toxic to herbivorous damselfish causing death within one hour. Besides petiodial, the diterpenoids udoteatrial (60) and halimedatrial (61) have been reported possessing similar structures. The absolute configuration of these compounds has not been determined, and in the case of petiodial the relative stereochemistry has also not been reported yet. In the biosynthesis of these diterpenoids, the corresponding linear diterpene udoteal, isolated from the algae, was suggested to be the biogenetic precursors (61) . In this section the first efficient synthesis (62) of optically active petiodial and determination of its absolute structure (65, 7R) has been described. Next the absolute stereochemistry of another asymmetric center at C7 of 78 was determined as follows. Reduction of the mixture of (+)-petiodial (78) and its diastereoisomer 79 obtained above with LiAlH(t-BuO)3 (64) afforded the corresponding diols which were isolated respectively in a ratio of 3:2. The major alcohol 80 was reconverted into (+)-petiodial This syntheses also confirmed that the biogenetic precursor of petiodial is not an iridoid, but it could be a linear diterpene udoteal. The synthetic method employed here could be expanded to get various analogues involving different side chain. These compounds might show much better biological activities than those of petiodial. From this successful synthesis we can expand our research fields into more complicated diterpenes involving a cyclopentene ring system.",

The problem upon introduction of the geranyl side chain was the stereocontrol of the newly formed stereogenic center at C7. Since it seemed, however, that the side chain in 85 occupied the thermodynamically stable a-configuration, it was considered that base catalyzed isomerization could control the stereochemistry at C7 after introduction of the side chain into 86. To support this assumption, semiempirical calculations (PM3) (69) of simplified analogues derived from 86 did show that the a-isomer were more stable than the p-isomer. On the other hand, assay of in vitro cytotoxicity of these analogues afforded significant results. Thus, the compounds possessing the homogeranyl side chain (97, 98 and 99) were found to be cytotoxic against KB human oral epidermoid carcinoma and human lung carcinoma A-549 as summarized in the Table (72) . Compound 97 was the most toxic among the analogues examined at concentration of 4x10\"^ |ig/ml.

This observation suggested that the generation of oxonium species by elimination of the acetoxy group might be relevant for the exhibition of cytotoxicity of these compounds.

The dimer might be formed by 1,4-addition of the a-anion of 55 to the starting exomethylene ketone. Presumably tributylstannyl lithium acted as base. When triphenylstannyl lithium was allowed to react with the exomethylene ketone 55, however, the normal 1,4-adduct 56 was obtained in 70% yield. After reduction of 56, treatment of the resulting alcohol with lead tetraacetate did not afford any secologanin aglycone-O-methyl ether. Presumably, electron withdrawing phenyl groups decrease the electron density on the tin atom causing destabilization of the P-carbonium ion or radical intermediate. Hypercovalent bond formation of tin with y-hydroxy group may also retard the fragmentation reaction.Thus, it was necessary to find an effective reagent which gives the 1,4-adduct of tributyltin to the cisoid enone such as 55. Attempts to use ate complexes, (PhSCuSnBu3)\"Li\"^ and n-Bu3SnCu\u00bbMe2S-LiBr (49) also gave the desired ketone in low yield. The dimeric product was formed as a by-product. Fortunately, it was found that (trimethylsilyl)tributylstannane was an excellent reagent for 1,4-addition of tributyltin group to cisoid enone(50). Thus, the exomethylene ketone 55 reacted cleanly with the above reagent in the presence of both a catalytic amount of KCN and 18-crown-6 to afford the desired silyl enol ether which was subjected to selective removal of trimethylsilyl group with n-Bu4NF in the presence of acetic acid. The keto stannane 56 was obtained in high yield from 55. Finally, the synthesis of secologanin aglycone-o-silyl ether (58) was achieved by reduction of 56 followed by oxidative fragmentation with lead tetraacetate. It should be noted that in contrast to Grob type fragmentation (44) this oxidative fragmentation proceeded from both cis and trans isomers in respect of the hydroxyl and tributylstannylmethyl groups of 57.Sweroside aglycone-0-silyl ether(59) was obtained by the reduction of secologanin aglycone silylether (58) with sodium borohydride quantitatively.",

Silylation of genipin gave disilyl ether 27 which was subjected to reduction with DIBAL to give the alcohol 72 in 92% yield from genipin. Alkylation of the mesylate prepared in situ from 72 was successful at low temperature as follows. Alcohol 72 was treated with n-BuLi in THF at -78 \u00b0C followed by addition of mesyl chloride, and the lithium anion of geranyl tolyl sulfone(63) was reacted with the mesylate 73 prepared as above to give desired alkylated compound 74 in 80% yield. Attempts to detect the intermediary mesylate by thin layer chromatography was unsuccessful because of its instability at room temperature, as encountered in the corresponding chloride, and trichloroacetate. This result suggests that these type of iridoids having a good leaving group at Cn decompose readily at room temperature. Selective desilylation of 74 with PPTS in ethanol gave the monosilyl ether (75), which was subjected to reduction to afford the alcohol 76 in 64% yield.Acetylation of 76 followed by rapid treatment with n-Bu4NF afforded the hemiacetal 77 in 93% yield. This compound was a positional isomer of the double bond in petiodial. Isomerization of the double bond in the five membered ring of 77 proved to be unexpectedly difficult and highly critical conditions were required for this isomerization. Refluxing an anhydrous benzene solution (0.05 M in substrate) of the hemiacetal 77 containing 0.5 equivalent of diazabicycloundecene (DBU) afforded the dial 78 and its stereoisomer 79 in 80% yield. More vigorous conditions or use of THF as solvent gave the desired compounds in lower yield. Treatment with other bases such as sodium hydride or sodium hydroxide under various reaction conditions gave only trace amounts of the desired compounds. From the mixture obtained above, each stereoisomer, 78 and 79 was isolated by thin layer chromatography respectively with a ratio of 3:2. ^H-and l^C-NMR spectra of the major component 78 were identical with those of the natural petiodial.

Thus the methylene protons in the lactone ring of 82were observed at 6 4.35 and 4.24 ppm as a part of an ABX pattern (JAB=11.5 HZ, JAX=3.0 HZ, JBX=2.0 HZ), while those of 83 were at 5 4.39 and 3.94 ppm, (JAB=11.0 HZ, JAX=4.0 HZ, JBX=11.0 HZ). The above features of the iH-NMR spectra of both lactones 82 and 83 were in good agreement with those of the corresponding methylene protons of neonepetalactone (5 4.34 and 4.19, dd, JAB=1 1-0 Hz, JAX=3.0 HZ, JBX=3.0 HZ) and iso-neonepetalactone (5 4.24 and 3.89, dd, JAB=11-0 HZ, JAX=5.0 HZ, JBX=11-0 HZ), whose stereochemistry has been established. We could therefore assign the relative stereochemistry between C^ and C7 in (+)-petiodial 78 as (6R, 7S). The absolute structure of natural (-)-petiodial was then determined as {6S, 7R ).",

Reduction of 88 followed by acetylation gave the acetate 89 in good yield.Bromohydrin formation with NBS-H2O followed by Swern oxidation afforded the corresponding bromoacetate 90, which was successively treated with zinc in acetic acid(70) to give the key intermediate 86. With 86 in hand, the stereochemistry at C7 was then considered carefully, and the stereochemistry at C7 was confirmed by single crystal X-ray analysis of model compounds.Thus, treatment of the lithium salt of geranyl sulfone with 86 afforded the 1,4-addition product 91. Since the removal of the sulfone group from 91 was unsuccessful, the lactone carbonyl in 91 was temporarily reduced and protected with TBDMS to give the acetal 92.Birch reduction (71) of the sulfone moiety in 92 afforded the compound 93, which was deprotected and oxidized with PCC to afford homogeranyl lactone (94 and 95) as a mixture of diastereoisomers, of which the ratio was found to be 3:1 by iR-NMR spectroscopy. This mixture was separated by HPLC and the major isomer 94 could be isomerized into a 1:1 mixture of 94 and 95 under the influence of DBU in refluxing toluene. Reduction of the ahomogeranyl lactone 94 with DIBAL followed by acid hydrolysis of the resulting hemiacetal accomplished the synthesis of 85. In order to determine the absolute configuration of natural udoteatrial hydrate, 85 was converted to the diacetate 97 and 98, the spectral data of which were in good agreement with those reported previously. The signs of optical rotations of our synthetic diacetates, however, were opposite to those of natural diacetates which confirms the absolute configuration of natural udoteatrial hydrate as {2R, 3S, 6S, 7S) as shown in Scheme 15.

Next, preliminary investigations of the structure and activity relationships of the synthetic analogues of e\u00abr-udoteatrial hydrate was examined. The homogeranyl lactone 95 was reduced with DIBAL followed by acid hydrolysis of the resulting hemiacetal to afford the ent-1-epiudoteatrial hydrate (96). Acetylation of 96 was found to give the acetate 99 as the sole product. To examine the effect of the side chain on the biological activities, we chose the compound bearing the methyl group as a simple side chain to compare with those involving the homogeranyl group. Thus, hydrogenation of 86 with Rh/Al203 stereoselectively afforded the p-methyl derivative 100 (Scheme 16). The a-methyl isomer 101 could be obtained by base catalyzed isomerization of 100. Compounds 100 and 101 were converted into the diacetates 102, 103 and 104, respectively, by the same reaction sequence as that described for the preparation of 97, 98 and 99 from 94 and 95.

The biological properties of these analogues (97, 98, 99,102, 103 and 104) were then examined. Although the natural udoteatrial hydrate was reported to show antimicrobial activities against Staphylococcus aureus and Candida albicans, none of these analogues was active against various microogranisms. At this moment it was not clear whether protection of the two hemiacetal portions of 85 as acetate would decrease the activities of the natural product.",
