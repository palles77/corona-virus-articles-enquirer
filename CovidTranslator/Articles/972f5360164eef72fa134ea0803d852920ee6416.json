In support to the antibody-based therapeutics, the advent of recent technologies has made human antibody screening and production progressively more economic. Among those technologies, phage-display antibody library has been successfully applied in the antibody-based drug development both as fully human antibody sources and tools for antibody engineering. Building up a high-quality antibody library with a large library size and high diversity has been crucial for successful isolation of antibodies. Here we describe an efficient strategy for the construction of a large na\u00efve phage-display human Fab library with one-step cloning. Optimization of each key step is extensively discussed and simplified protocols for library panning and Fab production are also described.",

The first phage-displayderived antibody drug (Humira \u00ae ) against human TNF-alpha is now in clinical use for treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, Cohen's disease, and ankylosing spondylitis (1) (2) (3) . Hundreds of other phage-display-derived human antibodies are in preclinical development and dozens in clinical trials. Design and construction of large high-quality phage-displayed antibody libraries, as the one described below, will continue to be of central importance for the successful selection of good high-affinity antibodies. Although the generation of such libraries is a long and labor-intensive process it is still cost-effective in comparison to other methodologies for identification of antigen-specific human monoclonal antibodies like, for example, the generation of transgenic mice with human immunoglobulin genes.",

Numerous examples have already shown that high-affinity human antibodies against a panel of antigens ranging from viruses to human self-antigens can be isolated from the phage-display antibody library described below which is based on an IgMderived antibody gene repertoire (9) (10) (11) (12) .

To cover each subfamily of the human antibody genes, carefully selected primers matching the conserved N-terminal and C-terminal region of heavy-chain and light-chain were used for the amplification of each family separately. To avoid the loss of diversity of the gene repertoire, enough of the DNA template input should be used at each overlapping PCR; also limited cycles of amplification should be avoided to prevent from introducing bias in the final library. The efficacy of DNA transformation into bacteria has always been the limiting step for constructing large libraries, electroporation has been frequently used to make large bacterial libraries due to its high efficacy; still the DNA preparation for electroporation should be always optimized to reach high transformation efficiency.",

And also longer cycles than 15 after the adding of primers could create a lot of unspecific amplification; optimization of the PCR conditions such as DNA input amount and number of cycles at each stage is strongly suggested at this step. 6 Plasmid or gel-purified DNA with high quality is very important for complete digestion with SfiI. Preparation of the vector using plasmid containing full-length Fab insert is essential to monitor the complete digestion on agarose gel and purify the complete cut vector from the uncut. Longer flanking sequences beside the SfiI site on the insert are necessary for efficient digestion and better differentiation of the digested product from the uncut fragment on the agarose gel. 7 Avoiding the regular phenol-chloroform extraction and ethanol-salt precipitation at this step can dramatically improve the electroporation efficacy.",
