For the largest brands, this outlook allows companies to configure operations to take account of: \u25a0 Seasonality, weather patterns, and optimum conditions for cruising \u25a0 Sales and marketing \u25a0 Supply and servicing of ships This chapter considers the influence and effect of geography on the cruise industry. To start with, it is impossible to consider cruising without reflecting on the conditions that arise from the prevailing climate. Passenger comfort and safety are directly affected if a cruise ship sails in a particular part of an ocean or sea at a particular time of the year. This also holds true for destinations visited and shore activities that may be offered.",

            "text": "To avoid potential discomfort for customers, cruise ships tend to steer clear of parts of the world where difficult sea conditions occur because of geography, climate, and seasonal variations (Burton, 1995) . Many stories are told of severe weather conditions in specific locations. For example, the Bay of Biscay, the Cape of Good Hope, the Bay of Bengal, and the North Atlantic have reputations suggesting they can provide extremes of weather for seafarers or navigators. Yet knowledge of weather patterns and records of tidal variations permit cruise operators to predict where ships can travel with a high degree of safety to enable virtually all the world's oceans and seas to be traversed and all coastal ports to be visited (see Figure 4 .1).",

They are influenced by many factors, including the sun's rays, the world's rotational axis (which tilts 23.5\u00b0from the perpendicular, thus creating seasonal variations), the land masses and oceans, currents, and the moon's gravitational pull (which creates tidal variations). southern and eastern Caribbean islands have fared less well than western Caribbean islands, because itineraries have switched from 2-week tours to shorter 4-or 7-day excursions (Burton, 1995) . Competition for the tourist dollar has led to a situation where port fees for many Caribbean islands are relatively inexpensive, at between US$4 to US$6 per customer. In this way, a vessel such as the Diamond Princess, with 2,500 customers, would pay approximately US$12,500 in port fees. In addition, cruise companies own some islands: Royal Caribbean has ownership of Coco Cay, Holland America owns Half Moon Cay, Disney Cruises owns Castaway Cay, Norwegian Cruise Lines owns Great Stirrup Cay, and Princess Cruises has an island called Princess Cay. The benefits of such ownership include generating revenue from shore-based activities and controlling costs associated with ports of call (a Cay, or Key as it is known in the United States, is a low island or reef of sand or coral).",

As a sea-based trading center, Venice has a maritime culture and has always made a living from the sea. Its excellent terminal facilities provide a point of arrival and departure and easy access to this attractive destination (Medcruise, 2005) . Recently, proposals have been made to construct a tidal barrier to counter flooding problems caused by a combination of the city sinking into the lagoon (2 cm in 100 years) and rising tides (BBC News, 2003) .",

In some cases these ports are home ports for US vessels and cruise companies. In addition, cruise itineraries can be constructed from US and Canadian ports to meet passengers' needs for cultural and geographical attractions. Irrespective of a cruise ship's flag or country of registration, because of the actions of US port health officials there are critical implications from the standpoint of port health for ships visiting US ports (which are examined in depth elsewhere) (Figure 4 .4). North America is the world's largest cruise market. As a result of concerns about security abroad, the number of cruise passengers joining from US ports has seen considerable growth. Of the top five cruise destinations in the world (Wild and Dearing, 2004a) , Miami and Port Everglades are as number 1 and 2, respectively, and Port Canaveral is number 4. All three ports are in Florida. Cruise companies have benefited by consolidating their operational support in the United States and creating economies of scale from supply networks for merged brands. In addition, cruise companies have become horizontally and vertically integrated in their operations. Within the cruise industry, horizontal integration is attained by using different brands strategically within a variety of market segments. Vertical integration is achieved by creating synergies and generating revenue from ownership of parallel operations such as shore excursions, travel agents, terminal operations, and so on. The following list provides a brief outline of the features of major North American ports.",

He also recognized the difficulties that cruise executives face when planning itineraries and can orient his strategy accordingly. The \u00a3230,000 three-year project was launched in February 2002. Destination Southwest started by establishing an informative website, www.destinationsouthwest.co.uk. The website allowed visitors to click on the port name and get access to a lot of information, including a cruise calendar to identify which ships are calling and when, marine charts, town maps, suggested shore excursions, video clips of some attractions, 360-degree shots of the port area where passengers land, and distances and times between ports and attractions. This information, which helps the itinerary planner make decisions, was also replicated on a DVD to provide an easy-to-use reference in support of direct selling and to give away at exhibitions. Websites and DVDs were produced in German and English to appropriately target the US and German cruise markets.",

The results of the project show an increase from 10 vessels calling into ports in the area in 2001, to 106 cruise ship calls in 2004. By all accounts, this is a dramatic increase. Some ports in this region offer berths where the ship can go alongside. Indeed, the busiest port, Falmouth, has such facilities. Harrison believes that passengers prefer as few tender operations as possible (where launches transport passengers from ship to shore). This despite the fact that many cruise brands include a tender operation as part of the total cruise experience. In his opinion, more than two tender operations in a cruise is too many, because passengers begin to object to the time delay, the potential discomfort if sea conditions are not calm, and queues that can form at either end of the operation because of security and logistical factors. The business generated by Destination Southwest includes 21 turnarounds. A turnaround port is one where the cruise starts and finishes. Dartmouth is reported to operate one turnaround while Falmouth has 20. The Falmouth turnarounds involve a ship called the Van Gogh, which has itineraries to the Mediterranean, the Canary Islands, and the Caribbean.",

He quotes this Irish research because he believes that cruises based in Cork and those in the Destination Southwest program have much in common. This research identified that each passenger spends \u00a3197 and that crew members spend marginally less. There is, however, disagreement about spending levels, and some sources suggest that at times the crew can actually spend more than some passengers. This is explained by patterns in port manning. Minimum levels of crew must remain on board when the ship is in port to ensure safety. As a result, crew members cannot go ashore in every port but when they do go ashore they are more likely to spend greater amounts of money. Harrison estimates that cruise passenger spending in the southwest of England is \u00a316.7 million, while crew spending is \u00a31.7 million. That is a total of \u00a318.4 million from a project with a \u00a3285,000 budget, which could equate to 438 jobs for the local community. When a cruise ship comes to Falmouth, the local department store, Marks and Spencer, takes on extra staff. The project has attracted high-profile vessels to the ports in the partnership and it is reasonable to highlight the benefit to the port's image. When the 'World ' was visiting Falmouth as part of her itinerary, there were 2,000 people standing on the headland to see the ship as she sailed out of the harbor.",

The Passenger Shipping Association states that there was a 37 percent increase in visits to the UK between 2003 and 2004 and identifies it as the fastest growing market in the world. The potential for the southwest of England is high. Even the weather, often regarded by some as a turn-off, is seen by many US passengers as an attractive experience. The local government office is impressed with the project and aims to extend it for a further two years. Levels of investment are low, however, and there is a constant struggle to persuade members to contribute. There are major benefits to acting in concert.

Cruise lines such as Disney, Princess Cruises, Norwegian Cruise Line, Holland America Line, Costa Cruise Lines, Royal Caribbean International (which has two islands), and Radisson Seven Seas Cruises are all involved in this type of investment. But what are the advantages and are there any disadvantages in having a private beach port? Most of the islands are constrained by their location and facilities, thus requiring that the ship anchor off the coast, with passengers then ferried to the island jetty by tender.
