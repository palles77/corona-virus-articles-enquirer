Only sporadic data are available on the circulation of RVAs in equine populations in Europe. In this study, 65 diarrheic samples from foals under 4 months of age were collected in Belgium (n = 32), Germany (n = 17), Slovenia (n = 5), Sweden (n = 4), Hungary (n = 3), Italy (n = 2), France (n = 1) and The Netherlands (n = 1). Forty percent of these samples (n = 26) were found to be RVA positive by a quantitative RT-PCR assay. The viral load in 11 of these samples was sufficiently high to be (partially) genotyped. G3, G14 and P[12] were the main genotypes detected, and phylogenetic analyses revealed that they were closely related to contemporary equine RVA strains detected in Europe as well as in Brazil and South Africa. Regional variation was observed with only G14 and P[12] being detected in Germany, whereas mainly G3P[12] was encountered in Belgium. Surprisingly the only G14P[12] RVA strain detected in Belgium was also found to possess the very rare P[18] genotype, which has been described only once from equine RVA strain L338 detected in the UK in 1991. Despite the identification of this uncommon P[18] genotype, G3P[12] and G14P[12] RVA strains remained the most important genotypes in Europe during the study period. Based on this finding and the knowledge that G3P[12] and G14P[12] serotypes are partially cross-reactive it can be assumed that a vaccine based on an inactivated virus of the G3P[12] genotype is still relevant in the current European epidemiological situation, although the addition of a G14 strain would most likely be beneficial. \u00df",

Besides good farm management, vaccination is currently the most widely used method to reduce the risk of disease caused by RVA in horse farms (Sellon and Long, 2014) . Currently 3 inactivated vaccines are licensed globally and administered to pregnant mares. Vaccines based on the inactivated H-2 strain (G3AP [12] ) are licensed in the US, New Zealand, Australia and several European countries (Zoetis Inc.). The vaccine licensed in Japan uses the HO-5 strain (G3BP[12]) (Nisseiken Co., Ltd).

Furthermore, for 1 sample from Germany, only the P-genotype could be determined [EQ26], for 1 sample from Slovenia only the G-genotype could be determined [EQ46] , and from 1 sample from Belgium [EQ44] a mixed P-genotype was found (Table 2 and supplementary data 1).

Fig. 1 shows the genotype distribution of all (n = 26) investigated samples (referred to as ''Europe''), and the genotype distribution for Belgium and Germany in particular. The data for Europe suggest that both the G3P[12] and the G14P[12] genotypes are more or less equally present in the samples analyzed. However, both genotype combinations do not seem to be equally distributed geographically, as only the G14 genotype was identified in German samples, whereas mainly G3 was identified in Belgian samples. Furthermore, a single G3P[12] strain was detected in an Italian sample, and a G14P[x] strain in a Slovenian sample. Fig. 2 shows the phylogenetic analyses of the obtained VP7 and VP4 sequences together with representative strains from GenBank. The 6 G14 RVA strains isolated from Belgian, German and Slovenian samples are very closely related to each other (showing nucleotide identities ranging from 98.9-100%), and to contemporary equine G14 strains detected in Italy, Brazil, South Africa and Ireland.

            "text": "Vaccination of infants or pregnant mothers has been shown one of the most effective measurements to prevent RVA gastroenteritis in humans as well as in a variety of animal species (Dhama et al., 2009) . For the prevention of gastroenteritis caused by RVA in horses, the approach of using inactivated RVA vaccines to administer to pregnant mares has been selected. A number of studies have been conducted assessing the vaccine efficacy of equine RVA vaccines. It was shown in several field studies that following vaccination of mares, antibodies can be detected in blood, colostrum and their foals without adverse effects (Barrandeguy et al., 1998; Imagawa et al., 2005; Powell et al., 1997) . Follow-up of clinical parameters associated with RVA infections in these studies demonstrated variable vaccine efficacy, which suggests that vaccination provides reasonable but not complete protection. However, the interpretation of field data is in general difficult. As the overall amount of RVA is reduced in the stable or herd when horses are vaccinated, this reduced infection pressure benefits also unvaccinated horses in the study which makes the assessment of vaccine efficacy difficult. Although little is known about cross protection between G3 and G14 serotypes, a recent study in Japan suggests that a vaccine based on a G3BP[12] RVA strain also generated cross protective virus-neutralizing antibodies against G14P[12] RVA strains, albeit at a slightly lower level (Nemoto et al., 2012) . This confirms previous studies, which demonstrated that G3 and G14 serotypes partly cross-react with each other (Imagawa et al., 2005; Imagawa et al., 2002) . This cross-reaction in combination with the fact that G3 and G14 are also genetically related G types suggests that a vaccine based on one of these serotypes should offer a certain degree of (cross-)protection against both serotypes. A previous study demonstrated that diarrhea caused by a serotype G14 rotavirus infection was comparatively milder in the group of horses vaccinated with an inactivated G3 serotype RVA vaccine as compared to the non-vaccinated group (Imagawa et al., 2005) . This raises questions about the benefit of using a G3/ G14 multivalent vaccine as suggested by some researchers (Bailey et al., 2013) . Nonetheless, there are a few observational studies, which have suggested that vaccination may have caused a shift in the genotype distribution of circulating equine RVA strains in Ireland (Collins et al., 2008) and Argentina (Garaicoechea et al., 2011) . Our investigation was an additional attempt to increase the knowledge on the epidemiological situation of equine RVAs in Europe and predict the usefulness of currently available commercial vaccines.",

            "text": "Our genotyping results indicate that the G3P[12] and G14P[12] genotype combinations are the most prevalent, which confirms global data on equine RVAs (Papp et al., 2013) . Our data also suggest that regional differences in the genotype distribution exist, as can be seen in the data from Belgium and Germany, where G3 and G14, respectively, were most prevalent, although this was based on rather small numbers. In this context, an interesting observation was the finding of the P[18] genotype in the Belgian RVA strain EQ44, in a mixed infection with G14 and P[12] . L338 is thus far the only P[18] RVA strain detected worldwide, isolated from a foal with diarrhea in the UK in 1991 (Browning et al., 1991a) . Complete genome analyses of this strain revealed that the 11 gene segments were unique, each belonging to their own genotype (Matthijnssens et al., 2012) . The single isolation of this particular RVA strain has always raised questions, whether or not L338 was a genuine equine RVA, or may have been the result of an interspecies transmission from a yet unidentified host species. The detection of a novel P[18] RVA strain in this study, 22 years after the detection of L338, lends support to the former hypothesis of a genuine equine RVA strain. This hypothesis is further supported by the fact that the obtained P[18] sequence showed 4.0% differences on the nucleotide level compared to L338, suggesting an accumulation of mutations has occurred over 2 decades. However, it cannot be excluded that this evolution has occurred in a different host species, and that this virus was transmitted to horses on two different occasions. L338 was detected in combination with G13, whereas we could not detect G13 in the sample. This might be explained by (a) the P[18] from EQ44 was combined with G14, (b) P[18] was combined with a genotype that was not detected by our VP7 primers or (c) G13 has accumulated mutations in the G13 primer binding sites, and was therefore not detected. Intensified RVA surveillance programs in horses are needed to address these questions.",
