For viable skin grafts, sterilisation techniques cannot be applied, however antibiotics and antimycotics may be used to disinfect the tissue with respect to bacteria and fungi. Nevertheless, strict standards are applied to avoid disease transmission from donor to recipient involving donor medical history, donor testing for viral diseases, aseptic retrieval and processing, and control of storage temperature. Cryopreservation is the preferred method for long term storage of viable skin grafts. If viability is not required, then additional long term preservation methods may be used including deep-freezing, freeze-drying or high concentration solute preservation. All three methods work by reducing water activity. In addition it is possible to apply certain sterilisation techiques that have been shown not to damage the tissue. It is important that sterilisation methods are validated in accordance with precise definitions of sterilisation, and for the initial levels of bbioburdenQ expected to be present immediately prior to application of the sterilisation method. The application of improved and refined methodologies in accordance with defined standards has ensured improved graft performance while reducing risk to the recipient. D 2005 Elsevier Inc.

Nevertheless, viable skin can still be retrieved up to circa 24 hours after death. If the body is not quickly refrigerated, however, the skin will be subjected to a much longer warm ischemia period resulting in an accelerated deterioration in viability.

In addition, transient populations of contaminating bacteria, however, may also be naturally present, or may result from contamination during the skin retrieval process. Even the commensal bacteria may damage the skin if subsequently allowed to grow during the skin storage period to reach massive population densities. Therefore, it is important to try to eliminate or minimize the microbial population of skin before retrieval. This is generally achieved using skin prepping techniques similar to those used on the skin of patients undergoing operations in hospital. When banking skin in a viable state, it is important to validate that the prepping agents have been adequately removed before harvesting the skin, and that any residuals are not toxic to the skin cells.",

Eventually, refrigerator storage for skin autografts became the norm in burn units. The simplest technique was to fold the skin so that the cut surfaces were in apposition and then wrap the skin sandwich in tulle gras and/or saline gauze to prevent desiccation. 12, 13 Using this method, autologous skin can be used after around 2 weeks of storage, although cell viability is very low at this point. Unlike autograft, allograft has already lost some viability by the time it is retrieved; therefore, maximum storage times using this method are reduced to 7 or 8 days. 14 Because extensive microbiology screening, however, is required, together with scrutiny of the medical records, postmortem report, and so on, this short storage period is insufficient.",

The general properties of cryoprotectants are that the molecules can pass through the cell membrane into the cell and be relatively nontoxic at very high multimolar concentrations. The commonest cryoprotective agents (CPAs) are glycerol and dimethyl sulfoxide. 24 Cryoprotective agents are able to prevent solution effect injury. Their mode of action is probably 2-fold. First, they act as solvents for the salt, thus reducing the salt concentration that the cells are subjected to at the high subzero temperatures (where solution effects are most damaging). In addition, their presence within the cells prevents excessive shrinkage of the cells during this cooling phase. 25 Therefore, in the presence of CPAs, it is possible to use very slow cooling rates that minimize intracellular ice formation while protecting the cells against solution effects. High viabilities of all cell types can thus be achieved using this slow cooling rate. For many tissues, the optimum cooling rate is around \u00c018C per minute when CPAs are used.",

The vapor phase is currently preferred owing to cases of virus transmission between packs of bone marrow that were stored in the liquid phase, presumably because of gross contamination of the giving set ports on the marrow bags by viruses present in the liquid nitrogen. The nitrogen had become contaminated by the rupture of a bag containing marrow from a patient subsequently shown to be positive for hepatitis B. 36 Once the skin is at a temperature lower than \u00c01308C, no further loss of cell viability is incurred. When the skin is required for grafting purposes, it should be transported to the user hospital either in a liquid nitrogen dry shipper (at temperatures below \u00c01308C) or together with dry ice (CO 2 ) in an insulated container (\u00c0798C). The optimum thawing procedure is a rapid warming method. This can be achieved by plunging the packs of skin into a 378C water bath until the tissue is just thawed (prolonged storage at 378C in the presence of the CPA would be detrimental). The outer bag can then be disinfected and cut along the margin, and the inner bag removed aseptically to a sterile field. After aseptic opening of the inner bag, the skin is removed to a sterile kidney dish and rinsed to remove the CPA solution. Because the cells contain high concentrations of CPA, they are hyperosmotic compared with normal saline. To avoid osmotic lysis of the cells, either the saline can be added gradually or an impermeant solute such as sucrose can be added to the saline to reduce the difference in osmolarity. 37 As soon as the washing procedure is completed, the skin should be applied immediately to the wound. Viability declines rapidly after thawing of the skin 38 and further storage before use cannot be recommended.",

            "text": "1. Deep freezing. At the freezing point of the tissue, ice nucleation occurs. As the temperature falls further, ice crystals form and existing crystals grow. Ice crystals are pure water and hence the remaining solution becomes progressively concentrated. Eventually, the point is reached at which there is too little free water left in solution to facilitate the microbial growth and the degradative chemical reactions. At this temperature, long-term preservation is achieved. In practice, storage in a \u00c0808C deep freeze has proved satisfactory for long-term storage. 2. Freeze drying. This process involves the removal of water from skin in the frozen state by sublimation, which is achieved by applying a vacuum to the tissue and condensing the removed water molecules downstream. 25 Sublimation from the frozen state helps to protect molecules that would otherwise be adversely affected by high salt concentrations at higher temperatures, for example, denaturation of proteins. Drying must continue until enough water has been removed to prevent degradation reactions, which equates to less than 5% residual water as measured gravimetrically. Although accepted in most tissue banking standards, bresidual waterQ is not identical to bwater activity,Q which is the most appropriate measure. 41 The US Navy Tissue Bank was the first to commence large-scale freeze drying of human tissues for implantation in the early 1950s. In 1955, the use of freeze-dried skin was first reported. It was subsequently shown that freeze drying reduced the immunogenicity of skin 42 without interfering with its beneficial properties. 31, 32, 43, 44 3. Use of high-concentration solutes. High concentrations of salts or sugars have been used for centuries for the long-term preservation of food items. The principle here is that each solute molecule is able to sequester water molecules in a hydration shell around the molecule. The water within the hydration shell is almost crystalline in nature and is unable to participate in other chemical reactions. The Euroskin Bank developed a solute preservation method using glycerol. 45 The skin was incubated in successively more concentrated glycerol solutions (50%, 70%, and 85%) and maintained long term in 85% glycerol. More recently, the glycerol and water flux kinetics have been characterized and a more efficient validated protocol was proposed. 46 The water activity of skin in different glycerol concentrations has been measured using a commercially available instrument. 41 This study demonstrated that the 85% concentration originally chosen by the Euroskin Bank is optimal for minimizing degradative reactions.",

This is the sterilization dose required to reduce the microbial density by 1 log 10 (90%) (Fig. 4) . Where the line crosses the x-axis indicates there is an average of less than 1 viable organism per item being sterilized. Again, this is a statistical phenomenon so that when 10 \u00c01 is reached, this indicates 1 viable microbe for every 10 items being treated. The Food and Drug Administration has recently indicated that to claim sterility of a banked tissue product, enough sterilization dose should be applied to reach the 10 \u00c06 level, that is, 1 viable microbe per 1 million tissue items sterilized. Because it is not possible to destructively culture 1 million tissue grafts, the value is obtained by extrapolation of the line in Fig. 5 to the 10 \u00c06 level using the D value concept. This is referred to as the 10 \u00c06 sterility assurance level (SAL). To reach the 10 \u00c06 SAL level from the x-axis clearly requires 6 D values. Additional D values, however, are required to move from the original bioburden to the x-axis. If the initial bioburden is low, for example, only 10 microbes per graft, then log 10 of 10 = 1, that is, 1 additional D value is required, giving a total of 7 to reach a SAL of 10 \u00c06 . If, on the other hand, there are 1 million microbes per graft, then log 10 of 10 6 = 6, that is, 6 additional D values are required, giving a total of 12.",

Irradiation doses above circa 25 kGy cause collagen denaturation.

[57] [58] [59] Conclusions Skin allografts continue to be an important therapeutic tool. The development of surgical skin banking in individual burn units has largely given way to large regional or national skin or multitissue banks. This has facilitated rigorous tissue processing and scientific validation of processing procedures used. Increasing regulation and accreditation of skin banks by governmental and intergovernmental agencies have further strengthened skin processing and banking standards, thus ensuring high levels of safety and efficacy.",
