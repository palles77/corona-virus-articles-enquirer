The most recent common ancestor of PToV was estimated to have emerged 62 years ago based upon HE gene sequence data obtained from PToV isolates originating from Spain, South Korea, Netherlands, Hungary, and Italy and using the HE gene of Bovine torovirus isolates Niigata1 (AB661456) and Nii-gata3 (AB661458) as outgroups. The HE gene sequence data segregated all the PToV isolates into two well-supported monophyletic groups; however, various isolates from Spain, Italy, and South Korea did not segregate geographically suggesting very recent translocation of the viruses to these localities. Evidence of recombination was observed between two South Korean isolates that partitioned into two distinct subclades. Data further suggest that most of the nucleotides in the HE gene are under negative selection; however, changes within codon 237 showed an evidence of positive selection.",

The latter virus is considered the prototypical torovirus that was isolated from a horse with diarrhea in Berne, Switzerland, in 1972 [3] . A morphologically related virus was later found on a cattle farm in Breda, Iowa, in the 1980s [4] . Over the years, there have been several reports describing the presence of torovirus-like particles in the feces of humans and swine [5, 6] ; however, the first formal identification and characterization of a torovirus from swine did not materialize until 1998 [7] .",

In addition, the morphology of toroviruses is unique in that they appear as spherical, elongated, or kidney-shaped particles with tubular nucleocapsids surrounded by a membrane carrying large spikes [8, 9] . Research on toroviruses has been limited because they are very difficult to propagate in cell culture. The one exception has been the equine isolate from Berne, Switzerland (BEV; 3). Also, in 2004, a new BToV isolate obtained from the intestinal contents of a calf with diarrhea was successfully propagated in cell culture using the human HRT-18 cell line [10] .",

The best tree was computed using TreeAnnotator (BEAST V1.6.2) with the first 10 % removed as burn-in. Trees were visualized and edited with FigTree (BEAST V 1.6.2).",

The ICV rHE serves as a receptor-binding and receptor-destroying protein, and it has been argued that the HEs of toroviruses and coronaviruses have a similar function [40] . Although, toroviruses and coronaviruses are related, they apparently acquired their HE genes through independent heterologous RNA recombination events [41] .

In addition, we performed phylogenetic analysis and molecular dating with the putative recombinant isolate 07-56-14 removed from the analysis (Fig. 1b) . Results showed only minor changes in molecular dating (\u00b12 %) at all the nodes. With respect to the phylogenetic inference, the profiles comparing Fig. 1a (recombinant region removed) and Fig. 1b (recombinant 07-56-14 removed) were identical except for the clustering of 14-7 with 52-11 and 12-11 in clade 1, and minor variations in the clustering of the 07-109 series of isolates. Changes in the clustering of 14-7, 52-11, and 12-11 along with the recombinant 07-56-14 also occurred when the entire sequences were analyzed. As such we concluded that the recombination did not demonstrably affect the phylogenetic architecture or molecular dating of our isolates, but the recombination event caused ambiguity in the placement of 07-56-14.

Upon closer scrutiny of the chimeric sequences within the 17-56-14 PToV HE gene, we concluded that these sequences were more consistent with the genomic reorganization of torovirus field variants than with the artifacts derived from PCR amplification [20, 42] .

RDP is best suited for scanning sequences in pairs to detect the recombination among a group of aligned DNA sequences [43] . Phylogenetic signaling was not used because of problems identifying the recombinants [26, 44] . Also, most of the programs used scan for putative recombination breakpoints predicated upon the sequence information available which is not possible with phylogenetic signaling [27, 45] . As with most programs of this nature, the quality of the sequence alignment is critical for accurately predicting breakpoints. In general, these programs traverse the query sequence and compare it to a panel of reference sequences. Simplot has the added ability to ignore the gaps in the alignment when generating the plot and to identify the exact similarity value at any point in the sequence. Simplot is not routinely applied to large-scale recombination studies; however, it can accurately identify the position of reorganization, and therefore, breakpoints.",

ML is a character-based algorithm that generates trees with specified branch lengths that have the highest conditional probability of recreating the initial dataset. MCC is predicated upon Bayesian phylogenetic inference wherein it tallies the number of times each clade appears in sampled posterior trees to arrive at a tree with MCC [24] . The MCC tree is not a consensus tree but one of the trees actually present in the sample produced by BEAST with the highest product of all the posterior probabilities for all the clades in the tree. MCC identifies a single ''point estimate'' tree that is central to the distribution of all the trees. The MCMC method infers ancestral states while accommodating uncertainty about the phylogenetic tree and model parameters [46] , allows for easy interpretation of results, and incorporates prior information while providing computational advantages [46] . Topological differences can and do occur between the methodologies predominantly when the sequences are less similar [47] as exemplified when comparing Figs. 1a and 3a, both of which were generated with the recombined sequences removed. As noted, several nodes in Fig. 3a (ML tree) are neither wellsupported nor are the relative branch lengths when compared to Fig. 1a (MCC tree) . This was not unexpected given the recombinant nature of this sequence. Lack of congruence between trees depicting virus phylogenies can be particularly problematic given the rapid rate of mutation among virions.",

With the data available, it is difficult to explain why strain 07-56-14 and its major parent 07-56-23 formed a monophyletic clade with isolates derived from Spain, Italy, the Netherlands, and Hungary, including others from South Korea; however, the absence of geographical influence was observed in all the generated trees. Given the paucity of information related to the transmission dynamics of toroviruses, it is possible that anthropogenic factors and/ or swine husbandry practices in this region of the world caused the recent dissemination of isolates via the translocation of the host species and/or by-products. Although, swine domestication is believed to have originated 5000-7000 BC in the Middle East, Eastern Mediterranean, or in Southeast Asia, it was not until the last 400-500 years that the host movement due to human intervention took foothold. Even more recently, the raising of pigs in confinement has provided both positive and negative impact on the transmission of swine diseases. Whereas heavy confinement has rendered academic, swine sylvatic pathogens such as parasites, viral pathogens can quickly spread among animals reared under strict confinement and among localities as the animals are transported between production and/ or finishing facilities. As such, viral population structure and transmission patterns can be heavily impacted by the patterns of host translocation. The identification of well-defined clades containing geographically distinct isolates coincides temporally with increased transportation and confinement rearing of pigs and with the increase in exportation and importation of meat products worldwide.",

Prior studies have noted that the recombination in viruses has a predilection for singlestranded regions of the RNA [48] , which tend to be less stable than those rich in GC bases. Further, the entire sequence is approximately 64 % in AU residues and within the recombined region, the %AU increases to nearly 69 % which would tend to further destabilize the structure and enhance replicase switching during RNA strand replication [49, 50] . It should be noted that PToV is a positive-strand virus and evidence has been advanced demonstrating that homologous recombination may be more frequent in positive-stranded viruses than in negative-stranded viruses [51] . Roossinck [52] suggested that some plant and animal viruses might have common origins and that plant viruses frequently use recombination and re-assortment as driving forces in evolution. In the present study, we inferred that the recombination and re-assortment do indeed play roles in PToV HE gene evolution.",
