This gives a detailed structure of the role of the NHS in any type of major incident from man-made disaster to pandemic flu. This has required preparation of communication, transport, security, military and healthcare systems. Also included is how the response to the incident is handled at a local level and for different levels of response. Examples of how this has played out are described. Specialist training at the higher and advanced level for trainees is established so that victims are triaged at the scene and received by consultants with appropriate training. Hospitals, ambulance services and intensive care units across the country can use networks to ensure not only rapid access to Major Trauma Centres but also to highly sophisticated skills when advanced life support is required. The NHS response to major incidents has been shown to be effective and successful.",

In response to the Westminster incident, the HART (hazardous area response team) was called. During the de-briefing several lessons have been reinforced. After the major incidents in London, victims were rapidly triaged to five or six hospitals with consideration to capacity across the city. A senior clinician said after the London Bridge attack, 'having staged a mock event in the trust during the previous year when the casualties started to arrive all the training kick-in and the staff did a fantastic job'. In Manchester an estimated 400 extra staff came in to cope with the casualties. Many came in before a major incident was announced because people heard it on the media. A similar response was seen in London when staff from the nearby hospital ran to the scene. It was also noted how the pressure on staff continued weeks and months after the events as many victims remained in hospital. These plans are all contained in the EPRR framework and supporting documents 1e4 updated in August 2017. The Civil Contingencies Act (CCA) 2004 5 makes clear the responsibilities of NHS hospitals. The structure of the response by the local services, NHS England, Public Health England and the Department of Health is shown in Figure 1 . All category 1 responders (includes acute trusts) have an EPRR framework. Major incident planning is part of mandatory training for consultants.",

Immediate care, especially regarding the airway, is sometimes required, but staying and providing treatment on scene is not the primary goal e the emphasis is on reducing the 'incident to MTC' times. Average transfer times have therefore reduced considerably. In London, the incident to MTC is now 17 minutes. This is well shown in head injuries where incident to CT scan is <60 minutes in 90% of patients. 8 If triage to MTC outside of London is thought possible in <45 minutes then patients bypass nontrauma hospitals.",
