The value of the network is in its breadth and the ability of users to assemble large communities with members from distant locales that would otherwise not be able to interact. In that sense, social media serves us like an international, allaccess water cooler. Certainly, most readers are likely familiar with social media websites such as Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. These websites allow posts within designated parameters that can be hosted and shared by user accounts. LinkedIn, Tumblr, and Snapchat (currently only a smartphone app) are additional platforms, and each outlet varies in its content, focus, ability to add images or links, and character limits.",

These communities include the targeted Clinical Microbiology Network (clinmicronet), which allows users (primarily doctoral-level scientists who are clinical microbiologists) to pose questions to the group at large, and respondents can self-select based on their expertise, time, and willingness. The American Society for Microbiology hosts clinmicronet and divC, a similar site for both doctoral-and non-doctoral-level clinical microbiologists). Reddit communities, known as subreddits, include r/microbiology and r/medlabprofessionals, among other science-oriented subreddits, and are used to pose questions, notifications, and observations related to their titles. However, these forums differ from above-mentioned platforms in that users do not maintain an active individual feed, access is exclusive rather than open, or both.

Followers comment or ask questions about the scientific content of posts, and these questions are often answered by other fans. A popular Facebook post in 2016, titled \"Assessing Gram Stain Error Rates,\" promoted a blog about a Journal of Clinical Microbiology article [7] reporting a higher-than-expected error rate among clinical microbiology laboratories. The post was widely shared and commented on by microbiologists of all training levels. The topic popularity was in part due to the ubiquity of the technique among all levels of microbiologists, as students, technicians/technologists, and researchers are familiar with the protocol. This accessibility is important to engage a wide audience; introductory microbiology students are unlikely to be ASM members, but their experience with the Gram stain during laboratory courses allows them to feel part of the community.",

Users can access their accounts to view images on a computer, but posting photos is restricted to use of the Instagram app on one's smartphone.

During a conference, a hashtag established by conference organizers can help attendees (or those online) to follow the important points being made throughout the conference. Tweets can be collected based on their hashtags and saved using Storify, as was done for the 2017 ASM Biothreats meeting [11] . Conference hashtags can be especially useful for attendees who have conflicting conference sessions and cannot attend all the session they wish to. Additionally, viewing the tweets helps attendees find each other, which can happen through recognition of profile photos or through more formal \"tweet-ups,\" where twitter community members meet at a given time and place, sometimes meeting for the first time in person after interacting for years online. #Hashtags may also act as a quick cultural flash response. This was the case after Tim Hunt proclaimed that the trouble with women in the laboratory is the romantic relationships that inevitably follow; this popularized the hashtag #distractinglysexy as women responded by posting photos of themselves in laboratory gear. The #distractinglysexy hashtag seems to have been born from a single tweet calling for women to post photos of themselves at work [12] . More recently, in a move to allow members of the public who do not personally know anyone working in the sciences to visualize scientists, Auburn University ecologist David Steen called for scientists to introduce themselves and explain their science in a single tweet, with a response from Mary Roblyer to include the hash tag #actuallivingscientist [13] .
