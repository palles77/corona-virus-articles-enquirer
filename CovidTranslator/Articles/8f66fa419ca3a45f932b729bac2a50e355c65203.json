In addition to a well-recognized cleavage site at the S1-S2 boundary, a second proteolytic cleavage site has been identified in the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) S2 domain (R797). C-terminal to this S2 cleavage site is a conserved region flanked by cysteine residues C822 and C833. Here, we investigated the importance of this well conserved region for SARS-CoV S-mediated fusion activation. We show that the residues between C822-C833 are well conserved across all coronaviruses. Mutagenic analysis of SARS-CoV S, combined with cell-cell fusion and pseudotyped virion infectivity assays, showed a critical role for the core-conserved residues C822, D830, L831, and C833. Based on available predictive models, we propose that the conserved domain flanked by cysteines 822 and 833 forms a loop structure that interacts with components of the SARS-CoV S trimer to control the activation of membrane fusion.",

The S2 domain contains two heptad repeat regions, HR1 and HR2, as well as a fusion peptide. Following conformational changes based on receptor binding or change in pH, the S2 domain drives fusion of the viral and host cell membranes to allow virus entry. Observations of cell surface expressed SARS-CoV spike protein, indicated that most of the protein was not cleaved at the S1-S2 boundary and with at best limited cleavage possible Xiao et al., 2003) . It is generally considered that S1-S2 cleavage is not directly linked to fusion peptide exposure in the case of SARS-CoV, or any other coronavirus (Bosch and Rottier, 2008) . However, it has recently been shown that SARS-CoV S can be proteolytically cleaved at a downstream position in S2, at residue 797 , and a highly conserved region C-terminal to the cleavage site has been characterized and identified as critical for fusion (Madu et al., 2009) .",

The rationale for these mutations was as follows: residues G824, D825, N827, and A828 were simply mutated to alanine (or serine in the case of A828) to modify their chemical nature in an innocuous manner; the conserved residues C822 and C833 were mutated to serine to change the chemical nature of the cysteines and prevent normal disulphide bond formation; the C822S/C833S double mutant was designed to curb the possibility of spurious disulfide bonding occurring with unpaired cysteines; D830L and L831D mutants were generated to modify the chemistry of each original residue with the corresponding conserved residue, as both are 100% conserved; and to further address how residues within the proposed loop might be important, we generated a loop deletion mutant \u0394823-832 and a flexible tripeptide GAG loop (Kwong et al., 1998) between the flanking cysteines.",

Given its proximity to a cleavage site and the proposed fusion peptide, we set out to characterize this domain. Sequence alignment of this domain showed a strong conservation particularly in the C-terminus of the region. We set out to carry out a series of mutagenic studies in a comprehensive manner. Our investigation entailed the replacing of core-conserved residues with residues to modify the chemistry of the wild type residues, and substituting or deleting the residues between the Virions were bound to Vero cells at 4\u00b0C in RPMI media and treated with 25 mM ammonium chloride.

One possible way the domain flanked by cysteine residues C822 and C833 may do so is by forming a disulfide bond-anchored loop that interacts with an as yet undisclosed part of the fusion protein to promote membrane fusion. In the absence of a crystal structure of the SARS-CoV S ectodomain, a predictive model of the quaternary structure is available: PDB code 1T7G (Bernini et al., 2004; Spiga et al., 2003) (Fig. 7A ). In the context of this model, the cysteineflanked region is represented as a loop region with the cysteines 822 and 833 positioned directly next to each other, which we predict to form a disulphide bond (Fig. 7B) . The environment is one that might hint at further interactions with other parts of the spike protein. Of particular interest is the finding that residues C822, L823, G824, D825, I826, N827 and A828 within the loop are part of a major antigenic determinant of SARS-CoV S (residues L803-A828) capable of inducing neutralizing antibodies (Zhang et al., 2004) . In conclusion, we present data of a critical domain of SARS-CoV S2 that is required for the successful function of S-mediated fusion. We propose this region functions by interactions with other domain(s) in S to activate membrane fusion. It is important to point out that in the absence of a \"true\" crystal structure, we cannot rule out the fact that this region may function through many other possible roles within SARS-CoV S to aid in membrane fusion.",
