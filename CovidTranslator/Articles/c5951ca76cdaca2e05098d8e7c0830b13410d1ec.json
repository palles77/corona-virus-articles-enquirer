Therefore, computational tools for reliably predicting linear B-cell epitopes are highly desirable. We evaluated Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers trained utilizing five different kernel methods using fivefold cross-validation on a homology-reduced data set of 701 linear B-cell epitopes, extracted from Bcipep database, and 701 non-epitopes, randomly extracted from SwissProt sequences. Based on the results of our computational experiments, we propose BCPred, a novel method for predicting linear B-cell epitopes using the subsequence kernel. We show that the predictive performance of BCPred (AUC \u00bc 0.758) outperforms 11 SVM-based classifiers developed and evaluated in our experiments as well as our implementation of AAP (AUC \u00bc 0.7), a recently proposed method for predicting linear B-cell epitopes using amino acid pair antigenicity. Furthermore, we compared BCPred with AAP and ABCPred, a method that uses recurrent neural networks, using two data sets of unique B-cell epitopes that had been previously used to evaluate ABCPred. Analysis of the data sets used and the results of this comparison show that conclusions about the relative performance of different B-cell epitope prediction methods drawn on the basis of experiments using data sets of unique B-cell epitopes are likely to yield overly optimistic estimates of performance of evaluated methods. This argues for the use of carefully homology-reduced data sets in comparing B-cell epitope prediction methods to avoid misleading conclusions about how different methods compare to each other. Our homology-reduced data set and implementations of BCPred as well as the APP method are publicly available through our web-based server, BCPREDS, at:",

            "text": "B-cell epitopes are antigenic determinants that are recognized and bound by receptors (membrane-bound antibodies) on the surface of B lymphocytes (Pier et al., 2004) . There are many different types of B-cell receptors, but each B-cell produces only one type. When a B-cell receptor binds its cognate antigen, the B-cell is stimulated to undergo proliferation. This involves the generation of two types of cells, effector or plasma B-cells, which produce and secrete soluble antibodies, and memory B-cells, which remain in the organism and can proliferate rapidly if re-exposed to antigen. Hence, understanding the sequence and structural features of B-cell epitopes is critical both for the design of effective vaccines and for the development of sensitive diagnostic tests.",

            "text": "B-cell epitopes can be classified into two types: linear (continuous) epitopes and conformational (discontinuous) epitopes. Linear epitopes are short peptides, corresponding to a contiguous amino acid sequence fragment of a protein (Barlow et al., 1986; Langeveld et al., 2001) . In contrast, conformational epitopes are composed of amino acids that are not contiguous in primary sequence, but are brought into close proximity within the folded protein structure. Although it is believed that a large majority of B-cell epitopes are discontinuous (Walter, 1986) , experimental epitope identification has focused primarily on linear B-cell epitopes (Flower, 2007) . Even in the case of linear B-cell epitopes, however, antibody-antigen interactions are often conformationdependent. The conformation-dependent aspect of antibody binding complicates the problem of B-cell epitope prediction, making it less tractable than T-cell epitope prediction. Therefore, the development of reliable computational methods for predicting linear B-cell epitopes is an important challenge in bioinformatics and computational biology (Greenbaum et al., 2007) .",

ABCPred (Saha and Raghava, 2006b ) uses artificial neural networks for predicting linear B-cell epitopes. Both feed-forward and recurrent neural networks were evaluated on a non-redundant data set of 700 B-cell epitopes and 700 non-epitope peptides, using fivefold cross-validation tests. Input sequence windows ranging from 10 to 20 amino acids, were tested and the best performance, 66% accuracy, was obtained using a recurrent neural network trained on peptides 16 amino acids in length.

Although the performance of SVM-based classifiers largely depends on the selection of the kernel function, there are no theoretical foundations for choosing good kernel functions in a data-dependent way. Therefore, one objective of this study was to explore a class of kernel methods, namely string kernels, in addition to the widely used radial bias function (RBF) kernel. Our choice of string kernels was motivated by their successful application in a number of bioinformatics classification tasks, including protein remote homology detection (Leslie et al., 2002 (Leslie et al., , 2004 Zaki et al., 2005) , protein structure prediction (Rangwala et al., 2006) , protein binding site prediction (Wu et al., 2006) , and major histocompatibility complex (MHC) binding peptide prediction (Salomon and Flower, 2006) . In addition, we introduce the subsequence kernel (SSK), which has been successfully used in text classification (Lodhi et al., 2002) , but has been under-explored in macromolecular sequence classification applications. Our empirical results demonstrate superior performance of SSK over other string kernels and the RBF kernel. Hence, we employed the SSK in building SVM classifiers for our proposed linear B-cell epitope prediction method, BCPred.",

At present, little is known about the relative performance of different methods, due to the lack of published direct comparisons using standard benchmark data sets. Unfortunately, neither the data set used by S\u00f6 llner and Mayer (2006) nor the code used for generating and selecting the features used to represent epitope peptides as input to the classifiers is publicly available. The code for the AAP method is also not publicly available; however, in contrast to the other methods, it is relatively straightforward for implementation. Fortunately, although the code used to train the neural network classifier used in ABCPred is not publicly available, Saha and Raghava (2006b) have made available the data set used for developing and evaluating the ABCPred server, as well as a blind test set (Saha and Raghava, 2006a) . Thus, although we are unable to include direct comparisons with results of S\u00f6 llner and Mayer (S\u00f6 llner and Mayer, 2006) , in this paper we report direct comparisons of the ABCPred method (Saha and Raghava, 2006b) , our implementation of the AAP method of Chen et al.

Given a set of labeled training data (x i ,y i ), where x i 2 R d and y i 2 f\u00fe1; \u00c01g, training an SVM classifier involves finding a hyperplane that maximizes the geometric margin between positive and negative training data samples. The hyperplane is described as f \u00f0x\u00de \u00bc w; x h i\u00fe b, where w is a normal vector and b is a bias term. A test instance, x, is assigned a positive label if f (x) > 0, and a negative label otherwise. When the training data are not linearly separable, a kernel function is used to map nonlinearly separable data from the input space into a feature space. Given any two data samples x i and x j in an input space X 2 R d , the kernel function K returns K\u00f0x i ; x j \u00de \u00bc F\u00f0x i \u00de; F\u00f0x j \u00de where F is a nonlinear map from the input space X to the corresponding feature space. The kernel function K has the property that K(x i ,x j ) can be computed without explicitly mapping x i and x j into the feature space, but instead, using their dot product x i ; x j in the input space. Therefore, the kernel trick allows us to train a linear classifier, e.g., SVM, in a high-dimensional feature space where the data are assumed to be linearly separable without explicitly mapping each training example from the input space into the feature space. This approach relies implicitly on the selection of a feature space in which the training data are likely to be linearly separable (or nearly so) and explicitly on the selection of the kernel function to achieve such separability. Unfortunately, there is no single kernel that is guaranteed to perform well on every data set. Consequently, the SVM approach requires some care in selecting a suitable kernel and tuning the kernel parameters (if any).",

Although these metrics are widely used to assess the performance of machine learning methods, they all suffer from the important limitation of being threshold-dependent. Threshold-dependent metrics describe the classifier performance at a specific threshold value. It is often possible to increase the number of true positives (equivalently, sensitivity) of the classifier at the expense of an increase in false positives (equivalently, false alarm rate). The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve describes the performance of the classifier over all possible thresholds. The ROC curve is obtained by plotting the true positive rate as a function of the false positive rate or, equivalently, sensitivity versus (1-specificity) as the discrimination threshold of the binary classifier is varied. Each point on the ROC curve describes the classifier at a certain threshold value, i.e., at a particular choice of tradeoff between true positive rate and false positive rate. The area under ROC curve (AUC) is a useful summary statistic for comparing two ROC curves. AUC is defined as the probability that a randomly chosen positive example will be ranked higher than a randomly chosen negative example. An ideal classifier will have an AUC \u00bc 1, while a classifier assigning labels at random will have an AUC \u00bc 0.5, any classifier performing better than random will have an AUC value that lies between these two extremes.",

Figure 1 shows the ROC curves for all methods evaluated in this experiment. The ROC curve for the subsequence kernel, K sub \u00f04;0:5\u00de , dominates the other ROC curves over a broad range of choices for the tradeoff between true positive and false positive rates. For any user-selected threshold corresponding to specificity in the range 100 to 20%, K sub \u00f04;0:5\u00de has the best corresponding sensitivity. We conclude that BCPred, SVM-based classifier trained using the subsequence kernel K sub \u00f04;0:5\u00de , outperforms all other methods tested in predicting linear B-cell epitopes.",

Dem\u0161ar (Dem\u0161ar, 2006) has suggested that non-parametric tests should be preferred over parametric tests for comparing machine learning algorithms because the non-parametric tests, unlike parametric tests, do not assume normal distribution of the samples (e.g., the data sets). Dem\u0161ar suggested a three-step procedure for performing multiple hypothesis comparisons using non-parametric tests. First, the classifiers being compared are ranked on the basis of their observed performance on each data set (see Table 2 ). Second, Friedman test is applied to determine whether the measured average ranks are significantly different from the mean rank under the null hypothesis. Third, if the null hypothesis can be rejected at 0.05 significance level, the Nemenyi test is used to determine whether significant differences exist between any given pair of classifiers. Unfortunately, this procedure requires the number of data sets to be greater than 10 and the number of methods to be greater than 5 (Dem\u0161ar, 2006) . Because we have 13 classifiers to compare and only 5 data sets, we cannot use this procedure. However, as noted by Dem\u0161ar (Dem\u0161ar, 2006) , the average ranks by themselves provide a reasonably fair comparison of classifiers. Hence, we use average ranks to compare BCPred with the other methods. As shown in Table 2 , BCPred and K sub \u00f03;0:5\u00de have average ranks 1 and 2, respectively, followed by AAP and LA kernel with average ranks 3.4 and 4.1.",

To explore this question, we generated five additional homology-reduced data sets, BCP22, BCP24, BCB26, BCP28, and BCP30 (corresponding to epitope lengths of 22, 24, 26, 28, and 30, respectively) and compared the performance of BCPred on the resulting data sets using fivefold cross-validation.

There are at least three possible explanations: (i) BCP28 includes longer segments of epitope sequences of length greater than 20 amino acids in the data set than BCP20; (ii) Some of the hard-to-predict epitopes in BCP20 are eliminated from BCP28 because these epitopes are located very close to the ends of the antigen sequence and so extending these epitopes to 28 amino acids in length by adding an equal number of amino acids from both ends is not possible; (iii) amino acid neighbors of the epitopes carry some useful signal that helps the classifier to better discriminate epitopes from non-epitopes.",

Therefore, BCP28 and MBCP20 can be viewed as two different representations of the same set of epitope/non-epitope data. However, the sequence similarity between any pair of epitopes in BCP28 is guaranteed to be less than 80% but this is not necessarily the case for epitopes in MBCP20. The performance of BCPred on MBCP20 data set is shown in Table 4 . The results show that the performance of BCPred on MBCP20, the trimmed version of BCP28, is worse than that on BCP28. This observation provides some evidence against the second of the three possible explanations for observed improvements in performance with epitope length chosen to construct the data sets used to train and test BCPred. It also lends some credence to the suggestion that the amino acid neighbors of the B-cell epitopes may help the classifier to better discriminate between epitopes and non-epitope sequences. As noted earlier, another possibility is that increasing the length results in covering a larger fraction of epitope sequence in the data set in the case of epitope sequences that are longer than 20 amino acid in length (about 13% of the epitopes).",

Unfortunately, because the code and precise parameters used to train several of these methods are not available, we were unable to make direct comparisons of these methods using the homology-reduced data sets we used in our first set of experiments (summarized in Tables 1 and 2 ). However, we were able to compare BCPred with our implementation of APP and ABCPred, using the publicly available benchmark data sets (Saha and Raghava, 2006a ) that were used to evaluate ABCPred. Because the best reported performance of ABCPred was obtained using a data set of 16-mer peptides, comprising 700 epitopes and 700 non-epitopes peptides, we used the same data set, ABCP16, to compare ABCPred with BCPred and AAP. In addition, a blind test set, SBT16, consisting of 187 epitopes and 200 16-mer non-epitopes, also made available by Saha and Raghava (2006a) , was used to compare the three methods. Table 5 compares the performance of BCPred, AAP, and ABCPred on ABCP16 data set (Saha and Raghava, 2006a ), using fivefold cross-validation. In terms of overall accuracy, both BCPred Y.

How can we explain the observation that BCPred and AAP outperform ABCPred in fivefold cross validation experiments using ABCP16 data set but not on the blind test set, SBT16 data set? Could the observed differences in relative performance be explained by differences in the two data sets, BCP16 and ABCP16? To explore this possibility, we considered the procedures used to create the data sets. Recall that Saha and Raghava (2006b) started with a data set of 20-mer peptides (after extending the length of shorter B-cell epitopes based on the corresponding antigen sequences). [As noted above, there is a possibility that the resulting data set of 20-mer peptides includes several highly similar peptides (e.g., peptides that differ from each other in only one or two amino acids). More importantly, the 16-mer data set, ABCP16, was derived from the 20-mer data set, ABCP20, by trimming two amino acids from the ends of each 20-mer peptide; as a result, two 20-mers that were not duplicates of each other might yield 16-mers that are highly similar after the ends are trimmed off. In summary, the ABCP20 data set reported by Saha and Raghava (2006b) was constructed from unique epitopes without applying any homology reduction filters. Moreover, the procedure used by Saha and Raghava (2006b) to derive ABCP16 from ABCP20 can be expected to increase the pair-wise similarity between sequences in ABCP16 relative to the pairwise sequence similarity within ABCP20.",

This observation leads us to conclude that the observed differences in the performance of BCPred and AAP on the homology-reduced data set (BCP16) relative to that on the ABCP16 data set, as well as the results of comparisons of AAP, ABCPred, and BCPred on the blind test set (SBT16), are explained by the presence of a relatively large number of highly similar peptides in ABCP16 data set.",

In reality, unique epitopes may share a high degree of similarity (e.g., a shorter epitope may be included within a longer one, or two epitopes may differ in only one or two amino acids). In this work, we demonstrated that cross-validation performance estimated on such data sets can be overly optimistic. Moreover, such data sets can lead to false conclusions when used to compare different prediction methods. For instance, our comparison of ABCPred, AAP, and BCPred using fivefold crossvalidation on ABCP16 data set suggested that AAP and BCPred significantly outperform ABCPred.

Infection by SARS-CoV is initiated by the binding of its spike (S) protein to its functional receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is expressed on the surface of host cells (Dimitrov, 2003; Li et al., 2003) . The S protein comprises 1255 amino acids and consists of two functional domains: S1 (residues 1-667) and S2 (residues 668-1255) (Wu et al., 2004) . The S1 domain is responsible for binding to receptors on target cells (Li et al., 2003) and the S2 domain contributes to the subsequence fusion between viral envelope and cellular membrane (Beniac et al., 2006) . In addition, the S2 domain contains two highly conserved heptad repeat (HR) regions, HR1 and HR2 correspond to amino acid residues 915-949 and 1150-1184, respectively (Sainz et al., 2005) . Several studies reported that the receptor-binding domain (RBD), residues 318-510, is an attractive target for developing SARS-CoV vaccine because blocking the binding of S1 domain to cellular receptors can prevent envelope fusion and virus entry mediated by the S2 domain (Sui et al., 2004; Prabakaran et al., 2006) . Based on these findings, we surveyed the literature to collect previously identified epitopes within the RBD fragment of the SARS-CoV S protein. The collected epitopes are summarized in Table 8 . None of these epitopes appears in our training data sets. Because epitope SP3 is included within the epitope (434-467) (GNYNY-KYRYLKHGKLRPFERDISNVPFSPDGKPC) reported by Lien et al. (2007) , we omitted the longer epitope.",

Figure 3 shows the BCPred (top) and AAP (bottom) predictions returned by BCPREDS.

Three of the five epitopes predicted by AAP have substantial overlap with the SP1, SP2, and SP5 epitopes, and the fourth partially overlaps epitopes SP2 and SP3; the fifth does not overlap with any experimentally reported epitopes. In contrast, the ABCPred server, using default parameters, returned 22 predictions covering almost the entire query sequence. BepiPred returned nine predicted variablelength epitopes, but only three of them are longer than four residues in length. Two out of these four epitopes overlap with experimentally reported epitopes. The complete ABCPred and BepiPred predictions are provided in the Supplementary Materials. In evaluating these results, it is worth noting that a high false positive rate is more problematic than an occasional false negative prediction in the B-cell epitope prediction task (S\u00f6 llner and Mayer, 2006) , because a major goal of B-cell epitope prediction tools is to reduce the time and expense of wet lab experiments. The B-cell epitopes predicted over the entire SARS-CoV S protein using BCPred is given in Figure S3 . Interestingly, the predictions of BCPred over the RBD region are identical regardless of whether the predictions are made over only the RBD sequence fragment or over the entire S protein sequence of SARS-CoV.",

We explored four string kernel methods and compared them to the widely used RBF kernel. Our results demonstrate the usefulness of the four string kernels in predicting linear B-cell epitopes, with the subsequence kernel showing a superior performance over other kernels. In addition, we observed that the subsequence kernel is less sensitive to the choice of the parameter k than the k-spectrum and (k,m)-mismatch kernels. Our experiments using fivefold crossvalidation on a homology-reduced data set of 701 linear B-cell epitopes and 701 non-epitopes demonstrated that the subsequence kernel significantly outperforms other kernel methods in addition to APP method . To the best of our knowledge, the subsequence kernel (Lodhi et al., 2002) although previously used in text classification and natural language processing applications, have not been widely exploited in the context of macromolecular sequence classification tasks. The superior performance of the subsequence kernel on B-cell epitope prediction task suggests that it might find use in other related macromolecular sequence classification tasks, e.g., MHC binding peptide prediction (Salomon and Flower, 2006; Cui et al., 2006) and protein subcellular localization prediction (Bulashevska and Eils, 2006; Yu et al., 2006) .",

            "text": "One of the challenges for developing reliable linear B-cell epitope predictors is how to deal with the large variability in the length of the epitopes which ranges from 3 to 30 amino acids in length. Many standard machine learning methods require training and testing the classifier using sequences of fixed length. For example, the AAP method was evaluated on a data set where the length of the input sequences was fixed to 20 amino acids. Saha and Raghava (2006b) experimented with data sets consisting of peptide sequences of length 20 and shorter, and reported optimal performance of ABCPred classifier on a data set consisting of 16-mer peptides. In BepiPred (Larsen et al., 2006) and propensity scale based methods (Karplus and Schulz. 1985; Emini et al., 1985; Parker et al., 1986; Pellequer et al., 1991; Saha and Raghava, 2004) , the training examples are windows of five or seven amino acids labeled according to whether the amino acid at the center of the window is included in a linear B-cell epitope or not. Here, we evaluated BCPred on several data sets consisting of fixed length peptides with lengths ranging from 12 to 30 amino acids with incremental step equal to 2. Our results suggest that amino acid neighbors of the B-cell epitope carry some useful information that can help the classifier to discriminate better between epitopes and non-epitopes. This is especially interesting in light of the observation that adding a single amino acid to a linear B-cell epitope may affect binding to the antibody.",

            "text": "A similar situation arises in predicting the major histocompatibility complex class II (MHC-II) binding peptides. The length of MHC-II binding peptides typically varies from 11 to 30 amino acids in length. Most of the currently available MHC-II binding peptide prediction methods focus on identifying a putative 9-mer binding core region. Therefore, classifiers are trained using 9-mer peptides instead of variable length ones. Recently, two methods (Cui et al., 2006; Salomon and Flower, 2006) for predicting variable length MHC-II peptides have been proposed. Both methods use the entire sequences of MHC-II binding peptides (as opposed to only the 9-mer cores) for training MHC-II binding peptide predictors. The first method (Cui et al., 2006 ) maps a variable length peptide into a fixed length feature vector obtained from sequence-derived structural and physicochemical properties of the peptide. The second method (Salomon and Flower, 2006) uses the local alignment (LA) kernel that we used in this study. It would be interesting to apply these methods to the problem of learning to identify variable length linear B-cell epitopes. Our ongoing work aims at exploring the application of string kernels for learning from flexible length linear B-cell epitopes.",

In our experiments using the Saha and Raghava (2006b) 16-mer peptide data set (containing approximately 700 B-cell epitopes and 700 non-epitope peptides) on which ABCPred had the best reported performance of 66%, both BCPred and AAP outperformed ABCPred, based on fivefold cross-validation. However, when the classifiers were tested on a separate blind test set instead, no significant difference was observed in their performance. Careful examination of the ABCPred 16-mer data set revealed that the data set has a high degree of sequence redundancy among the epitope peptides, leading to overly optimistic estimates of performance in some cases.",

We showed that the redundancy in such a data set can be reflected in overly-optimistic performance estimates, especially for certain types of machine learning classifiers. Consequently, using such a data set can also lead to false conclusions when directly comparing different prediction methods. Therefore, it is very important to evaluate and compare different linear B-cell epitope prediction methods on data sets that are truly non-redundant or homology-reduced with respect to their constituent epitope sequences, i.e., in which the level of pair-wise sequence identity shared between individual epitopes is known. Towards this goal, we have made our homology-reduced data set of linear B-cell epitopes (with <80% sequence identity) publicly available as a benchmarking data set for comparing existing and future linear B-cell epitope prediction methods.",
