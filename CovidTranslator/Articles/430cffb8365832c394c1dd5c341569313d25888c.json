Two strains of mice were studied: BALB/c mice, which develop an acute and lethal hepatitis and C3H mice which develop a chronic brain infection. In BALB/c mice, viral RNA and antigens appeared during the first 24 h post infection (p.i.) in liver, whereas viral RNA was barely detectable in brain, up until death at day 3 p.i. In C3H mice, viral RNA and antigens were detected simultaneously in liver and brain only at day 2 p.i. In brain, the virus was detected in meningeal and ependymal cells and in perivascular cortical areas (days 5 and 7 p.i.). After day 49, the virus was no longer detected in brain parenchyma, but persisted in meningeal cells. Two host-dependent genetic differences in viral processing were observed in the liver: (1) the virus was first detected in Kupffer cells in BALB/c mice and mostly in hepatocytes in C3H mice; (2) in BALB/c mice, the 180kDa S viral glycoprotein appeared more frequently cleaved in 90 kDa form than in C3H mice.",

Experimental diseases induced in mice by coronaviruses allow a convenient approach to study this question, since the induced pathologies depend upon the genetic origin of the infected mice [12, 20] . Thus, intraperitoneal injection of murine hepatitis virus type 3 (MHV 3) into adult mice results either in early death (at day 3 to 4 post infection, p.i.) due to hepatitis in the BALB/c strain, an absence of patent disease in the A/Jax strain, or in the development of neurologic symptoms in the C3H strain [4, [16] [17] [18] 20] . In the latter strain, central nervous system (CNS) lesions are different from those induced by other coronaviruses and consist of ependymitis, meningitis, and vasculitis followed by hydrocephalus. They are related to a chronic infection since a low viral titer can be detected in brain for several weeks after infection [16, 18] . Genetic variations in MHV 3-induced diseases were initially linked to differences observed in vitro in the rate of viral replication in host cells [1, 9, 11, 19] .",

Hepatocytes containing viral antigens were more numerous than Kupffer cells containing viral antigens. During the next few days, the intensity of detection increased slowly, up to a maximum reached between days 4 and 7 p.i. when 20 to 40% of liver cells expressed either viral antigens or viral RNA. Endothelial cells containing viral antigens were very infrequent and no Ito cells were labeled. By day 11 p.i., the number of positive cells decreased and by day mice viral antigen detection is mostly restricted to hepatocytes 21 p.i., R N A was no longer detected, whereas viral antigens were still found in a few cells. Liver morphology was normal at this time. From day 28 p.i., neither viral R N A nor antigens could be observed.",

            "text": "Several studies in vivo have failed to localize MHV 3 within the brain of C3H mice, although neuropathological lesions were dramatic [16, 18] . We previously observed in vitro that MHV 3 had a higher affinity for neurons, ependymal cells and meningeal cells than for astrocytes or oligodendrocytes [17] . The present study demonstrated this selective affinity of MHV 3 from the Mill Hill strain for these types of cells in vivo. It also gave an indication of the diffusion of the virus within the brain. Meningeal cells appeared to be the first infected cells. Thereafter, the virus was observed along the ependymal cell line and in increasingly larger perivascular cortical areas, finally disappearing from brain parenchyma, the last infected CNS cells being the meningeal cells. Thus, Fig. 4 . Time sequence analysis of viral transcripts in C3H brain. Coronal sections of C3H brain, obtained at B days 5 ( x 8), C 7 ( x 8), D 11 ( x 150), and E, F 77 p.i. (E bright field illumination; F dark field illumination; x 75) and A uninfected control section ( x 8) were hybridized with MHV 3-specific [35S]probe followed by hematoxylin staining. The first viral RNA containing cells appear to be ependymal cells (B) followed by cells in disseminated areas of cortex and diencephalon (C and D). After 77 days of infection, viral RNA detection was restricted to meningeal cells M H V 3 from the Mill Hill strain differs from other coronaviruses in both its spread within brain and the type of cells it can infect [8, 13] . In C3H mice, the virus appeared to spread less rapidly through liver and earlier towards the brain than in BALB/c mice. This could be related to two host-dependent differences in early viral processing, as we observed. which was detected only in Kupffer cells in SJL mice but mostly in hepatocytes and in some Kupffer cells in BALB/c mice [2] . A second difference was the observation that the 180kDa S viral glycoprotein appeared more frequently cleaved into 90 kDa S glycoproteins in the livers of BALB/c mice than in the livers of C3H mice. This could depend on a difference in cleavage ability of S proteins by Kupffer cells and hepatocytes, although a genetic control of intracellular transport or cleavage of S proteins could not be excluded. Such a difference in the ability of host cells to cleave the 180 kDa S glycoproteins of a coronavirus has already been demonstrated in vitro to be responsible for a higher cellular fusion activity induced by the virions [-7, 14, 21] . One could hypothesize that Kupffer cells/macrophages, the first infected cells in BALB/c mice, may be more efficient for proteolytic cleavage of the S glycoprotein than hepatocytes, a situation that would induce a higher rate of cell fusions within the liver. A lower affinity of MHV 3 for Kupffer cells from the C3H lineage could allow larger amounts of virus to diffuse and invade the brain during the early stages of infection.",
