This study aimed to identify the industries most vulnerable to the effects of dengue fever by 2030. The assessment was done by considering the international supply chain, with aspects such as the labor intensity, and the relevant geographical and socioeconomic aspects being taken into account. In addition, multi-regional input-output tables were employed to analyze the ripple effects of productivity losses resulting from workers contracting the disease. The results indicate that more than 10% of the workers involved in the supply chain of all the major industries in the United States (USA), China, Japan, and Germany could be considered at risk of contracting dengue fever by 2030. Moreover, the risk was even higher in India and Brazil, namely, more than 70%. The effect of widespread dengue fever infection could influence industrial activities severely, not only in the regions most at risk (India and Brazil) but also in the other regions (USA, Japan, and Germany). Labor-intensive industries, such as agriculture, fisheries, and the distribution sector are particularly at risk and will have to consider appropriate contingency measures. It is recommended that the downstream side of the supply chain, the industries in the USA, Japan, and Germany, supports the introduction of worker's health management system against the infectious disease into their business partners. This study employed limited data and only estimated the possible effects of the disease by 2030. Further comprehensive analysis is required with more data modeled for the future to verify and enhance the reliability of the present results.",

After infection, the symptoms typically appear after an incubation period of 3 to 7 days (Simmons et al. 2012 ). In the initial febrile phase, the patients suffer from high temperature (\u226538.5\u00b0C), headaches, vomiting, myalgia, and joint pain, often accompanied by a transient macular rash. This phase lasts for 3 to 7 days, after which most patients recover without any complications (Simmons et al. 2012) . However, in a small number of cases, the condition of the patient deteriorates and dengue hemorrhagic fever could develop. This condition could be fatal without proper medical care. In December 2015, the first dengue vaccine was licensed; however, currently, it is not available widely and treatment therefore remains supportive (Pitisuttithum and Bouckenooghe 2016; World Health Organization 2016) .",

The increase in the incidence of dengue fever has been ascribed to the changing human ecology, demography, and globalization, and probably climate change (World Health Organization 2012). For example, for the first time in metropolitan France, two cases of autochthonous dengue fever were diagnosed in September 2010 (La Ruche et al. 2010) . Furthermore, after 70 years with no confirmed autochthonous cases of dengue fever in Japan, 19 cases were reported in Tokyo during August and September 2014 (Kutsuna et al. 2015) . It has been predicted that climate change would contribute to an expansion at the fringes of the current distribution of dengue fever, with 4.39 billion people being at risk of contracting the disease by 2030 (Hales et al. 2014) .",

Absence from work often results in economic losses (Suaya et al. 2009 ), and the estimated total annual cost (i.e., direct and indirect medical costs) associated with the disease amounted to US$2.1 billion in the Americas for the period 2000 -2007 (Shepard et al. 2011 . It has been calculated that these costs were mostly related to productivity losses induced by non-fatal dengue fever cases, whereas the deaths resulting from the disease accounted for only a small proportion (2.6%) of the total costs (Shepard et al. 2011) .

Moreover, it is clear that labor-intensive industries are relatively more at risk to such losses. In addition, geographical aspects have to be considered, as the virus-bearing mosquitos favor areas that have high temperatures and water available. Furthermore, socioeconomic aspects are important, as developed countries have a greater capacity to provide appropriate treatment smoothly. Therefore, the labor intensity of an industry and the geographical and socioeconomic aspects should be taken into account to identify regions where the risk of dengue virus infection is high. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has indicated that risk results from the interaction of hazard, vulnerability, and exposure (IPCC 2014). The life cycle assessment framework for adaptive planning (LCA-AP) to climate change adopted this concept and is able to evaluate the potential climatic effects on industries throughout the supply chain (Nakano 2015a) . This method quantifies inputs (e.g., water and workforce) to industrial activities that could be affected by climatic factors. Such inventory analysis results indicate the risk of exposure to the infection (Nakano 2015a) . In LCA-AP, the inventory analysis results are adjusted by accounting for the geographical aspect (hazard) and the socioeconomic aspect (vulnerability). Furthermore, LCA-AP is able to utilize the wellestablished LCA database. LCA-AP was therefore used in this study to evaluate the risk to the industry of dengue infection through the international supply chain. The potential effects of dengue infection were calculated by multiplying the inventory analysis result and a factor accounting for the country-specific climate hazard, as well as the socioeconomic vulnerability characteristics, as follows:",

Note that the scales of the vertical and horizontal axes of Fig. 2 are different among the countries to express the economic size and the effects relevant to each country. An extremely significant effect (342 person/m EUR) was indicated for the fish product sector in the USA. Similarly, significant effects were indicated for the fish product sector in the other countries, whereas the production values of this sector were small. In China, the textile, food product, and hotel and restaurant sectors showed relatively higher production values and effects. In Japan, the motor vehicle sector had the largest production value, whereas the effect was small. In Germany, the plastic sector showed a relatively higher production value and effect. However, the scale of the vertical axes of the graphs for both Germany and Japan was smaller by 1 digit in comparison with the other countries. No major industrial sectors in Japan or Germany were located in the upper right side of the graphs; therefore, no critical sectors were identified in either of these countries. In Brazil and India, the construction sector showed relatively higher production values and effects. Most of the effects were induced by the local construction industries (Table 3 ) and, as this industry is labor intensive, appropriate countermeasures would have to be introduced in these two countries. The major emerging countries, such as China, Brazil, and India showed significant effects relevant to the food product and hotel and restaurant sectors, whereas the production values were not significant ( Table 4 ).",

The fish product sector in the USA purchased fish amounting to 474 m EUR locally, 825 m EUR from South American countries, 1 692 m EUR from Asia-Pacific countries, 2 and 269 m EUR from African countries 3 (Wood et al. 2015) . These exporting countries have a higher percentage of population at risk of contracting dengue fever (Table 1) . Furthermore, the labor intensity of the fishing sector in the USA is 8.6 workers/m EUR, whereas it is 2841 workers/m EUR in the Asia-Pacific countries, and 444 workers/m EUR in the African countries (Wood et al. 2015) .

The plant-based fiber sector provides the main materials to the textile sector, such as cotton (Gossypium spp) and jute (Corchorus capsularis). The textile sector in China purchases 20,532 m EUR from the chemical sector and 8497 m EUR from the local plant-based fiber sector in China in 2007 (Wood et al. 2015) . The purchase amount of the chemical sector exceeded that of the plant-based fiber sector; however, the labor intensity of the chemical sector (14.7 workers/m EUR) was much lower than was that of the plant-based fiber sector (762 workers/m EUR) (Wood et al. 2015) , and the plant-based fiber sector was therefore identified as a significant sector.

Moreover, the plant-based fiber sector provides materials (e.g., cotton) to the textile sector; consequently, there is a need to reinforce the risk management for dengue fever infection.",

These guidelines and activities could lead to support introduction of countermeasures to infectious disease to business partners and reduce business risk. However, a number of enterprises still do not implement such activities. Therefore, it is recommended that international initiatives, such as the United Nations Global Compact (United Nations 2017), clearly advice companies to support introduction of worker's health management systems to their business partners. These activities reduce business risks (Godfrey et al. 2009 ); therefore, I recommend that investors positively evaluate such risk management activities.",

The study clarified the effects of dengue fever infection on various global industries by projections for 2030, taking into account the international supply chain. The results indicated that more than 10% of workers involved in the supply chain of all the major industries in the USA, China, Japan, and Germany would be at risk of contracting dengue fever by 2030, whereas more than 70% of the workers in India and Brazil would be at risk by that time. The effects of dengue fever could influence industrial activities in the regions at risk (e.g., India and Brazil) and in the other regions (e.g., USA, Japan, and Germany) through the supply chain. In particular, industries that are highly labor intensive (agriculture, fishery, and the distribution industry) would be advised to consider adequate adaptation measures. It is recommended that the downstream side of the supply chain, such as industries in the USA, Japan, and Germany, identify processes at risk of infectious disease in the supply chain where worker's health management systems should be introduced. This study indicated that implementation of such systems would reduce business risks and improve shareholder value (Godfrey et al. 2009 ); therefore, I recommend that such interventions to upstream side of the supply chain be included in investment criteria. As the study focused only on the effects of dengue fever in 2030, with limited data being available, comprehensive analysis with data modeled for the future could increase the reliability of the results.",
