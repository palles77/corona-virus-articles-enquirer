Potent siRNA inhibitors of SARS coronavirus (SCV) in vitro were further evaluated for efficacy and safety in a rhesus macaque (Macaca mulatta) SARS model using clinically viable delivery while comparing three dosing regimens. Observations of SARS-like symptoms, measurements of SCV RNA presence and lung histopathology and immunohistochemistry consistently showed siRNA-mediated anti-SARS efficacy by either prophylactic or therapeutic regimens. The siRNAs used provided relief from SCV infection-induced fever, diminished SCV viral levels and reduced acute diffuse alveoli damage. The 10-40 mg/kg accumulated dosages of siRNA did not show any sign of siRNA-induced toxicity. These results suggest that a clinical investigation is warranted and illustrate the prospects for siRNA to enable a massive reduction in development time for new targeted therapeutic agents.",

Individuals with SARS usually develop a high fever followed by severe clinical symptoms including acute respiratory distress syndrome with a diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) at autopsy 2,4,9 . The containment of SARS has been achieved largely through traditional quarantine and sanitation measures 9,10 . Because SARS is a newly emerging disease, a safe and effective vaccine is not yet available 11 , although some candidate vaccines have been advanced to monkey models and clinical testing [12] [13] [14] [15] . To treat individuals with SARS, combinations of existing drugs, including ribavirin, antibiotics, anti-inflammatory steroids and immune stimulators, have achieved some clinical success [16] [17] [18] . Many ongoing efforts to develop SARSspecific drugs, such as screening of small-molecule inhibitors and current biologic approaches, will clarify the strengths and weaknesses of each approach, based on the ultimate success rate and the time and cost incurred 19, 20 .",

Therefore, siRNAs showing prominent prophylactic and therapeutic activity in cell culture 24 , referred to as siSC2 and siSC5, were further evaluated in vivo, first using a reporter gene assay in mice and subsequently using a clinically acceptable intranasal administration in the recently established Rhesus macaque SARS model 21, 22 . The study provided strong evidence that these siRNA agents are potent both for prophylactic and therapeutic treatment of SARS infection, and they lack toxicity in this nonhuman primate model. The results support the growing expectation that siRNA can fulfill the need for moving rapidly from gene sequence to targeted therapeutic agents for many previously intractable disease targets.",

Potent siRNA inhibitors of SARS coronavirus (SCV) in vitro were further evaluated for efficacy and safety in a rhesus macaque (Macaca mulatta) SARS model using clinically viable delivery while comparing three dosing regimens. Observations of SARS-like symptoms, measurements of SCV RNA presence and lung histopathology and immunohistochemistry consistently showed siRNA-mediated anti-SARS efficacy by either prophylactic or therapeutic regimens. The siRNAs used provided relief from SCV infection-induced fever, diminished SCV viral levels and reduced acute diffuse alveoli damage. The 10-40 mg/kg accumulated dosages of siRNA did not show any sign of siRNA-induced toxicity. These results suggest that a clinical investigation is warranted and illustrate the prospects for siRNA to enable a massive reduction in development time for new targeted therapeutic agents.",

The containment of SARS has been achieved largely through traditional quarantine and sanitation measures 9, 10 . Because SARS is a newly emerging disease, a safe and effective vaccine is not yet available 11 , although some candidate vaccines have been advanced to monkey models and clinical testing [12] [13] [14] [15] . To treat individuals with SARS, combinations of existing drugs, including ribavirin, antibiotics, anti-inflammatory steroids and immune stimulators, have achieved some clinical success [16] [17] [18] . Many ongoing efforts to develop SARSspecific drugs, such as screening of small-molecule inhibitors and current biologic approaches, will clarify the strengths and weaknesses of each approach, based on the ultimate success rate and the time and cost incurred 19, 20 .",

Cotransfection of pCI-scLuc and siSC2-5 into cultured cells confirmed that siSC2-5 can specifically knock down luciferase expression (data not shown). To identify a clinically viable carrier for siRNA delivery into mouse lung, we selected two carriers currently in clinical use, D5W solution 29 and Infasurf solution 30 , which have been applied in delivery of DNA 31 and siRNA 32 to animal models. Twenty-four hours after intratracheal administration of 30 mg of pCI-scLuc plasmid DNA and 30 mg of siSC2-5 in 100 ml of D5W or Infasurf solution into BALB/c mouse lungs, we analyzed luciferase expression in the lung tissues. Co-delivery of pCI-scLuc plasmid with siSC2-5 in D5W solution resulted in a higher level of reporter gene expression and a stronger RNAi effect than that delivered in the Infasurf solution (Fig. 1d) . We noted that TransIT-TKO and polyethyleneimine have been reported as carriers for intranasal 33 , intratracheal 34 and intravenous 35 deliveries of siRNA into mouse models for treatment of influenza virus and respiratory syncytial virus infections. But those carriers are not feasible for clinical use, especially polyethyleneimine, because it can induce severe lung inflammation through either intravenous or intratracheal delivery in mice based on our experience (data not shown) and literature reports 36, 37 . The substantial silencing effect achieved in mouse lungs strongly supported that siSC2-5 is a potent inhibitor of SCV RNA, but also that D5W is a very effective carrier for siRNA in the mammalian respiratory tract. In addition, a lack of visible lung damage after intratracheal delivery of 30 mg siRNA and 30 mg plasmid DNA together provided a safe baseline for siRNA dosing to the respiratory tract of larger mammals.",

In contrast, 10 of 12 macaques from the siSC2-5-treated groups showed a milder elevation of body temperature. All animals displayed a loss of appetite and some became agitated and aggressive. General observation of the lung histology specimens indicated that lung lesions developed with congestions and palpable nodules, which were scattered in distribution and were localized particularly at the posterior part of different lobes 22 . The most severe lung damage occurred focally and was surrounded by large areas of obvious pathology, whereas milder lung damage appeared with smaller areas of pathology.",

Within damaged lung tissues, we identified viral-infected pneumocytes, infiltrated neutrophils, lymphocytes and monocytes using IHC stains of keratin ( Fig. 3e) , CD68 (Fig. 3f) , CD4, CD8 and CD35 (data not shown).

We recorded body temperature of every animal daily until it was killed. Comparison of the mean body temperatures of all five groups (Fig. 4a) revealed significantly lower temperatures of all treated groups (prophylactic, co-delivery and postexposure treatment groups; below 38.9 1C) versus the control groups (viral infection and nonspecific siRNA groups), which had temperatures above 39.1 1C, indicating a fever status 22 . The prophylactic treatment group had the lowest temperature (38.7 1C), close to the normal body temperature of Rhesus monkey (38.5 1C) . Examining the distribution of the average body temperature at each time point throughout the entire 20-d period with trend regression (Fig. 4b) , we found that viral infection and nonspecific siRNA control groups had consistently elevated temperatures above 39 1C. Macaque #212 from the viral infection control group had a high fever (40 1C) at 4 d.p.i. and the fever lasted until the macaque was killed at 20 d.p.i. for pathology analysis, at which time it showed a severe lung damage that we scored as ''+++'' . A similar situation was seen for macaque #208 of the nonspecific siRNA group. The comparison of mean body temperature trend regression clearly shows the prophylactic and therapeutic effects of siSC2-5 on suppression of fever induced by SCV infection. In addition, the inhibitory effects of siSC2-5 also resulted in lowering SCV-specific IgG titer in blood samples (Fig. 4c) . We detected SCVspecific IgG levels in viral control and nonspecific siRNA control groups as early as 10 d.p.i., but not in the co-delivery and postexposure treatment groups. We were able to detect SCV-specific IgG titers of all groups at 19 d.p.i. siRNA protected lung from severe acute DAD In the viral infection control group, macaques #212 and #206 had severe acute DAD with pathological changes in a large portion of the lungs, including interstitial infiltrates and lung damage that we scored as ''+++'' . Macaque #202 of the nonspecific siRNA control group showed even more severe acute DAD in a large portion of the lung, with massive cell infiltration and alveoli shrinkage, sheets of septa fusion, necrotic lesions at the hemorrhagic septa and extensive loss of alveolar and bronchiolar epithelium, representing a typical lung damage score of ''++++'' , the worst case among all 20 SCV-exposed macaques. All macaques from both viral infection and nonspecific siRNA control groups suffered from severe acute DAD with a lung damage score of ''+++'' . On the other hand, lung tissues from all three siSC2-5-treated groups (prophylactic, co-delivery and postexposure treatment groups) showed relatively mild severity of acute DAD and none showed lung damage beyond a score of (a) Section from macaque #214 shows the alveolar walls collapsed and acute diffuse interstitial injury with interstitial edema (arrows) at an early stage of the disease.

They showed that SCV viral RNA was detectable in all samples from the viral infection and nonspecific siRNA control groups, but undetectable in 75% of the samples from the siSC2-5 treatment groups (Fig. 5a ). This result indicated the possible inhibition of SCV infection and replication through siSC2-5facilitated viral RNA degradation in upper airway epithelial cells. The three positive samples from the treatment groups suggest that the dosing regimens were unable to totally eliminate SCV infection. The histopathology analyses of those macaques (#130, 166 and 210) have indeed shown some degrees of lung damage at scores of ''+'' or ''++'' . The Q-RT-PCR detection of the randomly selected lung tissue specimens also showed the presence of the SCV RNA ( Supplementary Fig.  2 online) . We also applied the oropharyngeal swab samples for active viral rescue in the Vero cell culture, showing that samples from all five groups were positive for live SCV particles. To evaluate SCV infection in deeper lung, we carefully inspected IHC staining images from each lung section, with SCV antigen-specific monoclonal antibody. The samples from viral infection and nonspecific siRNA groups presented much more infected cells (Fig. 5b-d) than those from siSC2-5-treated groups ( Fig. 5e-g) . The SCV-infected cells include the type I pneumocytes (Fig. 5c,e) , type II pneumocytes (Fig. 5f) and macrophages (Fig. 5d) , the presence of which was consistent with the observation in the previous studies with macaque models and in individuals with SARS 4, 9, 10, [19] [20] [21] [22] . We further counted the infected cells in each lung section and compared these numbers for the five groups. The lungs from all three siSC2-5 treatment groups had significantly lower counts of the SCV-infected cells (Fig. 5h) , which indicated that the siRNA treatments were able to inhibit SCV replication and spread within the monkey lungs.",

Our study put both efficacy and safety in equal consideration in order to define a therapeutic window for use of siRNA as an anti-SARS agent through airway administration. The choice of the siSC2-5 dosage at 10 mg/kg was based on the mouse study described above and study reports on antisense oligomers 38 . Through observation of behavior patterns of Rhesus macaques during the entire study and examination of the organs of killed animals with various siRNA dosing regimens, no safety concerns arose. The treatment groups lacked evidence of inflammation or toxicity not attributable to the SCV infection. The total accumulated dosage of siRNA administrated to individual macaques ranged from 10 mg/kg to 40 mg/kg and did not cause any visible differences in appearance, behavior or sign of organ damage when examined by autopsy and necropsy. In addition, we found no statistically significant differences in internal organ coefficients among the five groups (Supplementary Table 3 online). Reports of potential 'off-target' effects of the siRNA agent [39] [40] [41] have been mostly based on cell-culture experiments, without evidence for in vivo siRNA toxicity 29, 31 . From the results of routine blood examination and liver enzymatic analysis, we found some increases of alanine aminotransferase, lactic acid dehdryogenase, creatine kinase, aspartate dehydrogenase, hemoglobin and platelet levels in the blood samples. Because those increases are from SCVinfected macaques, with or without siRNA treatment, they were probably results from the viral infection rather than the siRNA treatments ( Supplementary Tables 1 and 2 online) .",

This anti-SARS efficacy of siSC2-5 could be the result of one or more of the following three mechanisms: protection of cells from SCV infection, degradation of SCV mRNA inhibiting viral protein synthesis in infected cells 24 , or obstruction of SCV genome replication and spread to uninfected cells. Considering that SARS-specific neutralizing antibody in SCV-infected macaques can be detected as early as 10 d.p.i., we speculated that the clinical benefit of siRNA-mediated anti-SARS activity observed in this study was the consequence of combined activities of the siRNA agent and the neutralizing antibody, suggesting that multiple antiviral mechanisms were operative.",

The mechanism of action might be the result of direct degradation of viral RNA by preexisting siSC2-5 within the upper airway cells upon entry of the viral particle, blocking replication and spread of SCV particles.

In contrast to such proinflammatory cytokine treatments, intranasal delivery of siRNA offers a unique method for high-specificity inhibition of SCV with minimal induction of a proinflammatory cytokine antiviral response that may help to avoid exacerbation of symptoms and lung damage. Here, we present evidence for a strong anti-SARS activity without any visible adverse effects through intranasal administration of siSC2-5 in a clinically viable aqueous solution with a nonhuman primate SARS model. Our data suggest that clinical testing of siSC2-5 agent as a SARS treatment is warranted.

We determined the severity of lung damage based on observations of five different sections of each lung by readouts from three independent pathologists who were blinded to experimental conditions. To quantify pathological changes in lung after the treatment, we calculated the average histopathlogical scores of each group using the scoring system described above. We de-waxed wax-embedded tissue sections and rehydrated them for the IHC analysis as described previously 22 . We identified the cell types based on the separate staining with corresponding monoclonal antibodies using methods described previously 21, 22 . We used viral antigen detection with IHC to indicate infected cells. We collected the SCV-infected cell counts within each microscopic image from every lung tissue section independently by three readouts with investigators blinded to the experimental conditions. We compared average cell counts of four lungs from each group (n \u00bc 4).",
