Although an attack from a wild animal, including snakes, crocodiles, large felids, and elephants, can cause dramatic injuries, falls from horseback or attacks by bulls or other large domestic animals can also maim and kill (Figures 10-1 and 10-2; Color Plates 10-2 and 10-3). A review of animal-associated injuries reported to the GeoSentinel Surveillance Network found that dog bites were the most common animal-associated injury to travelers, followed by bites from monkeys and cats. Threequarters of the exposures occurred in countries where rabies is endemic, with the majority occurring in Asia. Fifty percent of bitten travelers had a travel duration of 1 month or less, and traveling for tourism was associated with an increased risk of an animal injury. Males were more likely to receive a dog bite, whereas monkey exposures were more common for females. Children were also at increased risk of exposure. 4 Despite the risk of rabies from such exposures (fatal cases of human rabies have occurred in U.S. travelers from dog bites received during international travel 5 ), a study of returning travelers with animal injuries found that most had not had pretravel rabies vaccine 6 and two thirds of persons with injuries did not receive postexposure prophylaxis (which may not be routinely available in some countries). Rabies vaccine should be considered for all travel to rabies-endemic countries, especially for children, although a minimum travel duration of 6 weeks in an endemic area is recommended by some experts as an indication for vaccine. The strength of that recommendation should be influenced by the availability of medical care and rabies immunization products locally.",

Q fever is considered to be underdiagnosed in travelers, who can acquire it by exposure to farm animals or contaminated aerosols. 10 Travel to a farm in Guyana was associated with a cluster of human cases of Q fever, presumably from contact with a parturient goat and dog on a farm. 11 If the farm contains poultry, risks include exposure to Chlamydophila, Campylobacter, Salmonella, and avian influenza virus. Brucellosis is another potential farm-related exposure, either through direct contact with animals or consumption of unpasteurized dairy products. Brucellosis has been termed a \"travel-associated foodborne zoonosis\" in Germany, where a recent rise in cases has been traced to consumption of unpasteurized cheese from brucellosis-endemic countries. 12 In a series of brucellosis cases in San Diego, travel to Mexico was a risk factor for infection. 13 ",

Meat and dairy products may be served raw or undercooked and may be a source for zoonotic infections such as brucellosis, trichinosis, and salmonellosis in returning travelers. 27 Raw chicken sashimi from an island in Japan is known to be contaminated with Campylobacter. However, local residents do not appear to become ill, suggesting a role for acquired protective immunity that a traveler would presumably not enjoy. 28 Travelers to Southeast Asia and Africa have become infected with parasites, including Paragonimus, trematodes Clonorchis sinensis or Haplorchis pumilio, and gnathostomes. Paragonimiasis is acquired by eating raw freshwater crabs or crayfish. Gnathostomiasis is a nematode infection acquired by ingestion of various intermediate hosts in addition to fish. 29, 30 Eating unwashed produce and undercooked foods such as mollusks in some countries poses risks of numerous infectious diseases, including viral hepatitis, bacterial enteritis, and eosinophilic meningitis from rat lungworm. 31 There is increasing awareness of the infectious risks of improperly cooked poultry products. Such practices have been linked to cases of avian influenza. 32 Bovine tuberculosis transmission to human beings can involve consumption of uncooked meat as well as raw milk (see Chapter 9). 33 Bushmeat (wild game killed for food) is an important source of animal protein for communities in many parts of the world. It has been estimated that in Central Africa alone more than 1 billion kilograms of meat from wild animals are consumed each year (Figure 10-4). 34 Table 10 -3 shows the diversity of species that may end up being sold for human consumption, especially during times of civil unrest. 35 Emerging pathogens linked to bushmeat consumption include simian immunodeficiency viruses, anthrax, and hemorrhagic fever viruses. 36 Although the risk of infection from bushmeat exposure may be greatest to persons who butcher carcasses, travelers to areas where bushmeat is an important part of local diets may be at risk if they consume improperly cooked bushmeat.",

Another large segment of the pet trade involves tropical fish, which have generally been associated with fewer zoonotic diseases than other animals. Much of the remainder of the pet trade, however, is in nontraditional pets, or species that are not domesticated and are captured from the wild or captive-bred to meet an increasing demand for unusual pets. Nontraditional pets include exotic species that are nonnative to the local ecosystem and native wildlife, which are local wildlife species. The number of wild animals, including reptiles and amphibians, captured in the United States for the pet trade each year is not precisely known but appears to be in the range of millions of animals. 7 This segment of the pet trade is extremely lucrative and mainly uses the Internet, specialty newsletters, swap meets, auctions, and private sales rather than pet shops. Such settings are largely unregulated and lack disease prevention and control methods such as quarantine or veterinary care and may contribute to species reduction. Currently, 22 states ban or regulate certain exotic pets.",

More recently, African vipers have been diagnosed with severe and even fatal tickborne disease related to a Cowdria-like organism. 26 The 2003 multistate outbreak of monkeypox has received significant scientific and media attention and has a number of instructive points about imported zoonotic pathogens of wildlife.

            "text": "The magnitude and diversity of animal species being maintained as pets and the ongoing potential for novel and rare zoonoses present challenges to health care providers and public health professionals. It appears that reduction of the rate of introduced pathogens can only be achieved by everyone at every level working on some aspect of the prevention and control-from local awareness of the problem to policy changes on a national or international level that restrict the trade in live animals. 2 NASPHV has joined with CSTE in developing position statements requesting a federal interagency work group to address the risks posed by the exotic animal trade (see Developing Importation and Importation Restrictions on Exotic and Native Wildlife with Potential Adverse Impact on Public Health, available online at http:// www.cste.org/PS/2003pdfs/03-ID-13%20-%20FINAL. pdf). 30 In particular, NASPHV has called for the creation of an \"approved species\" list to reduce the threat of disease importation, more extensive inspection and quarantine of imported animals, and tracking of animals that have been imported. The AVMA is also on record discouraging exotic animals and wildlife as pets. 31 Although CDC regulations govern the importation of dogs, cats, turtles with a carapace of less than 4 inches, monkeys, bats, civets, birds from countries with H5N1 influenza, several species of African rodents, and animal products capable of causing human disease, 32 only a small number of species (including the African rodents linked to the importation of monkeypox) are currently banned. In addition, most of the animals that are imported, with the exception of avian species, are neither quarantined nor tested for infectious disease agents before entering the country. NASPHV has developed guidelines titled \"Compendium of Measures to Prevent Disease Associated with Animals in Public Settings\" to prevent spread of infections at public settings where animal contact could take place, including animal displays, petting zoos, animal swap meets, pet stores, zoological institutions, nature parks, circuses, carnivals, farm tours, livestock-birthing exhibits, county or state fairs, schools, and wildlife photo opportunities. 5 Key recommendations of these guidelines, as well as other recently published recommendations to reduce the risk of diseases related to nontraditional pets, are shown in Box 10-4.

Overly conservative approaches, including physician recommendations for their patients to relinquish pets, have largely been unheeded as owners often have strong bonds with their animals. 11 Armed with complete and accurate information, patients and their care providers can weigh these risks against the often substantial benefits of love, touch, social support, and companionship that accrue to pet owners. Zoonotic disease prevention is a shared responsibility among human, veterinary, and public health professionals. Improving communication among these persons will enhance zoonotic disease prevention. 12 ",

This man was heartbroken, trying to gather as much information as possible about what specifically he would face if he ignored his doctor's advice. Fortunately, with his permission, the veterinarian was able to contact his physi cian to discuss the relatively low risk as well as the benefits of owning a healthy pet (one that was receiving regular veteri nary care) and encouraged the doctor to continue to contact public health practitioners for information as well as this pet owner's veterinarian (with permission) about the animal's preventive health care.

The veterinarian explained the life cycle of toxoplasmosis, the epidemiology in people and cats, and that if the serology was positive it could actually be protective. The owner declined both serologic testing and euthanasia because the cat had never hunted in its lifetime, was indoors only, and was fed an exclusively commercial diet. There was no evidence of mice or rats in the house, decreasing the cat's likelihood of exposure to the parasite. However, the spouse enjoyed garden ing-a much greater potential for exposure to toxoplasmosis. Fortunately the patient always wore gloves when doing so and thoroughly washed afterwards. The veterinarian and the cat owner discussed additional toxoplasmosis exposure reduction, including proper handling of raw meats and washing raw foods. The veterinarian and cat owner agreed that the owner would be the person cleaning the litterbox, schedule overall wellness examinations of the cat every 6 months, and would bring the cat in for evaluation and zoonotic disease prevention if diar rhea or signs of respiratory disease developed.",

Although up to 80% of bites may never be reported, more than 300,000 emergency department visits occur each year for dog bites alone. 1 Approximately half of reported animal bite victims are children. Dogs are responsible for the majority of reported animal bite injuries to human beings in the United States, followed by cats and rodents. 2 Bites from human beings are rarer. With the increasing popularity of exotic pets, patients may present to emergency departments with bites from a wide range of species. In addition to trauma, infection (Color Plate 10-7) and envenomation (see Chapter 8) can be major concerns with animal bites. Animal bites can also result in allergy and anaphylaxis, which might be immediate or delayed (e.g., anaphylaxis has been reported after rodent bites and horse bites, even when the patient had a history of only mild allergic symptoms in the past 3, 4 ). In addition, the victim and/or animal owner might experience psychological trauma associated with either the bite incident itself or the consequent decisions that must be made regarding the biting animal. Animal (especially dog) bite fatalities in human beings are uncommon but occur at the rate of 1 to 2 dozen each year in the United States. 5 Animal bites are common in companion animals and livestock as well (Figure 10-19) , and fatalities in animals can occur if they are not systematically reported. The initial care and treatment of animals bitten by other animals is similar to that for animal bites in human beings.",

Human victims of dog bites tend to be younger than victims of cat bites. Bite injuries are often associated with particular types of aggressive behavior in the biting animal. These include dominance aggression, in which an animal assert its social dominance over another animal (such as a child) that it perceives as being weaker (e.g., members of a wolf pack) and possessive aggression, in which an animal attacks to prevent an object such as a toy or food being taken away. Education about reduction of animal bite risk can be incorporated into preventive health care counseling by both human health clinicians and veterinarians. Dog bite prevention recommendations by the CDC are summarized in Box 10-5.

A Cochrane review of antibiotic prophylaxis in uncomplicated dog and cat bites found no clear evidence of benefit. 9 Clinical decision making regarding antibiotic prophylaxis involves assessing the risk of infection. Risk factors include the species responsible for the bite, any information about the health of the animal, the severity and location of the bite, and whether the patient is immunocompromised or has other conditions that increase the risk of infection. High-risk bites include crush injuries that involve devascularized tissue and puncture wounds, hand involvement, significant edema, possible involvement of joints or bones, and proximity to genitalia or prosthetic joints nearby. Patients with very high-risk bites or evidence of tenosynovitis or deep infection should be admitted for parenteral antibiotics and hospital observation. Immunocompromised individuals and those with asplenia or compromising medical conditions should receive prophylactic antibiotics for most animal bites. Table 10 -10 provides recommendations for empiric antibiotic dosing for animal bites to human beings. Dog bites usually do not become infected. Reported infection rates range from 5% to 15%. 10 Cat bites often involve deep puncture wounds that are prone to infection. Infection rates from cat bites may be as high as 80%. 11 The choice of antimicrobial prophylaxis for cat bites and high-risk dog bites should cover Pasteurella, Streptococcus, and Staphylococcus. A 5-to 7-day course of antibiotics should be administered. Ferret bites are increasing in frequency with their popularity as pets and their tendency to bite. Little is known about their microbial flora. Pig bites are considered to carry a high risk for infection. 12 Alligators and related species tend to inflict severe bites and have polymicrobial flora that can lead to infection. 13 Many snake bites do not become infected. 7 Two controlled trials of prophylactic antibiotics for pit viper envenomation did not show a clinical benefit. 14, 15 Nevertheless, snake bites should be monitored for potential infection. 16 Iguana bites can be severe and infection has been reported. 17 Human bites to another human are considered high-risk bites for infection. In addition to bacterial pathogens (see Table 10 -10), risk of infection with bloodborne pathogens such as HIV and hepatitis B should be considered.",

Pet dogs, cats, and ferrets that are bitten by potentially or known rabid animals should be managed according to their rabies vaccination status. If they are currently vaccinated, a booster vaccine should be immediately administered and the pet should be observed for 45 days for signs of rabies. If the pet is unvaccinated, it should be euthanized or held in strict isolation for 180 days and provided a rabies vaccine 1 month before release from quarantine. Certain domestic animals such as rabbits are at risk of wildlife rabies if caged outside or allowed to roam outside. 29 Table 10 -12 provides recommended antibiotic therapy for animal bite infections in dogs and cats. Depending on the severity of the bite, other treatment modalities, including physical therapy, may be required for rehabilitation of the animal (Figure 10 ",
