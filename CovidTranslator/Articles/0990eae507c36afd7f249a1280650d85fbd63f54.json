Specimens were collected from 112 children with diarrhoea. The relative sensitivities of the different assays for human rotavirus were as follows: electron microscopy, 84%; immunofluorescence, 86 %; Rotalex, 88 %; Rotazyme, 89 %; immune electron microscopy, 93 %; Enzygnost, 98 %. According to our findings Enzygnost is the most sensitive method, but Rotalex is more valuable for screening a small number of faecal samples. No false-positive results were observed in the two enzyme immunoassays or in Rotalex.",

(1) , the role of these agents in infantile gastroenteritis has been well documented (2) . Human rotaviruses cannot be isolated in the usually available tissue culture, and only a few strains have been adapted for growth in vitro (3, 4) . Various methods have been developed for rapid detection of rotaviruses or their antigens in faecal extracts 9 These include electron microscopy (5) , the original diagnostic technique which is now reference method; immune electron microscopy (6) ; counter immunoelectrophoresis (7) ; complement fixation (8) ; immune adherence hemagglutination (9) ; reversed passive hemagglutination (10) ; fluorescent virus precipitation (11) ; immunofluorescence in cell culture (12) ; immunoassays using antibodies labeled with either radioisotopes (13) , enzymes (14) or lectins (15) , and antibody-coated erythrocytes (16) . The present study was undertaken to compare the ability of the following procedures to detect rotavirus in stools: electron microscopy (EM), immune electron microscopy (IEM), immunofluorescence in cell culture (IF), two commercially available enzymelinked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) systems (Rotazyme, Abbott; Enzygnost, Behring) and latex agglutination test (Rotalex, Orion). The usefulness of the respective methods in a routine diagnostic laboratory was atso assessed.",

Although rapid, it is not suitable for examination of many specimens daily, and expensive equipment is required. However, it is a \"catch-all\" method; other gastroenteritis viruses may be seen, and it permits detection of dual virus infections. IEM is more sensitive than EM.

Since virus in the IEM preparationswas often present in relatively isolated clumps, a large area of the grid tended to be devoid of any virus. IF appears to be at least as sensitive as EM, as previously described (20) , but less sensitive than IEM. All the specimens diagnosed by EM, and one sample negative in EM and IF but positive by other tests, appeared to contain infectious rotavirus. The major difficulty in the IF test is the toxicity of faecal extracts which forced us to examine higher dilutions of the specimens. These three methods, EM, IEM and IF, require special and costly equipment and prove laborious when examining large numbers of samples.",

            "text": "One of these, a simple latex agglutination test (Rotalex), has recently become commercially available. Latex particles are precoated with rabbit anti-NCDV antibodies and by means of cross reactivity of this antibody with HRV, agglutination becomes maeroscopically evident within a minute. We did not follow the manufacturer's instruction to test stools at a 1:10 dilution in Tris. Most laboratories routinely prepare 10 % or 20 % (w/v) faecal extracts in PBS or MEM clarified by low speed centrifugation which can then be used in all tests. No problems were encountered using this extract which also avoids nonspecific agglutination due to solid debris present in stools. Specificity of Rotalex was excellent; no falsepositive reactions were observed in this study. No blocking test was required, since all the specimens positive in Rotalex were positive in IEM. Nevertheless, when the method is used alone, positive tests should be confirmed by neutralisation. Although the reproducibility was good, more studies are needed to draw a definitive conclusion. Rotalex is rapid and does not require complicated or expensive equipment. We found Rotalex to be more sensitive than EM in accordance with previous reports (21, 22) . Nevertheless, its sensitivity has to be improved. The two ELISA procedures were found to be more sensitive than EM, IF and Rotalex. Enzygnost was more sensitive than Rotazyme, but we cannot explain this discrepancy. Approximately 1% of clinical specimens negative by the IEM method were positive in ELISA. All of these specimens were confirmed by blocking assay as advocated by Sarkkinen et al. (23) . Our use of a convalescent human serum for the blocking test may explain why we did not observe any false-positive results in Rotazyme or Enzygnost. The failure to detect virus by IEM in these ELISA-positive samples may be explained by the fact that human rotavirus-infected faeces contain considerable amounts \u2022More studies axe needed to establish or refute the evaluation.",

One sample that was positive in EM, IEM and IF was negative in the two ELISA procedures on two separate occasions. An explanation might be that rotavirus is covered by antibodies (25) and inhibitors are present in the faecal sample (26) . However, viruses that are morphologically indistinguishable from rotavirus but fail to react to ELISA have been detected in faecal samples from children with gastroenteritis in Washington (27) , Melbourne (28) and Paris (29) . Electrophoresis of the nucleic acid of one of these agents, which seem to lack the common group-specific antigen of rotaviruses, showed a unique migration pattern. Although a spectrophotometer was used for ELISA, results could be read visually with little difficulty. Nevertheless, these two sensitive methods also have disadvantages: the Rotazyme kit is expensive and Enzygnost is convenient only when large numbers of specimens must be assayed. In conclusion, our comparison of six methods for detecting HRV has shown that, considering all features (summarized in Table 3 ), Enzygnost is the most sensitive technique. However, Rotalex, a simple and rapid test, is more valuable for screening a small number of rotavirus isolates per day in laboratories with limited financial means.",
