Up to date, various vaccines developed against TGEV still need to be improved. To exploit the possibility of using RNA interference (RNAi) as a strategy against TGEV infection, two shRNAexpressing plasmids (pEGFP-U6/P1 and pEGFP-U6/P2) targeting the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) gene of TGEV were constructed and transfected into swine testicular (ST) cells. The cytopathic effect (CPE) and MTS assays demonstrated that both shRNAs were capable of protecting cells against TGEV invasion with very high specificity and efficiency. A real-time quantitative RT-PCR further confirmed that the amounts of viral RNAs in cell cultures pre-transfected with the two plasmids were reduced by 95.2% and up to 100%, respectively. Our results suggest that RNAi might be a promising new strategy against TGEV infection.",

However, many vaccine strategies developed so far have not been entirely successful. Firstly, inactivated TGEV vaccines generally offer poor protection in swine, while the attenuated ones are not ideal in their safety due to the risk of reverting to a virulent form, and some mucosal vaccines may even induce adverse reactions (Holmgren et al., 2003; Opriessnig et al., 2002; Saif and Wesley, 1999 Table 1 The inserted sequences in shRNA-expressing plasmids Lager, 2003) . Furthermore, neonatal piglets may suffer from gastroenteritis within 20 h post-infection and death may happen in 1-4 days (Schwegmann-Wessels and Herrler, 2006) , whereas current vaccines cannot provide complete protection prior to 7 days after inoculation (Brim et al., 1995; de los Santos et al., 2005) . So, it is urgently needed to develop a high-effective, rapid-acting antiviral strategy against TGEV. On the other hand, current research on antiviral protection triggered by RNA interference (RNAi) in vivo mainly employed mice as experimental models (Liu et al., 2006; Palliser et al., 2006) . However, studies of candidate therapeutic strategies using an adult mouse model of subclinical enteric viral infections often do not predict their efficacy in neonatal large mammals (Yuan and Saif, 2002) .",

Since it was found that experimental introduction of exogenous double-stranded RNA into C. elegans and mammalian cells could specifically silence homologous mRNA (Fire et al., 1998; Elbashir et al., 2001) , RNAi has been the most fascinating technique for hostile gene knockdown and viral inhibition (Borkhardt and Heidenreich, 2004; Robson and Sacks, 2005; van Rij and Andino, 2006) . Within a few years, a wide variety of disease-associated viruses have been targeted effectively throughout plant, animal and human kingdom, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), influenza virus and hepatitis viruses (Huelsmann et al., 2006; Li et al., 2005; Shlomai and Shaul, 2004; van Rij and Andino, 2006; Wu et al., 2005) .

To guarantee a similar RNAi effect on different TGEV strains, the two sequences were analyzed by a BLAST search in the GenBank nucleotide database to avoid any similar sequence found in the swine genome, but share a 100% homology within the published sequences of different TGEV strains. To investigate the specificity of viral inhibition, a non-specific sequence (T) also underwent a BLAST analysis and served as a negative control. Their corresponding sequences are separately shown in Table 1 . To investigate whether shRNAmediated RNAi could block TGEV infection in ST cells, all the three sequences were generated to make shRNA-expressing plasmids: pEGFP-U6/P1, pEGFP-U6/P2 and pEGFP-U6/T, respectively. The three inserted sequences were arranged as the following alignment: BamHI+ Sense+ Loop+ Antisense+ Termination signal+ SalI+ HindIII (Table 1) . Enhanced green fluorescence protein (EGFP) gene fused in the plasmids was used as a reporter during the transfection efficiency analysis. The RNA transcripts from these U6 promoter-containing plasmids were expected to fold back and form a stem-loop structure with a 19-base pair region homologous to the RdRp gene of TGEV.",

For the absorbance at 492 nm is directly proportional to the number of living cells in culture (examined by Promega), the number of living cells in a well treated with pEGFP-U6/P1 or pEGFP-U6/P2 was far greater than that treated with pEGFP-U6/T or mock control. Taken together, in this study, the significant differences of CPE inhibitory effect and viable cell number between plasmids expressing sequence-specific and non-sequence-specific shRNAs demonstrated that only the two sequence-specific shRNAs could efficiently protect ST cells against TGEV infection, which suggested that the potent protections were due to sequence-specific RNA interference.",

As the latest addition to the family of antisense technologies, it has emerged as a potentially important therapeutic strategy for antiviral activity in vitro and in vivo. Many of these kinds of studies have been focused on viruses infecting humans (Huelsmann et al., 2006; Li et al., 2005; Shlomai and Shaul, 2004; van Rij and Andino, 2006; Wu et al., 2005) .

As TGEV is a porcine coronavirus with an RNA genome, it should be, as we have found, well sensitive to RNAi, too (van Rij and Andino, 2006) . Viral RdRp plays an essential role in viral RNA replication. Many researchers have shown that siRNA/shRNA targeting the RdRp coding gene could efficiently inhibit viral replication; moreover, according to their reports, viral inhibition triggered by siRNA/shRNA targeting the RdRp gene seems more efficient compared to other genes within the same genome (Ge et al., 2003; Lu et al., 2004; Wang et al., 2004) . Therefore, the RdRp gene of TGEV, which is highly conserved among different strains, was employed as an RNAi target in this study, and our results demonstrated that two shRNAs generated from it both blocked viral replication with very high efficiency.",

Similarly, some groups have discussed an \"off-target\" effect induced by siRNA/shRNA in their reports. Scacheri et al. (2004) and Dahlgren et al. (2006) found no evidence showing that a double-stranded RNAtriggered IFN-associated antiviral pathway was activated or accounted for the non-specific effect, and Scacheri et al. (2004) further speculated that partial complementary sequence matching to \"off-target\" genes might result in a micro-RNA-like inhibition of translation. More recently, Jackson et al. (2006) confirmed his speculation by claiming that the \"off-target\" effect triggered by siRNA/shRNA was a ubiquitous phenomenon and resulted from short stretches of sequence complementary to the siRNA/shRNA seed region. Perhaps, according to these findings, there are some short stretches (<7 nt) complementary to TGEV RNA genome within the non-specific sequence (T) accounting for the non-specific inhibition; therefore, employing both a non-specific sequence and a heterologous virus as the negative control in a RNAi experiment may be a good idea [The porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) CV777 strain was ever employed as a negative control in our study, and the poor inhibition of PEDV replication triggered by pEGFP-U6/P1 and pEGFP-U6/P2 indicated that shRNAs expressed from the two plasmids were TGEV specific (data not shown).]. Based on dosedependent analyses, Liu et al. (2006) and Lu et al. (2006) found that, similar to sequence-specific inhibition, the non-specific effect also had a positive correlation with the concentration of shRNAs. In addition, during both dose-dependent and CPE analysis, we found that cell toxicity was dose-dependent, too. As the images shown in Fig. 1 , when the amount of transfected plasmids reached 0.4 g/well, cell morphology began to change and little more dead cells emerged in cultures in contrast to non-treated cells. As Couzin (2006) reported, the cell toxicity increased with the dose of plasmids increasing. Taken together, there may also be a correlation between cell toxicity and inhibition effect (both sequence-specific and non-specific) (Couzin, 2006; Fedorov et al., 2006) . Anyway, compared to the slight non-specific effect, two sequencespecific shRNAs exhibited potent ability in silencing TGEV RNAs.",

Whether the technology could be employed in vivo, in anti-TGEV therapy is still under investigation.",
