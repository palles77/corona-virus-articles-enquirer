The reported confirmed, recovered and death cases were used to build initial models for Wuhan, Hubei and other provinces. Since there could be considerable under-reporting bias in the epicenter for lots of reasons. We assumed that the cases reported by other provinces were more accurate. Therefore, the model built on the cases reported by other provinces could estimate more accurately the number of infections. The reproductive number, infectious period and mean latent of models built for Wuhan and Hubei should be revised based on the latently infected individuals. The number of latently infected individuals in Wuhan before Jan 23 was estimated by the latently infected ratio and the daily population migration data from Wuhan to the rest of China. In the revised models of Wuhan and Hubei, parameters involving social distancing measures such as the removed rate, the decline factor of the reproductive number and the isolating ratio of susceptible individuals inherited from the initial models. The daily latent infected ratio is calculated based on the daily number of exposed individuals in Wuhan and the daily susceptible population size. Through the daily latent infected ratio and the daily number of individuals leaving Wuhan, the daily number of exposed individuals exported to Hubei and other provinces can be estimated.",

In other provinces, the estimated average base reproductive number r0 was 2.52 (95%-CI: 2.43~2.63), and with 30-day interventions, r0 was reduced to 1.65 (95%-CI: 1.63~1.69). The estimated infectious period TI was 2.26 days (95%-CI: 2.14~2.39) in Wuhan and Hubei, and was 3.75 days (95%-CI: 3.43~4.13) in other provinces. The estimated mean latent was 10.1 days (95%-CI: 8.82~11.78) in Wuhan and Hubei, and was 11.01 days (95%-CI: 9.51~13.06) in other provinces. The estimated removed rate was 0.0125 (95%-CI: 0.008~0.017) in Wuhan, 0.0175 (95%-CI: 0.0126~0.0224) in .

The results of virtual experiments vary. Some research suggested social distancing is effective, under the condition of early activation and long-lasting implement of combined measures [8] , strict implement [6, 9] , and spontaneously adopted [10] ; some concluded the effectiveness was mild [11] ; some argued that moderate social distancing can worsen the disease outcome, [6, 9] But real-world studies are rare. Here we quantified the impact of social distancing on the epidemic size in the real world, providing evidence that social distancing is effective to interrupt the transmission of the respiratory pathogen, especially with early implementation and to a substantial extent. Activating social distancing at the possible earliest time in the epicenter could gain time for the preparation of regions out of epicenter, and reduce wide range socioeconomic impact.",

Further investigation suggested that the influences of epicenter lockdown on epidemic size and death differed between Wuhan and non-Wuhan regions. Earlier lockdown of Wuhan would deteriorate the situation in situ, but would largely lower the infection number in the rest of Hubei province and other provinces. The reasons may be as follows. After lockdown, a portion of the infected and the latently infected (the exposed in the model) would accumulate in Wuhan instead of exporting outside. Theoretically, it would not change the total infection or death number, but we found the conversion rate from the close contacts to the exposed is much higher in Wuhan than in other provinces, as listed in table S1 of Supplement Material, so is the death rate. Quickly surging infected patients in Wuhan exerted extraordinary pressure on local healthcare systems, resulting in an acute shortage of medical resources and healthcare workers. Then the fast-growing infection and resource shortage fueled each other in a vicious cycle. Numerous close contacts could not be quarantined for medical observation.",

These provincial regions had a large inflow of people from Wuhan, and had a high local population density. So there were more imported cases, and easy to trigger widespread local transmission. For those regions with little people flow from the epicenter and with a population of low density, it could be possible that reinforced quarantine management without stringent social distancing could be effective enough to interrupt local transmission. An extreme example is that there was only one COVID-19 case in Tibet Autonomous Region of China, and the one was an imported case from Wuhan. He was timely quarantined for treatment and discharged after recovery. 23 close contacts were quickly traced and quarantined for medical observation, and then ruled out of infection.

We investigated the estimated epidemic size when social distancing activated on different dates in different areas and at different strength levels in Figure 2. The results in Figure 2 (a) demonstrated that earlier intervention of social distancing in Wuhan could reduce the number of infections, but was not significant enough. Earlier intervention simultaneously in Wuhan and Hubei could further reduce the epidemic size. Activating at earlies time in Wuhan could allow Hubei activated later with an acceptable compromise. In Figure 2 (b), earlier intervention in other provinces could reinforce the effect of earlier intervention in Wuhan and Hubei. In order to control the epidemic size smaller than that of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in mainland China 2003 (5,779), social distancing should be activated simultaneously in Wuhan and Hubei on Jan 03, and in other provinces before Jan 15, or activated in Wuhan on Jan 03, in Hubei on Jan 6, and in other provinces before Jan 11. However, it could not be controlled smaller than the global size of the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) epidemic 2015 (2,269). Of note, if the social distancing inHubei lagged behind Wuhan for more than two weeks, the earlier intervention in other provinces could barely affect the epidemic size in China.Figure 2(c) showed that, without social distancing (0*\u03bb0), the infection number would be remarkably increased than the current epidemic estimation. Earlier activation of social distancing at low strength level (0.25*\u03bb0) could be a bit better, but may eventually, maybe after Apr 1, enlarge the epidemic size. Earlier activation of social distancing at a moderate level (0.50*\u03bb0 and 0.75*\u03bb0) would be effective.",

MERS-global death: the global death number of MERS 2015, that is 431. We next investigated the impact of earlier epidemic lockdown on the estimated epidemic size and the number of deaths in Figure 3. The number of deaths was estimated by the number of infections multiplied with the current death rate in Wuhan, Hubei and other provinces (i.e. 4.43%, 3.09% and 0.835%). Unexpectedly, we found that the significant decrease of the nationwide epidemic size and death number by earlier social distancing would be partially neutralized by earlier epicenter lockdown (Figure 3a). With earlier social distancing in three different timings, the later of the lockdown, the smaller of the nationwide epidemic size and the less number of deaths there would be. This tendency is especially remarkable when social distancing was activated at the earliest time. With most strategies discussed here, the death number of COVID-19 could be controlled less than that of SARS in mainland China (829). Earlier social distancing without earlier lockdown could control the death number less than the global death number of MERS 2015 (431). Further investigation suggested that earlier epicenter lockdown would increase the number of infections and deaths in the epicenter Wuhan, while reducing the number of infections and deaths in the rest of Hubei and other provinces. To put it more intuitively, we illustrated the estimated epidemic size and number of deaths in Wuhan, Hubei and other provinces with the optional strategies compared with the current strategy in Figure 4. Figure 4 (a) showed the estimated epidemic controlled with two of the theoretically best strategies in terms of minimizing the nationwide epidemic size and death (left column, epidemic lockdown on Jan 23 while social distancing activated in the whole nation simultaneously on Jan 03), and in terms of minimizing the epidemic outside the epicenter (right column, epidemic lockdown on Jan 03 while social distancing activated in the whole nation simultaneously on Jan 03). Figure 4 (b) showed the effects with two of the practically optional strategies aiming to minimize the nationwide epidemic size and death (left column, epidemic lockdown on Jan 23 while social distancing activated in Wuhan on Jan 03, in Hubei on Jan 06, in other provinces on Jan 11), and aiming to minimize the epidemic outside the epicenter (right column, epidemic lockdown on Jan 03 while social distancing activated in Wuhan on Jan 03, in Hubei on Jan 06, in other provinces on Jan 11).

            "text": "the prevention and control of the COVID-19 epidemic, there are several questions concerning the effect of non-pharmaceutical interventions of social distancing and epicenter lockdown need to be addressed. We developed a data-driven SEIQR model of the COVID-19 epidemic in Wuhan, Hubei Province, and other provinces in China to investigate these questions.The first question to be addressed is the timing to implement social distancing in the epicenter city, in other parts of the province, and the rest of the nation respectively. Our results showed that early intervention of social distancing could reduce the epidemic size significantly, especially synchronizing the intervention nation-widely at the possible earliest time. However, in such a large country like China, nationwide implementation of rigorous social distancing measures would bring profound socioeconomic influence. A stepwise intervention of social distancing as early as possible in the epicenter city, then in the province and later the whole nation would be more cost-effective.The second question is the necessity to adopt social distancing to such a substantial extent. The intervention of social distancing in China was implemented in an all-of-Government and all-of-society manner. The specific measures were unprecedented comprehensive and rigorous, including but not limited to canceling gatherings, reducing public transportation, adopting enclosed community management, suspending work and school classes. Meanwhile, the socioeconomic cost was tremendous. Besides, these measures may be not universally practical in other countries. So we evaluated the impact of abolishing or reducing the extent of social distancing on the epidemic size. We found that moderate social distancing would remarkable attenuate its effect, while abolishing social distancing would leading to epidemic escalating.The effectiveness of social distancing on epidemic control is still under academic debate.",

On the other hand, under the circumstances of nation-wide substantial social distancing, there were no such intense pressures on the healthcare systems out of Wuhan, so the conversion rate and death rate were much lower than those in Wuhan. Thus locking the epicenter down later, or even abolishing the lockdown, could reduce the infection density and the pressure of healthcare systems in the epicenter, and decrease the epidemic size and death to some extent.The price is that the epidemic size in the rest of the nation would be relatively larger than early lockdown, and the nationwide socioeconomic impact would be deepened. So it turns out to be a controversial issue to determine which option should be taken. To minimize the epidemic size and death, the epicenter city should not be locked down. To confine the epidemic distribution and mitigate the impact on nationwide socio-economy, the epicenter lockdown should be taken earlier.There is little literature available concerning the impact of epicenter lockdown on the epidemic dynamics. Our results suggested a heterogeneous effect of epicenter lockdown on the epidemic size, death and localization. This founding could be partially evidenced by the epidemic prevalence on the Diamond Princess Cruise Ship. After COVID-19 appeared on the cruise ship, the whole ship was put on lockdown. A total of 3,711 passengers and crew were quarantined on the ship for 16-28 days. As of Mar 03, 2020, there were 706 infections and 6 death reported. The infection rate is up to 19%, and the death rate of 0.16%. The ship lockdown prevented epidemic spreading out, at the heavy price of within ship outbreak with an astonishingly high infection rate. The question then arises which aim should take the priority, minimizing the epidemic size and death, or better confining the prevalence to the origin region from spreading out. In addition, epidemics do more than cause death and debilitation. The regional socioeconomic damage after lockdown and the extensive socioeconomic impact of a nationwide spreading epidemic will further complicate the decision. This finding highlight the importance of careful evaluation and contemplation on the impact of epicenter lockdown from all side.Taken together, the theoretically best strategy to minimize epidemic size and death is simultaneously activating nationwide substantial social distancing at the possible earliest time while abolishing epicenter lockdown. Alternatively, the ideal strategy to confine the epidemic within Hubei Province to the most extent is simultaneously activating both nationwide social distancing and epicenter lockdown at the possible earliest time. Practically, a stepwise implement of social distancing in Wuhan, Hubei and the rest of the nation would be more cost-effective.",
