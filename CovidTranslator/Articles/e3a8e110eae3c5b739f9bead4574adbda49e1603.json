Due to their ability to bind the targets with high specificity and affinity as well as near absence of non-mechanism toxicity due to off-target binding (3), mAbbased drugs offer attractive advantages over the small molecule therapeutics. On the other hand, these biotherapeutic drugs possess complex and conformationally heterogeneous molecular structures that are vulnerable to the changes in their environments and themselves. A complex series of processing steps between production to administration results in several physico-chemical stresses on the molecules (4). These stresses include high concentrations, variable temperatures, pH extremes, varying ionic strengths, shear stresses, and air-water as well as a variety of solid-liquid interfaces. As a result, potency and purity of the final drug product is impacted via multiple degradation pathways (5) . Hence, there is considerable interest in the biopharmaceutical industry towards gaining fundamental understanding of the molecular properties that determine chemical, thermodynamic and long-term stability of biotherapeutic molecules.",

The molecular trigger for these aggregates is the generation of the cross-\u03b2 motif whose molecular structure was recently elucidated by Eisenberg lab (14, 15 ). Formation of cross-\u03b2 motif and amyloid-like aggregates in proteins is quite common. From a survey of the literature, we have found that experimental evidence is available for more than seventy different proteins showing aggregation via formation of the cross-\u03b2 steric zipper motif (16) , and even proteins in bacterial inclusion bodies can aggregate via this route (17) . Short sequence regions that potentially drive aggregation have been detected in these proteins. These are called aggregation prone regions (APRs) (18) . Typically, these APRs have unique features with respect to charge, hydrophobicity, aromaticity and secondary structural preference. A number of computational approaches have been developed to predict potential APRs in proteins (16) . Most of these prediction methods use only the protein sequences as input to identify short APRs of 5-9 residues capable of forming amyloid-like fibrils (19) . Other methods based on pattern recognition, three-dimensional profiles and molecular simulations are emerging (20) (21) (22) (23) (24) (25) (26) .",

The solvent-accessible surface area buried upon Fab-antigen complex formation is used as a parameter to gauge Fab-antigen interaction and the contribution of the potential APRs towards antigen recognition. In literature, protein-protein interactions have been commonly measured using approaches that rely on energetics (32, 33) or contact residues (34) and the buried surface area (35) at the interfaces. The two approaches are closely related. In this study, we preferred to use buried surface area as a metric because it can be easily calculated.

Hence, we find that potential APRs may contribute significantly towards antigen binding. The aromatic residues, Tyr and Trp, occur with high propensities in both APRs and antigen binding sites. Incidence of APRs is not uniform in all CDR loops. In particular, APRs are less frequent in the heavy chain CDR 3 (H3) loops. On the other hand, APRs are found with the greatest frequencies in the heavy chain CDR 2 (H2) loops. Rational structure-based design strategies for therapeutic antibody candidates with both high potency and improved druggability are proposed.",

(c) The complex has full Fab structure; complexes with Fv or single chain of antibody are not included. (d) The antibody sequences contained in complexes are non-redundant. This last criterion was hard to meet because the antibody sequences show high homologies when both variable and constant regions are included in the alignments. We retained one complex with best resolution from a set of complexes where both light chains and heavy chains of the Fabs showed greater than 90% sequence identity. The choice of 90% sequence identity is arbitrary. The average sequence identities for variable regions of Fab light and heavy chains in the final dataset are 60% and 55%, respectively.

Amino acid residues from CDR-localized APRs contribute towards antigen binding in 28 out of 29 Fab-antigen complexes in our dataset. The percentage contributions are shown in Table II (column 5) . On average, 16.0\u00b110.7% (range: 0-42.7%) of buried surface area of Fabs can be attributed to APRs. The variation is large. For example, in case of the murine antibody Fab-protein A complex (PDB ID: 1OSP), the variable domain contains only one APR which falls in H3 loop but does not participate in antigen binding. In the case of the VEFG-blocking Fab-Neuropilin-1 complex (PDB ID: 2QQN), the contribution of APRs is the highest (42.7%). APRs contribute more than 10% to buried surface area of Fab in 20 out of the 29 complexes (69%). Among commercial antibodies, with the exception of the neutralizing Fab-VEGF complex (PDB ID: 1BJ1), APRs account for greater than 15% of buried surface area of Fab. Fig. 3 shows, as an example, the structure of the IGG RU5 Fab-Von Willebrand factor complex (PDB ID: 1FE8). In this case, 29.8% of buried surface area in Fab is attributed to binding residues that belong to APRs.

Polar surface area calculated in this study consists of the buried surface areas from both neutral polar and charged atoms. On average, the Fab part of interface is 56\u00b17% polar. This value is similar to an earlier average value (49%) for antibody-antigen interfaces (35) . The electrostatic and polar interactions have been known to be important factors in determining affinity and specificity of antibody-antigen complexes (47, 48) . The APRs considered in the Fig. 4b are those found in the antigen-binding regions of Fabs. The average polar fraction of buried surface area of APRs is 55\u00b119% (range 9-93%) after excluding two outliers described below. This value is similar to that for Fabs. However, the variation is now wider. In case of murine antibody Fab-Protein A complex (Complex 9), the polar fraction for this complex is not available because none of the APRs contribute to the buried surface areas. For the Fab NMC4-Von Willebrand factor complex (Complex 2), the buried surface area of the APRs comes from only one binding residue (E92), which is hydrophilic, leading to 100% polar fraction. In four out of the five commercial Fab-antigen complexes, the APRs show greater than 50% polar fraction. Table III lists the antigen-binding residues of Fabs. The binding residues that also belong to APRs are highlighted in bold (Table III) . The buried surface areas contributed by these binding residues are unequal. The binding residues are primarily located in CDR loops, with a few of them in the framework regions (FRs). Y49 in light chains is identified as a binding site residue in a few complexes. It immediately precedes L2 loops and, technically, falls in FR2. However, we pooled this residue with those in L2 in our analysis. Several residues in CDRs loops do not participate in antigen binding (Table IV) . However, these non-binding residues may help CDR loops acquire the proper backbone conformations essential for binding (49) . Fig. 5a and b compare the propensity of individual amino acid to occur in antigen-binding sites and in APRs in our dataset. Residues with propensity values above one are favored, while those with propensity values below one are disfavored. Our results are in general agreement with previous analysis on antibody-antigen interface (32, 35) . For example, Trp, Tyr and Arg, favored at antigen-binding sites in our analysis (Fig. 5a) , are also the hot-spot residues for protein interfaces (50) .",

The buried surface area values are very similar to those obtained by Wilson and Stanfield (1994) (53) . On average, H3 loops contribute the most towards antigen binding (25\u00b113.8%, Table IV ). The portion of residues that directly contact antigens is also the greatest (48%) for H3 loops. If the average buried surface area contribution for each loop is normalized by number of binding residues in the loop, H3 loops again have the greatest contribution (5.3% per residue).

The average buried surface area contribution by L3 loops is the third largest (17.3\u00b18.6%). Taken together, these three loops, namely, H3, H2 and L3, contribute approximately two-thirds (65.8\u00b117.7%, range: 19-100%) of the buried surface area of the Fabs. The shortest CDR loops, L2, also contribute the least (7.4\u00b1 7.5%, Table IV ). In fact, these loops do not contribute towards the buried surface area of Fabs in seven (24%) complexes in our dataset ( Fig. 6 and Table III ). The overall a Percent contribution towards buried surface area by the binding residues in Fab which also belong to APRs contribution of the CDR loops in heavy chain (CDR loops: H1+H2+H3) towards buried surface area of Fab is 60.7\u00b1 11.3% (range 43-86%). Only in 6 out of 29 (approximately 21%) complexes, the heavy chain CDR loops contribute less than 50%. We have also counted the numbers of hydrogen bonds and ion pairs between Fab and antigen to study the specific interactions at Fab-antigen interfaces (Table IV) . On average, the trend is the same. H2, H3 and L3 loops again make the greatest number of hydrogen bond and ion pair contacts with the antigens. Fig. 6 (b) plots the frequency of coincidence of APRs and binding residues in CDR loops. These values estimate the potential coupling between aggregation and antigen recognition for each CDR loop. Residues in APRs are also among the antigen-binding residues in CDR loops with an average frequency of 29.3\u00b112.5%. The two most important antigenbinding contributors, H2 and H3, show very different aggregation coupling frequencies. H2 loop has the highest APR incidence (44.8%), while H3 loop shows the lowest incidence (6.9%). The coincidences of APRs and binding residues in other CDR loops, L1, L2, L3 and H1, are similar (31.0\u00b12.8%).",

In our previous work, we found that commercially available therapeutic mAbs contain short APRs similar to those seen in the amyloidogenic proteins (30) . Interestingly, some of the potential APRs in mAbs overlapped with the CDR regions. However, that study could not tell if the APRs localized in the CDRs in those mAbs actually contributed to antigen recognition also. Present survey shows that CDR-localized potential APRs contribute significantly towards antigen recognition. This suggests the possibility of linkage between aggregation and loss of function in antibody-based therapeutics. This link is undesirable from the pharmaceutical point of view because therapeutic mAb drug substances as well as products are stored without their cognate antigens over long periods of time.",

            "text": "Computational approaches towards identification of potential APRs utilize sequence (19, 28, 29, 59, 60) and structural (21) methods. In numerous instances, these predictions have been experimentally validated and used to design peptides and proteins with lower aggregation propensities (61, 62) . The sequence-based approaches have similar levels of accuracy as 3D profile-based ones (16) . The sequence-based approaches are faster and require less computational resources as compared to the structural ones. These can be very useful in early discovery stage, where a large number of sequences are screened for potential leads. TANGO and PAGE are two such computational programs that require only the protein sequence as input. The prediction from TANGO relies on physicochemical rules behind \u03b2-sheet formation and assumes that the core of the aggregates is completely desolvated (28) . It also takes into account the competition between other conformational states, such as \u03b1-helix, \u03b2strand, turn, random coil and \u03b2-aggregates for the given sequence region. PAGE computes the aggregation propensity based on aromaticity, \u03b2-strand propensity, charge, solubility and hydrophobicity of the residues in window of 5-9 residues along the sequence (29) . Both TANGO and PAGE have been used on a large number of peptides and small proteins and show high prediction accuracies. TANGO was found be more than 92% accurate in experimental validation studies (28) . TANGO has also been used extensively by other groups (62) (63) (64) (65) (66) . We used more than one program to identify APRs so that our results are not influenced by peculiarities of training sets and algorithms used. We noted good overlap between APRs of type 1 and type 2, indicating the general agreement between the two programs. Molecular simulation techniques have also been used to study aggregation (22, 23, 25, 26, (67) (68) (69) . This approach was recently applied to full-length antibody by (23, 24) . They have developed a technique named spatial-aggregation-propensity (SAP). SAP uses residue hydrophobicity and dynamical conformations collected from simulations to identify surface exposed hydrophobic patches. This concept is similar to the surface aggregation propensity used by Pechmann et al. (2009) (57) . These surface-exposed hydrophobic patches can act as structural hot-spots for aggregation. These patches look for non-polar residues in close spatial vicinity on protein surfaces. The spatially vicinal residues do not have to be contiguous in amino acid sequence. Moreover, these surface patches are not necessarily potential cross \u03b2-aggregation sites. Hence, they are different from the cross \u03b2-motif-forming APRs identified by the sequence-based approaches. However, APRs also often contain hydrophobic \u03b2-branched aliphatic and aromatic residues. Hence, the APRs may overlap with the surface hydrophobic patches but not be completely equivalent to them. APRs can also be significantly polar, especially those containing Asn and Gln residues. The examples include yeast prion proteins sup35 and Ure2p and several neurodegenerative diseases, like Huntington's disease (15, (70) (71) (72) . In the Fabs of our dataset, the APRs in L3 loops are polar (Fig. 2a) . Overall, the APR and SAP approaches are complementary to each other.",

In particular, we cite three examples because of good agreement between the experiments and computational predictions. These are bovine growth hormone (74) , amyloidogenic immunoglobulin light chain (75) and a human IgG1 mAb (23, 24) . We summarize our findings below; the details of these cases are presented in Supplementary Material. First, based on the experimental studies, Lehrman et al. have identified a sequence region 109-133 in bovine growth hormone (bGH) to be involved in aggregation (74) . Our TANGO and PAGE analyses indicate the presence of APRs in this region (119-GILALM-124). The experimentally designed variants 8H-bGH and human growth hormone (hGH) differ in the sequence region 109-133 and show reduced aggregation propensity in the experiments of Lehrman et al. (74) . Consistent with this observation, TANGO/PAGE spectra do not indicate an APR in this region for 8H-bGh and hGH. Second, Baden et al. (2008) have identified three non-conserved somatic mutations, I34N, Q42K and H87Y, which restore amyloido-genic immunoglobulin light chain AL-09 to its germline sequence \u03baIO18/O8 (75) . TANGO spectrum of AL-09 indicates a very strong APR containing I34 (32-YLIWY-36, TANGO aggregation score \u223c90%). The PAGE spectrum shows an APR containing H87 (87-HCQQY-91). Both TANGO and PAGE did not find an APR involving the residues at the position 42. The corresponding TANGO spectra for both the germline sequence \u03baIO18/O8 and the AL-09 mutants with reduced aggregation propensity indicate that APR 32-YLIWY-36 is substantially weakened for the germ line light chain due to the somatic disruption at position 34. However, APR 87-HCQQY-91 identified by PAGE remained unchanged. Third, L309K mutation in the C H 2 domain of intact IgG1 mAb studied by Chennamsetty et al. (2009) reduces its aggregation propensity as shown by turbidity and HPLC assays and improves its stability in DSC experiments (see Table I and Fig. 3 in Ref. 24) (24). This mutation actually disrupts a strong APR (302-VVSVLTVL-309) (TANGO aggregation score \u223c90%) found in the Fc regions of IgG mAbs. This APR is well conserved among immunoglobulin Gs and was documented earlier (30) . In all three cases, both TANGO and PAGE also detected additional APRs that were common between the proteins and their variants, indicating the potential for further reduction in aggregation propensities of the molecules.",

This may help improve expression levels in cell lines, facilitate high concentration dosage forms and increase shelf-life of the product. However, developability-related sequence mutations should not adversely impact the potency of the therapeutic mAbs. In this regard, the observed incidence of potential APRs in the CDR loops and adjacent framework \u03b2-strands is significant. Disruption of these APRs without affecting therapeutic mAb potency could be difficult and time-consuming without a rational approach.

Molecular models, crystal structures of Fab-antigen complexes and Alanine scanning experiments may help identify such binding hotspot residues. Mutations affecting these residues should be avoided to preserve potency. On average, CDR loops H3, H2 and L3 contribute the most towards antigen recognition. H3 loops do contain fewer APRs, but this is not the case for H2 and L3 loops. While different binding site residues contribute unequally towards antigen recognition, there is still some risk that mutations in these loops could also impact potency of the mAb candidates. This is especially true at early discovery stages where Fab-antigen complex crystal structures are not yet available, antigen-binding residues are not well identified, and project time-lines are tight. On the other hand, L2 loops contribute the least towards antigen binding but often contain APRs (Fig. 6) . Mutations aimed at disrupting the APRs in this region could help improve mAb stability without significantly impacting potency. Apart from L2 loops, L1 and H1 loops are the other regions where disruption of potential APRs can reduce mAb aggregation tendency and not impact the potency substantially.",
