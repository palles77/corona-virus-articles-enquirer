Apart from presenting antigens to T cells, DCs carry out many other functions in regulating immunity. DC-specific intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-3 grabbing non-integrin (DC-SIGN) is a novel receptor that plays an important role in DC migration and adhesion, the inflammatory response, T cell activation, initiating the immune response, and immune escape of pathogens and tumors. DC-SIGN mediates DC binding to ICAM-3 on the T cell surface and ICAM-2 on the endothelial cell (EC) surface, and takes part in the initial interaction between DC and T cells or vascular ECs. The procedure of systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX) is a method in which single-stranded oligonucleotides are selected from a wide variety of sequences, based on their interaction with a target molecule. In this study, we selected DNA aptamers against DC-SIGN protein by SE-LEX, and measured their binding affinity for DC-SIGN. Finally, an appropriate aptamer with high affinity for DC-SIGN was obtained, and it blocked DC adhesion to ECs as effectively as anti-DC-SIGN monoclonal antibody.",

The SELEX method has permitted the identification of unique RNA/DNA molecules from very large populations of random sequence oligomers (DNA or RNA libraries), and they bind to the target molecule with high affinity and specificity. Aptamers show a very high affinity for their targets, with dissociation constants typically from the micromolar to the low picomolar range, comparable to and sometimes even better than those of some monoclonal antibodies [8] .",

            "text": "In comparison to antibodies, aptamer receptors have a number of advantages that make them very promising for analytical and diagnostic applications. The main advantage is overcoming the problem of using animals for their production. Aptamers are isolated by in vitro methods that do not require animals: an in vitro combinatorial library can be generated against any target. Moreover, the aptamer selection process can be manipulated to obtain aptamers that bind a specific region of the target, with specific binding properties in different binding conditions. After selection, aptamers are produced by chemical synthesis and purified to a very high degree by eliminating the batch-bybatch variation found when using antibodies and, by chemical synthesis, modifications in the aptamer can be introduced to enhance the stability, affinity, and specificity of the molecule. Finally, because of their simple structure, sensor layers based on aptamers can be regenerated more easily than antibody-based layers, are more resistant to denaturation and have a much longer shelf life. Moreover, the selection process itself, with the amplification step, gives advantages to aptamers with respect to other ''nonnatural'' receptors, such as oligopeptides, which cannot be amplified during their selection procedure. Due to all these characteristics, aptamers have been used in numerous investigations, as therapeutic [9] or diagnostic tools [10] and for the development of new drugs.",

Both maturation and migration of DCs are orchestrated carefully by panoplies of chemokines and adhesion molecules. Adhesion molecules are crucial for all cellular interactions of the DC during its journey from bone marrow into blood, from blood into the peripheral tissues and subsequently into lymphoid tissues. Recently, many new cell-surface molecules on DCs have been identified, and these may contribute to DC functions in controlling innate, as well as adaptive immunity. In particular, a large diversity of Ctype lectins have been identified on DCs; some of these regulate pathogen recognition, while others regulate signaling or cellular interactions, such as DC migration and T cell binding. Several years ago, Geijtenbeek and his coworkers identified DC-specific ICAM-3 grabbing non-integrin (DC-SIGN), a novel adhesion receptor on human DCs that is essential in several key functions throughout the DC lifecycle [12] , especially in the interactions between DCs and T cells or vascular endothelial cells (ECs).",

A fundamental aspect of DC function in controlling immunity is the capacity to provide continuous surveillance for incoming foreign antigens and a prompt response to present the encountered antigens to T cells [11, 19] . Adhesion and migration are essential to this process because DCs have to travel from their ''nursery'' to the inflamed tissue, where they capture antigen, and subsequently to the lymph nodes, where T cells reside [20] . Cell-cell interactions between DCs and T cells or ECs are strictly coordinated events, regulated by chemokines and cytokines, together with the expression of adhesion molecules on DCs, T cells, and ECs. DC-SIGN, a novel DC-specific adhesion receptor, binds with high affinity to the intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-2 on ECs and ICAM-3 on T cells [12, 21] . DC-SIGN-mediated migration of precursor and immature DCs from blood into peripheral tissues involves four steps: (1) DC rolling, (2) rapid activation of DCs, (3) adhesion to endothelial ligands through activated integrins, and (4) diapedesis [22] . The interaction of DCs with the ECs lining the blood vessels is an important control point in egress. Besides having a function in the rolling of DCs along the blood vessel lining, DC-SIGN also mediates the adhesion of DCs to endothelium via ICAM-2 and their subsequent transendothelial migration.",

While it is not practical to create comprehensive libraries, large libraries do increase the probability that high-affinity ligands will be present. We constructed a DNA oligonucleotide library containing a 35-base central random sequence, and selected for ssDNA binding to DC-SIGN protein by using a microwell plate screening technique, PCR and biotinstreptavidin magnesphere separation during the SELEX process. After 11 rounds of selection, we cloned, purified, and sequenced the PCR products, and obtained 21 DNA aptamers against DC-SIGN. Although there were few consensus regions among all the sequences, more consensus regions were found by comparisons in subgroups.
