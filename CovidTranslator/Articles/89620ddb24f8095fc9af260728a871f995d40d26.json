Methods: We evaluated the comparative utility of digital camera versus film digitizer in capturing chest radiographs in a pneumonia surveillance system in rural Thailand using a panel of radiologists; the gold standard was the hard-copy radiograph. We calculated sensitivity and specificity and conducted a receiver operator characteristics (ROC) analysis. Results: Of the 192 radiographs from patients with clinical pneumonia, 166 (86%) were classified as pneumonia on the hard copies. Sensitivity and specificity for identifying pneumonia were 89% and 73% for the camera and 90% and 65% for the digitizer. In the ROC analysis, there was no statistically significant difference in the area under the curve (camera, 0.86; film digitizer, 0.91, p = 0.29).

The 3-fold lower cost of the digital Introduction Pneumonia is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. 1, 2 However, there are few inexpensive and uniformly effective tools to aid in its clinical identification as well as in the investigation of its etiology. [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] Chest radiographs are recommended for the routine clinical evaluation of individual patients hospitalized with suspected pneumonia. 4, 10 In public health, they may also be used to quantify and refine estimates of the vaccinepreventable fraction of pneumonia; this approach is particularly useful when blood cultures are not routinely performed.",

However, the amount of disease reduction can also be used as an estimate of the burden of that disease in the population. For example, several vaccine trials for Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) demonstrated declines in radiographically confirmed pneumonia of 21% to 22% in the vaccinated group, suggesting that up to 22% of pneumonia may be attributable to Hib infection. 11, 12 More recently, vaccine trials of pneumococcal conjugate vaccines demonstrated declines in pneumonia with alveolar consolidation of 17-18% in the vaccinated group, suggesting that up to 18% of pneumonia with alveolar consolidation may be attributable to Streptococcus pneumoniae infection. 13, 14 If the incidence of radiographically confirmed pneumonia, or pneumonia with alveolar consolidation, is known, then the vaccine preventable fraction of Hib or S. pneumoniae can be estimated.

The digital images, camera and digitizer combined, were randomized and read; after a delay of two weeks, the 192 hard copies were read. A panel of board-certified radiologists in Bangkok reviewed the radiographs. Two primary radiologists reviewed all and a third reviewed images only when there were discrepancies between the results of the first two with respect to the key indicators of possible pneumonia, alveolar infiltrate, or interstitial infiltrate. The final interpretation was based on the first two readers, if in agreement, or on agreement between a primary reader and the third reader, if there were discrepancies between the first two readers. Each film was read independently and the reviewers were discouraged from re-reviewing images; reviewers were blinded to each other's readings. The only information available was age and sex of the patient, patient positioning if known, and a centimeter marker for film size. In addition, readers were aware that the images were from patients suspected of having pneumonia. Digital images were loaded onto a Vepro DICOM Archive and Viewing Station, Model ADAS-DVD, using MEDIMAGE software (Vepro GmbH, Pfungstadt Germany) and viewed on 19-inch cathode ray tube dual display monitors with dot pitch of 0.26 mm and maximum resolution of 1920 \u00c2 1440 pixels.

Pneumonia was categorized into those with any alveolar consolidation, interstitial infiltrates only, and other evidence of pneumonia. To generate a receiver operator characteristics (ROC) curve, the radiologists were asked how clear the finding for pneumonia was on a 6-point scale: 1 = definitely pneumonia, 2 = probably pneumonia, 3 = possibly pneumonia, 4 = possibly not pneumonia, 5 = probably not pneumonia, 6 = definitely not pneumonia.",

Our study suggests that in the ability to detect pneumonia, the digital camera and film digitizer performed well compared to the hard copy, and were similar to each other. The ROC curve demonstrated a marginally superior ability to detect pneumonia with the film digitizer versus the digital camera, although the difference was not statistically significant. This finding likely reflects major improvements in digital camera technology. Furthermore, the cost of the digital camera set was one third that of the film digitizer. Overall, our data suggest that for the purposes of pneumonia surveillance in Thailand, use of a digital camera is a cost-effective and practical alternative to a film digitizer. Chest radiographs can play an important role in surveillance by providing population-based information that can be used to refine estimates of the burden of specific pathogens, such as Hib, S. pneumoniae, or the influenza virus. [11] [12] [13] [14] This is particularly important in developing countries that lack the laboratory capability to accurately diagnose pathogens. In rural Thailand, blood cultures are performed on approximately 5% of patients with suspected pneumonia and the capability for viral culture does not exist. Disease burden estimates of vaccine-preventable diseases in developing countries are urgently needed to guide important health policy decisions.",

The camera used in this study was 3.3 mega pixels, a common resolution in digital cameras on the market at the time of the study. The 2004 cost of a similar resolution digital camera and tripod used in this study would be less than $500, half what we paid, a 6-fold lower cost compared to the scanner.",

[38] [39] [40] The inter-observer agreement for atelectasis was only fair, suggesting that some outcomes are open to a broader interpretation between radiologists. Although there was only moderate agreement between our readers on pneumonia, our findings are consistent with a recent study that compared chest radiograph interpretations of pneumonia by radiologists from patients with lower respiratory tract infections (Kappa = 0.53, 95% confidence interval = 0.37-0.69). 40 In another study, agreement between two readers examining chest radiographs from persons with community-acquired pneumonia was low for the finding of infiltrates (Kappa = 0.37, 95% confidence interval = 0.22-0.52). 38 In our study, the same radiology panel read the original images and the digital films, introducing the possibility of reader bias through memory recall. Readers might be more likely to record the same result the second time they saw an image and thus bias the results to the null (i.e., no difference). In order to minimize the memory recall effect we randomized the digital images and had them read the original films last since they are perceived as being the highest quality. In addition, there were several weeks between the digital and hard copy readings.",
