            "text": "Most viruses take advantage of cellular endocytic pathways to enter their host 60 cells (1, 2). Once internalized, virus particles move through a dynamic network of 61 endocytic vesicles, which undergoes gradual sorting and complex maturation events. 62 Endosome maturation, in turn, triggers conformational changes and dissociation 63 events in the incoming viruses, which ultimately lead to the delivery of the viral 64 genome and associated proteins into the cytoplasm. In general, while non-enveloped 6 (44); however, the endocytic pathway that IBV hijacks is unclear. 135 The early step in the entry process of IBV into target cells is initiated by 136 engagement of the S glycoprotein with the receptor. Here, using several cell lines 137 permissive to IBV Beaudette strain, we report that IBV virion attaches to lipid rafts in 138 the cell surface and the efficient entry of IBV into cells requires the presence of intact 139 lipid rafts. We also address IBV entry pathway by systematically perturbing the Inhibitors and antibodies.

The subtoxic dose of the M\u03b2CD in IBV 351 permissive cell lines was determined by a cell proliferation assay (Supplementary Fig. 352 1). After determination of subtoxic dose, Vero, H1299, Huh7 cells were treated with 5 353 mM M\u03b2CD for 30 min at pre-, during-, or post-IBV infection at -0.5, 0, 1, 2 h.p.i. 354 (Fig. 1A). The effect of M\u03b2CD on virus infection was accessed by checking viral 355 gRNA, viral protein, and progeny virus with semi-quantitative real time RT-PCR, genome level, which was determined by checking negative stranded genomic 359 RNA at 4 h.p.i.. Surprisingly, treatment with M\u03b2CD at 1 and 2 h.p.i. did not affect the 360 virus genome production. Next, viral N protein expression was analyzed with Western 361 blot at 8 h.p.i.. As shown in Fig. 1C, 1F, 1I, treatment with M\u03b2CD -1.5 and 0 h.p.i. 362 obtained maximum inhibition effect on viral N protein expression in various cell lines, 363 whereas treatment with M\u03b2CD at post-entry step did not affect the viral N protein 364 expression. In consistence, the progeny virus release was also inhibited by M\u03b2CD 365 treatment at -1.5 and 0 h.p.i., but not by post-entry treatment (Fig. 1D, 1G, 1J). In all, 366 above data demonstrate that M\u03b2CD inhibits virus entry step, but not post-entry 367 process, suggesting that intact lipid rafts are required for virus attachment and/or 368 entry. 369 To confirm whether the effect of the M\u03b2CD on virus entry was due to cholesterol 370 depletion, we examined the effect of exogenous cholesterol replenishment on virus 371 entry after M\u03b2CD treatment. Vero, H1299, and Huh7 cells were pretreated with 2.5 or 372 5 mM M\u03b2CD for 30 min, supplemented with/without exogenous 1 mM cholesterol for 373 1 h, followed with IBV infection. The incoming virus gRNA, the expression of IBV N 374 protein, and the progeny virus particles in the culture medium, were examined. The 375 incoming virus gRNA was examined with semi-quantitative real time RT-PCR at 2 376 h.p.i.. Results in Fig. 2A, 2D, 2G showed that M\u03b2CD treatment reduced virus gRNA 377 internalization, however, cholesterol replenishment restored virus entry. Accordingly, 378 virus protein expression was determined with Western blot at 8 h.p.i.. As shown in Fig. 379 2B, 2E, and 2H, compared to that in control treatment cells, viral N protein expression 380 was reduced by M\u03b2CD treatment and was restored in cholesterol replenishment cells.",

Microinjection of Eps15 487 antibody interfered with transferring and EGFR internalization (61), suggesting that 488 Eps15 plays an important role in CME. Several reviews described previously that the 489 expression of the C-terminal dominant negative form of Eps15-DN, which contains 490 the AP2-binding site, could efficiently block the uptake of Sindbis virus (62). 491 Dynamin1 is a GTPase facilitating membrane fission to generate endocytic vesicles in 492 CME and CavME (47, 63, 64).

The actin 544 cytoskeleton machinery is recruited after coat formation and provides an essential 545 force for membrane deformation and internalization (69). Recent studies have 546 revealed that the rhabdoviruses (70), VSV (7), RABV (71), and IHNV (72) are 547 internalized through CME and depend on actin. Although we have demonstrated that 548 IBV enter cells by hijacking clathrin dependent route, it is unclear whether actin 549 filaments are involved in IBV uptake. To examine the role of actin filaments in IBV 550 entry, we first examined the actin polymerization during IBV internalization. Vero 551 cells were incubated with IBV at 4\u2103 for 1 h, and the temperature was shifted to 37\u2103. 552 Actin filaments were stained with Alexa Fluor 488-phalloidin (green) and IBV N 553 antibody at 15 min time interval and were observed by confocal microscopy. In 554 mock-infected cells, the actin stress fibers were visible clearly. At 15 to 45 min.p.i., 555 the number of actin stress fibers dramatically decreased, the cells rounded up, and infection results in transient actin de-polymerization and re-arrangement. 559 IBV N protein antibody is not sensitive enough to detect the incoming virus. To check 560 whether of IBV internalization associates with actin, R18-IBV was applied to Vero 561 cell. Actin filaments were stained with Alexa Fluor 488-phalloidin at 15 min time 562 interval, and the red signal of R18-IBV and green signal of actin were observed. As 563 expected, images in Fig. 8B showed that there was no R18 red signal in mock 564 infection group. In the R18-IBV infection group, R18-IBV was detected at cell 565 surface at 0 min, displayed as red signal. After attachment, R18-IBV entered cells and 566 co-localized well with actin at 15, 30, and 45 min, shown as yellow signal. At 60 min, 567 Most R18-IBV particles separated with actin, displayed as red signal again. This 568 observation suggests that IBV enters cells via actin cytoskeleton. Here, we also 569 incubated the well characterized R18-VSV with Vero cells as control group. As 570 R18-VSV enters into cells quickly, we chose the time interval of 5 min. Image in 571 Supplementary Fig. 2A showed that R18-VSV also caused actin fiber 572 de-polymerization and cell rounded up at 5-30 min.p.i..

Vero cells were pretreated with either Jas or 581 CytoD in increasing concentrations before being infected with IBV. Cells were 582 harvested at indicated time points to measure IBV gRNA internalization or N 583 protein expression. Fig. 8C-D showed that when actin polymers were stabilized by Jas, 584 the IBV internalization and N protein expression were increased in a dose-dependent observation is self-contradictory and out of expectation. Thus, we use 588 the well characterized VSV as control to perform this experiment, ensuring the 589 inhibitors work. When the Jas or CytoD was applied to Vero cells before VSV 590 infection, both inhibitors reduced VSV G protein expression (Supplementary Fig. 2B, 591 C), consistent with previous report of actin dependent entry of VSV (73). These 592 results imply that the inhibitors indeed interfere with actin polymerization or 593 de-polymerization. The enhancement of IBV infection by these inhibitors is not the 594 only case, it has been reported that SFV infection was also enhanced by CytoD 595 pretreatment (78). In all, above results demonstrate that the binding of IBV to cell 596 surface causes actin de-polymerization and rearrangement, however, when the actin 597 de-polymerization and rearrangement are interfered by inhibitors, the virus entry is 598 enhanced. How do the inhibitors increase IBV entry? The underlying mechanisms are 599 unclear. 600 IBV moves across the entire endo-lysosomal system. 601 After identification of the endocytic pathway hijacked by IBV, we next tracked 602 the transport vesicles utilized by incoming IBV.

Cells were 606 subjected to immunostaining by using antibodies against early endosome marker 607 Rab5, late endosome marker Rab7, and lysosome marker LAMP1. Rab5 and Rab7 are 608 GTPases that are required for the movement of endocytosed cargo to early or late 609 endosomes (79, 80).

Furthermore, R18-IBV was found in 620 LAMP1 containing lysosomes at 3 h.p.i. (yellow dots with white arrow in fourth 621 panel). Previous study showed that VSV was internalized into early endosome in a 622 few minutes via CME (81). Thus, we used R18-VSV to perform above experiment in 623 Vero cells as control. As shown in Supplementary Fig. 3, R18-VSV co-localized well 624 with early endosome marker Rab5 at 5, 10, and 20 min.p.i. (yellow dots with white 625 arrows in second, third, and fourth panels). There was less co-image of R18-VSV 626 with Rab5 at 30 min.p.i. (fifth panel), indicating the R18-VSV leaves early 627 endosomes at this time point. Moreover, there was almost no co-image of R18-VSV 628 with Rab7/LAMP1 at 0-30 min. These observations verify that VSV enters early 629 endosome, but is not delivered into late endosome and lysosome, consistent with 630 previous study (73). In all, above results reveal that IBV enters early endosome at 631 around 1 h.p.i., passes through late endosome at around 2 h.p.i., and reaches lysosome 632 at 3 h.p.i.. 633 As IBV co-localized extensively with endo-lysosomal compartments, we asked 634 whether all these vehicles are really involved in IBV infectious route. To achieve this, 635 we took advantage of the fact that, in addition to providing organelle identity, Rab5 636 and Rab7 serve critical roles in regulation of cargo transport within the endosomal 637 system (82). Accordingly, dominant negative mutant of these proteins has been shown 638 to block cargo transport (83, 84).

As shown in Fig. 9B, all these proteins were successfully expressed. 645 Compared with GFP expressing group, expression of Rab5-WT, Rab5-CA, Rab7-WT, 646 and Rab7-CA has only minimal effect on the expression of IBV N, whereas 647 expression of Rab5-DN and Rab7-DN caused significantly reduction (0.1-fold) in 648",

Thus, characterization of 730 viral entry pathway is important for understanding of virus pathogenesis and design of 731 anti-viral drugs. Envelope viruses penetrate cells by two different ways: fusion with 732 cell plasma membrane or receptor-mediated endocytosis. Direct membrane fusion on 733 the cell surface is independent of low pH, and access through the endocytosis pathway 734 usually relies on the low pH of the endocytic vesicles. Different endocytosis pathways 735 have been characterized over the past decade, in which the CME is one of the most 736 commonly used by many envelope viruses (93). Coronavirus entry is mediated by S 737 protein, which is responsible for receptor binding and membrane fusion. Previously, it 738 has been demonstrated that SARS-CoV is internalized by CME in human hepatoma 739 HepG2 cell line (39), however, in HEK293E-ACE2-GFP cells, the entry of 740 SARS-CoV is clathrin-and caveolae-independent (40); MHV entry is mediated by 741 CME through the endo-/lysosomal pathway in proteolysis-dependent manner (43, 742 94-97); PHEV enters into cells via CME in Rab5, cholesterol, and low pH 743 dependent manner (98); HCoV-NL63 requires CME for successful entry into the 744 LLC-MK2 cells (99); for the HCoV-229E, a CavME uptake has been suggested (16), 745 however, the clinical isolates of HCoV-229E bypass the endosome for cell entry (100).746Above evidence demonstrates that coronavirus enter cells via multiple pathways.747Thus, study on IBV entry mechanisms is necessary for understanding group 3 748 coronavirus infection process. As mentioned previously, the infectivity of IBV on 749 BHK cells is inhibited by NH 4 Cl treatment (44), demonstrating that IBV entry 750 requires low pH triggered membrane fusion. In this study, we made an effort to 751 systematically examine every step of this process. First, we found that IBV particles 752 initially attach to lipid rafts on plasma membrane, and enter cells via CME, which 753 requires the help of CHC and dynamin1. Additionally, we demonstrate that IBV 754 particles are transported via early and late endosome, and fuse with late 755 endosome-lysosome membrane to release the nucleocapsid.",

The involvement of lipid rafts in virus entry, 759 assembly and budding has been demonstrated by either the co-localization study of 760 the viral structural proteins and lipid rafts or the effects of lipid rafts disrupting agents 761 on the replication processes of several viruses (102). The best characterized lipid 762 rafts-related non-enveloped viral entry is simian virus 40 (SV40) and echovirus type 1 763 (EV1) (103, 104). Binding of SV40 with MHC class I receptors triggers receptor 764 clustering and redistribution, more caveolae is recruited from the cytoplasm at the site 765 of entry, resulting in caveolae-mediated endocytosis in about 20 min (104). In some 766 cell types, SV40 can enter the caveosomes directly from lipid rafts in non-coated 767 vesicles (105). Similar to SV40, EV1 attachment and binding with cells triggers 768 clustering and relocation of \u03b12\u03b21-integrin receptors from lipid rafts to the 769 caveolae-like structures (104). Depletion of cholesterol in lipid rafts inhibits EV1 770 infection (103). For envelope virus, Semliki Forest virus (SFV) and Sindbis virus 771 (SIN) require cholesterol and sphingolipids in target membrane lipid rafts for 772 envelope glycoprotein-mediated membrane fusion and entry (29). Many envelope 773 virus receptors are located in lipid rafts or would be relocated into lipid rafts after 774 infection, such as Human T-lymphotropic virus Type I (HTLV-1) receptor glucose 775 transporter 1 (GLUT-1), Ebola virus and Marburg virus folate receptor-\u03b1 (FR\u03b1), 776 Hepatitis B virus complement receptor type 2 (CR2), Human herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6) 777 receptor CD46 (106). An alternative receptor for Human Immunodeficiency virus 778 (HIV-1) envelope glycoprotein on epithelial cells is glycosphingolipid 779 galactosyl-ceramide (GalCer), which also enriches at lipid rafts (107, 108). Membrane 780 cholesterol is also involved in the first stages of flavivirus infection (47, 109). Guo et 781 al demonstrate that IBV structural proteins, but not non-structural proteins, migrate 782 and integrate into lipid rafts after viral protein translation. The cholesterol enriched 783 microdomains were only involved in IBV attachment, not virus replication or virus 784 particle release (38). However, the involvement mechanisms of lipid rafts on IBV 785 infectivity are still unclear. In our study, we substantiated the involvement of lipid virus life cycle via disruption of lipid rafts by using chemicals at pre-, during-, 787 or post-infection, and checked IBV internalization, viral protein expression, and 788 progeny virus release. Results showed that lipid rafts were involved in IBV entry step. 789 Cholesterol replenishment experiment further confirmed that lipid rafts were 790 necessary for IBV entry. Membrane flotation assay showed the co-fractionation of 791 IBV particles and lipid rafts during absorption step. Immunofluoresence showed that 792 R18-IBV associates with lipid rafts on the cells surface. Above evidence substantiates 793 that IBV initiates the entry step by attaching to lipid rafts. 794 Further experiment showed that chemical inhibitor of endosome acidification 795 (NH 4 Cl) treatment in various susceptible cells reduced the IBV internalization and 796 protein expression, suggesting a requirement for transport of virions to endosomes.

Also, 824 using the R18 and DiOC double labeled virus, we revealed that the membrane fusion 825 happens at 2-3 h.p.i., the time point of virus reaches late endosome-lysosome. 826 Overexpression of VCP, a protein involved in endosome maturation, increased virus 827 gene expression. We speculated that IBV particles were first transported to early 828 endosomes in Rab5-demepdent manner, and were guided to late endosomes in Rab7 829 and VCP dependent manner. Also, the Rab7 dependence indicates that membrane 830 fusion depends on endosomal maturation, suggesting that low pH environment in the 831 late endosome-lysosome may provide an important signal for fusion and viral gRNA 832 release.",
