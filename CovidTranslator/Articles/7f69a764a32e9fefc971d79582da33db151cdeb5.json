Based on studies of isolated BAR domains in vitro, the current paradigm is that BAR domain-containing proteins polymerize into cylindrical scaffolds that stabilize lipid tubules. But in nature, proteins that contain BAR domains often also contain large intrinsically disordered regions. Using in vitro and live cell assays, here we show that full-length BAR domain-containing proteins, rather than stabilizing membrane tubules, are instead surprisingly potent drivers of membrane fission. Specifically, when BAR scaffolds assemble at membrane surfaces, their bulky disordered domains become crowded, generating steric pressure that destabilizes lipid tubules. More broadly, we observe this behavior with BAR domains that have a range of curvatures. These data suggest that the ability to concentrate disordered domains is a key driver of membrane remodeling and fission by BAR domain-containing proteins.",

            "text": "Cellular membranes must undergo dynamic remodeling to facilitate essential cellular processes, including formation of trafficking vesicles (Conner and Schmid, 2003) , viral egress (Hurley et al., 2010) , and cytokinesis (Mierzwa and Gerlich, 2014) . Since membranes resist deformation (Helfrich, 1973) , cells employ specialized protein machines to drive membrane remodeling (Zimmerberg and Kozlov, 2006) . For example, the crescent-shaped, dimeric bin-amphiphysin-rvs (BAR) domains Simunovic et al., 2015) polymerize into cylindrical scaffolds on membrane surfaces, forcing the underlying membrane to adopt the tubular geometry of the scaffold (Frost et al., 2008; Adam et al., 2015) . This rigid scaffold has been hypothesized to stabilize membrane tubules, preventing their division into separate membrane compartments through the process of membrane fission (Boucrot et al., 2012) . Notably, this perspective comes primarily from studies performed in vitro. In living cells, BAR scaffolds are thought to assemble into more limited scaffolds that shape membranes in concert with other proteins, including the dynamin fission machine and the actin cytoskeleton (Itoh et al., 2005; Ferguson et al., 2009; Renard et al., 2015) . Importantly, many in vitro studies on the membrane shaping behavior of BAR domains have examined the BAR domain in isolation, with significant portions of the protein removed. Examples include the N-terminal amphipathic helix BAR (N-BAR) domain of amphiphysin (Peter et al., 2004) , the FCH BAR (F-BAR) domain of FCHo1/2 (Henne et al., 2007 (Henne et al., , 2010 , the F-BAR domain of the neuronal migration protein srGAP2 (Guerrier et al., 2009) , the F-BAR domains of the cytokinesis proteins Imp2 (McDonald et al., 2016) and Cdc15 (McDonald et al., 2015) , and the inverted BAR (I-BAR) domains of MIM and ABBA (Mattila et al., 2007; Saarikangas et al., 2009 ), among others. These results have provided critical insight into the detailed geometry of BAR domain arrangement at membrane surfaces, helping to elucidate their mechanisms of membrane curvature sensing and induction. However, BAR domains do not typically exist in isolation in the cell, but rather as part of large, multi-domain proteins that also frequently contain long, intrinsically disordered protein (IDP) domains of several hundred amino acids (Miele et al., 2004; Lee et al., 2007; Henne et al., 2010; Wuertenberger and Groemping, 2015) . How might these disordered domains influence the membrane remodeling behavior of BAR domains?",

Further, previous work found that disordered domains, which occupy large footprints on the membrane surface in comparison to well-folded proteins of equal molecular weight (Hofmann et al., 2012) , enhanced the efficiency of membrane bending and fission Snead et al., 2017) . However, a fundamental, unanswered question has limited the potential of protein crowding to explain membrane remodeling in cells-what brings bulky domains together to generate steric pressure? In particular, what keeps crowded proteins from simply diffusing away from one another, dissipating steric pressure and inhibiting membrane shaping? Proteins such as amphiphysin (Miele et al., 2004; Peter et al., 2004) and FCHo1/2 (Henne et al., 2007 (Henne et al., , 2010 , which contain both scaffold-forming BAR domains and bulky disordered domains, present a possible solution to this problem. Specifically, the ability of BAR domains to form scaffolds has the potential to locally concentrate disordered domains such that steric pressure is amplified rather than dissipated.",

To compare the membrane remodeling abilities of Amph-FL to those of the N-BAR domain alone, we first examined the effects of each protein on giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs). These experiments revealed that both the N-BAR domain and Amph-FL drove potent membrane bending within 10 min of mixing vesicles and protein, forming mobile, diffraction-limited tubules that extended from the GUV surface (Fig. S1 A and Videos 1 and 2). These GUVs often collapsed or broke apart into smaller tubules and fragments later during imaging (Fig. S1 A and Videos 3, 4, and 5), suggesting that lipid tubule formation was not the endpoint of the membrane remodeling process.",

As expected from previous findings (Peter et al., 2004; Gallop et al., 2006) , the N-BAR domain transformed vesicles that had an average initial diameter of 200 nm into long tubules with average outer diameter 44 \u00b1 6 nm SD (Fig. 1, B and C; and Fig. S1, B and C) . In contrast, Amph-FL did not drive appreciable membrane tubule formation in TEM experiments. Rather, Amph-FL divided the vesicles of initially 200-nm diameter into a population of highly curved vesicles with a peak diameter centered near 22 nm (Fig. 1, D and E; and Fig. S1 D) . This finding suggests that formation of membrane tubules is not a stable endpoint of membrane remodeling driven by Amph-FL, as observed in GUV experiments (Fig. S1 A) . In contrast, N-BAR did not drive a substantial shift in the vesicle diameter distribution in TEM experiments (Fig. 1 E) . Collectively, these results suggest that Amph-FL is capable of driving membrane fission, a more energetically demanding process than membrane tubule formation (Campelo and Malhotra, 2012) .",

Exposure of SUP ER templates to fission-driving proteins results in measurable membrane release from the beads (Pucadyil and Schmid, 2008; Liu et al., 2011; . SUP ER template experiments revealed that while both N-BAR and Amph-FL drove membrane release in the concentration range of 50 to 1,000 nM, Amph-FL drove more than twice as much (2.6 to 4.7-fold greater) membrane release at each concentration ( Fig. 1 F) . Amph-FL also drove consistently greater levels of membrane release compared with the epsin N-terminal homology (ENTH) domain, a protein previously shown to drive membrane fission (Snead et al., 2017; Fig. S1 E) . Notably, the apparent plateau in membrane release ( Fig. 1 F) may be due to the fact that some of the SUP ER template membrane interacts closely with the bead surface, increasing the barrier to membrane release, as seen in previous reports Snead et al., 2017) . However, substantially higher concentrations of Amph-FL up to 10 \u00b5M drove further membrane release (Fig. S1 E) .",

Specifically, we tethered fluorescent vesicles to a coverslip passivated with polyethylene glycol (PEG) and PEG-biotin ( Fig. 2 A) . Vesicles in these experiments contained a biotinylated lipid, which facilitated tethering to the substrate through binding to neutravidin. Vesicles also contained the fluorescent lipid Oregon Green 488-1,2-dihexadecanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (DHPE), which we used to quantify the brightness of each vesicle after imaging in confocal fluorescence microscopy (Aguet et al., 2013; Fig. 2 B) .

Importantly, the biotinylated lipid alone did not drive fission in the absence of protein (Fig. 2 C) . Interestingly, fission by Amph-FL was highly cooperative, leading to a bimodal distribution of vesicle diameter (Fig. 2 D) . In contrast, previous studies using the same assay found that membrane fission by the ENTH domain resulted in a gradual shift of the size distribution toward smaller diameters (Snead et al., 2017) . We speculate that local self-assembly of Amph-FL into membrane-bound scaffolds may drive budding of small vesicles directly from larger vesicles, resulting in a bimodal distribution of vesicle diameter.",

Some long, nondiffraction-limited lipid tubules were visible on occasion in tethered vesicle experiments with N-BAR ( Fig. 2 B) , but our estimations of vesicle diameter did not change substantially if such puncta were excluded (Fig. S1 F). Tubules became more prevalent at micromolar N-BAR concentrations (Fig. S1 G), consistent with the tubules formed in TEM experiments (Fig. 1 C) . However, N-BAR did not drive substantial vesiculation at micromolar concentrations, consistent with our findings from TEM (Fig. 2 , E and F). Our results are in agreement with previous studies that have reported membrane tubulation by N-BAR at protein to lipid ratios of \u223c1:100 (Peter et al., 2004; Ambroso et al., 2014; Isas et al., 2015) , the range in which we observed potent membrane fission by Amph-FL ( Fig. 2 F) . However, previous work has reported membrane vesiculation by the isolated N-BAR domain of amphiphysin at substantially higher protein-to-lipid ratios (Peter et al., 2004) , in contrast with our findings at similarly high ratios (Fig. 2 F) . Additionally, the isolated N-BAR domain of endophilin at a protein to lipid ratio of \u223c1:100 has been reported to drive membrane vesiculation (Poudel et al., 2016) . The differences between these reports and our findings may be due to differences in lipid composition, differences between the amphiphysin and endophilin N-BAR domains, or differences in other experimental parameters. Notably, higher concentrations of Amph-FL were required to observe fission in TEM experiments compared with tethered vesicle experiments. This increase is due to the high lipid concentration used in TEM experiments (\u223c100-fold greater than tethered vesicle experiments), which is necessary to obtain an adequate density of lipid structures for TEM (Fig. 2 F; see Materials and methods) . Taken together, our results from EM and tethered vesicle experiments confirm that Amph-FL is a potent driver of membrane fission, while the isolated N-BAR domain primarily forms membrane tubules.",

            "text": "The ability of Amph-FL to drive membrane fission does not arise from greater membrane binding affinity in comparison to isolated N-BAR How can we explain the ability of Amph-FL to drive membrane fission? One possible explanation could be that the full-length protein may bind more strongly to membrane surfaces compared with the N-BAR domain alone, resulting in more potent membrane remodeling. To examine this possibility, we used a tethered vesicle assay similar to the experiments described above to quantify the relative extent of protein-membrane binding. In this assay, proteins were labeled with Atto 594 dye, while vesicles contained the lipid Oregon Green 488-DHPE. We quantified vesicle diameter as described above, and used measurements of single fluorophore brightness to quantify the number of bound proteins per vesicle (Snead et al., 2017; see Materials and methods) . From these measurements we determined the density of membrane-bound proteins, which increased with increasing protein concentration in solution (Fig. S2 , A-C). These experiments revealed that over the range of protein concentrations in which membrane remodeling and vesiculation began to occur, Amph-FL and N-BAR reached similar number densities of membrane-bound protein, indicating that the two proteins bind membranes with similar affinity (Fig. 2 G) . Specifically, these results suggest that the disordered domain did not significantly enhance protein-lipid and protein-protein interactions, either of which would be expected to increase the density of membrane-bound protein. Indeed, the isolated disordered domain of amphiphysin showed no detectable binding to the membranes used in fission studies with Amph-FL ( Fig. S2  D) . Therefore, the ability of Amph-FL to drive membrane fission cannot be explained by differences in membrane recruitment. However, Amph-FL reached a high coverage of the membrane surface at substantially lower protein concentration compared with N-BAR, owing to the larger membrane footprint of Amph-FL (Fig. 2 H; see Materials and methods). These findings help explain how Amph-FL reached a crowded coverage of the membrane surface, sufficient to drive membrane vesiculation.",

            "text": "The disordered domain of amphiphysin drives membrane fission on its own, but requires higher protein concentration compared with Amph-FL Another possible explanation for the ability of amphiphysin to drive membrane fission is that its substantial disordered domain (residues 240-622) generates steric pressure that promotes fission, in line with previous studies on other membrane-bound disordered domains Snead et al., 2017) . If so, the isolated disordered domain should be able to drive membrane fission when bound to membrane surfaces at sufficient density. To test this idea, we purified the disordered domain of amphiphysin, lacking the C-terminal SH3 domain (Amph CTD \u0394SH3; Fig. 3 A) . We first performed fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) measurements to quantify the hydrodynamic radius of this domain. Specifically, we calibrated the diffusion time of Amph CTD \u0394SH3 against the diffusion times of two protein standards with known hydrodynamic radii, transferrin (Hall et al., 2002) and the C-terminal domain of AP180 (AP180 CTD; Busch et al., 2015) . These experiments yielded an approximate hydrodynamic radius for Amph CTD \u0394SH3 of 4 nm (Fig. S2 , E-G; see Materials and methods), which corresponds to a radius of gyration of \u223c5 nm (Sherman and Haran, 2006; Hofmann et al., 2012) , comparable to other disordered domains of similar molecular weight (Kalthoff et al., 2002; Busch et al., 2015) . FCS experiments also showed that the size of Amph CTD \u0394SH3 varied with the concentration of monovalent salt in the buffer ( Fig.  S2 H) , consistent with the known sensitivity of highly charged disordered proteins to changes in ionic strength (Srinivasan et al., 2014) . We next performed tethered vesicle experiments to assess membrane fission by Amph CTD \u0394SH3. The protein included an N-terminal hexa-histidine (6his) tag to facilitate binding to membranes by the lipid 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-([N-[5-amino-1-carboxypentyl]iminodiacetic acid]succinyl), nickel salt (DOGS-NTA-Ni; Fig. 3 A) . Experiments revealed that Amph CTD \u0394SH3 drove the formation of highly curved fission products (Fig. 3 , B and C). However, 100-fold greater concentration of Amph CTD \u0394SH3 in solution (10 \u00b5M) was required to generate fission products of similar curvature to those observed with Amph-FL (100 nM; Fig. 2 , D and F). Importantly, the DOGS-NTA-Ni lipids alone did not generate high curvature vesicles before protein exposure ( Fig. 3 B, top histogram) . Moreover, isolated 6his tags were not found to drive membrane remodeling (Fig. S2 I) .",

At this coverage, steric pressure from protein crowding is expected to be sufficient to overcome the energetic barrier to membrane fission (Snead et al., 2017) . Therefore, the requirement for a high solution concentration of Amph CTD \u0394SH3 reflects the conditions necessary to promote crowded binding to the membrane surface. In contrast, Amph-FL showed substantially stronger binding compared with Amph CTD \u0394SH3 ( Fig. 3 D) , likely owing to polymerization of the BAR scaffold, which enables multivalent membrane binding (Sorre et al., 2012; Simunovic et al., 2016) . However, plotting membrane vesiculation by Amph CTD \u0394SH3 and Amph-FL together as a function of Figure 3 . The disordered domain of amphiphysin alone drives membrane fission, but the N-BAR scaffold substantially enhances fission efficiency. Membrane composition in Amph CTD \u0394SH3 tethered vesicle experiments: 76 mol% DOPC, 20 mol% DOGS-NTA-Ni, 2 mol% Oregon Green 488-DHPE, and 2 mol% DP-EG10-biotin. In tethered vesicle experiments with N-BAR-epsin CTD, DOGS-NTA-Ni was replaced with 5 mol% PtdIns(4,5)P 2 and 15 mol% DOPS. SUP ER template membrane composition: 79 mol% DOPC, 5 mol% PtdIns(4,5)P 2 , 15 mol% DOPS, and 1 mol% Texas Red-DHPE. the coverage of the membrane surface by proteins revealed that data for the two proteins fall along a similar trend (Fig. 3 E) . This finding suggests that the requirement for a high concentration of Amph CTD \u0394SH3 to drive membrane vesiculation arises primarily from weaker membrane binding in comparison to Amph-FL, rather than from the absence of the N-BAR domain.",

This reasoning implies that any bulky disordered domain that is brought to the membrane surface by a BAR scaffold should be capable of driving membrane fission. To test this prediction, we created a chimera consisting of the amphiphysin N-BAR domain fused to the C-terminal disordered domain of rat epsin1 (N-BAR-epsin CTD; Fig. 3 F) . Importantly, the disordered domain of epsin1 is comparable to the disordered domain of amphiphysin in terms of length (432 versus 383 amino acids, respectively) as well as hydrodynamic radius . Tethered vesicle fission experiments revealed that N-BARepsin CTD generated highly curved fission products from vesicles with an initial average diameter of 200 nm within a similar range of protein concentrations to Amph-FL ( Fig. 3 G; compare to Fig. 2 D) . Further, both N-BAR-epsin CTD and Amph-FL produced a very similar fraction of fission products with diameters below 45 nm at equivalent concentrations in solution (Fig. 3 H) . Finally, SUP ER template membrane shedding experiments revealed that in the concentration range of 50-1,000 nM, N-BARepsin CTD drove greater membrane release compared with the isolated N-BAR domain ( Fig. 3 I) , similar to the results of SUP ER template experiments comparing N-BAR and Amph-FL ( Fig. 1 F) . Importantly, the isolated disordered domain of epsin showed no detectable binding to membranes used in fission studies (Fig. S2 D) , suggesting that the disordered domain did not enhance membrane recruitment. These findings illustrate the ability of N-BAR scaffolds to promote membrane fission by crowding arbitrary disordered domains at membrane surfaces.",

One explanation is that steric pressure among the bulky disordered domains of Amph-FL inhibits the assembly of a long-range N-BAR scaffold, which, if allowed to form, would inhibit fission. In support of this hypothesis, when Amph-FL reached \u223c70% surface coverage as shown above ( Fig. 2 H) , the underlying N-BAR domain covered only \u223c14% of the membrane, based on membrane footprints for Amph-FL and N-BAR of 79 and 16.5 nm 2 per monomer, respectively (see Materials and methods). This coverage is significantly lower than expected for a fully assembled N-BAR scaffold, which approaches complete coverage Adam et al., 2015) . Furthermore, the volume available per amphiphysin disordered domain above the N-BAR scaffold is only \u223c50% of the volume that each domain would be expected to occupy in solution, based on its radius of gyration (Fig. 3 J; see calculation in Materials and methods). Notably, this calculation assumes that the disordered domains are incompressible, demonstrating that they would have to compress substantially in order to fit around the scaffold. Previous work has shown that substantial compression of disordered domains is energetically costly, likely exceeding the cost of membrane deformation . Collectively, these arguments suggest that the presence of amphiphysin's bulky disordered domains inhibits assembly of longrange N-BAR scaffolds.",

These structures have been observed on membrane substrates containing a majority of negatively charged lipids, which are thought to provide a strong electrostatic driving force for scaffold assembly Adam et al., 2015) . Therefore, we performed tethered vesicle fission experiments using a similar membrane composition (Fig. S3) . Here, the onset of membrane fission occurred at somewhat higher Amph-FL concentration, 350 nM ( Fig. S3 ) in comparison to 75 nM ( Fig. 2 , B-F). These results demonstrate that high concentrations of negatively charged lipids cannot prevent membrane fission as protein concentration increases. Indeed, the cryo-EM studies cited above suggest that long-range scaffolds assembled from full-length protein were more rare . Moreover, these studies employed buffers that lacked small monovalent ions Adam et al., 2015) , conditions known to favor extension of disordered domains owing to reduced electrostatic screening (Srinivasan et al., 2014) . This environment likely enabled the disordered domains to pack more efficiently around the scaffold, in line with the needle-like densities seen protruding from the N-BAR scaffold (Adam et al., 2015) .",

            "text": "We next sought to evaluate the influence of disordered domains on the membrane remodeling behavior of BAR domains in live mammalian cells. Multiple previous studies have established that overexpression of BAR domains leads to formation of lipid tubules in the cytosol that are coated by BAR scaffolds (Peter et al., 2004; Frost et al., 2008; Boucrot et al., 2012; McDonald et al., 2015) . We first replicated these findings by overexpressing the N-BAR domain of human amphiphysin tagged with mCherry ( Fig. 4 A) in retinal pigmented epithelial (RPE) cells. We found that N-BAR generated a dense network of tubules inside the cells (Fig. 4 B) , in agreement with previous findings (Peter et al., 2004) . The number of tubules per cell increased with the expression level of N-BAR (Fig. 4 C) , and colocalized with a plasma membrane stain ( Fig. S4 A) , indicating that many of the tubules originated from the plasma membrane as previously observed (McDonald et al., 2015 (McDonald et al., , 2016 . In contrast, overexpression of Amph-FL tagged with mCherry ( Fig. 4 A) led to significantly fewer tubules per cell compared with N-BAR (Fig. 4, B-D) , suggesting that the disordered domain of Amph-FL inhibited tubule formation. Notably, Amph-FL interacts with the clathrin adaptor network and may therefore recruit other membrane remodeling proteins. As such, it is unclear whether the lack of stable tubules in Amph-FLexpressing cells arose from the disordered domain or from other binding partners recruited by Amph-FL. To distinguish between these possibilities, we created a chimera of N-BAR fused to an alternative disordered domain, from the neuronal protein neurofilament-M (N-BAR-NfM CTD), tagged with mCherry ( Fig. 4 A) . The disordered C-terminal domain of neurofilament-M acts as an entropic brush, radiating outward along the length of neurofilaments and sterically repelling neighboring disordered domains to control axon diameter (Brown and Hoh, 1997; Kumar et al., 2002) . The neurofilament-M disordered domain is similar in length to that of amphiphysin (438 versus 383 amino acids, respectively) but is not involved in endocytosis and therefore contains no binding domains for endocytic proteins. Overexpressing N-BAR-NfM CTD in RPE cells resulted in a similar phenotype to Amph-FL, in which the number of tubules per cell was significantly reduced compared with the isolated N-BAR domain (Fig. 4 , B-D). We reach similar conclusions whether protein expression level is matched in terms of the fluorescent protein intensity at the plasma membrane (Fig. 4 C) or in the cytosol (Fig. S4 B) . However, the disordered domains of Amph-FL and N-BAR-epsin CTD appeared to reduce plasma membrane binding slightly (Fig. S4  C) . Furthermore, while tubules in N-BAR-expressing cells had an average length of 6.0 \u00b1 0.2 \u00b5m SEM, tubule lengths in cells expressing Amph-FL and N-BAR-NfM CTD were significantly shorter, 3.5 \u00b1 0.1 and 3.6 \u00b1 0.1 \u00b5m SEM, respectively (Fig. 4 E) .",

            "text": "Time-lapse imaging of live cells revealed that the tubules formed by Amph-FL and N-BAR-NfM CTD were more transient in comparison to isolated N-BAR (Fig. 4 F and Video 6) . Specifically, the tubules in cells expressing N-BAR had an average lifetime of \u223c75 \u00b1 5 s SEM, whereas tubule lifetime was significantly shorter in cells expressing Amph-FL and N-BAR-NfM CTD, \u223c29 \u00b1 3 and 35 \u00b1 4 s SEM, respectively (Fig. 4 F) . The tubules formed by N-BAR also had greater fluorescence intensity in the protein channel relative to the local background in comparison to Amph-FL and N-BAR-NfM CTD (Fig. S4, D and E) . This finding indicates that the disordered domains of Amph-FL and N-BAR-NfM CTD did not promote tubule fission by enhancing protein binding to the membrane surface. Collectively, results from experiments in live cells indicate that bulky disordered domains are capable of disrupting the formation of stable tubules scaffolded by BAR domains, similar to observations in vitro (Fig. 1, C and D) . The disordered domains may have inhibited tubule formation in these experiments by driving membrane fission, though future work is needed to test whether steric pressure from disordered domain crowding plays a substantial role in physiological fission events. Crowding among disordered domains opposes the ability of I-BAR scaffolds to drive inward membrane bending We next asked how the membrane remodeling ability of crowded disordered domains compares with that of BAR scaffolds. To make this comparison, we created a chimeric protein that places the two mechanisms in direct competition within the same molecule. Specifically, we fused the I-BAR domain of human IRSp53 to the bulky, C-terminal disordered domain of rat AP180 (569 disordered amino acids) to form I-BAR-AP180 CTD (Fig. 5 A) . While the I-BAR domain is known to generate inverted membrane curvature (Mattila et al., 2007; Saarikangas et al., 2009) , the attached disordered domains should generate steric pressure that will tend to bend the membrane in the opposite direction. Exposing GUVs to the I-BAR domain alone drove inverted membrane tubulation, as expected ( Fig. 5 B, left; and Video 7). In contrast, the I-BAR-AP180 CTD chimera drove neither inward nor outward tubulation. Instead, the protein caused the GUV membrane to fluctuate dynamically through nonspherical shapes in which regions of gentle membrane curvature extending both inward and outward were apparent (Fig. 5 B, right; and Video 8) . These \"frustrated\" fluctuations demonstrate that the disordered domain effectively neutralized the ability of the I-BAR domain to drive inward membrane bending. This result suggests that crowding among disordered domains and scaffolding by BAR domains make comparable contributions to membrane remodeling.",

This result suggests that assembly of the I-BAR scaffold stabilized the membrane against shedding. In contrast, I-BAR-AP180 CTD drove positive membrane release at all concentrations (Fig. 5 C) , demonstrating that the disordered domain of AP180 is capable of disrupting the membrane-stabilizing effect of I-BAR. Interestingly, tethered vesicle fission experiments revealed that the highest concentration of I-BAR-AP180 CTD that we tested, 5 \u00b5M, drove membrane fission, generating a population of vesicles centered near 30 nm Figure 5 . Disordered domain crowding opposes inverted membrane bending by I-BARs and promotes membrane fission by F-BARs.

This result demonstrates that, under appropriate conditions, steric pressure among crowded disordered domains is sufficient to overcome the structure-based curvature preference of the I-BAR scaffold. Importantly, while wild-type IRSp53 does not naturally contain a large disordered domain, the I-BAR domain-containing proteins MIM and ABBA do contain regions of substantial disorder (\u223c475 amino acids in MIM; Lee et al., 2007) . Therefore, our observations raise the question of whether the presumed role of these proteins in driving cellular membrane protrusions can be justified on the basis of in vitro studies of their isolated I-BAR domains (Mattila et al., 2007; Saarikangas et al., 2009 ).",

            "text": "An F-BAR scaffold drives fission by locally crowding bulky disordered domains If BAR scaffolds drive membrane fission by concentrating large disordered domains at membrane surfaces, then the ability of Amph-FL to drive fission ( Figs. 1 and 2) should extend to other proteins that contain both BAR domains and substantial regions of intrinsic disorder. Interestingly, many proteins that contain the modestly curved F-BAR domain also have this architecture (Roberts-Galbraith and Gould, 2010), including the endocytic proteins FCHo1/2 (Henne et al., 2010) , its yeast homologue Syp1 (Reider et al., 2009) , the srGAP proteins involved in neuronal development (Wuertenberger and Groemping, 2015) , the cytokinesis proteins Cdc15 (Roberts-Galbraith et al., 2010) and Imp2 (McDonald et al., 2016) in Schizosaccharomyces pombe, and Hof1 (Meitinger et al., 2011) in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. To test this idea, we examined FCHo1 (Caenorhabditis elegans), which consists of an N-terminal F-BAR domain followed by an intrinsically disordered domain of 412 amino acids and a C-terminal \u00b5-homology domain (Henne et al., 2010; Umasankar et al., 2014; Ma et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2016; Fig. 5 E) . Negative stain TEM revealed that exposure of vesicles with an initial average diameter of 200 nm to the F-BAR domain of FCHo1 drove formation of lipid tubules with an average diameter of 21 \u00b1 2 nm SD (Fig. 5, F and G; and Fig. S5, A and B) , in agreement with previous findings (Henne et al., 2007 (Henne et al., , 2010 . In contrast, full-length FCHo1 (FCHo1-FL) did not generate lipid tubules, but instead divided the 200-nm-diameter vesicles into a population of highly curved vesicles with average diameter 17 \u00b1 7 nm SD (Fig. 5 H and Fig. S5, C and D) . F-BAR also generated a population of high curvature vesicles in TEM experiments (Fig. S5 D) ; however, such vesicles accounted for only 20% of the overall distribution, while they accounted for 96% of the vesicle population after exposure to FCHo1-FL at a substantially lower protein-to-lipid ratio (1:30 versus 1:500 for F-BAR and FCHo1-FL, respectively; Fig. 5 K) .",

            "text": "Similarly, tethered vesicle fission experiments revealed that FCHo1-FL drove potent membrane fission over the concentration range of 10-250 nM (Fig. 5, I and K) , a comparable range to Amph-FL (50-150 nM; Fig. 2 , D and F), with a mean diameter of 19 \u00b1 1 nm SEM at 250 nM of FCHo1-FL. However, the F-BAR domain alone did not drive fission in these experiments, even at substantially higher concentrations up to 2 \u00b5M (Fig. 5, J and K) . Interestingly, in both tethered vesicle and TEM experiments, the fission products of FCHo1-FL had a peak diameter of slightly less than 20 nm, with some vesicles as small as 10 nm. These small diameters suggest that FCHo1-FL may stabilize the formation of membrane micelles, which are similar in morphology to the hemifusion intermediates that form during membrane fission (Campelo and Malhotra, 2012; Frolov et al., 2015) . Notably, vesicles in these experiments were composed primarily of the lipid 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DOPC), which has a lower bending rigidity than physiological membranes (Dimova, 2014) . In contrast, when we increased bilayer rigidity by replacing DOPC with the substantially more rigid, fully saturated lipid 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DPPC; Lee et al., 2001; Dimova, 2014) , the average diameter of fission products increased to \u223c50 nm at 50 nM of FCHo1-FL, consistent with bilayer vesicles (Fig. S5, E-G) . Collectively, these studies show that, despite their gentle curvature, F-BAR scaffolds are also capable of collaborating with disordered domain crowding to drive efficient membrane fission, producing highly curved vesicles. These findings suggest that the ability of BAR domains to assemble into scaffolds that concentrate disordered domains, regardless of their intrinsic structural curvature, makes an important contribution to membrane fission.",

            "text": "Here we report that membrane scaffolding by BAR domains works synergistically with steric pressure among bulky disordered domains to drive membrane fission. By highlighting the ability of BAR scaffolds to locally concentrate disordered domains, this work helps to explain how steric pressure can be generated and locally sustained at membrane surfaces. Further, our findings are in contrast with the established view that BAR scaffolds prevent fission by stabilizing membrane tubes (Boucrot et al., 2012) . Instead, our work suggests that BAR proteins that contain substantial disordered regions may be drivers of membrane fission. Importantly, previous reports have observed that Amph-FL generates lipid tubules shortly after protein exposure (Takei et al., 1999; , in agreement with the findings of our experiments with GUVs at early time points (Fig. S1 A) . However, we found that at later time points, Amph-FL drove membrane fission in each of our assays (Fig. S1 A and Figs. 1 D and 2 D). Importantly, our in vitro studies do not fully explain the mechanisms by which proteins drive membrane fission in live cells. However, previous studies in live cells suggest that amphiphysin could be playing a supporting role in membrane fission, potentially via a protein crowding mechanism. For example, deletion of the yeast amphiphysins Rvs161/167 leads to a defect in the entry of clathrin-coated pits into cells (Kaksonen et al., 2005; Kishimoto et al., 2011) , suggesting that Rvs161/167 may support membrane fission. However, Rvs161/167 is a heterodimer, and only Rvs167 contains a large disordered domain (Ren et al., 2006) . Additionally, depletion of amphiphysin by RNA interference inhibits clathrin-mediated endocytosis in mammalian cells (Meinecke et al., 2013) , although this endocytic defect has been previously attributed to a reduction in dynamin recruitment.",

            "text": "Our finding that modestly curved F-BAR domains can also collaborate with bulky disordered domains to drive potent fission is surprising, as it suggests that proteins such as FCHo1/2 may participate in membrane shaping throughout the maturation of clathrin-coated pits, and may even help drive the final fission event. This hypothesis is in contrast to the idea that FCHo1/2 are primarily involved in the initiation of clathrin-coated pits (Henne et al., 2010; Ma et al., 2016) . However, previous work showed that FCHo2 is present throughout the lifetime of clathrin-coated pits (Taylor et al., 2011) , supporting the possible role of FCHo2 in membrane shaping. Moreover, many F-BAR proteins involved in other cellular pathways such as cytokinesis also contain large regions of intrinsic disorder Meitinger et al., 2011; McDonald et al., 2016) . As such, our findings raise the question of whether F-BAR scaffolds facilitate membrane fission in a variety of contexts beyond membrane traffic.",

            "text": "More broadly, our work raises the possibility that protein assemblies beyond BAR domains may serve as scaffolds for crowding bulky disordered domains in order to ensure efficient membrane fission. One potential example is dynamin, a scaffold-forming GTPase involved in fission of clathrin-coated pits (Antonny et al., 2016) . Dynamin plays an essential role in driving membrane fission in diverse cellular contexts (Ramachandran and Schmid, 2018) . While dynamin itself does not contain substantial regions of disorder, it assembles with proteins that contain such domains, including amphiphysin and SNX9 (Daumke et al., 2014) . We speculate that once recruited by dynamin, these proteins may generate significant steric pressure at membrane necks. In line with this thinking, the yeast dynamin homologue, Vps1, is dispensable for fission, but is necessary for proper localization and accumulation of amphiphysin at clathrin-coated pits (Smaczynska-de Rooij et al., 2010; Kishimoto et al., 2011) . A function of Vps1 could therefore be to organize and concentrate bulky disordered domains at membrane necks to promote fission. Moreover, previous studies found that amphiphysin acts synergistically with dynamin to enhance membrane fission (Meinecke et al., 2013; . However, one report found that amphiphysin alone did not drive membrane fission in the absence of dynamin (Meinecke et al., 2013) , in contrast with our findings. Notably, this study used rat amphiphysin 2-6 (Meinecke et al., 2013), a splice variant that contains a disordered domain that is only 30% of the length of the disordered domain in human amphiphysin used in our study (Wigge et al., 1997) . The substantially shorter disordered domain likely generates lower steric pressure, which may explain its reduced capacity for membrane vesiculation.",

For all other proteins, lysis buffer was 500 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mM EDTA, 10 mM \u03b2-mercaptoethanol or 5 mM TCEP, 5% glycerol, 1 mM PMSF, 1% Triton X-100, and 1\u00d7 Roche or Pierce protease inhibitor cocktail. Proteins were purified from bacterial extracts by incubating with glutathione resin, followed by extensive washing (at least 10\u00d7 column volumes). Amph-FL, N-BAR, Amph CTD \u0394SH3, and F-BAR were cleaved directly from the resin using soluble HRV-3C (Thermo Fisher Scientific) or thrombin (GE Healthcare) proteases overnight at 4\u00b0C with rocking. HRV-3C, which contained a GST tag, was removed by passage through a glutathione agarose column. Thrombin was removed with p-aminobenzamidine-agarose resin (Sigma-Aldrich). N-BAR-epsin CTD, I-BAR, and I-BAR-AP180 CTD were eluted with 15 mM reduced glutathione in 500 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mM EDTA, 10 mM \u03b2-mercaptoethanol or 5 mM TCEP, 5% glycerol, and 1 mM PMSF buffer. FCHo1-FL was eluted with 15 mM reduced glutathione in 100 mM sodium phosphate, pH 8.0, 5 mM EDTA, 5 mM DTT, 10% glycerol, and 1 mM PMSF buffer. The proteins were concentrated with EMD Millipore Amicon centrifugal filter units, desalted with Zeba Spin Desalting Columns (Thermo Fisher Scientific), and then incubated with the Thrombin Clean-Cleave Kit (Sigma-Aldrich), soluble HRV-3C, or soluble thrombin overnight at 4\u00b0C with rocking. Cleaved GST was removed by passage through a glutathione agarose column. I-BAR-AP180 CTD and N-BAR-epsin CTD were further purified by gel filtration chromatography using a Superose 6 column equilibrated with 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 5 mM EGTA, 1 mM PMSF, and 5 mM DTT. All proteins were stored as small aliquots or liquid nitrogen pellets at \u221280\u00b0C. All proteins except FCHo1-FL were stored in glycerol-free buffer, and all experiments were performed in glycerol-free buffer. FCHo1-FL was stored in the presence of 10 vol% glycerol to improve protein stability, but dilutions during experiments reduced the glycerol concentration to 0.1 vol% or less, which is not expected to affect membrane properties (Pocivavsek et al., 2011) .",

Fitting was performed in Wolfram Mathematica 11 software. \u03b1 values were between 0.90 and 0.93 for all fits, demonstrating that a substantial correction for anomalous diffusion was not needed. Fig. S2 , E-G, shows representative FCS traces and fits for Amph CTD \u0394SH3, AP180 CTD, and transferrin, with mean values of \u03c4 D \u00b1 first SD reported next to each trace. The hydrodynamic radius, R H , of each protein is also reported next to each trace. AP180 CTD was used as a calibration standard to compute R H of Amph CTD \u0394SH3, as \u03c4 D is directly proportional to R H . AP180 CTD is a disordered protein with a radius that has been wellcharacterized (Kalthoff et al., 2002; Busch et al., 2015) , making it an appropriate calibration standard. This calibration approach also yielded a radius for transferrin that was consistent with its expected radius (Hall et al., 2002) , confirming the validity of our approach. The radius of Amph CTD \u0394SH3 was taken as 5 nm in estimates of membrane coverage by proteins in Figs. 2 H and 3 D. This value was chosen based on previous studies, which found that the radius of gyration of a disordered protein is \u223c1.2-fold greater than the hydrodynamic radius (Sherman and Haran, 2006; Hofmann et al., 2012) . (Zhang and Han, 1996) . Because \u03c4 D is directly proportional to R H , the increase in \u03c4 D at 10 mM NaCl indicates an increase in R H , likely owing to reduced charge screening, which expands and extends the disordered protein (Srinivasan et al., 2014) . Similarly, the decrease in \u03c4 D at 1 M NaCl indicates a decrease in R H , owing to enhanced charge screening, which compacts the disordered protein.",

Multiple spinning disc confocal z-stacks of tethered vesicles were acquired with a z-step of 0.1 \u00b5m. The same laser power and camera gain settings were used for all experiments. Notably, we used spinning disc confocal microscopy rather than TIRF microscopy because the low penetration depth of TIRF microscopy would not evenly illuminate larger vesicles.
