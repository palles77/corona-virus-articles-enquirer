CIV samples were treated either with SDS (SDS-PAGE) or with SDS + @-ME (SDS-@-ME-PAGE) lysis buffer. Electrophoretic patterns (Fig. 1) show very significant differences, in particular the presence in SDS-PAGE, of a second major polypeptide with a high-molecular-weight (SDS 6 polypeptide, 150K MW). The relationship between these two different profiles was established by two-dimensional polyacrylamide gradient gel electrophoresis as described under Materials and Methods. Figure 2A shows that some of the viral polypeptides have a particular behavior. Mercaptoethanol nonsensitive polypeptides migrated in the same manner in the two dimensions and were lined up as a diagonal in accordance with their molecular sizes. Some polypeptides migrated as much smaller molecules in the second dimension; for example, the major polypeptide SDS 6 migrated in the first dimension at 150K MW and corresponded to a trimeric form of a 50K MW polypeptide (P'50). In the same manner, polypeptides SDS 7 (120K MW) and SDS 30 (20K MW) corresponded respectively to a dimerit form of P60 and PlO. Three spots (P81, P53, and P49) appeared above the -0 +I3 SDS no. diagonal line of polypeptides. These polypeptides migrated with a lower molecular size in the first dimension and behaved as much larger molecules in the second dimension. This shift indicates a conformational change of the molecule probably due to an intramolecular disulfide link(s). Addition of 8 M urea in the lysis buffer and in the first-dimension gel did not modify the profile of the two-dimensional electrophoresis (Data not shown.). Figure  2B shows a two-dimensional SDS-P-ME-PAGE profile since the polypeptides were solubilized at each of the two electrophoretie steps by the SDS-P-ME lysis buffer. All of the polypeptides migrated to a diagonal line. The reduced state was maintained during two successive electrophoreses. (Fig. 3A ) of native CIV (batch 1) only shows a weak labeling of (P50-P'50). The intensity of (P50-P'50) labeling was significantly increased by a 2% SDS treatment of the CIV particle (batch 2). In addition we could observe labeling of P60. In experiment 3 (batch 3), where CIV was boiled for 5 min with 2% SDS, the labeling intensity of (P50-P'50) was increasing, whereas labeling of P60 seemed unchanged. In addition we could notice the appearance of two new highly labeled polypeptides PlOO and P33. Two-dimensional analysis of the latter sample (Fig. 3B ) allowed further detection of all of the sulfhydryl-containing polypeptides exposed after boiling with 2% SDS. This experiment shows a very significant difference of labeling intensity between P'50 and P50.",

The importance of disulfide-linked proteins for biological activities, structure, and morphogenesis of viral particles is well known. Neurath et al. (1973) Sendai virus treated with dithiothreitol lost hemagglutinin-neuraminidase and hemolysin activities. One report demonstrated the presence of disulfide-linked glycoproteins (VP,B,) within the envelope of HSV. This glycoprotein plays a role in viral penetration into the host cell and may mediate or promote membrane fusion (Sarmiento and Spear, 1979) .",

Different polypeptide patterns have been published for members of the invertebrate iridovirus group (Kelly and Tinsley, 1972; Krell and Lee, 1974; Wagner et aZ., 1974 In a previous study (Barray and Devauchelle, 1979) , it was shown that after solubilization of CIV with SDS-@-ME, 16 polypeptides were resolved with molecular weights ranging from 7K to 120K, with a major polypeptide of 51K. This major polypeptide represents about 40% of the 129 total viral protein. When we compared the electrophoretic behavior of CIV polypeptides under reducing (SDS-@-ME-PAGE) and nonreducing conditions (SDS-PAGE), we could notice very significant differences, in particular the presence, in SDS-PAGE, of a second high-molecular-weight major polypeptide (SDS 6, 150K MW).",
