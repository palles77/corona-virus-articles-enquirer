We'll also know the results of the election for President-Elect, for which we have two excellent candidates in Rhonda Cardin and Johan Neyts.

If you would like to get more involved in ISAR, I strongly recommend that you join our Ambassador Program and help bring more people to the meeting in California.

It also serves to stimulate innovative thinking on the drug development process, and provides specific events to welcome new scientists to our ranks to help them to establish successful careers.

The prodrug structure enables the molecule to permeate the cell membrane and rapidly enter the cytoplasm. The ester bond is then cleaved by a cellular hydrolase, followed by chemically catalyzed release of phenol to yield the negatively charged Ala-nucleotide conjugate, which is cleaved by an amidase to release the monophosphate nucleotide. Cellular kinases then quickly produce the triphosphate molecule, which is incorporated into viral RNA, terminating its synthesis. The prodrug strategy thus avoids the slow first phosphorylation kinetics of nucleoside analogues and greatly enhances intracellular concentration of the active triphosphate metabolite.",

However, antiviral testing has accelerated in the past two years, as postdoc Lisa Oestereich (below) has taken the lead in evaluating antivirals against several highly pathogenic viruses. She was first author on the study of favipiravir treatment of Ebola-infected mice, and in a follow-up paper, she and colleagues in Hamburg and in France performed mathematical modeling of the effect of favipiravir therapy on the kinetics of Ebola virus replication, using data from the earlier paper [4] .",

The concept of FILOVIR was born when Luca found that, despite the existence of numerous virus-related databases on the internet, the information they presented was highly disparate, and it was limited to specific sub-fields and disciplinary areas. Especially for Ebola and Marburg viruses, there was no middle ground between the extreme level of detail of repositories intended for specialists and the superficial (and frequently incorrect) information on non-scientific websites.",

FILOVIR went live in January 2009, and one year later, INFLUENZAVIR went online as a twin site focused on influenza viruses. Once he had created the two websites, Luca realized that he would need help to maintain them, and he was fortunate to obtain the support of two colleagues, Massimiliano Orsini, a bioinformatician expert in genomic databases, and Cristian Romagnani, a biologist who has moved to the field of network systems and big data analysis.",

The influenza virus hemagglutinin is an amazing research topic. Even though this protein has been studied extensively, there are still knowledge gaps regarding its link to receptor signaling and the biochemical details of its proteolytic cleavage or species adaptation. Hence, we use hemagglutinin inhibitors as tools to resolve these basic scientific questions. As for drug development, the hemagglutinin is not an easy target, given its subtypedependent and variable structure. Because influenza viruses evolve very rapidly and easily develop drug resistance, I believe that inhibitors of a cellular factor will have high clinical relevance.

This seminal discovery triggered a focused collaborative program that started in August 2014 and involved CDC, the US Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID) and Gilead, with the aim of identifying a suitable prodrug of GS-441524. The efforts yielded GS-5734, which has potent in vitro activity against multiple filoviruses, with EC 50 values in the 0.1-0.2 \u03bcM range.

Antiviral Res. 98:12-18.ANTIVIRALS ON THE HORIZONNew drugs for flaviviral diseasesPei-Yong Shi, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, UTMB GalvestonPei-Yong has devoted much of his career to the study of flavivirus replication and the development ofantiviral countermeasures. He received his undergraduate degree in Nanjing, China in 1989, then did graduate work in molecular virology in Margo Brinton's lab at Georgia State, receiving his Ph.D. in 1995. After a postdoctoral fellowship at Yale, he joined Bristol-Myers Squibb as a Principal Scientist to develop HIV and HCV therapeutics from 1998 to 2000. He then moved to the Wadsworth Center of the New York State Department of Health, where he directed the flavivirus replication and antiviral program. In 2008, he joined the Novartis Institute for Tropical Disease in Singapore as head of the Dengue Unit, and in 2010 became executive director for disease biology. Pei-Yong's career has recently taken a big step upwards with his selection as the I. H. Kempner Professor of Human Genetics in the Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology at the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston.

She is a member of the ACS Medicinal Chemistry Division Awards Committee and is an associate editor for Current Protocols in Chemical Biology. Karen's interests have also expanded into other areas of women's health, and she is involved in the continuing development of ImQuest's programs to identify prevention and treatment agents for HIV, HSV-1, HSV-2, HPV and various bacterial and fungal organisms. She has been first author or coauthor of more than 30 papers on topical microbicide development. She has assisted with the development of ISAR programs for Drug Discovery and Development 101 and serves on the Women in Science committee. Bill initially worked as a clinical virologist in support of the approved HBV nucleotide prodrugs adefovir dipivoxil and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, which included characterization of the first clinical adefovir resistance mutations. Following their approval, he focused on HCV, which included leading discovery efforts on NS3 protease inhibitors and overseeing biological support for other programs, including the NS5A inhibitor program that led to Ledipasvir.
