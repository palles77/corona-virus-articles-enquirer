Signaling events triggered by the E2 via L-SIGN are poorly understood. Here, kinase cascades of Raf-MEK-ERK pathway were defined upon the E2 treatment in NIH3T3 cells with stable expression of L-SIGN. The E2 bound to the cells through interaction with L-SIGN and such binding subsequently resulted in phosphorylation and activation of Raf, MEK, and ERK. Blockage of L-SIGN with antibody against L-SIGN reduced the E2-induced phosphorylation of Raf, MEK, and ERK. In the cells infected with cell culture-derived HCV, phosphorylation of these kinases was enhanced by the E2. Up-regulation of Raf-MEK-ERK pathway by HCV E2 via L-SIGN provides new insights into signaling cascade of L-SIGN, and might be a potential target for control and prevention of HCV infection.",

As a homologue of DC-SIGN, live/lymph node-specific intercellular adhesion molecule-3-grabbing integrin (L-SIGN, also termed DC-SIGN-related) exhibits 77 % amino acid sequence identity with DC-SIGN and shows similarities in the extracellular region as well as in interaction with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) [2, 3] . L-SIGN is abundantly expressed on endothelial cells of liver and lymph nodes. DC-SIGN and L-SIGN have been demonstrated to be recognition or capture receptors for bacteria, viruses, yeast, and parasites. L-SIGN plays an important role in the pathogenesis of a variety of viruses such as HIV, Ebola virus, hepatitis C virus (HCV), hepatitis B virus, dengue virus, Sindbis virus, filoviruses, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, influenza virus, and Semliki Forest virus [2, [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] . In particular, L-SIGN enhances viral entry into target cells and facilitates infection through interaction with the viral envelope glycoproteins-containing carbohydrate structures [14] .",

Modulation of some signaling pathways by DC-SIGN is involved in the induction of immune responses against numerous pathogens [15] [16] [17] . However, little is known about signal cascade of L-SIGN upon ligand binding. HCV envelope glycoprotein E2 is believed to initiate HCV attachment via cellular receptors. L-SIGN captures and delivers HCV particles to the liver through its interaction with the E2 [18, 19] . Binding of HCV E2 to target cells via relevant receptors is required not only for cell entry but also for receptors-mediated signaling. The hypothesis is that interaction of L-SIGN with HCV E2 might trigger signaling cascade responsible for HCV pathogenesis.",

Previously, we reported that the MAPK signaling was triggered by the HCV E2 protein through interaction with CD81 and low-density lipoprotein receptor on human hepatoma and lymphoma cells [22] [23] [24] . Here, we aimed to investigate role of L-SIGN in transmitting the HCV E2 to Raf-MEK-ERK pathway. In NIH3T3 cells with stable expression of L-SIGN, cascades of Raf-MEK-ERK signaling were defined upon the HCV E2 treatment.

            "text": "We provided evidence that L-SIGN mediates binding of the HCV E2 to target cells and such binding subsequently results in the up-regulation of Raf-MEK-ERK pathway. L-SIGN (binding and capture receptor for HCV) captures circulating HCV particles and facilitates virus infection of hepatocytes and lymphocyte subpopulations, allowing the establishment of persistent infection and the modulation of dendritic cell functions [28] [29] [30] . We previously addressed the interaction of HCV E2 protein with CD81 and lowdensity lipoprotein receptor (attachment and entry receptors for HCV) naturally expressed on human hepatoma and lymphoma cells. Hepatocytes are the primary target for HCV infection and that liver-derived cell lines are the standard model for HCV research. In our experiments, NIH3T3 transfected with L-SIGN (NIH3T3/L-SIGN) was used because it was generated to characterize the function of L-SIGN [25] . As a murine cell line, NIH3T3/L-SIGN does not express any other cellular receptors for HCV beyond L-SIGN, thus allowing evaluation of signaling events mediated by L-SIGN. Our data also demonstrate that NIH3T3/L-SIGN is a suitable cell line for investigation of Raf-MEK-ERK signaling following L-SIGN-HCV E2 interaction. The soluble HCV envelope glycoprotein E2 is regarded as a surrogate to study virus-cell interaction, and putative HCV receptors including CD81, low-density lipoprotein receptor, and scavenger receptor class B type 1 have been identified using the E2 [31] [32] [33] . Indeed, we found that the HCV E2 protein expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells was capable of efficiently binding to NIH3T3/L-SIGN cells. First, L-SIGN was shown to express at a high level on NIH3T3/L-SIGN cells (Fig. 1) . The specificity of the E2-L-SIGN interaction was then confirmed by the E2-binding inhibition assay. Our data showed that the E2 binding was inhibited by the anti-L-SIGN mAb as well as by the combination of antibodies against L-SIGN or DC-SIGN (Fig. 2) , indicating that these antibodies may function as competing ligands for L-SIGN and exhibit the inhibitory effects on the E2 binding. Accordingly, L-SIGN mediated the E2 binding to target cells, which is in accordance with the reports that HCV E2 protein interacts with some primary cells and cell lines expressing L-SIGN. For example, pseudotyped lentivirus particles presenting HCV glycoproteins E1 and E2 bind to BTHP1 cells expressing L-SIGN [29] . Soluble HCV E2 protein binds to HeLa cells stably expressing L-SIGN [2, 18] . HCV E2 protein binds to human monocyte-derived dendritic cells and T-REx cells expressing L-SIGN [19, 34] . As outlined above, differences including the forms of E2 and the cell types occur between the previous reports and our data. The CD81 engagement activates Raf-MEK-ERK cascades, resulting in affecting postentry events of HCV life cycle [35] . Interaction of respiratory syncytial virus glycoprotein G with L-SIGN activates ERK [36] . However, signaling events triggered by HCV E2 through L-SIGN are poorly defined. Since L-SIGN on the cells specifically interacted with the HCV E2, we thereby investigated the consequences arising from such interaction. Our results showed that, under the stimulation of the E2, the phosphorylation of Raf, MEK, and ERK was enhanced in NIH3T3/L-SIGN cells (Fig. 3) . The receptor-blocking experiments were carried out to confirm the specificity of E2-L-SIGN interaction responsible for the above effect. We found that the anti-L-SIGN mAb pretreatment reduced the phosphorylation of Raf, MEK, and ERK induced by the E2 (Fig. 4a) , which was consistent with the inhibitory effects of the antibody on the E2 binding. In addition, the inhibition of E2-induced kinase phosphorylation by the anti-DC-SIGN mAb may be attributable to capacities of the antibody to cross-reactive to DC-SIGN and L-SIGN (Fig. 4b) . Moreover, unspecific effects of the antibodies against L-SIGN or DC-SIGN on the E2-induced kinase phosphorylation were ruled out, as evidenced that the pretreatment with the antibody only led to the reduced kinase phosphorylation in NIH3T3/L-SIGN but not in NIH3T3 cells (Fig. 4c) . Thus, in response to the E2, phosphorylation of Raf, MEK, and ERK was dependent on L-SIGN expression. It would be important to address signaling events triggered by infectious HCVcc bearing E2 protein. HCVcc infection also led to activation of Raf-MEK-ERK pathway in NIH3T3/L-SIGN cells and the E2 treatment enhanced the kinase phosphorylation (Fig. 5) , suggesting the engagement of L-SIGN with the E2 protein as well as the HCVcc accounts for the pathway activation. Supporting our data, Zhang et al. [37] reported that HCV infection activated the Ras-Raf-MEK pathway. Our results demonstrate that interaction of L-SIGN with HCV E2 up-regulates Raf-MEK-ERK pathway. Further investigation into signaling events in cells endogenously expressing L-SIGN would be necessary to validate the role of L-SIGN in the promotion of infection and the pathogenesis of HCV. ",
