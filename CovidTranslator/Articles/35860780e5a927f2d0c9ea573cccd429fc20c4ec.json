In this study, comprehensive HPLC-and FRET-substrate-based screenings of various electrophilic compounds were performed to identify potential M pro inhibitors. The data revealed that the coronaviral main protease is inhibited by aziridine-and oxirane-2-carboxylates. Among the trans-configured aziridine-2,3-dicarboxylates the Gly-Gly-containing peptide 2c was found to be the most potent inhibitor.",

            "text": "Coronaviruses are important pathogens that mainly cause respiratory and enteric disease in humans, livestock, and domestic animals. 1 In 2003, a previously unknown coronavirus called SARS-CoV was identified as the causative agent of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), a newly emerging disease that within a few weeks spread from its likely origin in Guangdong Province, China, to neighboring regions and many other countries. [2] [3] [4] Coronaviruses are plus-strand RNA viruses that use a complex enzymology to replicate the largest RNA genomes currently known and synthesize an extensive set of 5 0 leader-containing subgenomic mRNAs that encode the viral structural proteins and several species-specific proteins with unknown functions. 1, 5, 6 The enzymatic activities required for viral RNA synthesis are part of two virus-encoded polyproteins of about 450 and 750 kDa, respectively, that are extensively processed by two or three viral proteases to yield up to 16 mature proteins and multiple processing intermediates. 7 Most of the cleavages are mediated by the coronavirus main protease, M pro , a cysteine protease featuring a two-b-barrel structure (domains I and II) that is linked to a C-terminal a-helical domain III. The structure of domains I and II is similar to that of chymotrypsin-like serine proteases. 7-10 Because of its essential role in proteolytic processing, the M pro is considered an attractive target for antiviral drugs against SARS and other coronavirus infections. 9 Up to now, a number of potential inhibitors have been proposed employing molecular modeling and virtual screening techniques. [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] However, the inhibitory potency of these compounds has not yet been verified.",
