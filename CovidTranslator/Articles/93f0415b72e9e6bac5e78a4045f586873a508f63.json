EV71 infection manifests most frequently as hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) and children under 5 years of age are particularly susceptible to the most severe forms of EV71-associated neurological disease, including aseptic meningitis, brainstem encephalitis and acute flaccid paralysis indistinguishable from poliomyelitis [1] . The neurovirulence of EV71 first came to people's attention in 1975 in Bulgaria when 44 people died of a polio-like disease [2] . EV71 was further implicated as the causative agent responsible for the epidemics of central nervous system disease occurring in New York, Europe, Australia and Asia [3] [4] [5] [6] . Recent HFMD outbreaks also affected thousands of children in Taiwan [7] , Japan [8] and Singapore [9] , causing the fatality of more than 80 children. Thus EV71 appears to emerge as an increasingly important neurotropic enterovirus in the upcoming era of poliomyelitis eradication. However, no effective antiviral drugs or vaccines are available yet.",

The ORF expresses a large polyprotein that can be co-and post-translationally cleaved into P1, P2 and P3 regions [10] . P1 region encodes the four structural proteins VP1, VP2, VP3 and VP4, while P2 and P3 regions encode other nonstructural proteins (e.g., 2A and 3CD) responsible for virus replication and virulence [1] . Based on a model derived from poliovirus, protease 2A autocatalytically cleaves P1 at its N-terminus and liberates P1 from the nascent polyprotein [11] , while protease 3CD cleaves P1 precursor into VP1, VP3 and VP0 in trans [12] . These three structural proteins spontaneously assemble into icosahedral procapsid in an ordered manner and proceed through a series of intermediates, followed by the encapsidation of the RNA genome into the provirion [13] . The final encapsidation step involves the cleavage of VP0 into VP2 and VP4, therefore the final mature virion consists of 60 copies each of VP1 and VP3, 58-59 copies of VP2 and VP4 and 2-1 copies of VP0 [13] .",

            "text": "Besides the mature virions, naturally occurring viruslike particles (VLPs) of poliovirus have been discovered [14] . VLPs are empty particles consisting of viral structural proteins but devoid of viral nucleic acids, hence they are non-infectious. VLPs can generally induce broad and strong immune responses thanks to the preservation of many essential epitopes [15] [16] [17] , therefore VLPs have captured increasing attention as potential vaccine candidates [17] [18] [19] . To date, numerous VLPs of clinically important viruses, including human immunodeficiency vir us [20] , SARS coronavirus [21] and hepatitis delta virus [22] , have been expressed. In addition, recombinant poliovirus VLPs have been produced using the baculovirus/insect cell or vaccinia virus expression system. These particles were produced via the (1) expression of the complete ORF; (2) co-expression of individual VP0, VP1 and VP3 proteins; or (3) co-expression of P1 and 3CD proteins [23] [24] [25] . Since EV71 and poliovirus share identical genome organization and similar protein functions, we hypothesized that EV71 assembly occurs in a way similar to poliovirus and have previously demonstrated the formation of EV71 VLP by co-infecting insect cells with two recombinant baculovir uses, Bac-P1 expressing P1 and Bac-3CD expressing 3CD [26] . However, the factors influencing the VLP yield were not investigated, and the VLPs were not purified or characterized. In this study, we extended our previous work by further constructing a new recombinant baculovirus simultaneously expressing P1 and 3CD. The new virus was used for single infection of insect cells, coexpression of P1 and 3CD and synthesis of VLP. The yields of VLP produced via the single infection and coinfection strategies were compared. Finally, the VLPs were purified and characterized.",

The molar concentrations of the three proteins as determined by scanning densitometry were roughly equal, agreeing with the notion that the molar ratios of VP0, VP1 and VP3 are identical in the enterovirus provirions [13] . Because no antibodies specifically recognizing VP0 and VP3 were available, the Western blot was performed using anti-VP1 antibody only, which further confirmed that the 39 ku protein was VP1.

            "text": "The assembly pathway of EV71 has not been definitely identified, but the assembly model of poliovirus suggests that concerted cleavage of P1 by protease 3CD is required for capsid assembly. In this study, 3 recombinant baculoviruses were employed to express P1 and 3CD simultaneously in order to mimic the natural assembly process. By either single infection with Bac-P1-3CD or coinfection with Pac-P1 and Bac-3CD, successful processing of P1 into VP1 (Figure 1 ) was demonstrated, proving the successful expression of both P1 and functional 3CD. Alternative approach by co-expression of individual VP1, VP2, VP3 and VP4 proteins has been tested for VLP assembly, yet the yield was very low (personal communication). The comparison of these approaches suggests that VLP synthesis from the P1 precursor is a more favorable route, which agrees with the assembly pathway of poliovirus VLP [24] . The co-infection experiments further suggested that the amount of P1 required was larger than that of 3CD for VLP assembly as the co-infection at MOI 9/1 yielded considerably larger amounts of VP1 than MOI 5/5 or 1/9 ( Figure 3) . Intriguingly, we observed that single infection by Bac-P1-3CD was superior to co-infection by Bac-P1 and Bac-3CD with regard to VP1 production ( Figure  3H ). Since we lacked proper antibodies to detect 3CD, the relative expression levels of P1 and 3CD in the cells singly infected by Bac-P1-3CD remained unclear. However, since P1 expression was driven by polyhedrin promoter which was stronger than p10 promoter regulating the 3CD expression, one may surmise that differential expression of P1 and 3CD arose, namely, the P1 expression exceeded the 3CD expression. Another reason that may account for the higher production by single infection methodology is the VLP-producing cell population distribution as a result of the co-infection approach, whereby only the cells that were co-infected could produce VLP. Using the co-infection methodology, the probability of a cell to be infected by one or two types of viruses and the number of virus entering any given cells follow the modified Poisson distribution as predicted previously [32] . Hence, a population of cells that were singly infected by Bac-P1 or Bac-3CD arose, and no P1 processing or VLP assembly occurred in these cells. Even for the cells that were co-infected by both viruses, the number of infecting Bac-P1 and Bac-3CD within one cell might vary [32] . In cells where the number of Bac-P1 infection far more exceeded that of Bac-3CD infection, insufficient expression of 3CD and inadequate P1 cleavage could occur. On the contrary, in cells where the Bac-3CD infection considerably outnumbered the Bac-P1 infection, a drought in P1 supply could occur and lead to inadequate VLP assembly. Such heterogeneity could decrease the P1 processing and VLP assembly in many cells. In contrast, the infection of Bac-P1-3CD alone resulted in P1 processing in all cells, leading to a higher VP1 yield.",

The in vivo formation of particle aggregates was not previously reported by other researchers studying the poliovirus VLPs [23, 25] , but was recently noted in BHK-38 cells infected by foot-and-mouth disease virus [34] , a relatively genetically distant picornavirus. To date, the biological significance of the particle aggregation remains to be explored, but the resemblance in particle morphology and the aggregation patterns between the VLP and the authentic enterovirus suggests that EV71 VLP adopts an assembly pathway in insect cells in a way similar to the authentic viruses do in their natural host cells. Despite the aggregation within cells, the VLP could be dispersed in solution and purified through CsCl gradient ultracentrifugation to near homogeneity. The purified VLPs comprised VP0, VP3 and VP1 of roughly equal molar ratios, a result consistent with previous findings that poliovirus provirions are composed of 60 copies each of VP1, VP3 and VP0 [13] . This implied the similarity between the VLP and the authentic virus in composition. Notably, in insect cells VP0 did not appear to undergo further cleavage into VP2 and VP4, a maturation process associated with the acquisition of infectivity and the increase in particle stability [35] . The lack of further processing is reasonable as the natural maturation process takes place after the RNA encapsidation, yet in this expression system, no RNA packaging into the central cavity occurred.",

More importantly, the immunogold labeling confirmed the presence of VP1 epitopes on the VLP surface. These data suggest that the VLPs contain the important antigenic sites essential for eliciting the immune responses. This is particularly impor tant because neutralizing epitopes are most densely clustered on VP1 and many of them consist of amino acids from different domains or from different polypeptides [36, 37] , that is, many of them are conformationdependent. In this regard, the use of VLP as a vaccine candidate against EV71 infection may be particularly promising. In recent years, VLP-based vaccines have been demonstrated to not only elicit neutralizing antibodies, but also provoke potent cytotoxic and helper T-lymphocyte responses and have been shown to confer protection from virus challenge in the animal models [38] [39] [40] . Furthermore, papillomavirus-like particles have been shown to induce acute activation of dendritic cells [16] . Other VLPs that have been evaluated in pre-clinical studies for their potentials as vaccines include JC virus, human immunodeficiency virus, rotavirus and parvovirus [41] . Moreover, the humoral, mucosal and cellular immune responses to Norwalk VLP in humans have been reported [42] , while VLP vaccines against human papillomavirus have entered into phase II clinical trials and promising data have been presented [43] . All these further justify the development of VLP vaccines.",

Although other vaccine types, www.wjgnet.com such as inactivated virus and VP1 subunit vaccines, have been tested [44] , only the inactivated virus elicited strong immune responses, again confirming the importance of preserving epitope conformation. However, further assessment of safety and efficacy of the inactivated virus vaccine is required. In this study, we have successfully demonstrated the formation and purification of EV71 VLP via co-expression of P1 and 3CD and a reasonable production yield (\u224810 mg/10 9 cells) was achieved, thus offering an attractive alternative to the inactivated virus vaccine. At present, the immunological evaluation has been impeded due to the difficulty in obtaining sufficient amounts of pure VLP because the recovery yield of VLP by ultracentrifugation was very low. The poor recovery yield may be attributed to the impaired VLP stability as empty capsids are less stable than mature virions [45] . The particle stability may be enhanced by the addition of a stabilizer (e.g., pirodavir, disoxaril or R 78206) that binds the pocket underneath the canyon of the particle [46] . The feasibility of enhancing VLP integrity by stabilizers is being evaluated. Furthermore, the development of a more efficient chromatography-based purification scheme is necessary for process scale-up and is underway.",
