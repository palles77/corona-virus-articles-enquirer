A total of 400 farms were enrolled and followed during the study period. Among these, 109 farms submitted samples suspected for AI to the laboratory, and only 47 farms were confirmed positive by hemagglutinin inhibition (HI) test. Data was collected from these 109 farms about their demography, management, and biosecurity practices. The cumulative incidence of H9N2 was 11.75 % (95 % confidence interval (CI) 8.76-15.23). The highest number of cases (40.42 %) was reported in January. One most likely cluster (p = 0.009, radius = 4.61 km) occurred in the Kasur district. Multivariable logistic regression analyses showed that the presence of wild birds on the farms (odds ratio (OR) = 16.18; 95 % CI 3.94-66.45) was independently associated with H9N2 infection. Cleaning of cages before delivery on farm (OR = 0.16; 95 % CI = 0.06-0.47), presence of a footbath at the entrance of farm (OR = 0.24; 95 % CI 0.08-0.79), and changing of gloves (OR = 0.33; 95 % CI 0.11-0.99) were protective factors against H9N2 infection. Reducing the exposure to risk factors and adapting biosecurity measures may reduce the risk of AI H9N2 infection on commercial poultry farms in Pakistan.",

To date, very little information is available on spatial clustering of H9 infection in this region. Awareness about risk factors responsible for disease introduction and spatial clustering is critically important in developing risk-based surveillance strategies, policies, and timely recommendation for control. The primary objectives of this study were to calculate attack rate (AR) of H9N2 infection and to identify risk factors associated with this infection among poultry farms of Pakistan. The other objective was to identify any clustering of unusually high number of H9 cases than expected for early detection of any emerging outbreak of this disease in different areas of Pakistan when only the number of cases is available.",

Prior to interview, written consent of the owner/ attendant was obtained. The questionnaire contained 26 questions about risk factors, which were known to influence the disease occurrence and were selected after reviewing literature about AI (Nishiguchi et al. 1999; Ward et al. 2008; McQuiston et al. 2005; Fang et al. 2008; Woo and Park 2008; Abbas et al. 2012; Chaudhry et al. 2015; Nishiguchi et al. 2007 ) and from the observations of technical staff working on these farms. The farmers were requested to provide five to ten dead birds from total mortality on farm, which were carefully examined by conducting postmortem examination for specific disease lesions. Typical pathological lesions in respiratory system, i.e., rhinitis, sinusitis, congestion, and inflammation in the trachea (Swayne 2008) , were suspected for AIV. Confirmation was done by Anigen Rapid AIV Ag Detection Kit (BIONOTE Inc., Korea). The outcome of interest was H9 status, i.e., infected and non-infected farms. Samples confirmed by rapid test were further tested by virus isolation in embryonated chicken eggs, and subtyping was done by hemagglutinin inhibition (HI) test.",

SatScan software version 9.1.1 developed by Martin Kulldorff, Havard Medical School (Boston, USA) prospective space-time permutation scan statistic module was used to detect a local excess of events and to test if this excess could have occurred by chance (Hyder et al. 2011 ). This method consists of thousands of cylinders that move across space and/or time. Each cylinder has a base, which represents geographical area (in this study, a commercial farm), and height, which is time (in this study, a day). The base of each cylinder comprised a maximum of 50 % of the population, while height was a maximum of 50 % of the study time (60 days). The cylinder with more observed cases than expected, with respect to cases reported outside the cylinder, is called Bmost likely cluster.^For each location and size of the cylinder, the number of observed and expected cases is counted. Among these, the most Bunusual^excess of observed cases is noted. The statistical significance of this cluster is then evaluated taking into account the multiple testing stemming from the many potential cluster locations and sizes evaluated (Kulldorff et al. 2005 ). ArcGIS version 10 was used for the map display.",

The reason for this high AR could be the high density of commercial poultry farms in these districts. Association of HPAI H5N1 and high and medium density of poultry farms has been studied and was identified as a risk factor in different countries (Henning et al. 2009; Abbas et al. 2012) . Poultry farm densities in these regions ranged from 0.05 to 4 farms per square kilometer (Hamilton et al. 2009 ). As distance between the farms plays a significant role in the transmission of infection, poultry farms in these areas are exposed almost every year during the endemic (Abbas et al. 2012; Chaudhry et al. 2015) . Furthermore, in densely populated poultry areas, movement of vehicles and people from farm to farm is considerably high, subsequently facilitating the spread of this virus through fomites. In the current study, the two districts (Lahore and Kasur) are on the main highway road (Grand Trunk road), which have a significant number of commercial poultry farms alongside. The vehicles over loaded with infected birds or mortality move on this road routinely. Previously, many studies have demonstrated that proximity to major roads was associated with avian influenza (Ward et al. 2008; Chaudhry et al. 2015) . Movement of veterinarian and para-veterinary staff between different farms to implement control measures or to investigate mortalities can also contribute to the spread of virus among farms. In Pakistan, poultry farmers who apply strict biosecurity measures sometimes relax these rules for visitors, who enter the bird areas (Chaudhry et al. 2015) .",
