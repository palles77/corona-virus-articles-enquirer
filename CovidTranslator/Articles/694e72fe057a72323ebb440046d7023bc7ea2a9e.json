            "text": "Live attenuated vaccines are usually generated by mutation of genes encoding virulence factors. \"Virmugen\" is coined here to represent a gene that encodes for a virulent factor of a pathogen and has been proven feasible in animal models to make a live attenuated vaccine by knocking out this gene. Not all virulence factors are virmugens. VirmugenDB is a web-based virmugen database (http://www.violinet.org/virmugendb). Currently, VirmugenDB includes 225 virmugens that have been verified to be valuable for vaccine development against 57 bacterial, viral, and protozoan pathogens. Bioinformatics analysis has revealed significant patterns in virmugens. For example, 10 Gram-negative and one Gram-positive bacterial aroA genes are virmugens. A sequence analysis has revealed at least 50% of identities in the protein sequences of the 10 Gram-negative bacterial aroA virmugens. As a pathogen case study, Brucella virmugens were analyzed. Out of 15 verified Brucella virmugens, six are related to carbohydrate or nucleotide transport and metabolism, and two involving cell membrane biogenesis. In addition, 54 virmugens from 24 viruses and 12 virmugens from 4 parasites are also stored in VirmugenDB. Virmugens tend to involve metabolism of nutrients (e.g., amino acids, carbohydrates, and nucleotides) and cell membrane formation. Host genes whose expressions were regulated by virmugen mutation vaccines or wild type virulent pathogens have also been annotated and systematically compared. The bioinformatics annotation and analysis of virmugens helps elucidate enriched virmugen profiles and the mechanisms of protective immunity, and further supports rational vaccine design.",

            "text": "A live attenuated vaccine contains a live attenuated pathogen that has one or more gene mutations from its wild type pathogen and is able to induce protection in a host. Therefore, live attenuated vaccines have two common traits: (i) attenuated virulence to a host, and (ii) induction of protective immunity in the host against a challenge with a virulent pathogen. The gene mutation is required to attenuate the virulence of the live pathogen, making the vaccine relatively safe for the vaccinated host. Live attenuated vaccines may still grow inside the host, but the growth is greatly limited. To make the attenuated vaccine live allows the attenuated vaccine strain infect the host in a pathway that is often similar to the virulent parent pathogen. This way the vaccine most likely stimulates strong cellular and antibody responses as well as some time of immunity, which can be short term, long term or lifelong. One difference between virulent pathogen infection and vaccination is that after a host is infected with a virulent wild type pathogen, the survived host is normally resistant to any reinfection, and the protective immune response in the host usually lasts for life. However, the immunity resulting from vaccination with a live attenuated vaccine is often short lived although a lifelong immunity may sometimes be induced. However, the exact differences between live attenuated vaccines and their virulent wild type strains in terms of immune response inductions are typically unclear.",

Virulence factors are the various parts of a pathogen that allow the microbe to infect, survive, and replicate in the host [1] . While all live attenuated vaccines contain mutations in one or more virulence factors, not all virulence factors can be mutated to create a live attenuated vaccine. A mutation of a virulence factor in a virulent pathogen will typically lead to attenuation. However, the mutation of a virulence factor may not generate a stable attenuated microbe, or the attenuated strain does not stimulate protective immune response in the host against virulent infection. For simplicity, we have coined the term \"virmugen\" to represent those virulence factors that can be mutated in wild type virulent pathogens for generation of live attenuated vaccines that stimulate protective immunity against virulent pathogen infections. In our definition, the \"live attenuated vaccines\" do not have to be licensed vaccines. A live attenuated vaccine can be any vaccine candidate that is live, attenuated, and proven effective to induce protection against virulent pathogen infection in a vaccination-challenge experiment using a well-established laboratory animal model [2, 3] .",

The result of each query is then presented to the user in the web browser. Two servers are scheduled to regularly backup each other's data. VirmugenDB is a new integrated program of the comprehensive VIOLIN vaccine database and analysis system [4] . Figure 1 demonstrates the VirmugenDB database design and workflow. Each virmugen is annotated with evidence from peer-reviewed references. VirmugenDB also includes general information about individual virmugens such as gene name, pathogen strain name, sequences, and 3D structures.

Manual curation of peer-reviewed journal articles emphasizes the retrieval of specific virmugen information and experimental evidence. In order to determine whether or not a gene is a virmugen, experimental evidence must demonstrate attenuation in a host as well as protection from the virulent parent in a challenge study. To improve the efficacy of manual curation, an in-house web-based literature mining and curation system called Limix was used [5, 6] . The interactive Limix data submission and review system: (a) allows a curator to search literature, copy and edit text, and submit data to database, and (b) provides a data reviewer tools to review, edit, and approve the curated data on one comprehensive web interface. A version control and manage system stores different versions of editions and allows a reviewer to compare history versions to trace the detailed changes. Only after approval by a domain expert, the data can be posted publicly (Supplemental Figure 1 ). The authors and other curators in the team check frequently for possibly new virmugens from published papers in PubMed, and add experimentally verified virmugens to the VirmugenDB. After approval by a domain expert, curated new virmugens from the database will be published in the VirmugenDB website and available for the public to query. We plan to regularly update the customized virmugen BLAST library and the data download site 2-3 times a year.",

The pairwise scores (i.e., the number of identities between the two sequences, divided by the length of the alignment) are equal to or greater than 50% between all Gram-negative bacteria. However, all pairwise scores between the AroA protein sequences of S. aureus and Gram-negative bacteria are between 22% and 26%. Although different pairwise scores were found, all AroA proteins from different bacteria share the same function.

Thymidine kinase is an enzyme important in DNA repair, replication, and nucleotide metabolism [32] . This kinase is responsible for phosphorylation of deoxythymidine in the pathway of DNA synthesis [33] . Many glycoprotein genes from 10 viruses have been mutated for generating live attenuated viral vaccines (Table 2) . A glycoprotein is a class of proteins that have a carbohydrate group attached [34] . Glycoproteins are frequently found in membranes and help a virus bind to the host cell. M2 and M2-2, two matrix proteins, have also been identified to be virmugen proteins in influenza virus, human metapneumovirus, and human respiratory syncytial virus ( Table 2 ). The M protein is crucial in the formation of extracellular virus particles [35] . Viral matrix proteins mediate the regulatory switch from transcription to RNA replication and act late in infection by inhibiting viral transcription and up-regulating RNA replication [36] . Therefore, mutation of a matrix protein gene would reduce the viral pathogenesis by reducing viral replication and late infection capabilities of viruses. The mutation of this protein is only effective for RNA viruses, and DNA viruses do not have the equivalent of an M protein in RNA viruses.",

In contrast, only one virmugen (sigE) mutant of M. tuberculosis up-regulated the production of IFN-\u03b3 from lung [38] . The production of IL-4 was not updated by any virmugen. The productions of IL-6, IL-10, TNF\u03b1, and IgG were up-or down-regulated in the infected hosts depending on the virmugens and pathogen targeted. For example, compared to host infected with virulent parent strains, IL-6 was down-regulated in live attenuated F. tularensis FTL0552 mutant, but up-regulated in an E. coli and a Salmonella mutant. Interestingly, TNF-\u03b1 was down-regulated in a M. tuberculosis adD26 mutant but up-regulated in M. tuberculosis sigE mutant.

Our meta-analysis results show up-or down-regulation of the same host genes may occur in different virmugen mutants of the same pathogen (Table  3 ).

The single gene criterion was purposeful, as it allows for examination and analysis of the true function of that particular gene within host infection and immune response. In many cases, live attenuated vaccines are created through multigenic mutations. However, with multiple genes mutated, it is often difficult to determine how these genes are interacting with each other or their individual roles in infection and immunity. Therefore, VirmugenDB prefers to collect virmugens whose corresponding vaccines include only single gene mutations. Occasionally those live attenuated vaccines with multigenic mutations were included as evidence for obtaining and justifying new virmugens. In these cases, a careful annotation was taken to ensure that each gene was mutated as a virulence factor. Also, it should be noted that virulence is usually multigenic with different virulence factors working together. The mutation of one gene may disrupt a pathogenesis pathway involving many virulence factors. Sometimes a deletion of a single virulence factor may not lead to obvious decrease of virulence, probably due to the presence of an alternative pathway(s) in the pathogen. In this case, a simultaneous deletion of two or even more virulence factors may be required to achieve the status of attenuation.",

Manual curation includes peer-reviewed publications from PubMed. A PubMed ID (PMID) is extracted and used to retrieve detailed citation information (e.g., authors, journal, and date). The evidence that proves the status of virmugen for each protein is curated from published experimental studies. Vaccines associated with the virmugens are also curated. PDB IDs are manually retrieved when available to provide 3D structure information of individual protective antigens. Internally developed script uses an input sequence ID from a NCBI database (e.g., NCBI Entrez Gene database) to automatically retrieve different types of information. The extracted DNA and protein sequences are further used for bioinformatics analyses using different methods. A web-based VirmugenDB query system is available for public query and analysis of Virmugen data. Compared to the wild type virulent parent strain, a live attenuated virmugen mutant has a mutated virmugen that encodes for a virulence factor. The virmugen virulence factors often involve synthesis and metabolism of various nutrients including amino acids, carbohydrates, and nucleotides. Some virmugens are critical for cell membrane formation. When a virmugen mutant or a virulent parent strain infects a host, similar and different host immune responses will occur. Specifically, a virulent pathogen will initiate a series of pathological host processes that lead to a host disease. The host immune system is often hijacked by the pathogen, allowing the pathogen to survive and replicate inside the host. In contrast, the host immune system will form a strong defense process(es) to eventually eliminate the live attenuated virmugen mutant inside the host. In terms of the induction of protective immunity, common protective immune responses may be generated by the host for both virmugen mutant and its parent virulent strain. In this case, the levels of immune responses between these two strains may be different. In addition, the host immune system may be able to generate a protective immunity that is unique to the live attenuated virmugen mutant (not for virulent parent strain). All the differences can be traced to the original mutation of a virmugen(s). ",
