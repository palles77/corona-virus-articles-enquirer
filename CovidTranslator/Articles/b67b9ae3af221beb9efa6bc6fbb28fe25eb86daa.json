The protocol includes strategies for the isolation of switch-memory B cells from peripheral blood, the culture of B cells, the removal of the supernatant for screening and the lysis of B cells in preparation for immunoglobulin heavy-chain and light-chain amplification and cloning. We have observed that the addition of cytokines IL-2, IL-21 and irradiated 3T3-msCD40L feeder cells can successfully stimulate switch-memory B cells to produce high concentrations of IgG in the supernatant. The supernatant may then be screened by appropriate assays for binding or for other functions. This protocol can be completed in 2 weeks. It is adaptable to use in other species and enables the efficient isolation of antibodies with a desired functional characteristic without prior knowledge of specificity.

The history of these advances and the use of these techniques were recently described in a comprehensive review 1 . For several decades, mouse monoclonal antibodies were isolated using the hybridoma technology 2 . However, the therapeutic application of these antibodies was limited by induction of anti-mouse antibodies and autoreactivity. More recently, monoclonal antibodies have been isolated through phage display libraries produced from humans with a humoral response of interest 3, 4 . Although this technique has produced numerous useful antibodies, its applicability is limited by differences in binding properties between antibodies expressed in bacterial and eukaryotic cells. In addition, phage display may result in heavy-and light-chain combinations that do not occur in the same B cell in vivo. Human B cells have also been immortalized by electrofusion 5 or Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) transformation [6] [7] [8] , with or without the use of toll-like receptor ligands. However, these techniques can be inefficient in some patients, such as those with HIV infection, and transformed clones can be lost because of instability.",

            "text": "In studies published since 2008, direct cloning of Ig-encoding genes from isolated B cells and their expression as monoclonal antibodies have bypassed many of these limitations and enabled the isolation of antibodies that are particularly rare or difficult to clone 9, 10 . This technique involves PCR amplification of Ig-encoding genes from B cells, cloning them into an expression vector and re-expression in 293T cells. To produce human monoclonal antibodies with a given specificity, two methods have been applied to isolate B cell populations of interest. In the first approach, plasmablasts have been isolated from the peripheral blood of infected or vaccinated patients 11 . This technique relies on the expansion of antigen-specific B cells within the plasmablast population in the peripheral blood 5-7 d after infection or vaccination. In the second approach, fluorescently labeled antigens have been used to stain and sort antigen-specific memory B cells before cloning. HIV envelope (Env) trimers have been used for this purpose to isolate broadly neutralizing antibodies to 13) . Similarly, the broad and potent HIV-neutralizing antibody VRC01 was cloned using modified Env antigens. Peripheral blood B cells were stained with both a resurfaced core Env (RSC3) and a RSC with a point mutation in the CD4-binding site. Implementation of this technique made possible the isolation of cells specific for the CD4binding sites that were used in expression cloning. However, for some antigens, such as HIV Env, there is considerable nonspecific background binding to B cells or other cells. Furthermore, only a small subset of B cells that bind a given antigen may have the effector function of interest. The use of modified antigens, such as RSC3, also requires prior knowledge of the specificity of interest.",

            "text": "In 2009, HIV-specific human monoclonal antibodies were isolated using an approach that enabled the examination of a broader range of peripheral blood B cells 14 . In that study, memory B cells were sorted, plated at a density of 1.3 cells per well, expanded in vitro with the addition of feeder cells and conditioned medium generated from mitogen-stimulated human T cells, and then the supernatants were screened for neutralization using a highthroughput technique 14 . The genes encoding Ig were then cloned from wells with neutralizing activity. In theory, this strategy enables researchers to isolate a large variety of antibodies with an effector function of interest without prior knowledge of specificity. However, the method for the isolation and in vitro expansion of B cells has remained proprietary. Recently, broadly neutralizing influenza hemagglutinin-specific antibodies were isolated from vaccinated or recently infected patients using IL-6 in microculture of sorted plasma cells 15 . In another study, researchers cultured eight cells per well after EBV transformation and plated the cultured cells with CD40L-expressing cells, a TLR9 agonist and a CHK2 kinase inhibitor 8 . However, implementation of this method potentially raises the same concerns noted above regarding the efficiency and stability of EBV transformation of B cells isolated from patients with HIV infection. Thus, there continues to be a need in the field for more widely applicable techniques for the isolation of monoclonal antibodies.",

            "text": "Our goal was to develop a simple, high-throughput method to isolate and expand memory B cells from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) that did not require transformation, fusion, transduction or activated T cell supernatant, and which produced at least 10 ng ml \u22121 of secreted IgG, the threshold for our microneutralization screening assay. Recently, we developed a technique in which peripheral blood B cells are plated in 384-well plates, similarly to the strategy noted above, and then B cells are stimulated and expanded over 13 d of culture. It is a major challenge for previously frozen primary B cells to survive culture at near-clonal density for up to 2 weeks and to overcome their highly proapoptotic state after activation 16 . To overcome this challenge, we tested multiple conditions known to enhance B cell survival or proliferation, including adding any of the following to the culture medium: The technique uses a negative isolation strategy that limits activation-induced cell death. This approach also enables the isolation of cells with low expression levels of surface IgG, such as plasmablasts. Cells are then stimulated to proliferate and produce IgG by culturing with CD40L-expressing feeder cells and IL-2, as well as IL-21, a potent inducer of antibodysecreting plasma cells 17 . We optimized the concentration of each of these components individually and in combination to maximize the concentrations of IgG produced (typically 0.2-1 \u03bcg ml \u22121 ). In our experience, when four cells per well are plated, we observe an average of 76% of wells that contain more than 10 ng ml \u22121 of IgG. This yield translates into a 77% efficiency overall, on the basis of a Poisson distribution predicting that 98% of wells would receive a minimum of one B cell. In the wells that we have selected for cloning, we recover at least one heavy or light chain 100% of the time. In 24% of cases, we are able to recover a matching number of heavy and light chains. We recommend aiming to achieve seeding densities between 1.3 and 4 B cells per well. A higher density of B cells in microwells will reduce the number of plates needed to screen the same number of B cells; however, it will also increase the difficulties in antibody cloning, as all combinations of heavy and light chains obtained from a well must be paired and expressed to regenerate the natural heavy-and light-chain pairing. Thus, the choice of seeding density depends on the individual laboratory's ability to handle large numbers of B cell culture plates as well as its capacity for the downstream steps of cloning, protein expression and functional assays.",

Figure 1b shows the purity of CD19 + IgM \u2212 IgA \u2212 IgD \u2212 B cells after sorting. If the protocol is carried out appropriately, peak levels of IgG can be detected 2 weeks after a B cell-sorting process. Figure 2 shows the IgG concentration when the B cells are cultured at different cell densities after 13 d of culture. A higher percentage of IgG-positive wells were found when cells were seeded in the 384-well plate at 4 cells per well than at 2.5 cells per well. When seeding level was 4 cells per well, 70% of the wells were found to have an IgG concentration above 1.0 \u03bcg ml \u22121 . Therefore, we chose the density of 4 B cells per well to strike a balance between the number of B cells screened and the amount of cloning to be done 18 .",
