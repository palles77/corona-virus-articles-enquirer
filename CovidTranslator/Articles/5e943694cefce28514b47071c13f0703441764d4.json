In this study we have investigated the mechanisms by which VPA inhibits LCMV multiplication in cultured cells. VPA reduced production of infectious LCMV progeny and virus propagation without exerting a major blockage on either viral RNA or protein synthesis, but rather affecting the cell release and specific infectivity of LCMV progeny from infected cells. Our results would support the repurposing of VPA as a candidate antiviral drug to combat arenavirus infections.",

            "text": "Arenaviruses are enveloped viruses with a bi-segmented, negative-strand (NS) RNA genome and a life cycle restricted to the cell cytoplasm (Buchmeier, 2007) . Each RNA segment uses an ambi-sense coding strategy to direct the expression of two gene products in opposite orientations separated by a noncoding intergenic region. The large segment (L; 7.2 kb) encodes the L protein, an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, and the small RING finger protein Z that is the counterpart of the matrix (M) protein found in many enveloped NS RNA viruses. The small segment (S; 3.5 kb) encodes the viral nucleoprotein (NP) and the glycoprotein (GP) precursor GPC. Co-translational cleavage of GPC by signal peptidase produces a 58 amino acid stable signal peptide (SP), and subsequent posttranslationalprocessing of GPC by the cellular site 1 protease (S1P) generates the peripheral virion attachment protein GP1 and the fusion-active transmembrane protein GP2. Trimers of GP1/GP2 form the spikes that decorate the virus surface and mediate cell entry via receptor-mediated endocytosis (Buchmeier, 2007; Kunz, 2009; Kunz et al., 2002) . L and NP are the minimal trans-acting factors required for virus RNA replication and gene expression (Lee et al., 2000) , whereas production of infectious particles also requires GP and Z (Lee et al., 2002) with the latter being the driving force of virus budding at the plasma membrane (Buchmeier, 2007) .",

Moreover, evidence indicates that the globally distributed prototypic arenavirus LCMV is a neglected clinically relevant human pathogen (Barton et al., 2002; Jahrling and Peters, 1992; Mets et al., 2000) . Concerns about arenavirus infections of humans are aggravated because the only existing vaccine, the JUNV live attenuated Candid1 strain, is licensed exclusively in Argentina and it does not protect against LASV induced disease. Likewise, existing anti-arenavirus therapy is limited to the use of the nucleoside analogue ribavirin, which is only partially effective and is associated with significant side effects (Snell, 1988) . Therefore, it is important to develop novel antiviral strategies and drugs to combat human pathogenic arenaviruses.",

In this study we have investigated the mechanisms whereby VPA inhibits multiplication of the prototypic arenavirus LCMV, an excellent model to study basic aspects of the molecular and cell biology of HF arenaviruses.

VPA exhibited 50% toxic concentration (TC 50 ) of 33.42 mM during 48 h treatment or 28.43 mM during 72 h treatment ( Fig. 1 ). At 10mM VPA had no noticeable effects on cell viability after either 48 or 72 h of treatment and thereby we selected this VPA concentration for further experiments. Then, we examined the effect of VPA on LCMV multiplication following infection of BHK-21 cells at low (0.01) moi. To facilitate virus detection in infected cells we used a recombinant tri-segmented LCMV that expresses GFP (r3LCMV-GFP) (Emonet et al., 2009) . Treatment of infected cells with VPA (10 mM) did not have any noticeable effect on cell survival over the duration (72 h) of the experiment but resulted in a large reduction in the numbers of GFP positive cells at 48 and 72 h p.i. (Fig. 2A, B) . VPA induced reduction in the number of virus-derived GFP positive cells correlated with a drastic reduction in production of infectious progeny of both r3LCMV-GFP (Fig. 3A) and wild type LCMV (LCMV-WT) (Fig. 3B) . We obtained similar results following infections at higher (0.5) moi (data not shown). To asses a possible direct effect of VPA on the infectivity of LCMV particles, as it has been described for other antiviral drugs against enveloped viruses (Wolf et al., 2010) , we treated equal numbers of FFU of r3LCMV-GFP (Fig. 4A ) or WT LCMV (Fig. 4B) with VPA (10 mM) or vehicle at 37\u00b0 C for 30 and 60 minutes, followed by determination of virus infectivity. Results from this experiment indicated that VPA did not have any noticeable virucidal effect on either r3LCMV-GFP or LCMV-WT.",

For this, we transfected 293T cells with pC-Z-Flag and 5 h later the medium was replaced with fresh medium containing increasing concentrations of VPA. At 48 h post-transfection we collected TCS and prepared cell lysates. Z-containing VLPs were isolated from TCS as described in Materials and Methods. Levels of Z in cell lysates and VLP preparations were determined by WB using an antibody to Flag (Fig. 7A) . We observed that VPA at the lowest concentration used (2 mM) caused about 50 % reduction in Z-mediated budding, and this inhibitory effect did not augment in cells treated with higher (5 and 10 mM) VPA concentration (Fig. 7B ). Cellular levels of Z were slightly reduced in non-treated compared to VPA-treated cells, which likely reflects a higher rate of Z budding in VPA non-treated cells. It should be noted that we have previously documented that Z mutants impaired in budding activity accumulate within cells to higher levels than wt Z.",

We next examined whether the morphology, size and infectivity of LCMV progeny particles released from infected cells were affected by VPA treatment. For this, viral particles released to TCS from LCMV-infected cells, treated or not with VPA, were concentrated and examined by TEM using negative staining. In both cases, viral particles showed similar morphologies (Fig. 8C) and sizes (Fig. 8D ) that were consistent with those previously reported (Rodrigo et al., 2011) . TCS infectious titers derive from infected cells in the presence or absence of VPA were 1.40\u00d710 4 and 3.95\u00d710 6 PFU /ml, respectively. VPA treatment caused about 280-fold decreased in TCS infectivity by only about 2-fold reduction in the numbers of total virion particles released (Fig. 8E) . VPA-mediated reduced incorporation of GP-1 into released particles could account for the large reduction in the specific infectivity of the released particles. To examine this question we determined by Western blot the GP2/NP ratios in particles isolated from LCMV-infected cells in the absence or presence of VPA (Fig. 8F) . Because the availability of antibodies that work in Western blot, we used GP2 as a surrogate of the levels of GP1 present in particles released into the supernatant of LCMV-infected cells. Treatment with VPA did not affect significantly the GP2/NP ratio compared to VPA untreated LCMV-infected cells.",

            "text": "In a previous study we reported that VPA exhibits a broad-spectrum antiviral reflected by its ability to inhibit multiplication of enveloped viruses belonging to five different viral families. VPA appears to exert its broad-spectrum antiviral activity via different mechanisms. Thus, we showed that VPA blocked WNV, but not VSV, RNA replication and protein synthesis, whereas VPA treatment caused a drastic reduction on the release and stability of VSV particles (Vazquez-Calvo et al., 2011) . In this report we have investigated the mechanisms whereby VPA inhibits multiplication of the prototypic arenavirus LCMV. Our results have shown that VPA inhibited very robustly production of infectious LCMV progeny (Figs. 2 and 3) but minimally interfered with viral RNA synthesis in virus-infected cells (Fig. 6A) . Accordingly, VPA treatment did not affect levels of a reported gene whose expression was driven by an LCMV minigenome system (Fig. 6B) . At 24 h p.i. the ratio S/ NPmRNA in LCMV-infected cells was consistently slightly lower in VPA-treated cells compared to untreated control cells. This likely reflected the effect of VPA treatment on production of infectious progeny, which affected the speed of virus propagation throughout the cell monolayer following infection at low (0.01) moi. The faster propagation of LCMV in VPA untreated cells resulted in a slightly faster peak of levels of genome and antigenome S RNA species, which was accompanied by the initiation of down-regulation of viral transcription.",

Therefore, VPA-mediated interference with a variety of cellular processes may be at the root of the anti-LCMV activity of VPA. However, inhibition of HDAC is unlikely to mediate the anti-LCMV activity of VPA as we have shown that the HDAC trichostatin A did not affect LCMV multiplication (Vazquez-Calvo et al., 2011) . On the other hand, a number of studies have documented that VPA affects the lipid composition of cellular membranes (Shaltiel et al., 2004; Terbach and Williams, 2009; Tokuoka et al., 2008; Xu et al., 2007) and it has been proposed that VPA treatment could alter VSV particle composition as to render extracellular particles with reduced stability (Vazquez-Calvo et al., 2011) .",

Budding of arenaviruses from the plasma membrane involves the association of the virus ribonucleoprotein core with host-derived membranes enriched for viral surface GPs (P\u00e9rez et al., 2003) , a process that is driven by the Z protein, which has been shown to be the driving force of arenavirus budding (Capul and de la Torre, 2008; P\u00e9rez et al., 2003; Strecker et al., 2003; Urata et al., 2006) . Z-mediated budding involves its interaction with host cell proteins including members of the multivesicular body pathway (P\u00e9rez et al., 2003; Strecker et al., 2003; Urata et al., 2006) , and these interactions required myristoylation of Z at position G2 that promotes Z association with membranes (Perez et al., 2004) . Therefore, VPA-mediated effects on lipid metabolism may have also contributed to impaired Z budding efficiency (Fig. 7) in our cell-based assay (P\u00e9rez et al., 2003) . It should be noted that VPA did not exhibit a typical linear dose-dependent inhibition of either production of LCMV infectious progeny (Fig. 5) or Z budding activity (Fig. 7) . The exact mechanisms by which VPA inhibits LCMV multiplication remain to be determined and it may involve a complex combination of interactions that would exert their full potential inhibitory activity only once VPA reaches a threshold concentration in cells, which could account for its non-linear dosedependent inhibitory activity.",

This effect however cannot account for the magnitude of the inhibitory effect exerted by VPA treatment on production of infectious progeny (about 280-fold reduction), suggesting that VPA affected not only the efficiency of particle release but also their specific infectivity, a finding similar to that described for VSV infection (Vazquez-Calvo et al., 2011) . The effect of VPA on the specific infectivity of released virus particles was not related to reduced incorporation of surface viral GPs into the viral particles (Fig. 8F) . The previously commented alteration of cellular lipid metabolism induced by VPA probably results in alterations of the lipidic composition of the cellular membranes from which LCMV acquires its envelope. These alterations could be behind the reduction of infectivity of released LCMV particles in VPAtreated cells here reported.",

Likewise current anti-arenavirus therapy is limited to an off-labelled use of ribavirin that is only partially effective and associated with significant side effects (Borio et al., 2002) . The results described in this work raise the possibility of a therapeutic antiviral use of VPA. The SI of a compound is considered as a good predictor of the feasibility for its development into a potential candidate antiviral drug (Li et al., 2005) . Notably, VPA exhibited a SI of 576.2 for LCMV, which supports to consider VPA as a good antiviral drug candidate against arenaviruses. It should be noted that VPA is currently being used for epilepsy treatment and its therapeutic dose range (50-100 mg/kg) results in concentrations of VPA in plasma of 0.3-0.6 mM (Cramer et al., 1986; Kanner, 2003) , which are significantly higher than the IC 50 value we determined for LCMV (0.058 mM).
