            "text": "Mesenchymal stem cells have been widely studied to promote local bone regeneration of osteonecrosis of the femoral head (ONFH). Previous studies observed that dimethyloxaloylglycine (DMOG) enhanced the angiogenic and osteogenic activity of mesenchymal stem cells by activating the expression of hypoxia inducible factor-1\u03b1 (HIF-1\u03b1), thereby improving the bone repair capacity of mesenchymal stem cells. In the present study, it was investigated whether DMOG could increase the bone repair capacity of adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs) in the treatment of ONFH. Western blot analysis was performed to detect HIF-1\u03b1 protein expression in ASCs treated with different concentrations of DMOG. The results showed DMOG enhanced HIF-1\u03b1 expression in ASCs in a dose-dependent manner at least for 7 days. Furthermore, DMOG-treated ASCs were transplanted into the necrotic area of a rabbit model of ONFH to treat the disease. Four weeks later, micro-computed tomography (CT) quantitative analysis showed that 58.8\u00b17.4% of the necrotic area was regenerated in the DMOG-treated ASCs transplantation group, 45.5\u00b13.4% in normal ASCs transplantation group, 25.2\u00b12.8% in only core decompression group and 10.6\u00b12.6% in the untreated group. Histological analysis showed that transplantation of DMOG-treated ASCs clearly improved the bone regeneration of the necrotic area compared with the other three groups. Micro-CT and immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated the revasculation of the necrotic area were also increased significantly in the DMOG-treated ASC group compared with the control groups. Thus, it is hypothesized that DMOG could increase the bone repair capacity of ASCs through enhancing HIF-1\u03b1 expression in the treatment of ONFH.",

Several methods have been used to treat early-stage ONFH, such as drug therapy, core decompression, vascularized bone grafting and rotational osteotomy.

The diagnostic or therapeutic strategy for ONFH is best introduced at the early stage before the disease becomes irreversible. Currently, the treatment methods of early-stage ONFH are highly controversial (28) . Core decompression is reported to be effective for early-stage ONFH, and acts to reverse the natural process of ONFH by providing a conduit for angiogenesis to revascularize subchondral bone and reducing elevated intraosseous pressures (29, 30) . However, the majority of studies about the effectiveness of core decompression suggest that the results of this approach are not satisfactory (31, 32) . The aseptic necrotic bone in the femoral head retains its normal strength until the natural process of revascularization starts to remove the dead bone in preparation for the formation of new bone. As repair advances, the speed of angiogenesis and osteogenesis becomes slower than absorption of the dead bone, which may cause a weakening of mechanical structure (3). Jones hypothesized that new capillaries could only penetrate 10-15 mm of necrotic bone, and subchondral bone tissue usually can not be repaired (33) . Furthermore, microfractures of the subchondral bone may retard capillary penetration, and then the loaded areas would collapse (33) . Thus, it is important for ONFH treatment to increase local vascularization and new bone formation. It has been reported that the MSCs pool of the femoral head could not provide enough osteoblasts to meet the need of local bone regeneration (34) . Researchers have also suggested that MSCs in the proximal femur have a decreased proliferative and differentiation capacity at the early stage of ONFH (35, 36) . Therefore, MSCs have been employed to aid core decompression to treat early-stage ONFH (11, 12, 37) . Hypoxia inducible factor-1a (HIF-1\u03b1) is an important functional subunit of the HIF family, which are crucial mediators of the adaptive cells response to hypoxia (17) . HIF-1\u03b1 arose early in evolution, and is widely expressed in most human tissues (17) . A previous study found that HIF-1\u03b1 controls the expression of numerous genes in cells, cell proliferation and differentiation (38) . Our previous study showed that, compared with normal MSCs, HIF-1\u03b1 transgenic MSCs had improved osteogenic and angiogenic capacity in vitro and better potential to promote bone regeneration in the necrotic area of the femoral head (19) .",

Under hypoxic conditions, prolyl hydroxylase activity decreases and HIF-1\u03b1 is stabilized (39) . DMOG is able to inhibit prolyl hydroxylase activity at normal oxygen tension, thus leading to HIF-1\u03b1 overexpression in cells. DMOG has been used to treat ischemic skeletal muscles, middle cerebral artery occlusion and ischemic myocardial injury, and all resulted in good outcomes in previous experiments (40) (41) (42) . Our previous study showed that DMOG could significantly enhance VEGF production in ASCs and improved the osteogenic differentiation potential of ASCs in vitro by stabilizing the expression of HIF-1\u03b1 in ASCs, and DMOG-treated ASCs had an increased bone healing capacity and promoted local revascularization in critical defects (22) . In the present study, we investigated the efficacy of implanting DMOG-treated ASCs to treat early-stage corticosteroid-induced ONFH.",

In the present model, osteonecrosis was induced by a combination of LPS and MPS to mimic the pathological mechanism of steroid-induced ONFH. It has been reported that this inductive protocol has a high incidence of ONFH, and resulted in nearly no death, and suggested that numerous histopathological and pathogenetic features of steroid-induced ONFH in rabbits are similar to those observed in human early-stage ONFH (25) . Therefore, the steroid-induced rabbit ONFH model may be effective for testing the efficacy of the method developed for treatment of steroid-associated ONFH for clinical application and confirmation of their long-term effects in prevention of subchondral bone collapse of the hips.",

Micro-CT and histological results indicated there was increased bone regeneration in the normal ASCs group than in the group that underwent core decompression only, which suggests that ASCs could improve bone healing on their own. Increased newly formed bone was observed in the DMOG-treated ASCs group than in the normal ASCs group, which indicated DMOG could enhance the bone healing capacity of ASCs in the necrotic area. Micro-CT and immunohistochemistry detection of CD31 showed that vessels formation was also increased in the DMOG-treated ASCs group than in the other three groups. This may be because DMOG could increase the expression and secretion of certain angiogenic factors in ASCs in vivo by stabilizing the HIF-1\u03b1 expression in cells, which has been demonstrated by previous experiments (43) . It is hypothesized that angiogenesis is closely associated with osteogenesis, and that neovascularization is an favorable element in bone regeneration. Therefore, the improved local blood supply may also contribute to bone healing in the necrotic area.",
