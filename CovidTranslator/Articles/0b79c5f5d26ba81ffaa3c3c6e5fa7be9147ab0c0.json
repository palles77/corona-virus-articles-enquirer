            "text": "Although they represent only a small population of immune cells, cd-T cells exhibit features characteristic of both innate and adaptive immunity and play an indispensable role in host defense, immune surveillance and homeostasis. [1] [2] [3] [4] In humans, cd-T cells constitute approximately 1%-5% of circulating T cells, and most of them bear the Vc9Vd2 T-cell receptor (TCR). 5, 6 Human Vc9Vd2-T cells can be specifically activated in an HLA-unrestricted manner by small non-peptidic phosphoantigens, which are metabolites of the isoprenoid biosynthesis pathways. 7 It is known that isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP), an intermediate produced through the mevalonate pathway, can selectively activate and expand human Vc9Vd2-T cells. [8] [9] [10] Pharmacological compounds, such as the aminobisphosphonate pamidronate (PAM), which is commonly used for the treatment of osteoporosis, can activate and expand human Vc9Vd2-T cells by inducing the intracellular accumulation of IPP. 8, 11 cd-T cells are broadly reactive against different viruses, 12-18 such as herpes viruses (herpes simplex virus, cytomegalovirus, human herpes virus-6), vaccinia virus, influenza virus, coxsackie B virus and human or simian immunodeficiency virus (HIV/SIV), indicating a role for these lymphocytes in antiviral immune responses. Cell-mediated cytotoxicity is the major mechanism to eliminate virus-infected cells and thus to eliminate potential sources of new virus. Previously, using influenza virus-infected human monocyte-derived macrophages, we showed that IPP-expanded human Vc9Vd2-T cells had cytotoxic activity against virus-infected monocyte-derived macrophages. 10 However, macrophages are not the major target cells for influenza virus infection, despite the influenza virus' ability to replicate in human macrophages. 19 Human lung alveolar epithelial cells, as the major target cells for influenza virus infection, are a more reliable target to investigate the antiviral role of cd-T cells. Recently, we demonstrated that IPPexpanded human Vc9Vd2-T cells had a non-cytolytic effect on human influenza virus by releasing IFN-c in virus-infected lung alveolar epithelial cells. 20 However, whether these cells have cytolytic effects in influenza virus-infected lung alveolar epithelial cells, and subsequently contribute to virus clearance, is still unknown.",

This is not surprising, as A549 cells are immortalized human alveolar epithelial cells and express high levels of MIC A/B, Fas, FasL, DR4 and DR5. Importantly, comparing this to A549 cells without virus infection, PAM-expanded Vc9Vd2-T cells had significantly higher cytotoxic activity against influenza virus-infected A549 cells. Indeed, the expression of MIC A/B and DR5 was also upregulated in A549 cells after influenza virus infection. Whether these upregulated molecules, or even some other undefined molecules, contribute to their higher cytotoxic activity against virus-infected cells will need to be determined in further studies.",

The cytotoxic activity of PAMexpanded Vc9Vd2-T cells is dependent on cell-to-cell contact and requires NKG2D activation. The pathways of perforin-granzyme B, TRAIL and Fas-FasL are also involved in their cytotoxicity. Our study provides insight into the effector functions of Vc9Vd2-T cells against influenza A virus in the human body. Targeting these cells by commercially available PAM could potentially offer an alternative treatment for influenza virus infection.",
