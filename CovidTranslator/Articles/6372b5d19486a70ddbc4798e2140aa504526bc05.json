Method: The 1995 Kikwit Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (formally Zaire) is one of the most well studied epidemics to have occurred to date. Many of the lessons learned from identifying, containing and treating that epidemic are applicable to future viral outbreaks, natural disasters and bioterrorist attacks. This is due to Ebola's highly contagious nature and high mortality rate. Results: When an outbreak occurs, it often produces fear in the community and causes the basic practice of medicine to be altered. Changes seen at Kikwit included limited physical examinations, hesitance to give intravenous medications and closure of supporting hospital facilities. The Kikwit Ebola outbreak also provided beneficial psychological insight into how patients, staff and the general community respond to a biological crisis and how this will affect physicians working in an epidemic. Conclusions: General lessons from the outbreak include the importance of having simple, well-defined triage procedures; staff who are flexible and able to adapt to situations with unknowns; and the need to protect staff physically and emotionally to ensure a sustained effort to provide care.",

The most recent outbreak was identified on November 27, 2007 , and involved 51 cases in western Uganda [1] (Table 1) . To date, more than 1000 human deaths have been linked to the Ebola virus [1] . Recent Ebola outbreaks have been a study in infection control and medical practice during disasters where health infrastructures were overwhelmed, information was limited and supplies were scarce. Even though most Ebola outbreaks have occurred in third-world countries, there are many practical lessons that can be applied if a hemorrhagic fever outbreak should occur in the United States. As the recent New Orleans/Katrina experience and the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in Toronto highlight, even first-world hospital systems can be overwhelmed by disasters and be forced to perform with inadequate information, supplies, medical staff and social support. The Kikwit Ebola outbreak of 1995 was one of the most well studied infectious epidemics and one of the first times that the Ebola virus was treated in a hospital setting. The lessons learned from this outbreak are still applicable to this day.",

The world community was asked for help 2 days later by the government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo [6, 8] . On May 8, the Congolese authorities decided to close the other surrounding health facilities near Kikwit in an attempt to prevent the spread of the infection and the subsequent destruction of the remaining health care infrastructure [8] . A definitive diagnosis of Ebola was not made until May 9 or 10 (depending on the literature cited) [2, 7, 8] . Between May 10 and May 19, nine international medical teams, including the World Health Organization (WHO), Doctors Without Borders and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), arrived, bringing supplies and knowledge [5, 8] . The arriving teams helped to augment the understaffed hospital, provided barrier supplies and disinfectant, improved the quality of the isolation unit's effectiveness, assisted in developing safer burial procedures and improved the triage system for sick patients. The secondary health facilities were not reopened until May 20 and even then they only dealt with medical and surgical emergencies [8] .",

Symptoms seen in terminal patients included obtundation, anuria, shock, hiccups, tachypnea and a period of fever, which would resolve to normothermia 2 days before death [24] . It was noted that disease transmission only occurred during symptomatic periods and not during latency or convalescence [10, 12, [14] [15] [16] . The latency period (time from exposure to time of becoming symptomatic) ranged from 2 days to 3 weeks [24] . Unfortunately, exposure history was often unreliable because patients did not know when they were exposed or would lie to avoid being sent to the isolation unit, which was viewed as a death sentence.",

Similar stressors were reported among health care staff in Asia and Canada during the SARS epidemic [21, 23, [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] . In the Congo, it was common for staff to develop psychosomatic symptoms similar to those seen in Ebola patients. Symptoms of headache, fatigue, muscle pains and perceived fever were most common [13] . For the most part, the staff did very well during the initial phase of the crisis because they were busy and did not have time to ruminate about or fully assess their situation [13] . Once the epidemic became more \"routine,\" staff began to develop more emotional and psychological problems. Many of the staff felt underappreciated during and after the crisis and did not feel that their sacrifices were recognized. The nursing staff felt that they were at the greatest risk due to close patient contact [10] . The staff who stayed during the crisis had a strong sense of duty and were heavily vested in their professional role as a coping mechanism.",

As seen in the Kikwit outbreak, it took 4 months before it was clear that an outbreak was occurring and to identify the infectious agent. This would be a more dramatic problem if the epidemic resulted from a biological weapon attack utilizing multiple agents simultaneously, making it difficult for treating physicians to recognize one disease's symptoms and isolate the pathogens responsible [20, 40] . Even with known diseases such as Ebola, where there was some basic science information available, there were still several important unknowns that needed to be answered. (What strain of agent is involved? Has the virus mutated? Is the data accurate and applicable to this situation?) In the recent SARS outbreaks, there were disagreements between hospital administrators and nurses over what level of isolation precautions were necessary to protect staff [22, 23, 41] . If an infectious outbreak such as Ebola, SARS or avian flu occurs, and if supplies are available, it is best to assume that most infectious transmission routes and provide protection until proven otherwise. This sends a message to the staff that their interests, safety and concerns (e.g., fear of infecting their own family) are being addressed and that the institution recognizes the risks they are taking and is trying to protect them, as well as their patients. This outbreak did demonstrate that with the proper supplies and precautions, the risk to staff can be significantly reduced even when there are unknowns.",

As the Kikwit Ebola outbreak demonstrated, during massive viral epidemics, surge capacity is decreased, not increased [21, 23] . Instead of being able to render aid (e.g., personnel or bed space), surrounding hospitals were actually shut down by the government in order to prevent the spread of the infection. The ability of outside staff being used to help augment existing staff shortages rarely occurs during a true emergency since other facilities do not want to share staff and distant staff wish to avoid exposure and the risk of death. Also, a viral outbreak (i.e., avian flu) could potentially go on for months to years, making the longterm use of outside personnel impractical [21, 23] . Hospitals need to have plans in place that define how they will function for a prolonged period of time with at least a 40-50% reduction in staff [23] . Whatever plans are enacted, there needs to be provision for handling routine medical emergencies such as heart attacks, surgical emergencies and pregnancies [21] . These plans also need to make provisions that assume that other facilities will have closed and that their institution is the only functional hospital for their region. As was seen in Kikwit and with Hurricane Katrina, it took approximately 1-2 weeks for outside help to arrive and be functionally implemented [21] .",

It is important to maintain teamwork and effective leadership while at the same time giving individuals the opportunity to provide input into the decisions that affect their lives. It is often the nursing staff who feels the greatest level of stress due to their constant contact with sick patients, who may not be improving despite the nursing staff's best efforts [23] . Physicians usually cope somewhat better with this situation because they are in a position to make treatment decisions and are less directly involved in implementing patient care [23] . It is important for administrators and doctors to be receptive to suggestions from nursing staff and support personnel. Input is empowerment and provides a sense that these critical staff retain some control over their situation. If suggestions are not acted on, clear explanations as to why they were not should be provided and alternatives should be explored. Administration needs to be supportive of staff and not be seen as pedantic and overly controlling. In cases where staff and support personnel did not feel appreciated or listened to, there was a high degree of dissatisfaction and an increased occurrence of absenteeism and staff strikes, which further reduced personnel in an already-strained system [22, 23] .",

Physicians need to realize that their patients will be frightened and may potentially lie about symptoms and exposure risk. Patients may see health care providers as the enemy due to the providers' power to quarantine them. Being placed in quarantine may be seen as a \"death sentence,\" which could result in the populace avoiding health officials or in violence being directed toward health officials. It is important for medical personnel to see these reactions for what they are: misguided but selfprotective behaviors, manifestations of the illness (e.g., delirium) and the patient's fear of being sick. If medical staff do not appreciate the source of these behaviors, they may question their role, become hostile and experience a loss of professional identity and a breakdown of their own protective denial. (Why should some individuals place themselves at risk when they are being viewed as the enemy?) Due to this potential antagonistic relationship and the possible delirium that can be caused by the infection, doctors and support staff need to be ready to deal with agitated patients both mentally and physically. Mental preparation is realizing the level of fear a patient is experiencing. The physical preparation is being comfortable with and willing to use pharmacological agents (e.g., haloperidol), physical restraint or both.",

General lessons from the outbreak include the importance of having simple, well-defined triage procedures; staff who are flexible and able to adapt to situations with unknowns; and the need to protect staff physically and emotionally to ensure a sustained effort to provide care. Unfortunately, many of the lessons learned and applied to the training of local personnel during the Kikwit outbreaks were rapidly forgotten and had to be relearned and reinstituted during later Ebola outbreaks in the Congo and elsewhere [43, 44] . These lessons also applied well in the \"first\" world SARS epidemic and following Hurricane Katrina (Table 5 ). Table 5 Lessons learned from the Kikwit Ebola outbreak of 1995 Loss of surge capacity due to neighboring hospitals closing to reduce spread of infection can occur. Hospitals should prepare to be self-sufficient for at least 7 days before outside help and supplies can arrive. Hospitals need long-term crisis management plans due to viral epidemics lasting for months. Medical staff will need to be flexible in how they deliver medical care (e.g., modified physical examinations) and, where possible, to try to develop standardized procedures based on reality of the situation (e.g., triage protocol based primarily on observation and limited exam). Supply shortages could occur due to the nature of supplies needed in a viral infection (e.g., barrier protection), the increased number of supplies needed and the extended duration for which supplies are needed. Expect a loss of staff for multiple reasons (e.g., abandoning post, illness, inability to obtain replacement staff). Expect staff who stay to do well during initial crisis, but potentially experience emotional symptoms such as psychosomatic symptoms when crisis becomes routine. Need to provide incentives and recognition to staff/volunteers to maintain morale both during and after the crisis. Provide for needs of staff and families, such as food and security. When possible, provide special accommodations and recognition to staff who become ill as a way to show staff who are still working that their contributions and sacrifices are appreciated.",
