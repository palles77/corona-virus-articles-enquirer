The extracted samples have been analyzed by a developed reversed-phase liquid chromatography with ultraviolet detection. The separation was performed by a Eurospher-100 C 8 reversed-phase column (250 9 4.6 mm i.d., 5 lm) and the mobile phase consisted of methanol:acetonitrile:water:glacial acetic acid (30:30:40:1 v/v/v/v) with a flow rate of 0.8 mL min -1 . The extraction procedure has been screened by a two level full factorial design for determination of statistically significant parameters. Thereafter, the identified parameters, extraction temperature, time and solvent volume were optimized by a Box-Behnken design. The proposed mathematical model was based on analysis of variance results and correctly explained the behavior of the response in the experimental domain. R 2 value adjusted for numbers of degrees of freedom was 0.9915 and P-value for lack of fit, 0.8499 at the 95% confidence level, P > 0.05. The optimal condition identified were extraction temperature, 70\u00b0C, time, 13.8 min and solvent volume 2.0 mL. To evaluate the applicability of the proposed MAE method, results were compared with those obtained with the liquid extraction method. Extraction efficiency and precision were higher when MAE has been used. The proposed method allows extracting the glycyrrhizin in a small quantity of solvent and faster than the liquid extraction method.",

The principle of heating using microwave energy is based on the direct effect of microwaves on molecules by ionic conduction and dipole rotation. If MAE is performed in closed vessels, extractions can be carried out at temperatures above the boiling point of the solvent, thus increasing extraction speed and efficiency. Also, MAE requires much lower volume of organic solvent, reduces extraction time and allow the preparation of multiple samples in one step [23, 24] .",

The precision was better for MAE than for LE. Plant tissue consists of cells surrounded by walls. The cells exist in the form of glands that are filled with active compounds such as glycyrrhizin. A characteristic of such glands is that their skin is very thin and can be very easily destroyed, therefore, the type of extraction method can influence of recovery results. The leaching and milling had important effects on extraction of essential oil and active ingredient compounds from plants in classical methods such as LE. Also, the plant matrix has impermeable cores covered by an organic boundary layer. The transfer mechanism is governed by capillary flow and depends upon solvent viscosity. Virot et al. [30] reported that in LE, mass transfer occurs from the inside to the outside while heat transfer occurs from the outside to the inside.
