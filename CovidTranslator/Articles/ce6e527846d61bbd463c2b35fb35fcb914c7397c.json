The available literature demonstrates that classifiable members of the genus Ranavirus enter cells via multiple and complicated routes. Here, we demonstrated the underlying cellular entry mechanism of soft-shelled turtle iridovirus (STIV) using green fluorescence tagged recombinant virus. Treatment with chlorpromazine, sucrose, ethyl-isopropyl amiloride, chloroquine or bafilomycin A1 all significantly decreased STIV infection, suggesting that STIV uses clathrin-mediated endocytosis and macropinocytosis to enter cells via a pH-dependent pathway. Depletion of cellular cholesterol with methyl-\u03b2-cyclodextrin significantly inhibited STIV entry, but neither filipin III nor nystatin did, suggesting that STIV entry was cholesterol dependent but caveola independent. Treatment with dynasore, genistein, ML-7 or cytochalasin D all significantly inhibited STIV infection, indicating that Rac GTPase and myosin II activity were required for the macropinocytosis-like pathway as well as actin polymerization. Our findings suggest that the molecular events involved in STIV entry are not identical to those of other ranavirus isolates. Our results also extend our understanding of the molecular mechanism of iridovirus entry and pathogenesis.",

Viruses often take advantage of multiple endocytic pathways to enter cells. Clathrin-mediated endocytosis is the best characterized pathway, exploited by many viruses such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), rabies virus, astrovirus and frog virus FV3 [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] . Apart from clathrin-mediated entry, caveola-dependent endocytosis is an alternative well characterized pathway for virus entry. Compared to clathrin, the internalization of caveolae is slower and the resulting vesicles do not become acidified [9] . Currently, caveoladependent endocytosis is known to be exploited by several viruses, including Simian virus (SV)40, tiger frog virus (TFV), echovirus 1 and hepatitis B virus (HBV) [10] [11] [12] [13] .",

From the genus Ranavirus, FV3 was the first iridovirus to have its entry mechanism investigated. In mammalian Handling Editor: Chan-Shing Lin. cells (BHK-21), enveloped FV3 particles are internalized by adsorptive endocytosis via coated pits and then move through endosomes and finally lysosomes, suggesting that FV3 entry is via receptor-mediated clathrin endocytosis [20] . In contrast, recent studies demonstrated different mechanisms used by different iridoviruses. Both TFV and infectious spleen and kidney necrosis virus (ISKNV) enter different cells via caveola-dependent but not clathrindependent endocytosis [13, 21] . Singapore grouper iridovirus (SGIV) entry into host cells occurs via clathrin-mediated endocytosis and macropinocytosis in a pH-dependent manner [17] . The different endocytic pathways used by various iridoviruses implies a complex process in the early steps of iridovirus infection. Soft-shelled turtle iridovirus (STIV) was isolated from a diseased soft-shelled turtle (Trionyx sinensis) [22] . Complete genomic sequence analysis indicates that STIV and FV3 are likely different strains of the same viral species belonging to the Ranavirus genus [23] . In vitro, STIV infection induces typical apoptosis and evokes the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway [24] . Moreover, fluorescence-tagged recombinant STIV [enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP)-STIV] has been successfully constructed to study infective dynamics and evaluate viral replication [25] [26] [27] . Although the genome sequences of FV3 and TFV share high identity, the endocytic pathway used by them differs completely [13, 20] . Whether the entry pathway of STIV was different from other reported ranavirus isolates remained unknown. Here, we demonstrated the underlying cellular entry mechanisms of STIV using EGFP-STIV. Our results shed new light on the early events of iridovirus infection in lower vertebrates.",

As large DNA viruses, iridoviruses have attracted much attention because of their impact on ecological instability and their role in heavy economic losses in the aquaculture industry. Although rapid progress has been made in the field of iridovirus functional genomics, the early events [13, 19, 21] . Clathrin-mediated endocytosis, a well-characterized endocytic pathway, is exploited by a number of viruses to enter host cells [6, 7] . CPZ is known to cause a clathrin lattice to assemble on endosomal membranes, and at the same time, prevent the assembly of coated pits at the plasma membrane [9] . After treatment with CPZ, the cellular entry of many viruses, including HIV, HCV, African swine fever virus (ASFV), HBV and rabies virus, was significantly inhibited, suggesting that clathrin-mediated endocytosis is involved in the entry process of these viruses [6, 7, 9] . In our study, the percentage fluorescence indicated that EGFP-STIV-infected cells and protein synthesis of major capsid proteins were significantly decreased by treatment with CPZ. As another inhibitor of clathrin-dependent endocytosis, hyperosmotic sucrose prevents clathrin and its adaptors from interacting [29] . Our results showed that treatment with hyperosmotic sucrose also decreased virus entry, similar to CPZ. The number of STIV-infected cells was significantly inhibited, as well as protein synthesis of MCP, after treatment with CQ or BAF; both of which are known to prevent endosome acidification. The entry of STIV to FHM cells was significantly decreased by dynasore, an inhibitor of GTPase dynamin, which is required for clathrin-mediated endocytosis. We propose that STIV enters host cells through clathrin-mediated endocytosis in a pH-dependent manner. Notably, clathrin-mediated endocytosis was also reported to be crucial for FV3, but not for TFV entry, although they are different strains of the same species. It is proposed that the entry mechanisms of these viruses were investigated in different cell types [13, 20] . Whether clathrin-mediated endocytosis is involved in TFV infection in fish or frog cells needs further investigation. In contrast to clathrin-mediated endocytosis, caveoladependent endocytosis is a newly characterized endocytosis pathway that defines the movement of caveolins with caveola-derived vesicles to multiple compartments in the cytoplasm. Sterol-binding reagents such as filipin III, nystatin and \u03b2MCD are usually used to impair caveolamediated endocytosis due to the high abundance of cholesterol and sphingolipids in caveolae [9, 28] . Treatment with filipin III or nystatin decreased the cellular entry of some viruses, including SV40, coronavirus, TFV and ISKNV, suggesting that these viruses used caveola-dependent endocytosis during their life cycle [10, 13, 21, 30] . In our experiments, treatment with \u03b2MCD decreased the percentage of STIV-infected cells in a dose-dependent manner, while neither nystatin nor filipin III showed obvious effects on STIV entry. This phenomenon was also described in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus infection [28] . Given that cholesterol depletion by \u03b2MCD inhibits the formation and budding of clathrin-coated pits, we propose that \u03b2MCD inhibits STIV entry; not through interfering with caveola-dependent endocytosis, but likely by affecting the integrity of membrane lipid microdomains, or inhibiting clathrin-mediated endocytosis [31, 32] .",

            "text": "Although there are numerous reports that many viruses enter cells via clathrin-dependent or caveola/lipid raft-mediated endocytosis, increased attention has recently been paid to macropinocytosis due to its critical role in virus entry [14, 33, 34] . EIPA, a specific inhibitor of Na + /H + exchanger, is critical for macropinosome formation, and is usually used to evaluate the impact of macropinocytosis on virus entry [35, 36] . Treatment with EIPA impairs the entry of many mammalian viruses, including EBOV, ASFV, vaccinia virus and human cytomegalovirus, suggesting that macropinocytosis is involved in the entry of these viruses [16, [37] [38] [39] . To ascertain whether macropinocytosis is an alternative route for STIV entry, the effect of EIPA on STIV infection was determined. In STIV-infected cells, treatment with EIPA inhibited virus entry and protein synthesis in a dose-dependent manner. Recent studies have also demonstrated that several cell factors are critical for macropinocytosis in virus entry. Inhibition of PAK-1 and myosin II activity decrease the entry of ASFV and influenza A virus, which shows that these cellular factors are important for macropinocytic uptake [37, 40] . [35, 37, 40] . In our study, inhibition of PAK1 activity by IPA-3 and inhibition of myosin II activity by ML-7 both significantly prevented STIV entry. Treatment with cyto D also significantly blocked STIV infection. Therefore, we conclude that STIV enters cells via macropinocytosis. Notably, the macropinocytosis specific inhibitor EIPA was not used in previous studies on the cellular entry of FV3, TFV and INKNV [13, 20, 21] , but disruption of actin microfilaments by cytochalasin B significantly inhibited TFV entry [13] , suggesting that macropinocytosis is also involved in TFV entry. Recent studies have revealed that SGIV enters host cells via both clathrin-mediated endocytosis and macropinocytosis in a pH-dependent manner [19] . We propose that macropinocytosis is a novel alternative pathway exploited by iridovirus to enter cells.",

Interestingly, caveola-mediated endocytosis was not involved in STIV and SGIV entry in vitro, but crucial for the entry of TFV into HepG2 Cells and ISKNV into fish fry cells (Fig. 6) .
