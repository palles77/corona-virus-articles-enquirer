They are pleomorphie enveloped particles, averaging 10 nm diameter, containing RNA and essential lipid. They all bear unique definite projections. The eoronaviruses multiply in cytoplasm and mature by budding through endoplasmic retieulum (18) . Some eoronaviruses cause respiratory problems in birds and man, others are associated with enteritis in different species and some eoronaviruses affect multiple organs (13) .

Similar observations were made by I~EYNOLDS and GAgWES (16) in examining the TGEV-FIPV relationship.
