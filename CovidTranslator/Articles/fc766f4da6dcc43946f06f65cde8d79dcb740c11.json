MERS-CoV possesses a unique positive-sense single-stranded RNA and can undergo rapid mutation in the viral genome. This results in antigenic switching and genetic variation, finally leading to the emergence of novel and new MERS-CoV subtypes which are uncontrollable by vaccines. Researchers are also finding difficulties to sort out therapeutic intervention strategies for MERS-CoV. This virus can spread from human to human, but transmission from dromedary camels to humans plays a crucial epidemiological significance. Dromedary camel acts as \"gene mixing vessels\" for MERS-CoV and these virus particles undergo rapid change in them. Viral receptors called dipeptidyl peptidase-4 are important receptors for attachment and spread of MERS-CoV in humans. The current method of laboratory confirmation is through real-time polymerase chain reaction on bronchoalveolar lavage, sputum and tracheal aspirates. Unfortunately, till today there are no definite anti-viral drugs available for MERS-CoV.",

According to the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control, it was estimated that out of a total of 1082 MERS-CoV cases, there were 439 deaths thereby mortality rate leading to whooping 41% . As per the World Health Organization estimates, the fatality rate surged to 37%. MERS-CoV patients have acquired this deadly infection through various sources, namely, infected humans, camels, bats, other domesticated animals and pets (World Health Organization, 2015) . The very nature and special feature of coronavirus is its ability to undergo rapid genetic rearrangement and profound molecular variation in its ssRNA. This rearrangement and variation of the viral genome resulting in new antigenic subtypes, leads to difficulties in developing vaccines and therapeutic interventions (Chu et al. 2016) .

Based on molecular, genetic and antigenic studies, it was established that MERS-CoV is unique and different from severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus and common cold coronaviruses. Because of this fact, earlier MERS-CoV was called \"Saudi SARS\" (Azhar et al. 2016) . This notorious virus was first identified and isolated in Saudi Arabia by Dr Ali Mohamed Zaki from a patient suffering from pneumonia-like illness, and these isolates exhibited cytopathic effects like syncytia formation.

The two non-structural proteins (NSPs) initiate genomic replication and RNA synthesis. The huge replicase gene surrounds 5 0 proximal side of RNA genome. Translation of ORF1a gives rise to polyprotein 1a (pp1a) and ribosomal frame shifting makes translation of ORF1b to give pp1ab. MERS-CoV uses one or two papain-like protease to release NSPs.

            "text": "MERS-CoV exhibits its degree of pathogenicity based on the host. It elicits maximum pathogenic potential, especially in humans. This is due to the fact that MERS-CoV shows a strong tropism for bronchial non-ciliated epithelia. During this time, it is proved that virus also arrests host bronchial IFN synthesis (Coleman et al. 2015; Mielech et al. 2016) . At this juncture, it should be noted that most of other viruses causing respiratory diseases attack and damage epithelial cilia, including influenza type A. Studies revealed that cellular receptors for MERS-CoV is exopeptidase (angiotensin converting enzyme 2) (Coleman et al. 2015) . Moreover, it was found that neutralization of angiotensin converting enzyme 2 by specific antibodies did not arrest the spread of infection into bronchus and lung alveolus. Extensive studies showed that another functional cellular receptors called dipeptidyl peptidase-4 were also involved in the severity of disease spread in the lungs due to MERS-CoV (de Wit et al. 2015) . Moreover, receptors for dipeptidyl peptidase-4 are also located in nephrons of kidneys and heart. During the acute stage of the MERS-CoV infection, there is severe viremia, leading to the spread of MERS-CoV virus particles in blood stream. At this point, MERS-CoV exhibits the hall mark of infection leading to not only to the damage of lungs but also kidneys and heart, thereby resulting in respiratory, renal and cardiac failure, ultimately leading to coma and death (vanBoheemen et al. 2016) . The severity is worsened by concurrent secondary bacterial infections. Recent research showed that bacterial infections due to Staphylococcus aureus, Group A Streptococcus, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae type b augment the pathogenic potential of MERS-CoV, particularly in humans. These bacteria particularly dwell in the oral cavities, tonsils and pharynx of humans . Another interesting fact is that the reservoir host dromedary camels and other animals do not exhibit the presence of dipeptidyl peptidase-4 receptors in their kidneys and heart. In humans, after the entry of MERS-CoV viral particles in to lung alveoles, alveolar macrophages fail to contain the spread of infection. The strong host cellular immune response and cytokine release lead to inflammation and fluid accumulation in lungs. This will result in the characteristic symptoms of MERS-CoV; high fever, chills, rigors, severe cough, dyspnoea and hypovolemic shock . Many patients exhibited common symptoms of pneumonia, whereas a significant number of patients expressed symptoms of chronic obstructive pulmonary syndrome like disease. Another large number of patients also revealed laryngotracheobronchitis, which is called \"croup\". The patterns of disease due to MERS-CoV also differed among different age groups. Clinical cases, morbidity and mortality rates due to MERS-CoV infections are more common and high (80%) in the age group of 35e45 years. Astonishingly, the severity of MERS-CoV is lower (40%) in the higher age groups, particularly above 55 years (Lei et al. 2015) .",

Different ways of transmission of MERS-CoV have been documented (Corman et al. 2015) . They include dromedary camel to human mode, bats to camels, among camels, cattle to man, dogs to humans, cats to man, bats to humans and finally man to man transmission. Human to human spread is very effective and common in close contacts and crowded surroundings. Nosocomial, hospital-borne outbreaks have also been reported in many instances. There have been reported incidences of spread from patients to health care workers (Song et al. 2015) . In MERS-CoV epidemiology, dromedary camels play an important role because these animals act as reservoir host. Dromedary camels also act as \"gene mixing vessels\". When two different strains of MERS-CoV, from two different sources, infect dromedary camels, these two genetically different MERS-CoV exchange their \u00fessRNA resulting in the development (mutation) of new subtypes of MERS-CoV. The stunning features of these new subtypes of MERS-CoV have new antigens and novel virulence genes. In Saudi Arabia, there were possible cases of human transmission after drinking camel milk. But, there are no cases documented in humans through ingestion of camel meat (de Wit et al. 2016) .",

            "text": "MERS-CoV causes severe, life threatening and rapidly spreading Middle East respiratory syndrome not only in Middle East region, but throughout the world. Dromedary camels and bats play an important role in the spread of MERS-CoV. Several nosocomial infections due to MERS-CoV have also been reported worldwide. Several viral SPs and NSPs are critical for the molecular virulence of MERS-CoV. Because of the \u00fessRNA, MERS-CoV can undergo molecular rearrangement leading to antigenic change, genetic variation and mutation. This attributes to the emergence of new and novel subtypes of MERS-CoV in the human populations. These unique subtypes are difficult to control by vaccinations and therapeutic intervention strategies. Another important issue faced by scientists and molecular virologists is related to these new MERS-CoV viral particles which possess enhanced molecular virulence, thus leading to increased pathogenicity and a more rapid spread than their parental strains. Studies revealed that dromedary camels act as \"gene mixing vessels\" for MERS-CoV. Prevention is mainly based on avoiding contact with dromedary camels and focussing on nosocomial infection outbreaks. Researchers are constantly trying to develop anti-viral drugs to combat MERS-CoV, but till today there is no breakthrough. The perspective of what can we expect in the future of this field is developing effective vaccine, conducting detailed studies on molecular research on mechanism of mutation and genetic recombination occurring in MERS-CoV.",
