Experimental assays show that titanium containing polyoxotungstates have anti-influenza-virus activity. In this paper, the binding mechanisms of five isomers of di-Ti-substituted polyoxotungstate, [\u03b1-1,2-PTi 2 W 10 O 40 ] 7-(\u03b1-1,2), [\u03b1-1,6-PTi 2 W 10 O 40 ] 7-(\u03b1-1,6), [\u03b1-1,5-PTi 2 W 10 O 40 ] 7-(\u03b1-1,5), [\u03b1-1,4-PTi 2 W 10 O 40 ] 7-(\u03b1-1,4) and [\u03b1-1,11-PTi 2 W 10 O 40 ] 7-(\u03b1-1,11), to five subtypes of influenza virus A neuraminidase (FluV-A NA) were investigated in the context of aqueous solution by using molecular docking and molecular dynamics studies. The results show that the isomer \u03b1-1,2 is superior to other isomers as a potential inhibitor to neuraminidase. The positively charged arginine residues around the active site of NA could be induced by negatively charged POM to adapt themselves and could form salt bridge interactions and hydrogen bond interactions with POM. The binding free energies of POM/NA complexes range from -5.36 to -8.31 kcal mol -1 . The electrostatic interactions are found to be the driving force during the binding process of POM to NA. The conformational analysis shows that POM tends to bind primarily with N1 and N8 at the edge of the active pocket, which causes the conformational change of the pincers structure comprising residue 347 and loop 150. Whereas, the active pockets of N2, N9 and N4 are found to be more spacious, which allows POM to enter into the active pockets directly and anchor there firmly. This study shows that negatively charged ligand as POM could induce the reorganization of the active site of NA and highlights POM as a promising inhibitor to NA despite the ever increasing mutants of NA.",

            "text": "Influenza virus can be divided into three genera: A, B and C, based on the antigenic properties of the viral nucleoprotein. Among them, only the influenza virus A (FluV-A) has the ability to cause serious pandemics. It has two surface glycoproteins, hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA), which have been found to have 16 and 9 variants (indicated by H1-H16 and N1-N9), respectively. The three pandemics in history are Spanish pandemic in 1918 caused by FluV subtype H1N1, Asian pandemic in 1957, where HA and NA were replaced by H2 and N2, respectively, and Hong Kong pandemic in 1968, where subtype H3N2 played the main role. In 1997 the new high pathogenic FluV subtype H5N1 appeared in Hong Kong, and later in 2003 it became more fearful [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] . It is a top priority to develop new drugs with long-lasting activity, despite the increasing shift and drift of FluV-A. There have been a lot of inhibitors developed to inhibit a broader range of mutants of FluV-A [8, 9] . NA inhibitors (NAIs) are considered to be the most valuable and promising in drug market. NA could bind to the sialic acid and cut off the binding interaction of HA and the sialic acid, thus enabling the progeny virions to leave the infected cells and spread to other host cells [3, 10] . However, the longterm treatments by the currently available NAI drugs (oseltamivir and zanamivir) triggered out various resistant mu-tants in NA [11] [12] [13] . More recently, the drug Peramivir has become attractive for their inhibition to all nine NA subtypes and is at least as active as oseltamivir and zanamivir against H5N1 viruses in vitro. However, it has low oral bioavailability in humans. The Phase II study is underway to evaluate single-dose intramuscular peramivir for uncomplicated seasonal influenza [14] [15] [16] .",

In order to investigate whether the binding process of POM to N1 could be better described by induced-fit theory, we used the module Affinity to implement a flexible docking study on the configuration which had the highest score in the rigid docking. To inspect the induced-fit binding process of POM into the active pocket of NA, the residues in the active pocket and in the vicinity of POM were totally free during the flexible docking simulation as well as in the MD simulation. The flexible region was soaked with two 0.5-nm layers of TIP3P water model to mimic the aqueous solution and the water molecules with a distance of 2.8 \u00c5 from POM were removed getting rid of the improper contacts. In order to relax the unrealistic contacts of the inner layer water molecules, we simply minimized the system with all the coordinates of atoms fixed, except for the inner water layer molecules. We consider such a model plausible to simulate the solvent environment in the following two points. First, only the residues in the active pocket of NA were flexible during the simulation. Second, POM had been rigidly docked into the active pocket, with the solvation effect being considered. We just wanted to know the equilibrium conformation of POM in the active pocket in the context of aqueous solution. There are many transition metal atoms in POM, which makes the extensible systematic force field (ESFF) appropriate in modeling such a system. ESFF has the parameters of almost all the elements in the periodic table, and is considered to be able to predict the configuration of organo and inorganic compounds, though it cannot work out a reasonable energetic evaluation. For the peculiar property of POM in covalent bonding and rigidity, the non-bond cutoff was set to be 20 \u00c5, and POM was tethered with the force constant value 100.0 kcal mol -1 \u00c5 2 during the affinity docking process. Energy tolerance was set as 1\u00d710 8 kcal mol -1 . The total conformations to generate were set to be 200, and 10 energetically minimal conformations would be ranked with the decent order of the binding free energy in the resultant trajectory. The outer layer water molecules were fixed to ensure that the inner water molecules would not be evaporated out during the flexible docking and MD simulation procedure.",

Thus isomer \u03b1-1,2 could be the most likely NAI. This is consistent with our previous studies. The terminal oxygens in isomer \u03b1-1,2 are most likely to be protonated thereby making isomer \u03b1-1,2 more active in the reaction. Isomer \u03b1-1,2 manifested the strongest inhibiting activity to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 3c like proteinase (SARS-CoV 3CL pro ) [46, 48] . Zhang et al. claimed that not only does the nominal negative charge of POM appear as a parameter governing the binding process and its consequences, but also the structure, the dimension, molar weight and/or the atomic composition of POM do [32] . According to the cluster analysis there are three possible binding sites for POM on the surface of NA, which are the active pocket, the interface between two NA molecules in a tetramer, and the pore around the four-fold axis of the NA tetramer. The active pocket seems to be the favorite site that POM tends to bind primarily (with the most negative binding energies for almost all of the five NA subtypes). Therefore, the energetically favorable configuration of POM/NA complex in the active-pocket cluster was extracted as the initial conformation of each of the five systems (\u03b1-1,2/N1, \u03b1-1,2/N2, \u03b1-1,2/N4, \u03b1-1,2/N8 and \u03b1-1,2/N9) in the subsequent studies.",

The result shows that the five subtypes of NA can be divided into two groups, with N1, N4 and N8 affiliated to group 1, and N2 and N9 to group 2. On the basis of the alignment results, the three dimensional structures of the five subtypes of NA were superimposed ( Figure 2 ). Compared with group 2, NA of group 1 has another pocket adjacent to the active pocket named 150-cavity in the previous study [38] . The 150-cavity is formed by the outward moving of the loop 150.",

            "text": "The main differences in the binding modes among the five subtypes of NA are attributable to the various conformations and components of residue 347 and loop 150 (Figure 2) . Residue 347 and loop 150 act together as pincers to control the entry of POM into the active pocket. A mutant occurred at residue 347 in group 2, with Tyr347Gln and Tyr347Asn in N2 and N9, respectively. In subtypes of group 1 the phenol side chain of Tyr347 is larger than the amide side chain of Gln347 and Asn347 in that of group 2. The difference between subtypes of group 1 and group 2 can also be illustrated as whether there is a 150-cavity [38] . Compared with group 1, there is a mutant Lys150His in the subtype of group 2, and residues 149 and 150 tend to approach to the center of the active pocket, whereas in group 1 they adopt the opposite conformation, which makes the 150-cavity in group 1 (Figure 3) . However, the 150-cavity seems to be too large to catch POM tightly, therefore the primary binding mode of POM and NA in group 1 is not stable and may proceed to further dynamic changes. By contrast, POM is able to enter the active pocket of NA in group 2 more deeply and anchor there firmly. The differences of residue 347 in the five subtypes of NA are shown in Figure 4 . In group 1, N4 has slightly different features that the phenol side chain rotated out of the pocket almost 120\u00ba compared with N1 and N8. Synchronously, the door is opened for POM to enter the active pocket. Thus N4 subtype shows stronger affinity with POM than N1 and N8, and could reach the level of N2 and N9. The phenol side chain of the residue Tyr347 in N1 and N8 tends to protrude into the center of the pocket as a gate refused the entry of POM. In conclusion, POM exhibited different primary binding modes on the surface of the five subtypes of NA, which mainly arose from the mutant of residue 347 and the deviation of the conformation of loop 150 between and within the two groups. The difference of residue 347, where the mutant happened between group 1 and group 2 and the conformation deviation occurring within group 1, is shown. The isomer \u03b1-1,2 docked into N2 and N9 is displayed rendering ball-and-stick style to illustrate the effects of the difference of the conformation of residue 347. Residues 347 and 346 are indicated in sticks. The coloring scheme is the same as in Figure 2 .",

Figure 5(b) shows that the residue Asp151 is pulled out of the active pocket by forming hydrogen bonds with the near residues such as Gln136 and Gly147. Thus, the door controlled by residue Tyr347 and loop 150 is opened for POM, which then permits POM to enter the active pocket of N1. The positively charged residues, such as Arg430, Arg118, Arg371 and Arg292, approached POM and formed hydrogen bond and salt bridge interactions with negatively charged POM ( Figure 5(a) ). The electrostatic interactions are shown to be the driving force during the process of the formation of POM/NA complex, which is consistent with the following comparison of the electrostatic potential maps of NA before and after the flexible docking.

(1) The results of rigid docking of POM to NA subtypes at a global level showed that the isomer \u03b1-1,2 had the strongest affinity to NA and the favorable binding site was specified to be the active pocket. It is noteworthy that different binding modes were observed in the five NA subtypes. This could be illustrated by the different configurations or mutants of the residues in the active pocket of the five NA subtypes. The main contributions came from the mutant at 347 and the difference of the conformation of loop 150. (2) It was found that the binding of POM to NA caused the conformational change of the active pocket of NA, thus POM was allowed to enter the active pocket. The highly negatively charged POM induced the near positively charged residues, such as Arg118, Arg292, Arg152 and Arg371, to adapt themselves to a more comfortable position and orientation relative to POM. The electrostatic interactions were the driving force during the binding process of POM into the active pockets of NA. (3) The five POM/NA complexes manifested good stability in aqueous solution, and after the affinity and MD simulation they showed stronger binding energy than the primary binding mode. It is consistent with the experimental results by Zhang et al. that the binding of POM to proteins may cause the protein molecule to take an unfolding process [49, 50] . Highly negatively charged POM could induce the conformational change of NA and form a stronger binding mode. Russell et al. claimed that they had to design new inhibitors for group-1 neuraminidases that are selective for the open loop 150 conformation and would thereby have the potential to bind more strongly than oseltamivir or zanamivir [38] . The selective binding mode of POM onto the loop 150 of NA in group 1 caused the conformational changes of the residues in the active pocket and therefore formed stronger binding affinity. Therefore, we expect POM would become a new generation of anti-influenza virus drug. In summary, in this work we specified a new protocol to theoretically study the induced-fit binding process of POM to proteins at the molecular level. It would be complementary or assistive for experiments in discovering new NAIs. Table S1 The DFT calculated MULLIKEN charges of the five isomers of [\u03b1-PTi 2 W 10 O 40 ] 7-.",
