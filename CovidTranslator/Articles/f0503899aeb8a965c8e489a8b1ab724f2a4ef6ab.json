Thus carbohydrate has been suggested to underly a non-primary function for proteins, such as in relatively non-specific interactions with other carbohydrates or macromolecules, stabilization of protein conformation, or protection from proteolysis. This non-specific concept is consistent with both the general similarity in carbohydrate structure on very diverse glycoproteins and the frequent structural microheterogeneity of carbohydrate chains at given sites. The concept is supported in a general sense by the viability of cells whose glycosylation processes have been globally disrupted by mutation or pharmacological inhibitors.",

Sometimes multivalency in the carbohydrate-receptor interaction is crucial. There are additional possible roles for carbohydrate in the transduction of information upon binding to a receptor. The possibility of specific roles for carbohydrate is supported by the existence of numerous unique carbohydrate structures, many of which have been detected as glycoantigens by monoclonal antibodies, with unique distributions in developing and differentiated cells.",

It appears that in general carbohydrate does in fact underlie only roles secondary to a protein's primary function. These secondary roles are simple non-specific ones of protection and stabilization, but often also satisfy the more sophisticated needs of spatial position control and compartmentalization in multicellular eukaryotic organisms. It is suggested that there are advantages, evolutionarily speaking, for the shared use of carbohydrate for non-specific roles and for specific roles primarily as luxury functions to be executed during the processes of cell differentiation and morphogenesis.",

This can be attributed to advancements in methods to detect and isolate new structures, to determine structure, and to modify carbohydrate structures experimentally. Nevertheless, the field continues to experience profound unrest. Many studies have failed to un-cover significant cellular or molecular consequences for dramatic changes in carbohydrate structures. Other studies have pointed to isolated specific roles but no sweeping generalizations of function have been possible. Interpreters of the former studies would attribute apparent specific effects to secondary consequences of changes in carbohydrate on protein structure. Interpreters of the latter studies would argue that the former studies simply failed to ask the right questions of function. It is clear that there is much to be done to extend our knowledge for this particular type of posttranslational modification.",

In particular, this article will attempt to compare and contrast the two prevailing views in the field. As intimated above, one view is that glycosylation plays a relatively non-specific role in maintaining and preserving polypeptide function. The alternate view is that carbohydrate structures participate in numerous specific interactions with discrete protein receptors, and that these interactions lead to predictable modifications in the localization or activity of the glycoprotein. These opposing views will be simply referred to as the non-specific and specific models.",

            "text": "Oligosaccharides linked to asparagine occur in cellular slime molds, yeast, higher plants, insects, and humans, and several essential features of these structures are highly conserved throughout this phylogenetic range (14) . Typically though not invariably, a Glc3Man9GlcNAc2 structure is synthesized on a polyisoprenoid derivative (dolichol-P-P) and transferred en bloc to asparagine residues on polypeptide acceptors forming an N-glycosidic linkage (hence N-linked). The three Glcs are usually trimmed by a tandem pair of a-glucosidases to yield a high mannose N-linked structure. The highmannose structure is variably modified, beginning with removal of mannoses in a typical sequence by a tandem pair of o~-mannosidases. One pathway retains most mannoses but permits additional substitutions of e.g., sulfate and/or phosphate. A second pathway trims down to MansGlcNAc 2 and makes limited additions such as GlcNAc, and sometimes Gal and core-linked Fuc. These are referred to as hybrid structures. The third pathway continues the second pathway to build complex structures usually terminated by sialic acid. There can be two, three or four chains emanating from the branching mannose (and secondary branching Mans) and these structures are accordingly referred to as biantennary, triantennary or tetraantennary complex Nlinked oligosaccharides. The sialic acids, which appear not to precede echinoderms in their evolutionary appearance, comprise a diverse family of sugars (100) . Numerous additional substituents including sulfate, phosphate, methyl groups and others have been documented (8, 9, 161) .",

N-linked glycosylation is not template driven. Only the first step might be considered so, inasmuch there is a necessary but not sufficient requirement of an xasn-x-ser/thr-x sequence for the oligosaccharide acceptor. Protein structure or corfformation has also been shown to influence whether a site becomes glycosylated as well as whether it becomes high mannose, hybrid, or complex (4, 7) or whether it receives a phosphodiester-linked GlcNAc-PO4 (7) or GalNAc-SO 4 (175). A relationship between position in the polypeptide chain (distance from N-to C-terminus) and whether an oligosaccharide becomes high mannose or complex has been observed (6) . Finally these relations are not absolutely determinate, for spontaneous heterogeneity of carbohydrate structures at particular positions has been documented (12, 5, 37) . Changes in structure also result from extracellular influences (see below).",

For example, each step of the pathway can be influenced by enzyme synthesis and turnover, acceptor accessibility, as well as the supply of donor sugar, cofactors such as lipids, divalent cations, etc. The question of accessibility is particularly interesting because sequentially acting enzymes tend not to be mixed but are distributed vectorially through the RER and the multiple compartments of the Golgi. Movement of polypeptides through these compartments appears to be mediated by ATP-dependent dissociative movement of vesicles (142) . Thus glycosylation may conceivably be regulated by the pathway of movement of the acceptor protein. There is also an indication that some glycosyltransferases form supramolecular complexes. Thus, it is possible that certain carbohydrate structures are dictated not only by vesicle movement, but also by which enzyme cluster initially captures the acceptor protein (122) .",

GAGs are anionic polymers which hydrate to form enlarged domains which can interact with one another, as well as with polycationic polymers such as collagen and with other glycoproteins (3) . A three dimensional space is thus defined by polysaccharide, protein, and the bound water which provides an environment for cells. Convection and diffusion are modified, and fluctuations in ionic strength and pH are minimized.

The polyanionic nature of the carbohydrate found on some cell surfaces probably results in marked cation and pH differences in this region relative to the surrounding medium (177). It has recently been proposed that the heterogeneity of carbohydrate structure found on proteins of this region might result in minor differences in protein function, leading to a broader range in the ionic strength and pH values optimal for protein function (36, 37) . As such, protein oligosaccharides might subserve a homeostatic process used by cells to maintain their viability in potentially changing milieus. It has also been suggested that a layer of non-immunogenic protein-associated carbohydrate may play an immuno-protective role for underlying cell surface antigens, especially on neoplastic cells (27) .",

An extension of intermolecular association to contact between two cells in close mutual proximity leads to a possible mechanism for cell adhesion. Interaction of oligosaccharides might be due to an apposition of the hydrophobic faces of two monosaccharides such as mannose (126) . Implicit in this model is the idea of a large number of weak interactions equalling in strength a smaller number of strong interactions. This mechanism is feasible in polymeric systems with repreating similar subunits. Cell surface oligosaccharides could simulate a polymer inasmuch as they are coanchored in the same membrane.

Though this idea has since been supplanted by the 'signal hypothesis' of Blobel and Sabbatini (150) , it has served as a precursor to more refined ideas of chemical signals leading to the accumulation of glycoproteins in specific compartments (81) . For example, a mannose-6-phosphate moiety has been suggested to be responsible for associating proteins with receptors which in turn lead to protein accumulation in lysosomes (134) . The key to this understanding was the finding of mutant cells which appeared to secrete constitutively certain lysosomal enzymes that were distinct in their oligosaccharide structures: namely that normal enzymes possessed multiple phosphate residues 6-1inked to non-peripheral Mans in high-mannose structures, and that mutant enzymes lacked these phosphate moieties. This suggested that there was a Man-6-PO 4 receptor in membranes of the Golgi, and plasma membrane (since lysosomal enzymes can also be absorbed from the medium and translocated to lysosomes), which was responsible for binding the Man-6-PO4 recognition marker on certain glycoproteins. Two such receptors, one of 215kD and the other of 46kD, have been discovered (157, 158) . These are located in the Golgi and/or on the cell surface in concordance with their proposed functions. From studies on receptor movement and the effects of inhibitors there is fairly good evidence that the Man-6-PO 4 moiety, together with one or both of these receptors, plays a recognition role in the intracellular routing. However, not all lysosomal enzymes seem to be involved because some copies of the altered enzymes still accumulate in mutant cells (157) , and some lysosomal enzymes are not affected. It has been suggested that there is lysosomal heterogeneity with only one class of lysosome employing this recognition marker. It is nevertheless apparent that for some lysosomal enzymes in some cell types the Man-6-PO4 receptor does not function alone, even as an intermediate signal, for lysosomal routing. There must be other recognition signals on the enzyme polypeptide which lead to its potential lysosomal accumulation.",

In a genetically modified form of VP7, a hydrophobic region, which presumably serves as a transmembrane anchor defining the proteins as an integral membrane glycoprotein, was deleted. The truncated gene encoding VP7 was introduced to cells by transfection. Truncated VP7 was synthesized, but was then secreted despite this fact that glycosylation at its single site toward the C-terminus retained its high-mannose character.

Tunicamycin blocks N-linked glycosylation completely (as well, possibly, as other types of glycosylation (15)), whereas deoxynojirimycin and swainsonine block certain steps leading from high mannose structures to the complex type. Though the effects are not simple it tentatively appears that lack of N-linked glycosylation has a measureable affect on the rate of secretion of some proteins from hepatocytes or hepatoma cells (82, 85, 84) . Secretion from these cells appears not to involve a stored secretory vesicle. Modification of glycosylation by deoxynojirimycin or swainsonine appears in some cases to affect the rate of movement from the RER to the Golgi and, in other cases, from the Golgi to the extracellular space (162, 159, 84) . Some glycoproteins and albumin are not affected at all. This result has led to speculation that there is a receptor which can recognize and retain glycoproteins bearing the high mannose marker. This mechanism would not be universal for all proteins. Alternatively, these differences may reflect spurious differences in rates of dissociation from glycosylation enzymes. It seems reasonable to consider that glycans may be designed to play a modulatory role in the kinetics of secretion for only selected proteins. Since secretion of these proteins is not regulated by storage in a secretory vesicle, this mechanism may be used by the cell as a finetuning mechanism for controlling release of protein. It is plausible that the passive constitutive pathway for secretion (95, 144) does not involve carbohydrate per se, but that modifications of this pathway or its kinetics do. Further work remains to be done to compare carbohydrate structure on different glycoproteins and to consider the possible involvement of neighboring polypeptide regions in the interaction with a hypothetical receptor.",

It has been observed that peptide hormones which are stored in pituitary gonadotropes and thyrotropes are sulfated whereas related peptide hormones released from placental cells, but not stored there, are not sulfated. This sulfate has subsequently been shown to reside at one or more non-reducing termini of N-linked complex oligosaccharides in the position usually occupied by sialic acid. This substitution may be directed by a substitution of the GalNAc for underlying Gal (156) . The functional significance of the relationship between GalNAc-SO 4 and delivery to a vesicle which is stored cytoplasmically prior to release by a secretagogue remains to be explored. An exception to this structure-function correlation is posed by human FSH, which is stored in human pituitary gonadotropes but, unlike the LH stored in these cells, is not sulfated. Possibilities consistent with a role for GalNAc-SO4 are that FSH may segregate to a discrete vesicle population relative to LH, or that the two homones colocalize and that some intermolecular association substitutes for the lack of this carbohydrate modification.",

There are, however, some instances of inhibition (86, 87, 89, (91) (92) (93) , which allow for the possibility that Nlinked glycans may act as a signal or modulator for the export of specific proteins to the plasma membrane.

This includes glycoproteins which are recognized by the cell surface protein ligatin, which recognizes a Man-6-PO4-1-Glc, linked to a highmannose backbone (160) . This structure appears to be important for the cell surface association of these glycoproteins since Glc-I-PO4 can elute them from cells and a high concentration of Ca + +, which can elute ligatin, also elutes the associated glycoproteins. Glycoproteins associated by this mechanism were first recognized ultrastructurally on the surface of the intestinal mucosa of the suckling rat, but have since been discovered on the surfaces of a variety of cell types in sea urchin, chicken and mouse. It is unclear whether the GIc-I-PO 4 marker serves as a routing signal for export to the cell surface, using ligatin as an intermediate carrier, or whether it serves a recognition role for secondary association with the cell surface once secretion in soluble form has already occurred. Though the identity of many of the ligatin associated glycoproteins is unknown, the first to be discovered in the intestinal mucosa was j3-Nacetylhexosaminidase. In this case, the primary function of the glycoprotein can be viewed as an enzymatic one. The appended carbohydrate appears to serve a role in localization, contributing to the spatial organization of the system.",

This suggested that normal turnover of serum proteins is regulated by the structure of their glycans, which would be regulated by interaction with sialidases. Though a carbohydrate binding receptor for (non-reducing) terminal Gal/GalNAc has been characterized in hepatocytes, it has not been possible to prove this hypothesis directly. This mechanism is not universal because not all serum proteins, albumin being a notable example, are enzymatically glycosylated. Further work must be done to determine whether this system actually functions in serum protein turnover. It is interesting to note that a family of serum proteins (IgA1) binds this receptor by way of O-linked oligosaccharides, but only upon denaturation (175). It has also been recently shown that liver endothelial cells can desialate a serum protein, thus rendering it susceptible to uptake by hepatocytes via the Gal/GalNAc receptor (178) .",

            "text": "As early as 1945, Burnett (119) and his colleagues observed the importance of cell surface proteinbound sialic acid in virus binding and infection. This phenomenon is sufficiently complex, however, that it is necessary to discuss the kinds of evidence which are involved in concluding that carbohydrate plays a direct, rather than a regulatory, role in this and other examples of adhesion. Any demonstration that carbohydrate comprises part of a physical bridge in cell adhesion (or any molecular binding) requires that four general criteria be satisfied: 1) removal or alteration of the carbohydrate diminishes cell adhesion; 2) reconstitution of the carbohydrate either on the cell or on an artificial surface re-11 stores cell adhesion; 3) a specific receptor for the carbohydrate is identified on the cell (complementary) surface; 4) inactivation of the receptor diminishes cell adhesion. Satisfaction of these criteria can be complicated because cells appear to have multiple adhesion systems, rendering it difficult to assay one independently of the others. Removal of carbohydrate can have other effects on cells. For example, cell viability can be reduced by drugs or mutations affecting glycosylation, and transport of polypeptides to the cell surface and other mechanisms of turnover and placement of glycoproteins can be altered. Specific receptors may be difficult to detect because individual receptor-ligand interactions may have low affinity (e.g., 126). A rationale for this generalization is that, because of the large area of cell surfaces, cells can theoretically interact with other surfaces using a large number of low affinity associations. This may in fact be desirable for cell interactions which would need to be reversible. The results of several approaches where cell reassociation has been competed with model sugars have shown that the competing sugars must be crosslinked to form multivalent structures in order to be competitive (172) . A multivalency requirement has also been implicated in the Man-6-PO4 receptor system (155) .",

In some cases it is suspected that this sugar is associated with glycolipid but in other cases Man is believed to be involved on the basis of competition studies (e.g., 114 ). This would imply the involvement of glycoprotein because this sugar is rare in glycolipid.

Ca-free sea water elutes a fraction from cells of Microcionaprolifera which is required for their reaggregation. This fraction is the source of a purified proteoglycan which is referred to as aggregation factor. Hypotonic shock elutes another molecular species (the so-caUed baseplate or aggregation factor receptor) which is also required for reaggregation and may recognize the proteoglycan by a mechanism involving glucuronic acid on the proteoglycan. These preliminary findings were ascertained by competition studies with model sugars and enzymatic treatments, and it will be interesting to confirm these findings using purified molecules (179) . Results of comparable studies in another marine sponge, Geodia cydonium, are even more intriguing (133) . Bound t3-glucuronic acid is also believed to be important in aggregation factor/baseplate recognition but its position is reversed so that the key sugar is on the baseplate glycoprotein. Beta-glucuronidase and j3-glucuronyltransferase can be eluted from extracellular material suggesting a mechanism for the dynamic regulation of cell recognition. An investigation into the tissue specificity of cell recognition showed that ~-galactosidase treatment of nonaggregating cells permitted their aggregation in the presence of aggregation factor. A protein was then isolated which could inhibit aggregation of aggregation-competent cells in a fl-galactosidase sensitive fashion. Finally, a t3-galactoside binding protein was isolated from extracellular material which rendered an effect similar to that of the glycosidase. Though the significance of these observations is as yet unclear, it has been suggested that carbohydrate structures may underlie specific mechanisms of cell recognition in multiple ways in these species.",

There is conflicting evidence from these studies regarding the nature of the carbohydrate structure involved. Additional results have indicated that one lymphocyte subclass recognition site involves a previously studied homing receptor, the ubiquitin-conjugated glycoprotein defined by the MEL-14 antigen. Recent work has found carbohydrate-derivatized polyacrylamide surfaces to which lymphocytes will specifically bind (137) . An effort is underway to compare the specificity of this interaction with that to HEVs.

            "text": "The selected examples discussed here indicate that protein-linked (or possibly lipid-linked) carbohydrate may play a fundamental role in multicellular organization in a wide phylogenetic range of organisms. Though in all of the examples cited there is a specificity in the adhesion, in some cases this is due to multiple possibly low-affinity binding interactions. In the extreme, each single binding event may approach non-specificity, with specificity accruing through multivalency. Perhaps this implies that the formalization of non-specific carbohydrate-mediated events obscures an actual continuum of specificity in these events between these two extremes. It is unclear whether the involvement of carbohydrate in adhesion is universal. Several other adhesion molecules, including glycoproteins such as gp80 in D. discoideurn (164) , CAM 80/120 in mammalian cells, etc. and glycolipids (146) , are glycosylated but the role of carbohydrate is not known. If the use of carbohydrate is universal, then the specificity inherent in the examples discussed would suggest an underlying structural code which may be important for the affiliated processes of cell sorting and morphogenesis, to which adhesion makes a very important contribution. This may explain some of the interesting morphogenetic effects circumstantially suggested by many studies involving carbohydrate structure perturbations on developing cells.",

Cell sorting and molecular compartmentalization can be regarded as sorting at different levels. It will be interesting to learn whether the proteins on which these carbohydrates are located exist only to place the carbohydrate or whether the carbohydrate piggybacks on another essential function of the protein. Were the latter true, this would strengthen the analogy with the role of carbohydrate in routing or molecular compartmentalization. It may then become feasible to generalize carbohydrate's role as important for the three-dimensional compartmentalization of proteins, and the cells, with which they are associated. As such, carbohydrate may be the chemical structure cells used to address and organize space as they evolved from prokaryotes to unicellular eukaryotes, and continued to exploit as they evolved to form multicellular tissues and organs.",

Glycosylation is modulated coincidentally with numerous developmental processes (122, 53-67, 69, 96, 161) . Carbohydrate interactions have been implicated in mammalian morula compaction (131, 122, 123) . Proliferation has been reported to require glycosylation (41) or to be inhibited by glycopeptides and a defined fragment of heparan sulfate (143, 151) . Oligosaccharides released from plant cell walls can stimulate cell proliferation and alter cell differentiation in plant cells (145) . Myogenesis and chondrogenesis have been speculated to be affected by GAGs linked to proteoglycans (e.g., 113 ), but conclusions in this field are very controversial. Attachment of cells to substratum-associated carbohydrate can result in its covalent modification (213, 130). Neuritogenesis has been shown to be inhibited in vitro by tunicamycin (16) , though the specificity of the effect is difficult to assess, as tunicamycin-sensitivity does not convincingly demonstrate the involvement of protein-linked carbohydrate (15, 17) . A recent report suggests that alteration of processing of Nlinked oligosaccharides with swainsonine, without affecting cell viablility, inhibits the ability of a line of melanoma cells to metastasize to the lung (52). This finding is consistent with another report documenting carbohydrate differences between metastatic and non-metastatic cell lines (49) .",

This has recently been appreciated in amphibian (53) and mouse (54, 55) embryos and in the simpler model system Dictyostelium discoideum (96, 161) . Tumor cells also differ in many cases in specific carbohydrate structures on both lipid and protein (44-46, 49-51,180) . Several of the antibodies employed recognize carbohydrate epitopes whose corresponding structures have been determined. The antibodies provide unrivaled sensitivity and specificity relative to standard methods for detection of unique carbohydrate structures. Caution must be applied, however, because 1) it is theoretically possible that unique structures at the monosaccharide level may present structures similar enough at the atomic level to be immunologically cross-reactive and 2) identical or similar structures may be immunologically distinguished by conformational restrictions imposed by the surrounding polypeptide environment. Thus inference of structure based on antibody data must be confirmed directly by structural studies. In any case, antibodies and lectins may model potential receptors in cells which might specifically recognize carbohydrate-associated structures.",

In addition, monosaccharide residues may be processed independently of the associated polypeptide (141, 142) either by recycling through the Golgi (112) or at locations near the site of funtion (130, 138) , far from the point of origin in the RER and Golgi.

Perhaps this is because specification of its structure, which is nontemplate-directed, is not precise enough. Glycosylation presumably has instead afforded the cell, during the evolution of developmental mechanisms, an economy in allowing the structural modification of many preexisting proteins using the same enzymatic mechanism. It provides the cell with another control point over structure which can be exerted on many proteins at the site of function (away from the site of synthesis) without necessitating a change in gene expression. Change in structure by glycosylation may be very suitable for the regulation of the 'luxury' functions of cell differentiation and morphogenesis. An economy of shared non-specifc and specific functions of carbohydrate would thus offer an unifying explanation for the often contradictory conclusions yielded from the varied experimental approaches summarized in this article.",
