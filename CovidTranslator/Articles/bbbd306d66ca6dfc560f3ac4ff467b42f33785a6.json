Because GSK983 is an ineffective antiviral in the presence of physiological uridine concentrations, we explored combining GSK983 with pyrimidine salvage inhibitors. We synthesized and evaluated analogs of cyclopentenyl uracil (CPU), an inhibitor of uridine salvage. We found that CPU was efficiently converted into its triphosphates in cells. When combined with GSK983, it led to large drops in cellular UTP and CTP pools. Consequently, CPU-GSK983 suppressed dengue virus replication in the presence of physiological concentrations of uridine. In addition, the CPU-GSK983 combination markedly enhanced the effect of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) inhibition on viral genome infection. Our findings highlight a new host-targeting strategy for potentiating the antiviral activities of RdRp inhibitors.",

For examples, compounds like aciclovir and zidovudine block viral reverse transcriptase to treat herpes simplex virus and HIV infections, respectively, and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) inhibitors like dasabuvir and sofosbuvir are used to treat hepatitis C virus infections (Nov\u00e1kov\u00e1 et al., 2018) . More recently, the broadspectrum RdRp inhibitor remdesivir (Gordon et al., 2020) has entered clinical trials for coronavirus disease 2019 . Meanwhile, targeting host proteins required for viral propagation is emerging as an attractive alternative that may circumvent the emergence of resistance (Bekerman and Einav, 2015) . For example, maraviroc inhibits the human chemokine receptor CCR5, and is therefore used to treat multidrug-resistant HIV (Lieberman-Blum et al., 2008) . Additionally, pyrimidine biosynthesis has emerged as a potential host-targeting strategy for antivirals (Okesli et al., 2017) . Here, we focus on devising a host-targeting antiviral approach for the treatment of RNA viruses, which cause many serious diseases such as hepatitis, influenza, Ebola, dengue, and Covid-19.",

Two complementary pathways -de novo biosynthesis and pyrimidine salvage -are responsible for producing UTP and CTP for host as well as viral RNA synthesis (Figure 1 ). De novo pyrimidine biosynthesis is a resource-intensive process. In contrast, salvage occurs via phosphorylation of UMP and CMP derived from intracellular RNA degradation or via facilitated transport and phosphorylation of extracellular uridine, whose plasma concentration is tightly controlled in the low micromolar range (Traut, 1994) . Recently we discovered that GSK983, a broad-spectrum antiviral agent first reported in 2009 (Harvey et al., 2009) , is a potent inhibitor of dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH), a ratelimiting step in de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis (Deans et al., 2016) . In the course of those unbiased genome-wide studies, we also found that knockdown of uridine/cytidine kinase 2 (UCK2) and cytidine monophosphate kinase 1 (CMPK1) in the pyrimidine salvage pathway strongly sensitized cells to growth inhibition by GSK983 (Deans et al., 2016) . This finding was consistent with the observation that GSK983 often lacks antiviral efficacy in vivo despite high potency in vitro presumably due to salvage metabolism of circulating uridine by virus-infected cells (Traut, 1994; Wang et al., 2011) .",

This contrast is likely due to downstream inhibition of the CTP synthetase by CPC (Schimmel et al., 2007) .",

To minimize the perturbative effects of sample quenching and analysis on the physiological concentrations of these metabolites, we adapted an earlier protocol for growing cells on glass cover slips to facilitate rapid washing ( Figure S3 ) (Martano et al., 2014) . LC-MS of nucleotides (Table S1 for MS/MS transitions of selected precursors) was performed using a dynamic multiple reaction monitoring (dMRM) method (Sartain et al, 2016) . Addition of micromolar concentrations of medronic acid into the mobile phase markedly increased the sensitivity for detecting di-and tri-nucleotides by this method (Hsiao et al., 2018) . The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10. 1101 With optimized sampling and analysis method in hand, pyrimidine nucleotide levels were measured in cells cultured with either CPU, 5-F-CPU or 5'-F-CPU in combination with 1 \u00b5M GSK983 and 5 \u00b5M uridine for 6 h ( Figure 4A ). Inclusion of CPU or 5-F-CPU led to large decreases in UTP and CTP levels compared to cells treated with GSK983 alone; these effects grew more pronounced at 12 h ( Figure S4 ).",

Using an infectious clone of dengue serotype 2 (DENV-2) strain 16681 engineered to express a luciferase reporter (Deans et al., 2016; Hierholzer and Killington, 1996; Marceau et al., 2016) , the efficacy and cytotoxicity of each combination treatment was tested in infected or uninfected cultures of the A549 lung carcinoma cell line ( Figure 5A ). In all assays, culture medium was supplemented with 20 \u00b5M uridine to mimic physiological plasma concentrations. In the presence of 20 \u00b5M exogenous uridine, 1 \u00b5M of the de novo pyrimidine synthesis inhibitor GSK983 alone did not significantly inhibit viral infection or cellular viability ( Figure 5A ). In line with our original hypothesis, combination of GSK983 with either 500 \u00b5M CPU and 5-F-CPU caused significant reductions in viral infection unlike the other cyclopentenyl compounds tested ( Figure 5A ). However, only CPU appeared to have a workable therapeutic index at this concentration and time point. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10. 1101 To further examine the efficacy and cytotoxicity of CPU, we conducted a more comprehensive checkerboard analysis of the CPU-GSK983 combination. While neither GSK983 nor CPU were effective as single agents in physiological uridine levels, the combination of both molecules successfully suppressed dengue virus infection ( Figure 5B ). For example, combining 0.2 \u00b5M GSK983 and 250 \u00b5M CPU inhibited ~ 50% of virus replication ( Figure 5B ). At a CPU dose of 1 mM, virus replication was suppressed almost completely. Notably, the combination treatment had much less effect on A549 cell growth, suggesting that combinations of GSK983 and CPU could be selective for inhibition of virus but not host replication.",

It is made available under a The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.24.992230 doi: bioRxiv preprint To gain insight into the mechanism underlying the improvement of R1479 efficacy with CPU, we deployed a replicon assay that bypasses viral entry by electroporation of DENV RNA (Alvarez et al., 2005; Marceau et al., 2016) . Such replicon systems include the coding region needed for viral RNA translation and replication, while lacking the structural genes necessary for the production of viral particles. Consequently, viral genome replication is examined independent of viral entry and particle assembly (Kato and Hishiki, 2016) . In this assay (Figure 7) , the EC50 of R1479 alone was ~90 \u00b5M. Inhibition of de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis alone with GSK983 did not alter this value (~96 \u00b5M), whereas addition of 250 \u00b5M CPU shifted it to ~56 \u00b5M. Targeting both the de novo and salvage pathways with a combination of 1 \u00b5M GSK and 250 \u00b5M CPU lowered the EC50 of R1479 by over 4fold to ~19 \u00b5M. These results suggest that intracellular nucleotide depletion is the major driver of CPU's antiviral activity. Together, these findings highlight the potential of combining modulators of pyrimidine metabolism with inhibitors of viral genome replication.",

A series of high-throughput phenotypic cell-based screens have recently identified DHODH inhibition as a potent, broadspectrum antiviral strategy in vitro (Hoffmann et al., 2011; Lucas-Hourani et al., 2013; Luthra et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2011) . Furthermore, a DHODH inhibitor was recently shown to suppress SARS-CoV-2 in vitro (Xiong et al., 2020) . However, DHODH inhibitors often lose antiviral activity upon extracellular uridine addition due presumably to pyrimidine salvage (Deans et al., 2016) . ",

Intracellular nucleotide depletion appears correlated with antiviral activity given that the structurally unrelated nucleoside transport inhibitor DPY also suppressed intracellular nucleotide levels and viral replication ( Figure S5 ). Additionally, while 250 \u00b5M CPU in the absence of GSK983 did slightly potentiate the effects of R1479 on viral replication (Figure 7) , this did not translate to decreased viral infection at the same time point ( Figure S6A ). Nevertheless, further investigation of inhibitory effects of CPU-TP on dengue RdRp is warranted. Indeed, as noted previously, NIs are the largest class of RdRp inhibitors (Klumpp et al., 2008) . Additionally, a multifactorial approach that incorporates information about interactions with multiple host and viral enzymes will likely be useful for future SAR around CPU as this compound remained the most efficacious in our panel.",

Meanwhile, many RdRp inhibitors have been evaluated in clinical trials against dengue. While a preliminary study combining CPU with a de novo synthesis inhibitor in vivo resulted in toxicity (Cysyk et al., 1995) , there is precedent for combining inhibitors of de novo pyrimidine synthesis with nucleoside transport inhibitors in humans (Casper et al., 1991) . With careful dose optimization, our results suggest that a combination strategy targeting both host pyrimidine biosynthesis and viral RdRp holds promise as a potential therapy against RNA viruses.

For in vitro transcription, 10 ug of plasmid DNA was linearized using XbaI restriction enzyme. Replicon RNA was generated using the MEGAscript T7 Transcription Kit in the presence of 5mM m7G(5\u2032)ppp(5\u2032)G RNA Cap Structure Analogue. Two million cells were washed twice with PBS and re-suspended in electroporation buffer (Teknova, E0399), mixed with 4 ug of purified replicon RNA, and electroporated using Bio-Rad Gene Pulser Xcell electroporator using square wave protocol. Electroporated cells were resuspended in pre-warmed culture medium without antibiotics and seeded as required. Luciferase expression was measured using Renilla Luciferase Assay system (Promega, E2820) following the manufacturers' instructions.",

Anhydrous tetrahydrofuran (THF), dichloromethane (CH2Cl2), dimethylformamide (DMF), acetone, and dimethyl sufoxide (DMSO) were obtained from Acros Organics. Diethyl ether (Et2O), ethyl acetate (EtOAc), hexanes, and methanol (MeOH) were from Fisher Scientific. DMSO used in bioassays and to prepare biological samples was from Fisher BioReagents. All other reagents were from commercial suppliers and were used as received without additional purification. Samples prepared for biological evaluation were purified via preparative HPLC in a water/acetonitrile (MeCN) gradient containing 0.1% (v/v) trifluoracetic acid (TFA) using an Agilent 1260 Infinity system equipped with an Agilent Prep-C18 column (21.2 x 250 mm).",

A single, isolated colony was inoculated into 30 mL LB supplemented with 50 \u00b5g/mL carbenicillin and grown at 37\u00b0C with shaking for 15 h. The next day, these cells were used to inoculate 1 L autoclaved LB with 50 \u00b5g/mL carbenicillin. The flask was shaken at 37 \u00baC. When an optical density (OD600) of 0.7 was reached, protein expression was induced with 0.5 mM isopropyl \u03b2-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG). The temperature was changed to 18 \u00b0C and flasks were shaken for an additional 15 h. The cell pellets were collected by spinning the media at 5000 rpm for 10 min.
