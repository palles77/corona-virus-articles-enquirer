To replicate these novel bioenergetic findings, we probed independent datasets for bioenergetic targets and found similar abnormalities. Next, we used a novel strategy to build a schizophrenia bioenergetic profile by a tailored application of the Library of Integrated Network-Based Cellular Signatures data portal (iLINCS) and investigated connected cellular pathways, kinases, and transcription factors using Enrichr. Finally, with the goal of identifying drugs capable of \"reversing\" the bioenergetic schizophrenia signature, we performed a connectivity analysis with iLINCS and identified peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) agonists as promising therapeutic targets. We administered a PPAR agonist to the GluN1 knockdown model of schizophrenia and found it improved long-term memory. Taken together, our findings suggest that tailored bioinformatics approaches, coupled with the LINCS library of transcriptional signatures of chemical and genetic perturbagens may be employed to identify novel treatment strategies for schizophrenia and related diseases.",

We have also recently demonstrated decreases in glycolytic enzymes (HK1, and phosphofructokinase muscle type, PFKM) and glucose transporters (GLUT1 and GLUT3) in pyramidal neurons, but not astrocytes, in the DLPFC of schizophrenia subjects (n=16) (18) . While examining the expression of individual targets is important, employing a signature based bioinformatics approach may help elucidate the pathophysiology of large biological networks. gene to determine if a knockdown signature has been catalogued in the database. By clustering the seed gene knockdown signatures in iLINCS, we are able to analyze the connectivity of the knockdown signatures (and thus establish a schizophrenia bioenergetic profile), identifying groups of L1000 genes that change concordantly following genetic perturbation. Furthermore, we can perform Enrichr analyses on these genes to gain perspective on bioenergetic pathology, describe potential multisystem pathological mechanisms, and inform pharmacological studies.",

In order to select a potential drug intervention for preclinical testing, we relied on the 'connectivity' analysis to reveal positively (concordant) and negatively correlated (discordant) chemical (small molecule) and genetic perturbations. We developed a discovery based workflow to generate a list of small molecule perturbagens with L1000 transcript changes in the opposite direction of our knockdown signatures (based on concordance values from iLINCS, i.e. generating an \"inverse/discordant signature\") ( Figure 1 ). iLINCS provides over 40,000 transcriptomic profiles (signatures) of cell lines following treatment with chemical perturbagens such as FDA approved drugs, chemical probes, and screening library compounds including those with clinical utility and known mechanisms of action (19) . FDA approved drugs generated from this \"knockdown signature connectivity\" analysis could serve as candidates for therapeutic treatment in a preclinical model of schizophrenia. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) agonists had multiple hits in our analysis and similar drugs in this class are currently FDA approved for use in humans (21) .",

            "text": "One of the leading hypotheses of the etiology of schizophrenia is glutamatergic hypofunction (22) (23) (24) . N-methyl-D-aspartate subtype glutamate (NMDA) receptor dysfunction is strongly implicated in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia, particularly in human pharmacological studies (25) (26) (27) (28) . Converging evidence suggests that NMDA receptor hypofunction may actually reflect a dysregulation at the receptor level, including mutations in NMDA receptor subunits (29) . Several studies have found associations between the gene that encodes the GluN1 subunit of the NMDA receptor (Grin1) and schizophrenia (30) (31) (32) (33) (34) (35) (36) (37) (38) . The GluN1 knockdown mouse model has a ~90% global reduction of normal functioning NMDA receptors, achieved by targeted insertion of 2 kb of foreign DNA into intron 19 of the Grin1 gene (39) . Additionally, mice with mutations in the Grin1 gene have well-characterized behavioral endophenotypes for schizophrenia; this includes impairments in executive function and working memory, increased stereotypic behavior, decreased anxiety-like behavior, decreased sensorimotor gating, and abnormal social interaction (40) . Several of these behaviors are attenuated with typical and atypical antipsychotics at doses similar to those used in pharmacological models of schizophrenia (MK-801 or phencyclidine models), including hyperactivity, stereotypy, and sociability deficits (39, 41) . Therefore, the GluN1 knockdown mouse model is a viable and useful tool for studying the interface of NMDA receptor hypofunction, bioenergetics, and schizophrenia symptomology.",

For example, there is strong evidence linking lactate shuttle defects to NMDA receptor dysfunction in MK-801 treated rats and in GluN1 subunit knockdown mice (42) (43) (44) . Dysregulation of the energetic flow of lactate inhibits long term potentiation (45, 46) , and may contribute to cognitive deficits in GluN1 knockdown mice. Additionally, when lactate flow from astrocytes to neurons is stimulated, or when lactate is introduced to extracellular space, it enhances working memory and memory formation in rats (45) (46) (47) . Thus, drug-induced stimulation of lactate production coupled with behavioral studies in GluN1 knockdown mice could help elucidate the role of bioenergetic abnormalities in cognitive dysfunction in schizophrenia.",

Activation of PPAR\u03b3 via pioglitazone can also alter the transcription and expression of GLUT1, leading to changes in glucose uptake through PPAR\u03b3 and other mechanisms (48, 54) .

First, we assessed locomotor activity, stereotypic behaviors, and mania-like behavior. Next, we assessed executive function and cognitive flexibility using the puzzle-box test. This test requires the mouse to display problem-solving behavior as well as short-and long-term explicit memory to reach a goal area. To assess pioglitazone's effect on sociability, we used an ageand sex-matched mouse as a social stimulus (57) . Finally, we assessed sensorimotor gating using the pre-pulse inhibition (PPI) of acoustic startle paradigm (58) . Taken together, these studies provide a bioinformatics translational approach to identify novel treatment strategies through the use of the LINCS library of signatures and connectivity analysis, coupled with the analyses of primary data and published work (to extend the set of 'seed' genes).",

Following mass spectrometry on affinity purified samples, we analyzed the top 20 increased proteins in GluN1 knockdown mice relative to WT mice with Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA). The top 5 implicated pathways in the GluN1 knockdown mice were gluconeogenesis, glucose metabolism, pyruvate and citric acid metabolism, metabolism of carbohydrates, and glycogen storage disease ( Figure 5B ). Finally, we examined mRNA expression of metabolic transporters (MCT1, MCT2, MCT4, GLUT1, GLUT3) using real time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) in a cohort of GluN1 knockdown and wildtype (WT) mice (n=5 per group). We found significant decreases in GLUT1 (47%, p=0.018) and GLUT3 (34%, p=0.013) in GluN1 knockdown mice compared to WT controls ( Figure 5C ), confirming that a strategy to increase glucose uptake capacity might be a successful intervention for schizophrenia.",

GPI is a dimeric cytoplasmic enzyme that catalyzes the reversible isomerization of glucose-6-phosphate to fructose-6-phosphate in the second step in the glycolytic pathway. When expressed extracellularly, the GPI protein functions as a neurotrophic factor that promotes neuronal survival (71) . One study found an increase in glucose-6-phosphate levels, as well as several other metabolites in the glycolytic pathway, in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of schizophrenia patients, suggesting improper functioning of glycolytic enzymes (72) . Other data suggest that GPI deficiency results in an accumulation of glucose-6-phosphate and over activation of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway (73) . A decrease in GPI expression in pyramidal neurons could contribute to dysregulation of both glycolysis and mTOR signaling. A disruption in mTOR signaling could affect protein synthesis and lead to aberrant neuronal growth and synapse connectivity.",

LDHA, which was previously found to be downregulated in dentate granule neurons in schizophrenia, was also significantly downregulated in the SMRI genomics database (15) . We also found that PFKFB2, which is genetically linked to schizophrenia, is downregulated in schizophrenia in the MSSM DLPFC microarray data (14) . The SMRI and the MSSM databases contain region-level findings in multiple brain regions, while IPSCs and LCM techniques provide cell-subtype specific resolution. Further, prior work in our laboratory found a decrease in PFK and HK enzyme activity levels in the DLPFC in schizophrenia (18) .

These signaling pathways implicate glucose utilization, energy homeostasis, mitochondrial function, and cell growth. Our top protein-protein interaction hits (RPS6KA3, MAPK14, glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK3B) and cyclin dependent kinase 1 (CDK1), etc.) suggest a role for pathways involved in energy metabolism and cell proliferation. Next, we probed for kinases that when knocked down in specific cell lines, increased the expression of genes that were in our panels of clustered upregulated genes. We found several serine/threonine-protein kinases including AKT1, PTK2, MAP2K2, and ATR. AKT1 is one of 3 closely related serine/threonine-protein kinases (AKT1, AKT2 and AKT3) thought to regulate metabolism and promote cellular proliferation (76) . We also had significant hits for G-protein coupled receptor proteins NMUR2 and FFAR1. Neuromedin U (NMUR2) encodes a G-protein coupled receptor protein widely expressed in the central nervous system (CNS) that binds the neuropeptide neuromedin U in order to regulate energy homeostasis (77, 78) . These results suggest that kinases involved in glucose metabolism and cell cycle regulation are relevant to our panels of clustered upregulated genes.

The nuclear receptor PPAR\u03b3 forms a heterodimer with the retinoid X receptor (RXR), two of our top hits, increasing the transcription of various genes that stimulate glucose uptake and carbohydrate metabolism (87) . PPAR\u03b3 ligands such as thiazolidinediones (TZDs) increase glucose utilization, treat hyperglycemia, and represent therapeutic possibilities in diseases with deficient glycolytic systems (88) . We also found kinases that are involved in axonal growth during CNS development (RYK), cell growth and cycle progression (WEE1, ABL2), and cytoskeletal remodeling (ABL2). Finally, we performed pathway analyses to identify transcription factors with occupancy sites for our panels of clustered downregulated genes, several of which played key roles in cellular proliferation/development and were similar to hits from previous analyses (MYC, MYCN, NUCKS1, forkhead box M1) ( Figure S16 ). Enrichr analyses are summarized in Table 3 and a full discussion of panels of clustered downregulated genes can be found in the supplement.",

PI3K inhibitors constituted 2 of the drugs that may \"reverse\" our disease signature. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. It . https://doi.org/10.1101/338392 doi: bioRxiv preprint These antitumor drugs inhibit PI3K enzymes, which are part of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway and play critical roles in many cellular functions such as cellular proliferation, metabolism, and immune cell activation (93) (94) (95) . Recent work has linked schizophrenia pathology to the PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling cascade (74, 96, 97) . Additionally, PI3K signaling can modulate synaptic formation and plasticity, and has been implicated in both schizophrenia and autism disorder (reviewed in (98, 99) ). Previous work demonstrated pharmacological inhibition of the catalytic subunit of PI3K blocks amphetamine induced psychosis in mice, highlighting PI3K inhibitors as therapeutic targets for the treatment of psychiatric disorders (100) . However, PI3K inhibition may be more suitable for \"positive symptoms,\" as PI3K inhibition results in diminished insulin-stimulated glucose uptake by inhibiting translocation of GLUT4 glucose transporters to the plasma membrane (101) . Three of our drug discovery analysis hits were typical antipsychotics, which also treat positive symptoms of schizophrenia via dopamine receptor D2 antagonism (102) . It is possible that the glycolytic knockdown signatures used to generate these perturbagens could cause transcriptional changes in L1000 genes involved in the regulation of dopaminergic synapses, suggesting dopamine and metabolic systems could be connected in schizophrenia. This is not entirely surprising as antipsychotics have well documented metabolic effects (103) .",

Interestingly, sodium valproate (valproic acid) is commonly used as an adjunctive therapy for the treatment of schizophrenia, and a recent 4 week randomized clinical trial demonstrated improvement in psychopathology with a combination therapy of valproate and risperidone or olanzapine compared to antipsychotics alone (n=249) (105) .

GluN1 knockdown animals display a wide variety of endophenotypes associated with schizophrenia, including deficits in cognition (40) . We found that top pathways associated with protein changes at the synapse in GluN1 knockdown mice compared to WT controls were metabolic in nature ( Figure 5B ). Additionally, expression of glucose transporters (GLUT1 and GLUT3) were significantly decreased in the frontal cortex of GluN1 knockdown mice ( Figure 5C ). These results suggest there are similar abnormalities in bioenergetic systems in this model to schizophrenia, and that modulating these systems are viable treatment strategies.

While our locomotor and cognitive assay is adequately powered (n=9-12 per group), elevated plus maze, social paradigm, and PPI studies have an average of n=6 mice per group, which may not be large enough to fully elucidate subtle behavioral differences. It is also possible that pioglitazone doses used here may not fully produce therapeutic effects, and future work with varying dosing regimens is warranted. Additionally, as discussed above, cognition is multifaceted and the current study only utilizes one approach examining executive function (puzzle box assay). Several behavioral tasks such as fear conditioned learning (context versus cue), water mazes (contextual memory), radial arm maze (working memory), and novel object task would be useful in determining more nuanced effects of pioglitazone. Finally, additional biochemical experiments in GluN1 knockdown mice could help elucidate other potential metabolic pathways to target. This would provide the framework for future intervention studies using promising new pro-metabolic drugs in GluN1 knockdown mice or of pioglitazone in more models of schizophrenia (i.e. pharmacological, other mutants such as DISC1, SHANK3, NRG-1, etc.).

Using the ChEA 2016 database in Enrichr, we also report transcription factors that have occupancy sites for a significant number of our panels of clustered genes. Finally, using LINCS L1000 database in Enrichr, we report kinases that when knocked down in specific cell lines, increase or decrease genes that are in our panels of clustered upregulated and downregulated gene data sets, respectively (Table 3 , Figures S4-S17 ).",

This was done individually for each seed gene knockdown signature (unclustered) and the top 20 discordant chemical perturbagen signatures were recorded (Table S4 ). PFKFB2 had no discordant signatures, while GPI and PFKM had less than 20. Perturbagens appearing multiple times for the same seed gene are either in different cell lines or were administered to cells at different concentrations. We also recorded the top 20 overall discordant chemical perturbagen signatures across all seed gene knockdown signatures (Table S5 ). The top 20 overall discordant chemical perturbagen signatures were in the VCAP cell line. When duplicates were removed, 12 unique discordant chemical perturbagen signatures remained (Table 4 ).

Mice were allowed to acclimatize in the chamber and to the background noise for 300s, followed by 5 consecutive pulse alone trials, then by 80 randomized trials (as described above) and then 5 consecutive pulse alone trials. Pre-pulse inhibition was measured as a decrease in the amplitude of startle response to a 100dB acoustic startle pulse, following each pre-pulse (4dB, 8dB and 16dB).",

GluN1 knockdown mice had generally lower PPI than did WT controls at all dBs. Additionally, at 4 dB, pioglitazonetreated GluN1 knockdown (GluN1pio) mice had a lower PPI than any other group, suggesting pioglitazone interacts in a negative way with the knockdown pathophysiology (drug by genotype interaction, F (1, 23) = 6.579, p=0.0173). The 4dB pre-pulse is the lowest level of pre-pulse and thus the \"most sensitive\" measure of the deficit (vs. 8dB and 16dB, where the deficit is sometimes not seen in a disease state). This could explain why we only detect this negative drug interaction at the 4 dB pre-pulse. Interestingly (although not significant), WTpio mice tended to have a larger PPI versus WTveh mice in all dB tests, while GluN1pio mice tended to have a lower PPI versus GluN1veh mice in all dB tests, reinforcing the idea of different genotype by drug interactions.

Cognition and other related functions disrupted in schizophrenia are often highly complex, and modulation of these circuits might be treated with personalized combination therapeutics.For example, one study examined the effects of pioglitazone as an adjunct treatment to antipsychotic drugs in schizophrenia subjects (n=40)(66). Subjects received risperidone plus either pioglitazone (30 mg/day) or placebo for 8 weeks. Patients in the pioglitazone group showed significantly more improvement in Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) negative subscale scores (p < 0.001) as well as PANSS total scores (p = 0.01) compared with the placebo group, suggesting pioglitazone and risperidone work through different circuitry and could be used in conjunction to treat both cognitive/negative and positive symptoms. There is also evidence suggesting pioglitazone treatment could help combat glucose-lipid metabolic abnormalities and diabetes that are often exacerbated by antipsychotics(119).These findings suggest the possibility of pioglitazone as an augmentation therapy in reducing difficult to treat symptoms in schizophrenia.",

However, although not in the top 20 overall discordant perturbagen signatures, the top hit for PFKM was also valproic acid (albeit a weak discordance), suggesting our overall top hits may still reverse this signature.LINCS, although a powerful resource, also has important caveats in itself. Knockdownsignatures are generated in a variety of cell lines (mostly cancer) and can have differing transcriptomic changes to the same perturbagen. While the selection of a relevant cell line is important, not every target gene has been knocked down in every cell line, and comparing signatures from different cell lines can yield different results. In this study, none of our seed genes had knockdown signatures in neuronal cell lines. To minimize variability, we compared signatures for seed genes using one consistent cell line (VCAP). While these cells are not neuronal cell lines, downstream regulation of transcriptional profiles is often comparable across cell lines, and still provides a useful basis for comparison of mRNA signatures",
