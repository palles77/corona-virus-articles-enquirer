            "text": "SARS-CoV-2 is a zoonotic virus that has caused a pandemic of severe respiratory disease-COVID-19within several months of its initial identification. Comparable to the first SARS-CoV, this novel coronavirus's surface Spike (S) glycoprotein mediates cell entry via the human ACE-2 receptor, and, thus, is the principal target for the development of vaccines and immunotherapeutics. Molecular information on the SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein remains limited. Here we report the crystal structure of the SARS-CoV-2 S receptor-binding-domain (RBD) at a the highest resolution to date, of 1.95 \u00c5. We identified a set of SARS-reactive monoclonal antibodies with cross-reactivity to SARS-CoV-2 RBD and other betacoronavirus S glycoproteins. One of these antibodies, CR3022, was previously shown to synergize with antibodies that target the ACE-2 binding site on the SARS-CoV RBD and reduce viral escape capacity. We determined the structure of CR3022, in complex with the SARS-CoV-2 RBD, and defined a broadly reactive epitope that is highly conserved across betacoronaviruses. This epitope is inaccessible in the \"closed\" prefusion S structure, but is accessible in \"open\" conformations. This first-ever resolution of a human antibody in complex with SARS-CoV-2 and the broad reactivity of this set of antibodies to a conserved betacoronavirus epitope will allow antigenic assessment of vaccine candidates, and provide a framework for accelerated vaccine, immunotherapeutic and diagnostic strategies against SARS-CoV-2 and related betacoronaviruses. : bioRxiv preprint",

Despite the comprehensive structural characterization of the spike protein as a whole, movement of the RBD between \"up\" and \"down\" conformational states prevented complete modeling of the RBD domains. Subsequent cryo-EM investigations of SARS-CoV-2 provided more detail of RBD, particularly at sites that contact the human ACE-2 receptor (Yan et al., 2020a) . Here, we report the first high resolution-less than 2 \u00c5-SARS-CoV-2 RBD. Additionally, we present the antigenicity of this recombinant RBD, particularly of interest, given the equipoise in the literature regarding the binding affinities of SARS-CoV antibodies for SARS-CoV-2 RBD. Early reports, have described that the human SARS-CoV antibody, CR3022, is able to bind to the SARS-CoV-2 RBD. In the present study, we verify binding, and subsequently solved the structure of SARS-CoV-2 RBD in complex with CR3022 with a novel \"cryptic\" epitope.",

            "text": "Although SARS-CoV-2 is a newly identified virus, it shares genetic and morphologic features with others in the Coronaviridae family, particularly those from the Betacoronavirus genus. The genome of the recently isolated SARS-CoV-2 shares 82% nucleotide identity with human SARS-CoV and 89% with bat SARS-like-CoVZXC21 . The spike (S) glycoprotein, in particular, bears significant structural homology with SARS-CoV compared to other coronaviruses such as MERS-CoV. Like SARS-CoV, the surface Spike (S) glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 binds the same host receptor, ACE-2, to mediate cell entry (Letko et al., 2020; Yan et al., 2020a) . S-a class I fusion protein-is also a critical determinant of viral host range and tissue tropism and the primary target of the host immune response (Li, 2016) . As such, most coronavirus vaccine candidates are based on S or one of its sub-components. Coronavirus S glycoproteins contain three segments: a large ectodomain, a single-pass transmembrane anchor and a short intracellular tail. The ectodomain consists of a receptor-binding subunit, S1, which contains two subdomains: one at the N-terminus and the other at the C-terminus. The latter comprises the receptor-binding domain (RBD), which serves the vital function of attaching the virus to the host receptor and triggering a conformational change in the protein that results in fusion with the host cell membrane through the S2 subunit. a CC0 license. author/funder.

The SARS-CoV RBD-2 compared to liganded (PDB ID: 2AJF) and unliganded (PDB ID: 2GHV) SARS-CoV RBD structures shows high structural similarity, except for residues 473-488 (Figure 1) . A chimeric SARS-CoV-2 RBD structure (PDB ID: 6VW1) with 23 aa differences compared to SARS-CoV-2, in complex with human ACE-2 was recently released in the PDB. Comparisons with previously published structures with the SARS-CoV-2 RBD highlight residues 473-488 as an area with significant structural plasticity. In the RBD structure from this study, we observe electron density for two conformations of the 482-486 loop. One of these conformations is highly similar to the ligand bound form of the RBD, while the second conformation would clash with the ACE2 receptor. Both this structural detail of the unliganded RBD and comparison to previously described RBD structures indicates that this area of the RBD is structurally malleable with implications for antibody or small molecule therapeutics design.",

CR3022 bound to the RBD at an epitope centered on S glycoprotein residues 377-386 with a total buried surface area of 871 \u00c5 (Figure 3, Figure S2 , and Table S1 ).

To date, there has been extensive structural characterization of the SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV spike molecule and domains, which provides a framework for understanding the novel SARS-CoV-2 spike molecule (Table S2 ). In the context of the coronavirus trimeric S glycoproteins, the RBD displays two prototypical conformations either in an \"up\" or \"down\" position, with implications for receptor binding and cell entry ( Table S1 ). To further analyze these conformations, we modeled the CR3022 binding to the trimeric structures of SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. The CR3022 epitope is occluded by adjacent spike protomers when the RBD is in the \"down\" conformation, but becomes more accessible when the spike is in a more open conformation here multiple RBD molecules are in the \"up\" conformation ( Figure 4) . There is still a clash of the antibody Fc1 region with the NTD from the same protomer, or an RBD from an adjacent protomer when modeled using the static structure.",

We then treated the SARS S-2P trimer with trypsin and/or incubation with the ACE2 receptor to assess whether minimal proteolytic action or receptor binding could increase the availability of the \"cryptic\" CR3022 epitope. Incubation of the stabilized S-2P trimer with human ACE2 did not dramatically affect CR3022 binding, while in contrast, the trypsin treatment of the S-2P protein resulted in increased binding akin to the unstabilized S glycoprotein binding, and the level of binding was titratable, with increasing amounts of S-2P resulting in higher CR3022 binding. Given the prior neutralization and protection studies utilizing CR3022, and its ability to complement potent neutralizing antibodies, it is likely that the CR3022 epitope represents a \"cryptic\" epitope that becomes exposed during the processes of viral cell entry.",

A The RBD-CR3022 structure is aligned to the SARS-CoV trimer structure (surface representation; PDB ID: 6CS1), where two RBD molecules are located in the \"up\" conformation. In this static structure, the Fc1 region of CR3022 (ribbon representation) clashes with the NTD of the same protomer. However, the epitope is fully accessible when more than one RBD is in the \"up\" representation. B Biolayer interferometry measurement of CR3022 binding to SARS S proteins with trypsin treatment or ACE2 receptor binding.
