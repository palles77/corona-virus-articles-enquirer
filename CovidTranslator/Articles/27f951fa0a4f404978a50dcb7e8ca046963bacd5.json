The RD114 virus is a recombinant comprising a gag-pol gene from a gammaretrovirus and an env gene from a betaretrovirus [3] . Infectious RD114 virus and RD114-like virus are known to be produced from several feline cell lines, such as CRFK cells derived from feline kidney cells [4] , MCC cells derived from feline large granular lymphoma [5] , and FER cells derived from feline fetal fibroblast cells [2] . ERVs are not generally pathogenic in their original hosts, although some ERVs induce diseases for new host [6, 7] . To detect infectious RD114 virus, a LacZ marker rescue assay has recently been established [8] . Recently Miyazawa et al.

The real-time reverse-transcription-PCR developed can give rapid, sensitive and specific results for the detection of virus infection [10, 11] . To detect RD114 virus, several assays [8, 12] have been developed; however there has been no report on real-time reverse-transcription-PCR. In addition, the newly developed technique employing minor groove binder (MGB) probes can enlarge the difference in Tm values between the target template and other non-specific nucleic acid amplification products, to obtain high specificity [13] . The MGB probe can also improve hybridization stability and reduce the fluorescence background to obtain higher sensitivity [13] . Therefore, we attempted to develop a real-time reverse-transcription-PCR method to detect RD114 virus in canine live vaccines.",

Present data of Fig. 2 showed more than 0.990 of a correlation coefficient between Ct value and the initial virus concentration indicating optimum conditions of a newly established real-time reverse-transcription-PCR. The real-time reverse-transcription-PCR and the LacZ marker rescue assay detect viral RNA and infectious retroviruses, respectively. In other words, the former detects both defective and infectious viral particles, but the latter detects only infectious virus particles. In any case, only the LacZ marker rescue assay method has been established for detection of infectious RD114 virus in vaccines until now. But this method is time consuming, requiring more than 12 days after samples are inoculated into the TE671 cells transduced with the LacZ marker gene. The real-time reverse-transcription-PCR method has advantages over the LacZ marker rescue assay in several ways; ease of use, speed, applicability to general laboratories and particularly the multispecimen material processing performance. PCR methods also generally detect defective viral particles, thereby providing a very useful aid for a screening test. Furthermore, a threshold of only 100 copies could be detected. The canine live vaccines manufactured in cells of feline origin showed positive results for the env gene by the real-time reverse-transcription-PCR, including all of the 8 vaccines produced in feline cell lines that were negative in the LacZ marker rescue assay.",

The results show that mink cells or canine parvovirus seed stocks may be contaminated with the RD114 virus. Since Mv1Lu (mink lung) cells are susceptible to a variety of retroviruses, they have been extensively used for isolation and propagation of endogenous primate retroviruses [14] . This might cause an enormous increase in RD114 virus contamination of the vaccine. The other canine live vaccines manufactured by culturing cells were negative by the real-time reverse-transcription-PCR method, except for those of cat origin. However, it is possible that contamination with low copy numbers of the RD114 virus was not detected. The results of the real-time reverse-transcription-PCR demonstrate that contamination with RD114 virus in Fig. 2 . Specificity and RT efficiency. In LacZ marker rescue assay method, virus concentration ranging from 10 0 to 10 \u00c05 could be detected.

Ct values obtained from virus concentration 10 0 to 10 \u00c06 (R 2 \u00bc 0.993). canine live vaccines predominantly originates in vaccines manufactured in cells of feline origin. This is the first report demonstrating the presence of RD114 virus in canine live vaccines using a real-time reverse-transcription-PCR method with TaqMan MGB probe. 1 RD114 virus productively infects cells from cats and dogs, and may be transmitted to non-feline species in vivo because of the xenotropic features of the virus [2] . As we demonstrated in Table 1 , all feline cell lines produce viral particles which contain RD114 viral RNA. Presumably, feline cell lines used to produce vaccines produce RD114 virus irrespective of the infectivity. At present, a complete risk assessment would be impossible because the minimum infectious dose and pathogenicity, to our knowledge, is still unclear.",
