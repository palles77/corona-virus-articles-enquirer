It is the major site of exposure to foreign antigenic materials such as those present in micro-organisms or food, and the patterns of lymphocyte sensitisation which result have widespread implications for both health and disease. The capacity to develop protective immunity carries with it the potential for coincidental tissue damage to occur. The onset of such hypersensitivity reactions in some patients implies the presence of various predisposing factors. These include the mode of presentation of the antigen, the competence of the immune system encountered, and the genetic constitution of the individual concerned. The importance of these factors can only be appreciated in the context of the normal physiology of the immune system in the gut. The object of this paper is to discuss this and its clinical relevance to paediatric practice, particularly in relation to gastrointestinal infections and food allergy.",

It is now clear that the gut is uniquely structured to promote antigen-lymphocyte interaction. A large proportion of the body's lymphocytes reside in the gastrointestinal tract. They are scattered throughout its length in the lamina propria and epithelium, with aggregations occurring in the Peyer's patches, appendix and tonsils. The cells present include two distinct populations of lymphocytes, one which has passed through the thymus during maturation and participates in cell-mediated reactions (T cells) and one which was first described in the bone marrow and is able to produce antibodies (B cells). There are no afferent lymphatics. Early concepts of antigen access to the mucosa assumed that molecules could pass between or through the epithelial cells at all points. It is now apparent that the Peyer's patches are covered by a specialised epithelium which preferentially allows antigen entry [31] . Beneath this epithelium lies the dome area which contains a large proportion of T lymphocytes. This overlies an area of ceil traffic 0340-6199/80/0133/0201/$ 01.00 containing post-capillary venules, macrophages and B lymphocytes [32] . Sensitised cells pass in efferent lymphatics to the mesenteric lymph nodes and thence to the thoracic duct and the circulation. T and B cell proliferation occurs outside the patches themselves, characteristically taking place in the draining lymph nodes and spleen [34] . The efferent limb of the immune response is mediated by lymphocytes which return to populate the mucosa. Several complicated patterns of recirculation have been identified in animals [13] . Clearly, a system which allows widespread distribution of antigen-reactive cells throughout the mucosa in this way is both elegant and efficient.",

It is synthesised as a dimer in the mucosa and becomes associated with secretory component produced in the epithelial cells. The capacity of the newborn to produce IgA is impaired [43] and the establishment of a normal population of immunoglobulin-bearing cells in the mucosa appears to be closely related to the intestinal contents [7] . IgA antibodies are active against bacteria, viruses and toxins. They also prevent bacterial adherence to the mucosa [45] , and in rats have been shown to prevent albumin absorption following intra-gastric immunisation [17] .

Inbred rats subjected to neonatal thymectomy had significantly greater infection than did control animals [22, 30] . In this system it is unlikely that the mechanism concerned is confined to the classical cellmediated reaction. The parasite N. brasiliensis is known to stimulate remarkable IgE production, a response which is particularly dependent on T-B cell interaction. The partial villous atrophy which occurs in this nematode infection does not develop in thymus-deprived rats [11] , Cellular infiltration of the columnar epithelium and the lamina propria is well documented in jejunal enteropathies [21, 28] . The function of intra-epithelial lymphocytes remains obscure, it is currently thought that they are effector T cells [10] . Their sentinel position at the mucosal surface suggests an important role. The infrastructure of cellular cooperation which underlies all immune reactions has yet to be identified in the gut. Sub-populations of suppressor and helper T lymphocytes will eventually be recognised and in vivo evidence of cell-mediated immunity and antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity will doubtless emerge.",

It has been shown that feeding ovalbumin to mice reduces its subsequent absorption, while simultaneously inducing a state of systemic tolerance [40] .

The commonest of these is selective IgA deficiency.

The mucosa is capable of producing specific IgA antibodies against E. coli [24] but their protective role is not clear. It has been shown that in neonatal animals fed on colostrum, passively transferred immunoglobulins can be protective [23] . In man, gastroenteritis and necrotising enterocolitis are less common in breast-fed infants [35, 1] . The development of a vaccine is complicated by the changing serotypes of the organisms.

Aspects of the mucosal immunology of the poliovirus have been well studied in the development of the Sabin vaccine. The findings indicated that an oral live attenuated vaccine-provoked protective immunity is principally localised in secretory IgA. Despite this finding, other mechanisms are implicated by the work of Mebus et al. [29] who showed that immunity to calf gastroenteritis virus preceded the appearance of specific antibody activity.",

Currently, there is no diagnostic investigation which unequivocally establishes that this has occurred. The many screening tests suggested reflect changes remote from the gut itself. The interpretation of positive skin tests or circulating antibodies to food proteins is notoriously unreliable. The clinician must still rely on meticulous observation, and will find that many children's symptoms may not be reproducible, and that in some patients, non-immunological mechanisms may be involved--such as in lactose malabsorption. Nevertheless, food allergy does exist and is most commonly found in association with cow's milk or egg protein in those children who present with gastrointestinal symptoms. Some patients react immediately, in others the symptoms are delayed and it is evident, both clinically and experimentally, that several different types of reactions are occurring. Until we have a clearer understanding of the fundamental basis of these differences, the distinction between primary and secondary phenomena is blurred. Current views suggest that there is a group of infants who become sensitised to cow's milk protein during an episode of gastroenteritis [20] . Such hypersensitivity is relatively short-lived and even in this group the presence of a jejunal enteropathy is not always associated with continuing disturbances. It has been suggested that infants who are symptomatic on exposure to cow's milk after breast feeding may have been sensitised in the neonatal period at a time when their mucosal IgA production was immature [39] .",
