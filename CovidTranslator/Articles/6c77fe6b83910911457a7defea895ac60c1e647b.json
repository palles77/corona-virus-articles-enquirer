We reported previously the presence of autoantibodies (autoAb) to liver and kidney fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase (FAH) in sera from mice infected with MHV-A59. Long-term MHV-infected mice represented a good model of non-pathogenic autoimmune response since the animals were apparently healthy in spite of the presence of autoAb. The aim of this work was to see whether a severe liver injury, which releases endogenous adjuvants, i.e. danger signals, could elicit a broader spectrum of autoAb and perhaps signs of autoimmune hepatitis. Carbon tetrachloride (CCl 4 ) was injected into mice 30 days after MHV infection, and serum was assayed for autoAb and total IgG 20 days later. The association of MHV infection with the toxic effects of CCl 4 resulted in hypergammaglobulinaemia and the production of autoAb to various liver and kidney proteins. Histological examination of liver samples showed tissue damages but without significant differences between the animals submitted to MHV + CCl 4 and controls, which were either infected by MHV without CCl 4 , or poisoned by CCl 4 in the absence of MHV infection. Those results show that liver injury after viral infection may lead to the spreading of the immune response and to an increase of serum IgG, suggesting that the procedure used herein could simulate the onset of autoimmune hepatitis.",

We have reported the presence of autoantibodies (autoAb) in sera from various mouse strains after MHV-infection [9] . The autoAb were directed to a 40 kDa protein present in mouse liver and kidney identified as fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase (FAH), a soluble cytosolic enzyme that mediates the hydrolytic formation of fumarate and acetoacetate [9] .

Results indicated that various regions of the enzyme are recognized as soon as 15 days after infection and that the autoimmune response is not restricted to peptides homologous to viral proteins [13] . As the spectrum of peptides recognized by the autoAb of a given mouse did not change significantly with time, it was likely that the MHV-elicited autoimmune response did not induce an epitope recognition spreading. It was suspected that the induction of the autoAb was not solely related to molecular or structural mimicry, but was mainly due to the tissue damages caused by the MHV infection. In other words, the danger signals [14] , also called DAMPs (damage-associated molecular patterns) or alarmins, probably played a key role in the autoimmune process.",

In fact, inoculation of susceptible mice with enterotropic virus such as MHV-A59 causes liver lesions as early as 40 h after infection. The injury during the acute phase of hepatitis includes liver focal necrosis, cells undergoing hyaline degeneration and polymorphonuclear leukocytes invasion [22] . Liver regeneration may take place 10-14 days after infection, ranging from complete curing to chronic damage with intermediate stages [22] . On the other hand, CCl 4 metabolization by cytochrome P450 in the hepatocytes produces the highly reactive trichloromethyl radical, which leads to lipid peroxidation and membrane damage, as well as inflammatory response and secretion of cytokines that attract and activate neutrophils [23] . Intriguingly, even if both liver injuries produce violent cell death and thus the potential release of endogenous adjuvants (damage-associated molecular patters, or DAMPs) [20] , CCl 4 did not elicited an autoimmune process, and only autoAb restricted to FAH were detected after MHV infection.",

Unexpectedly, no enhancement of tissue liver damage compared with each treatment alone was observed (Fig. 3) . Thus, although the autoAg recognized by mouse sera were not identified, the autoimmune response shown in this work was somewhat comparable to that described in the various animal models of autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) reported in the literature [15, [24] [25] [26] [27] .",

Here we show that a simple and common phenomenon, i.e., a viral infection followed by a toxic liver injury, may induce certain signs of AIH disease. Additionally, current data indicate that some endogenous danger signals, or DAMPs, may be involved in the production of autoAb to FAH induced by MHV infection [Duhalde Vega et al., manuscript in preparation]. Besides, it has been reported that uric acid could augment humoral immune responses [32] and that various Toll-like receptors associated with the modulation of Tregs may bind alarminssuch as heat shock proteins, high-mobility group Box 1 proteins and chromatin-Ig complexesliberated by injured cells [33, 34] . Thus, it is suggested that endogenous adjuvants liberated by the virus and the hepatotoxic agent could join some Tolllike receptors and inhibit Tregs so inducing some of the AIH signs described in this work.",
