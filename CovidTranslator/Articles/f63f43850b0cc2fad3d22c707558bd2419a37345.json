In 10% to 20% of cases with BA (syndromic BA), there is an association with other specific developmental defects, including a laterality abnormality (situs inversus). Laterality is determined by primary cilia, and genes affecting laterality are involved in the organisation of cilial microtubules within the embryonal central node (4) .",

Fibrocystin is a membrane receptor-like protein encoded by PKHD1, mutations in which result in autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease (14) . This ciliopathy is characterised by dilatation of the collecting ducts and biliary fibrosis due to a ductal plate malformation. Ductal plate malformations are also a recognised feature of BA on histological examination, which suggests a similar pathogenesis to other ciliopathies (3).",

Sequencing PKHD1 revealed a novel mutation in child 9, which is predicted to result in a truncated protein; however, a second PKHD1 mutation was not identified. The single mutation could be a coincidental finding of a child with BA being a carrier of a PKHD1 truncating mutation, but with a population frequency of such carriers of ~1 in 200, this seems unlikely. A second, missed mutation could include a large deletion or an atypical splicing event distant from the splice junctions. Sequencing the promoter region did not identify any variants. An alternative explanation is that a mutation in another gene together with the PKHD1 mutant allele may result in the BA plus renal cyst phenotype. Interestingly, in other ciliopathies such as Bardet-Biedl syndrome and nephronophthisis, oligogenic inheritance involving mutations in more than 1 gene has been reported and may also explain the absence of PKHD1 mutations in the other children with BA with renal cysts (15) .",
