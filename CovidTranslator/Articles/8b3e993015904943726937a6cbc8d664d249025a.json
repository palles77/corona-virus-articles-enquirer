            "text": "The pathogenesis of inflammatory autoimmune diseases of the peripheral nervous system, leading to demyelination and/or axonal damage, remains incompletely understood. In particular, it is controversial regarding the extent to which (i) autoimmunemediated destruction of peripheral nerves results in secondary damage of the central nervous system, and (ii) CD4 and CD8 T cells contribute to disease. To address these issues, we applied the murine model of P0 106 -125 -induced experimental autoimmune neuritis. Immunization of C57BL/6 mice with P0 106 -125 resulted in severe axonal damage and mild demyelination. Importantly, these mice developed a \"dyingback\" axonopathy with apoptosis of a large fraction of neurons in the anterior horn of the lumbar and thoracic spinal cord and a progressive neurogenic muscular atrophy. T cell-depletion experiments identified CD4, but not CD8, T cells as important mediators of experimental autoimmune neuritis. CD4 T cells represented the major cellular source of antigenspecific interferon-\u2425 and interleukin-17 production, regulated the number of tumor necrosis factor-positive and inducible nitric oxide synthase-positive macrophages in the diseased sciatic nerve, and mediated axonal damage and subsequent neuronal apoptosis and neurogenic muscular atrophy. In contrast, the demyelination of peripheral nerves was only slightly ameliorated in CD4 T cell-depleted mice. In conclusion, P0 106 -125 -induced experimental autoimmune neuritis is a CD4 T cell-mediated autoimmune disease that affects both the peripheral and central nervous systems.

            "text": "Autoimmune-mediated diseases of the peripheral nervous system are a heterogeneous group of clinical entities, which are pathologically characterized by demyelination and/or axonal damage. The various immunopathological mechanisms, which underlie these diverse clinical manifestations, as well as the relative importance of axonal damage and demyelination, are still incompletely defined. In particular, the relative contribution of axonal degeneration and/or demyelination to the pathology is still controversially discussed. This also holds true for inflammatory demyelinating diseases of the central nervous system, ie, multiple sclerosis in humans and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis in rodents. In these disorders the extent and severity of inflammation has to some degree observed to be related to the amount of axonal damage. 1 While some authors reported that demyelination precedes and triggers axonal damage (outside-in damage), the extent of which determines the final clinical outcome and degree of neurological disability in multiple sclerosis and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, other groups provided evidence for primary axonal injury, followed by secondary demyelination (inside-out damage). [1] [2] [3] Interestingly, a recent study indicated that axonal injury might herald or trigger demyelination in Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus infection. 2 So far, this issue has not been resolved for autoimmune inflammation of the peripheral nervous system. However, a sound understanding of the underlying immunological mechanisms and pathological responses is a prerequisite to improve or to establish rational therapeutic strategies. In this context, animal models of autoimmune neuritis are useful to prove basic pathogenetic concepts of the corresponding human diseases.",

However, it is still controversial whether CD4 T cells and macrophages are sufficient to induce EAN or whether the integrated attack of CD4 and CD8 T cells, B cells, and macrophages is crucial for immunopathology of EAN. 4 -7 Traditionally, most studies of EAN were performed in rat and disease was induced by either adoptive transfer of autoimmune T cells 8, 9 or by immunization with neuritogenic epitopes of the P2 or the P0 protein, 10 -13 respectively. Recently, we have identified the P0 106 -125 peptide as a neuritogenic epitope in mice. 14 Immunization of C57BL/6 mice with P0 106 -125 induced a well reproducible and robust EAN with axonal neuritis and mild demyelination of peripheral nerves. 14 Clinically, P0 106 -125 -induced EAN was more severe and homogenous compared to murine EAN induced by immunization with the traditionally used P0 180 -199 peptide. 14 -16 Therefore, the improved P0 106 -125 -model of EAN should allow a clear dissection of pathogenetic mechanisms.",

At day 40 p.i., the anterior horn of the spinal cord harbored patchy loss of neurons (L\u00fc ckenfelder). Remaining neurons were viable, had a triangular shape with a round nucleus, a prominent basophilic nucleolus, without evidence for chromatolysis or nuclear fragmentation, a normal cytoplasm, and a prominent axon (Figures 5C and  6C ). Neuronal viability was further confirmed by a prominent nuclear and cell surface expression of NeuN ( Figure  6C , inset) and synaptophysin, respectively, indicative of a normal nuclear structure and synaptic density. Negative TUNEL staining lends further support to the absence of neuronal apoptosis ( Figure 5A) . A strong and ubiquitous NF protein expression evidenced a dense axonal network, and axonal damage as well as demyelination was absent. In the spinal cord parenchyma as well as in In an anti-CD4-treated mouse, the number of activated F4/80 \u03e9 endoneurial macrophages is significantly reduced as compared to rat IgG-treated animals (A). Correspondingly, iNOS is weakly expressed by only few macrophages (inset). Anti-F4/80 immunostaining; original magnification \u03eb800. Inset: anti-iNOS immunostaining; original magnification \u03eb400. E: Axonal loss is less severe in an anti-CD4-treated mouse as compared to rat IgG-treated animals (B). Immunofluorescence with anti-neurofilament antibodies and FITC-conjugated mouse anti-rat IgG; original magnification \u03eb400. F: There is no axonal swelling in the sciatic nerve of an anti-CD4-treated mouse as compared to the rat IgG-treated animal (C). Anti-\u2423-APP immunostaining; original magnification \u03eb400.",

In CD4 and CD8 T cell-depleted mice, the number of P0 106 -125 -specific IFN-\u2425-producing cells was massively reduced in PLN and spleen (Figure 7 , A-C) illustrating that the immunization with P0 106 -125 induced antigenspecific T cells.

In anti-CD4-treated mice, only very small numbers of P0 106 -125 -specific IFN-\u2425-producing cells were detectable in PLN and spleen, whereas the depletion of CD8 T cells did not significantly reduce numbers of P0 106 -125 -specific IFN-\u2425-producing cells compared to rat IgG-treated mice (Figure 7 , A-C).

In fact, nitric oxide can promptly and reversibly block axonal conduction, which is impaired in P0 106 -125induced EAN as shown previously. 14 nitric oxide affects several axonal channels, including sodium, potassium, and calcium channels and may block them, thereby impairing conduction. 19 In this regard, murine EAN is similar to multiple sclerosis, in which the extent of axonal destruction is related to the number of activated macrophages, which are present in close apposition with injured axons. 19, 21 The rather mild demyelination of the sciatic nerve in murine P0 106 -125 -induced EAN may occur secondarily to axonal damage or, mutually not exclusive, may also be caused by iNOS-and TNF-producing macrophages, and may render axons more sensitive to nitric oxide toxicity, since demyelinated axons are particularly vulnerable to the axonal conduction blocking effects of nitric oxide. 22 This scenario is supported by our finding that a depletion of CD4 T cells resulted in a clinically highly attenuated EAN with significantly reduced numbers of iNOS \u03e9 and TNF \u03e9 macrophages in the sciatic nerve. The severity of sciatic nerve damage P0 106 -125 -induced EAN is further highlighted by the prominent neurogenic muscular atrophy.

In addition, CD4 T cells produced IL-17. Since IL-17-producing CD4 T cells play a crucial role in the development of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, 23 this cytokine may also be important in our EAN model.

Even mice having been depleted of both CD4 and CD8 T cells developed EAN on immunization with the P0 106 -125 peptide, although with a significantly milder degree. The remaining low disease activity of CD4 T cell-depleted mice is in accordance with studies in CD4 \u03ea/\u03ea , CD8 \u03ea/\u03ea , and CD4 \u03ea CD8 \u03ea mutant C57BL/6 mice, 7,24 which argues against an induction of EAN in our T cell-depleted animals by the remaining small number of T cells (\u05453%). Furthermore, neuropathological analysis of serial immunostained sections confirmed the absence of the respective T cell population in the sciatic nerve and the spinal cord. Collectively, these clinical and neuropathological observations point to the involvement of other cell populations in the pathogenesis of EAN. As CD4 and CD4 plus CD8 T cell-depleted mice still mounted a weak residual IFN-\u2425 response in the spleen and PLN, one may suggest that \u2425\u2426 CD8 \u03e9 T cells and NK cells, which are a cellular source of IFN-\u2425, 25 also play a role in P0 106 -125 -induced EAN.

            "text": "The relative impact of CD4 and CD8 T cells on the various manifestations of EAN is still controversially discussed. The significantly reduced clinical disease activity in mice lacking CD4 T cells was attributed to a remarkably less severe axonal neuropathy of the sciatic nerve, whereas the mild demyelination was less affected. The latter may be caused by iNOS-and TNF-producing endoneurial macrophages, which still were present in both CD4 and CD4 & CD8 T cell-depleted mice, albeit in significantly reduced number. These findings point to a particular impact of CD4 T cells on axonal damage and also highlight the importance of axonal damage for clinical disability in EAN. Clinically relevant, patients with the axonal variant of the Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome have an explosive onset and a more severe clinical course as compared to those with the demyelinating variant. 27 Moreover, patients with multifocal motor neuropathy present with more pronounced and progressive neurogenic muscular atrophy, 28 which is also a prominent feature of P0 106 -125 -induced EAN. In addition, in multiple sclerosis, axonal loss, but not demyelination, is associated with irreversible neurological disability. 2, 19, 29 A comprehensive neuropathological investigation of the sciatic nerve as target organ of the autoimmune response as well as the spinal cord and the gastrocnemius muscle revealed that in the absence of prominent inflammatory infiltrates a significant fraction, ie, up to 44%, of lumbar and thoracic spinal cord motor neurons underwent apoptosis. This remarkable extent of apoptotic neurons may account for the persistence of clinical symptoms up to day 22 p.i. Our observation of a complete remission of neurological symptoms at later time points, ie, 40 days p.i. 14 and this study , points to the existence of functional regenerative processes. In this scenario, classical compensation by collateral re-innervation may be the most important factor. In fact, collateral re-innervation was prominent in the gastrocnemius muscle of rat IgG and anti-CD8-treated mice at day 40 p.i. Remarkably, although CD4-and CD4&CD8-depleted mice exhibited only minor symptoms of EAN, these slight alterations were sufficient to stimulate collateral innervation, albeit to a remarkably lesser extent as compared to rat IgGtreated mice. In contrast, the persistence of a reduced number of viable anterior horn neurons in rat IgG-and anti-CD8-treated mice argues against a compensatory effect by the generation of new functionally active neurons in these animals. In addition, the production of neurotrophic factors, eg, brain-derived neurotrophic factor, which can also be produced by autoimmune T cells, 30 -32 may play a role. However, CD4 & CD8 T cell depleted mice also recovered from their mild EAN indicating that T cells are more important for disease induction than for recovery.",

[33] [34] [35] [36] Our histopathological and immunohistochemical observations viable and structurally unimpaired neurons as well as of a normal neurono-axonal system at day 40 p.i., ie, a late time point when clinical symptoms have subsided, lend further support to the concept of a dying back axonopathy underlying the spinal cord damage as opposed to a primary neuronopathy. Interestingly, in multiple sclerosis, neuronal damage has gained increasing attention recently as a key feature of pathology. 21, 29 In principle, axonal and neuronal injury in the spinal cord as well as other regions of the central nervous system may be caused in a both antigen-specific as well as antigennonspecific manner, either by CD8 T cells or macrophages, respectively. T cells aligning along axons and soma of neurons induce substantial neuronal loss in a cell contact-dependent mechanism involving Fas (CD95)-FasL (CD95L) interactions, 37, 38 and blocking CD95 activity prevents motor neurons from undergoing apoptosis in models of facial nerve axotomy and spinal ischemia. 38 Since in our model of EAN, T cells were consistently absent from the gray matter of the spinal cord as well as from the (overlying) leptomeninges and Fas was not upregulated on motor neurons, a T cell mediated neuronal destruction is very unlikely to account for the prominent loss of neurons, neither by CD8 T cells nor by CD4 T cells, which may also damage neurons via expression of TNF-related apoptosis inducing ligand. 29 In addition, IFN-\u2425-activated macrophages/microglial cells may damage neurons by inducing oxidative stress via their production of TNF and iNOS/ nitric oxide. 17, 39 However, in murine P0 106 -125 -induced EAN, there was no evidence for a direct macrophage-induced damage of spinal cord neurons, since microglial activation was only moderate and iNOS-expressing macrophages/microglial cells were not associated with neurons in the anterior horn. Only rarely, activated microglial cells/macrophages were observed in the vicinity of neurons, which unequivocally showed evidence for apoptosis, and this colocalization was most likely part of the process of neuronophagia. Collectively, these observations indicate that neuronal loss occurs secondarily to inflammation-induced axonal damage of the sciatic nerve. In fact, leukocytic infiltrates were largely confined to the sciatic nerve, the target organ of the autoimmune response. A similar mechanism underlies retinal ganglion cell degeneration in optic neuritis. 40 Thus, this study identifies experimental murine P0 106 -125induced EAN as a disease involving both the peripheral nervous system and central nervous system. These observations have implications for the pathogenesis of autoimmune T cell-mediated diseases of peripheral nerves, and clinically relevance for the development of specific therapeutic strategies aiming to inhibit the autoimmune attack against peripheral nerves and to prevent a dying back axonopathy, in particular, by conferring axonal protection, which is of upmost importance for the final clinical outcome.",

Arrows point to axonal damage in association with early damage of myelin sheaths, which, however, are not yet disrupted. B: In a longitudinal section of the sciatic nerve of a rat IgG-treated mouse, myelin sheaths too thin in relation to their axonal diameter are present (arrows). Macrophages (*) are associated with loss of damaged nerve fibers. C: Severe neurogenic atrophy of the gastrocnemius muscle in a rat IgG-treated mouse. The endomysial tissue harbors leukocytes, which have also invaded damaged muscle fibers (*). Groups of small, angulated muscle fibers, which are partly or completely atrophic, and single hypertrophic fibers indicate the severe and progressive neurogenic atrophy (inset). D: As compared to a rat IgG-treated mouse (A), the axons in the sciatic nerve of an anti-CD4-treated mouse are only mildly damaged as evidenced by a normal density of nerve fibers with intact central axons. Only occasionally, myelin sheaths are fragmented (arrow). E: In an anti-CD4-treated mouse, fragments of myelin are phagocytosed (*), whereas only single nerve fibers of the sciatic nerve show condensed axons (arrow) indicating a markedly reduced axonal damage as compared to rat IgG-treated animals (B). F: Corresponding to the reduced axonal damage in the sciatic nerve (D, E), neurogenic atrophy of the gastrocnemius muscle is less severe in an anti-CD4-treated mouse as evidenced by single, partly atrophic muscle fibers in the absence of myophagia.
