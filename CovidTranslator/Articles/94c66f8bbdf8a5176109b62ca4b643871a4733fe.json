            "text": "Picornavirus replication is critically dependent on the correct processing of a polyprotein precursor by 3C protease(s) (3C pro ) at multiple specific sites with related but non-identical sequences. To investigate the structural basis of its cleavage specificity, we performed the first crystallographic structural analysis of non-covalent complexes of a picornavirus 3C pro with peptide substrates. The X-ray crystal structure of the foot-and-mouth disease virus 3C pro , mutated to replace the catalytic Cys by Ala and bound to a peptide (APAKQ|LLNFD) corresponding to the P5-P5\u2032 region of the VP1-2A cleavage junction in the viral polyprotein, was determined up to 2.5 \u00c5 resolution. Comparison with free enzyme reveals significant conformational changes in 3C pro on substrate binding that lead to the formation of an extended interface of contact primarily involving the P4-P2\u2032 positions of the peptide. Strikingly, the deep S1\u2032 specificity pocket needed to accommodate P1\u2032-Leu only forms when the peptide binds. Substrate specificity was investigated using peptide cleavage assays to show the impact of amino acid substitutions within the P5-P4\u2032 region of synthetic substrates. The structure of the enzyme-peptide complex explains the marked substrate preferences for particular P4, P2 and P1 residue types, as well as the relative promiscuity at P3 and on the P\u2032 side of the scissile bond. Furthermore, crystallographic analysis of the complex with a modified VP1-2A peptide (APAKE|LLNFD) containing a Gln-to-Glu substitution reveals an identical mode of peptide binding and explains the ability of foot-and-mouth disease virus 3C pro to cleave sequences containing either P1-Gln or P1-Glu. Structure-based mutagenesis was used to probe interactions within the S1\u2032 specificity pocket and to provide direct evidence of the important contribution made by Asp84 of the Cys-His-Asp catalytic triad to proteolytic activity. Our results provide a new level of detail in our understanding of the structural basis of polyprotein cleavage by 3C pro .",

            "text": "FMDV is a single-stranded positive-sense RNA virus belonging to the picornavirus family that also includes human pathogens such as poliovirus (PV), human rhinovirus (HRV) and hepatitis A virus (HAV). Picornaviruses share a common replication strategy in which the viral RNA genome is translated in the cytoplasm of infected cells as a long polyprotein precursor that is cleaved by virally encoded proteases to release functional proteins needed for the synthesis of new virions. In all cases, 3C pro performs the majority of these cleavages (10 out of 13 for FMDV) by targeting specific sequences within the polyprotein. 2, 5, 6 Structural studies on picornaviral 3C pro revealed an overall fold that closely resembles the architecture of trypsin-like serine proteases. [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] The peptidebinding cleft, which contains the active site at its centre, is located at the interface between two \u03b2barrels. Unusually, picornaviral 3C pro possess a Cys-His-Asp/Glu catalytic triad at the centre of this cleft, instead of the Ser-His-Asp arrangement of active-site residues that is commonly found in serine proteases. [12] [13] [14] Most investigations of the cleavage specificity of picornaviral 3C pro have relied on extensive sequence analyses of cleavage junctions within the polyprotein 3, 15 or on in vitro cleavage assays using protein or peptide substrates. 8, [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] There is a surprising degree of variability in the sequences of polyprotein junctions that are cleaved by picornaviral 3C pro , but these studies have nevertheless been valuable in identifying residues in the substrate that are important determinants of cleavage. Most picornavirus 3C pro cleave the peptide bond between a highly conserved P1-Gln/P1\u2032-Gly pair 15, 21 (where P1 and P1\u2032 denote the first amino acids on the Nterminal and C-terminal sides of the scissile bond, respectively; in this notation, 22 the corresponding subsites on the enzyme are labelled S1 and S1\u2032). FMDV 3C pro is an interesting exception to this general pattern, since it exhibits a preference either for substrates in which P1-Gln is followed by a relatively large apolar amino acid in the P1\u2032 position or for P1\u2032Glu/P1\u2032Gly junctions. 3 HAV 3C pro can also tolerate larger P1\u2032 amino acids in substrates with P1-Gln. 21 Other positions in the peptide also contribute to substrate recognition; in general, there is a preference for a hydrophobic residue at P4, 16, 18, 19 and the nature of the P2 and P2\u2032 amino acids, which vary between different picornavirus families, can also be important. 8 Extensive structural analysis of trypsin-like serine proteases has revealed a common mode of substrate binding in which the polypeptide sequence recog-nised by the enzyme lies in an extended conformation (similar to a \u03b2-strand) within the peptide-binding cleft. 23 These enzymes typically recognise the alternating positions of the side chains along the sequence that are characteristic of an extended backbone conformation, and this serves to place the scissile bond in the correct orientation at the active site. The primary specificity determinants in trypsin-like serine proteases are commonly located within the P4-P1 sequence, [24] [25] [26] but can extend well beyond this core region for enzymes that are highly specific. 27 Crystallographic analysis of enzyme-substrate complexes reveals that viral 3C-like proteases, such as tobacco etch virus NIa protease (TEV pro ) 28 or severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus main protease, 29 fall into the latter group, since contacts with the enzyme can involve up to five or six amino acids on either side of the cleavage site. However, although both of these proteases are '3C-like' in structure and have the common trypsin-like fold, they exhibit substantial differences from one another and from genuine picornaviral 3C pro , especially in the loops that define the peptide-binding surface.",

Overall, it is notable that, within the context of the VP1-2A sequence, variation at all positions from P4 to P1\u2032 (inclusive) can reduce the rate of peptide cleavage by FMDV 3C pro to between 0% and 50% of the rate observed with the control peptide (Fig. 1a) . In contrast, variation at the P5 and P4\u2032 positions at the extremities of the peptide had little impact on peptide cleavage. With one exception, these results are consistent with a previous alanine-scanning analysis of the peptide. 8 They confirm the importance of positions P4, P2, P1 and P1\u2032 for substrate recognition, but reveal, for example, that residues at the P3 position can also contribute to cleavage specificity. The only inconsistency noted is that substitution of P4\u2032-Phe (by Arg, Pro or Ala) had little effect on peptide cleavage in the fluorescence assay, whereas it had been found previously in an HPLC-based assay that substitution by Ala abrogated cleavage. 8 The origin of this discrepancy is unknown, but the structural results are consistent with more recent findings indicating that the P4\u2032 residue is unlikely to contribute significantly to substrate specificity (see the text below).",

The P4-Pro side chain is not completely buried, since one flank containing the C \u03b4 atom faces outward and is solvent exposed. This part of the side chain is quite close to the carbonyl oxygen of Val141 and to the side-chain hydroxyl of Tyr190 (4.2 \u00c5 in each case). Intriguingly, mutation of the P4 residue to Val, Leu or Ile completely abrogated cleavage of the fluorescent substrate ( Fig. 1a) , consistent with a previous observation that an Ala substitution at this position also prevented cleavage. 8 These results suggest that, at least within the context of the VP1-2A peptide, there is a strict requirement for P4-Pro. Although the structure suggests that Ala and Val side chains, which are similar in size to Pro, should be accommodated in the S4 pocket, they may nevertheless affect the binding conformation sufficiently to prevent proper presentation of the scissile bond to the active site. This is a rather surprising result given the evident malleability of the protease. It is also unexpected, since Ala, Val and Ile are observed at P4 in other FMDV polyprotein cleavage junctions, albeit within the context of different sequences (see Table 2 in Birtley et al. 8 ).",

Formation of the S2 pocket appears to be dependent on peptide binding, since Leu142, Asp144 and Asp146 all adjust their positions in the presence of substrate (Fig. 1e) . The salt bridges to the pair of Asp residues in the \u03b2-ribbon explain the strong preference for P2-Lys in natural substrates (although it is not yet clear why this preference is strongest in substrates with P1-Gln 3 ). Consistent with the acidic nature of the distal end of the S2 pocket, incorporation at P2 of norleucine (which is structurally similar to Lys but lacks the amine group) abrogates cleavage, whereas substitution by Arg or ornithine (both of which have a positive charge at the tip of the side chain) only modestly reduces the rate of peptide cleavage (Fig. 1a) . Curiously, substitution by Thr also abrogates cleavage, even though this residue is found in other natural FMDV 3C pro substrates; 8 it may be that Thr is tolerated at P2 only in the context of the variation of the amino acids at other positions in the peptide substrate.",

The pocket therefore displays good chemical complementarity to the P1-Gln side chain. However, peptide cleavage assays previously showed that incorporation of Glu at this position only reduces the cleavage rate by a factor of 2, 8 consistent with the common occurrence of P1-Glu in FMDV 3C pro substrates. 3 To investigate this finding in more detail, we determined the crystal structure of 3C pro bound to a modified VP1-2A peptide, in which P1-Gln is substituted by P1-Glu (VP1-2Am). The structure reveals that the P1-Glu side chain binds in a manner that is almost identical with that observed for P1-Gln in the VP1-2A peptide ( Fig. 2c and d) . One oxygen atom from the P1-Glu side-chain carboxylate (OE1) makes two hydrogen bonds (ranging in length from 2.4 to 2.8 \u00c5 over the four independent structures) to His181 and Thr158, but the other carboxylate oxygen (OE2) is more distant from the main-chain carbonyl oxygen of Thr158 (3.2-3.7 \u00c5) and-assuming that the sidechain carboxylate is deprotonated-cannot form a hydrogen bond. The fact that the OE2 oxygen is also exposed to solvent (Fig. 2d ) may also attenuate any negative impact on binding by allowing access to positive counterions in the cytoplasm of infected cells.",

The largely apolar sides of the S1\u2032 pocket are formed on one side by Pro44, His46, Leu47 and the aliphatic flank of Glu50, and by Ala29 and Cys31 on the other side.

(c) Comparative activity of FMDV 3C pro S1\u2032 mutants measured in the fluorescent peptide cleavage assay using the synthetic FRET4 substrate, 31 Mutagenic analysis of the S1\u2032 specificity pocket As described above, the co-crystal structure of 3C pro with the VP1-2A peptide revealed that binding of the peptide necessitated movement of Leu47 to create a pocket deep enough to accommodate the P1\u2032-Leu side chain (Fig. 1e) . This S1\u2032 pocket is the site of an interesting difference in specificity between FMDV 3C pro , on one hand, and 3C pro from HRV and PV, on the other hand. Whereas FMDV 3C pro preferentially cleaves Gln-Xaa junctions (where Xaa is predominantly Leu, Ile or Thr), 3 HRV and PV 3C pro have a marked preference for cleavage at Gln-Gly junctions. 15 Comparison of the protease structures readily accounts for this difference, since the Cys31-Leu47 residues that form the floor of the shallow S1\u2032 pocket in the free form of FMDV 3C pro are replaced by Phe25-Ala41 in 3C pro from HRV (PDB ID 1cqq 25 ) and PV (PDB ID 1l1n 10 ) ( Fig. 2c and e; Supplementary Fig. 4) . Examination of these structures suggests that steric hindrance would prevent the movement of Phe25 that would be necessary to accommodate a large P1\u2032 side chain.",

In this assay, the primary cleavage observed is located at the Glu-Ser junction; further cleavage at the Glu-Gly junctions within 3B 1 -3B 2 -3B 3 may be impeded by the low solubility of this fragment ( Fig. 3a and b) . Under the assay conditions used, wild-type FMDV 3C pro cleaves over 95% of the substrate within 10 min. The single mutation C31F drastically reduced the ability of the protease to cleave this protein substrate; no cleavage was evident after a 1h incubation (Fig. 3b) , and very partial cleavage was observed after 4 h ( Supplementary Fig. 3 ). We estimate that the reduction in activity is approximately 200-fold. In contrast, mutation to the much smaller Ala side chain (C31A) had essentially no effect on the proteolytic activity of 3C pro in this assay (Fig. 3b) . The considerable reduction in protease activity due to the C31F substitution is probably due to the steric strain that arises from the close packing of the large side chains of Phe31 and Leu47 in the S1\u2032 binding pocket of the mutant, which may have a knock-on effect on the position of His46, a key component of the catalytic triad (compare Fig. 2c  and e; Supplementary Fig. 4 ). This interpretation is strongly supported by the finding that the C31F/ L47A double mutation, which reduces the size of the side chain opposite Phe31 and generates an S1\u2032 pocket that resembles that found in HRV and PV 3C pro , restores near-wild-type cleavage activity (Fig.  3b) . The C31A/L47A double mutant is slightly impaired compared to the wild-type protease, perhaps because the P1\u2032 residue is bound less tightly in the enlarged S1\u2032 pocket.",

Previously, we mutated C142 to prevent aggregation of the protein due to formation of intermolecular disulphide bonds, but found that substitution by a large hydrophobic side chain was necessary to preserve the catalytic activity of the protease. 12, 13 Although slightly larger, Leu is a reasonable structural mimic of Cys, and the structure of the 3C pro -peptide complex confirms our previous conclusion that the apolarity of C142 in the wild-type protein is necessary for its interaction with the P4 and P2 residues to ensure a correct presentation of the polypeptide substrate to the active site. 12 Consistent with this idea, introduction of the C142L mutation into a type O1K FMDV had no significant effect on the infectivity of the virus in tissue culture (Fig. 5) . This observation and the fact that the equivalent residue in HRV and PV 3C pro is a leucine (Leu127) nevertheless beg the question, \"Why is Cys142 strictly conserved in FMDV 3C pro ?\" We speculate that this may confer a selective advantage during infection of natural hosts by permitting inactivation of the protease on cell lysis.",

The mode of peptide binding is similar to that observed in HRV and HAV 3C pro complexed with covalently attached peptide-like inhibitors [24] [25] [26] and with peptide complexes of other trypsin-like proteases 37 in that the peptide adopts a linear extended conformation that places the P1 side chain into the S1 specificity pocket within the C-terminal \u03b2-barrel, immediately adjacent to the catalytic triad. The mode of binding in FMDV 3C pro involves the five main-chain-main-chain hydrogen bonds between the enzyme and the P3-P1\u2032 positions on the peptide that are conserved in trypsin-like proteases and appear to be necessary for proper positioning of the scissile bond in the active site. 27 However, the structure reveals that the enzymesubstrate interaction extends well outside this core region; all side chains from P4-P4\u2032 are involved to a greater or lesser extent in contacts with the surface of 3C pro . Overall, the structure of the complex is highly consistent with the results of experiments performed to probe the effect of variation in side chains at different positions within the peptide substrate on cleavage rates, which suggest that the region P4-P2\u2032 contributes most to peptide specificity. This is probably because these six residues occupy the deepest part of the surface groove that forms the peptide-binding cleft (Fig. 1c) .",

For example, it is notable that, within the context of the VP1-2A cleavage junction sequence, conservative substitution of P4-Pro with residues such as Val or Ala that occur at this position in other junctions leads to complete abrogation of peptide cleavage (Fig. 1a) . The effect of these substitutions is all the more surprising given the evident flexibility displayed by the protease (Fig.  1e ; Supplementary Movie 1), but it is perhaps a reflection of the important role played by sites remote from the scissile bond in peptide cleavage efficiency. 27, 37 The extensive interface of contact between the peptide and the protease in FMDV 3C pro exhibits similarities to that observed in the 3C-like TEV pro , which was solved in complex with a peptide that spanned positions P7-P3\u2032 28 ( Fig. 1c and d) . Superposition of the two structures shows that the backbone geometry is similar over the common P4-P3\u2032 region. Structural similarity is closest for the core segment centred on the scissile bond (P2-P2\u2032; root-mean-squared deviation over C a = 0.14 \u00c5), but there are significant structural deviations outside this region, dictated by the differing topologies of the peptide-binding cleft. In particular, TEV pro provides a much more enclosed binding site for the P4-P3 residues due to the close apposition of the C-terminal \u03b2-ribbon with the E 2 -F 2 loop in the Cterminal \u03b2-barrel (Fig. 1d) .",

These observations are broadly consistent with previous NMR analyses of HRV 3C pro , which revealed flexibility throughout the enzyme that was attenuated by interactions between the protein and a peptide-like inhibitor spanning P6-P1. 24 These marked conformational changes associated with peptide binding to FMDV 3C pro are in contrast to the relatively rigid lock-and-key binding of some protein inhibitors to trypsin-like proteases 38, 42 and underscore the importance of the structural analysis of the peptide-bound form in obtaining a more complete picture of the substrate basis of cleavage specificity. This information is of particular relevance to inhibitor design, although further structural analyses of FMDV 3C pro bound to different peptide sequences will be needed to map out the full extent of structural changes that accompany substrate binding.",

This explains the strict requirement for small P1\u2032 side chains (most often Gly) in substrates for 3C pro from HRV and PV. 15, 21 In contrast, HAV 3C pro , like FMDV 3C pro , is tolerant of larger P1\u2032 residues (e.g., R, V and M). 21 Since it has an M29/A45 pair of residues flanking the S1\u2032 pocket, we suggest that the Met29 side chain may have the ability to move to accommodate larger P1\u2032 side chains.",

It is therefore difficult to understand why FMDV 3C pro readily cleaves substrates with P1-Gln or P1-Glu, while HRV 3C pro exhibits a strong preference for P1-Gln substrates. 15, 17, 20 The discrepancy is all the more remarkable, since the residues primarily responsible for P1-Gln or Glu recognition in FMDV 3C pro (Thr158, Tyr154 and His181) are conserved in the P1-Gln-specific HRV 3C pro and in the P1-Gluspecific V8 protease from Staphylococcus aureus. 44 Given the close structural similarity between FMDV and HRV 3C pro in the S1 pocket, why does HRV 3C pro discriminate so strongly against P1-Glu? In the coronavirus main protease from tobacco etch virus, the selectivity for P1-Gln is enforced by an interaction between the Gln side-chain amide and the carboxylate of Asp148 (Fig. 2f) ; 28 clearly, the presence of this negatively charged side chain strongly disfavours binding of substrates with P1-Glu. However, HRV 3C pro lacks an equivalent repulsive group (Fig. 2e) , and it remains unclear how discrimination against P1-Glu substrates is achieved.",

The protease structure from this model was then used to solve the structure of the 3C pro -VP1-2Am complex, again using Phaser. 46 In that case, four molecules were identified in the asymmetric unit; the overall log likelihood gain was 3981. Manual model adjustment and refinement of both models were performed with O 32 and CNS, 47 respectively.",

Up to four different codons (CTN) for leucine (L) could have been generated to replace the Cys (C) residue codon (TGC) in this procedure, but only two were used. The mutant PCR product, including the EcoRI (nt 5058)-PstI (nt 6209) region (numbered according to accession no. X00871), was inserted into the pCR-XL-TOPO vector (Invitrogen), and individual plasmids were sequenced. The EcoRI-PstI fragments containing the CTA (C142L1) and CTG (C142L2) codons were excised and reconstructed into pT7S3 via an intermediate plasmid containing the BamHI fragment (nt 2909-7117). The fulllength wild-type and mutant plasmids were linearised with HpaI, and RNA transcripts were prepared using T7 RNA polymerase (T7 Megascript kit; Ambion). The transcripts were introduced into BHK cells by electroporation, essentially as described previously. 49 Complete cytopathic effect was apparent following overnight incubation. Rescued virus harvests were passaged once in BHK cells, and then RNA was extracted using a viral RNA extraction kit (Qiagen). RT-PCRs, with or without reverse transcriptase, were performed using the primers (3AEcofor and 3CPstrev, as described above) for 25 cycles. The expected products were only observed in the presence of the reverse transcriptase (this ensured that products were derived from the viral RNA and not from residual cDNA template), then the amplicons were sequenced using the same primers and maintained the respective wild-type or mutant sequences as anticipated (data not shown).",
