The canine glossitis virus (WSU 79-1831) was grown in Crande]l feline kidney (CrFK) cells and had a titer of 105.3 TCID50 per ml. Specimen preparation for electron microscopy consisted of inoculation of a roller tube of either Vero cells or CrFK cells with 0.1 ml of the respective stock virus. After 1 hour incubation, cell culture medium was added and the tubes incubated at 37\u00b0C on a roller drum. When the cells showed 3-}-cytopathogenic effect the tubes were frozen and thawed one time and centrifuged at 2000 \u00d7 g for 10 minutes. An aliquot (480 ~l) of supernatant from the tube was further clarified by centrifugation in a Beckman Airfuge 30 \u00b0 fixed angle rotor at 23,000 x g for 5 minutes. The virus-containing supernatant was then centrifuged in the aforementioned apparatus at 165,000 \u00d7 g for 10 minutes. The pelleted virus was resuspended in 50 ~l of distilled water and was pelleted directly onto a carbon coated gI~d using the Beckman Airfuge E~-90 rotor at 118,000 Xg for l0 minutes. The grids were stained with 1.5 percent phosphotungstic acid for i minute, blotted dry, and examined with a Philips 300 transmission electron microscope at 80 kV. The viruses were sized by using a stock culture of tobacco mosaic virus for internal size standardization. The mink calicivirus (MV 20-3) had exhibited properties consistent with the ealicivirus family in earlier studies (6) . These features included: physieochemical properties; growth in Vero cells; and electron microscopy of cell-associated virus particles. The results from this study confirmed that the virus was structurally related to the calicivirus family. The virus particles were approximately 35--40 nm in diameter with a patterned dark staining surface (Fig. 1) . Higher magnification revealed t0 evenly spaced cup-shaped depressions on the periphery of the virions (Fig. 2) .",
