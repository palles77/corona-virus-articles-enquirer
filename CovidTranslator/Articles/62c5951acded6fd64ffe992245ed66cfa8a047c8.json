            "text": "During infection, viruses hijack various host cell components and programs for their amplification, among which is the canonical ERK signaling pathway, mainly consisting of three tiered serine/threonine kinases, Raf, MEK and ERK. MEK1 and MEK2 are two isoforms of the kinase operating immediately upstream of ERK, and connecting Raf and ERK by phosphorylating ERK. Previous studies have suggested that different isoforms of MEK have distinct biological functions, although their in vitro kinase function may be redundant. However, little is known about the isoform-specific effects of these kinases on viral propagation. In this study, we showed that herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) infection of human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells induced a sustained activation of ERK1/2. Inhibition of this ERK activation by U0126, a specific inhibitor of MEK1/2, severely impaired virus production. A similar reduction of virus production was also seen following transfection of cells with siRNAs for MEK1/2. Interestingly, a specific knockdown of MEK1 with siRNAs caused a marked inhibition of viral titers, viral proteins and virus-induced cytopathic effect (CPE), whereas silencing MEK2 had little effect. Therefore, our results demonstrate that MEK1 and MEK2 act differently and that HSV-2 hijacks host MEK1 for its own amplification. To our knowledge, this is the first report showing inhibition of HSV-2 replication by targeting human MEK1. This study also suggests that MEK1 could be a potential target for anti-HSV-2 therapy, which may minimize damage to the host cells engendered by targeting both MEK1 and MEK2.",

HSV-2 is characterized by a short cytolytic replication cycle in permissive cells and an ability to establish latency in sensory ganglia (Brooks et al., 2004; Weir, 2001; Whitley, 2004) . It accounts for about 2/3 of all new genital infections, causing mainly herpes lesions on external areas of the genital organs (Brooks et al., 2004; Sizemore et al., 2006) , it is also the most common cause of neonatal herpes (Hill and Roberts, 2005; Yamashita and Morishima, 2006) . Overall, infection with HSV-2 produces strong morbidity and shows broad prevalence, long latency, and difficult curability. To date, no preventive vaccines or effective therapeutic drugs for recurrent infections are available.",

            "text": "The extracellular signal regulated kinase (ERK) cascade is one of the three major mitogenactivated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades, and consists of three tiered serine/threonine kinases of Raf, MAPK/ERK(MEK) and ERK (Chang et al., 2003; Cohen, 1997; McCubrey et al., 2007; Zhang and Liu, 2002) . Raf, consisting of three isoforms, Raf-1, B-Raf and A-Raf, activates very few partners other than MEKs, and no other substrates for MEK than ERK (i.e. ERK1, ERK2) have been found to date (Chambard et al., 2007) . Thus, The second kinase comprising two isoforms, MEK1 and MEK2, plays a key role in connecting the Raf and ERK. The inhibition of MEK has been studied as the most effective way of investigating the importance of the Raf/MEK/ERK signaling cascade in various cellular physiological and pathological processes (Kelemen et al., 2002; Kohno and Pouyssegur, 2006; Luo et al., 2002; McCubrey et al., 2007; Shakibaei et al., 2001; Yip-Schneider and Schmidt, 2003; Zheng et al., 2003) . In many scenarios, MEK1 and MEK2 are functionally interchangeable, however more recent studies have added complexity to the signaling functions of MEK1 and MEK2 in terms of their interactions with activators and substrates, responses to extracellular factors, and various cellular functions they regulate (Belanger et al., 2003; Skarpen et al., 2008; Ussar and Voss, 2004) . For example, only 40% of identity is found in the N-terminal region of MEK containing the characteristic proline-rich inserts that are involved in interactions with activators and substrates (Enslen and Davis, 2001; Kolch, 2000) . MEK1 but not MEK2 forms a signaling complex with Raf-1, suggesting that in some cells the Raf-1 signaling pathway preferentially activates ERKs via MEK1 (Jelinek et al., 1994) . Furthermore, MEK1 and MEK2 have distinct ways to regulate ERK activity and cell cycle progression (Ussar and Voss, 2004) . In addition, different phenotypes have been demonstrated in MEK1 and MEK2 knockout mice (Belanger et al., 2003; Giroux et al., 1999) . All these studies indicate MEK1 and MEK2 exhibit different biological functions.",

Numerous studies have demonstrated that activation of the Raf/MEK/MAPK pathway is a specific response to virus infection and plays an important role in virus replication (Cai et al., 2007; Jacque et al., 1998; King et al., 1986; Ludwig et al., 2003; Luo et al., 2002; Panteva et al., 2003; Pleschka et al., 2001; Smith et al., 2000) . For example, specific inhibitors for both MEK1 and MEK2 such as U0126 and PD98059 have been shown to severely impair the growth of a variety of viruses in cultured cell models (Cai et al., 2007; Jacque et al., 1998; Ludwig et al., 2003; Planz et al., 2001; Pleschka et al., 2001; Smith et al., 2000) . However the specific contributions of MEK1 and MEK2 to virus replication have to our knowledge not been addressed to date. In the present study, RNAi technology has been used to specifically silence MEK1 and MEK2 expression in HEK 293 cells and the effect(s) on the subsequent replication of HSV-2 has been assessed.",

To assess the contribution of ERK activation to HSV-2 replication, U0126 was added to the culture medium prior to infection. As shown in Fig. 1B , HSV-2 propagation increased progressively, which was significantly diminished by treatment with U0126. The inhibitory effect of U0126 lasted to 72 h.

Furthermore, in mock-infected cells, reduced expression of MEK1 did not significantly alter ERK phosphorylation at a basal level ( Fig. 3A and E) , whereas reduced expression of MEK2 led to about 50 or 60% inhibition of ERK1/2 phosphorylation, compared with those of respective mock transfection group (Fig. 3C and E) . Moreover, in virus-infected cells, ERK activations were diminished to some degrees by siRNAs for two respective MEKs, as compared with their cognate mutated siRNAs (siMut1+2) (Fig. 3B , D and E, *P < 0.01 by ANOVA). In addition, identical results on ERK inhibition were obtained with alternative siRNAs designed on different sequence segments (data not shown). Hence, our data point to distinct functions for MEK1 and MEK2 in ERK activation in mock-and virus-infected cells.",

As Fig. 4A shown, in the cells transfected with 30 nM siMEK1, HSV-2 titers were markedly inhibited by about 100-fold, as compared to siMut1+2 treated cells (*P < 0.01 by ANOVA), but no significant difference with the cells treated by U0126 or siMEK1+2 (P > 0.05 by ANOVA). In contrast, transfection with siMEK2 did not display a significant effect. Consistently, MEK1 knockdown resulted in a clear reduction of HSV-2 UL30 and gB protein expression (Fig. 4B) , while MEK2 knockdown showed no change in HSV-2 UL30 and gB protein levels (Fig. 4C ). Similar results were obtained with alternative siRNAs (data not shown).

In this experiment, mock infection, HSV-2 infection, siMut1+2 transfection and U0126 were used as controls. At 24 h p.i., the cells transfected with 30 nM siMEK1, 20 and 30 nM siMEK1+2 or U0126 were manifested much less CPE, as compared to HSV-2 and siMut1+2 controls. Of note, the cells pretreated with siMEK2 showed an obvious sign of CPE. Similarly, the same result of CPE was shown using alternative siRNAs (data not shown). These results indicate that MEK1 is required for HSV-2-induced CPE. (Jacque et al., 1998; King et al., 1986; Ludwig et al., 2003; Luo et al., 2002; Panteva et al., 2003; Planz et al., 2001; Pleschka et al., 2001; Smith et al., 2000) , and in the case of HSV-2 has been seen in both neuronal and non-neuronal cells (Hunter et al., 1995; Perkins et al., 2002; Smith et al., 2000) . These studies have usually made use of two chemical inhibitors of MEK1/2, U0126 and PD98059, to block the activation of ERK cascade (Kelemen et al., 2002; Planz et al., 2001; Pleschka et al., 2001; Sturgill, 2008) . However these inhibitors have some limitations; for example, they may produce off-target effects and importantly are unable to distinguish if the effect is mediated by MEK1 or MEK2. To circumvent these limitations and allow distinction of its individual involvement in virus replication, this study made use of RNA interference to knock down expression of the individual MEK isoforms. Thus, we have demonstrated that expression of viral proteins (viral DNA polymerase, UL30 and envelope glycoprotein, gB), the yield of infectious virus and HSV-2-induced CPE are markedly decreased when ERK activation is blocked by pretreatment of cells with either of MEK siRNAs or U0126 (Figs. 1A, 2B and C, 4A, and 5) . This is consistent with previous findings using chemical MEK1/2 inhibitors (Perkins et al., 2002; Smith et al., 2000) . Furthermore, our results have shown that MEK1-medicated activation of ERK plays an essential role in viral production, whereas MEK2 is dispensable although the latter also contributes to the virus-induced ERK activation (Figs. 4 and 5) . To our knowledge, this is the first report that MEK1 activity rather than its isoform MEK2 is important for HSV-2 replication. This finding not only adds new information to our understanding of how the host cell ERK signaling pathway is utilized by virus, but also provides new evidence for isoform-specific function of MEK in the virus propagation.",

(Smith et al., 2000 (Smith et al., , 2002 has reported that HSV-2 infection induces expression of ICP10 PK, the large subunit of the HSV-2 ribonucleotide reductase 1(RR1), which has an intrinsic protein kinase activity. This in turn was found to lead to an increase in Ras-GTP and subsequent activation of Raf1, which lies immediately upstream of MEK1/2 in the ERK signaling cascade. However these studies provided no clues as to why MEK1 but not MEK2 is required for the virus production, despite both being activated by the virus infection. It is possible that a MEK1/ERK complex may associate with either component necessary for virus replication. Of relevance to such possibilities are earlier studies that have shown that Raf1 forms a signaling complex with MEK1, but not MEK2 (Jelinek et al., 1994) , and that MEK and ERK form a complex together with a scaffold protein that apparently has a preference for MEK1 (Morrison and Davis, 2003; Schaeffer et al., 1998) . Clearly future studies will be required to unravel the detailed molecular events linking the activation of the ERK signaling cascade and MEK1s involvement in it with effects on the growth of HSV-2 in virus-infected cells.",

            "text": "In conclusion, this study is the first to identify the key role played by MEK 1 in the activation of the ERK signaling cascade required to maximize HSV-2 replication in viral infected cells. This finding raises the possibility that the identification of specific small molecule inhibitors of the MEK1 kinase will lead to the development of a new class of antivirals with which to combat HSV-2-induced disease. Clearly further studies will be needed to fully characterize the benefits and limitations of blocking MEK1 based activation of the ERK pathway for HSV-2-induced disease. Dependency of virus production on ERK activation. (A) HEK 293 cells were pre-incubated without or with U0126 (50 \u03bcM) for 1 h, followed by infection with HSV-2 at an MOI of 1.5. The cells and medium were collected separately at different time points. Cell lysates were blotted with phospho-ERK1/2 (pERK1/2) antibody and \u03b2-actin antibody. (B) Virus titers in the medium were measured by plaque assay. Data shown were the means \u00b1 standard deviations (n = 3). The titers on y-axis represented logarithmic values. The values obtained with U0126 were significantly different from those in its absence indicated by the asterisk (*P < 0.01 by ANOVA). ) and (E) HEK293 cells were transfected with specific siRNAs (wt) or its mutated version (mu) as indicated and blotted with anti-MEK2 or anti-MEK1 antibody indicated. The results show specific knockdown and no cross-silencing effect and represent one of a triplicate experiment. \u03b2-Actin served as a loading control. The transfection efficiency in current study was more than 85%, as evaluated by transfection of GFP and its siRNAs (data not shown). The experiment was performed as in panel A and B except that siMEK2 or siMut2 was used to examine the effect of MEK2 on ERK activation (n = 3). \u03b2-Actin was used for the loading control. (E) Quantification of pERK1/2 bands (4 h p.i.) relative to ERK1/2 bands in panels A and B of Fig. 2 , panels A-D of the figure was determined by densitometric scanning. The relative intensity of pERK1/2 on y-axis was presented by percentage of intensity of mock transfection (100%). The data were the average of three independent experiments, and error bars denoted the standard deviations. *P < 0.01 versus 30 nM siMut1+2 by ANOVA. Knockdown of MEK1 and MEK2 differentially impacts on HSV-2 replication. Cells were transiently transfected with the siMEK1+2, siMEK1 and siMEK2 at the dose indicated, respectively. The cells transfected with siMut1+2, or siMut1, or siMut2 served as negative controls and those treated with U0126 1 h before and throughout the entire period as a positive control. The cells were infected with HSV-2 (MOI = 1.5) at 44 h post-transfection, and culture supernatant and cells collected at 24 h p.i. (A) Supernatants were assayed for viral titers (PFU/ml). The data represent the average of three independent experiments and shown as the means \u00b1 standard deviations (n = 3). P < 0.01 compared with 30 nM siMut1+2 by ANOVA. (B) and (C) Protein lysates from siMEK1 (B) or siMEK2 (C) transfected cells were blotted with anti-HSV UL30 and gB monoclonal antibodies to detect viral protein expression. The data are one representative of three independent experiments. CPE induced by HSV-2 in HEK 293 cells. Cells were transfected with siMEK1, or siMEK2 or their combination at the indicated doses, and infected at 44 h post-transfection with 1.5 MOI of HSV-2. The effects of MEK siRNA on CPE were examined from 8 h p.i., and images were taken at 24 h p.i., as opposed to the cells with mock infection, HSV-2 infection, U0126 control and siMut1+2 control. The siRNA target sequences (sense strand) in this study. ",
