            "text": "The aim of this study was to examine the influence of dietary flaxseed on the endocrine and ovarian functions of weanling gilts challenged with E. coli and Coronavirus infections treated with dietary probiotic cheeses and to understand the possible mechanisms of its effects on ovarian function. Probiotics were used as a natural substitution for antibiotics and 10% dietary flaxseed is an effective prebiotic which supports the action of probiotics and has other beneficial effects on the organism. Probiotics with or without flaxseed were fed to weanling gilts starting 10 days before and lasting up until 14 days after weaning. The ovaries were measured and histologically analysed. The blood samples for the levels of steroid hormones and insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) were assessed using immunoassays and the levels of fatty acids were assessed using gas chromatography. All samples were collected on the day of weaning and 14 days after weaning. On the day of weaning, increased levels of linoleic acid and IGF-I was associated with higher body weight. The steroid hormones were not affected by the diet. The conversion of alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) to timodonic (EPA) and cervonic (DHA) acids were lower compared to controls, and together with high levels of myristic, palmitic and palmitoleic acids was associated with the higher proliferation and lower apoptosis in the primordial, primary and secondary follicles; although the inhibition of the cell cycle was observed in relation to the low level of eicosadienoic acid. The high levels of ALA, EPA and DHA and the low levels of myristic, palmitic and palmitoleic acids may have been the effect of flaxseed feeding 14 days post-weaning and may have had a reverse effect on the proliferation and apoptosis of ovarian follicles. These data suggest that flaxseed may suppress the follicle development in weanlings via the stimulation of apoptosis and the inhibition of proliferation via the modulation of the metabolism of selected fatty acids.",

Currently, natural substitutes of antibiotics, such as probiotics are preferred to be used for: the elimination of pathogenic/potentially pathogenic microorganisms in the gut (Nemcov\u00e1 et al., 2012; Borovsk\u00e1 et al., 2013) ; the recovery of intestinal microflora, immunostimulation (Chytilov\u00e1 et al., 2013; Kuba\u0161ov\u00e1 and Mudro\u0148ov\u00e1, 2014) ; and the promotion of overall human and animal health without negative side effects. The effect of probiotics, for improved effectiveness, may be potentiated by special natural substrates used as prebiotics (Nemcov\u00e1 et al., 2010) . Suitable prebiotic substrates are, for example polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) which are richly represented in flaxseed (Rodriguez-Leyva et al., 2010; Nemcov\u00e1 et al., 2012; Andrej\u010d\u00e1kov\u00e1 et al., 2016; Sopkov\u00e1 et al., 2017) . Polyunsaturated fatty acids, such as linoleic (LA, C18:2 n-6) and \u03b1-linolenic (ALA, C18:3 n-3) acids are essential for humans and other animals. Since they are unable to be synthesised in these organisms, essential PUFAs have to be ingested from plants, fish oil, or algae (Tvrzick\u00e1 et al., 2009; Grofov\u00e1, 2010; \u017d\u00e1k et al., 2011) . Flaxseed is the richest plant source of n-3 PUFA ALA which, together with its derivativeseicosapentaenoic (EPA, C20:5 n-3) and docosahexaenoic (DHA, C22:6 n-3) acids are unique for their mostly pronounced cardioprotective (Rodriguez-Leyva et al., 2010) , hypocholesterolemic (Sopkov\u00e1 et al., 2017) , hepatoprotective (Andrej\u010d\u00e1kov\u00e1 et al., 2016) , anti-inflammatory (Liu et al., 2003) and neuroprotective (Contreras, 2012 ) effects on the organisms. They act via improved production of prostaglandins (PG) of series 3 suppressing the inflammation process (Rahbar et al., 2014) . The positive effects of n-3 PUFAs have been substantiated by many researchers on the growth and adherence of lactobacilli in the gut (Nemcov\u00e1 et al., 2012; Borovsk\u00e1 et al., 2013; Yu et al., 2014) .",

The hulls of flax seed are a rich source of lignan precursors (the most secoisolariciresinol diglycoside, SDG; Tourre and Xueming, 2010; Singh et al., 2011) , which are converted by the gut bacteria into enterodiol and enterolacton having a similar chemical structure as an oestradiol-17\u03b2, thus acting like phytoestrogens. Phytoestrogens can: bind to oestradiol receptors and act as an agonists or antagonists (Saggar et al., 2010; Michel et al., 2013) , activate the insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) receptors (Bourque et al., 2012) , modulate cell cycle and apoptosis influencing the reproduction (K\u00e1dasi et al., 2015) , and promote the health of humans (Ming et al., 2013; Yanagihara et al., 2014) . Owing to their pro-apoptotic and anti-proliferative properties (Rietjens et al., 2013; K\u00e1dasi et al., 2015) , lignans of flaxseed have been studied as potentially useful agents in the hormone replacement therapy for decreasing menopausal symptoms (Hajirahimkhan et al., 2013) and for the treatment of breast, endometrial and ovarian cancer in women (Riediger et al., 2009 ). Moreover, flaxseed may directly modulate the release of progesterone and testosterone by prepubertal porcine ovarian granulosa cells (K\u00e1dasi et al., 2015) .",

These findings showed the presence of enterotoxigenic E. coli and Coronavirus. We decided to use probiotics instead of antibiotics due to the reduced negative side effects of probiotics. Pigs were treated with probiotics 10 days before weaning (suckling period) and it lasted up until 14 days post-weaning to ensure their gut health. During the 14-day post-weaning period, all piglets were fed diets mixed for the early weaning of piglets (O\u0160-02; Spi\u0161sk\u00e9 Vlachy, Slovak Republic; Table 1 ) and had ad libitum access to water. The piglets were fed in groups of 6 and the daily feed intake of the standard feed (O\u0160-02) was 300 g per piglet per day divided into 2 doses (150 g at 8:00 a.m. and 150 g at 3:00 p.m.).

Following the incubation, the specimens were rinsed in TBST and then in TBS. A colour reaction was conducted with diaminobenzidine as a chromogen (Dako REAL\u2122 DAB + Chromogen, Dako, Denmark). The stained sections were rinsed with distilled water, counterstained with haematoxylin for stereological assessment, dehydrated and immersed in DPX (Distyrene Plasticiser and Xylene; Buchs, Switzerland). To prepare a negative control for each sample, the primary antibody was omitted. Photographic documentation was obtained using an optical microscope (Olympus BX43, Olympus Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) coupled to a camera (Olympus UC30, Olympus Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) and computer.",

The outlines of all cells which demonstrated an immunopositive signal in the ovaries were marked manually and then the grey level (GL) of the marked areas were measured. The intensity of the IHC reaction was expressed as the relative optical density (ROD) of the diaminobenzidine brown reaction products and was calculated using the formula described by Smolen (1990) , where GL is the grey level of the stained area (specimen) and unstained area (background) and blank is the GL measured after the slide was removed from the light path. The diaminobenzidine brown reaction was a sign of a positive reaction in all evaluated parameters and in the comparison with the \"negative\" control reaction. Specific immunostaining was determined by the comparison with the control reaction (incorporated photos in Fig. 1 ). All slides were counterstained with hematoxylin to visualise different structures. Histological cuts revealed the presence of PFs, PRFs and SFs. The marker PCNA was concentrated in the nucleus of an oocyte and in the layer of the follicular cells. Therefore, the results of ROD were evaluated separately in the oocytes and follicular cells of all follicle types. The intensity of the colour reaction of the cyclin B1 was largely concentrated in the layer of the follicular cells.",

Most authors dealing with the effects of flaxseed on the reproduction system suggest that the anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic effects of flaxseed are the effects of its lignan phytoestrogens acting predominantly via the oestrogen receptors beta (Rietjens et al., 2013; Sirotkin and harrath, 2014; K\u00e1dasi et al., 2015) . However, the preferential conversion of n-3 PUFAs instead of n-6 PUFAs (B\u00f6ttner et al., 2013) could have the same effect or they could relate to one another, although further elucidation of this action mechanism is needed. Whether the effects are the result of phytoestrogens was not studied in this experiment, although it should not be omitted. Our observations are the first demonstration, to our knowledge, that indicate that the feeding of flaxseed have such a positive correlation with the reproductive system of weanling gilts, as shown by ovarian cell apoptosis and proliferation, the metabolism of the fatty acids, as well as the response of the ovaries to such changes regarding the folliculogenesis. Furthermore, our findings suggest that dietary flaxseed supplementation can modify the cell cycle and apoptosis of ovarian cells via the action of highly unsaturated FAs (HUFAs) and SFAs after weaning and that this effect of dietary flaxseed can be inhibited during the suckling period of piglets.",

Our observations are not in agreement with some studies (Woodside et al., 2006; Chen et al., 2011) that suggested that the flaxseed added to the diet may lower the circulating levels of IGF-I or may not modulate the basal weight of weanlings and that the levels of circulating IGF-I are affected only by the growth phase (Li et al., 2014) . However, our findings are supported by the observations of Dirandeh et al. (2016) who reported that flaxseed or diets rich in n-3 PUFAs fed to postpartum cows, altered the hepatic expression of genes related to somatotropic axis function resulting in an increased levels of IGF-I in the blood. Morphometric analysis found that flaxseed supplemented milk diet (10-day flaxseed supplementation of mother\u00b4s milk) resulted in larger primary and secondary follicles in piglets\u00b4ovaries, but did not affect significantly the size of the primordial follicles and their oocytes. Less primordial follicles were activated to primary follicles after the flaxseed was applied to piglets during this period. Fourteen days after weaning (flaxseed supplemented standard starting diet), less primordial follicles were activated to primary follicles, which were larger. Even though, the size and number of secondary follicles were not affected by the diet although the weight and volume of ovaries were larger. This is the first demonstration, to our knowledge, that flaxseed supplemented standard starting diet (long-term dietary supplementation) by crushed flaxseed delayed the activation of primordial follicles to primary stage in the weanling gilt\u00b4s ovaries.",

            "text": "The results of the immunohistochemistry indicated that low n-3 PUFAs conversion in sucklings (flaxseed supplemented milk diet) could promote the accumulation of the proliferation marker PCNA, promoter of the G1/S phase of the cell cycle (Ulrich and Takahashi, 2013) , in follicular cells of all types of follicles and resulted in larger diameters of those follicles. The flaxseed supplemented standard starting diet (long-term supplementation) revealed the suppressive effect of flaxseed on all types of follicles. This suppression could be due to the increased activation of apoptosis (accumulation of bax and caspase 3) and weaker proliferation (accumulation of PCNA) in the follicular cells, thus less follicles were recruited for other stages of development. The intensity of proapoptotic or anti-proliferative effect of flaxseed seems to depend on the length of flaxseed feeding or other dietary conditions (e.g. mother\u00b4s milk). Our findings of the pro-apoptotic and anti-proliferative effects of flaxseed are in line with the in vitro studies on porcine ovarian healthy (K\u00e1dasi et al., 2015) and rat colon cancer cells (Hern\u00e1ndez-Salazar et al., 2013) , as well as with studies performed in women with reproductive cancers who ate flaxseed (Riediger et al., 2009; Mcllwain et al., 2013) ; therefore flaxseed potentially inhibits ovarian follicle growth and development. In addition, there was significant inhibition of the proliferation marker cyclin B1, the promoter of G2/M phase of the cell cycle (Miyazaki and Arai, 2007) during the overall supplemental period. We also found the decrease in the level of eicosadienoic acid throughout the supplemental period and therefore we suggest, and this is the first report, that the inhibition of elongation of LA to eicosadienoic acid may block the G2/M phase of the cell cycle related to the low level of cyclin B1, but the mechanism is unknown. However, Xiong et al. (2015) found that enterolactone (a lignan metabolite) has an inhibitory effect on the expression of cyclin B1 in breast cancer cells, thus confirming the anti-proliferative effect of the flaxseed. The relations between eicosadienoic acid, cyclin B1 expression and phytoestrogens, as well as the possible mechanism of action should be studied further. Whether the block or activation of apoptosis could be due to the IGF-I action is debatable. IGF-I may mediate cellular survival by acting upstream of the caspase activation and may suppress or delay the initiation of the apoptotic process mainly via the type-I IGF receptor (Willis et al., 1998; Butt et al., 1999) . In our study, the serum IGF-I level was increased regardless of the increase or decrease in DHA.",

However the level of ALA (from flaxseed) was normal and its conversion to EPA and DHA was decreased on D10 (day of weaning). We suggest that the observed suppression of n-6 PUFAs metabolism and accumulation of LA in the blood at weaning and 14 days postweaning did not depend on the source of fatty acids (milk or flaxseed) and related to the increase in IGF-I levels in the blood resulting in higher body weight. Moreover, \u0394-6-desaturase, the enzyme common for the catalysis of both n-6 and n-3 PUFAs (Stoffel et al., 2008) was decreased as well. The low activity of \u0394-6-desaturase in control sucklings could be due to its weak synthesis or activity as it was found in new-borns and children less than 6 month of age (Grofov\u00e1, 2010) , but may be affected positively by the dietary flaxseed when high intake of n-3 ALA competes for this enzyme with n-6 LA in favor of n-3 PUFAs metabolism thus resulting in higher levels of DHA in the blood (Stoffel et al., 2008; Perini et al., 2011) . The gas chromatography also revealed an increase in the levels of some SFAs, mostly myristic and palmitic acids and MUFA (palmitoleic acid) on D10 (day of weaning), although these were decreased on D24 (14 days after weaning). The low levels of DHA together with the high levels of myristic, palmitic and palmitoleic acids could promote proliferation and suppress of the apoptotis of follicular cells. However, the opposite changes in levels of those FAs had the reverse effects, which subsequently blocked the cell cycle and activated the bax-caspase 3 pathway of cell apoptosis (Butt et al., 1999) . This is the first report of the level of those SFAs, MUFA and HUFA in the blood, which could affect the proliferation, and apoptosis of follicular cells in primordial, primary and secondary follicles on the ovaries of prepubertal gilts. The possible actions of the flax seed on the folliculogenesis are shown in Fig. 3 . The possible mechanisms of action of selected fatty acids on the cell cycle and apoptosis and functional interrelationships between those fatty acids and phytoestrogens from flaxseed require further studies. It is possible that the action of the flaxseed on reproduction depends on the age of the females and the natural steroid production as observed in vitro on porcine ovaries of prepubertal 100-day old gilts (K\u00e1dasi et al., 2015) or in menopausal women (Hajirahimkhan et al., 2013) , the length of flaxseed supplementation and other dietary conditions (e.g. mother\u00b4s milk), but not on IGF-I plasma level.",

It was demonstrated that the flaxseed supplemented standard starting diet (long-term supplementation period) with high intake of ALA from the flaxseed lowered the n-6/n-3 PUFAs ratio and promoted the \u0394-6-desaturase activity for the metabolic pathway of n-3 PUFAs rather than for n-6 PUFAs, thus increasing the serum levels of DHA which together with low levels of selected SFA (myristic and palmitic acids) and MUFA (palmitoleic acid) activated apoptosis and suppressed the proliferation of all ovarian follicles. The inhibition of the elongation of LA to eicosadiaenoic acid decreased the cyclin B1 intensity in follicles, thus blocking the follicular cells in the G2/M phase of the cell cycle regardless of the type of PUFAs intake (n-6 or n-3). All these effects resulted in the suppression of follicular development on the ovaries of problematic weanling gilts. Flaxseed supplemented milk diet (short-term flaxseed feeding period) had the reverse effects, except for cyclin B1. Moreover, the accumulation of LA have probably positive correlation to the IGF-I synthesis in the liver and related with the growth phase of piglets thus resulting in higher body weight. The potential anti-gonadal action must be taken into account when consuming the flaxseed for longer periods.",
