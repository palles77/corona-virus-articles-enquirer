Focusing on modes of security and quarantine practices, I examine how globalization and the social crises surrounding SARS and H1N1 flu operated to regulate differently certain bodies and areas. I identify three types of quarantines (mandatory, voluntary, and coerced) and conduct a transnational comparative analysis to investigate the relationships among quarantines, rhetoric, and public communication. I argue that health authorities must openly acknowledge the legitimacy of public input and actively seek public support regarding health crises. Only by collaborating with concerned communities and citizens and by providing careful guidance for public participation can health institutions ensure the efficacy of quarantine orders during emerging epidemics.",

Accordingly, this article examines the rhetorical practices surrounding transnational use of quarantines in the first two global epidemics in the twenty-first century: SARS and the H1N1 flu. Examining quarantine practices both in China and in North America provides interesting insights not only about public risk communication practices in global epicenters in both epidemics but also sheds light on how publics and media in little-affected areas responded to the imagined risks related to China and the larger Chinese community during the SARS outbreak.",

Numerous studies have found that quarantines worked effectively to contain local SARS outbreaks (Gopalakrishna et al. 2004; Tsang and Lam 2003) . In the H1N1 flu outbreak in 2009, however, the quarantine situation radically changed. Because of the lack of symptoms for people at the onset stage of H1N1 flu, temperature monitoring worked much less effectively in identifying suspected cases, which in turn greatly reduced the public health efficacy of quarantines. Despite these differences between SARS and H1N1, many Asian countries and regions still adopted temperature monitoring and quarantines at the beginning of H1N1 flu to slow down its spread through the larger community.",

Then I examine the different ways mandatory, voluntary, and coerced quarantines were used in China, the U.S., and Canada during SARS as well as the way voluntary quarantines were implemented by overseas Chinese returnees during the H1N1 outbreak. I track differing motivating tropes across the varying types of quarantines in each case. Finally, I discuss how public needs, cultural notions of individual rights and duties, nationalism, and public health practices may shape the way the public views mandatory, voluntary, or coerced quarantines as well as connections between minority groups and epidemics.

My analysis of media reports and personal narratives about coping strategies during the two epidemics identifies three types of quarantines, which are respectively mandatory, voluntary, and coerced quarantines. These three types of quarantines can \"operate at the individual or population levels,\" as suggested by Gostin et al. (2003, 3231) , and yet they differ from those identified by Gostin et al. because they shift attention from location and official strategies to motivation and grassroots tactics. These types of quarantines are characterized by different degrees of restriction of movement and isolation because of personal considerations, individual will, communal pressures, or social stigmatization.",

Mandatory quarantine often results from official or communal efforts at \"pinpointing and isolating high-risk patient groups in hospitals and institutions\" (Webster 2003 (Webster , 1290 . One instance of mandatory quarantine is the widespread use of community entry surveillance tools such as temperature monitoring and health registration forms to identify floating people returning from severely SARS affected regions such as Guangdong or Beijing. Returnees from epicenters were placed into 2-week quarantines, often in cabins or buildings outside villages where their homes were located. In other cases, people may be put under medical observation in quarantine camps, as happened to residents of Amoy Gardens in Hong Kong after a total of 329 SARS cases were reported in the residential building because of a defective sewage system (Greenfeld 2006; Hung 2003; Pomfret and Weiss 2003) .

These people may employ measures such as home confinement for a certain period of time, avoidance of all unnecessary travel outside their homes, or self-imposed restricted movement for risk reduction purposes. Three medical professionals in Singapore voluntarily quarantined themselves either after developing fever symptoms or after learning that their patients were infected with SARS (Chia, 2003) .

The epidemic disappeared in Chinese mainstream media in March and in early April while the virus travelled to Beijing and Hong Kong, where local outbreaks occurred. Zhang Wenkang, China's Minister of Health, emphasized repeatedly in early April that Beijing had only 12 imported cases and that it was safe to live and travel in the capital. His claim was challenged by a retired military physician, Jiang Yanyong, who, after personal investigation of SARS in two military hospitals in Beijing, published an open letter in Time's official website on April 8 (Jakes 2003) . On April 20, China took the unusual act of firing both Health Minister Zhang Wenkang and Mayor of Beijing Meng Xuelong for failing to respond effectively to Beijing's SARS outbreak. The total number of confirmed SARS cases in Beijing was changed from 12 to 3,039 with 402 suspect cases reported on the same day. Starting on April 21, the Chinese government issued daily updates of SARS situations and started mass mobilization to launch a \"people's war against SARS\" (President Hu). For 2 months, officials and residents fought SARS, and on June 24, Beijing was removed from WHO's list of areas with recent local transmission.",

Moreover, the hospital was forced to convert its patio into a temporary medical observation center, which later became its \"hotspot of infection\" (\"Resolving Mysteries\") . Because of the lack of prevention guidelines and the heavy workload, a total of 93 medical workers and hospital staff contracted SARS during this period.

Migrant workers often worked in labor-intensive industries, lived in overcrowded dormitories, and had little access to healthcare. Often living from check to check, they could not afford medical bills incurred by major diseases. Getting fired for illness only further exacerbated their economic difficulty and threatened their daily survival. Therefore, migrant workers suffering from major illnesses often had to travel back home for low-cost family care (Tang 2003) . To ensure the timely quarantine and treatment of farmers and migrant workers, China set aside a special fund of 2 billion yuan to provide free examinations, quarantines, and treatments to farmers who contracted SARS (\"May 15\") . In addition, businesses were required to pay salaries to migrant workers who were quarantined or treated for SARS instead of firing them, thereby preventing mass exodus of migrant workers from SARS-affected areas. Official policies like these protected the economic interests of migrant workers affected by SARS or by quarantine orders, which in turn helped to humanize the anti-SARS policies and thus encouraged cooperation from affected citizens.",

The WHO workers spoke highly of the grassroots surveillance networks in the rural areas there. Epidemic control stations at the county and village levels took measures to disinfect all households on a daily basis and supervised the mobile population by keeping records of their body temperature and by providing physical checkups. WHO experts observed the use of \"very rigorous strategies\" and heightened \"community involvement\" in SARS prevention (\"WHO Experts Inspect\") . Creative measures were taken to build a net for SARS prevention and control, which made it \"hard [for SARS] to get through since the net seem[ed] to be very tight\" (\"WHO Experts Inspect\") . For instance, one village adopted a \"ten-household\" supervision mechanism with one information collector designated for every ten households to gather \"SARS-related information among the families,\" including the names of recent returnees from affected areas and the health conditions of those under home quarantine (\"WHO Experts Inspect\"). With a total of 1,000 people, the quarantined village reported three suspected SARS cases in early May and enacted a 15-day quarantine. During the quarantine, people refrained from visiting neighbors, and the county government took care of \"all the villagers' daily necessities free of charge.\" WHO officials stressed the personal responsibility of the community, which made the system work and commended \"medical staff, officials and villagers for their collaboration and dedication\" (\"WHO Experts Visit\").",

Officials issued orders to cancel all visiting and reception activities, and all travelers using public transport were required to fill in health registration forms to track their health conditions. People from Beijing were often met with suspicion and isolation efforts. In coastal cities in Zejiang, travelers from Beijing would be \"quarantined in small islands upon arrival,\" and in provinces adjacent to Beijing, most restaurants refused to provide service to such travelers in fear of possible infection (Bao 2003, \"SARS Journal\") . This public campaign functioned to put all travelers and returnees from epicenters into mandatory quarantines and helped to prevent widespread SARS outbreaks in the countryside and regions little affected by SARS. Indeed, the fully mobilized grassroots forces functioned as the frontline defense to prevent dissemination of the SARS virus in the countryside. It should be emphasized that in cities and villages little affected by SARS, the trope of social responsibility worked alongside concerns for communal and individual health, which in turn resulted in creative, locally-invented prevention tactics to prevent possible \"invasion\" of SARS.",

It became the first university to cancel classes and to dismiss students to avoid cross-infection of SARS. Rumors about the closure of all dormitories drove many students home.

Meanwhile, North Jiaotong University (NJU), located across the street from CUFE, reported clusters of outbreaks in various floors of its dormitories. By April 25, North Jiaotong had a total of 65 students suffering from fever. NJU cancelled classes until May 21 and allowed those students with no fever symptoms and no history of contact with SARS cases to return home. All students had to apply for permission to leave campus and had to leave their contact information before departure. Over 600 students, both close contacts with suspected cases and those living in the same dormitory buildings, were put into quarantines for 14 days (\"Wang Qishan\") . Fortunately, no new SARS cases were found at NJU after April 24. Ungar (1998) identifies both talk radio and the Internet as two alternative media for voicing public concerns and recommends the search of both to \"locate a signature of public concern\" in global risks (280). With a large number of students leaving campus and with the quick spread of SARS throughout China, students who traveled home were criticized as being \"cowardly, irresponsible, and virus carriers that brought the SARS virus to all parts of China\" (Lou 2003) . However, college students quickly responded to both critiques and official calls, using the Internet as a deliberative forum. In bulletin board systems (BBS) run by universities in Beijing, the most discussed topic was whether college students should leave their universities for home, which provide traces of \"personal worries and agitated conversations\" during SARS (Ungar 1998, 278) . The author of the widely circulated article about the CUFE outbreak praised CUFE's transparent and timely risk communication practices, warned against rumorinduced panic, and urged those who had contact with SARS patients to \"voluntarily quarantine [them] selves for the sake of [their] friends' and families' health\" (\"We Worked Together\") .",

As Confucius preaches, a true gentleman is willing to \"sacrifice his life to preserve ren rather than to survive at the cost of compromising ren\" (15.9). The online posts urging students not to return home reflect some of the key components of ren, i.e., gravity, modesty, diligence, generosity, self restraint, and perseverance in adversity (Ding 2007, 149) . As a limited regional risk-reduction effort, this trend of online debates signifies the metamorphosis of individuals into social beings as college students who pondered their social responsibility to the larger groups of families, communities, and the nation. These debates helped students create small initiatives that facilitated official attempts to compartmentalize and control a wide variety of high-risk spaces in Beijing. Such discussions clearly demonstrate students' sense of interdependence and interconnectedness that \"interfused biological, social, and political belongings,\" which foregrounds the notion of \"responsible citizens\" as their master trope of identity (Wald 2008, 79) . These debates also suggested the importance of emotions and values in people's experiences of and responses to health risks, as Katz and Miller (1996) stress in their affective-value model of risk communication. Whereas voluntary quarantines were featured by self-initiated acts of personal sacrifice for national and communal interests, coerced quarantines often functioned as tactics to protect oneself from racial targeting and overt discrimination, as demonstrated below.",

Travelers returning from Asia encountered pressure from their colleagues and friends to quarantine themselves, as a measure to prevent secondary infection. Anxiety caused by underground and official reports about SARS outbreaks in the larger communities in Hong Kong and later in mainland China further exacerbated experiences of racial stigmatization. Because of \"family and business ties\" with Hong Kong and China, many Asian immigrants obtained information about SARS from transnational Chinese media, online news portals, and discussion forums. Being \"Web savvy and bilingual,\" those immigrants were much more aware of the SARS outbreaks in the epicenters because of \"trans-Pacific travels, calls, and emails\" (Murphy 2003, A4) . Ding (2009) describes the tremendous sense of uncertainty and fear experienced by Guangdong and Hong Kong before China started to aggressively combat SARS in late April. It is very likely that such anxiety greatly influenced the risk behaviors of Asian immigrants who read print and digital reports about the SARS situation in China. As one health official from San Francisco said, a lot of Asian immigrants were \"getting information about SARS from websites in Hong Kong, where the authorities [were] much more alarmed about the disease's spread,\" and that information was \"not under our control\" (Murphy 2003, A4) . Asian immigrant communities encountered on a daily basis two sets of highly contradictory risk definitions and prevention tips as well as news about more severe risk situations in Asia, which resulted in a \"psychology of fear\" of the \"far-off killer\" (Murphy 2003, A4) .",

Individual businesses, wrongly accused in hoax emails of having SARS-related deaths, held press conferences, offered information leaflets, and published half-page advertisements in local Asian newspapers to dispel rumors and fears of SARS (Emery 2003) . Asian American interest groups \"launched proactive measures against stigma,\" which included sending guidelines for SARS coverage to journalists and demanding official support for Chinatowns, i.e., the creation of a \"state city task force in Chinatown, citywide SARS education programs\" and tax breaks to Chinatown businesses (Fishbein 2003, 3; Westfeldt 2003) . With individual and communal participation in both risk management and stigma reduction, people of Asian descent resorted to various survival tactics and rhetorical strategies to better manage imagined health risks, social stigma, and economic impacts caused by SARS. As a sharp contrast to Asian American and Asian Canadian's use of coerced quarantines as responses to racial targeting in SARS, overseas Chinese from H1N1 epicenters implemented voluntary quarantines when travelling back to China to reduce potential health risks they might have posed to local communities and the nation.",

With overseas Chinese students consisting of a majority of returnees during the summer break from late April to mid-August every year, HFS episodes criticized the irresponsible conduct of those early cases, questioned their lack of patriotism and care for their community, as well as their \"comprehensive quality\" as students of higher education (Bing 2009 ).

First, concerned netizens launched HFS to discipline irresponsible overseas returnees from epicenters who might unknowingly spread the virus during the incubation period. As communal responses to imported health risks, such HFS incidents made use of digital platforms such as discussion forums, bulletin board services, and social networking tools to enable collaborative investigation and participatory decision making, which in turn produced a \"crowd-powered expansion of online knowledge\" (Wang et al. 2010) . To prevent the import of viruses, mainland netizens actively participated in the online discussions about possible ways to defend their nation and their communities against H1N1 flu. Some suggested that \"radical measures\" such as death sentences, criminal investigations, administrative punishment, and moral trials should be used to discipline irresponsible overseas returnees (Bing 2009 ). Others employed more rational arguments to urge the use of voluntary home quarantines or the official release of mandatory quarantines for overseas returnees from epicenters (Bing 2009 ). This online wave of risk negotiations among concerned netizens functioned as a vital part of the transcultural communication about H1N1 flu in China and quickly produced repercussions both inside and outside the country. Resorting to arguments of patriotism and collective interests, this online movement urged the imposition of mandatory quarantines or coerced quarantines for irresponsible overseas returnees. It exerted profound impacts on the way overseas Chinese students responded to the potential health risks that their summer trips back home might pose to their motherland and their communities.",

In response to mainland netizens' HFS efforts, overseas Chinese started to call for patriotism, self control, and self sacrifice to behave as responsible citizens. One open letter issued by a student studying at Columbia University argued eloquently for cancelling trips and voluntary quarantines, which produced huge repercussions in transnational Chinese media both in print and online (Ding 2013) . The early H1N1 flu cases in various provinces attracted attention not only from regional media but also from concerned netizens, which made those early cases infamous in the region. The fear of unwanted media attention also helped to produce better quarantine practices in overseas returnees. Instead of passively falling victim to coerced quarantines, many students returning to China enacted voluntary 1-week-long home quarantines to watch for flu symptoms, which greatly reduced the risk of introducing H1N1 flu to the larger community (\"About 10,000\").",

In addition, open advocacy letters were issued by top leaders, calling for understanding and cooperation from overseas returnees in \"the national campaign against H1N1 flu\" (\"Beijing Health Bureau\"). Eventually, overseas Chinese were reabsorbed into the nationalistic discourses and were urged to impose selfdiscipline and home quarantines upon arrival in China both to protect their families and communities and to behave as responsible citizens. It should be stressed that the official request for home quarantines functioned mostly as a symbolic gesture rather than a rigorously implemented order.

Mandatory quarantines in cities and villages in China relied on the tropes of social responsibility to mobilize communities, migrant workers, and all other citizens to participate in the people's war against SARS. While quarantine orders may have come from governments or local officials, local publics actively participated in the implementation and coordination processes to ensure individual compliance. For instance, communal volunteers and anti-SARS forces collaborated closely to meet the daily survival needs of those under home quarantines or medical isolation. Family members of migrant workers worked closely with local officials to dissuade their children or spouses from returning to the countryside, and for those who did return, family members monitored their daily temperature to avoid possible import of the SARS virus. While volunteers and family members worked together to defend their communities against SARS, migrant workers also shouldered their own share of social responsibility either by continuing their work in the epicenters or by observing quarantine orders in their hometowns.",
