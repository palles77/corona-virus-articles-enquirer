The term health diplomacy has been used to describe this growing interface between foreign policy and global health, and it encompasses both the concept of using health to further foreign policy objectives, as well as the idea that diplomatic tools can be helpful for attaining public health goals. The Chinese presence in Africa has grown in the last 15 years, generating increased interest in Sino-African relations. While much has been written in recent years about the Chinese presence in Africa, the growing numbers of Africans in China have attracted considerably less attention. Many are small-scale traders and might be expected to face many of the health challenges common among foreign migrants, but their health needs have been largely unrecognised. In this paper, we consider how a health diplomacy approach could be applied to African migrants in China, and the potential advantages and limitations of this strategy. We identify areas of overlap between public health, trade, and foreign policy goals that can be emphasised to generate support for improved services for African migrants in China and to engage partners from a diversity of sectors.",

Countries recognise that health programmes can achieve strategic foreign policy goals, such as improving security, promoting economic stability, and strengthening alliances (Feldbaum & Michaud, 2010) . The term health diplomacy, described by Adams et al. in 2008 , is a growing perspective that represents the exchange between foreign policy and global health (Adams, Novotny, & Leslie, 2008; Feldbaum & Michaud, 2010) . We adopt Lee and Smith's definition of health diplomacy, which encompasses both the concept of using health to further foreign policy objectives, as well as the idea that diplomatic tools can be helpful for attaining public health goals: \"policy-shaping processes through which state, non-state and other institutional actors negotiate responses to health challenges, or utilise health concepts or mechanisms in policy-shaping and negotiation strategies to achieve other political, economic or social objectives\" (Lee & Smith, 2011) . China's expanding foreign influence, including health-focused programmes abroad, provides a useful context to apply a health diplomacy framework. In 2007, China launched a multi-country malaria control initiative in sub-Saharan Africa (Freeman & Boynton, 2011) . China's recent pledge to increase health personnel training programmes in Africa (China Daily, 2011) , alongside other commitments, presents an opportunity to apply a health diplomacy approach to advance global health.",

International migrants face a variety of unique health challenges (Zimmerman, Kiss, & Hossain, 2011) , and their transnational movement is relevant to both diplomats and health care professionals. In 2010, international migrants exceeded 213 million individuals, and South-South migration accounted for more than one-third of transnational migration (United Nations, 2012) . One of the newly emerging patterns of South-South migration is the bidirectional movement between China and countries in Africa. While much has been written in recent years about the emerging Chinese presence in Africa, the growing numbers of Africans 1 in China have attracted considerably less attention. Many are engaged in trade involving small amounts of capital (Mathews & Yang, 2012) and might be expected to face many of the health challenges common among foreign migrants, but their health needs have been largely unrecognised.

At the same time, the number of individuals from across Africa migrating to China for trade and study has increased substantially, but this aspect of growing Sino-African ties has not received the same degree of attention. Although the experience and conditions of Chinese workers in Africa has important implications for Sino-African diplomacy, this paper will focus on African migrants in China. The number of Africans living in China is not known, but the size of the population has grown since the 1997 Asian financial crisis led many African traders to leave Indonesia, Thailand, and other nations for China (Li, Lyons, & Brown, 2012) . Over 100,000 Africans are estimated to reside in China's third largest city, Guangzhou, where African traders have historically concentrated (Li et al., 2012) . The socioeconomic backgrounds of African migrants span a wide range, but many are traders with limited income and resources who engage in smallscale, informal trade activities (Mathews & Yang, 2012) . The health needs of this population are not well researched, and foreign migrants are not included in population-representative health surveys in China. However, there are a number of challenges Africans in China face (Lin, 2012) , some of which are common among foreign migrant populations and others unique to this group.",

            "text": "From the perspective of Chinese clinicians, managing care for African patients is complicated by the higher burden of certain diseases in Africa compared to China. Many countries in west Africa-where a large number of African traders originate-have generalised human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) epidemics with prevalence rates between 1 and 4%, up to 40 times the prevalence in China (UNAIDS, 2012) . Traders also migrate from countries in southern Africa, such as Mozambique, Zambia, and Zimbabwe, where HIV prevalence exceeds 11% (UNAIDS, 2012). Moreover, migrants who are immunodeficient are at higher risk for tuberculosis and multidrug-resistant tuberculosis, a prevalent and growing problem in China (Chaisson & Nuermberger, 2012) . Additionally, more than 80% of the world's malaria cases occur in Africa (World Health Organization, 2011). In contrast, less than 1% of China's population lives in high malaria transmission areas (World Health Organization, 2011) . A number of other parasitic and tropical diseases rarely seen in China are more common in African countries, including schistosomiasis (World Health Organization, 2013b) and buruli ulcer (World Health Organization, 2013a). Finally, mental health services remain underdeveloped in China , and research has demonstrated that foreign migrants are at greater risk for mental health issues (Cantor-Graae & Selten, 2005) . Many African traders arrive in China on one-month travel visas or three-month business visas, and some stay past the expiration date in order to finish their business (Mathews & Yang, 2012) . The constant threat of police arrest and deportation may cause stress and anxiety among Africans without documentation (Potochnick & Perreira, 2010) . Moreover, African migrants living in China have historically experienced racial discrimination (Cheng, 2011) , which in turn is associated with poor mental and physical health in minority communities (Pascoe & Smart Richman, 2009 ), including depression and increased alcohol use.",

Potential improvements might include formal interpreters (trained in English, French, Igbo, Hausa, Swahili, and other languages spoken in Africa), cultural competency and international health training for physicians, affordable health insurance options for foreigners, and efforts to provide screening and basic health care services at community locations such as trading markets.

Implementation research on the delivery of improved services is also needed to ensure these services are responsive to community needs.

China has a long history of providing health aid in Africa, beginning in 1963 when the first Chinese medical team was deployed to Algeria (Li, 2011) . The number of Chinese medical teams in Africa grew during the 1960s and 1970s-a period when China was seeking to expand its influence in the developing world and providing support to countries that had recently gained independence from colonial powers (Huang, 2009; Li, 2011; Xu, Liu, & Guo, 2011) . China's diplomatic efforts were rewarded when in 1971, with support from many developing countries, the United Nations (UN) General Assembly voted to recognise the People's Republic of China, rather than the Republic of China (Taiwan), as the legitimate UN representative of China (Li, 2011) . The scope of Chinese involvement in Africa and China's commitments to health in the region have grown dramatically since the first Forum on China-Africa Cooperation (FOCAC) held in 2000 (Figure 2 ). In 2009, China provided an estimated US$1.4 billion in development assistance to 48 African countries, accounting for nearly half of Chinese foreign aid disbursed (Freeman & Boynton, 2011) . Compared to China's investments in infrastructure and economic development, health aid represents only a small fraction of this development assistance, but it has been employed as a tool for promotion of Sino-African relations . Although the extent of China's health aid to Africa has not been officially reported, annual health aid to Africa is estimated to exceed US$80 million, based on pledges China made at the FOCAC summit in 2006 (Freeman & Boynton, 2011 ).",

Sino-African diplomatic ties have strategic importance for China in terms of securing allies in international organisations like the United Nations and opening up trade and business opportunities. Forming political alliances with developing countries is a long-standing Chinese foreign policy strategy and has served national aims such as joining the World Trade Organisation (Huang, 2009; McGiffert, 2009 ). At a time when China has been expanding its energy and raw materials extraction in Africa-and coming under international criticism for these activities-investing in health initiatives in African countries has been part of China's strategy to build goodwill on the continent and emphasise the \"win-win\" nature of Sino-African relations (Chan et al., 2010; Freeman & Boynton, 2011) In the context of these existing health diplomacy efforts, and their acceleration in recent years, investing in improving health services for African migrants in China could form another component of China's efforts to strengthen Sino-African relations. It represents an opportunity for Chinese leaders and health care professionals to work together with African leadership in China, with the potential to deepen bilateral ties in the process. Providing culturally appropriate services for African migrants will require working in collaboration with African embassies, consulates, and community leaders, who are in the best position to understand the needs of this population and who are familiar with navigating the Chinese system.",

By identifying areas of overlap and potential synergy among health objectives, trade and economic interests, and foreign policy goals, health diplomacy explains why potential stakeholders should jointly invest in public health solutions.",

For example, in 2011, President Obama issued a memorandum-reinforced during subsequent presidential visits to foreign countries-that elevated the rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) persons to the level of a foreign policy priority (Obama, 2011; Tucker, von Zinkernagel, & Goosby, 2013) . In the memorandum, Obama directed foreign aid agencies to leverage foreign assistance to advance non-discrimination and to enhance engagement with governments, citizens, civil society, and private sector to support efforts to combat criminalisation of LGBT persons. Such efforts to address stigma, criminalisation, and discrimination are integral to improving access to antiretroviral therapy among HIVpositive gay men and other key populations (Beyrer et al., 2012) .",

Surveys undertaken in Guangzhou have found that migrants from West Africa dominate, with Nigerians comprising the largest group (Bodomo, 2010; Li et al., 2012) . In cities like Guangzhou, Nigerians, Guineans, Malians, and other groups have established community organisations to encourage mutual support among migrants originating from the same country and to represent their interests in interactions with local authorities. These organisations provide an important channel through which the Chinese government and African diplomats can engage African migrants and ensure interventions are responsive to their needs.",

First, creating multi-sectoral collaboration focused on health diplomacy may be technically difficult, but the prominence of Sino-African ties may help catalyse this process. Second, improved access to health services might encourage increased migration from Africa to China, potentially leading the government to impose further limitations on visas for citizens of African countries. Increased services for African migrants might also reveal a substantial burden of disease and trigger more restrictive immigration policies. However, as China's investments in health and other sectors in Africa demonstrate, the Chinese government has an interest in both fostering positive relationships with African leaders and promoting goodwill among the public in African countries. Moreover, improving health care access is one of the government's strategic priorities for health reform (Yip et al., 2012) . Finally, health governance is weak in China and in many African countries (Huang, 2011; Kirigia & Barry, 2008) , perhaps limiting their ability to improve services for African migrants in China. However, the Chinese government is seeking to establish more accountability and improved health outcomes in the health system with on-going national health reform (Yip et al., 2012) .",

The Chinese government has experience managing the health implications of its massive internal rural-to-urban migration (Gong et al., 2012) . Some common themes characterise both foreign and internal migrant populations, including social exclusion, economic vulnerability, limited health insurance, and mental health stresses. The momentum of growing research and policy in the area of internal migration could be applied to improving services for African migrants. Moreover, the Chinese government recently launched the first phase of a national health care reform plan aimed at achieving comprehensive universal health coverage by 2020 (Yip et al., 2012) . One central goal of China's health reform is to promote health equity, which will require improving the quality of care for foreign migrants and other populations that have been marginalised in China's health system. Applying a health diplomacy approach to African migrants in China is a potentially effective strategy, and one that is aligned both with China's economic interests and with China's trend toward assuming a greater role as a donor country and global health leader.
