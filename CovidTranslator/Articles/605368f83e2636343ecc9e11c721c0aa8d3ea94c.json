However, chemical composition and bioactivity of essential oil (EO) of C. fortumei (J.) Smith leaves remain unclear. In present study, we isolated EO from the plant by supercritical carbon dioxide extraction assay (SFE-CO 2 ), and investigated on cancer cells MGC-803, MCF-7, BGC-823, Bcap-37, A375, and A549 in vitro by MTT assay. 26 compounds were identified by GC-MS analysis, and the EO showed significant antitumor activities against MGC-803, Bcap-37, and A549 cancer cell lines (IC 50 values ranging from 0.15 to 0.24 mg/mL), and the activities of its main component were also studied. Subsequent fluorescence staining and flow cytometry analysis indicated that the EO could induce apoptosis in MGC-803, Bcap-37, and A549 cell lines, and the apoptosis ratios reached 26.44 % after 48 h of treatment at 0.15 mg/mL in MGC-803 cells. Caspase 3 activity in MGC-803 cells was also determined when the cells treated with the oil, and the activity of caspase 3 enzyme was increased compared to the control. This study suggests that the EO isolated from C. fortumei (J.) Smith could inhibit the growth of human carcinoma cells, and it could induce apoptosis of cancer cells.",

In recent years, a number of natural products isolated from Chinese herbs have been found to inhibit proliferation, induce apoptosis, suppress angiogenesis, retard metastasis, and enhance chemotherapy, exhibiting anticancer potential both in vitro and in vivo (Tan et al., 2011; Hostanska et al., 2007) . The essential oils (EOs) extracted from herbs might have more therapeutic or preventive activity than alone, because the different components in herbs may have synergistic activities or buffering toxic effects (Yu et al., 2012) . Mostly plant-derived EOs consist of chemical components such as terpenoids including monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes and their oxygenated derivatives. These compounds have the ability to easily diffuse across cell membrane to induce biological reactions (Al Nomaani et al., 2013) . Plant EOs and their components have multiple and varied biological activities such as antiparasitic, insecticidal, antimicrobial, antitumor, and antioxidant Shengjie Yang, Mingchuan Liu have contributed equally to this work.",

Smith is mainly grown in China, Korea, and Japan and has been used as a medicinal plant for a long time in the Orient (Choi, 2013; Yang et al., 2013a) . And it belongs to the Dryopteridaceae family which has 14 genera and 1700 species distributed in the temperate and tropical zones all over the world (Suksathan et al., 2010; Kessler, 2006; Barrington, 2012) . Many species of Dryopteridaceae family are rich in fatty acids, phloroglucinols, terpenoids, steroids, and flavonoids, and are well-known medicinal plants (Ito et al., 2000) . The roots of C. fortumei (J.) Smith are used as folk medicines for treatment of migraine, cancer, acute and chronic pharyngitis, and influenza in China (Kapadia et al., 1996) . Also, the herb was used to cure severe acute respiratory syndrome, a life-threatening viral respiratory illness believed to be caused by a coronavirus (Zhao et al., 2007) . It was reported that it exhibited a variety of bioactivities such as cytotoxicity (Yang et al., 2013b) , antibacterial (Song et al., 2008) , antifungal (Jahan et al., 2010) , and antioxidant (Yang et al., 2013c) effects. Recently, researchers found that extracts of its roots processed significant antitumor activities via inducing cell apoptosis (Yang et al., 2013a) . Moreover, Choi et al. reported that methanol extract of its roots appeared to inhibit tyrosinase activity and melanin production in melan-a cells and it could exhibit depigmenting ability on Ultra violet-induced hyper pigmentation in brown guinea pig skin (Choi, 2013) . In our previous work, we investigated the chemical constituents of the plant systematically, and tested the biological activities of its extracts and compounds. The results revealed that its major physiologically active ingredients included triterpenoids, flavonoids, and alkaloids (Yang et al., 2013a) . However, few studies have analyzed the chemical composition of EO of C. fortumei (J.) Smith leaves, and evaluated its biological activity.",

As shown in Table 1 , the major compounds detected in EO are 22,23-dihydro-stigmasterol (34.15 %), 5-nonadecen-1-ol (8.42 %), n-hexadecanoic acid (8.34 %), cyclotetracosane (7.41 %), oleic acid (6.51 %), campesterol (4.54 %), 9Z,12Z-octadecadienoic acid (4.41 %), stigmast-4-en-3-one (2.38 %), and diploptene (2.35 %) comprising the main portion of EO. In addition, b-amyrin, a kind of pentacyclic triterpenoids, was also identified. Steroids and organic acids were the dominant class of compounds, constituting 41.07 and 19.26 % of the total oil, respectively. Pentacyclic triterpenoids constituted 3.66 % of the total oil. The in vitro antitumor activity was evaluated for EO from C. fortumei (J.) Smith leaves against MGC-803, MCF-7, BGC-823, Bcap-37, A375, and A549 cell lines. EO was dissolved in DMSO, and then diluted with culture medium containing 0.1 % DMSO. The control cells were treated with culture medium containing 0.1 % DMSO. Adriamycin (ADM) was used as a positive control. The inhibitory ratios of ADM at 0.1 mg/mL against the six cell lines were 99.1, 98.3, 99.4, 97.6, 95.4, and 99.7 %, respectively. The IC 50 values of EO against the six cells are shown in Fig. 1 . Furthermore, EO showed dose dependent antitumor activities against the two cell lines, and summarized in Fig. 2 .",

The execution of apoptosis, or programed cell death, is associated with characteristic morphological. Thus, the antiproliferative activity of EO was further investigated by apoptosis assay to determine the mode of cell death involved. For this purpose, treated and untreated cells were subjected to acridine orange/ethidium bromide (AO/EB) double-staining, and the induction of apoptosis was further confirmed by Hoechst 33258 staining.",
