Briefly, the corneoscleral disc was first removed, followed by the lens and vitreous. The residual eye cup was sectioned with a longitudinal incision towards the optic nerve. Repeated rinsing with Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), Ca 2+ and Mg 2+ free (Biochrom, Berlin, Germany), allowed prompt separation of the remaining vitreous and neutral retina from the layer of RPEC and allowed detachment of the choroid from the sclera. The RPEC adhering to Bruch's membrane on the obtained choroidal sheets were washed with PBS and treated three times with 0.25% trypsin EDTA solution (Biochrom) for 20 min at 37 \u00b0C. The isolated cells were centrifuged at 300 g for 10 min and resuspended in RPMI 1640 (Biochrom) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Biological Industries, Kibbutz Beth Haemek, Israel). Cells were seeded in 25-cm 2 tissue culture flasks (Becton Dickinson, Plymouth, UK) for 24 h at 37 \u00b0C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO a. The next day, nonadherent cells were removed and fresh culture medium added. Confluent cells were trypsinated, washed with PBS and seeded into two tissue culture flasks.

After seeding, cells quickly came in contact with other RPEC and began to proliferate until confluence was achieved after approximately 1 week. In the first two to three passages RPE cells still contained their typical pigmented granules. After four to six passages RPEC lost their pigmented granules and the cell proliferation rate was reduced. Figure 1 shows uninfected RPEC after 3 days of culture. For viral infection, cells were transferred onto Lab-Tec chamber slides and kept under the same culture conditions for approximately 1 week until they were confluent.

Cells were observed for an appropriate time until development of cytopathic effect, depending on the virus strain used, or a maximum of 3 weeks. Three different experiments were performed using pigmented RPEC (early passage) as well as unpigmented RPEC (late passage). Different cell lines, including HeLa cells, kidney cell lines, primary fibroblasts and cord blood lymphocytes, with described susceptibility or resistance against infection with the virus strains tested, served as positive and negative controls. Productive infection was confirmed by detection of viral-induced structural and nonstructural antigens in the infected RPEC by means of immunofluorescence or immunoperoxidase staining. Cells grown on the microscopic chamber slides were air-dried and subsequently fixed with ice-cold acetone. Monoclonal antibodies (mAb) or antisera against the viruses listed above were applied, diluted in PBS supplemented with 1% bovine serum albumin. They were followed by a fluorescent anti-mouse-F(ab) 2 fraction of goat immunoglobulin (Bioresearch, Kaumberg, Austria) or fluorescent anti-human IgG of rabbit immunoglobulin (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark) and subsequently counterstained with Evans blue (Sigma, St. Louis, Mo., USA).

Adenovirus infection was detected by means of mAb Clone H60 from Clonatec. Parainfluenza virus was verified by immunofluorescence using the Imagen Parainfluenza Virus Group Kit (detects para influenza virus types 1, 2 and 3) from Dako Diagnostics (Cambs., UK). Coxsackievirus and measles virus infections were detected using high-titre positive patients' sera. Productive EBV infection was excluded by staining with anti-EBV gp350 mAb 72A1 (hybridoma obtained from ATCC, no. HB 168) and a mAb against the EBV major capsid protein (kindly donated by Dr. F. Schwarzmann, University of Regensburg, Germany). The EBV-producing cell line B95-8 was used as a positive control. HHV-6 infection was excluded by comparing immunofluorescence of the RPEC with cord blood lymphocytes freshly infected with HHV-6. Antibodies used included patients' antisera positive for HHV-6 as well as polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies raised against purified HHV-6 virions (Larcher etal., manuscript in preparation). Infection was assumed if cells stained with mAb and/or polyclonal antibodies in each parallel experiment. Lack of infection was assumed if no infected cells could be detected in all three parallel experiments although infection could be shown in the control experiments described earlier. The infectivity of the stocks of parainfluenza virus, adenovirus, measles virus and coxsackievirus used was controlled in the respective susceptible cells (i.e. HeLa cells and the primate cell line Vero). CMV laboratory strain AD169 was grown on primary fibroblast cell culture. The lymphotropic viruses (EBV strain B95-8 and HHV-6 strain GS) were tested by infecting peripheral blood lymphocytes or cord blood lymphocytes stimulated with phytohaemagglutinin and IL-2.",

Virus replication might lead directly to cytolysis, but also limited expression of viral antigens might alter ,,self\", which in further consequence could trigger immune-mediated cell destruction. Release of autoantigens from RPEC has been shown to play a role in chemically induced experimental autoimmune uveitis [20] suggesting a self-perpetuating mechanism following primary cell injury [14] . Moreover, aberrant expression of MHC class II on ciliary epithelium has been observed in uveitic eyes and experimentally induced by interferon gamma in cultured human nonpigmented ciliary epithelial cells [17] . Therefore, induction of MHC class II antigens by viral infection might contribute to mechanisms involved in the development of an autoimmune disease, as MHC class II positive cells have been proposed to play a role in the induction of autoimmune uveitis [ 10] .",
