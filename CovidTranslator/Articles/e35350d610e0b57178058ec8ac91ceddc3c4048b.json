However, there is not an ideal vaccine to provide complete protection against PRRSV. Thus, the need for new antiviral strategies to control PRRSV still remains. Surfactant protein A (SP-A) belongs to the family of C-type lectins, which can exert antiviral activities. In this present study, we assessed the antiviral properties of recombinant porcine SP-A (RpSP-A) on PRRSV infection in Marc 145 cells and revealed its antiviral mechanism using a plaque assay, real-time qPCR, western blotting analysis and an attachment and penetration assay. Our results showed that RpSP-A could inhibit the infectivity of PRRSV in Marc 145 cells and could reduce the total RNA and protein level. The attachment assay indicated that RpSP-A in the presence of Ca 2? could largely inhibit Marc 145 cell attachment; however, in the penetration assay, it was relatively inactive. Furthermore, our study suggested that virus progeny released from infected Marc145 cells were blocked by RpSP-A from infecting other cells. We conclude that RpSP-A has antiviral activity against PRRSV, most probably by blocking viral attachment and the cell-to-cell transmission pathway, and therefore, RpSP-A holds promise as a novel antiviral agent against PRRSV.",

            "text": "Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) infection is common worldwide and has become one of the most economically important diseases in the swine industry [1] . PRRSV can cause reproductive failure in sows and is associated with a respiratory disease complex that can affect pigs of all ages [2] [3] [4] . PRRSV was discovered almost simultaneously in the late 1980s on the European and North American continents and was divided into type 1 PRRSV (European genotype) and type 2 PRRSV (North American genotype) [5, 6] . PRRSV is an enveloped, single-stranded positive-sense RNA virus. Its genome is approximately 15.4 kb in size and has at least 10 open reading frames (ORFs) [7] . ORF1a and ORF1b encode non-structural proteins, and the other genes encode structural proteins, including GP2a, GP2b, GP3, GP4, GP5, GP5a, matrix protein M and the nucleocapsid protein N [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] . Of these, four are glycoproteins: the minor proteins GP2a, GP3 and GP4 and the major protein GP5, which is thought to be important for virus assembly and entry into permissive cells.",

Although many commercially available modified live and inactivated PRRSV vaccines have been developed, they fail to provide complete protection against the devastating disease caused by this virus [6, [14] [15] [16] . Furthermore, a large amount of literature has reported natural compounds that exhibit activity against PRRSV infection, including flavaspidic acid AB [17] , matrine [18] , 12-deoxyphorbol 13-phenylacetate 20-acetate (dPPA), ouabain, valinomycin and bufalin [19] , and glycyrrhizin [20] . Additionally, other therapies designed to control PRRSV infection have been reported, such as LiCl [21] , polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid [22] , type I and type III interferons [23] , double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) activated caspase oligomerizer (DRACO) [24] , and microRNAs [25] . However, none of these aforementioned therapies can effectively treat or prevent PRRSV infection, so there is an urgent need to develop new antiviral strategies.",

            "text": "Surfactant protein A (SP-A) belongs to a family of mammalian C-type lectins, and it is an important innate immune molecule that is involved in a range of immune responses. The primary structure of SP-A is composed of four regions, including an N-terminal region, a collagenlike region, a coiled-coil neck peptide, and a carbohydraterecognition domain (CRD) [26] . The CRD can interact with sugar moieties that are present on the surface of many pathogens, including viruses, fungi and bacteria, resulting in inhibition of infectivity in a calcium-dependent manner. Previous studies on the antiviral activity of SP-A have been focused on human medicine. In the late 1990s, human SP-A was shown to inhibit respiratory syncytial virus by blocking viral entry and subsequent syncytium formation [27] . Research on porcine SP-A activity against PRRSV was limited to one report indicating that recombinant porcine SP-A could exert anti-PRRSV activity [28] . Unfortunately, no additional studies on the anti-PRRSV potential and mechanism of SP-A were performed. However, studies on the antiviral activity of SP-D, which has a primary structure that resembles that of SP-A, have been reported more frequently. SP-D had an inhibitory effect on HIV infection through inhibition of viral entry by affecting gp120-CD4 interactions [29] . Marine and colleagues demonstrated that recombinant porcine SP-D prevented the attachment of human seasonal H 1 N 1 and H 3 N 2 virus to receptors on epithelial cells of the upper respiratory tract [?36?] . Notably, porcine ficolin is also a collagenous lectin that was established to reduce PRRSV infection in Marc-145 cells in neutralization assays and to inhibit the replication of infectious viral particles in a GlcNAc-dependent manner [30] .",

In China, highly pathogenic PRRSV appears to be widely prevalent, and therefore, the highly pathogenic PRRSV strain NJ-a, a type 2 PRRSV strain, was used in this study. To explore the anti-PRRSV activity of porcine SP-A, further studies need to be performed on type 1 PRRSV. Our data indicate that RpSP-A significantly suppresses PRRSV infection in a dose-dependent manner without causing cytotoxicity in Marc 145 cells. We also found that RpSP-A exerts potent antiviral activity in a Ca 2? -dependent manner, indicating that RpSP-A may interact with PRRSV via the carbohydrate-recognition domain, which is consistent with previous studies [27, 28] .",

We conducted virus attachment and penetration assays to assess whether RpSP-A also interfered with PRRSV entry. The virus entry assay showed that RpSP-A strongly inhibits virus attachment, but its effect on virus penetration was, at most, modest, suggesting that RpSP-A most probably blocks virus attachment, like other lectins. It has been shown that hippeastrum hybrid agglutinin (HHA), a mannose-specific lectin, probably interferes with SARS coronavirus attachment. When attachment occurred at 4\u00b0C, HHA was twice as active (EC 50 = 2.5 lg mL -1 ) as it was in a situation where both attachment and penetration were allowed to occur at 37\u00b0C (EC 50 = 5.2 lg mL -1 ) [34] . In another study, recombinant porcine SP-D was shown to inhibit IAV attachment using human trachea tissue, and it fully prevented binding of human seasonal H1N1 and H3N2 IA at higher dose [35] . Our data indicate that the suppression of PRRSV penetration by RpSP-A gradually weakened and even disappeared as the time between infection and addition of RpSP-A increased, suggesting that RpSP-A might act on PRRSV entry into Marc 145 cells only at the cell surface and that it has no effect once the virus has entered the cell.",

Taking the previously reported data and our own findings together, we hypothesize that RpSP-A inhibits PRRSV entry by binding to glycoprotein GP2, GP3, GP4 or GP5 on the surface of PRRSV, thereby preventing it from interacting with its receptors on Marc 145 cells. The mechanism of the antiviral activity of lectins has been studied by several researchers. It has been shown that human SP-A can bind to the F (fusion) glycoprotein on the surface of respiratory syncytial virus and may neutralize RSV by directly inhibiting the fusion function of this protein, thereby inhibiting viral entry [27] . In another study, Marine et al. reported that the interaction between RpSP-D and the viral HA prevented attachment of the virus to target cells and contributed to the neutralizing effects of RpSP-D [35] . In addition, other lectins such as SP-D and plant lectins have been shown to bind to glycoprotein gp120 of HIV-1 and block access of gp120 to the receptor protein CD4 [29, 32, 33, 36] , thereby blocking viral entry to reduce HIV-1 infection. The nature of the interactions among PRRSV, RpSP-A and cells is not yet known, so this model should be assessed in further studies.",
