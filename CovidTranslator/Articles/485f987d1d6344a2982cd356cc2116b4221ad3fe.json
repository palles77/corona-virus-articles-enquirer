Formation of TRIs has been linked to the exposure of excess interferon (IFN), either from endogenous or exogenous sources.

Case reports of patients with renal biopsies showing TRIs without underlying SLE or HIV are infrequent in adults, and to our knowledge none have been reported in children. We report 3 pediatric cases in which the renal biopsy showed TRIs on electron microscopy without underlying SLE or HIV infection.

Two months prior to our evaluation, she had been hospitalized for acute renal failure requiring dialysis while visiting India. While in hospital she had gastroenteritis and oliguric renal failure with concern for sepsis. She required hemodialysis and plasma transfusions for worsening bilateral pneumonia and ARDS that required intubation and mechanical ventilation. Lower respiratory tract cultures grew Acinetobacter baumannii, but blood cultures remained negative. She required hemodialysis for 2 weeks after which her renal function improved and the hemodialysis catheter was removed. Upon her return to the United States, she was evaluated by her primary care physician and referred to our hospital for hyperkalemia (6.6 mg/dL). The patient's laboratory findings at that time showed elevated Cr (3.4 mg/dL), hyponatremia (113 mEq/L), and increased WBC (19.8 \u00d7 10 3 /mm 3 ) but no anemia or thrombocytopenia. Family history was positive for maternal Hashimoto's thyroiditis but negative for renal disease. At the time of our evaluation, the patient's only medication was pantoprazole. Physical examination at our hospital revealed an afebrile child with a BP of 114/86 mm Hg. She appeared thin and anxious but the rest of her physical exam was unremarkable. UA revealed trace leukocytes but no hematuria or proteinuria. Her CBC showed anemia (Hgb 8.9 g/dL), increased WBC of 12.3 \u00d7 10 3 /mm 3 , normal differential count, and thrombocytosis (775 \u00d7 10 3 /mm 3 ). BUN and Cr were 58 mg/dL and 1.8 mg/dL, respectively. Electrolytes revealed hyperkalemia (6 mEq/L) and hyperphosphatemia (6.6 mg/dL). C3 and C4 were normal. ANA and anti-double-stranded DNA autoantibodies were negative. Viral serological studies were positive only for rhinovirus/enterovirus (Table  1 ). Renal ultrasound revealed that her right kidney had a duplicated collecting system. Renal biopsy was performed and LM showed 35 unremarkable glomeruli. Foci of mild tubulitis were seen. Interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy was approximately 50% with a moderate infiltrate of mononuclear leukocytes diffusely present in the interstitium (Fig. 3a) . Direct IF was negative for all immunoreactants. EM showed mild podocyte foot process effacement. Definitive electron-dense deposits were not identified, but multiple TRIs were present (Fig.  3b) . She was discharged home on antihypertensives (amlodipine and clonidine), erythropoietin, bicitra, and phosphate binders. Steroids were subsequently prescribed based on the biopsy diagnosis of acute and chronic tubulointerstitial nephritis. On her last follow-up, Cr was at 0.6 mg/dL, and she had normal electrolytes.",

Our 3 patients may have had elevated endogenous IFN triggered by an exaggerated immune response to common viral infections. Serological studies to determine IFN levels and immunohistochemical (IHC) staining to detect enhanced TLR expression in our patients may have been very informative. A finding of elevated IFN and positive TLR tissue staining would have added valuable evidence in support of our hypothesis that common viral infections as found in our patients can result in formation of TRIs.
