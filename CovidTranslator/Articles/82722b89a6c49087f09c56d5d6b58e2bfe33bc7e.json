However, since the disease is typically chronic in nature, patients often require long-term repeated treatment with either topical or systemic corticosteroids [10, 11] . In severe cases of uveitis, multiple rounds of sub-Tenon or intravitreal corticosteroid injections as well as systemic corticosteroids may be necessary. The potential for complications such as endophthalmitis, vitreous hemorrhage, and retinal detachment following use of repeated intravitreal injections is substantial [12, 13] . Systemic corticosteroids require high dosages to achieve therapeutic concentrations in the eye and are associated with systemic side effects including hypertension, hyperglycemia, and increased susceptibility to infection [14, 15] . Immunosuppressive agents can be an effective treatment option, but are associated with serious and potentially life-threatening systemic adverse events (AEs) such as renal and hepatic failure and bone marrow suppression [9, 16] . Thus, such therapy is usually reserved for patients with severe uveitis who are unresponsive to corticosteroid therapy or with corticosteroid-induced complications. ",

            "text": "Incidence of intraocular pressure increase of C10 mm Hg from baseline over the 3-year post-implantation period efficacy, although the higher-dose implant tended to have a shorter time to uveitis recurrence. This was attributed to a shorter lifespan of the 2.1-mg implant and consistent with known in vitro release rate data, suggesting that the drug reservoir is depleted more rapidly in the higher-dose implant.The main cause of visual loss in patients with posterior uveitis is CME[21,22]. The ability of the FA implant to reduce CME through control of inflammation led to good visual acuity outcomes. These improved visual acuity outcomes were observed despite the formation of cataracts in the majority of implanted patients. Cataract formation and progress are common in eyes with uveitis and attributable both to the inflammatory progress and to the chronic use of corticosteroids to control the disease.[16] In this study, nearly all (94.9%) implanted phakic eyes underwent cataract surgery during the 3-year follow-up with a high incidence of reduction in BCVA of C3 lines observed between 12 and 18 months postimplantation-the period during follow-up when most cataract surgeries were performed in implanted eyes. However, following cataract removal, implant eye visual acuity improved, with a significant improvement in mean BCVA Notably, in a follow-up post hoc analysis of post-surgical outcomes in eyes requiring cataract extraction from an earlier Phase II/III study of the FA implant in the treatment of NIPU, Sheppard et al. [23] reported better vision and less intraocular inflammation following cataract surgery in implanted eyes compared with nonimplanted eyes. These results were more remarkable, in that in the study, as well as in the current study, the FA-implanted eye represented each patient's worse eye. At 1 and 3 months post-cataract extraction, mean improvement in visual acuity was significantly greater in implanted than nonimplanted eyes (P B 0.0047) and significantly fewer AC cells were seen in implanted than nonimplanted eyes (P B 0.0084) [23]. Elevated IOP is also common in uveitic eyes due to the occlusion of aqueous outflow by inflammatory debris and/or formation of peripheral anterior synechia [24, 25]. Herbert et al. [26] reported the prevalence of elevated IOP in uveitis patients to be as high as 41.8%; with 29.8% of cases requiring treatment to manage the elevated IOP. The proportion of implanted eyes experiencing elevations in IOP in this study was higher (67.8% and 71.3% of eyes in the 0.59-and the 2.1-mg implant groups, respectively), due to the fact that corticosteroid treatment itself may also lead to reduced aqueous outflow through a variety of mechanisms [27, 28]. While the majority of implanted eyes with IOP elevations were successfully treated with IOPlowering medications, 33% of implanted eyes with IOP elevations required glaucoma-filtering procedures to control IOP. Details of the topical IOP-lowering medications and filtering procedures utilized in this study and the two previous FA implant studies have been described by Goldstein et al. [29]. Trabeculectomy was the most common surgical procedure in this and previous studies, and surgical procedures were deemed successful in 85.1% of eyes at 1 year (postoperative IOP of 6-21 mm Hg with or without additional IOP-lowering medication). As might be expected, there were more ocular AEs in implanted eyes compared with nonimplanted fellow eyes. Adverse events in nonimplanted eyes appeared to be reflective, in large part, of the underlying uveitic process (e.g., reduced visual acuity, cataract, eye pain, increased IOP, conjunctival hyperemia, vitreous floaters, blurred vision, macular edema), while AEs in implanted eyes were consistent with the surgical procedure and corticosteroid delivered (e.g., increased IOP, eye pain, conjunctival hermorrhage, postoperative wound complications, cataract formation). Notably, there were no nonocular AEs considered treatment related in either implant group. This finding is likely due to the negligible systemic exposure to FA following implantation of the FA implant. In a previous study of patients who received the intravitreal implant, and had blood samples taken at various times after implantation, plasma levels of FA were below the limit of detection [30]. The dose-controlled design of this study, along with the lack of randomization regarding the treatment eye in bilateral cases, precludes definitive distinction from regression to the mean as the explanation for the apparent treatment effects on many of the clinical findings, including visual acuity and recurrent inflammation. The biologic plausibility and magnitude of the results, however, suggest that treatment effects were the primary contributor to the results. The results of this study demonstrate the efficacy of the FA intravitreal implant in the treatment of NIPU in a population of predominantly Asian patients. The FA intravitreal implant led to both significant reductions in uveitis recurrence rates and improvements in visual acuity. Elevated IOP and cataract formation were the most common AEs, consistent with the natural history of the disease and the treatment used. Unlike previous studies, there were more complications related to implant site wound leaks. It is therefore especially important that the physician pays careful attention to wound closure in the uveitic patient treated with an FA implant. Bausch ?
