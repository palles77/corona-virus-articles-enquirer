This virus is known to cause a more severe disease and higher mortalities than those caused by the bovine rotavirus because it multiplies in both the small intestine and the large intestine whereas the rotavirus infects only the small intestine [12] . The main route of infection is the fecal-oral and the pregnant cows are believed to be important sources of virus for newborn calves. Cows have been reported to be chronic excretors of BCV; the shedding being exacerbated in late stages of gestation, probably because of hormonal changes and their effects on the immune system [1, 2].",

The calves were housed in individual rooms and were fed a milk replacer (Land-O-Lakes, Fort Dodge, Iowa) twice daily.

At 5 days of age, the calves were inoculated orally with different doses of virulent (pneumoenteric isolate) or attenuated strain (Mebus strain) of BCV (Table 1) . During the course of the study, a control uninfected calf became naturally infected with BCV at 4 days of age and was included in the study. The attenuated BCV (Mebus strain) was obtained from the National Veterinary Services Laboratory, Ames, Iowa where it had undergone 38 passages in PK 15 (pig kidney) cells. An additional 3 passages in human lung carcinoma (A 549) cells were given in our laboratory. The virulent isolate of BCV was obtained from a fecal sample submitted to the Minnesota Veterinary Diagnostic A 20% suspension of the sample was prepared in Hank's balanced salt solution (HBSS), clarified by centrifugation at 2500 x g for 20 min and passed through a 0.45 gm filter. No bacteria were isolated when the filterate was inoculated on blood agar plates. On examination by negative contrast electron microscopy (NCEM), the sample was found to contain coronavirus only.

Since BCV infects both the small and the large intestines a method was needed for sampling from both regions of the intestines of these calves at various time intervals. The Thiry Vella loops can not be made with spiral colon while small intestine is not accessible by retrograde endoscopy. Also, it was necessary to collect full thickness biopsies to study the involvement of Peyer's patches in virus infection. Laparotomies at various intervals after infection allowed the collection of full thickness samples from all sites. Attempt was made to cover every weekly interval after infection among a group. The details of the laparotomy procedure are given elsewhere [6] . Briefly, the calves were sedated with xylazine hydrochloride (Rompun) at the rate of 0.02-0.05 mg/kg intravenously and 0.04-0.1 mg/kg intramuscularly and restrained in left lateral recumbency. The right flank was clipped and paralumber fossa prepared for surgery by scrubbing alternately with Betadyne and 70% alcohol. A regional block was done with 20-30 ml 2% Lidocaine in inverted L pattern. A 15-20 cm vertical incision was made in mid-flank. The muscle layers were separated in grid pattern and peritoneum sharply incised. Intestinal biopsies, 4-5 x 2-3 mm in size, were placed in normal saline and were transported on wet ice to the laboratory. The incision was closed in routine manner. The DFA was done on frozen sections of gut biopsies from all calves from spiral colon, ileum, and jejunum. The sections (6 gin) were placed on slides, air dried, washed with PBS (pH 7.2) for 5 rain, fixed in acetone for 10 rain, covered with FITC-labelled anti-BCV antibody (gnotobiotic calf origin) and incubated at room temperature for an hour. After counterstaining with Evan's blue, the sections were examined with fluorescent microscope. Samples showing finely granular cytoplasmic, apple green fluorescence were considered positive.",

Calves inoculated with the virulent virus, developed interstitial pneumonia, upper respiratory tract infection and diarrhea [5] and excreted BCV at HA titers of 512-8192 for 2-3 days followed by a drop in titers to 2-8 (Fig. 2) .

For diagnostic purposes the intestinal content and a piece of spiral colon are usually submitted for NCEM and DFA, respectively. Since the virus may not be present in spiral colon at all times, it may be easy to miss. This may explain the failure of correlation of EM results and DFA as reported before [10] . In the acute stage, both virulent and attenuated strains of BCV infected the superficial enterocytes in the intestine. However, the attenuated strain was seen to persist in Peyer's patches (calf #9) while the virulent strain persisted in the crypts (calf #2) for up to 3 weeks. Although BCV is sensitive to environmental conditions, coronaviral scours may occur in a herd year after year, especially in winter. Under current management conditions, calves are usually separated from dams immediately after birth and reared separately from adult cows. Therefore, the virus must persist somewhere in the calf pens or environment. Although cows are considered to be the source of BCV for calves, the excretion of low titers of BCV in calves indicates that these calves may be another possible source of the virus for other calves. The intermittent demonstration of the viral antigen in the gut of the calves seems to substantiate this hypothesis.",
