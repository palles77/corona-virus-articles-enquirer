A whole-transcriptome amplification system (WTA; Sigma-Aldrich, Saint Louis, MO, USA) was used to amplify double-stranded viral cDNA as described previously (3). 3. Construction of second cDNA library. After the first cDNA library purification with the MonoFas DNA isolation system (GL Sciences, Tokyo, Japan), DNA was Page 1 of 4 digested with 20 U of HpyCH4IV (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA, USA) and Sau3AI (New England Biolabs) at 37\u00b0C for 60 min, and the digested DNA was again purified by using MonoFas. For construction of the second cDNA library, aliquots of 2.5 uL of DNA solution, 2.5 uL of distilled water, 2.5 uL of RDV-Adaptor-Sau3AI adaptor (10 uM) and RDV-Adaptor-HpyCH4IV adaptor (10 uM) were mixed. The sequences and structures of the adapters are shown in figure below. A ligation-convenience kit (Nippon Gene, Toyama, Japan) was used for adaptor ligation. The DNA solution and 10 uL of ligation mix were reacted at 16\u00b0C for 30 min, and the DNA was isolated by using MonoFas. The second cDNA library was amplified by PCR with specially designed primer sets; the forward primers had 5 nt including GATC (Sau3AI-digested sequence) and 1 variable nucleotide added to the 3\u2032 end of the RDV-Adaptor-Sau3AI sequence, and the reverse primers had 6 nt including ACGT (HpyCH4IV-digested sequence) and 2 variable nucleotides added to the 3\u2032 end of the RDV-Adaptor-HpyCH4IV sequence. The PCR mixture was prepared by mixing 15 uL of AmpliTaq Gold PCR Master Mix containing AmpliTaq Gold, 0.5 uL of forward primer for RDV-Adaptor-Sau3AI (10 uM), 0.5 uL of reverse primer for RDV-Adaptor-HpyCH4IV (10 uM), 1 uL of DNA solution, and 13 uL of distilled water. PCR was performed by using 64 primers under the conditions described previously (1).",
