Here, the role of sialic acid in OVM anti-virus activity has been studied by ELISA with lectin or ligand. Structural changes of OVM after removing sialic acid were analyzed by circular dichroism and fluorescence spectroscopy. OVM could be binding to the hemagglutinin (HA) of avian influenza viruses H 5 N 1 and H 1 N 1 , this binding was specific and required the involvement of sialic acid. When sialic acid was removed, the binding was significantly reduced 71.5% and 64.35%, respectively. Therefore, sialic acid was proved as a recognition site which avian influenza virus bound to. Meanwhile, the endogenous fluorescence and surface hydrophobicity of OVM removing sialic acid were increased and the secondary structure tended to shift to random coil. This indicated that OVM molecules were in an unfolded state and spatial conformation disorder raising weakly. Remarkably, free sialic acid strongly promoted OVM binding to HA and thereby enhanced the interaction. It may contribute to the inhibition of host cell infection, agglutinate viruses. This study can be extended to the deepening of passive immunization field.",

The interaction of HA on the surface of the virus with OVM leads to the release of glycopeptide complexes. Hemagglutination inhibition assays and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays have revealed the high affinity of OVM for bovine rotavirus, chicken new castle disease virus and human influenza virus [4] [5] [6] . It was found that Nacetylneuraminic acid (NeuAc, a specific subtype of sialic acid in OVM) in the \u03b2-subunit could greatly facilitate the interaction between OVM and chicken new castle disease virus. The alteration of the conformation of OVM by the alkylation of disulfide bonds leads to loss of binding to OVM antibody [4] . However, evaluations of antiviral activity in these studies focused primarily on the inhibition of viral-induced hemagglutination and did not include other more accurate and intuitive antiviral methods.",

This research studied the interaction between OVM and the influenza virus HA and the role of sialic acid in this interaction. It was found that the OVM carbohydrate chain contains terminal sialic acid with both \u03b1-2-6and \u03b12-3-linkages (Fig. 1B) . HAs cannot bind to other proteins such as BSA but can interact with OVM. This interaction is dependent on the presence of sialic acid (Fig. 2) . Monosaccharides have no influence on the binding of OVM with HA. It is noteworthy that the binding of HA with OVM was strongly promoted by free sialic acid (Figs. 3 and 4) . It is indicating that sialic acid is involved in the binding of OVM to influenza virus, and additional free sialic acid could enhance the OVM antiviral process.",

According to our previous research, OVM contains plenty of sialic acid, and its subtype is NeuAc. In this study, we demonstrated the glycosidic bond type of sialic acid linking the OVM carbohydrate chain terminus, which contains both \u03b12-6and \u03b12-3-linkages. The content of sialic acid with the \u03b12-6-linkage was higher than that with the \u03b12-3-linkage (Fig. 1B) . In the process through which the influenza virus infects the body, the first step is to recognize and bind to the cell surface receptor through the viral surface protein HA [20] . The main receptors are cell surface glycoconjugates, and sialic acid is required for this process. Human influenza viruses mainly recognize \u03b12-6-linked sialic acids, whereas avian influenza viruses prefer \u03b12-3-linked sialic acids [31, 32] . Therefore, due to the type of sialic acid linkages in the OVM oligosaccharide chain, we believe that OVM has anti-infective activity against both human and avian influenza viruses. Furthermore, the anti-avian influenza virus function is closely related to \u03b12-3linked sialic acid.",

Using the HA of influenza viruses H 5 N 1 and H 1 N 1 as the binding protein, the changes in OVM as an acceptor with or without sialic acid binding HA were measured. Firstly, the interaction of OVM before and after removing sialic acid with its antibody was analyzed, and it was found that sialic acid was not the binding site. No significant difference was found in the binding activity before and after the removal of sialic acid. This demonstrates that sialic acid does not participate in all the functions of OVM but also that follow-up experiments can use an ELISA reaction between OVM and an antibody. This ensures that the results are real and effective. Subsequently, the interaction of natural OVM and dSA-OVM with HA was investigated, and no binding reaction between HA and BSA was found, which indicated that the recognition of glycoprotein was specific (Fig. 2) . However, the obvious interaction between HA and natural OVM indicates that HA can specifically recognize OVM and associate with it. On the other hand, the binding of OVM to HA was significantly reduced after sialic acid removal to only 30% to 40% of the original (Fig. 2) . These results showed the same tendency in H 5 N 1 and H 1 N 1 , which proves that sialic acid is involved in the recognition of HA and OVM. After sialic acid was removed, this binding could be inhibited. Thus, we demonstrate that one of the antiviral activity mechanisms of OVM is associated with sialic acid in the OVM oligosaccharide chain competing with the cellular receptor for binding HA. After removing sialic acid, OVM still retains some ability to bind HA, presumably through other recognition mechanisms. In fact, sialic acid was not completely removed after enzymatic hydrolysis (Fig. 1B) . Therefore, this binding may be associated with sialic acid residues, and the role of sialic acid in this mechanism may be underestimated.",

To determine whether Gal, Fuc, Man and free sialic acid could bind with HA, we conducted competition experiment. The results show that after adding of these free sugars first, the binding of OVM and HA was not significantly different and basically maintained at the same level. It suggests that these carbohydrates are not involved in binding and cannot prevent this interaction. Monomeric sialic acid is thought to be unable to compete effectively with the receptor on target cells for binding to influenza virus, while dendritic sialic acid structure is more effective against influenza virus [33] . The process by which influenza virus recognizes sialic acid is strongly related to its linked pattern [14, 19, 34, 35] . This is similar to the finding that free sialic acid does not effectively bind with HA in this study (Fig. 3) .",

It had the same effect on H 5 N 1 and H 1 N 1 (Fig. 4) . Sialic acid in OVM was involved in the recognition of HA. Free sialic acid does not directly bind to HA but mixed with OVM can effectively improve the interaction. Sialic acid is electronegative and carries multiple O atoms and N atoms that can have many unique physicochemical effects [27, 36] . Taken together, this study proposes a novel mechanism hypothesis that sialic acid plays an active role in the antiviral activity of OVM (Fig. 6) . First, sialic acid in the OVM carbohydrate chain is recognized by the influenza virus HA as a receptor [37] . On the other hand, free sialic acid is not directly involved in HA binding, but it can bind OVM to form an eupolymer by electrostatic interaction or hydrogen bond [38] , promote OVM to bind and co-precipitate with HA. Therefore, OVM maintain effective defense against virus, and enhance its antiviral activity. In a future study, this hypothesis will be explored in vitro and in cell experiments.",

The hemagglutinin of the influenza virus recognizes and binds to the ovomucin carbohydrate chain terminal sialic acid, and the interaction is greatly diminished after the sialic acid is removed. Therefore, sialic acid is an important recognition site for ovomucin to play a role in the binding of hemagglutinin competing with host cell surface receptors. At the same time, the removal of ovomucin sialic acid lead to a slight increase in the random coil of secondary structure and enhance surface hydrophobicity. We also found a unique role for free sialic acid. The addition of free sialic acid can promote the binding of ovomucin to hemagglutinin and enhance ovomucin anti-influenza virus activity.
