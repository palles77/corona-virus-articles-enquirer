A new coronavirus (SARS-CoV) was identified as the SARS pathogen 4-7 which triggered severe pneumonia and acute, often lethal, lung failure 8 . Moreover, among infected individuals influenza such as the Spanish flu 9,10 and the emergence of new respiratory disease viruses 11,12 have caused high lethality resulting from acute lung failure 13 . In cell lines, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) has been identified as a potential SARS-CoV receptor 14 . The high lethality of SARS-CoV infections, its enormous economic and social impact, fears of renewed outbreaks as well as the potential misuse of such viruses as biologic weapons make it paramount to understand the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV. Here we provide the first genetic proof that ACE2 is a crucial SARS-CoV receptor in vivo.",

But a possible second receptor, CD209L (L-SIGN), has also been identified from in vitro studies 15 . Thus, it was not known whether ACE2 is indeed crucial for SARS-CoV infections in vivo. To address this question genetically, we infected Ace2 knockout 16 and control wild-type mice with SARS-CoV. As reported previously 17 , SARS-CoV infections of wild-type mice result in viral replication in the lungs and the recovery of large amounts (>10 7 the tissue culture-infectious dose, which will infect 50% of the cell monolayers (TCID 50 T) per gram lung tissue) of infectious virus (Fig. 1a) . In Ace2 knockout mice, only a very low quantity of infectious SARS-CoV virus could be recovered (<10 2 TCID 50 per gram lung tissue; Fig. 1a) , and the copy numbers of SARS-CoV Spike RNA were greatly reduced (Fig. 1b) . SARS-CoV infection of mice is associated with the development of mild pathological changes in the lungs (Fig. 1c,d) . Moreover, pathologic alterations in lungs were reduced in Ace2 mutant mice compared to wild-type mice (Fig. 1c,d) . These data provide the first genetic proof that ACE2 is indeed a crucial in vivo SARS receptor required for effective replication of infectious SARS-CoV.",

Notably, experimental SARS-CoV infections of wild-type mice in vivo resulted in considerably reduced ACE2 expression in the lungs (Fig. 2b) suggesting that reduced ACE2 expression might have a role in SARS-CoV-mediated severe acute lung pathologies. By contrast, ACE lung expression levels were not overtly changed in SARS-CoV-infected mice (Fig. 2b) . We therefore speculated that SARS-CoV might affect lung pathologies through ACE2. To test this idea, we established a defined model system using recombinant SARS-CoV surface-Spike protein, which is the essential ligand for ACE2 binding 14 . This model system allowed us to avoid possible secondary effects resulting from viral replication or infections in vivo and to directly test whether SARS-CoV Spike protein might adversely affect acute lung injury through modulation of ACE2.",

These results show that the SARS-CoV Spike protein can directly affect the development of severe acute lung failure through ACE2. ACE2 functions as a carboxypeptidase, cleaving a single residue from angiotensin I (AngI), generating 24) , and a single residue from angiotensin II (AngII) to generate Ang1-7 (ref. 23 ). The ACE2 homologue ACE, by contrast, cleaves the decapeptide AngI into the octapeptide AngII 25 . Thus, ACE2 counterbalances the function of ACE and negatively regulates AngII production (Fig. 2a) . To test whether Spike-Fc injections indeed affect the function of the renin-angiotensin system, we analyzed AngII levels in the lungs of acid-and Spike-Fctreated mice. Acid aspiration increased AngII levels in the lungs of wild-type mice. Notably, we observed a further, significant increase in AngII levels in the lung tissue of mice treated with Spike-Fc (Fig. 4d) . To confirm whether Spike-Fc promotes lung disease pathogenesis through increased AngII production and functional alterations of the reninangiotensin system, we blocked the AngII receptor type 1 (AT1R) 26 with a specific inhibitor. The AT1R is the crucial receptor that mediates AngII-induced vascular permeability and severe acute lung injury 18 .",

Given this very high lethality of SARS and the enormous economic and social impact of the worldwide SARS outbreak, elucidation of the disease pathogenesis is crucial for future treatment in case of renewed outbreaks. Moreover, a recent outbreak of avian influenza A (H5N1) in humans resulted in up to 70% lethality from acute respiratory failure 12 . Before the discovery of SARS-CoV, two coronaviruses (HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43) were known to infect humans, but they caused only self-limiting upper respiratory tract infections (30% of the common colds) and had never been reported to cause severe illness 27 . The molecular determinants that may account for the dramatic differences in pathogenesis between these human coronaviruses and SARS-CoV were unknown.",

Given that ACE2 is a key negative regulatory factor for severity of lung edema and acute lung failure, SARS-CoV Spike protein-mediated ACE2 downregulation then contributes to the severity of lung pathologies. This scenario would explain how this family member of the 'relatively harmless' coronaviruses has turned into a lethal virus. Notably, recent data in a small cohort of individuals with SARS suggested that an insertion deletion ACE polymorphism that affects ACE function correlates with disease severity 28 , implying that our findings are indeed relevant for humans.",

Viral replication was determined from lung tissue at day 2 of infection. Virus titers (mean log 10 TCID 50 per gram lung tissue) are shown for individual mice. n = 15 per group. SARS-CoV Spike RNA expression was assayed using real-time RT-PCR and normalized to mouse Actb. Data are shown as mean + s.e.m. n = 15 per group. **P < 0.01. (c) Lung histopathology (original magnification \u00d7200) and (d) lung injury scores as defined by leukocyte infiltration of control and SARS-CoV-infected wild-type and Ace2 knockout mice. Lung samples were taken on day 6 after SARS-CoV infection. Downregulation of ACE2 expression by SARS-CoV infection and SARS-CoV Spike protein. (a) Schematic diagram of the renin-angiotensin system in acute lung failure and proposed SARS-CoV action. (b) Decreased ACE2 protein, but normal ACE levels, in the lungs of SARS-CoV-infected mice. Lung homogenates were prepared from control and SARS-CoV-infected wild-type or Ace2 knockout (KO) mice on day 2 and analyzed by western blot.(c) Binding of recombinant Spike(S-1190)-Fc protein to human ACE2 (hACE2) and mouse ACE2 (mACE2) in pull-down assays. Spike-Fc but not control-Fc protein pulled down hACE2 and mACE2 from total-cell extracts of A549 human alveolar epithelial cells and IMCD mouse kidney epithelial cells, respectively. Total lysates are shown as controls. (d) Binding of Spike-Fc protein to human and mouse ACE2 in cell culture. 293 cells transfected with hACE2 or mACE2 were incubated with Spike-Fc and the binding was detected by FACS (blue lines). Nontransfected 293 cells incubated with Spike-Fc followed by Fc-specific antibodies are shown as controls (black line). (e) Decreased cell-surface expression of ACE2 after binding to Spike-Fc protein at 37 \u00b0C compared to 4 \u00b0C in Vero E6 cells. ACE2 surface expression was detected at 3 h of incubation with Spike-Fc using an ACE2-specific monoclonal antibody. Similar data were obtained using Fc-specific antibody to directly detect surface-bound Spike-Fc and to avoid masking of the ACE2 epitope. Representative FACS histograms are shown including a background control with an isotype-matched antibody.",
