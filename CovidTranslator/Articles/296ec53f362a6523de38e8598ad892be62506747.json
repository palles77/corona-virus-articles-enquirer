Recent outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 virus in poultry and in humans have raised concerns that an influenza pandemic will occur in the near future. Transmission from avian species to humans remains sporadic, but the mortality associated with human infection is very high (about 62%). To date, there are no effective therapeutic drugs or a prophylactic vaccines available, which means that there is still a long way to go before we can eradicate or cure avian influenza. This review focuses on the molecular pathogenesis of avian influenza H5N1 virus infection. An understanding of the viral pathogenesis may facilitate the development of novel treatments or effective eradication of this fatal disease.",

In addition, these viruses have created heavy economic burdens on society. Recently, the outbreak of highly pathogenic avian H5N1 influenza virus in poultry and humans (through direct contact with infected avian species) has raised concerns that an influenza pandemic may occur in the near future. Although it is imperative to develop effective measures to prevent influenza pandemics, neither successful strategies nor effective drugs are currently available. Acute lung injury (ALI) is the major manifestation associated with patients hospitalized with H5N1 influenza infection. Many of these patients progress rapidly to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and multi-organ failure [1\u22123] . According to the most recent World Health Organization data, reported on March 11, 2009 , the cumulative mortality attributed to avian influenza H5N1 virus infection is greater than 60% (http://www.who.int/csr/disease/avian_influenza/country /cases_table_2009_03_11/en/index.html). In order to permit eradication of pathogenic avian influenza viruses and to prevent related diseases, many researchers have emphasized the need for research on pathogenesis, epidemiology, therapy, and vaccines [4] . This review focuses on the molecular pathogenesis of the avian influenza H5N1 virus, which may facilitate the development of novel and effective therapeutic drugs or preventative measures for this fatal disease.",

In recent years, the most commonly reported HPAI strain has been H5N1. Avian influenza H5N1 virus emerged as an avian pathogen in 1996 and was isolated from a patient in 1997 [3, 12] . Since then, this strain has circulated in birds and spread to large parts of the world, leading to sporadic human infections, which are thought to be caused by direct contact with infected avian species in most cases. There have been rare reports of human-to-human transmission of this virus. By March 11, 2009 , 411 cases of humans infected with avian influenza H5N1 virus had been re-ported, leading to 256 deaths and a cumulative case fatality rate of 62% (http://www.who.int/csr/disease/ avian_influenza/country/cases_table_2009_03_11/en/ index.html).",

By contrast, antigenic drift is due to the accumulation of point mutations generated during RNA replication by an error-prone RNA-dependent RNA polymerase [7, 13] . Both antigenic drift (mutation) and antigenic shift (reassortment) contribute to the high adaptability of the virus, and its ability to evade the immune system [5] . The winter human influenza season, the scattered and sporadic transmission of avian influenza to humans due to the wide-spread distribution of H5N1 in birds and other mammals, and the development of mutations in the avian influenza virus genome under selective pressure all increase the likelihood of a pandemic in the future [11] . Therefore, some experts believe that it is not a question of whether there will be another influenza pandemic, but a question of when it will occur [11, 14] .",

Traditionally, it was thought that avian influenza viruses preferentially bind to cell surface receptors that have 2,3-sialic acids linked to a galactose residue (SA\u03b12,3-Gal), while human lineage viruses prefer to bind receptors consisting of terminal sialic acids with 2,6 linkages to galactose residues associated with glycoproteins or glycolipids(SA\u03b12,6-Gal) [15, 16] . While the tracheal epitheliums of birds and humans mainly express virus receptors with \u03b12,3 and \u03b12,6 sialic acid linkages, respectively, pigs express both types of recep-tors [17] . This expression pattern provides solid molecular evidence that pigs serve as \"mixing vessels\" for human and avian influenza viruses [18, 19] , which facilitates the reassortment and generation of new pandemic strains that may have the potential for human-to-human transmission. It has recently been suggested that the distribution of terminal SA\u03b12,3-Gal and SA\u03b12,6-Gal within the respiratory tract may not be as clear cut as has been previously reported [20] . Other viral and host components may act as determinants of successful viral replication and transmission [20, 21] .",

The mortality and morbidity associated with influenza infection are not attributable to respiratory disease alone.

In addition, viral RNA has been detected in autopsy samples of multiple non-respiratory organs, including the intestines, liver, spleen, and brain, suggesting widespread viral dissemination [3] . Some reports have indicated a correlation between influenza infection and cardiovascular diseases, such as ischemic stroke and myocardial infarction [22] . There have been two cases of fatal avian influenza H5N1 virus infections without apparent respiratory symptoms, but with acute encephalitis [23] .

The downregulation of a \"good ACE\" (ACE2) by SARS-CoV leads to an increase in angiotensin II, which binds to its receptor AT1aR and aggravates lung injury [34, 35] . Due to similarities in clinical symptoms and ALI manifestations caused by SARS-CoV and avian influenza H5N1 virus, we suggest that RAS may also be involved in influenza H5N1 virus-induced lung injury.",
