            "text": "Proceeding from this, control of the widespread and numerous herpes-viral illnesses is one of the most important problems of contemporary medical science. And although the list of chemical preparations effecting suppression of various stages of reproduction of herpes virus is fairly broad [13] , their medicinal and prophylactic effectiveness does not satisfy practical public health at all. For this reason the epidemic spread of herpes virus infections in the world is steadily continuing, and the search for antiherpetic agents with a different mechanism of action has not lost its urgency. In a continuation of investigations on the search for new biologically active substances among the derivatives of 4-hydroxyquinolin-2-ones and heterocyclic systems related to them, the present communication is devoted to N-R-amides of 2-hydroxy-4-oxo-4H-pyrido[1,2-a]pyrimidine-3-carboxylic acids 2-6. These compounds were chosen by us as subjects of investigation, on the basis of a preliminary prognosis carried out with the PASS [14] program, showing a fairly high, not less than 60%, probability of them displaying antiherpes properties. Solubility in water is an important characteristic of a potential antiviral agent, substantially facilitating its study. In view of that, we limited the circle of substances being investigated to dialkylaminoalkylamides, since if necessary they may always be readily converted into water-soluble quaternary ammonium salts with mineral acids. 7.50 (d, J = 8.8) 3.40 (2\u041d, q, J = 6.5, NHCH2); 2.28 (2\u041d, t, J = 6.9, NHCH2CH2CH2); 2.14 (6\u041d, s, 2CH3); 1.68 (2\u041d, q, J = 6.8, NHCH2\u0421\u041d2\u0421\u041d2N) The desired compounds 2-6 ( Table 1) were obtained by amidation of the ethyl esters of the corresponding 2-hydroxy-4-oxo-4H-pyrido[1,2-a]pyrimidine-3-carboxylic acids 1a-e with an excess of dialkylaminoalkylamine in boiling ethanol. They were all colorless crystalline substances, readily soluble in alcohols and practically insoluble in ether. The moderate solubility of dialkylaminoalkylamides 2-6 in water enabled a study of their antiviral properties to be carried out without conversion into salts.",

            "text": "The structures of all the synthesized substances were confirmed by 1 H NMR spectra ( Table 2 ). The structure of one of the compounds, amide 4d, was investigated in a more detailed manner by X-ray structural analysis (Fig. 1, Tables 3 and 4) . It was established that all the non-hydrogen atoms of its pyridinopyrimidine bicycle and also the O (1) , C (9) , O (3) , N (3) , C (10) , O (2) , and C (16) atoms lie in one plane with a precision of 0.02 \u00c5, which is probably caused by the presence of two strong intramolecular hydrogen bonds: O (1) -H (10) \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7O (3) (H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7O 1.56 \u00c5, O-H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7O 158 o ) and N (3) -H (3N) \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7O (2) (H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7O 1.95 \u00c5, N-H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7O 136\u00b0) . The formation of the indicated hydrogen bonds leads to a significant redistribution of electron density in the pyrimidone fragment. The C (6) -C (7) 1.412 (2) In the pyridine fragment of amide 4d a tendency was observed towards the localization of bonds. The bond lengths of C (4) -C (5) 1.349(2) and C (2) -C (3) 1,365(2) \u00c5 were significantly shortened and the bonds C (3) -C (4) 1.418(2) and C (2) -C (1) 1.417(2) \u00c5 were lengthened. An analogous effect has also been noted in other pyridopyrimidines [17, 18] . The C (11) atom is found in the ap-conformation relative to the C (9) -N (3) bond (torsion angle C (9) -N (3) -C (10) -C (11) 173.8(1)\u00b0). The N (4) atom has a pyramidal configuration (sum of valence angles centred on the nitrogen atom is 332.1 o ) and is found in the +sc-conformation relative to the N (3) -C (10) bond (torsion angle N (3) -C (10) -C (11) -N (4) 62.9(2)\u00b0). The C (12) -C (13) ethyl substituent occupies a position intermediate between -ac-and apr-conformations, but the C (14) -C (15) ethyl substituent is found in the +sc-conformation relative to the C (11) -C (10) bond (torsion angles C (12) -N (4) -C (11) -C (10) 155.9(1), C (14) -N (4) -C (11) -C (10) 80.7(2)\u00b0). The C (13) atom has an orientation close to +sc, but the C (15) has an orientation close to ap relative to the C (11) -N (4) bond (torsion angles C (11) -N (4) -C (12) -C (13) 75.9(2), C (11) -N (4) -C (14) -C (15) -160.0(2)\u00b0). Such a position of the ethyl groups leads to shortened intramolecular contacts -H (10b) \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7C (14) The creation of effective and safe antiviral preparations is one of the most complex problems in contemporary pharmaceutical chemistry and medicine. The complexicity of this consists of the need to develop substances capable of selectively repressing reproduction of the virus without affecting the active life of the cells of the host organism. Because of this the first step of the biological testing of amides 2-6 was the determination of their cytotoxicity. Cultures of transplanted calf embryo kidney cells (CK) and calf coronary vessels (CCV) were used for this. As it turned out, at a concentration of 0.5% a toxic effect was recorded for the majority of amides 2-6 even on the second day by the appearance of individual degenerated cells on a background of incipient destruction of the cell monolayer. On the fifth day signs of cytotoxic action were intensified even more. Significant destruction of the monolayer of cells was observed by the appearance of conglomerates of degenerated cells (rounded forms with granular cytoplasm) and tearing of them away from the glass surface. In the majority of these cases cytotoxicity was assessed as destruction of the cell monolayer by 50%. And finally, complete degeneration of almost all cells set in after 7-8 days of cultivation. Control cell cultures (CK and CCV) still displayed viability at this time, although the appearance was also observed of individual degenerative cells on a background of incipient destruction of the cell monolayer. It follows from the experiments carried out that at a concentration of 0.5% amides 2-6 show a negative effect on the morphology of cultured CK and CCV cells and due to the expressed toxicity cannot be used for carrying out further investigations. Nonetheless, a concentration of 0.25% of amides 2-6 proved to be less toxic and some of them (for example, 2b,e,f,h, 4d, and 5h) in the first days of observation displayed only insignificant signs of cytotoxic action. More substantial injury of cells and the cell monolayer was noted towards the end of five days. Of all the studied derivatives of 2-hydroxy-4-oxo-4H-pyrido[1,2-a]pyrimidine-3-carboxylic acids 2-6 only two substances, amides 5d and 5i, at a concentration of 0.25% did not in general show a cytotoxic action over a stretch of several days. Only towards the fifth day of observation were the first signs of toxic injury displayed. However towards this time analogous changes were also noted in control cell cultures. On the basis of the investigations carried out it may therefore be stated that one of the main criteria taken into consideration on selecting substances with potential antiviral activity, viz. the absence of an effect on the cell of a macroorganism, is fulfilled by 0.25% aqueous solutions of amides 5d and 5i, which were passed on to the following stage of screening.",

Both of the investigated substances proved to be capable of significantly inhibiting the reproduction of HSV-1, amide 5i by 1.5 log and amide 5d by 2.2 log.

The origin of it was coronavirus, one of the most important representatives of the RNA-containing viruses. In spite of the whole intensity of the investigations undertaken, the search for effective anticoronavirus drugs, regrettably, has not yet been crowned with success and is still urgent. Considering that amides 5d and 5i displayed antiviral activity in relation to HSV-1, they were tested by us as possible inhibitors of the hemagglutinating activity of coronaviruses. It was established that amides 5d and 5i did not show a significant effect on the viability of coronavirus. Consequently their further investigation in this direction is unpromising. The structure was solved by the direct method with the SHELXTL set of programs [20] . The positions of hydrogen atoms were made apparent from an electron density difference synthesis and were refined isotropically. The structure was refined on F 2 with the full matrix least squares method in an anisotropic approach for non-hydrogen atoms to wR 2 = 0.127 for 3576 reflections (R 1 = 0.051 at 2688 reflections with F > 4\u03c3(F), S = 1.094).

To prevent possible bacterial contamination of the nutrient media, the antibiotics penicillin and streptomycin were added when carrying out experimental investigations. Both types of cells were cultured in a thermostat at 37 o C and a medium pH of 7.2-7.4 for 2 days. After this, growth medium was removed from the test tubes and aqueous solutions (about 0.2 ml) of the amides 2-6 being tested at concentrations of 0.25 and 0.5% and supporting nutrient medium (about 0.8 ml) were introduced to the formed monolayer of cultured cells. The test tubes, about 10 for each specimen at both concentrations, were incubated at 37 o C, and observed for 7-8 days. Test tubes with cell cultures without addition of substances being studied served as controls.
