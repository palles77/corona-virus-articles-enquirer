Here we report the cloning of an IRAK1 cDNA (named ScIRAK1) from the mandarin fish. The predicted ScIRAK1 peptide contains a death domain and a serine/threonine-specific kinase domain. Quantitative RT-PCR showed that ScIRAK1 mRNA was primarily expressed in blood cells and posterior kidney. Seven days following infection with infectious spleen and kidney necrosis virus (ISKNV), the ScIRAK1 mRNA level was significantly higher in the blood cells of clinically symptomatic fish than in the blood cells of asymptomatic fish or control fish injected with phosphate-buffered saline. Additional experiments showed that overexpression of ScIRAK1 in the 293T cells could induce NF-jB activation. These results suggest that ScIRAK1 may play a role in the pathology of ISKNV infection in the mandarin fish.",

IL-1 receptor activated kinases (IRAKs) play crucial roles as mediators in the TLR/IL-1R signal transduction pathways [2] . Moreover, IRAK family member IRAK1 has been identified as a key component of the IL-1R signaling pathway in mammals [3] . Upon ligand binding to TLR/IL-1R, IRAK1 is recruited to the receptor complex to initiate the NF-jB signaling pathway, leading to induction of inflammatory target genes such as TNF-a, IL-6, IL-1b, and IL-12 [4] . Furthermore, IRAK1 is involved in activation and nuclear translocation of STAT3 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 3), STAT1 and IRF7 (interferon regulation factor 7), as well as in downstream gene expression [2, 5, 6] . Phosphorylated IRAK1 also undergoes ubiquitin-mediated degradation or sumoylation resulting in nuclear translocation and transcriptional activation of inflammatory target genes [7] . However, little is known about IRAK family member functions in fish, with the exception of zebrafish [8, 9] .",

            "text": "The mandarin fish Siniperca chuatsi is a predominantly farmed fish species in China, with an annual output of 210,000 tons with a value of 1.5 billion US dollars in 2007. In the last decade, the spread of infectious spleen and kidney necrosis virus (ISKNV) has resulted in significant economic loss for many fish farms [10, 11] . ISKNV is classified in the Megalocystivirus genus of the Iridoviridae family. Thirteen cultured fish species and 39 wild fish species have been confirmed to be hosts of ISKNV-like viruses [12] , including the mandarin fish. Infected fish develop serious systemic diseases [13] , and ISKNV infection is capable of causing severe epizootics resulting in mass mortalities. Therefore, it is important to study the pathology and immunity of the mandarin fish in order to search for effective ways to protect the fish from diseases. In the present study, we cloned an IRAK1 cDNA from the mandarin fish (named ScIRAK1), and showed that after ISKNV infection, the ScIRAK1 mRNA level was significantly higher in fish with typical disease symptoms than in fish without symptoms or control fish injected with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Furthermore, overexpression of ScIRAK1 in the 293T cells could induce NF-jB activation. These results suggest that ScIRAK1 may play a role in the pathology of ISKNV infection in the mandarin fish.",

Two degenerate oligonucleotide primers (F1 and R1, Table 1 ) were designed based on the conserved cDNA sequences of IRAK1 from human, mouse, dog, frog and zebrafish. Touchdown PCR reactions were performed using primers F1 and R1, with 1 cycle of denaturation at 94\u00b0C for 3 min, 10 cycles of 94\u00b0C for 30 s, 58-1\u00b0C/cycle for 40 s, 72\u00b0C for 40 s, and 28 cycles of 94\u00b0C for 35 s, 48\u00b0C for 40 s and 72\u00b0C for 40 s, followed by a 5 min extension at 72\u00b0C. PCR products were cloned into the pGEM-T Easy vector (Promega, USA) and sequenced.

Upon ligand binding to TLR/IL-1R, IRAK1 binds to MyD88, which interacts with the receptor. IRAK1 is subsequently phosphorylated and activated by IRAK4. Hyperphosphorylated IRAK1 then leaves the receptor complex and forms a cytosolic IRAK1-TRAF6 (TNF receptor-associated factor 6) complex, resulting in eventual activation of the downstream pathways [2] . Phosphorylation of IRAK1 is a hallmark of IRAK activation. In humans, Thr-209 and Thr-387 in IRAK1 are phosphorylated [18] . These two threonine residues are conserved in ScIRAK1 (Thr-193 and Thr-373, Fig. 1 ). Therefore, we speculate that ScIRAK1 may be phosphorylated during TLR activation.",

            "text": "After pathogen infection, activation of NF-jB may create inappropriate inflammatory responses (a so-called ''cytokine storm\") that can inadvertently damage the host to such a degree that it causes illness and even death [21] . Documented examples of this phenomenon include the following: infection with the West Nile Virus (WNV) leads to a cytokine storm and subsequent disruption of the blood-brain barrier, which facilitates entry of the virus into the brain [22] ; reinfection with dengue virus results in dengue hemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome, which has been linked to a cytokine storm, ultimately causing an increase in vascular permeability [23] ; and infections with viruses such as poxvirus [21] , severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) [24] [25] [26] and influenza virus [27] result in tissue damages as a result of a cytokine storm. IRAK1 has been reported to play important roles in tissue injury related to a cytokine storm. For example, IRAK1 was shown to be a central kinase involved in acute LPS-induced myocardial contractile dysfunction and septic shock [28, 29] . In this study, at the 7th day after ISKNV infection, most infected fish showed typical symptoms, and quantitative RT-PCR showed that the ScIRAK1 mRNA level was significantly higher in the diseased fish than in the fish without symptoms. Further work showed that ScIRAK1 could induce NF-jB activation. Thus, it is possible that upregulation of ScIRAK1 in the mandarin fish after ISKNV infection may activate NF-jB, resulting in a ''cytokine storm\" and subsequent tissue damage, which is related to disease progression and pathology. 3 . Relative induction of luciferase activity by ScIRAK1. The 293T cells were transfected with 150 ng of pCMV-IRAK1 or pCMV-Flag plasmid, 50 ng pNF-jB-Luc together with 1 ng pRL-TK Renilla luciferase plasmid (as an internal control, Promega, USA). At 24 or 48 h after transfection, cells were harvested, and firefly and Renilla luciferase activities were measured using Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System. Data are presented as means and SD from three independent biological samples (three cell cultures) with three replicates from each sample. Asterisks indicate significant differences (P < 0.01) as determined by one-way AVONA.",

The expression level of ScIRAK1 mRNA in the spleen was used as the calibrator (set as 1). (B) Quantitative PCR analysis of ScIRAK1 mRNA expression in the blood cells after ISKNV or PBS injection. The expression level of ScIRAK1 mRNA in healthy blood cells (day 0) was used as the calibrator (set as 1). 7S indicates the fish with apparent symptoms 7 days after virus infection; 7NS indicates the fish without any symptoms 7 days after virus infection.
