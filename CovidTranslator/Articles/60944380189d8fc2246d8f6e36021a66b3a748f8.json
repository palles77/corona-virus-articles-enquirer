            "text": "mRNA has broad potential for treating diseases requiring protein expression. However, mRNA can also induce an immune response with associated toxicity. Replacement of uridine bases with pseudouridine has been postulated to modulate both mRNA immunogenicity and potency. Here, we explore the immune response and activity of lipid nanoparticle-formulated unmodified and pseudouridine-modified mRNAs administered systemically in vivo. Pseudouridine modification to mRNA had no significant effect on lipid nanoparticle physical properties, protein expression in vivo, or mRNA immunogenicity compared to unmodified mRNA when delivered systemically with liver-targeting lipid nanoparticles, but reduced in vitro transfection levels. Indicators of a transient, extracellular innate immune response to mRNA were observed, including neutrophilia, myeloid cell activation, and up-regulation of four serum cytokines. This study provides insight into the immune responses to mRNA lipid nanoparticles, and suggests that pseudouridine modifications may be unnecessary for therapeutic application of mRNA in the liver.",

            "text": "Messenger RNA (mRNA) delivery is emerging as an attractive strategy for the treatment of a variety of diseases. 1 Nanoparticle delivery vehicles, including lipid nanoparticles (LNPs), polymer nanoparticles, viruses, and others, have been developed as tools to encapsulate and deliver RNAs into the cytoplasm, as naked nucleic acids cannot readily cross cell membranes. [2] [3] [4] In vitro transcribed (IVT) mRNA is known to activate various pattern recognition receptors, including toll-like receptors 5,6 (TLR3, TLR7, TLR8), RIG-I, 7 and RNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR), 8 leading to an antiviral immune response. 9 Synthetic base modifications have been reported to mitigate immunogenicity and improve the stability of small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) 10 , and it has been hypothesized that similar strategies could also prove beneficial for mRNA therapeutics. 11 To reduce the immunogenicity and increase stability of therapeutic mRNAs, the use of naturally-occurring base modifications has been proposed, including pseudouridine, 12 5-methylcytidine, 13 2-thiouridine, 14 N 6methyladenosine 15 , and N 1 -methylpseudouridine. 16 However, one disadvantage of basemodified mRNAs is the potential for decreased translational capacity of the mRNA. 12, 17 One common approach to mRNA base modifications is the 100% substitution of uridine with pseudouridine (PseudoU), which is sometimes used in combination with 5methylcytidine replacement of cytidine. 18 , 19 Karik\u00f3 and co-workers performed pioneering work with PseudoU modification to mRNA, finding that PseudoU-modified mRNAs resisted ribonuclease (RNase) degradation, 20 reduced activation of TLRs 6 and PKR 8 , and interestingly resulted in improved translational efficacy both in vitro and in vivo compared to unmodified mRNAs when delivered with both liposomal and non-liposomal formulations. 12, 21 However, Thess et al. 22 recently reported that that PseudoU modifications significantly diminished mRNA translation and that codon-optimized unmodified mRNAs did not upregulate three measured pro-inflammatory cytokines in vivo when delivered intraperitoneally with a lipid/polymer non-liposomal transfection reagent. We hypothesize that these differing literature reports regarding the immunogenicity and efficacy of PseudoUmodified mRNAs in vivo (summarized in Table 1 ) may be due to 1) limited analysis 23 of the extracellular innate immune response to mRNAs in vivo and 2) the use of different delivery vehicles, methodologies, and material properties between studies. It has been previously demonstrated that delivery material properties [24] [25] [26] [27] can dramatically affect the potency of encapsulated nucleic acids, and Pardi et al. recently reported that 1-methylpseudouridinemodified mRNA-LNPs have different kinetics and efficacy in vivo depending on the route of administration. 28 The effect of PseudoU modifications on mRNA immunogenicity and efficacy remains an outstanding question with important implications for therapeutic application of mRNA. Therefore, in the present work we aimed to perform a thorough analysis of the extracellular innate immune response to and efficacy of mRNA with and without PseudoU modifications in vivo using mice. To maximize protein expression, mRNA was delivered intravenously 28 using LNPs based on the lipid-like material C12-200, 24, 29 which have recently been studied therapeutically in a hemophilia B mouse model. 30 Our results indicate that PseudoU modification of mRNA does not measurably change the LNP physical properties and neither improves the efficacy nor reduces the immunogenicity of the mRNA-LNP when delivered systemically. Furthermore, at high mRNA doses we discovered indicators of a yetuncharacterized, transient extracellular innate immune response to intravenously-delivered mRNA-LNPs, including cytokine elevation, neutrophilia, and myeloid cell activation in the blood and spleen. In all, these data do not indicate improved in vivo performance with PseudoU modification of mRNA, and suggest that unmodified mRNA may be at least as suitable for systemic mRNA-LNP administration.",

When mRNA-LNPs were injected intravenously at high doses, we observed varying degrees of elevation in the levels of a variety of interleukins, colony stimulating factors, and chemokines at six hours postinjection relative to a control of LNPs without mRNA. The most upregulated cytokines (G-CSF, MCP-1, RANTES, MIG) were confirmed to be dependent on dose of mRNA (Fig. 5b) , and at sufficiently low doses of mRNA, cytokine response was minimal.

At a sufficiently high dose of mRNA (0.5 mg/kg), we observed neutrophilia (increased percentage of neutrophils among total immune cells) in both the blood (Fig. 6a ) and the spleen (Fig. 6b ). In addition, neutrophils in both the blood and spleen expressed significantly higher levels of cell-surface proteins that are markers for neutrophil activation, including CD14 and CD69, with CD11b also increased in the spleen (Fig. 6c) . Notably, neutrophil levels returned to baseline (Fig. S5a, b) and activation markers were no longer upregulated 72 hours post-injection (Fig. S6c) , suggesting that neutrophilia induced by mRNA administration is a transient response.

The systemic use of mRNA requires a delivery vehicle to ensure cellular uptake, target specific tissues/cell types, and prevent mRNA degradation. 4 Recently, LNPs have been demonstrated as efficient mRNA delivery vehicles and have been studied in vivo in a therapeutic context 22, 35, 36 .

Elevation of these cytokines has been previously implicated in the innate immune response to foreign nucleic acids: in human fetal membranes, viral ssRNA was found to upregulate MCP-1, RANTES, and G-CSF, among other cytokines (MIG was not tested). 39 Additionally, it was reported that MIG and RANTES were both significantly elevated following mRNA transfection of A549 cells in vitro, 40 and the RANTES secretion from A549 cells did not appear to be significantly different between lipoplexed unmodified and PseudoU mRNA. 16 These four cytokines are involved in neutrophil recruitment and function: G-CSF controls neutrophil proliferation, differentiation, and trafficking, 41 and the other three (MCP-1, RANTES, MIG) are inflammatory chemokines, typically signaling recruitment of more myeloid cells such as neutrophils to sites of inflammation or infection. 42 Indeed, neutrophilia and neutrophil activation were also observed in response to both unmodified and PseudoU-modified mRNA-LNPs at 6 hours post-injection (Fig. 6 ). Neutrophilia and inflammatory cytokine response are commonly observed as part of an innate immune response to RNA-based viral infectious agents. 43 mRNA-loaded lipid nanoparticles share several structural similarities to some types of ssRNA viruses. Like mRNA-LNPs, ssRNA viruses can have spherical morphologies, a diameter on the order of 100 nm, and single-stranded RNA decorating the outside of the particle. 44 Cytokine production and neutrophilia have been observed in response to ssRNA viruses (including West Nile Virus, 45 SARS, 46 and Hantavirus 47 ) through the activation of receptors that recognize pathogen-associated and damage-associated molecular patterns. Our data suggests that regardless of PseudoU modification, the innate immune system may interpret mRNAladen LNPs at high enough doses through similar molecular pattern recognition mechanisms. However, of importance is the observation that these responses are hyper-acute (observed 6 hours post-injection) and transient (returned to baseline by 72 hours).",

Our results suggest that intravenously-injected mRNA-LNPs can interact with phagocytic myeloid cells in the bloodstream and neutrophils specifically are activated and secrete several cytokines. Circulating neutrophils are also observed in higher percentages and are activated in the spleen. We postulate that either activated neutrophils or blood monocytes which interact with mRNA-LNPs activate dendritic cells and macrophages in the spleen. Moreover, encapsulated mRNA is expressed predominately in the liver with some expression occurring in the spleen (Fig. 7) . Independent of conclusions based on mRNA modification, these results contribute mechanistic insight into the nature of the innate immune response elicited by therapeutic mRNAs in circulation. Further, this model suggests potential approaches to reduce this immune response by decreasing blood concentration of mRNA-LNPs and thereby minimizing their interaction with circulating myeloid cells. For example, it may be possible to mediate these effects through a gradual intravenous drip of mRNA-LNPs rather than bolus infusion.",

It is also noteworthy that incorporation of PseudoU into mRNA significantly reduces IVT yields (Table S1 ) and PseudoU triphosphate is currently much more expensive than uridine triphosphate when obtained commercially at small scales. Our results suggest that PseudoU modifications do not improve the efficacy or alter immunogenicity in vivo, and indicate that unmodified mRNAs may be preferred in future applications requiring systemic delivery of mRNA-LNPs. Future work will be necessary to determine if other mRNA base modifications do in fact improve efficacy or alter immunogenicity of the mRNA when delivered systemically with LNPs. For example, N(1)-methylpseudouridine has recently been reported 16 to result in significantly higher translation in vivo compared to unmodified mRNAs when delivered with lipofectamine/mRNA complexes via intramuscular and intradermal administration; however, it remains to be seen if these results change with different delivery vehicles, administration routes, and mRNA properties as listed in Table 1 .",

Furthermore, PseudoU modification of mRNA did not improve the efficacy of the mRNA-LNP in vitro or in vivo. Lastly, we identified three previously-unreported indicators of a modest and transient extracellular innate immune response to mRNA-LNPs -myeloid cell activation, neutrophilia, and cytokine elevation -but determined that PseudoU modification of mRNA does not reduce this immune response.
