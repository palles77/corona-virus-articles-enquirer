We found these assays to be useful for routine applications in kennels with large numbers of puppies at risk. The results of these assays are available in 1 min and do not require any special instrumentation.

Effective commercial modified live virus vaccines that vary in the genotype (CPV type 2 [CPV-2] and CPV-2b) of CPV in the vaccine are available. There is currently no commercial vaccine with CPV-2c in the vaccine. However, induction of active immunity in puppies is blocked by maternal immunity in the puppies (18) . The stability of CPV in the kennel environment and excretion of large amounts of CPV by sick puppies can expose susceptible puppies to massive infectious doses of CPV. This CPV susceptibility window coincides with weaning in puppies in the age group of about 6 to 8 weeks old. Eight weeks is the age when the largest number of puppies succumb to CPV. Moreover, there are variations in the decay of antibodies and induction of active immunity after vaccination directed by the genetic makeup (canine major histocompatibility antigens) of the puppies.",

The buffer was the same as for the HA test, PBS (0.2 M PBS [pH 7.2]). Cooled glass plates (catalogue number M 6225; American Scientific Products) were kept in the freezer compartment of the refrigerator, cleaned, and ready to use. Each plate had 30 circles. For the assay, each plate was wiped with a paper towel to remove the moisture and kept on Styrofoam to keep it cool during the procedure. Twenty microliters of unknown sample was added as a drop on the plate. To each well, 20 l of porcine erythrocytes (2.5% [vol/vol]) suspended in 0.2 M PBS with 2% fetal bovine serum (FBS) were added as a separate drop in the circle. The total volume was made up to 50 l with 10 l of 0.2 M PBS as the third drop. Three drops were mixed with a wooden toothpick in a circular motion for 30 s. CPV-positive samples produced agglutination within 1 minute. Negative samples were homogeneous and showed no agglutination. However, all samples were further incubated in the refrigerator for an additional 5 min before the results were recorded and confirmed microscopically. CPV-positive samples showed large clumps of agglutination ( Fig. 1) , and CPVnegative samples showed single erythrocytes homogenously spread in the well (Fig. 2 ). Partial agglutination was microscopically confirmed with smaller clumps of porcine erythrocytes. Weak CPV-positive samples can take up to 3 min to agglutinate in the refrigerator. For determination of the amount of the virus, the CPV-positive samples were diluted twofold in a U-bottom well plate (Linbro/ Titertek) (96-well U-well plate) (ICN Biologicals, Inc., Aurora, Ohio). Using the SAT procedure, the results were recorded as agglutination, no agglutination, and partial agglutination. The dilution of the sample that showed partial agglutination was recorded as 1 hemagglutinating unit (HAU). This convention and calculation were adopted from the hemagglutination inhibition assays for CPV. The dilution that contained 1 HAU was divided by 8 to calculate the dilution containing 8 HAU of CPV (For example, fecal sample number 08071352 had a titer of 1:256 on SAT titration.

For all the assays, equal amount of blood from two different pigs was collected in Alsever's solution and used within 1 week. The clarity and visibility of erythrocyte clumps based on their size were used as the criteria for selecting the erythrocyte concentration. Based on an experiment using a CPV-positive sample and a CPV-negative sample, 2.5% porcine erythrocytes gave the clearest positive and negative results, and this concentration was used throughout the tests. Three different final volumes of reaction mixture were tried, 30 l, 40 l, and 50 l per circle of the glass plate. We found that the final reaction mixture volume of 50 l was the most suitable for the well size (circle) in our experiment. Our plates had circles with an internal diameter of 1.9 cm. This decision was made based on the amount of liquid that completely filled the plate circle without spilling outside during mixing with toothpicks using circular motion. We studied the effect of the FBS concentration in the PBS buffer on the size of the clumps and visibility of the agglutination reaction using three different concentrations of FBS, 1%, 2%, and 3%. We found that 2% FBS was suitable for the SAT. The final reaction mixture contained 20 l of the We performed all the tests using reagents that were stored in a refrigerator and chilled on wet ice in a Styrofoam bucket. The solutions were kept chilled during use. The ambient temperature of the virology laboratory was set at 72\u00b0C and thermostatically controlled. However, the test also performed well on a brucellosis card test with teardrop-shaped wells with chilled reagents. A total of 23 chloroform-extracted fecal suspensions and 60 cell culture supernatants were tested by the SAT. The correct CPV status (positive/negative), CPV genotype if positive, and titer of the virus as determined by conventional plate HA was known for all samples. Further, virus isolation was performed on all the fecal samples on the CRFK cell line. After virus isolation, the amount of the CPV in cell supernatant was determined by the plate HA test for CPV. We found a very high correlation (100% positive/negative status for CPV) between the SAT results with conventional hemagglutination test (Fig. 3) . Only samples with hemagglutination titers on the plate HA test equal to or below 40 were found negative in the SAT. A plate HA titer of \u05451:40 is considered negative. Thus, the SAT was found to be slightly less sensitive but more accurate in classifying the fecal samples for CPV status. The CPV samples that are less than 1:40 do not react in the SAT. When the endpoint titers for the same sample by SAT and conventional plate HA tests were compared, the sensitivity of SAT was lower than that for the standard hemagglutination test. However, the SAT classifies the fecal samples correctly on every clinical sample (n \u03ed 23) tested. A total of 60 cell culture samples were tested. Of these, 26 were positive by the conventional plate hemagglutination test and 34 were negative. The SAT missed six positive cell culture samples. Thus, for cell culture-propagated CPV isolates, we found a lower sensitivity by the SAT assay. This variation is probably due to differences in suitable pH requirement (pH 6.5 to 7.2) for carnivore parvoviruses propagated in cell culture (13) .",

From February 2006 to October 2008, a total of 163 CPV samples have been genotyped at the OADDL. Of these samples, 13 were CPV-2, 82 were CPV-2b, 67 were CPV-2c, and 1 was mixed CPV-2b and CPV-2c (9; S. Kapil, unpublished data from OADDL records). There are other reports of mixed CPV-2 infections.

The only limitation of the LFA is that these assays can be cost prohibitive for routine use when very large numbers of samples have to be tested in kennel situation. Moreover, LFAs are qualitative or semiquantitative but still very useful screening diagnostic tools. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays for both CPV antigen and antibody have been developed (12, 15) .

The only potential limitation of our assay is the need to bleed a pig to obtain erythrocytes. However, it can be solved by properly fixing the swine erythrocytes that will provide a longer shelf life at room temperature (11) . We have done a preliminary trial with formalin-fixed swine erythrocytes. We found that 4% formalin fixation can adversely affect the performance of the SAT for CPV detection (S. Y. Marulappa and S. Kapil, unpublished data). Thus, we are trying other fixatives to stabilize the porcine erythrocytes for the SAT. Fresh swine erythrocytes can be used for only 1 week and require refrigeration.

The SIT assay can be used to refine the time of vaccination for CPV puppy shots. For example, if the puppy has high levels of maternal antibodies, the puppy can be vaccinated later. However, if there is no antibody titer, the puppy can be vaccinated after the negative or low CPV antibody check. CPV antigen and antibody monitoring using easy and economic assays will lead to better and timely CPV vaccination compliance and more effective take of the CPV vaccine antigens. The SAT assay can also be used to check the environmental swipes/swabs for CPV contamination quickly, and if CPV is present, the area can be cleaned and disinfected. The SAT assay can be used to verify the efficiency of decontamination of an area. We found both assays to be practical for kennel use. Because the reagents (PBS and porcine erythrocytes) are commonly available, the assays can be used in developing countries for CPV monitoring. The cost per test is very low, and all animals can be repeatedly checked for antibodies in serum against CPV. The conventional CPV HA test takes 2 to 4 h, and we have transformed the hemagglutination assays for CPV antigen and antibody into rapid and easy formats of SAT-SIT assays. Similarly, tests for the other significant hemagglutinating viruses, such as influenza A virus and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, can also benefit from modification to SAT-SIT format assays using the buffer conditions and erythrocyte conditions compatible with those viruses. Thus, SAT-SIT can replace the conventional plate hemagglutination tests as quick screening tests. SAT-SIT technology will be useful for any situation where rapid, low cost, low tech screening is needed for any hemagglutinating virus in outbreak situations in developing countries.",
