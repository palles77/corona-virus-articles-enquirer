METHODS: EF were incubated at 37 \u00b0C anaerobically with rabbit intestinal flora, and then water-saturated ethyl acetate was used for sample extraction at different time points. Furthermore, gluconolactone was added at different concentrations (8, 12 and 16 mg\u00b7mL \u22121 ) to study its inhibition of the metabolism of EF in rabbit intestinal flora. The separation was performed on a ODS column by gradient elution with acetonitrile-water (including 0.1% formic acid respectively) as mobile phase at detection wavelength of 335 nm. RESULTS: EF were metabolized to icariside II in 2 h, and then to icaritin when incubated for 8 h; gluconolactone showed the inhibition of EF metabolism in rabbit intestinal flora in a concentration-dependent manner. CONCLUSION: EF were found to be metabolized rapidly by hydrolysis of rabbit intestinal flora to produce icariside II and icaritin; and the total inhibition was achieved by gluconolactone at a concentration of 16 mg\u00b7mL \u22121 .

Modern pharmacological research indicated that icariin was beneficial for vasodilatation [2] , immunoregulation [3] and anti-osteoporosis [4] . Recent studies also showed that oral administration of Epimedium-derived flavonoid glycosides (EF, with icariin as the main component) could exert beneficial effect on the prevention of steroid-associated osteonecrosis in rabbit model with inhibition of both intravascular-thrombosis and extravascular-lipid-deposition [5] . Further studies in vitro showed that icaritin, but not EF, displayed direct effects on the protection of vein endothelial cell and inhibition of lipid deposition in a dose-dependent manner [6] . These suggested that EF might be used as prodrug and exert effects by being metabolized to their aglycone with in vivo bioactivity of preventing anti-steroid-associated osteonecrosis.",

Some investigation on the metabolism of icariin in intestinal flora of rats [9] and humans [10] had been carried out. However, the metabolism of EF in rabbit intestinal flora is still difficult to be estimated because of the differences of metabolic abilities of intestinal flora among different animal species. Therefore, this paper marks the first time that the metabolism of EF in intestinal flora of rabbits is studied.",
