            "text": "The vast majority of plant and animal viruses have RNA genomes. Viral gene expression and replication are controlled by cis-acting elements in the viral genome, which have been viewed conventionally as localized structures. However, recent research has altered this perception and provided compelling evidence for cooperative activity involving distantly positioned RNA elements. This chapter focuses on viral RNA elements that interact across hundreds or thousands of intervening nucleotides to control translation, genomic RNA synthesis, and subgenomic mRNA transcription. We discuss evidence supporting the existence and function of the interactions, and speculate on the regulatory roles that such long-distance interactions play in the virus life cycle. We emphasize viruses in the Tombusviridae and Luteoviridae families in which long-distance interactions are best characterized, but similar phenomena in other viruses are also discussed. Many more examples likely remain undiscovered.",

For RNA viruses, specific RNA sequences, structures, and interactions play critical roles in modulating these processes. Although often viewed as one-or two-dimensional structures, RNAs are three-dimensional molecules with complex tertiary interactions that may span long distances relative to the linear arrangement of nucleotides (2). Viral RNAs are actually four-dimensional, because coordinated changes in the structure and hence function of a given region occur over time in order to achieve productive infection. In many cases, the communication required between distal RNA elements is provided by RNA-RNA interactions.",

Thus, many viral and cellular mRNAs contain cis-acting signals in the 5\u2032 untranslated region (UTR) that affect translation efficiency (17). These include the translation enhancers such as the omega sequence of Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) (75) and the 5\u2032 UTR of Alfalfa mosaic virus (AMV) RNA 4 (31), and sequences that attenuate translation initiation, such as the 5\u2032 UTR of Brome mosaic virus RNA 2 (56).",

A ubiquitous example is the poly(A) tail, which is required for efficient translation initiation (20, 77) . Thus, while the basic scanning model still holds (60) , regulation by the 3\u2032 UTR requires additional mechanisms to explain how the ribosome is recruited to the mRNA. Long-distance interactions between the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 ends are probably essential for efficient translation of all eukaryotic mRNAs (68) including viral RNAs (18) . With no known exceptions, all plant-encoded mRNAs contain a 5\u2032 cap (m 7 GpppN), and a 3\u2032 poly(A) tail. These moieties act synergistically to stimulate translation of mRNAs (20) because they play key roles in formation of the mRNA initiation complex that recruits the ribosome (26) . The poly(A) tail attracts poly(A)-binding protein (PABP), the 5\u2032 cap binds eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF) 4E, and both cap-bound eIF4E and poly(A)-bound PABP simultaneously bind the large scaffolding protein, eIF4G (30, 40, 64) . This circularizes the mRNA via a multiprotein bridge (24, 86) and results in recruitment of the 40S ribosomal subunit via eIF3, by a mechanism that is still being worked out (10, 72) .",

            "text": "Unlike all known plant cellular mRNAs, many plant viral RNAs lack a 5\u2032 cap and/or a poly (A) tail, yet they are translated efficiently (21, 36) . Thus, they must harbor sequences that functionally replace a cap and poly(A) tail ( Figure 1 ). RNAs of many positive-strand viruses have internal ribosome entry sites (IRESes) in their 5\u2032 UTRs that guide ribosomes directly to initiation sites (29) . The 5\u2032 UTRs of viruses in the largest plant virus family, the Potyviridae, have modest IRES activity (55, 96) . In contrast, the viruses discussed here represent the only mRNAs known in any eukaryote to harbor cap-independent translation elements in the 3\u2032 UTR. We place these 3\u2032 cap-independent translation elements into at least three classes, listed in order of their discovery (36) Figure 1a ) and in the Dianthovirus and Necrovirus genera of the Tombusviridae, and (iii) the Tomato bushy stunt virus (TBSV) cap-independent translation element (CITE) found in the genus Tombusvirus and probably other genera of the Tombusviridae. A fourth type of 3\u2032 element may exist in the 3\u2032 UTR of Maize necrotic streak virus (MNeSV) (70) . The sequences and secondary structures of these elements bear no obvious resemblance to each other ( Figure  2 ), but the TED and BTE behave very similarly, conferring strong stimulation of capindependent translation in vitro and in vivo. In contrast, the CITE-mediated cap-independent translation is detectable only in vivo (93) . However, a feature that they all share, and which is relevant to this review, is the presence of short sequence tracts known or predicted to base-pair to the 5\u2032 UTR that mediate translation initiation at the 5\u2032-proximal AUG on the viral mRNAs.",

The TED is necessary for cap-independent translation initiation at the 5\u2032 proximal AUG on the mRNA. This translation also requires 38 bases of the 5\u2032 UTR. The TED element is predicted to form a long, rather loose, bulged stem-loop structure (Figure 2a) . A different sequence of approximately 100 nt (BTE) in the 5\u2032 end of the 869-nt 3\u2032 UTR of BYDV confers cap-independent translation at the 5\u2032 proximal AUG of the genome (84) and sg RNA1 (83) (Figure 1a ). BYDV-like TEs are distinguished by a conserved motif, GGAUCCUGGGAAACAGG, which forms a short stem-loop by pairing of the underlined bases.

Five bases of stem-loop III (SL-III) of the BTE were predicted to pair to 5\u2032 bases in stem-loop D (SL-D) of the BYDV 5\u2032 UTR (Figure 2b) . A point mutation in the middle base of either of these loops reduced translation 5-to 10-fold in vitro and > 100-fold in vivo. When both mutations were combined to restore complementarity, translation was increased many-fold compared to the mutants, although not to wild-type levels (28) . The sequence of the helix of the kissing stem-loop in the 5\u2032 UTR is not important for the interaction. However, with regard to the kissing loop bases, simple basepairing may not be sufficient because not all compensating mutations expected to form kissing loops between SLIII and SL-D are able to facilitate translation (A. Rakotondrafara, personal communication). Sequences on either side of the BTE including the extended portion of stem-IV of the BTE (Figure 2b ) comprise the promoter for sg RNA2 synthesis (38; J. Jackson, personal communication). Thus, like the TBSV DI RNA, the translation element is flanked by RNA synthesis-regulating elements.",

Studies with chimeric mRNAs support the need for base-pairing between the 3\u2032 BTE and the 5\u2032 UTR of TNV-D to effect cap-independent translation. The SL-III of the TNV-D BTE is not complementary to SL-D of BYDV to which SL-III of the BYDV BTE base-pairs, but an mRNA containing the BYDV 5\u2032 UTR and TNV-D 3\u2032 UTR allowed substantial capindependent translation. This is because the TNV-D BTE is complementary to SL-A (the 5\u2032proximal stem-loop) of the BYDV 5\u2032 UTR, which has the same sequence as the TNV-D 5\u2032proximal stem-loop (71) . Additionally, the Meulewaeter laboratory reported that the 3\u2032 BTE of BYDV could pair with the 5\u2032 UTR of TNV-A sg RNA2 to facilitate translation, although the predicted pairing appears rather weak (46) . In both cases, constructs for which no basepairing between UTRs was predicted translated very poorly. These data strengthen the concept that the TNV BTEs require this form of communication.",

Like the BYDV BTE, 3\u2032 TE-DR1 confers substantial translation in vivo, and in its absence no translation is detected unless a 5\u2032 cap is added, which restores translation fully. Unlike the BYDV BTE, 3\u2032 TE-DR1 contains a total of five stem-loops ( Figure 2b) . Also, the authors reported that basepairing to the 5\u2032 UTR was unnecessary for translation in vitro, but Fabian & White (19) predicted that one of the stem-loops in the 3\u2032 TE-DR1 can potentially form a kissing stem-loop interaction with stem-loops in the 5\u2032 UTRs of both genomic RNA1 and sg RNA1, that arises from genomic RNA1 (Figure 2b ). Given the striking conservation of predicted base-pairing between known or predicted 3\u2032 cap-independent translation elements throughout the Tombusviridae family, and given the requirement of the BYDV element for base-pairing, it is likely that the BYDV-like elements in the dianthoviruses also must base-pair to the 5\u2032 UTR.",

Translation of p33 from this \"reporter\" mRNA was revealed indirectly by the accumulation of a coinoculated defective interfering RNA (DI-72), the replication of which requires both TBSV replication proteins p33 and p92.

The 3\u2032 element of MNeSV also differs from the TBSV CITE in that it strongly stimulates cap-independent translation in wheat germ extract (70) . The MNeSV 3\u2032 UTR bears no obvious resemblance to the above three classes of capindependent translation element, and thus may represent a fourth class of element.",

            "text": "Long-distance base-pairing can also control translational events that occur after initiation. Ribosomal frameshifting in the minus one (\u22121) direction (ribosomes change reading frames by slipping back one base relative to the initial ORF being translated) is required for translation of the polymerase genes of the luteoviruses, sobemoviruses, and dianthoviruses of plants, as well as most retroviruses (e.g., HIV) and all nidoviruses (e.g., SARS CoV) of animals (7) . Frameshifting is programmed by cis-acting signals that include the seven-base shifty site at which the ribosomes change frames. This is followed by a highly structured region, usually consisting of a pseudoknot located 5 to 6 nt downstream. The second loop of the pseudoknot can be quite large (8) . By far the most extreme case is BYDV RNA, in which a stem-loop located 4 kb downstream of the frameshift site base-pairs with a bulge in the stem-loop adjacent to the frameshift site ( Figure 1a ). This kissing interaction is necessary for frameshifting (4) . How this structure brings about the ribosomal frameshift remains unknown, but frameshifter pseudo-knots may interact with the ribosome in a way that transiently blocks the ribosomal helicase from melting secondary structure, causing a pause in ribosome movement to allow the -1 frameshift (76) . RCNMV RNA has a shifty site and bulged stem-loop very similar to that of BYDV (35) , but there is no evidence that the latter requires base-pairing to a downstream sequence for frameshifting. The long-distance kissing interaction is predicted in the frameshift signals of all other viruses in the Luteovirus genus (4) but not in any other virus genus. However, the effects of such long-distance sequences on frameshifting, or even their potential presence, may not have been examined for many viruses.",

This allows expression of a C-terminal extension to the coat protein that is required for aphid transmission (6, 12) . Unlike frameshifting, many different types of cis-acting signals can cause in-frame readthrough of stop codons. For example, the consensus sequence CARYYA, following the TMV p126 ORF stop codon (R = purine, Y = pyrimidine), allows about 5% of ribosomes to read through and continue translating the p183 ORF that encodes the TMV RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (54, 74) . In contrast, the readthrough domain of the luteovirus coat protein gene requires a [CCXXXX] 8 motif beginning about 20 nt downstream of the stop codon and another sequence located about 700 to 750 nt downstream (9) (Figure 1a ). In artificial constructs this distal element can function when moved two kilobases downstream into the untranslated region beyond the readthrough ORF (9) . Although some sequence complementarity between this region and the sequence near the readthrough site is present in BYDV RNA, it remains to be determined whether this base-pairing occurs.",

Instead, by using this 3\u2032-positioning strategy only one copy of the 3\u2032 TE is necessary that functions with simple complementary adapter sequences in the 5\u2032 UTR of each sg mRNA (e.g., Figure 1a ).",

This 3\u2032-5\u2032 communication may prevent nonproductive collisions between ribosomes translating the genome and viral replicase molecules copying the same RNA molecule (4). The first event upon uncoating of positive-strand viral RNA is translation of the viral replicase. As the replicase protein accumulates, it recognizes the 3\u2032 end and begins synthesizing negative strand while moving in the 5\u2032 direction on the genomic RNA template. Gamarnik & Andino (22) showed that on poliovirus RNA, no negative-strand synthesis could occur in the presence of translating ribosomes on the same RNA. During replication of viral RNAs with 3\u2032 TEs, as the 5\u2032-moving replicase copies the 3\u2032 TE, the replicase would disrupt the element's structure and its ability to base-pair to the 5\u2032 end ( Figure 3 ). This in turn would shut off translation and free the upstream portion of the genome of ribosomes, hence allowing synthesis of full-length negative strand. The negative strand would in turn serve as template for synthesis of positive strands that could eventually outnumber replicase molecules, and thus be available for translation, and the cycle would repeat (4). This provides an elegant feedback mechanism to assure a productive balance of translation and RNA synthesis ( Figure 3 ).",

RIV contains the core promoter for negative-strand synthesis and an intradomain interaction between the 3\u2032 terminal 5 nts (that is part of the core promoter) and a complementary sequence (termed silencer) located in an internal loop of a 5\u2032-proximal stem-loop (SL) structure is required for DI RNA replication (62) (Figure 4 ). In vitro, formation of this interaction (that spans ~ 50 nts) results in downregulation of viral RdRp-mediated negative-strand synthesis. Conversely, the disruption of the interaction caused increased levels of transcription, and these results led to the proposal that the interaction is important for regulating minus-strand synthesis by controlling access to the 3\u2032-terminal initiation site. This interaction is also important in vivo for detectable accumulation of DI RNA, supporting its function in the viral RNA replication process. Similar 3\u2032 end-silencer interactions have been identified in a variety of genera in Tombusviridae, and in luteoviruses, underscoring the importance and prevalence of this type of structure in viral RNA replication (37, 53, 99) .",

This region of the DI RNA corresponds to the 5\u2032 UTR of the TBSV genome, and it folds into discrete and functional domains. The 5\u2032-proximal T-shaped domain (TSD) (65, 92) is separated from the 3\u2032-proximal downstream domain (DSD) by a stable hairpin structure. A base-pairing interaction (termed PK-TD1) between the TSD and DSD (that spans ~ 100 nts) is required for optimal replication of the DI RNA ( Figure 4 ). The precise role of this interaction remains to be determined. Formation of the TSD-DSD complex appears to be an elementary feature of RNA replication because similar functional complexes are also present in tombusvirus satellite (Sat) RNAs (13), albeit traversing a significantly larger segment of RNA (spanning 137 nts). This bridge colocalizes the TSD and DSD in the sat RNA, thereby allowing formation of the necessary interdomain interaction, PK-TD1 (13) (Figure 4 ).",

The terminal element is complementary to both sg mRNA elements. Efficient positive-strand synthesis of the genome required base-pairing, in the full-length genomic minus strand, between the 3\u2032-terminal and the sg mRNA proximal elements (34) . Disrupting the ability of the 3\u2032-terminal element to base-pair with one sg mRNA element did not significantly affect synthesis of the plus-strand genome.

The required RNA-RNA interaction occurs in trans and involves the loop portion of a stem-loop in RNA2 (termed trans-activator or TA) base-pairing with a complementary sequence in RNA1 (termed TA binding site or TABS) located just upstream from the initiation site for sg mRNA transcription. It was proposed that this interaction acts as an RNA barricade that blocks progression of the viral RdRp during negative-strand synthesis of RNA1, thereby generating 3\u2032-truncated templates for sg mRNA transcription ( Figure 5 ).",

            "text": "Additional support for the PT model comes from the analyses of TBSV in which similar types of base-pairing interactions are necessary for transcription of its two sg mRNAs (15, 42) . Like RCNMV, the interactions occur in the positive strand; however, for TBSV they occur in cis. The so-called activator sequences (AS1 and AS2) involved in the interaction are located in the terminal loops of SL structures positioned in tandem in the coding region of p92 ( Figure 5 ). Their partner receptor sequences (RS1 and RS2) are located just upstream from the initiation sites of sg mRNA1 and 2, respectively. The AS1/RS1 interaction spans a distance of approximately 1 kb while the AS2/RS2 interaction traverses about 2 kb. In both cases, interaction of an AS with its partner RS is necessary for transcription of the associated sg mRNA. An additional long-distance interaction spanning over 1 kb and involving sequences that are distal (DE) and proximal (CE) to the sg mRNA2 initiation site is also required for sg mRNA2 transcription (14,98) ( Figure 5 ). The DE/CE interaction serves to colocalize AS2 and RS2. Thus, at least three long-distance interactions are required for transcription of the two sg mRNAs generated by TBSV. The requirement for all of these interactions in the positive strand, the positions of the AS/RS interactions just 5\u2032 to the sg mRNA initiation sites, the ability to uncouple negative-strand sg mRNA synthesis from plus sg mRNA production, and the fact that the sequence 3\u2032 to the AS/RS interactions can act as plus-strand promoters all support the proposal that TBSV sg mRNAs are generated by a PT mechanism (42, 90) .",

Unlike for RCNMV, analysis of TBSV did not detect any transactivity between corresponding elements (15) . One possibility regarding the origin of these elements (i.e., AS and RS) is that they originally resided in separate RNAs in a multisegment genome (i.e., similar to the arrangement in RCNMV) but, following a recombination event between genomic segments, both were united in a single RNA. If the original utility of the interaction was retained, then the virus would continue to the system in its new single-molecule context. Another possible reason for maintaining long-distance cis-acting interactions may be that they are simply superior to corresponding local elements. There may be some validity to this concept as replacement of long-distance interactions with local hairpin structures in TBSV still allowed for sg mRNA transcription; however, the localized hairpin elements were less effective at activating sg mRNA transcription (42) . Thus, the long-distance interactions may have been selected for and maintained over time because of their superior ability to activate sg mRNA transcription.",

We predict that long-distance base-pairing interactions are far more widespread than is currently appreciated. Given the fact that as few as four base pairs can bridge a genome-size loop for translation (71) , it is possible that such tracts of complementarity with a role in gene expression or replication are common. The challenge, of course, is in identifying those interactions that really do take place. This also prompts the intriguing questions of how short complementary sequences are able to find each other, interact stably enough to perform their function, and how base-pairing to the wrong site is avoided. It is likely that non-Watson-Crick interactions by neighboring bases enhance the kissing-loop interaction, as has been demonstrated for kissing stem-loops that dimerize HIV RNA (52) . Indeed, kissing stem-loops are known to base-pair with higher stability than simple linear oligomers of the same sequence (85) . Non-Watson-Crick interactions and/or protein-mediated stabilization may also explain how small basepairing interactions (6-7 bps) are able to cause the viral RdRp to terminate transcription in sg mRNA synthesis of Tombusviridae. Further detailed analysis of the RNA complexes involved will help to unravel this paradox.",
