This correlated with an increased antiviral effect of IFN-\u03b3 against the replication of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) replication in vitro. We also observed that a regulatory protein, Protein Inhibitor of NOS-1 (PIN) was down-regulated by IFN-\u03b3 treatment, and more ubiquitinated PIN accumulated in IFN-\u03b3 treated neurons. In cells of the reticuloendothelial system, IFN-\u03b3 treatment induces the expression of a set of low molecular weight MHC-encoded proteins (LMPs), which replace the \u03b2 -subunit of the proteasome complex during the proteasome neosynthesis, resulting in a complex termed the immunoproteasome. LMP-2,-7, and -10 were induced and the immunoproteasome was generated by IFN-\u03b3 treatment in neuronal cells. Importantly, we observed that IFN-\u03b3 induced inhibition of VSV protein synthesis was not dependent on ubiquitination.",

Previous studies indicated that treatment of neurons with prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2 ), an inhibitor of NOS-1 activity, induces PIN expression in neurons. Conversely, pharmacologic inhibition of cyclooxygenase-2 in vitro and in mice enhances NOS-1 activity, down-regulates PIN expression, and enhances clearance of virus and survival (Chen and Reiss, 2002) .",

GA reduces proteasomemediated antigen presention through inhibition of Hsp90 (Imai et al, 2003) . In order to determine the optimal concentration of inhibitors to be used in our studies, neuronal cells were treated with a range of doses of inhibitors. The MTS assay was used to measure mitochondrial activity as a surrogate for cell viability following LC or GA treatment ( Fig 1A) . The suppression of proteasome activity by the two inhibitors was confirmed by an assay of proteasome cleavage of Z-GGL-pNA ( Fig 1B) . Treatment of cells with LC or GA alone results in inhibition of VSV replication in NB41A3 cells (Figure 2A ). When we combined the two drugs, viral replication was almost totally eliminated. In IFN-\u03b3-treated NB41A3 cells, treated with LC or GA, the antiviral effect of IFN-\u03b3 was enhanced.",

We treated NB41A3 neuroblatoma cells for 48 hours with IFN-\u03b3 to allow accumulation of NO 2 \u2212 in the media.

In all related experiments, double treatment of IFN-\u03b3 and LC provide us the information of how IFN-\u03b3 effects the cell when proteasome activity was blocked. As expected, the mRNA level of NOS-1 is unaltered by IFN-\u03b3 or LC treatment ( Figure 3A ). Similar results were observed at earlier time points (3h, 12h; data not shown).

Figure 5A shows the induction of LMP2 mRNA expression and LMP7 protein by IFN-\u03b3 in NB41A3 cells. Similar results were observed in all three immunosubunits LMP2, LMP7 and LMP10. Untreated cells show no or extremely low levels of LMP expression while IFN-\u03b3 induced their expression at both mRNA and protein levels significantly. The mRNA induction was rapid and can be observed within 3 hours of IFN-\u03b3 treatment (data not shown). All three components display maximumal induction of expression at about 24 hours treatment. To confirm the immunosubunits are incorporated into the immunoproteasome, we isolated and immunoprecipitated the proteasome/immunoproteasome 20S complex from IFN-\u03b3treated and untreated NB41A3 cells and used Western blot to detect the incorporation of the three immunosubunits. Figure 5B indicates that immunosubunits are found as components of the proteasomes isolated from IFN-\u03b3-treated samples. The constitutive subunit \u03b1 5 was consistent in all samples. Similar observations were made using primary cultured neurons (not shown).",

Our examination of ubiquitinated VSV proteins in neurons showed only M protein is significantly ubiquitinated and the amount of Ub-M was unchanged by IFN-\u03b3 treatment. Thus ubiquitin does not appear to contribute to the more rapid degradation of VSV proteins in IFN-\u03b3-treated infected neurons.

IP negative control (a sample with no antibody for IP step) was included. Each sample was loaded in duplicate. Results are representative of 3 independent experiments. E IFN-\u03b3 treatment results in prolonged half life of NOS-1. NB41A3 cells treated with IFN-\u03b3 (24h) or LC (3h) were metabolically labeled with [ 35 S]methionine/[ 35 S]cysteine mix for 2 hours and chased for the indicated times. Same treatment (IFN-\u03b3 or LC) was present throughout the experiment. The cells were lysed and equal amount of lysates was used for each chase time. NOS-1 was analyzed by immunoprecipitation with anti-NOS-1 antibody and SDS-PAGE. The gel was exposed and the radioactivity was quantified. The values are the mean \u00b1 S.E. of three independent experiments. were quantitated and the amount of ubiquitinated M was normalized by total amount of \u03b2tubulin.

NB41A3 cells were treated with LC and/or GA at indicated concentration and time. Cells were lysed and same amount of lysates from each sample were used to measure proteasome activity. Results are mean of triplicate samples. 2A. IFN-\u03b3 and proteasome inhibitors antagonize VSV replication in NB41A3 cells NB41A3 cells were incubated with or without IFN-\u03b3 for 24 hours; Lactacysin (10\u03bcM) or Geldanamycin (5\u03bcM) or both were added 3 hours prior to infection with VSV at M.O.I=0.1. At 7 hours post infection, supernatants were harvested, and viral titers were determined by plaque assay. Viral titers presented are geometric mean titers from triplicate samples of each treatment. Data are representative of two experiments with similar results. B Lactacystin, IFN\u03b3, or both treatments induce NO production in NB41A3 cells. NB41A3 cells were treated with LC (3\u03bc M, 24hours), IFN-\u03b3 (20ng/ml, 48hours) or both. Supernatants were collected and a Griess assay was performed to measure the production of NO. Each sample was measured in triplicate. Results are representative of 3 independent experiments with similar trend. (*p<0.01)Fig 3. Lactacystin or IFN-\u03b3 treatments induce NOS-1 expression posttranscriptionally with ubiquitination of NOS-1 unchangedA, Lactacystin or IFN-\u03b3 treatment does not alter NOS-1 mRNA levels in NB41A3 cells. NB41A3 cells were treated in triplicate for 24 h with medium, LC, IFN-\u03b3 or both. Total RNA was isolated and NOS-1 mRNA levels were determined by RT-PCR. The relative densities of bands were measured, and differences between reactions were normalized by \u03b2 -actin levels. Data are represented as means +/\u2212 SEM; B, Lactacystin, IFN-\u03b3, or both treatments induce NOS-1 expression in NB41A3 cells. NB41A3 cells were treated with LC, IFN-\u03b3 or both for 24 hours. Total protein was collected and expression of NOS-1 and \u03b2 -actin was measured by Western blot using anti-NOS-1 mAb and anti-\u03b2 -actin mAb. C, Lactacystin or IFN-\u03b3 treatmentFig 4.PIN is posttranscriptionally down-regulated by IFN-\u03b3 and more ubiquitinated PIN is found in IFN-\u03b3 treated neuronal cellsA, Treatment of neurons with IFN-\u03b3 does not alter PIN mRNA level. Total RNA was isolated from NB41A3 cells treated with IFN-\u03b3 for 0, 24, 48 or 72 hours. RT-PCR was performed. 100 ng of total RNA was used for each reaction. Product sizes are as follows: PIN-390bp; \u03b2actin-540bp. Each sample was amplified in duplicate. Results are representative of 3 independent experiments. (*p>0.05) B,Treatment of neurons with IFN-\u03b3 downregulates PIN protein level. Whole cell lysate was isolated from NB41A3 cells treated with IFN-\u03b3 for 0h, 24h, 48h or 72hours. The PIN protein level was determined by Western blot and normalized by \u03b2 -actin. Results are representative of 3 independent experiments. (*p<0.05). C, More ubiquitinated PIN was found in IFN-\u03b3 treated neurons. Whole cell lysates were isolated from NB41A3 cells treated with LC or IFN-\u03b3 or both. Ubiquitin conjugated proteins were precipitated using anti-ubiquitin pAb and blotted with anti-PIN mAb. D, IFN-\u03b3 treatment reduces half-life of PIN.
