Some of its tissues, such as the lens, do not lend themselves well to pathologic techniques. Some focal lesions, especially of the posterior segment, may be readily visible and magnified with the ophthalmoscope but difficult to locate histologically. The reluctance of many pathologists to embrace ophthalmic pathology stems from the disappointing quality of sections made from formalin-fixed globes processed by routine methods, and from unfamiliarity with the complex terminology shared by clinical ophthalmologists and ophthalmic pathologists. At least equally daunting is the need to be familiar with the ever-growing list of inherited disorders that occur in purebred dogs, the species which indisputably dominates veterinary ophthalmology. In many instances, the correct diagnosis requires the correlation of the structural lesion with the age, breed, and specific clinical features of the disease to a much greater degree than is the case with most other body systems.",

Even with a globe obtained within minutes of death or surgical removal, improper handling of the specimen frequently results in a section of poor quality. The globe can be speedily and gently removed by grasping the third eyelid with forceps and applying traction to the globe while making a circumferential incision at the fornix. Blunt curved scissors inserted through this incision may be used to sever extraocular muscles and optic nerve, and allow the globe to be removed from the orbit. All orbital fat and extraocular muscles should be gently removed from the sclera to permit rapid penetration, of fixative to the retina.",

Formalin has the advantage of ready availability, little danger of overfixation, and adequate preservation of color and macroscopic detail for photography. Also, it permits localization in the bisected globe of lesions identified ophthalmoscopically, and the use of electron microscopy should such examination be warranted by the findings of light microscopy. However, formalin penetrates the sclera slowly, and there are postmortem changes, including retinal detachment, even in globes fixed immediately after death or surgery. Rapid-acting fixatives such as Zenker's, Helly's or Bouin's are preferred for globes in which preservation of histologic detail is paramount. All render the globe and its refractive media opaque and less suitable for macroscopic photography than does formalin. All require strict attention to the duration of fixation and thorough postfixation washing in water (Zenker's, Helly's) or 70% ethanol (Bouin's). Regardless of the method of fixation, all eyes benefit from hardening in 70% ethanol over about 24 hr to prevent retinal detachment when trimming the globe for embedding. A mixture of equal parts cold 4% buffered glutaraldehyde and 10% neutral formalin has been recommended as an ocular fixative for both light and electron microscopy.",

At the anterior edge of the optic cup, successive waves of mesenchymal invasion form corneal endothelium, corneal stroma, and the anterior half of the transient perilenticular vascular network. The posterior half is formed by invasion of vasoformative mesoderm and mesenchyme through the embryonic fissure to form the extensive hyaloid artery system ( Fig. 4 .1).

Retinal dysplasia is common in dogs and in cattle, and results from failure of proper apposition of the two layers of the optic cup, from failure of proper induction by an inherently defective retinal pigment epithelium, or from necrosis of the developing retina. Regardless of pathogenesis, the dysplastic retina is characterized by retinal folds, retinal rosettes, patchy to diffuse blending of nuclear layers, loss of retinal cells, and glial scars. The folds and rosettes are the histologic counterparts of the vermiform streaks seen on the fundus with the ophthalmoscope. The hallmark of retinal dysplasia is the rosette, composed of a central lumen surrounded by one to three layers of neuroblasts. The three-layered rosette is the most common in naturally occurring cases in animals, and shows more or less complete retinal differentiation. Most such rosettes are probably retinal folds cut transversely. The lumen contains pink fibrils resembling photoreceptors and is bounded by a thin membrane resembling the normal outer limiting membrane. One-and two-layered rosettes are encountered infrequently and consist of a lumen surrounded by undifferentiated neuroblasts.",

In English springer spaniels, in which this type of dysplasia has been most extensively studied, changes are seen as early as gestational day 45 and always by day 55. Focal infolding of the neuroblastic layer away from the retinal pigment epithelium and focal loss of the junctions between the neuroblasts (the outer limiting membrane) are the early changes, followed by overt focal retinal separation and extensive retinal folding. In all breeds in which this type of dysplasia has been adequately studied, it is inherited as a simple autosomal trait.

They migrate into the stroma and control bacterial contamination, degrade damaged collagen, and stimulate both fibroplasia and vascularization via production of various cytokines, especially basic fibroblast growth factor. Repair of the stroma is invariably by fibroplasia and never restores the stroma to complete normalcy. Viable stromal cells (keratocytes) adjacent to the wound undergo fibroblastic metaplasia and secrete large a m o u n t s of sulfated ground substance, particularly chondroitin sulfate.

The lesion refuses to heal, or repeatedly reulcerates, because of poor adhesion of the epithelium to the underlying stroma or basal lamina. The defect appears not to be in epithelial healing per se, since sliding and mitotic activity are normal in affected dogs. Keratectomy specimens reveal poorly adherent hyperplastic epithelium at the ulcer margins, usually with multiple clefts separating epithelium from stroma even in areas distant from the obvious ulcer. The basal lamina is usually not visible with light microscopy, and the epithelium appears to be attempting to adhere to a thin zone of hypocellular, pale-staining stroma. The observation of pyknotic and lytic keratocyte nuclei within this superficial zone suggests that the basic defect is degeneration of the superficial stroma, so that epithelial hemidesmosomes and anchoring collagen fibrils have no firm anchor.

This lesion, also called corneal mummification or corneal nigrum, is initially seen as a central, nonulcerated brown focus in one or both corneas of cats of any age or breed. Persian and Siamese cats are more frequently affected than are other b r e e d s . Histologically, the lesion is bland corneal epithelial desiccation that may be mistaken as artefact. The stroma is hyalinized, featureless, and orange-brown. In older lesions the d e e p margin of the focus may be marked by a zone of reactive mononuclear leukocytes and, p e r h a p s , a few giant cells. T h e epithelium is usually absent over the central portion of the biopsy specimen, because lesions have usually ulcerated by the time keratectomy is done. T h e nature of the pigment and the pathogenesis of this unique disease are u n k n o w n . T h e sequestrum may eventually slough, and the defect heals by granulation, although most lesions are treated by excision before that stage is reached. Purely epithelial keratitis is rarely encountered in histologic preparations, because the clinical lesion either is transient and progresses to ulceration (as in acute keratoconjunctivitis sicca) or is so mild that eyes are unavailable for histologic examination. Superficial punctate keratitis is, in fact, noninflammatory and consists of multiple fine epithelial opacities that are probably foci of epithelial hydropic change. Intercellular fluid accumulation (bullous keratopathy) is seen as a sequel to corneal edema.",

Acquired immunity alters the manifestations of the disease and results in different lesions predominating in different age groups. Keratitis is commonest in adult cats and seems to result from activation of latent infection during concurrent immunosuppressive disease or corticosteroid therapy. Concurrent mild respiratory disease may be present. In contrast, the infection in adolescent cats causes a nonspecific bilateral erosive conjunctivitis without keratitis. Intranuclear inclusions are numerous within cells prior to sloughing, and leukocytes are sparse until ulceration permits opportunistic contamination. Upper respiratory disease is almost always present and is typically more severe than that in adults. In adult cats the disease is often unilateral and primarily corneal. It probably reflects recrudescence of latent infection. The typical corneal lesions are multifocal minute corneal erosions and ulcers which have a tendency to coalesce into branching dendritic ulcers. Severe or recurrent lesions in immunosuppressed cats may result in underlying stromal keratitis with lymphocytic infiltration, persistent edema, and vascularization.

Progression to complete cortical opacity usually occurs within a few weeks. The pathogenesis of the cataract has traditionally been ascribed to the excessively high level of glucose within the aqueous. Glucose is normally the major energy source for lens fibers, with most of it used to fuel the Embden-Meyerhof pathway of anaerobic glycolysis. When the rate-limiting enzyme of this pathway, hexokinase, is saturated with glucose, the back-up of glucose is shunted to alternative metabolic pathways. Chief among these is the sorbitol pathway, activated in the rabbit lens by glucose concentrations of greater than 90 mg/dl. In this pathway, the excess glucose is converted by an aldose reductase to the polyalcohol, sorbitol, which is then slowly reduced to a ketose. Because this second reaction is much slower than the first, sorbitol may accumulate to very high concentrations within the lens, and osmotically attracts water even to the point of hydropic cell rupture. Under experimental conditions at least, the early cataract may be reversed if aqueous sugar levels are reduced to normal, but the later cataract is irreversible.",

The lens, deficient in the enzymes to utilize the galactose by converting it to glucose-6-phosphate for anaerobic glycolysis, shunts the galactose via aldose reductase to its poly alcohol, dulcitol, which acts osmotically as does sorbitol to disrupt lens fibers. Cataract reported in puppies and wolf cubs fed commercial milk replacer, or in kittens on feline milk replacer, has been attributed to deficiency of arginine, although in several case reports the specific dietary error was not identified.

In long-standing cases (which are most likely to receive histologic examination), the aggregates may be very large and resemble lymphoid follicles (Fig. 4.31) .

            "text": "The microscopic lesions depend on the stage of the disease and represent a continuum from anterior uveitis to endophthalmitis with retinal scarring, or even phthisis bulbi. The earliest lesion is anterior uveal inflammation that is transiently neutrophilic but rapidly becomes predominantly lymphocytic. Ciliary processes are most obviously affected. Edema, fibrin, and leukocytes distend the stroma, and PAS-positive hyaline material obscures the nonpigmented epithelium ( Fig. 4.33) . Leukocytes and fibrin lie in the anterior chamber and in the filtration angle. In the eyes of horses with a history of several attacks of uveitis, the exudate in active phases of the disease is almost purely lymphocytic-plasmacytic and is found about vessels of choroid, retina, and optic nerve as well as anterior uvea (Fig. 4.34A ). Peripheral corneal vascularization, both from conjunctival and limbic ciliary vessels, becomes increasingly prominent and extends farther toward the center of the cornea (Fig. 4.34B) . Edema accompanies the newly formed vessels. The chorioretinitis may be sufficiently exudative to cause multifocal retinal separation. As these severe uveal lesions regress during clinically quiescent periods, they leave behind characteristic residual changes. Relatively early in the disease there is the development of perivascular lymphoid aggregates in iris and ciliary body, which persist and may even form true lymphoid nodules (Fig. 4.34C,D) . The ciliary processes may remain thickened by fibrous organization of stromal edema, and a hyaline membrane often seems to cover the ciliary epithelium. This material, in fact, lies within the apical cytoplasm of the nonpigmented ciliary epithelium and may be the histologic counterpart of crystalline protein inclusions seen in this epithelium ultrastructurally. Small blood vessels persist along corneal stromal lamellae, and there is subtle fibrous disorganization of the stroma, the result of previous edema. Peripapillary chorioretinal scarring is seen as focal retinal photoreceptor loss, jumbling of layers, and gliosis. Adjacent retinal pigment epithelium may be hypertrophic or hyperplastic, and a focal cluster of lymphocytes in the nearby choroid is common.",

The role of toxoplasmosis in feline anterior uveitis is controversial. Retrospective histologic studies list the majority of such cases as idiopathic and are presumed to be immune mediated, with antigen or antigens unknown. In the several large published studies, there has not been a single case confirmed by observation of merozoites or cysts in the eye; even serologic evidence in these studies pointed to toxoplasmosis in only 1-2% of cases. In contrast, one study reported evidence of anterior uveal production of toxoplasma-specific antibody in 32 of 69 cats with anterior uveitis, and another report confirmed that anterior uveitis is indeed the most frequent manifestation of toxoplasmosis in cats, seen in 60% of cats with confirmed toxoplasmosis. Nonetheless, evidence remains less than conclusive about the role of T. gondii in the prevalent and enigmatic syndrome of anterior uveitis in this species. It may be that the local production of Toxoplasma antibody in cats with uveitis is merely the result of nonspecific recruitment of Toxoplasma-sensitized lymphocytes into the chronically inflamed uvea, and that lymphoid aggregates in such eyes are producing a whole range of antibody quite irrelevant to the original cause of the uveitis.",

Although theoretically primary glaucoma may have no visible angle lesion (which is frequently the case in humans), in dogs there is almost always a readily detected maldevelopment. The one exception is primary openangle glaucoma in beagle dogs, in which there is no visible antecedent lesion. The broad term goniodysgenesis encompasses all developmental defects of the filtration angle, of which two types account for most canine cases. The most prevalent is continuation of mature iris stroma across the trabecular m e s h w o r k to insert into the termination of D e s c e m e t s m e m b r a n e . Some consider this an ex-ample of dysplasia of pectinate ligament, and the term imperforate pectinate ligament is widely used.

T h e defect, and the resultant glaucoma, are occasionally seen in mixed-breed dogs. T h e dysplasia is usually bilateral but not necessarily of equal extent, so that the glaucoma often is initially present only in one eye. T h e prevalence of the iridopectinate dysplasia is much higher than the prevalence of glaucoma, and even in dogs with very extensive dysplasia that should seemingly eliminate almost all aqueous drainage, the onset of glaucoma is not until several years of age.

Because the iris does not normally contact the cornea, anterior synechia by the last mechanism is frequent only as a consequence of corneal perforation, in which case the iris flows forward to seal the defect and may then adhere diffusely to the corneal endothelium ( Fig. 4.42A ). Other causes of secondary glaucoma include occlusion of the trabecular m e s h w o r k by preiridal fibrovascular m e m b r a n e , inflammatory debris, or tumor cells. L e n s luxation may precipitate glaucoma by allowing vitreous to occlude the pupil, by stimulating anterior uveitis, or by trapping iris against cornea. Rarely, lens swelling with cataract (intumescent cataract) seems to occlude the pupil. In small terrier dogs with an inherited tendency to luxation, there is an unusually high prevalence of glaucoma. Removal of lens prior to the onset of glauc o m a prevents the expected glaucoma, seemingly establishing the causal role of the luxation. Posterior synechiae may also occlude the pupil (particularly as part of phacoclastic uveitis), but posterior synechiae usually cause glaucoma via iris b o m b \u00e9 and thus a circumferential peripheral anterior synechia.",

The photoelectric stimulus originating in the photoreceptor outer segment is transmitted through the outer nuclear layer and along the axons of the photoreceptor nuclei to the bipolar and horizontal neurons of the inner nuclear layer. The accumulation of outer nuclear layer axons and inner nuclear layer dendrites forms the outer synaptic or plexiform layer. The inner nuclear layer contains the nuclei of the bipolar, horizontal, amacrine, and glial (M\u00fcller) cells. The bipolar cells receive impulses from the photoreceptors and relay them to ganglion cells. The bipolar cells also stimulate the horizontal cells, which transmit the impulse horizontally to excite adjacent bipolar cells. Amacrine cells counterbalance the bipolar cells in that their stimulation releases an inhibitor of ganglion cell excitation. The glial cells are primarily structural support cells, whose processes traverse the retina to form the retinal scaffold, and their anterior and posterior terminations fuse to form the inner and outer limiting membranes. The axons of the bipolar and amacrine cells, dendrites of ganglion and horizontal cells, and glial processes form the thick, inner synaptic or plexiform layer. The ganglion cell layer is the thinnest and innermost of the neuronal layers. Large, granular neurons form a single and often sparse layer, supplemented by a few astrocytes, that become bilayered in the area centralis to accommodate the marked increase in photoreceptor density. The density of ganglion cells predicts, in a general way, visual acuity. They are most closely packed in animals requiring fine visual discrimination (most birds, predatory fish, many reptiles). In contrast, they are sparse in ungulates, who do not feed by sight, but who flee at anything that moves. Their axons form the nerve fiber layer, which gradually increases in thickness toward the optic disk. In most animals, the fibers are not myelinated until they reach the optic disk.

The retinal vessels form an end-artery circulation which supplies the inner layers of the retina. The photoreceptors and outer nuclear layers are avascular and receive nutrients primarily by diffusion from choroid. Such dependence cannot be absolute (except in horses) because degeneration of these outer layers is surprisingly slow (weeks to months) following retinal separation. In contrast, occlusion of a retinal vessel results in focal infarction of the inner retina within less than 1 hour.",

Although no actual data are published, most animals with encephalitis d o not, in fact, have concurrent retinitis. Retinal inflammation is most often the result of spread from choroid or across the vitreous from anterior uvea. Degenerations are much more c o m m o n than inflammations and are not usually accompanied by inflammatory reaction. The mature mammalian retina has no capacity for regeneration of entire neural cells, although photoreceptor outer segments and glia may be replaced if destroyed in the course of degenerative or inflammatory disease. E v e n the fetal retina has poor regenerative capacity, as evidenced by the prevalence of retinal dysplasia following prenatal or neonatal retinal injury. Retinal repair is by proliferation of inner layer astrocytes, which eventually form a dense glial scar. Occasionally the astrocytes proliferate along the vitreal face of the retina, forming a preretinal fibroglial m e m b r a n e . Similar subretinal m e m b r a n e s are seen with chronic detachments and originate from retinal pigment epithelium or M\u00fcller cells. T h e retinal pigment epithelium retains mitotic ability.

T h e credibility of the diagnosis is greatly enhanced by the presence of subretinal exudates or cyclitic membranes ( Fig. 4.48 ), but in their absence, the diagnosis rests on the observation of photoreceptor outer segment loss of outer segments (probably the most subtle change that can be unequivocally diagnosed with routine light microscopy) visible by about 14 d a y s . Inner segments and the cell bodies of the outer nuclear layer are almost unaffected and may remain so for m o n t h s , suggesting that their maintenance is not so intimately linked to the pigment epithelium as is the case with the outer segments. This temporal hierarchy of change permits reasonably accurate aging of retinal separations, sometimes a necessary or at least interesting assessment in eyes enucleated after numerous clinical examinations or manipulation. T h e outer retinal lesions are apparently not ischemic, inasmuch as there is very little necrosis and no similarity to the lesion induced by retinal artery occlusion. Perhaps the outer layers can survive by diffusion of oxygen and nutrients from the subretinal fluid or from vascularized inner layers, and indeed the speed of photoreceptor atrophy varies with the height of the separation. An exception is seen in horses, inasmuch as the horse retina depends almost entirely on choroidal diffusion for oxygenation. Separation in this species results in rapid, full-thickness retinal infarction.

Arrested development is followed by degeneration of inner rod segments, so that there is diffuse loss of all rod photoreceptors by 12 w e e k s of age. This is followed by loss of cones and of outer nuclear layer. By the time the dog is about 1 year of age, there is diffuse atrophy of the outer nuclear layer, and the inner nuclear layer is in direct contact with the pigment epithelium. The inner retinal layers are unaffected. Dogs show visual deficits in dim light as early as 6 weeks of age and are usually blind by 1 year. The biochemical defect is a marked deficiency of the phosphodiesterase responsible for the continuous hydrolysis of cyclic guanine monophosphate within outer segments. While the function of the enzyme in this site is not fully understood, the resultant excess of cyclic guanine monophosphate (cGMP) is toxic to photoreceptors in vitro, and is known to cause arrested development or degeneration of rod outer segments in vivo. In the Irish setter, the substrate levels are about 10 times higher in affected than in control dogs, and the elevation precedes morphologic change in the photoreceptors.

The clinical and histologic ocular lesions are virtually identical and occur in a high percentage (80% for Rocky Mountain spotted fever) of dogs with active infection. Most of the lesions result from injury to vascular endothelium parasitized by the rickettsiae, and multifocal hemorrhage, edema, and vascular necrosis occur in all parts of the eye. Multifocal retinal hemorrhage, perivascular retinal edema, and necrosis of endothelium in retinal venules and arterioles are the characteristic retinal changes. Although often listed along with other agents as a cause of anterior uveitis or endophthalmitis, most naturally occurring infections have clinical signs attributable only to the vascular injury rather than a genuine uveal inflammation. There is one report of unusually severe uveitis occurring 14-28 days after experimental infection with Rickettsia rickettsii, following the disappearance of all other signs of the acute systemic disease. Dogs thus affected had a neutrophilic and lymphocytic destructive vasculitis, assumed to represent a type III immune reaction to parasitized endothelium. Barnett, K. C, and Palmer, A. C ",

The axons travel within a preformed neurectodermal tube formed by the primary optic stalk to reach the optic chiasm and then the lateral geniculate body. The neurectoderm lining the optic stalk induces the surrounding mesenchyme to form the three meningeal layers, similar to and continuous with those of brain itself. Later differentiation of neurectoderm produces the astrocytes and Oligodendroglia that, together with the ganglion cell, axons, and fibrovascular septa from pia mater, form the substance of the optic nerve. The optic disk is the intraocular portion of the nerve and is the only portion available to ophthalmoscopic examination. It is formed by the convergence of ganglion cell axons prior to their exit via the lamina cribrosa. The axons of the nerve fiber layer are unmyelinated, and at what point (relative to lamina cribrosa) the axons become myelinated determines the ophthalmoscopic appearance of the optic disk. Histologically, the disk is unmyelinated in most domestic species except the dog, contains abundant glia, and may have a small paracentral excavation-the physiologic cup-from which Bergmeister's papilla originates. A few pigmented cells are commonly seen, as are small neuroblastic clusters, both probably minor anomalies of retinal differentiation but of no significance.",

T h e neoplasm m a y originate from any portion of embryonic neurectoderm and may show differentiation into any neurectodermal derivative; retina, ciliary epithelium, vitreous, or neuroglia ( Fig.  4.68A,B) . T h e typical neoplasm is a loose network of branching cords of small basophilic neuroblasts resembling those of embryonic retina. Mitotic figures are numerous. T h e cords have definite polarity: they rest upon a basement m e m b r a n e analogous to the inner limiting membrane of retina, a n d some have adjoining apical terminal bars analogous to outer limiting m e m b r a n e . A typical feature is the clustering of neuroblasts around an empty central lumen defined by the terminal bars, creating a true rosette (Fig. 4.69) . T h e basilar portion of the rosette or cord faces a hyaluronic acid-rich myxoid matrix analogous to the vitreous. This histologic feature m a y be found in only a few foci within a huge mass that is otherwise composed of poorly differentiated, neuroblastlike cells, and has abundant necrosis. Many tumors also contain foci of cartilage, skeletal muscle, or brain tissue a n d a r e classified as teratoid medulloepitheliomas. Metastases a r e not recorded. injury, are prone to develop pleomorphic spindle cell sarcomas that destroy the globe and have substantial risk of metastasis. T h e interval between injury and observed tumor varies from 5 months to 11 years. Those skeptical about claiming such neoplasia to be the result of an injury 10 years previously prefer to call these tumors primary ocular sarcomas, although such lag times are c o m m o n in experimental models of carcinogenesis. The risk for injured eyes to develop sarcoma is u n k n o w n . Almost all recorded cases have perforated lenses, leading to speculation that these tumors represent malignant transformation of the perilenticular fibroplasia and epithelial metaplasia that characterizes phacoclastic uveitis in all species. Of relevance to ocular surgeons is the development of sarcomas in cat eyes receiving prosthetic implants, presumably viewed by the eye as yet another form of trauma.",

Staphylococcus spp., Pseudomonas spp., Proteus spp., and the yeast Malassezia pachydermatis (syn.

Histologically there is hyperplasia of the normally very large sebaceous glands and cystic hyperplasia of the coiled, tubular, apocrine ceruminous glands, which are distended by eosinophilic cerumen.

The pigmentary defect is not true albinism but is white spotting or merling, the distinction being the absence of melanocytes in white areas in the latter instance and functionally defective melanocytes in the former. In some instances the hearing defect is associated with inheritance of the merling gene. All homozygotes and many of the heterozygotes are deaf and have some degree of iris heterochromia. In other instances there is heterochromia iridis but no apparent coat color dilution (Dalmatian dogs), while in others, both eyes and coat are phenotypically normal. Even when the coat color is white, as in deaf bull terriers, the genetic basis for the white coat and the associated deafness need not be the merling gene. Out of this confusing picture one should rescue the concept that color-dilute animals have ocular heterochromia and deafness much more frequently than normal animals, but that other genetic bases for deafness also exist. Ocular anomalies and deafness commonly are encountered in the same animal, probably the result of the inductive influence of pigmentation on both organs. For example, all white cats with blue irises are deaf, as are many Dalmatian dogs with iris heterochromia. Several dog breeds, particularly Dalmatians and English setters, have a prevalence of early-onset deafness in excess of that predictable from their prevalence in the overall canine population. Prominent also are merle dogs such as Australian shepherds, Australian blue heelers, old English sheepdogs, and Great Danes.",

The osseous portion of the labyrinth is unaffected, as is the vestibular portion of the inner ear. With minor variations, all cases in dogs and cats are similar. Initial structure and function are normal, but there is failure to achieve normal maturation and, subsequently, degeneration occurs. The carnivore ear is completely developed at birth and continues to mature for 2 (organ of Corti) to 4 (stria vascularis) weeks. Thereafter, the epithelial lining of the cochlear duct is incapable of mitotic regeneration. In white kittens, the ear is morphologically and physiologically normal at birth but shows arrested development as early as 1 week of age. At this time there is inward sagging of the free dorsolateral wall of the cochlear duct (Reissner's membrane) and saccule, and hydropic change in the stria vascularis. The degeneration within the organ of Corti and adjacent nutritive stria vascularis is so rapid that there is no consensus as to the initial or causal lesion. It may be that degeneration of the stria vascularis results in ischemic degeneration of the avascular organ of Corti, or there may be a primary defect within the sensory cells themselves resulting from an inborn metabolic error.",

This phenomenon, called presbyacusis, is more frequently observed in old dogs because dogs tend to be kept well into their advanced years and because hearing loss is more readily noticed in them than in other species. In humans the loss of hearing is progressive from about the fortieth year of life and particularly affects hearing of high tones. The cause seems to be inherent age-related degeneration of the epithelial tissues within the cochlea and of the spiral ganglion, a process that may be accelerated by excessive noise, arteriosclerosis, and nutritional factors. The essential lesions are atrophy of all epithelial structures within the cochlear duct and the associated auditory nerves, as well as neuronal atrophy within the spiral ganglion. Occasionally, the major lesion is atrophy within the stria vascularis or the basal membrane supporting the organ of Corti.",

Clinical signs of vestibular dysfunction precede evidence of hearing impairment. The initial lesion affecting hearing is degeneration of the apical portion of cochlear hair cells.

The early lesion is reversible but later becomes permanent, presumably as mitochondrial swelling leads to structural disintegration of cellular respiratory enzymes and cell death.

Squamous cell carcinoma is by far the most important skin tumor affecting the ear, although the predilection of canine histiocytoma for the ear pinna probably makes it the most frequent tumor affecting the pinna. Squamous cell carcinoma of the ear occurs commonly in white cats, with a frequency more than 10 times that of non white cats, and in sheep in sunny climates. In cats, the tumor has a long precancerous phase consisting of erythematous, ulcerative dermatitis of the ear margin, known as feline solar or actinic dermatitis because of its association with exposure to sunlight. Other sparsely haired areas, such as nose, lips, and eyelids, may be affected. Histologically, the lesion consists of multifocal coalescing epidermal necrosis overlying a diffuse superficial dermal infiltrate of lymphocytes and plasma cells. The lesion waxes and wanes with the intensity of sunlight. Epidermal hyperpla-sia proceeds to dysplasia, carcinoma in situ, and invasive squamous cell carcinoma in a manner analogous to bovine ocular squamous cell carcimona. The lesion is bilateral but not necessarily of synchronous progression. The progression to invasive neoplasia usually occurs over 3 or 4 years. Metastasis is a late occurrence and prevented (at least in the case of ears) by amputation. Rarely, squamous cell carcinoma occurs within the external ear canal or even within the tympanic cavity of the middle ear. Local infiltration results in damage to the seventh cranial nerve with resultant signs of vestibular dysfunction and facial paralysis.",

Orbital fat fluctuates with nutritional status, contributing to the enophthalmos of malnourished animals. Ordinarily, however, orbital disease arises by extension of inflammatory lesions from the m o u t h , paranasal sinuses, or from penetrating w o u n d s through periorbital soft tissue. Extension from intraocular inflammation is surprisingly rare, a tribute to the barrier offered by the sclera. Conversely, orbital disease rarely invades the globe. Metastatic orbital neoplasia is rare except for l y m p h o m a of cattle and of cats. While theoretically the orbit m a y suffer from primary neoplasia of any of the bony or soft tissues within it, such occurrences are rare.

T h e y are almost invariably benign and closely resemble benign melanomas elsewhere in the skin. Melanomas arising in the conjunctiva are very infrequent c o m p a r e d to all other ocular melanomas.T h e few case reports do not allow for generalizations about behavior, but they often are histologically and behaviorally malignant. Their relationship to eyelid melanoma seems analogous to those of the lip, where melanomas of the haired exterior lip are benign like most skin m e l a n o m a s , and those of the m u c o u s m e m b r a n e of the inside of the lip are malignant like those elsewhere in the mouth. Conjunctival melanomas may appear as well-pigmented tumors of bland, plump melanocytes with little anisokaryosis or mitotic activity, but often are poorly melanotic and have invasive clusters of angular epithelioid cells with marked anisocytosis and n u m e r o u s mitotic figures. Local recurrence and spread after excision is frequent, and metastasis to lung has been reported.Limbal (epibulbar) melanoma is a histologically andbehaviorally benign tumor of the melanocytes normally found in an oblique line that d e m a r c a t e s the junction of corneal stroma with sclera at the limbus. T h e t u m o r is composed of large plump melanocytes with a central nucleus and abundant cytoplasmic pigment. Mitotic figures are absent, and nuclear variation is minimal. T h e t u m o r grows outward as a protruding spherical nodule, hence the alternative n a m e of epibulbar melanoma. There may be nodular expansion into peripheral cornea, but virtually never into the uvea or anterior chamber. T u m o r s with similar clinical and histologic appearance that d o invade the globe should be assumed to have originated as anterior uveal m e l a n o m a s , and the scleral extension of such t u m o r s along the adventitia of the scleral venous plexus merely mimics the outflow of many other materials from within the e y e .Anterior uveal melanomas (melanocytomas) of dogs isthe most frequent intraocular t u m o r in that species.

Its cause is almost always bacterial, the organisms reaching the poorly drained cavity via the Eustachian tube or following perforation of the tympanum. In swine and lambs, the infection usually ascends from the pharynx via the Eustachian tube. In dogs and cats, chronic otitis externa is the major predisposition, although the tympanum is quite resistant to inflammatory lysis. There are insufficient cases recorded in other species to permit generalization. In all species there is circumstantial evidence for hematogenous localization of infection in the middle and inner ear, perhaps occurring most often in pigs.Otitis media as a clinically obvious entity is most frequent in feeder pigs. The infection is usually unilateral and associated with hemolytic streptococci. The clinical signs of head tilt, circling, and ataxia suggest involvement of the inner ear in most instances. Otitis media in swine may occur as small epizootics involving a dozen or more pigs. The basis for the clustering of the disease is unproven, but its sporadic association with atrophic rhinitis suggests spread from the upper respiratory tract. In lambs, the lesion is usually clinically undetected and unilateral, and often occurs in association with pneumonia. Pasteurella hemolytica is the usual isolate from both ear and lung. Bottle feeding also increases the prevalence of otitis media in lambs.Regardless of the route of entry, the lesion and its progression are similar. The epithelium lining the tympanic cavity is hyperemic, edematous, and may be ulcerated. Neutrophils exuding from the reactive vessels under the epithelium enter the tympanic cavity, joining the initially serous or serofibrinous exudate to make it progressively more purulent. Exudate may temporarily drain into the pharynx via the Eustachian tube, which is soon sealed by inflammatory swelling of its epithelium. In severe infections, the exudate escapes via inflammatory lysis of the tympanum or, rarely, the bone on the ventral floor of the tympanic bulla. Chronic inflammations are characterized by inspissation of exudate, lysis of the ossicles, and occasionally, the tympanum, and spread to inner ear and brain stem. ",

Ascension via the eighth nerve is relatively frequent and results in focal suppurative meningitis or encephalitis in the region of the pons. The usual clinical syndrome is vestibular dysfunction, described in a subsequent section.",

            "text": "Deafness is difficult to assess in animals, and its diagnosis by simply observing behavioral abnormalities is almost impossible unless the animal is totally and bilaterally deaf. The recent introduction of electrodiagnostic tests has identified a higher prevalence of deafness, especially in dogs, than was suspected. Conductive deafness results from interference with the conduction of sound to the sensory end organ (of Corti) by diseases of external or middle ear. Alternatively, sensorineural deafness results from maldevelopment or degeneration of the sensory organ, eighth nerve, or auditory pathways within the brain. The last is very unusual and, because of the multitude of possible pathways, is seen only in massive destructive lesions with their neurologic signs overshadowing the hearing loss. Nerve deafness usually involves the organ of Corti, and is by far the most prevalent type of deafness encountered in animals by virtue of hereditary deafness in several breeds of dogs, and in dogs or cats with color-dilution anomalies. Conductive deafness may result from oblit\u00e9ra-",
