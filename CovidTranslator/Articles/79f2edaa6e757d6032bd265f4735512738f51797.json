It is unclear whether FIP transmits from cat to cat through the oral route of FIPV infection, and the reason for this includes that FIP is caused by oral inoculation with some FIPV strains (e.g., type II FIPV WSU 79-1146), but is not caused by other FIPV (e.g., type I FIPV KU-2 strain: FIPV-I KU-2). In this study, when cats passively immunized with anti-FIPV-I KU-2 antibodies were orally inoculated with FIPV-I KU-2, FIP was caused at a 50% probability, i.e., FIPV not causing FIP through oral infection caused FIP by inducing antibody-dependent enhancement. Many strains of type I FIPV do not cause FIP by inoculation through the oral route in cats. Based on the findings of this study, type I FIPV which orally infected cats may cause FIP depending on the condition.",

FCoV is classified into two serotypes (I and II), based on differences in the amino acid (aa) sequence of Spike (S) protein and antibody neutralization. Furthermore, FCoV exists as two different biotypes: Feline enteric coronavirus (FECV: avirulent FCoV) and Feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV: virulent FCoV) [21] . Antibodies against virus enhance viral load and disease severity in some viral infections including FIP. This phenomenon is known as antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of viral infection [14] . ADE of FIPV infection can be induced by the presence of sub-neutralizing levels of anti-FIPV S antibodies [6] . Unlike dengue virus infection, ADE was induced by re-infection with the identical serotype virus in FIPV infection [17] .",

Cats inoculated orally with FIPV-I KU-2 without passive immunization did not develop clinical symptoms. No FIP-related lesion was noted on necropsy at 90 dpi with FIPV-I KU-2. Figure 1B shows the survival rate of cats infected with FIPV-I KU-2. The survival rate of cats with passive immunization was lower than that of the cats without passive immunization, and the average survival time after infection with FIPV-I KU-2 was also shorter. We tested for the presence of neutralizing antibodies against FIPV-I KU-2 in cats with passive immunization. In cats with passive immunization, NT was increased to 4-32 fold on the day of virus inoculation (day 3 post passive immunization) ( Fig. 2A) . NT was maintained at a constant level in cats excluding 2 cats (Ab2 and Ab4) which developed FIP after viral challenge. In cats without passive immunization, NT started to increase on 12 dpi with FIPV-I KU-2, and reached 64-128 fold on 36 dpi (Fig. 2B) . Time-course changes in the serum anti-FIPV antibody level were investigated by ELISA using purified soluble FIPV antigen. In cats passive immunization, the ELISA OD value was increased to 0.2-0.8 on the day of virus inoculation (day 3 post passive immunization). As with the NT titer, the ELISA OD value was continuously increased in 2 cats excluding 2 cats developed FIP (Ab2 and Ab4; Fig. 2C ). In cats without passive immunization, the ELISA OD value continuously increased 12-18 dpi after inoculation with FIPV-I KU-2, and reached 1.2-1.7 on 24-30 dpi (Fig. 2D ). Rectal swab samples from cats were subjected to RT-PCR targeting FCoV N gene. In cats with passive immunization, FCoV N gene was detected day 15 after virus inoculation in Ab3. However, FCoV N gene was not detected in any samples of the other cats (Table 1) . Based on the findings described above, FIPV-I KU-2 was suggested to promote ADE through not only subcutaneous but also oral infection. However, the mechanism of ADE induced by FIPV-I KU-2 infection is unclear. To elucidate this mechanism, it is necessary to promote FIPV-I KU-2-induced ADE in vitro. Therefore, the ADE infection with FIPV-I KU-2 was performed in feline macrophage. No FCoV N protein was detected in macrophages treated with only IgG purified from ascites of FIPV-I KU-2-infected cats (Fig. 3A) . In macrophages treated with only FIPV-I KU-2, FCoV N protein was detected in 3.9 \u00b1 2.5% (Mean \u00b1 S.D.) of cells (Fig. 3B) . In macrophages treated with both purified IgG and FIPV-I KU-2, FCoV N protein was detected in 35.9 \u00b1 8.1% (Mean \u00b1 S.D.) of cells (Fig. 3C) , showing that the FIPV-I KU-2 infection rate in macrophages increased in the presence of the antibody.",

However, FIPV-I KU-2 has the genetic characteristics of \"FIPV\", i.e., the sequence of the S1/S2 site of FIPV-I KU-2 is RSRSS (P1 R\u2192S) [10] , and aa at position 1058 has been changed from methionine to leucine [2] . In addition, 178 aa is deleted from 3c protein in FIPV-I KU-2 [3, 22] . Furthermore, no amino acid deletion was noted in 7b protein of FIPV-I KU-2 [5, 19] . It is unclear which of these regions is involved in the pathogenicity of FIPV-I KU-2. It is now possible to prepare recombinant type I FCoV by reverse genetics [4, 20] . It is desired to mutate the regions associated with pathogenicity in FIPV-I KU-2, inoculate cats with these mutants through various routes, and confirm whether the mutant causes FIP.",

On the basis of these facts, we suggested that inoculation routes result in differential patterns of virus shedding in cats infected with FIPV. Generally, when a cat developed FIP in multi-cat environments, cats living together also develop FIP at a high probability [1] . FIPV excreted from cats with FIP may infect other cats through the oral route. However, orally inoculated type I FIPV mostly does not cause FIP in cats [11] . It has been difficult to explain these contradictory facts. It was clarified that even FIPV not causing FIP through oral infection may cause FIP in anti-type I FCoV-seropositive cats. However, not all anti-FIPV seropositive cats develop FIP. For example, ADE is not promoted and the virus is neutralized in cats with a high anti-FIPV neutralizing antibody level [7] . FIP also does not develop when cellular immunity is strongly induced after FIPV infection [12] . Based on these findings, to elucidate the clinical state of FIP, it is necessary to analyze the status of immunity in cats after viral infection. However, many recent studies on FIP do not focus on the host but focus on the virus. We suggest that FIP is a \"multi-causal disease\" involving various risk factors (virulence of FCoV, the status of immunity in host, and the route of virus infection etc.).",
