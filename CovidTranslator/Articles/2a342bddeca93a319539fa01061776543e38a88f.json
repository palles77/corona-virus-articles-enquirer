This procedure was followed by use of a heminested PCR with the same forward primer but the reverse primer UTR hemi-(5\u2032-CTTAAACTAAAATTTAGCTCTTCC-3\u2032) under the same reaction conditions as the initial PCR, which had an expected product size of 214 bp.

More detailed genetic characterization of the viruses detected including, for example, the S1 spike gene, is also needed.
