Predisposing factors for ARDS are diverse 1,3 and include sepsis, aspiration, pneumonias and infections with the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus 4,5 . At present, there are no effective drugs for improving the clinical outcome of ARDS 1-3 . Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and ACE2 are homologues with different key functions in the renin-angiotensin system 6-8 . ACE cleaves angiotensin I to generate angiotensin II, whereas ACE2 inactivates angiotensin II and is a negative regulator of the system. ACE2 has also recently been identified as a potential SARS virus receptor and is expressed in lungs 9,10 . Here we report that ACE2 and the angiotensin II type 2 receptor (AT 2 ) protect mice from severe acute lung injury induced by acid aspiration or sepsis. However, other components of the renin-angiotensin system, including ACE, angiotensin II and the angiotensin II type 1a receptor (AT 1 a), promote disease pathogenesis, induce lung oedemas and impair lung function. We show that mice deficient for Ace show markedly improved disease, and also that recombinant ACE2 can protect mice from severe acute lung injury. Our data identify a critical function for ACE2 in acute lung injury, pointing to a possible therapy for a syndrome affecting millions of people worldwide every year.",

Although ACE2 is expressed in the lungs of humans 10 and mice (see Supplementary Fig. 1a, b) , nothing is known about its function in the lungs. However, mortality following SARS coronavirus infections approaches almost 10% owing to the development of ARDS [14] [15] [16] .

Whereas all CLP-treated wild-type mice survived, only two out of ten CLP-treated Ace2 knockout mice survived the 6 h experimental observation period (Fig. 2a) . CLP resulted in lung failure defined by increased elastance (Fig. 2a) , pulmonary oedema ( Fig. 2b ) and leukocyte accumulation (Fig. 2c ) in wild-type mice. CLP-treated Ace2 knockout mice had a marked worsening of lung functions (Fig. 2a) , increased oedema ( Fig. 2b ) and leukocyte accumulation ( Fig. 2c ) compared with wild-type mice. In addition, Ace2 knockout mice also developed markedly enhanced acute lung injury after endotoxin challenge 18 (see Supplementary Fig. 2a-c) . Ace2 maps to the X chromosome, and it should be noted that loss of ACE2 expression resulted in equally severe acute lung injury phenotypes in male (Ace2 2/y ) and female (Ace2 2/2 ) mice.

ACE cleaves the decapeptide angiotensin (Ang)I into the octapeptide AngII (refs 11, 12) . ACE2 cleaves a single residue from AngI to generate Ang1-9 (refs 6, 7), and a residue from AngII to generate Ang1-7 (ref. 6) . In this way, ACE2 negatively regulates the renin-angiotensin system by inactivating AngII (Fig. 3a) . Acid aspiration in wild-type mice resulted in marked downregulation of ACE2 protein, but ACE levels remained constant (Fig. 1e) . Moreover, only catalytically active ACE2 improved the acute lung injury phenotype in mutant and wild-type mice ( Fig. 2d-f ). To clarify whether acute lung injury shifts the functional equilibrium between ACE and ACE2, we measured AngII levels in acid-treated and control mice. Acid aspiration markedly increased AngII levels in lungs ( Fig. 3b ) and plasma (see Supplementary Fig. 4a ) of wild-type mice. We observed a further, significant increase in AngII levels in the lungs (Fig. 3b ) and plasma (see Supplementary  Fig. 4a ) of acid-treated Ace2 knockout mice. Thus, acute lung injury results in decreased ACE2 expression and increased production of AngII.",

Moreover, treatment with rhuACE2 protein attenuated lung injury (Fig. 2d-f ) and further reduced AngII levels in the lungs of acid-treated mice ( Supplementary Fig. 4d ). In contrast to Ace2 knockout mice, Ace 2/2 mice 21 were partly protected against acute lung injury induced by acid-aspiration ( Fig. 3c and Supplementary Fig. 5 ). These effects were dependent on gene dosage and were observed to a lesser extent in Ace \u00fe/2 mice. In addition, inactivation of Ace on an Ace2 knockout background rescued the severe lung failure (Fig. 3d) , oedema formation (Fig. 3e ) and histological changes (Fig. 3f ) compared with Ace2 knockout mice. Similarly, in endotoxin-induced acute lung injury, the severe lung impairments in Ace2 knockout mice were reversed by additional Ace gene deficiency (see Supplementary Fig. 6 ). Thus, ACE promotes acute lung injury pathology and ACE2 alleviates it.",

Errors bars indicate s.e.m. explanation for these clinical findings and indicate that, in the pathogenesis of acute lung injury, AngII is upregulated by ACE and drives severe lung failure through the AT 1 a receptor. On the other hand, ACE2 and the AT 2 receptor protect against lung injury. Exogenous recombinant human ACE2 attenuates acute lung failure in Ace2 knockout as well as in wild-type mice. This combination of genetic, pharmacological and protein rescue experiments defines a new and critical role for the renin-angiotensin system in the pathogenesis of acute lung injury, and show that ACE2 is a key molecule involved in the development and progression of acute lung failure.",

Mice were handled in accordance with institutional guidelines. Experimental murine models of acute lung injury. For acid aspiration-induced acute lung injury, anaesthesized mice were intratracheally instilled with HCl (pH 1.5; 2 ml kg 21 ) and ventilated for 3 h (refs 18, 19) . To study sepsis-induced acute lung injury, we performed caecal ligation perforation (CLP) 20 . Shamoperated mice underwent the same procedure without ligation and puncture of the caecum. Eighteen hours after sham/CLP surgery, animals were subjected to mechanical ventilation for up to 6 h. For endotoxin-induced acute lung injury, anaesthetized mice received LPS and zymosan intratracheally immediately after starting mechanical ventilation and 1 h later, respectively 18 .

Blood oxygenation, pulmonary oedema, pulmonary vascular permeability and histology. Blood samples were obtained from the left heart ventricle and partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood (p aO 2 ) was measured.

The catalytic activities of purified recombinant ACE2 proteins were measured using the fluorogenic peptide Substrate VI (R&D Systems). Mut-rhuACE2-Fc showed .95% loss of catalytic activity (see Supplementary Fig. 3a) .
