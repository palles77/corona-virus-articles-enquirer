Thus, to promote the early inflection point, the infected people should be detected and isolated early, the medical team need to develop a new coronavirus vaccine, strengthened contact tracing and quarantine, and what's more, wearing masks, avoiding crowd contact and strengthening their own immunity are requisite. By utilizing the official notification data on the website of the National Health Commission, the State Transition Matrix Model predicted inflection points and patient distribution (based on the current state of the patient and not subject to historical factors). Owing to Hubei Province not affected by external factors such as people mobility (return peaks) and local control, compared to the national analysis, the effect only analyzing Hubei Province could be better. If the population is limited and the transition matrix is fixed, the above formulas will enough to predict all future results. However, the index of new cases will be affected by the input of PCR kit 18 . Simultaneously, as for confirming diagnosis of new cases, pharyngeal swabs are not as accurate as alveolar lavage fluid which means the possibility of false negatives.",

This minimizes the need for only the following five parameters.
