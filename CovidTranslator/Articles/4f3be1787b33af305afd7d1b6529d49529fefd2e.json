Sci., Captive environments are believed to produce behavioral changes in animal populations that may limit our ability to generalize back to natural populations. These behavioral changes are thought to be associated with one or both of the following: (a) changes in frequencies of genes or gene complexes due to the effects of inbreeding or to changes in selection pressure; (b) changes in development of the phenotype due to the effects of changes in environmental variables. Inbreeding leads to increase in homozygosity, that may result in developmental anomalies because of a breakdown in developmental homeostasis. Changes in selection pressure may disrupt coadapted gene complexes that have evolved in the wild. Often, domestication is believed to result in individuals that are \"degenerate\"; i.e. inferior to individuals in the wild. However, this notion has received no empirical support. In fact, if phenotype changes do occur under domestication, these are usually quantitative, not qualitative, in nature. We suggest that the study of the domestication process may reveal evolutionary principles that would be difficult to discover in other ways, and the zoological parks may be ideal situations for such research.",

This variability has been assumed to be the result of differences in environments among individuals (and with little or no consideration of the possible adaptiveness of behavior). Therefore, psychology has studied the importance of environmental differences for phenotypic differences within species, and ethology has studied the importance of genotypic differences for phenotypic differences between species. This is because the former has usually been concerned with the development of behavior (usually learned behavior), whereas the latter has been concerned with its evolution (in the form of instinctive behavior).",

They have had little enthusiasm for variation in behavior patterns, which only seemed to muddy the picture. As a result, animals that failed to exhibit the \"typical\" behavior of their species were either ignored or treated as deviants destined for early removal from the population by natural selection.\" (pp. 224-225) . Barlow (1977) emphasized the variability to be found in what have usually been considered stereotyped patterns of behavior. This had been shown previously for geotaxis in Drosophila melanogaster by Hirsch and Erlenmeyer-Kimling (1961; see also Hirsch, 1963; Hirsch and McGuire, 1982) . The concept of evolutionarily stable strategy (Maynard Smith, 1976 ) requires that there be differences among individuals, as does the notion of dominance. Because ethologists have often selected the more invariable patterns of behavior to study, variability has often not been recognized. Therefore, the present rapprochement between ethology and psychology has been two-fold; involving a greater emphasis on the importance of behavioral variability in ethology and of evolution in psychology.",

Differences in mobility indicate the presence of at least one amino acid difference between proteins associated with the same locus. Lack of a difference in mobility, however, does not necessarily indicate an identity of amino acid sequence because the genetic code is redundant and only four of the 20 amino acids in organisms are charged electrically (Lewontin and Hubby, 1966; Powell, 1975; Selander, 1976) .

(1979) discussed the effects of inbreeding in captive populations of ungulates and found that, in the majority of species studied, inbred animals suffered higher juvenile mortality than non-inbred animals.

Semen samples of 18 cheetahs were compared to those from domestic cats and it was found that spermatozoan concentrations were 10 times less in cheetahs. Morphological abnormalities were found in 71% of cheetah and 29% of cat spermatozoa. O'Brien et al.

The notion that domestication results in degeneracy was once common among ethologists, yet it was unsubstantiated. Boice (1973) stated: \"This notion, contrasted with that of adaptiveness, does not lend itself to objectivity but its rationale is well founded in two beliefs: Wild creatures are hardier and wilier, and man's selfish goals in domesticating an animal will necessarily produce its degrading and disfiguring .... The belief that mental deterioration accompanies domestication seems so commonsensical that contemporary articles.., assert the intellectual idiocy, vegetalization, and degeneracy of domestic rodents although no published data support their claims.\" (p. 218).

In addition, dogs show greater promiscuity than wolves (Price, 1984, and references therein}. Scott (1969) suggested that these behavioral changes are the result of evolution because hypersexuality may increase the reproductive success of captive individuals (and, therefore, be selected for naturally). However, Price postulated that hypersexuality in dogs may be the result of \"constant exposure to a sexually stimulating environment\" (p. 21) and, therefore, may be developmental in origin.

They observed two types of social interaction in obtaining their measure of dominance: {1} spontaneous interaction was defined as social behavior not involving competition for a \"tangible commodity\" (water, food, nest-box, etc.}; (2} competitive interaction was defined as social behavior involving competition for such commodities. It was found that \"Domestic rats were most dominant in both spontaneous and competitive cross-strain interactions.
