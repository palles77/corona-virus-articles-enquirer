Twelve Holstein bull calves (approximately 3 wk of age) were allocated by initial body weight to Control (n = 5) and treated (n = 7) groups. On d 0, all calves were orally challenged with 1 \u00d7 10 7 plaqueforming units of virulent coronavirus isolate. Infection was allowed to progress for 24 h before treatment was started. On d 1, treated calves began receiving 160 g of dry bovine serum powder (16 g IgG) mixed into milk replacer powder (67 g) at both an a.m. and p.m. feeding. Control calves received only milk replacer powder (227 g) at both feedings. Response to coronavirus challenge and dietary treatment was monitored prior to a.m. and p.m. feeding by the collection of multiple clinical measures. Fecal consistency was decreased by coronavirus challenge but was not affected by dietary treatment. Mean daily rectal temperature and heart rate were not affected by dietary treatment. Average packed cell volume was higher in treated calves than in control (35.0 and 27.0%). Coronavirus challenge resulted in an immediate increase in respiration rate, decreasing by d 7. Control calves tended to have a greater average respiration rate compared with treated (28.7 vs. 26.8 breaths/min). Treated calves had a higher average feed intake than control (0.57 vs. 0.44 kg/d). These data suggest that bovine-serum supplemented milk replacer may decrease the severity of disease in young calves exposed to coronavirus.",

Bovine coronavirus affects both dairy and beef and is most common in calves 1 to 2 wk of age (Clark, 1993) . In adult cattle, BCV has been linked to winter dysentery, a diarrheal condition affecting housed cattle (Clark, 1993) . The mode of infection is often via the oral route, and both enteric and respiratory BCV infection has been shown (Reynolds, 1983) . Calf morbidity rates from naturally occurring BCV infection may be as high as 15 to 25% (Langpap et al., 1979) . Strict sanitation and isolation of neonatal calves can be implemented to help prevent infection; however, the exposure rate is still high on many farms. Viral infections such as BCV are not treatable with antibiotics, except to combat secondary bacterial infection. Supportive care and electrolyte therapy attempting to replace lost fluids and prevent dehydration are often the only treatments available (Clark, 1993) .",

In these studies, serum-derived Ig was offered soon after birth, when the calf's intestinal epithelium is permeable to large molecular weight proteins. As a result, the serumderived Ig was absorbed and found to be circulating in systemic blood. In contrast, the use of bovine serum in older calves, experiencing enteric challenge, has received little attention. Quigley and Drew (2000) investigated the prophylactic effect of spray-dried bovine plasma versus antibiotics in the milk replacer of calves challenged with Escherichia coli. In this study, calves offered bovine plasma had equal improvements in attitude, hydration, and BW gain to calves treated with antibiotics. In pigs, the beneficial impact of dietary plasma protein has been known since 1987 (Zimmerman, 1987) . Since this time, the effect of dietary plasma on young pig performance has been linked to improved enteric health during exposure to antigens associated with normal production environments (Coffey and Cromwell, 1995) and disease-causing pathogens (Cain and Zimmerman, 1997) . The objective of the current study was to evaluate the effect of dietary bovine serum on dairy calf health and performance following enteric challenge with bovine coronavirus.",

After fast, calves were assigned randomly to one of two dietary treatments consisting of a control (control; n = 5) and serum-fed group (treated; n = 7).

In one study, calves fed colostrum containing antirotavirus antibody did not become diarrheic, compared with calves fed normal colostrum, which experienced diarrhea for over 7 d following challenge (Castrucci et al., 1984) . In contrast to the current study and that reported by Quigley and Drew (2000) , these calves began consuming the anti-rotavirus colostrum at birth, thereby allowing some Ig absorption. Similarly, newborn pigs were protected against E. coli challenge-induced diarrhea when orally dosed with egg yolk-based antibody solutions obtained from immunized hens (Yokoyama et al., 1992) . The bovine-serum material used in the current study was not tested for titers against BCV.

This may be a result of the normal diurnal glucocorticoid response in farm animals, for which peak excretion occurs in the morning hours (Breazile, 1988) . This theory suggests that calves are more intensely susceptible to stress stimuli in the evening hours when a greater glucocorticoid-associated stress response may occur. Calf rectal temperature tended (P = 0.06) to be lower for treated calves than for control; however, this difference was minor (0.2\u00b0C) and probably of no biological significance. Increased PCV is a common result of hemoconcentration, which is an indicator of an animal's level of hydration. Calves fed bovine serum had a higher (P < 0.01) mean PCV than control (Table 2) . Although values for both treatments are within the normal erythrocyte PCV range for cattle (24.0 to 46.0%; Schalm, 1986) , the reason for the observed treatment difference is difficult to explain. Splenic contraction, resulting from excitement, can cause an increase in PCV, even in dehydrated cattle that have recently consumed water (Bianca, 1970) . Although the difference in PCV was small (8.0%), it may reflect a difference in how treatments were affecting the anxiety of animals during handling and sample collection.",

Although unchallenged, calves in this study experienced increased growth when offered bovine plasma containing calf milk replacer. In the current study, starting and ending BW were similar for both treatments (Table 3) . Feed intake decreased (P < 0.01) following BCV challenge and progressively increased during the 7-d postchallenge period. Perhaps the most biologically significant observation of the current study is the increased feed intake experienced by treated calves (Table 2) . Although change in BW and daily BW gain was similar for both treatments (Table 3) , feed intake was more closely correlated with calf gain for treated calves than with control (R 2 = 0.92 and 0.65 for treated and control calves, respectively), suggesting less variability in the efficiency of treated calves to convert feed into added BW.",
