Information on the occurrence and influencing factors of infectious diseases can be collected via several effective and sensitive surveillance systems and channels and analyzed to reveal the occurrence and development of infectious diseases for timely detection of \"abnormal increase\" of the incidence, so as to warn relevant responsible departments, institutions, and population that may be affected by the diseases. (2) Timeliness: It is essential for infectious disease early warning to be timely in its detection and warning during the early stages of outbreaks. During the course of the outbreak, the negative impact caused by infectious diseases rapidly increase over time. As shown in Fig. 1 .1, when people in the community are infected with the Ebola virus, cases will increase rapidly without timely detection or measures to control the epidemic (WHO, 2016) . Early warning provides an opportunity to implement response measures early that may otherwise be missed. For a specific early warning system, timeliness is represented by the lag time between the onset of the outbreak and when the outbreak is actually detected by the early warning system. Therefore, enhancing timeliness means reducing the lag time, either by using different types of data, improving the collection of surveillance data, or by adopting optimized early warning algorithms. (3) Information for action: The aim of early warning is to provide evidence-based guidance resulting in an informed and targeted response for the purpose of controlling the outbreaks, or at the very least, ensuring they are reduced to a minimum. Therefore, early warning and response are closely linked, hence the so-called \"information for action.\" The Early",

It was designed to provide surveillance information that is obtained from unified and broadly applicable health surveillance methods for all levels of public health to detect diseases and related health problems early with a timely assessment and response. BioSense uses many forms of surveillance information, including complaints, symptoms and laboratory tests that are required for clinical diagnoses. Focusing on clinical symptoms and symptoms of diagnosed or undiagnosed cases, it reflects syndrome surveillance and constitutes, together with BioWatch and NBIS, the three core biological surveillance programs. BioSense is an international, multijurisdictional, information-sharing surveillance platform that applies to all levels of the public health sector. At the same time, given its use of standardized data elements and analytical methods, BioSense analysts can compare the public health status in different countries or regions in the same country. BioSense can visualize time, space, people and other information via maps, charts, tables and other forms, and the information that it presents can indicate data anomalies. When receiving a prompt, users can confirm the anomalies with related information and may provide an early warning of health problems. Since its development in 2003, BioSense has been greatly improved and developed to meet changing demands and user feedback, and its sources of information have expanded to the US Department Introduction CHAPTER 1 of Veterans Affairs, health-related information from the US DOD and treatment information for all citizens. It is jointly maintained and managed by the national CDC, state and district health departments, and other departments that apply this system.",

Electronic communications allow ProMED to provide up-to-date and reliable news about threats to human, animal, and food plant health around the world, 7 days a week. By providing early warning of outbreaks for emerging and re-emerging diseases, public health precautions can be implemented at all levels in a timely manner to prevent epidemic transmission and save lives. ProMED is open to all sources and is free from political constraints. Sources of information include media reports, official reports, online summaries, local observers, and others. Reports are often contributed by ProMED subscribers. A team of expert human, plant, and animal disease moderators screens, reviews, and investigates reports before posting them to the network. Reports are distributed by email to direct subscribers and are immediately available on the ProMED web site. ProMED has reached over 70,000 subscribers in at least 185 countries.",

Different from traditional surveillance systems, syndromic surveillance systems are designed to identify signs of an outbreak before a doctor discovers and reports the first case. Such a system may be defined as \"syndrome\" or \"pre-diagnosis\" surveillance. Compared to data on definitive diagnoses, syndromic surveillance data (such as complaints from emergency department patients and sales of over-the-counter (OTC) drugs) has lower specificity and can only be analyzed and processed with specific early warning methods. When using all of the available information to enrich and develop low-dimensional data methods for early warning, research is needed on high-dimensional data methods for improving the sensitivity, specificity and timeliness of early warning.",

(5) Early warning based on lab surveillance: The popularity and refinement of modern laboratory networks with molecular biology and bioinformatics will greatly enhance early identification of the intrinsic relations (e.g., gene fingerprints) among seemingly unrelated sporadic cases for early warning. It will substantially enhance the early identification of the epidemiological significance of pathogens, and provide strong evidence for the early warning of infectious disease outbreaks. (6) Evaluating early warning methods: Evaluating early warning methodology is also very important in current early warning research. This primarily refers to studying evaluation standards for early warning methods, systems, and test data. Sensitivity and specificity are two important indicators of evaluation. Other common indicators include the positive predictive value, receiver operating characteristic curve, activity monitoring operating characteristic, and the probability for successful detection.",

The Emergency Response Law of the People's Republic ofChina (2007)  has provisions for the early of data and avoiding duplicative reporting. At the county level or higher, 98% of all hospitals could directly report data to the NIDRIS via the Internet, which includes 87% of the township hospitals. These direct network reports of infectious diseases have changed the previous monthly report into a daily report.NIDRIS provides a large number of complete and reliable time series analyses for developing early warning methods. Since 2002, China's CDC has adopted the Moving Percentile Method to establish an automated-alert response concept model and its thresholds for different infectious diseases, while evaluating their sensitivity, specificity and timeliness. In 2006 and 2007, there was a pilot of CIDARS, and it operated nationwide on Apr. 21, 2008. CIDARS is the first complete and practical early warning system for infectious diseases in China",

The data from diagnosed cases were reported by hospitals to the local CDCs at the county level in a prescribed time limit, and the aggregated counts of cases were reported monthly to CDCs at provincial and national levels. In 1990, China established the PHIS (Public Health Information System), which uses computer technology and epidemic prevention stations across all provinces and municipalities to complete infectious disease statements for their respective jurisdictions and report to higher authorities. In 2004, China established a national \"Notifiable Infectious Disease Reporting Information System\" (NIDRIS). This system allows for the direct reporting of individual case data to a national database that is located in China's CDC, which decreases the time interval from diagnosis to report from 5 days to only 4 hours and significantly improves the timeliness and information about infectious diseases.The infectious disease surveillance reports have accumulated abundant epidemiological information over time and provide data that are necessary to systematically analyze situations and trends of infectious diseases in China. Based on the infectious disease surveillance data, Chinese researchers have conducted a series of studies on infectious disease prediction and early warning. For example, a \"gray dynamic model\" was proposed by Feng et al. (2003) and a \"Z-D Phenomenon\" by Zeng et al. (1997) for predicting infectious diseases.Beginning in 2002, Yang et al. (2004) engaged in the study of automated-alert response theory and technology, and initially started control charting techniques for seven infectious diseases that were simple to operate, extensively applied, and highly efficient for early warning. They selected the thresholds for seven infectious diseases and used the results to establish a national automated-alert response system. Given its vast territory, varied natural environment and diverse socio-economic levels, the incidence of infectious diseases greatly varies in China, and there is a need for both a simple and practical early warning method and an operational system. Notifiable infectious disease reporting is a systematic and complete data resource for infectious diseases. In 2004, China officially launched an information platform to establish the NIDRIS, \"Information System for Public Health Emergency Management\" and \"Management System for Single Disease Report,\" which indicates that China's infectious disease surveillance reporting research has embarked on electronic and network tracks. The system provides broad coverage in China for reporting notifiable diseases and includes all health institutes across the country, while routine supervision and evaluation are conducted by health authorities to assess the quality of the reports. NIDRIS has a good quality control process for improving timeliness and the completeness",
