            "text": "Textbooks typically depict mRNA as a straight line coming out of the nucleus and running through the hazy translation apparatus. Messenger RNA, however, is not just a linear structure to be simply read as a tape. Folded structures within the coding regions of mRNA play crucial but widely unappreciated roles in directing the traffic of translating ribosomes. In particular, pseudoknots, which are stem-loops with downstream sequences paired back to the loop, are found at key locations in mRNAs, where they stimulate specific redirection of ribosome reading frame or alter the meaning of stop codons. Since the sequences forming these pseudoknot structures often encode amino acids, they must ultimately be unfolded and read out by the ribosome. While the mechanisms by which pseudoknots alter ribosome behavior are still unclear, dissection of the structures themselves proves to be fascinating. The 1.6 \u00c5 resolution X-ray crystal structure of the pseudoknot in beet western yellows virus (BWYV) reported in this issue 1 reveals intriguing features of one such pseudoknot.",

In addition, pseudoknots found near the 3' end of retroviral gag genes, which encode the major core proteins of the virus, were predicted to be important for many cases of frameshifting 5 . Later studies on mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) 6 , simi-an retrovirus (SRV) 7, 8 and several others confirmed this prediction for retroviruses. Nevertheless, while pseudoknots are common 3' stimulators of programmed -1 frameshifting, other structures such as simple stem loops 9,10 , three way junctions 11 and even combinations of distant as well as nearby sequences 12, 13 are also utilized in certain naturally occurring cases.",

However, NMR analysis of a functional derivative of the MMTV gag pseudoknot revealed that the two stems are at an angle of ~60\u00b0. The bend is a consequence of an unpaired nucleotide between the two stems and constraints imposed by the number and stacking of nucleotides in loop 2, which connects the bottom of stem 1 and the bottom of stem 2 18 . An extrapolation of these findings is that a bent conformation may be a distinguishing feature of frameshift stimulatory pseudoknots. This was challenged by the report that stacking interactions were found between the stems of the SRV pseudoknot 20 , but whether the stems are actually coaxial is unclear. In any case these experiments show that a pronounced bend of the order of ~60\u00b0is not a requisite feature for function as a frameshift stimulator. Nor does a bend of 60\u00b0seem to be a requirement for high level frameshift stimulation, as the efficiencies of SRV and MMTV frameshifting are similar (~23%).",

Substitution of the pseudoknots of IBV, yeast L-A and MMTV with other stable RNA structures (for example, extended stem loops) greatly reduces frameshifting and in the cases tested still causes riboso-mal pausing 4, [23] [24] [25] .

In the case of BWYV we could reasonably guess that as the ribosome encounters the pseudoknot, the first base of the heptanucleotide shift site will not yet be in the A site of the ribosome. (About 40 mRNA nucleotides are encompassed by a ribosome and the decoding site is roughly in the middle of the ribosome; the mRNA has 13 nucleotides from the beginning of the shift site to the pseudoknot: seven nucleotides of the shift site plus six for the spacer.) Some accommodation of the ribosome or mRNA may be needed for the A and P sites to reach the shift site. The ribosome could possibly reach the shift site by engulfing the incoming pseudoknot structure intact, in which case the pseudoknot may stimulate frameshifting by specific interactions from within the ribosome. Alternatively, the ribosome could unwind at least part of the pseudoknot in order to access the shift site. In this case the pseudoknot may have already prepared the ribosome to frameshift before unfolding or perhaps it is the unfolded pseudoknot that causes the stimulation.",
