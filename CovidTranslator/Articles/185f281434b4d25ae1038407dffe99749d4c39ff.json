It is thought that ferrets have been living in association with humans for over 2000 years [1, 2] . Ferrets are lively and engaging, and continue to gain in popularity as pets; it is estimated that there are 8 million ferrets kept as pets, making them the third most popular pet in the United States [3, 4] . Despite this popularity, most states do not recognize the ferret as a domestic animal; in several locations ferrets cannot legally be kept as a pet. In some states, permits must be issued by the appropriate state or federal wildlife/fisheries department prior to acquisition of a pet ferret (Table 1) [1, 3] .",

Breeding animals and kits require diets higher in protein and fat [1] . Carbohydrates are not required in significant amounts and should be limited [6] .

Some practitioners feel strongly that feeding commercial diets containing poor quality meat proteins or large quantities of plant-based ingredients contributes to the development of eosinophilic gastroenteritis, inflammatory bowel disease, insulinoma, urolithiasis, and general unthriftiness [6, 7] . For example, in the United States where most ferrets are fed dry kibbled diets, the incidence of insulinoma is high. In Europe and Australia, many ferrets are fed whole prey items (ie, a ''natural'' diet), and the incidence of insulinoma is low. A correlation between diet and the development of certain diseases in ferrets is hypothetical at this point in time, and while the authors do not necessarily advocate abandoning the feeding of premium quality cat foods or ferret foods to ferrets, this controversy demonstrates the need for long-term dietary studies in ferrets.",

Current hypotheses suggest that the adrenal cortex begins secretion of sex hormones in place of the ''missing'' gonadal tissue. The artificial light cycles cause continued overstimulation of the hypothalamicpituitary-adrenal neuroendocrine axis, resulting in production of androgens by the adrenal gland. These factors combined may give rise to what is labeled as adrenal disease in ferrets (hyperplasia of the adrenal glands, adrenal adenomas, and/or adrenal adenocarcinomas) [14, 35] .",

When scruffing a ferret, use one hand to grasp as much skin as possible over the back of the neck and lift the ferret up, suspending all four legs off the table. Most will promptly relax and offer little resistance. The spine can be supported with the other hand, or the ferret may be reclined against the forearm of the arm the handler is using to scruff the ferret (Fig. 2) . The rear legs should not be placed on the table top or held; this gives the ferret leverage, and it may struggle. This method of restraint is useful for many procedures including: oral medication administration, vaccination, injections, and subcutaneous fluid administration. Many ferrets yawn when scruffed, which aids in examination of the oral cavity.",

Intravenous catheters are typically placed in the cephalic vein; the lateral saphenous vein may be used for catheterization as well, but this site is difficult to maintain (Fig. 8) . To place an i.v. catheter, anesthetize the ferret with inhalant anesthesia, unless the ferret is moribund. Place the anesthetized ferret in sternal recumbancy and position as described for cephalic venipuncture. The skin of the ferret is very tough; therefore, perform a modified cutdown with a 20-or 22-gauge needle, taking care to avoid the vein, and introduce a heparinized 24-to 25-gauge catheter into the vein. The catheter may then be threaded off the stylet directly into the vein. When catheterizing small or severely debilitated ferrets, it is sometimes helpful to attach a tuberculin syringe containing heparinized saline to the catheter hub after removing the stylet. Heparinized saline is then flushed through the catheter to dilate the vein as the catheter is advanced. The person holding off the vein must release pressure on the vein as the catheter is advanced if this technique is used. The catheter is taped and wrapped securely to the forearm. Most ferrets do not chew catheters, and will not require Elizabethan collars as long as the catheter is covered and the rubber injection port is not exposed. Jugular catheters are not frequently used in ferrets unless central venous access is needed for treatment purposes; ferrets often object to the tape around their neck and become depressed [4] . When necessary, i.o. catheters may be placed in the proximal tibia or greater trochanter of the femur.",

Sinus rhythms are common in ferrets, and may be quite pronounced. The spleen of the ferret varies greatly in size dependent on the animal's health and age. An enlarged spleen is not uncommon in older ferrets, and can be a ''normal'' finding. Ferrets are induced ovulators. A female that is not bred or spayed may develop life-threatening estrogen-induced anemia [2] . Ferrets have paired anal sacs. Most ferrets purchased from commercial breeding farms and pet stores are already descented and neutered; private breeders often leave these procedures to the new owner. Ferret odor primarily comes from the sebaceous glands in the skin. Intact animals during will have a stronger odor and yellow-tinged oily fur during breeding season [6, 10] .",
