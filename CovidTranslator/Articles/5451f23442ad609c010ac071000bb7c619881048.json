The CPE-based assay was the first assay developed to evaluate whether a compound showed any antiviral efficacy and have been used to screen large compound library. Meanwhile, cytotoxicity of antivirals could also be evaluated using the CPE-based assay. The dose-response assay was designed to determine the range of efficacy for the selected antiviral, i.e. 50% inhibitory concentration (IC 50 ) or effective concentration (EC 50 ), as well as its range of cytotoxicity (CC 50 ). The ToA assay was employed for the initial MoA study to determine the underlying mechanism of the novel antivirals during BTV viral lifecycle or the possible effect on host cellular machinery. These assays are vital for the evaluation of antiviral efficacy in cell culture system, and have been used for our recent researches leading to the identification of a number of novel antivirals against BTV.",

BTV is one of the most important diseases of domestic livestock, including sheep, goat, cattle and other domestic animals, with $3 billion/year loss worldwide 1, 2 . The exotic BTV serotype is an important animal pathogen listed in the \"USDA High Consequence Livestock Pathogens.\" Recently, the re-emerging of BTV has caused a major outbreak of disease in cattle and sheep in several countries across Northern Europe 3, 4 . As a result of its economic significance and as a model system, BTV has been the subject of extensive molecular, genetic and structural studies, and several vaccines have been developed. However, due to the lack of proper assays for antiviral drug discovery, there are no antivirals available against BTV.",

CPE-based assay is a well-recognized assay that has been used in antiviral drug discovery against a number of viruses that induced rapid and observable CPE/apoptosis [5] [6] [7] . In our system, post BTV infection, CPE is evident in vertebrate cells, including HeLa, BSR, and HEK 293T 8 . BTV-induced CPE could be monitored and quantified using various cell viability detection methods, including the CellTiter Glo cell viability reagent kit (CTG kit) 9 . This kit determines the number of viable cells in culture based on quantitation of cellular ATP presented, which signals the presence of metabolically active living cells. Under optimized conditions, the CPE-based assay presented here showed its feasibility with the \"mix and measure\" one step protocol, and flexibility with stable luminescent signals. Meanwhile, toxic compounds reducing cell viability will be excluded in this CPE-based assay. The CPE-based assay showed its robustness and reliability for antiviral drug discovery against BTV, and has been used to screen the NIH Molecular Libraries Small Molecule Repository (MLSMR), which leads to the identification of six novel cluster of potential antiviral lead compound(s) 5 .",

Generally, antiviral compound were added to cells at different times pre-or post-virus infection. If the antivirals were added to the infected cells post to its target step during the course of infection, it would result in lower activity when compared to the one which was added prior to the step.

When adding C052 at 1 or 2 hr prior to BTV infection, i.e. -1 and -2 h.p.i., the antiviral efficacies remained at the nanomolar scale (Figure 2) 2 , indicating that C052 might act beyond the early stage of viral life-cycle, such as virus entry. Furthermore, the antiviral efficacy remained unchanged until C052 was added to infected cells as later as 24 h.p.i.. When added at 32 h.p.i., the percentage of viable cells decreased in C052 treatment cells, indicating that C052 was less protective at this stage of viral life-cycle. When added at 48 h.p.i., there was no protection to BSR cells from BTV-induced CPE. Since the first cycle of BTV viral replication usually completed in infected cells within 24 h.p.i., our results suggested that C052 might act at the late stages of BTV viral life-cycle, such as virus replication, packaging, maturation and egress. Meanwhile, it is also possible that C052 may act on host cellular machineries that were involved during late viral life-cycle ",

            "text": "For the initial identification of antiviral hits, one of the key steps for antiviral drug discovery and development is to develop robust assays, which includes selecting a quantifiable marker, developing a simple protocol, obtaining sufficient signals and less than 10% CV. Most biochemical or cell-based screens are designed to provide a chemical starting point based upon the most robust, simple and inexpensive assay, due to the required reproducibility in the screening process and the potentially large number of molecules to be screened. The CPE-based assay was designated to meet these requirements to identify effective hits from a large compound library. CPE refers to the adverse effect on the cultured cells associated with the multiplication of viruses. Various assays are available to use the CPE indicator through measuring a variety of different markers indicating the number of dead cells (cytotoxicity), the number of live cells (viability), and the mechanism of cell death (apoptosis). Commercial reagents for CPE-based assay are available with a simple assay protocol. For example, the CTG kit includes the single \"mix and measure\" step and has been widely used to quantify virus induced CPE. However, CPE-based assay is limited to viruses that could induce rapid CPE. For viruses that do not induce rapid CPE, various assays have been developed. For example, the replicon-based assay using the replicon-harboring cell line allows screening for inhibitors of viral replication, including translation, polyprotein processing, and minus-and plus-strand RNA synthesis [12] [13] [14] . The antisense RNA strategies and virtual screening of small-molecule libraries also could be used to identify possible antivirals 15, 16 . Nevertheless, it is critical that the efficacy of an antiviral drug be validated in the in vitro cell-based assay which allows the evaluation of antiviral efficacy against the entire viral life-cycle. CPE-based assay has been successfully adapted into high throughput format and is one of the most reliable and robust assay for the screening of large compound libraries, including recently accomplished HTS screenings against influenza virus 6, 17 , severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) 18 , arenaviruses 19 , and Reovirus (Bluetongue virus) 5 .",

These hits, although identified with antiviral activity, need further confirmation to reveal their potentials to become a drug. Antiviral efficacy of a compound could be revealed through the analysis via EC 50 , CC 50 and SI 50 value using the dose response analysis. Meanwhile, out off-target or false positives will be identified, and the number of lead compounds could be narrowed down. Via this analysis, the order of compound potencies and toxicities could be ranked to direct future antiviral drug discovery, especially for the structure-activity relationship (SAR) analysis and future medicinal chemistry modification. In fact, compound C052 was a derivative of compound C003, which associated with good drug-like properties both in vitro and in vivo.",

Various assays have been developed of particular antivirals, i.e. to not only inhibit the target but to have acceptable solubility, permeability, protein binding, selectivity, metabolism and toxicity profiles. Since MoA studies were low-throughput assay needing laborious efforts, only a few selected molecules, with potent EC 50 , high CC 50 and high SI 50 value, could be readily analyzed. An understanding the MoA of a compound at this stage can add depth to the interpretation of cellular activity or its absence. The ToA study is designated to narrow down the stage when the antiviral interacts with viral or host targets. Knowing a compound is competitive with a substrate in certain stage viral life-cycle could provide an immediate direction for further MoA analysis. Alternatively, more potent cell based assay with known mechanism, including assay directly screen for HIV-1 integrase inhibitors 20 , inhibiting virus binding to surface protein 21 could be used which provide known MoA before actual screenings 22 . While hits from these screening may well-related to the designated MoA, there actually MoA may also need to subject to ToA and other mechanism of action studies.",

Mix the compound five times using 8-channel semi-automatic pipette to a concentration of 25 \u03bcM. 5. Using 8-channel semi-automatic pipette, transfer 20 \u03bcl mixture in 2 nd column to the next column (3 rd ), mix well to form a concentration of 12.5 \u03bcM. Repeat this process by transferring 20 \u03bcl mixture from 3 rd column to the next column (4 th ) to form another two-fold dilution with a concentration of 6.25 \u03bcM. Repeat this two-fold serial dilution till the 11 th column. Aspirate and discard 20 \u03bcl of the mixture in 11 th column after adding and mixing the compound. 6. Add BTV-10, based on MOI of 0.01, to each well from column 2 to column 11 with a volume of 5 \u03bcl/well. After adding the virus, the final compound concentration in each column should be: 20 \u03bcM in column 2, 10 \u03bcM in column 3, and continued with a two-fold dilution down to column 11 with a final concentration of 0.04 \u03bcM. 7. Add 5 \u03bcl of medium to column 1 as cell only control (positive) and 5 \u03bcl/well of BTV to column 12 as BTV infection only control (negative). 8. Dilute compounds to an initial concentration of 200 \u03bcM for cytotoxicity assay. Similarly, add 25 \u03bcl/well of compound to column 2 and mixed 5x with 8-channel semi-automatic pipette to a concentration of 100 \u03bcM. Do not add BTV. 9. Carry out the two-fold series dilution by aspirating 25 \u03bcl from column 2 to the neighboring column 3, and continued till the last column(12   th    ). At column 12, after mixing, aspirate and discard 25 \u03bcl of mixture. The final concentration at column 2 should be 100 \u03bcM and the 12 th column should be at 0.2 \u03bcM.
