RA executes this mission by ensuring regulatory compliance regarding critical medical countermeasures against potential threats from natural, chemical, biological, radiological, or nuclear (CBRN) events. To enable rapid and effective response during emergency events that require appropriate use of medical countermeasures, many of which are only available through CDC, RA is responsible for ensuring that appropriate regulatory mechanisms such as Investigational New Drug (IND) applications, Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) requests, and Investigational Device Exemptions (IDEs) required for deployment and use of medical countermeasures are in place. RA also provides regulatory expertise to CDC subject matter experts and principal investigators regarding use of medical products (e.g., drugs, biologics, devices) for both nonresearch and research purposes.",

            "text": "Following the attacks of September 11, 2001, and the 2001 anthrax events, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) increased efforts for the procurement and development of medical countermeasures for CBRN threats. Consequently, CDC's role as the lead agency responsible for preparedness and response to public health emergencies involving bioterrorism Category A agents (e.g. smallpox, botulism, anthrax, plague, viral hemorrhagic fevers, tularemia) and other emerging public health threats (e.g. avian influenza, 2009 pandemic influenza A [H1N1], monkeypox, severe acute respiratory syndrome) also expanded. One of the notable expansions has been the management of medical countermeasures for these CBRN and emerging threats. The medical countermeasures stockpiled in CDC's Strategic National Stockpile consist of drugs, biologics, and devices. These medical countermeasures can be used for the treatment, mitigation, or prevention of serious or life-threatening conditions/diseases resulting from CBRN or other potential public health threats. Many of these medical countermeasures are considered investigational products (i.e., unapproved products or unapproved uses of approved products) by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Moreover, additional medical countermeasures for CBRN and public health threats that are under development or are being considered for procurement are investigational and are not anticipated to have FDA approval prior to stockpiling. Therefore, these investigational medical countermeasures require FDA-regulated mechanisms such as IND applications, IDE applications, EUA requests, or other FDA-regulated applications for receipt into stockpile and for deployment and use in response to a potential or actual public health event. As a result of this expansion, it became essential for CDC to prepare and submit, in a timely manner, high-quality IND and IDE documents to FDA. RA is the entity within CDC responsible for centralizing and ensuring CDC's consistency in submissions and communications with FDA. RA fulfills its responsibilities of ensuring appropriate regulatory mechanisms for stockpiling, deployment, and use of investigational medical countermeasures. Additionally, RA ensures compliance with laws and regulations (applicable parts under Code of Federal Regulations Title 21) enforced by FDA, which are delivered through the specific activities of but not limited to coordinating, drafting, reviewing, submitting, and maintaining the applications regulated by FDA [e.g., IND, IDE, EUA, 510(k)]. These activities ensure that the deployment and use of Strategic National Stockpile investigational medical countermeasures and other medical countermeasures only available through CDC (e.g., therapeutics for rare diseases in the United States such as parasitic and tropical diseases) adhere to FDA regulations.",

Consequently, RA convened with Subject Matter Experts in the CDC Emergency Operations Center to initiate and develop five EUA requests. Each EUA request required submission of an executive summary, which includes a justification for clinical use, a fact sheet for health care providers, and a fact sheet for patients and parents/caregivers. The declaration of a public health emergency involving 2009 H1N1 was made by the Secretary of HHS on April 26, 2009. In the span of 48 hours, RA submitted the five EUA requests that were authorized by FDA for emergency use: N95 respirators (various models), oseltamivir capsules and oral suspension (Tamiflu-Hoffman-La Roche), zanamivir inhalation powder (Relenza-GlaxoSmithKline), and two CDC-developed diagnostic devices. The EUAs issued by the FDA Commissioner allowed the initial deployment of 25% pro rata of Strategic National Stockpile products to affected states in order to augment the state supply of these medical countermeasures 1 and allowed CDC to distribute the diagnostic devices to public health and other qualified laboratories. Furthermore, the FDA-authorized fact sheets provided tangible education materials to health care providers and recipients for each medical countermeasure used.",

If respirators are used for people performing work-related duties, employers must comply with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's Respiratory Protection Standard (29 CFR 1910.134; see www.osha.gov for more information). The EUAs for oseltamivir and zanamivir allow the approved products to be used for unapproved indications. The EUAs allow these products to be used in patients who are symptomatic for more than 2 days and in patients who have complicated illness requiring hospitalization. The EUA for oseltamivir also extended product use to include an unapproved population by authorizing and providing dosing recommendations for pediatric patients younger than 1 year of age. Additionally, given the potential product shortage, the EUAs allowed extended use of certain lots of oseltamivir and zanamivir products beyond their labeled expiry dates based on FDA review of supportive stability and potency data (additional details regarding expired product available at www. In addition to the development and submission of the above EUA requests, RA created the CDC EUA website (www.cdc.gov/ h1n1flu/eua) to provide essential information relating to FDAissued EUAs and to organize all of the EUA-related materials for educating outside audiences such as state/local health de-SPECIAL FEATURE PHARMACISTS AND REGuLATORy AFFAIRS AT CDC partments, health care personnel, and the general public about EUAs.
