The development of a vaccine against a pathogen that typically escapes immune surveillance, such as P. falciparum has proven to be a difficult bioengineering challenge. The parasite has evolved a way to present important functional proteins, i.e., ones that may be involved in host cell recognition or invasion, in such a manner as not to be very immunogenic. The quagmire for the vaccinologist is to not only identify and manufacture the proteins or epitopes but to present them in the correct conformation, so as to overcome immunological tolerance and provoke functional (growth inhibitory) immunity. The most effective recombinant malaria vaccine candidate to date is \"RTS,S\", a vaccine that is based on the circumsporozoite protein (CSP) of P. falciparum sporozoite, the parasite stage that mosquitoes inject into humans (1) . Yet in clinical trials and large phase 3 field challenge Financial and competing interests disclosure P Burkhard is the founder, co-owner and CEO of Alpha-O Peptides AG, a company involved in nanoparticle vaccine design. He is also a Research Professor at the University of Connecticut and along with DE Lanar has received NIH funding for the malaria vaccine project (5R01AI068761). The authors have no other relevant affiliations or financial involvement with any organization or entity with a financial interest in or financial conflict with the subject matter or materials discussed in the manuscript apart from those disclosed. studies it is not more than ~50% effective (2) (3) (4) . We believe that the final realization of the CSP's true potential requires that the epitopes be optimally displayed and formulated to elicit responses that are even more strongly immunogenic and, ultimately, highly protective.",

Nano-sized lipid-or polymer-based particles have been designed to improve drug delivery, and liposomes, virosomes, virus-like particles (VLPs) or polymeric beads have been used for vaccination, protein separation and even blood cell substitutions (5-7). Synthetic peptides alone have been used as vaccine candidates but they are usually not sufficiently immunogenic and adjuvants need to be included to enhance their immunogenicity. However, the numbers of adjuvants that can be used in human is limited, and a critical need exists for novel delivery vehicles capable of eliciting sufficiently strong humoral and cellular immune responses. Such crucial vaccine components could facilitate the development of novel vaccines for viral, bacterial and parasitic infections (8, 9) . To generate a potent vaccine, the most conserved and protective B-and T-cell epitopes should be combined into a highly immunogenic epitope delivery and presenting system. However, their combination into a linear peptide sequence, a so-called epitope string, is not sufficient. Linear peptides have proven poor immunogens, they cannot present conformation specific epitopes and are rapidly degraded. Branched peptide presentation as practiced with multiple antigenic peptides (MAP) for malaria was very immunogenic but the process for manufacture was not reproducible (10, 11) . On the other side, promising vaccination approaches using whole sporozoite as immunogens have recently been shown to induce protective immune responses in humans (12) .",

            "text": "In the past decade we have developed a technology to control the ability of peptides and proteins to self-assemble into particles of well-defined size and shape to design mechanically and chemically stable nanoparticles. In a highly innovative and novel approach, using the background of structural biology, biophysics and computational protein design, we have designed epitope strings that self-assemble into so-called self-assembling protein nanoparticles (SAPNs). This was first presented in Raman et al. (13) and relies on a protein chain made of two coiled coils connected by a short linker region. The association between the coiled coils forces self-assembly of the monomers into a roughly spherical nanoparticle. The resemblance of the peptide nanoparticles to virus capsids combines the strong immunogenic effect of live attenuated vaccines with the purity and high specificity of peptide-based vaccines in eliciting immune responses. The potential for these SAPNs to serve as a platform for vaccines is apparent beyond their ability to repetitively present antigens. As opposed to live attenuated vaccines, SAPN-derived vaccines pose no risk of infection. They also offer significant advantages compared to VLPs. They are very versatile and flexible in their in design leading to better biophysical and immunological properties. Furthermore, the ease and speed of protein expression, purification, and self-assembly into nanoparticles reduces cost and time of large-scale production. This concept has been successfully used to design malaria (8, 9) , SARS (14) , influenza (15), HIV (16) and toxoplasmosis (17) vaccine candidates, or to induce a strong antibody immune response against the poorly antigenic protein actin (18) . We believe the SAPN technology that displays parasite unique epitopes in a much higher percentage (50-80%) per particle will Burkhard induce a more functional immune response than is now achieved by RTS,S that contains only 14% parasite specific sequences.",

We have shown that the SAPN platform could optimally display both B and T cell epitopes of P. falciparum to produce a vaccine that is an antigen with self-adjuvanting qualities and thus induce a potent protective immune response without the need for a heterologous immuno-stimulator (8, 9) . We have verified this hypothesis and shown that this is true in the mouse model. The SAPN were initially designed to display short peptide B-and T-cell epitopes on their surface (i.e., fused to the N-and/or C-termini) or inserted within these coiled-coil domains. To this end data developed in our laboratories over the last 6 years have shown that a SAPN vaccine with epitopes analogous to those in RTS,S could stimulate high titer, high avidity antibodies and present CD8 + T-cell epitopes to stimulate IL-2 and INF\u03b3 producing long-term memory T-cells (8, 9) . The result in our mouse model was a long lasting, sterile protective immune response without the need for an adjuvant. However, further passive immunization and challenge studies in mice using sera from immunized primates seems to indicate that an adjuvant may be needed, as only immunization of the primates with adjuvant resulted in complete protection of the mice (unpublished results).",
