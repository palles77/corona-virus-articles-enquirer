MPMNs were identified in 7.0% (121/1,724 cases) of patients undergoing lung resection and were more common in elderly women than in men (Mizutani et al., 2009 ). MPMNs, initially described as pulmonary tumours resembling chemodectomas, have been recognized as a tumour-like disease consisting of epithelioid nests or whorls in a Zellballen-like arrangement centred on small veins (Korn et al., 1960; Ionescu et al., 2004) . Diffuse pulmonary meningotheliomatosis (DPM), which diffusely presents as multiple MPMNs in both lungs, is a rare pulmonary disease in man (Suster and Moran, 2007; Mora et al., 2013; Huang et al., 2015) . DPM is difficult to distinguish from infectious diseases, such as tuberculosis and metastatic tumours, presenting as diffuse millet-sized nodules in the lungs on computed tomography (CT). MPMNs and DPM have not been described in domestic animals to date. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of diffuse pulmonary meningotheliomatosis in a dog.",

Serial sections were subjected to immunohistochemistry (IHC) using the labelled streptavidinebiotin method and the primary antibodies listed in Supplementary Table 1 . The sections were treated with 0.03% H 2 O 2 in 33% methanol at room temperature for 30 min to block endogenous peroxidase, followed by antigen retrieval. Labelling was 'visualized' by adding 3, 3 0 -diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride as chromogen and counterstaining with haematoxylin. The primary antibodies were validated through positive reactions with appropriate normal tissue control sections and negative reactions when normal mouse or rabbit immunoglobulin G was substituted for antibody. For electron microscopical examination, small pieces of formalin-fixed pulmonary tissue were re-fixed in 1% osmium tetroxide followed by 0.2 M phosphate buffer and then embedded in epoxy resin.

The proliferating cells observed in the present case resembled those in MPMN and DPM in man, including the expression of vimentin and the presence of intracyto-plasmic processes and desmosomes (Gaffey et al., 1988; Pelosi et al., 2002; Suster and Moran, 2007) . However, the cellular origin of MPMNs and DPM remains unclear. Several studies revealed similarities with meningothelial cells on the basis of immunohistochemical and ultrastructural findings (Gaffey et al., 1988; Suster and Moran, 2007) . In contrast, Torikata and Mukai (1990) reported MPMNs with myosin expression, supporting a myogenic origin. In MPMNs and DPM, vimentin, PR and epithelial membrane antigen (EMA) are useful markers for immunohistochemically characterizing the proliferating cells of the nodules (Gaffey et al., 1988; Suster and Moran, 2007) . Unfortunately, in the present study, the commercial antibody against EMA did not cross-react with the protein in the canine pulmonary tissue. This case should be distinguished diagnostically from metastatic tumours, including intracranial meningioma and non-neoplastic multiple proliferative lesions, including sarcoidosis, inflammatory pseudotumour, micronodular pneumocyte hyperplasia and proliferating mesothelial cells. Intracranial meningioma with pulmonary metastasis has been reported in three dogs, which presented with clinical signs including ataxia and seizures (Schulman et al., 1992) . In the present case, metastatic meningioma was excluded owing to the presence of respiratory signs, the absence of neurological signs, the lack of enlarged pulmonary lymph nodes on CT, the presence of lung nodules and a low proliferative activity index, although CT imaging of the head and neck was not performed. Primary meningioma arising from the lungs as described in man has not been reported in dogs. Sarcoidosis, the lesions of which predominantly comprise of epithelioid macrophages with lymphocytes, is a systemic granulomatous disease of undetermined aetiology (Nunes et al., 2005) . Inflammatory pseudotumours form nodules comprised of various cell populations, including macrophages, plasma cells and fibroblasts (Matsubara et al., 1998) . Micronodular pneumocyte hyperplasia is a papillary proliferation of type II alveolar epithelial cells expressing CK and EMA and it is observed in the lungs of patients with nodular sclerosis (Maruyama et al., 2001) . Microvilli, in addition to desmosomes and cytoplasmic processes, are observed in the proliferating mesothelial cells (Hjelle et al., 1989) . Therefore, these differential diagnoses were excluded in the present case.",

            "text": "The cells comprising MPMNs and DPM resemble meningothelial cells on the basis of their immunohistochemical and ultrastructural features (Gaffey et al., 1988; Suster and Moran, 2007) . MPMNs have been considered to be the result of reactive proliferation, because a polyclonal Pulmonary Meningotheliomatosis in a Dog population, in addition to a monoclonal population, was confirmed via clonality analysis based on an X-chromosome-linked polymorphic marker, the human androgen receptor gene (Niho et al., 1999) . Conversely, in DPM, loss of heterozygosity is frequently detected in various chromosomal loci, such as 1p, 3p, 9p, 10q, 17p and 22q, triggering inactivation of tumour suppressor genes, including VHL, p16, p53 and NF2, suggesting the transition between reactive and neoplastic proliferation or the acquisition of neoplastic proliferation capacity (Ionescu et al., 2004) . The mean Ki67 index of MPMNs, denoting proliferative activity, is 0.38% (range, 0.3e0.5%, six cases), while that of DPM is <2% (Pelosi et al., 2002; Gleason et al., 2016) . However, the microscopical features of neoplastic transformation, such as arterial emboli and infiltration into the bronchioles of the proliferating cells and the higher Ki67 index of meningothelial-like cells, have been not described in human DPM. In the present case, microscopical findings indicating a malignant tumour were observed, suggesting sarcomatous transformation of proliferating cells, although genetic aberration analysis was not performed in this study. The pathogenesis of MPMNs has suggested an association with circulatory disturbance and hormones (Korn et al., 1960; Zak and Chabes, 1963; Pelosi et al., 2002) . MPMNs are detected incidentally in resected lungs or at autopsy and are recognized with pulmonary tumours and pulmonary hypertension caused by perivascular nodules (Korn et al., 1960; Zak and Chabes, 1963; Niho et al., 1999; Mizutani et al., 2009) . However, treatment specific to MPMNs is not available. In addition, the proliferating meningothelial-like cells of MPMNs express PR, suggesting sex steroidmediated control of the cell growth (Gaffey et al., 1988; Pelosi et al., 2002; Suster and Moran, 2007) . The significance of the absence of PR expression in the present case remains unclear. In human DPM, there are various clinical signs such as breathlessness, although some cases can be asymptomatic, indicating that symptoms may be dependent on the size and number of nodules (Suster and Moran, 2007; Mora et al., 2013) . In contrast, diffuse multiple nodules arising from all parts of the lungs, as observed in the present case, have not been described in human patients. It is difficult to distinguish between inflammatory disorders, including non-neoplastic proliferative lesions and neoplastic lesions, via CT and microbiological examination. Therefore, histopathological examination may be necessary for a definitive diagnosis of MPMNs and DPM.",
