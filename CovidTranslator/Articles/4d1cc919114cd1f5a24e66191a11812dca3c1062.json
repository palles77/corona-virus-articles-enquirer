            "text": "The live equine infectious anemia virus (EIAV) vaccine strain EIAV DLV121 was developed by in vitro attenuation of a virulent strain, EIAV LN40 , in the 1970s, and it has been demonstrated to induce protective immunity under laboratory and natural EIAV infection conditions. The detailed biological features of this attenuated virus remain to be further investigated. Experimental inoculation with EIAV DLV121 did not result in clinical symptoms even with immunosuppressive treatment in our previous studies. Here, we further investigated whether the replication of the vaccine strain EIAV DLV121 in experimentally infected horses causes histopathological lesions to develop in the targeted organs. Both the lungs and the spleen have been demonstrated to support EIAV replication. By evaluating the gross macroscopic and histological changes, we found that EIAV DLV121 did not cause detectable histopathological lesions and that it replicated several hundred times more slowly than its parental virulent strain, EIAV LN40 , in tissues. Immunochemical assays of these tissues indicated that the primary target cells of EIAV DLV121 were monocytes/macrophages, but that EIAV LN40 also infected alveolar epithelial cells and vascular endothelial cells. In addition, both of these viral strains promoted the up-and down-regulation of the expression of various cytokines and chemokines, implicating the potential involvement of these cellular factors in the pathological outcomes of EIAV infection and host immune responses. Taken together, these results demonstrate that the EIAV vaccine strain does not cause obvious histopathological lesions or clinical symptoms and that it induces a unique cytokine response profile. These features are considered essential for EIAV DLV121 to function as an effective live vaccine.",

            "text": "Equine infectious anemia (EIA), which is caused by equine infectious anemia virus (EIAV), is a worldwide disease of equids that is often endemic (Cook et al., 2013; Leroux et al., 2004) . Persistent infection can occur in horses, characterized by recurring cycles of viremia and clinical symptoms, including fever, anemia, ventral edema, thrombocytopenia and general wasting (Leroux et al., 2004) . Most EIAV-infected horses typically experience a classical disease process, which is divided into three stages, including acute, chronic and asymptomatic stages (Cook et al., 2013; Leroux et al., 2004) . Published studies have consistently confirmed that during the acute phase, persistent replicative sites of EIAV are macrophage-rich tissues, including the spleen, bone marrow, liver, kidney and lymph nodes. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and other tissues contain fewer viruses in horses infected with the wild-type virulent strain EIAV Wyo (Kono et al., 1971; Sellon et al., 1992) . The primary target cells for EIAV replication are of the monocyte/macrophage lineages. Macrovascular endothelial cells can also be infected during the acute stage (Harrold et al., 2000; Maury et al., 1998; Oaks et al., 1999) . However, during the asymptomatic stage, although the spleen and liver have low levels of viral replication, the virus is usually undetectable in PBMCs and other tissues of horses infected with the weakly virulent tissue cultureadapted strain EIAV PV (Harrold et al., 2000) . In addition, viral mRNA has been found in tissue macrophages during the asymptomatic stage . Therefore, there are differences in the tissue distribution and cellular tropism between the acute and asymptomatic phases of EIAV infection.",

These results demonstrate that this long-term unapparent or asymptomatic state is reversible. However, the same approach of immunosuppression did not induce either a significant boost in the plasma viral load or active EIA in horses infected with an attenuated EIAV vaccine strain (Ma et al., 2009; Shen and Wang, 1985) . The above results suggests that the live EIAV vaccine strain has a unique biological features. Tissue or cell tropism is an important characteristic of viruses that affects their pathogenesis. It is therefore of interest to examine whether the cellular tropism and replication of this vaccine strain in tissues are different from those of other EIAV strains.",

            "text": "The abnormal expression of cytokines and chemokines has been demonstrated in infections with lentiviruses, including human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1), feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) and simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV), and has been shown to contributes to systemic tissue damage (Biancotto et al., 2007; Qin et al., 2010; Scott et al., 2011) . The expression levels of IL-2 and IL-15 have been reported to be increased in lymphoid tissues in chronic HIV-1 infection, resulting in lymphadenopathy (Biancotto et al., 2007) . A study of FIV-infected cats has demonstrated that cytokine dysregulation in early-and late-term placentas dramatically impacts pregnancy outcome and that the viral load during late pregnancy is positively correlated with IL-6 expression (Scott et al., 2011) . In addition, SIV infection alters the chemokine networks and local immune environments in the lungs, which are critical to the outcome of viral infection (Qin et al., 2013) . The pulmonary symptoms associated with SIV infection are closely associated with the increased expression of MCP-1 and CXCL10 in the lungs of rhesus macaques (Qin et al., 2010) . EIAV infection also results in interstitial pulmonary pathology similar to that observed in HIV-infected children (Doffman and Miller, 2013) , SIV-infected macaques (Qin et al., 2010) and FIV-infected cats (Bolfa et al., 2013; Cadore et al., 1997) . In vitro infection of primary monocytes/macrophages also induces the differential expression of several cytokines (e.g., IL-1\u2423, IL-1\u2424, IL-4, IL-10, IFN-\u2423 and TNF-\u2423) and chemokines (e.g., IL-8, MCP-1, MCP-2, MIP-1\u2423, MIP-1\u2424 and IP-10) between the EIAV virulent strain EIAV LN40 and the vaccine strain EIAV DLV121 (Lin et al., 2011) . However, little is known about the cytokine responses in tissues from EIAV LN40 -or EIAV DLV121 -infected horses.",

To determine the differentially expressed target genes in the horses infected with either EIAV DLV121 or EIAV LN40 , the fold changes in cytokine expression levels from the tissues of the EIAV-infected horses were compared to those of uninfected horses, which served as the calibrator, as calculated using the 2 \u2212 CT method (Abel et al., 2002) .",

Horses infected with EIAV exhibit typical clinical symptoms when the circulating viral load reaches 10 7 copies/ml or higher (Cook et al., 2003) . Therefore, we detected the EIAV RNA copy numbers in the indicated tissues to evaluate their correlations with the pathological changes in these tissues. To compare the cell-associated viral RNA levels in the tissues between the EIAV DLV121 -infected and EIAV LN40 -infected horses, viral RNA was quantified by qRT-PCR. Viral RNA was detected in the lungs and spleens of all three EIAV DLV121 -inoculated horses in Group A, with mean levels of 1.1 \u00d7 10 3 and 2.8 \u00d7 10 3 viral copies/g total RNA, respectively (Fig. 3A ). The mean viral RNA level in the PBMCs was significantly higher (1.2 \u00d7 10 4 viral copies/g of total RNA) (Fig. 3A ). Significant differences were observed in the viral loads between the PBMCs and the lungs for Group A (P < 0.01). However, in the EIAV LN40 -infected horses (Group B), the mean viral RNA levels were 4.4 \u00d7 10 5 and 2.0 \u00d7 10 6 copies/g total RNA in the lungs and spleens, respectively, and a higher level (6.5 \u00d7 10 6 viral copies/g of total RNA) was observed in the PBMCs (Fig. 3B) . Furthermore, there were no significant differences in the viral loads among the tissues of Group B. However, the viral RNA levels in the lungs, spleens and PBMCs of the EIAV LN40 -infected horses were significantly higher than those of the EIAV DLV121 -infected horses (P < 0.01 for all three). To confirm the virus replication in the lungs and spleens of the EIAV DLV121 -inoculated horses, nested PCR was performed to amplify the viral transcripts, including gag, pol and env. The three transcripts were clearly detected in the lung and spleen tissues from all EIAV-infected horses ( Fig. S1A and B) . These results indicated that viral RNAs of both the vaccine and virulent strains were most likely present in their full-length forms in the tissues, suggesting the synthesis of viral genomes. None of the negative control animals tested positive for viral RNA.",

In the EIAV LN40 -infected group, IL-6 was positively correlated with the viral RNA copy numbers (r = 0.660, P = 0.003), but two cytokines, IFN-\u2424 (r = \u22120.689, P = 0.002) and IL-1\u2424 (r = \u22120.687, P = 0.002), were negatively correlated (Table 2 ). In addition, chemokines mediate cell migration and the recruitment of leukocytes, which process and secrete cytokines and chemokines, which regulate distinct intracellular signaling events (Baggiolini, 1998; Rollins, 1997) .

            "text": "In this study, we observed that the excessive responses of several cytokines were associated with a high level of proliferation of the pathogenic strain EIAV LN40 and multiple severe organ lesions. These cellular factors were mainly proinflammatory cytokines, antiviral factors and chemokines, primarily including IL-6, IL-8, IFN-\u2423, IFN-\u2424, CXCL10 and CXCL12. IL-6 and IL-8 (also called CXCL8) are both pro-inflammatory cytokines that attract and activate immunocytes, including T cells, B cells and phagocytes (Baggiolini and Clark-Lewis, 1992; Wong et al., 1988) . Although they have important roles in inducing and regulating immune protection to invade microbes, these two cytokines, particularly IL-6, are largely involved in the development of lesions caused by overactive immune responses, such as those observed in infections of influenza virus (Cill\u00f3niz et al., 2009; de Jong et al., 2006) , HIV-1, SIV and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus (Imai et al., 2008; Mukura et al., 2012; Roberts et al., 2004) . IFN-\u2423 and IFN-\u2424, which are both type I interferons that trigger potent innate immune responses in host defense systems (Isaacs and Lindenmann, 1957) , play important roles in antiviral, antibacte- 17.0 \u00b1 9.7 1.2 c \u00b1 0.6 1.5 c \u00b1 0.6 4.7 \u00b1 0.9 NS NS NS NS NS NS UI: uninfected.

An example of correlation analyses between cytokine mRNA expression levels and viral RNA copy numbers in tissues from EIAVDLV121-infected horses. EIAV genomic RNA and IFN-\u2423 (A) and IL-10 (B) mRNA were quantified by RT-PCR, as described in Fig. 3 . Spearman's correlation coefficients (statistically significant: 0.5 < r < 0.8) and P values (significant: P < 0.05, very significant: P < 0.01) are provided in each graph. rial and anticancer responses. IFN-\u2423/\u2424 activate immature dendritic cells and upregulate the expression of chemokine and chemokine receptors. IFN-\u2423/\u2424 have been found to regulate adaptive immunity by promoting the generation of neutralizing antibodies and enhancing T cell-dependent antibody responses. The knockout of functional type I IFN receptor in mouse models has been shown to deactivate its associated signaling pathways (Trinchieri, 2010) and to dramatically increase the severity of symptoms in virus-infected mammalian hosts (Muller et al., 1994) . In contrast, the vaccine strain EIAV DLV121 had a significantly lower replication level and induced a moderate elevation in the expression of cytokines tested in parallel compared with the pathogenic strain EIAV LN40 , except for IFN-\u2425 in the spleen and CXCL12 in the lungs. Therefore, the present results indicate that differences in EIAV pathogenicity are largely determined by differences in viral replication and the host responses in multiple organs, such as the spleen and lungs. CXCL10, also termed IFN\u2425-induced protein 10 (IP-10), is produced in response to IFN-\u2425 in monocytes, endothelial cells and fibroblasts to attract different types of immunocytes (Neville et al., 1997) . CXCL10 expression has been reported to be increased in an encephalitic brain and lungs affected directly and indirectly by infection of simian/human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV) or SIV (Sasseville et al., 1996) . CXCL10 has also been shown to be associated with the development of pneumonia and to recruit additional inflammatory cells to the lungs during viral infection (Schaefer et al., 2006; Sui et al., 2005) . Interstitial pneumonia has been reported in EIAV-infected horses, similar to SIV-infected macaques and HIV-1-infected humans (Bolfa et al., 2013) . Up-regulation of CXCL10 expression coupled with pathological damage implicate the involvement of this chemokine in the development of pneumonia associated with EIAV infection. CXCL12, also known as stromal cell-derived factor 1 (SDF1), is an anti-apoptotic chemokine, as are CCL21 and CCL25. All of these chemokines are involved in enhancing cell survival by inactivation of members of the apoptotic pathways at the post-translational level (Banas et al., 2002; Guo et al., 2005; Qiuping et al., 2004) . Down-regulation of the mRNA expression of these chemokines in the lungs and lymphoid tissues during SIV infection has been reported to contribute to the increased apoptosis of host cells (Qin et al., 2010 (Qin et al., , 2008 . The 40-and 17-fold upregulation of CXCL12 and CCL21 mRNA expression, respectively, in the EIAV LN40 -infected spleens and the 17-fold increase in CXCL12 mRNA expression in the EIAV DLV121 -infected lungs observed in this study suggest that the host response is triggered by EIAV infection to reduce cellular apoptosis.",

            "text": "The present study revealed that both the pathogenic and vaccine strains replicated in some of the host tissues, however, they caused different clinical and histopathological outcomes. It has been reported that viral tropism, which refers to the specificity of a certain virus for a particular cell (cellular tropism) or tissue type (tissue tropism), is an important factor in determining the outcome of viral infection (McFadden et al., 2009 ). Consistent with other reports (Harrold et al., 2000; Maury et al., 1998; Oaks et al., 1998 Oaks et al., , 1999 , our data demonstrated that macrophages were the primary target cells of EIAV infection and replication in the EIAV DLV121inoculated horses and that alveolar epithelial cells and vascular endothelial cells in the lungs and vascular endothelial cells in the spleen were also EIAV positive in EIAV LN40 -infected horses. Previous studies have observed that multiple consensus mutations in macrophage-and fibroblast-adapted EIAV strains during the process of in vitro attenuation, especially in the LTR (Payne et al., 1999) and env regions . The LTR region contains the transcription initiation site and thus largely determines the cellular tropism (Payne et al., 1999) . The discontinuous area in the C-terminus of the EIAV gp90 glycoprotein was identified as the binding domain of EIAV receptor Zhang et al., 2008) . Thus, it is reasonable to speculate that cellular tropism can be affected by the sequence variability among strains.",

These results are consistent with those of a study showing that the production of IFN-\u2425 in the serum, together with that of IL-2 and IL-12, are markedly increased and are maintained at a high concentration at approximately 50 dpi in horses inoculated with the vaccine strain EIAV DLV121 but that they exhibit no or a low level of up-regulation in horses infected with EIAV LN40 (Zhang et al., 2007) . It is well accepted that the expression of IFN-\u2425 is an important index of cell-mediated immunity, especially cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) responses to lentiviral infections, including HIV-1 and SIV, and that it is correlated with vaccine-induced immunity (Martins et al., 2010; Roff et al., 2014) . Furthermore, IFN-\u2425 stimulates functional polarization of monocyte-derived macrophages into the classical M1 cells, which express high levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and provide protection from viral and microbial infections (Mantovani et al., 2004; Mantovani et al., 2005) . In addition, IFN-\u2425 is a powerful inducer of programmed death-1 (PDL-1), which strongly attenuates immune reactions (Flies et al., 2011; Keir et al., 2008) . We speculate that the enhancement of IFN-\u2425 expression by the EIAV vaccine strain is involved in the protective immune response against the pathogenic strains and in the remarkable decrease in the number of inflammatory-related tissue lesions caused by EIAV infection.",

These data indicate that although the several hundred-fold higher proliferation level of EIAV LN40 largely determined the significantly higher expression levels of a panel of cytokines/chemokines, as shown in Table 1 , the differences in the sequences of double-stranded (ds)RNAs between the vaccine and pathogenic viral genomes may have had different effects on inducing the expression of some cytokines that play important roles in immune responses. In addition to the type of viral protein, the features of viral genomic materials also greatly influence intracellular signaling networks. We have previously demonstrated that compared with the similar proliferation level of the pathogenic strain, the EIAV vaccine strain induced the activation of Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) by approximately 10-fold, which is an intracellular pattern recognition receptor (PPR) that is specifically activated by dsRNA (Ma et al., 2014) . It is assumed that the vaccine vRNA copy number-dependent induction of the expression of anti-viral IFN-\u2423 and anti-inflammatory IL-10 is partly responsible for the attenu-ated virulence of EIAV DLV121 . In addition, the negatively correlation of the EIAV LN40 vRNA copy number with IL-1\u2424 expression suggests that the EIAV pathogenic strain has an inhibitory effect on this potent antiviral protein. This effect was demonstrated in the EIAV LN40 inoculated horses by the markedly increased upregulation of IL-1\u2424 expression in the lungs compared with the spleen, which is a major peripheral immune organ that harbors much more macrophages, which are the principal target cells of EIAV, and a ten-fold greater number of EIAV virions.",

The following biological characteristics of the attenuated virus may have caused the differences in pathology: (i) the relatively low copy number and stable replication status in tissues; (ii) the different cellular tropism; and (iii) differences in the induction of cytokines and chemokines, both in the expression levels and spectra. Both the attenuated virulence and the appropriate induction of cytokine responses of the EIAV vaccine strain may provide the host with sufficient time (immune maturation) to develop protective immunity elicited by the correct antigenic stimulation by the vaccine.",
