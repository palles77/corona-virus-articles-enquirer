Dorsal recumbency in conscious chickens decreases tidal volume by 40% to 50% and increases breathing frequency by 20% to 50%. 11 Birds showing signs of respiratory distress should be held upright. Respiratory compromise may be worsened in fowl by the inertial resistance of the large pectoral muscle mass to respiratory excursions of the keel. Enlarged viscera, excessive intracoelomic fat, or fluid within the coelom may compress the air sacs, reducing their effective volume and potentially leading to hypercapnia, respiratory acidemia, and death. 12 Cloacal or body core temperature can be measured. Cloacal temperature depends on body temperature and cloacal activity over time. 13 Normal range for body temperature in waterfowl is 40 C to 42 C. To read body core temperature, the probe of a thermistor thermometer should be inserted along the esophagus until it passes the thoracic inlet. 6 Normal range for core body temperature in chickens is 40.6 C to 43.0 C. 8 The body condition should be assessed and an accurate weight obtained on a gram or appropriately sized scale in order to correctly calculate potential drug dosages or to compare with previous or future weights (Fig. 2) .",

The characteristics of oxygenated and deoxygenated avian and human hemoglobin are different, resulting in underestimation of hemoglobin saturation. 16 An ultrasonic Doppler flow detector is most commonly used for cardiac monitoring but can also be used for indirect blood pressure measurement. Indirect blood pressure measurement techniques used in fowl include Doppler, photoplethysmographic/photoacoustic probes with a sphygmomanometer, and oscillometric monitors. 17 Systolic blood pressure determination via ultrasonic Doppler flow detection correlates well with direct blood pressure measurements in ducks (A platyrhynchos). 18 Diastolic, and therefore mean, blood pressure cannot be obtained with this method. 18 Direct arterial pressure measurement is ideal but not commonly used because of the need for specific technical skill, the invasive nature of the procedure, and the cost of equipment. 18 For medium to large birds (>200 g), the deep radial artery is the preferred site for arterial catheter placement, whereas for smaller birds (<200 g) the superficial ulnar artery is preferred. For waterbirds or long-legged birds, the cranial tibial or dorsal metatarsal arteries are acceptable sites for catheterization. Catheterization of the external carotid artery usually requires a cut-down for proper visualization. 19 A study performed on anesthetized Galliformes comparing glomerular filtration rate and blood pressure found that Galliformes were able to maintain their glomerular filtration rate when mean arterial pressure (MAP) ranged between 60 and 110 mm Hg. When MAP decreased to less than 50 mm Hg, chickens were unable to sustain glomerular filtration and urine output ceased. 19 Unlike chickens that have normal systolic, mean, and diastolic arterial blood pressures of 99 AE 13, 84 AE 13, and 69 AE 15 mm Hg, respectively, values for normotension are higher in other Galliformes (eg, turkeys). 18, 19 If the definition of hypotension in humans (reduction of 30% from the baseline of conscious MAPs) is extrapolated to birds, the level of blood pressure at which birds are considered hypotensive would have a tendency to be higher than that recorded in mammals, with the exception of some Galliformes and Anseriformes species. 19 Hypovolemia is treated with intraosseous or intravenous bolus administration of crystalloids (10-20 mL/kg) or colloids (5 mL/kg) until systolic pressures are restored. 20, 21 Reference blood pressure values have been determined for different species of fowl. 6, 19 Electrocardiography can be used to monitor cardiac rate and rhythm. Electrocardiographic parameters can be highly variable between fowl species, as shown by electrocardiographic studies published for several species including the chicken, turkey, quail, duck, swans, Muscovy ducks, Guinea fowl, and rock and chukar partridges. [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] Arterial blood gasometry is the gold standard for assessing the acid-base status, ventilation, and tissue perfusion. It provides essential physiologic information for patients with critical illness or respiratory disease and is vital in the correction of any metabolic respiratory disorders. 19 Detailed information about blood gases in birds has been published. 19 ",

            "text": "Sedation or anesthesia may minimize stress to fractious or painful patients. It also may aid in minimizing risk of capture myopathy in Canada geese or turkeys. 35, 36 Midazolam is increasingly used in birds to produce sedation, hypnosis, anxiolysis, anterograde amnesia, centrally mediated muscle relaxation, and anticonvulsion activity. 37 The pharmacokinetics of midazolam hydrochloride following intravenous administration at 5 mg/kg were determined in broiler chickens, turkeys, ring-necked pheasants, and bobwhite quail. 38 Several articles regarding fowl anesthesia and analgesia have been published. 5,6,39 Inhalation anesthesia with isoflurane or sevoflurane is the most common in-hospital method for anesthetizing fowl. Oxygen flow rates of 1 to 2 L/min allow rapid changes in anesthetic concentration if vaporizer setting is altered. Induction is typically via a face mask. The apnea and bradycardia that occur when an induction mask is placed over the beak and face are consequences of a stress response caused by stimulation of trigeminal nerve receptors. [40] [41] [42] Preoxygenation with 100% oxygen for several minutes reduced this response in dabbling but not diving ducks. 41 The isoflurane vaporizer is set to 3% to 4% for induction. 6 Intubation with a noncuffed endotracheal tube is recommended for anesthetic procedures lasting more than 15 minutes. Waterfowl females may require an endotracheal tube 0.5 to 1 full size larger than males of the same species. 6 If intubation is not feasible because of the nature of the procedure to be performed or anatomic structures preventing intubation (eg, presence of crista ventralis), ventilation can be achieved via air sac perfusion. 43 Airway patency should be regularly checked during waterfowl anesthesia because the thickening of mucus in the trachea or glottis may completely obstruct the endotracheal tube, leading to death of the patient. Anticholinergic drugs reduce pharyngeal and tracheal secretions but also increase their viscosity, and so are only recommended for treatment of bradycardia. 6 In chickens and ducks, isoflurane has a minimum anesthetic concentration (MAC) of 1.32% and 1.3%, respectively. 5,6 Isoflurane produces dose-dependent cardiopulmonary depression in birds and in Pekin ducks induces tachycardia and hypotension. 44 In geese, an average PaCO 2 of 53 mm Hg was necessary for spontaneous respiration to occur, and no respiration occurred with a PaCO 2 less than or equal to 40 mm Hg. 45 Intermittent positive pressure ventilation may be used in anesthetized birds, even if some spontaneous breathing is present, to ensure adequate oxygenation of the blood. 46 Ventilation is assisted manually using the reservoir bag on the breathing system or a mechanical ventilator. A spontaneously breathing bird is given greater than or equal to 2 assisted beats per minute. If an anesthetized bird is apneic, the assisted ventilation rate is greater than or equal to 8 to 15 beats per minute depending on size (large birds require fewer breaths than small birds). Analysis of blood gases showed that effective gas exchange is achieved using mechanical ventilation. 5 In chickens, sevoflurane MAC is 2.21%. At MAC, heart rate did not change significantly and cardiac arrhythmias were not observed at less than or equal to 2 times MAC. In another study in chickens, hypotension was observed during both spontaneous and controlled ventilation. However, this effect was only dose dependent during Critical Care of Commonly Kept Fowl controlled ventilation. Tachycardia occurred during spontaneous ventilation, whereas heart rate remained unchanged during controlled ventilation. 5 ANALGESIA Species variability occurs because of differences in pain sensitivity, the conscious response to pain, and the physiologic response to analgesic therapy. Dosages and effects of opioids and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs in fowl have been reviewed. 5, 6, 39 HOSPITALIZATION Many birds benefit from symptomatic treatment such as oxygen supplementation, nebulization, fluid therapy, broad-spectrum antibiotics, antifungals, and/or nutritional support and observation for 2 to 8 hours in a warmed incubator before diagnostic tests are performed. 15 Separate equipment and housing should be used for birds with suspected contagious diseases and all equipment and cages should be thoroughly disinfected after use to minimize the risk of disease transmission. 15 The optimum temperatures for ill birds are 29.4 C to 32.1 C.",

Recommendations for fluid resuscitation after severe blood loss in birds have included the administration of crystalloids, colloids, and whole blood. Although no statistical difference in mortality was appreciated among the 3 fluid resuscitation groups (crystalloids, hetastarch, or a hemoglobin-based oxygen-carrying solution [HBOCS]) in the acute blood loss study, a trend of decreased mortality was observed in the HBOCS group. An early regenerative response was apparent following acute blood loss. 48 Trauma Traumatic injuries occur fairly frequently in fowl kept outdoors, either as a result of predator attack, gunshot, electrocution, or as a result of inappropriate housing. A thorough physical examination is essential to determine the extent of trauma and the best approach for treatment. Prioritize therapy (oxygen therapy, fluid therapy, and analgesia), control active hemorrhage, cleanse wounds, and stabilize fractures initially until patient stabilization allows a more specific treatment. Any animal that has a bite wound should be provided with antibiotics after a sample has been taken for microbiological culture and sensitivity.",

Common sources of Aspergillus are contaminated food and moldy substrates. Clinical signs might include dyspnea, but it can present as lethargy, anorexia, and significant weight loss. Diagnosis and treatment present similar challenges to those faced in other avian species. Treatment is based in antifungal therapy, often an azole drug, together with supportive care.",

In poultry, infection is often systemic, and occasionally fatal. Clinical signs, incubation periods, morbidity, and mortality vary widely depending on the virulence of the strain infecting the flock. Common clinical signs observed with chlamydiosis are sinusitis, rhinitis, diarrhea, and weakness. Postmortem findings in affected birds include splenomegaly, hepatomegaly, airsacculitis, pericarditis, and peritonitis. 67, 68 In turkeys, the disease pattern differs from other species and tends to present as an explosive outbreak. 69 Clinical signs can be aggravated by concurrent infections, such as Salmonella or Pasteurella. Ideally, a combination of serology and PCR identification is used to diagnosis chlamydia. However, after adequate therapy, there is no currently available test to ascertain whether affected birds are no longer carriers; therefore, treatment should be carefully considered, because of its zoonotic risk, especially in collections open to the public. 61 Chlortetracycline (1000 ppm; ie, 18.2 g/kg food daily for 45 days) has been recommended in turkeys, although doxycycline (25 mg/kg PO twice a day or 240 ppm in food daily for 45 days; or 50-100 mg/kg IM weekly on 6 occasions) is also used in outbreaks to reduce mortality in turkeys as well as in other species. 64, 70 Avian tuberculosis can present as a respiratory emergency when lesions are localized in the pharynx or trachea.",

However, there is no treatment of affected birds and euthanasia should be considered in unvaccinated suspicious cases. Early vaccination (within the first 3 days of hatching) does not stop infection (the virus is considered ubiquitous worldwide) but achieves more than 90% protection under commercial conditions. 76 Lead poisoning is thought to be one of the most significant causes of neurologic disease in waterfowl. 77 A recent report estimated between 50,000 and 100,000 (approximately 1.5%-3.0% of the wintering population) wildfowl deaths each winter are caused by lead poisoning. That number represents a quarter of all recorded deaths regarding migratory swans. 78 Not only waterfowl are affected by this, because other terrestrial game birds and fowl may ingest lead pellets that they mistake for grit or food; lead pellets may be buried in mud, in areas where fishing or hunting has previously taken place. Animals can experience chronic intoxication when ingesting small numbers of lead pellets intermittently, but can also present acutely and in the form of an outbreak when reduced water levels or other circumstances expose lead that was previously unavailable. In the United Kingdom, the sale and use by fishermen of lead leger weights and split shot weighing less than 28 g has been banned since 1987. 79 Since then, the incidence of lead poisoning has reduced significantly. 80 However, the environmental contamination will still have an effect for many years.",

Other common findings in chronic cases on radiographs are dilatation and impaction of the proventriculus. 79 A blood sample should always be tested for lead levels to achieve a definitive diagnosis (normal, <0.4 ppm; diagnostic, 0.5-2.0 ppm; severe, >2.0 ppm). Moderate anemia (20%-38% hematocrit) can be observed. 82 Delta amino levulinic acid dehydrase activity has been suggested as a more sensitive diagnostic indicator for lead intoxication. 83 Early treatment of lead toxicosis should include stopping any further lead absorption; lead particles within the gastrointestinal tract can be removed by lavage under general anesthesia with warm fluid via a gastric tube. 82 Some investigators recommend repeating gastric lavage within 24 to 48 hours if lead particles are still present in postlavage radiographs, because fragments of lead can be trapped in crevices in the koilin. Those particles precipitate when muscle activity has restarted. 84 Chelation therapy should be started in all affected animals.

Affected birds commonly present showing lethargy, emaciation, and esophageal or crop distension. Despite the crop/esophagus, proventriculus, and/or gizzard being full of a solid mass of interwoven fibrous material, the intestines of birds with this condition are frequently empty. 56 Poultry have been known to ingest poorly digestible items (eg, grass, newspaper, sawdust shavings/ wood chips, and feathers) out of curiosity or as a response to stress, causing crop impaction. Crop impaction is most frequently seen in spring, when chickens ingest long stems of grass that get impacted in the crop. Captive waterfowl, especially geese, suddenly exposed to new environments may ingest nondigestible items like newspaper or plant products, like grasses. Ingestion of grains that have low moisture content with concurrent exposure to water can lead to grain swelling and result in impaction of the esophagus. 93 Gizzard impaction can cause high mortality during the first 3 weeks of life in turkey flocks. 56 Although rehydration of the impaction, gentle massage or flushing (only for crop or esophageal impactions), and liquid paraffin may help to resolve the impaction in early cases, surgical intervention might be necessary (Fig. 10) .

The egg should not be manually broken or pulled, because iatrogenic damage to the oviduct may occur.
