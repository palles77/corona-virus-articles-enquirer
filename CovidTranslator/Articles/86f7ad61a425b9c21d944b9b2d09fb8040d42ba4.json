The severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-cov) outbreaks have recently raised concerns of airborne transmission in the healthcare settings [4] [5] [6] . The World Health Organization (WHO) has recommended the use of particulate filtering facepiece respirators such as N95 filtering facepiece respirator (N95 respirator) or their equivalent when HCWs treat patients with airborne infectious diseases, but facepiece respirators only work properly when the face seal is tight [1] . Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is a life-saving procedure that is frequently performed in the ED. Chest compressions, one of the main components of CPR, needs intense and dynamic movements. Previously published simulation studies showed that the N95 respirator did not provide adequate protection during chest compression [7] .",

A PAPR is a battery-powered blower that provides clean air through a canister or cartridge with filter to the different type of hoods such as tight-fitting respirator, a loose-fitting hood, or a helmet. In the medical environment, loose-fitting PAPR is mainly used because it can cover the entire face including the eye and it also does not require a fit test [9, 10] .",

Since 2015, the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) has revised its guidelines for patients with suspected MERS to use PAPR during CPR [11] . However, there is insufficient evidence on whether loose-fitting PAPRs provides and maintains a protective effect for HCWs during CPR. In addition, because PAPR is a multi-piece equipment with external connections through an unfixed tube, there are concerns about the possibility of equipment problems such as tube disconnection and fan malfunction due to intense movements during chest compression. Finally, PAPR may affect the satisfaction and performance of participants who perform chest compression.",

The manikin fit factor values of the stretched-out and improperly sized loose-fitting facepieces were significantly lower than those obtained for the undamaged facepieces; thus, the former is unlikely to provide an acceptable level of protection. They suggest that loose-fitting facepieces are properly sized to employees and remove stretched-out facepieces from the workplace. In the study of Cohen et al. [17] , they obtained SWPFs for five PAPR models representing different brands and facepiece styles. These respirators were tested on 12 volunteers performing 12 exercises to simulate real workplace activities. The SWPF range for the loose-fitting hooded PAPRs was 240 to >250,000, suggesting a high degree of protection as well as a large variance among the SWPFs.

            "text": "Loose-fitting PAPRs utilize a motorized fan to draw air through the respirator's air purifying elements, delivering clean air to the wearer through a facepiece that does not form an airtight seal with the wearer's face. There is a concern about potential risk of wearer exposure to contaminants if the breathing rate of the wearer exceeds the air flow rate supplied by the PAPR fan [9, 12] . In such an instance, ambient air could bypass the filters and enter the mask potentially exposing the wearer to contamination. Moreover, chest compressions are dynamic and fast that the inhalation flow during higher work rates could exceed the air flow supplied by the PAPR. Mackey et al. [19] measured over-breathing in one type of loosefitting PAPR. Their measurements showed that even when peak inspiratory flow rate exceeded the blower flow rate, the concentration of aerosol within the PAPR remained below 0.1% of the ambient concentration. Thus, they assumed that the hood contributed a large dead volume that acted as a buffer against inward leakage of ambient aerosol. In this study, none of In previous studies, loose-fitting PAPRs were considered more comfortable than N95 respirator because they reduce breathing effort and temperature with cool airflow and do not require a fit test, as well as have wide protection through the head, hair, eye, and neck [20, 21] .",

Forth, we performed a flow test before the simulation, but the blower flow rate in hood was not measured in real time. Moreover, the filtration efficiency of PAPRs filter was not evaluated in this study. Finally, CPR quality may be affected by the use of PAPRs. However, our study aimed to assess the effect of PAPRs on respiratory protection during chest compressions and not on the quality of the chest compressions. Therefore, we provided feedback to each participant in real time to ensure high CPR quality to reflect real-world situations.

After completing the simulation, participants were asked about the degree of comfortability to don or doff, difficulty to breathe through the PAPR, obstruction of vision, interrupting communication, skin irritation, and interference with ability. The investigators asked the participants three questions to assess the difficulty in communication during the 2-minute operation time. The investigators gave feedback to the participants in real time to maintain the participants' CPR quality during the chest compressions. Based on the above, the participants subjectively assessed the difficulty in communication or listening after the simulation.",
