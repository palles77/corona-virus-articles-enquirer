            "text": "Non-viral gene delivery is constrained by the dwell time that most synthetic nucleic acid nanocarriers spend inside endosomal compartments. In order to overcome this endosomalrelease bottleneck, methods are required that measure nanocarrier uptake kinetics and transfection efficiency simultaneously. Here, we employ live-cell imaging on single-cell arrays (LISCA) to study the delivery-time distribution of lipid-based mRNA complexes under varied serum conditions. By fitting a translation-maturation model to hundreds of individual eGFP reporter fluorescence time courses, the protein expression onset times and the expression rates after transfection are determined. Using this approach, we find that delivery timing and protein expression rates are not intrinsically correlated at the single-cell level, even though population-averaged values of both parameters conjointly change as a function of increasing external serum protein fraction. Lipofectamine mediated delivery showed decreased transfection efficiency and longer delivery times with increasing serum protein concentration. This is in contrast to ionizable lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) mediated transfer, which showed increased efficiency and faster uptake in the presence of serum. In conclusion, the interdependences of single-cell expression rates and onset timing provide additional clues on uptake and release mechanisms, which are useful for improving nucleic acid delivery. author/funder.

            "text": "Gene based therapies advance the delivery of exogenous nucleic acids with the intent to modulate the expression of disease related genes. However, clinical applications are still limited due to the difficulties inherent in delivery of nucleic acids in vivo (1, 2) . Over the last years, intense research is dedicated to develop non-viral vectors that are capable to safely and efficiently package, transport and systemically deliver nucleic acid to cells (3) (4) (5) . In particular for therapeutic purposes, there is need to deliver DNA, mRNA, small interfering RNA (siRNA) or microRNA (miRNA). The molecular and cellular processes of nucleic acid nanoparticles share common structural features and entry mechanisms. Some of the major challenges associated with current cationic lipid vectors are the interaction with blood serum components, impaired intracellular uptake, limited release into the cytosol and immunological response (6, 7) . Each of these hurdles are independently affected by variations in the lipid formulations and transfection conditions. Lipid-encapsulated RNA is taken up by various, endosomal or phagocytotic, uptake mechanisms and subsequent intracellular pathways. It appears however, that nucleic acids nanocarriers are largely trapped inside the endosomes or lysosomes and that delivery by lipid nanoparticles is limited by endocytic recycling (8) . In timeresolved fluorescence microscopy studies, the uptake and fate of delivery particles has been visualized at the single-cell level (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) . Recently, it was shown that siRNA release occurred during a narrow 'window of opportunity' showing that timing and efficiency are linked (12) . However, the uptake pathways and factors that control endosomal release of lipid-based nanocarriers are not fully resolved. In particular, the interdependence of timing and efficiency of gene delivery and the role of extracellular factors on the kinetics of cellular uptake and endosomal release are poorly understood aspects in the delivery process.",

Fitting the time courses to a translation-maturation model, we obtain best estimates for the onset time and expression rate distributions. The single-cell data reveal large cell-to-cell variability and the insight that the delivery time and expression rate do not correlate at the single-cell level. Nevertheless, both parameters change in a concerted manner as a function of external parameters such as the amount of serum. In mRNA transfection experiments using Lipofectamine lipoplexes the efficiency decreases, and delivery timing increases as a function of the fraction of serum protein.

            "text": "In order to record single-cell protein expression time courses in a highly parallel manner we employed an LISCA approach as published earlier (18) . HuH7, liver carcinoma, cells were seeded onto a microstructured cell culture channel slide (see Figure 1A ). In order to capture the very early events of protein expression the single-cell array was connected to a tailored perfusion system and scanning time-lapse data acquisition was started prior to transfection. The perfusion system allowed for fluid exchange and enabled the addition of transfection agents on the stage during the time-lapse measurement. mRNA complexes were added one hour after the beginning of the measurement and incubated for one hour. After the incubation period the transfection solution was exchanged for cell growth medium (indicated by the arrows and the gray bar in Figure 1B . Note that without the perfusion system, it is not possible to observe changes in the fluorescence intensity during and shortly after the time period of the transfection due to sample handling off the microscope. Secondly, with the use of a perfusion system, we prevent particle adsorption events after the incubation time by flushing out unbound nanocarriers. This is illustrated in Supplementary Figure 1A using fluorescently labeled lipoplexes before and after flushing. To investigate whether nanocarrier are taken up, we prepared lipoplexes containing mRNA with a Cy5 labeled fraction to visualize the lipoplexes during the time-lapse measurement. The fluorescence kinetics of the Cy5 labeled mRNAs shows the adsorption onto the cell surfaces (see Supplementary Figure 1B ). As a reference, we observed on areas with no cells that the fluorescence time courses of nanocarriers increases during the incubation period and abruptly decreases when the chamber is flushed with fresh carrier-free medium indicating that some partially adherent nanocarriers are rinsed away. Interestingly, in contrast, the fluorescence of nanocarriers adsorbed to cells not only does not decrease but increases within the next 1 hour after flushing. We interpret this time course such that firstly, nanocarriers are strongly adsorb and are not rinsed away and secondly, the fluorescence of the Cy5 labeled mRNAs is likely to increase during the time of uptake due to unpacking of the lipid-based carriers and thus dequenching the Cy5 fluorescence.",

The time t0 represents the time when translation begins and we refer to it as the onset time. The model assumes that all mRNA molecules are delivered at the same time, which clearly is a simplification. However, the time interval during which mRNA is released into the cytosol is short compared to the time scale of expression and, therefore, can be treated as a single event in time. Defining the time point of incubation as zero, the expression onset time is the period from incubation until beginning of translation, which includes all intermediated processes such as cellular uptake, release into the cytosol and unpacking of the complexes. The analytical solution to the ODEs is given in the Materials and Methods section and were used to fit the measured single-cell fluorescence time courses using least-square fitting (21). To prevent overfitting the data by using too many free parameters of the translation-maturation model we fixed the maturation rate kM and the protein degradation rate \u03b2 to the mean population values. These mean values were determined in an independent translation block experiment using cycloheximide performed within a previous study (22) . The fitting results of the model with the fixed parameters are in good agreement with the experimental data. Figure 2B shows representative single-cell time courses with the respective fits.

In the supplement we provide further details about the accuracy of the parameter estimation. In particular, we compare our model to alternative approaches that were explored but that we found less suitable (see Supplementary Figure 5 ). We analyzed the data by an automated routine, which fitted each time course by the translation-maturation model. Since maturation rate and protein degradation were fixed, the routine yields the expression onset t0, the expression rate m0kTL, and the mRNA degradation rate \u03b4. The distribution of single-cell parameters of onset times and expression rates are shown in Figure 2C . The onset time show a distribution that is slightly skewed and roughly described by a gamma function (see Supplementary Figure 3A ). Interestingly, the earliest observed onsets are as early as 10 min after incubation, while the later onset times extend too many hours. The average width of the onset time distribution measured as full width half maximum (FWHM) of the estimated distribution is about 2-3 hours. The expression rate is described by a log-normal distribution. The mRNA degradation rates \u03b4 also exhibit a distribution, an observation that will not be further discussed since it is outside the scope of this report (see Supplementary Figure 2 ).",

Using Lipofectamine in the presence of FBS, the distributions are shifted to longer onset times and lower expression level (see first plot of Figure 5 ). For cells transfected with LNPs the opposite trend is the case (see second plot of Figure 5 ), the onset times shortens and the expression level increases.

In our approach, we used the expression rate as a measure for transfection efficiency. We showed that the expression rate constant m0kTL, the product of released mRNA molecules and the kinetic translation rate, is proportional to the protein level at a defined time point after transfection, which is more frequently used as the measure for transfection efficiency (25, 26) . The proportionality can be explained because the expression rate corresponds to the slope of a straight line between the expression onset and a certain protein level i.e. 12 h after the transfection (see Supplementary Figure 6 ).",

            "text": "The delivery time distributions after mRNA transfection, are measured here for the first time at the single cell level, reveal that the delivery process occurs over a time period of only a few hours (see Figure 2C and Figure 4A ). The FWHM of the distributions fitted by Gamma distribution functions increase with increasing FBS concentration (see Supplementary Figure  3A ). This finding is in agreement with the literature that there is only a small window of opportunity for successful carrier release before the nucleic acid nanocarriers are trapped in late endosomes or lysosomes (12) . Since we apply a pulsed incubation in our experiments, with a period restricted to only an hour, the observed onset time distribution corresponds to the delivery time distribution. Note that the onset time distribution in the case of continuing lipoplex incubation exhibits a much broader and prolonged distribution (see Supplementary  Figure 7 ) Hence, absorption and uptake is a continuous process, while if mRNA loaded particles are trapped in endosomes or lysosomes they are subject to degradation and an intact release becomes less likely with time. This scenario explains why we do not observe late expression onsets in pulsed incubation. This mechanism, however, would suggest that cells with short delivery times show higher expression efficiency. However, we observed no correlation between delivery time and expression rate at the single-cell level (see Figure 4B ). This means that there is no intrinsic mechanism linking the delivery time with expression efficiency and that the expression rates' variance is independent of the delivery times' variance. However, effects induced by external changes such as the level of blood serum proteins (FBS) act on both delivery time and expression rate in a systematic manner. We found that the transfection efficiency decreases, and delivery time increases for Lipofectamine mediated transfection, while the opposite occurs for LNPs. In case of Lipofectamine unspecific protein adsorption, which leads to the formation of a protein corona on the lipoplex surface, explains this effect (27, 28) . The protein corona changes the structure and surface charge of lipoplexes, which influences the interaction between nanocarriers and cells for example during adsorption or endosomal uptake (29) . Interestingly, the protein corona has different effects on delivery time and expression rate for LNPs, where delivery shifts to faster times and higher expression rates. It is known that different nanocarrier formulations lead to different targeting of endocytotic pathways (30) to different quantities of proteins forming the corona (31). In particular LNP formulations containing ionizable lipids and dissociable PEG lipid, the serum effect has been explained by apolipoprotein E (apoE) adsorption, (32) , which has been shown to lead to increased uptake in hepatocytes via apoE receptors (33, 34) . The reason why LNPs without FBS are still able to transfect might be because HuH7 cells secret apoE resulting in a lower concentration of apoE in the medium than with FBS present (35) . We showed that protein adsorption on LNPs does not only play a role in faster delivery times but also influence the expression rates. However, similar to the Lipofectamine lipoplexes we did not observe a correlation of delivery time with expression rate for LNPs at the single-cell level.",

The translation step is followed by eGFP maturation, including folding, at rate kM before becoming fluorescent. In the three-stage model we also assume that unmaturated and maturated eGFP decay with the same decay constant as the same proteases are reported for both eGFP states (42) .",

The starting value for z is set to the median of the first ten data points in the time course. Since the measurement started before transfection, the first data points do not contain protein fluorescence but only background.
