IBV can be detected in the trachea during the first 3 to 5 days post-infection. After this period, the virus titer falls quickly in the second week [6] . We may have missed the acute infection stage when sampling slaughterhouses due to the elapsed time between the beginning of the infection and sampling. Indeed, the present prevalence is lower than that reported in previous studies in the United Kingdom and Jordan [10, 13] . The prevalence in those studies reached about 60%, because the sampled chickens exhibited respiratory signs of infection or IB was suspected during sampling. In the present investigation, the broilers may have been healthy, because they reached market age for the slaughterhouses. The phylogenetic tree constructed using the N gene sequences is shown in Fig. 1 . The Taiwanese strain could be distinguished from the other IBVs using this N gene. However, this segment could not be used to separate the Taiwan strain into its different groups, TW-I and TW-II. In order to distinguish TW-I from TW-II, we used primers located at the 5\u2032 terminus of the S gene, and the resulting phylogenetic tree could distinguish between TW-I and TW-II (Fig. 2) . There were more TW-II samples than TW-I samples in this investigation. The S1 and S7 isolates might be from the 4/91 vac-cine strain, because they were very similar (Figs. 1 and 2) .

The antisera used for this test included anti-TW-I, anti-TW-II and anti-Mass (Charles River Lab, North Franklin, CT, U.S.A.) [4] . Briefly, 100 \u00b5l of virus (containing 100 50% viral embryo infectious doses) was incubated with 100 \u00b5l of antiserum (containing 20 units) at room temperature for 1 hr. The infectivity of the virusantiserum mixture was assayed in 10 9-to-11-day-old SPF chicken embryos. After 1 week, embryos were evaluated for IBV infection by observing for death, dwarfing and urate deposition as described for virus titration. In the control groups, antisera were replaced with PBS. A virus was considered to match the serotype of the antiserum, if the antiserum protected five or more of the embryos. The results showed that the two new IBV isolates similar to Japan, S78 and TC3, were not neutralized completely with the reference antisera. The protection rates for S78 by anti-TW-I, anti-TW-II and anti-Mass were 0/10 (numbers protected/ numbers tested), 0/10 and 0/10, respectively. Those for TC3 were 1/10, 4/10 and 0/10, respectively. The results indicated that both viruses could not be neutralized by reference antisera, since their protection rates were less than 50%. Despite extensive vaccination, IB has occurred occasionally, especially in cold seasons. Most IBVs present in Taiwan are TW-I or TW-II. Surprisingly, in the present study, TW-II was more predominant than TW-I, contrary to previous reports [5, [7] [8] [9] . Furthermore, a challenging aspect of this investigation was the emergence of new types, such as the IBVs similar to strains isolated in Japan, which were found to be widespread in Taiwan since they were identified in different locations and different chicken breeds. A previous study revealed that five genotypes existed in Japan in 2010, JP-I, JP-II, JP-III, 4/91 and Mass [1] . In the present study, the IBVs that were similar to Japanese strains showed the highest similarity to JP-I. However, the origin of these isolates is unknown and needs further investigation. The current vaccine strains might not protect against these new isolates, since the one-direction neutralization tests showed less than 50% protection in chicken embryos.",
