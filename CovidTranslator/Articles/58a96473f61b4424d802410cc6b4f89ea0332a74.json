As providers assume responsibility for their diagnosis and treatment, patients have a right to expect that this will include responsibility for their safety during all aspects of care. However, increasing epidemiological data make it clear that patient safety is a global problem. Improved nursing care may prevent many adverse events, and nursing must take a stronger leadership role in this area. Although errors are almost inevitable, safety can be improved, and health care institutions are increasingly making safety a top priority. Information technology provides safety benefits by enhancing communication and delivering decision-support; its use will likely be a cornerstone for improving safety. This paper will discuss the status of patient safety from an international viewpoint, provide case studies from different countries, and discuss information technology solutions from a nursing perspective.",

The primary outcome of this study was the ''adverse event,'' defined as injuries caused by medical mismanagement resulting in disability at discharge or prolonged length of stay. Adverse events occurred in 3.7% of hospitalizations, of which 28% were judged to be due to negligence. Another US study, using the same methodology in a random sample of patients from Colorado and Utah, found adverse events in 2.9% of admissions as compared to 3.7% in the New York study [5] , suggesting that these rates are probably reasonably representative for the U.S. Data are now available from a number of large studies around the world regarding the frequency of adverse events, and essentially all of these demonstrate that adverse events are significant problems [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] . Most data so far come from the developed world. For example, the Quality in Australian Healthcare Study (QAHCS) identified an adverse event rate of 16.6% [6] . A subsequent study, comparing the adverse event rate in the QAHCS to that from the Medical Practice study, found that most of the differences in incidence were related to methodological differences between the two studies, although there was also a higher adverse event rate in Australia [7] . Vincent found that in United Kingdom, 10.7% of patients experienced one or more adverse events [8] . In New Zealand, an adverse event rate of 12.9% was identified in one study [9] . Numerous studies are currently underway in other countries, including Canada and Japan.",

For example, in Brazil, a study of 212 patients showed that among 46 patients, 80 errors had occurred relating to pressure ulcers, mechanical ventilation, IV catheters and medications [10] . Korea has no detailed data about iatrogenic accidents, such as adverse drug events, hospital infection, even though some physicians and nurses realize the importance of a systematic approach about these issues. In part for cultural reasons, iatrogenic injuries represent an especially sensitive and political issue in Korea. While the medical malpractice case rate has increased recently, and there is increasing public concern, there are still no organized systems to monitor adverse event rates. The few websites addressing iatrogenic accidents mostly focused on legal issues, such as reimbursement and insurance claims. These data make it clear that iatrogenic injury and adverse events are major international issues Moreover, many adverse events can be detected, ameliorated or prevented by nurses. For example, adverse drug events are the leading cause of injury in most studies and nurses are in an excellent position to play an active role in this area, since they administer most drugs and interact with patients and families more frequently than other providers. Pressure ulcer prevention is primarily a nursing issue. Surgical adverse events and nosocomial infections are also important. These can be both identified and, in many instances, prevented by nurses. In a study by Needleman, who looked at staffing ratios and level of outcomes for patients in a large multistate study, there was consistent evidence of an association between higher levels of staffing by registered nurses and lower rates of adverse outcomes, such as urinary tract infections, upper gastrointestinal bleeding and hospital-acquired pneumonia [11] .",

A British study suggested that adverse events were responsible for an average of 8.5 additional bed days, and resulted in a direct cost of \u00a3290,000 to the trust concerned, and the overall estimate was that preventable events cost the National Health Service approximately 1 billion pounds annually [8] .",

The rest of the time was spent primarily managing and coordinating the communication of patient information to other departments, physicians, and members of the health care team. However, time spent in managing communication and information is not sufficient to ensure a safe health care environment. Other approaches, including greatly expanded use of information and communication technology, are needed to help nurses prevent errors. The use of a Clinical Information System (CIS) can allow the staff to be more efficient and to provide more time with patients [13] .",

The agency is an independently administered, financially autonomous regulatory agency within the structure of Federal Public Administration and it is linked to the Ministry of Health. In addition to the regulatory mission, the ANVISA has created a website for health care providers and consumers to report adverse events. This includes information ranging from problems with generic medications to news updates about severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS).

In teaching about particular areas, such as medication administration, nursing faculty must include problems that can occur and how to manage them.

Dosing errors are a particularly important problem in paediatrics, and appropriate dose forms are often unavailable [28] . Increasingly, many hospitals are using computerized provider order entry (CPOE) [29] . This tool eliminates the problem of deciphering orders, and allows provision of decision support to providers. As an order is typed into the computer, it is checked for problems and, when complete, sent directly to the pharmacy for verification. This system does away with many of the steps once used to fill medication orders. It is estimated that every time an order is transcribed, a 15% chance of error is introduced [29] . The Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore, Maryland, US, instituted new guidelines for prescribing orders within their institution in 2003 [30] . If an order is written with prohibited abbreviations, the staff is instructed to ask the prescriber to discontinue that order and rewrite it without the prohibited abbreviations. Table 1 is a test that was developed so that employees can learn the new changes. Table 2 explains why certain abbreviations are incorrect and should not be used.",

These issues can have serious safety consequences. A recent study at University of Pennsylvania Hospital regarding job satisfaction among nursing staff indicated that job dissatisfaction among nurses with high patient-to-staff ratios was associated with higher patient mortality [34] . Another study by Aiken [35] on nurse satisfaction in five countries shows that nurses leave the profession when they perceive that system inefficiencies compromise the quality of care they are able to give. Nurses are looking towards IT to streamline work and reduce unnecessary and redundant activities, which may in turn allow them to spend more time with patients and have higher job satisfaction. Specific areas affected by IT are charting, care standards and medication administration. Nurses need to know that they are a significant part of the health care system. Nurse administrators and leaders are seeking ways to support their professional staff, by listening to ideas for role improvement and keeping an open line of communication with all nurses. Nurse managers need to discuss safety issues that occur on the nursing unit with their staff, as well as with the multidisciplinary team, to assess ways that errors can be reduced. Discussing journal articles or forming a ''Nursing Journal Club'' can be an effective way for sharing and promoting evidence-based practice. Asking interested nurses to be a representative on a department committee and giving them time to do so can make staff members feel appreciated and part of the process.",
