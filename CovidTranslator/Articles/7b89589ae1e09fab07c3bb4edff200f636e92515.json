Approximately 5% of our hospital beds are used as isolation facilities. Aim: To study the impact of an MRSA control bundle that was implemented via gradual geographic extension across hospital wards. Methods: The bundle included active surveillance on admission and transfer/discharge to identify ward-based acquisition of MRSA, isolation and cohorting of MRSA-infected patients, enhanced hand hygiene initiatives, and publicly displayed feedback of MRSA acquisition and hand hygiene compliance rates. Implementation was between October 2006 and June 2010 in order to provide lead-time for the incremental development of infrastructural capacity, and to develop an ethic of infection prevention among staff. Results were analysed via interrupted time-series analysis. Findings: MRSA infections fell midway through the implementation, with MRSA bacteraemia declining from 0.26 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.18e0.34] cases per 1000 inpatient-days in the first quarter of 2004 to 0.11 (95% CI: 0.07e0.19) cases per 1000 inpatient-days in the first quarter of 2012. MRSA acquisition rates fell a year after the programme had been fully implemented, whereas hand hygiene compliance rose significantly from 47% (95% CI: 44e49) in the first quarter of 2009 to 69% (95% CI: 68e71) in the first quarter of 2012.",

The Netherlands has maintained MRSA levels of <1.0% and managed outbreaks successfully using a search and destroy policy. 1 Scandinavian countries and Western Australia cite similar success stories, as has the Veteran Affairs chain of hospitals in the USA after the establishment of an MRSA bundle. 2e5 More reports from across Australia, France, and the UK have also shown significant reductions in MRSA infections in the last few years. 6e9 Effective interventions for controlling MRSA transmission in a hospital setting are well known and include active surveillance, improving hand hygiene compliance, and isolating all MRSA cases, whereas general strategies such as obtaining focused and committed hospital leadership are critical towards lowering implementation barriers and improving sustainability. 1, 4, 5, 10 Such successes are rare in Asia and parts of the world where MRSA is hyper-endemic, and where high antimicrobial resistance rates in other nosocomial bacteria result in competition for limited resources and isolation facilities e infrastructural hurdles that have been difficult to overcome. 11, 12 Estimates of the burden of MRSA in Singapore and at the National University Hospital of Singapore (NUH) have been published in separate reports which describe the issue microbiologically, and clinically. 13, 14 More than 600 MRSA infections including at least 120 bloodstream infections were previously seen per year at NUH. The sheer volume of cases coupled with infrastructural and societal constraints traditionally has hindered MRSA control efforts here. Few beds are available for contact isolation despite 42 negative pressure isolation rooms being built after the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2003. There is insufficient capacity to isolate all MRSA patients, as they constitute up to 15% of all inpatients, and prioritizing MRSA would impair the ability to isolate or cohort patients with other transmissible diseases. 15 Adding to the problem is the average daily bed occupancy rate exceeding 85% e the result of a recent, rapid population boom in Singapore.",

This consisted of swabs of nares, axillae and groin (plus any wounds) cultured on chromogenic agar MRSA Select (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Marnes-la-Coquette, France). 16 Patients not known to have MRSA had entry swabs, while those who had been in a hospital ward >48 h, had no prior positive MRSA cultures (screening or clinical) and had not died, also had exit swabs upon discharge or transfer from the ward. \u00c0 Promotion of hand hygiene. This was done primarily via educational and socio-behavioural measures. Hand hygiene education focused on the World Health Organization (WHO) 'five moments for hand hygiene', which was audited. Continuous reminders were developed, including via posters in wards, computer screensavers, and audio on ward entry. Hospital-wide training programmes ran in 2009 and annually to coincide with the WHO World Hand Hygiene Day. All frontline clinical staff had to participate in a compulsory 20 min training programme and assessment over one week on both years. A sticker placed on the staff identification tag confirmed certification. All new staff received the same programme at orientation. To further reinforce the message, the clinical examination template in the National University of Singapore final MBBS degree stipulated a deduction in marks for failed hand hygiene. 17 \u00c0 Auditing of hand hygiene compliance. This was performed primarily by appointed ward liaison nurses that had been trained by infection control nurses, supplemented and cross-checked by medical and nursing students who were engaged via innovative educational programmes in which they were trained as auditors and observed staff in their work covertly. 18 \u00c0 Isolation or cohorting of MRSA-positive patients. Such patients were placed in isolation or, more usually, in a designated cohort cubicle, established on each ward. Periodic snapshots of cohorting compliance were undertaken. A close relationship between the bed management unit and the project stakeholders was developed to facilitate the siting of MRSA-positive patients. \u00c0 Public and regular feedback of results. Data on hand hygiene compliance and MRSA acquisition were posted on ward-based 'dashboards' that had been requested by hospital administration. The signage was publicly displayed, ward-specific and updated monthly. \u00c0 Other measures included a bare-below-the-elbows policy for all clinical staff, coloured bracelets to identify all colonized and infected patients, and cash rewards (of around US$250) for exemplary performances by wards or departments with regards to hand hygiene compliance and MRSA transmission rates to enjoy a celebratory lunch or similar. \u00c0 To ensure that any progress made was primarily due to the MRSA bundle and not changes in prescribing habits, surveillance of major classes of antibiotics (fluoroquinolones, carbapenems, third or fourth generation cephalosporins and vancomycin) was undertaken from 2006 using pharmacy-based electronic data. This was expressed as defined daily doses (DDD) per 1000 inpatient-days.",

Subsequent analysis accounted for autocorrelation by modelling changes in the mean incidence or proportion as a function of time. The numbers of MRSA clinical cases and MRSA bacteraemia cases per quarter were modelled as Poisson with mean m(t) per hospital inpatient-day. Extending the model to negative binomial to account for super-Poisson heterogeneity did not improve the fit. The quarterly number of positive exit swabs among initially non-colonized patients was assumed to be binomial with proportion p(t). Both models used linear (on a log or logit scale) changes in location with time, with a single change in gradient allowed. For the number of MRSA or bacteraemia cases, the models have the form: log m\u00f0t\u00de \u00bc a \u00c0 b\u00f0t \u00c0 s\u00de 1\u00f0t>s\u00de \u00c0 g\u00f0s \u00c0 t\u00de 1\u00f0t < s\u00de where a quantifies average incidence at the temporal change point, s, while b(g) characterizes per-quarter increase (decrease) in incidence after (before) s, and 1(A) \u00bc 1 if A is true and 0 otherwise.

Data management and communication was key to sustaining the change. One full-time member of staff was appointed to collate and feed performance metrics back to ward-based healthcare workers, nurse managers, the infection control team and senior management.

The plateau seen in the data after significant gains suggests that the improvements are sustainable but that better results are unlikely in the absence of further intervention. Potential further interventions beyond those already implemented include those related to technological advancement or cutting edge research. Screening of healthcare staff was not implemented because of both operational concerns e a significant proportion of staff are likely to be colonized but it would be impossible to lay all of them off work during the period required for MRSA decolonization as well as the concern that MRSA recolonization would be common in a hyper-endemic setting. 22 Nonetheless, this will be considered in the future as MRSA rates fail to decline further. Decolonization (of patients or staff) remains controversial beyond some preoperative indications and further work in this regard is underway at our institution. It is conceivable that reducing the reservoir of MRSA may prevent transmission, and therefore infection rates. The predictable development of mupirocin resistance is of particular concern and evaluating Carbapenem use alternative agents is another priority for research in MRSA control globally.",

Whereas we used culture-based techniques, molecular testing would be more timely and sensitive, albeit it carries a risk in the regional setting of potentially missing certain MRSA strains with arginine-catabolic mobile elements (ACME) inserted into orfX, and incurring greater operational costs. 24 There are several limitations of this work. First, this was a non-randomized before-and-after study design involving a single institution. However, this is a common issue in infection control studies and not one that is easily overcome because of the nature of such studies. During this period, there was no concomitant decrease in other nosocomial antibiotic-resistant pathogens such as carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii or extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (data not shown) that would suggest an overall decline in antimicrobial resistance rates. Clinical practices also did not change substantially. Second, the nature of the intervention is such that several measures were included in a single 'bundle', and the individual effect of each measure cannot be determined. Nonetheless, such 'care bundles' are now accepted in clinical practice, and their effects are greater collectively than when introduced as separate measures. 25 In conclusion, hospitals confronting hyper-endemic MRSA with high infection rates and infrastructural and/or resource constraints can introduce sustainable improvement, provided that a proactive team including senior management leadership is driving it.
