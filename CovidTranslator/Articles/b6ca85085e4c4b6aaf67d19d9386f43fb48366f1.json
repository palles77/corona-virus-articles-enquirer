The increased levels of acute phase proteins were neither associated with any of the diseases nor with the pathogens. Random intercept linear models were used to explore factors affecting early (3-30 days) and long-term (3-200 days) growth, showing that calves with elevated serum amyloid-A concentrations at the age of 16 days had lower long-term growth. Increased albumin concentration at 30 days of age and higher parity of the dam increased early-term growth. The lack of association between a disease and the acute phase protein may stem from the low disease prevalence in the beef calves examined. The measurement of acute phase proteins of a young calf can help identify animals with possible future growth deficiencies, although the mechanisms through which the association between acute phase proteins and growth has yet to be explained.",

The major positive acute phase proteins in cattle are haptoglobin (Hp), serum amyloid-A (SAA) and fibrinogen (Fb) (Humblet et al., 2004; Nikunen et al., 2007) . Albumin is a negative acute phase protein, whose concentration decreases during inflammation (Jacobsen et al., 2004; Petersen et al., 2004) . Decreased albumin concentrations have been detected at least with uterine infections (Schneider et al., 2013) and experimentally induced acute phase response (Jacobsen et al., 2004) .

Convenience sampling was done from farms located in southern and south-western Finland and those participating in the Beef Cattle Development Project of the HKScan slaughterhouse. Inclusion criteria were having a compact calving season in the spring and providing means and facilities for weighing the calves. All herds were free from bovine viral diarrhoea virus (BVDV) and were not subject to any vaccination protocol. Farms had typical Finnish beef calf herds where during the winter and spring the animals were kept in uninsulated, spacious, naturally ventilated free stall barns with sloped floors and straw bedding. Cows had free lying space but on one farm lying stalls were used. Cows had ad libitum feeding on silage. Dams and calves grazed starting from mid-May and the bull was kept within the herd to breed. Dams usually calve inside the barn, but some also on the pasture depending on the time of serving. The mean cow number on the farms was 58, ranging from 39 to 78 dams.",

At each visit calves were weighed (or measured with weight tape on one farm), clinically examined, and blood samples, faecal samples and deep nasopharyngeal swabs were obtained. Blood samples were obtained with minimal restraint of the calves to reduce stress, and the dams had visual access to blood sampling of the calves, from behind the fence. The clinical examination included auscultation of the heart and lungs, measuring the heart rate, respiratory rate and body temperature, palpation of the umbilical stalk and palpation of the stifle, hock, carpal and fetlock joints, and visual assessment of faecal consistence. Heart rate, respiratory rate and body temperature were recorded as measured and other findings from clinical examination were scored as in Table 1 . Scores of 2 for umbilicus, faeces or joints were considered to represent clinical diseases. Calves with increased intensity of respiratory sounds (score 2) were defined as suffering from respiratory tract disease, if they simultaneously had respiratory rates\u226540/min and body temperatures\u226539.5\u00b0C.

Although these studies did not involve Hereford or Charolais breeds, probably some difference between these breeds exist, too. Farms have varying level of management and care, resulting in varying morbidity and calf performance. G\u00e5nheim et al. (2007) observed higher values of Hp, SAA and fibrinogen in calves in poorer management conditions. SAA and albumin concentrations showed age related changes for the first month of the calves' lives, similarly to earlier studies (Doornenbal et al., 1988; Orro et al., 2008) .

(2005) , who also showed different growth rates at different breeds at different ages. Bull calves grow faster and get bigger than heifer calves (Tou\u0161ov\u00e1 et al., 2014) , but in our study this held only for the Charolais breed. The parity of the dam showed no more effect on the growth rate in the long-term model, but the dam's BCS \u22653 after parturition was associated with better growth rate. Naturally, undernourished dams with BCS of 1.5 or 2 will not produce thriving calves, but it is surprising to see this association on a long-term growth. Earlier studies have not detected associations between lower dam BCS at parturition and calf growth (DeRouen et al., 1994; Lake et al., 2005) . Negative associations between growth and APP were reported for reindeer (Orro et al., 2006) and lambs (Peetsalu et al., 2013) , where elevated SAA concentrations in healthy animals at two weeks of age were associated with lower weight gain at four months of age. An acute phase response can be detected in animals with subclinical (Heidarpour et al., 2012) or chronic diseases (Horadagoda et al., 1999) , which are difficult to diagnose, but reduce growth rate. Another explanation is that type of immunomodelling occurs in early life, resulting in reduced growth rate later. The acute phase response initiated for any reason in early life releases the cytokines tumour necrosis \u03b1 (TNF \u03b1) and interleukins (IL-1, IL-6) (Petersen et al., 2004) . During the acute phase response, these cytokines also inhibit the activity of insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) (Borghetti et al., 2009) , the increase of which is associated with higher growth rates (Suda et al., 2003) . However, it is unclear how long this inhibition of IGF-1 lasts after the inflammatory process has ceased. Our findings on beef calves and reindeer calves (Orro et al., 2006) suggest that changes affecting the long term growth may happen during the early life of an animal.",

Albumin and globulin concentrations and the parity of the dam were positively associated with growth rate during the first month. The breed and gender had effects on growth only regarding long-term growth (from 3 days to 200 days). The negative association between SAA at two weeks of age and growth rate for 200 days is a novel finding for beef calves, although a similar phenomenon was observed in reindeer calves and lambs. Elevated SAA concentrations could be used as a prognostic indicator of a weaker growth rate.",
