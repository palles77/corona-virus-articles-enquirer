The vertebrate transferring genomes and the spike protein sequences are prepared and tested to evaluate the validity of the method. We use this method to build phylogenetic tree of two groups of the sequences. The result demonstrates that our method is powerful and efficient.",

Traditional sequence alignment method is much empirical to select a sequence alignment scoring matrix and gap penalty parameters, the difference of which may affect alignment results tremendously. In order to avoid this problem, during the last twenty years, several alignment-free methods for sequence comparison have arisen much interest in the field of computational biology. For example, graphical representations of biological sequences have been one kind of alignment-free methods to sequence analysis. Graphical method for visualizing DNA sequence is early proposed by Hamori and Ruskin [1] . Using graphic approaches to study biological systems can provide intuitive and useful insights, as indicated by many previous studies on a series of important biological topics [2, 3] . Liao et al. reported on a sort of binary coding method of RNA secondary structures and coding rules based on the exclusive-OR operation [4] . In another paper, Liao et al. propose a 4-D representation of RNA secondary structures and outline an approach to make mathematical analysis and to compute the similarities between RNA secondary structures [5] . Liao et al. proposed a 6D representation of protein sequences consisting of 20 amino acids. Based on this 6D representation, they provided a proteome distance measure for constructing phylogenic tree [6] . In the report [7] , Jia et al. proposed a novel 2D representation for protein secondary structure sequences. Word-based measure is one of widely used alignment-free approaches. In this method, each sequence is mapped into an n-dimensional vector according to its k-word frequencies, and similarity between the sequences is then defined by n-dimensional vector [8, 9] . The LZ algorithm is another widely used alignmentfree algorithm. Based on the relative information between the sequences using Lempel-Ziv complexity, a new sequence distance measure is proposed [10] . Zhang and Wang used conditional The LZ algorithm to compare the linear characteristic sequences of RNA secondary structures [11] .",

Lempel-Ziv (LZ) complexity of a sequence is measured by the minimal number of steps required for its synthesis in a certain process. For each step only two operations are allowed in the process: either generating an additional symbol which ensures the uniqueness of each component or copying the longest fragment from the part of a synthesized sequence [13] . In recent years, some authors applied the algorithm to compare sequences and construct phylogenic trees. For instance, Otu and Sayood applied the LZ algorithm to phylogenic analysis and had successfully constructed phylogenic trees for real and simulated DNA data sets [10] . Liu and Wang take the physicochemical properties of amino acids into account, and used the LZ algorithm to construct phylogenic trees [14] . In this study, the measure of relative LZ complexity between two sequences is proposed according to the principle of the LZ complexity. The LZ complexity distance metric between two nonnull sequences is defined by utilizing relative LZ complexity.",

Human TF, Rabbit TF, Cow TF and Rat TF are clustered into the same branch. The Rat TF, Cow TF are separated from Human TF and Rabbit TF.

The name, accession number and abbreviation for the 26 spike protein sequences are listed in Table 2 . Given a set of protein sequences, their phylogenetic tree can be obtained through the following main operations: first, we calculate the relative LZ complexity for protein sequences; second, by arranging all these distances into a matrix, we obtain a pair-wise distance matrix. Finally, we put the pairwise distance matrix into the neighbor-joining program in the PHYLIP package. We obtain the phylogenetic relationships drawn by MEGA program [21].

The time complexity of this algorithm is O(l(Q) \u00c2 l(R)). The main advantage is that this method can extract repeated patterns from biological sequence. Therefore, when two sequences are compared, the subsequences that they share can be detected. In this report, we use the relative LZ complexity to describe the similarity of the biological sequences. The two experiments have shown that the approach proposed in this report is a powerful and useful tool for the comparison of biological sequence. Studies of the application of this method to whole coding DNA sequences, RNA sequence and protein sequence will appear in the future. Furthermore, this method can be used to prediction of protein secondary structure. The shortage of this method is that some information may be lost when protein primary structures are converted to protein feature sequences. However, the tests have proven that our method can extract phylogenetic information from proteins and hence it can complement phylogenetic analysis.
