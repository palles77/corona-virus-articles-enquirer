Are expensive new technologies feasible or preferred for effective communication and productive outcomes? In this report from a longstanding partnership between schools of nursing at Peking University and the University of Michigan, case study methodology is used to evaluate more than a decade of experience with communication modalities: in person, postal mail, express mail, e-mail, fax, telephone, hand delivery by other travelers, and Web sites. Although each education and practice community develops unique ways to build its shared knowledge, a communications plan is suggested, with use of multiple communication techniques, especially those that are low cost and the most dependable. High-cost technologies are not always feasible or preferred. For the project described, they were not necessary to the major outcome, a nursing education and practice network that resulted in the first nurse-managed community-based clinic in China. (",

Funded by small grants from the W.K. Kellogg Foundation, UM, and the individual visitors, these contacts had been facilitated by Sharon Woodcock, a retired foreign service nurse and wife of the first U.S. Ambassador to China, Leonard Woodcock.",

Successful collaboration often requires early visits by school leaders, and this is certainly true for work with Chinese institutions. Accordingly, UM's Dean Hinshaw visited Beida's Dean Yao in 1996. The result was that the two deans signed a formal agreement (see Figure 1) of collaboration between their schools. This agreement assured recognition by higher university officials because the signing ceremony was held in the office of the president of Beida, with formal arrangements and approval by the university's Office of International Affairs. This type of symbolic support can be required, or at least facilitative. In both universities, the schools of nursing have received more visibility and recognition for their collaboration because they can cite this agreement in annual reports and funding proposals. As shown in Figure 1 , the language of this agreement is general, not restrictive or binding.",

As a result of this visit, both sides believed that there could be mutually beneficial activities. In Ann Arbor, we decided together to focus first on community-based nursing care because it was an emphasis of the Chinese government and a historic interest of a nearby funding source, the W.K. Kellogg Foundation. Given the strong support of the deans of both schools, the spark provided by a person competent in both Chinese and U.S. academic cultures, and the interest of a senior UM faculty, our proposal was successful. With funding of approximately $50,000 per year total for both sides, we have built a long-lived, substantive partnership with its primary focus on curriculum and clinical teaching and a secondary focus on research. The first stage of this collaboration was short-term training for Beida faculty (Zheng, Hinshaw, Yu, Guo, & Oakley, 2000) ; the second stage was expansion of Beida's undergraduate community health curriculum, including the first nurse-managed clinic in China to provide community health clinical experiences for undergraduate and graduate students (Lu, Shang & Liu, in press; Yu & Shang, Figure 1 . Two universities' formal agreement to work together. 2004). Throughout, each side's expenditures were accounted for separately. In the second phase, the amount budgeted for Beida expenses required a subcontract with UM, the primary grant recipient.",

Two research projects related to our main project have in- volved packages (e.g., bulky videotapes, research instrumentation) carried to or from China by other travelers. Hand-carrying allowed the items to be included as regular luggage, and customs explanations were prepared. Fortunately, the travelers were not stopped. Web sites or shared Internet spaces are often used to assist collaborations within the United States or with colleagues in westernized nations. The only attempt to use a shared Internet space was the Undergraduate Connection, a link between undergraduate nursing classes. Students exchanged information about their health systems, nursing roles, professional issues, and personal goals. The shared Internet space did not work because early trials showed that UM's shared space for courses could not be made accessible to nonenrolled students at that time. A Web site was then developed, but all UM websites were later inaccessible inside China, for reasons about which we can only speculate. Because e-mails were not blocked, the students succeeded by exchanging e-mail messages.",

The feasibility of financial support is probably growing. A number of universities have curricular interests in international nursing or international health (Ekstrom & Sigurdsson, 2002; Iwasiw et al., 2000; Wright et al., 1998) , and universities seem to be making some real or in-kind resources available for international collaborations to build communities of nursing education and practice. The large number of experiences yet to be reported in peer-reviewed publications suggests that site-visit exchanges are feasible for many schools of nursing. Our experience suggests strongly that these be institutionally based, with early visits by the appropriate leaders.",

As with any personal or professional visit, both hosts and visitors must join in planning the timing of visits. Our experience has also made us particularly aware that it is helpful to have a clear understanding about the time commitment of the hosting institution. Especially in major cities like Beijing, leading universities are visited by many important Chinese and international experts, and teaching schedules are extraordinarily demanding. When visiting scholars come to UM, we find that the American faculty members, particularly those who are not on the project team, can also easily feel overburdened by one more visitor. Visits on both sides are more productive when there is agreement in advance about objectives and schedules of scheduled visits (Franklin, 2001) , a practice commonly adopted by nursing faculty. However, we found that it takes reminders from both sides to prepare-by e-mailing PowerPoint presentations well in advance, for example-to allow time for translation. The host site also needs adequate time to schedule in-depth meetings with experts and issue invitations to workshops or seminars. Preparing for site visits using distance communication can make precious professional time productive.",

E-mail access can be restricted when the only computer is in a single office that is usually locked to avoid theft in a resource-short society or when the whole system fails (as in the East-Midwest power outage of 2003) or is blocked. When people do not have their own home computers or e-mail accounts, the speed of e-mail responses can be slower and more formalized. In our experience, e-mail is less likely to be affected than Web sites, chat groups, bulletin boards, and other Internet mechanisms. But whenever there are exchanges of information and ideas, it is best to save negative input for one-to-one exchanges and use more group-oriented interchange for positive support (Gamonal, 2003) . Telephone communications are excellent for people speaking the same language but too cumbersome for the busy people at both ends when translations are required. Speakerphones facilitate group interactions but may not be available at both sites. Time differences can also demand awkward accommodations at one site, or both. Fax machines may have to be turned off at night, or they may be located in a central university office, requiring extra delivery time and expense.",

While it may not be possible for Americans to stay within a foreign visitors' section of the host university because of severe lack of amenities, U.S. visitors should prepare for basic accommodations. They should feel safe and have access to hotel staff who speak some English to help make sightseeing and other arrangements. (Nowadays there are so many nursing visitors to the major eastern cities in China, and students and young faculty are so busy that it is burdensome for them to repeatedly act as tour guides, especially outside of regular work hours. In Western China, in contrast, students and faculty may cherish opportunities to practice English and make personalized relationships). Similarly, Chinese visitors can be housed in modest settings and enjoy home stays as long as they have privacy and access to familiar foods. Most academic nurses in both countries are accustomed to sharing nonluxurious accommodations, making the type of budget for our project feasible for others.",

Welcoming and farewell banquets are expected. They are not luxuries, but rather settings during which background and off-the-record conversations bring important issues to light. These and other informal settings such as lunches and taxi rides can be useful ways to bring up unplanned agenda items, gain deeper understanding, and gain advice about sensitive topics. Nurses in both cultures are well practiced in maximizing use of informal times with colleagues. Costs of banquets can be contained by asking Chinese colleagues to help select appropriate nearby restaurants in China and using Chinese restaurants in the United States because this would be culturally sensitive to the visitors' tastes.",

These payments markedly facilitated expansion of our community of nursing education and practice because they were tangible marks of respect for expertise and valuable professional time. If small grants such as our are not available, other institutional and personal incentives can be used. Institutional incentives could include released time or a student assistant and at least making participation in the collaborative arrangement a matter of distinction to be considered in annual merit review and promotion applications.

Beida's dean could also use each visit by UM's dean to increase central administrators' understanding of nursing's autonomous role. It was also extremely important that the project director in China could come to Ann Arbor on two occasions. Mutual trust was established by daily sharing because she stayed with the director of UM's nurse-managed, community-based clinic. Because they were together much of the time, questions and clarifications about community-based wellness definitions and projects could be exchanged easily. Through their informal conversations, it was possible to develop a shared understanding about conceptual, role, and practice differences in the two countries. Because each knew something about the other's setting, the two specialists could talk through possible adaptations and nursing applications that might work in China's very different health care system. The sense of trust generated renewed enthusiasm for both the host and the visitor as they discussed difficulties and solutions even in an advanced practice setting that has been in existence for more than a decade (Ingersoll, McIntosh, & Williams, 2000; McIntosh et al., 2003) .",
