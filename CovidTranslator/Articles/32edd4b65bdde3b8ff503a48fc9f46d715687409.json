            "text": "BACKGROUND: Isolation precautions have negative effects on patient safety, psychological well-being, and healthcare worker contact. However, it is not known whether isolation precautions affect certain hospitalrelated outcomes. OBJECTIVE: To examine the effect of isolation precautions on hospital-related outcomes and cost of care. DESIGN: Retrospective, propensity-score matched cohort study of inpatients admitted to general internal medicine (GIM) services at three academic hospitals in Toronto, Ontario, Canada between January 2010 and December 2012. PARTICIPANTS: Adult (\u226518 years of age) patients on isolation precautions for respiratory illnesses and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) were matched to controls based on propensity scores derived from nine covariates: age, sex, Resource Intensity Weight, number of hospital readmissions within 90 days, total length of stay for hospital admissions within 90 days, site of admission, month of isolation, year of isolation, and Case Mix Group. MAIN MEASURES: Thirty-day readmission rates and emergency department visits, hospital length of stay, expected length of stay, adverse events, in-hospital mortality, patient complaints, and cost of care in Canadian doll ars (CAD). KEY RESULTS: A total of 17,649 non-isolated patients were admitted to the participating hospitals during the study period. We identified 1506 patients isolated for respiratory illnesses and 745 patients isolated for MRSA. Compared to non-isolated individuals, those on isolation precautions for respiratory illnesses stayed 17 % longer (95 % CI: 9 %, 25 %), stayed 9 % longer than expected (95 % CI: 3 %, 15 %), and had 23 % higher cost of care (95 % CI: 14 %, 32 %). Patients isolated for MRSA had similar outcomes, but they also had a 4.4 % higher (95 % CI: 1.4 %, 7.3 %) rate of readmission to hospital within 30 days. CONCLUSIONS: Isolation precautions are associated with adverse effects which may result in poorer hospital outcomes. Balancing the benefits for the many with the harms to the few will be a future challenge.",

            "text": "Isolation precautions are used for patients hospitalized with known or suspected colonization or infection with pathogens transmitted in hospitals. These precautions may require a private room or placement behind drawn curtains in a multibed room, requiring staff and visitors to wear personal protective equipment, and restricting the movement of patients. 1 The use of these precautions has been shown to control outbreaks (e.g. severe acute respiratory syndrome [SARS] ) and, in some circumstances, the transmission of other pathogens. 2, 3 However, such precautions may also be associated with unintended adverse consequences. 4, 5 Isolation precautions negatively affect several dimensions of patient care. Isolated patients have half as much contact with clinicians as do control patients, and are half as likely to be examined by attending physicians on rounds. [5] [6] [7] They are also twice as likely to experience adverse events during hospitalization, and eight times as likely to experience supportive care failure such as falls and pressure ulcers. 8, 9 Studies have reported negative psychological effects of isolation including feelings of loneliness, stigmatization, and increased depression and anxiety. 8, [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] Finally, isolated patients experience lower rates of satisfaction with care. 8, 19 Some criticisms of these conclusions have suggested that studies to date have not adequately adjusted for the severity of patients' underlying illness, and no studies have examined the trade-off between the known benefits of isolation precautions and their potential risks.",

We report on these two groups separately, as patients with MRSA are placed on isolation for a longer period of time than patients with respiratory illnesses; as such, the effect of isolation may be more pronounced in the MRSA cohort. Patients in the isolated cohorts include those who had or were suspected of having an infectious disease prior to hospital admission as well as those with hospital-acquired infections; infections acquired during hospitalization represent only a small proportion of cases.

[26] [27] [28] The propensity score for the likelihood of being placed on isolation precautions was developed using a multivariable logistic regression model. A total of nine covariates were included in the model: age, sex, RIW, number of hospital readmissions within 90 days, total LOS for hospital admissions within 90 days, site of admission, month of isolation, year of isolation, and Case Mix Group (CMG). Two-way interactions were included between the first six covariates, and CMG had a factor for each of the 52 most common groups, which accounted for 75 % of observations. These covariates were all selected as important predictors of isolation for infection control. Controls for each isolated case were sampled with replacement by nearest-neighbor matching using a caliper width of 0.1 standard deviations of the logit of the propensity score. [29] [30] [31] With this approach, isolated patients are randomly ordered, and the first isolated patient is selected and matched to the control patient with the closest propensity score that is within the caliper. If multiple controls are almost equally close to the case, they are all selected and re-weighted to reflect the number of matches. This approach estimates what is called the average treatment effect in the treated (ATT); here, ATT is the effect of isolation on patients who are characteristic of those actually isolated. 32 Two other effects that could have been estimated, the average treatment effect and the average treatment effect in controls, are of little interest, as they would estimate the effect of isolation in patient groups where isolation is much less likely. Covariate balance between cohorts was assessed graphically and by the standardized difference; meaningful imbalance is indicated by an absolute standardized difference of 0.10. 33",

Neither isolated cohort was more likely to experience a 30-day ED visit or death or to file a formal complaint compared to matched controls. Evidence is lacking as to whether respiratory precautions reduce nosocomial spread of respiratory disease; therefore, it is difficult to assess benefits versus adverse impacts of this practice. *Reported as percentages; effect is the difference in percentage between the isolated and non-isolated cohorts \u2020 Reported as geometric means; effect is the ratio of means between the isolated and non-isolated cohorts \u2021 Reported as rates per 100 admissions; effect is the absolute differences in the rates per 100 patients between isolated and non-isolated cohorts ED emergency department, ELOS expected length of stay, LOS length of stay For MRSA, the reproductive ratio, R(A), for a single admission of an MRSA patient not on precautions is about 0.67. The reproductive ratio for MRSA rises above 1 only when readmissions are included, since patients can be colonized for years. Precautions reduce the R(A) by >90 %. 36, 37 Thus, each patient in precautions from admission, as opposed to nonisolated, would result-from that admission-in about 0.67 \u00d7 0.35 = 0.23, i.e. just under one quarter of one infection. If more than one admission is counted, the number of prevented infections increases. In addition, if started early enough, the intervention prevents not only the first generation of transmission, but also later ones, hence further increasing the benefits. 36, 37 However, isolation precautions may negatively impact several dimensions of patient care. Our study adds to knowledge in this area by noting that isolation precautions are associated with certain negative hospital-related outcomes. Previous studies have reported negative psychological effects, more adverse events, and less healthcare provider contact for isolated patients. [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] 13, [16] [17] [18] This may lead to a disproportionate amount of 'hospitalization-induced disability', i.e. the impact of the hospitalization itself, with subsequent de-conditioning, over and above the severity of the illness, resulting in loss of function, prolonging hospital stay, and possibly leading to an increased 30-day readmission rate.",

We attempted to mitigate this by using a propensity scorematched design. Additionally, the literature suggests that MRSA infections lead to worse outcomes, higher costs, and longer lengths of stay than those observed for methicillinsusceptible infections-thus, some of the negative outcomes here may be due to the underlying infection and/or an inherent but unmeasured difference in patient status, and not the isolation practice itself. 38, 39 Another limitation noted in 'Methods' is that the practice of isolation for infection control differs between sites. At sites 1 and 2, respiratory (droplet and contact) precautions are used for patients admitted with fever and respiratory symptoms; at site 3, patients with respiratory or fever with cardiac symptoms are tested for respiratory viruses on admission, whereas droplet and contact precautions are used only for patients with influenza. Additionally, the sites differ in their requirement for hospital staff to wear masks when caring for patients colonized or infected with MRSA. Finally, we acknowledge that data for 30-day hospital readmissions are limited to the hospital the patient was originally discharged from. However, in our region, two-thirds of readmissions are to the same site as the initial hospitalization. 40 Moreover, the potential for missing readmission data should be equally distributed across both isolated and non-isolated patients.",
