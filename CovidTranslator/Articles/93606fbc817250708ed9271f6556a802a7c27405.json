Many long-established infectious diseases have increased their geographic range and incidence. Antimicrobial resistance is becoming more prevalent. Of particular signifi cance, over the past three decades there has been a succession of apparently new (mostly viral) infectious diseases. These include HIV/AIDS, Ebola virus, legionellosis, hepatitis C, hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, Nipah virus, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), and, most recently, H5N1 avian infl uenza.",

For example, deforestation and habitat fragmentation can facilitate the mobilization of microbes that were not previously agents of human infection, and thereby prompt the emergence of new infectious diseases in humans (see Chapter 5).

That is, climatic conditions set the geographic limits of the disease.

Of the four protozoa that infect humans, two of them predominate overwhelmingly: Plasmodium vivax and P. falciparum. Falciparum (which causes far greater mortality than vivax) requires warmer conditions, and predominates in most tropical and sub-tropical regions. Vivax malaria, with its capacity for overwintering dormancy, predominates in cooler, temperate zones. The many environmental factors that affect malaria incidence include altitude (Bodker et al., 2003) , topography (Balls et al., 2004) , land use, irrigation, and other environmental disturbance (Carlson et al., 2004) .",

The simplest transmission cycle is one where a pathogen is transmitted (by \"contagion\") from an infected person to another susceptible person directly (e.g. via droplet secretion or sexual contact). Cycles of medium complexity are those where the pathogen is transmitted indirectly (through an intermediate plant, animal, or environmental factor such as water). Vector-borne pathogens -those that rely on a vector (such as a mosquito, fl y, cockroach, tick or rodent) to infect humans -are a major subset of this second group.",

These too may have an intervening vector (a mosquito, as in West Nile Virus) or not (such as direct transmission, as in rabies from the bite of a dog). Some of these cycles are highly complex, with more than one animal reservoir needed in the transmission cycle (e.g. tick and deer, Lyme spirochete) or with numerous different species capable of acting as reservoirs (in the case of Ross River virus).

Studies have shown that an increase in notifi cations of (nonspecifi c) food-poisoning in the United Kingdom (Bentham and Langford, 1995; Bentham and Langford, 2001) and of diarrheal diseases in Peru and Fiji (Checkley et al., 2000; Singh et al., 2001) has accompanied short-term increases in temperature. Linear associations have been found between temperature and notifi cations of salmonellosis in European countries and Australia (D'Souza et al., 2004 ; see Figure 14 .2), and a weaker seasonal relationship exists for infection by Campylobacter (Kovats et al., 2005; Nichols, 2005) . As cooking destroys most food-borne pathogens, it is likely that inadequate storage and the spread from contaminated to non-contaminated food are risk factors for transmission in sporadic cases (Schmid et al., 1996) . Outdoor temperatures might also affect people's exposure to salmonella bacteria through seasonal changes in eating patterns (such as the consumption of foods with a higher risk of Salmonella contamination from buffets, barbecued foods, and salads, etc.) .",

Culex annulirostris is the main inland vector: it breeds in vegetated fresh water, and is common in both tropical and temperate regions that are subject to fl ooding or irrigation during summer. Other species, such as O. notoscriptus, are important vectors in semi-rural and urban areas. The main natural vertebrate hosts for the virus are marsupials (kangaroos and wallabies), with other animals also implicated (notably possums and horses).",

When immunity in the host population is low, and climatic conditions are suitable, massive amplifi cation of the virus occurs in the host and mosquito populations. In this situation the abundance of mosquitoes typically results in transmission of the virus to humans, when infected mosquitoes are forced to seek blood meals outside their natural targets. Changes in climate strongly infl uence the replication of this virus (Kay and Aaskov, 1989) , the breeding, abundance and survival of the mosquito vectors (Lee et al., 1989) , and the breeding cycle of the natural hosts (Caughley et al., 1987) . The epidemiology of the disease refl ects this, with different seasonal and inter-annual patterns being observed between the broad climatic regions of the Australian continent (Russell, 1994; Tong and Hu, 2001; Woodruff, 2005) . In the northern tropical region the disease is endemic, and cases occur in most months of every year. In the southern temperate and inland arid parts of the country the pattern is sporadic, with wide variation between years in the number of reported cases.",

Weather conditions at relatively coarse temporal and spatial resolutions have been used to predict epidemics with suffi cient accuracy and advance notice for public health planning. In the dry temperate south-eastern part of the country, Woodruff and colleagues have shown that sustained winter/spring rainfall (i.e. the total number of rain days) and warm late spring temperatures, in conjunction with low rainfall in the spring of the preceding year, increased the risk of summertime RRv epidemics (Woodruff et al., 2002) . They speculated there are two linked mechanisms that lead to epidemic potential in this region. First, fl oodwater Aedes species maintain the natural cycle of the virus by transovarial transmission through embryonated eggs (Lindsay et al., 1993) . These mosquitoes \"overwinter\" as drought-resistant eggs in mud fl ats and creek beds (Marshall, 1979) . After heavy winter rainfall, the females emerge and infect the vertebrate hosts (Lindsay et al., 1993) . Substantial rainfall from late winter enables early and prolifi c breeding of Aedes populations and an extended period of virus build-up, thus increasing the transmission potential. The period of prolonged heavy rainfall also acts to raise the water table across this fl at region, reducing absorption and runoff. As a consequence, pools of water remain on the ground into summer (even if there is low summer rainfall). This provides breeding sites for the summer breeding Culex mosquitoes, which preferentially bite both humans and kangaroos -thus extending the infection beyond the natural cycle to humans.",

High spring rainfall supports large numbers of mosquitoes.

This results in a reduction in the pool of susceptible kangaroos in the following year, and consequently minimal viral amplifi cation and a lower probability of human cases. Conversely, several years of low spring rainfall dramatically raises the proportion of susceptible kangaroos so that in subsequent years -if climatic conditions are suitable -the probability of a large outbreak becomes very high.",

Widespread deforestation, other land-use changes, water-damming and irrigation, biodiversity losses that occur because of those and other reasons, more intensive and extensive trading patterns, and increased human crowding (especially in peri-urban shanty towns and slums) are all likely to infl uence patterns of infectious disease occurrence.

The fi rst recorded Nipah virus outbreak followed the establishment of commercial piggeries in conjunction with fruit orchards located close to the tropical forest in northern Malaysia. The causal constellation underlying this emergent infectious disease remains uncertain, and almost certainly complex. The following are likely components. During the 1980s and 1990s, the forest habitat of the local fruit bats (Pteropus species -the natural host of the virus) had been reduced by deforestation for pulpwood and industrial plantation. Then, in 1997-1998, slash-and-burn deforestation escalated and resulted in the formation of a severe haze that blanketed much of the region. This was exacerbated by a drought and associated forest fi res, driven by a severe El Ni\u00f1o event in the same year (see Box 14.4). Forest fruit yields declined, and hungry food-seeking bats encroached into cultivated fruit orchards. Pigs are thought to have been infected via the eating of shared fruits (and bat droppings), and this new mammalian host then infected the pig farmers. This zoonosis ultimately infected several hundred Malaysian rural workers, causing a fatal encephalitic disease in approximately half of them (Daszak et al., 2000 (Daszak et al., , 2006 .",

In particular, the higher temperatures characteristic of El Ni\u00f1o events can affect both the vector species and the pathogen (in ways described in the main text). Tidal inundation is essential for salt-marsh mosquito breeding: sea levels and tide heights rise, and wetland areas are more frequently inundated in years when sea (especially carbon dioxide and methane from industrial, transport, mining, and agricultural practices) will affect the global climate system. In particular, Earth's surface will warm and precipitation patterns will change. Recent scientifi c consensus is that this predicted process of climate change is now becoming evident, and that most of the warming that has occurred over the past half-century has been due to human actions (IPCC, 2001; see also Figure 14 .3).",

However, a welcome recent development has been the advent of such studies for countries such as India and Zimbabwe. In the Zimbabwe study (Ebi et al., 2005) , plausible country-level climate change scenarios were generated and then applied to a mathematical model of how climatic parameters affect malaria transmissibility. The study showed that, with rising average and minimum daily temperatures accompanied by minimum necessary monthly rainfall, the future risk of malaria would progressively extend to higher altitudes. An important corollary here is that even if Zimbabwe were to become very wealthy and socially modernized, it would still cost much more than today to prevent the population's risk (exposure) from rising temperatures each morning.",

If the pathogen were not locally present (e.g. because of effi cient case surveillance and treatment) or if the vector species had been eliminated (e.g. by mosquito control programs), then the disease could not be transmitted. Future modeling will become more versatile if it can incorporate plausible scenarios (or, better, probabilistic projections) of these non-climatic contextual changes. Nevertheless, estimating how the intrinsic probability of infectious disease transmission would alter in response to climate change alone is itself informative -and, indeed, accords with classical experimental science. It serves to alert us to the range of future potential risks, and it focuses attention on areas that need more attention and research (see Box 14.5, page 398). ",

This includes melting of glaciers, shrinkage of sea-ice, changes in seasonal timing of bird nesting and plant fl owering, and changes in timing and paths of insect migration. Attribution of climatic infl uence is much easier for these relatively simple systems, mostly lacking compelling alternative explanations. This, however, is not the case for patterns of infectious diseases in human populations -there are always several, sometimes many, plausible explanations for any observed change in pattern of occurrence. Hence, caution is needed in the interpretation of climate-associated changes in human infectious diseases. In general, no single report is conclusive. Within a particular \"climate envelope,\" many other social, economic, behavioral, and environmental factors also infl uence disease transmission. Against this complex and \"noisy\" background, it is unavoidably diffi cult to make a quantitative attribution to climate change of any observed change in the occurrence of some specifi ed infectious disease. Vector-borne infectious diseases vary greatly in the complexity of their transmission modes, and hence some are much easier to study via modeling than are others. To date, the formal modeling of how climate change would affect vector-borne diseases has focused on malaria and dengue fever. Modeling future impacts is conceptually simpler for dengue than for malaria. The two main pathogen variants of malaria (falciparum and vivax) and its transmission relies on several dozen regionally dominant mosquito species, whereas dengue fever is transmitted principally by one mosquito vector, Aedes aegypti.",

Several studies have noted an increase in highland malaria in recent decades (Loevinsohn, 1994; Lindblade et al., 1999; Ndyomugyenyi and Magnussen, 2004) , with some such increases occurring in association with local warming trends (Tulu, 1996; Bonora et al., 2001) .

A recent re-analysis of the study that found no evidence of a temperature effect, updated to the present from 1950 to 2002 for four high-altitude sites in East Africa where malaria has become a serious public health problem, found evidence for a signifi cant warming trend at all sites (Pascual et al., 2006) .

Taken together, these indicate a signal that global climate change is now beginning to change the conditions of the biophysical environment around us (Root et al., 2003) . This raises an obvious question. Is similar evidence emerging of changes in occurrence of infectious diseases that are plausibly due to recent or ongoing regional changes in climate? That is, can we develop formal methods of \"pattern recognition\"? Particular attention has recently been paid to reports of changes in malaria in eastern and southern Africa, tick-borne encephalitis in Sweden, and the temporal correlation of cholera outbreaks in Bangladesh with recentlyintensifying El Ni\u00f1o events.",

Such scenarios usually entail plausible ranges of the underlying drivers (such as fossil fuel combustion as a major determinant of greenhouse gas emissions) rather than formal probability distributions. The scenarios also entail substantial uncertainties about both future societal trajectories and (climate) system responses to as-yet unexperienced (in human records) atmospheric composition. The former category of uncertainty can be better addressed by achieving a higher level of horizontal integration (of non-climate effect-modifi ers) into the model. The latter category will require more empirical observation by climate scientists, both now and as the process unfolds (WHO, 2004) .",

Both measures require knowledge of an impending outbreak, and a suitable response time. Climate factors that drive the growth of vector populations and the replication of pathogens have the potential to be used as a proxy for early warning of the probability of an outbreak of disease. The objective is to detect conditions suitable for pathogen amplifi cation in the natural cycle at the earliest possible time so that public health interventions can have the greatest opportunity for success. Climate forecasts will be helpful tools in the public health management of vector-borne diseases, if they can (i) improve the targeting and sensitivity of surveillance and increase the length of the response time, or (ii) reduce the cost of traditional surveillance activities. An interesting recent example comes from research carried out in southern Africa, showing how the empirically derived relationship between observed summer rainfall and subsequent annual malaria incidence can then be used successfully for forecasting malaria incidence in the coming year (Thomson et al., 2006 )thereby providing 6-9 months advance warning for the pubic health and healthcare facilities.",

It is likely to become increasingly important over at least the next half-century, as the massive, highinertial, and somewhat unpredictable process of climate change continues. As discussed in this chapter, the many ways in which climate change does and will infl uence infectious diseases are subject to a plethora of modifying (precluding, constraining, amplifying) infl uences by other factors and processes: constitutional characteristics of hosts, vectors and pathogens; the prevailing ambient conditions (topography, disease control programs, and others); and coexistent changes (local and global) in other social, economic, behavioral and environmental factors. This global anthropogenic process, climate change, along with other unprecedented global environmental changes, is beginning to destabilize and weaken the planet's life-support systems. Infectious diseases, unlike other diseases, depend on the biology and behavior -each often climate-sensitive -of two or more parties (pathogen, vector, intermediate host, human host). Hence, these diseases will be particularly susceptible to changes as the world's climate and its climate-sensitive geochemical and ecological systems undergo change over the coming decades.",
