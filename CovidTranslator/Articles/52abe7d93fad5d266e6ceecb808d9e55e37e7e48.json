            "text": "Tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 3 (TRAF3) is a main regulator of antiviral and anti-inflammatory pathways in mammals, which is considered to induce type I interferon (IFN) activation and negatively regulate the activation of the canonical and non-canonical NF-\u03baB pathways. To elucidate its function in teleost fish, TRAF3 homologue of black carp (Mylopharyngodon piceus) has been cloned and characterized in this study. The open reading frame (ORF) of black carp TRAF3 (bcTRAF3) consists of 1722 nucleotides and bcTRAF3 contains 574 amino acids. bcTRAF3 protein migrated around 65 KDa in immunoblot analysis of both EPC and HEK293T cells. bcTRAF3 was identified as a cytosolic protein and suggested to form aggregates or be associated with vesicles scattering in the cytoplasm. It was interesting that both NF-\u03baB and IFN transcription was activated by bcTRAF3 in reporter assay. When co-expressed with black carp STING (bcSTING), bcTRAF3 was redistributed in the cytoplasm and its subcellular location overlapped with that of bcSTING no matter what the cells was infected with GCRV or not, which suggested the association between these two molecules. bcSTING-mediated IFN production was up-regulated by bcTRAF3 in a dose dependent manner in reporter assay. Accordingly, EPC cells transfected with both bcSTING and bcTRAF3 showed enhanced antiviral activity comparing EPC cells expressing bcSTING alone. Taken together, the data generated in this paper supported the conclusion that bcTRAF3 was recruited into host innate immune activation and positively regulated bcSTING-mediated antiviral signaling.",

The recognition of the invading microbes is crucial for the activation of host innate immune system, which relies on a limited number of germlineencoded receptors (Akira et al., 2006) . These receptors have evolved to recognize the conserved products of microbial metabolism produced by microbial pathogens, but not their hosts (Janeway et al., 2002) . The detection of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) is carried out by the pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), which include membrane-bound Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and cytosolic receptors such as RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs). PRRs activate NF-\u03baB and interferon regulated-factor 3/7 (IRF3/7) through downstream signaling; subsequently trigger the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, IFNs and IFN stimulated genes (ISGs), which finally initiate host innate immune response (Akira et al., 2006; Zhong et al., 2006) .",

Normally, TRAF3 functions as K63-specific ubiquitin ligases, which alter the function of target proteins through their non-degradative, site-specific ubiquitination activity and activate T several downstream proteins (Guven-Maiorov et al., 2016) . Notably, the C-terminal TRAF domain (also known as MATH domain) and the Nterminal RING domain play the critical role in TRAF3 functioning (H\u00e4cker et al., 2011; Ni et al., 2002) . Previous studies demonstrated that MAVS (Mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein) (Belgnaoui et al., 2012; Paz et al., 2011; Saha et al., 2006) , TRADD (Tumor necrosis factor receptor type 1-associated DEATH domain protein) (Michallet et al., 2008) , CD40 (Cluster of differentiation 40) (Ni et al., 2000) and TRAF family member associated NF-\u03baB activator (TANK) (Li et al., 2002) interacted with the MATH-TRAF3 domain, and the RING domain was proposed to act as an E3 ligase in TNF receptor signaling complexes Increasing evidence showed that TRAF3 played important roles in the signaling during host immune response, such as RLR signaling and TLR signaling (Nakhaei et al., 2008) . In TLR pathway, TRAF3 associated with TRIF/IRAK1, as well as TBK1/IKK\u03b5, suggesting that TRAF3 served as a critical linker between TLR adaptors and downstream regulatory kinases important for IRF activation . In RLR signaling, the activation of type-I IFNs is affected by the interaction between MAVS and TRAF3 (Belgnaoui et al., 2012) . Except for the association of MAVS, TRAF3, a K63-linked E3 ubiquitin ligase ubiquitinating itself and downstream proteins, was found to regulate IFN but not inflammatory cytokine production during virus infection (Nakhaei et al., 2008) .",

TRAF3 homologues have been cloned and characterized from several species, including common carp (Cyprinus carpio) (Feng et al., 2011) , zebrafish (Danio rerio), humphead snapper (Lutjanus sanguineus) (Cai et al., 2015) et al. In this paper, TRAF3 homologue has been cloned and characterized from black carp (Latin name: Mylopharyngodon piceus), which is an important freshwater industrial species and subjected to multiple pathogenic microbes such as grass carp reovirus (GCRV; double strand RNA reovirus) and spring viremia of carp virus (SVCV; single negative strand RNA rhabdovirus). This fish TRAF3 homologue activated both NF-\u03baB and IFN in reporter assay, which was different with TRAF2 and TRAF6 of black carp (bcTRAF2 and bcTRAF6). What is more, bcTRAF3 upregulated black carp STING (Stimulator of interferon genes, also named as MITA)-mediated antiviral signaling (Lu et al., 2017) , which is reported in teleost fish for the first time.",

Different mRNA profile of bcTRAF3 in host cells post infection suggested that this protein was recruited into different mechanisms during host innate immune activation initiated by GCRV or SVCV. However, bcTRAF3 level was very low (even decreased) in the early stage post both GCRV and SVCV infection (within 12 h), implied the invading virus utilized unknown mechanisms to suppressed the expression of host immune related molecules, such as TARF3.",

Our data showed that over-expressed bcTRAF3 in EPC cells induced the transcription of black carp IFNa, DrIFN\u03c62 and DrIFN\u03c63 in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 4A-C) . It was interesting that bcTRAF3 showed the ability to activate the transcription of NF-\u03baB (Fig. 4D) . Studies on mammalian TRAF3 showed that TRAF3 played a critical role of the activation of type I IFNs in both TLR and RLR signaling besides its function as an inhibitor of NF-\u03baB signaling pathway (H\u00e4cker et al., 2011) . To investigate if the expression of IFNs, ISGs and NF-\u03baB related genes in host cells were influenced by bcTRAF3, MPF cells were transfected with bcTRAF3, then infected with GCRV before q- PCR analysis. For NF-\u03baB related genes, the relative expression level of bcp50, p52, p65, IL-1\u03b2 and IkB\u03b1 were all up-regulated in MPF cells expressing bcTRAF3 by comparison of that in the cells transfected with the empty vector, no matter GCRV treatment or not (Fig.5B \u223c F) , which matched the result of reporter assay (Fig. 4D) . It is clearly that bcTRAF3, different from mammalian TRAF3, plays a positive role in NF-\u03baB activation in the context of viral infection. In addition, the expression level of IFNs-related genes: bcMAVS, bcSTING and bcIFNa , ISGs: bcMx1 (Xiao et al., 2016) and bcViperin, and the GCRV-induced gene 2 (bcgig2) in MPF cells were holistically higher when the cells were transfected with bcTRAF3, despite the infection with GCRV or not (Fig. 5 I \u223c L) . Both bcMAVS and bcSTING were proved to be the critical antiviral signaling proteins in previous studies, which led to the investigation of the expression of these two genes in MPF cells in the condition of bcTRAF3 overexpression. The mRNA level of bcMAVS did not changed much in the cells transfected with bcTRAF3 despite the viral infection or not; however, exogenous bcTRAF3 prominently up-regulated the transcription of bcSTING ( Fig. 5G and H) . Thus, the q-PCR data implied the collaboration between bcTRAF3 and bcSTING when the host cell was subjected to pathogen invasion.",

Notably, TRAF3 is a master regulator at the crossroads of antiviral and anti-inflammatory pathways; its deletion in myeloid cells leads to inflammatory diseases and cancer in mice (Guven-Maiorov et al., 2016) . Black carp contributes importantly to the fresh water industry of China; however, its innate immune system remains much unknown. In our previous study, MDA5 (melanoma differentiation associated gene 5), LGP2 (Laboratory of Genetics and Physiology 2), MAVS, STING, TBK1 and IKK\u03b5 were cloned and characterized from this cyprinid fish (named as bcMDA5, bcLGP2, bcMAVS, bcSTING, bcTBK1 and bcIKK\u03b5 accordingly). These black carp RLR signaling components, like their mammalian counterparts, activate the production of interferon (IFN) and boast their antiviral activity in EPC cells. At the same time, the roles of bcTRAF2 and bcTRAF6, two other black carp TRAF members, during host innate immune activation have been identified, which functions positively in bcMAVS-mediated antiviral signaling (Chen et al., 2017a; Jiang et al., 2017) . In the IF data of this study, brilliant green dots (bcTRAF3 expression area) were scattering in the cytoplasm, and the similar phenomenon was seen in the immunofluorescence microscopy data of both bcTRAF2 and bcTRAF6 (Chen et al., 2017a; Jiang et al., 2017) , which implied that these three TRAF family members of black carp may have the similar mechanism to associated with vesicle or form aggregates.",

Importantly, deletion of TRAF3 has identified it as a critical mediator involved in the induction of the type I IFNs by the RLR pathway and other report has suggested that TRAF3 functions as a negative regulator of NF-\u03baB (He et al., 2007; Liao et al., 2004) . bcTRAF3, like bcTRAF2 and bcTRAF3, scattered in the cytoplasm presenting as the brilliant dots in IF data, which co-related with the data of mammalian TRAF3 (van Zuylen et al., 2012) . However, bcTRAF3 showed the ability in NF-\u03baB activation in reporter assay like bcTRAF2/6 and q-PCR data, which is different to mammalian TRAF3, an inhibitor in NF-\u03baB pathway (He et al., , 2007 Liao et al., 2004) and showed that bcTRAF3 is mainly involved in the activation of non-canonical NF-\u03baB (RelB-p52) pathway in its host. Similar to TRAF3 of mammals, bcTRAF3 showed much stronger ability than that of bcTRAF2/6 in IFN activation in reporter assay of EPC cells, which suggested the different roles of TRAF members of black carp (Chen et al., 2017a; Jiang et al., 2017) .",

            "text": "Besides its role in the DNA sensing signaling, STING is now considered an important adaptor of innate immune signaling in response to RNA viruses (Ran et al., 2014; Sun et al., 2011) . STING is an originally found ER-resident protein, which in response to dsDNA treatment, has been verified to traffic from the ER to the Golgi giving rise to punctate structure formation (van Zuylen et al., 2012) . In the previous study, the subcellular distribution of bcSTING was overlapped with that of bcMAVS, when these two proteins were co-expressed in EPC cells or the cells were subjected to poly (I:C) stimulation or virus infection (Lu et al., 2017) . There were few in vitro and in vivo reports investigating the association between STING and TRAF3 in human and mammals. It had been discovered that SARS coronavirus could inhibit type-I interferon signaling pathway through disturbing the interaction of STING and TRAF3 (Chen et al., 2014) . Also, it was reported that the Gn proteins cytoplasmic tail (Gn-T) of hantavirus interferes with the formation of STING-TBK1-TRAF3 complexes required for IRF3 activation and IFN induction (Matthys and Mackow, 2012) . However, up to now, there is no evidence showed the relation between STING and TRAF3 in fish. In our study, the IF data of this paper showed that bcSTING-expressing region matched that of bcTRAF3-expressing region very well when the EPC cells were co-transfected with both bcSTING and bcTRAF3 (Fig. 6) , which is discovered in teleost fish for the first time. However, the direct associate on between bcTRAF3 and bcSTING could not be detected through co-immunoprecipitation method in this lab. What is more, bcTRAF2/6 functioned positively in bcMAVS-mediated antiviral signaling and bcTRAF2/6 overlapped with bcMAVS in IF data of EPC cells (Chen et al., 2017a; Jiang et al., 2017) . The study on bcTBK1 showed that bcTRAF6 associated wtith bcTBK1 in the IF data and bcTRAF6 upregulated bcTBK1-mediated IFN production . Thus, it is implied that a signaling complex including bcMAVS, bcSTING, bcTRAF2/3/6 and bcTBK1 was formed during host innate immune response initiated by GCRV/SVCV, which is similar to that of human and mice (Jiang, 2010; Zhao et al., 2016; Zhong et al., 2008) . The recruiting mechanism of these factors during the innate immune activation of black carp will be further investigated and it is speculated that the membranous network consisted of the ER, Golgi and mitochondria constitutes a convenient platform on which antiviral cell-signaling complexes are arranged and optimally activated like its mammalian counterparts (van Zuylen et al., 2012) . Fig. 7 . bcTRAF3 up-regulated bcSTING-mediated antiviral signaling. A&B. EPC cells in 24-well plate (2 \u00d7 10 5 cells/well) were co-transfected with pRL-TK, DrIFN\u03c61/3pro-luc, bcTRAF3 and/or bcSTING, and applied to reporter assay. C. EPC cells in 24-well plate (2 \u00d7 10 5 cells/well) were co-transfected with bcTRAF3 and/or bcSTING. The transfected cells were infected with GCRV (MOI = 0.1 or MOI = 1) at 24 h post-transfection and the virus titers in the supernatant media were determined by plaque assay at 48 h post-infection. D. EPC cells in 24-well plate (2 \u00d7 10 5 cells/well) were co-transfected with bcTRAF3 and/or bcSTING. The transfected cells were infected with SVCV (MOI = 1 or MOI = 2.5) at 24 h post-transfection and the virus titers in the supernatant media were determined by plaque assay at 48 h post-infection. The numbers above the error bars stand for average virus titer and error bars denote mean with standard deviation and data represent three independent experiments. bcTRAF3: pcDNA5/FRT/TO-HA-bcTRAF3; bcSTING: pcDNA5/FRT/TO-HA-bcSTING; Mock: cells without transfection; pcDNA5: cells transfected with the empty vector; S: pcDNA5/FRT/TO-HA-bcSTING; T: pcDNA5/FRT/TO-HA-bcTRAF3; S + T: pcDNA5/FRT/TO-HA-bcSTING & pcDNA5/FRT/TO-HA-bcTRAF3; Numbers stand for the average virus titer (Log 10 pfu/ml).",
