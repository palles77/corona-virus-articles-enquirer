Two sets of climatic conditions were used in the experiments; (1) representing common office environment (25\u00b0C and 79% RH) and (2) climatic conditions of the Middle Eastern region where the virus was originated from (38\u00b0C and 24% RH). At the lower temperature, the virus demonstrated high robustness and strong capability to survive with about 63.5% of microorganisms remaining infectious 60 min after aerosolisation. Fortunately, virus decay was much stronger for hot and dry air scenario with only 4.7% survival over 60 min procedure. Fig. 4.

They include influenza virus, SARS virus, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, foot and mouth decease and many others (French, Kelly, Jones, & Clancy, 2002; Sergeev et al., 2013) . First periodicals characterizing viral capability to survive in airborne form appeared in 1960s (Harper, 1961 (Harper, , 1963 Hemmes, Kool, & Winkler, 1962; Hemmes, Winkler, & Kool, 1960; Hood, 1963) , where the authors reported very interesting outcomes on airborne virus behaviour and transmission efficiency. A comprehensive study on survival of various strains of airborne influenza virus was recently reported by Pyankov, Pyankova, and Agranovski (2012) showing presence of virulent virus even 90 min after aerosolization.",

These outbreaks ignited strong research interest towards identification of virus transmission routs (Atkinson & Wein, 2008; Spekreijse, Bouma, Koch, & Stegeman, 2011; Tellier, 2006) , exposure effects (Agranovski et al., 2010; Hermann, Mu\u00f1oz-Zanzib, & Zimmerman, 2009; Kwon & Swayne, 2010) and transmission dynamics (Lipsitch et al., 2003) . Also, a number of monitoring methods and techniques has been developed to meet the demand for conventional (Agranovski et al., 2004 (Agranovski et al., , 2005 Agranovski, Agranovski, Reponen, Willeke, & Grinshpun, 2002; Agranovski, Myojo, & Braddock, 2001; Agranovski, Safatov, Agafonov, Pyankov, & Sergeev, 2008; Hermann et al., 2006) , and rapid detection of targeted pathogens in the ambient air (Agranovski et al., 2006; Pyankov et al., 2007; Usachev, Usacheva, & Agranovski, 2013) . A comprehensive review by Weber and Stilianakis (2008) was produced at that stage describing corresponding research outcomes on virus inactivation and discussing models of the virus transmission. A number of important parameters of air influencing microorganism survival and delivery have been identified including air temperature and humidity, microbial resistance to external physical and biological stresses, solar intensity and others.",

A virus containing suspension was prepared and aerosolized to the experimental aerosol chamber by a 3-jet Collison nebulizer (BGI, Inc., USA) at the flowrate of 6 L/min of HEPA-filtered compressed air over 2 min time. Then the nebulizer was switched off. The experiments were performed for two sets of parameters of the air; (1) representing common office environment (25\u00b0C and 79% RH), and (2) climatic conditions of the Middle Eastern region where the virus was originated from (38\u00b0C and 24% RH). To minimise gravitational aerosol settlement during experiments, our previously developed rotational aerosol chamber (RAC) (Pyankov et al., 2012) was used in this project. It consists of a drum secured on a stationary axis with air-sealed ball bearings. The design of the axis enables to host pipelines used for aerosol charging and monitoring. The RAC was placed in the biosafety compartment to eliminate contamination of the laboratory air with viruses. The second reason to use the compartment was based on a fact that, as required by the experimental program, the virus survival ought to be investigated at elevated temperatures representing Middle Eastern climatic conditionsplace of origin and maximum spread of the investigated microorganism. To achieve constant elevated temperature in the RAC over the entire experimental runs, the air in the compartment was heated up to a required value and then used to make up air drawn from the chamber by the samplers, as well as insulating the RAC from colder ambient air in the laboratory minimizing temperature fluctuations inside the RAC. The constant air humidity was achieved by adding required amount of steam to the compartment by the air humidifier (Model 7146, Air-O-Swiss, Switzerland). The air temperature and relative humidity were monitored in the RAC with the accuracy of \u00b1 0.5\u00b0C and \u00b1 2% respectively over the entire experimental procedure. The particle concentration and size distribution inside the chamber were monitored by optical particle counter (Model 4705, Aeronanotech, Moscow, Russia) with 5 min increments over the entire runs. To monitor viable virus concentration, two personal bioaerosol samplers (Agranovski et al., 2002 (Agranovski et al., , 2005 were charged with 40 ml of collecting liquid (see description below) and sampled aerosol from the chamber in parallel at a flow rate of 4 L/min over 2 min time at 0, 5, 15, 30 and 60 min after virus aerosolization. To arrange sampling from inside the chamber by externally located samplers, the standard inlets of the devices (Agranovski et al., 2005) were modified and equipped with pipes enabling hermetic connection with the aerosol chamber. Fresh pair of samplers was used for each time point. Using of two samplers in parallel eliminated risk of not representative result acquisition due to potential random human error or technological fault of the equipment.",

However, taking into account very steady time-related RT-PCR results reflecting not significant reduction of airborne virus presence in the air, one could conclude that the particle concentration decrease is minimal and the reason for such visual effect is based on intensive particle evaporation with corresponding diameter decrease below 0.3 \u00b5m, which makes aerosol invisible for the optical counter.

It should be noticed that, regardless to the fact that the results for different climatic conditions presented in Fig. 4 look quite different almost from the very beginning of the experiments, no statistically significant variations were detected over the first 15 min of operation. In contrast, the results obtained for 30 and 60 min of the experimental runs demonstrated statistically significant difference in microbial decays at different climatic conditions in all samples.",

It was found the at the temperature of 25\u00b0C the virus demonstrated relatively high, compared to influenza strains, survival with more than 63% live particles remaining in the air 60 min after aerosolisation. The inactivation at the temperature of 38\u00b0C was fortunately much more efficient with only 4.7% active virus detected on completion of 60 min run. Such results demonstrate that even at hot and dry climatic conditions relevant to the Middle Eastern region where this virus was originated from, the strain is able to survive for quite long time periods and could potentially spread resulting from respiratory transmission.",
