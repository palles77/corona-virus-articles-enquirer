Moreover, an understanding of viral protein function has paved the way for the development of antiviral drugs that target viral enzymatic activities. However, many of these drugs function poorly at best, and the virus-centric approach has not proven to be well suited for deciphering the complex and multifaceted virus-host interactions that underlie viral recognition, innate immune signalling and disease outcome.

Systems biology is highly interdisciplinary in character, requiring the combined talents of biologists, mathematicians and computer scientists, and has as its goal a comprehensive understanding of biological systems. In the case of systems virology, these biological systems may range from virus-infected cells to tissues to whole organisms. Systems-level analyses use high-throughput technologies to measure systemwide changes in biological components such as DNA, RNA, proteins and metabolites, and are dependent on the quality of the resulting data sets (which are often noisy) and subsequent data integration and modelling. Ideally, high-throughput data derived from these and other measurements are integrated and analyzed using mathematical algorithms to generate predictive models of the system. Once a model has been developed, subsequent experimental perturbations of the system (for example, viral mutants or targeted inhibition of host genes or pathways) are used to yield refinements to the model and to increase its predictive capacity (FIG. 1) ",

Moreover, for dynamical systems such as those involved in the host response to viral infection, systems-level analyses are considered that only way to understand emergent properties; that is, properties or biological outcomes that cannot be predicted by an understanding of the individual parts of a system alone, but rather only become apparent with knowledge of the specific organization and interactions between components 5 .

These accomplishments did not come from a single experiment or study, but rather from a body of work undertaken over several years by different investigators. The field has seen a progression from genomic-based approaches to measurements of proteins and metabolites and the embracing of host genetic variation as a means to better understand disease processes rather than as a source of frustration. Moving forward, systems virology must also embrace computational approaches capable of integrating this information to construct robust models of virus-host interactions that incorporate multiple dimensions and scales 6, 7 .",

Over the past 12 years, DNA microarrays have evolved from hundreds of cDNAs spotted on nylon membranes to glass slides containing high-density oligonucleotides that encompass entire genomes (BOX 1). Microarrays (then covering only 1,500 human genes) were first used in virology to evaluate the changes in cellular gene expression that occurred in a CD4+ T cell line infected with HIV 8 . Since then, the use of microarrays to evaluate changes in host gene expression in response to virus infection has become commonplace. In many cases, these studies remain small and narrowly focused, and although they provide glimpses into global responses, low sample numbers make it difficult to determine reproducibility. In addition, they do not provide the robust data sets that are needed for computational modelling that could result in deep insights into system architecture or behaviour. This shortcoming has perhaps fed skepticism regarding the ability of genomewide expression profiling to yield transformative discoveries. Below, we provide examples of more comprehensive studies resulting in genomic signatures that have increased our understanding of viral pathogenesis and the characteristics of the host response required for immune protection.",

By contrast, macaques infected with a highly pathogenic avian H5N1 strain show a rapid and intense induction of interferon and innate immune genes that eventually resolves as the animals recover 14 . Genomic analyses have also revealed that macaques infected with the 1918 pandemic strain 15 and mice infected with A/VN/1203/04 H5N1 virus show a strong induction of genes encoding inflammasome components (for example, NLRP3 and IL-1\u03b2) 16 .

Two alternative methods were used to generate gene expression signatures that are predictive of high or low pathogenicity (defined here as 100% mortality or survival, respectively). The first signature consists of 74 genes the expression of which changes in the opposite direction with respect to mock infections (referred to as a 'digital' relationship). The second signature consists of 57 genes that are differentially expressed between high-and low-pathogenic infections, without reference to mock infections (referred to as an 'analogue' relationship).

However, the majority of samples that were correctly identified as being from either a low or high pathogenic infection were from early or late time points, respectively.

The magnitude and timing of the host response are critical determinants of eventual disease outcome, and this may have important implications for antiviral therapy. To date, efforts to target the host response with a variety of antiinflammatory drugs have been largely unsuccessful 13 , and it is likely that effective hostdirected therapy will depend not only on the target, but on the timing at which elements of the host response are suppressed or enhanced. Moreover, these findings point to the need for computational approaches that can describe nonlinear relationships (see below) and account for various factors associated with large multivariate datasets 21 .

Although also characteristic of the transcriptional response to active virus infection, this response did not correlate with subsequent CD8 + T cell or neutralizing antibody responses, which are thought to mediate protection. However, an alternative computational and classification method, discriminant analysis via mixed integer programming (DAMIP), identified a signature (consisting of complement system and stress response genes) that is highly accurate in predicting subsequent CD8 + T cell activation. This method also identified a separate signature (which includes TNF receptor superfamily members) that accurately predicts neutralizing antibody expression during infection. The robustness of these signatures was verified through the analysis of samples from a different group of subjects vaccinated with a different lot of vaccine, thereby identifying new correlates of vaccine immunogenicity.",

Over a 3-year period, a series of clinical studies was undertaken in which young adults were vaccinated with either inactivated influenza vaccine (TIV) or live-attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV). Molecular signatures for predicting antibody responses were identified by combining gene expression profiling, antibody response data, real-time PCR analysis and DAMIP. The resulting predictive signature consisted of genes with known roles in antibody response and other genes with previously unidentified roles in antibody or B cell responses. For example, one gene from the predictive signature, CAMK4, encodes CaMKIV kinase, a protein known at the time to be involved in multiple immune system processes. However, it was not known if it had a role in antibody responses 25 . To demonstrate the ability of the systems biology approaches used in this study to identify biologically significant targets,CAMK4-knockout mice were vaccinated with TIV and exhibited significantly higher antibody titers on days 7, 14, and 28 days after vaccination compared with wild-type mice, thus confirming the hypothesis that CAMK4 is important in regulating B cell responses. Although further investigations are needed to confirm many of these signature predictions, these studies demonstrate that systems approaches can both identify biological targets and generate new testable hypotheses related to the mechanism of vaccine action.",

The metabolic signature induced by HCMV infection is readily distinguishable from the signature associated with the transition of quiescent cells into the G1 phase of the cell cycle, revealing the replacement of cellular metabolic homeostasis with a HCMV-specific metabolic programme. Systems-level metabolic flux profiling [G] produced a first-of-a-kind metabolic map showing linkages between compounds and quantitative information about metabolic activity.

In a first attempt at such integration, meta-analysis of virus-host interactome data for five distinct viruses identified both common and virus-specific human protein targets 56 . Common targets include proteins involved in the cell cycle, apoptosis, the unfolded protein response and nuclear transport. Many of the common host targets identified are multifunctional hubs -that is, they have multiple functions or roles within the cell. When coupled with the fact that many viral proteins interact with multiple host proteins, this combination of factors may explain how viruses, with their relatively small genomes, are capable of dysregulating so many aspects of host biology. Unfortunately, because these common host targets often have numerous cellular functions, focusing on them as drug targets may be problematic 52 .",

By defining the rewiring of cellular networks and pathways caused by the viral proteins, and identifying a list of host proteins central to the rewiring, the systematic identification of host targets of DNA tumour viruses was found to be as successful as traditional large-scale cataloging of tumour mutations for cancer gene identification.

Structural equation modelling [G] was used to identify potential regulatory relationships between additional genes and the validated eQTL, suggesting that these genes and corresponding sub-networks play important roles in the host response by either promoting a protective (mild response) or a pathologic (severe response) to influenza infection depending on the specific genetics of the host.

This database contains cell-type specific gene expression patterns associated with various types of immune cells. By computationally comparing differentially expressed genes in BAL with cell-type specific gene expression patterns in the IRIS database, it was possible to identify genes associated with specific immune cell types including activated dendritic cells, CD4 and CD8 T cells and na\u00efve B cells. In particular genes associated with T and B cell markers were more highly upregulated in young adult animals 74 . Recent studies of mouse models of intestinal inflammation induced by TNF treatment provide a good example of how systems approaches can be used to evaluate signalling between cell types in a complex tissue environment 75, 76 . Phosphoprotein, cytokine, chemokine and flow cytometry measurements from various immune cell types over time and under diverse conditions were combined to construct statistically robust multivariate regression models that related the phosphoprotein signals, cytokines and cell types to specific phenotypes. These models helped to elucidate key molecular and cellular processes governing epithelial cell apoptosis and proliferation in response to TNF treatment. For example, monocyte chemotactic protein 1 (MCP1) was predicted by the model to be especially protective against TNF-induced apoptosis, which was confirmed by treating with anti-MCP1 antibody prior to TNF administration. The model also indicated that plasmacytoid dendritic cells might be particularly important, a prediction that was confirmed by depleting these cells from mice under conditions that produced the most severe epithelial cell apoptosis; this reverted the TNF-induced phenotype to the mildest outcome.",

Similar evidence is accumulating that infectious outcome of HIV is also related to the activation dynamics of host gene regulation 77, 78 . However, high-throughput data are typically static and often not adequate for modelling dynamical systems. To help overcome this limitation in analyzing network dynamics, inference methodologies are being devised to reinterpret activity differences due to system perturbation as differences in observation time. For example, changes in pathogen-induced gene expression that are associated with genetic variability, both on the side of the pathogen (e.gg, mutant viruses) and the host (as occurs in the Collaborative Cross mouse model), can principally be used to indirectly infer the critical dynamics of a system without having to measure the system over time.

SVD-MDS and co-abundance networks (which relate molecules on the basis of their abundance profiles) were also used to integrate proteomic and metabolomic data sets obtained from the same cohort of patients. This strategy identified a potential role for oxidative stress in rapid fibrosis progression post-transplant and identified serum metabolites that may prove useful as biomarkers for predicting progression to fibrosis 84 . This understanding of network structure can now be used to simulate human liver metabolism using novel flux-balance modelling approaches to better comprehend and eventually treat disease 85 . Additional geometric approaches have been described and should prove useful for effectively bridging different technologies 86, 87 and for integrating diverse types of data, thereby better leveraging data already available in public databases and repositories. Finally, geometric methods, and links between geometry, information theory and probability theory 7 , will also help to identify causal relationships 88 , which is clearly a currently unmetchallenge. Unlike purely statistical approaches, geometric methods can be used to integrate different individual measures for the purposes of comparison and combination into coherent objects that identify relationships between genes, transcripts or proteins.",

Also of importance is the ever-growing availability of high-throughput data in public databases; indeed, data sharing is crucial to the future success of systems virology (BOX 4) . To date, bench work has been the necessary precedent to computational approaches, but we are now at a point where sufficient data are available that computational methods can be the starting point for making discoveries, generating hypotheses and in turn guiding targeted bench work. A prime example of this is the flourishing of virtual screening methods in drug discovery, which depend on systematic drug characterization efforts and public databases holding functional genomics information obtained under standard experimental conditions 89, 90 . Moreover, the information gained from systems approaches form the basis for what has been termed P4 medicine: personalized, predictive, preventive and participatory 91 . In the case of infectious disease, genetic information on the individual and the pathogen, disease-predictive molecular signatures, targeted risk reduction and prophylactic measures, and active patient participation will merge into a new approach to medical care 92 .",

Today, major commercial providers of microarrays include Affymetrix, Agilent Technologies, Illumina and NimbleGen, with platforms varying in the length of oligonucleotide used, the number of oligonucleotides representing each gene, and the methods used for oligonucleotide synthesis and attachment to solid supports. Although microarrays are best known for their use in profiling the expression of protein-coding genes, the technology has also been adapted for the profiling of microRNA expression, DNA methylation and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), as well as for promoter analysis and the detection of genome-wide DNA copy number variation.

This has a number of advantages over microarray-based profiling, including the ability to identify and quantify rare or as-yet-undiscovered transcripts and to provide information on alternative splicing, genetic variation, and gene and exon boundaries. The method of cDNA library construction used determines the type of transcripts to be sequenced: small (less than about 200 bases) RNA sequencing (for example, microRNAs, snoRNAs and piRNAs), mRNA sequencing (various types of polyadenylated transcripts) or whole-transcriptome sequencing (polyadenylated and non-polyadenylated transcripts). Once sequence reads are generated, they are aligned to a known reference genome, or if no reference genome is available, sequences can be assembled de novo. Because of the short length of sequence reads, the alignment and assembly of sequence information is a significant computational challenge 100 .

Once established, RI lines can be intercrossed among themselves to generate recombinant intercross (RIX) lines or backcrossed to other non-Collaborative Cross lines to generate recombinant inbred backcross (RIB) lines. RIX lines maximize genetic diversity, and because they are outbred, they are better models of human populations and they can provide information on gene dominance and epistasis [G] 104 . RIB lines can be used, for example, to evaluate whether specific allele combinations alter the phenotype associated with a given target gene (for example, a dominant targeted gene knockout). Comparison between viral titer in lungs and the extent of airway inflammation from a panel of pre-Collaborative Cross mice (not fully inbred) demonstrates the impact of genetic diversity on influenza virus disease phenotypes (see the figure; each diamond represents a different mouse). Phenotypes range from high viral titer and inflammation to low viral titer and little inflammation; in addition, some animals show unique phenotypes, such as high viral titer with little accompanying inflammation.

            "text": "The rapid dissemination of high-throughput omics data sets to the scientific community is an important element for the future success of systems virology. It is only through metaanalyses that rely on advanced computational and mathematical approaches and the integration of large, coherent and systematic multi-dimensional data sets that the complexity of virus-host interactions can be unraveled. Owing to the immense amount of time, expertise, manpower and expense that are required to produce these data sets, it is imperative for the systems virology community to share data in a timely manner. In most cases, owing to the richness of information contained in these data sets, this can be done with little chance of compromising one's own research. Two of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) sponsored Bioinformatics Resource Centers, ViPR and IRD, are charged with capturing, publically sharing, storing, integrating and visualizing systems-wide high-throughput omics data sets (both raw and processed) that detail the host response to virus infection. Importantly, in addition to capturing data types such as transcriptomic, proteomic, metabolomic, lipidomic and ChIP-Seq, their goal is to capture extensive metadata, which provide users with the experimental details needed to facilitate data interpretation. The practice of linking metadata to several forms of the omics data (raw, analyzed or modeled) enables ViPR and IRD to meet the demands of a range of end users (see the figure) . For instance, at their portals, users can search for information on individual genes, download lists of differentially expressed genes or link metadata to raw data for doing meta-analysis. All laboratories, as a service to the community, should be committed to sharing these types of data sets, whether through organization-specific public websites, the appropriate NIAID Bioinformatics Resource Center, or a combination of both.",

Data analysis and mathematical modelling are combined to generate comprehensive, integrated, and predictive molecular networks of biological systems and virus-host interactions. Resulting predictions and hypotheses lead to a subsequent round or cycle of biological perturbations. Completion of each cycle results in model refinement and a deeper understanding of complex biological processes. These findings and outcomes can be used directly or further refined by the scientific community for various types of disease intervention.
