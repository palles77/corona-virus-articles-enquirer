Influenza B and C viruses are resistant. 1 In the past, epidemic human and avian strains of influenza viruses have generally been susceptible to amantadine. 2 However, since 2008 2009, isolates of influenza A/H1N1 and H3N2, highly pathogenic avian H5N1, and A (H1N1)pdm09 are resistant to amantadine and rimantadine (see later discussion). 3 By plaque assay, inhibitory con centrations of the drugs range from 0.1 to 0.4 \u00b5g/mL or less for sensi tive human influenza A viruses. Rimantadine is 4 to 10 times more active than amantadine in some assay systems. Both drugs are inhibi tory for virus containing the M protein from the 1918 pandemic strain. 4 Higher concentrations (10 to 50 \u00b5g/mL) inhibit other enveloped viruses in vitro, including parainfluenza, influenza B, rubella, dengue, several arenaviruses (Junin, Lassa, Pichinde), rabies, and African swine fever virus, but these concentrations are not achievable clinically and can be cytotoxic in vitro. 5 Rimantadine has pHdependent trypanocidal activity at concentrations of approximately 1 \u00b5g/mL 6 ; amantadine at the same concentration in combination with doxycy cline inhibits Coxiella burnetii. 7 Amantadine may transiently inhibit hepatitis C virus (HCV) replication in humans. 8 These agents have prophylactic and therapeutic activity in experi mental influenza A virus infection of animals after oral or parenteral dosing. Combinations of M2 inhibitors and neuraminidase inhibitors and ribavirin show enhanced antiviral and therapeutic effects in vitro or in animal models of influenza. 912",

Low concentrations inhibit the ion channel function of the M2 protein of influenza A viruses, which affects two different stages in virus replication. 1315 The primary effect involves inhibition of viral uncoating or disassembly of the virion during endocytosis. For subtype H5 and H7 viruses, a late effect on hemagglutinin maturation and viral assembly is presumably mediated through altered pH regulation of the transGolgi network. Amantadine and rimantadine block proton permeation and prevent M2mediated changes in pH. This action probably accounts for inhibition of the acidmediated dissociation of the matrix protein from the ribonucleo protein complex within endosomes early in replication and potentia tion of acidic pH-induced alterations in the hemagglutinin during its transport late in infection.",

Administration of DAS181 appeared to be generally well tolerated, although transient elevations in alkaline phosphatase level were reported. 73 DAS181 has also been utilized to treat parainfluenza virus type 3 infections in lung transplant and stem cell transplant patients. 74,75 These case reports described clinical improvement, increased pulmonary (1 to 5 \u00b5g/mL). 45 Neurotoxic reactions may be transiently reversed by physostigmine administration, and lidocaine has been used to treat ventricular arrhythmias. Longterm amantadine ingestion has been associated with livedo reticularis, peripheral edema, orthostatic hypo tension, and, rarely, congestive heart failure, vision loss, or urinary retention. Peripheral edema and livedo reticularis may improve if treatment is switched from amantadine to rimantadine. 46 Patients with preexisting seizure disorders have an increased frequency of major motor seizures during amantadine use, and dosage reductions are advised. Psychiatric side effects in patients with Parkinson's disease and psychotic exacerbations in patients with schizophrenia may occur with addition of amantadine. Rash and leukopenia have been described rarely.",

The emergence of widespread and nearly complete amantadine resistance among influenza A/H3N2 isolates, 26 as well as the amantadine resis tance of the pandemic A (H1N1)pdm09 strains, precludes the empiri cal use of adamantanes for management of an untyped influenza A outbreak. Amantadine and rimantadine, both at a dosage of 200 mg/ day in adults, are about 70% to 90% protective against clinical illness caused by various susceptible influenza A subtypes, including suscep tible pandemic strains. 51 Prophylaxis is effective in preventing nosoco mial influenza and possibly in curtailing nosocomial outbreaks caused by such strains. Protection seems to be additive to that provided by vaccine. 52 Rimantadine was less effective than zanamivir in reducing cases of influenza A illness in adults in a longterm care facility. 53 The difference in protective efficacy was largely due to the emergence of rimantadine resistant viruses that caused rimantadine prophylactic failure; no zanamivirresistant viruses were isolated. Rimantadine administration to schoolaged children (5 mg/kg/day) decreased the risk for influenza A illness in recipients and possibly in their family contacts. Postexpo sure prophylaxis with these drugs provided inconsistent protection to family contacts, however, in part, depending on whether ill index chil dren were treated. 19 Dosages of 100 mg/day seem to be protective against influenza A illness and are well tolerated in adults. 54 Spectrum Laninamivir octanoate exhibits little or no influenza virus neuramini dase inhibitory activity in vitro. 77 However, its hydrolysis product is a potent inhibitor of neuraminidases of N1 to N9 influenza A viruses plus influenza B and their replication in cell culture at nanomolar concentrations. 78 These include seasonal and pandemic influenza A/ H1N1, highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 viruses, and clinical isolates of oseltamivirresistant H1N1, H3N2, H5N1, and A (H1N1)pdm09. Median inhibitory concentrations in cell culture vary over a wide range and in general appear to be intermediate between those of oseltamivir carboxylate (lower) and zanamivir (higher), but the clinical importance of these differences is not yet known.",

In these trials, lanina mivir octanoate has been administered as an orally inhaled powder with a proprietary device that has two containers of 10mg dry lanina mivir octanoate powder. The manufacturer's instructions recommend two inhalations from each 10mg changer. For children, four inhala tions are necessary, whereas eight inhalations from two devices are required for adults. Occasionally, young children do not inhale the medication completely owing to technical difficulty with the device. 87 Of 87 pediatric patients with influenza of less than 48 hours in duration, 44 were randomized to treatment with a single inhaled dose of laninamivir octanoate (N = 55), 20 or 40 mg, according to age, or inhaled zanamivir, 10 mg twice daily for 5 days (N = 41). 87 Median times to fever resolution were 36 hours in the laninamivir octanoate groups and 37 hours in the zanamivirtreated group. This relatively small study suggested that a single dose of inhaled laninamivir octano ate was as efficacious as the recommended 5day treatment with zana mivir.

The median times to alleviation of influenza illness in children were significantly less (49.6 and 44.3 hours) in the 40 and 20mg laninamivir groups, respectively, than in the oseltamivirtreated group (110.5 hours). Treatment effects on virus concentration and persistence in upper airway secretions were inconsistent, although on day 3, 10%, none, and 25% of subjects in the three groups, respectively, were still excreting virus.

Laninamivir concentrations in epithelial lining fluid exceeded the median inhibitory concentrations for influenza neuraminidases at all time points for 240 hours after dose inhalation. In other healthy adult volunteers, evaluation of the phar macokinetics of laninamivir octanoate and laninamivir was done after oral inhalation of single doses from 5 to 120 mg. 83 Laninamivir octano ate appeared rapidly in plasma with a C max at 0.5 to 1.0 hour compared with 4.0 hours for laninamivir. Plasma t elim 1 2 values were 1.8 and 71.6 to 80.8 hours, respectively. The plasma area under the concentration time curve (AUC) of laninamivir octanoate was linearly related to dose, while that of laninamivir increased disproproportionately.

Geometric mean laninamivir octanoate clearance values declined from 26.0 mL/ min in normal control subjects to 6.5 mL/min in patients with severe renal impairment. However, t elim 1 2 values were 2.3 to 3.5 hours and not different among the four groups. Laninamivir renal clearance declined from 65.0 to 12.7 mL/min across the four groups, whereas t elim 1 2 was not different among the groups, ranging from 53.2 to 57.0 hours. The likely explanation is that the elimination of both laninamivir octanoate and laninamivir reflect slow release of these compounds from tissues into plasma, rather than renal elimination, a pharmacokinetic concept called \"flipflop. \" 86 These pharmacokinetic data indicate that reduction of laninamivir octanoate doses may be appropriate for patients with renal impairment for pharmacokinetic reasons, but the lack of clear doserelated toxicity (see later) and the minimal absorption of orally inhaled drugs suggest that no dose adjustment will be needed.",

Most of these variants retain full susceptibility in vivo. 98 Neuraminidase vari ants contain single aminoacid substitutions in the framework or cata lytic residues of the active enzyme site that alter drug binding and cause approximately 30fold to more than 1000fold reduced suscepti bility in enzyme inhibition assays. 96 Influenza A variants selected by oseltamivir carboxylate are subtype specific, most commonly Arg292Lys in N2 and H275Y in N1, without crossresistance to zana mivir. The altered neuraminidases have reduced activity or stability in vitro, and early studies of these variants usually demonstrated decreased infectivity and transmissibility in animals. 111 Oseltamivir therapy has been associated with recovery of viruses with reduced susceptibility in about 1% of immunocompetent adult and 18% of pediatric recipients. 112, 113 Generally, emergence of resistant variants has not been associated with clinical worsening, although prolonged recovery of resistant variants, sometimes in combination with M2 inhibitor resistance, has been observed in highly immuno compromised hosts. 114 Transmission of oseltamivirresistant virus has been documented. 115, 116 Although isolation of oseltamivirresistant strains from treated immunocompetent patients was uncommon, in 20072008, oseltamivir resistant seasonal H1N1 virus appeared widely in immunocompetent individuals in Norway in the absence of antiviral pressure. 117 This mutant virus became the transmissible, pathogenic prevalent global H1N1 virus strain. Similarly, during the 2009 A (H1N1)pdm09 pan demic, there was no linkage between prevalent use of oseltamivir in immunocompetent patients and the appearance of oseltamivirresistant A (H1N1)pdm09 strains, which was uncommon. The prevalence of oseltamivirresistance ranged from 0.6% (5/804 strains) tested in Ontario, Canada, 118 to 1.0% in the United States 119 and 1.1% (16/1488 isolates) in Southeast Asia. 120 The prevalence was 8.11% in children whose immunocompetence was not specified. 121 On the other hand, oseltamivirresistant isolates are not uncom monly recovered from immunocompromised patients being treated with the drug. Reports indicated that some of the A (H1N1)pdm09 oseltamivirresistant strains retained replicative fitness, 116 transmissi bility, 122 and pathogenicity comparable with wildtype oseltamivir strains in murine and ferret models of influenza infection. 123 Clinical illness caused by oseltamivirresistant H1N1 strains in immunocom petent children responded less well to oseltamivir, 124 as evidenced by higher fever at day 4 or 5 of treatment, although some found no evi dence of prolonged illness in children infected with drugresistant virus. 125 Others reported a significantly longer time to achieve nonde tectable virus load in patients with oseltamivirresistant H1N1 com pared with oseltamivirsensitive strains. 126 Pharmacokinetics Oral oseltamivir is rapidly absorbed and metabolized by esterases in the gastrointestinal tract, liver, and blood to the active carboxylate. The estimated bioavailability of the carboxylate is approximately 80%, 127 and its time to maximal plasma concentrations averages 2 to 4 hours. Dose proportionality of oseltamivir has been reported over the dose range from 75 to 675 mg. Only low blood levels of the pro drug are detectable. Rarely, possession of a constitutive variant of car boxylesterase 1, the enzyme that normally catalyzes the conversion of less often at day 3 in the laninamivir octanoate 40mg (28%) and 20mg (32%) groups than in the oseltamivir group, which might be con sidered analogous to a placebotreated cohort. Among individuals infected with influenza A H3N2 virus, median times to illness allevia tion were not different between those treated with laninamivir octano ate 40 mg (73.5 hours) and oseltamivir (67.5 hours) but significantly longer in the group treated with laninamivir octanoate 20 mg (91.2 hours). There were no differences among the groups in H3N2 virus concentration in upper airway secretions or persistence. The 95% con fidence intervals of the pooled analysis of all data were less than the prescribed noninferiority margin. It was concluded that a single inha lation of laninamivir octanoate is effective for treatment of seasonal influenza including that caused by oseltamivirresistant virus in adults.",

Oral oseltamivir is active in murine and ferret models of influenza. 94, 97 A prophylactic regimen given orally twice daily for 10 days completely protected ferrets against morbidity and mortality caused by H5N1 infection and did not interfere with development of a protective immunity against subsequent H5N1 infec tion. 104 Neuraminidase inhibitors combined with M2 inhibitors or ribavirin show enhanced antiviral activity in vitro and in animal models of influenza A virus infection, 105 including H5N1 virus. 106, 107 Amantadine combined with oseltamivir prevented the emergence of amantadine resistance in cell culture. 108 ",

Selfinjury, delirium, and psychiatric illness have been reported in patients, primarily pediatric or adoles cent, with influenza treated with oseltamivir, mostly in Japan. 157 Analy ses of neuropsychiatric reactions among patients with influenza treated with oseltamivir in three large U.S. administrative databases did not demonstrate such an association. 158160 The decline in cases in Japan after a regulatory recommendation to restrict oseltamivir use in chil dren 10 to 19 years of age has been associated with a decline in oseltamivirrelated cases but a corresponding rise in cases associated with zanamivir, the inhaled, minimally systemically bioavailable neur aminidase inhibitor. The latter fact raises further doubts about a causal association between oseltamivir therapy and neuropsychiatric and behavioral adverse reactions in patients with influenza. 161 Erythema tous rashes and rare instances of severe eruptions or StevensJohnson syndrome, hepatic inflammation, hemorrhagic colitis, anaphylaxis, and thrombocytopenia have been reported, but their relationship to oseltamivir is uncertain.",

In the United States, it is approved for the prevention of influenza in patients 1 year and older and the treatment of acute uncomplicated influenza in patients 2 weeks of age and older who have been symptomatic for no more than 2 days. 133 In early clinical experiments in volunteers with induced influenza it was demonstrated that oral oseltamivir is highly protective against experimental human influenza, and early treatment is associated with reductions in viral titers, symptoms, nasal cytokines, and middle ear pressure abnormalities. 97 Subsequent controlled trials in patientsmostly healthy adults and children with naturally acquired seasonal influenza A infection-demonstrated that early oseltamivir treatment of acute influenza reduces the time to illness alleviation by 1 to 1 1 2 days, fever duration, and viral titers in the upper respiratory tract. 112, 162164 Earlier treatment maximizes the speed of resolution of illness. 165 Treat ment of children reduces the risk for otitis media and decreases overall antibiotic use. 112 In healthy and highrisk adults, early treatment has been reported to decrease the risk for lower respiratory tract complica tions leading to antibiotic administration and to hospitalization, 166 but this has been questioned. 167 A metaanalysis of observational studies of highrisk patients with seasonal influenza concluded that oseltamivir treatment may reduce hospitalization, whereas treatment of hospital ized patients reduces respiratory failure, intensive care unit admission, and mortality. 168, 169 A recent metaanalysis based on a large number of observational data from individual cases suggested that oseltamivir treatment may be associated with a reduction in mortality risk. 169a However, a Cochrane analysis did not conclude that the evidence indi cated that oseltamivir treatment reduced complications or hospitaliza tions. 169b In hospitalized patients with infection with influenza A (H1N1)pdm09, oseltamivir provides similar benefits even if treatment is started more than 48 hours after clinical illness has begun. 170172 It is uncertain to what extent oseltamivir treatment may reduce transmission, although a review of four trials of prophylaxis suggests that oseltamivir may have reduced transmission. 173, 174 Oseltamivir is less efficacious for the treatment of influenza B than for influenza A virus infection in children 175, 176 and adults. 176 An analy sis of 284 cumulated cases of influenza A (H5N1) infections in a global registry demonstrated that crude mortality was significantly less in those treated with oseltamivir (40%) than in those not treated (76%) when started up to 6 to 8 days after symptoms onset. 177 oseltamivir phosphate to carboxylate, can markedly impair the hydro lysis of the parent compound, resulting in the potential for a compro mised antiviral effect after oseltamivir administration. 128, 129 Ingestion with food delays absorption slightly but does not decrease overall bioavailability. Oseltamivir administered via a nasogastric tube to patients with respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation was well absorbed and converted to oseltamivir carboxylate. 130, 131 In healthy adults, peak and trough plasma concentrations average 0.35 \u00b5g/mL and 0.14 \u00b5g/mL after 75mg doses. 132 In infants up to 1 year of age, systemic exposure (AUC 012 hr ) to the carboxylate exhibits decreasing variability while clearance increases. 121 Recommended doses of oselta mivir are 3.0 mg/kg twice daily for infants from birth to 8 months of age and 3.5 mg/kg twice daily for those 9 to 11 months of age. In children older than 1 year, carboxylate exposure increases gradually with increasing age 132 so that weightbased dosing is recommended. 133 In healthy elderly adults, overall drug exposure is about 25% greater than in younger adults, most likely owing to differences in renal elimi nation. Morbid obesity (body mass index \u226540 kg/m 2 ) does not alter oseltamivir pharmacokinetics. 134 The effects of pregnancy on the phar macokinetics of oseltamivir are unclear. One study reported no differ ences among women in the third trimester of pregnancy and historical controls, 135 whereas another reported a 25% to 30% reduction in systemic (AUC 012 hr ) oseltamivircarboxylate exposure in pregnant women compared with concurrent nonpregnant controls, perhaps suggesting a need for 75 mg three times a day of oseltamivir for treatment. 136 Plasma protein binding of the prodrug (42%) and the carboxylate (<3%) is low. 127 The V d is moderate (23 to 26 L). In animals, lower respiratory tract levels are similar to or exceed the levels in blood 137 ; and in humans, the carboxylate is detectable in middle ear and maxil lary sinus fluid at concentrations similar to those in plasma. 138 Oseltamivir concentrations occur in breast milk. 139 In the ex vivo human placenta model, oseltamivir was extensively metabolized to the carboxylate moiety, but transplacental passage of oseltamivir carboxyl ate occurred at a low rate, inferring that fetal exposure during maternal treatment with oseltamivir may be minimal. 140 No carboxylate was detected in cerebrospinal fluid in one child, 141 whereas C max values in cerebrospinal fluid were 2.1% and 3.5% for corresponding plasma con centrations for oseltamivir and oseltamivir carboxylate in eight healthy adults after ingestion of 150 mg of oseltamivir. 142 After oral oseltamivir, the plasma t elim 1 2 of the carboxylate averages 6 to 10 hours in healthy adults. The prodrug and carboxylate are excreted primarily unchanged through the kidney; the carboxylate is eliminated by glomerular filtra tion and tubular secretion via a probenecidsensitive anionic trans porter. Clearance varies linearly with CrCl, such that t elim 1 2 increases to 22 hours in patients with CrCl less than 30 mL/min, and dosage reductions are needed. 127 Oseltamivir carboxylate is removed with dif ferent degrees of efficiency by different renal replacement therapies (peritoneal, hemodialysis, and continuous renal replacement thera pies). Doses of oseltamivir for patients with renal impairment receiving renal replacement therapy have been published. 143 Uncomplicated influenza illness does not seem to alter the pharma cokinetics of oseltamivir. 127 Cystic fibrosis patients appear to clear osel tamivir carboxylate more rapidly than patients who do not have the disease. 144 Interactions Probenecid reduces renal clearance of oseltamivir by about 50%. 145 Few other clinically important drug interactions have been recognized. Sotalol appeared to induce a torsades de pointes cardiac arrhythmia during oseltamivir therapy for influenza. 146 Specific studies have found no interactions with antacids, acetaminophen, or aspirin or known inhibitors of selected renal tubular secretion pathways, amoxicillin, cimetidine, cyclosporine, mycophenolate, tacrolimus, 127,147 warfarin, 148 or rimantadine. 149 ",

The 600mg dose yielded corresponding values of 36,300 and 32.8 ng/mL. The median inhibitory concentration for 50% of isolates (IC 50 ) for the neuramini dase of the patient viruses ranged from 1.15 nmol/L for influenza A/ H1N1, 1.36 nmol/L for influenza A/H3N2, and 2.81 nmol/L for influ enza B isolates. 204 In pediatric patients 1 month to 15 years of age infected with influenza A (H1N1)pdm09, an intravenous infusion of 10 mg/kg once daily produced comparable plasma concentrations to those seen in young healthy adults (see earlier): median peramivir plasma concentrations were 33,150 ng/mL at the end of the infusion and 20.7 ng/mL 18 to 24 hours later. 207 The relationship of these plasma concentration data to efficacy is unclear.

In individu als with dialysisdependent renal failure, t 1 2 averages 79 hours. In October 2009, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration issued an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for the administration of intra venous peramivir for the treatment of hospitalized patients with sus pected or confirmed cases of influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 infection, because no other intravenous neuraminidase inhibitor drug was avail able. In adults with normal renal function, the recommended intrave nous dose was 600 mg/day; and in children 6 to 17 years of age it was 10 mg/kg intravenously once daily. Doses for other age groups and patients with renal impairment including endstage renal disease requiring different renalreplacement therapies have been suggested. 210 The EUA was terminated in 2010, and peramivir was to be available only through clinical trials (see \"Clinical Studies, \" later).",

No effect on preventing illness caused by influenza B virus was observed, although the duration of virus shedding tended to be less in individuals receiving 400 mg and 800 mg of peramivir. 200 In early studies in patients with influenza, oral peramivir therapy with doses of 400 to 800 mg daily for 5 days 200 and single intramuscular doses of 150 or 300 mg 206 reduced median times to relief of symptoms, but the differences were not statistically significant from controls. Sub sequently, controlled trials with an intravenous formulation demon strated peramivir therapeutic efficacy and tolerance in patients with influenza due to susceptible virus strains. Peramivir treatment of natu rally acquired influenza in young adults with illness of 48 hours' dura tion or less with 300 or 600 mg injected once intravenously versus placebo, reduced median time to relief of symptoms significantly from 82 hours in the placebo group to 59 hours and 60 hours in the pera mivir 300mg and 600mg groups in the outpatient setting. 208 Perami vir treatments also significantly reduced the proportion of subjects still excreting virus in nasal and throat secretions at day 3 from 51% in placebo recipients to 26% to 37% in those treated with peramivir, 600 or 300 mg, respectively. 208 In 137 hospitalized patients randomized to 5 days' treatment with intravenous peramivir, 200 or 400 g/day, compared with historical reports with oral oseltamivir at 75 mg twice daily, the reduction in virus concentration in nasopharyngeal secretion was similar across the three treatments. 211 An additional study utilizing a higher dose of pera mivir (300 mg twice daily or 600 mg four times a day) in 234 hospital ized patients also showed no differences in virologic or clinical end occur during shortterm oral administration. Longterm use of oral ribavirin at dosages greater than 800 mg daily causes hemoglobin decreases of 2 to 4 g/dL in most recipients, usually within 4 weeks. When used in combination with interferon, hemoglobin levels less than 11 g/dL develop in 25% to 30% of patients. 233 Renal impairment increases the risk for hemolysis. Severe anemia requires dosage reduc tion or cessation, although erythropoietin has been used effectively. 233 Other reported side effects include pruritus, myalgia, rash, nausea, depression, nervousness, and cough or respiratory symptoms. 234 High dose intravenous ribavirin is associated with headache, hypomagnese mia, and hypocalcemia. 235 Bolus intravenous dosing may cause rigors, and infusion over 10 to 15 minutes is advised.",

Plasma concentrations average approximately 24 \u00b5g/mL and 17 \u00b5g/mL after intravenous doses of 1000 mg and 500 mg in patients with Lassa fever. During longterm administration, overall exposure and t elim 1 2 increase substantially. 227 Steadystate plasma levels of about 1 to 4 \u00b5g/mL occur by about 4 weeks with weight adjusted dosing in chronic hepatitis C, and higher concentrations at 4 weeks correlate with decline in hemoglobin and likelihood of sustained viral responses. 231 Plasma protein binding is negligible, and ribavirin has a large V d (>2000 L). At steady state, cerebrospinal fluid levels are about 70% of those in plasma. 229 The disposition of ribavirin is complex, involving renal elimination and metabolism. After rapid initial distribution, there is a prolonged terminal t elim 1 2 of 37 to 79 hours. 227229 Ribavirin triphosphate concen trates in erythrocytes with an erythrocytetoplasma ratio of 40 : 1 or greater, and erythrocyte levels gradually decrease, with an apparent t 1 2 of 40 days. Renal excretion accounts for 30% to 60% of ribavirin's overall clearance, but hepatic metabolism is contributory. About 5% to 10% is recovered unchanged in the urine, and a much greater fraction is excreted as triazole carboxamide and carboxylic acid metabolites. 227 Plasma clearance is reduced threefold in patients with advanced renal impairment (CrCl \u226430 mL/min). Dosage adjustments are needed for renal insufficiency, and ribavirin should be used with caution in patients with CrCl less than 50 mL/min. Hemodialysis and hemofiltra tion remove small amounts of drug. Higher initial blood levels occur in severe hepatic dysfunction. 230 With aerosol administration, systemic absorption is low (<1% of deposited dose). Peak plasma levels range from 0.5 to 2.2 \u00b5g/mL after 8 hours' exposure and from 0.8 to 3.3 \u00b5g/mL after 20 hours in pediatric patients. Respiratory secretion levels often exceed 1000 \u00b5g/mL and persist with a t 1 2 of 1.4 to 2.5 hours. A special aerosol generator (SPAG 2, ICN Pharmaceuticals) is needed to produce particles of proper aero dynamic size to reach the lower respiratory tract.

Zanamivir resistance was not demonstrated among 3359 influenza A (H1N1) pdm09 global isolates 287 nor among 304 oseltamivirresistant isolates reported by the World Health Organization to August 2010. 288 Avian influenza A/H5N1 isolates from 2003 to 2005 were susceptible to zanamivir. 289 Of 680 influenza B viruses isolated in China from 2010 and 2011, one with D197N aminoacid substitution was resistant to zanamivir. 290 Several neuraminidase mutations mediate diminished susceptibil ity to zanamivir: Q136K in an A (H1N1) seasonal virus (300fold reduction in zanamivir susceptibility) 286 and S274N 291 in nonpandemic A/H1N1 virus and I223R (5fold reduction) 292 in an A (H1N1)pdm09 isolate. The relationship of these virus resistance mutations and prior zanamivir therapy and immune competence was not consistently apparent. An influenza B virus with an Arg152Lys mutation resistant to both zanamivir and oseltamivir was recovered from an immuno compromised child with prolonged virus excretion despite receipt of nebulized zanamivir. 293 The effect of these neuraminidase mutations on infectivity and transmissibility compared with the wildtype parental strains is variable, but only some mutants have been characterized in this regard. 293295 An observational study in pediatric patients with influenza treated with oseltamivir or zanamivir suggested that the lower prevalence of zanamivir than oseltamivir resistance is more related to the intrinsic properties of the drugs than to differences in the prevalence of use of the drugs. 296 for RSV infection \"is not recommended for routine use but may be considered for use in selected patients with documented, potentially lifethreatening RSV infection. \" 241 Decreased RSVspecific serum neu tralizing antibody titers and diminished nasopharyngeal secretion RSVspecific IgE and IgA responses may occur in ribavirintreated children. No longterm adverse or beneficial effects of ribavirin therapy have been documented in children. 242 Combinations of aerosolized ribavirin and intravenous immuno globulin or palivizumab may be beneficial in treating RSV pneumonia in hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients, 243246 whereas intrave nous ribavirin alone is ineffective. 247 Therapy with either aerosolized 248250 or oral 251,252 ribavirin appears to prevent progression from upper to lower respiratory tract illness in such patients. A similar benefit of preemptive treatment of RSV upper respiratory tract infection in lung transplant recipients with oral and inhaled ribavirin has been reported. 253, 254 ",

Its antiviral activity is expressed through interaction with the RSV improvement in peak expiratory flow rate than with inhaled placebo. 310 However, postmarketing reports indicate a potential risk for acute bronchospasm, respiratory arrest, or worsening of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease accompanied by pulmonary edema after zanamivir inhalation, particularly in patients with underlying airway disease. 311 Apparent declines in respiratory function have also been rarely reported in patients without recognized airway disease. Consequently, use in patients with underlying airway disease is not generally recom mended in the United States, although treatment in atrisk patients is used in other countries. 312 If used in patients with obstructive airway disease, zanamivir should be administered cautiously under close observation and with availability of fastacting bronchodilators.",

The approved for mulation is a dry powder containing a lactose carrier delivered by oral inhalation with a proprietary Diskhaler device. The proprietary inhaler device for delivering zanamivir is breath activated and requires a coop erative, trained patient. The use of the Diskhaler device is unreliable in young children, very infirm or elderly patients, or cognitively impaired patients. Although the inhaler has been used effectively in many older adults, 297 more than half of hospitalized older adults could not correctly use the device after instruction. 298 After inhalation of the dry powder using the Diskhaler, approxi mately 15% is deposited in the lower respiratory tract while the remainder is deposited in the oropharynx. 277 Zanamivir concentrations in epithelial lining fluid obtained by bronchoalveolar lavage may approximate concentrations in alveoli. Median epithelial lining fluid concentrations of zanamivir 12 hours after oral inhalation of the rec ommended 10mg dose by Diskhaler in healthy volunteers ranged from 0.3 to 0.9 \u00b5g/mL. 299 In other uninfected individuals, median zanamivir levels in induced sputum were 1.34 \u00b5g/mL, 0.30 \u00b5g/mL, and 0.05 \u00b5g/mL at 6 hours, 12 hours, and 24 hours after dosing, with the pulmonary t elim 1 2 estimated to be 2.8 hours. 300 Approximately 4% to 17% of an inhaled dose is absorbed systemically, and peak plasma levels are low, averaging 0.04 to 0.05 \u00b5g/mL. 277 Because of the low bioavailability of zanamivir inhaled orally, dosage adjustments are not indicated in renal insufficiency.",
