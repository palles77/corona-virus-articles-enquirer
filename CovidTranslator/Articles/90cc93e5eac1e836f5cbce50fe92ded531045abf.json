The method quantitatively measures the relative abundance of 2'-O-methyl and N 6 ,2'-O-dimethyladenosine, two of the most common modifications. In order to identify and quantitatify the amounts of N 6 ,2'-O-dimethyladenosine, a novel method for the synthesis of modified adenosine phosphoramidites was developed. This method is a one step synthesis and the product can directly be used for the production of N 6 ,2'-O-dimethyladenosine containing RNA oligonucleotides. The nature of the cap-adjacent nucleotides were shown to be characteristic for mRNAs from individual genes transcribed in liver and testis.",

            "text": "I n most eukaryotes, polymerase II (Pol II) dependent transcripts are modified co-transcriptionally at their 5'end by the addition of a 7-methyl guanosine (m 7 G) cap to the first nucleoside of the nascent transcript. If no additional modifications are made to the cap-adjacent nucleotides, the structure is referred to as a cap0. In yeast and plants, only cap0 structures are found, however, in animals, modifications of the two nucleotides adjacent to the m 7 G are possible The methylation of the first nucleotide on the ribose residue ( Fig. 1a) will form a cap1 structure 1 . Cap1 messages can be converted to cap2 structures if a further 2'ribose methylation takes place on the next nucleotide following the cap1 (Fig. 1b) . These methylation steps are sequential and carried out by nuclear located methylases [1] [2] [3] . In a transcript where the first nucleotide is an adenosine in a cap1 structure, a further methylation of the 2'-O-dimethyladenosine (Am) at the N 6 position of the adenine can take place to give N 6 ,2'-O-dimethyladenosine (m 6 Am) (Fig. 1c) 4 . The methyltransferase that carries out this modification has been partially characterized and appears to be predominantly located in the cytoplasm 5 . Transcription start sites of focused promoters are usually contained within an initiator motif (Inr) of general sequence YYANWYY (Y5pyrimidine, N-any nucleotide, W5A or T) where the A is the principal start site and neighbouring nucleotides may be used to varying degrees 6 . Since, A is often the first nucleotide after the m 7 G cap, its modification may have a functional role. In order to study the effect of m 6 Am present in cap1 messages, the chemical synthesis of RNA oligonucleotide sequences that contain m 6 Am in well-defined positions, is necessary. A number of methods exist in the literature for the preparation of N 6 -methylated adenosine derivatives, with the Dimroth rearrangement being perhaps the most well known [7] [8] [9] . This transformation relies upon an initial N1-methylation of the adenine ring followed by an alkali-mediated rearrangement to give the N6-methylated adenine product. An alternative method for accessing N6-alkylated adenines has been developed, which involves the nucleophilic aromatic substitution of adenine derivitives, that are activated at the 6-position, with amine nucleophiles (i.e. MeNH 2 ) [10] [11] [12] [13] . In order to obtain the N6-methylated phosphoramidite reagents from these adenine derivatives, a number of additional synthetic steps are required, which results in a 6 to 8 step synthesis being needed to produce each phosphoramidite reagent [10] [11] [12] [13] . Such approaches are not realistic other than in synthetic chemistry laboratories.",

After export from the nucleus, translation of most mRNAs is initiated with the recognition of the m 7 G cap by eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) 16 . This cap binding step is usually rate-limiting for translation. The m 7 G cap also protects the message from 5' to 3' exonuclease digestion. Compared to the well characterised role of m 7 G, relatively little is known regarding the function of 2' ribose methylation on the following nucleotides. The presence of a cap1 structure may promote binding to ribosomes 17 and can increase translational efficiency in vitro 18, 19 . Many animal viruses encode their own cap1 methylases 20, 21 and this may also help them to limit host immune responses 22, 23 . Whilst viral cap1 methylases are common viral cap2 methylases and m 6 Am methylases have not been reported. However, m 6 Am and cap2 structures can be found in viral mRNAs in vivo, presumably as a result of the action of the host cell's enzymes 24 . The functional consequences for an mRNA of possessing m 6 Am in a cap1 or a cap2 structure are not known.",

We have previously used TLC assays to detect and quantify N 6 -methyladenosine (m 6 A) 25 , a modification found internally in the mRNA of many eukaryotes [26] [27] [28] [29] . This method was modified to label and detect only the first nucleotide after the cap. In order to use this approach to compare the relative proportions of m 6 Am and Am in cap structures from different sources, it was first necessary to establish the mobility of m 6 Am in the TLC assay and to demonstrate that T4 polynucleotide kinase does not preferentially label either of these nucleotides. As neither m 6 Am triphosphate or m 6 Am phosphoramidite are commercially available, a novel method for its synthesis and incorporation into RNA oligonucleotides was developed.",

The spots corresponding to pm 6 Am and pAm were then quantified using phosphorimaging. The results demonstrated that both nucleotides are labelled with equal efficiency by T4 polynucleotide kinase (Fig. 3) Labelling and analysis of the first cap adjecent nucleotide. To label the first nucleotide following the m 7 G, poly(A) RNA was prepared from various mouse organs then digested with tobacco acid pyrophosphatase to remove the m 7 G cap. The exposed 5' ends were dephosphorylated with alkaline phosphatase and after phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation, the mRNA transcripts were radiolabelled at their 5' end using T4 polynucleotide kinase in the presence of .20 fold excess of [c-32 P] ATP. The labelled RNA was digested to monophospho-nucleotides by P1 nuclease prior to TLC separation. Using this method, new spots corresponding to the 2'-O methylated nucleotides are apparent in the labelled samples after cap removal (Fig 4A) . A spot corresponding to pm 6 Am is readily detectable in all mRNA samples tested, and with pm 6 Am:pAm ratios of between 15:1 (brain) and 2:1 (liver) it appears that m 6 Am is more prevalent at the cap1 than is Am (Fig. 4A ). Under these labelling conditions, where both ATP and polynucleotide kinase are in excess, the intensity of the spots corresponding to the unmodified Analysis of cap structures for mRNA transcripts from individual genes. In order to assay modifications on the first transcribed nucleotide for messages from individual genes, mRNA from liver and testis was de-capped and end-labelled as described above then fragmented to ,120 nt. This was then hybridised to single stranded DNA targets corresponding to the 5' region of selected messages. These DNA targets were first cross-linked to 2 mm 3 2 mm teeth cut from a Hybond N 1 membrane. After hybridization and washing, the membrane was subjected to phosphorimaging (Fig. 4B) . The individual teeth containing the labelled mRNA gene-specific fragments were then removed and digested to nucleotide 5' monophosphates using P1 nuclease. These samples were individually spotted onto TLC plates and developed as described (Fig. 4B ). Four mRNAs were chosen for analysis, apolipoprotein A-I (Apoa1, BC012253), albumin (Alb, BC024643), protamine 2 (Prm2, BC049612) and poly(A) binding protein cytoplasmic 1 (Pabpc1, BC046233). Alb and Apoa1 are predominantly liver expressed messages, whereas Prm2 shows testis specific expression and Pabpc1 is expressed highly in both organs. Pabpc1 may be subjected to translational regulation, but unlike Pabpc2, it is present in actively translating polyribosomes of mouse testicular cells 31 . For both Alb and Apoa1, the labelled nucleotide in the cap adjacent position included A, G, U and C, as well as m 6 Am and Am. This is consistent with multiple alternative transcription start sites at and around the Inr 32 . In both cases, Am and m 6 Am appeared as the major nucleotide modifications; unlike the mixed mRNA starting material, 2'-O-methylcytosine was not present (compare Fig. 4A, B) . The m 6 Am:Am ratios were 1.65:1 and 1.4:1 for Apoa1 and Alb respectively, which is only slightly lower compared to that seen for the liver mRNA population as a whole. The Prm2 mRNAs from testis tissues almost exclusively had m 6 Am at the cap adjacent position (Fig. 4B) . With an m 6 Am:Am ratio of 40:1, this was four times larger than the m 6 Am:Am ratio for the testis mRNA population as a whole. In contrast the cap adjacent nucleotides of Pabpc1 transcripts were predominantly unmodified, although a pronounced 2'-O-methyluridine was apparent in the sample from testis (Fig. 4B ).",

In case of focused promoters the transcription start sites are contained within and around the Inr (YYANWYY), where the A is the principal start site and surrounding nucleotides are utilised to varying degrees 6 . Recent high-throughput sequencing from full length mRNAs, suggests that purine instead of A may be a better representation of the Inr consensus. However, most core promoters have several closely arrayed transcription start sites with different initiation rates rather than initiating at a single nucleotide 32 . Thus, most genes will give rise to a population of mRNAs that differ in their starting nucleotides. For example the Prm2 message initiates predominantly at the central A of the Inr as well as a second A 3 nucleotides upstream, whereas, Apoa1 strongly initiates at the A of the Inr but also uses surrounding U, G, C and sites at a significant level (Supplementary Figure S2 online) and (Fig. 4B) .",

Some crystallographic observations suggest that the first nucleotide after the m7G may influence interaction with eIF4E or other cap binding proteins. Crystallographic analysis of eIF4E in a complex with the dinucleotide m 7 GpppG, show the G in a disordered arrangement 34 . However, with m 7 GpppA as substrate, the A interacts with a C-terminal loop of the protein 35 . A key interaction of this C-loop is a hydrogen bond between Thr 205 and the amino group in the N 6 position of the adenosine. It is this amino group that is targeted for methylation by the m 6 Am methylase. Thus, N 6 methylation of a cap1 adenosine might influence the flexibility and orientation of the eIF4E C-terminal loop region. The ability to synthesize RNA oligonucleotides that containe m 6 Am in welldefined positions should facilitate future structure-function analysis. Therefore a direct synthetic method for the preparation of the desired m 6 Am phosphoramidite reagent, in a single step from commercially available starting material via direct N 6 -methylation, dramatically improves access to these materials for biological evaluation.",

Membrane washings were carried out with 2 3, 1 3 and 0.2 3 SSC, 0.1% SDS. Two final washes were carried out at 60 uC, with 0.2 3 SSC but with the SDS omitted. Hybridised membranes were exposed to storage phosphor screens (K-screen; KODAK) and imaged using Bio-Rad Molecular Imager FX in combination with Quantity One 4.6.3 software (Bio-Rad). Individual teeth containing the target mRNAs end labelled at the cap adjacent position were cut off and digested with P1 nuclease (Sigma) in a final volume of 3 ml. All of this digestion mix was applied to a cellulose coated TLC plate (20 3 20 cm, MERCK) and developed as described previously 25 .",

Formation of the cap1 structure takes place by 2'-O -methylation on the ribose residue on the first nucleotide adjacent to the m 7 G cap. The example shows a structure with adenosine as the first nucleotide, adjacent to the m7G cap (a). The cap1 structure can then be converted to a cap2 by a further 2'-Oribose methylation on the following nucleotide (b), or converted to a cap1 m6Am by placing a further methyl group on the adenosine in the N 6 position (c). The figure is a schematic representation of the mRNA cap structures. The yellow structure represents 7-methyl-guanine, the green represents adenine and the grey pentagon is ribose. On the ribose only the methylated functional groups are shown.www.nature.com/scientificreports SCIENTIFIC REPORTS | 1 : 126 | DOI: 10.1038/srep00126nucleotides, as well as the other 2' methylated nucleotides, is indicative of their actual relative abundance in the de-capped mRNA sample (Supplementary Figure S1 online).",
