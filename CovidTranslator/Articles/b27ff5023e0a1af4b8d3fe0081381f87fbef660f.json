This study investigated the trends in antimicrobial resistance in S. marcescens from a nationwide surveillance in Taiwan. Materials and methods: S. marcescens isolates were collected biennially between 2002 and 2010 from medical centers and regional hospitals throughout Taiwan, as part of the Taiwan Surveillance of Antimicrobial Resistance program. Minimal inhibitory concentrations were determined by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute reference broth microdilution method. Results: A total of 403 nonduplicate S. marcescens isolates were collected, mostly from respiratory samples (157, 39.0%), followed by the urinary tract samples (90, 22.3%). Overall, 99.3% isolates were susceptible to imipenem, 93.8% to ceftazidime, 89.2% to minocycline, 87.8% to amikacin, 86.8% to cefepime, 82.9% to aztreonam, 73.2% to ceftriaxone, 72.7% to levofloxacin, 63.8% to ciprofloxacin, 60.8% to trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX), and 59.6% to gentamicin. A significantly increased susceptibility rate after 2004 was observed for the following antibiotics: amikacin (73.8% vs. 97.1%), gentamicin (40.0% vs. 72.4%), ciprofloxacin Journal of Microbiology, Immunology and Infection (2014) 47, 387e393 (53.8% vs. 70.4%), ceftriaxone (53.8% vs. 86.0%), cefepime (74.4% vs. 95.1%), aztreonam (72.5% vs. 89.7%), and TMP/SMX (41.3% vs. 73.7%). Conclusion: In this 8-year study, the susceptibility of S. marcescens to ceftazidime and imipenem remained consistently high in Taiwan. S. marcescens isolates demonstrated relatively higher resistance to ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin, and therefore continued surveillance of antimicrobial resistance, especially for fluoroquinolone, is warranted.",

            "text": "Serratia species are identified as aerobic, motile Gramnegative rods, which occupy various habitats (mainly water, plants, and soil). Human infections by members of the genus Serratia were not well recognized until the latter half of the 20 th century. 1 Serratia marcescens accounts for the majority of isolates and appears to be a pathogen capable of causing a wide spectrum of clinical diseases, including wound infections, urinary tract infections, pneumonia, central nervous system infections such as meningitis, and bloodstream infections. 1e6 Although S. marcescens is a rare cause of communityacquired infections, it has emerged as an important nosocomial pathogen that has been cultured from a variety of sources, including disinfectants, 7e9 pressure transducers, 10 bronchoscopes, 11 and multidose medication vials. 12 Factors such as debilitating clinical condition, lengthy ward stay, exposure to medical interventions, and increased frequency and intensity of direct contact with staff hands predispose patients to S. marcescens infection. S. marcescens isolates account for 12.6% of nosocomial urinary tract infection and resulted in 4.86% fatality in a single institute in Taiwan. 13 Although S. marcescens has a relatively low virulence, it often causes nosocomial infections in severely immunocompromised or critically ill patients. 1, 2 The mortality rate of S. marcescens bacteremia was approximately 40e50% in previous studies. 14, 15 S. marcescens is usually resistant to ampicillin, amoxicillin, amoxicillin/clavulanate, ampicillin/sulbactam, narrow-spectrum cephalosporins, cefuroxime, cephamycins, nitrofurantoin, and colistin. 1,16e18 S. marcescens also harbors a chromosomal ampC gene that can extend resistance to several more b-lactam antibiotics. 1 In a nationwide surveillance of antimicrobial resistance from Taiwan in 2000, over half (52%) of S. marcescens were resistant to ciprofloxacin, 48%, 24%, and 23% were resistant to cefotaxime, aztreonam, and cefepime, respectively. 19 However, many studies in recent years suggested that the occurrence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)producing isolates of S. marcescens was not unusual in Taiwan. 17,18,20e22 In addition, an institutional prolonged spread of clonally related S. marcescens isolates with a novel AmpC cephalosporinase (S4) that confers a phenotype of resistance to cefotaxime was identified. 23 Therefore, continuous and extensive surveillance of the antimicrobial resistance among S. marcescens isolates is necessary in Taiwan. The aim of this study was to investigate the trends in antimicrobial resistance in S. marcescens from a nationwide surveillance in Taiwan.",

Susceptibilities of 10% for each round of TSAR were observed for ampicillin, amoxicillin/clavulanate, cefazolin, cefoxitin, cefuroxime, and tetracycline.

The antibiogram-based method to simplify the screening of potential ESBL-producing populations among S. marcescens isolates has also been reported recently. 22 Although the molecular characteristics of isolates were lacking in the current study, the higher susceptibility of ceftazidime than ceftriaxone corresponded to the previous studies, 17,18,20e23 and further underlined the need to establish practical guidelines for ESBL screening, confirmation, and reporting for chromosomal AmpC producers in Taiwan. 21 In the Tigecycline Evaluation and Surveillance Trial study, 4857 isolates of S. marcescens collected globally between 2004 and 2007 with susceptibilities ! 90% were observed for amikacin, levofloxacin, ceftazidime, cefepime, imipenem, meropenem, piperacillin/tazobactam, and tigecycline. 27 A similar study conducted by Hawser et al collected 753 clinical isolates of S. marcescens throughout the AsiaePacific region between 2004 and 2010 and demonstrated constantly high susceptibility to levofloxacin (84e97%). 28 A characteristic finding in the present study was the much lower susceptibility to levofloxacin and ceftriaxone compared with the global data. Susceptibility to levofloxacin in the current study was only tested between 2008 and 2010, but susceptibility to ciprofloxacin was tested throughout the study period. The much lower susceptibility to ciprofloxacin suggests that resistance to fluoroquinolones is the major concern surrounding drugresistant S. marcescens in Taiwan. The susceptibility rate to ceftriaxone was 55e85% between 2004 and 2010 in the AsiaePacific region, which is consistent with our findings. Hawser et al also demonstrated a decline in susceptibility to minocycline (decreased to 41e60% in 2008e2010) and tigecycline in S. marcescens. 28 By contrast, susceptibility to minocycline and tigecycline tested in 2010 in the present study showed higher susceptibility rates of 89.2% and 98.8%, respectively.",

The higher proportion of isolates recovered from urine between 2002 and 2004 may have influenced the results. The significantly higher proportion of isolates recovered from urine between 2002 and 2004 (32.5%) than that after 2004 (15.6%, p < 0.001) may have influenced the results. The reasons why isolates from urine had the lowest susceptibility rate for the various antibiotics cannot be clearly defined. It might imply that we should put more focus on the resistance pattern in the urinary isolates. In addition, after the emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome in 2003, the reinforcement of prevention of health care-associated infection in hospitals resulted in a more cautious approach to intervention with antimicrobials as a part of the infection control policy. 30 The trends in total consumption of aminoglycosides, extended-spectrum cephalosporins, and fluoroquinolones significantly increased prior to 2004 and remained stable after 2004 in the hospital-wide investigation. 30, 31 The reduced consumption of antibiotics in Taiwan may explain the observation of greater susceptibility after 2004 in the present study. We recognize a number of potential biases in the present study. The first limitation concerns the specimen types. Isolates from the urinary tract showed higher resistance rates to many antibiotics than those from other sites; therefore, the higher percentage of urine specimen prior to 2004 may result in lower overall susceptibility in this period. Second, <10% of isolates were collected from eastern Taiwan and the data are likely to have underestimated the events occurring in this region. Third, we did not analyze the resistant mechanism due to the lack of molecular method such as multiplex polymerase chain reaction screening of ampC genes in these S. marcescens isolates. Finally, given the limited clinical information from this surveillance, we cannot exactly determine the clinical significance of these isolates.",
