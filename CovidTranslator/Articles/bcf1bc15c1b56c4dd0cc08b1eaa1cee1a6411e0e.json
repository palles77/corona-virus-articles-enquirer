Therefore, CD4 + T cells cannot be effectively activated in this model. CD4 + T cell activation is vital for the efficient priming of CD8 + T cells, B lymphocytes and long-term immune memory. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] A weak point in the current theory is that DNA vaccines, when encoding a cytoplasmic protein, usually fail to elicit a sufficient, if any, CD4 + T response, whereas MHC I-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) responses are usually preferable. This preference usually leads to the inability of the host immune system to mount greater immune responses and to maintain long-term memory.",

            "text": "The lysosome is one of the most important components of the multilaminar vesicular compartment (MHC class II-processing compartment) in the exogenous antigen-processing pathway. [7] [8] [9] Lysosome-associated membrane protein (LAMP) can target and bind the endosome/lysosome through the LAMP transmembrane/cytoplasmic domain. The luminal domain of LAMP is then integrated into the lysosome. [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] Consequently, one strategy commonly adopted by our group [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] is to insert the target DNA into LAMP as a LAMP/ antigen chimera. In addition, many other laboratories have reported that LAMP targeting could greatly enhance the immune response against a number of antigens. [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] It has been postulated that DNA plasmids encoding endogenous antigen could take advantage of LAMP and be carried directly into MHC class IIprocessing compartment, where the fusion protein of interest could be digested and presented by MHC II molecules. This strategy could thus boost the CD4 + T-lymphocyte response and, in turn, enhance the immune responses mentioned above.",

In contrast, exogenous antigens are degraded in the lysosome of antigen-presenting cells and induce antibody-mediated humoral immune responses and CD4 + T-cell activation and secretion of cytokines to facilitate CTL activation and differentiation. Therefore, the achievement of a desired response by controlling the delivery pathways is indispensable in vaccine development and immunotherapy. 39 In addition, the effective activation of CD4 + T cells is critical for generating adaptive immune responses. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] The studies discussed above used a recently developed approach that provides an additional necessary protein element required for antigen trafficking to vesicular lysosomal sites where MHC II antigen presentation takes place. As shown in the results, the DNA vaccine of SARS CoV-N alone definitely elicited the host immune response, and this was most evident for B cells. However, stronger T-cell responses were observed when LAMP fusion DNA vaccines were applied. 18 This is consistent with previous Increasing responses to epitopes by N immunization with LAMP chimera K Yang et al studies in which HIV Gag-LAMP elicited superior antibody and CD4 + and CD8 + cellular responses. 18 This increase in the CD8 + T-cell response could be attributed to the increased response of CD4 + T cells. This study, together with previous studies, provides indirect evidence that the trafficking of DNA-encoded antigens to the LAMP endosomal/lysosomal vesicular compartments is an important factor affecting the function of genetic vaccines. Whatever the mechanism may be, the effect is evident. In addition to stronger T-cell responses (Figure 3) , stronger long-term memory T-cell responses ( Figure 4) were also observed, even with the p-LAMP/ N 70\u00c0122 construct, whereas almost no response was detected to the p-N construct. These results reveal the special advantage of LAMP fusion DNA vaccines, which have a much longer effect than conventional DNA vaccines.",

            "text": "Another finding of this study confirmed our initial prediction that the T-cell dominant epitope cluster of SARS CoV-N resides mainly in the N-terminal 76-114 amino acids of this protein ( Figure 5 ). It is interesting that even though this dominant epitope cluster resides in this area, the DNA SARS CoV-N 70\u00c0122 vaccine alone failed to elicit immune responses in either B cells or T cells. However, when the fragment was fused to LAMP, dramatic immune responses were observed. The extent of the T-cell response was comparable to that observed with p-LAMP/N, and was stronger than that detected with p-N. Weaker B cell responses were also evident ( Figure 2 ). There are some possible explanations for this result. The major B cell epitope cluster may not be located within the N terminus of SARS CoV-N. This hypothesis is supported by the fact that the p-LAMP/N construct elicited a B-cell response equivalent to the p-N construct and to the findings reported by Zhao et al. 40 Taken together, this study not only showed that the use of LAMP as a chimera can elicit both humoral and cellular immune responses, even with an epitope-based cluster DNA vaccine, but it also emphasized the significance of targeting DNA-encoded vaccine antigens to the MHC II-processing compartments for induction of long-term immunological memory. These findings are of great value in understanding anti-SARS-CoV immunity and also in designing epitope-based DNA vaccines against the disease.",
