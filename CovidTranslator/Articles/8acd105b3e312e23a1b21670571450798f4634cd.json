            "text": "Objectives Considering recent shifts in global funding landscapes, this study analyzes Canada's long-term global health research funding trends in the hope of informing a new Canadian global health research strategy. Examining past investments can help prioritize limited future resources to either build on Canada's existing strengths or fill gaps where needed, while simultaneously informing the investments of research funders in other countries. Methods Administrative data were analyzed covering all 1584 global health research grants awarded by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR) to 927 unique principal investigators from 2000 to 2016, totalling C$341 million. Existing metadata associated with each grant was supplemented by additional qualitative coding. Descriptive time-series analyses of global health research grant data were conducted using various measures related to each grant's recipient (e.g., province, university, sex, distribution) and subject matter (e.g., research theme, area, focus). Results CIHR's total annual global health research funding increased sharply from $3.6 million in FY2000/2001 to $30.3 million in FY2015/2016, with the largest share of research funding now focused on health equity-representing nearly 50% of CIHR's global health research funding. Past grants have concentrated on infectious disease and public health research. One third of CIHR's global health grant funding went to 20 principal investigators. Only 42.2% of global health research funding came from CIHR's open investigator-driven competitions, with the rest coming from strategic priority-driven competitions. Conclusion Global health research has seen steady increases in funding from CIHR's open competitions when preceded by investment in strategic competitions, which suggests the level of a national research funding agency's strategic investments in global health research may determine the size of the field in their country. The greatest concentration of past investment lies in health equity research, followed by infectious disease research. Future analyses of research funding would benefit from an internationally accepted keyword classification scheme and more granular administrative data.",

L'examen des investissements pass\u00e9s peut contribuer \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer s'il faut consacrer les ressources futures limit\u00e9es \u00e0 miser sur les forces existantes du Canada ou \u00e0 combler les lacunes si n\u00e9cessaire, tout en jetant un \u00e9clairage sur les investissements dans la recherche des bailleurs de fonds d'autres pays. M\u00e9thode Nous avons analys\u00e9 les donn\u00e9es administratives des 1 584 subventions de recherche en sant\u00e9 mondiale, d'une valeur totale de 341 M$ CA, octroy\u00e9es par les Instituts de recherche en sant\u00e9 du Canada (IRSC) \u00e0 927 chercheurs en chef individuels entre 2000 et 2016. Les m\u00e9tadonn\u00e9es existantes associ\u00e9es \u00e0 chaque subvention ont \u00e9t\u00e9 compl\u00e9t\u00e9es par un codage qualitatif.

R\u00e9sultats Le financement annuel total de la recherche en sant\u00e9 mondiale par les IRSC a connu une forte augmentation, passant de 3,6 M$ en 2000-2001 \u00e0 30,3 M$ en 2015-2016, la plus grande proportion du financement de la recherche \u00e9tant maintenant consacr\u00e9e \u00e0 l'\u00e9quit\u00e9 en sant\u00e9qui repr\u00e9sente pr\u00e8s de 50 % du financement de la recherche en sant\u00e9 mondiale des IRSC. Les subventions pass\u00e9es se concentraient sur la recherche sur les maladies infectieuses et la recherche en sant\u00e9 publique. Le tiers du financement des subventions de recherche en sant\u00e9 mondiale des IRSC est all\u00e9 \u00e0 20 chercheurs en chef. Seulement 42,2 % du financement de la recherche en sant\u00e9 mondiale est venu des concours de subventions ouverts des IRSC, et le reste, des concours strat\u00e9giques prioris\u00e9s. Conclusion Le financement de la recherche en sant\u00e9 mondiale venant des concours ouverts des IRSC augmente de fa\u00e7on soutenue quand il est pr\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9 par des investissements dans les concours strat\u00e9giques, ce qui est signe que le niveau d'investissements strat\u00e9giques dans la recherche en sant\u00e9 mondiale d'un organisme national de financement de la recherche peut d\u00e9terminer l'ampleur du champ dans son pays. La plus forte concentration d'investissements pass\u00e9s est all\u00e9e \u00e0 la recherche sur l'\u00e9quit\u00e9 en sant\u00e9, suivie par la recherche sur les maladies infectieuses.

            "text": "Budget constraints and shifting political priorities have long posed challenges for global health research funding. Global health research is defined as not only supporting health research in low-and middle-income countries (LMICs), but also focusing on \"health, health-system, health inequities, and health policy challenges facing populations living in conditions of vulnerability\" in both LMICs and high-income countries (HICs) (Global health research 2017). In the wake of Brexit and the 2016 United States (US) election, a new uncertainty has set in about whether the United Kingdom (UK) and the US will maintain their historic levels of support for global health research initiatives (Greenwood 2018) . Global development assistance for health has grown by only 1.2% annually since 2010, a sharp drop from the 11.3% annual increases seen throughout the 2000s, and continued limitations on growth are expected (Dieleman et al. 2016) . Globally, public funding of global health research has declined since the global financial crisis of 2008 (Chapman et al. 2016) ; existing analyses show that only a small percentage of global health research funds are allocated towards epidemiology and health policy and systems research, which is context-specific research that is especially important for LMICs (Abimbola et al. 2017) . Many observers worry about continued reductions in research funding opportunities for global health, as populist pressures may encourage countries to shift resources towards domestic priorities (Morrison 2012) . This global shortfall runs counter to the \"convergence plan\" of The Lancet's Global Health 2035 Commission, which calls for doubling research funding for diseases that disproportionately affect LMICs from US$3 billion to US$6 billion per year so that health status in LMICs can catch up to HICs within a generation (Ramesh 2013) . In light of these challenges, other countries, even if smaller in influence and capacity, will increasingly be shaping global health research priorities alongside existing major funders.",

This study presents such an analysis focused on CIHR, which is unique among Canada's three primary global health research funders because it supports all kinds of health research and is by far the largest source of funding for such research conducted by researchers based at Canadian academic institutions. (GCC's annual investment in global health research is larger when combining its domestic and foreign funding activities (Plamondon et al. 2017) .) Specifically, we aimed to gain a more comprehensive understanding of what kinds of global health research have been funded in Canada by examining a novel administrative dataset of global health research funding made available by CIHR. We identified, analyzed, and segmented long-term funding trends by various measures related to each grant's recipient (e.g., province, university, sex, distribution) and subject matter (e.g., research theme, area, focus). To date, there has been only limited formal analysis of global health research funding in Canada, even though it provides valuable insight into global health research agenda setting. Spanning 15 years and representing C$341 million invested, these data let us identify shifts, specializations, and gaps in research focus; distributional patterns across researchers; and potential areas where CIHR and other global health research funders internationally may wish to invest either to build on existing strengths or fill essential gaps.",

Funding by province consists of 10 provinces, including an unspecified category for when the province was not specified. Funding by program type refers to grants versus awards, an important technical distinction; grants generally cover a broader range of research costs including direct research costs, training of researchers, and knowledge translation activities, whereas awards include direct salary support to individual research personnel and stipends for individual research trainees. CIHR funding is also designated as either \"open\" or \"strategic\". Open funding refers to investigator-driven projects proposed by researchers without any direction on funding priorities. Strategic funding refers to priority-driven initiatives created by CIHR on particular topics that are deemed to be of strategic importance to Canada.",

As a middle power, one potentially effective strategy to maximize impact considering these constraints would be to prioritize funding based on the country's existing strengths in global health research and the unique contributions it can make to existing national or global priorities based on comparative advantages (Cartier et al. 2018 ). The marked increase in global health research funding from CIHR signals growing interest and strength among Canadian researchers in this area. CIHR funding over the course of the past 15 years has been concentrated in the Institute research areas of infection and immunity and population and public health. Nearly half of CIHR's global health research funding during this period focused on health equity. Health equity was also one of the fastest growing focus areas, suggesting this might be an existing strength and comparative advantage upon which Canada can further build specialized leadership. Data on distribution of funds among applications and PIs paints a mixed picture of the degree to which funding is concentrated among top researchers or driven by many smaller applications. While the distribution of research funding shows 917 smaller awards (60.0%) less than C$200,000 each, 20 researchers (2.2%) account for one third of CIHR's global health research funding.",

The share of biomedical funding has dipped in both absolute and relative terms in recent years, although it still represents more than one third of total funding overall. Conversely, the share of funding for population health research has increased steadily and eclipsed biomedical funding by increasingly greater margins starting in FY2012/2013. By FY2015/2016, annual population health research funding was nearly double that of biomedical research funding. The rapid increase of population health research over the last decade coincides with increased recognition for the broader social determinants of health in global health.",

IPPH is also CIHR's largest financier of strategic priority-driven global health research initiatives and has overseen large collaborative investments, including the GACD and IMCHA programs with IDRC (Health equity matters 2015). While most aspects of health research are relevant to global health, some lend more easily to an explicit focus on global health than others. For example, the scope of infection and immunity and population and public health are often transnational, equity-focused, and targeted to reach populations facing conditions of marginalization both in LMICs and across multiple international settings. CIHR-funded research for Indigenous Peoples' health has mostly been domestic in focus, with the relevant Institute's mandate being to \"improve and promote the health of First Nations, Inuit and M\u00e9tis peoples in Canada\", whereas IPPH and CIHR's Institute of Infection and Immunity have defined mandates that are global in scope (see Table 1 ).",

Most highly funded researchers received both larger and smaller grants. This concentration of funds may alternatively reflect a deliberate strategy to prioritize excellence in research as opposed to a wider distribution of funds across more PIs. That said, CIHR funded 927 unique PIs from 1584 grants, which means almost two thirds of global health research grants have been awarded to PIs who only hold one global health research grant. A network analysis would reveal the extent to which CIHR's top-funded PIs collaborate with other established researchers or with earlier career researchersthereby further distributing access to global health research funds across the country.",

It is the first known analysis of the global health research portion of CIHR's research investments. This analysis provided both a precise estimate of CIHR's annual funding for global health research and a fine-grained segmented analysis of the shifts within funding categories over 15 fiscal years. Second, the data were independently validated twice: first by staff at CIHR's IPPH and International Relations Team and second by our research team to minimize false positives. Third, steps were taken to increase the comparability of grants between years by adjusting for inflation and standardizing grant values to 2015 Canadian dollars. Fourth, this analysis is particularly informative for CIHR's global health research strategywhich is especially important as CIHR is Canada's largest health research funder broadly and for Canada-based global health researchers specifically. Our analysis of the CIHR dataset thus serves as a starting point for further investigation and provides a necessary benchmark against which future analyses can be compared.",

            "text": "There are three main limitations of this study. First, there is no standardized keyword classification scheme at CIHR. A search yielded more than 4700 unique keywords from the global health research dataset alone. This made further analysis on topics that would require information from the keyword metadata extremely labour-intensive due to risks of doublecounting. For example, when analyzing the infectious disease research funding data, HIV/AIDS research was found to be coded under multiple variations: \"HIV\", \"AIDS\", \"human immunodeficiency virus\", including their French-language e q u i v a l e n t s o f \" V I H \" , \" S I D A \" , and \" v i r u s d e l'immunod\u00e9ficience humaine\". Grants could also support projects involving more than one infectious disease; accordingly, double-counting could not be avoided (whereas all other analyses in this study were conducted using mutually exclusive categories to avoid any double-counting). The infectious diseases analysis therefore should be viewed as a preliminary analysis of trends rather than accurate magnitude. Future analyses would benefit from a standardized keyword classification scheme currently being considered by CIHR for its database. Second, the CIHR grants dataset had some missing information in two categories-institute research area and research theme-as they were both self-declared by grant applicants with options to be omitted. Data quality would be improved for these categories if CIHR required responses to them. Third, there was no feasible way to check CIHR's funding database for false negatives, meaning there could theoretically be additional global health research grants within CIHR's funding portfolio if CIHR's IPPH or Strategic Partnerships and International Relations Team accidentally made mistakes when classifying grants as global health research.",
