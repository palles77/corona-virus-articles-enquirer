            "text": "The recent surge of interest in bats as a reservoir of viruses was driven by two factors. First, in less than 20 years, several high profile viral pathogens have been proven or hypothesized to have a bat origin. Since Hendra virus was first discovered in 1994, there have been at least 17 known spillover events in Australia with a mortality rate in humans of approximately 60% [10] . The closely related Nipah virus has been responsible for devastating disease outbreaks in Malaysia, Bangladesh and India with mortality rates ranging from 40% to 90%, resulting in the deaths of approximately 200 humans [11] . Filoviruses (Ebola and Marburg viruses) have caused outbreaks in Africa with associated human mortality rates as high as 90%, and have been linked to mass gorilla die-offs, making them both a public health and conservation concern [12] [13] [14] . The outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2002-2003, due to a previously unknown coronavirus, resulted in more than 8000 human infections with a mortality rate close to 10% and an estimated cost of $50 billion in lost tourism and trade [15] [16] [17] . The association of these high profile pathogens and disease outbreaks with bats has led to an increase in public interest, funding and research activities on these and many other bat-borne viruses. However, it should be emphasized that, although closely related SARS-like coronaviruses have been detected in horseshoe bats, the exact natural reservoir of the coronavirus responsible for the SARS outbreaks is still unknown [8, 9] . The true natural reservoir of Ebola virus is also still being debated as rodents, insectivores and bats have all been identified as potential sources of infection in primates [18 ,19] .",

            "text": "The second driver for the recent surge in bat virus research has been advances in modern molecular techniques which have presented opportunities for discovery of novel bat viruses, that were considered impossible or nonpractical just a decade ago. Using pan-virus-specific primers and next-generation sequencing, it is now possible to detect and characterize novel viral sequences without the need for virus isolation by cell culture or the identification of virions by electron microscopy. Numerous publications in the past few years have reinforced the observation, first made by Sulkin and Allen in 1974 [20], that bats carry a wide range of novel RNA and DNA viruses. These results also provide support to the notion, as first observed during the investigations of bat coronaviruses (see below), that bats within a geographic location and/or taxonomic group have an unusual ability to harbor a large number of genetically diverse viruses. More recently, two metagenomic studies on bat fecal samples have revealed a great number of novel bat viruses, some of which have moderate sequence identity to previously known mammalian viruses, including members of the Parvoviridae, Circoviridae, Picornaviridae, Adenoviridae, Poxviridae, Astroviridae, Herpesviridae and Coronaviridae [21 ,22 ] . Further systematic surveillance will be required to determine whether bats are the natural hosts of these novel viruses, but these results clearly indicate that there are many bat viruses yet to be identified. Interestingly, similar to other metagenomic analyses of human or other animal fecal samples, these studies have also identified numerous sequences derived from viruses infecting insects, plants and bacteria. Although these viruses are unlikely to infect bats, one might hypothesize that they could play an important role in facilitating the dispersal of these viruses to different geographical locations and different hosts.",

While the currently available data are too limited to provide a conclusive answer, this review aims to examine different hypotheses which may eventually allow us to resolve this intriguing and fundamentally important question.

            "text": "Bats have several features that might help to explain the seemingly high rate of virus detection. Bats constitute the second largest order of mammals. There are about 1240 bat species worldwide, which represents more than 20% of all mammalian species [24] . Bats are classified in the order Chiroptera in which there are two suborders: the Yinpterochiroptera (also known as Megachiroptera), which contains the megabats, and the Yangochiroptera (Microchiroptera), which includes the majority of microbat families [25] . The wide range of bat species could provide a large 'breeding ground' for viruses. The earliest known bat fossil dates to 52.5 million years ago (Mya) [26, 27] . Extrapolation of fossil records and genetic data has suggested that the basal split from other placental mammals in the superorder Laurasiatheria occurred during the late Cretaceous period approximately 80-90 Mya, with extensive diversification of extant bat families commencing approximately 62 Mya [28] [29] [30] . Bat viruses may therefore have co-evolved with or adapted to bats over many millions of years. Besides, bats are the only mammalian species that can fly and some bat species can migrate hundreds of miles to their overwintering or hibernation sites [1 ]. Thus, bats have more opportunities than terrestrial mammals to have direct or indirect contact with other animal species at different geographical locations, thereby enhancing the opportunity for interspecies virus transmission. In addition, some insectivorous bats exhibit exceptionally long life-spans of 25-35 years and live in panmictic populations comprising of millions of individuals. The long life-span of bats may facilitate the transmission of chronic persistent infections, whereas the unusually large and complex structure of bat populations may ensure a sufficient number of immunologically naive juveniles for bat viruses to persist in bat colonies. Some bat species also have a capacity for hibernation over winter or to enter into daily torpor to conserve energy. The reduced body temperature and metabolic rate may suppress robust immune responses and reduce the rate of virus replication, thereby delaying virus clearance from bat populations [20,31 ].",

            "text": "It could be argued that, as bats represent the second largest group of mammals (comprising 20% of all mammalian species), it is not entirely surprising that there are many bat viruses. However, some of our recent indirect evidence suggests that bats may be atypical hosts of at least some viruses. Firstly, the genetic diversity and prevalence of infection of some RNA viruses in bats is unusually high. We previously reported the detection of genetically highly diverse astroviruses and coronaviruses in bat fecal samples, with the prevalence of infection of these novel bat viruses in the range of 10-50% [32, 33] . However, similar surveillance studies for astrovirus and coronavirus in rodents sampled at the same geographic location indicated that none of the samples (N = 441) were positive for coronavirus, whereas only 1.6% of the tested Brown rat (Rattus norvegicus) samples (N = 371) were positive for astroviruses [34 ] . At least at this location, bats appear to harbor many more coronaviruses and astroviruses than rodents. Secondly, phylogenetic analysis of viral sequences has revealed that a large number of coronaviruses recognized in other mammalian species share a common ancestor with various other bat coronaviruses ( Figure 1 ). These findings suggest that bats are likely to be the natural reservoir from which all presently known mammalian coronavirus lineages have evolved [35] . The high prevalence of viral infection in bats, together with some of the unusual characteristics of bats discussed above, may have facilitated the transmission of bat viruses to other mammals.",

For example, more than 45 hantaviruses have been identified in rodents -the largest group of mammals on earth (40% of all mammalian species) -and each hantavirus appears to have co-evolved with a specific rodent [36, 37] . Rodents are also considered to be the natural reservoir of arenaviruses with which they appear to have co-evolved [38] and waterfowls are known to be the natural reservoir of influenza viruses [39] . It is possible that bats, rodents, birds and other wildlife may be ancient reservoirs of different sets of virus taxa. Further systematic surveillance for viruses in different wildlife populations using metagenomics or other molecular approaches is required to determine if the large number of viruses identified in bats is just simply numbers game. Nevertheless, the prevalence of infection of certain bat virus families appears to be much higher than has been reported for the viral families co-evolved with rodent and avian species, suggesting that bats may have some intrinsic properties which make them more suited as a reservoir host.",

The most recent mass extinction, the K-T extinction, occurred 65 million years ago. It followed the Earth impact of the large bolide that created the 180-300-km-wide Chicxulub crater in northern Yucatan, Mexico [41, 42] and resulted in 70-80% reduction in marine diversity at the species level, 50% at the genus level, and the loss of 70% of all species worldwide [43, 44] . The K-T extinction will also have impacted on viral diversity. Indeed, as the survival of virus populations is inextricably linked to the survival of their host species, the rate of virus extinction during precipitous mass extinctions is likely to have been far greater than that of their hosts. Virus extinction will have occurred not only as a consequence of host extinction but also through decreases in host population size and host isolation to a level that could not sustain ongoing virus transmission (Table 1) . Even temporary host species decline or isolation, followed by recovery and survival, will have had potential for virus extinction. Survival will have favored those viruses that could persist either in the environment or in the host, those that caused no disease or mortalities, those that were transmitted vertically, those with a broad host range, and those for which the host survived with little impact on population size. Surviving host species that were largely unaffected by such a devastating mass extinction event are likely therefore to have been important sources of extant viral biodiversity.",

It has been argued that the short intense heat pulse caused by the ballistic atmospheric re-entry of ejecta following the bolide impact created a catastrophe that set the stage for later evolutionary events [47] . Indeed, ancestral bats, rodents, insectivores and some birds are likely to have had the characteristics of animals Mass extinctions, biodiversity and mitochondrial function: Wang, Walker and Poon 651 Table 1 Effects of the K-T bolide impact on host populations and likely consequences on the contemporary virosphere. characteristics required for survival of the nuclear winter and food chain collapse that is predicted to have followed the initial impact [51] . Bats are now second only to rodents as the most ecologically and morphologically diverse mammalian clades, adapting to almost every terrestrial environment and accounting for over 20% of extant mammalian diversity [24] .

Although there may not be a direct link between host diversity and virus diversity, the long evolutionary history and the ecological diversity of bats will also have presented a myriad of opportunities for cross-species transmission of viruses to and from many other host species, further enhancing their role as amplifiers of viral biodiversity.

            "text": "As discussed above, persistence in the absence of pathology or disease appears to be a common characteristic of bat viruses in their natural host population and this is also indicative of a highly evolved relationship [1 ,18 ,32,55 ] . The ecological balance that maintains infection and transmission in the absence of disease favors both pathogen and host and it can be argued that each may have contributed to its evolution [1 ]. The host aims to detect and contain or eliminate the pathogen through an effective immune response to avoid disease or mortality. The virus needs only to maintain replication and transmission beyond the extinction threshold (Ro > 1) and the long-term survival of the virus may be improved if this can be achieved in the absence of disease or mortality [56] . However, the high replication rate, mutation frequency and potential for recombination of viruses, particularly RNA viruses, provide a potential for continual adaptation and refinement that far exceeds that of their hosts [57] . It could be argued, therefore, that the most significant characteristic of viral infections in bats may not be the effectiveness of a highly evolved host immune response, but rather the absence of pathology as the result of an ancient and highly evolved viral survival strategy. For many RNA viruses such as those commonly infecting bats, accessory proteins and evolved secondary functions of other viral proteins play a key role in infection by blocking host innate immune defences, modulating cellular signaling pathways and re-directing normal cellular functions [58] [59] [60] . The refinement of these functions during a long evolutionary history in bats may well have defined a successful strategy for long-term survival, even through the periods of catastrophic environmental disruption and diminished biodiversity. Conversely, the severe pathology and disease that often occurs as a result of spill-over of bat viruses into other vertebrate hosts may result not from an inherently less effective immune response but from the disturbance of this finely tuned interaction of viral proteins with their targets in host cells.",

One possibility is through symbiotic enhancement of innate immunity. Although innate immunity has long been considered a broad, nonspecific and nonanamnestic first line of host defence, recent studies have demonstrated that persistent infection with one pathogen may prime host innate immunity to provide cross-protection from others. This has been best illustrated by a study in mice demonstrating that herpesvirus latency confers protection from bacterial in-Mass extinctions, biodiversity and mitochondrial function: Wang, Walker and Poon 653 Table 2 Favorable characteristics for survival and proliferation following the K-T mass extinction of bats and other potential sources of extant viral biodiversity.",

In a paper by Roossinck, examples of 'good viruses' and virus-host symbiosis have also been reviewed for viruses infecting human, wasps, plants, fungi, aphids and bacteria [62 ] . Highly adapted viruses persistently infecting bat populations might also serve to protect bats at the species or population level from predators (e.g., tree roosting animals such as raccoons and opossums, owls and hawks, and primates) in a sense acting as defensive 'biological weapons'. The best defensive weapons are those that do no harm to the host species and are released only when there is an imminent threat of danger and the emerging bat viruses (e.g., henipaviruses and filoviruses) satisfy these requirements. Henipaviruses are believed to persist in bat populations at a very low viral load and are totally harmless to their natural host. However, under stress, the viral load increases, facilitating transmission to other animals [63, 64] . They have a very broad range of susceptible hosts and are highly lethal in many different vertebrate species [65] . Such a mechanism might not be able to protect every individual animal in a population, but it would be an effective way to preserve the species.",

According to the 'rate of living' theories, animals with a high metabolic rate are likely to be short-lived [67 ,68] . Although the combination of small body size, high metabolic rate and long lifespan in bats does not seem to be compatible with this view, recent studies on mitochondrial DNA and cellular processes have indicated that multiple mechanisms exist in bats (and other long lifespan animals such as birds) to allow them to be more efficient in resisting oxidative damages than short lifespan animals [67 ] .",

This paper reports the use of pyrosequencing and a metagenomic approach to analyze the bat guano (excrement) virome. In addition to dietary viruses from insects and plants, a wide range of mammalian viruses was detected, including members of seven known virus families and unidentified viruses falling outside known taxonomic groups. This is the first metagenomic analysis of viruses in wild mammals. 22.
