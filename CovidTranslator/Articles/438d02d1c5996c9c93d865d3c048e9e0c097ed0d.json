If new mutants of SARS coronavirus do initiate another epidemic, administration of prophylactic antibodies to risk groups may supplement the stringent isolation procedures that contained the first SARS outbreak. Method: We developed a mathematical model to investigate the effects of hospital admission and targeted antibody prophylaxis on the reproduction number R, defined as the number of secondary cases generated by an index case, during different SARS outbreak scenarios. Results: Assuming a basic reproduction number R 0 \u00bc 3, admission of patients to hospital within 4.3 days of symptom onset is necessary to achieve outbreak control without the need to further reduce community-based transmission. Control may be enhanced by providing pre-exposure prophylaxis to contacts of hospitalized patients, and through contact tracing and provision of post-exposure prophylaxis. Antibody prophylaxis may also be employed to reduce R below one and thereby restrict outbreak size and duration. Conclusions: Patient isolation alone can be sufficient to control SARS outbreaks provided that the time from onset to admission is short. Antibody prophylaxis as supplemental measure generally allows for containment of higher R 0 values and restricts both the size and duration of an outbreak.",

From the onset, mathematical modeling has proven to be a very useful tool for evaluating the impact of the control measures instigated. [2] [3] [4] The SARS outbreak originated in the Guangdong province of China, from where it spread to Hong Kong and next to Vietnam, Singapore and Canada. On 15 March 2003 , the World Health Organization (WHO) issued a second global alert together with a name for the new disease and a case definition. 1 The outbreak was fully contained by July 2003, the last case occurring in Canada. SARS coronavirus, the causative agent of the new disease, 5,6 most likely was transmitted to humans by the masked palm civet (Paguma larvata). 7 Adaptation to human transmission is possible through a single mutation in the spike glycoprotein of a civet SARS-like virus. 8, 9 As SARS-like viruses continue to circulate in animal reservoirs, 10,11 the risk of another major outbreak remains.",

In this model a distinction was made between SARS transmission before and after an infected individual was hospitalized. We considered two qualitatively different strategies of antibody administration: first, pre-exposure prophylaxis targeted at susceptible persons coming into contact with hospitalized SARS cases (e.g. health care workers or close friends and relatives); and second, post-exposure prophylaxis targeted at exposed persons having been identified through contact tracing of hospitalized SARS cases. Based on our model, we derived an expression for the effective reproduction number of SARS to study conditions for containment and we explored how the size and duration of an outbreak depend on the efficacy of control.",

In addition, we suppose that those infected or removed constitute only a small fraction of the total population, i.e. S is taken to be approximately constant.

Specifically, we studied how targeted administration of prophylactic antibodies might supplement stringent patient isolation procedures in a future SARS outbreak. Mathematic analysis and numeric simulation demonstrate that the addition of antibody prophylaxis to control measures generally allows for containment of higher R 0 values and restricts both the size and duration of an outbreak. Our model differs from most published mathematical SARS models, 3, 4, [21] [22] [23] in that we allow for non-constant infectivity over the course of infection. There is strong evidence that viral shedding slowly increases over the course of infection and reaches a peak in the second week after onset of clinical symptoms, 17, 18 suggesting that the assumption of a constant infectivity does not hold. Analysis of a model using non-constant infectivity revealed that control of SARS through patient isolation was mainly established due to the relatively late infectivity peak during infection. 12 Hence, failure to capture this aspect in the transmission dynamics of SARS could have led to misleading conclusions.",

Hence, our model cannot be classified an ''age of infection'' model because infectivity depends on the time since onset of clinical symptoms rather than the time since infection. An ''age of infection'' model would allow transmission to occur before onset of clinical symptoms, a supposition that is-in the case of SARS-not supported by data. However, our conclusions would not alter if we allowed for the possibility of pre-symptomatic transmission given that infectivity in the early stages of infection would be typically low. 17, 18 Finally, our model is parameterized through empirically defined waiting times. It has recently been demonstrated that ignoring the latent period of infection or making the common approximation of exponentially distributed waiting times gives rise to overtly optimistic predictions for the outcome of control strategies. 25 Although we have made simplifications in other aspects, notably the assumption of a constant pool of susceptible individuals, we feel that the model accurately describes the initial stage of an epidemic.",

            "text": "It has been pointed out before that patient isolation can in principle contain an outbreak of SARS, provided that the time from onset to admission is short. 12 The contribution of other measures in the control of the 2003 SARS epidemic, e.g. quarantine of exposed individuals and widespread use of facemasks, is debatable. A modeling study aimed at simulating the potential response to SARS in Japan concluded that quarantine of the exposed population would be one of the most effective policy procedures. 21 It has even been suggested that, despite the considerable costs involved, quarantine measures in Canada have not only saved lives but also costs. 23 This impact of quarantine is remarkable given the lack of pre-symptomatic transmission of SARS. Within our modeling framework, the benefit of quarantining exposed individuals can only be interpreted in terms of admission interval reduction and contact rate reduction for any day prior to hospitalization. Our results are in line with the finding that personal protection measures in the general population (such as the use of facemasks) offer little protection to the community. 26 We also demonstrate that patient isolation procedures alone will not prevent a SARS epidemic if the transmission rates are only slightly increased compared to the outbreaks in 2003, unless additional measures-such as contact tracing -are put in place. These findings are reminiscent of modeling results obtained for smallpox control. 12, 26, 27 If new variants of SARS coronavirus do initiate another epidemic, the question is to what extent they will resemble the etiologic agent of the first outbreak. The 2003 SARS epidemic was characterized by a high degree of heterogeneity in the number of secondary cases generated by an index case. 3, 18 Whether this heterogeneity represents variability in viral biology or host behavior is unclear, but the available data suggests that SARS can be highly contagious. As the etiologic agent of SARS continues to circulate in natural host species it may evolve into a more transmissible strain. 10, 11 To maximize the opportunity of containment of potentially more transmissible SARS coronavirus variants, and to minimize the size and duration of an outbreak, existing control strategies should be supplemented with specific antiviral strategies. Passive immunization would seem appropriate in a contingency situation, as it can provide a person with instant albeit short-lived protection against infection and could also be used as a post-exposure prophylaxis to prevent disease progression. In rabies, passive immunization is commonly used in combination with vaccination to prevent rabiesexposed individuals from becoming symptomatic. 28 Community-wide containment of infectious disease outbreaks by means of antibody prophylaxis has only been described in a number of cases. In the late 1980s, an outbreak of hepatitis A in a religious community provided an opportunity to assess the impact of immune globulin on the course of the outbreak. 29 Here, the incidence of hepatitis among immune globulin recipients stopped 2 weeks after a 5-day campaign of mass administration. 29 Passive immunization using polyclonal sera has also been reported to prevent infection with respiratory viruses. 30 We have previously characterized monoclonal antibodies directed against the spike glycoprotein of SARS coronavirus, 13 which were highly effective when tested in ferrets. 14 Results from pre-clinical development demonstrate that a combination of two monoclonal antibodies against SARS acts synergistically, 31 hinting at the prospect of an antibody cocktail as a feasible and efficient prophylaxis. The monoclonal antibody cocktail is targeted at two distinct epitopes on the receptor-binding domain of the spike glycoprotein, one of which recognizes the residue that was critical for adaptation to human transmission. 8, 13, 31 Evolution towards human transmission of novel SARS-like coronaviruses would likely require the same adaptation, thus preserving the neutralization potential of the antibody cocktail in case a new SARS outbreak occurs.",

A comprehensive contingency plan for controlling future SARS outbreaks should aim to maximize the range of R 0 values that can be contained, and to minimize the size and duration of an outbreak. Our analysis demonstrates that antibody prophylaxis would be an effective addendum to the array of existing public health measures to control SARS.",
