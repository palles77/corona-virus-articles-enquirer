            "text": "While these anatomic divisions are useful, inciting antigens and effector cells and cytokines rarely totally respect them and pure anterior or posterior uveitis should never be assumed. For example, in a patient with hyphema a dilated fundic examination should always be conducted for the presence of chorioretinal hemorrhage. Likewise, a patient with chorio retinitis should always undergo intraocular pressure (IOP) measurement (tonometry) to assess any involvement of the anterior uvea. That said, some diagnostic, therapeutic and prognostic decisions can be made following determination of whether the patient has predominantly anterior and/or posterior uveal involvement. \u271c Diagnostic implications Although many causative agents of uveitis can lead to panuveitis (eg, feline infectious peritonitis [FIP] virus), many tend to produce signs that predominate in either the anterior uvea (such as feline immunodeficiency virus [FIV] ) or the posterior uvea (such as the systemic mycoses). Therefore, clinically localizing the uveitis to one or both anatomic sites can assist with ranking differential diagnoses as well as choosing and prioritizing diagnostic tests (Table 1) . \u271c Treatment implications Posterior segment disease must be treated via the systemic route while anterior segment inflammation may be treated with topical application of drugs that penetrate the cornea. Hence knowing the extent of uveal involvement is critical before choosing a route of therapy. Additionally, humans report that inflammation of the posterior uvea is not as painful as anterior uveitis. If this is also true in cats, then analgesia may be not be necessary in patients showing no ciliary body involvement. \u271c Prognostic implications Although anterior segment inflammation can be blinding, chorioretinitis is more likely to be associated with vision-threatening outcomes. This reinforces the importance of posterior segment examination before and throughout the course of treatment.",

Even with very complete diagnostic testing, a cause is not discovered in as many as 70% of cats with uveitis. 1 Therefore, although feline uveitis can be subdivided into infectious, inflammatory, traumatic, neoplastic causes, etc, the most clinically relevant classifications are both two-category systems. First, uveitis can be categorized (following detailed diagnostic investigation) as idiopathic or as having an identified cause. While this categorization may at first sight seem too broad to be of any clinical value, it actually permits some critical decisions to be made about therapy. For example, if a cause is identified, then therapy may be targeted at prompt and specific reduction or removal of the antigen (organism, neoplasm, etc) that is driving the immune response with minimal non-specific immunosuppression. An example would be a cat diagnosed with systemic cryptococcosis. Specific antifungal therapy with minimal and only local (ocular) immunomodulation is required and, if successful, should lead to resolution of the uveitis, perhaps with some scarring. By contrast, if after thorough diagnostic testing a cause cannot be found, then the antigen cannot be medically reduced or resolved and this patient will require aggressive non-specific immune damping with the expectation that recurrence might be likely. These two scenarios exemplify the fact that elimination of known causes of uveitis that could progress or even become fatal with immunosuppression is critical, and that categorizing patients into those with a known cause and those with idiopathic uveitis is a very important approach to treating these cats.",

Like elsewhere, these are associated with scarring (fusion of one tissue to another and cicatrization), chronic dysfunction and neovascularization ( Table 2 ). The presence of vascular components within the anterior chamber due to breakdown of the BAB can cause clogging (in the subacute phase) and ultimately scarring (in the chronic stage) of the aqueous outflow tract. This in turn causes raised IOP and ultimately glaucoma. Adhesions may also occur between adjacent tissues; most notably the iris and lens Retroillumination is a powerful method for detecting imperfections in any of the transparent ocular media (tear film, cornea, aqueous, lens or vitreous). In a darkened room, a focal light source (Finoff transilluminator or direct ophthalmoscope) is held close to the examiner's eye and directed into the patient's eye from at least arm's length to elicit the fundic reflection. This is usually gold or green in tapetal animals or red in atapetal individuals. Opacities in the ocular media, such as KPs on the inner cornea, will obstruct the fundic reflection. If KPs cannot be seen initially then retroillumination should be repeated from much closer to the patient after pupillary dilation with one or two drops of tropicamide, at which time an otoscope head without the plastic cone can be used to retroilluminate the eye with added magnification (as pictured here).",

Culture of these aspirates may also be attempted; however, retrospective studies reveal that this is a low-yield approach. 1,6 More recently, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) has been used to detect organism DNA in ocular aspirates or tissue samples. However, due to the extreme sensitivity of this technique certain organisms may be found intraocularly or through surface or blood contamination at the time of sampling in healthy animals, thus lowering the diagnostic sensitivity of this approach. Additionally, since breakdown of the BAB is a hallmark of uveitis, any organism present within the bloodstream can leak into the inflamed eye whether or not it is the cause of the inflammation. Therefore, intraocular detection of such organisms does not prove causation of the uveitis. For these various reasons, false negative and false positive detection of intraocular organisms or their DNA may occur in cats with uveitis.",

Circulating antibodies suggest exposure to that organism but do not necessarily suggest that exposure was recent, let alone current. For example, immunoglobulin (Ig) G titers to Toxoplasma gondii may remain elevated for many years in healthy animals. 7 IgM titers have been assessed as a means of detecting more recent infection. However, like IgG, detection of this antibody class simply reflects exposure to a given organism and not necessarily causation of the current clinical signs; furthermore, IgM titers may not be elevated in animals undergoing recurrent rather than primary disease. 8 An additional complication is that antibody tests can be cross-reactive with related but sometimes nonpathogenic organisms. An example of this is the failure of serologic assays to discriminate between antibodies directed at the FIP virus and those targeting the feline enteric coronaviruses.",

A long-recognized example of this phenomenon is feline herpesvirus 1 (FHV-1), while the recent release of an FIV vaccine means that this organism must now be added to that list. Together, these shortfalls lead to serious concerns regarding the etiologic diagnosis of feline uveitis based on serologic testing alone. In one study, equivalent numbers of cats with and without uveitis had circulating antibodies to FHV-1, 9 while in another study circulating antibodies specific to Bartonella species were more common and of greater titer in cats without uveitis than in cats with uveitis. 10 Regardless, there are some organisms and situations in which antibody testing is useful. For example, because FIV is not usually cleared by the immune system, detection of circulating antibodies to FIV in an unvaccinated cat is considered confirmation of infection with that virus (although does not confirm that any uveitis present is caused by the virus). Conversely, negative titers can sometimes be used to exclude that organism as a cause, especially in cats with chronic uveitis. Detection of circulating antigens, as is done for feline leukemia virus (FeLV) or Cryptococcus species, is also extremely useful in confirming current infection with those organisms. For most other organisms, though, the major use of serology seems to be large, controlled epidemiologic studies.",

The most commonly identified agent in these cats was FeLV and the most commonly identified cause of uveitis was lymphosarcoma or melanoma. 1 In the second study, 139 cats (158 globes) with such severe disease that their eyes were enucleated or the cats died or were euthanazed were retrospectively assessed. A cause was found in only 67% of cases; the most common diagnoses were FIP, FeLV-associated lymphosarcoma and trauma. 12 Table 3 lists the microbiological causes of feline uveitis.

Signalment (younger patients often from a multicat environment), 13 clinicopathologic findings (hyperglobulinemia, lymphocytopenia, and seropositivity to feline coronavirus) 13,14 as well as a highly cellular panuveitis (KPs, hypopyon, chorioretinal granulomas) often permit FIP to be elevated as a prime differential consideration in affected animals ( Table 1 ). The majority of cases are seen with the non-effusive or 'dry' form of the disease and typically ocular signs coexist with other systemic signs such as fever, lethargy, anorexia or neurologic signs 15, 16 The major differential consideration is lymphoma and therefore this is one of the circumstances where aqueocentesis is worth considering. Although pathognomonic cytologic changes are not seen with FIP, patients with l y m p h o m a may have neoplastic cells within the anterior chamber. Additionally, I have found the positive (89%) and negative (99%) predictive values of the triad of hyperglobulinemia, lymphocytopenia and seropositivity to feline coronavirus reported by Sparkes et al 14 to be particularly useful in diagnosing cats with uveitis believed to be due to FIP. Aqueous humor samples from affected cats can be tested for the presence of feline coronavirus DNA. However, this does not provide definitive evidence of FIP as being the cause of uveitis because the PCR assay cannot differentiate FIP from enteric coronaviruses, because enteric coronaviruses in white blood cells can be detected with this assay, and because white blood cells are present intraocularly in uveitis resulting from many different causes. [17] [18] [19] Cats presented with anterior uveitis are sometimes infected with FIV or FeLV; however, the role of these retroviruses is not always directly causal. In fact, FeLV is not a proven cause of anterior uveitis in cats 20 and ocular disease is a very uncommon finding in cats seropositive for this virus. 21, 22 By contrast, FIV is suggested to be a cause of pars planitis, 23 and one study found 84% of cats with advanced FIV infection to have lymphocytic/plasmacytic iridocyclitis when examined histologically. 24 This is sometimes clinically evident as inflammatory cell accumulation in the anterior vitreous immediately behind the iris. 23 However, this lesion, which is termed 'snow banking' (Fig 11) , is not pathognomonic. In fact, it is an incidental finding in some patients with no apparent discomfort or other obvious signs of active uveitis and may represent slower removal of inflammatory cells from the vitreous than from the anterior chamber.",

For these reasons, they are commonly used for feline uveitis. Their systemic use should be reserved until a definitive cause responsive to corticosteroids has been found or, failing this, causes known to be worsened by glucocorticoids have been adequately eliminated. In particular, systemic mycoses must be ruled out as potential causes. Likewise, patients in which lymphoma is possible and which would benefit from multidrug chemotherapy should not be treated with systemic corticosteroids alone. By contrast, topical corticosteroids may be used safely even when an infectious or neoplastic cause might prevent systemic administration of the same drugs. This is because systemic effects are insignificant with short-term topical application. It is possible that topically administered corticosteroids may alter cytologic findings and so, if safe, their use should perhaps be delayed until ocular centesis has been performed. Topical corticosteroids should never be used in the face of corneal ulceration because they can be associated with rapid worsening of the ulcer due to superinfection, collagenolysis, local immunosuppression and delayed wound healing. Prednisolone acetate (1% or 0.125%) and dexametha sone (0.1%) will penetrate intact corneal epithelium and reach the anterior uveal tract. Hydrocortisone (as found in many combined antibiotic-corticosteroid ophthalmic preparations) does not penetrate intraocularly and should not be used.

As with topical corticosteroids, dose and dose frequency of systemically administered glucocorticoids should be carefully reduced based entirely on clinical evidence of waning disease. In cats with acute/subacute uveitis, this can be fairly rapid. Cats with chronic idiopathic (immune-mediated) uveitis require slow tapering (eg, a halving of dose or dose frequency every 2-3 weeks), with the expectation that inflammation may return below a critical dose.

However, they may be preferred in patients with diabetes or other endocrinopathies in which corticosteroid use may not be wise.

If IOP is increased by tropicamide, atropine should not be administered. If atropine therapy is initiated, IOP should be rechecked regularly and the drug discontinued if IOP increases above normal. An ophthalmic ointment formulation rather than a solution should be used because atropine is bitter and passage down the nasolacrimal duct can cause violent salivation and frothing, which is harmless but disturbing to the cat and its owner. Atropine should be applied to effect. Since cycloplegia cannot be observed, the pupil is used for monitoring dose. Depending on the severity of uveitis, once to twice daily application may be needed for the first day or two to open the pupil. Subsequently, once to twice weekly application will often keep the pupil mydriatic. Posterior synechiae will not be resolved with atropine and will prohibit use of pupil size as an indicator of drug efficacy.
