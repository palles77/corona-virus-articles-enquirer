Patient #9, who developed a secondary infection, was an acquaintance of Patient #5 who stayed and dined at the same place as Patient #9 until January 29 th . Patient #9 developed a headache on January 30 th , was managed as a contact case, and tested positive on January 31 st . The third index case imported from abroad involved Patient #12, a 48-year-old man with a history of contact for business reasons, with a Japanese patient who had tested positive for COVID-19 in Japan. This was the first case imported from a country outside China. Following entry to Korea on January 19 th , the patient started experiencing muscle aches on January 20 th . However, COVID-19 was not suspected because he arrivedin Korea from Japan, and thus reporting/testing was delayed.Patient #14 was his wife who stayed with him for more than 10 days before COVID-19 was confirmed. She developed symptoms on January 29 th and subsequently tested positive.The fourth index case involved Patient #15, a 43-year-old man who was being monitored after having close contact with Patient #4 on the plane. He developed a fever and a sore throat on February 1 st and subsequently tested positive. Patient #20, a relative living in the same building but on a different floor, experienced a sore throat on February 4 th and subsequently tested positive.

To obtain demographic, epidemiological, and early clinical information, COVID-19 reporting and surveillance data from Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC), and the 28 case reports of the epidemiological investigation conducted by KCDC rapid response team was utilized. Patient age was provided on the date of diagnosis, and key indicators such as estimated duration of exposure, date of onset of symptoms, and route of transmission were identified by an epidemiological investigator who participated in the field investigation and the epidemiological investigation team at KCDC headquarters. The incubation period was estimated based on the estimated exposure date and the date of symptom onset. However, it must be noted that the data presented in this study may change depending on the results of further epidemiological investigation.Results1. Response to COVID-19 in KoreaOnDecember 31 st , 2019, in Wuhan City, Hubei Province of China, 27 individuals developed pneumonia and all individuals had visited the seafood market in the area. The local centers for disease control and prevention, upon concluding that the novel infection had originated from overseas, established a \"countermeasures taskforce against pneumonia of unknown cause\" and set the crisis level to Blue. Accordingly, the situation overseas was constantly monitored, and surveillance in China was initiated, and responses initiated to suspected cases of infection. For suspected cases, a basic epidemiological assessment was conducted at the local health center and at the discretion of the central investigator, the patient was either admitted to a state-designated, negative-pressure isolation ward for further testing, or control measures of self-isolation and active surveillance were undertaken [3]. On January 20 th , the first case of infection from abroad was confirmed in Korea. Subsequently, the crisis level was scaled up from Blue to Yellow, and KCDC headquarters for the COVID-19 rapid response team was established. On January 27 th , the crisis level was scaled up from Yellow to Orange, and the Ministry of Health and Welfare Central Accident Management Headquarters for the COVID-19 was established. Currently, all ministries of the government are cooperating in response to this novel emerging infectious disease. In particular, to block the transmission of infection among patients under quarantine, Wuhan City was designated as an endemic center for infection on January 8 th . Based on the health questionnaire filled out by travelers from Wuhan at the point of entry, people with body temperature higher than 37.5\u00b0C or respiratory symptoms including coughing were classified as symptomatic and isolated for testing. On January 23 rd , Wuhan airport, which has an average of 300 travelers per day, was shut down by the Chinese government, and travel restrictions were implemented later in Hubei Province, including Wuhan City.",

Considering that Patient #27 developed symptoms on February 4 th , earlier than Patients #25 and #26, and Patient #25 did not have any previous history of overseas travel, it is likely that Patients #25 and #26 were infected by Patient #27.Of the 10 patients with secondary infection and known routes of transmission, 7 were family members including 2 relatives and 3 were acquaintances. All these patients either dined or resided together. Transmission from patients #3 to #6, and from patients #16 to #22 was assumed to have taken place while they dined together at the same place. Patients #6 and #21 did not dine together, but were together for 2 hours at a chapel. Regarding transmission, patients with secondary infection had a history of close contact with the primary patient including physical contact, co-dining, and co-habitation for a considerable amount of time.In summary, of the 28 confirmed cases, 16 were index cases imported from abroad, 10 were secondary infection cases, and 2 remained under investigation to determine the route of transmission. As of February 14 th , the 28 patients had come into close contact with 1,781 people, of whom 1,356 were released from surveillance, and 457 were under selfquarantine, and active surveillance. The suspected sites of transmission for the 10 patients with secondary infection were the home (7 patients, 60.0%), a restaurant, a church, and other locations (1 patient each, 8.3%). The relationship between the primary patient and patients with secondary infection were as follows: family (7 patients, 70.0%, including 2 relatives) and acquaintances (3 patients, 30.0%). This finding suggests that secondary infection occurred among individuals who were in close contact with an infected person for a considerable amount of time whilst they lived and dined together.",
