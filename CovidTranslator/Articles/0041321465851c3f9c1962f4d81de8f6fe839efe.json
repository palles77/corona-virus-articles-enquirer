Objectives: In this work we describe the development of an in-house Real-time Taqman PCR assay for quantification of HPeV in stool specimens. Study designs: A total of 137 fecal specimens previously screened for rotavirus and adenovirus were tested for HPeV virus. Results: A total of 11 out of 137 (8%) episodes of acute gastroenteritis were associated with HPeV genomic detection with median viral load 14678 \u00b1 28927 genomes/mg fecal specimens. There was no significant difference in the detection rate between male and female (54.5% (6/11) vs. 45.5% (5/11). Among the 11 HPeV-positive cases, 2 were also positive for other viral pathogens, including rotavirus (n = 2). Conclusion: In conclusion, the development of a laboratory designed Real Time PCR TaqMan assay for quantitative detection of HPeV and the optimization and standardization of this assay using stool of children with acute gastroenteritis are described.",

            "text": "Gastroenteritis is a common disease in children, characterized by diarrhea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and fever. Especially in low-income countries, gastroenteritis in children is related to substantial mortality and morbidity. Pediatric gastroenteritis remains the second most common cause of child mortality worldwide [1] . Diarrheal disease can be caused by a wide spectrum of parasitic, bacterial, and viral pathogens. In the past decade, there has been a great shift from conventional methods to identify viral pathogens to the utilization of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays, which have proven their advantages over previously used techniques, such as rapid antigen detection and viral culture [2] . The major advantages of molecular diagnostic methods are lower detection limits and, therefore, higher analytical sensitivity for common viruses such as rotavirus (RV) and adenovirus (AdV), and their ability to detect in cultivable viruses such as norovirus (NoV), sapovirus (SaV), and astrovirus (AstV) [3] [4] [5] [6] or more difficult cultivable viruses such as Human Parechoviruses (HPeVs) [7] . Additionally, real-time PCR has the competence to determine the viral load in a semi-quantitative way, expressed as the amount of amplification cycles (cycle threshold (Ct)-value) necessary to detect the pathogen.",

            "text": "Human parechoviruses belong to the family of Picornaviridae, a highly diverse group of small, non-enveloped, single-stranded RNA viruses of positive polarity, many of which cause disease in humans [7] . The genera within the family include important pathogens such as rhinoviruses, enteroviruses, polioviruses and hepatoviruses. On the basis of the phylogenetic analyses of the VP1 (Viral Protein capsid-coding region) encoding region, 16 types have been described. Type 1 (HPeV1) and type 2 (HPeV2) were discovered in children with diarrhea in the United States in 1956, initially designated as echovirus types 22 and 23. In pediatrics, HPeV1 and HPeV2 cause mild gastrointestinal or respiratory illness; more serious diseases have been occasionally reported, including myocarditis, encephalitis, pneumonia, flaccid paralysis, meningitis, fatal neonatal infection and Reye syndrome [7] . HPeV3 not only causes mild gastrointestinal and respiratory tract illness, but also severe illnesses such as sepsis and conditions involving the central nervous system (CNS) [7] , whereas HPeV4-8 seem to cause dis- eases similar to those associated with HPeV1 and HPeV2 infections [7] . HPeV9-16 seem to be rare in human diseases. Little is known about this viral agent causing acute gastroenteritis in Italy, except for one study of HPeV detection in acute gastroenteritis in infants and children less than 5 years old [8] . Thus, the role and effect of HPeV infection in acute gastroenteritis is unclear.",

We tested stool specimens collected from children less than 5 years old for HPeV between December 2014 to April 2015 in Piedmont, Italy. The percentage of HPeV-positive specimens (8%) was lower than that found in other studies in China (55% in Shanghai [12] , 25.3% in Lanzhou [13] and 13.4%) but higher than Italian study (6% [8] or 1% [14] ). The discrepancy might be due to the geographical location, the specific year of sample collection, or the use of different PCR methods. Several studies have evaluated the clinical impact of mixed infections believed to be the cause of severe diarrhea in children under 5, and they have found that the frequencies of mixed infections fluctuate between 5% and 34% [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] in agreement with our data (31.4%). It is difficult to compare such findings as dual infections are often misdiagnosed or not investigated at all in routine laboratory work. For example in our Institution only Rotavirus, Adenovirus and Cultivable bacteria are included in routine tests. Despite the evidence that HPeV play a significant role in various severe pediatric infectious diseases, diagnostic assays are not available for routine clinical practice in every center and therefore their involvement in clinical illnesses is substantially underestimated.",

There is a high degree of variability in analytical performance of quantitative PCR-based assays amongst clinical laboratories. Quantitative monitoring of HPeV loads for individual patients should be performed by the same assay and by the same laboratory. In addition, the interpretation should be based on viral load trends instead of single determinations. The clinical utility of quantitative molecular assays, such as HPeV load, will be markedly improved. This method should solve an emerging clinical problem in the era of increased use of molecular diagnostic tools. Furthermore, more research is needed to clarify the specific characteristics of this clinically relevant group of viruses and develop appropriate treatment strategies.",
