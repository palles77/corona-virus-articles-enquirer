            "text": "Proteolytic processing of viral polyproteins is indispensible for the lifecycle of coronaviruses. The main protease (M pro ) of SARS-CoV is an attractive target for anti-SARS drug development as it is essential for the polyprotein processing. M pro is initially produced as part of viral polyproteins and it is matured by autocleavage. Here, we report that, with the addition of an N-terminal extension peptide, M pro can form a domain-swapped dimer. After complete removal of the extension peptide from the dimer, the mature M pro self-assembles into a novel super-active octamer (AO-M pro ). The crystal structure of AO-M pro adopts a novel fold with four domainswapped dimers packing into four active units with nearly identical conformation to that of the previously reported M pro active dimer, and 3D domain swapping serves as a mechanism to lock the active conformation due to entanglement of polypeptide chains. Compared with the previously well characterized form of M pro , in equilibrium between inactive monomer and active dimer, the stable AO-M pro exhibits much higher proteolytic activity at low concentration. As all eight active sites are bound with inhibitors, the polyvalent nature of the interaction between AO-M pro and its polyprotein substrates with multiple cleavage sites, would make AO-M pro functionally much more superior than the M pro active dimer for polyprotein processing. Thus, during the initial period of SARS-CoV infection, this novel active form AO-M pro should play a major role in cleaving polyproteins as the protein level is extremely low. The discovery of AO-M pro provides new insights about the functional mechanism of M pro and its maturation process.

            "text": "SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) was identified as the etiological agent of the pandemic transmissible disease severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). During the outbreak in 2003, SARS-CoV infected more than 8400 people worldwide with a high fatality rate of about 10% (Chan et al., 2003; Kuiken et al., 2003; Leng and Bentwich, 2003) . SARS-CoV is a positive-sense, single-stranded RNA virus, with the 5\u00a2 two-third genome of the virus encoding two overlapping polyproteins pp1a (486 kDa) and pp1ab (790 kDa). During infection, the two polyproteins are proteolytically processed into 16 nonstructural proteins (nsp1-16) required for viral replication and transcription (Snijder et al., 2003) . The proteolytic process is mediated by two virusencoded proteinases, a papain-like proteinase (nsp3) and a 3C-like proteinase (nsp5) (Snijder et al., 2003) . The 3C-like proteinase, also known as the main protease (M pro ), is matured from polyproteins through autocleavage and further cleaves all 11 downstream nonstructural proteins. This makes M pro essential for the viral life cycle, and thus an attractive target for anti-SARS drug development (Anand et al., 2003; Yang et al., 2003 Yang et al., , 2005 .",

Crystal structures of SARS-CoV M pro revealed a symmetric homodimer which has a similar fold to other reported coronavirus M pro structures (Anand et al., 2002 (Anand et al., , 2003 Yang et al., 2003; Xue et al., 2007) . Each protomer in the dimeric structure contains an N-terminal domain (residues 1-184) with a chymotrypsin-like fold and a unique C-terminal domain (residues 201-303) containing five \u03b1-helices. The substrate binding pocket is located in a cleft of the M pro N-terminal domain with the catalytic dyad consisting of residues His41 and Cys145 (Yang et al., 2003) . The N-terminal residues 1-7 (N-finger) of each protomer are squeezed in between the two protomers and make contacts with both the N-terminal and Cterminal domain of the other protomer (Yang et al., 2003) . Therefore, many studies focused on elucidating the roles of N-finger and the C-terminal domain in the dimerization of M pro (Shi et al., 2004; Chen et al., 2005; Wei et al., 2006; Zhong et al., 2008; Hu et al., 2009; Zhong et al., 2009) .",

Each protomer of the active octamer has exactly the same sequence as the previously well characterized matured form of M pro . Crystal structure reveals that, due to 3D domain swapping, the active conformation is locked in the octamer by forming four active units, each adopting the same conformation as the M pro active dimer.

Vice versa, the signature peaks of the M pro -C monomer from residues mentioned above only overlap with those of M-M pro -NE.

The initial substrate hydrolysis rates for M-M pro -NE and D-M pro -NE, both at a total protein concentration of 367 \u03bcg/mL, are 15.0 nM/s and 6.3 nM/s, respectively (Fig. 1C ). Since the monomeric form of mature M pro is inactive, M-M pro -NE should be inactive being a monomer. It is most likely that M-M pro -NE need further dimerize in a similar fashion to that of the M pro active dimer to be active. Meanwhile, as D-M pro -NE is a domain-swapped dimer unrelated to the M pro active dimer, dimerization of two D-M pro -NE molecules may also be required for it to adopt an active conformation. Analytical ultracentrifugation analysis confirmed that there is a small fraction of tetramer in D-M pro -NE (D-M pro -NE tetramer), and a small fraction of M-M pro -NE is in a dimeric form (M-M pro -NE dimer) which should be different from D-M pro -NE (Fig. 1B) . In other words, M-M pro -NE exists in a monomer-dimer equilibrium, while D-M pro -NE exists in a dimer-tetramer equilibrium in solution. The dissociation constant can be calculated from the analytical ultracentrifugation analysis data, and the K d for D-M pro -NE dimer/tetramer is 0.1 mM, while the K d for M-M pro -NE monomer/dimer is 0.8 mM. Therefore, it is estimated that the amount of D-M pro -NE tetramer is about 2 times over that of the M-M pro -NE dimer when the total protein concentration is 367 \u03bcg/mL. This is consistent with the 2-fold difference in the detected enzymatic activity between D-M pro -NE and M-M pro -NE.",

Therefore, we have discovered a previously unknown form of mature M pro , which is a novel active octamer (AO-M pro ).

Therefore, we discovered a novel superactive octameric form of mature M pro .",

The structures of all eight monomer-like structural units are almost identical, and each adopts essentially the same conformation as that of one protomer in the crystal structure of the M pro active dimer (Yang et al., 2003; Xue et al., 2007) . Although the two protomers within one DSD have very similar conformations, structures of the inner DSD protomers differ greatly from those of the outer DSD protomers. While all eight protomers have almost identical structures for the swapped domain and the remaining domain, the difference lies on the relative orientation of the swapped domain toward the remaining domain in each protomer. Specifically, superimposing the remaining domains, the two swapped domains nearly rotate 180\u00b0to each other between the two types of protomers, which is resulted from the conformation difference in the hinge loop region (Fig. 4B) . This difference in protomers leads to the conformational difference between inner and outer DSDs, which is characterized by the difference in the relative orientation for the two monomer-like structural units within one DSD (Fig. 4A) .",

As a result, two monomer-like structural units connected by hinge loops are formed in each DSD. Meanwhile, two monomer-like structural units from different DSDs form an active unit through the same interactions as those monomer-like structural unit of the M pro active dimer. However, different from M pro active dimer, these interactions occur among four different protomers instead of two for each active unit ( Fig. 3B and 3C) . Therefore, each active unit is connected to two other active units by hinge loops in AO-M pro . All these features stabilize the octamer structure and enable the active conformation to be locked. In addition, flexibility of hinge loops is characteristic of 3D domain swapping, which enables the formation of four active units in AO-M pro . 3D domain swapping is generally regarded as a mechanism for protein oligomerization and aggregation. Here, in SARS-CoV M pro , 3D domain swapping serves as a mechanism to enhance the dimerization affinity for the active conformation formation and enables the enzyme to be locked in the active conformation and to be constantly active, representing a new role of 3D domain swapping in protein functions.",

Evidently, a critical concentration threshold must be reached before the active dimer is constantly present.

            "text": "Moreover, as there are four active units and thus eight active sites in AO-M pro and the substrates of M pro have multiple M pro cleavage sites (7 for pp1a and 11 for pp1ab), the interaction between AO-M pro and pp1a/pp1ab could very well be a unique case of polyvalent interaction between enzyme and substrate. Polyvalent interactions are characterized by the simultaneous binding of multiple ligands on one biologic entity (a molecule, a surface, etc) to multiple receptors on another (Mammen et al., 1998) , and have been implicated to play pivotal roles in some important biologic processes, such as cancer metastasis (Cattaruzza and Perris, 2005) , virus and bacterial infections (Mammen et al., 1998) , wound healing (Minor and Peterson, 2002) , chromatin modifications (Ruthenburg et al., 2007) , and transcription regulations (Mammen et al., 1998) . In a polyvalent interaction, the binding affinity between a multivalent ligand and a multiplevalent receptor increases with the increasing number of ligands and receptors. As the eight active sites are dispersedly distributed and are all accessible, it is quite possible for AO-M pro to simultaneously recognize and digest multiple cleavage sites of one polyprotein substrate. Thus, compared to M pro active dimer which has only two active sites, the binding affinity between AO-M pro and its polyprotein substrates could be much higher, with the potential to increase the proteolytic activity of AO-M pro toward pp1a/pp1ab. Furthermore, it was reported that M pro exhibits quite different affinities and activities toward the 11 different M pro cleavage sequences in the polyprotein substrates (Fan et al., 2004) . It is expected that the polyvalent interaction nature and the simultaneous cleavage ability of AO-M pro should significantly increase the affinity and activity of M pro toward low efficiency cleavage sites by decreasing the dissociation rate (k off ) of the enzyme/ substrate complex. In addition, with 8 active sites, it is also possible for AO-M pro to hydrolyze more than one polyprotein substrate at the same time. Therefore, although we have only shown that AO-M pro has higher activity for a single site substrate than M pro active dimer at low protein concentrations, it is theoretically conceivable that the actual activity of AO-M pro toward polyprotein substrates could be even much higher than that of the well-known M pro active dimer with only two active sites.",

Xue et al. (2007) have reported that extra residues to the N terminus of M pro , but not the C terminus, can significantly reduce the activity of SARS-CoV M pro . This is consistent with the low enzymatic activity of M pro -NE we observed, which may imply that mature M pro is quite different from M pro in polyproteins prior to self-cleavage. It has been proposed that M pro has to be activated by auto-cleavage from this inactive polyprotein precursor before it can cleave the polyprotein at other cleavage sites . In a sense, the process for generating mature M pro from M pro -NE is somewhat analogous to that of the M pro maturation process, and AO-M pro matured from D-M pro -NE should be as biologically relevant as the commonly studied forms of the mature M pro .",

Therefore, it is tempting to speculate that AO-M pro may play an important role in polyprotein maturation at an early stage of SARS-CoV infection when concentrations of pp1a, pp1b, and mature M pro are extremely low.",

Almost all these studies are carried out with mature M pro , and little is clearly known about M pro in the viral polyproteins and its maturation process. Recently, Chen et al. reported that two monomeric mutants of M pro can still perform N-terminal autocleavage, while the dimerization of mature protease and trans-cleavage activity following auto-processing are completely lost (Chen et al., 2010) . They proposed that the auto-processing of M pro from polyproteins is through an \"intermediate dimer\" structure which does not strictly depend on the active conformation existing in mature M pro , and the possible \"intermediate dimer\" may be formed through Cterminal domain dimerization. It is of interest to find out whether this \"intermediate dimer\" is related to the M pro -NE domain-swapped dimer we observed. The finding by Chen et al. and our discovery of the super-active octameric form of SARS-CoV main protease indicate that the functional mechanism of this important enzyme may be far more complicated than we thought, and that more studies are necessary to reveal its genuine biologic function mechanism.",

The resulting plasmid encodes M pro -NE which has an extra 26-residue fusion peptide (MGSSHHHHHHSSGLVPRGSHMDDDDK) including an enterokinase cleavage site right in front of the N terminus of mature M pro . The plasmid was transformed into the E. coli BL21 (DE3) strain for protein production. Cells were grown in LB medium containing 100 \u03bcg/mL of kanamycin at 35\u00b0C until A 600 reached 0.8, and were induced with 0.5 mM IPTG. After 8 h, the cells were harvested by centrifugation at 5000 g for 10 min.
