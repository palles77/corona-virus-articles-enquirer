However, for many systems, it has 29 been difficult to disentangle the relative impact of these forces empirically. In RNA viruses, an 30 observed correlation between mutation rate and virulence has led many to argue that their 31 extremely high mutation rates are advantageous, because they may allow for increased 32 adaptability. This argument has profound implications, as it suggests that pathogenesis in many 33 viral infections depends on rare or de novo mutations. Here we present data for an alternative 34 model whereby RNA viruses evolve high mutation rates as a byproduct of selection for 35 increased replicative speed. We find that a poliovirus antimutator, 3D G64S , has a significant 36 replication defect and that wild type and 3D G64S populations have similar adaptability in two 37 distinct cellular environments. Experimental evolution of 3D G64S under r-selection led to 38 reversion and compensation of the fidelity phenotype. Mice infected with 3D G64S exhibited 39 delayed morbidity at doses well above the LD 50 , consistent with attenuation by slower growth as 40 opposed to reduced mutational supply. Furthermore, compensation of the 3D G64S growth defect 41 restored virulence, while compensation of the fidelity phenotype did not. Our data are consistent 42 with the kinetic proofreading model for biosynthetic reactions and suggest that speed is more 43 important than accuracy. In contrast to what has been suggested for many RNA viruses, we find 44 that within host spread is associated with viral replicative speed and not standing genetic 45 diversity.",

While 78 interspecific mutation rates range from 10 -4 to 10 -6 errors per nucleotide copied [4], studies of 79 antimutators and hypermutators suggests that fidelity can only vary by several fold within a 80 species [27]. The severe burden of mutational load exerts a strong downward pressure on 81 mutation rates and hypermutator strains are attenuated in vivo [9,28-31]. Given the short 82 generation times and remarkable fecundity of many RNA viruses, a small kinetic cost to higher 83 fidelity should result in strong selection against antimutators [32,33]. However, the observed 84 attenuation of antimutator RNA viruses in vivo has led many to argue for the adaptive benefit of 85 high mutation rates, as genetic diversity provides a rich substrate for a virus' evolution in the 86 face of varying intrahost environments [7,10,34-38]. This concept is central to viral quasispecies 87 theory, which generally proposes a link between genetic diversity and viral fitness [24,25].",

The basal mutation rate of 3D G64S is reported to be 93 ~20-30% that of wild type virus (WT). While the 3D G64S mutant is attenuated in poliovirus 94 receptor transgenic mice, the relative importance of replicative speed and fidelity to this 95 phenotype is not clear [7,36].

We derived a quantitative 120 model of this trade-off (see SI Model 1) by measuring the replicative fitness (Fig. 1F ) and 121 mutation rate (Fig. 1G, Table S1 ) of WT and 3D G64S under exposure to an exogenous mutagen, 122 ribavirin [43].

Therefore, any fitness benefit of the high baseline mutation rates in WT would 125 presumably need to offset this cost. In 3D G64S , the cost of mutational load is reduced to 0.037.",

Similarly, we find that the widely accepted 274 link between within host genetic diversity and virulence is confounded by the fact that faster 275 replicating viruses are both more virulent and have higher mutation rates. The high mutation 276 rates of RNA viruses and the highly deleterious fitness effects of mutations ensure that most 277 genetic diversity is extremely rare and unlikely to be consistently maintained in the face of 278 intrahost and interhost bottlenecks [52]. We do not dispute that virus populations will harbor 279 minority variants, that a subset of these mutations may be adaptive or beneficial to the virus, 280 and that some may be virulence determinants. However, the observation of genetic diversity is 281 not in and of itself evidence that selection has optimized mutation rates for the future benefit of 282 novel mutations. Indeed, our data show little adaptive benefit to a marginally increased mutation 283 rate and identify no plausible mechanism whereby the observed increase in rare genetic 284 diversity can influence pathogenesis. We suspect that RNA viruses are subject to other trade-12 offs of evolutionary significance, perhaps between polymerase speed and recombination rate or 286 recombination rate and polymerase fidelity. Here too, it will be important to define the selective 287 forces at play, thereby separating the causes from the consequences. ",

(A) Schematic of GTP misincorporation assay (G opposite the U). Primer-template (sym-subU) and polymerase are assembled in the absence of nucleotide. GTP and a 25-fold excess of unlabeled trap RNA are then added after an incubation period (\u0394t). Excess of RNA trap ensures that if the polymerase dissociates from primer-template it is taken up by the trap and cannot re-assemble. (B) Kpol and Kd for GMP misincorporation. Concentrations of GTP were used over time-points to calculate Kpol and Kd. Each GTP time-course was plotted to single exponential, then combined plot to hyperbola.
