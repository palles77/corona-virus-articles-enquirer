We analyzed the fecal virome of four strains (A, B, C, and D) of ducks living in isolation by using metagenomic analysis. The feces of the ducks tested contained 18 animal virus families. The percentage values of RNA virus reads, compared to the total animal virus reads in each of the four strains were 96.96% (A), 97.30% (B), 98.01 (C), and 67.49% (D), and were mainly from Orthomyxoviridae, Mimiviridae, Bunyaviridae, Picobirnaviridae, and Reoviridae. Meanwhile, the minority of DNA virus reads were related to Herpesviridae, Adenoviridae, Iridoviridae, and other, low abundance viral families. The percentage values of Orthomyxoviridae, Mimiviridae, Bunyaviridae, Picobirnaviridae, and Herpesviridae reads were not significantly different among strains A, B, and C; however, there were marked differences in the abundance of these reads in strain D. In summary, this study provides an unbiased examination of the viral diversity in the feces of four strains of ducks in specific-pathogen-free periods, and highlights the variation in the percentage of viral families present. These results can be used as a reference for detecting duck viral pathogens and predicting zoonotic potential.",

China is one of the most prominent countries for duck breeding in world, having the highest duck slaughter rates and breeding stocks. Domestic ducks and waterfowl live side by side in the rice fields and wetlands in China, and the common-living environment provides opportunity for contact between wild and domestic birds [2] . The ducks are a reservoir host of mammalian viruses in nature. Many studies indicate that ducks and geese are more responsible for virus transmission over large geographic distances than gulls and shorebirds [3, 4] . Many reports suggest that low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) strains are more frequently isolated from ducks than gulls and shorebirds [3, 5] . This demonstrates that ducks play an important role in amplifying and hosting a range of mammalian viruses [6, 7] .",

Once any virus pathogens were detected in the ducks, they were eliminated immediately. Fecal specimens from four strains were collected in December 2015. Three fecal samples were taken from ducks of each strain, and three fecal samples from the same strain were mixed into a single sample. The sample was immediately suspended in phosphate buffer saline (PBS). The stool suspension was centrifuged at 12,000\u00d7g at 4 \u00b0C and the pellet was discarded. The supernatant was transferred to a new tube and centrifuged for a second time. The supernatant was filtered through a 0.22 \u00b5m filter, in order to remove the nucleic acid not in viral capsid, and we added DNaseI (Roche Basel, Switzerland) and RNaseH (Toyobo, Tokyo, Japan) to the filtrates [8] . Viral DNA was isolated according to the traditional phenol/chloroform extraction method, and viral RNA was extracted using RNAiso plus (Takara, Dalian, China) [14, 15] . The extracted RNA was reverse-transcribed using SISPA (Sequence-independent, single primer amplification), with the K-8N primer (GAC CAT CTA GCG ACC TCC ACNNNNNNNN) described previously [16] [17] [18] . The dsDNA and viral DNA were mixed and detected using the Qubit dsDNA HS assay (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA).

However, the percentage of RNA virus reads in the total animal virus reads was lowest for strain D, compared to the other strains. Meanwhile, the percentage of Picobirnaviridae and Herpesviridae reads was highest for strain D, while the percentage values of Orthomyxoviridae, Mimiviridae, Bunyaviridae reads in strain A, strain B, and C strain were markedly higher than in strain D. These results suggested that the D strain ducks were more susceptible to viruses. The susceptibility and adsorption of the C strain may be very low for viruses. However, the difference in abundance of each viral family among the four duck strains reflected that the susceptibility of different strains for one viral family may be different. The four strains were divided based on their genetic background. The division genes of these strains may be key factors for adsorption, susceptibility, and innate immune response to viruses. The differences that occur among the strains may be related to susceptibility genes and the innate immune-related host genes [30] . However, Pekin, Muscovy, and mallard ducks infected with an H5N1 HPAI showed a systemic infection with high mortality. Muscovy ducks produced more severe clinical symptoms and had a poor response to vaccination. Nevertheless, the expression of innate immune-related genes was similar in the spleens of ducks infected with viruses [31] . In this study, we did not detect the expression of innate immune-related genes from the four duck strains.
