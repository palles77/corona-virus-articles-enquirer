            "text": "Children with neurogenic bladders frequently have positive urine cultures. However, determining when a positive urine culture represents at urinary tract infection (UTI) as opposed to urinary tract colonization (UTC) can be difficult. 1 Indeed, as more than half of urine cultures from children with neurogenic bladders are positive in the absence of symptoms, 2 a positive urine culture is not diagnostic of a UTI in these children. Furthermore, there is no widely accepted definition of UTI in children with neurogenic bladders, 3 which contributes to the significant variability in the way that clinicians both diagnose and treat suspected UTIs in this population. [3] [4] [5] As there is no defintion of UTI in these children, clinicians rely on their assessment of symptoms to diagnose a UTI. However, while the combination of some symptoms is generally considered diagnostic of a UTI, such as fever, abdominal pain, and vomiting in the absence of another source, other symptoms, such as increased incontinence or discomfort with catheterization, are less clear. Indeed, in a series of adults with neurogenic bladder, symptoms were found to be non-specific for UTI. 6 There is an absence of accurate biomarkers that have good predictive accuracy for UTI in children with neurogenic bladders. While specific urinalysis (UA) parameters have good sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of UTI in the general pediatrics population, 7, 8 UA results are less useful in diagnosing UTIs in patients with neurogenic bladders. 9 This is likely related to the fact that components of the UA are either markers of inflammation (ie, pyuria, leukocyte esterase) or indicative of the presence of an organism (eg, nitrites) and are not specific for UTI in this population. A more accurate and objective method to diagnose UTIs in this population is needed. Indeed, there is a rapidly rising trend in antibioticresistant organisms cultured from urine in children with neurogenic bladders. 10 Although this is multifactorial, one reason behind trend is the large number of antibiotics that these children receive. Identification of a biomarker that is both sensitive and specific for UTIs in this urologically complex patient population would improve the ability to appropriately prescribe antibiotics.",

This included patients presenting for urodynamics, who have routine urine cultures sent at our institution, and those presenting for evaluation of potential UTI. Patients who met inclusion criteria (ie, presence of a neurogenic bladder, actively performing CIC) were initially identified in the electronic health record (EPIC\u2122, Verona, WI) using the International Classification of Diseases, 9th revision codes for neurogenic bladder or spina bifida. Following initial identification, the research team then performed a manual review of each patient's medical record to confirm that inclusion criteria were met. All eligible patients were then flagged in VigiLanz\u2122 (VigiLanz Corporation, Minneapolis, MN), a real-time lab monitoring software that sent an automatic notification via e-mail to the research team when a flagged patient had a urine sample sent to the clinical laboratory. The residual urine was then obtained for use in this work. Patients were excluded for the following reasons: if they met the KDIGO criteria for acute kidney injury, 12 had signs or symptoms of sepsis 13 at the time of presentation, or if they were dialysis-dependent. The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board.",

Sample volumes were reduced with a 3-kDa filter into 1\u00d7 Laemmli buffer. The protein concentrations were measured using the Pierce 660 nm Protein Assay kit (Thermo Scientific) as this assay is both compatible with higher concentrations of detergents and maintains a greater linear range than standard Coomassie dye-binding assays (eg, Bradford assay). The samples were then run in a 1D, 1.5 cm 4% to 12% Bis-Tris gel using MOPS (3-(morpholino)propanesulfonic acid) running buffer. The regions of each lane between the well and the dye front were excised for trypsin digestion. The resulting peptides were extracted and the control lanes pooled together. The recovery of the digested peptides in each sample was determined via Nanodrop analysis. The resulting peptides from each sample were tagged with the indicated iTRAQ reagent using the vendor instructions. Samples for each iTRAQ set were mixed 1:1:1:1 based on the peptide Nanodrop reading and loaded onto a Sciex 5600+ nanoflow LC-mass spectrometry system, as Forster et al 3 previously described. 15 Each 4-plex set contained one common control sample made from an equal protein mixture of all samples in the cohort. Measuring protein ratios against a single common control then allows for cross comparison of the relative protein levels among all the samples in the cohort. ProteinPilot software (Sciex) was used to identify the proteins and determine the relative quantitation from each run. A merged search of all runs identified the full scope of proteins detected across all groups. The ProteinPilot data were then processed through Protein Alignment Template software from Sciex. Proteins with a significant fold-change between the UTI and UTC groups (those at >50% change in the average abundance across groups) were identified as proteins of interest. Operators were blinded to sample group until the analysis stage, when unblinding was necessary to interpret the results.",

There were no differences in age, sex, race, etiology of neurogenic bladder, presence of Mitrofanoff, or bladder augmentation between those with UTC and UTI in the mass spectrometry analysis. In the assay analysis, there was a higher proportion of males in the no growth group compared with the UTC group. There were no other differences between groups (Table 1) . More than 200 proteins were identified using mass spectrometry. From this protein set, 100 proteins were consistently detected and quantified in at least 3 of the 5 patients from both groups and were subjected to t test analysis to establish the significance of the change (Supplemental Figure S1 ). There were a few examples of proteins that were detected in 3 or more of one group and less than 3 in the other group; however, in each case, the levels of the protein detected in the group of 3 were well outside of a significance P value of .05. After removing contaminating hemoglobin and several immunoglobulin proteins likely linked to minor blood contamination and/or inflammatory response, 8 proteins were identified with P <.05 as proteins of interest based on at least a 0.5-fold increase or decrease in the 2 test groups. These included haptoglobin, apolipoprotein D, alpha-amylase 2B, inter-a-trypsin inhibitor heavy chain H4, RNase2, CD44 antigen, liver fatty acid-binding protein, and prosaposin ( Figure 1 ).

There were no significant differences between either normalized or non-normalized concentrations of either RNase2 or apolipoprotein D (Figure 2 ). Normalized prosaposin concentrations were significantly higher in UTI compared with no growth (P = .003) and UTC (P = .05). Normalized CD44 was significantly higher in UTI compared with UTC (P = .02), although there was no difference in normalized CD44 concentrations between UTI and no growth ( Figure  2 ). Non-normalized prosaposin was significantly higher in UTI compared with both no growth (P = .02) and UTC (P = .05). .

Liver fatty acid-binding protein was identified as a protein of interest, but not included as it is a known marker of tubular injury, 18 and therefore had the potential to confound our results. Similarly, we chose not to further investigate inter-a-trypsin inhibitor heavy chain H4 as it is also elevated in patients with decreased renal function. 19 Urine haptoglobin has been reported to be elevated in multiple conditions, including lupus nephritis, 20 diabetic nephropathy, 21 and urothelial cancer. 22 Given the presence of haptoglobin in multiple other conditions, it likely would not be a specific marker in UTI and therefore was not chosen as a protein of interest.",

[26] [27] [28] [29] [30] In this capacity, CD44 serves a role in the innate immune system, through both defense against pathogens 31 and stimulation of antimicrobial peptide production. 32 In addition, CD44 may also play a role in the pathogenesis of certain infections, including UTI. Indeed, Escherichia coli binds to CD44 in a hyaluronic acid-mediated mechanism and through this interaction invades urothelial cells. 33 Furthermore, CD44 knockout mice demonstrate increased bacterial clearance following transurethral inoculation compared with wild type, with no difference noted in neutrophil accumulation or activity. 33 However, the increase seen in urinary CD44 in this work is likely related to the fact that CD44 is constitutively expressed on the urothelial cells. 33 As one of the responses of the bladder to infection is exfoliation of superficial urothelial cells, 34 it is likely that the increased concentration of urinary CD44 seen in patients with UTI in this work is a result of the exfoliated urothelial cells.",

Apolipoprotein D has many functions, but has been most widely studied within the context of lipid metabolism and neurological disease. 40 However, it may also play a role in modulation of inflammation in the setting of infection. 41 Apolipoprotein D is a lipocalin 40 and as such may bind ligands with implications in the innate immune system. However, the known ligands for apolipoprotein D consist mainly of lipids within high-density lipoproteins or plasma membranes. 42 Accordingly, most of the known functions of apolipoprotein D involve the neurological system. 42 There is scant literature on the utility of this protein in the setting of infection. It is possible that apolipoprotein D is present in the urine of patients with neurogenic bladder due to its role within the neurological system and underlying etiology of neurogenic bladder. RNase2, also known as eosinophil-derived neurotoxin, is a protein found in granules within eosinophils. While initially described in the urine, RNase2 was later found to have the same structure as eosinophil-derived neurotoxin, 43 a protein that is upregulated by Th2-driven allergic inflammation or parasitic infection. 43 Furthermore, RNase2 has anti-viral activity, specifically against single-stranded RNA viruses, 44 and can induce the migration of dendritic cells, but not neutrophils, monocytes, or T-cells. 45 While urinary RNase2 has been described in allergic 46 and parasitic diseases, 47 it has not been described in the context of bacterial infections. The presence of this protein in the urine of our patients may be related to dendritic cell migration. While there is no statistical significance in this protein, there were several patients in the UTI group with elevated levels of RNase2 although no differences in the median concentration. Further work is needed to understand the role, if one exists, of RNase2 in UTIs.",

While we report significant elevations in both prosaposin and CD44 in UTI compared with UTC, results from mass spectrometry suggest that these proteins are increased in UTC when compared with UTI. One possible explanation is the different methods of normalization. Samples were loaded into the mass spectrometer based on total protein concentration. While the literature is mixed on the presence of proteinuria in cystitis, there is data to suggest the presence of tubular proteinuria in pyelonephritis. 49 It is likely that most patients in the identification arm had pyelonephritis, as they were chosen based on their unequivocal presentation for UTI. Therefore, these patients likely had a higher degree of proteinuria, leading to a smaller amount of urine used for the analysis. Conversely, urine was loaded into the confirmatory assays based on volume, not concentration. Therefore, it is possible that tubular proteinuria in our patients with UTI led to these conflicting results. Indeed, our enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) results do display an increase in both prosaposin and CD44 in UTC when compared with children with no growth on urine cultures; this increase was further magnified in the UTI group with added specificity, suggesting their utility as specific markers of UTI in children with neurogenic bladders.",

There is significant variation in the clinical management of bacteriuria in this patient population, as well as the definition of UTI used in research. 3 Therefore, we have chosen a definition that appears in the literature for use in research, but realize that this is still an imperfect definition. To mitigate some of the potential for misclassification bias, we performed an additional review of the patients' charts to ensure that there was no ambiguity around the classification of either infection or colonization. However, the combination of the definition that we used plus clinical acumen is still imperfect, and thus, the lack of a validated way to differentiate UTI from colonization remains a limitation of this work. Other limitations include the limited number of patients used in both arms of this work, and the inability to better match patients with UTI and UTC in the mass spectrometry arm. Furthermore, we did not perform stability studies on the proteins of interest and are unable to determine whether or not prolonged storage could affect these levels. However, as all urine samples used in this work were stored for the same amount of time, we anticipate this likely did not affect our results of the differentially upregulated proteins. A final limitation is the use of urine creatinine for normalization. We used urine creatinine to standardize the proteins for urine concentration, which may not be the ideal method of standardization in this cohort. Given the differences in body habitus and anthropomorphic measurements in this population, the production of serum creatinine is variable, 50 which directly impacts the utility of urine creatinine as a method of normalization. Therefore, the use of urine creatinine may be confounding our results.",

Urinary prosaposin and CD44 may help identify children with neurogenic bladders at the point of care who do not require antibiotics for treatment of UTI, although further work is needed to validate these results.",
