Therefore, a prospective case-control study was conducted to determine the prevalence of respiratory viruses in CRS patients and non-CRS controls. Nasal lavage fluids and turbinate epithelial cells were collected prospectively from 111 CRS patients and 50 controls. Multiplex PCR was used to identify common respiratory viruses in both sample types and the infection rate was compared between groups. Respiratory viruses were detected in 50.5% of lavage samples and in 64.0% of scraping samples from CRS patients. The overall infection rate was significantly different in CRS patients and controls (odds ratio, 2.9 in lavage and 4.1 in scraping samples). Multiple viral infections were detected more frequently in lavage samples from CRS patients than those from controls (P < 0.01; odds ratio, 7.7).",

Clinically, respiratory viral infections are often implicated as triggers of CRS flare-ups (2, 3) . Nevertheless, many researchers consider that there is insufficient evidence that respiratory viral infection is related to the pathogenesis of CRS, because viruses are virtually ubiquitous in the general population and they are not linked to persistent sinonasal inflammation. However, some experimental studies have suggested an important role for viral pathogens during the exacerbation and ongoing inflammation in CRS (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) . In vitro studies using human sinonasal epithelial cells have demonstrated that viral infection or exposure to a synthetic viral analogue increases the expression of immune effectors (4, 5) . Respiratory viral infections are also known to damage the nasal epithelial cells and cilia (6) , cause dysfunctions of intercellular junctions such as tight junctions and adherens junctions (7) , and increase bacterial adhesion (8) .",

A number of studies with asthmatic patients have demonstrated a very strong association between respiratory viral infection and acute exacerbations of asthma (10) (11) (12) . A pilot study tested the presence of rhinovirus in the nasal cavity of CRS patients, and rhinoviruses were detected in 8/39 (21%) epithelial cell samples from CRS patients, whereas none were detected in the controls (13) . This preliminary study suggested that rhinovirus may be associated with CRS pathogenesis, although the number of viral species tested and the number of patients enrolled were limited. There is also a paucity of respiratory viral surveillance studies in CRS patients, and such studies could elucidate the associations between mucosal inflammation of CRS and respiratory viruses. Thus, the prevalence of viral pathogens in CRS patients with no signs of acute viral infection was investigated in this prospective study using multiplex PCR assay to sensitively detect various respiratory viruses in nasal samples. After samples were collected from control subjects without CRS, the respiratory virus infection rate in CRS patients was compared with that in control subjects. These data might provide new insights into the putative role of respiratory viruses in promoting symptoms and aggravation of mucosal inflammation of CRS.",

One hundred twenty-two patients were recruited prospectively who had received endoscopic sinus surgery for CRS, which had not been controlled after optimal medical treatment, between August 2011 and March 2012 at the Asan Medical Center, Seoul, South Korea. All patients met the established diagnostic criteria for CRS (14) . Patients with fungal sinusitis, current immunotherapy, aspirin desensitization, or cystic fibrosis were excluded from this study. Further reasons for exclusion were treatment with local or oral steroids within the previous 4 weeks. The controls were volunteers who required planned surgery for chronic tonsillitis or thyroid masses, but none of the controls had experienced CRS. The presence of sinusitis in the control group was ruled out based on their history, physical examination, plain sinus X-ray, and/or computed tomography (CT) imaging. All patients and control subjects were checked for viral upper respiratory infection (URIs) over a 4-week period. URI symptoms were assessed using the Jackson scale of eight symptoms: nasal discharge, nasal congestion, sneezing, cough, malaise, throat discomfort, fever/chills, and headache (15) . Eleven CRS patients with symptoms or signs of viral URIs during the preceding 4 weeks were excluded from the study. Asthma was defined as a history of asthma symptoms (recurrent dyspnea, wheezing, cough, and chest tightness) associated with reversible airflow obstruction, measured by spirometry (16) . Allergic rhinitis was defined by 2 or more allergic symptoms (watery rhinorrhea, nasal obstruction, nasal itching, and sneezing) for over 1 h on most days and a positive skin prick test or detectable serum-specific IgE (17) . The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the Asan Medical Center (Seoul, South Korea).

The sample size was approximately equally distributed over the months, i.e., 13 to 14 samples/month from CRS patients and 7 to 8 samples/month from control subjects. To verify the presence of respiratory viruses in the study population, two high-sensitivity sampling techniques were used, i.e., nasal lavage and scrapes of the nasal epithelium from the inferior turbinate. Both methods were described in our previous study (13) , where mucosal scraping was found to be more sensitive than nasal lavage for viral detection. In the operating room, nasal lavage samples were collected immediately after the induction of general anesthesia. A balloon catheter was placed posterior to the nasal cavity and choana, before sterile saline solution (0.9% NaCl) at room temperature was aerosolized into the nostrils using a needle-free syringe. This procedure was repeated alternately in the nostrils until 10 ml of lavage fluid was recovered. After lavage, the inferior turbinate epithelial cells were scraped from the medial aspect of the middle third of the inferior turbinate using a sterile disposable Rhino-probe mucosal curette (Arlington Scientific, Inc., Springville, UT). Scrape samples were removed immediately from the Rhino-probe cusp and transferred to plastic tubes containing 2 ml of sterile phosphate-buffered saline. The samples were frozen immediately after collection and stored at \u03ea70\u00b0C until use.",

Each cDNA was subjected to multiplex PCR using a Seeplex RV15 ACE detection kit (Seeplex RV15; Seegene Inc., Seoul, South Korea), according to the manufacturer's instruction. Briefly, 3 l of synthesized first-strand cDNA, 5\u03eb RV15 primer mix, 2\u03eb multiplex master mix (Taq DNA polymerase and dNTPs included), and 3 l 8-methoxypsoralen (8-MOP) solution were mixed. The primer mixes contained the internal control template and primer pairs to validate the PCR. Three reactions (using primer mixes A, B, and C) were conducted for each sample, according to the kit instructions. The specific primer targets for each respiratory virus are shown in Table 1 .

Many studies have demonstrated that a high proportion of asthma patients had respiratory viruses in their respiratory secretions, rhinoviruses were the only respiratory viruses associated with asthma exacerbations (23) (24) (25) (26) . Based on the current study, infections of the nasal cavity by rhinoviruses may have a significant role in the promoting symptoms and ongoing mucosal inflammation of CRS. The presence of respiratory viruses but the absence of symptoms or signs of viral URIs in the CRS participants may be explained in several ways. It may reflect persistent asymptomatic infection, the asymptomatic period before the development of symptomatic infection, or the presence of the virus after symptomatic infection. However, nasal samples were obtained from participants who did not show URI symptoms during the preceding 4 weeks, and none of the subjects developed URI symptoms after postoperative sample collection in the hospital. Therefore, the detection of viruses in the nasal samples may have been due to the subclinical persistence of respiratory viruses from previous infections. A few studies have provided evidence of persistent respiratory viral infections, where HRV can replicate in the cells of the lower respiratory tract and persist for over a year (27) (28) (29) . A previous study by our group also demonstrated persistent infections with parainfluenza virus for up to 3 months in patients with olfactory dysfunctions after virus infections (30) .",

This multitechnique approach to the detection of respiratory viruses improved the sensitivity, and the results of this study confirmed the prevalence of respiratory viruses in the nasal cavity of CRS patients. However, we considered mucosal scraping as more clinically significant and specific method than nasal lavage fluid, since the turbinate epithelial cells may better reflect sinus mucosa. In addition, nasal lavage fluid might have an increased chance of trapping viruses floating in ambient air, thus resulting in higher false-positive rates, and of containing a more mixed viral infection than the scraping samples. Another strength of this study was the use of very sensitive multiplex PCR assays (Seeplex RV15; Seegene Inc., Seoul, South Korea) for a full range of respiratory viruses. Other studies have also shown that this multiplex PCR approach is more sensitive for detecting respiratory viruses compared with conventional methods (35, 36) .",

            "text": "This study had some limitations. First, there were differences in the baseline number of case patients and control subjects (111 CRS patients and 50 control subjects). In addition, the control subjects were heterogeneously diagnosed and composed of patients with chronic tonsillitis (n \u03ed 24) or thyroid masses (n \u03ed 26). However, great efforts were made to ensure the adequate selection of control subjects, and it was confirmed that none of control subjects had experienced sinusitis based on their history, physical examination, a plain sinus X-ray, and/or CT imaging. The viral detection rate in the control samples was also similar to that of asymptomatic control subjects in another study (37) . Thus, the different number of subjects in the case group and the heteroge-neous control group may not have confounded our findings. Second, the site of sample collection was a limitation in this study. Lavage samples were collected from the nasal cavity, whereas mucosal scrapings were taken from the inferior turbinate epithelia. Thus, both samples were not collected from the sinus mucosae. The previous study reported that no respiratory viruses were found in any sinus mucosa samples of CRS patients and normal subjects (38) . Therefore, it may be necessary to determine whether respiratory viruses invade the sinus mucosa to understand the relationship of CRS pathogenesis to respiratory viruses. Third, although enterovirus was detected in only a few CRS patients in the present study, it has potential cross-reactivity with rhinovirus in most PCR assay. However, cross-reactivity could be ignored in this study, because enterovirus contributes relatively little to URI in the immunocompetent subjects and sensitivity of Seeplex RV15 to the respiratory virus detection showed compatible with that of reverse transcriptase PCR (39, 40) .",

Of the various respiratory viruses, rhinovirus was by far the most prevalent virus and the only virus that has a significantly different detection rate in two groups. These results suggest that there may be strong associations between mucosal inflammation of CRS and respiratory viral infections, particularly rhinovirus infection. Further studies should investigate the etiologic role of high detection rate of respiratory viruses in CRS patients during symptomatic aggravation and ongoing mucosal inflammation.",
