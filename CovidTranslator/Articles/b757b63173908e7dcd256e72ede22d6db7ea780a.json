The overall incidence of transfusion-related sepsis (TRS) due to bacterial contamination of platelets is relatively high: in 3 recent surveillance studies, the death rates due to bacterial contamination of platelets were reported to range from 2 to 15 per million units with AP and 2 to 62 per million units with random-donor pooled platelet concentrates (PC).6-8 Pathogen inactivation treatment with the Intercept Blood System* (IBS) for platelets is a new technology aimed at enhancing the safety of platelet transfusions.

Transfusionacquired HCV or HBV outcomes were categorized into 4 groups: chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and fulminant hepatitis. Chronic hepatitis and fulminant hepatitis were assumed to occur in the year that transfusion was received. Cirrhosis and HCC onset were assumed to occur 15 years after transfusion. Adult T-cell leukemiallymphoma or HTLV-lassociated myelopathy was the subsequent outcome of transfusion-acquired HTLV-I, with a time to symptom onset of 3 years. Probabilities of developing the above disease outcomes were estimated from the literature (Table   11 ) 3, [6] [7] [8] 15, [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] [40] as were the quality-of-life impact and mortality estimates attributable to the subsequent outcomes of transfusion-acquired sequelae (Table III) . 15, 29, 31, 34, 38, [41] [42] [43] [44] [45] [46] [47] The cumulative death rate was used to reflect the impact of bacterial contamination. Several studies have reported the death rates per million due to bacteriacontaminated blood transfusion.6-8 The death rates per million for bacterial contamination were calculated as a weighted mean by sample size,7s which were 10 per million for AP and 17 per million for PC (Table 11 ). The Bacon study6 was excluded from these calculations because its risk underestimation was well recognized and its large sample size would bias the weighted mean. However, its data were used as the low bound in the sensitivity analysis to generate the most conservative estimate (2 deaths per million for both AP and PC). The data from a study from Johns Hopkins7 served as the high bound in the sensitivity analysis (15 and 62 deaths per million for AP and PC, respectively).",

For bacterially screened AP, the reduced mortality rate from bacterial contamination makes the incremental cost per QALY of IBS treatment in excess of $4 million for all patient populations at baseline. Corresponding figures for the transfusion of PC + IBS versus untreated PCs ranged from $457,586 (pediatric ALL) to $1,816,060 (NHL). Although seemingly high compared with the threshold ratios commonly used in other fields of medicine, such as $50,000 per QALY,64 these ICERs are comparable to previously reported cost-effectiveness findings of accepted blood safety interventions. For instance, a recent study by Jackson et a165 showed that the ICERs of whole-blood NAT for HIV, HCV, and HBV ranged from $4.7 to $11.2 million per QALY saved. Stone et al@ also found that blood safety interventions had a median ICER of $355,000 per QALY, with values ranging from cost-saving to $8.7 million per QALY. A graphic summary of the results of published cost-effectiveness analyses of safety interventions ( Figure  2 ) indicated that ICERs for blood safety and injury prevention measures were dominated by ratios higher than $100,000 per QALY.39,51,67-73 These findings suggest that the IBS is associated with ICERs comparable with those of other existing or proposed blood safety interventions that are highly valued by the public and policy makers. The risk of transfusion-transmitted infections due to currently screened pathogens is relatively small, but the continued addition of new tests such as NAT suggests that safety is still paramount in policy decision-making processes. , 74,75 Thus higher cost-effectiveness thresholds may apply in the evaluation of new blood safety technologies.",

            "text": "The results of the present analysis indicated that the IBS for platelets was relatively more cost-effective for pediatric ALL patients and orthopedic patients, followed by CABG and NHL patients. Overall, this finding reflected the favorable short-term prognosis of pediatric ALL and orthopedic patients, because mortality and quality of life after treatment were relatively similar to those expected for normal populations. The anticipated life expectancy of pediatric ALL patients was also greater due to their younger age at the time of transfusion. In contrast, the NHL and CABG patient populations were associated with relatively higher first-year posttreatment mortality rates, reducing the potential benefits of avoidance of transfusion-related infections. Sensitivity analysis indicated that the model results were not significantly affected by changes in viral-transmission risks for which testing is currently performed. The benefits of the IBS for platelets were driven by TRS mortality due to bacterial contamination of platelets. Currently, bacterial contamination remains the most frequent infectious complication associated with platelet transfusions. 6 Although the adoption of bacterial testing in the United States in the near future is expected to reduce the risk of bacterial contamination and TRS mortality, residual risks will remain due to the limitations of bacterial testing systems. 26, 27 In such circumstances, the benefit of the IBS would actually be substantially reduced (as shown in the baseline scenario 2). However, the concurrent use of pathogen inactivation and bacterial testing is very unlikely A generalized use of the IBS would probably omit the need for bacterial testing. 56 . The mortality from bacterial contamination was directly modeled in the current analysis without consideration for nonfatal outcomes. The rationale for such an approach is as follows: (1) Varying clinical definitions of transfusion reactions have led to a number of differing reports of TRS incidence, such as the incidence of sepsis, mild/severe septic reactions, bacterial contamination, bacteria-related events, transfusion reactions, and so on, all of which lack a clear consensus of the true incidence-however, the cumulative mortality rate per million units has been consistently used in the literature to estimate the impact of TRS; (2) rates for nonfatal reactions are often underestimated because of underrecognition and underreporting '(j; (3) the economic impact of septic reactions (mild or severe) due to bacterial contamination is minimal and may be neglected due to the rare occurrence; and (4) focusing on the critical effect of TRS-patient mortalitymay simplify, as well as clarify, the model. The mortality rate due to bacterial contamination has been reported in several well-known studies.6-s,77 A surveillance study in the United States found cumulative death rates of 2.2 and 1.9 per million for AP and PC, respectively, based on data for the years 1998 to 2000.6 However, as with other surveillance studies (eg, US Food and Drug Administration surveillance for bacterial safety\"), the fatality and incidence rates were underestimated because of limitations of surveillance study methodology 6,77 A study conducted in France8 with a matched casecontrol study design reported that the cumulative death rates with PC and AP were 0.0 (95% CI, 0.0-35.8) and 7.1 (95% CI, 0.8-25.6) per million. A study at Johns Hopkins' revealed that the cumulative death rates during the 12-year period (1987) (1988) (1989) (1990) (1991) (1992) (1993) (1994) (1995) (1996) (1997) (1998) were 15 per million for AP and 62 per million for PC. These rates were much higher than those from surveillance data,6,77 and may reflect the more aggressive ability of hospital-based studies to detect and report cases. Considering the limitations and strengths of each study, the death-per-million rates for bacterial contamination were conservatively calculated in our study as a weighted average by sample size 7,8. 10 per million for AP and 17 per million for PC. The Bacon study6 was excluded from these calculations because its underestimation was well recognized and the large sample size would bias the weighted average.",

However, inherent to the assumed benefit of use of platelets treated with the pathogen inactivation process is a level of uncertainty, and any benefit gained from the use of pathogen-inactivated platelets may be offset by the incidence of an unanticipated adverse event or any other treatment-related hazard.",

The major advantages of the IBS are the prevention of virus transmission, bacterial contamination, and emerging pathogens, and perhaps the avoidance of future screening tests as well. Blood banks, hospitals, and other institutions that administer platelet transfusions could consider the IBS for platelets a desirable strategy to increase the safety of platelet transfusions and a potential insurance against the threat of emerging pathogens.",
