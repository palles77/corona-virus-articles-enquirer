This paper answers a number of questions that humanitarian catastrophes generate: Why and how do the most-developed countries-those with the resources, capabilities, and willingness to help-intervene in specific types of disasters? What ethical and legal guidelines shape our interventions? How well do we achieve our goals? It then suggests a number of changes to improve humanitarian responses, including better NGO-government cooperation, increased research on the best disaster response methods, clarification of the criteria and roles for humanitarian (military) interventions, and development of post-2015 Millennium Development Goals with more accurate progress measures.

A form of political violence, war is intended, as Prussian military general and theoretician Carl von Clausewitz wrote, \"to compel our enemy to do our will.\" 9, 10 This form of politically motivated violence has occurred in every society's history. Its characteristics include extreme aggression, social disruption, and usually high mortality. 11 Genocide, often closely linked to war, is an attempt \"to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group.\" 12 Genocidal acts include \"killing members of the group; [and] causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group.\" 12 They also include deliberately inflicting \"conditions of life, calculated to bring about [a group's] physical destruction in whole or in part; imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group; [and] forcibly transferring children of the group to another group.\" 12 Decisions to use military interventions or threats to intervene to stop or prevent wars or genocide would seem to depend primarily on treaty obligations. As with natural disasters, however, intervention may also depend on the slant and intensity with which media cover the violence and a potential intervening nation's emotional investment and perceived ethnic ties to those involved. More pragmatically, the chance of intervention occurring also may depend on national and international political gamesmanship, the economic hardship due to supplying troops, and whether appropriate types and numbers of troops are available.",

These goals are: The MDGs originated with the Organisation [sic] for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), a group of the most-developed democratic countries devoted to a free-market economy. Primarily tasked with stimulating economic progress and world trade, the OECD formulated a strategic development framework for the entire world based on resolutions of international conferences and summit meetings. Further refining the resolutions at international meetings, the UN General Assembly approved most of their recommendations as MDGs in 2000. 26 While world pressure and an obligation to fulfill international promises have played a role in trying to meet the MDG objectives, the major impetus has been the availability of a large amount of money. Generally, non-governmental organizations (NGOs) are the \"boots on the ground\" that can make progress toward meeting the MDG objectives, and most NGOs follow the money. The UN, for example, now provides funds through its various arms to advance these goals, as do individual governments. Not only has specific aid been supplied by various countries, but affected countries have also been able to make more internal funding available. With backing from the G8 finance ministers in 2005, most of the world's major financial giants (e.g., World Bank, International Monetary Fund, and African Development Bank) cancelled up to $55 billion in debt owed by \"heavily indebted countries\" so that they could put the money into programs aligned with the MDGs.",

During armed conflict, the ICRC believes that it \"will be interpreted and applied in conformity with international humanitarian law.\" 35 A wide range of secular and non-secular humanitarian agencies that deal with assistance during conflicts, including the ICRC, helped develop the Sphere Project's Humanitarian Charter. Its purpose is to serve as an \"internationally recognized set of common principles and universal minimum standards in life-saving areas of humanitarian response.\" 36 In addition, individuals who participate in these groups bring their own personal and professional values that, presumably, mesh the ICRC and Sphere codes and those of the organizations with which they work. The World Medical Association (WMA) provides additional guidance for healthcare workers, saying they should \"ensure that the treatment of disaster survivors conforms to basic ethical tenets and is not influenced by other motivations.\" In addition, WMA reiterates a basic ethical triage principle, stating that they consider it ethical for the healthcare provider not to continue treating victims whom they cannot help, since they better can use the few available resources for many others in need. 1, 37, 38 ",
