However, multiple limitations, such as large size, complex structure and sensitivity to extreme ambient temperature potentially weaken the performance of mAbs in certain applications. To address this problem, the exploration of new antigen binders is extensively required in relation to improve the quality of current diagnostic platforms. In recent years, a new immunoglobulin-based protein, namely variable domain of new antigen receptor (VNAR) was discovered in sharks. Unlike conventional mAbs, several advantages of VNARs, include small size, better thermostability and peculiar paratope structure have attracted interest of researchers to further explore on it. This article aims to first present an overview of the shark VNARs and outline the characteristics as an outstanding new reagent for diagnostic and therapeutic applications.",

Nowadays, monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) have widely been used to detect biomarkers derived from various pathogenic diseases in various immunoassay platforms [1] . Unlike polyclonal antibodies (pAbs), the monospecificity and higher purity of mAbs have enabled them to perform in multiple applications, including evaluation of changes in molecular conformation, targeting protein-protein interactions, and identifying single members of protein families [2] . In terms of structure, antibody, also known as immunoglobulin (Ig), is a structurally complex, large hetero-tetrameric protein which is composed of two heavy chains and two light chains (Fig. 1A) . The heavy chain of a conventional IgG consists of three constant domains (CH1, CH2 and CH3) and a variable domain (VH), whereas the light chain consists of a constant domain (CL) and a variable domain (VL).",

Other than that, the degeneration of mAbs by high temperatures and humidity is the main factor affecting the sensitivity that could simply lead to false positive results in RDTs. Although many RDT devices are now kept well in sealed plastic packets to overcome humidity, the exposure to high ambient temperatures (45\u00b0C) can always lead to the deviation of RDTs performance [5, 6] . To ensure the optimum performance of RDTs in the field, the RDT devices are recommended to be stored at 4\u00b0C or below ambient. Unfortunately, the provision of refrigerated storage system to maintain the optimum performance of RDTs has always been a problem for many low-resources regions where electricity supply is not available [6, 7] . To overcome these circumstances, the exploration of new antigen binders with natural heat-stability is extensively needed for improving the current diagnostic platform.",

The subsequent recognition has shown the variable domains of these antibodies (camelids VHHs and sharks VNARs) contain autonomous function as single-domain antibodies. Owing to relatively small in size, high specificities for a cognate antigen, and high physiochemical stability, these naturally occurring antibody domains have been considered as promising candidates for biomedical development [10, 11] . Unlike conventional antibodies which have flat or concave antigen-binding sites, a wide variety of loop lengths and structures presented in VHH and VNAR have made them capable to access more cryptic epitopes and catalytic clefts of enzymes [12] [13] [14] . While the first VHH-based drug (anti-yWF caplacizumab) has already been approved [15, 16] , the current progress of VNARs may substantially render new perceptions and attitudes towards these molecules in the medical and scientific communities. Hence, this article aims to review the unique characteristics of shark VNAR, and to discuss the potential uses of shark VNAR in diagnostic as well as in therapeutic platform.",

IgNAR is a unique and unconventional antibody which has been identified in several different types of shark, including nurse sharks (Ginglymostoma cirratum), wobbegong sharks (Orectolobus maculatus), smooth dogfish (Mustelus canis), banded houndsharks (Triakiss cyllium) and horn sharks (Heterodontus francisci) [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] . Studies have also shown IgNAR plays a pivotal role in adaptive immune system of cartilaginous animals. The immunomicroscopic technique has exhibited IgNAR shares its structural homology with T-cell receptor variable regions, antibody VL chains, and cell adhesion molecules [8, 22] . Hence, the ability of demonstrating a possible common ancestral receptor molecule in IgNAR was postulated in that it has evolved and been recruited by immune system to function as antibody-like structures [23] [24] [25] . As shown in Fig. 1B , IgNAR exists in a homodimer that is naturally devoid of light chain. Each chain in IgNAR consists of five constant domains followed by one variable domain.",

            "text": "The variable domain of IgNAR, or referred to as VNAR, contains only two complementarity-determining regions (CDRs), as known as CDR1 and CDR3. Unlike conventional IgG, shark VNAR has been undergone evolution by compensating CDR2. Therefore, it allows the diversity of VNAR to be achieved by long variable protruding CDR3 with additional diversity evident in CDR1 and connected through two hypervariable regions (HV), which are HV2 and HV4. Moreover, the peculiar structure of CDR3 combined with supporting intermolecular disulphide bridging has conferred VNARs to form special paratopes that can access confined epitopes [13, [26] [27] [28] . Owing to the absence of CDR2, VNARs are thus far the smallest naturally occurring immunoglobulin-based protein scaffolds, with a molecular mass of about 12 kDa in animal kingdom [13] . With the presence of cysteine residues, the simple single chain structure of VNAR affords remarkable refolding properties after exposure to temperatures of up to 95\u00b0C, making them preferable in diagnostic applications where heating may temporally occur [29] .",

In view of amino acid content, Type III VNAR is very similar to Type II VNAR, with the addition of conserved tryptophan residue in CDR1. However, Type III VNAR possesses shorter CDR3 which are lacking in sequence diversity. This may partly be due to the D regions of shark genes being fused with V-gene in Type III [33] . It had been hypothesized that Type III VNAR is evolved to protect new-born sharks from early stage exposure to common pathogens or may involve in the development of immune system in adult sharks. This isotype is then quickly overtaken by the more mature class of VNAR [33] . Lastly, the Type IV VNAR or sometimes referred as Type IIb lacks non-canonical disulphide bonds that are found in other types of VNAR. Thus, the topology of the antigen-binding site of Type IV VNAR is more flexible [19, 25] .

In this cluster arrangement, each cluster consists of one V segment, one or more D segments, one J segment and one C segment. The single set of C segments are arranged exclusively by the activity of RAG recombinase within individual clusters [3] .

The mutational pattern and frequencies of this process are similar to that of mammalian antibodies, with a bias for transitions over transversions. This mechanism favours the serine codon AGC/T as a hotspot for mutations and majority of the changes are base replacements, which usually occur in tandem, especially in mutational hotspots and palindromic repeats [39] . Flajnik and colleagues reported somatic hypermutations that promote a gradual increase in affinity can occur after immunization, resulting in affinity maturation in vivo [10, 13, 18, 31, 40] . They showed that HV4 is prone to somatic mutations and may involve in antigen binding [31] . Mutations are also favoured in HV2 for Type I and in CDR1 for Type II [13, 41] .Therefore, it is postulated that these mutations could either directly contribute to antigen binding, or they change and stabilize the conformation of the CDR3 for antigen binding [31] .",

To isolate the target-specific clones, several display technologies such as phage display, ribosome display and yeast display have been performed elsewhere [20, 43, 44] . Of these approaches, phage display technology is the most popular and widely employed for the isolation of shark VNARs against target antigen. This technology allows phage phenotype and genotype physically linked whereby the displayed peptides or proteins are expressed in fusion with phage coat protein before undergoing a screening process known as biopanning [45] .In this technique, the genes encoding for antibody binding domains are fused to the bacteriophage's coat protein gene, resulting the antibodies can be displayed on the surface of bacteriophage for selection of antigen-recognizing binders [46] .The principle of phage display technology is illustrated in Fig. 3 .",

In 2007, Liu and co-workers successfully isolated VNARs targeting to cholera toxin, staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB), ricin and botulinum toxin A (BoNT/A) complex toxoid from na\u00efve and semi-synthetic libraries made from spiny dogfish (Squalus acanthias) [19, 49] .

The most common method is PCR amplification of antibody genes, followed by enzymatic digestion and ligation with phagemid vector. However, such method is time consuming, and may experience a low efficiency in the ligation and transformation step. Hence, a group of researchers had developed a library construction method based on PCR extension assembly followed by self-ligation (EASeL), which significantly shortened the time needed to construct the library [52] . Using this method, a large and highly diverse VNAR library derived from six antigen-na\u00efve nurse sharks (Ginglymostoma cirratum), with a library size of 10 10 has been recently generated. From this na\u00efve nurse shark VNAR library, a panel of VNAR binders that specific to cancer therapy-related antigens, which are glypican-3 (GPC3), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) and programmed cell death-1 (PD1) were isolated. Meanwhile, VNARs specific to viral antigens, such as the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) spike proteins were also isolated recently [52] . Therefore, the findings obtained herein have convinced where VNAR clones selected from the na\u00efve nurse shark VNAR library may potentially be developed as therapeutic antibodies after humanization process undertaken.",

It has been reported that the binding specificity of VNAR monovalent clone towards AMA1 was comparable to a range of commercially antibody reagents [54] . Griffiths and colleagues demonstrated that the thermostability of isolated VNAR was superior to that of conventional mAbs when targeting AMA1 in various format at 45\u00b0C. The refolding ability of VNAR was retained despite the temperature raised to 80\u00b0C. Furthermore, VNAR was proven to have long shelf-life after incubating at ambient temperature or 37\u00b0C for a month without losing any binding function [55] . In addition, Liu and colleagues examined the melting temperature and refolding capability of VNARs using fluorescence-based melting assay and circular dichroism. Similar to what have been observed in camelids, shark VNARs showed a wide range of melting temperature values from 42\u00b0C to 77\u00b0C, and capable to refold following heat denaturation [29] .

The causative agents of EHV include Bundibugyo ebolavirus, Sudan ebolavirus, Tai Forest ebolavirus and Zaire ebolavirus [56] [57] [58] . Goodchild and co-workers successfully isolated two VNARs (DSTL096 and DSTL097) from immunized phage display libraries that specific to nucleoprotein of Ebola virus [32, 50] . Further evaluation done by Anderson and co-workers confirmed that these two isolated VNARs had excellent binding affinity to nucleoprotein, but their melting temperatures were relatively low. Therefore, they employed CDR grafting technique combined with site directed mutagenesis to improve the stability of DSTL096 [32] . Using the framework of a VNAR (SP-15) which had been shown to possess good thermostability [29] , two derivatives of VNAR were constructed: One where CDRs 1 and 3 along with HV2 of DSTL096 were grafted onto the framework of SP-15 (SP15-096-123), and another in which only CDRs 1 and 3 were grafted (SP15-096-13). Results from dye-melt assay showed that SP15-096-123 had excellent affinity with low melting temperature, whereas SP15-096-13 had higher melting temperature with poor affinity. However, there were only three amino acid differences in the HV2 of these two VNAR proteins. Six single-and double-point mutants that covered the intermediates between these two clones were made in order to elucidate which of the three amino acids or combinations were responsible for the affinity and stability. They found that a single change in amino acid offered a~10\u00b0C improvement in melting temperature while maintaining the affinity. Therefore, this study suggested that HV2 can contribute to antigen binding and stability [32] .",

In their study, a range of antigen binding VNARs were selected after screening the randomized VNAR-CDR3 repertoires over three antigens as stated. Due to inferiority of binding affinity, the sub-libraries were undergone affinity maturation by randomizing CDR1 region in response to rapid isolation of targetspecific VNARs. As a result, the EpCAM-and HTRA1-binding VNAR clones isolated from the sub-libraries exhibited greater binding affinity compared to the clones that isolated from the initial library. From the outcomes, this work has proved where stepwise affinity optimization by first randomizing CDR3 and accumulating low affinity binders followed by diversification of CDR1 in this population of enriched variants could be a useful strategy to obtain VNARs with affinities in the low nanomolar range. To determine the thermostability, EpCAMbinding VNAR clones that were isolated from both initial library and sub-library were produced as soluble proteins and characterized through thermal shift assays. The results from the thermal shift assays showed that the EpCAM-binding VNAR clones exhibited high Tm values ranging from around 65\u00b0C to over 75\u00b0C, suggesting the target binders with high affinity can be generated in vitro without undermining the thermostability of the VNAR scaffold [44] .",

Therefore, it has become important to extensively investigate new binders with better stability from other biological sources using surface technology. The natural heavy-chain only antibody derived from sharks, known as VNAR, has been discovered in recent years. As highlighted in this review, shark VNAR can be superior to that of conventional antibodies in many aspects. One example is that the capability of VNAR to access cryptic and recessed epitopes which are usually not antigenic for conventional antibodies has made a breakthrough in medical research. In addition to smaller size and high solubility, the excellent thermostability is an advantageous property suggesting that this antibody can be applied in immunodiagnostics especially for the countries in tropical region. Since many new findings have been discovered in shark VNAR, the continuous efforts of research alliances may allow this heavy-chain only antibody to overcome the hindrance faced by corresponded diseases treatment in therapeutic platform.",
