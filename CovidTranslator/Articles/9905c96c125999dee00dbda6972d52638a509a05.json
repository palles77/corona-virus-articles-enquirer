Both of them formed a voltage independent ion conductive pore with symmetric ion transport properties. Mutations N15A and V25F located in the transmembrane domain prevented the ion conductivity. E protein derived channels showed no cation preference in non-charged lipid membranes, whereas they behaved as pores with mild cation selectivity in negatively-charged lipid membranes. The ion conductance was also controlled by the lipid composition of the membrane. Lipid charge also regulated the selectivity of a HCoV-229E E protein derived peptide. These results suggested that the lipids are functionally involved in E protein ion channel activity, forming a protein-lipid pore, a novel concept for CoV E protein ion channel entity.",

Several viral proteins, including the spike (S), envelope (E), and membrane (M) proteins are embedded within this lipid envelope.

In the case of SARS-CoV, proteins 3a, 6, 7a and 7b have also been identified in the viral membrane (Huang et al., 2006 (Huang et al., , 2007 Schaecher et al., 2007; Shen et al., 2005) .",

            "text": "CoV E protein is a small transmembrane protein of between 76 and 109 amino acids in length (Arbely et al., 2004; Raamsman et al., 2000) . E protein amino acid sequence is quite divergent among different CoVs, nevertheless its predicted structure is highly conserved and includes a short N-terminal amino acids stretch, an alpha helical transmembrane domain and a carboxy terminal region (Torres et al., 2007) . E protein is incorporated at a low copy number in the viral envelope (Maeda et al., 2001; Raamsman et al., 2000) . Nevertheless, high amounts of E protein are accumulated within cells during viral infection, suggesting an important role of this protein during virus cycle. CoV E protein mainly distributes between ER and Golgi apparatus membranes where it actively participates in virus budding, morphogenesis and trafficking (Corse and Machamer, 2000; Lim and Liu, 2001; Nal et al., 2005; Nguyen and Hogue, 1997; Raamsman et al., 2000; Ruch and Machamer, 2012a) . Particularly, SARS-CoV E protein mainly localizes in the endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) when expressed alone or during virus infection (Nieto-Torres et al., 2011) . It has been proposed that SARS-CoV E protein sequesters protein associated with lin seven 1 (PALS1), a member of the tight junctions complex, to the ERGIC, disrupting the epithelia and possibly contributing to the lung damage observed in SARS patients (Teoh et al., 2010) . The presence of SARS-CoV E protein at the cell plasma membrane has been previously suggested (Pervushin et al., 2009) , however, these results have not been confirmed in recent studies . CoV E protein self-associates forming an oligomeric structure that delimits an ion conductive pore in planar lipid bilayers and micelles (Pervushin et al., 2009; Torres et al., 2006; Wilson et al., 2006 Wilson et al., , 2004 . Synthetic CoV E proteins of human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E), mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), SARS-CoV and avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), behaved as cation-selective channels when they were reconstituted into planar lipid bilayers.",

However, the possible biological relevance of ion selectivity in different CoV E proteins requires additional studies. Other RNA viruses also encode small transmembrane proteins with ion channel properties. Influenza virus M2, hepatitis C virus p7, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) vpu, and poliovirus 2B proteins are some examples of a growing list of these virally encoded ion channels called viroporins (de Jong et al., 2006; Ewart et al., 1996; Pinto et al., 1992; Wozniak et al., 2010) .

Residues N15 and V25 were essential for SARS-CoV E protein ion channel activity. In all cases where the bilayer membrane was permeabilized, the channel showed symmetric ion transport properties either for positive or negative applied voltages, and its conductance was not regulated by voltage. Interestingly, when E protein was reconstituted in negatively charged lipid bilayers, the ion channel became slightly more selective to cations than to anions. The transmembrane domain of HCoV-229E E protein was also analyzed as a putative K \u00fe selective channel. A very weak selectivity for K \u00fe over Na \u00fe was observed for this peptide and its small preference for cations was also regulated by the charge of the lipid membranes, as was the case of SARS-CoV E protein. We propose that lipids are an integral component of the CoV E protein derived ion channels, a novel finding for these structures.",

In addition, conserved amino acids located within the E protein transmembrane domain of different CoV species were identified by sequence alignment (Fig. S1 , supplementary data). Using information from these sources, conserved polar amino acids located at the beginning and the end of the transmembrane domain, and conserved amino acids central to the CoV E protein transmembrane domain, which in many cases were tentatively located towards the lumen of the pore formed by SARS-CoV E protein, were mutated (Table 1 and Fig. 1) . A total of nine peptides derived from SARS-CoV E protein were synthesized, one of them (wt) representing the wild type protein transmembrane domain and its flanking polar amino acids, and eight mutant peptides including different residue substitutions. One (M2 to M7), two (M1) or four (M8) amino acids were replaced in each peptide at different positions along the transmembrane domain, or at both the amino-or carboxy-termini of this domain (Table 1 and Fig. 1 ).",

Single channel conductance was estimated from a statistical analysis of the current jump amplitudes, not from the total current measured. This procedure allows a reliable estimate of the most probable value of current change every time a new channel is inserted or disappears. Although several channels are being inserted, the magnitude of the current through a single channel could be discriminated. In order to exclude any peptidelipid or peptide-peptide electrostatic interactions previous to peptide insertion (Sani et al., 2012) , measurements were initially made in neutral lipid DPhPC bilayers. Six of the peptides investigated were able to permeabilize the phospholipid membrane. Wt as well as mutant peptides M1, M2, M5, M6 and M7 led to spontaneous current bursts 10-15 min after the peptide was added to the cis chamber ( Fig. 2A) . These results indicated that residues E7 and E8 (mutated in M1 peptide), T11 (mutated in M2 peptide), T30 (mutated in M5 peptide), T35 (mutated in M6 peptide) and R38 (mutated in M7 peptide) were not completely essential for the ion channel activity of SARS-CoV E protein derived peptides. M1, M5 and M7 peptides displayed conductance values similar to the wt peptide, suggesting that these mutations did not dramatically alter the pore conformation. Interestingly, mutations T11A (present in M2 peptide) and T35A (present in M6 peptide) led to currents of higher intensity than that induced by the wt peptide. In the absence of further structural information, we could speculate that these mutations may lead to a wider pore.",

            "text": "In contrast, three of the mutant peptides studied, M3, M4 and M8, did not permeabilize the bilayer (Fig. 2B ). In the case of M3, M4 and M8 peptides, which did not show spontaneous channel activity, a negative potential of increasing magnitude (up to 130 mV) was applied to check whether their insertion into the lipid membrane could be facilitated. However, no change in channel activity was found for these peptides by increasing voltage differences between chambers (data not shown). In order to ensure that mutants M3, M4 and M8 peptides did not display any ion channel activity, 0.5-1 ml of a 300 mg/ml solution of these synthetic peptides were added to the cis chamber and registers were made during 10-15 min. After this time, 0.5-1 ml of a 300 mg/ml solution were added successively and the process was repeated at least 15 times in order to check the absence of ion channel activity. No ion conductance was observed (data not shown), strongly suggesting that substitutions N15A (mutated in M3 and M8 peptides) and V25F (mutated in M4 peptide) totally inhibited SARS-CoV E ion channel activity. These data are in agreement with previously reported results using a peptide corresponding to the transmembrane domain of SARS-CoV E Circles over the alpha helices indicate the predicted location of the mutated amino acids. Red circles denote negatively charged polar amino acids; blue circles denote positively charged polar amino acids; orange circles correspond to uncharged polar amino acids; and green circles represent nonpolar amino acids. Capital letters in the alpha helix are used for the amino acids that have been substituted. The mutant and mutations columns on the right side show the mutant name and their corresponding substitutions. Numbers and letters in red show mutants and mutations, previously described as critical for ion channel activity (Torres et al., 2007) .

(C) Top view representation of a hypothetical pentameric E peptide ion channel. The position of the mutated amino acids within E monomers are shown in a plane perpendicular to the pore axis. protein flanked by two lysine residues (Torres et al., 2007) . Coronavirus E protein ion channel activity has been related with virus production and secretion (Ye and Hogue, 2007) . Modifications by alanine scanning insertion mutagenesis of the E protein transmembrane domain of mouse hepatitis coronavirus, resulted in mutant viruses which exhibited smaller plaque phenotypes, and their production was significantly reduced (between 10-and 100-fold). It is interesting to note that mutation of the SARS-CoV E protein amino acid N15 performed in our study, knocking down the ion channel activity, is equivalent to amino acid T16 of infectious bronchitis coronavirus (IBV) (Ruch and Machamer, 2012b) . This amino acid is essential for the disruption of the secretory pathway in IBV infected cells but has a limited effect on virus assembly as judged by virus-like particle production, suggesting that secretory pathway disruption and virus assembly are independent activities. In agreement with these results, introduction of amino acid substitutions N15A and V25F within the E protein of a recombinant SARS-CoV led to a slight reduction (lower than five-fold) of virus titers in cultured Vero E6 cells (data not shown). Extrapolation of these results, obtained with the two CoVs, could suggest that ion channel activity of E protein may be required to disrupt the secretory pathway during CoV infection but that it has low impact on virus titers in cells in culture. The introduced changes (single amino acid substitutions) had a lower effect on virus titers as compared with MHV E protein alanine insertion mutants reported in the work by Ye and Hogue (2007) , which probably had a higher impact on the structure of E protein and, as consequence, a significant effect on virus production. To further characterize the ion channel activity of wt-E peptide, current traces corresponding to 300 events were measured both in 1 M KCl and 1 M NaCl under an applied voltage of \u00fe100 mV ( Fig. 3A and B, respectively) . Histograms of the current jump amplitudes of the recorded traces showed that the most frequent events corresponded to single channel conductances of 0.3170.12 nS and 0.1870.12 nS in KCl and NaCl, respectively ( Fig. 3A and B , respectively, right panels) indicating that the peptide derived from SARS-CoV E protein transmembrane domain behaved as an ion channel either in KCl and NaCl solutions. These results almost matched the ones obtained using a full-length SARS-CoV E synthetic protein (0.3770.16 nS and 0.1970.06 nS for KCl and NaCl, respectively) (data not shown), further validating the use of the transmembrane domain derived peptides to measure the ion channel activity of SARS-CoV E protein. The conductance results obtained in KCl and NaCl solutions showed no enhanced selectivity of E protein for K \u00fe than for Na \u00fe . Indeed, the higher conductance shown for KCl ( $1.7 times larger than in NaCl) in Fig. 3A is due to the intrinsic properties of these electrolytes, as the mobility of K \u00fe is 1.66 times higher than the mobility of Na \u00fe . Interestingly, a few current jump amplitudes were observed in 1 M KCl with values multiple of the most frequent current step of 31 pA (18% of these currents to double and 10% to triple) (Fig. 3A, right panel) . In NaCl solutions, these events were rare, as jump amplitudes double or triple of the most frequent one were only 5% and 3%, respectively (Fig. 3B , right panel). These results suggested that high conductance states could be actually originated by occasional simultaneous insertion of two or three channels rather than by wider independent structures.",

Single channel current-voltage (I-V) curves (Fig. 4) exhibited an ohmic behavior and therefore, a voltage independent conductance. The linear intensity to voltage (I-V) relationship revealed that the number of current carriers did not depend on the direction of the applied voltage difference and, therefore, the channel displayed symmetric ion transport properties when positive or negative voltage differences were applied. These results indicated that SARS-CoV E protein ion channel activity was not regulated by the applied electric potential. This constitutes a distinctive trend at odds with other channel forming peptides like alamethicin (Hall et al., 1984) or syringomycin E (Malev et al., 2002) , which display voltage dependent current that has been linked to the existence of several conformational states. The fact that SARS-CoV wt-E peptide exhibited the same conductance regardless of the applied voltage discards the existence of voltage-induced dynamical structures and provides some support to the hypothesis that the variety of high conductance states found in Fig. 3A and B were actually originated by clusters of small structures and not by different conformational states.",

The histograms of the wt-E peptide channel conductance in pure DPhPS membranes point to a single channel conductance of 0.1570.01 nS in 1 M KCl (Fig. 5) . The comparison with Fig. 3A indicates that the host lipid not only determines the width of the conductance histograms but also the single channel conductance. Thus, the distribution of current jump amplitudes for the wt-E peptide in DPhPS charged membranes was much narrower than in neutral DPhPC membranes, suggesting that simultaneous multi-channel insertions were rare events when the peptide was reconstituted in DPhPS. But more important is the fact that the wt-E peptide channel conductance in a negatively charged lipid is less than half the value in a neutral membrane. This cannot be explained exclusively by the electrostatic interactions arising from the surface charge of the lipid membrane. The accumulation of ions near the pore entrance due to the membrane surface charge should give just the opposite effect, i.e., greater channel conductance in DPhPS, as occurs in alamethicin (Aguilella et al., 2011) . Our results suggest that lipids are much more than inert scaffolds but they are functionally involved in the channel formation so that the observed dependence of wt-E channel conductance on the lipid type could be associated to the existence of different conformations in such a way that the aqueous pore in DPhPS membranes is narrower than in DPhPC membranes. Therefore, we can reasonably hypothesize that wt-E peptides induce permeabilization changes in membranes via the formation of protein-lipid pores, and lipid polar heads line totally or partially the pore wall together with several peptide monomers.",

In planar membranes of neutral lipid DPhPC the native E peptide channel permeability ratios were P \u00fe /P \u00c0 \u00bc 0.6 70.1 for NaCl and P \u00fe /P \u00c0 \u00bc170.1 for KCl (Table 2 , first row). The interpretation of these permeability ratios must take into account that P \u00fe /P \u00c0 is a joint measure of the channel discrimination between ions with different charge (electrostatic exclusion or accumulation) and the electrolyte intrinsic properties (difference between cation and anion mobility). This means that in a hypothetical neutral pore devoid of any interaction, the corresponding cation/anion permeability ratios, which represent the ratio of the diffusion coefficients in a free solution, should be P \u00fe /P \u00c0 $0.5 for NaCl and P \u00fe /P \u00c0 $ 1 for KCl. Thus, the calculated P \u00fe /P \u00c0 ratios in the first row of Table 2 offer two interesting conclusions. On one hand, the wt-E peptide induced channels in DPhPC bilayers behaved almost like a neutral pore because they did not discriminate cations over anions. On the other hand, the observed differences between P \u00fe /P \u00c0 ratios for NaCl or KCl in the first row of Table 2 reflects the different mobility of Na \u00fe and K \u00fe , indicating that the channel has no specificity for Na \u00fe or K \u00fe (Alcaraz et al., 2009) .",

However, it is important to note that in those experiments, E transmembrane peptide was inserted in a lipid mixture with a 20% of a negatively charged lipid, instead of the neutral lipid bilayer used in the above reported experiments (Table 2, first row). Having in mind the crucial role that the lipid has on the channel conductance (compare Figs. 3A and 5), new series of reversal potential measurements were performed using a lipid mixture of DPhPC (neutral lipid): DPhPS (negatively charged lipid) (4:1) so as to mimic the lipid membrane charge density used by Wilson et al. (2004) . In these charged membranes, permeability ratios were P \u00fe /P \u00c0 \u00bc1.470.1 for NaCl and P \u00fe /P \u00c0 \u00bc 2.770.1 for KCl (Table 2 , second row), showing that the ion channel was between two and three-fold more permeable to cations (Na \u00fe and K \u00fe ) than in the neutral lipid bilayer. Higher percentages of DPhPS within the lipid bilayer, further increased permeability ratios for NaCl and KCl, being P \u00fe /P \u00c0 \u00bc2.0 70.2 for NaCl and P \u00fe /P \u00c0 \u00bc3.970.5 for KCl in 50% DPhPS membranes, and P \u00fe /P \u00c0 \u00bc3.870.7 for NaCl and P \u00fe /P \u00c0 \u00bc6.6 70.9 for KCl in 100% DPhPS membranes (Table 2), indicating that the channel permeability was between three-and four-fold higher to Na \u00fe and K \u00fe than to Cl \u00c0 ions in 50% DPhPS membranes and between six and seven times more permeable to Na \u00fe and K \u00fe than to Cl \u00c0 ions in 100% DPhPS membranes (Table 2, last row). Overall, these data showed that the charge of the lipid modulated the ionic selectivity of the peptide channel. Equivalent results were obtained with the full-length SARS-CoV E protein (Table 3) .

To further study if the influence of the artificial membrane polarity on the ion channel activity is a general issue for other CoV E proteins, we measured the selectivity of channels formed by a synthetic peptide having the same amino acid sequence than the transmembrane domain of HCoV-229E E protein in neutral lipid membranes (Table 4) . Permeability ratios (P \u00fe /P \u00c0 ) were 1.170.1 for NaCl and 2.5 70.3 for KCl, indicating that the channel formed by HCoV-229E E protein was more permeable to cations than to anions in DPhPC. In addition to its mild cationic selectivity, the channel showed a slight preference for K \u00fe over Na \u00fe ions. In experiments with membranes formed by negatively charged DPhPS, the channel cationic selectivity increased up to a P \u00fe /P \u00c0 ratio of 3.1 70.2 for NaCl and 6.270.9 for KCl, also showing a slight preference for K \u00fe over Na \u00fe (Table 4) .

We want to stress again (as done above in the discussion of Fig. 3A and B) that these small differences between E rev measured in KCl and NaCl are only due to the electrolyte intrinsic properties (ion mobility). Actually, the difference between the E rev values of columns 2 and 4 (Tables 2 and 3) is very close to 11.3 mV, which corresponds to the difference between NaCl and KCl diffusion potentials for a 10fold concentration ratio in free solution (Alcaraz et al., 2009) . Even in HCoV-229E E peptide where the difference between E rev for KCl and NaCl seems a bit larger, the preference for K \u00fe over Na \u00fe is not significant at all (a factor 2.3-2.7, depending on the lipid charge) as shown in Table 4 . Furthermore, it is worth to mention that the permeability ratios obtained here are very far from the values usually associated to specific selectivity. In the channel literature (Aguilella et al., 2011) , to consider that a channel is specific to a certain ion, the permeability to other ions should be extremely low. For instance, potassium channels have a permeability ratio for K \u00fe over Na \u00fe 4100:1 and calcium channels select for Ca 2 \u00fe over Na \u00fe with a ratio 41000:1.",

Mutations N15A and V25F disrupt this ion conductive property of the E protein transmembrane peptide. Interestingly, SARS-CoV E and HCoV-229E E protein derived peptide, when reconstituted in lipid membranes, behaved as ion channels with an activity highly influenced by the charge of the lipids. Marked differences in conductance and E rev were observed for E protein ion channels depending on whether they were formed in neutral or charged lipid bilayers. Due to lipid head charge repulsion, lipids may change their spacing within a membrane. Therefore, in principle, we could not completely exclude that the lipid charge could have affected the structure of the pore and, as a consequence, its conductance. The results previously described, showed that channel conductance in fully negatively charged lipids (DPhPS) was much smaller than in neutral lipids (DPhPC). These results are consistent with a more tight arrangement of helices in the pore induced by a higher lipid lateral pressure. However, such a conformation (narrower pore) does not seem sufficient to explain the increased channel selectivity in membranes containing charged lipids (from \u00fe2 mV in DPhPC to \u00c0 36 mV in DPhPS for KCl in the case of SARS-CoV E protein derived peptide; from \u00c0 6 mV in DPhPC to \u00c0 43 mV in DPhPS for KCl in the case of fulllength SARS-CoV E protein; and from \u00c0 19 mV in DPhPC to \u00c0 35 mV in DPhPS for KCl in the case of HCoV-229E E protein derived peptide). The combined evidence from conductance and selectivity measurements is the basis of our suggestion that the pore is made both of peptide helices and lipid head groups. Most likely, lipid molecules assembled with the peptide oligomers, to form the channel, similarly to what has been described for ascecropin, magainin and dermaseptin channels (Oren and Shai, 1998) . The reported oligomeric structure of the E protein based on NMR data (Pervushin et al., 2009) suggests that E derived channel is essentially different from a classical barrel-stave model where peptides are tightly assembled in parallel, defining a regular open pore. Indeed, E peptides self associate with a certain slope, defining an irregular pore with a clear constriction in the middle. This type of structure seems compatible with the insertion of lipid head groups within the wider domains of the oligomer. This functional involvement of lipids in the channel structure can be accomplished in different ways as it happens with antimicrobial peptides (Eleftheriou et al., 2009) . In one of them, the toroidal pore structure represents a membrane-spanning pore lined with polar peptide surfaces as well as phospholipid head groups.",

Indeed, when using lipids inducing negative curvature of membranes like phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), the probability of channel formation is lowered because the membrane positive curvature needed for proteolipidic pores becomes energetically unfavorable. To reinforce the concept of CoV E protein derived channel as a protein-lipid entity, ion channel activity of SARS-CoV E transmembrane peptide was measured in membranes containing PE and different amounts of negatively charged lipid PS. Two types of membranes were reconstituted: (i) membrane 1 (PE:PC:PS, 3:1:1), and (ii) membrane 2 (PE:PC:PS, 3:3:1). Channel insertion was significantly diminished under these conditions and amounts of peptide 10-to 15-fold higher than those used in PC or PC:PS membranes were needed to detect channel activity (data not shown). These data confirmed that E protein most likely formed a protein-lipid pore. It is noteworthy that even under these conditions, P \u00fe /P \u00c0 values were 3.370.2 and 2.370.2 for membrane 1 (20% negatively charged lipids) and membrane 2 (14% negatively charged lipids), respectively, which revealed that, as previously shown for PC:PS membranes, lipid charge influenced Table 4 Reversal potential measured for HCoV-229E E protein derived peptide in planar bilayer membranes with different lipid composition under a 10-fold concentration gradient.",

The peptides were cleaved from the resin with trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) and purified by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). To this end, lyophilized peptides were dissolved in isopropanol and acetonitrile (3:2, v/v) at a final peptide concentration of $ 5 mg/ml, and injected into a Zorbax SB-C18 9.4 mm \u00c2 250 mm column (Agilent) equilibrated with H 2 O. Peptide elution was performed using a Waters 600 HPLC system and three solvents: A (94.9% H 2 O, 5% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid), B (94.9% acetonitrile, 5% H 2 O, 0.1% trifluroacetic acid) and C (94.9% isopropanol, 5% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid). The elution process started with 80% solvent A, 8% of solvent B and 12% of solvent C following a linear gradient to reach after 30 min a mixture of 40% solvent B and 60% solvent C. Finally, a gradient ending with a composition of 20% solvent B and 80% solvent C after 40 min was performed. The resulting fractions were pooled and lyophilized. Peptide purity was confirmed by mass spectrometry.",

Lipids were added on 70-90-mm diameter orifices in the 15-mm-thick Teflon partition that separated two identical chambers (Bezrukov and Vodyanoy, 1993; Montal and Mueller, 1972) . The orifices were pretreated with a 1% solution of hexadecane in pentane. Aqueous solutions of KCl and NaCl were buffered with 5 mM HEPES at pH 6. All measurements were performed at room temperature (2371 1C). Ion channel insertion was achieved by adding 0.5-1 ml of a 300 mg/ml solution of synthetic protein or peptides in the buffer containing acetonitrile:isopropanol (40:60) on one side of the chamber (hereafter referred to as cis side).",

The potential was defined as positive when it was higher on the side of the peptide addition (cis side), whereas the trans side was set to ground. An Axopatch 200B amplifier (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) in the voltage-clamp mode was used to measure the current and the applied potential. The chamber and the head stage were isolated from external noise sources with a double metal screen (Amuneal Manufacturing Corp., Philadelphia, PA). The single-channel conductance was obtained from current measurements under an applied potential of \u00fe100 mV in symmetrical salt solutions of 1 M KCl and NaCl buffered with 5 mM HEPES at pH 6. The conductance values were evaluated using the Gaussian fit tool of Sigma Plot 10.0 (Systat Software, Inc). The reversal potential, E rev , was obtained as follows. First, a lipid membrane was formed at a given salt concentration gradient. Second, one or several channels were inserted into the bilayer and a net ionic current appeared due to the concentration gradient. Third, the ionic current through the channel was manually set to zero by adjusting the applied potential. The potential needed to achieve zero current was then corrected by the liquid junction potentials of the electrode salt bridges (Alcaraz et al., 2009 ) to obtain the E rev . The measured E rev was converted into the channel permeability (P \u00fe /P \u00c0 ) by means of the Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz (GHK) (Hodgkin and Katz, 1949) ",
