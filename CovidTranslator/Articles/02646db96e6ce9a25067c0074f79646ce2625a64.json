            "text": "Probiotic lactic acid bacteria (LAB) have been shown to alleviate inflammation, enhance the immunogenicity of rotavirus vaccines, or reduce the severity of rotavirus diarrhoea. Although the mechanisms are not clear, the differential Th1/Th2/Th3-driving capacities and modulating effects on cytokine production of different LAB strains may be the key. Our goal was to delineate the influence of combining two probiotic strains L. acidophilus and L. reuteri on the development of cytokine responses in neonatal gnotobiotic pigs infected with human rotavirus (HRV). We demonstrated that HRV alone, or HRV plus LAB, but not LAB alone, initiated serum cytokine responses, as indicated by significantly higher concentrations of IFN-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b3, IL-12, and IL-10 at post-inoculation day (PID) 2 in the HRV only and LAB+HRV+ pigs compared to LAB only and LAB-HRV-pigs. Peak cytokine responses coincided with the peak of HRV replication. LAB further enhanced the Th1 and Th2 cytokine responses to HRV infection as indicated by significantly higher concentrations of IL-12, IFN-\u03b3, IL-4 and IL-10 in the LAB+HRV+ pigs compared to the LAB-HRV+ pigs. The LAB+HRV+ pigs maintained relatively constant concentrations of TGF-\u03b2 compared to the HRV only group which had a significant increase at PID 2 and decrease at PID 7, suggesting a regulatory role of LAB in maintaining gut homeostasis. At PID 28, cytokine secreting cell (CSC) responses, measured by ELISpot, showed increased Th1 (IL-12, IFN-\u03b3) CSC numbers in the LAB+HRV+ and LAB-HRV+ groups compared to LAB only and LAB-HRV-pigs, with significantly increased IL-12 CSCs in spleen and PBMCs and IFN-\u03b3 CSCs in spleen of the LAB+HRV+ group. Thus, HRV infection alone, but not LAB alone was effective in inducing cytokine responses but LAB significantly enhanced both Th1 and Th2 cytokines in HRV-infected pigs. LAB may also help to maintain immunological homeostasis during HRV infection by regulating TGF-\u03b2 production.",

            "text": "Lactobacilli are natural inhabitants of the gastrointestinal microflora of most humans and also pigs. Many Lactobacillus spp have been tested for the prevention or treatment of a variety of pathological conditions. Metchnikoff was the first to propose in 1908 that lacticacid-producing bacteria (LAB) could be used to prevent diarrhoea and intestinal diseases when introduced in the diet (Mercenier et al., 2003) . LAB, mostly Lactobacillus spp., replicates within the human gastrointestinal tract and generates lactase (Marteau et al., 1990) . This enzyme facilitates the digestion of lactose present in milk and decreases the symptoms of malabsorption, which usually accompany acute infectious diarrhoea. L. rhamnosus GG has been reported in many clinical studies to reduce the severity and duration of rotavirus (RV) diarrhoea in children (Guarino et al., 1997; Isolauri et al., 1991; Rosenfeldt et al., 2002) . L. acidophilus NCFM mixed with L. reuteri and Bifidobacterium infantis BBI also significantly decreased the duration and incidence of rotavirus diarrhoea in children 12-32 months of age (Sanders and Klaenhammer, 2001) . Possible mechanisms for the therapeutic effects of probiotics include the production of inhibitory substances, blocking of adhesion sites, competition for nutrients, and stimulation of the immune system (Rolfe, 2000) . To date, no single probiotic strain possesses all of these qualities or properties, which is why mixed cultures of probiotics are frequently used in therapeutic treatments (Isolauri et al., 2002) . Because of the complexity of the gastrointestinal ecosystem of commensals within which biotherapeutic agents interact and also because different probiotic strains mixtures may interact with each other, it is not always possible to predict the effect of an LAB mixture based on functional characteristics of individual LAB strains. We choose to study the effects of the mixture of L. acidophilus and L. reuteri because L. acidophilus is commercially available in fermented foods and in dietary supplements in the US since the mid-1970s (Sanders and Klaenhammer, 2001) . L. acidophilus is known to stimulate innate and adaptive immune responses (Konstantinov et al., 2008; Liu et al., 2010; Zhang et al., 2008b) . In vitro studies have shown that L. acidophilus is a strong inducer of Th1 cytokine (IL-12, IFN-\u03b3) (Gackowska et al., 2006; Zeuthen et al., 2006) and it is involved in the up-regulation of dendritic cells surface markers such as HLA-DR, CD40, CD86 and CD83 (Zeuthen et al., 2006) . L. reuteri has anti-inflammatory effects through increasing CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ T cells (Karimi et al., 2009) . L. reuteri has also been shown to activate human DCs and promoted Th1 cytokine IL-12, IL-18 and IFN-\u03b3 production (Mohamadzadeh et al., 2005) . Furthermore, both strains have been reported to reduce the risk, severity and duration of rotavirus diarrhea (Van Niel et al., 2002; Shornikova et al., 1997) , although the mechanisms are undefined.",

            "text": "Both lactobacilli strains were previously evaluated for their colonization pattern in gnotobiotic pigs and similar results were reported (Glass, 2003) . Because studies using combination of probiotics predict synergism or additive effects on a mixture (Timmerman et al., 2007) , we hypothesized a mixture of L. acidophilus and L. reuteri would achieve better immune stimulating effects than monoassociated probiotics. Thus, we used a mixture of L. reuteri and L. acidophilus (LA+LR) in our earlier study as we attempted to achieve optimal immunomodulating effects, i.e. to reduce RV diarrhoea and at the same time to enhance immune responses to RV infection. However, the mixture of LA+LR did not confer protection against RV diarrhoea in gnotobiotic pigs although immunostimulatory and regulatory effects on total B cell, dendritic cell (DC) and macrophage, \u03b3\u03b4 T cell and toll-like receptor responses in the RV-infected pigs were evident (Wen et al., 2009; Wen et al., 2011; Zhang et al., 2008a; Zhang et al., 2008c) . The goal of the current study was to evaluate the immunomodulating effects of the mixture of LA+LR on cytokine responses in RV-infected gnotobiotic pigs, because cytokines play important roles in RV pathogenesis and immunity. In vitro studies have shown that different LAB strains induce different cytokine responses in DCs (Christensen et al., 2002; Zeuthen et al., 2006) and epithelial cells (Liu et al., 2010) . Different cytokines, in turn, contribute to distinct functions in the induction of antiviral cytotoxic T cells (by Th1 cytokines), isotype-specific B cell responses and mucosal IgA (by Th2 cytokines), and regulatory T helper (Treg) cells (by Treg cytokines). Th2 cytokines promote the maturation and activation of B cells; transforming growth factor (TGF)-\u03b2 acts synergistically with Th2 cytokines to stimulate B cells to switch from IgM to IgA antibody secreting cells (Simecka, 1998) . TGF-\u03b2 is secreted by Treg cells and has multiple suppressive actions on T and B cells, macrophages, and other cell types and can directly suppress Th1, Th2 and Th17 immune responses (Hong et al., 2011; Weiner, 2001) . We compared cytokine profiles, kinetics, and duration of proinflammatory, Th1, Th2 and Treg cytokine responses in serum, intestinal contents and intestinal and systemic lymphoid tissues of gnotobiotic pigs after infection with a virulent human RV (VirHRV) (mimic natural infection) in the presence or absence of LA+LR colonisation. There are few in vivo studies of cytokines in either humans or animals in association with probiotic LAB or following HRV exposure, and most studies focused on cytokines in blood and not at the local site of colonisation or infection, the gut.",

HRV infection or LA+LR colonisation slightly elevated proinflammatory cytokine IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 levels compared to the mock-inoculated control pigs; however LA+LR colonisation did not alter serum IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 levels in HRV infected pigs. Levels of IFN-\u03b1 and IL-12 cytokine concentrations in HRV alone and LAB+HRV+ pigs were significantly elevated at PID 2 compared to the LAB alone and mock control pigs. The IL-12 concentrations in the LAB+HRV+ pigs remained significantly higher until PID 21 compared to all the other groups. The IFN-\u03b3 concentrations in the LAB+HRV+ and HRV alone pigs were significantly higher than those in the LAB alone and control pigs, indicating that HRV infection effectively activated Th1 type responses in neonatal gnotobiotic pigs with or without bacterial gut colonisation. However, LA+LR enhanced the Th1 cytokine responses to HRV infection, as indicated by significantly higher IFN-\u03b3 (5-fold) and higher IL-12 (1.5-fold) concentrations at PID 2 in the serum of LAB+HRV+ pigs than those of the LAB-HRV+ pigs. Interesting to note, pigs in all four groups had similar mean levels of TGF-\u03b2 at 2 days of age (ranging from 155-194 pg/ml, data not shown). After two doses of LA+LR feeding (3 and 5 days of age), pigs in the LAB alone and HRV alone groups had significantly elevated concentrations of TGF-\u03b2 compared to the pigs in the LAB+HRV+ and LAB-HRV-groups that remained the same (157-161 pg/ml) on PID 0 (6 days of age). After HRV infection at PID 7, the HRV alone pigs had the lowest mean TGF-\u03b2 concentration. Although TGF-\u03b2 concentrations in pigs of both HRV+ groups decreased significantly at PID 7 compared to pigs in the LAB alone and the control groups that had similar TGF-\u03b2 levels at PID 0 and PID 7, TGF-\u03b2 concentrations in the LAB+HRV+ pigs were significantly higher than the HRV alone pigs. Thus, LA+LR colonized and HRV infected pigs maintained relatively higher TGF-\u03b2 levels during HRV infection, suggesting a regulatory role for LA+LR in the Th3 responses to HRV infection. At PID 10 and 21, the TGF-\u03b2 levels in both HRV+ groups recovered to similar levels as the LAB alone and control groups (Figure 1) . However, at PID 28, the TGF-\u03b2 concentrations in both HRV+ groups declined and became again significantly lower than the LAB alone and control pigs, coinciding with the establishment of the Th1 type response in the two groups of HRV infected pigs.",

There were no significant differences in the cytokine concentrations between the LAB +HRV+ and LAB-HRV+ pigs. Because most of the cytokines are not stable in the gastrointestinal lumen due to pH and enzymatic activity as we reported previously (Azevedo et al., 2006) , variability of cytokine concentrations in intestinal contents is high and it may not be a good indicator of immune status in the gut. Therefore we also studied cytokine secreting cell responses in the small intestinal site (ileum) and the systemic sites (spleen and blood) at PID 28, to better understand the influence of LA+LR colonisation and HRV infection on the cytokine milieu in the gut.",

The role of cytokines in RV disease and protection is currently under investigation. Our previous studies of serum cytokine profiles of neonatal gnotobiotic pigs showed that HRV induced high Th1 (IL-12 and IFN-\u03b3) cytokine responses acutely after HRV infection and proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6) that correlated with the peak of diarrhoea and viremia (Azevedo et al., 2006) . Likewise, TNF-\u03b1 has been associated with the severity of RV diarrhoea in children (Jiang et al., 2003) , possibly due to its ability to induce increased Cl \u2212 secretion by intestinal epithelial cells (Kandil et al., 1994) . Stimulation of adult human blood MNC by HRV induced IL-2 and IFN-\u03b3 secretion which augmented NK cell activity and other forms of non-specific CTL activity (Yasukawa et al., 1990) . Because pro-inflammatory and Th1 cytokines coincide with the peak of HRV diarrhoea in non-colonised pigs, and colonised pigs had lower pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-\u03b1, IL-6) than non-colonised HRV infected pigs (based on CSC, Figure 3 ), upregulation and induction of anti-inflammatory Treg cytokines may be essential to curtail or moderate HRV diarrhoea. LAB may help to maintain the immunological homeostasis during HRV infection by promoting production of regulatory cytokines. Furthermore, in the absence of LAB colonisation, IL-10 CSC numbers were significantly increased in the gut of LAB-HRV+ compared to LAB+HRV+, which may be an alternate mechanism to maintain gut homeostasis.",

Failure of the LA+LR mixture to reduce HRV diarrhoea in gnotobiotic pigs may be due to the following. The interval between colonisation and HRV infection (2 days) was too short to induce gut immune maturation and to restore homeostasis; the LAB strains chosen were ineffective in stimulating gut repair (Boirivant and Strober, 2007) ; and the regions colonised or concentrations were not optimal to influence HRV infection and diarrhoea. It is also likely that the different immune modulating effect of L. acidophilus (immunostimulatory) antagonized the anti-inflammatory effect of L. reuteri when used together. In vitro studies showed that combining IFN-\u03b3inducing and non-inducing LAB completely abrogates DC-mediated IFN-\u03b3 production by NK cells (Fink et al., 2007) . Combining a weakly IL-12 and TNF-\u03b1 inducing LAB (L. reuteri DSM12246) with a strongly IL-12 and TNF-\u03b1 inducing LAB (L. acidophilus X37) inhibited the IL-12 and TNF-\u03b1-inducing capacity of L. acidophilus X37 in DCs (Zeuthen et al., 2006) . Therefore mixing LAB with opposite immune modulating effects may have weakened the effect of each individual LAB strain. These findings in vitro and in vivo have important implications in selecting LAB strains to be used in a mixture of probiotics for therapeutic or immunostimulating purposes.",
