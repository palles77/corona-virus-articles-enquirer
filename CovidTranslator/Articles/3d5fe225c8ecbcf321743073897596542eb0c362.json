A lymphoproliferative assay was developed in which mononuclear cells isolated from lymphoid tissues at different postinoculation and postchallenge days underwent a secondary in vitro stimulation with semipurified antigen obtained from PEDV-infected cell cultures. Vigorous lymphocyte proliferative responses were detected in the pigs inoculated with the virulent PEDV at postinoculation days 4-21, especially in the mesenteric lymph nodes and the blood; however, in the spleen this response was lower and less regular. The pigs inoculated with the attenuated virus showed a less intense response, the higher lymphocyte proliferation also corresponded to the mononuclear cells from mesenteric lymph nodes. Lymphocyte proliferation responses showed high correlations with protection against homologous challenge with virulent PEDV, and this correlation was higher in the gut associated lymphoid tissues (mesenteric lymph nodes). The cell proliferation response detected in blood mirrored that detected in the mesenteric lymph nodes, and showed also good correlation with protection. The results confirm that T-cell-helper function, assessed by lymphocyte proliferation responses, contributes to establishing a protective immune response against PEDV infections.",

Although morbidity is high and most of the animals in the herd can be affected within a week, mortality is usually low in adult animals (3%), which can recover in 7-10 days. However, when piglets less than 4-5 weeks are infected, mortality is usually 50% and can reach 90% in severe outbreaks, as usually happens in transmissible gastroenteritis. Besides the mortality, PEDV infection causes important economic loses due to the diminishing of the productive indexes (Pensaert, 1999) .",

This minor response of group 2 also corresponded to a low response of PEDV-specific antibody-secreting cells (De Arriba et al., 2001b) . The difference observed between the lymphoproliferative responses of the two inoculated groups has also been described by other researchers (Brim et al., , 1995 Ward et al., 1996) in other gastroenteric viruses of swine, describing that the lymphocyte proliferative responses induced by attenuated strains of transmissible gastroenteritis and rotavirus were significantly lower than that induced by the homologous virulent virus.",

The specific cell proliferation response in the blood was more similar to that observed in the mesenteric lymph nodes than in the spleen, especially in the group 1, in spite of both, blood and spleen, being linked to the systemic immune system. However, the blood, together with the lymphatic system, is the main vehicle for lymphocyte migration (Salmi and Jalkanen, 1997) , and its lymphoid population may reflect primed T cells migrating to the gut for some time after an infection.",
