The patient was transferred to another facility, where she was intubated for a worsening mental status. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was suggestive of ADEM or vasculitis for which she received five days of intravenous methylprednisolone and intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG). She was also treated for possible encephalitis or meningitis with acyclovir, ceftriaxone and vancomycin. Her cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cultures did not grow any microorganisms and the patient did not show clinical improvement following antimicrobial therapy. The patient did not have any history of recent vaccinations. After a week from the initial presentation, she was transferred to our hospital where plasma exchange therapy was started due to failure of pulse dose steroids and IVIG for possible ADEM or vasculitis.",

Patients commonly present with ADEM following viral infection or post vaccination and less frequently post bacterial infection caused by Mycoplasma, Chlamydia, Legionella, Campylobacter and Streptococcus [4] . Initially patients present with prodromal symptoms such as fever, malaise, myalgia, headache, or nausea and vomiting. Encephalopathic signs including restlessness, lethargy, hallucination, confusion and altered sensorium usually begin 4-21 days after prodromal symptoms. In addition, focal or multifocal neurological signs such as hemiparesis, paraparesis, cranial nerve palsies can also manifest [5, 6] . Since our patient was initially treated in two different hospitals, there were no details available on how rapidly her prodromal symptoms transformed into neurological manifestations. She did, however, definitively present with encephalopathic signs within a week of fever and influenza-like manifestations. Several case reports have described immune-mediated demyelination following a non-specific upper respiratory tract infection in which M. pneumoniae was detected by PCR in respiratory samples but not in CSF. A few reports document patients with encephalitis in the absence of respiratory symptoms and detected M. pneumoniae in CSF but not in respiratory samples [7] . It is important to rule out other possible etiologies including CNS disorders, infectious and non-infectious (vasculitis, multiple sclerosis) diseases. Extensive investigations were done to evaluate the etiology behind our patient's condition. Subsequently, her serology testing for M. pneumoniae IgM antibody was elevated and respiratory PCR for M. pneumoniae was positive. The criteria for diagnosis of M. pneumoniae infection included detection of M. pneumoniae by culture or PCR in respiratory or CSF samples or positive serological testing.",

            "text": "The current treatment of ADEM due to Mycoplasma pneumoniae is based on limited case reports. No controlled clinical trials or recommendations are available for optimal management. The literature suggests benefits from immune-modulating therapy, with intravenous methylprednisolone (20-30 mg/kg/day, maximum 1gm/day) for 3-5 days, followed by tapered oral corticosteroids over 4-6 weeks [11, 12] . Poor responders to pulse dose steroids are treated with IVIG at 2 g/kg divided over 2-5 days or undergo plasmapheresis. ADEM is assumed to be immune-mediated and antibodies to the microorganism have already been produced [3] . In our patient, CSF encephalitis and meningitis PCR panel was negative for M. pneumoniae which supports the immune-mediated pathogenesis [13, 14] . Our patient poorly responded to intravenous steroid therapy and IVIG, while she markedly improved on plasmapheresis. It becomes tough to justify why she responded to plasmapheresis and showed therapeutic failure to both pulse dose steroids and IVIG. The decision making becomes more challenging as to when and what treatment modality should be given. Furthermore, antimicrobial therapy directed against Mycoplasma pneumoniae was appropriate for our patient as the respiratory PCR panel was positive for M. pneumoniae. But, the therapeutic impact of antimicrobial agents like erythromycin, azithromycin, doxycycline or fluoroquinolone, is questionable. The use of antimicrobials that do not penetrate the blood-brain barrier remains uncertain with few cases having neurological recovery without antibacterial therapy and some patients having temporary clinical improvement with such therapy. However, antibacterials should be continued irrespective of prodromal or neurological manifestations until more evidence becomes available [7] .",
