[9] [10] [11] It is estimated that among the nearly fifty percent of the world's population living in regions putting them at risk for dengue infection, there are approximately 100 million cases annually. In this edition of Disease A Month, among the mosquito borne illnesses we will discuss, dengue will be covered in depth, with updates and an overview of other important similarly transmitted infections that clinicians will want to become more aware of, such as Zika, malaria, and Chikungunya virus (CHIKV). Although significant media attention, and public health efforts were given to Zika, especially during the recent Olympics in Brazil, CHIKV continues to express a wide geographic distribution, 18 has resulted in over 2.5 million cases, and is well established in the Americas. Although the number of Yellow Fever cases is declining, the virus continues to cause human illness, in spite of vaccines. Of concern, vectors (mosquitoes) capable of spreading these and other illnesses can survive and thrive in North America, including many states within the United States, as will be discussed in this edition of Disease-a-Month.",

Contributing to this is the fact that the tick (Ixodes scapularis) that is capable of spreading Lyme Disease, can also spread Babesiosis, Anaplasmosis, and Borrelia mayonii (also causative of Lyme pattern of disease). [19] [20] [21] [22] Of note many of us were trained in an era when the arachnid vector for Lyme Disease was considered near exclusively to be \"the deer tick\" -Ixodes dammini. Ticks (Ixodes) also have wide geographic distribution, and there are many capable of transmitting a wide range of pathogens that cause human and animal illnesses across North America. Some of these will also be discussed in this edition. Of concern, pathogens may be expanding their range of transmission capability; for example Lyme was initially thought to be relegated to the deer tick primarily. That has changed, and once considered limited to one or two tick vectors, is now spread more widely. [19] [20] [21] [22] Not surprisingly, one of the most important tick borne illnesses we will discuss is Lyme disease, [19] [20] [21] [22] which continues to pose significant diagnostic and therapeutic challenges to patients, and health care providers. It remains an underappreciated epidemic in the United States. Of concern is the growing geographic distribution of ticks across North America, including ones capable of transmitting Lyme disease, resulting in rising numbers of persons afflicted. And, in spite of continued research in Lyme disease, this tick borne illness continues to present clinical challenges. Lyme Disease will be the primary focus of tick borne illness for this edition of Disease a Month, but others will be discussed so that the clinician can consider other similarly transmitted infections. Just as malaria is not the only mosquito borne illness capable of sickening humans, including travelersvacationers, businesspersons, and the military, Lyme is not the only tick borne illness our patients can experience from a tick bite.",

[1] [2] [3] Where once infectious diseases were leading health care concerns, these have been largely replaced by cardiovascular disease and cancer. Because of our location, significant public health resources and medical infrastructure, along with wide spread immunizations against a broad array of pathogens, the United States (US) has been fortunately isolated from many infectious diseases, that typically cause much suffering for other regions of the globe, with the notable exception of tuberculosis (TB), HIV/AIDS, Lyme, West Nile, pneumonia, and influenza related illness, as well as hospital acquired infections. That notwithstanding, for a large proportion of the planet, infectious diseases remain the leading causes of death, disability, in some cases preventable blindness 25, 26 and other serious sequellae. But with widespread travelnearly a billion people travelled through airports and other transportation hubsalong with dramatic growth in imported agriculture and other products, land and sea borders no longer provide the significant protections they once did, and North America now faces the potential for a resurgence in infections.

To be sure there are a variety of intermediaries that allow pathogens to invade their ultimate hostsoften humans. Owing to the significant increase in arbovirus and other infections globally, with dramatic expansion into North America, it seems prudent to focus on Emerging Pathogens -Vector Borne Illnesses in this edition of Disease-A-Month, especially on mosquito and tick borne illnesses in general, and some of the most problematic pathogens in each category.",

This will allow us to better care for such patients, along with reducing the risk of outbreaks. Moreover we must continue with the progress gained in the aftermath of the recent Ebola outbreak, in terms of improved awareness of international travel among our patients; this includes Americans as returning vacationers, military, and business travelers who have been to regions where a wide array of infectious diseases persist. Not to put too fine a point on this but in 2015 over 1.2 billion persons represented tourist arrivals in all countries. Depending upon destination site, between 22 and 64% of travelers report some form of illness, and a not insignificant percent will not seek pretravel health consultation. [39] [40] [41] Malaria remains a concern in travelers returning to their countries of origin. 39 Billions of people worldwide are exposed to important and emerging infectious diseases, some of which will visit North America, [39] [40] [41] it is important that we provide greater training to our health care professionals. Studies suggest suboptimal diagnosis in travel related illness patients upon initial presentation to treating sources. 42, 43 Consequently, it is our hope that this edition of Disease-a-Month will be a useful component in training about and preparedness for such emerging pathogens.",
