Three mixing ventilation methods, which are widely used in current bus configurations, and an alternative displacement ventilation method were numerically assessed in terms of their ability to limit the risk of airborne influenza infection. Furthermore, both the non air-recirculation and airrecirculation with filtration ventilation modes were investigated in terms of the influenza infection probability. According to the simulation results, air-recirculation mode with high efficiency filtration was found to cause almost the same infection risk as non air-recirculation mode (100% outdoor air supply), which indicated a potential benefit of filtration in reducing the infection risk. Additionally, for the commonly used mixing ventilation methods, air distribution method, location of return/exhaust opening and seat arrangement affected the airborne transmission of influenza between passengers. The displacement ventilation method was found to be more effective in limiting the risk of airborne infection. Overall, the developed numerical model can provide insights into how the micro-environmental conditions affect airborne infection transmission in buses. This numerical model can assist in developing effective control strategies related to airborne transmitted diseases for other frequently used public transportation systems, such as trains and airplanes.",

For example, the H1N1 pandemic spread rapidly around the world and caused as of July, 2010 over 18,366 deaths [1] with its full impact remained to be seen. Therefore, there is a need to further study and understand the transmission of airborne infectious diseases in indoor environments, especially in microenvironments with high occupant density such as the public transportation means (e.g. buses, trains, airplanes).",

Bus systems are a popular mean of public transportation around the world [7] . A number of studies on bus microenvironments have reported serious indoor environment quality (IEQ) problems with many indoor pollutants at higher concentration levels than outdoors. A Hong Kong-based field study found that CO 2 concentration levels could be up to 10 times higher than outdoor concentrations under overcrowded conditions in the bus system [7] . Similarly, a field study in Boston, MA (USA) found that CO 2 concentration levels were elevated and greatly affected by occupancy rates [8] , which is an indication of insufficient ventilation in the bus microenvironments. The insufficient ventilation and overcrowded conditions in the bus microenvironments, which unfortunately are the norm in many cities around the world, may increase the risk of airborne transmission of various infectious diseases. Therefore, alternate control strategies need to be developed and employed in order to protect the public from airborne transmitted infectious diseases.",

This minimal and localized effect of outdoor air inflow can be attributed to the great air exchange rate of 57.6 ACH (no air recirculation), which shows the capability to restore the bus microenvironment soon after the interruptions of the bus microenvironmental conditions.

In all other ventilation scenarios, the probability of an airborne infection for these four passengers varied from 0.05% to 10.1%. It is worth pointing out that if the susceptible passenger is seated between the infector and the air return/exhaust opening, then the risk increased. Fig. 9(a), (b) , (c), and (d) show the probabilities for each of the standing passengers (P27, P28, P29 and P30) to get infected by any other passenger in the bus. Similarly to the seated passengers described above, the displacement ventilation method (Scenario #4) was found to be a better control strategy in terms of limiting the risk of airborne infection for the standing passengers. In all other ventilation scenarios, the \"air mixing\" influenced significantly the risk for airborne infection. In Scenario #3, P9's exhaled infectious particles caused an infection probability as high as 22% for passenger P27. Similarly, P8's exhaled infectious particles caused a greater infection probability of 27.2% for passenger P28. These findings indicate that the standing passengers in the front compartment have higher risks of getting infected due to the fact that they were in the highly turbulent mixing zone of the cabin. Furthermore, the location of the air return/exhaust opening influenced the risk of airborne infection for the passengers standing in the rear compartment.",

This is a quite important finding in terms of the ventilation method employed by the bus manufacturers. Most bus manufacturers use only a single air return/exhaust opening located either in the middle of the ceiling or the back wall (scenarios #1, 2 and 3). It is quite obvious that these methods are not the most efficient methods in terms of minimizing the contact of the people from emitted bio-aerosols. This is in line with the results from the previous field studies [7, 8] which linked the lack of proper ventilation in bus microenvironments as well as the ventilation methods to increased risks for airborne transmission of infectious diseases. On the contrary, the displacement ventilation method (Scenario #4) minimizes the air mixing in the cabin and reduces the contact of the exhaled bio-aerosols with the rest of the passengers, resulting in lower infection risks for the passengers.",

The air recirculation mode is justifiably adopted in practice to reduce the energy consumption for maintaining thermal comfort in the buses. However, the air recirculation is also considered to be a factor in the airborne transmission of diseases. This finding supports the hypothesis that installing filtration systems in current buses that use air recirculation may be an effective control strategy to minimizing the risk of airborne infection induced by air recirculation.

These micro-environmental conditions result from the air distribution method, location of air return/exhaust opening, air recirculation and filtration. The developed numerical model was successfully applied to a popular mean of public transportation, to study the risk of airborne infection of influenza and develop effective control strategies for this unique bus microenvironment. The developed model can help public health professionals to further develop effective strategies in terms of controlling airborne transmitted diseases in many other microenvironments such as trains and airplanes. It becomes apparent from the results that the current bus ventilation methods are problematic in terms of their ability to limit the risk of an airborne infection, so alternate ventilation strategies such as displacement ventilation method may be implemented by the manufacturers. Another control strategy that may help to minimize the exposure of the public to airborne infectious viruses while using public transportation systems is the use of filtration systems. We plan to further use the developed numerical model to investigate other important public transportation microenvironments and come up with effective control strategies that can protect the public from airborne transmission of infectious diseases.
