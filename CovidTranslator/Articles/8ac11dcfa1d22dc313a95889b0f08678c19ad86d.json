A recent analysis by Hess has pointed out a possible exception to this: when infectious disease is present, migration may promote disease spread and therefore increase local extinction. We extend Hess's model to discuss this problem: when infections have spilled over from more abundant alternative hosts. This is often the case for species of conservation concern, and we find that Hess's conclusions must be substantially modified. We use deterministic analytic and stochastic numerical approaches to show that movement between patches will rarely have a negative impact, even when the probability of external infection is low.",

Infectious disease represents a serious extinction risk to threatened species, having the capacity to cause populations to crash suddenly, as well as slowing their recovery from perturbations (Woodroffe 1999) . Using a metapopulation model, Hess (1996) showed that, by facilitating the spread of disease between subpopulations, migration could increase the probability of metapopulation extinction and reduce patch occupancy. We believe that this conclusion is likely to be misleading for many wild populations and demonstrate the reason in a simple modification of Hess's model. The analytic model developed by Hess assumes that susceptible subpopulations become infected only by receiving immigrants from elsewhere within the metapopulation (Hess 1996) . By contrast, most of the infections that have threatened wildlife populations with extinction have 'spilled over' from other, more abundant hosts (table 1; Woodroffe 1999; McCallum & Dobson 1995) . We have modelled this phenomenon by altering the Hess model, to include a background force of infection. Our intention is not to evaluate the likelihood of such a spillover, but to explore the relationship between within-population migration rates and disease in those populations for which spillover occurs.",

When g = 0 (i.e. in the Hess model) and for some range of g, occupancy rates initially increase with migration rate, then decrease as infection becomes established and a greater proportion of patches experience the higher extinction rates associated with infection. Eventually, occupancy increases once more, as all patches become infected and migration acts only to promote host population persistence. It is the nonmonotonicity of this curve that underlies Hess's con- Table 1 . Examples of wildlife populations which have been threatened by infectious disease. The majority of cases involve generalist pathogens which have apparently 'spilled over' from other, more abundant, host species. Note that a welldocumented case of infection transmitted between populations by translocation (Castle & Christensen 1990 ) involved a pathogen believed to cause only subclinical infections, which are likely to have little or no effect upon population viability. threatened host pathogen impact of pathogen probable source references African wild dog rabies population extinction domestic dogs Gascoyne et al.

Possible events and corresponding rates for the model. This reduces to the analytic model of Hess (1996) clusion that encouraging migration between patches may increase, rather than decrease, the probability of metapopulation extinction. This non-monotonicity is continued for a range of g. For greater values of g we see an entirely monotonic curve meaning that increasing movement rates only increases occupancy in this model. To gain some sense of the magnitude of the critical value of g, we define \u2440 to be (1 \u03ea x S /x I ). This is the expected reduction in patch persistence time that occurs when infection is present. We find our curve becomes monotonic at g = x S \u2440 2 /(1 \u03ea \u2440 2 ) in terms of this new parameter. To give an example, suppose that the disease reduces the life expectancy of a patch by one-third; under these conditions the occupancy fraction is monotonic whenever the chance of external infection is greater than one-eighth of the chance of extinction for a susceptible Proc. R. Soc. Lond. B (2002) patch. These spontaneous extinction rates are typically low and our analysis indicates that critical rates of external infection are an order of magnitude still smaller. Thus, the negative effects of increasing movement rates on patch occupancy are eliminated in parameter ranges possibly encountered in natural systems.",

The results from the stochastic model broadly support the conclusions of the deterministic approach, demonstrating in figure 2 the non-monotonicity in m at low g, which fades out to leave a monotonic curve for g around the critical value of g, calculated from the deterministic model.

If alternative hosts occur primarily outside reserves (as would be expected if reservoir hosts are domestic species), then corridors might increase contact between host species by increasing the reserves' perimeter-area ratios. Such 'edge effects' would compound other extinction risks associated with exposure to reserve borders (Woodroffe & Ginsberg 1998) . This possibility might be investigated by adding an external force of infection to the spatially explicit simulations proposed by Hess (1996) . Our analyses emphasize the need for conservation managers to take an ecological approach to disease control, involving the management of reservoir as well as threatened host species (Woodroffe 1999) .",
