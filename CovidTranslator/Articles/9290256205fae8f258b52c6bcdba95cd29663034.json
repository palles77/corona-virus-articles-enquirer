            "text": "Secondary immunodeficiency syndromes constitute a wide array of non-gastrointestinal disorders. The gastrointestinal complications of these disorders often follow a common theme, with patients being at significant risk for infections of the gastrointestinal tract. In addition, cellular changes in the gastrointestinal tract (the largest immune organ in the body), malabsorption, peptic disorders and dysmotility are other problems faced by these children. Worldwide, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) infection and malnutrition are by far the most common secondary immunodeficiency states. However, in the USA and other developed countries, HIV-1 disease has come under excellent control with the advent of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), resulting in a decreased incidence of gastrointestinal complications. Nevertheless, review of the gastrointestinal complications of HIV-1 disease in children is important, as HIV-1 is prevalent worldwide and serves as a model for complications of other secondary immunodeficiency states.",

            "text": "The first cases of the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) were described in the early 1980s. Later in 1984, 1 HIV-1 was determined to be the causative agent, and HIV-1 infection was recognized as a spectrum of disease, ranging from asymptomatic infection to full-blown AIDS. The AIDS epidemic claimed an estimated 3 million lives in 2004, and an estimated 5 million people acquired HIV-1 in 2004, bringing to 40 million the estimated number of people globally living with the virus. 1a With the successful preventive strategies of elective cesarian section delivery and chemoprophylaxis of pregnant HIV-1infected women, the transmission rates plummeted from 15-30% to less than 2% of all HIV-1-infected women delivering infants. 2 Furthermore, with the advent of HAART in 1996, the natural history of HIV-1 in children in developed countries has altered markedly. 3 However, the successes of prevention and prophylaxis have not been realized in developing countries, where HIV infection continues to increase. Thus there are grave implications for children, especially in some developing nations, where more than 25% of the women are infected with HIV-1 and therapeutic options for pregnant women at this time are limited. 4 HIV-1 is an RNA virus that belongs to the lentivirus family. It has a particular tropism for the CD4 surface antigen of cells, and the binding of HIV-1 to the CD4 receptor initiates the viral cycle. The virus may subsequently replicate within the host cell or, alternatively, the proviral DNA within the host cells may remain latent until cellular activation occurs. Human T lymphocytes and monocytesmacrophages are the primary cells that are infected with HIV-1, although other cell lines may be infected as well. The net effect is suppression of the immune system and a progressive decline in CD4+ T lymphocytes, which leaves patients susceptible to opportunistic and recurrent bacterial infections.",

In vertical transmission, HIV-1 is found in the gastrointestinal tract after the fetus swallows infected amniotic fluid, blood, cervical secretions or breast milk. Virus, inoculated in the gastrointestinal tract, infects the fetus as it enters into the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) through the tonsil or upper intestinal tract. The rates of acquisition of HIV-1 through the gastrointestinal tract are likely related to the quantity of virus in the person transmitting it [5] [6] [7] and the immunologic function and maturity of the patient being infected. Mucosal infections with opportunistic infections may increase HIV-1 transmission. Mycobacterial infections upregulate CC chemokine recptor 5 (CCR5) expression in monocytes, which facilitates the entry of CCR5-tropic HIV-1.",

            "text": "Other factors, such as tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), which is induced by nuclear factor (NF)-\u03baB (which itself is pathogen induced), are potent inducers of HIV-1. 8, 9 Cellular routes that potentially can transmit HIV-1 across the gastrointestinal tract include M cells, dendritic cells and epithelial cells. M cells are specialized epithelial cells that overlay the Peyer's patches and transport large macromolecules and micro-organisms from the apical surface to the basolateral surface. Human transport of HIV-1 by M cells in vivo has not been reported. Dendritic cells bind HIV-1 through a specific dendritic cell-specific adhension molecule. In vitro studies support the role of dendritic cells in transmitting HIV-1; [10] [11] [12] [13] however, the role of the dendritic cell in in vivo transmission of HIV-1 has yet to be determined. Epithelial cells express CCR5 and can selectively transfer CCR5-tropic HIV-1. The epithelial cell can transport HIV-1 in vitro from the apical to the basolateral surface. 14, 15 The R5-tropic viruses are transferred in vitro through epithelial cell lines. 16 Once transmitted, the lamina propria lymphocytes express CCR5 and CXC4 chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4), which support HIV-1 replication. 17, 18 Early after infection there is a greater proportion of infected lymphocytes in the lamina propria than in peripheral blood. 19, 20 The lymphocytes are able to disseminate the virus to distant sites, with depletion of CD4 cells in the lamina propria 19, 21 and then in the blood. As mucosal and peripheral T cells are depleted, monocytes and macrophages become important reservoirs for the virus. The intestinal macrophages do not promote inflammation and do not carry the receptor for CCR5 or CXCR4; however, the blood monocytes are different in their profile and are infected by HIV-1. They are found infected in the blood and thereafter take up residence in the gut. 22 They are stimulated by opportunistic agents and proinflammatory cytokines. 23 Villous atrophy and gastrointestinal tract dysfunction are coincident with high levels of HIV-1 viral load in the gut. 24 A dysfunctional gastrointestinal tract can produce significant clinical symptoms that contribute to both morbidity and mortality in children with HIV-1 infection. These symptoms include weight loss, vomiting, diarrhea and malabsorption (Table 39 .1).",

            "text": "As reviewed above, there are distinct changes in the cellular milieu of the gastrointestinal tract in HIV-1-infected patients. Previous studies have shown that activated mucosal T cells play a role in the pathogenesis of enteropathy in the human small intestine 25 and can affect the morphology of the villi and crypts in a manner similar to that seen in patients with HIV-1 infection. Recently the magnitude of viral burden in the gastrointestinal tract has been associated with villous blunting and other abnormal morphology. 24 A number of studies in the 1980s associated a distinct enteropathy with HIV-1. This was first described by Kotler et al., 26 who studied 12 homosexual men with HIV-1 and controls. Seven of the patients had diarrhea, weight loss, an abnormally low D-xylose absorption and steatorrhea, without evidence of intestinal infection. Jejunal and rectal biopsies were obtained in all patients with diarrhea. Jejunal biopsies showed partial villous atrophy with crypt hyperplasia and increased numbers of intraepithelial lymphocytes. This was the first histologic description of a specific pathologic process that occurred in the lamina propria of the small intestine in some patients with HIV-1. Ullrich et al. 27 also defined small intestinal structure in adult patients with HIV-1. Microscopically, he found low-grade small bowel atrophy and maturational defects of enterocytes in 45 HIV-1-infected patients. These findings also support an HIV-1 enteropathy, characterized by mucosal atrophy with hyporegeneration. However, some investiga-tors have challenged this concept, suggesting the findings could be attributed to an undiagnosed enteric infection.",

            "text": "In order to link the altered morphology with abnormal intestinal function, Bjarnason et al. 29 studied intestinal inflammation and ileal structure and function in patients with a wide spectrum of HIV-1 disease states. HIV-1infected patients who were minimally symptomatic had normal intestinal absorption and permeability, yet had increasing gastrointestinal dysfunction as they progressed to AIDS. Malabsorption of bile acids and vitamin B 12 did not correlate with morphometric analysis of ileal biopsies and were unremarkable in these patients. Thus, there was significant mucosal dysfunction with only minor ileal morphologic changes. Malabsorption of bile acids may play a pathologic role in patients with AIDS diarrhea. The absorptive defect of AIDS enteropathy using a D-xylose kinetic model of proximal absorption was studied, 30 There were minimal histologic abnormalities in both the proximal and distal biopsy sites in patients with diarrhea and no enteric infection. D-Xylose absorption was low, and the absorptive defect was more severe and greater than would be expected from the histologic abnormalities found. Thus, these findings support other studies that showed little association between histologic characteristics of the small bowel and its absorptive function in patients with HIV-1 infection. Most studies do not support a direct role for gastrointestinal malabsorption on growth failure or weight loss. Ullrich et al. 27 described gastrointestinal malabsorption in HIV-1-infected patients who had low levels of lactase enzyme in the brush border, crypt death, decreased villous surface area and decreased mitotic figures per crypt when compared with control patients. In addition, Keating et al. 31 described absorptive capacity and intestinal permeability in HIV-1-infected patients. Malabsorption was prevalent in all groups of patients with AIDS, but was not as common in the asymptomatic HIV-1-infected patients. Malabsorption correlated significantly with the degree of immune suppression and with body mass index. There were mild decreases in the jejunal villous height to crypt depth ratio, yet not as severe as the subtotal villous atrophy found in celiac disease. Lim et al. 32 found disaccharidase activity to decrease proportionately with increasing HIV-1 disease severity, although there was no association between disaccharidase levels and weight loss. In addition, Mosavi et al. 33 found no correlation between diarrhea and weight loss in HIV-1-positive patients. More recently, Taylor et al. 34 found mild histologic changes accompanied by severe disaccharidase abnormalities; however, symptoms were severe enough to withdraw lactose in only 25% of the patients. Collectively these studies suggest that gastrointestinal malabsorption may be present, but is not always associated with weight loss and diarrhea.",

Sentongo et al. 38 evaluated fat malabsorption and pancreatic exocrine insufficiency using fecal elastase-1 enzyme assay in 44 HIV-1-infected children. Hormone-stimulated pancreatic function testing and 72-h stool and dietary fat sample collection were performed in children with abnormal fecal elastase levels. The prevalence of steatorrhea was 39% and that of pancreatic insufficiency was 0% (95% confidence interval 0-9%). There were no associations between steatorrhea and pancreatic insufficiency, growth, HIV-1 RNA viral load, CD4 status or type of antiretroviral therapy. Others studies support the absence of association. 39 Thus, the clinical significance of steatorrhea in pediatric HIV-1, similar to absorption of other nutrients, is unclear.",

Viral load in the intestinal tract may be considerably higher than that measured peripherally, and this can also affect mucosal gastrointestinal structure and function. Studies suggesting these hypotheses include that of Kotler et al. 41 which looked at intestinal mucosal inflammation in 74 HIV-1-infected individuals. These authors found abnormal histopathology in 69% of the patients, and this finding was associated with altered bowel habits. High tissue P24 antigen levels were observed, and these correlated with more advanced HIV-1 disease. Tissue P24 detection was associated with both abnormal bowel habits and mucosal histology. The tissue content of cytokines, including TNF, \u03b1-interferon and interleukin-1\u03b2, were higher in HIV-1-infected individuals than in controls, and these increases were independent of intestinal infection. Thus, HIV-1 reactivation in the intestinal mucosa could be associated with an inflammatory bowel-like syndrome in the absence of other enteric pathogens.",

Diagnosis is confirmed by endoscopy and biopsy. The histologic appearance of CMV-infected cells is quite unique (Fig. 39.1 ). These cells are enlarged and contain intranuclear and cytoplasmic inclusion bodies. The nuclear inclusion bodies are acidophilic and are often surrounded by a halo. Cytoplasm inclusion bodies are multiple, granular and often basophilic. Cells that are dying may appear smaller and smudged, with poorly defined inclusion bodies. Staining for CMV antigen shows that many of the infected cells are endothelial cells with others being perivascular mesenchymal cells. CMV can cause vasculitis because of its target cell population. Thus, the spread of CMV occurs with circulating infected endothelial cells. Treatment options are outlined in Table 39 .2.

They looked for enteric viruses identified by electron microscopy of fecal specimens. Small round structured viruses (SRSVs) were found more frequently in HIV-1-infected children than in uninfected children with chronic diarrhea. Rotavirus and coronavirus-like particles were not associated with HIV-1 infection. These authors considered that these SRSVs may be associated with HIV-1 infection and could lead to chronic diarrhea in Tanzanian children.",

Small bowel bacterial overgrowth was not a common finding in a group of 32 HIV-1-infected patients, regardless of the presence of diarrhea, and it was not associated with hypochlorhydria. 44 Lactose hydrogen breath testing has shown high baseline readings in children that may indirectly suggest bacterial overgrowth of the small intestinal tract. 35 Detection of bacterial overgrowth in the small bowel is usually performed by quantitative duodenal aspirate for bacterial culture, with therapy directed at treating the organisms, which are often anaerobic. these organisms occurs more frequently in immunocompromised patients. The decline in the incidence of infections with these bacterial pathogens in developed countries has been linked to the improved immunity associated with HAART. However, combined morbidity and mortality rates associated with HIV-1 and these bacterial pathogens in developing countries approach 50% in some studies. 61 HIV-1-infected patients with Campylobacter infection have higher rates of bacteremia than the general population. Deaths from sepsis due to this organism have been reported in severely immunodeficient patients with AIDS, despite HAART. 62 Colitis from C. difficile is also more common in the immunosuppressed population owing to chronic antibiotic use and impaired immune system. 63 Pulvirenti et al. 64 studied 161 HIV-1-infected patients with C. difficile and found that they had longer hospital stays and more admissions than patients without C. difficile infection, as well as other opportunistic infections such as herpes virus. They found C. difficile-associated diarrhea in 32% of all study patients with diarrhea. However, infection with C. difficile appeared to have little impact on morbidity or mortality. In a 1998, New York state screening study 65 of hospitalized HIV-1-infected patients in the HAART era, 2.8% were admitted with a diarrheal diagnosis, with 51.3% of these having a C. difficile infection. Thus, even with HAART, diarrhea is prevalent and is often associated with identifiable pathogens. Because of the serious complications that are associated with active bacterial enteric infections in immunodeficient children, treatment options are outlined in Table 39 .2.",

The most common clinical manifestations of gastrointestinal infections with MAC include fever, weight loss, malabsorption and diarrhea. Intestinal obstruction, resulting from lymph node involvement and intussusception, terminal ileitis, which resembles Crohn's disease, and refractory gastric ulcers are often found. Severe gastrointestinal hemorrhage has also been described. 70 Endoscopically, fine white nodules may be seen in the duodenum, or the duodenal mucosa may look velvety and grayish in appearance. Segments of the gastrointestinal tract can become infected with MAC. Histologically, there is a diffuse histiocytic infiltrate in the lamina propria with blunting of the small intestinal villi. These histiocytic infiltrates can be recognized on hematoxylin and eosin staining and on acid-fast stains, and are pathognomonic for infection ( Fig. 39.2) .

Similar findings were documented by Kotler et al., 77 who showed adherent bacteria in 17% of all adult patients with AIDS. The infection was localized primarily to the cecum and right colon, and three distinct histopathologic patterns of adherence observed: attachment on effacing lesions, bacteria intercalated between microvilli, and aggregates of bacteria more loosely attached to the damaged epithelium. The bacterial cultures of frozen rectal biopsies yielded E. coli in 12 of the 18 patients. These findings suggest that chronic infection with adherent bacteria can also produce the syndrome of AIDS-associated diarrhea.

It became an important cause of chronic diarrhea, leading to high morbidity and mortality rates in immunocompromised patients. To date, no effective chemotherapy is available. With the introduction of pro-tease inhibitors in HAART regimens, the incidence of cryptosporidiosis in patients with AIDS has declined substantially in developed countries. 83 However, in developing nations, gastrointestinal infection with C. parvum is prevalent, and carries high morbidity and mortality rates. 84, 85 Although Cryptosporidium was initially described in animals, it was first noted to cause an enterocolitis in both immunocompromised and immunocompetent humans in 1976. 86, 87 An intact T-cell response is the primary mechanism that confers protection against this organism; thus patients with abnormal T-cell function or number are at risk. The spectrum and severity of disease in immunocompromised individuals with cryptosporidiosis correlates with most severe disease found in individuals with defects in the T-cell response. 83 The overall frequency of infection seems to be related to the severity of immunodeficiency and not the specific disorder. 88 Cryptosporidium usually affects the gastrointestinal tract, although it has been found in other organs including the biliary tract, 89 pancreas 90 and respiratory tract. 91 In immunocompetent individuals, the diarrhea is self-limiting, whereas in immunocompromised patients it may be protracted and associated with significant malabsorption and nutritional compromise. The small intestine is the primary target, although it can occur in any part of the intestinal tract. Esophageal cryptosporidiosis has also been described in one child 92 and in adults. Clayton et al. 93 described two patterns of enteric cryptosporidiosis. One was accompanied by severe clinical disease with significant malabsorption, with the majority of the organisms found in the proximal small bowel, whereas less severe clinical disease was seen in patients with colonic disease or with infection only noted in the stool. Patients with proximal small bowel infection with Cryptosporidium showed crypt hyperplasia, villous atrophy, lamina propria inflammatory infiltrates, abnormal D-xylose absorption, greater weight loss, and shorter survival, with greater need for intravenous hydration and hyperalimentation than patients with colonic disease. In other studies, absorption of nutrients showed an inverse correlation with active infection, 94 as shown by altered vitamin B 12 and D-xylose absorption, and lactulose and mannitol urinary excretion ratios. Intestinal function improved in patients whose oocyte counts were reduced by treatment with paromomycin.",

            "text": "Symptomatic cryptosporidiosis has been documented in as many as 6.4% of immunocompetent children and 22% of immunodeficient children, whereas in an asymptomatic population, Cryptosporidium was found in 4.4% of immunocompetent and 4.8% of immunodeficient children. 94a Spiramycin at 100 mg per kg daily for 14 days caused a significant reduction in the shedding of infectious oocysts, and no gastrointestinal symptoms developed in children treated for asymptomatic infection, whereas children who were not treated developed gastrointestinal symptoms. 94a The diagnosis of cryptosporidiosis is made by identifying the organisms in a duodenal aspirate, stool or tissue sample (biopsies). On hematoxylinand eosin-stained sections, these organisms can be found as rows or clusters of basophilic spherical structures 2-4 \u03bcm in diameter, attached to the microvillous border of the epithelial cells ( Fig. 39.3) . The tips in the lateral aspect of the villi show the greatest number of organisms in the small intestine. In the colonic epithelium, the crypt and surface epithelial involvement appear equal. Cryptosporidium also stain positively with Giemsa, and negatively with mucous stains. The acid-fast stain on a stool sample is one of the most widely used methods of determining whether a patient has cryptosporidiosis. More recent sensitive and specific methods for diagnosing cryptosporidiosis include fluoresceinlabeled IgG monoclonal antibodies. 95, 96 Treatment of cryptosporidiosis in children with HIV-1 infection is often difficult. The disease can be chronic and protracted with diffuse watery diarrhea and dehydration. Several different agents are used to eradicate the organism, with varying success rates. The most effective treatment is to improve immunologic function and nutritional status. With the advent of HAART, many children's immune function has been restored with a lower incidence and prevalence of Cryptosporidium infection. 97 The introduction of HAART in a patient with severe debilitating Cryptosporidium infection not only resulted in an increased CD4 count in the peripheral blood and clearance of the organism, but also produced a marked increase in CD4 count in the rectal mucosa on biopsy, suggesting this may have been the main mechanism of clearing the parasite. 98 Octreotide therapy of acute and chronic diarrhea, with coincident improvement in nutritional status, eradicated Cryptosporidium in one patient. 96, 99 Other investigators have used bovine hyperimmune colostrum with benefit. 100, 101 The macrolides, such as azithromycin, have shown some promise in the treatment of Cryptosporidium infection. 102, 103 The effect of protease inhibitors as therapy against Cryptosporidium has been tested in a cell culture system. 104 Nelfinavir moderately inhibited the host cell inva-sion over a period of 2 h. Indinavir, nelfinavir and ritonavir inhibited parasite development significantly. The inhibitory effect was increased when the aminoglycoside paromomycin was combined with the protease inhibitors indinavir, ritonavir and, to a lesser extent, saquinavir, compared with the protease inhibitor alone. Thus protease inhibitor therapy may directly (rather than indirectly, through its effects on the immune system) inhibit growth of Cryptosporidium. Amadi et al. 84 found that a 3-day course of nitazoxanide improved diarrhea, helped eradicate the parasite and improved mortality in HIV-1-seronegative, but not HIV-1-seropositive, children in Zambia.",

These organisms were first described in 1857, when recognized as a cause of disease in non-human hosts. 105 The first description of microsporidia (Enterocytozoon bieneusi) as a human pathogen was in 1985, and microsporidia have since been described as more common human pathogens. 106 Infection with microsporidia typically occurs in patients with severely depressed CD4 T-lymphocyte counts. One of the largest case studies of intestinal microsporidiosis in patients with HIV-1 infection was described by Orenstein et al. 107 in 67 adult patients with AIDS and AIDS-related complex and chronic non-pathogenic diarrhea. E. bieneusi was diagnosed by electromicroscopy in 20 of the patients. Jejunal biopsies were more positive than duodenal biopsies. The parasites and spores were clearly visible by light microscopy in 17 of the 21 biopsies. Infection was confined to enterocytes located at the tip of the intestinal villus, and the histologic findings included villous atrophy, cell degeneration, necrosis and sloughing. Other investigators [108] [109] [110] found microsporidia in as many as 50% of HIV-1-infected patients with chronic and unexplained diarrhea evaluated in the pre-HAART era. E. bieneusi has been documented in 15-25% of children with 111 or without 112 diarrhea in developing countries, making it fairly ubiquitous in these regions of the world. Other species of microsporidia, including Encephalitozoon (septata) intestinalis, can cause significant enteric disease with diarrhea, wasting and malabsorption. Septata intestinalis differs from E. bieneusi in its tendency to disseminate, and can infect enterocytes, as well as macrophages, fibroblasts and endothelial cells.",

The esophagus is the primary target of Candida and this infection occurred in the majority of patients during the course of their illness in the pre-HAART era. It was also the second most frequent AIDS-defining disease, second in prevalence only to Pneumocystis carinii. Currently, with successful viral suppression, invasive Candida is rare with children on HAART. Patients with Candida esophagitis complain of odynophagia or dysphagia, and may often have vomiting and recurrent abdominal pain. Children often have oral thrush, coincident with more disseminated and invasive Candida esophagitis, although the absence of oral thrush does not preclude the diagnosis of Candida esophagitis. 28 In one study, oral candidiasis preceded the diagnosis of Candida esophagitis in 94% of children. 123 Other risk factors include low CD4 count and prior antibiotic use. 123 Histopathologically, yeast forms within an intact mucosa confirm invasive disease. This is in contrast to colonization, where the yeast is found overlying intact mucosal surfaces or necrotic tissue. These organisms are best seen with Grocott's methenamine silver method or periodic acid-Schiff stain. Upper gastrointestinal studies are suggestive of Candida esophagitis with diffuse mucosal irregularities (Fig. 39.4) . Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy with biopsy and appropriate staining is the most sensitive test for determining invasive candidiasis of the esophagus. Candidiasis can also occur in the stomach, as well as the small bowel if the acid barrier has been suppressed either through an intrinsic decrease in gastric acid production or iatrogenically with the use of potent acid blockers. Numerous effective therapies have been described to treat Candida of the upper gastrointestinal tract, including fluconazole, ketoconazole and itraconazole. 124, 125 Ketoconazole has more hepatic side-effects than fluconazole. Itraconazole is usually well tolerated and is effective. In severe and invasive disease, either topical or intravenous amphotericin can be used. Agents such as oral miconazole and nystatin are not indicated for invasive Candida.",

With diarrheal symptoms, every HIV-1-infected child should have a complete evaluation for bowel pathogens. This should precede all other diagnostic studies, as treatment of the pathogen may result in resolution of the symptoms. Investigation for enteric infections should include studies for the organisms outlined in the preceding section on infectious diarrhea. The child's antiretroviral regimen and initiation of new medications should be noted as many of these medications produce significant gastrointestinal side-effects (see Table 39 .2).

A raised baseline breath hydrogen or early peak of hydrogen production suggests bacterial overgrowth, and appropriate treatment can be initiated. Lactose malabsorption results in a level of hydrogen production more than 10-15 parts per million over baseline, 60 min after ingestion. Dietary changes can then be made. D-Xylose absorption testing also helps to determine the absorptive capacity of the gastrointestinal tract. D-Xylose is an absorbable sugar that does not require active transport for uptake by enterocytes. Thus, the D-xylose serum level, after administration of a test dose, reflects the absorptive ability of the gastrointestinal tract and the integrity of the mucosal surface. In younger children, the administered dose is 0.5 g per kg bodyweight, given orally after an overnight fast. In older children and adolescents, the maximum dose is 25 g.

An alternative method is to keep a dietary fat intake record during the period of fecal fat collection.The stool is analyzed for total fat content and the fecal fat is compared with the amount ingested; a coefficient of fat absorption is then calculated. Ten percent or more of ingested fat in the stool is considered abnormal. Alternatively, a Sudan stain may be performed on a random stool sample. This may be helpful as a quick test for fat malabsorption, although it is not so reliable. Quantification of fecal elastase may help to determine whether the fat malabsorption is pancreatic in origin. Lastly, raised fecal alpha 1 -antitrypsin levels suggest protein loss from the gut. If noninvasive studies, such as those described above, are not helpful in documenting and determining the etiology of the malabsorption, diarrhea or vomiting, endoscopy (either upper or lower) with biopsy and appropriate culture of fluid may be useful. Miller et al. 28 confirmed histologic abnormalities in 72% of children undergoing upper endoscopy. In 70% of patients in this series the clinical management of the child was changed because of the endoscopic evaluation. A high diagnostic yield has been supported by other investigators. 140 Specific gastrointestinal symptoms are not predictive of abnormal findings at endoscopy; advanced HIV-1 disease stage and an increased number of symptoms seem to be more predictive. 28 Histologic studies of the small bowel may aid in determining the degree of the villous blunting, and electron microscopy and special staining for opportunistic pathogens can be performed. Quantitative bacterial cultures and parasite evaluation of the duodenal fluid should be obtained when an endoscopy is performed. Characteristically, the detection of more than 10 5 organisms per ml of duodenal fluid confirms bacterial overgrowth. It is important to obtain both anaerobic and quantitative cultures. However, other studies have shown that endoscopy does not improve the diagnostic yield compared with stool examination in patients with intestinal infection. The only exception is the diagnosis of CMV. 141 An additional study found that flexible sigmoidoscopy was as useful as a full colonoscopy for diagnosing infection. 142 Special histologic stains for fungal, mycobacterial or viral infections did not increase the diagnostic yield over routine hematoxyline and eosin staining. 143 Treatment of intestinal infections has been outlined in Table 39 .2 and previous sections. Therapy for gastrointestinal malabsorption should be directed toward the underlying diagnosis. If clinically symptomatic lactose malabsorption is found, a lactose-free diet should be initiated. Compliance may be difficult, because many foods contain lactose. Children can limit the effects of dietary lactose by taking exogenous lactase or using lactase-treated milk. There should be careful consideration of calcium and vitamin D intake, as children with HIV-1 infection are susceptible to low bone mineral density. 144 If there is malabsorption of protein and fat, a protein hydrolysate diet 628 Gastrointestinal complications of secondary immunodeficiency syndromes should be tried. Many of these supplements are poorly tolerated because they are unpalatable. In some circumstances, specialized supplements may need to be administered through a supplemental feeding tube. 145, 146 Peptic and motility disorders can be treated as in other non-HIV-1-infected children, paying careful attention to potential drug interactions with antiretroviral regimens.",

Before HIV-1 was described, P. carinii pneumonia and Kaposi's sarcoma, known opportunistic diseases, were first described in otherwise healthy, but malnourished, children and adults in developing nations. 147, 148 This association led investigators to conclude that nutrition alone can affect the immunologic response of an individual. In malnourished children there is a profound involution of lymphoid tissues, including thymic atrophy and diminished paracortical regions of lymph nodes. 149 In young infants and children, protein-calorie malnutrition increases the risk of death by severalfold by increasing the susceptibility to infection. 150 In many countries, the mortality rate increases from 0.5% in children whose weight-for-height percentage of standard is greater than 80%, to 18% in children whose weight-for-height percentage of standard is less than 60%. 151 In other diseases such as cystic fibrosis and cancer, nutritional status has been linked closely to survival rates and morbidity. With leukemia and lymphoma, the incidence of infection with P. carinii is higher in patients with protein-calorie malnutrition. 147 Biochemically, protein-calorie malnutrition leads to changes in several aspects of the immune system. Cellmediated immunity, microbial function of phagocytes, complement systems, secretory antibodies and antibody affinity, are consistently impaired in patients with significant malnutrition. Additionally, deficiencies of micronutrients, especially zinc and iron, as well as many others, may also have deleterious effects on the immune system. Other aspects of immunity that are altered by protein-calorie malnutrition include impaired chemotaxis of neutrophils, decreased lysozyme levels in serum and secretions, and interferon production in antibody response to T celldependent antigens. A child with protein-calorie malnutrition may also have impaired mucosal immunity with lowered concentrations of secretory IgA in saliva, nasopharynx, tears and the gastrointestinal tract compared with well-nourished control children.",

Not only does nutrition improve the immunologic functioning of the intestinal tract, but nutrients themselves are trophic and essential for the maintenance of the absorptive capacity of the intestines. In some studies, weight loss greater than 30%, due to other disorders, was associated with a reduction in pancreatic enzyme secretion of over 80%, villous atrophy, and impaired carbohydrate and fat absorption. 152 These disorders are promptly reversed with appropriate nutritional rehabilitation. In addition, with villous blunting, increased antigen uptake may also occur, leaving the child at higher risk of enteric infection. The pathogenesis of villous blunting is currently unclear, but may be due to crypt hyperplasia as the primary event with premature sloughing at the villus tip 153 vs loss of enterocytes at the villus tip with resultant proliferation at the crypts. 154",
