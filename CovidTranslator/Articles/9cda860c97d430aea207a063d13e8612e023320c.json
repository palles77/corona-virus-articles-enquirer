In Japan, the test and culling policy is a basic control measure, and implementation of an adequate vaccination program is recommended as a national policy. In addition, optional control measures, including compulsory testing of introduced animals and bulk tank milk (BTM) testing as a mass screening method, are used in several provinces, but their efficacy has not been completely assessed. We evaluated these control measures using the scenario tree model of BVD in Japan, developed in the previous study. The model outputs indicated that compulsory testing of all introduced cattle, rather than only heifers and/or non-vaccinated cattle, was cost effective and reduced the risk of BVDV introduction due to animal movement and that BTM testing could effectively monitor most part of the cattle population. Vaccination coverage and BVDV prevalence among introduced cattle could also affect the cost effectiveness of compulsory testing of targeted cattle, particularly under low vaccination coverage or high BVDV prevalence. However, even with the implementation of a highly effective monitoring scheme for many years, BVD risk could not be eliminated; it instead converged at a very low level (0.02%). Disease models with a cost-effective output could be a powerful tool in developing a control scheme for chronic animal diseases, including BVD, with the consent of relevant stakeholders.",

Transient infection (TI) of BVDV in adult ruminants produces subclinical or non-severe symptoms [5, 26] ; however, BVDV can be transmitted to the fetus of pregnant cattle between 30 and 120 days of gestation, thereby inducing fetal immune tolerance to BVDV and resulting in the delivery of persistently infected (PI) calves [23] . PI calves shed BVDVs through oculonasal discharge and other secretions throughout their lives, without showing any apparent clinical manifestations, except fatal mucosal disease [4, 7] . PI cattle are commonly believed to be the primary source of BVDV infection in a herd [15, 27] . Therefore, PI cattle need to be promptly detected and culled for the control of BVD [1] .",

A virus detection system using the ear notch approach has been implemented to detect PI animals in Switzerland [2, 30] . Germany has adopted antigen detection, also mainly using ear notch samples, as well as mass vaccination as an optional biosecurity measure, although optional vaccination has not been widely implemented due to a certain BVDV vaccine causing infection because of bovine neonatal pancytopenia [3, 9] . Importation of infected cattle or pregnant PI dams carrying the fetus is considered to be the main route of BVD introduction into BVD-free countries [25] . BTM is widely used in screening tests for BVDV infection in dairy cattle. Vaccination is adopted to a BVD control measure in Japan; hence, detection of BVDV antigens rather than antibodies against BVDV in BTM has been developed and is commonly implemented domestically [20, 21] .",

            "text": "In Japan, after the identification of BVD being a notifiable disease in 1998, the number of diagnosed cases has stabilized to between 100 and 200 animals per year [21] . According to the latest survey of PI animals in Japanese dairy farms, the proportions of farms with PI animals and of cattle diagnosed as PI animals were 7.6% [95% confidence interval (CI): 3.1-16.4%] and 0.12% [95% CI: 0.05-0.25%], respectively [21] . Specific control measures, including mass vaccination, screening tests using BTM, and active surveillance for PI cattle, have been voluntarily implemented at areas at a high risk of BVD in collaboration with governments and agricultural parties at the local level [20, 32] . Each of local governments in Japan is required to select the optional control measures under limited human and financial resources. Implementation of these intensive control measures could markedly reduce risks of BVDV infection in BVD endemic areas; however, the sustainability of these control measures should be focused to maintain a very low or negligible level of BVD risk. Mathematical models dealing with BVD have been developed to enable us to simulate its spread in the area specified in the computer program and to identify factors affecting intra-or inter-herd disease spread [8, 10, 12, 17, 18, 39] . Indeed, simulation analyses of various control measures for BVD in Japan using a stochastic model or a scenario tree were recently reported [19, 35] ; however, the cost effectiveness of the BVD control measures was not fully analyzed.",

The outputs obtained from the model indicated that compulsory testing of only heifers and/or non-vaccinated cattle, rather than all introduced animals, would be a cost-effective way to reduce BVD risk under various scenarios of vaccination coverage or BVDV prevalence and that BTM testing could successfully, but not completely, monitor non-introduced animals.

The default probabilities of cattle being persistently or transiently infected as well as those of possessing sufficient immunity for protection against BVDV infection (both maternal immunity and immunity acquired through vaccination with triple administration) were also the same as those observed in the previous study.",

On the other hand, the cost of outbreak investigation was not included into the total cost because this is a response mandated by the Act on Domestic Animal Infectious Disease Control in Japan and is covered by the government. A BTM sample of between 100 and 200 cattle is said to be usually used for diagnosis by RT-PCR method. Given that it costs 2,000 JPY to run one RT-PCR reaction, the unit cost of BTM testing would be estimated as 10 to 20 JPY. The cost of compulsory testing should be assumed either as 2,000 JPY by RT-PCR or as 1,000 JPY by antigen-detection using ear-notch sample, which is instructed from the manufacturer. Finally, we adopted the cheaper price of each of two tests and set the unit cost of BTM and compulsory testing as 10 JPY and 1,000 JPY per animal, respectively.",

            "text": "According to the latest large-scale survey in Japan, seven cattle on six farms tested positive for persistent infection with BVDV among 5,949 cattle from 79 farms analyzed, resulting in 7.59% (95% CI: 3.1-16.4%) of farms comprising PI animals and 0.12% of cattle being PI (95% CI: 0.05-0.25%) [21] . Four out of six affected farms had not implemented vaccination for one year, and none of the seven PI animals had been vaccinated, indicating that non-vaccination may be a major factor in Japan for persistent BVDV infection in cattle. In addition, the fact that most of the PI animals in the above-mentioned survey were detected in heifers implies the importance of monitoring heifers for BVD control as high priority. Given these points, we aimed to develop scenario models to monitor non-vaccinated animals and/or heifers intensively but cheaply. The results obtained in this study confirmed the efficacy of compulsory testing of introduced animals, and targeting heifers and/or non-vaccinated cattle rather than all cattle, should be sufficient to be efficacious and highly cost effective if BTM tests are implemented concurrently. In addition, more effort might be required to arrange a system to register introduced animals with minimum necessary information including vaccination status, possibility of pregnancy as well as cattle ID in order to grasp the animal introduction accurately. Although BTM testing contributes less to the detection of introduced animals, it should be regarded as a very powerful tool to monitor the entire population inexpensively, and in general, the proportion of lactating cattle to the entire population is much larger than that of introduced animals. In Japan, BTM tests are used for the detection of BVDV genome, which is differing from well-developed antibody detection system in Europe. The effectiveness of BTM tests using antigen monitoring has been widely recognized and reported [20] [21] [22] ; however, this effective and cheap monitoring program cannot be applied to beef cattle population. Hence, the prevalence of BVD animals in the beef cattle population in Japan might have seldom been reported. A monitoring program for BVD in beef cattle also needs to be developed to confirm the BVD prevalence among these herds. In this study, it was observed that lower BVDV prevalence resulted in smaller gaps in vaccination coverages with respect to both the number of detected and missed animals (Fig. 3) . Ultimately, under very low BVDV prevalence, the monitoring effectiveness at 0% of vaccination coverage was not apparently different from that at 100%. These findings may trigger suggestions for reviewing implementation of compulsory testing to introduced non-vaccinated animals because, under very low BVDV prevalence, the efficacy of compulsory testing would be rarely affected by vaccination coverage. It indicates, if efficacy of monitoring programs were not different, many of stakeholders might select the cheaper program to decrease financial burdens. However, this change would require intensive discussion with convincing scientific evidence because it should be implemented under the hypothesis that the very low prevalence of BVDV is maintained by proper biosecurity measures with different stakeholders in outside of the target area. Otherwise, BVDV would spread rapidly among sensitive cattle in outside of the target area that has not been conferred enough immunity to prevent its re-infection by vaccination, and then might be introduced to the target area by animal movement. This would be supported by the model analysis that low compliance with the eradication program owing to lack of proper epidemiological information sharing due to revising the program during its implementation may accelerate BVDV re-infection [38] . Indeed, it is not practical to abolish BVD vaccination in Japan because BVD vaccines, both attenuated or inactivated, are widely used in Japan together with several major virus antigens in cattle as mixed vaccine; hence we cannot quit BVD vaccination easily only due to decrease of BVD prevalence.",

            "text": "Since BVD is mainly a chronic disease that causes economic losses, including decreased milk production and growth, and respiratory disorders [14, 15, 24, 41] , the risk of BVD is not apparent to farmers. Thus, the benefit of control or eradication programs for BVD should be made clear to them to obtain consent for the implementation of strategies such as mass vaccination and biosecurity measures at the regional level. However, because effectiveness of the control measure would require several years to materialize in most cases, maintaining high motivation to sustain the measures is often challenging. In other words, control measures should be implemented with the cooperation of all stakeholders and evaluated prior to commencement as well as during adoption of appropriate program change in response to unexpected occurrences or with respect to the balance between effectiveness and expenditure. Although we focused on the cost of voluntary control measures, compulsory testing of introduced animals, and mass screening of BTM, another study calculated the net production losses due to BVDV infection and control expenditures [37] . It should be beneficial to spend control expenditures in a short period if the objective is to reduce net production losses [29] . Thus, an eradication program may not be highly cost effective when it is launched; however, once a disease-free status is achieved, the longer the status is maintained, the more cost effective the program becomes [42] . Cost-effective analysis of net production losses and general hygiene management in Japanese dairy farms should be performed to develop appropriate voluntary BVD control measures in epidemiologically different areas.",

The results suggested that the selection of compulsory test animals is critical to increasing cost effectiveness and that BTM testing as a mass screening tool for the entire population is apparently both beneficial and cheap. However, even with a highly effective monitoring scheme, BVD prevalence will not decrease to zero but converge at a very low level. Cost-effective analysis is a powerful tool to develop control measures for chronic animal disease with the consent of stakeholders. More comprehensive cost-effective analysis, in which both expenditure and net production losses are taken into consideration, should prove to be a valuable tool for developing effective animal disease control strategies.",
