In 1982 WOODE et at. (1) described the isolation of a virus during an acute epizootie of neonatal calf diarrhea in Breda, Iowa, U.S.A. (Breda virus 1). AntigenieMly related viruses were later found in feces from a colostrum-deprived calf in Iowa (Breda virus 2) (4) and from 5 to 6 months old diarrheic calves in Ohio, U.S.A. (5) . A morphologically similar virus (Lyon 4 virus) detected in cattle in Lyon, France (6, 7) , was shown later to possess an antigenic relatedness to the Berne (BEV) and Breda (BRV) viruses. BEARDS et al. (8) reported in 1984 particles resembling BEV and BRV in stool specimens of children and adults with diarrhea, which reacted with antibodies against BEV and BRV in immunoelectron microscopy. Similar particles were seen by Schaap in feces of children with gastroenteritis in Rotterdam (3) . Consequently, members of the torovirus family presently recognized are enteric viruses from three different, species. From serological studies, however, the presence of toroviruses in other animals became evident. This review summarizes the current knowledge of the properties of this new group of viruses.",

BRV were described to possess 7.6-9.5 nm pcplomers; few particles showed irregularly arranged processes of 17-24 nm thought by WOODE et al. to represent tissue debris (1). The longer peplomers were more frequently seen in BRV 2 than BRV 1 preparations. Particles from human feces were surrounded by a halo of 7 -9 nm projections; occasionally a second ring of small peplomers was noticed, partly superimposed upon the first. Longer projections were only occasionally observed (8) .",

The innermost circle of highest electron density (diameter 24 nm) is thought to represent a transversal section through the nueleoeapsid. Its electron lucent centre is indicative for the tubular structure of the core. Thin sections through BRV infected intestinal cells of calves (10, 11, 12) showed elongated viral particles with rounded ends measuring 42 \u00d7 100.5 nm. In cross-sections a core of high electron density with an electron lucent, central channel could be discerned from a fuzzy outer membrane of medium electron density.",

It has I~NA binding properties and was found in an intraeellular substructure of higher density than tlhe virion (d = 1.36 g/ ml in CsC1). It is therefore suggested to represent the main capsid protein (14) . In radioimmune precipitation (RIP) it, was recognized preferentially by heterologous sera (cattle), another indication that the 20kD protein corresponds to an internal, evolutionary conserved, and broadly crossreactive protein. Second in abundance (about 13 per cent of the virion protein mass) is the 22 kD protein. It is neither phosphorylated nor glycosylated. After treatment, of virions with Triton X-100 the 22 kD polypeptide was found in slowly sedimenting material, an observation indicative of its membrane association. The 22 kD protein is therefore a likely candidate for an envelope protein (14) , (HORZINEK et al., unpublished results). The low molecular weight polypeptide of B R V does not comigrate in PAGE with the 20 kD nucleocapsid protein of BEV and seems to be larger. Its migration behaviour was affected by ether extraction suggesting a membrane association and a correspondance to the 22 kD protein of BEV (15) . No function could be attributed to the phosphorylated 37 kD protein so far; it is assumed to serve as a matrix protein.",

            "text": "The high molecular weight virion protein in the range of 75-100 kD of BEV is glycosylated, probably by N-linked oligosaccharides since tunicamycin, an antibiotic known to inhibit N-linked oligosaccharide synthesis, prevented the formation of infectious virus as well as appearance of the 75-100 kD band in PAGE of infected cells (20) . In RIP the 75-100 kD protein of BEV was preferably recognized by a horse antiserum with high neutralization activity (14) . Radioiodinated B R V preparations contained genome: BEV replication is not inhibited by DNA nueleotide analogous which indicates the presence of an RNA genome (2). One type of single stranded RNA molecule with a mol. wt of about 5.7 \u00d7 106 was isolated from virus particles. The virion RNA was shown to be infectious and a positive polarity is suggested. Polyadenylation of genomie RNA was apparent from oligo dT affinity chromatography and TI l~NAse fingerprints. (HoRZlNEt~ et al., unpublished results).",

For BEV and Bt~V 2 sedimentation coefficients of 400 and 350 S, respectively, were estimated (15) . In addition to the main infectivity (400 S) peak a second virus specific peak of slower sedimentation (50 to 150 S) was detected in isokinetie sucrose gradients of BEV; these particles contained smaller virus specific RNA molecules and the 22 kD protein. They were non-infectious and are probably non-interfering. Also in BI%V 2 preparations a second peak (90 S) with a hemagglutinating activity was encountered. Nature and significance of these subviral particles require further study. t~esistanee BEV is readily inactivated by heat but well preserved if stored at temperatures below -20 \u00b0 C (16) . Desiccation and freeze-drying resulted in insignificant losses of infectivity. BEV is very sensitive to LVV-ix'raditation. A high stability to extreme hydrogen ion concentrations was noted; infectivity titers remained unchanged in a pH range between 2.5 to 10.3. Pronase and B. subtilis proteinase reduced BEV virus infectivity whereas treatment with trypsin and chymotrypsin remained without effect. Neither phospholipase C, 1%Nase nor DOC (0.1 per cent) affected the titer of purified BEV preparations.",

Tubular structures, representing nucleocapsids, are formed in places distant from the budding site. They are often seen in immediate proximity of cytoplasmic accumulations of an electron dense granular substance supposed to consist of ~iral material. Tubules were not only encountered in the cytoplasm but Budding of virus particles occurs predominantly into the Golgi system but was also observed through membranes of the rough endoplasmic reticulum and into the perinuclear space. The following sequence of events was reconstructed: The intracytoplasmic nucleoeapsid becomes attached to the membrane with one of its rounded ends and subsequently sideways. During budding the eapsid apparently acquires its definite diameter and electron density. As a result of the budding process an enveloped bacilliform virus particle is found free in the lumen of the cytoplasmic cisternae (Fig. 7) . Virus containing vesicles merge with the peripheral plasma membrane and release their contents. During transition from the intravesieular to the extracellular state the morphology of virus particles changes from the rod-like form to the characteristic torus form (Fig. 8) .",

These are not the only host species of toroviruses. From serological examinations evidence was obtained that BEV-related viruses are prevalent in other ungulates (cattle, goat, sheep, pig), in tbral mice and in laboratory rabbits (18) . In 86 per cent of cattle, 69 per cent of goat, 34 per cent of sheep, and 74 per cent of pig sera tested high antibody tigers cross-reacting with BEV in seroneutralization were detected. Low neutralization titers were found in sera of laboratory rabbits and in two species of wild mice (Apodemus sylvaticus, CIethrionomys glareolus); they may indicate the presence of more distant serotypes. The high tigers encountered in ungulates, however, are thought to be due to viruses serologically more closely related to BEV. Neutralization tests are known to be very sensitive and specific. Assays for group specific antigens should elucidate the actual prevalence of toroviruses in different animal species and probably explain erratic inhibitions obtained with feline and human sera in the seroneutralization tests. It is not known whether toroviruses are restricted to their respective hosts or interspecies transmission Occurs. Toroviruses are widespread in horse and cattle populations as evidenced by the presence of antibody titers. In Switzerland, 80 per cent of randomly collected sera (n= 500) from adult horses contained antibodies reacting with BEV in a seroneutralization test. Antibodies against BEV were also encountered in small numbers of randomly collected equine sera from Germany, France, Italy and the U.S.A. (18) . In cattle sera from the U.S.A. (n = 156) 88.5 per cent were reported positive in an ELISA using BRV as an antigen (t9).",

A mouse immune serum produced against BRV 2 reacted with both the 85 and 105 kD proteins of B R V 1 in RIP, inhibited the hemagglutination of the heterologous virus and neutralized the infectivity of BEV (15). Taken these facts together it can be assumed that the high molecular weight polypeptides of BEV and B R V represent surface structures of the viruses, most, probably peplomerie proteins.
