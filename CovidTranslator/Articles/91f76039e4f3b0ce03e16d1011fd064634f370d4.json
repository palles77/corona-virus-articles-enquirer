            "text": "An antigenic variant of avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), a coronavirus, was isolated and characterized. This strain, CUT2, possesses a number of unusual features, which have not been previously observed in IBV. The S1 glycoprotein of CU-T2 carries virus-neutralizing and serotype-specific epitopes of two IBV serotypes, Arkansas (Ark) and Massachusetts (Mass). Sequence analysis revealed that the virus, originally an Ark serotype, has acquired the Mass-specific epitope by mutation(s). This provides evidence that point mutations may lead to generation of IBV antigenic variants in the field. It was further observed that two independent recombination events involving three different IBV strains had occurred in the $2 glycoprotein gene and N protein gene of CU-T2, indicating that genomic RNA recombination in IBV may occur in multiple genes in nature. It was especially significant that a sequence of Holland 52 (a vaccine strain) had replaced half of the N gene of CU-T2. This proves that recombination among vaccine strains is contributing to the generation of IBV variants in the field. Based on these observations it is predicted that every IBV field isolate could have unique genetic nature. Therefore, several recently reported diagnostic and serotyping methods of IBV which are based on dot-blot hybridization, restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP), and polymerase chain reaction (PCR), may not reveal the true antigenic and/or genetic nature of IBV isolates, and may in fact yield misleading information.",

Live vaccines containing strains of those three serotypes have been routinely used in the field. However, more frequently than ever, outbreaks of the disease are being observed in vaccinated flocks.

Interestingly, this recombinant fragment was similar to one previously observed in KB8523, a possible recombinant strain of IBV [25] . Recombination fragments in other two European isolates (6/82 and D207) were also found within the same regions [25] , although they were of shorter length than those of CU-T2 and KB8523 strains. In an in vitro transfection experiment it was observed that RNA recombination in MHV occurred preferentially at certain selected sites (hot spots) [1] . In IBV, a secondary structure most likely exists at the 5' end of Gene3 [30] . We found that the downstream crossover sites of both CU-T2 and KB8523 were located around that secondary structure (data not shown). The clustering of recombinations in IBV suggests that a recombination 'hot spot' most likely exists around the 3' end of the S2 gene and the 5' end of the Gene3, although the clustering may be a result of selection [2] .",

More interestingly, that recombination fragment in the CU-T2 is almost identical to a sequence (99.2~o homology) in the N gene of Ho1152 strain. Since both Ark99 and Ho1152 strains have been used simultaneously as live vaccines in the USA [24] , this finding provides convincing evidence that recombination among vaccine strains is contributing to the emergence of variants in the field. The significance of recombination in the N gene must also be viewed in the light of a recent report that the N protein may induce cellular immune responses against IBV [6] .",

The replacement, however, may not result in change of antigenic nature of IBV. In contrast, mutation(s) on the S1 protein alone may generate new VN epitope(s). The data imply that every field isolate of IBV could be unique in RNA sequence. Therefore, recently reported diagnostic and serotyping methods of IBV, such as dot-blot hybridization [33] , restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) [26, 40] , may not reflect the true antigenic and/or genetic nature of the virus. Indeed, an exclusive use of such assays may yield misleading information on the antigenic and/or genetic characteristics of the virus.",
