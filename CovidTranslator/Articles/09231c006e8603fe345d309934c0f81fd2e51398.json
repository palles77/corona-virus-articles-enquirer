In this study, two epitopes (N1 and N2) of the N protein of SARS-CoV were predicted by bioinformatics analysis. After immunization with two peptides, the peptides-specific antibodies were isolated from the immunized rabbits. The further experiments demonstrated that N1 peptideinduced polyclonal antibodies had a high affinity to bind to E. coli expressed N protein of SARS-CoV. Furthermore, it was confirmed that N1 peptide-specific IgG antibodies were detectable in the sera of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) patients. The results indicated that an epitope of the N protein has been identified and N protein specific Abs were produced by peptide immunization, which will be useful for the study of SARS-CoV.",

The mortality of this disease is higher and therefore few hundreds of people have died from the disease. In the absence of effective vaccines and drugs, infectious diseases such as SARS that is spread by the respiratory route must be taken very seriously. It is very important that public health officials are able to identify people infected with SARS at early stages of the disease and isolate them for an appropriate time, thus the cycle of transmission can be broken. Voluntary isolation and quarantine are of great inconvenience for a lot of people, but they are currently our best tools to save lives [2] . An accurate diagnosis method for SARS is urgent needed and it will be great helpful for people against SARS [3] [4] [5] .",
