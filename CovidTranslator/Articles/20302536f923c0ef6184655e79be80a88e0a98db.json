Although strategic mining of electronic health records has produced real-world evidences to inform drug repurposing, using omics data (drug and disease), knowledge base of protein interactions, and database of transcription factors have been explored. Structured integration of all the existing data under the framework of drug repurposing will facilitate decision making. The ability to foresee the need to integrate new data types produced by emergent technologies and to enable data connectivity in the context of human biology and targeted diseases, as well as to use the existing crucial quality data of all approved drugs will catapult the number of drugs being successfully repurposed. However, translational pharmacodynamics databases for modeling information across human biology in the context of host factors are lacking and are critically needed for drug repurposing to improve global public health, especially for the efforts to combat neglected tropic diseases as well as emergent infectious diseases such as Zika or Ebola virus.",

Observations of treatment-related adverse reactions during drug development have led to repositioning for different indications; such cases include antihypertensive drugs, minoxidil repurposed for alopecia 1 and sildenafil for erectile dysfunction. 2 There are successes achieved in drug repurposing (Drugs@FDA) and ongoing efforts are being made (ClinicalTrials.Gov). Using key words of drug repurposing or drug repositioning, only a handful of studies were found at various stages of clinical trial (https:// clinicaltrials.gov/). However, there are still unmet medical needs for communicable diseases (CDs) and noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) worldwide, and creative new measures are needed for the efforts of drug repurposing. Many neglected tropical diseases are prevalent in poor countries, affecting millions of people, and they occasionally cause deadly outbreaks invoking global panic and inflicting harms to global economy and well-being. Recent outbreaks of deadly Ebola virus disease (EVD) and current spreading of Zika virus infection that has caused birth of babies with microcephaly have caused global distress. In addition, there are millions of people and their families struggling with NCDs including mental illnesses in developed and underdeveloped countries. 3, 4 There is tremendous need for costeffective medications to treat emergent diseases to reduce global health burden.",

We computationally showed that the pharmacological targets of more than 200 drugs associated with treatment-related neuropathy were linked, via protein-protein interactions, to a very small list of statistically significant transcription factors, 23 which laid the foundation for our latter work on computing signaling pathways of drugs from drug targets to differentially perturbed genes. We were able to link drug-induced, differentially expressed genes to drug targets by using integer linear programming across prior knowledge of protein interaction networks and transcription factors. 24 Drug targets are proteins; there is a critical need for using transcription factors as linkers to establish computational connectivity between mRNAs and intracellular, biological protein networks in the context of understanding the effects of drugs.",

Repurposing approved drugs in combination to combat viral diseases by blocking key points in the life cycle of a virus using host cells' apparatus is a reasonable approach. Looking forward, there are 2 potential strategies for drug repurposing: (1) identifying a new novel target for an approved drug and (2) identifying combination products useful for a target disease, as shown in Figure 1 . Identifying potent combinations of 2 approved drugs for treating diseases is a viable option; for example, combination of statins and topoisomerase inhibitors reportedly enhanced the proapoptotic activity of the latter for glioblastoma. 25 Once the matching of a few drugs or drug pairs with a disease is completed, one could use historical biopharmaceutics and clinical pharmacology data to conduct systems pharmacology modeling to optimize dosing regimens for studies in clinical trials for the new indication (Fig. 2) . Adding relevant biomarkers to the matching models could make modeling more powerful and useful. Discussions in the following highlight the types of data useful for drug repurposing, as shown in Figure 2 .",

Infectious diseases share a common feature that virus use to gain entry into a host cell via a specific protein; host cell proteins or function are then used by virus for replication and subsequent infection. Therefore, there are 2 paths to tackle viral diseases, one is targeting viral enzymes and the other is targeting human functions required for viral entry and replication. 30 These host cells' proteins are the primary targets for control and treatment of infection. To illustrate the usefulness of such a database, Zika virus disease is discussed herein. Zika virus disease is an emerging public health issue because it has been associated with microcephaly of newborns, premature births, blindness of newborns, neurological disorders in the elderly or vulnerable populations, and it can be transmitted via mosquitoes bite or sexually. Entry of Zika virus into human cells is mainly mediated by dendritic cell-specific intracellular adhesion molecule 3-grabbing nonintegrin (DC-SIGN), AXL receptor tyrosine kinase, Tyro3 protein tyrosine kinase. 31 These proteins are also the receptors of other flavivirus for entry into human cells. 32 TYRO3, protein tyrosine kinase, is also a human protein for entry of Ebola and Marburg viruses; (http://www.ncbi.nlm. nih.gov/gene). TYRO3 is abundant in the brain. In rat brains, TYRO3 is widely expressed throughout the development stages after birth compared to AXL; and these receptor tyrosine kinases play a key role in the maturation and development of the central nervous system, 33 thereby constituting potential targets to battle Zika virus. A database and knowledge base of pharmacodynamics across all approved drugs with individual antiviral potency will be the foundation for conducting systems pharmacology analysis, as well as for constructing systems pharmacology framework and models to battle infectious diseases such as Zika virus disease.",

As illustrated in Figure 3 , systems pharmacology modeling is a translational tool that is constructed by design to capture information transmission across select levels of human body hierarchy; in vitro and in vivo pharmacodynamics data are critically needed to enable translational information transmission via systems pharmacology modeling for drug repurposing. Clinical markers measured during treatment either from published clinical trials or from EHRs can be incorporated into the pharmacodynamics database so that systems pharmacology approaches can meaningfully infer drug and disease interactions and model reversal of disease biology.",

            "text": "There is a tremendous medical need to treat and control CDs and NCDs worldwide. Emerging infectious diseases and neglected tropic diseases are no longer local health issues and should be preemptively controlled before they spread globally. The availability of big data ranging from omics to readouts of imaging and biochemical phenotypes, clinical laboratory and phenotypic profiles of individual natural diseases, and medical records of population responses to prescribed treatment regimens across ethic groups presents a new opportunity at the frontier of drug repurposing. Human-induced pluripotent stem cells, specific organ cell types derived from human-induced pluripotent stem cells, and cancer stem cells are being actively investigated and used in life science research. High-throughput screening technologies are being applied to facilitate the use of these cells for screening of new chemical entities and for fingerprinting individual marketed drugs to decipher the pharmacological network of a drug in the context of human biology. Our ability to discover the mode of action of an approved drug from the systems pharmacology perspective is increasing at a fast pace with advances in informatics and omics technologies (transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, and genomics). So is our ability to use big data with informatics technologies. What is needed is a database that translates the action of drugs at the molecular level to the response phenotypes observed either in 2-D or 3-D cell culture constructs or animals or humans. A database of pharmacodynamics in connection to clinical markers and end points in the context of human biology will aid the use of systems pharmacology methods to facilitate drug repurposing in the wake of global health burden and to improve global well-being. A pharmacodynamics database dedicated to neglected tropic diseases will benefit as well as improve global economy and well-being. Figure 3 . A systems pharmacology framework for drug repurposing in which pharmacodynamics is needed to translate across the hierarchy of human biology. Initiation of evidence-based drug repurposing originates from real-world pharmacodynamic evidences or from dose-dependent pharmacodynamic measures in cells and organs (organs-onthe-chip or preclinical organs). In vitro/preclinical pharmacodynamic/phenotypic measures transmit the information of molecular-level and cell community-level interactions and reveal interactions between a drug and a human body at the subject level. In the target disease population, pharmacodynamics reflects the repurposed therapeutic effects of a drug and associated population variability. Ultimately, with existing biopharmaceutics and clinical pharmacology characteristics, successes in drug repurposing are facilitated by systems pharmacology modeling of pharmacodynamic responses.",
