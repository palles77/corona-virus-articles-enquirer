Estimates of the serial interval can only be obtained by linking dates of onset for infector-infectee pairs, and these links are not easily established. A recently published epidemiological study used contact tracing data from cases reported in Hubei Province early in the epidemic to estimate the mean serial interval at 7.5 days [2] , which is consistent with the 8.4-day mean serial interval reported for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) from Singaporean household contact data [3] . However, there were only six infector-infectee pairs in this dataset, and sampling bias may have been introduced to the variance and mean. To further assess the serial interval of COVID-19 infections we compiled a dataset of 28 publicly shared infector-infectee pairs and calculated the serial interval from these data.",

A substantial proportion of secondary transmission occurring before illness onset indicates that many transmissions cannot be prevented solely through isolation of symptomatic cases, as by the time contacts are traced they may have already become infectious themselves and generated secondary cases [9] .

Considering the overall mild nature of the infection [10] it is possible that different reporting jurisdictions have different criteria for determining what qualifies as illness onset for COVID-2019 cases, which is a potential bias we are unable to account for. However, the present study addresses the issue of data quality of the reported pairs in two ways. First, our data include the updated information from a recent report of pre-symptomatic transmission in Germany [4] where it was later found that the primary case was already symptomatic while in contact with persons who later became infected (Supplementary Material in [4] ). Second, classification of the credibility of the data and comparing analyses including and excluding less certain (but nonetheless highly probable) pairs allowed us to determine that our results using J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f -8 -all pairs (and therefore a greater sample size) did not differ significantly from the results using only the most credible data.",
