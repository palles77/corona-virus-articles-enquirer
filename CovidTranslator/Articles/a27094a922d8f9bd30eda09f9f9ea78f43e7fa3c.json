The structural and functional genomics approaches have now pinpointed the technical challenge in the exploration of disease-related genes and the recognition of their structural alterations or elucidation of gene function. Various promising technologies and diagnostic applications of structural genomics are currently preparing a large database of disease-genes, genetic alterations etc., by mutation scanning and DNA chip technology. Further the functional genomics also exploring the expression genetics (hybridization-, PCR-and sequence-based technologies), twohybrid technology, next generation sequencing with Bioinformatics and computational biology. Advances in microarray ''chip'' technology as microarrays have allowed the parallel analysis of gene expression patterns of thousands of genes simultaneously. Sequence information collected from the genomes of many individuals is leading to the rapid discovery of single nucleotide polymorphisms or SNPs. Further advances of genetic engineering have also revolutionized immunoassay biotechnology via engineering of antibody-encoding genes and the phage display technology. The Biotechnology plays an important role in the development of diagnostic assays in response to an outbreak or critical disease response need. However, there is also need to pinpoint various obstacles and issues related to the commercialization and widespread dispersal of genetic knowledge derived from the exploitation of the biotechnology industry and the development and marketing of diagnostic services. Implementation of genetic criteria for patient selection and individual assessment of the risks and benefits of treatment emerges as a major challenge to the pharmaceutical industry.

In the 1980s, the term ''Molecular Diagnostics'' was utilized in the names of companies such as Molecular Diagnostics Incorporated and Bethesda Research Laboratories Molecular Diagnostics [2] . The 1990s saw an era of identification of newly discovered genes and new techniques for DNA sequencing. This led to the emergence of a distinct field of molecular and genomic laboratory medicine; in 1995, the Association for Molecular Pathology (AMP) was formed to give it structure. In 1999, the AMP co-founded The Journal of Medical Diagnostics; Informa Healthcare launched Expert Reviews in Medical Diagnostics in 2001 [3] . From 2002 onwards, the Hap Map Project combined information on the one-letter genetic differences that recur in the human population, as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and also pointed their relationship with disease. In 2012, molecular diagnostic techniques for Thalassemia use genetic hybridization tests to recognize the specific SNP causing an individual's disease.",

It is a robust technique as a large amount of copies of the target sequence generated by its exponential amplification, permiting the identification of a known mutation within a single day, rather than months. With the advent of PCR, molecular diagnostics to cross the threshold of the clinical laboratory for the provision of genetic services, such as carrier or population screening for known mutations, prenatal diagnosis of inherited diseases, or in recent years, identification of unknown mutations. Therefore, being moved to their proper environment, the clinical laboratory, and molecular diagnostics could provide the services for which they have been initially considered. Each PCR cycle theoretically doubles the amount of specific DNA sequence present resulting in an exponential accumulation of the DNA fragment being amplified. PCR is an enzyme-driven, primer-mediated (forward and reverse primer), temperature-dependent process for replicating a specific DNA sequence in vitro. The principle of PCR is based on the repetitive cycling of three simple reactions of amplification that include: (1) Denaturing: At 95\u00b0C template DNA double strand separates into two single strands. (2) Annealing: Next the temperature is reduced to 55\u00b0C and two specific oligonucleotide primers attach to the DNA template complementarily. (3) Extension: The temperature is then raised again but this time to 72\u00b0C, facilitating the DNA polymerase to extend the primers at the 3 0 terminus of each primer and synthesize the complementary strands along 5 0 to 3 0 terminus of each template DNA using deoxynucleotides contained in media.",

Here two or more primer pairs are included in one reaction tube and two or more DNA templates are targeted simultaneously. It is a relatively effortless molecular way to detect few different bacteria in one PCR reaction. In multiplex PCR, the primer pairs should be specific to the target gene and the PCR products (amplicons) should be in different sizes that are specific to different DNA sequences. This technique saves time and reagents by targeting multiple genes at a time, therefore extra information may be gained from a single test-run that otherwise would require several times the reagents and more time to perform. Annealing temperatures for each of the primer sets must be optimized to work correctly within a single reaction, and amplicon sizes.

This is the most valuable and sensitive technique for mRNA detection and quantitation that is currently available. RT-PCR is mostly used to detect viruses and the viability of microbial cells through the assessment of microbial mRNA. The discovery of PCR also has provided the foundations for the design and development of many mutation detection schemes, based on amplified DNA. In general, PCR either is used for the generation of the DNA fragments to be examined, or is part of the recognition method. The first attempt was the use of restriction enzymes [6] or oligonucleotide probes, immobilized onto membranes or in solution [7] in order to spot the existing genetic variation, in particular the sickle cell disease-causing mutation. In the following years, an even larger number of mutation detection approaches have been build up and implemented. RT-PCR may be single step or two step procedure. As the name suggests single step RT-PCR shall combines first-strand cDNA synthesis (RT) and subsequent PCR in a single reaction tube. This technique requires gene specific primer and is useful in high throughput applications. However it is less sensitive and efficient since the reaction is a compromise between reverse transcription and amplification conditions. Two step PCR requires two steps-first one for the synthesis of c-DNA in a PCR tube followed by second step in a separate PCR tube for amplification of gene of interest. This technique is more sensitive, flexible and allows analysis of multiple genes.",

It is based on using fluorescent labelled probes to detect, confirm, and quantify the PCR products as they are being generated in real time. The real time PCR, which has three novel features as temperature cycling occurs considerable faster than in standard PCR assays, hybridization of specific DNA probes occurs continuously during the amplification reaction and a fluorescent dye is coupled to the probe and fluoresces only when hybridization takes place. Lack of post PCR processing of amplified products makes this technique convenient. The production of amplified products is observed automatically by real time monitoring of fluorescence. Depending on the amount of target gene, a small signal can be produced within 30-45 min. Since the tubes do not have to be opened at the time of reaction, the risk of carry over contamination gets considerably reduced. In recent years, some commercial automated real-time PCR systems have been available (Light Cycler & TaqMan). In these systems, such as the Light Cycler TM and the Smart Cycler \u00d2 , these systems perform the real-time fluorescence monitoring by using fluorescent dyes such as SYBR-Green I, which binds non-specifically to double-stranded DNA generated during the PCR amplification. Others, such as the TaqMan, use florescent probes that bind specifically to amplification target sequences.",

These methods utilize the activity of resolvase enzymes T4 endonuclease VII, and more recently, T7 endonuclease I to digest heteroduplex DNA formed by annealing wild type and mutant DNA [9] . Mutations are indicated by the size of the various fragments. A variation of the theme involves the use of chemical agents for the same purpose [10] . Another enzymatic approach for mutation detection is the oligonucleotide ligation assay [11] . This technique involves the hybridization of two oligonucleotides to complementary DNA stretches at sites of possible mutations. The oligonucleotide primers are designed such that the 3 00 end of the first primer is immediately adjacent to the 5 00 end of the second primer. Therefore, if the first primer matches completely with the target DNA, then the primers can be ligated by DNA ligase. On the other hand, if a mismatch occurs at the 3 00 end of the first primer, then no ligation products will be obtained.",

In combination with capillary electrophoresis, SSCP and HDA analysis now provide an excellent, simple, and rapid mutation detection platform with low operation costs and, most fascinatingly, the potential of easily being automated, thus allowing for high-throughput analysis of patient's DNA. Another equally well employed technique for mutation detection is, Denaturing and Temperature Gradient Gel Electrophoresis (DGGE and TGGE, respectively). In this case, electrophoretic mobility differences between a wild type and mutant allele can be ''visualized'' in a gradient of denaturing agents, such as urea and formamide, or of increasing temperature. Lastly, an increasingly used mutation detection technique is the two-dimensional gene scanning, based on two-dimensional electrophoretic separation of amplified DNA fragments, according to their size and base pair sequence. The latter involves DGGE, following the size separation step.",

In-situ synthesized arrays are synthesized directly on the surface of the microarray made up of 1.2 cm 2 quartz wafer unlike the printed oligonucleotide arrays described above because in situ-synthesized probes are typically short (20-25 bp) , multiple probes per target are included to improve sensitivity, specificity, and statistical accuracy. Yet another type are the bead array, similar to the above mentioned printed and in situ-hybridized microarrays, Bead Arrays (Illumina, San Diego, CA) provide a patterned substrate for the high-density detection of target nucleic acids. However, instead of glass slides or silicon wafers as direct substrates, Bead Arrays rely on 3-lm silica beads that randomly self-assemble onto one of two available substrates: the Sentrix Array Matrix (SAM) or the Sentrix Bead Chip [15] . Unlike the other array the exclusive feature of Bead Arrays rely on passive transport for the hybridization of nucleic acids. One more type of array, electronic microarrays utilize active hybridization via electric fields to control nucleic acid transport. Microelectronic cartridges (NanoChip 400; Nanogen, San Diego, CA) use complementary metal oxide semiconductor technology for the electronic addressing of nucleic acids [16] . Each Nano Chip cartridge has 12 connectors that control 400 individual test sites. In contrast to the above mentioned arrays, which are 2-D based, Suspension bead arrays are essentially three-dimensional arrays based on the use of microscopic polystyrene spheres (microspheres or beads) as the solid support and flow cytometry for bead and target detection. Furthermore, they are distinct from the highdensity Illumina Bead Arrays, in which the beads are immobilized on fiber-optic strands or silicon slides. Most of the clinical diagnostic laboratories have not chosen expensive high technology infrastructure, as the number of tests expected to be performed, have not been large enough to justify the capital outlay. Therefore, simple screening tests such as SSCP and HDA were and still are the methods of choice for many clinical laboratories, as they allow for rapid and simultaneous detection of different sequence variations at a detection rate of close to 100%.",

            "text": "Although PCR has significantly facilitated the expansion of molecular diagnostics, it nonetheless has a number of limitations. First of all, it is problematic for Taq Polymerase to amplify CG repeat-rich regions which sometimes leads to the classic alternative of Southern blot analysis. Also, Taq Polymerase is error-prone at a range of 10 4 -10 5 nucleotide, which is strongly influenced by the conditions of the amplification reaction, such as magnesium or deoxyribonucleotide concentration, pH, temperature, and so on. Due to Polymerase errors there can be unspecific background, depending on the detection method, resulting in limiting the detection level. To overcome these technical problems, positive results should be confirmed by alternative methods or by using high fidelity thermo stable polymerases. Finally, it needs to be stressed that despite the wealth of mutation detection methodologies, DNA sequencing technology has immensely contributed to detection of unknown mutations. Until the late 1970s, determining the sequence of a nucleic acid containing even five or ten nucleotide was an extremely difficult and laborious task. After introduction of new technique of DNA sequencing, which includes several methods and technologies that are used for determining the order of the nucleotide bases-adenine, guanine, cytosine, and thymine-in a molecule of DNA, the knowledge of DNA sequences has become indispensable for basic biological research and in numerous applied fields such as diagnostic, biotechnology, microbiology etc. There has been significant acceleration in the field of biological research and discovery with the advent of DNA sequencing. Several microbial genomes have been sequenced using this technique. In 1977, two different methods for sequencing DNA were developed, that is, the chain termination method and the chemical degradation method. In 1976-1977, A. Maxam and W. Gilbert developed a DNA sequencing method based on chemical modification of DNA and subsequent cleavage at specific bases. This rapidly became more accepted, since purified DNA could be used directly, while the initial Sanger method required that each read start be cloned for production of single-stranded DNA. However, with the improvement of the Sanger method, Maxam-Gilbert sequencing has less popular due to its technical complexity, prohibiting its use in standard molecular biology kits, extensive use of hazardous chemicals, and difficulties with scale-up. Each of four reactions (G, A ? G, C, and C ? T). Thus a series of labeled fragments are generated, from the radio labeled end to the first ''cut'' site in each molecule. Size based separation of the fragments in the four reactions is done by parallel electrophoresis on a denaturating acrylamide gel. Visualization is done by exposure of gel to X-ray film for autoradiography, yielding a series of dark bands each corresponding to a radiolabeled DNA fragment, from which the sequence may be inferred. This method is sometimes called ''chemical sequencing'' method. The chain-terminator method or Frederick Sanger method became a popular method of DNA sequencing due to its greater efficiency and use of fewer toxic chemicals and lower amounts of radioactivity than the method of Maxam and Gilbert. The key principle of the Sanger method was the use of dideoxynucleotide triphosphates (ddNTPs) as DNA chain terminators.",

Post human genome draft publication, the major challenge, was to improve the existing mutation detection technologies to achieve robust cost effective, rapid, and high-throughput analysis of genomic variation. In the last decade, technology has improved rapidly and new mutation-detection techniques have become available, whereas old methodologies have evolved to fit into the increasing demand for automated and high throughput screening. Denaturating high performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC) used for detection of polymorphic changes of disease-causing mutations one of the new technologies that emerged. It detects the presence of a genetic variation by the differential retention of homoand heteroduplex DNA on reversed-phase chromatography under partial denaturation. DHPLC has proved to be one of the most powerful tools of mutation detection and is capable of detecting single-base substitutions, deletions, and insertions can be detected successfully by UV or fluorescence monitoring within 2-3 min in unpurified PCR products as large as 1.5-kilo bases. Another useful technique of mutation analysis is Pyro sequencing, which is a non-gel-based genotyping technology, and provides a very reliable method and an attractive alternative to DHPLC. Pyrosequencing detects de novo incorporation of nucleotides based on the specific template, causing release of a pyrophosphate, which is converted to ATP and followed by luciferase stimulation. The light produced, detected by a charge couple device camera, is translated to a pyrogram, from which the nucleotide sequence can be deducted [17] .",

There is a wider acceptance for Realtime PCR [17] due to its improved rapidity, sensitivity, and reproducibility. There is a real time detection of the PCR product during the exponential phase of the reaction, thereby combining amplification and detection in one single step. The reduced number of cycles, use of fluorogenic labels and sensitive methods of their detection has largely removed post-PCR detection procedures, making the technique sensitive. Currently, newborns can be screened for phenylketonuria and other treatable genetic diseases. In the future, we might see children at high risk for coronary artery disease getting characterized and treated to prevent changes in their vascular walls during early adulthood. In the near future, we could witness as a part of standard medical practice, the individual drug monitoring response profiles throughout life, using genetic testing for the identification of their individual DNA signature, Shortly, genetic testing will comprise a wide spectrum of different analyses with a host of consequences for individuals and their families, which is worth emphasizing when explaining molecular diagnostics to the public.",

Recently a study has developed a new oligonucleotide microarray comprising 16 identical subarrays for simultaneous rapid detection of avian viruses: avian influenza virus (AIV), Newcastle disease virus (NDV), infection bronchitis virus (IBV), and infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV) in single-and mixed-virus infections. Diagnostic effectiveness of the developed DNA microarray has been 99.18% and therefore can prove highly effective in mass survey for specific detection of AIV, NDV, IBV and IBDV circulating in the region in the course of epidemiological surveillance [27] .",

Many micro-organisms, have been identified using this technique for example Mycobacterium tuberculosis, pneumococci, meningococci and Burkholderia cenocepacia. Over 100 viruses are known to cause acute viral encephalitis in humans. There is a battery of infective states of CNS which can be accounted for by viral infections like those involving the spinal cord (myelitis), the brain stem (e.g., rhombencephalitis), the cerebellum (cerebellitis), or the cerebrum (encephalitis) and almost all acute viral infections of the CNS produce some degree of meningeal as well as parenchymal inflammation. Rarely, such as West Nile virus (WNV) meningoencephalitis or cytomegalovirus (CMV) radiculomyelitis, polymorphonuclear cells rather than lymphocytes may be the predominant cell type, and thus provide some diagnostic guidelines. Even with such a diverse symptoms routine CSF studies only rarely lead to identification of a specific etiologic agent. The entire picture of diagnosis of viral infections of CNS has changed for good now a days due to the discovery of new molecular diagnostic technologies, such as the PCR to amplify viral nucleic acid from CSF [28, 29] . The realtime multiplex PCR assay designed by researchers is extremely rapid and permits the confirmation of bacterial isolates as Brucella spp., B. abortus, or B. melitensis within 2-3 h. Further this technique has assisted in the identification of infrequently isolated Brucella species and the recognition of atypical Brucella strains by utilizing genus specific primers-probe sets. This is advantageous since the conventional methods for Brucella isolation and characterization may take days to weeks to perform and often requiring the preparation of heavy suspensions of these highly infectious pathogens [30] . Since viral disease severity and viral load are linked, use of real-time PCR quantitation has proven beneficial when studying the role of viral reactivation or persistence in the progression of disease [31] . Nonetheless, the general diagnosis of invasive diseases caused by Aspergillus fumigatus and Aspergillus flavus has been made easier by real-time PCR assays [31] . The diagnosis of efflux-mediated resistance in Pseudomonas aeruginosa has been performed by using molecular diagnostic approach. Real time PCR has helped in the detection of mexA and mexX and reverse transcription pCR for mex C and mex E, thus helping in the analysis of multidrug resistance in P. aeruginosa [28] .",

The APTIMA HIV-1 RNA Qualitative Assay and the Procleix HIV-1/HCV assay (Gen-Probe, San Diego, CA, USA) are both Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved for blood-donor screening to exclude blood from donors with acute HIV infection [34] . Transcription-mediated amplification technology is used in these two assays [35] . Infants born to mothers infected with HIV-1 have maternal antibodies directed against HIV up to 18 months of age and prevents the use of antibody-based assays for the early diagnosis of HIV infection. Such infected infants have a high morbidity and mortality in the first 2 years of life; thus, an early diagnosis is important to establish the infection status of the exposed infant in order to employ appropriate ART sufficiently early. Qualitative nucleic acid assays for the detection of HIV pro-viral DNA, viral RNA and total nucleic acid [36] , have become the methods of choice for diagnosis in infants born to HIV-1infected mothers. Cobas AmpliPrep/COBAS \u00d2 TaqMan \u00d2 HIV-1 Qualitative Test is one such test that uses 70 ll of whole blood or dry blood spot, and is directed against gag and LTR regions of HIV-1 genome.",

Primarily these fragile sites to be cloned and characterized which is accountable for the single most common form of inherited mental retardation, the Fragile X Syndrome. This syndrome, clinically well-defined by the presence of mental retardation of variable severity, modest facial dysmorphism and macroorchidism in adult males, has been documented for years as an X-linked Mendelian disorder offering abnormal and confusing features of inheritance, penetrance, cytogenetic expression and clinical variability. The mainstream of males who carry the Fragile X Mutation (FRAXA) are exaggerated by mental retardation and show a cytogenetically inducible fragile site, but 20% of obligate male carrier, the so called 'normal transmitting males', are both clinically and cytogenetically negative. Overall, characteristic can be defined by the nature of the FRAXA dynamic mutation and the inactivation of the FMR1 (Fragile X Mental Retardation 1) gene, coding for the RNA-binding protein (FMRP), typically expressed in human brain and testis. The 59 untranslated region of the FMR1 gene harbors a series of CGG triplet repeats, highly polymorphic in normal individuals; the total of these repeated units varies from 4 to about 54. A FRAXA mutation is demarcated as a 'premutation' when the repeats increase beyond the upper-normal limits to a size of about 200 triplets, characteristic of carrier females and normal transmitting males in whom, despite the structural modification, the gene is expressed and the protein is functional [42] . The altered allele transmitted by a premutated mother to her offspring scarcely ever shows small decreases of the repeats; more commonly, with a risk that is higher for larger premutations, it undertakes a process of expansion that can reach a size increase of more than 2000 repeats and is referred to as the 'full mutation' [43] .",

This is the tactic commonly selected to adopt for the molecular analysis of FRAXA mutations that is regularly done by diagnostic service as part of the different diagnosis of mental retardation of unknown cause. The other way is screened by Southern blotting of genomic DNA digested with a combination of restriction enzymes that includes methylation-sensitive rare cutters, followed by hybridization to a suitable labeled probe. This is a more time-consuming and labor-intensive procedure, it may be not as accurate in discriminating small premutations from large normal alleles, but it can be used as the only test since it ensures a reliable and complete diagnosis [44] .",

The study of the normal function of this tumor suppressor gene promises a wide gain in our knowledge of the mechanisms of gene transcription: VHL acts as a competitor of Elongin (SIII), one of the transcription elongation factors, and can modify vascular endothelial growth factor and neoangiogenesis, upon which tumor growth is dependent. The practical approach is precise for the finding of medium small-size mutations, the type of alteration commonly found in the VHL pheochromocytoma phenotype [46] . Detection is done with the procedure of PCR amplification of partially overlapping genomic DNA fragments covering the entire coding sequence of the VHL gene and including exon-flanking intronic regions. The amplification products are subjected to polyacrilamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE), for detection of deletion/insertion mutations that may change the molecular weight of the product, and to Single Strand Conformation Polymorphism (SSCP) analysis. This method, designed to specifically identify single base substitutions, is the most widely used mutation scanning technique; it is based on the tendency of single stranded DNA molecules to assume a three-dimensional conformation which is dependent on the primary sequence, is very specific and can be simply detected on a native polyacrylamide gel. DNA fragments that show size alterations on PAGE analysis or aberrant SSCP bands are subsequently subjected to direct automated sequencing to confirm and characterize the mutation. This strategy has allowed to identify different mutations, in unrelated VHL patients, and to detect case of somatic mosaicism in an asymptomatic subject [47] .",

            "text": "Cystic fibrosis (CF) is the most common autosomal recessive inherited disease in Caucasians and affects approximately 1 in 2500 individuals. It is a multifaceted disorder that influence Pulmonary, Pancreatic, Gastro-intestinal, and Reproductive organ system. The pathological processes influencing these organ systems happen due to mutations in the CFTR gene which encodes the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator, a membrane chloride channel present in the apical membrane of secretory epithelia. The CFTR protein is a cyclic-AMP dependent channel, activation of protein kinase A occurs when there is increase in levels of c-AMP inside a secretory epithelial cell ultimately it binds to the phosphorylation site on the (regulatory) R-domain of the CFTR protein thus opening the channel. The CFTR chloride channel essentially works as an electrostatic attractant by directing intracellular and extracellular anions toward positively charged transmembrane domains inside the channel. The CFTR protein includes 12 transmembrane (TM) domains. Two of these (TM1 and TM6) attract and bind chloride (and/or bicarbonate) ions. After binding chloride ions to these sites in the pore, the mutual repulsion hastens expulsion of the ions from the cell [48] . When CFTR is activated in general, chloride ions are secreted out of the cell. But, additionally with chloride ion secretion, the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) is also inhibited by CFTR (Konig et al. 2001) , and less sodium is absorbed into the cell, maintaining a higher combined ionic gradient to allow water to depart the cell by osmosis providing fluid for epithelial tissue secretions. In cystic fibrosis these mucus secretions become hyperviscous that accounts for the main features of cystic fibrosis. There are more than 1950 individual CFTR mutations in recent times reported to cause CF (http://www.genet.sickkids.on.ca/cftr/app and http://www.hgmd.cf.ac.uk/ac/index.php). These are inactivating (loss of function) mutations and include deletions, insertions, splice site mutations, nonsense mutations as well as more than 650 missense mutations. The severity and appearance of the disease may depend on the type of mutation [49] .",

            "text": "The main pathogenetic event in TSEs is the conformational change of a host protein, cellular PrP (PrPc), encoded by the prion gene PRNP, into a pathological isoform. This conformer, called PrPSc (after its first identification in experimentally scrapie-infected rodents) aggregates into amyloid fibrils and accumulates into neural and, often, lymphoreticular cells [61] . Although blood taken from vCJD patients and inoculated into susceptible mice does not always cause disease, it is still possible that low level of infectivity and, as a consequence, PrP Sc might be present in blood. Further efficiency and species barrier may upset its manifestations. Numerous Animal studies have shown that the pathogenesis of TSE as after experimental inoculation of rodents/Mice with TSE agents, PrP Sc is characteristically noticeable in the CNS weeks before the expression of disease and its level augments until the animal dies. As the rise of PrP Sc corresponds to that of infectivity, PrP Sc is commonly used as a surrogate marker for assessing the amount of infectivity in biological samples. The ratio of infectivity and PrP Sc is relatively constant in the hamster brain experimentally infected with the 263 K strain of scrapie at a mean value of *105-106 protein molecules for one lethal dose 50 (LD50) [62] . But recently few techniques at pre-clinical levels have sufficient potency to be proved as good biomarkers as they can detect very low levels of these proteins like chemicophysical precipitation based protocols, affinity chromatography or affinity precipitation techniques. The amended isolation method for PrP Sc with sodium phosphotungstate [63] , and novel molecules plasminogen, and protocadherin-2 binding with high affinity to PrP Sc , might enhance new expectations for preclinical diagnosis of TSEs. Among the immunological methods of PrPSc screening, western blotting is mainly characterized and widely validated method. It offers the advantage of recognizing different forms of PrPSc through the analysis of the molecular mass and the relative abundance of di-, mono-and non-glycosylated bands. These parameters characterize the so-called PrP glycotype, a kind of 'PrP signature', which varies among different forms of TSEs. PrPSc glycotyping has been projected for differentiating various forms of TSEs (e.g., scrapie from BSE, sporadic from variant CJD and for improving the classification of human TSEs. In sporadic CJD, for example, the combination of the two most frequent PrPSc glycotypes (I and II) with the three possible genotypes of PrP at the polymorphic codon 129 (methionine homozygous, valine homozygous, or heterozygous) enables the sub classification of this form into six distinct groups, each of which presents distinct clinical and pathological features [64] . But this technique is time consuming and only few samples can be assessed at a time so ELISA can overcome these problems. Further development and up gradation in immune assay in the form of Dissociation-enhanced lanthanide fluorescence immunoassay/conformation-dependent immunoassay (DELFIA/CDI) is the latest-generation immunoassay with an ELISA format, where the detection system is sensitive time-resolved lanthanide fluorescence instead of chemiluminescence. It can measure picograms (10-12 g) of PrPSc per ml and thus represents one of the most sensitive technique for the detection of PrPSc [65] . Further one more technique MUFS (Multi-Spectral Ultraviolet Fluorescence Spectroscopy) characterizes proteins by their specific fluorescent pattern of emission when they are excited by ultraviolet radiation and bypasses the need for pre-treatment steps to eliminate PrPc or for antibody binding. It has the potential to discriminate cellular from pathological prion protein, and various forms of PrPSc from different strains. Moreover most sensitive and specific technique which uses fluorescent antibody with confocal microscopy in FCS (Fluorescence Correlation Spectroscopy) which recognizes single fluorescent molecules in solution as they pass between the exciting laser beam and the objective of a confocal microscope, equipped with a single-photon counter. It is performed quickly and requires only small amounts of samples. The assay solution is mixed with anti-PrP antibodies tagged with fluorophores that bind strongly to PrPSc aggregates, which become highly fluorescent and easily visible against the background of monomeric PrPc. This technique is *20-fold more sensitive than western blot and was able to detect, for the first time, PrPSc in the CSF of *20% of CJD patients. Further 14-3-3 proteins were also detected in the CSF of patients with genetic CJD carrying the codon 200 or the codon 210 mutation of the PRNP gene, in *50% of CSF samples taken from patients with vCJD. Further proteins released in the CSF after cerebral damage, such as tau, neuron-specific enolase (NSE), and S-100, are also increased in CJD patients, although their specificity, sensitivity and predictive values are always inferior, or at most equal, to those of 14-3-3 proteins. Genetic susceptibility to the disease is also seen in sporadic and iatrogenic CJD where *70% of affected individuals are homozygous for methionine at the polymorphic 129 site of PrP (The EUROCJD Group 2001) in vCJD, 100% of patients are methionine homozygous [66] . This susceptibility, however, cannot be used to predict who will develop the disease since *40% of the Caucasian population is methionine homozygous. (The EUROCJD Group 2001) The finding of a PrP-like gene (PRNDgene) located downstream from the PrP gene in mammalian species has provided hope that PRND and its encoded protein (Doppel, Dpl) contributes to the pathogenesis of TSEs, and be of help in the recognition of at-risk individuals.",

The pathological hallmarks of AD include deposition of extracellular amyloid plaques, cerebrovascular amyloidosis and intracellular (Neurofibrillary tangles) NFTs. NFTs are made by hyper-phosphorylation of the microtubule-associated protein tau (MAPT), while proteolytic processing of the Amyloid beta Precursor Protein (APP) generates the neurotoxic Ab peptide, which has been involved in the formation of neuritic amyloid plaques. Recently Salvadores et al. defined a very sensitive method for biochemical diagnosis of AD based on specific detection of misfolded Ab oligomers. They were able to distinguish AD patients from control individuals influenced by a variety of other neurodegenerative disorders or no degenerative neurological diseases with overall sensitivity of 90% and specificity of 92%. The protein misfolding cyclic amplification assay (Ab-PMCA), utilizes the functional property of Ab oligomers to seed the polymerization of monomeric Ab. Ab-PMCA allowed detection of as little as 3 fmol of Ab oligomers. These findings provide the proof-of-principle basis for developing a highly sensitive and specific biochemical test for AD diagnosis [67] .",

This wide diversity is pin-pointed by the fact that HCM may be seen in all phases of life, from the new-born to the elderly. The clinical course is extremely variable, with few patients remaining asymptomatic throughout life and others developing severe symptoms of heart failure, few die prematurely, either suddenly (often in the absence of prior symptoms) or owing to progressive heart failure. It has been marked, even from the preliminary descriptions of the disease, that HCM is commonly inherited as a Mendelian autosomal dominant trait [69] . HCM can be caused by a mutation in any 1 of 5 genes that encode proteins of the cardiac sarcomere: b-myosin heavy chain (on chromosome 14), cardiac troponin T (chromosome 1troponin I (chromosome 19), a-tropomyosin (chromosome 15), and cardiac myosin-binding protein C (chromosome 11). Moreover, mutations in 2 genes encoding crucial and regulatory myosin light chains have been reported in what may be an extremely rare form of HCM. This genetic diversity is further compounded by intragenic heterogeneity, with a total of more than 100 individual diseasecausing mutations identified for these genes. Available data support that mutations in the b-myosin heavy chain gene (myosin is the primary contractile protein in thick filaments of myofibrils) may responsible for as much as 35% of familial HCM. All the known genetic myosin defects have proved to be missense mutations [70] . Cardiac troponin T mutations [71] , responsible for an estimated 10-20% of familial HCM. Troponin T binds the troponin complex to tropomyosin and plays a major role in calcium regulation of cardiac contraction and relaxation.",

Presently, there are three key LQTS genes (KCNQ1, KCNH2, and SCN5A) that provide explanation for approximately 75% of the disorder. For the major LQTS genotypes, genotype-phenotype correlations of gene-specific arrhythmogenic triggers, electrocardiogram (ECG) patterns, response to therapies, and intragenic and increasingly mutation-specific risk stratification.

The primary defect responsible for MFS, first described in 1991, resides in a gene (FBN1) localized to the long arm of chromosome 15 encoding the connective tissue protein fibrillin-1 [73] . Fibrillin is a structural glycoprotein component of microfibrils, which are extracellular components that participate in the formation of mature elastic fibers and which provide structural functions independent of elastin.

Thus persistent progress in molecular research has quite simplified the puzzle although its pathogenesis is still in infancy in various cancers. Cancer is a change in the cellular processes that cause a tumour to grow out of control. Cancerous cells sometimes have mutations in oncogenes, such as KRAS and CTNNB1 (b-catenin) [75] . Analyzing the molecular signature of cancerous cells, the DNA and its levels of expression via messenger RNA enables physicians to characterize the cancer and to choose the best therapy for their patients.

Two histone modifiers HAT p300 and HDM EZH2 are promising PCa biomarkers which have shown to be over expressed in PCa and its expression levels precisely linked with different disease stages.

Three known lncRNAs which have validated their significance in detecting, screening and monitoring PCa [80] , because of their high specificity and sensitivity are PCa non coding RNA-1 (PRNCR1), prostate-specific gene 1 (PSGEM1), and PCa antigen 3 (PCA3); also referred to as differential display 3 (DD3). Recently it has also been proposed that PCGEM1 gene, which encodes a lncRNA is highly prostate-specific. Moreover, the screening of TMPRSS2-ERG fusion (TEF) techniques as examined by Immunohistochemistry, FISH and RT PCR found to have significance in the diagnosis PCa. However the TE fusion in combination with PCA3 mRNA may prove more beneficial in diagnosis [81] . Circulating microRNAs (miRNA) have newly been supposed to be biomarkers for non-invasive diagnosis in various tumors [82] . Several gene expression studies also reported altered interleukins expressionin prostate cancer patients [83] . These differentially regulated miRNAs lead to changes in the expression and activity of their targets in PCa. The miRNA expression changes with the development and progression of PCa as some of the cancer-related genes are regulated by them and thus its dysregulation has significance in PCa. Using a mouse xenograft model, Mitchell et al. [84] have demonstrated that miRNAs originated from the human PCa xenografts enter the circulation and thus reported that miR-141 is up regulated in sera of metastatic PCa patients which can distinguish PCa patients from healthy controls with high sensitivity and more accuracy.",

The number of deaths was 21.2 per 100,000 women per year. These rates are ageadjusted and based on 2010-2014 cases and deaths. (National Cancer Institute stats report https://seer.cancer.gov/ statfacts/html/breast.html). The more typical approach to breast cancer diagnostics via hormone receptor analysis is IHC. IHC involves the use of antibodies and enzymes, such as horseradish peroxidase, to stain tissue sections for the tumor antigens of interest. This analysis method can be performed on either frozen or formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue, as well as on small amounts of tissue acquired in procedures such as core biopsies. IHC also has the advantage of not only determining the percentage of positive nuclei but also the intensity of staining in individual nuclei. Unfortunately, in addition to a lack of inter laboratory standardization of the IHC technique, the process for characterizing the positivity of either ER or PR staining is performed subjectively by a pathologist, thereby introducing variability in interpretation. Regardless of this subjectivity in staining intensity, IHC is by far the most common approach to evaluating hormone status in breast cancer today. Another major prognostic marker that is currently recommended for the evaluation of primary invasive breast cancer is the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2, also known as HER2. HER2 is an oncogene belonging to the EGF receptor (EGFR) family. Gene amplification of HER2 has been shown to occur in 10-40% of primary tumors and HER2 protein over expression is found in almost 25% of breast cancers [93] .",

Non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) explains for 80-85% of all lung cancers, with lung adenocarcinoma being the most typical histologic type in the United States. Enhancements in our knowledge of molecular alterations at multiple levels (genetic, epigenetic, protein expression) and their functional importance have the potential to impact lung cancer diagnosis, prognostication and treatment. In lung cancer as in other malignancies, tumourigenesis narrates to activation of growth promoting proteins [e.g., v-Kiras2 Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (KRAS), epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), BRAF, MEK-1, HER2, MET, ALK and rearranged during transfection (RET)] as well as inactivation of tumour suppressor genes [e.g., P53, phosphatase with tensin homology (PTEN), LKB-1 [100] . Lung cancers have extremely complex genomes with a recent large scale exome sequencing study of 31 non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) identifying 727 mutated genes not previously described in the literature or in the COSMIC database. Genomic studies have established previously well-known alterations in lung cancer such as KRAS, EGFR and BRAF and also identified low frequency but recurrent mutations that are novel in lung cancer including potentially targetable alterations in JAK2, ERBB4, RET, fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1), and discoidin domain receptor 2 (DDR2) [101] . Lung cancer mutations have been recognized in v-Ki-ras2 Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (KRAS), epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), BRAF and the parallel phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3 K) pathway oncogenes and more recently in MEK and HER2 while structural rearrangements in ALK, ROS1 and possibly rearranged during transfection (RET) provide new therapeutic targets. Amplification is another mechanism of activation of oncogenes such as MET in adenocarcinoma, fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1) and discoidin domain receptor 2 (DDR2) in SCC.",

The occurrence of these molecular targets as labelled above now defines the characteristics of NSCLC, with EGFR mutation and ALK rearrangements being the most clinically relevant at present. The prevalence of these mutations varies in lung cancer arising from patient in different regions. Activating EGFR mutations were found in up to 20% of Caucasians while in the Asian populations these EGFR mutations can be present in up to 40% of patients with NSCLC. These ethnic difference in NSCLC properties seems to be not limited to the presence of activating EGFR mutations but is also evident in other driver oncogenic mutation profiles (including ALK, KRAS, MET etc.), histology and hence tumour response to targeted therapy treatment. The presence of these driver mutations is normally found to be mutually exclusive to others in the same tumour [102] . In lung ADC among Asians, ALK rearrangement is seen in up to 7% of patients with lung ADC. Based on current reports of therapeutic molecular targets of EGFR mutation and ALK gene rearrangement in NSCLC and the availability of corresponding targeted agents, an algorithm of testing for molecular targets in NSCLC is proposed, which signifies a stepwise approach to testing for individual targets, beginning with EGFR then, if negative, ALK fusion gene or other potential targets if appropriate. Among NSCLC, adenocarcinoma accounts for up to 80% of histological subtypes. There are previous reports of correlations between histological subtypes of ADC demonstrating micropapillary features with presence of activating EGFR mutations, leading to the suggestions that the presence of specific mutations in NSCLC in fact represent heterogeneity in cancer biology and also response to therapy [103] . Given the heterogeneity of lung cancer histology, however, histological subtypes are hard to be used as the sole reliable marker for guidance to molecular phenotyping and selection of targeted therapy. Targeting therapeutic oncogenic mutations like EGFR and ALK can give dramatic initial treatment response or at least an initial stable clinical disease.",

The practise of such biomarkers as adjuncts to routine histopatholoigical assessment may help prognostication and effective management of PMLs but their routine use is still hindered by the cost and complexity of the tests, the lack of facilities in some laboratories, and limited outcome studies to date. More readily available markers, such as those of cell proliferation (Ki-67 antigen) and apoptosis (Bax, Bcl-2), may also play a diagnostic role: apoptotic Bcl-2 expression de-creases significantly in dysplastic and early invasive lesions and then increases almost to normal tissue level in consequent stages while Ki-67 expression increases sharply in initial stages of OSCC, but significantly decreases in later stages [104] .",

Forensic science has since shown that saliva can contain a number of messenger ribo-nucleic acid (mRNA) fragments including salivary specific statherin, histatin 3, and the proline-rich proteins PRB1, PRB2 and PRB3, as well as the ubiquitously expressed spermidine N1 acetyl transferase (SAT), b-actin, and glyceraldehyde-3-phos-phate dehydrogenase (GAPDH). The mRNAs in saliva such as b-actin, SAT and interleukin-8 are relatively stable despite the presence of salivary ribonucleases. mRNAs in saliva have been tested in over 300 saliva samples from OSCC patients and healthy people, and the signature was always present in higher levels in the saliva of OSCC patients than in saliva from healthy people, with an overall accuracy rate of about 85%. Four salivary mRNAs (OLF/EBF associated zinc finger protein [OAZ], SAT, IL8, and IL1b) collectively have a discriminatory power of 91% sensitivity and specificity for OSCC detection [108] . Seven mRNA molecules: transcripts of: 1. IL8 (interleukin 8) playing a role in angiogenesis; replication; calcium-mediated signaling pathway; cell adhesion; chemotaxis; cell cycle arrest; immune response, 2. IL1B (interleukin 1B) which takes part in signal transduction; proliferation, inflammation and apoptosis 3. DUSP1 (dual specificity phosphatase 1) with a role in protein modification; signal transduction and oxidative stress, 4. H3F3A (H3 histone, family 3A) having a DNA binding activity, 5. OAZ1 (ornithine decarboxylase antizyme 1) taking part in polyamine biosynthesis 6. S100P (S100 calcium binding protein P) with a role in protein binding and calcium ion binding, and 7. SAT (spermidine/ spermine N1-acetyltransferase) which takes part in enzyme and transferase activity were found significantly elevated in OSCC patients rather than in healthy controls [109] . Now, genetics has become the driving force in medical research and is now ready for integration into medical practice. Human genome draft (bio-informatics) with advancement in current techniques now opens new vistas in the fields of novel therapeutics such as Pharmacogenomics, Nutrigenomics that may transform the management of untreated disease and disorders [110] [111] [112] .",

Moreover, when it does work, it may cause adverse side effects, even death, in a small number of patients. Although large individual variability in drug efficacy and safety has been known to exist since the establishment of human medicine but the cause was beyond to knowledge. On the other hand, the request to overcome such variation has received more consideration now after the draft of human genome than ever before. The human genome sequence offers a special record of human evolution that varies among populations and individuals. Sequence variations in drug target proteins, drug-metabolizing enzymes, and drug transporters can alter drug efficacy, drug side effects, or both to cause variable drug responses in individual patients. From this prospect, the availability of the complete human genome sequence has made it possible to analyse the influence of variations of the human genome sequence on the pathogenesis of significant diseases and the response to drug therapy at an accelerating rate in recent years. The fast build-up of knowledge on genome-disease and genome-drug interactions has also encouraged the transformation of pharmacogenetics into a new entity of human genetics, pharmacogenomics and, at the same time, provided a rationale for the hope that individualized medicine can be achieved in the near future [113, 114] .",

As The double mutation, A to T transversion at 1762 and G to A transition at 1764, is often present in patients with chronic hepatitis, hepatocellular carcinoma, and hepatitis and less often in asymptomatic carriers, in immunosuppressed patients, and in carriers without HBV markers. Further, individual drug responses can be forecasted from known genetic variances correlated with a drug effect, like drug response of Maraviroc efficacy depends on CCR5 alleles in HIV-1 infections and Interferon-alpha drug efficacy also decided by the alleles of IL28B in Hepatitis C infections [115] . Thus, this will allow the physician to decide the patient with a selective drug treatment.",

Further, Nutrigenomics is also evolving and promising a better management of patients. Several bioactive food components, including both essential and nonessential nutrients, can regulate gene expression patterns. Thus, nutrigenomics is providing the effects of ingested nutrients and other food components on gene expression and gene regulation, i.e. diet-gene interaction in order to spot the dietetic components having beneficial or detrimental health effects. Nutritional genomics (nutrigenomics), the junction between health, diet, and genomics, is influenced via epigenetic, transcriptomics, and proteomics processes of biology. Thus, it will help in determining the individual nutritional requirements based on the genetic makeup of the person (personalized diet) as well as the association between diet and chronic diseases like cancer, opening new vistas to understanding the complexity of various diseases [116] .",

Molecular diagnostic offers physicians with critical information based on the early exploration of pathogens and subtle changes in patients' genes and chromosomes, allowing for earlier diagnosis, selection of appropriate therapies and monitoring of disease progression. A wide range of molecular based tests is available to evaluate DNA difference and changes in gene expression of patient DNA and RNA through Real-Time PCR, FISH and Sequencing Technologies [117] . Further, the complex relationship between diseases like Fertility and Obesity or Metabolic syndrome with Cancer have also gained momentum due to exploration of common pathways, that only become possible of due to such advancement in molecular techniques [118] . However, there are many obstacles to overcome before the execution of these tests in clinical laboratories, such as which test to employ, the choice of technology and equipment, and issues such as cost-effectiveness, accuracy, reproducibility i.e. robustness, personnel training etc. Currently PCR-based testing outweigh; however, alternative technologies aimed to explore genome complexity without PCR are anticipated to gain momentum in the coming years as sequencing devices are more costly at present. Furthermore, development of integrated silicon chips mounted with biomolecules is now going to change the concept of traditional wet lab to ''lab-on-a-chip''. Thus it would be possible to analyse thousands of genes/proteins in hours from low amount/single cell sample. Thus coming era will be revolutionary, it will not only going to change our diagnostic systems but also plan of treatment and therapy [119, 120] .",

These now include exploration of large unknown CFTR rearrangements, including large deletions, insertions and duplications, by semi-quantitative PCR experiments, i.e. Multiplex Ligation-dependant Probe Amplification CFTR mutations may be missed by scanning techniques, especially when homozygous, and even direct sequencing cannot identify 100% of mutations [50]. Undetected CFTR mutations may penetrate deep within introns or regulatory regions which are not generally analyzed. For example 3849 ? 10kbC [ T (c.3718-2477C [ T) and 1811 ? 1.6kbA [ G (c.",
