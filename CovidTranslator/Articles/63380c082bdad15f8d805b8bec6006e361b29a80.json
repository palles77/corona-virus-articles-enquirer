            "text": "Infection of skeletal muscle (infectious myositis) is uncommon. When it occurs, a wide range of organisms may be responsible: bacteria, mycobacteria, fungi, viruses, and parasitic agents. 1 Bacteria invade muscle either from contiguous sites of infection (e.g., skin and subcutaneous abscesses, penetrating wounds, decubitus ulcers, osteomyelitis) or by hematogenous spread from a distant focus. It is helpful to categorize infectious myositis on the basis of clinical manifestations. These may be very distinctive, as in clostridial gas gangrene, and suggest the specific etiologic agent, or they may be very nonspecific, as in the myalgias of viral infections and infective endocarditis (Table  96 -1). In certain instances (e.g., psoas abscess), it is the anatomic location rather than the morphologic characteristics of the lesion or the nature of the infecting agent that distinguishes the particular type of muscle infection.",

            "text": "Bacterial infections of muscle usually occur after a penetrating wound, prolonged vascular insufficiency in an extremity, or a contiguous infection. Bacteremic spread of infection to skeletal muscle is extremely uncommon. Among fatal cases of staphylococcal septicemia, abscesses in skeletal muscle are found in less than 1%. 2 Pyomyositis (primary muscle abscess) is a bacterial infection of muscle that occurs in the absence of a predisposing site of infection. S. aureus is the most common cause. 3, 4 Blood cultures are positive in 5% to 35% of the cases in most series at the time of presentation; metastatic infections in tissue other than muscle are rare, although the development of venous thrombosis and septic pulmonary emboli has been reported. 5 In individual patients with multifocal infections or associated endocarditis, it may be challenging to clarify whether sustained bacteremia was the primary process or the result of progressive pyomyositis. 6 Most cases of pyomyositis occur in the tropics, hence the term tropical pyomyositis. Historically, it accounted for 1% to 4% of hospital admissions in some tropical areas, 7 although recently in northern India pyomyositis accounted for only 0.03% of admissions. 8 In more temperate areas, pyomyositis is very uncommon, with approximately 330 reported cases in the United States between 1981 and 2002 4 and a reported incidence of 0.5/100,000 annually in Australia. 6 Pyomyositis occurs at all ages, in the tropics more frequently among children, but in North America more often in adults and the elderly. 4, 9 No convincing evidence relates pyomyositis causally to predisposing Definition \u2022 Myositis is an inflammatory and generally necrotizing process primarily due to hematogenous seeding of muscle with subsequent bacterial invasion. Direct inoculation of muscle as the result of penetrating trauma is also an important mechanism of infection (associated with clostridial myonecrosis). More generalized muscle inflammation may also accompany a variety of acute and chronic viral and parasitic disorders.",

The findings of associated toxic shock mandate the addition of a protein synthesis inhibitor (e.g., clindamycin) and possibly intravenous immunoglobulin therapy. Narrow-spectrum therapy is appropriate after identification and sensitivity testing of the isolated pathogen. Patients presenting with the clinical findings of gas gangrene (clostridial myonecrosis) require immediate high-dose penicillin and clindamycin and urgent surgical exploration.

Pyomyositis has been reported in growing numbers of intravenous drug abusers (with or without HIV infection) caused primarily by S. aureus but also by streptococci, gram-negative bacilli, or multiple organisms (including anaerobes). 17 Pyomyositis is a rare complication of bacterial endocarditis and has been reported in an intravenous drug abuser who had left-sided S. aureus endocarditis. 6, 18 The presumed pathogenesis of (primary) pyomyositis involves previous bacteremia, commonly asymptomatic and transient. Because muscle trauma (locus minoris resistentiae) is necessary to produce pyomyositis in experimental animals after intravenous injection of S. aureus, 19 a role for local mechanical injury has been hypothesized. Secondary pyomyositis reflects spread of infection from a contiguous source, typically a site of hematogenous osteomyelitis. The frequency of pyomyositis complicating staphylococcal osteomyelitis may be increased in community-acquired methicillin-resistant S. aureus strains expressing Panton-Valentine leukocidin 20 and, in general, molecular features of distinct S. aureus clones correlate with superficial or invasive clinical syndromes. 21 ",

            "text": "S. aureus is responsible for 95% of tropical pyomyositis cases while in temperate areas, S. aureus is the cause of 66% to 70% of cases. 4, 9 Group A streptococci account for 1% to 5% of the cases. Other gram-positive organisms uncommonly implicated in pyomyositis include various streptococci (groups B, C, and G), Streptococcus pneumoniae, 30 Enterococcus faecalis, 31 and Streptococcus anginosus. 32 Myositis due to viridans streptococci complicating the viridans streptococcal sepsis syndrome in acute myelogenous leukemia has been reported. 33 37 Veillonella spp., oral anaerobic streptococci, 38 Capnocytophaga sputigena, 39 actinomycetes, and Clostridium septicum) have been the cause in several cases. Pyomyositis may be caused by mixed pathogens, especially in patients with diabetes in whom, in addition to S. aureus, gram-negative or anaerobic pathogens, or both, were recovered in approximately 35% of episodes. 40 In the past, Burkholderia mallei and Burkholderia pseudomallei have very rarely caused muscle abscesses in the septicemic or chronic suppurative forms of glanders and melioidosis, respectively. Aspergillus fumigatus has caused a localized muscle abscess in rare patients with myelodysplasia or AIDS and in patients who have received corticosteroids. Pathogenic yeasts can cause myositis on rare occasions. Pyomyositis due to Cryptococcus neoformans was reported in an immunocompromised host, 41 and multifocal Histoplasma capsulatum nodular myositis was identified in an HIV-infected patient. 42 Hematogenously disseminated candidiasis in neutropenic area is indurated or has a wooden consistency. This stage is often overlooked. Because the initial swelling is firm and pain is not striking, and/or involves deep muscles not easily assessed at the bedside, attention is directed away from an infectious cause. Aspiration, if attempted, yields no pus. The second, or suppurative, stage occurs 10 to 21 or more days later, and this is the time when most patients are diagnosed. The patient is febrile, and distinct muscle tenderness and swelling (conforming to the involved muscle) are present. The overlying skin is intact and warm, and erythema is commonly absent. At this point, pus can be aspirated from the involved muscle. In the third stage, systemic manifestations of sepsis and local findings of erythema, exquisite tenderness, and fluctuance are striking. If untreated, the infection can progress to metastatic abscesses, shock, renal failure, and death 22 ; the overall mortality rate is approximately 5% 4 and is largely associated with the presence of severe sepsis and septic shock. 4 The progression of pyomyositis from the initial invasive stage, associated with muscle inflammation and swelling, to the suppurative stage, with focal abscess formation, was documented by serial imaging in a patient whose infection was initially managed with antibiotic therapy. 23 Occasionally, the onset is acute rather than subacute, with malaise, chills, and high fever. Rarely, the clinical picture is combined with that of toxic shock syndrome. 24, 25 This is a particular risk of myositis caused by group A \u03b2-hemolytic streptococci (see later discussion). Because the muscle abscesses are contained by the overlying fascia, local erythema and warmth may be minimal and the severity of the process not appreciated until the infection extends to the subcutaneous tissues some days to weeks later. Regional lymphadenitis is not a feature. Usually only a single muscle group is involved, but multiple muscle abscesses may be present at presentation 26 or develop after contiguous spread (e.g., from the psoas to the thigh adductors 27 ). The most frequent sites of involvement are the large muscles of the lower extremities (e.g., quadriceps femoris, gluteus group) and the trunk muscles, but a variety of other muscles can be involved ( Fig. 96-1) . Involvement of the abdominal muscles is uncommon but noteworthy because it may mimic an acute abdomen. 28 Even in fatal cases, the diagnosis may be overlooked and involvement of superficial muscles may be missed at autopsy. 22 Leukocytosis is prominent; eosinophilia is common in patients with tropical pyomyositis (even in the presence of a prominent A B muscle edema and localizes the presence of focal abscess formation with great precision. MRI can demonstrate enlargement of involved muscles and a slight increase in signal intensity on T1-weighted images in the involved area, with a hypointense central area and a surrounding gadolinium-enhanced rim. It also shows a diffuse increase in signal intensity on T2-weighted images, with a central high-signal-intensity fluid collection surrounded by a low-intensity rim. 54 Computed tomography (CT) is a more readily available cross-sectional modality, often performed during emergency department evaluation that provides less anatomic detail at the inflammatory stage of myositis but is helpful when used to guide percutaneous drainage of an established muscle abscess. CT can reveal low-density areas with loss of muscle planes, central fluid collection, and a surrounding rim of contrast enhancement characteristic of pyomyositis. 53 Enlargement of the involved muscle is usually evident. Superimposed cellulitis may sometimes be evident on CT, namely, skin thickening, stranding of subcutaneous fat with blurring of fat and fascial planes, and subcutaneous venous distention. Radionuclide imaging using indium 111-labeled leukocytes, sometimes performed as dual SPECT (single-photon emission CT)/CT, provides functional and anatomic detail but has not been compared directly with MRI regarding predictive value or cost. 55",

            "text": "Drainage of all established abscesses is essential, and selection of open or percutaneous drainage via ultrasound or CT guidance depends on the abscess location, size, and complexity and the available expertise. Initial antibiotic therapy should consist of empirical intravenous vancomycin because of the preponderance of S. aureus isolates from these abscesses and the frequent and increasing incidence of methicillinresistant S. aureus. In compromised hosts or patients with severe disease, empirical high-dose broad-spectrum therapy effective against gram-negative pathogens and anaerobes should be added initially (e.g., \u03b2-lactam/\u03b2-lactam inhibitor combination such as piperacillintazobactam or a carbapenem such as meropenem). Early modification of initial antimicrobial therapy is based on interpretation of a Gram stain of pus and subsequent cultures and susceptibility testing. If a group A streptococcus is isolated, treatment should be changed to high-dose penicillin G and clindamycin (see later discussion). Continued fever after surgical or percutaneous needle drainage of a muscle abscess while the patient is receiving appropriate antimicrobial therapy suggests the presence of other undrained suppurative foci; relapsing or recurrent pyomyositis is frequent among patients with advanced HIV infection. 4 Pyomyositis may be complicated by a compartment syndrome, particularly if it occurs in the forearm 56 or anterior tibial compartments, 57 and may require surgical drainage, fasciotomies, and d\u00e9bridement beyond simple percutaneous drainage. The prognosis after definitive treatment of pyomyositis is excellent, unless staphylococcal or streptococcal infection is complicated by the presence of toxic shock syndrome. 24, 25 The multiorgan failure associated with established toxic shock carries a disturbingly high mortality rate. In the absence of toxic shock, definitive drainage accompanied by prolonged effective antibiotic therapy usually leads to complete resolution of infection with little or no long-term morbidity, even in immunocompromised individuals. Delays in diagnosis and definitive drainage (when drainage is necessary) have led to muscle fibrosis, with the need for widespread excision, and subsequent functional disability.",

The scattered Candida abscesses in the muscle are generally too small to localize by symptoms and physical examination, but myositis in these patients is often accompanied by small, tender, erythematous, hematogenously disseminated skin lesions. Punch biopsy of a skin lesion shows numerous Candida organisms in the dermis. Larger candidal lesions may be identified and managed using conventional imaging approaches. 43 Tuberculous pyomyositis is a rare form of extrapulmonary tuberculosis recognized in both competent 44 and immunocompromised 45 hosts and can present with or without features of disseminated disease. 44 Pyomyositis due to M. avium complex is occasionally diagnosed in HIVinfected patients, sometimes as part of the immune reconstitution syndrome, 46 and Mycobacterium haemophilum pyomyositis was observed in a renal transplant recipient. 47 Extrapulmonary Pneumocystis jirovecii infection is relatively uncommon in patients with AIDS, but in one patient it manifested as an intramuscular, localized, painful thigh swelling with typical granulomatous histopathology. 48 ",

            "text": "Early in the course of pyomyositis, other diagnoses may be suspected, particularly in nontropical areas: fever of obscure origin (in the early phase, when localizing findings may be minimal or absent), osteomyelitis, septic arthritis, appendicitis or diverticulitis, muscle strain, contusion or hematoma, muscle rupture, and thrombophlebitis. Iliopsoas myositis has mimicked appendicitis 49 ; obturator internus, iliacus, and rarely obturator externus pyomyositises have mimicked septic arthritis of the hip 50 ; and pyriformis muscle pyomyositis has simulated an epidural abscess because of severe back and radiating (sciatic) leg pain. 51 Pyomyositis involving these deep pelvic muscles may be difficult to diagnose in patients with active joint disease such as rheumatoid arthritis in whom symptoms may readily be attributed to the primary disease. Muscle infarction is an uncommon condition that occurs most frequently in the quadriceps muscle in patients with poorly controlled diabetes with nephropathy, neuropathy, and hypertension. It may suggest pyomyositis because of the acute onset of pain and presence of tender local swelling, but, in contrast to pyomyositis, fever is absent. 52 In the patient with multiple sites of muscle involvement and eosinophilia (from incidental parasitic infestation), the picture may initially suggest trichinosis. Rupture of the muscle abscess through the fascia into subcutaneous tissues may suggest the diagnosis of cellulitis. The presence of a slowly enlarging, painful mass in an extremity of a patient with only low-grade fever may suggest the diagnosis of sarcoma. Pyomyositis of the pectoral muscle can pose a particular diagnostic problem because it must be distinguished not only from muscle rupture, hematoma, and sarcoma but also from cryptic abscessed subpectoral nodes complicating infection of the ipsilateral thumb or index finger. Streptococcal necrotizing fasciitis, like gangrenous streptococcal myositis, manifests initially as local pain disproportionate to any physical findings. Localized swelling, tenderness, and erythema ensue, but only in advanced stages are the characteristic violaceous skin changes, bullae, and frank skin necrosis seen overlying areas of fascial necrosis. Rapid frozen-section biopsy or surgical exploration may be needed to distinguish among these processes.",

Plain radiographs can demonstrate focal soft tissue swelling, the presence of gas in the soft tissues, and any primary skeletal abnormalities (e.g., osteomyelitis, osteosarcoma). Ultrasonography is readily accessible and can demonstrate muscle enlargement in the initial stage of pyomyositis; it can also show the presence of focal abscess formation in the suppurative stage of disease, revealing hypoechoic areas with internal echoes, 53 especially if symptoms are localized in an extremity. Ultrasound assessment of the hip can detect the presence of a joint effusion, but it may be less sensitive in assessing the deep pelvic musculature.

            "text": "Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has proved invaluable in the assessment of patients with pyomyositis because it identifies focal particularly after bowel or biliary tract surgery 66 or septic abortion; and (4) arterial insufficiency in an extremity. 67 Rare cases of gas gangrene have occurred after parenteral injection of medication, including aqueous epinephrine 68 ; subcutaneous insulin administration 69 ; and parenteral injection of methamphetamine or heroin. 70 Fulminant gas gangrene has complicated routine venipuncture 67 or platelet infusions 71 in patients with granulocytopenia. C. perfringens organisms usually are present in large numbers as normal flora in human feces and therefore can endogenously contaminate skin surfaces. Despite a high frequency (as high as 88%) of clostridial contamination of major traumatic open wounds, the incidence of gas gangrene in this setting is only 1% to 2%, 72 emphasizing the importance of devitalized tissue and the presence of foreign bodies in the pathogenesis of gas gangrene. The minimal dose of C. perfringens needed to produce fatal gas gangrene in experimental animals is reduced by a factor of 10 6 if the organism is injected into devitalized muscle contaminated with sterile dirt rather than into normal muscle. The policy of prompt, thorough d\u00e9bridement and of leaving wounds open has decreased the incidence of gas gangrene in wartime injuries; only 22 cases among 139,000 combat casualties in Vietnam were reported. 73 Gas gangrene may occasionally develop in the absence of an obvious external wound. This form of clostridial myonecrosis is designated spontaneous, nontraumatic gas gangrene. Its principal cause is C. septicum, a relatively aerotolerant species that spreads by the bacteremic route and is more capable of establishing infection without significant antecedent tissue injury than other clostridia. Intestinal tract abnormalities (colon cancer, diverticulitis, bowel infarction, necrotizing enterocolitis, volvulus) are the major predisposing conditions. 74 Colon cancer, often cryptic, is the most common of these, occurring in as many as 88% of patients with C. septicum bacteremia. Other predisposing disorders include leukemia, other causes of neutropenia, and diabetes mellitus. The primary source of infection is probably mucosal ulceration or perforation of the intestinal tract. The spread by the bacteremic route probably accounts for the bilateral multifocal involvement observed in a few patients with spontaneous gas gangrene. 75 However, it may also manifest in the buttocks or flanks after an intra-abdominal catastrophe, with rapid extension of infection along the iliopsoas or other deep muscle groups. The progression of C. septicum spontaneous gas gangrene may be even more fulminant than that of traumatic C. perfringens gas gangrene; the mortality rate of the former is 67% to 100%, with most patients dying within 24 hours after onset. 74 The involved muscle undergoes rapid disintegration. Initially, it may exhibit only pallor, edema, and loss of elasticity. When examined at surgery, it fails to contract on stimulation and does not bleed from a cut surface. Later it becomes discolored (reddish purple, then greenish purple and gangrenous) and friable. Histologically, the muscle fibers show coagulation necrosis, cavities caused by gas production, and a loss of supporting connective tissue; numerous gram-positive bacilli are present. Few, if any, inflammatory cells are present. Evidence suggests that the \u03b1and \u03b8-toxins of C. perfringens are major virulence factors that lead to myonecrosis and apparent lack of inflammation at the site of infection through cytolysis. 76 Intravascular thrombosis due to the local effects of \u03b1-toxin on platelets and granulocytes appears to be responsible for the severe herald pain (which may be ischemic) and extensive myonecrosis. 77 In addition to these local effects, the \u03b1-toxin provokes systemic hypotension by directly suppressing myocardial contractility and triggering the release of endogenous inflammatory mediators. 78 ",

Pain rapidly increases in intensity, beyond what would generally be associated with the preceding injury or surgical procedure, and may become excruciating.

Distinguishing group A streptococcal necrotizing myositis from streptococcal necrotizing fasciitis and spontaneous clostridial myonecrosis may be difficult clinically, but gas in the tissue suggests spontaneous clostridial myonecrosis. In any case, all three diseases require prompt surgical exploration. Ultrasonography, CT, or MRI usually reveals muscle swelling and fluid collection in muscle compartments. If prolonged delays are encountered in the pursuit of imaging studies, proceeding directly to surgical exploration with an initial limited surgical approach for diagnostic purposes is justified. Early aggressive surgical intervention with fasciotomy and d\u00e9bridement of necrotic tissue is indicated; in some instances, amputation is required. If the operative Gram stain suggests streptococcal infection, antibiotic therapy should consist of high doses of penicillin G (3 million units IV every 3 hours or 4 million units every 4 hours or adjusted appropriately for renal insufficiency) along with clindamycin (600 mg IV every 6 to 8 hours). 62 Clinical experience suggests that clindamycin has greater efficacy against group A streptococci in this life-threatening infection (Eagle effect) because of its greater activity against large bacterial populations in stationary phase growth, its more sustained postantibiotic effect, and its suppression of the production of toxins and other virulence factors through its inhibition of bacterial protein synthesis. 59 The use of intravenous immunoglobulin G as an adjunct in the treatment of streptococcal toxic shock to neutralize streptococcal exotoxins and perhaps to modulate the host immune response has gained popularity based on retrospective studies and one small prospective, randomized trial, 63 but conclusive evidence supporting its use remains limited. 64 ",

Local pain is relatively mild, and the skin lesions of gas gangrene (bronzing, dark blebs) do not develop. Paradoxically, gas formation is often much more extensive in clostridial cellulitis than in gas gangrene. Clinically, it is often difficult to distinguish between early clostridial cellulitis and myonecrosis. Definitive evaluation requires examination in the operating room for the characteristic changes of myonecrosis described earlier. The clinical picture of nonclostridial crepitant cellulitis is very similar to that of clostridial cellulitis. Although contamination of a surgical or traumatic wound may be the source of infection in both types of cellulitis, nonclostridial crepitant cellulitis frequently develops in the setting of vascular insufficiency or perirectal infection. Bacteria isolated from nonclostridial crepitant cellulitis include facultative species (e.g., E. coli, Klebsiella, various streptococci) and anaerobic bacteria (e.g., Bacteroides, Peptostreptococcus).

Prompt and extensive surgery is the principal element in the treatment of gas gangrene. This includes excision of involved muscles (or amputation if necessary) and fasciotomies to decompress and drain the swollen fascial compartments. Antibiotic therapy is an important adjunct to surgical management. Penicillin G, the traditional antibiotic of choice, is administered in a dose of 2 million units IV every 2 hours or 3 million units IV every 3 hours (24 million units/ day) (or adjusted for acute renal insufficiency) for an adult. Currently, combined penicillin and clindamycin (600 mg IV every 6 to 8 hours) is widely used in treatment. The addition of clindamycin is based on results of experimental studies of fulminant clostridial myonecrosis in mice, in which clindamycin, metronidazole, and tetracycline were each more effective than penicillin. 81 In vitro, the addition of penicillin to metronidazole antagonizes the activity of the latter; in contrast, the combination of penicillin with clindamycin provides slightly greater efficacy than clindamycin alone but significantly enhanced efficacy over that of penicillin alone. 82 An additional antimicrobial agent (e.g., ciprofloxacin, a third-or fourth-generation cephalosporin, or a carbapenem agent) may be used initially if Gram-stained smears of the wound exudate show gramnegative bacilli as well as the predominant gram-positive bacilli. Patients who are highly penicillin allergic may be treated with clindamycin; plasmid-mediated resistance to tetracycline and erythromycin is now common among clostridia. Although the majority of C. perfringens isolates are susceptible in vitro to cephalosporins, the secondgeneration agents cefotetan and cefoxitin appear to have more favorable minimal inhibitory concentrations than the third-generation agent ceftriaxone. 83 C. perfringens is highly susceptible in vitro to the carbapenems, as well as metronidazole 83 and linezolid, but experience with the use of these drugs in clostridial myonecrosis is limited.",

Its use should never delay immediate surgical d\u00e9bridement if possible. Its most appropriate role at present seems to be in the management of extensive truncal involvement, for which complete surgical excision would be impossible (paraspinal sites) or mutilating. In a murine model of C. perfringens myonecrosis initiated with a high inoculum, clindamycin therapy was more effective than hyperbaric oxygen and the addition of the latter provided no more efficacy than clindamycin alone. 86 Initial hyperbaric oxygen therapy may decrease the extent of d\u00e9bridement that is necessary under these circumstances.",

Other clostridial species (e.g., C. bifermentans, C. histolyticum, C. fallax, C. ramosum, and C. sordellii) have been implicated on rare occasions. In addition to clostridia, other organisms (e.g., E. coli, Enterobacter spp., enterococci) are sometimes isolated from the lesions of gas gangrene, reflecting the contaminated character of the initiating trauma or lesion. 79 There is prominent characteristic bronze discoloration of the skin extending over the shoulder. Crepitus could be palpated beyond the area of discoloration onto the back. spontaneous (nontraumatic) myonecrosis due to Aeromonas has not been reported in other settings. In a few instances, myonecrosis has been accompanied by gas spreading extensively in soft tissue planes. The rapid onset (24 to 48 hours) and rapid progression after trauma resemble those of clostridial gas gangrene. The prominence of pain, marked edema, serosanguineous bullae, and toxicity, in addition to the presence of gas in fascial planes, adds to the similarity of these conditions, and elicitation of freshwater exposure supports the diagnosis of Aeromonas infection. Bacteremia is frequently present. Treatment consists of extensive surgical d\u00e9bridement and prompt initiation of antimicrobial therapy.

Although a mixture of anaerobic and facultative organisms is commonly recovered at surgical exploration, on rare occasions crepitant myonecrosis may be caused by K. pneumoniae, 88 Enterobacter cloacae, 89 or Bacillus cereus 90 unaccompanied by other organisms (aerobic or anaerobic) in high-risk patients. The clinical course is rapidly progressive, often leading to a fatal outcome despite emergency surgical exploration and d\u00e9bridement of necrotic tissue.",

The histopathologic similarities observed between autoimmune muscle injury and the polymyositis associated with certain infectious processes and the demonstration of pathogen-specific antigen recognition by infiltrating lymphocytes suggest that infection may trigger an autoimmune attack on myocytes in at least some instances. 109, 110 Influenza Muscle aches are common early in the course of influenza. Occasionally, severe bilateral muscle pains in the lower limbs may develop in the recovery phase of influenza A or B, particularly in young children, which has been termed acute benign myositis. 111 Although influenza B is less common than influenza A, the rate of influenza B-associated myositis greatly exceeds that of influenza A. 106, 107 Muscle tenderness is demonstrable, principally in the gastrocnemius and soleus muscles, and calf swelling may be present. Deep tendon reflexes and muscle strength are normal, but there is considerable difficulty in walking. The leg pains and muscle tenderness subside in less than 1 week. Mild increases in serum concentrations of aldolase and creatine phosphokinase occur. The specimens from the few biopsies performed have shown either nonspecific degenerative changes or muscle necrosis with polymorphonuclear leukocytic infiltration. Whether this myositis is generally caused by direct viral invasion or by some immunologic or other response is unknown. Direct viral replication within skeletal muscle has been demonstrated in fatal cases of influenza A. 105 Lifethreatening rhabdomyolysis with extreme increases in creatine phosphokinase and myoglobin-induced acute renal failure are rarely seen after influenza A infection; the prognosis is favorable but may require short-term dialysis 108 or even extracorporeal membrane oxygenation if myocardial dysfunction is present. Isolated influenza myocarditis, sometimes quite severe, can occur in the absence of generalized rhabdomyolysis (see Chapter 167). 112 ",

Accelerated catabolism of skeletal muscle contributes to the marked weakness and muscle wasting that can be observed in systemic infections. This seems to be part of an acute phase host response to sepsis and trauma likely triggered by a variety of mediators, including interleukin-1, tumor necrosis factor, interferon-\u03b1, and interleukin-6, as well as endogenously and exogenously administered glucocorticoids. Detailed studies of myocyte mitochondrial number, protein synthesis and expression, mitochondrial enzyme activity, and messenger RNA levels (including microRNA) in muscle biopsy specimens from septic intensive care unit patients with multiorgan system failure demonstrate a loss of functional mitochondria with sustained but dysregulated mitochondrial protein expression and enhanced proteolytic activity. Transcriptional analysis demonstrated that several critical intracellular pathways (oxidative stress, apoptosis, proteasome function, ion homeostasis, and kinase signaling) are perturbed in these patients. 132 The intracellular events accompanying muscle catabolism involve prostaglandin E 2 synthesis, direct cleavage of actomyosin by caspase 3, 133 and subsequent degradation by proteasomes. Additional mechanisms also help regulate the process of muscle cachexia. 134 An important role of prostaglandin E 2 in the generation of myalgias and fever is consistent with the amelioration of these symptoms after administration of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory prostaglandin synthesis inhibitors.",

An initial intestinal phase (nausea, vomiting, nonbloody diarrhea) caused by larval release in the stomach, followed by larval maturation and copulation in the small intestine during the first week, is followed during the second week by release of progeny larvae, mucosal invasion, hematogenous dissemination, and invasion of skeletal muscle (see Chapter 289). 128 Serious complications in the form of myocarditis, meningoencephalitis, and pneumonitis can occur. 128 Myalgias, frequently accompanied by muscle swelling and weakness and occasionally associated with fasciculations, are present in most patients with the disease. Muscles commonly involved include the extraocular muscles, flexor muscles of the extremities, back muscles, and muscles used in chewing and swallowing.
