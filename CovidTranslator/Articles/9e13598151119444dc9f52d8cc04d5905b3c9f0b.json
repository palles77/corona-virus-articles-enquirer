The objective of this study was to determine platelet-bound antibodies (PBA) by a flow cytometric assay in both healthy and thrombocytopenic cats. Direct PBA testing was performed in 42 thrombocytopenic cats (platelet counts 6e179 \u00c2 10 9 /l, median 56 \u00c2 10 9 /l). Of these 42 cats, 19 had positive PBA test results, 17 of which were considered to have secondary immune-mediated thrombocytopenia (sITP). Underlying diseases included fat necroses (four cases), feline infectious peritonitis (three), feline leukaemia virus (two) or feline immunodeficiency virus (two) infections, lymphoma (two), leukaemia (one), hepatitis (one), pyelonephritis (one), or hyperthyroidism (one). In two cats, no underlying disease was found suggesting a primary immune-mediated thrombocytopenia (pITP). The PBA test was negative in 23 cats diagnosed with varying underlying diseases and in 47 healthy control cats with platelet values within the reference range. Only seven of the 42 cats with thrombocytopenia (platelet count 10e57 \u00c2 10 9 /l, median 34 \u00c2 10 9 /l) had spontaneous bleeding. This study suggests that immune-mediated destruction of platelets might be an important pathological mechanism for feline thrombocytopenia caused by various underlying diseases. In cats, pITP appears to be rarely diagnosed.",

In dogs, underlying diseases which may lead to platelet decreases have been described in detail and more frequently in dogs than in cats (Grindem et al 1991 , Lewis and Meyers 1996a , Kohn et al 2000a . Immune-mediated thrombocytopenia (ITP) and Evans' syndrome have been described frequently in dogs, while there are only occasional case reports for cats (Joshi et al 1979 , Harvey and Gaskin 1980 , Cain et al 1988 , Tyler et al 1991 , Jordan et al 1993 , Garon et al 1999 , Tasker et al 1999 . ITP occurs as a primary or idiopathic (pITP) and as a secondary (sITP) form (Reagan and Rebar 1995, Lewis et al 1995a) . In secondary ITP, infections, other immunemediated diseases (eg, systemic lupus erythematosus), drugs, neoplasias, blood transfusions, or vaccination may trigger an increased production of antibodies which may adhere to or cross-react with platelet receptors causing an increased destruction of platelets by the mononuclear phagocytic system (Lewis et al 1995a) . The diagnosis of a primary ITP is based on the exclusion of underlying diseases, the presence of a mostly severe thrombocytopenia, the response to immunosuppressive therapy, and the presence of platelet-bound antibodies (PBA) Meyers 1996b, Baldwin and Cowell 2001) . While direct positive detection of PBA by flow cytometry is an established diagnostic tool in dogs (Lewis et al 1995a , 1996b , Kohn et al 2000a , little information is available describing the use of this tool in cats.",

Fluorescein-conjugated polyclonal goat antifeline IgG antibodies (heavy and light chains) (Dianova, Hamburg) were used to detect those platelets that were carrying antibodies. Along with each blood sample of a patient (1.0e1.5 ml K-EDTA-blood) a control sample (K-EDTA-blood of a healthy cat) was sent overnight without cooling and analysed simultaneously, ie, within 18e24 h after harvest in order to avoid artefacts mimicking false-positive platelet reactions. Statistics SPSS 11.5 for Windows (Microsoft) was used for non-parametric statistical analysis. Ranges, mean with standard deviations, and median values are reported.

However, positive test results are not specific for primary ITP and other causes of ITP may be more common. According to Lewis et al (1995a) , false-positive results of the test can be caused by storage at room temperature. In one study, Lewis et al (1995a) compared mean fluorescence of platelets of healthy dogs (n \u00bc 5) after 0, 24, 48, and 72 h after storage on ice or at room temperatures. Concentrations of PBA were increased significantly after storage at room temperatures, while concentrations of IgG on thrombocytes that had been stored on ice were not increased significantly. In our semiblind study (the investigating laboratory had no knowledge of the clinical situation of the blood donor), none of the healthy control cats, the blood of which was treated in the same fashion as that of the sick cats, tested positive. Falsenegative results can be caused by the antibodies decreasing due to immunosuppressive therapy, by antibodies being too low at the onset, and due to technical problems (eg, using wrong antibodies) (Campbell et al 1984 , Kristensen et al 1994a .",

In our group of 42 cats, 33.3% (14/42) of the thrombocytopenic cats suffered from viral infectious diseases: 16.6% suffered from FIP, 7.1% from FeLV, and 9.5% from FIV. In Jordan et al (1993) only 4.9% cats had FIP, but 14.6% had FeLV infection. The mechanisms associated with thrombocytopenia during a viral infection may be multifactorial and vary with the agent (Weiss 2000) . According to Axthelm and Krakowa (1987) , virus induced thrombocytopenia may be caused by inhabiting precursor cells, thus reducing megakaryocytopoiesis, direct platelet damage or lysis by the virus itself, removal of platelets by the mononuclear phagocytic system, or by disseminated intravascular coagulation. Three of the seven cats suffering from feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) were PBA test positive, suggesting immune-mediated destruction of the platelets as a contributing factor. However, these cats also suffered from anaemia and leukopenia (pancytopenia), indicating a decreased bone marrow production as well. Two of the three cats infected with FeLV and two out of four cats infected with FIV had positive PBA test results, and an immune-mediated destruction of thrombocytes was considered a possible pathological mechanism.",

In inflammatory disease states interactions of platelets with altered or damaged endothelial surfaces cause extensive platelet activation, clumping, and removal of platelets by the mononuclear phagocytic system. Platelet destruction in bacterial infections can occur as a result of platelet adherence or aggregation to activated monocytes or neutrophils. Exotoxins may directly damage platelets and contribute to thrombocytopenia (Bithell 1993, Russell and Grindem 2000) .

There is a wide variety of pathomechanisms that may cause thrombocytopenia in the course of a neoplastic disease: Platelets may be sequestered in the spleen, liver, or the tumour as such; consumption of platelets may be increased (eg, due to disseminated intravascular coagulation); they may be destroyed by immune reactions, and production may be reduced because of bone marrow involvement (Helfand 1988) . Some cats suffering from lymphoma or leukaemia tested PBA negative while others tested positive. Thrombocytopenic dogs suffering from neoplastic diseases, such as lymphoma or tumours of the liver or spleen had positive PBA test results.

In these two cats, PBA detection was performed several times. A study on dogs showed that in seven dogs suffering from pITP PBA tests were positive at first, but negative after having been treated with prednisolone for 7e32 days (Kohn et al 2000b) . It is not clear, why in this study PBA was detected over a longer period of time in cats with pITP and Evans' syndrome than in dogs. However, an evaluation of this feature was not possible as there were too few cases. Moreover, both cats received blood transfusions which can be a trigger of (secondary) ITP by itself (Kohn et al 2000a) .",

In this study, seven out of 42 cats displayed spontaneous bleeding. In a study by Jordan et al (1993) , nine out of 41 cats showed spontaneous haemorrhage. Bleeding was related to platelet values below 30 \u00c2 10 9 /l, and occurred in cats suffering from neoplasia (n \u00bc 5), infections with FeLV (2), pITP (n \u00bc 1), or associated to an Eisenmenger's syndrome (n \u00bc 1). In our study, 10 of 13 cats with platelet counts <30 \u00c2 10 9 /l displayed no clinical signs of haemorrhage. Whether bleeding occurs or not is not only dependent on the number of platelets but also on their age and functionality and on the vascular integrity. According to Jordan et al (1993) cats seem to be able to tolerate very low platelet counts without showing spontaneous bleeding. This could be explained by thrombocytes of cats being activated more easily than those of dogs. Feline platelets are stimulated more readily by aggregation inductors, such as collagen or thrombin, than those of dogs (Hart and Nolte 1991) . Activation of thrombocytes results in the release of serotonin. Meyers et al (1982) showed that dense-granules of cats contain 3 or 1.5 times the amount of serotonin compared to dense-granules of humans or dogs, respectively. Serotonin is a potent vasoconstrictor and induces primary aggregation of platelets. In addition, serotonin will potentiate the aggregation effect of other agonists (Meyers et al 1982) .",
