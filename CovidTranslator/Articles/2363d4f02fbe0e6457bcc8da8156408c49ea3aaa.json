Few doubt the critical need for preplanning, and thus agencies across the world are preparing frameworks for response. Drugs have been stockpiled, protocols prepared, and transport limitations outlined. All these plans, however, are contingent on staff .",

This proportion is similar to those in a previous infl uenza survey in Germany 2 and a study on attendance during a hypothetical outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in New York City. 3 Plans often account for workers' absence, be it due to illness, attending to relatives, or transport diffi culties. However, such a high proportion of doubt in such a critical group seems worrying.",

Examples range from the 1918 infl uenza pandemic to SARS. 4 Some measures, such as hand-washing, barriers, and protective clothing, can reduce nosocomial infections in pandemic situations. 5 However, the eff ectiveness of other protective measures has not been validated. Whether oseltamivir, the preferred antiviral, reliably inhibits H5N1 infection is not known, 6 and if it does, resistant strains will surely emerge. 7 Vaccines, meanwhile, are still being developed.",

            "text": "In her recent book, At Large and at Small: Familiar Essays, Anne Fadiman has brilliantly dusted off a literary form that was once widely practised. The heyday of the \"familiar essay\" was the 18th and 19th centuries, and perhaps its most famous practitioners were William Hazlitt and Charles Lamb. Their writings were neither strictly critical nor purely personal, but, as Fadiman puts it, equal measures of brain and heart, in a style at once invigorating and intimate. \"The familiar essayist\", she writes, \"didn't speak to the millions; he spoke to one reader, as if the two of them were sitting side by side in front of a crackling fi re with their cravats loosened, their favorite stimulants at hand, and a long evening of conversation stretching before them. His viewpoint was subjective, his frame of reference concrete, his style digressive, his eccentricities conspicuous, and his laughter usually at his own expense.\" 1 The crux of the familiar essay is a subject about which the writer is well-acquainted and passionate. This year's Wakley Prize will be awarded, we daresay, to a contemporary Hazlitt, Lamb, or Fadiman. The prize is given annually to the best essay on a clinical topic of international health importance. Previous winners, from places as far-fl ung as Malawi, Kenya, the Netherlands, London, and Philadelphia, have described their own and their patients' stories of illness; the hard realities of medicine's collision with economics, politics, and geography; and the ravages, mysteries, and lessons of age, health, and disease. [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] The range of topics is broad by design, but the product should speak to both brain and heart, in engaging and elegant prose.",
