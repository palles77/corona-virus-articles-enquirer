            "text": "The synthesis of indole derivatives has attracted significant interest over recent years [1] [2] [3] due to the increasing role of such compounds in medicinal chemistry [4] [5] [6] [7] and as photosensitizers in solar cell technology. 8 The indole system is a part of many naturally occurring physiologically active compounds; for example, some small molecular regulators of human central nervous system are indole derivatives. 4, 6, 7, 9 The research performed over recent decades has shown that there are many compounds with high biological activity among isatin derivatives as well. 9 Such examples include tuberculostatic and antitumor agents, 10, 11 substances with anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, antiHIV, antiviral, spasmolytic, and antifungal effects. 12 Isatin derivatives find increasing use in modern organic chemistry as precursors and synthetic intermediates for the preparation of other compounds. 13 For example, isatin derivatives have shown promise as reactants in 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition according to Huisgen, occurring at the carbonyl group at position 3 of the isatin moiety. 14, 15 Besides that, isatin derivatives are used in the synthesis of dyes and analytical reagents. 16 The very rich chemistry of indole alkaloids includes examples of highly biologically active compounds, including some with antitumor activity. 17 However, the mechanism of antitumor activity in isatin derivatives has not yet been established. Isatin is a known inhibitor of monoamine oxidase and kinases. 18 Isatin derivatives naturally occur in plants, while in human body such compounds have been found in tissues of nervous system. 19 Isatin is known to be formed in human liver, but the metabolic fate of this compound remains unclear. Early studies suggested that biosynthesis of isatin begins from adrenaline, while later results showed that isatin derivatives form from tryptophan or phenylalanine through metabolism in gut bacteria to indole and a final oxidation step in liver. 19 Isatin derivatives further undergo spontaneous oxidation to derivatives of indigo and indirubin, which are excreted from the body. 19, 20 Keywords: isatin, isoindigo, oxindole, phosphine, phosphite, phosphonate, phosphorane, zwitterion, Abramov reaction, biological activity, Horner-Wadsworth-Emmons reaction, Pfitzinger reaction, three-component reaction,Wittig reaction. Br -+ Some isatin and indole derivatives, which are Schiff and Mannich bases, as well as related hydrazones, have shown a broad spectrum of biological activity and are used in the treatment of cardiac ischemia, arrhytmia, stenocardia, and as antidepressants. [21] [22] [23] [24] Isatin itself blocks the natriuretic peptide receptor and is quite effective as antidepressant, which is likely caused by the biological action of its metabolite tribulin on the human nervous system. 25 Publications from recent years describe the synthesis of new isatin derivatives, which are effective inhibitors of rhinovirus and coronavirus proteases, 26 as well as the reverse transcriptase of HIV. Isatin derivatives obtained by conjugation with other biologically active compounds were identified as effective inhibitors of tyrosinases, various kinases, guanylate cyclase -enzymes that play important role in the development of tumors and myocardial ischemia, as well as inhibited the cyclin-dependent kinasea key regulator of cell division. 27, 28 The same publications also described the high spasmolytic activity of isatin itself, its inhibitory activity against xanthine oxidase, and the potential use of such compounds as anticancer drugs: derivatives of indigo and indirubin were found among compounds isolated from rats with cancer. The antitumor effects of indole and isatin derivatives have been reviewed in the literature. 10, 11 We will focus on the reactivity of isatin derivatives towards phosphorus compounds, a topic that has been partially covered by an earlier review (references until 1999) by Gurevich and Yaroshevskaya, 29 devoted to indole chemistry. The introduction of phosphorus-containing fragment into molecules of biologically active compounds can be considered as a powerful technique for designing new drugs, because it may lead to new types of biological activity, as well as improve the transport through cell membranes. On the other hand, the use of organophosphorus compounds as reagents for the modification of isatin derivatives enables various valuable synthetic transformations of the isatin moiety. Besides that, the use of phosphorus compounds as organocatalysts offers possibilities for involving isatin derivatives into a range of multicomponent reactions. For these reasons, we consider it necessary to systematize and generalize in this review the reported reactions of isatins with phosphorus compounds, published between 1966 and 2014. Older publications are referred to only when relevant to the current state of art in this field.",

The influence of substituents at the phosphorus atom on the synthetic outcome in reaction with isatin (1a) was studied by using 4-tolyl-and 1-naphthylphosphonous acids, as well as dimethyl-and diethyl phosphites. 30 The reactions were performed in methanol at equimolar ratio of reagents, in the presence of sodium methoxide catalyst, by refluxing for 0.5-1 h. The phosphorus-containing 2-indolinones 2 were obtained in 77-93% yields (Scheme 1). The preparation of phosphorus-containing 2-indolinone derivatives has also been described. 31 Thus, Abramov reaction was performed by treating 5-bromoisatin (1b) with diethylphosphorous acid in ethanol, in the presence of sodium ethoxide, yielding compound 3, which was further transformed by Arbuzov reaction in the presence of nickel bromide to the diphosphonate 4 (Scheme 2).",

For example, the reaction of isatin (1\u0430) with (cyanomethylidene)triphenylphosphorane resulted in the formation of electron-deficient oxindole 54 as a mixture of E-and Z-isomers, which further reacted with trialkylphosphites, forming dialkyl[cyano(2,3-dihydro-2-oxo-1H-indol-3-yl)methyl]phosphonate 55 and isomeric bis(indole)-containing cyclic phosphonates 56 (Scheme 24). 73 Osman and coworkers assumed that the initial reaction occurred between compound 54 and trialkylphosphite, followed by hydrolysis. 74 In our opinion, taking into account the facile hydrolysis of trialkylphosphites, the first step likely involved the formation of dialkylphosphite, followed by Pudovik reaction with compounds 54, forming structures 55 and 56 (Scheme 24).",

In this section, we consider several publications of key importance, where phosphorus compounds have been used to catalyze synthetic transformations of isatins. For example, amines and phosphines can be used as nucleophilic catalysts in the Morita-Baylis-Hillman reaction -one of the current methods for the formation of \u0421-\u0421 bond between \u03b1-position of activated alkenes and aldehydes. Derivatives of 3-R,R'methyleneindolin-2-ones and isatin were introduced into reaction with allenyl carboxylates and ethynyl ketones where phosphines were used as nucleophilic catalysts, and the products were various indole-containing spirocyclic compounds 118, 119. [131] [132] [133] [134] We should note that the reaction gave different results depending on the nature of the base: the use of DABCO led to the formation of spirane 119, while spirane 118 was obtained when methyldiphenylphosphine was used. Mohammadi and coauthors 135 linked the formation of spirane 118 with the presence of zwitterion N in the reaction mixture, which was then transformed into zwitterion O and attacked an isatin molecule. A synthesis of spiranes has been reported, 134 using a palladium catalyst containing N,N-dialkyldibenzo-[d,f][1,3,2]dioxaphosphepine-6-amines, including ones with chiral groups at the nitrogen atom (Scheme 59).",
