            "text": "Positive-strand RNA genomes function as mRNA for viral protein synthesis which is fully reliant on host cell translation machinery. Competing with cellular protein translation apparatus needs to ensure the production of viral proteins, but this also stifles host innate defense. In the present study, we showed that porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), whose replication takes place in the cytoplasm, imprisoned host cell mRNA in the nucleus, which suggests a novel mechanism to enhance translation of PRRSV genome. PRRSV nonstructural protein (nsp) 1\u03b2 was identified as the nuclear protein playing the role for host mRNA nuclear retention and subversion of host protein synthesis. A SAP (SAF-A/B, Acinus, and PIAS) motif was identified in nsp1\u03b2 with the consensus sequence of 126 -LQxxLxxxGL-135 . In situ hybridization unveiled that SAP mutants were unable to cause nuclear retention of host cell mRNAs and did not suppress host protein synthesis. In addition, these SAP mutants reverted PRRSV-nsp1\u03b2-mediated suppression of interferon (IFN) production, IFN signaling, and TNF-\u03b1 production pathway. Using reverse genetics, a series of SAP mutant PRRS viruses, vK124A, vL126A, vG134A, and vL135A were generated. No mRNA nuclear retention was observed during vL126A and vL135A infections. Importantly, vL126A and vL135A did not suppress IFN production. For other arteriviruses, mRNA nuclear accumulation was also observed for LDV-nsp1\u03b2 and SHFV-nsp1\u03b2. EAV-nsp1 was exceptional and did not block the host mRNA nuclear export.",

            "text": "Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) emerged in the United States in 1987 and subsequently in Europe in 1990, and has since become endemic in most pig-producing countries worldwide (Benfield et al., 1992; Wensvoort et al., 1991) . The etiological agent is PRRS virus (PRRSV) that falls into the family Arteriviridae together with lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus (LDV) of mice, equine arteritis virus (EAV), and simian hemorrhagic fever virus (SHFV). The PRRSV genome is a single-stranded positive-sense RNA of 15 Kb in length with the 5\u2032 cap and the 3\u2032-polyadenylated [poly(A)] tail (Meulenberg et al., 1993; Nelsen et al., 1999; Wootton et al., 2000) . Two large open reading frames (ORFs), ORF1a and ORF1b, occupy the 5\u2032 three-quarters of the genome and code for two polyproteins, pp1a and pp1ab, with the expression of the latter mediated by \u22121 frameshifting in the ORF1a/ORF1b overlapping region (Snijder and Meulenberg, 1998) . The pp1a and pp1ab proteins are further processed to generate 14 nsps. The remaining sequence is located in the 3\u2032 onequarter of the genome codes for structural proteins (Firth et al., 2011; Johnson et al., 2011; Nelsen et al., 1999; Wootton et al., 2000) . A \u22122 ribosomal frame-shifting has recently been identified for expression of nsp2TF in the nsp2-coding region (Fang et al., 2012) . Host innate immune system produces cytokines and chemokines in response to PRRS viral infection for protection . However, poor induction of proinflammatory cytokines and type I IFNs has been shown as the hallmark of PRRSV infection in cells and pigs (For a review, see , Sun et al. (2012) ). A decrease of IFN transcripts is observed in PRRSV-infected MARC-145 cells (Miller et al., 2004) . On the contrary, IFN-\u03b1 mRNA is augmented after stimulation in PRRSV-infected macrophages, suggesting that a posttranscriptional event may be involved in regulating the IFN response\". (Lee et al., 2004; Miller et al., 2009) . NF-\u03baB suppression is likely involved in down-regulation of IFN production during early infection of PRRSV. At downstream, CREB (cyclic AMP responsive element binding)-binding protein (CBP) is degraded by PRRSV and thus the assembly of enhanceosome for IFN transcription is disrupted .",

            "text": "In addition to modulating host cell signaling, the seizing of host protein synthesis is a complementary strategy for a virus to suppress host innate defense (Walsh and Mohr, 2011) . Viral replication relies on the translation machinery of cells, and commandeering ribosomes to viral mRNA is essential for viral protein expression, genome replication, and progeny virus production. Discrete viral strategies for subversion of cellular mRNA translation have been uncovered, which include interference on translation factors (Walsh and Mohr, 2011) , cellular mRNA nuclear imprisonment (Kuss et al., 2013) , cleavage of cellular mRNAs (Kamitani et al., 2006; Sokoloski et al., 2009) , and induction of microRNAs (Abraham and Sarnow, 2011) . For instance, inhibition of cap-dependent host protein translation has been well studied for member viruses of the order Picornavirales. Besides, some of picornaviruses impede host protein translation by blocking the nucleocytoplasmic trafficking of cellular mRNA (Kuss et al., 2013) . For viruses in the Nidovirales order, the SARS-CoV nsp1 inhibits the expression of host genes (Huang et al., 2011b) . SARS-CoV nsp1 induces the cleavage of host mRNAs and binds to 40S ribosomes to inactivate their translation functions (Kamitani et al., , 2006 . The nsp1 of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) and transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) strongly reduces cellular mRNA expression but the strategy used by TGEV nsp1 differs from that of SARS-CoV nsp1 (Huang et al., 2011a; Tohya et al., 2009; Zust et al., 2007) . For arteriviruses, modulation of host protein synthesis is poorly understood. In the present study, we demonstrated that PRRSV imprisoned host cellular mRNA in the nucleus, which was mediated by nsp1\u03b2, implying an enhanced access to host translation apparatus for viral mRNAs in the cytoplasm. A conserved motif for SAP (SAF-A/B, Acinus, and PIAS) was identified in the nsp1\u03b2 subunit and this motif played multiple roles for nuclear distribution of nsp1\u03b2, mRNA nuclear accumulation, subversion of host protein synthesis, innate immune responses, and PRRSV replication.",

Therefore, poly(A)+ RNA in PRRSV-infected cells was examined by in situ hybridization. As anticipated, poly(A)+ RNA was normally distributed in the both cytoplasm and nucleus in mockinfected cells (Fig. 1A , red). In contrast, red fluorescent intensities (FIs) were distinct in the nucleus in PRRSV-infected cells (Fig. 1A) , indicating that PRRSV caused poly(A)+ RNA retention to the nucleus. Virusinfected cells were distinguished by staining with anti-nsp1\u03b2 polyclonal antibody (pAb), and consistent with previous finding, nsp1\u03b2 was distributed in the both cytoplasm and nucleus in infected cells (Fig. 1A ). Since the PRRSV genome replication and transcription occur exclusively in the cytoplasm, the mRNAs in the nucleus are assumed to be cellular transcripts. To examine if the nuclear retention of mRNA by PRRSV was a common property for PRRSV, other strains of PRRSV representing the genotypes I and II were examined. Similar results were obtained for NVSL 97-7895 (FL12) (genotype II), VR2332 (genotype II), and the Lelystad virus (genotype I) (Fig. 1A) , indicating that the nuclear accumulation of cellular mRNA is common for both genotypes of PRRSV.",

            "text": "To determine whether PRRSV-mediated host mRNA nuclear accumulation affects viral RNA translation, we examined the distribution of viral RNA by RT-qPCR using PRRSV N-gene specific primers. Most viral RNA was found in the cytoplasm (Fig. 1B ). In addition to N transcripts, four cellular genes [GADPH (Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase), DEPTOR (DEP domain-containing mTOR-interacting protein), NOL6 (nucleolar protein 6), SH2 (src homology 2)] were randomly chosen and their mRNA nuclear/cytoplasmic ratios were determined by RT-qPCR and presented on the logarithmic scales (Fig. 1C ). Compared to mock-infected cells, the nuclear/cytoplasmic ratios for DEPTOR, NOL6, and SH2 transcripts were significantly increased to higher than 1 in PRRSV-infected cells, indicating that the majority of the mRNAs were localized in the nucleus during infection. On the contrary, the nuclear/cytoplasmic ratio for PRRSV transcripts was approximately 0.2, demonstrating that viral RNA was predominantly cytoplasmic. These results show that PRRSV infection imprisoned host mRNA to the nucleus without disrupting the cytoplasmic distribution of viral RNA. The kinetics for PRRSV-mediated host mRNA nuclear accumulation was determined using the PA8 strain of PRRSV. The mRNA nuclear accumulation was detectable from 8 hpi until at least 24 hpi (Fig. 1D) . FIs in the nucleus in virus-infected cells were quantified, and red FIs representing host mRNA and green FIs representing PRRSV-nsp1\u03b2 both increased over time (Fig. 1D, right panel) , suggesting that the host mRNA nuclear accumulation was associated with the nsp1\u03b2 nuclear localization. To confirm this correlation, fluorescence analyses were conducted (Fig. 1E , individual cells are indicated by lower-case letters). Average nuclear FIs were determined for both host mRNA and nsp1\u03b2 and normalized using average FIs in background (Fig. 1E , yellow circles). In comparison to uninfected cells (Fig. 1E , lower panel, lanes 'h' and 'I'), no increase of nuclear red FIs was observed in PRRSVinfected cells with no nuclear nsp1\u03b2 (lanes 'a' and 'b'). By sharp contrast, nuclear red FIs were increased by 2-4 folds in cells with nuclear nsp1\u03b2 (lanes 'c'-'g'), suggesting that the nuclear accumulation of host mRNA required nsp1\u03b2 in the nucleus. PRRSV-infected cells showed significant host mRNA nuclear accumulation by 24 hpi (Fig. 1F ).",

            "text": "The PRRSV nsp1\u03b2 protein contains a papain-like proteinase domain (PLP1\u03b2) and a nuclease motif. Further analysis of the nsp1\u03b2 sequence revealed a motif at residues 123-138 resembling the previously defined SAP domain for protein-DNA interactions (Abraham and Sarnow, 2011) . The motif of 124-KxLQxxLxxxGL-135 in PRRSV-nsp1\u03b2 meets the SAP consensus motif in the first \u03b1-helix, xPLBxxHxxBxH, where P, B, and H indicate polar, bulky, and hydrophobic residues, respectively. The leader proteinase (Lpro) protein of foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) contains a SAP motif, and mutations in the first \u03b1-helix of the SAP motif were sufficient to subvert its function (de los Santos et al., 2009) . Hence, we hypothesized that this conserved sequence motif might function similar to SAP, and accordingly a total of seven single mutations were individually introduced to the SAP motif of PRRSV-nsp1\u03b2. To examine whether the SAP domain was associated with nsp1\u03b2-mediated host mRNA nuclear accumulation, the ability of SAP mutants for host mRNA nuclear export was individually examined by in situ hybridization (Fig. 3A) . The nuclear accumulation of poly(A)+ RNA was evident for wild-type nsp1\u03b2 and two mutants K124A and G134A, whereas no accumulation was observed for the rest of mutants. The average nuclear FIs were determined for red fluorescence and green fluorescence representing poly(A)+ RNA and nsp1\u03b2, respectively. Wild-type nsp1\u03b2, K124A, and G134A resulted in the strong poly(A)+ RNA and nsp1\u03b2 in the nucleus, while the mutants L126, R129, L130A, and L135A showed the weak FIs. For R128A, poly(A)+ RNA were weak but nsp1\u03b2 were strong in the nucleus, suggesting that the residue R128 was essential for the nuclear retention of poly(A)+ RNA but nonessential for the nsp1\u03b2 nuclear localization (Fig. 3B) . To examine the relative amounts of host mRNA in the nucleus of the mutant nsp1\u03b2-expressing cells, the DEPTOR, NOL6, and SH2 genes were chosen as cellular genes for RT-qPCR, and R128A and L135A were chosen as representative viral mutants (Fig. 3C) . No significant fold-changes were seen in the total host mRNA by nsp1\u03b2 and its mutants (Fig. 3C, upper panel) , but two SAP mutants R128A and L135A reduced the amounts of DEPTOR, NOL6, and SH2 mRNAs when compared to nsp1\u03b2 (Fig. 3C, lower panel) , further indicating that the SAP motif was essential to retain host mRNAs in the nucleus.",

After transfection of MARC-145 cells with individual fulllength genomic clones, viral infectivity was determined by IFA and Western blot for N protein expression. Of seven mutant constructs, vR128A, vR129A, and vL130A appeared to be non-available, and four mutants vK124A, vL126A, vG134A, and vL135A were obtained. The reconstituted PRRSV mutants were amplified in MARC-145 cells by five passages and their genetic stability was determined by sequencing. Respective mutations appeared to be stable in cell culture. SAP mutant viruses of vK124A, vL126A, vG134A, and vL135A were titrated using each of P1, P2, and P3 passages, and their titers of P3 passages reached 10 4 , 10 3.67 , 10 5.83 , and 10 3.83 per ml of TCID 50 , respectively. The titer of the parental virus reconstituted from the FL13 wild-type infectious clone was determined to be 10 5 /ml TCID 50 (Fig. 5A) . The multi-step growth kinetics revealed that the mutant viruses vL126A and vL135A exhibited decreased growth rates with the peak titers of approximately 100-fold lower compared to that of wild-type PRRSV vFL13 (Fig. 5B) . The titers of vK124A and vG134A were similar to that of FL13 (Fig. 5B) . The plaque size of vL126A and vL135A was reduced significantly, compared to the vFL13 plaques (Fig. 5C ).

As with wild-type vFL13-infected cells, vK124A and vG134Ainfected cells showed nsp1\u03b2 staining in the nucleus, whereas vL126A and vL135A did not cause the nsp1\u03b2 nuclear staining, which was consistent with the results of the nsp1\u03b2-gene-transfection. The FIs were calculated, and the average nuclear red FIs indicating nsp1\u03b2 were above 80, indicating strong FIs for vFL13, vK124A, and vG134A (Fig. 5D, right panel) . The FIs for each mutants were confirmed by cell fractionation and Western blot analyses (Fig. 5E, upper panel) . In contrast, vL126A and vL135A showed limited amounts of nsp1\u03b2 in the nucleus (Fig. 5E, upper panel) , further confirming that the SAP domain was important for the nsp1\u03b2 nuclear localization. The production of nsp1\u03b2 was examined by Western blot using the total cell lysate after virus infection, and the production of nsp1\u03b2 was not impaired by SAP mutations (Fig 5E) .",

In the present study, we have described that PRRSV blocks the nuclear export of host mRNAs to the cytoplasm and accumulates them in the nucleus (Fig. 1 ). This is a novel finding for viruses in the order of Nidovirales. The virusmediated nuclear imprisonment of host mRNAs makes them difficult to access the cytoplasm for translation, while the viral genomic RNA and subgenomic mRNAs can effectively recruit ribosomes for efficient translation with less competitions with host mRNAs. A small amount of viral RNA is detected by oligo(dT) probe, and this is probably due to the binding of viral RNA with nsp1\u03b2 protein (Xue et al., 2010) , resulting in the nuclear transport of viral RNA by piggyback riding on the nsp1\u03b2. The host mRNA nuclear retention is observed for both genotypes (types I and II) of PRRSV, and LDV and SHFV, suggesting that this strategy is extensively utilized by PRRSV and by other member viruses in the family Arteriviridae with an exception of EAV. Host mRNA nuclear accumulation is not observed by EAV nsp1, despite EAV nsp1 being a nuclear protein, which suggests a different mechanism for EAV nsp1 to mediate IFN suppression. The nuclear localization of PRRSV N protein relies on the specific nuclear localization signal (NLS), and the NLS of N has been shown to be a virulence factor of PRRSV (Pei et al., 2008) . The nsp1\u03b1 in the nucleus participates in the CREB-binding protein degradation (Han et al., 2013) . It has been noted that nsp1\u03b2 protein is distributed exclusively in the nucleus in gene-transfected cells but is distributed both in the nucleus and cytoplasm in virus-infected cells. The reason for such a difference is unclear, but may be due to the interaction of nsp1\u03b2 with nsp1 to mediate nsp2TF frameshifting during virus infection, whereas in gene-transfected cells, such an interaction with nsp2 is absent. We have shown that the host mRNA nuclear accumulation is associated with the nuclear distribution of nsp1\u03b2. In PRRSVinfected cells, host mRNA nuclear accumulation is significantly in concert with the nsp1\u03b2 nuclear staining (Fig. 1D ). According to the kinetic studies, host mRNA accumulation is detectable as early as 8 h of infection, which is consistent with the first appearance of nsp1\u03b2 in the nucleus (Fig. 1D) .",

            "text": "A SAP motif is found in some of host cell nuclear proteins besides PRRSV nsp1\u03b2, including the scaffold attachment factors A and B (SAF- A and -B), PIAS, and myocardia (Aravind and Koonin, 2000; Okubo et al., 2004) . The SAP motif is essential for binding to AT-rich DNA sequences present in scaffold-attachment region/matrix-attachment region (SAR/MAR) (Aravind and Koonin, 2000) . The signature motif of LxxLL in the N-terminal region of SAP domain of PIAS leads to the inhibition of STAT1-dependent transcription, whereas a SAP mutant of PIAS does not inhibit type I IFN transcription (Kubota et al., 2011; Liu et al., 2001) . A SAP domain is also found in L pro of foot-and-mouse disease virus (FMDV), and mutations introduced in the conserved SAP motif prevent the nuclear localization of L pro and degradation of NF-\u03baB (de los Santos et al., 2009). Remarkably, a SAP-mutant FMDV was attenuated and did not cause clinical signs, and the cattle immunized with the SAP-mutant FMDV developed a strong neutralizing antibody response (Segundo et al., 2012) . The composition of SAP sequence identified in PRRSV nsp1\u03b2 meets the SAP consensus motif identified in the cellular proteins, and three hydrophobic residues of L126, L130, and L135 are highly maintained in PRRSV nsp1\u03b2. A highly conserved sequence of 123 -GKYLQRRLQ-131 has been reported in PRRSV nsp1\u03b2, which is partially overlapped with the SAP motif, and the K124A/R128A mutant impairs nsp1\u03b2-mediated IFN suppression (Li et al., 2013) . In our study, the SAP mutants L126A, R129A, L130A, and L135A also resulted in the reversion of IFN suppression but the molecular basis seems to differ from that of K124A/R128A mutation. Host mRNA nuclear accumulation was not observed in cells expressing mutants, except R128A which still confers the host mRNA nuclear accumulation. In contrast, the mutants L126A, R129A, L130A, and L135A remained in the cytoplasm and were colocalized with a mitochondria marker protein, suggesting the hydrophobic residues in the SAP motif may be essential for nuclear translocation of PRRSV nsp1\u03b2. Surprisingly, the subcellular distribution pattern of R129A was identical to those of leucine mutants (Fig. 4) . PRRSV nsp1\u03b2 suppressed the innate immune responses , and the SAP mutants L126A, R129A, L130A, and L135A failed to inhibit the IFN production, IFN signaling, and TNF-\u03b1 induction plus host mRNA nuclear accumulation (Figs. 6 and 7) , demonstrating that nsp1\u03b2-mediated host mRNA nuclear retention is closely involved in the nsp1\u03b2-regulated innate immunity. The mutant R128A showed partial reversion and this mutant did not imprison host mRNA in the nucleus (Figs. 6 and 7) , suggesting that host mRNA nuclear accumulation is not the only mechanism for nsp1\u03b2-mediated innate suppression. The leucine residues within the SAP motif are essential for host mRNA nuclear retention, and subsequently two viable mutants vL126A and vL135A were generated using infectious clones (Fig. 5 ). For these mutant viruses, the growth was impaired when compared to the parental vFL13 and vG134A (Fig. 5) . nsp1\u03b2 was retained in the cytoplasm when infected with vL126A and vL135A viruses, and no host mRNA nuclear accumulation was observed, which is consistent with the findings in gene-transfected cells (Fig. 3) . Accordingly, the degree of IFN suppression was reduced, indicating that host mRNA nuclear retention contributes to host innate immune gene expression. nsp1\u03b2 functions as a trans-activator to induce \u22121/\u22122 frameshifting in the nsp2 region of PRRSV and to produce nsp2TF and nsp2N . The SAP leucine residues are in close proximity to the mutated residues of nsp1\u03b2-knock-out virus (1\u03b2KO) which fails to express nsp2TF and nsp2N, and thus it is plausible that the SAP mutant viruses vL126A and vL135A may be unable to produce nsp2TF and nsp2N.",
