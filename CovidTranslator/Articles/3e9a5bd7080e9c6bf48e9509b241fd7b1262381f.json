During the investigation of outbreaks of gastroenteritis it may be necessary or desirable to prioritize specimens processed. Traditionally in our laboratory this was done by assessing the consistency of the faeces received and preferentially processing those specimens which were liquid and leaving the more solid specimens to later. A more restrictive approach has been employed in the Public Health Laboratory Service of England and Wales, where the customary practice is to seek only \"unformed\" faeces for EM (PHLS North West Electron Microscopy Policy, August 1996). The current recommendations from Centers for Disease Control, U.S.A., are that the more formed the stool specimen the lower the diagnostic yield, and therefore liquid specimens only should be collected and examined by EM. 1'2 We set up a study to investigate the validity of this approach to EM and also to look at the relationship between faecal consistency and virus isolation rates.",

            "text": "The finding that the diagnostic yield from faeces examined by EM increases with consistency was unexpected. The most likely explanation for the increase in diagnostic yield with consistency is simply concentration of faeces during resolution of diarrhoea. The two illustrative case histories demonstrate that the finding of a positive EM result may occur at the time of resolution of diarrhoea. The duration of the illness in these two cases is the maximum of what would normally be expected. The were isolated during the course of the study. \u00a7 All polioviruses were typed as part of an ongoing program (Enteric and Respiratory laboratory CPHL, Colindale) and were all considered to be vaccine strains. proportion of samples with clinical details containing text strings indicating a gastroenteritis type illness did not correlate with the consistency of the faeces, but did correlate with EM positivity. This implies that the more formed faecal specimens were no more or less likely to be from cases of gastroenteritis. It has previously been demonstrated that up to 40% of children who have recovered from viral gastroenteritis will still be positive for a viral agent by EM on the day of discharge from hospital, s Animal studies provide an insight. In suckling rats experimentally infected with group B rotavirus where faeces were assayed by enzyme immunoassay, 100% of the animals assayed at days 1, 4, and 5 tested positive for rotavirus. However, only 70% and 20% of the animals tested positive at days 2 and 3 postinoculation, respectively. 6 This biphasic pattern of viral excretion was confirmed by a dot hybridization assay. It was noted that the second peak coincided with the time when diarrhoea had begun to resolve and the fluid volume in the intestine had decreased. The second peak of viral excretion was shown not to be due to a second round of intestinal replication. A similar biphasic pattern has been also observed in neonatal murine rotavirus models. 7-1\u00b0 It was noted that the first peak of viral excretion preceded the severe diarrhoea and that the second peak coincided with the faeces becoming solid, a This biphasic pattern was also noted in rotavirus infectivity titre (TCID50) in the mid small intestine of gnotobiotic piglets infected with rotavirus. 11 In this case the first peak of viral excretion was at 19-22 h and the second peak at 61-65 h. The results that we have observed would reflect a similar biphasic pattern of excretion in patients with gastroenteritis. Because the first peak precedes the peak symptomatology, diagnosis is often dependent on the second peak.",

Our observations suggest that the optimum specimen is one taken either at the start of symptoms before the faeces have become liquid or at the time the diarrhoea is resolving. The results of this study have important implications for those establishing diagnostic algorithms for use in the investigation of viral gastroenteritis. Further studies looking at the kinetics of viral excretion in humans and the relationship to faecal consistency are required.",
