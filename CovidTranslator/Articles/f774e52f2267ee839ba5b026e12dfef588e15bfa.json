To investigate whether expression of TRIM55 was significantly changed during progression of HCC, we detected TRIM55 expression in 100 pairs of HCC tissues and neighboring tissues by immunohistochemistry. By using the 13-point score analysis of IHC, we found that the expression of TRIM55 in HCC tissues (76%, 76/100) was frequently lower than in neighboring tissues ( Figure 1A) . Then, we used single-factor analysis to investigate the relationship between TRIM55 expression and clinicopathologic features of HCC patients. The results showed that expression of TRIM55 was significantly associated with vessel invasion, tumor grade, and TNM stage (Table 1) .

To investigate the function of TRIM55 in HCC cells, we analyzed the relationship between expression of TRIM55 and clinicopathologic features, and found that TRIM55 was correlated with tumor vessel invasion. Then, we used Transwell assay to verify this, and the results showed that overexpression of TRIM55 leads to lower migration and invasion ability of HCC cells.

As expected, we found the expression of E-cadherin was increased and expression of Vimentin was decreased in HCC cells when TRIM55 was overexpressed. Similarly, as MMP2 was reported to be important for cell invasion through regulating cell matrix degradation [11] , and then we found that the expression of MMP2 was significantly decreased after TRIM55 was overexpressed in HCC cells.
