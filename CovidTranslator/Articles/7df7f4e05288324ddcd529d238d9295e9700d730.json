            "text": "Bovine torovirus (BToV) is recognized as an enteric pathogen of calves, but its etiological role in diarrhea and epidemiological characterization in adult cows remain unclear. In 2007-2008, three outbreaks of epidemic diarrhea occurred in adult cows at three dairy farms in Niigata Prefecture, Japan. BToV was the only enteric pathogen detected in these outbreaks, as determined by electron microscopy, reverse transcription-PCR, bacteria and parasite tests of fecal samples, and antibody tests with paired sera. The epidemiological features of the three outbreaks were similar to those of bovine coronavirus infection, except for the absence of bloody diarrhea, with diarrhea spreading among most adult cows, but not in calves, within several days and diarrhea lasting for 3-5 days with anorexia. Decreased milk production and mild respiratory symptoms were also observed in two of the outbreaks. Nucleotide sequence analysis of the BToV nucleocapsid, spike, and hemagglutinin-esterase (HE) genes revealed a close relatedness among the detected BToV strains from each outbreak and those of Japanese BToV strain Aichi/2004. Furthermore, we isolated a BToV strain, designated Niigata (TC), from a fecal sample using a human rectal tumor cell line. Sequence analysis of this isolate and Aichi/2004 indicated that both strains have truncated HE genes with deletions in the 3 0 region that occurred through cell culture-adaptation. The short projections that are believed to be formed by the HE protein on virus particles were not observed in these cultured strains by electron microscopy. Taken together, these results suggest that BToV causes epidemic diarrhea in adult cows and should be included in the differential diagnosis of diarrhea in adult cows. In addition, our findings indicate that the HE protein of BToV may not be necessary for viral replication.",

However, other viruses, including bovine torovirus (BToV), are also suspected to be etiologic agents of diarrhea [14, 15, 21] , although the epidemiological situation of infections caused by these viruses in adult cattle remains unclear.",

The virus has a single-stranded RNA genome of positive polarity encoding RNA polymerase and four structural proteins: the spike (S), membrane (M), hemagglutinin-esterase (HE), and nucleocapsid (N) proteins [5] . Since the first isolation of BToV in 1982 from a case of neonatal calf diarrhea in the United States [34] , several reports have confirmed the association of BToV with calf diarrhea in experimentally infected gnotobiotic calves and under field conditions [6, 8, 9, 13, 18] . Serological surveys have also revealed a high prevalence of antibodies to BToV in cattle populations, ranging between 55% and 95% [2, 14, 16, 33, 35] . Recently, Kuwabara et al. [16] succeeded in isolating BToV using a human rectal tumor cell line , which is expected to facilitate the diagnosis of BToV infection by virus neutralization tests and virus isolation.",

Confluent monolayers of these cells in 24-well plates were washed with Eagle's MEM (EMEM) and then inoculated with 0.1 ml of the fecal suspensions diluted from 1:10 to 1:1000 in EMEM with and without 10 lg/ml trypsin (Type I; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA). After adsorption for 60 min at 37\u00b0C, the cells were washed once with EMEM, 0.5 ml EMEM was added, and they were further incubated for 4 or 5 days at 37\u00b0C and examined for cytopathic effects (CPE). After incubation, the cells and culture supernatant were frozen and thawed once to harvest cell lysates, and subsequent passages were carried out in the same manner with 0.1 ml of cell lysate. After two passages, the viral isolate was cloned three times in HRT-18 cells by limiting dilution.",

In the HE gene, the detected open reading frames of strains Niigata1, Nii-gata2, Niigata3, and Aichi/2004(LIC) encoded 419 amino acids, which is identical to the number reported previously for other strains of BToV. In contrast, both cell-cultureadapted Aichi/2004 and Niigata3(TC) strains of BToV had incomplete HE open reading frames that only encoded 160 and 104 amino acids, respectively (Fig. 3) .",

However, prior to the present study, no conclusive evidence for a link between BToV and epidemic diarrhea in adult cattle had been reported. Furthermore, epidemiological characterization of these diarrheal outbreaks remained unclear. Here, we examined the etiological agents and conducted detailed serological tests with samples from three outbreaks of adult cattle diarrhea in Niigata, Japan, and found that BToV was the only causative pathogen. In the three outbreaks examined, most affected cows developed watery diarrhea, anorexia, and decreased milk production, and additionally, some cows also showed slight respiratory signs. The observed clinical signs were similar to those encountered in WD and BCV infections. Notably, none of the calves developed diarrhea during the outbreaks, a diagnostic characteristic that is also observed in WD and BCV infections in adult cows [27, 31] . Taken together, these results suggest that adult cattle diarrhea caused by BToV may have been misdiagnosed as WD or BCV infection by clinical investigations.",

Of note, a clear difference in sensitivity to BToV was observed between the two HRT-18 cell lines used in this study. Namely, the Nii-gata3(TC) strain could be isolated and propagated in HRT-18 Aichi cells, but not in HRT-18 Niigata cells. Similarly, strain Aichi/2004 could also not be propagated in HRT-18 Niigata cells, although both HRT-18 cell lines displayed high sensitivity to BCV (data not shown). These results indicate that the use of HRT-18 Aichi cells is critical for the in vitro propagation of BToV. Although the reason for the different sensitivity between the two HRT-18 cell lines to BToV is unknown, it is possible that the properties of the HRT-18 Aichi cells may have changed during passaging to increase BToV tropism. BToVs have been classified into two serotypes on the basis of reactivity in the hemagglutination/HI test [35] . Recently, however, BToVs have been proposed to consist of a single serotype that includes at least two subtypes [12] . In the present study, rabbit antisera to strain Aichi/ 2004 showed no significant differences in virus neutralizing antibody titers between the Aichi/2004 and Nii-gata3(TC) strains, suggesting that these two strains belong to the same serotype. Nucleotide sequence analysis indicated that the BToV strains detected in the fecal samples from three outbreaks in Niigata prefecture were closely related to each other and to strain Aichi/2004. This finding, together with the serological results, suggests that these Japanese BToV strains may have evolved from a recent common ancestor.",

Electron microscopy photographs indicated that virus particles in fecal samples had long and short projections, whereas short projections were not seen on those in the culture supernatants of infected HTR-18 cells. Interestingly, in many laboratory strains of mouse hepatitis virus, the HE genes are inactivated, which apparently represents an in vitro artifact resulting from adaptation to propagation in cultured cells [37] . It is noteworthy that cell-culture-adapted equine torovirus Berne virus also possesses a truncated HE gene with deletions in the 5 0 region [22] . Taken together with the data presented in this study, the HE protein in BToV may be unnecessary for viral replication. Further examination of the biological properties of the HE protein in fecal-and cell-culture-adapted strains of BToV is needed to confirm this speculation.",
