Compounds 6a, 6b, 6c and 6d exhibited notable antiviral activity against Coxsackie B4 virus, at EC 50 values ranging from 0.4 to 2.1 lg/mL. The selectivity index (ratio of cytotoxic to antivirally effective concentration) values of these compounds were between 9 and 56. Besides, 6b, 6c and 6d also inhibited the replication of two other RNA viruses, Sindbis virus and respiratory syncytial virus, although these EC 50 values were higher compared to those noted for Coxsackie B4 virus. The SAR analysis indicated that keeping the free thiosemicarbazide moiety is crucial to obtain this antiviral activity, since the cyclization products (7a-7g) did not produce any antiviral effect.",

CVB is also associated with a wide variety of other diseases, including diabetes, common cold, cardiomyopathy, neurological disorders and inflammation. 3 Outbreaks of CVB occur annually throughout the world. Several synthetic molecules have been reported to be selective inhibitors of enteroviruses, and some of these have entered into clinical trials.

Delavirdine (I), arbidol (II) and methisazone (III) (Fig. 1 ) are indole derived marketed drugs that have been used to treat viral diseases. Arbidol is an influenza virus inhibitor which is marketed in Russia, China and a few other countries. It was reported to have a wide spectrum of antiviral activity against a number of enveloped and non-enveloped viruses in addition to influenza viruses. 8 For instance, arbidol was found to exhibit potent inhibitory activity against CVB3 and CVB5. 3, 9 Another indole compound, N-methylisatin-b-thiosemicarbazone, methisazone, was used in the preventive treatment of smallpox after 1962. Based on in vitro studies, the antiviral spectrum of methisazone appears to include diverse DNA and RNA viruses. 10, 11 A series of investigations on isatin-b-thiosemicarbazones revealed their antiviral properties against various virus types, such as herpes simplex virus (HSV), 12 Moloney leukemia virus, 13 Japanese encephalitis virus 14 and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). 15 In a recent report by Zhang et al., 16 an isatin-b-hydrazone derivative (encoded ID45) was described as a promising antiviral agent against CVB3. Broad antiviral in vitro activity that includes CVB2 17 or CVB4 18 was further reported for some 2,3,5-trisubstituted indole derivatives synthesized by Giampieri et al. 17 and isoindolylureas synthesized by Verma et al. 18 Another class are indole-2-carboxamide derivatives, some of which were revealed to have promising antiviral properties during the http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bmc.2015.12.008 0968-0896/\u00d3 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

This effect, observed in two different cell lines (HeLa and Vero; Table 1 ), was quite strong since the antiviral EC 50 values were in the range of 0.4-2.1 lg/mL, and the values for the selectivity index (ratio of cytotoxic to antivirally effective concentration; see values between square brackets in Table 1) were between 9 and 56. Compound 6b (with an ethyl substituent) was slightly more potent than the analogs carrying a methyl (6a), propyl (6c) or allyl (6d) moiety; this is also visible from the doseresponse curves shown in Figure 2 . Besides, 6b, 6c and 6d also inhibited the replication of two other RNA viruses, Sindbis virus and respiratory syncytial virus, although these EC 50 values were higher compared to those noted for Coxsackie B4 virus. Of note, the analogs carrying a larger butyl (6e) or aromatic (6f and 6g) substituent at the R position were devoid of this antiviral activity. The crucial role of the free thiosemicarbazide moiety was evident from the fact that their cyclized analogs, 4-thiazolidinones (7a-7g), did not produce any antiviral effect.",

African green monkey kidney Vero cells were used to evaluate para-influenza virus type 3, reovirus type 1, Sindbis virus, Coxsackie B4 virus, and Punta Toro virus. Viruses evaluated on human embryonic lung fibroblast cells were herpes simplex virus types 1 and 2, vaccinia virus, and vesicular stomatitis virus. Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells were used for antiviral evaluation against influenza A and B viruses. Feline herpes virus and feline canine virus were grown in Crandell-Rees feline kidney cells. Finally, HIV-1 and HIV-2 were monitored in human T-lymphoblast MT4 cells. 29 To perform the antiviral assays, the viruses were added to subconfluent cultures of the cells in 96-well plates, and at the same time, the test compounds were added in serial dilutions. Appropriate reference compounds were included, that is, the viral entry inhibitor dextran sulfate (MW 5000); the broad antiviral agent ribavirin; the antiherpetic agents ganciclovir and brivudin and the HIV inhibitor azidothymidine. After 3-6 days incubation at 37\u00b0C (or 35\u00b0C in the case of influenza virus), the compounds' inhibitory effect on virus-induced cytopathic effect as well as their cytotoxicity were monitored by light microscopy or by performing the MTS cell viability assay (CellTiter 96 \u00d2 AQ ueous One Solution Cell Proliferation Assay from Promega). Antiviral activity was expressed as the 50% effective concentration (EC 50 ) whereas cytotoxicity was defined as the minimal cytotoxic concentration (based on microscopy) or CC 50 (50% cytotoxic concentration, assessed by the MTS assay).",
