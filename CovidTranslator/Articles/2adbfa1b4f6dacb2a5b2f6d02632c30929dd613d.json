To understand its pathogenesis, we developed an animal model using BALB/c mice and the mouse-passaged Frankfurt 1 isolate of SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV). We examined the immune responses to SARS-CoV in both young and adult mice. SARS-CoV induced severe respiratory illness in all adult, but not young, mice on day 2 after inoculation with a mortality rate of 30 to 50%. Moribund adult mice showed severe pulmonary edema and diffuse alveolar damage accompanied by virus replication. Adult murine lungs, which had significantly higher interleukin (IL)-4 and lower IL-10 and IL-13 levels before infection than young murine lungs, rapidly produced high levels of proinflammatory chemokines and cytokines known to induce macrophage and neutrophil infiltration and activation (eg , tumor necrosis factor-\u2423). On day 2 after inoculation , young murine lungs produced not only proinflammatory cytokines but also IL-2 , interferon-\u2425 , IL-10 , and IL-13. Adult mice showed early and acute excessive proinflammatory responses (ie , cytokine storm) in the lungs after SARS-CoV infection , which led to severe pulmonary edema and diffuse alveolar damage. Intravenous injection with anti-tumor necrosis factor-\u2423 antibody 3 hours after infection had no effect on SARS-CoV infection. However , intraperitoneal interferon-\u2425 injection protected adult mice from the lethal respiratory illness. The experimental model described here may be useful for elucidating the pathophysiology of SARS and for evaluating therapies to treat SARS-CoV infection.",

            "text": "In the severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) epidemic of winter 2002 to 2003, \u03f3800 people (10% of the \u03fe8000 SARS patients) suffered progressive respiratory failure and died. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] Common symptoms of SARS include fever, nonproductive cough, myalgia, and dyspnea. An age of 60 years or older, co-morbid disease, male sex, high neutrophil counts, and several biochemical abnormalities are associated with poor outcomes. 6 -10 The SARS-CoV spike (S) protein mediates the infection of cells bearing an appropriate receptor. 11 One such receptor is angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which binds SARS-CoV S protein with high affinity. [11] [12] [13] [14] That the binding of SARS-CoV to ACE2 may contribute to SARS-CoV-associated pathology is suggested by several reports showing that angiotensin II expression promotes severe lung failure on acute lung injury whereas ACE2 expression protects from lung injury. 15, 16 However, it is likely that the acute lung injury caused by SARS-CoV infection is also attributable to a complex pathophysiological process in which inflammatory cytokines released by activated alveoli macrophages induce immune system dysregulation. [17] [18] [19] [20] To understand the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV, the SARS-CoV susceptibility of experimental animals such as monkeys, cats, ferrets, mice, pigs, guinea pigs, ham-sters, chickens, and rats has been investigated. 2, 4, [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] All of these animals are susceptible to SARS-CoV after intrarespiratory inoculation and exhibit virus excretion in pharyngeal or nasal swabs, histopathological pulmonary lesions, and seroconversion. However, the course of infection in these animals is shorter than that in humans.",

We found that the severe inflammation in the adult rats was associated with high levels of inflammatory cytokines in the serum and lung homogenates, especially interleukin (IL)-6, along with low levels of the immunosuppressive cytokine IL-10. IL-6 is an inflammatory cytokine that is produced by monocytes, leukocytes, endothelial cells, fibroblasts, and alveolar epithelial cells. SARS patients have significantly elevated serum IL-6 levels. 19 IL-10 is produced by macrophages, Th2 lymphocytes, and B cells and inhibits tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u2423 production and neutrophil activation in lipopolysaccharide-induced acute lung injury, thereby suppressing lung tissue injury. 35 It has been reported that serum IL-10 levels increase in SARS patients during the convalescence phase. 19 In this study, we established a new and more useful experimental small animal model for SARS by using BALB/c mice and mouse-passaged SARS-CoV. This model allows us to better characterize the virus-host relationship and determine which immune responses are antiviral and which are pathogenic. Here, we sought to determine why SARS-CoV infection is more frequently lethal in elderly patients by comparing SARS-CoV-infected adult and young mice in terms of their pulmonary pathology and immune responses.",

Titers of this stock virus were expressed as 50% of the tissue culture infectious dose (TCID 50 )/ml on Vero E6 cells, which was calculated according to the Behrens-K\u00e4 rber method. Work with infectious SARS-CoV was performed under biosafety level 3 conditions. Compared to the original virus, the Frankfurt 1 isolate used in our laboratory has one amino acid change at position 641 (His to Tyr) in the S protein and another in open reading frame (ORF) 1a 429 (Ala to Ser). These changes presumably arose during the passage through Vero E6 cells.",

However, the two groups did not differ significantly in terms of virus titers in the respiratory tracts ( Figure 7C ). The IFN-\u2425-treated mice showed much milder histopathological changes than the untreated mice because only very mild edema with slight mononuclear cell infiltration was observed around the blood vessels after the infection ( Figure 7D ). In contrast, the PBS-treated mice exhibited severe edema and infiltration of inflammatory cells, mainly neutrophils, around blood vessels ( Figure 7E ). By examining Evans blue dye extravasation, we found the IFN-\u2425treated mice also had lower blood vessel permeability than the PBS-treated mice (Figure 8, A-G) . Together, these results suggest that IFN-\u2425 treatment 3 hours after inoculation protected the mice from severe SARS-CoVinduced pulmonary edema that was responsible for the death of the untreated adult mice.

            "text": "To understand better the pathogenesis of SARS after SARS-CoV infection, we developed a useful experimental mouse model of SARS. When the Frankfurt 1 isolate of SARS-CoV was serially passaged in vivo in young BALB/c mice, the passaged virus (F-musX-VeroE6) exhibited in-creased infectivity in the murine lung. F-musX-VeroE6 was also able to induce severe SARS-like illness in adult (6-month-old) BALB/c mice and several animals died of severe pulmonary edema and acute alveolar damage. However, young (4-week-old) mice were relatively resistant to F-musX-VeroE6 and did not evince any obvious respiratory illness. When the immune responses of in- fected young and adult mice were compared, the adult animals had significantly lower pre-existing lymphocyte and CD4 \u03e9 and CD8 \u03e9 T-cell counts, their lungs expressed significantly higher IL-4 and lower IL-10 and IL-13 levels before infection, and their lungs did not show the strong up-regulation of IL-2 (a T-cell cytokine), IL-10, IL-13, and IFN-\u2425 that was exhibited by the young murine lungs after infection. During the infection, the lungs of adult mice also produced inflammatory chemokine-/cytokine-related macrophages (ie, MCP-1, MIP-1 and IP-10, IL-1\u2423, IL-1\u2424, and TNF-\u2423) earlier than young mice (day 1 after inoculation) and at higher levels. They also had higher IL-6 levels on day 3 after inoculation. In contrast, the young mice produced high levels of inflammatory chemokines and cytokines (ie, MCP-1, MIP-1, IP-10, KC, MIG, VEGF, and IL-1\u2423) on day 2 after inoculation and produced very little IL-6 at any time point. These observations suggest that advanced-age BALB/c mice have an early and acutely excessive proinflammatory cytokine reactions (ie, a cytokine storm) in response to F-musX-VeroE6. This cytokine storm results in severe pulmonary edema with macrophage and neutrophil infiltration, which causes severe acute lung injury and is likely to be the cause of death in infected adult mice. Supporting this scenario are reports of age-related differences in pulmonary cytokine and chemokine responses to other pathogens, especially Th1 and Th2 cytokine imbalances. [31] [32] [33] Moreover, recent reports showed that unregulated IFN responses during acute SARS prevented SARS-CoV-infected patients from switching from innate to adaptive immunity, 39, 40 and some reports described that IFN-\u2425 may be responsible for lung immunopathology in SARS patients. 41, 42 Interestingly, in our model, injection of IFN-\u2425 3 hours after inoculation significantly reduced the acute pulmonary edema induced by infection. Notably, these protective effects of IFN-\u2425 injection were not associated with reductions in viral titers in the lung. This animal model and human results seem not to be consistent. However, these observations together suggest that the failure of the adult animals to produce IFN-\u2425, which is a prominent immunomodulator that plays a key role in host defense against intracellular pathogens, 43,44 was responsible for their inability to control the excessive and pathogenic innate immune response to the virus in the lung. Supporting this is our previous study on the rat SARS model, which showed that although adult rats developed severe inflammatory reactions that led to pulmonary edema, all of the infected animals survived; significantly, the infected adult rats had similar cytokine profiles as infected adult mice except that they also produced IFN-\u2425. 34 Thus, a strong and timely IFN-\u2425 response may be needed to prevent the immunopathology induced by SARS-CoV infection.",

            "text": "With regard to the inflammatory reactions in the F-musX-VeroE6-infected adult lung, our histopathological and chemokine/cytokine analyses suggested that on day 1 after inoculation, the affected respiratory epithelial cells and pulmonary macrophages released acute inflammatory chemokines (MCP-1, MIP-1, IP-10) and cytokines (IL-1, TNF-\u2423, IL-12). Thus, pulmonary macrophage activation associated with the release of TNF-\u2423 and IL-1 appears to predominate in the early phase of the inflammatory reaction in adults. TNF-\u2423 and IL-1 are classic acute inflammatory cytokines that recruit neutrophils and monocytes to the area of infection along with increasing vascular permeability, where they activate these cells so that they can eradicate the pathogens. However, when TNF-\u2423 is overexpressed, it can induce systemic clinical and pathological abnormalities such as depressing cardiac dysfunction and cardiomyocyte death. 45, 46 This double-edged aspect of TNF-\u2423 function may be why there were no effects of neutralizing TNF-\u2423 antibodies on SARS-CoV infection in this model. Supporting the key role of TNF-\u2423 in F-musX-VeroE6-induced immunopathology is that the lungs of the adult mice on days 3 and 5 after inoculation were infiltrated with predominantly neutrophils; these mice also exhibited neutrophilia. Young mice did not evince these changes. This suggested that infected adult mice produce TNF-\u2423, which then induces neutrophil-mediated inflammation in their lungs. Although the significance of this is not clear, high neutrophil infiltration in the lung is known to be the cause or the result of lung injury characterized by hyaline membrane formation and pulmonary edema. 47 High neutrophil counts in human SARS cases have also been associated with poor outcomes. 8, 10 We observed in the anti-TNF-\u2423 antibody and IFN-\u2425injection experiments that the control groups, which were injected 3 hours after infection with rat IgG serum intravenously or PBS intraperitoneally, showed body weight loss starting on day 1 after inoculation. In contrast, untreated mice (such as those shown in Figures 1F and 2A) only started to lose weight on day 2 after inoculation. It may be that the injection with serum or PBS after the infection enhanced the pulmonary edema by hyperpermeability in the lung.",

The amino acid change may be responsible, at least in part, for the increased replication of F-musX-VeroE6 in the pulmonary tissue of BALB/c mice. [12] [13] [14] [15] 34, 48 Using another SARS-CoV isolate (Urbani), Roberts and colleagues 48 have described the development and characterization of the mouse-adapted strain MA15, which is lethal for young (6-to 8-week-old) female BALB/c mice after intranasal inoculation. Compared with the original Urbani isolate, the MA15 strain had six coding mutations that may have been responsible for the mouse adaptation and increased virulence of this strain. The fewer amino acid mutations in our mouse-adapted F-musX-VeroE6 strain may be responsible for the fact that it is less virulent than MA15.",

            "text": "In conclusion, we developed an experimental mouse animal model of SARS by using in vivo-passaged SARS-CoV and BALB/c mice. We found that the virus was lethal in adult mice because they generated an excessive innate immune response that induced lethal pulmonary edema and diffuse alveolar damage with infiltration of macrophages and neutrophils. IFN-\u2425 appears to play an important role in modulating the innate immune response because IFN-\u2425 treatment protected the animals from the lethal respiratory illness. This study, along with our previous study 34 and studies of humans infected with SARS-CoV during the SARS epidemic of winter of 2002 to 2003, 6 -10 improve our understanding of SARS pathogenesis because they indicate that both advanced age and virus adaptation to a particular animal species may dictate the pathogenic capacity of SARS-CoV. The new experimental model described here may also be useful for elucidating the pathophysiology of SARS and for evaluating anti-SARS-CoV vaccine candidates and antiviral agents.",
