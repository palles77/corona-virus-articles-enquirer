            "text": "Background: To control the spread of Corona Virus Disease , 30 screening large numbers of suspected cases for appropriate quarantine and 31 treatment is a priority. Pathogenic laboratory testing is the diagnostic gold standard 32 but it is time consuming with significant false negative results. Fast and accurate 33 diagnostic methods are urgently needed to combat the disease. Based on 34 COVID-19 radiographical changes in CT images, we aimed to develop a deep 35 learning method that could extract COVID-19's graphical features in order to provide 36 a clinical diagnosis ahead of the pathogenic test, thus saving critical time for 37 disease control. 38 Methods and Findings: We collected 1,065CT images of pathogen-confirmed 39 COVID-19 cases (325 images) along with those previously diagnosed with typical 40 viral pneumonia (740 images). We modified the Inception transfer-learning model 41 to establish the algorithm, followed by internal and external validation. The internal 42 validation achieved a total accuracy of 89.5% with specificity of 0.88 and sensitivity 43 of 0.87. The external testing dataset showed a total accuracy of 79.3% with 44 specificity of 0.83 and sensitivity of 0.67. In addition, in 54 COVID-19 images that 45 first two nucleic acid test results were negative, 46 were predicted as COVID-19 46 positive by the algorithm, with the accuracy of 85.2%. 47 Conclusion: These results demonstrate the proof-of-principle for using 48 artificial intelligence to extract radiological features for timely and accurate 49 COVID-19 diagnosis.",

Since the beginning of the 76 outbreak, the efficiency of nucleic acid testing has been dependent on several 77 rate-limiting factors, including availability and quantity of the testing kits in the 78 affected area. More importantly, the quality, stability and reproducibility of the 79 detection kits are questionable. The impact of methodology, disease stages, 80 specimen collection methods, nucleic acid extraction methods, and the 81 amplification system are all determinant factors for the accuracy of test results. 82 Conservative estimates of the detection rate of nucleic acid are low (between 83 30-50%) [7, 8, 9] , and tests need to be repeated several times in many cases 84 before they can be confirmed.",

Using the supercomputer system, the time for each case takes only about 10 seconds, and it can be performed remotely via a shared public platform. Therefore, further developing this system can significantly shorten the diagnosis time for disease screening, especially at the time when many places have nucleic acid test shortage. Our study represents the first study to apply artificial intelligence technologies to CT images for effectively screening for COVID-19.The gold standard for COVID-19 diagnosis has been nucleic acid based detection for the existence of specific sequences of the SARS-COV-2 gene.While we still value the importance of nucleic acid detection in the diagnosis of SARS-COV-2 infection, we must also note that the high number of false negatives due to several factors such as methodological disadvantages, disease stages, and methods for specimen collection might delay diagnosis and disease control. Recent data have suggested that the accuracy of nucleic acid testing is only about 30-50% [6,7,8]. Using CT imaging feature extraction, we are able to achieve above 89.5% accuracy, significantly outplaying nucleic acid testing. More interestingly, testing CT images from COVID-19 patients when initial pathogenic testing came negative, our model has achieved the accuracy of 85.2% for correctly predicting COVID-19.
