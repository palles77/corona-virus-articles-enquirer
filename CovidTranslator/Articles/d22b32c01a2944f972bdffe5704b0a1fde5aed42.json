Clinical signs, synovial fluid analysis, serological tests and radiographic appearance could not differentiate between immune-mediated and infective arthritis. Mycoplasma gateae was isolated by strictly anaerobic culture of the synovial fluid. Treatment with Enrofloxacin led to a rapid improvement of the cat's condition. Two months later the cat was euthanased because of severe glomerulonephritis and direct Coombs' test positive anaemia, possibly caused by mycoplasma infection. M gateae could not be isolated at post-mortem examination.",

If no infectious agent can be identified, immune-based arthritis (feline non-infective polyarthritis) is suspected. According to radiographic appearance immune-based polyarthritis is divided into erosive and nonerosive forms (Bennett and Nash 1988) . This differentiation can be very difficult particularly in the early stages, as radiographic signs appear later in the disease course (Carr and Michels 1997) . The main types of erosive immune-based polyarthritis are the periosteal proliferative form with marked periostal new bone formation and the rheumatoid form, resembling rheumatoid arthritis in humans and dogs. Non-erosive arthritis is seen in cases of systemic lupus erythematosus (uncommon), in association with a chronic infective process elsewhere in the body, gastrointestinal disease and neoplastic diseases (Bennett and Nash 1988) .",

The specific gravity of the urine (cystocentesis) was 1.014. An abdominal ultrasonographic examination showed enlarged hyperechoic kidneys (left kidney 4.01 \u00c2 2.37 cm, right kidney 4.1201 \u00c2 2.35 cm). With a protein/creatinine ratio of 9.1 (normal < 1, Hitachi 911, Roche) and the presence of granular and hyaline casts with very few leukocytes and no erythrocytes in the urine, glomerulonephritis was suspected. Radiographs of the hocks and carpi showed no periarticular softtissue swelling. Bones of the tarsal joints had decreased bone radiodensity with hardly visible erosive lesions.",

Signs usually appear 2e3 weeks after infection starts. Extra-and intravascular haemolysis (Gehrs and Friedberg 2002) and thrombocytopenia (Venkatesan et al 1996) are possible. Renal complications (interstitial nephritis and glomerulonephritis) are seen in less than 10% of human patients with atypical pneumonia caused by M pneumoniae (Sauter et al 1989) .

Autoantibodies causing haemolytic anaemia can be seen in cats with M haemofelis infection (Zulty and Kociba 1990) . We hypothesise that the Coombs' positive anaemia, thrombocytopenia and the renal failure of our cat could have been a direct sequel of mycoplasma infection.
