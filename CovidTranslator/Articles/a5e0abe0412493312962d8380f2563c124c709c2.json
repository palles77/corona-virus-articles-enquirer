Objective: To develop a psychometrically sound instrument for identifying and measuring the core competencies needed by Chinese nursing baccalaureate graduates. Design: Descriptive correlational and multicentre study. Setting: Seven major tertiary teaching hospitals and three major medical universities in Beijing. Participants: 790 subjects, including patients, nursing faculty members, doctors and nurses. Method: A reliable and valid self-report instrument, consisting of 58 items, was developed using multiple methods. It was then distributed to 790 subjects to measure nursing competency in a broader Chinese context. The psychometric characteristics of reliability and validity were supported by descriptive and inferential analyses. Results: The final instrument consists of six dimensions with 47 items. The content validity index was 0.90. The overall scale reliability was 0.97 with dimensions range from 0.87 to 0.94. Six domains of core competencies were identified: professionalism; direct care; support and communication; application of professional knowledge; personal traits; and critical thinking and innovation. Conclusion: The findings of this study provide valuable evidence for a psychometrically sound measurement tool, as well as for competency-based nursing curriculum reform.",

Therefore, nurses are required to have a broader knowledge base than ever before, and are under pressure to master clinical skills including communication, critical thinking, patient counseling and health education, and health promotion. However, researchers have shown that nursing graduates not only lack the knowledge but also often lack the skills and behaviors which are critical in providing high quality nursing care (Edgren, 2006; Hsieh and Hsu, 2013) .",

Therefore, the traditional educational model for providing nursing students with the knowledge and skills they will need in their future careers is no longer suitable. In 2004 and 2005, the American National League for Nursing (NLN) called for nursing educators to reform curriculum structure, and endorsed a Position Statement on Innovation in Nursing Education which suggested that competency-based education should be the fourth generation teaching model (Pardue et al., 2005) . These ideas were strongly reinforced in the Commission for Education of Health Professionals in the 21st century, which called for reforms to be generalized to all health professions (Frenk et al., 2010) .",

Logically then, as role responsibilities in mainland China are different from those in the UK, Australia, the United States, and Taiwan (Tzeng, 2004) , exploration of these competencies is necessary. However, the core competencies for mainland Chinese nurses have neither been widely investigated nor reported in the literature. Although Liu et al.

Regardless of the various routes used to develop competency frameworks, subjects only included nurses or nursing experts (but not the recipients of care) as research informants, and typically applied the Delphi technique to reach a consensus on themes. This could have substantial bias because the opinions of patients and doctors are regarded by some as the most important to health service and should be considered when identifying nurses' core competencies (Davis et al., 2008) . A blend of methods therefore seems more appropriate.",

The participants were also told that participation was voluntary, and verbal consent was obtained as written consent was wavered by the Capital Medical University Review Board. The study was conducted in seven major tertiary teaching hospitals and three major medical universities in Beijing from Jun 2007 to September 2008, using a descriptive correlational research design. An expert panel suggested the best people to decide the levels of competence required should be mainly nurses and nursing faculty, and the opinion of doctors and patients should also be taken into consideration because they are the customers and colleagues crucial to the service (Davis et al., 2008) . The sample was selected with the assistance of senior nurse managers and academics who also facilitated the distribution and collection of the questionnaires. In order to minimize the selection bias, senior nurse managers and academics were contacted in advance and asked about how to select a sample with least bias and also asked to include all participants that met the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The inclusion criterion were: (1) nursing faculty members who worked in the three major medical universities;",

As in foreign countries, nurses in China with masters or doctoral degrees mostly choose to work in universities (Jiang and Luo, 2006) . Combined with the relatively small number of Master and Doctoral students, this has placed pressure on baccalaureate nursing graduates who are expected not only to be competent in clinical work but also able to carry out high-quality research and facilitate the development of clinical nursing. FactorII, direct care, accounted for 12.15% of the variance. It consisted of ten items, focusing on nursing skills for delivering patient care. The definitive item, 'undertake basic nursing skills safely and confidently' with a factor loading of 0.76, describes the essence of this factor.

This reflects the common nature of nursing worldwide, especially with regard to the core competencies required of a safe graduate nurse irrespective of their nationality. This is especially remarkable given that the sample in this study were homogenous Chinese, whereas the other countries mentioned are increasingly multi-cultural in nature and this is reflected in the nursing workforce.",

Unlike previous studies conducted in other countries, the sample for this study included not only peer nurses and nurse experts but also doctors and patients, which helped to decrease the bias and make the findings more reliable and generalizable. The factor analysis further tested the interrelationships of competencies among the sample, which helped to better understand the meaning of the competency model. (Utley-Smith, 2004) . Despite these strengths, the sample was selected with the assistance of senior nurse managers and academics which might lead to selection bias. Nurse managers were communicated with in advance about how to select a sample with the least bias yet almost all potential participants were included. Besides, the representative nature of the results could be viewed as limited because these competencies were specific to Beijing and probably applicable at a national level. Further studies across the country are clearly needed. However, given that the tertiary hospitals in Beijing are more specialized with more complicated patients cases, than secondary hospitals across the country, it would be reasonable to expect that if nurses in secondary hospitals are competent by these standards then they should be competent in secondary hospitals, elsewhere in the country.",
