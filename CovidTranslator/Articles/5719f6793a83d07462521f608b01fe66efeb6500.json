First, we argue that additional elements could be included in measures of value, but such elements have not generally been included in measures of quality-adjusted lifeyears. For example, we describe a recently developed extended costeffectiveness analysis (ECEA) that provides a good example of how to use a broader concept of utility. ECEA adds two features-measures of financial risk protection and income distributional consequences. We then discuss a further option for expanding this approach-augmented CEA, which can introduce many value measures. Neither of these approaches, however, provide a comprehensive measure of value. To resolve this issue, we review a technique called multicriteria decision analysis that can provide a comprehensive measure of value. We then discuss budget-setting and prioritization using multicriteria decision analysis, issues not yet fully resolved. Next, we discuss deliberative processes, which represent another important approach for population-or plan-level decisions used by many health technology assessment bodies. These use quantitative information on CEA and other elements, but the group decisions are reached by a deliberative voting process. Finally, we briefly discuss the use of stated preference methods for developing \"hedonic\" value frameworks, and conclude with some recommendations in this area.",

Because they originate in utility maximization for a single individual, they cannot accommodate societal issues that involve (among other things) the distribution of costs and benefits across a population. For example, the US 1939 Flood Control Act specified that water projects could be undertaken only when \"the benefits, to whomever they accrue, [be] in excess of the estimated costs.\" These \"distributional issues\" remain outside the domain of traditional CEA and CBA. Thus, the problem is how best to aggregate the benefits enjoyed and the costs borne by individuals into a societal statement of value. Bator [1] proposes (in effect) a benign dictator whose utility function includes the utilities of individuals in the population, allowing different weights for different people, but this is seldom if ever operationalized meaningfully.",

In the first section, we argue that additional elements could be included in measures of value, but such elements have not generally been included in measures of QALYs. As a specific example, in the second section we describe a recently developed methodology called \"extended\" CEA (ECEA) that provides a good example of how to use a broader concept of utility, which has been applied to some specific interventions. ECEA adds two features-the element of financial risk protection (one part of insurance value assessed in the article by Garrison et al. [2] ) and income distributional consequences. The third section discusses further options for expanding this approach (what we call \"augmented\" CEA [ACEA]). In the fourth section we discuss another, even broader approach called multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) that has some intuitive appeal, especially for decision makers who consider other elements or components not easily measured in CEA or CBA. This approach requires that decision makers place quantitative weights on the various criteria, depending on their relative importance for a decision. This exercise can make group decision making more transparent. The fifth section discusses budget-setting and prioritization in these frameworks, building upon the previous discussion in the article by Danzon et al. [3] discussing the situation in which budget allocations and decision-making cutoffs are not perfectly aligned. The sixth section discusses deliberative processes that represent another important approach for population-or planlevel decisions that is used by many HTA bodies. It uses quantitative information on CEA and other elements, but in the end, the group decision is reached by a deliberative voting process. This section also includes a brief discussion of alternative voting methods that deliberative bodies might use.",

Consider, as an example, a vaccine against or the treatment of a virulent disease such as Zika and Ebola or historical predecessors such as leprosy, tuberculosis, poliomyelitis, severe acute respiratory syndrome, and AIDS. Public policy in these cases is often driven by issues such as public fear of contagion that are not readily captured in traditional CEA models. Such models normally do not include the entire at-risk population and their disutility from the threat of the disease. The missing element is the loss of utility associated with the potential risk of exposure to the diseasethe \"fear factor.\" This fear has dominated public policy toward these diseases for millennia, resulting in isolation colonies for people with leprosy, quarantine rules for tuberculosis, travel bans during severe acute respiratory syndrome epidemics, and many other similar actions. An associated issue is the utility gained from permanently eliminating the disease, raising a further important issue-namely, aggregating costs and benefits across future generations of the population.",

As a further refinement (separate from gathering information about these added dimensions of value), ECEA collects this information for different subpopulations of interest, thus allowing consideration of distribution of benefits and costs (equity and fairness). Financial risk protection reflects the reduction in the risk of financial distress due to health care costs, or the financial costs of poor health. It represents a subset of the \"insurance value\" concept discussed in the article by Lakdawalla et al. [4] . Cost is measured from the perspective of the society as a whole, as is common in CEA. One could envision including additional measures of value, but ECEA consists of these three.

By subgroup, ECEA then reports the health gains, private expenditures avoided, and financial risk protection. Health gains can be measured using QALYs or other suitable units. Private expenditures avoided reflect the reduction in out-of-pocket spending by subgroup. Theoretically, this includes the totality of effects on private spending, including changes in non-health-related spending. Financial risk protection is measured as expenditures avoided suitably scaled by an individual's income.

Garber and Phelps [8] reference the corporate finance literature to estimate r* \u00bc \u2212r* income between 1 and 4. New work [9] using labor supply data puts the value of r* slightly below 1, and rules out values greater than 2. Variances are difficult to estimate even with large data sets in health care because of the large coefficients of skewness and kurtosis in medical expenditure data, and the requirement of having data representing expenditure distributions for people with similar or identical insurance coverage and health risks. Much can be written about each of these approaches, but the common feature is some measure of expenditures avoided, relative to the individual's willingness to bear financial burden. None of these alternatives measure perfectly the aspect of risk that is captured by variance in financial outlays and embedded in the standard risk-aversion measure.",

A second approach is to selectively, and systematically, add elements to either the numerator (net cost) or the denominator (net benefit as measured in QALYs or utility) as most appropriate. This approach has the advantage of retaining a cost-per-outcome ratio form, but is likely to affect what threshold is applicable. A third approach is to monetize all benefits so that a net monetary benefit can be calculated. Nevertheless, many health policy analysts and their clients find the step of monetizing health and related benefits objectionable. Indeed, that very objection led to the adoption of CEA over the previously developed CBA to valuing health-related investments. Net monetary benefit accomplishes the aggregation across different dimensions of value by using the same potentially objectionable step of monetizing each type of benefit. A fourth approach solves this problem by providing a way to aggregate the multiple elements of value into a single, nonmonetary metric-the topic we consider next.",

In general, these approaches elicit from the \"decision maker\" the trade-off values to incorporate issues that cannot or have not been included in CEA or CBA. Thus, these models provide a unified one-dimensional measure of value of alternative choices using a multi-attribute metric that combines the preference weights specified by the decision maker and the performance of alternative \"candidates\" along each of the dimensions of value. Although other approaches exist, the two most common MCDA methods used in health care are the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and the multi-attribute utility theory (MAUT). In the simplest form (linear MAUT), the value score is a weighted linear sum of each candidate's performance along each relevant dimension. More complex models use multiplicative models.

Nevertheless, rather than estimating them from observed behavior, as economists might normally do, they seek to elicit the trade-offs through various structured processes. These weights will likely differ considerably across different stakeholders (e.g., provider, payers, or patients) and may well differ even within any of these groups. MCDA models have a series of specific advantages compared with less formal processes [14] . In particular, using formal MCDA models 1. makes the decision-making process more transparent; 2. guides investment in data improvement (to where it most affects decisions); 3. allows a \"test drive\" of alternative program specifications in multidimensional value space; 4. allows \"reverse engineering\" to improve product specifications; 5. bypasses many cognitive errors made in intuitive human judgments; and 6. may assist in decision convergence for divergent interests.",

Each might choose different dimensions of value, or could share some, but with different weights. Others with more defined self-interests (providers, producers, and payers) would likely have differing perspectives [14] . Different stakeholders may well have different perspectives (and hence weights) in an MCDA, but the proper use of two perspectives seems clear to us. First, MCDA models should always be presented-at a minimum-using a societal or payer perspective for the same reasons that the societal or payer perspective should always be presented as one option in CEA models. In a specific example, health plans (either public or private) should use a societal or payer perspective in determining coverage of medical interventions (what is covered and at what cost to the patient) and reimbursement to providers.

Such formal models might help patients choose among complex alternatives such as alternative chemotherapies for cancer, surgical versus medical intervention for some disorders, or various strategies for mental illnesses.

In brief, this approach scales the CEA \"cutoff value\" WTP for a QALY upward to account for other dimensions of value not measured in the CEA framework. Thus, for example, if QALYs accounted for two-thirds of the weight (or value) in an MCDA model, and the WTP for a QALY CEA cutoff value was $100,000/QALY, then the MCDA value-tocost cutoff would be 3/2 times the WTP for a QALY value CEA cutoff, or (in this example) $150,000 per unit of MCDA value. In effect, agreed-upon values for a WTP for a QALY CEA cutoff (such as may exist) serve as a numeraire to estimate the total value of the expanded multicriteria value index. By analogy, it would be like adding new safety features to automobiles and then re-evaluating them taking the new features into account. The overall WTP for any automobile should expand with new safety features added, but the rankings of value would shift depending on how much new safety enhancement was built into any particular model, and each vehicle would then be ranked on the ratio of its new MCDA value to its cost.",

First, consider this issue in the familiar context of CEA. It might arise, for example, when a prototypical \"Minister of Health\" establishes the CEA cutoff, whereas a \"Minister of Finance\" establishes the budget for the health care system. Even if initially in balance, new technologies or health care interventions might emerge that had an \"acceptable\" CEA cutoff, yet their inclusion into the package of services offered to enrollees might greatly exceed the budget. Drugs to treat hepatitis C appear to have created this issue in some situations, and (for example) the emergence of an effective treatment for Alzheimer's disease could well cause it to appear in the future. This issue has been described as the problem of \"affordability.\" In this situation, the budget creates an implicit cost-effectiveness cutoff that is more stringent than the official cutoff. Economists call this the \"shadow price.\"",

When a misalignment occurs, it would appear that any of four logical solutions are available (none exclusionary to the others): 1) increase the budget (Future budget expansion may not be inevitable. One could imagine cases in which a high expenditure for an intervention \"today\" reduced subsequent-year budgets, e.g., through elimination of a contagious disease or for reduced future liver transplant costs from lower alcoholic cirrhosis. Proper intertemporal budgeting with discounting would accommodate such issues, but politically set budgets commonly do not have the appropriate temporal horizon, and thus cannot accommodate such issues readily.); 2) tighten the official CEA (or MCDA) cutoff; 3) cut back on or eliminate interventions with excessive CEA ratios (or in an MCDA world, with poor MCDA value-to-cost ratios); or 4) as a variant on point 2, estimate the shadow cutoff value implied by the budget and use that as the \"real\" CEA (or MCDA) cutoff. In situations such as these, resolving the lack of alignment between cutoff rules and budgets must-at least in the short and intermediate runaccount for costs of change and other issues discussed previously in the article by Danzon et al.

Some of the added value (as measured by the MCDA approach) may well lie outside the domain of health, for example, elements of value arising in the domains of education, social justice, or others. Budgets of health care providers or payers would not normally incorporate these \"other\" issues, hence exacerbating nonalignment between budgets and prespecified MCDA cutoffs. Offsetting these potential increases, some existing interventions might fall in overall value as measured by the MCDA approach than previously ranked using only CEA.

In group decision-making processes, simple voting rules are normally used to elicit the \"group value\" structure. The problems from this approach are well known. Most importantly, this independent pairwise evaluation process admits inconsistencies in the final value structure, which must either be ignored or resolved through re-evaluation. Second, the process for converting the data to usable weights relies on mathematical methods that are difficult for most people to understand, and hence create a sort of \"black box\" methodology.

A standard approach sets boundary values for the highest and lowest levels of utility created in single dimensions and then elicits \"swing weights\" to capture relative value of each attribute, known as the Simple Multi-Attribute Rating Tool using Swings ( SMARTS) [13] . This model and variants are widely used in MAUT. An easier refinement elicits the value structure by simply asking \"the decision maker\" to list the attributes in rank order, and then creates a set of weights that give the average of all possible weights consistent with the rank order. This approach (known as SMARTER) has been shown to closely approximate the results using exact measures of value rather than these simple approximations [15] . But this process brings its own difficulties. Most importantly, this MAUT approach requires that \"the decision maker\" specify for each attribute a lower bound (the amount of the attribute that creates zero added utility) and an upper bound (the amount of the attribute that creates maximum utility). This approach violates the standard economic concept that \"more is always better\" by setting an upper bound on utility. More importantly, these \"boundary\" values create a metric to measure performance of each candidate on each dimension of value, typically scaled to 0-1 or 0-100, and the value weights interact with the \"measuring stick.\" Thus if the MAUT software's \"measuring stick\" metrics differ from those held in the minds of \"the decision maker,\" the results do not represent what the decision maker intended. More detailed discussions of these issues are available [13, 16] .",

For example, AHP requires a series of N*(N-1) pairwise votes to choose the more important of each possible pair of N value dimensions, and then another vote to specify the relative importance (ranging from 1 to 9 typically). MAUT using the SMARTER process requires that the group agree on a rank-order listing of the importance of the N value dimensions [13] . Multiple voting techniques are available to accomplish these tasks, and they (not uncommonly) give different answers from the same group of voters.",

Even if the choices are reduced to pairwise comparisons using some structured technique as Roberts' Rules of Order, the opportunity for strategic manipulation of the outcome through agenda control looms in many settings [35] . While we have no particular recommendation about choice of voting rules, we believe that groups undertaking such votes either with MCDA models or deliberative processes should carefully consider the voting methods they adopt and understand the potential consequences for their choices. A large literature on social choice theory (too large to reference here) can help guide these choices. adequately explored. This can be improved, both by the introduction of cost-per-QALY evidence and by the use of more structured decision making to take account of preferences about the weight to be given to health gain-for example, about disease severity, equity of access, or unmet need. A systematic comparison of the processes used by various private and public pharmacy and therapeutic committees and HTA programs may further help others determine best practices for their own setting.",

Just as the current \"criterion standard\" of CEA did not begin in its current form, we can expect that MCDA will evolve for the better in the future. In CEA, both for lack of the proper conceptual framework and for lack of data, earlier efforts focused on things that were easily measurable. These first included \"deaths averted\" or similar measures, and soon expanded to \"life-years saved\" or similar measures. Then came the notion of quality adjustment, leading to the current metric of the QALY based on work that relies on population-based estimates of reported quality adjustments for different health-related conditions. A similar but not identical measure-DALY-is used by the World Health Organization, the World Bank, and others: for this measure, expert judgment has been used (at least initially) rather than population survey data to create the adjustment factors [17] , although DALY estimates increasingly turn to population-based metrics when available. A third related measure is the capabilitiesadjusted life-year, using a capabilities index instead of a health state utility, initially proposed by Amartya Sen, progressed by Nussbaum [39] , and operationalized by Anand et al. [40] .",
