Annually, approximately 5 million children and infants die worldwide due to diarrheal diseases. In North America, the rate per year is still 0.9 diarrheal episodes per child, and in special circumstances (daycare centers, institutions), the incidence is as high as 5 episodes per year. Fourteen hospital admissions per 1000 children younger than 12 months, per year, result from acute diarrhea. Among the adult population, most patients developing acute diarrhea are managed as outpatients or will not seek medical attention. However, 0.5 million hospital admissions per year, or 1.5% of all adult hospital admissions annually, are due to diarrhea. In developing countries, inadequate water supply, inef\u00aecient or nonexistent sewage removal systems, chronic malnutrition, and lack of access to oral rehydration are responsible for the high incidence of infectious diarrheal diseases. In the industrialized world, acute diarrhea is still one of the most frequent diagnoses in general practice and children, elderly, and immunocompromised patients are the most vulnerable individuals and account for the majority of these cases.",

Approximately 100 million episodes of acute diarrhea occur in the United States yearly, with an incidence of 1.2 to 1.5 diarrheal episodes per person-year. Medical costs/analyses show that 8.0 million Americans sought physician care for diarrhea yearly and 250,000 required hospitalization. Hospitalization and medical costs approached $560 million, whereas lost productivity totaled $200 million. Approximately another 8 million people sought physician care but were not hospitalized. These patients incurred $690 million in medical costs and $2 billion in loss of work hours. An estimated 90 million cases occurred in people who did not seek physician care, costing nearly $20 billion in lost productivity. Approximately 90% of all these cases were presumably of infectious origin. Thus, the total cost estimate for diarrheal diseases exceeds $23 billion annually in the United States alone.",

Enteric pathogens can induce intestinal injury with consequent diarrhea in three ways: (1) by producing enterotoxins that interact with receptors located on the gut epithelial cells and evoke anion secretion, such as V. cholera, EPEC, EAEC, STEC, C. dif\u00aecile, and S. aureus (A); (2) by invading the gut epithelium and M cells, thus altering the cell cytoskeleton and activating intracellular pathways through virulence factors. Organisms that lead to diarrhea through these mechanisms include EIEC, Shigella, EPEC, Salmonella, and rotaviruses (B); (3) by invading mucosal macrophages and inducing in\u00afammatory responses leading to intestinal epithelial damage and anion secretion.
