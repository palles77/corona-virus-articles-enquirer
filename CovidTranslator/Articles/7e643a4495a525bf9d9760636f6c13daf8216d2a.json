The cell surface of the budding yeast, p~\u00c5\u00c5\u00dc~\u00ea\u00e7\u00e3\u00f3\u00c5\u00c9\u00eb=\u00c5\u00c9\u00ea\u00c9\u00ee\u00e1\u00eb\u00e1~\u00c9, was engineered to anchor the K-COE on the outer layer of the cell, and consequently, the altered yeast was applied as a dietary complement for animal feed, with immunogenic functions. In this study, the K-COE gene (hJ`lb) of the Korean strain of PEDV with the signal peptide of rice amylase 1A (o~\u00e3\u00f3N^), was fused with the gene encoding the carboxyterminal half (320 amino acid residues from the C terminus) of yeast \u03b1-agglutinin, a mating associated protein that is anchored covalently to the cell wall. The glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (dma) promoter was selected in order to direct the expression of the fusion construct, and the resulting recombinant plasmid was then introduced into pK=\u00c5\u00c9\u00ea\u00c9\u00ee\u00e1\u00eb\u00e1~\u00c9. The surface display of K-COE was visualized via confocal microscopy using a polyclonal antibody against K-COE as the primary antibody, and FITC (fluorescein isothiocyanate)-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG as the secondary antibody. The display of the K-COE on the cell surface was further verified via Western blot analysis using the cell wall fraction after the administration of \u03b1-1,3-glucanase/PNGase F/\u03b2-mannosidase treatment. \u00a9 KSBB",

Consequently, PED has been implicated as one of the production limiting factors in pig nurseries [1, 2] . Since the initial identification of PED in Belgium and the United Kingdom in 1978, outbreaks of the disease have been reported in Korea and Europe [2] [3] [4] [5] . Immunity is important for both the prevention and control of PED.

The porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), a causal agent of acute digestive track infections in 1~2 week-old suckling pigs, is a member of coronavirus group I, and is an enveloped, single-stranded RNA virus [7] . In addition, its subgenomic mRNAs, which are transcribed from the viral genome, generate viral protein products, including the spike (S, 180~220 kDa), membrane (M, 27~32 kDa), and nucleocapsid (N, 55~58 kDa) proteins [8] .",

Wide variation in the heterologous gene expression levels of S. cerevisiae is not unusual when using episomal 2-\u03bcm oribased plasmids, possibly owing to variations in the plasmid copy number between different transformants [29] . Thus, the transformant showing the highest expression level, TYE-AGPVAG-4, was selected, and then employed in confirming the surface display of recombinant K-COE.",

Immunofluorescence was observed in the transformant cells, but not in the control cells, which had been grown under identical conditions. The mouse and goat antibodies were not able to access the interior of the yeast cells under the labeling conditions employed; this indicates that the K-COE is expressed in such a manner that it can be detected in the outer layer of an intact cell by using an anti-K-COE antibody that does not cross-react with the yeast epitopes. Thus, we were able to verify that the K-COE was actually anchored to the cell wall. Even after the administration of a heat-kill procedure via 1 h of incubation at 60 o C, the immunofluorescence microscopy revealed that the cells had remained intact, and that the surface display of the K-COE had been unaffected (data not shown). However, we were not able to quantitatively calculate the number of K-COE molecules displayed on the surface of the yeast cells, because the standard amount of immunofluorescence of cells with FITC-antimouse IgG was not available for this study.",

Antigens expressed on the cell surface carry the advantage of easy access to antibodies, and should, therefore, be detectable by the immune system; even very small peptides, as well as vanishingly small quantities of peptides, can be immunogenic when presented on a larger surface [22, 23] . Because Saccharomyces is such an excellent eukaryotic expression system, is cheap to produce, and is safe for oral use, it appears to be a superior candidate for the development of a live oral vaccine against mucosal diseases, in this case Korean PED.
