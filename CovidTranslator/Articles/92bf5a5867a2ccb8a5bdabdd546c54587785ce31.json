Although polymicrobial diseases in animals and humans can be caused by similar organisms, these disease are often also caused by organisms from different kingdoms, genera, species, strains, substrains and even by phenotypic variants of a single species. Animal models are often required to understand the mechanisms of pathogenesis, and to develop therapies and prevention regimes. However, reproducing polymicrobial diseases of humans in animal hosts presents significant challenges.",

The mixed microbial nature of these diseases has been recognized since the early 1920s but there has been renewed interest in this topic since the 1980s 1 , signalled by the publication of four important reviews from 1982 to the present date. Polymicrobial diseases (see BOX 1 for nomenclature) can be caused by the synergistic or sequential action of infectious agents from either the same or different kingdoms, genera, species, strains or substrains, or by different phenotypic variants of a single species 6 . Polymicrobial diseases share underlying mechanisms of pathogenesis, such as common predisposing factors (BOX 2) , but each disease has unique aspects. Although the molecular mechanisms of some polymicrobial infections are known, other polymicrobial diseases are not well understood. Owing to their complexity, the study of polymicrobial infections requires a multidisciplinary approach and specific in vitro methodologies and animal models. The development of assay systems and treatment and prevention regimes is needed.",

The availability of mice with specific genetic backgrounds can have a pivotal role in understanding the mechanisms of pathogenesis of polymicrobial diseases, as exemplified by studies on septic peritonitis 11-17 , periodontal disease 18 and Lyme arthritis 19, 20 .

Co-infection with multiple hepatitis viruses is possible owing to their similar routes of transmission and ability to chronically infect the host. Hepatitis A virus (HAV) co-infection of individuals that are chronically infected with hepatitis B virus (HBV) and/or hepatitis C virus (HCV) results in a disease of increased severity and risk of death. Moreover, HBV-HCV co-infection occurs in 10-15% of HBV patients, and hepatitis G virus (HGV)-HCV co-infection occurs in 10-20% of individuals with chronic HCV infection; however, HBV-hepatitis D virus (HDV) coinfection occurs only in the setting of co-infecting HBV. VIRAL INTERFERENCE, in which replication of one virus is suppressed by another virus, is an intriguing aspect of triple HBV-HCV-HDV infection -HDV can suppress both HBV and HCV replication 29 . In a retrospective study of patients with hepatitis virus co-infections, HDV was dominant by RT-PCR detection of HDV RNA in triple co-infections, but in dual co-infections there were alternating dominant roles for either HBV or HCV. Multiple hepatotropic viral infections are associated with reduced HCV replication but increased pathology. Patients with dual or triple co-infections have more severe liver disease pathologies than patients that are",

Milder, congenital persistent infection follows foetal infection with noncytopathic BVDV.

Upper respiratory viruses predispose the host to bacterial invasion of the lower respiratory tract and are often detected in patients with COPD 84 or cystic fibrosis (CF). In addition to bacterial factors, host determinants also have a role in co-infections of the CF lung. CF patients do not have a higher incidence of viral disease compared with non-CF individuals, but viral disease produces more significant pathology. It has been proposed that CF patients have impaired innate immunity, which allows increased virus replication and upregulated cytokine production. In turn, this results in increased bacterial colonization of the lung. Zheng and co-workers 85 showed that increased virus replication in CF patients is due to the absence of the antiviral nitric oxide synthesis pathway. This was attributed to impaired activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT1), which is an important component of the antiviral defences of the host. Compromising innate immunity provides a mechanism for the severity of viral disease in CF and the establishment of bacterial co-infections.",

However, certain viruses such as respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and rhinovirus seem to predispose affected individuals more often to bacterial OM. The saying that children ''get a cold and a week later develop OM'' is substantiated by epidemiological data that indicate a seasonal influence on the coincidence of 'colds' and OM, as well as evidence for a peak incidence of virus isolation that is coincident with, or immediately preceding, peak incidence of OM (FIG. 2) . In the recent Finnish OM Cohort Study and Finnish OM Vaccine Trial, the relationship between viruses and OM was supported by data that showed the presence of a virus in either nasopharyngeal aspirates or middle-ear fluid specimens in 54% or 67% of OM cases in these studies, respectively 76 . Rhinovirus was the most commonly isolated virus, followed by enterovirus and RSV. A specific virus was detected in two-thirds of all cases of acute OM in young children, but only those viruses that are tested for can be detected, so this figure is likely to underestimate the proportion of acute OM events with viral co-infection.",

RDC migration from the lungs to the secondary lymph nodes after infection with pulmonary virus is monitored by the use of a fluorescent dye. After inoculation with influenza virus, the rate of RDC migration to the draining peribronchial lymph nodes increased, but this only occurred during the first 24 hours after virus infection. After 24 hours, RDCs did not migrate, despite virus replication and pulmonary inflammation. Moreover, viral infection suppressed additional RDC migration in response to either a second pulmonary virus infection or administration of BACTERIAL CPG DNA. In addition to suppressed RDC migration, there was also suppression of an antiviral pulmonary CD8 + T-cell response. It seems likely that the transient suppression of RDC migration and the delayed development of an effective adaptive immune response to a second infection might be another mechanism by which influenza virus predisposes the host to bacterial co-infection.",

P. multocida can adhere to respiratory tissues, but co-infection with B. bronchiseptica allows more efficient colonization by P. multocida. P. multocida produces a dermonecrotic toxin called PMT (for P. multocida toxin), which interferes with normal bone modelling in both the nasal turbinates and long bones in swine, and is distinct from the B. bronchiseptica dermonecrotic toxin (DNT). In porcine models, PMT causes a more serious form of AR known as progressive AR, whereas B. bronchiseptica infection alone induces a milder, or non-progressive, form of the disease.",

Teeth have a non-shedding surface and are located in a warm, moist environment, so are a particularly suitable niche for biofilm formation by the oral microbial flora. In periodontitis, coaggregation -a process in which genetically distinct bacteria become interconnected by specific adhesins -is central to the formation of complex multispecies biofilms 120 (FIG. 3) . In dental plaque, primary colonizers such as Streptococcus gordonii, and other oral streptococci that express adhesins, provide a film on which other bacterial colonizers assemble the biofilm.

In most individuals, periodontal pathogens trigger an inflammatory response that effectively prevents microbial colonization and invasion of adjacent gingival tissues. However, individuals that have specific IL-1 polymorphisms that result in increased levels of IL-1 expression are predisposed to periodontal disease. Using this criterion, a mouse model of polymicrobial-induced osteoclastogenesis, bacterial penetration, leukocyte recruitment and softtissue necrosis has been developed to clarify the role of cytokines in periodontal disease. In this model, the dental pulp of the first mandibular molars is exposed by surgically clipping the mesial cusps and then a mixture of putative oral pathogens is inoculated into the dental pulp (FIG. 4a) . By monitoring the size of osseous lesions, tissue necrosis, osteoclastogenesis, osteoclastic activity, inflammatory cell recruitment and bacterial penetration into tissue periodontal disease, pathogenic mechanisms can be investigated 135 . IL-1 or TNF receptor signalling does not seem to be required for bacteria-induced osteoclastogenesis and bone loss in this model, but does have a crucial role in protecting the host against anaerobic co-infections.",

In this model, the normal flora of the oral cavity of Sprague-Dawley rats is reduced by antibiotic treatment, after which rats are inoculated with A. actinomycetemcomitans by either normal ingestion of food layered with bacterial cultures, oral swabbing or gastric lavage (FIG. 4b) . When clinical isolates of A. actinomycetemcomitans were compared with laboratory-adapted variants, Fine et al. 136 found that the clinical strains were more efficient at colonization and persisted longer in the rat oral cavity than laboratory strains. Rough variants were more efficient colonizers of the rat oral cavity than smooth variants, regardless of the method of inoculation, although feeding was the preferred method owing to the similarity with human disease. Importantly, rats that were orally infected with A. actinomycetemcomitans by feeding developed immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies to the bacteria and had bone loss that was typical of periodontitis. This model has not been used to study the process of bacterial co-infection in periodontitis, but has been used to identify a gene locus that is important in virulence and which mediates tight adherence by A. actinomycetemcomitans 137 .",

Regardless of the co-pathogens, mycotic co-infections of the oral and vaginal cavities, on indwelling prosthetic devices, or systemic infection of the blood can present significant therapeutic challenges.

When cultured on a variety of catheter materials, Candida spp. form biofilms comprising a matrix of microcolonies of both the yeast and the filamentous hyphal forms. In studies of mixed microbial populations, Candida spp. form biofilms with several bacterial species, including Staphylococcus epidermidis and oral streptococcal species. The receptor for Candida albicans co-aggregation with S. gordonii is a complex cell surface polysaccharide that is expressed on the surface of the bacterium. The interaction between yeast cells and oral streptococci or other bacteria has important implications for the mechanisms of yeast infections of the oral cavity, in addition to promoting biofilm formation on a variety of surfaces. In the oral cavity, Candida-bacterial interactions are responsible for denture stomatitis, angular cheilitis and gingivitis, and also have a role in periodontitis 153 .",

Mice that were infected with strains that switched to the filamentous form died, whereas those infected with strains that could not switch from the yeast to the filamentous form survived, despite the fact that the fungal burdens in both groups were nearly identical.

In some studies, co-infection with a helminth seemed to confer protection against severe complications of malaria 164 , but this is not always the case. When infected controls with a low helminth burden were compared with those with circulating helminth schizonts, co-infection with Ascaris lumbricoides was found to be associated with protection from cerebral malaria. In addition, a later study showed a significant association between Ascaris infection and the risk of co-infection with Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax, indicating that pre-existing Ascaris infection might increase host tolerance to coexisting Plasmodium spp. 165 Subsequently, helminthinfected patients were found to be more likely to develop falciparum malaria compared with those that were not co-infected 166 . Moreover, the risk of developing falciparum malaria increased with the number of coinfecting helminth species. Collectively, these findings indicate that a helminth-mediated helper T cell 2 (T H 2) shift (an immune response that is biased towards that which is characteristic of a T H 2-mediated response) might have a complex impact on malaria co-infection -decreasing antisporozoite immunity but inducing a protective outcome against severe complications of malaria. Although the underlying mechanism is less clear, Mwatha et al. 169 showed that exposure of Schistosoma mansoni-infected children to P. falciparum had a significant influence on the severity of hepatosplenomegaly (enlargement of the liver and spleen) that was observed in co-infected children.",

C. albicans cells of two phenotypic phases have different virulence characteristics. The ability of this human pathogen to rapidly switch between phenotypes could be a higher-order pathogenic trait. Support for this hypothesis comes from studies in which strains that cause deep tissue mycoses were shown to switch at higher frequencies than those that cause superficial infections. Furthermore, pathogenic C. albicans strains that were isolated from the oral cavity switch at higher rates than commensal strains that were isolated from the same site. A clinically relevant example of the role of both phenotype and mating-type switching in disease was characterized by Brockert et al. 155 , who investigated oral cavity and vaginal isolates of C. glabrata in three patients with vaginitis. The results of this study showed that switching occurs at sites of infection, that different switch phenotypes of the same strain can dominate in different anatomical locations in the same host and that mating-type switching occurs in vivo.",

Moreover, sputum samples of 6-70% of CF patients contain C. albicans in addition to P. aeruginosa. Hogan and Kolter 157 showed that P. aeruginosa forms a dense biofilm on C. albicans filaments in vitro and, in doing so, kills the fungus. P. aeruginosa fails to bind to, or kill, the yeast form of C. albicans. It is unclear if a similar relationship between these two pathogens functions in vivo but, as several P. aeruginosa virulence factors that are important in human disease are also involved in killing the fungal filaments, this co-culture system could prove useful for the study of the pathogenesis of P. aeruginosa-induced disease.",

Results obtained seem to depend on the Plasmodium species used as well as the immune status of the host. S. mansoni is, however, a potent inducer of a T H 2 dominant response, not only to itself but also to other BYSTANDER ANTIGENS that are present in a host, so it does have an influence on the clinical outcome in these co-infections 175, 176 . Synergistic interactions between specific protozoans and helminths are often ascribed to the immunosuppression that is characteristic of protozoan infections 177 and which is observed in the mouse, which is the main model for these infections A mouse model has been used to model the arthritis and carditis that can occur in co-infections with B. microti and B. burgdorferi 19 . Co-infection resulted in a significant increase in symptoms of arthritis. This increase was correlated with a reduction in concentrations of the cytokines IL-10 and IL-13. A mouse model for tick-borne Lyme arthritis mediated by co-infection with B. burgdorferi and a causative agent of human granulocytic ehrlichiosis (HGE) has been developed 178, 179 (FIG. 6) . Co-infection results in increased titres of both pathogens and more severe arthritis than does infection with B. burgdorferi alone. Co-infection resulted in reduced concentrations of IL-12, IFN-\u03b3 and TNF-\u03b1 and increased concentrations of IL-6. IFN-\u03b3 expression in macrophages was suppressed, which might indicate a reduction in phagocytic activity in co-infection.

In HCV and S. mansoni co-infection, there is a higher incidence of viral persistence and accelerated damage to the liver than when the patient is infected with either infectious agent alone. In a recent study, stimulation of CD4 + T cells with HCV antigens produced a type 1 cytokine profile in patients infected with HCV, whereas in patients that were co-infected with HCV and S. mansoni, a type 2 cytokine predominance was evident despite the fact that T cells that were recovered from both patient populations responded in the same manner to stimulation with schistosomal antigens 168 . The helminth-induced inability to generate an HCV-specific CD4 + /T H 1 T-cell response has been shown to have a role in the persistence and severity of HCV infection, which indicates that the induction of a strong cellular immune response through new therapeutic approaches might limit subsequent liver damage in those individuals with chronic HCV infection 169 .",

One example of coinfection with a parasite and bacterium in humans is that of Borrelia burgdorferi (the causative agent of Lyme disease) and the intra-erythrocytic parasite Babesia microti. Both of these pathogens are transmitted by the tick vector Ixodes scapularis. Co-infection can occur by a bite from a single tick carrying multiple pathogens, or from multiple tick bites. The first cases of Lyme borreliosis and babesiosis co-infection were reported in the mid 1980s, with parasite-bacteria co-infection rates of up to 33% among those with confirmed tick-borne infection in certain populations. Although ticks can also harbour the human pathogen Anaplasma phagocytophilum, Lyme borreliosis and babesiosis coinfection accounts for ~80% of polymicrobial disease in the eastern United States. Consistent with the theme for other co-infections involving a parasite, patients that harbour both of these pathogens had more severe and longer-lasting symptoms than those with Lyme borreliosis alone 170 (NUG) and is characterized by a surface biofilm of mixed microbial flora overlying a subsurface flora comprising dense aggregates of spirochaetes. In contrast to NUG, high levels of yeast and herpes-like viruses were observed using transmission electron microscopy examination of tissues recovered from the former patient group. Herpes-like particles were observed in 56.5% of biopsies obtained from HIV-infected patients with NUP. These findings correlate well with those of Contreras and co-workers 183, 184 in which co-infection with herpesvirus was associated with high levels of periodontopathic bacteria. The role of viruses in the pathogenesis of NUP or periodontitis is not known but, in addition to inducing immunosuppression, it has been suggested that viruses might promote the overgrowth of bacterial pathogens and/or induce the release of tissuedestroying cytokines by host cells 185 . 32, 180 .",

This will necessitate the development of new animal models and new in vitro methods for the study of polymicrobial diseases. Uncovering the molecular mechanisms that are involved in the pathogenesis of complex diseases might show that changes in lifestyle, such as smoking cessation or dietary changes, could prevent co-infections. Developing methods to disrupt biofilms are one target for researchers. New antimicrobials and vaccine candidates for both the predisposing and the co-infecting microorganisms will be sought. Therapeutic approaches for polymicrobial diseases might include the use of probiotics for the treatment or prevention of vaginal infections, gastroenteritis, inflammatory bowel disease, UTIs and periodontitis. Moreover, advances in nanotechnology and biomedical engineering will allow the development of new ways to deliver these therapeutic or preventative agents in a disease-or site-specific manner such as the design and use of 'intelligent implants' 193 . These indwelling devices might be embedded with sensors to detect the biofilm-forming microorganisms and signal the release of antimicrobial agents stored in an internal reservoir.

After 2 days, one set of animals inoculated with S. pneumoniae was inoculated intranasally with influenza A virus. All animals were assessed for 22 days by nasopharyngeal lavage every 2-3 days to detect cultures of S. pneumoniae or influenza A virus, by otoscopy to detect symptoms of otitis media, by aspirates from middle-ear effusions to culture S. pneumoniae and influenza A virus and by cardiac puncture to culture S. pneumoniae. The graphs in panels b and c show the incidence of ears with otitis media (OM) that were observed following each infection regime.

Seven days later, the same animals were inoculated intranasally with 10 8 cfu of one of three clinical isolates of nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHI, strains #86-028NP, #1885MEE or #1728MEE). e | All animals were assessed for 35 days by otoscopy and tympanometry (every 2 days after adenovirus inoculation) for OM and by nasopharyngeal lavage on days 1,4,7,10,14,18,21,28 and 35 to assess NTHI by culturing.

Measles virus is not usually lethal, but measles virus-induced immunosuppression results in increased susceptibility to infection with S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, S. aureus, P. aeruginosa, S. pyogenes and C. trachomatis and to infection with other viruses such as adenovirus and HSV. These coinfections are responsible for the morbidity and mortality that are associated with measles virus infection. Measles virus infection of B cells results in secretion of a soluble factor that inhibits proliferation of cells of the lymphoid lineage. B cells that are infected with measles HIV co-infections. Owing to a reduction in the number and/or activity of CD4 + T cells, natural killer (NK) cells, dendritic cells and macrophages, HIV-infected individuals have multiple defects in immune responses. These defects lead to increased susceptibility to so-called opportunistic infections that, in turn, augment the developmental course of AIDS.
