We discuss the unique methodologic and logistical challenges faced by researchers who attempt to conduct controlled trials of therapeutic agents during an outbreak of a novel or unknown infectious pathogen.

An evidence-based approach to managing SARS is still lacking, however, as no controlled clinical data are available to justify any of the treatments used. If SARS reemerges, clinicians will have little evidence on which to base treatment decisions. Could clinical trials have been conducted during the global outbreak? If so, what steps need to be taken to ensure that such trials are implemented appropriately the next time a similar event occurs?",

We believed that conducting such a trial was important, given the widespread use of ribavirin and its potential risks and benefits. Subsequently, reports of adverse events associated with its use, demonstrated lack of in vitro activity, and reports of clinical progression on therapy convinced Canadian clinicians to discontinue its use without further study (8, 9, 12) . At this point, we do not feel that a randomized trial of ribavirin therapy is warranted.

Although there may be a temptation to launch a trial rapidly after the onset of an outbreak, in most cases the etiologic agent should be identified with reasonable certainty before conducting trials of specific agents. Agents selected for study should have plausible mechanisms of action, activity established by in vitro studies, known toxicity profiles, and preliminary clinical evidence supporting their efficacy. Evidence should not consist solely of anecdotal case reports but should include some data derived from comparisons of treated and untreated patients. If other means of rejecting the hypothesis exist (i.e., in vitro studies, animal studies), but have not yet been conducted, a trial of the agent should be deferred and its resources allocated to trials testing agents that cannot be evaluated by other means. For example, the hypothesis that steroids can improve outcome in SARS by preventing or abrogating immune-mediated lung injury will be difficult to disprove by any means short of a randomized controlled trial.",

This approach was adopted in the United States, and no fatal cases were reported, although only eight U.S. cases have been serologically confirmed (4) . In parts of the world where outbreaks were larger, considerable pressure was placed on clinicians to offer specific therapies directed against SARS-CoV, even if such therapies were unproven and potentially dangerous. When unproven and potentially harmful therapeutic agents are being used in clinical practice, a simple, rapidly conducted randomized trial may be beneficial. Protocols will need to allow for the evolution of clinical practice during the outbreak.

For example, a protocol for a trial of corticosteroids in SARS could be designed and approved now and implemented if another outbreak occurs. Additionally, a \"rolling\" type of ethics approval could be developed, whereby portions of a trial could be approved while other elements are modified in real time as the trial is launched, with ongoing supervision and periodic reapproval by the ethics board.

Evidence that healthcare workers working part-time at several Toronto area hospitals transmitted SARS from one institution to another led to the public health requirement that healthcare workers be limited to a single institution. In particular, healthcare workers at hospitals in which transmission had occurred were not permitted to enter other hospitals. Such policies were important in limiting the spread of the outbreak but provide additional challenges to trial implementation.",

The study should be coordinated centrally and communication between study sites should be by teleconference and email, until risks are defined and minimized. Travel between centers would be limited by providing data collection forms designed to be directly scanned and transmitted via the Internet.
