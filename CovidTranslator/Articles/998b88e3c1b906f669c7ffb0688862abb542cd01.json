Although coexistence of nsp3 and nsp4 is known to cause membrane rearrangement, the mechanisms underlying the interaction of these two proteins remain unclear. We demonstrated that binding of nsp4 with nsp3 is essential for membrane rearrangement and identified amino acid residues in nsp4 responsible for the interaction with nsp3. In addition, we revealed that the nsp3-nsp4 interaction is not sufficient to induce membrane rearrangement, suggesting the participation of other factors such as host proteins. Finally, we showed that loss of the nsp3-nsp4 interaction eliminated viral replication by using an infectious cDNA clone and replicon system of SARS-CoV. These findings provide clues to the mechanism of the replication/transcription complex assembly of SARS-CoV and could reveal an antiviral target for the treatment of betacoronavirus infection.",

The genomic size of SARS-CoV is extremely large among RNA viruses and the 5' two-thirds of the genomic RNA has two partially overlapping ORFs, 1a and 1b.

The membrane remodeling and consequent RTC formation induced by virus infection are critical for creating a site to support viral RNA synthesis and for protecting newly synthesized RNA from host innate immune systems (den Boon and Ahlquist, 2010) . Like infection with other positive-stranded RNA viruses, infection with coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV and murine hepatitis virus (MHV), also induces replication-associated membrane structures, which in the case of betacoronavirus infection consist of two interconnected membrane structures, double-membrane vesicles (DMVs) and convoluted membranes (CMs) (Goldsmith et al., 2004; Gosert et al., 2002; Knoops et al., 2008; Snijder et al., 2006) . Furthermore, infection with avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) induces a spherular structure derived from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), which has not been identified in cells infected with other coronavirus species (Maier et al., 2013) . Electron microscopy analysis of cells infected with coronavirus reveals that DMVs and CMs localize to the proximity of the ER and partially interconnect with the ER, suggesting that the DMVs and CMs are derived from host ER membranes, despite the lack of canonical ER membrane markers (Gosert et al., 2002; Hagemeijer et al., 2014; Knoops et al., 2008; Snijder et al., 2006; Ulasli et al., 2010) .",

Although expression of nsp3, nsp4, and nsp6 is observed in RTC upon infection, it is localized in the ER in cells individually expressed by the transfection with expression plasmids (Kanjanahaluethai et al., 2007; Oostra et al., 2008 Oostra et al., , 2007 . In the case of MHV, interaction of nsp4 and the C-terminal one-third of nsp3 (nsp3C) was observed by immunoprecipitation analysis (Hagemeijer et al., 2011) , and these proteins were colocalized in the perinuclear foci in cells upon co-transfection with expression plasmids, similar to those observed in infected cells (Hagemeijer et al., 2014 (Hagemeijer et al., , 2011 . These data suggest that coexpression of nsp3 and nsp4 results in a membrane rearrangement to induce DMVs and CMs (Hagemeijer et al., 2014) . MHV nsp4 is a glycosylated protein, and the glycosylated nsp4 is important for the virus-induced membrane rearrangement and the replication complex function and assembly of DMVs (Clementz et al., 2008; Gadlage et al., 2010) . Analyses using confocal and electron microscopy have shown that the expression of nsp3, nsp4, and nsp6 of SARS-CoV induces formation of DMVs in the transfected cells (Angelini et al., 2013) . However, limited information is available about the mechanism of interaction between nsp3 and nsp4 of SARS-CoV or the roles of such interaction on viral replication through the formation of membrane rearrangements.",

To confirm this redistribution of the proteins, we constructed the expression plasmids pCAG nsp4-HA and pCAG nsp3C-3xFLAG carrying an HA-tag and 3xFLAG tag in the C-termini of each protein, respectively (Fig. 1A) . Subcellular localization of nsp4 and nsp3C in 293T cells transfected with pCAG nsp4-HA and/or pCAG nsp3C-3xFLAG was determined by immunofluorescence assay (IFA) using anti-HA and anti-FLAG antibodies. Although nsp3C and nsp4 were localized in the ER when expressed individually, both nsp3C and nsp4 were detected in discrete foci in the perinuclear region in cells upon co-expression ( Fig. 2A , B top panel), confirming that coexpression of nsp4 with nsp3C of SARS-CoV induces redistribution of the proteins from the ER to concentrated foci in the perinuclear region.",

The wild type nsp4, nsp4 \u0394164-197 and nsp4 \u0394220-234 but not nsp4 \u0394112-164 were co-immunoprecipitated with nsp3C ( Fig. 3A) , suggesting that the amino acid residues spanning from 112 to 164 in nsp4 are responsible for binding to nsp3C. To further confirm the binding of nsp4 to nsp3C in situ, a proximity ligation assay (PLA) based on antibodies tagged with a circular DNA probe was performed by using a Duolink\u00ae in situ PLA kit (Invitrogen). Once the antibodies are in close proximity, the probes can be ligated together and then amplified with a polymerase. The PLA signals were detected in the cytoplasm of cells co-expressing nsp3C with either wild type nsp4, nsp4 \u0394164-197 or nsp4 \u0394220-234 but not with nsp4 \u0394112-164 at 30 h posttransfection (Fig. 3B ), supporting the notion that the amino acid residues from 112 to 164 of SARS-CoV nsp4 are responsible for the interaction with nsp3C. Interestingly, the nsp4 \u0394220-234 failed to induce re-localization upon co-expression with nsp3C ( Fig. 2B bottom panel), but interaction with nsp3C was detected by using immunoprecipitation and PLA assays ( Fig. 3A and B), indicating that the interaction between nsp4 and nsp3C was not sufficient to induce the re-location concentrated foci. These results suggest that another host or viral factor(s) is involved in the re-location concentrated foci induced by interaction between nsp4 and nsp3.",

Immunoprecipitation analysis showed that the amino acid residues from 112 to 126 in nsp4 are important for binding to nsp3C (Fig. 4A) . Moreover, the alignment of amino acid sequences corresponding to the amino acids from 112 to 126 in nsp4 of SARS-CoV revealed that two amino acid residues, H120 and F121, were conserved among betacoronaviruses that included bovine coronavirus (BCoV), MHV, and MERS-CoV (Fig. 4B ). Next, to determine the role of H120 and F121 in nsp4 on the interaction with nsp3C, the expression plasmid pCAG nsp4 H120N/F121L-HA, in which H120 and F121 were replaced with N and L, respectively, was co-transfected with pCAG nsp3C-3xFLAG into 293T cells. Immunoprecipitation analysis showed that nsp4 H120N/F121L abrogated binding to nsp3C (Fig. 4A ) and IFA showed that nsp4 H120N/ F121L lost the ability to re-localize concentrated foci upon co-expression with nsp3C ( Fig. 4C ). Western blot analysis showed that the amounts of nsp4 H120N/F121L in cells co-transfected with nsp3C were comparable to those of nsp4-wt in co-transfected with nsp3C ( Fig. 4D) .",

Briefly, cDNA of SARS-CoV was assembled in the BAC under the control of the cytomegalovirus immediate-early promoter and flanked at the 3'end by 25-bp of poly(A) followed by an HDV ribozyme and a BGH termination sequence (Almaz\u00e1n et al., 2006) , and designated pBAC-SARS-wt.

To determine the effect of H120N/F121L mutation in nsp4 on the infectious particle formation and viral RNA replication of SARS-CoV, infectious titers in the culture supernatants and intracellular viral RNA in Huh7 cells transfected with either pBAC-SARS-wt or pBAC-SARS-H120N/F121L were determined at 72 h posttransfection (Fig. 6B) . Although the infectious titers in the supernatants reached 5.62E+04 TCID50/ml and the amounts of viral RNA determined by real-time PCR were increased in a time-dependent manner in cells transfected with pBAC-SARS-wt, no infectious titer in the supernatants and no replication of intracellular viral RNA was detected in those transfected with pBAC-SARS-H120N/F121L ( Fig. 6C and D).

We introduced H120N/F121L mutations in nsp4 of the parental replicon, pBAC-SARS-Rep-wt, to generate pBAC-SARS-Rep-H120N/F121L (Fig. 7A) . As a negative control, we generated pBAC-SARS-Rep-SAD carrying a mutation in nsp12 deficient in RNAdependent RNA polymerase activity by the replacement of D760 to A760 (Subissi et al., 2014) (Fig. 7A) . Northern blot analysis of 293T cells at 24 h and 36 h posttransfection with pBAC-SARS-Rep-wt, pBAC-SARS-Rep-SAD or pBAC-SARS-Rep-H120N/F121L using an N gene-specific probe revealed that no mRNA was detected in cells transfected with either pBAC-SARS-Rep-H120N/F121L or pBAC-SARS-Rep-SAD, in contrast to those transfected with pBAC-SARS-Rep-wt (Fig. 7B) . To further confirm the impairment of replication of the replicon carrying mutations in H120 and F121, the levels of renilla luciferase in 293T cells transfected with pBAC-SARS-Rep-wt, pBAC-SARS-Rep-SAD or pBAC-SARS-Rep-H120N/F121L were determined at 24 h and 36 h posttransfection.

Upon SARS-CoV infection, viral RNA is translated into 16 mature viral proteins, nsp1 to nsp16, by processing with two viral proteinases (Prentice et al., 2004) , and some of them localize to DMVs and CMs (Knoops et al., 2008) . In SARS-CoV, nsp3, nsp4 and nsp6 contain multiple hydrophobic and membrane-spanning domains (Hagemeijer et al., 2014) , and co-expression of nsp3, nsp4 and nsp6 was shown to result in the formation of DMVs and CMs (Angelini et al., 2013) . In addition, Hagemeijer et al. showed that co-expression of nsp4 with the Cterminal one-third of nsp3 re-translocates both proteins into concentrated foci that predominantly localize in the perinuclear region (Hagemeijer et al., 2011) . Further, the large lumenal loop between the first and second transmembrane domains of MHV nsp4 was shown to be essential for the induction of membrane rearrangement (Hagemeijer et al., 2014) . Although many studies have investigated the role of the co-expression of nsp3 and nsp4 in inducing host membrane rearrangement the molecular mechanisms underlying the interaction of nsp3 with nsp4 and the role of this interaction in viral replication are largely unknown. In the present study, we identified the crucial amino acid residues in nsp4 responsible for the interaction with nsp3 and demonstrated that the membrane rearrangement induced by the interaction of nsp3 with nsp4 is crucial for formation of viral replication complexes. We also showed by means of immunoprecipitation and PLA assays that the amino acids residues from positions 112-164 and from 220 to 234 of nsp4 are critical for the induction of membrane rearrangement upon co-expression with nsp3, and the amino acids residues from positions 112-164 of nsp4 form the binding site with nsp3.",

Although the second lumenal loop of nsp4 does not participate in the membrane rearrangement (Hagemeijer et al., 2014) , the role of the lumenal loops in the viral replication is still unclear. The roles of the glycosylation in the first lumenal loop of nsp4 on the membrane rearrangement have been well studied. MHV has two glycosylation sites (N176 and N237) and SARS-CoV has one glycosylation site (N131) (Clementz et al., 2008; Gadlage et al., 2010; Oostra et al., 2008) . Interestingly, morphologically aberrant DMVs were observed in cells upon infection with a mutant MHV possessing nsp4 with no glycosylation site and RNA replication was impaired (Beachboard et al., 2015; Gadlage et al., 2010) . Although we did not examine the effect of mutation of N131 in nsp4 on the membrane rearrangement and viral propagation in this study, the H120N/F121L mutations in nsp4, which are distant from the N131 glycosylation site, induced a complete loss of membrane rearrangement and impairment of viral RNA replication, suggesting that the specific interaction of nsp4 with nsp3 plays roles in viral replication.",

The vesicle coat proteins known as COPII proteins transport proteins from the rough ER to the Golgi apparatus, and are involved in the production of vesicles in cells infected with poliovirus (PV) (Rust et al., 2001) . ADP-ribosylation factors, which play a role in the regulation of membrane dynamics and protein transport, are localized to the PV-induced membranes in cells infected with PV (Belov et al., 2007) . Vesicle-associated-membrane protein-associated proteins (VAPs) remodel the ER by interacting with NIR2 to mediate formation of HCV-induced membranes (Moriishi and Matsuura, 2007) . Although the precise interaction of the coronavirus RTC with host proteins is largely unknown, ERAD tuning pathway is suggested to be involved in the RTC formation of MHV (Hagemeijer et al., 2014; Reggiori et al., 2010) , since RTC proteins coexist with the ERAD regulator proteins EDEM1 and OS9, and the ERAD machinery mediated by ERAD regulator proteins participates in the formation of LC3-I-positive RTC (Noack et al., 2014; Reggiori et al., 2010) . In this study, we found that the nsp4 mutant lacking the amino acid residues from positions 220-234 is capable of binding to nsp3C but lacks induction of re-localization ( Fig. 3 and 4) and membrane rearrangement (Fig. 5) , suggesting that other host or viral factor(s), such as EDEM1 and OS9, participate in the membrane rearrangement induced by the interaction between nsp4 and nsp3.",
