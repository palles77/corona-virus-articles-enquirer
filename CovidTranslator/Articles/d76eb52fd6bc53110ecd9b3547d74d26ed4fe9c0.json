            "text": "The coronaviruses encompass a group of enveloped RNA viruses that are widespread in nature and infect a wide variety of animals as well as humans, most commonly causing gastrointestinal or respiratory illnesses in the infected host, although more systemic infections can also occur. Before the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2002 (SARS) in -2003 , the majority of coronaviruses that had been isolated were recovered from humans and domesticated animal species, including laboratory rodents, and were regarded primarily as veterinary pathogens. The rodent coronaviruses, such as the various strains of MHV, provided rodent models for various human diseases. The demonstration that the agent that caused SARS was a novel coronavirus, and the subsequent investigations of the outbreak that indicated that the SARS-coronavirus (SARS-CoV) almost certainly entered the human population through zoonotic spread in wild animal markets in China, and subsequently underwent adaptation to humans, greatly increased the interest in this group and spurred efforts to identify and isolate coronaviruses from a large number of species in an attempt to identify the source of the SARS-CoV. These investigations, and the advent of sensitive RT-PCR based methods (Stephensen, Casebolt, and Gangopadhyay, 1999) to detect novel as well as known coronaviruses, identified a large number of new coronaviruses in a relatively short period of time. Particularly interesting are the recent findings that bats, a large and diverse group of mammals that account for approximately 20% of extant mammalian species, represent a large and previously unrecognized source of novel coronaviruses, including viruses closely related to the SARS-CoV (Dominguez et al., 2007; Lau et al., 2005; Vijaykrishna et al., 2007) .

It can be miniaturized and run in Terasaki plates that contain as little as 10 \u03bcl of media per well, but is more commonly performed in 96-well plates (Robb and Bond, 1979) . Serial dilutions of a virus stock are prepared and inoculated onto replicate cell cultures, often in multi-well formats (e.g. 96-well plastic plates). After an appropriate incubation period, wells are scored as either infected or non-infected after microscopic observation for cytopathogenic effect and a tissue culture infectious dose 50 (TCID 50 ) is calculated. In this assay the distribution of virus into the wells follows a Poisson distribution, since some wells have a probability of receiving more than one infectious virus particle. The relationship between PFU and TCID 50 is as follows: TCID 50 \u00d7 0.7 gives you the equivalent titer in PFU/ml. An advantage of end point dilution assays is that it can be easily adapted to viruses that do not produce clear cytopathogenic effects by utilizing immunofluorescent staining for viral antigens, or by using other indicators of viral infection such as hemadsorption. The procedure presented below utilizes L2 cells. If desired, DBT or 17Cl-1 cells can be substituted for L2 cells.",

In addition, targeted recombination studies with MHV utilize feline cells (see Basic Protocol 5 ",

Stocks are always grown at low multiplicity of infection, both to conserve seed stocks and to avoid the generation of defective interfering particles that can result in lower titers of the stock. For a robust virus such as MHV-A59, after plaque purification, we generally grow a small amount of P1 (first passage) seed stock and a P2 (second passage) working stock in larger amounts.

The pelleted virus must be resuspended in a small volume of MSE buffer for further purification. This is most easily accomplished in a cup sonicator.

To remove the virus from the ultracentrifuge tube, carefully remove about 3 ml of liquid from the top of the sucrose gradient without disturbing the purified virus band. You must remove a sufficient volume of liquid to allow a number 00 rubber stopper to be placed into the tube without disturbing the gradient. Use a rubber stopper that has been pierced through the center with a 22 gauge needle to stopper the tube (Figure 2b) , and clamp to a ring stand as shown in Figure 2b . Carefully and slowly pierce the tube just below the visible virus band by rotating a 22 gauge needle attached to a syringe while applying steady pressure. Once the tube is penetrated move the tip needle to just below the virus band and slowly aspirate the virus. You typically will collect approximately 1 ml of virus. Prior to withdrawing your needle from the tube place a finger over the hub of the needle in the rubber stopper to keep the remaining sucrose from pouring out through the hole in the side of the tube. Withdraw the needle and syringe and transfer the virus to a sterile polypropylene tube and place on ice. Place the pierced ultracentrifuge tube in a beaker to allow the liquid in the tube to drain. Sterilize liquid in beaker with disinfectant prior to discarding. Discard ultracentrifuge tube as biohazard waste and autoclave the rubber stopper pierced with a needle prior to storage for subsequent use.

If using the SW28 rotor a small pellet of virus is often visible. Put the ultracentrifuge tubes on ice. The pelleted virus must be resuspended in a small volume of MSE buffer for further purification. This is most easily accomplished in a cup sonicator. Pipet 0.5 ml MSE into the first ultracentrifuge tube and seal with Parafilm. Fill the cup of the cup sonicator with chipped ice plus sufficient water to make slush. Sonicate for three bursts of 20 seconds each at 100 watts peak envelope power, pausing for 1 minute between each burst. Replenish ice as needed. Transfer the resuspended virus to the next ultracentrifuge tube and sonicate as described above to resuspend the pelleted virus in the second tube. Virus from up to three tubes can be resuspended in 0.5 ml of MSE buffer by this method. Use a fresh 0.5 ml MSE buffer to resuspend virus from the remaining three ultracentrifuge tubes if necessary. If a cup sonicator is not available you can resuspend the virus pellets by adding 0.5 ml of MSE buffer to the virus pellet and letting the pellet soften for 5-10 minutes on ice. Break up the pellet by pipetting the MSE buffer up and down in a 1000 \u03bcl micropipette, if necessary using the pipette tip to break up the pellet at the bottom of the tube. Once the pellet is broken up, transfer the virus suspension to a second tube of pelleted virus, and repeat the process.

In the past decade, coronavirus reverse genetics was performed using defective interference (DI) genomes, extensively deleted genomic remnants that replicate by using the RNA synthesis machinery of a helper virus. Using the DI system, a number of cis-acting elements important for viral transcription and replication have been defined. However, by the nature of competition assay in DI system, phenotype changes observed in the DI system do not strictly reflect the behavior of the virus when the mutations were introduced into the whole virus genome (Johnson et al., 2005) (Dong et al, manuscript in preparation). Recently, reverse genetic systems for a number of coronaviruses have been established using non-traditional approaches which are based on bacterial artificial chromosomes (Almazan et al., 2000) , the use of vaccinia virus as a vector for the propagation of coronavirus genomic cDNAs (Thiel and Siddell, 2005) , or the in vitro ligation of coronavirus cDNA fragments (Donaldson et al., 2008; Yount, Curtis, and Baric, 2000; Yount et al., 2003; Yount et al., 2002) . These reverse genetic systems enable us to genetically modify coronavirus genome at any position and provide a powerful tool to investigate viral transcription, replication, and virus-host interactions in the whole genome system. Here, we introduce in vitro cDNA assembly protocol developed by Yount et al (Yount et al., 2003; Yount et al., 2002) .",

The chimeric virus is used for recombination with a synthetic donor RNA (transcribed from a plasmid, pMH54, that is available from Paul Masters, Wadsworth Laboratories, New York) that contains a portion of the MHV-A59 HE gene, the original spike (S) gene, and extends to the 3\u2032 end of the genome (see Figure 4 ). The recombinant viruses are selected by their regained ability to infect murine cells. Mutations inserted into the donor RNA will be transferred to the recombinant virus and generate new mutant viruses (Fu et al., 2004; Kuo et al., 2000; Ontiveros et al., 2001) .

Homologous recombination events between the donor RNA and the viral genomic RNA that occur upstream of the S gene produce mutant viruses that can grow in murine cells such as DBT cells and can thus be selected.",

The negative-stained EM appearance of these viruses is that of round enveloped particles, approximately 100-160 nm in diameter, that bear bulbous spike proteins on the lipid envelope that give the virus particle an appearance somewhat reminiscent of a crown, thus giving this group of virus its name. Further EM studies of infected cells revealed that coronaviruses bud through intracellular membranes in the ERGIC-Golgi and are subsequently released from the infected cell by exocytosis. Coronavirus particles contain 4 or 5 proteins: a nucleocapsid protein (N), a triple membrane-spanning protein, M, a small membrane protein with ion channel activity, E (Wilson et al., 2004) , a spike protein (S) that makes up the characteristic bulbous peplomer and functions to bind to host cell receptors and mediate virus entry to the cytoplasm. In addition most but not all members of the Group IIa coronaviruses contain a hemaggulitin-esterase (HE) protein, which makes up a second, somewhat shorter, spike protein on these viruses. The virus particles contain a helical nucleocapsid made up of the N protein and a large single-stranded, positive sense, nonsegmented RNA genome, between 27 and 32 kp in length.",

Most of the coronaviruses are relatively species specific, only infecting their natural host and cell cultures derived from that host or a closely related host species. However there are several examples of coronaviruses jumping species, with SARS-CoV being the most well known example. SARS-CoV is thought to have originated in bats, where SARS-like CoVs have been identified, transmitted to civets and raccon dogs in wild animal markets in Southern China, and then subsequently transmitted to humans (Lau et al., 2010) . During this chain of transmission several key adaptations to the new host occurred . CCoV and FeCoV provide another exception to the high degree of species specificity of coronaviruses, in that both viruses are able to grow in feline cells. Phylogenetic analysis of the group Ia coronaviruses, CCoV, FeCoV, and TGEV, suggest a complex set of recombination events has given rise to these viruses from a common ancestor, likely explaining the ability of both CCoV and FeCoV to infect feline cells (Lorusso et al., 2008; Wesseling et al., 1994) . The species specificity of coronaviruses is controlled by the ectodomain of the S protein, and can be altered by creating chimeric S proteins that contain the ectodomain of a distantly related CoV (Kuo et al., 2000) .",

Two approaches, targeted recombination (Kuo et al., 2000) and in vitro cDNA assembly (Youn, Leibowitz, and Collisson, 2005; Yount et al., 2002) , which have been employed to perform reverse genetics in coronaviruses are described here. Other reverse genetic systems have been developed for various coronaviruses. These employ recombinant vaccinia viruses, essentially as cloning vectors carrying a coronavirus genome (Casais et al., 2001; Thiel et al., 2001) , or use a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) as a cloning vector (Almazan et al., 2000) . Each of these systems has advantages and disadvantages. The in vitro cDNA assembly system has the advantage of ease of manipulation in terms of introducing mutations since the genome has been cloned in seven separate cDNA fragments. The corresponding disadvantage is that the plasmids carrying these cDNAs must be maintained and ligated and subsequently transcribed in vitro to regenerate infectious virus. Vaccinia virus based systems are easy to maintain but it is slightly more cumbersome to generate mutant recombinant viruses and exposes personnel to the added risk of working with vaccinia virus. The BAC based system established for TGEV contains a single cDNA representing the entire TGEV genome, and has the advantage that the genome is under the control of a CMV promoter allowing virus to be regenerated by simple transfection into permissive cells rather than relying on in vitro transcription and electroporation of the resulting RNA into permissive cells. This is balanced by the awkwardness of introducing mutations into the 31 kbp CoV insert in the BAC. All of these systems have been successfully utilized by various labs.",

            "text": "Infectivity Assays-Both the plaque assay and the end point dilution assays are quite reliable, with the largest variable being the physiologic state of the cells used for the assays. We generally do not use cells that have been carried in cell culture more than 20 passages after defrosting to try to minimize variability. For plaque assays it is important to seed cells at a consistent concentration and to allow them to reach confluence. Once cells have reached confluence they should be used that day. Holding them an additional day will depress the titer and result in smaller plaques. A second critical parameter for the plaque assay is avoiding drying out the monolayer, either during washing the monolayers or viral adsorption, steps 3 and 4 respectively in Basic Protocol 1. For this reason we generally only will wash the monolayers in groups of four 6-well plates, and similarly start the viral adsorption four plates at a time. We also do not aspirate all of the media at these two steps, leaving approximately 0.2 ml behind to avoid drying out the plates. It is better to leave too much media behind than too little. If the plates are dried out there will be crescent of dead cells in the plates upon staining. Another critical step is when adding the agarose overlay medium to the plates (Basic Protocol 1, Step 6) to be sure to mix the virus inocula with the overlay medium before the overlay hardens. Failure to do so will result in residual liquid between the overlay medium and the agarose and will result in comet shaped plaques that are hard to count. The critical parameter for the end point dilution assay is the density of the cells at the time of infection. We have found seeding the cells at 50,000 cells per well the evening prior to the assay has worked well in our hands. It is also possible to seed the cells first thing in the morning and perform the assay 6-8 hours after seeding, although this is rarely as convenient. The cell monolayer should be 75% confluent to just barely confluent at the time the assay is performed. Cell monolayers that are crowded will be hard to read since some of the cells may come off the substrate by the end of the assay.",

One strain of MHV, MHV-A59, grows to very high titer (10 8-10 9 plaque forming units/ml), most other strains commonly used (MHV-3, MHV-2, MHV-1, and MHV-JHM) achieve titers between 10 6-10 8 PFU/ml), and some strains, such as MHV-Yale, grow to still lower titers (10 5-10 6 PFU/ml). Especially for viruses that grow relatively poorly, it is important that the cell monolayers are not confluent when they are infected. We generally infect culture flasks that are 50%-75% confluent, depending upon the strain of MHV we are growing. In Basic Protocol 2, we give a range of multiplicities of infection for growing stock virus, from 0.1-.0001. The multiplicity of infection, the confluence of the monolayer, and the speed at which virus infection spreads through the cell monolayer are related variables. Generally, viruses that reach high titer replicate more quickly and thus the infection spreads through the monolayer more rapidly. Thus a lower multiplicity of infection can be used for these viruses. For viruses that spread somewhat more slowly, it is best to use multiplicities of infection toward the higher portion of this range. The density of the cells used to grow the stock should be adjusted for the estimated amount of time it will take for 90% or more of the cells to develop cytopathogenic effect, with cells infected at relatively low densities (~50% confluence) if the infection is expected to take 3 days; cell monolayers that are ~75% confluent are generally used for infections that are expected to take 48 hours or less. It often takes some experience with an individual virus to determine the optimal conditions for growing a virus stock, since these differ somewhat from strain to strain.",

It is often advisable therefore to titer the virus to be purified to be certain it has grown reasonably well. For MHV-A59, a virus that grows to high titer, we generally start the purification with a minimum of 108 ml of clarified infected tissue culture supernate. For viruses that do not grow as vigorously, we generally start with a minimum of 216 ml of clarified infected tissue culture supernate, and preferably with 432 ml or more. For volumes larger than 216 ml it is necessary to pellet the virus through a pad (Basic Protocol 3, steps 1-3), and after pouring off the supernatant liquid, including the pad, a second 216 ml can pelleted through a fresh pad in the same tube. The pellet from both centrifugations can then be resuspended in buffer and virus purified by density gradient centrifugation. It is important to be careful when preparing density gradients and overlaying the sample onto the gradients. It is important to disturb the gradient as little as possible in moving centrifuge tubes into and out of the centrifuge buckets.",

            "text": "Generation Of Recombinant MHV From cDNA-There are several critical points in utilizing the cDNA assembly reverse genetic system for coronaviruses. First, several of the large cDNAs have a tendency to undergo deletion when grown in E. coli if care is not taken in making plasmid preps. For this reason we always grow the bacteria containing these plasmids at 30\u00b0C (Support Protocol 2) and check that the inserts are the correct size prior to use. We maintain DNA stocks of each plasmid that worked successfully as well as glycerated stocks of the bacteria so we can retransform with a plasmid that we know to be correct. A second critical parameter relates to the ligation of the gel purified cDNAs. We always monitor each ligation step by agarose electrophoresis. If a ligation has not gone to completion we add additional ligase and continue the incubation for an additional 6-24 hours. Gel purified cDNA fragments should be stored at \u221270\u00b0C for no longer than 8 weeks for best results at the ligation step. It is also important to use relatively fresh ligase. We recommend that you avoid using ligase that has been on hand for greater than 4 weeks. In vitro transcription kits can loose activity during storage in the freezer. We keep our T7 polymerase in a Stratacooler (Stratagene) and take care that it is kept cold when taken out of the freezer. It is essential to have a good transcription reaction and to avoid RNA degradation, therefore good technique is called for. We monitor the transcription reaction by gel electrophoresis to be sure that we have synthesized very large RNA transcripts. Finally, when making recombinant viruses containing mutations it is possible to recover undesired wild type contaminants. To minimize the likelihood of this occurring we keep all of the reagents and buffers that we use for transcription and electroporation segregated and in small aliquots. The electroporations are performed in hood that is only used for uninfected cells and we always perform a negative control electroporation that has not received any RNA to monitor for contamination. It is essential to partially sequence any viruses recovered to ascertain that you have recovered the desired virus and not a contaminant. The sequencing should cover any mutations that you have introduced and regions containing marker mutations. For efficient electroporation BHK-R cells need to be growing well and the cell density of the BHK-R cells should be 50-80% confluent prior to harvesting. This is readily achieved by setting up T175 flasks with 7-8 \u00d7 10 7 cells 24 hours prior to harvesting as we describe in Basic Protocol 4.",

The FCWF cells are more fastidious than the other cells that we use in that they require FBS and sometimes grow more slowly without apparent cause. The cells must be growing well to have reliable results with targeted recombination (Basic Protocol 5). In vitro synthesized RNA transcripts must be stored at \u221280\u00b0C until thawed for nucleofection and then kept briefly at 4\u00b0C until the nucleofection reaction takes place.",
