The disease is caused by a porcine coronavirus which, like other members of the family Coronaviridae, is an enveloped, pleomorphic virus, with a single stranded RNA genome of positive polarity. The virions are constructed of three major structural proteins: a phosphorylated nucleocapsid protein (N) and two glycoproteins, the membrane (M) and the large spike (S) protein. The mature S protein, after cleavage, which forms the characteristic club-shaped peplomers, contains 1431 amino acids and is the major inducer of virus neutralizing (VN) antibodies [13, 18] .",

Due to the limitations of the prokaryotic expression system and the use of nonglycosylated oligopeptides, the immunogenicity of defined regions of the S protein in pigs is unclear. The baculovirus expression system has, however, not only the advantage of strong foreign gene expression under the control of the polyhedrin gene promoter but also that the recombinant polypeptides are usually expressed in a soluble form allowing the protein to fold into the proper structure.

This phenomenon is probably due to the higher number of antigenic determinants on the larger proteins and not because of differences in the immunogenicity of these antigens, since similar levels of VN activity were found in the sera of pigs immunized with rBTS 2.2, 3.3 and 4.4.

The reason for the inability of this recombinant protein to induce a VN response is not clear unless the D site does not generate neutralizing antibodies in pigs, in contrast to mice. This result is in agreement with the observation that not all Mabs binding to the 376 to 389 amino acid sequence of S have neutralizing activity [24] and that pig polyclonal TGEV specific antibodies did not recognize the sequence FFSYGE which is essential in TGEV neutralization with D site specific Mabs [25] .",

Antibodies with complete TGE VN activity were induced by immunization with the recombinant proteins that contained all major antigenic regions (rBTS 2.2, 3.3 and 4.4) and there was no significant difference in the VN titres obtained with these antigens although the titers were considerably lower than those obtained by TGEV immunizations [16] . Based on these results it might be assumed that sites B, C and D are not necessary to generate a VN response in pigs and that expression of the essential A site in a vector vaccine may be sufficient to protect against TGE. However, the data obtained for those recombinant proteins which were encoded by the recombinant viruses with a 747 bp deletion at the 5'-terminal half of the S gene (rBTS 2.2D, 3.3D, and 4.4D) refute this assumption. None of these recombinants was able to induce a VN response in pigs despite their intact A site coding sequences, and increasing the size of the cloned gene from 1489bp to 2582bp or 3594bp in rBTS 3.3D and 4.4D did not improve their VN generating capability. This result can be explained by the fact that the deletion of these HaeIII DNA fragments not only eliminated the D site coding region but also affected the two putative receptor binding sites of the S protein [28, 29] . This deletion also may have altered the proper folding of the site A epitopes. Our findings do not exclude the possible utility of shorter deletions or deletions of different parts of the Y-terminal half of the S gene as occurs naturally among strains of the porcine respiratory coronavirus [28] although the effect of such deletions on the globular structure [8] and on the immunogenicity of the amino terminal half of the S protein is difficult to predict.",

By reducing the size of the S gene from 4.3 kb to 2.2 kb it may be possible to generate a helper independent recombinant porcine adenovirus vaccine expressing the part of the S glycoprotein necessary to induce protective immunity in pigs.",

Serum dilutions start at 1:2. B The mean antibody titers measured by the TGEV specific FCEIA. Serum dilutions start at 1:25. Standard deviations within groups were tess than 5% recombinant S protein and the proteins truncated at the carboxy-terminus. rBTS 1.6 did not induce VN antibodies and rBTS 1.8 had only a limited VN inducing capability. Those recombinant viruses which encoded not only the B, C and D antigenic sites but also the entire A region (rBTS 2.2 and 3.3) induced a VN response similar to that induced by the recombinant expressing the complete S potypeptide(rBTS 4.4). The same sera were tested in a F C E .2D ~ rBTS 3.3D \u2022 rBTS 4.TGEV specific mean FCEtA titers of the pig sera obtained after immunization with the proteins expressed by recombinant baculoviruses carrying a deletion at the 5' terminal half of the S gene. Dilutions start at 1:25 (Fig. 5B) in which they all reacted with the TGEV antigen by the third week post-vaccination, and the highest titres were generally produced in response to the larger proteins.",
