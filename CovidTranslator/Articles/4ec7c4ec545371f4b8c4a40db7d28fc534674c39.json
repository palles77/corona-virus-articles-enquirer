Consistently with previous studies [13, 21, 22, 25] , our participants' self-reported HH performance rate of self was positively correlated with their scores for perceptions, attitudes, and role models. An explanation for this is that general perceptions of HH [13, 21, 22] and the perception of being a role model for one's colleagues [13, 25] are very important for improving HH compliance among HCWs [13] . As such, these findings could be used in future HH promotion strategies for nurses.",
