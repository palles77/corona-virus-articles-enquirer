We hypothesised that feline TLR4 polymorphisms might underlie an observed increased risk to infectious and inflammatory diseases in some cat breeds. The aim of this study was to identify breed-specific variations in the coding region of feline TLR4 and to model the effect of mutations on protein structure and function in silico. The entire coding region of TLR4 was sequenced in 8 groups (7 pure-bred, 1 crossbred) of domestic cats (Felis catus) comprising 158 individuals. Twenty-two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were identified in TLR4, with 16 located in the coding region (11 non-synonymous) and four in the 3\u2032UTR. Comparison of breed specific allelic frequencies indicated that Burmese and British shorthairs most commonly differed from other breeds. In silico analyses to predict the impact of the 11 non-synonymous variants indicated a deleterious effect on protein structure for one SNP (c.869 G > A), which was not associated with a specific breed. Overall, findings from this study do not support a role of TLR4 dysfunction in breed-predispositions to infectious diseases in domestic cats in Australia.",

Twelve non-synonymous SNPs were identified in the exonic region of TLR4 in 335 dogs comprising 7 breeds compared to 11 non-synonymous SNPs in cats. However, 2/12 of the non-synonymous SNPs identified in canines were predicted to be \"probably damaging\" and 3/12 \"possibly damaging\" using PolyPhen-2 software compared to 1/11 identified as \"possibly damaging\" in cats. When additional predictive software (SIFT, PROVEAN) was used only 1/5 non-synonymous SNPs in dogs was deemed to be deleterious using all three calculations. Interesting, the variant allele frequency of this likely damaging SNP was approximately 75% in Boxer dogs, 20% in Shar Peis and less than 5% in the other five breeds tested (Cusc\u00f3 et al., 2014) , suggesting the potential for a breed predisposition to diseases where TLR4 function is critical.",

The higher number of non-synonymous SNPs identified in bovines compared to dogs and cats may reflect the higher number of individuals investigated or greater overall genetic diversity in this species.

The six SNPs for which all cats in the current study were homozygous for the alternate allele, are also reported as the alternate allele in the reference genomic sequence (GCF_000181335.3), suggesting that these are SNPs within the genome of the cat from which the cDNA reference sequence was created.",
