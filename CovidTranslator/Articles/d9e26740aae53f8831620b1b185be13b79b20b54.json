Consequently, aspects of the transmission and epidemiology of these pathogens are imprinted on the genetic diversity of their genomes. Large-scale empirical analyses of the evolutionary dynamics of important pathogens are now feasible owing to the increasing availability of pathogen sequence data and the development of new computational and statistical methods of analysis. In this Review, we outline the questions that can be answered using viral evolutionary analysis across a wide range of biological scales.",

For example, the exceptionally high nucleotide mutation rate of a typical RNA virus 1 -a million times greater than that of vertebrates -allows these viruses to generate mutations and adaptations de novo during environmental change, whereas other organisms must rely on pre-existing variation maintained by population structure or balancing selection. In addition, many viruses frequently recombine, further increasing the opportunity for genetic novelty. Consequently, populations of fastevolving pathogens can accumulate detectable genetic differences in just a few days and can adapt brutally swiftly, even when the adapted genotype would have been strongly deleterious in a previous environment. The interaction between evolution and epidemiology is reciprocal: the maintenance of onward transmission may be crucially dependent on continuous viral adaptation, just as the fate of a viral mutant may be decided by its hosts' position in a transmission network.",

We focus on studies that infer viral transmission dynamics from genetic data; these are typically based on concepts from phylogenetics and population genetics, but they also link pathogen evolution to the dynamics of infection and transmission. In the last decade, such studies have matured from theoretical and qualitative investigations (for example, REFS 3, 4) to global genomic investigations of key human pathogens (for example, . Understandably, most studies have focused on important human RNA viruses such as influenza virus, HIV, dengue virus and hepatitis C virus (HCV); therefore, this Review concentrates on these infections.

Although the explosion in viral genomic data is outpacing our ability to develop methods that fully exploit the potential of these data, we provide an overview of the key biological questions that can be tackled using current evolutionary analysis methods (BOX 1) . For example, when did a newly emergent epidemic begin, and from which population or reservoir species did it originate? Can genetic data resolve the order and timing of transmission events during an outbreak? How swiftly do pathogen strains move between continents, regions and epidemiological risk groups, or even between different tissues in a single infected host? Perhaps the most recognizable achievements of viral evolutionary analysis to date are the reconstruction of the origin and worldwide dissemination of HIV-1 (REFS 8, (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) (14) (15) (16) , and the explanation of influenza A epidemics through the combined effects of natural selection and global migration 5, 6, [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] .",

The role of contemporary human migration in determining global viral dynamics has been most comprehensively studied for the influenza A virus by the systematic collection, sequencing and analysis of thousands of viral isolates. Historically, influenza has caused intense bursts of human mortality, most notably associated with the reassortment of human and non-human influenza viruses, which creates strains for which humans have no acquired immunity. evolutionary analysis of the antigenic haemagglutinin gene (HA) of the dominant H3N2 strain has shown that the influenza A virus evolves rapidly through time, yet viruses sampled concurrently from different continents exhibit limited diversity and are typically descended from a common ancestor only a few years earlier 5, 22 . Recent evolutionary studies have revealed that the virus re-emerges each year from a persistent southeast Asian 'source' and follows global aviation networks to temperate 'sink' regions, seeding new winter epidemics there that die out over summer 5, 6 (FIG. 1) . The global restriction on the diversity of influenza A virus is caused by selective sweeps driven by the host's acquired immunity, which generates rapid antigenic evolution 24 and corresponding high rates of amino acid change at HA antigenic sites 19 . evolution of influenza A virus is even more dynamically complex when the whole genome is considered -reassortment between genome segments modulates the action of selection, so that some selective sweeps are genome-wide, whereas others only restrict the diversity of HA 5 .",

The divergence rates of a series of infections can be plotted against time (see the figure, parts a-d). Each infection is represented by a differently coloured cone of divergence -the gradient of each cone equals the mean rate of within-host virus evolution and the width of each cone represents the variance of this rate. The long-term accumulation of virus divergence at the epidemic level (dashed lines) depends on three factors: the variation in evolutionary rate among strains within a host; whether the average viral rate varies over the course of infection; and whether the strain transmitted to the next host is selected randomly with respect to its evolutionary rate. Empirical analyses indicate a high variance in evolutionary rate among lineages within a host 75 , which is caused, at least in part, by latent non-replicative infection of cells 108 . Provided that the lineages are transmitted to subsequent hosts randomly (see the figure, part a) , the long-term virus evolutionary rate will, on average, equal the average within-host evolutionary rate, even when these average rates differ between patients (P) (see the figure, part e).",

One explanation for this difference is that transmission is nonrandom, such that slower-evolving lineages are more likely to successfully generate the next infection than faster ones, with the result that the long-term rate is less than the average within-host rate (see the figure, part b) . Indeed, the short-sighted action of natural selection will tend to favour those strains with higher within-host fitness, even at the cost of lowered transmissibility. Thus, transmitted viruses could be preferentially drawn from lineages that have accumulated fewer mutations, such as those that have spent a greater proportion of time in a latent state. This effect may be enhanced by the existence of a genetically distinct HIV subpopulation in genital mucosa 88, 89 .",

As yet, the possible effect of recombination on HIV evolutionary rates at different scales is unknown. Whatever the underlying cause, if average evolutionary rates vary during infection then the long-term rate of evolution becomes dependent on when transmission occurs. If within-host rates decline during infection then more rapid transmission will result in a faster long-term rate of evolution (see the figure, part c) than slower transmission (see the figure, part d). This has been shown for the human T cell lymphotropic virus type II, a leukaemia-causing relative of HIV, which seems to evolve many times faster in rapidly transmitting drug users than in populations that are vertically infected during breastfeeding 4 . Conversely, it has been argued that within-host rates increase over the first weeks of infection, owing to the activation of the immune response that drives viral adaptation, hence fast early transmission could alternatively lead to slower long-term rates 111 Recent analyses indicate that these dynamics are best described by a source-sink model of viral population structure, with a persistent reservoir in South-East Asia driving viral diversity worldwide 5,6 . a | Complete genome sequences sampled from New York State, USA, and from Australia and New Zealand have provided a high-resolution snapshot of diversity in these locales over successive seasons 5, 22 .

Additionally, within-host analyses can reveal the evolutionary processes that underlie some aspects of clinical disease. In practice, such analyses have so far been limited to viruses that establish chronic infections lasting months or years, and for which measurable amounts of genetic change occur between viral samples; this is particularly the case for HIV infection and, to a lesser extent, for HCV and hepatitis B virus 72 infection. strong natural selection is clearly the dominant force determining HIV evolutionary dynamics in hosts: HIV phylogenies display a high turnover of short-lived lineages that is driven by host immune selection, analogous to the pattern observed for influenza A virus at the global scale 2 (BOX 2). Correspondingly, HIV genetic diversity at any particular time is low but slowly increases over the course of chronic infection 73 . Numerous analyses have quantified HIV adaptation and evolution using gene sequences, particularly for the viral envelope gene. These studies have found that these processes correlate with the rate of progression to clinical AIDs [74] [75] [76] and the rate at which HIV evades neutralizing antibody responses 77 . equivalent studies of HCV infection have found that viral adaptation predicts the outcome of acute infection 78, 79 and that HCV diversity correlates with levels of liver damage 80 .

This confluence has produced a burgeoning interest in the evolutionary and epidemiological processes that leave their imprint on pathogen genomes, as reflected in the empirical studies and analysis techniques reviewed here. However, it is our opinion that many investigations still fail to fully appreciate or utilize the rich source of epidemiological information contained in viral genome sequences. genetic data can independently corroborate surveillance data during an epidemic and can shed light on events before the initial report of the outbreak. Furthermore, evolutionary and surveillance data provide alternative perspectives on the same underlying phylodynamic process and can therefore be validated against one another. The practicality of this approach was demonstrated during the H1N1 'swine flu' epidemic, first detected in April 2009. Tens of viral sequences were made publically available within days of discovery of the virus, and evolutionary analysis was incorporated into initial assessments of the pandemic potential of the new strain 50 .",

When applied to slowerevolving DNA viruses, bacteria and protozoa, evolutionary analyses similar to those introduced here can help elucidate longer-term processes, such as host-pathogen co-divergence and pathogen speciation [99] [100] [101] .",

For RNA viruses, which have genomes that are on average only 15,000 nucleotides long, it is likely that hundreds or thousands of complete genomes sampled from both viral epidemics and infected hosts can be routinely subjected to molecular epidemiological analysis. ensuring that computational and statistical developments keep pace with this revolution in data acquisition will be a great challenge. one promising solution is to harness the power of 'multi-core' or massively parallel computing technologies in evolutionary analysis 103 . The coming genomic era will also allow us to determine how much information can be inferred from gene sequences alone -only those ecological processes that occur on the same timescale as genetic change will leave their mark on genetic data, and robust evolutionary inferences carry a statistical uncertainty that should be accurately estimated and reported.",

Therefore, a clear goal for the future is to further develop analytic methods that combine genetic and epidemiological data to reconstruct epidemic history and to predict future trends, a task to which Bayesian inference methods of statistical inference are well suited. Further development of analysis methods is required in three key areas: the quantification of viral adaptation by natural selection; the explicit integration of evolutionary and spatial information; and the measurement of rates of viral reassortment or recombination. Advances in these areas could raise new questions for phylodynamic analysis. For example, do lineages differ in their rates of spatial diffusion? And are bursts of viral adaptation associated with recombination events? However, such analytical finesse is of little use if basic epidemiological information, such as the date and location of sampling, is unavailable, and we implore researchers generating viral sequences to attach as much sample information to each sequence as ethical constraints permit.",

A phylogeny of 13 HIV-1 viral particles (blue circles) sampled at different times (horizontal axis) from 9 different patients for whom the times and direction of viral transmission are known. The virus phylogeny (blue lines) can be mapped within the transmission tree (yellow boxes and arrows), analogous to the mapping of a gene genealogy within a species tree. We can trace all the viruses sampled from one patient back to the time of transmission. Whether more than one lineage is transmitted at this time from the donor will depend on the size of the genetic bottleneck at transmission. Even in the presence of a tight bottleneck, a diverse population in the donor can result in lineage sorting, with the result that the topology of the virus phylogenetic tree does not exactly match the transmission tree.",
