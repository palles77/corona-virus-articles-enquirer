Second, the codes for various ICD tabulation lists were mapped to the GBD cause list. Third, the un-underlying causes of death, which were called garbage code (GC) in the GBD study, were redistributed by using a series of statistical methods and models [7] . Finally, the burden of disease for different diseases was systematically analyzed. To determine the cause of the difference in IHD ASMR trend between GBD2010 and GBD2013, the original DSP data were used to compare the cause-of-death analysis methods for IHD with similar GC redistribution approaches separately in both studies.

At that time, local medical workers and personnel death statisticians could not understand the underlying cause of death (UCD) clearly, including ill-defined death, complicated chain of death causes, and so on. Hence, when they filled out the death certification, sometimes they regarded the un-underlying causes of death as UCD, including chronic pulmonary heart disease (PHD). In addition, an effective tool to control the quality of underlying cause of death (UCD) in the data entering system was lacking during the 1990s. Thus, the database contains a corresponding proportion of chronic PHD as a UCD, although chronic PHD has been assigned to COPD in the DSP annual report. Chronic PHD was called GC in the GBD study [7] . After the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), the Chinese government strengthened the infrastructure of the public health system, including setting up a national public health information network for countrywide coverage in 2004. The individual certifications with ICD10 codes were reported through the computer-assistance information network, which improved the quality of death certification, especially the accuracy of the UCD coding by using automatic coding software. For example, in the death certificate, disease A is pulmonary heart disease (I27.9), disease B is emphysema (J43.9), and disease C is chronic bronchitis (J42). The computer would automatically regard chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD; J44.8) as the UCD [9] , which means that after 2004, all chronic PHDs were redistributed to COPD automatically and no chronic PHD was regarded as UCD in the database. In general, the quality of data collection in the DSP system is high, which have been validated in previous studies [10] .",

Since after 2004, 100% chronic PHDs were redistributed to COPD by the automatic coding software during data collection, and no chronic PHD cases could be redistributed during data cleaning. The redistribution fractions of chronic PHD from some selected years in GBD2010 and GBD2013 from the GBD team are shown in Table 2 . These two approaches were simply called GBD2010 and GBD2013. Owing to the 2.5% ill-defined categories [10] and the fixed fraction of the other GCs for IHD, we just focused the redistribution of chronic PHD as GC in GBD2010 and GBD2013, which might have led to a few underestimations of the mortality level of IHD in this study.

The original IHD death cases increased with time, which were the same as the cases in GBD2010 (grey bar in Figure 1 ). In the DSP system, the number of deaths from chronic PHD decreased with the improvement of the death registration quality, from 4,687 cases in 1991 to 3,411 in 2002 (Table 1) . Thus, in GBD2013, owing to the fraction of chronic PHD as GC to IHD, the highest increase in the number of deaths from IHD was in 1991 (43% for males and 56% for females), but the increment number of deaths was reduced in the following years before 2004. After 2004, no chronic PHD cases have been assigned to IHD (Figure 1 ). The difference in the proportion of IHD in all death cases and the mortality trend of IHD with different redistribution from chronic PHD were quantitatively analyzed by using ASMR based on the 2010 census population structure in China. The fraction for IHD cases increased from 4.1% in 1991, 5.6% in 1996, and 6.1% in 2002 without PHD to be adjusted to IHD in GBD2010. However, after using the chronic PHD redistribution fraction from GBD2013, owing to a fraction of IHD cases redistributed to IHD before 2004, the number of IHD cases increased and the fractions remained at approximately 8% from 1990 to 2002 (Figure 2 ). Therefore, by using the GBD2013 approach, the ASMRs increased by 100.21% in 1991, 44.81% in 1996, and 42.47% in 2000, in comparison with the GBD2010 approach. The increase was faster for females than for males (Table 3) . Thus, the mortality rates for IHD were elevated in the early 1990s.",

Thus, a few (approximately 5%) of mortality levels of COPD were overestimated with the GBD2010 method. The method of redistribution of GC needs to be further improved. The key procedure should be to improve the reporting quality of medical death certificates. After 2004, no chronic PHD has been recorded as UCD in the DSP system and the quality of death certification has improved, as the DSP system follows a strict data collection procedure, including training of local staff and using a computer-assisted coding system.",

Some international studies showed that IHD is the main cause of mortality and morbidity in most developing countries, including China, and this pattern will probably be unchanged in 2020 [16] . Meanwhile, the trend of IHD mortality is consistent with the lifestyles change and increasing behavior risk factors in Chinese, such as smoking, unhealthy diet, hypertension, and overweight/ obesity.",

More than 100 Chinese and international scientists reviewed the findings on the cardiovascular disease (CVD) burden of GBD2010 and GBD2013, and other studies on CVD in China discussed the risk factors related to the mortality trend of CVD, and realized that results in GBD2013 may lead to an overestimation of IHD and underestimation of COPD, especially for provinces with high proportions of PHDs as GC, which may also lead to a false description of the mortality trend of IHD and COPD for the Chinese population [6] . The symposium promoted the consensus on the redistribution of PHD as GC, and the approach redistribution of PHD would be corrected in GBD2015.",

The main reason is the different methods of chronic PHD redistribution in the two GBD studies. In GBD2010, the deaths from chronic PHD were redistributed to COPD from 1991 to 2010, and none of them were redistributed to IHD, which was the same as the original methods in the DSP system. However, in GBD2013, before 2004, the cases were redistributed to COPD, IHD, and HTD by different fractions based on the module. After 2004, all chronic PHD cases were redistributed to COPD by using the automatic coding software mentioned in the methodology section of this paper. By using the GBD2013 approach, owing to changing the redistribution fraction of chronic PHD, more IHD cases were adjusted in the early 1990s, which led to high mortality rates during the period.",

To better promote the transformation of the findings of the GBD study to translate the policy, whether the GBD results are in line with the actual situation of China should be determined. Careful evaluation and validation of the GBD results is an important component of the GBD study. Our study will promote the allocation of GC in a manner that is more scientific and closer to reality. Moreover, evaluation and verification are important processes to promote the dissemination and policy.",
