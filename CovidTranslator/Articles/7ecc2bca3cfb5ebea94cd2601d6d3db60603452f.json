Vital signs, physical exams, laboratory tests, and electroencephalogram (ECG) were performed and recorded in routine process for inpatient paediatric patients. Chest computed tomographic (CT) scans were performed to detect signs of pneumonia if any. In particular, other respiratory pathogens were detected for differential diagnosis screening, including influenza A virus, influenza B virus, parainfluenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus, adenovirus, epstein-barr virus, and mycoplasma pneumoniae. Therapeutic information was also collected from electronic medical records. In addition, the median incubation period and disease course were analysed for epidemiological and clinical features of paediatric patients with COVID-19.",

Thus, close contact with residents of Wuhan was indicated as a high risk factor for transmission in adult patients. However, a considerable proportion of patients (47.60%) were noticed without any exposure history in our study. The unanticipated finding suggested the referential value of exposure history for diagnosis of COVID-19 should be considered carefully for paediatric patients. In addition, family cluster transmission was common in paediatric patients. Close dynamic monitoring for families with adult patients would contribute to early identification for paediatric patients. In accordance with the features of indirect contact exposure, the incubation period was 10.50 (7.75 -25.25) days in paediatric patients, while 4.00 (2.00 -7.00) days of incubation was revealed for patients in all age groups [1] .

However, the information of paediatric patients remains unclear. We describe the clinical and epidemiological characteristics of paediatric patients to provide valuable insight into early diagnosis of COVID-19 in children, as well as epidemic control policy making. Methods and Findings This retrospective, observational study was a case series performed at 4 hospitals in the west of China. Thirty-four paediatric patients with COVID-19 were included from January 1 to February 25, 2020. And the final followup visit was completed by February 28, 2020. Clinical and epidemiological characteristics were analyzed on the basis of demographic data, medical history, laboratory tests, radiological findings, and treatment information. Data analysis was performed on 34 paediatrics patients with COVID-19 aged from 1 to 144 months (median 33.00, IQR 10.00 -94.25), among whom 14 males (41.18%) were included.",

After lysis and centrifugation, the suspension was collected for 2019-nCoV nucleic acid detection. RT-PCR assay was preformed using 2019-nCoV specific kit (NC-ORF1ab/N, DAAN GENE, Guangzhou, China). The adapter primers and probe were supplied with kits, targeting to the open reading frame 1ab (ORF1ab) and nucleocapsid protein (N) of CoV gene in accordance with the recommendation of National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China [10]. Specifically, for target ORF1ab: forward primer sequence CCCTGTGGGTTTTACACTTAA; reverse primer sequence ACGATTGTGCATCAGCTGA; and the probe sequence 5'-FAM-CCGTCTGCGGTATGTGGAAAGGTTATGG-BHQ1-3'.
