New research suggests a complex relationship between viral respiratory diseases and development of bacterial pneumonia in dogs. Over the past decade, much has been discovered about the convoluted interplay between host and environmental factors that leads to this complex of diseases. In cats, bacterial pneumonia is less commonly identified than inflammatory feline bronchial disease.",

Risk factors that have been identified for the development of aspiration pneumonia include esophageal disease, refractory vomiting, seizures, prolonged anesthesia, and laryngeal dysfunction ( Table 1) . 2 In a healthy animal, physiologic and anatomic features reduce the chance of aspiration. During a normal swallow, fluid and food are propelled caudally in the oropharynx and through the upper esophageal sphincter by contraction of the oral cavity and tongue. At the same time, the epiglottis retracts to cover the laryngeal aditus and protect the trachea from particulate inhalation. Adduction of the arytenoid cartilages then contributes to further occlusion of the upper airways. Any process impeding these primary defenses or inhibiting the normal swallowing reflexes increases the likelihood of aspiration.",

Irritation induced by acid inhalation promotes a local environment in which bacterial colonization can develop and lead to bacterial pneumonia. The severity of disease varies depending on the quantity and nature of the material aspirated as well as the length of time between the event and its diagnosis. Conscious patients with intact airway reflexes tend to cough and prevent massive aspiration injury. Animals under anesthesia or with reduced airway reflexes because of neurologic disorders are less likely to cough in response to the aspiration event and are, therefore, more likely to develop diffuse pulmonary infiltrates and acute lung injury. In many instances aspiration injuries occur under general anesthesia and the presence of a cuffed endotracheal tube does not prevent inadvertent aspiration.",

CIRD is especially prevalent in dogs naive to the pathogens and exposed in overcrowded, stressful environments such as animal shelters, boarding kennels, and treatment facilities.

            "text": "TREATMENT Treatment of bacterial pneumonia varies considerably with the severity of disease, and appropriate antibiotic therapy is essential. The International Society for Companion Animal Disease is currently constructing guidelines for antibiotic therapy for respiratory infections. Pending those guidelines, antibiotic recommendations from previous literature should be considered ( Table 5) . For stable animals with mild disease, outpatient therapy consisting of administration of a single, oral antibiotic is often all that is necessary. Antimicrobial choices should ideally be based on culture and sensitivity results from airway lavage samples, although sometimes empiric therapy is more practical. Regardless, in cases of severe pneumonia, initial empiric therapy should be instituted while awaiting culture results. Antibiotics are typically administered for 3 to 6 weeks, and at least 1 to 2 weeks beyond the resolution of clinical and/or radiographs signs of disease. Animals with more advanced disease require more intensive care, including hospitalization with intravenous fluids to maintain hydration. Adequate hydration is essential to facilitate clearance of respiratory exudates. Nebulization to create particles that enter the lower airways (<5 mm) can also enhance clearance of secretions. Nebulizer types include ultrasonic devices, compressed air nebulizers, and mesh nebulizers. Nebulization with sterile saline can be achieved by directing the hosing from the Pneumonia in Dogs and Cats nebulizer into a cage or animal carrier covered in plastic. Depending on how viscous secretions are, therapy can be provided for 15 to 20 minutes 2 to 4 times daily. In many cases, nebulization coupled with coupage helps the animal expectorate airway secretions. Coupage is performed by cupping the hands and gently and rhythmically pounding on the lateral thoracic walls in dorsal to ventral and caudal to cranial directions. Coupage should not be performed in animals with regurgitation because any increase in intrathoracic pressure could exacerbate regurgitation and subsequent reaspiration. Supplemental oxygen is necessary for animals with moderate to marked hypoxemia (documented by a PaO 2 less than 80 mm Hg or oxygen saturation via pulse oximetry less than 94% on room air) in conjunction with increased respiratory effort. Oxygen supplementation at 40% to 60% is provided until respiratory difficulty lessens and the animal can be weaned to room air. Animals with refractory pneumonia that fail to improve on supplemental oxygen can succumb to ventilatory fatigue and need to be referred to an intensive care facility for mechanical ventilation.",

Decreasing the viscosity of airway secretions might improve expectoration of fluid and debris that accumulates in dependent airways, although no published information is available on use of mucolytics in animals. N-acetylcysteine is typically not used via nebulization because of the risk of bronchoconstriction and epithelial toxicity. Under no circumstances are cough suppressants (such as butorphanol or hydrocodone) appropriate for use in the management of bacterial pneumonia, particularly when it is complicated by bronchiectasis. By decreasing the cough reflex, these drugs perpetuate retention of mucus, debris, and other material in the airways and therefore hinder clearance of infection. Also, furosemide should not be used because drying of secretions traps material in the lower airway and perpetuates infection.",

With disorders of esophageal motility, upright feedings of either slurry or meatballs can enhance esophageal transit. Furthermore, diets low in fat can increase gastric emptying. In patients with refractory vomiting, antiemetic and prokinetic agents can be used to reduce the episodes of vomiting. Drugs like maropitant (Cerenia; 1 mg/kg subcutaneously once daily) or ondansetron (Zofran; 0.3-1 mg/kg intravenously or subcutaneously once to twice daily) act peripherally and centrally to decrease the urge to vomit and are safe to use in both cats and dogs.",
