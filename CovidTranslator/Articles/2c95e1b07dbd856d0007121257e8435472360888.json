In this study, the full-length 3CL protease from PRRSV was cloned and overexpressed in Escherichia coli. Crystallization experiments yielded crystals that diffracted to 2.1 \u00c5 resolution and belong to space group C2, with unit-cell parameters a = 112.31, b = 48.34, c = 42.88 \u00c5 , = 109.83 . The Matthews coefficient and the solvent content were calculated to be 2.49 \u00c5 3 Da \u00c01 and 50.61%, respectively, for one molecule in the asymmetric unit.",

            "text": "Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS), also called 'blue ear' disease, is manifested clinically by severe reproductive failure in sows and respiratory distress in pigs of various ages (Paton et al., 1991) . This disease has become endemic in many countries and has caused great economic losses in the swine industry worldwide (Tian et al., 2007; Dea et al., 2000) . Viruses of the order Nidovirales regulate their genome expression by synthesizing two multidomain precursor polyproteins that are subsequently cleaved into functional viral proteins mainly by the 3CL protease (den Boon et al., 1991; Birtley et al., 2005; Snijder et al., 1996; van Aken et al., 2006) . The functional importance of the 3CL protease in the viral life cycle makes it an attractive target for the development of small-molecule drugs. Several crystal structures of 3CL protease have been solved, e.g. those of human coronavirus 229E (hCoV-229E; Anand et al., 2003) , severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (SARS-CoV; Yang et al., 2003) , equine arteritis virus (EAV; Barrette-Ng et al., 2002) and transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV; Anand et al., 2002) . Despite the common structure of the 3CL proteases determined to date, consisting of two -barrels and a unique C-terminal domain, there are many significant differences between them, especially in the linker between the C-terminal domain and the C-terminal -barrel ( Barrette-Ng et al., 2002) .",
