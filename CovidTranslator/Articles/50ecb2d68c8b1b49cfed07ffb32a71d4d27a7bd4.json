Most farms were dedicated to beef or dual-purpose (DP) production. Faecal samples were collected over a 6-month period from a total of 194 calves with clinical signs and from 186 animals without clinical signs of diarrhoea as assessed by a scoring system. The samples were investigated for the presence of viruses, bacteria and parasites. Torovirus was detected for the first time in Costa Rica and was present in 14% of calves with diarrhoea and in 6% of the controls. Coronavirus and Rotavirus were less frequently encountered in either one of the groups (in 9 and 7% of scouring calves and in 1 and 2% of controls, respectively). Escherichiu coli was detected in 94% of all the faecal samples, but isolates from only three samples from calves with diarrhoea contained the K99 antigen. Similarly, Salmonella was found only in scouring calves. Cryptosporidium oocysts were detected in animals with signs of diarrhoea, while other coccidia oocysts, Strongylida and Strongyloides eggs were frequently found i-n animals both with and without diarrhoea. A conditional logistic regression (CLR) analysis to compare healthy and scouring calves showed a significant difference with regard to the presence of Torovirus, Rotavirus and Coronavirus. 0 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.",

            "text": "Diarrhoea in young pre-weaned calves is one of the most important causes of calf morbidity and mortality (Oxender et al., 1973; Tzipori, 1981; Olsson et al., 1993) . Disease incidence in young calves has an adverse effect on their immediate health status, longevity in the herd and productivity performance and thus causes great economic loss (Britney et al., 1984; Vanopdenbosch and Pohl, 1993) . In order to increase productivity per livestock unit without increasing livestock numbers, it is important to identify the etiological and predisposing factors involved in calf diarrhoea in order to devise preventive measures and reduce losses during the initial months of life. Previously, such studies have been conducted on various dairy farms in Costa Rica (Oviedo et al., 1987; Corder0 and Osorio, 1988; Hird et al., 1990) . However, most cattle in Costa Rica (60%) are kept in extensive beef production systems and 18% are kept in dual-purpose (DP; beef and dairy) systems. Moreover, beef production has increased recently in Costa Rica from 37.1 in 1974-1976 to 51.7 kg in 1986-1988 per head of cattle and calves (Simpson and Conrad, 1993) . Furthermore, the dual-purpose system is expected to increase in relevance to the foreseeable future (Perez, 1994) . Consequently, we devised a case-control study to compare the prevalence of selected pathogens in calves with and without diarrhoea in 15 beef or dual-purpose farms in a tropical dry-forest ecosystem.",

The selected farms belonged to a pilot project initiated by the staff of the Veterinary School of the Universidad National as part of a livestock-information system (Dwinger et al., 1994) . The calf-rearing units at these farms were visited weekly over a period of 6 months during the dry season (November 1993 to April 1994 . The canton of Tilaran is situated at lO\"29'58\" northern latitude and 84\"54'26' western longitude and contains areas with tropical dry forest and tropical moist forest. The average annual rainfall ranges between 2000 and 4000 mm and the ambient temperature between 24 and 30\u00b0C. Four farms were extensive enterprises (average area: 300 ha) and dedicated to beef production. The calves on these farms remained with the dams for several months. Ten farms were dedicated to dual-purpose production. In these farms, the calves remained with the dams for several days postpartum before milking started. After the daily milking routine, the calves were allowed to suckle the dams once or twice a day. At nine farms, milking was done mechanically and manually in the remaining one. In three of the dual-purpose farms, the calves were housed together with the dams and were only separated before milking, when they were temporarily housed in small pens. On the remaining seven dual-purpose farms, the calves were housed separately from the dams, either inside large communal pens or during the day when they grazed outside as a group. The time of weaning varied from 3 months to 1 year of age. One farm was a speciahsed dairy and raised the calves in individual pens with whole milk.",

            "text": "All calves under 3 months of age with signs of diarrhoea were sampled, provided they had not received prior treatment with antibiotics. Diarrhoea was defined according to a scoring system which took into account colour (1 = normal; 2 = abnormally light or dark), smell (1 = normal; 2 = ambiguous; 3 = foul) and consistency (1 = normal; 2 = soft; 3 = watery). Other aspects, such as the presence of blood or particles (of undigested food, blood clots or pieces of intestinal tissue) in the faeces, mucosity and the presence of a dirty tail, hocks or ischiadic processes were also recorded. An animal with an additive score of more than 4 using colour, smell and consistency, was considered a case of diarrhoea. If an animal had a score of 4 and dirty hind parts, it was also considered a case. For each case calf, a corresponding calf with normal faeces, closest in age (w-th a maximum age difference of 2 weeks), of the same breed and on the same farm was sampled as control. Whenever an animal was sampled, a form was completed with relevant information. Sample size was calculated as the minimum number of calves necessary to detect a difference between 15% (prevalence rate of Rotavirus in calves with diarrhoea; Hird et al., 1990) and 6% (prevalence rate of Rotavirus in calves without diarrhoBea; Hird et al., 1990 ) at a confidence level of 95% and a power of 80%; 179 calves with diarrhoea and 179 controls were needed. Controls were discarded whenever they turned into cases within 1 week of sampling and, consequently, the match was not used in the analysis.",

Two Eppendorf bottles (1.5 ml each) were filled with the supematant and frozen at -70\u00b0C until further investigation. Bovine Coronavirus, Rotavirus and Torovirus were detected by means of a DOT-ELISA as described by JimCnez (1990) . Briefly, filtration paper was used to support the nitrocellulose membrane (Transblot @ Transfer Medium, Bio-Rad). Before preparing the Bio-dot@ microtiter plate (Bio-Rad), the membrane and filter paper were washed in distiled water and all bubbles were removed. The microtiter plate was closed as tightly as possible, washed with carbonate-bicarbonate buffer (pH 9.6) and all the fluid was sucked away with vacuum. Thereafter, each cup was filled with a 100 ~1 sample, which was thawed at 7\u00b0C and centrifuged for 10 min at 8160 g using an Eppendorf centrifuge. The samples were filtered through the nitrocellulose membrane and the membrane was removed from the microtiter plate. Subsequently, the nitrocellulose membranes were blocked with 1% casein in PBS, prepared according to Vogt et al. (1987) and the antisera were added. For Rotavirus, a monoclonal antibody against the P-6 polypeptide (Liprandi et al., 1990) and for Toro-and Coronavirus, a polyclonal monospecific antiserum conjugated to N-hydroxysuccinimidobiotin was used (JimCnez, 1990) . The membranes were incubated with agitation at room temperature for 90 min and washed three times with PBS 0.05% Tween solution. Thereafter, in the case of Rotavirus, Fab' specific anti-mouse peroxidase conjugate (Sigma) was added and in the case of Corona-and Torovirus, a commercial avidin-peroxidase conjugate (Sigma) was used. The membranes were incubated for 90 min as described above, washed two times with PBS 0.05% Tween solution and once with PBS. A solution of 4-chlor-1-naphtol (Sigma), prepared according to Voller and Bidwell (1986) , was used as substrate. The chromogen was added to the nitrocellulose membranes and read after 5 or 10 min. A clear b;lue reaction was considered positive. Intensities were not measured.",

The percentage of scouring calves in which no enteropathogen could be detected was comparable to results of other surveys (Reynolds et al., 1986; Hird et al., 1990) . This relatively high percentage might indicate that many cases of diarrhoea were not associated with infectious disease agents, but due to nutritional or other management factors. Alternatively, the failure to detect infectious agents could be due to insufficient sensitivity of the methods of detection, intermittent shedding of pathogens or the existence of other agents that cause diarrhoea but were not investigated.",

All calves infected with Rotavirus in our study were simultaneously infected with E. coli, none of which possessed the K99 pilus antigen. However, somatic antigens or adherence antigens different from K99 are present in E. coli strains and can be similarly associated with secretory forms of diarrhoea (Heath, 1992) . A combination of Rotavirus and enteropathogenic E. coli has been reported to cause a more severe infection than either one of the agents alone (Mebus et al., 1969) . In other studies, the lactation number of the cow was a source of variation in immunoglobulin concentration of the colostrum (Besser and Gay, 1985) and calves born alive of primiparous cows had a higher mortality and morbidity due to diarrhoea than calves born by older cows (Olsson et al., 1993; Perez et al., 1990) . However, we found no difference in morbidity between calves of primiparous heifers and cows with a higher number of parturitions (Table 3 ). The same is true for the difference in morbidity rates in male and female calves. In some reports, morbidity and mortality rates did not differ between gender (Umoh, 1982; Debnath et al., 1990) . Others studies showed differences between gender (Olson et al., 1989; Vaccaro, 1990) .",
