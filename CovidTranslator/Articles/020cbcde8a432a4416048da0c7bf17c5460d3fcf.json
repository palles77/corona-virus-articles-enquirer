In experimental work calves may be fed colostrum before exposure, deprived of colostrum until after exposure or deprived of colostrum for the entire experiment. When exposure to an infectious agent isolated from a sick calf does not produce disease in colostrum-fed calves on experiment, it may suggest the agent crossed the placental barrier, infection taking place before birth causing the calf to be born weak, prolonging the time between birth and colostrum feeding, or that the agent may be in the environment, infection taking place immediately at birth before colostrum feeding.",

But this isolation does not imply new and complex management procedures. From our present understanding of the nature of viral infections within a herd, we cannot assume that only the sick calves have been exposed. The question arises as to what factors have tipped the balance in favor of the healthy calf. Probably no single factor alone can shift the balance in favor of the healthy calf. When a virus gains entry into a herd, results of good management practices such as good nutrition for the dam and calf and clean dry calving and calf-rearing areas may be disappointing. However, many viral infections are self-limiting in that mature animals do not die but have either overt disease or inapparent infection and recover and begin to produce antibodies against the agent in question. These antibodies will prevent an intrauterine infection and concentrated in the colostrum will protect the calf at birth if the colostrum is fed before the calf is infected heavily.",
