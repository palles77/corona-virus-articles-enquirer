In healthcare settings, the ability to communicate clearly with coworkers, patients, etc. is crucial to quality patient care and safety. The objectives of this study were to 1) assess the suitability of the Speech Transmission Index (STI) methods for testing reusable and disposable facial and respiratory personal protective equipment (protective facemasks [PF], N95 filtering facepiece respirators [N95 FFR], and elastomeric half-mask air-purifying respirators [EAPR]) commonly worn by healthcare workers, 2) quantify STI levels of these devices, and 3) contribute to the scientific body of knowledge in the area of SI. SI was assessed using the STI under two experimental conditions: 1) a modified version of the National Fire Protection Association 1981 Supplementary Voice Communications System Performance Test at a Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) of \u221215 (66 dBA) and 2) STI measurements utilizing a range of modified pink noise levels (52.5 dBA (\u22122 SNR) \u2212 72.5 dBA (+7 SNR)) in 5.0 dBA increments. The PF models (Kimberly Clark 49214 and 3M 1818) had the least effect on SI interference, typically deviating from the STI baseline (no-mask condition) by 3% and 4% STI, respectively. The N95FFR (3M 1870, 3M 1860) had more effect on SI interference, typically differing from baseline by 13% and 17%, respectively for models tested. The EAPR models (Scott Xcel and North 5500) had the most significant impact on SI, differing from baseline by 42% for models tested. This data offers insight into the performance of these apparatus with respect to STI and may serve as a reference point for future respirator design considerations, standards development, testing and certification activities.",

            "text": "Speech Intelligibility (SI) and clear communication among healthcare workers (HCWs) are vital components of healthcare delivery systems and occupational safety. This is especially true in times of public health emergencies and disaster situations. With approximately 13 million HCWs in the United States, clear communication in healthcare has a broad scope with significant impacts. SI is the quality or condition of speech being intelligible and clearly understood. It is well-documented that hospitals are often loud environments, which makes the issue of SI challenging. Hospital noise levels have been rising consistently since the 1960s. The background noise levels in hospitals rose from 57 dBA in 1960 to 72 dBA today during daytime hours, and from 42 dBA in 1960 to 60 dBA today during nighttime hours (1) . The World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines for hospital noise levels are 35 dBA during the day and 30 dBA at night in patient rooms, with recommended nighttime peaks of 40 dBA (2) . Many studies indicate that peak hospital noise levels often exceed 85 dBA to 90 dBA (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) . Noise from alarms and certain equipment that exceeds 90 dBA (for example, portable X-ray machines) are comparable to walking next to a busy highway when a motorcycle or large truck passes. These increased noise levels can pose significant challenges to communication among hospital staff and with patients. Busch examined hospital noise levels reported in 35 published research studies over the last 45 years (1) . It was found that not one published study reported noise levels that complied with the WHO guidelines for noise levels in hospitals (1) .",

The MRT is standardized under the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) S3.2 1960 and involves a listener attempting to properly identify certain key words preceded by a carrier sentence. For example, Radonovich et al. found that the odds of correctly hearing a word spoken by a HCW wearing an EAPR in an Intensive Care Unit (ICU) setting was approximately 0.46, compared with other commonly used respirators in the same location, on average (20) . However, the MRT involves human test subjects, causing results to be variable and validity to be diminished based on each individual's unique variations in speech and the way listeners interpret those variations in speech. Sample size has also been small in previous studies, which may have decreased reliability (20) . Human subject testing is also time-consuming, expensive, and often leads to incomplete data sets due to test subject attrition. Furthermore, the spoken words in the MRT are not industry specific, which plays a vital role in a field such as healthcare where highly technical words and sentence structures are used, as well as numerous acronyms.",

STI testing is a quantitative and objective method of speech transmission quality assessment in the presence of ambient (pink) noise. The STI was developed in the 1970s and is standardized under the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) Standard 60268-16. In contrast to subjective methods used to measure SI, the STI offers the advantages of being objective, highly repeatable, reproducible and time-efficient. A single value is calculated by the Modulation Transfer Function (MTF) using the signal-to-noise ratios per octave band with weightings that reflect the SI. The STI uses seven octave bands in the range of 125Hz to 8000Hz.",

To assess the method for respirator and facial PPE use it was desirable to examine both repeatability measurements within each sample donning, and reproducibility measurements between each sample donning. The NFPA method requires three facepiece samples, each of which is donned on the manikin five times, with three measurements taken during each donning, for a total of 45 measurements. To assess repeatability within each donning, it is desirable to have a sample size larger than three repeats. Ideally, 28 measurements per sample and donning would need to have been performed in order to achieve the desired statistical power of 0.90. This would have led to a total of over 1,500 measurements for the six models tested. However, due to time constraints, this power level was not within the scope of this study. In an effort to increase the number of repeat measurements, the current study used three respirator samples, which were donned three times with five measurements taken during each donning. Utilizing this type of measurement protocol allowed for a better assessment of repeat measurements in a consolidated timeframe, while still maintaining a sufficient quantity of replicates.",

Three donnings of each facial PPE sample were performed under each experimental condition with five replicate measurements per donning. To ensure consistency, the same investigator performed each donning. Each STI value was measured directly in front of the K.E.M.A.R HATS Manikin at 1.5m per NFPA 1981. This distance was re-measured and readjusted inside the hemi-anechoic chamber when necessary to ensure the utmost accuracy ( Figure 2 ).",

The NFPA method requires three face piece samples, each of which is donned on the manikin five times with three measurements taken during each donning for a total of 45 measurements. To assess repeatability within each donning it is desirable to have a sample size larger than three repeats, ideally 28 measurements per sample and donning would have been performed in order to achieve the desired power of 0.90 (the implemented modification had a negligible impact on the power). This would have lead to a total of over 1500 measurements for the six models under test. The modified version of the NFPA method was utilized in order to yield more STI measurements per facepiece sample to assess the variability and repeatability. An analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed for each respirator model comparing the means by sample (3 samples per model) and donning (3 donnings per sample) as well.",

Day 1 Testing-For the first experimental condition, the difference in means were assessed using a one-way ANOVA for each model sample. For both N95 FFR models (3M 1860 and 1870), the data from each sample donning is not statistically different (p > 0.05). Similarly, for the PF (KC 49214 and 3M 1818), the data from each sample donning can be considered statistically equivalent with p > 0.05. For the EAPR's (North 5500 and Scott Xcel), only sample 3 in each case was found to be statistically equivalent. For the North 5500, the maximum difference in means between donnings was 0.052 for sample 1 and 0.042 for sample 2. For the Scott Xcel, the maximum difference in means between donnings was 0.024 for sample 1 and 0.052 for sample 2. Figure 3 shows data from the second experimental condition (STI measurements utilizing modified pink noise levels of 52.5 dBA (\u22122 SNR) to 72.5 dBA (+7 SNR) in 5.0 dBA increments. The graph in Figure 3 illustrates that significant differences in SI exist between the different classes of PPE tested and the effect of background noise. This is shown in the boxplot illustrating STI scores by model in Figure 4 at a background noise level of 57.5 dBA (\u221215 SNR). Overall, the PF (Kimberly Clark 49214 and 3M 1818) had the least effect on SI interference, typically deviating from the STI baseline (no-mask condition) by 3% and 4% STI for the Kimberly Clark 49214 and 3M 1818, respectively. The N95FFR had more effect on SI interference, typically differing from baseline by 13% for the 3M 1870 and 17% for the 3M 1860.

However, unlike this study, word intelligibility between PFs and N95 FFRs were not found to be statistically different. According to Table IV , the STI value of 0.45 found for the North 5500, falls in the upper range of the \"poor\" quality category or lower range of \"fair\", corresponding roughly to an intelligibility between 67% and 87%, that is consistent with a previous study which reported an average three foot MRT score of 73% and 88% (Tables II, III Radonovich et al.

This can be accomplished through architectural design improvements, engineering controls and quieter equipment. As shown in Figure 3 , with increasing background noise SI decreases and the differences between the PPE types quickly shrinks. Furthermore, a HCW using either an N95 FFR or a PF loses little with respect to SI. Thus, reducing background noise will be one of the most effective ways to improve SI in healthcare environments.",

A nonhuman modality was undertaken for this study for the purposes of objectivity and time constraints. The uni-directionality of testing was performed in order for the results to be valid, consistent and reproducible. Testing in multiple angles or distances would considerably increase the amount of time and resources needed. The surgical masks used were a flat-fold design whereas the N95 FFRs were cup-shaped (3M 1860) and tri-fold (3M 1870), rendering them further away from the face when donned. No models tested contained exhalation valves or voicemitters, which may have an effect on SI.",

Also, independent replication of this experimental work would provide validation of the STI method as a reliable methodology for testing different types of PPE. Data could also be used for benchmark testing and design improvements for manufacturers of facial and respiratory PPE. Further investigation into a more diverse range of models and sizes under different conditions (different directions, reverberation, etc.) would be valuable contributions as well. Future studies should identify the design features that could lead to EAPRs and N95 FFRs with STI scores in the excellent range, which would allow a higher B95 standard STI pass/fail criterion to be considered (e.g., 0.75) in the future.",

The two N95FFR models (3M 1870 and 1860) had a greater effect on SI interference compare to the PF models, typically differing from the STI baseline measurement by 13% for the 3M 1870 and 17% for the 3M 1860. The two EAPR models (Scott Xcel 742 and North 5500) had the most significant impact on SI, differing from the baseline STI measurement by 42% for the Scott Xcel and 45% for the North 5500 shows the sounds pressure levels per octave band for each respirator model during the testing with the background noise at 52.5 dbA (\u221215 SNR). Figure 6 illustrates why the EAPRs performed worse than the N95's and surgical masks. Examining the sound pressure level in the 1kHz to 4 kHz range, it is noted that the sound pressure level for both EAPR models is lower than baseline by approximately 10 dBA at 1kHz, 20 dBA at 2kHz and 15 dBA at 4kHz. This indicates that the STI signal sound pressure level has been significantly attenuated by the EAPR facepiece in these frequency ranges. Furthermore, at the 2kHz and 4 Khz frequencies, the sound pressure level of both EAPR models is nearly equivalent to the background noise level. Thus, the STI signal is masked by the background noise and intelligibility in these key frequency ranges is significantly degraded. To a lesser degree the same observation can be made about the N95 respirators (3M 1860 and 3M 1870) .",
