We represent a dataset of published papers in the Public Library of Science (PLOS) via a cocitation network and compute three established centrality metrics for each paper in the network: closeness, betweenness, and eigenvector. Our results show that the network of papers in a journal is scale-free and that eigenvector centrality (1) is an effective filter and article-level metric and (2) correlates well with citation counts within a given journal. However, closeness centrality is a poor filter because articles fit within a small range of citations. We also show that betweenness centrality is a poor filter for journals with a narrow focus and a good filter for multidisciplinary journals where communities of papers can be identified.",

With current scientometric knowledge, researchers can identify key journals, key authors, and several related journal level metrics that would allow them to assess the relative relevance of a journal on the topic of interest. However, even if the researchers can narrow their search to a reduced set of journals, they are left with the problem of filtering the thousands of articles in each journal to a meaningful initial set. The current practice for determining the importance of a paper is to track the number of times that the paper is cited (Abt 2000; Sikorav 1991; Zhu et al. 2004 ). However, citation counts are influenced by numerous variables and require years to accumulate even in the most highly regarded journals (Garfield 2006; Neylon and Wu 2009; Stringer et al. 2008 ). In addition, the reliance on citation counts only, could cause the researcher to overlook newly published papers as they have not yet had a chance to accumulate citations. Another approach is to rely on journal publisher and read the recommended articles. However these recommendations usually center on new articles at the exclusion of older ones. Ideally, researchers would have the ability to immediately identify important papers in a given journal such that they are aware of the existing body of knowledge that has accumulated in the journal over the years while being able to leverage new contributions as quickly as they are published.",

            "text": "In this article we propose the adoption of established network centrality measures that compute the importance of journals to determine the extent to which an individual paper is important or key within a given journal. Historically, the number of citations that a paper accrues serves as the currency through which we measure the importance of a paper and a myriad of journal importance measures have been proposed. For the most part, three measures related to network centrality serve as effective guidelines for: (1) authors making choices about where to disseminate their research; and (2) libraries making purchasing decisions (Gross and Gross 1927) . These three network centrality measures are: betweenness centrality, closeness centrality, and eigenvector centrality. Each of these centrality metrics utilize the network of citations formed between publications to determine (1) which journals are important (Barnett et al. 2011; Griffin et al. 2015) , (2) which authors are important across journals (Liu et al. 2005; Yan and Ding 2009), or (3) to identify important sentences or keywords within documents (Beliga et al. 2015; Erkan and Radev 2004; Khan and Wood 2015) . However, to our knowledge, the application of these metrics to filter out and determine the importance of papers within a single journal has not been explored. As a result, we apply these centrality metrics to the papers within PLOS in order to determine which of these metrics can be used to effectively filter out important papers in a journal. Specifically, we ask the following questions:",

Historically, point centrality seeks the identification of the person within a network that is structurally more central to the network than any other person in the network; however, a main difficult arises in determining if the central position is structurally unique (Freeman 1979) . Therefore, the central node (be it a person or any other object within the network) represents the key position in the network. Various metrics have been introduced for determining whether a node is key based on (1) the node that is closest to all other papers (Freeman 1979) , (2) the node positioned on the shortest path between the greatest number of other nodes (Freeman 1977; Leydesdorff 2007) , and (3) the node that is key due to its connection to highly valued nodes (Bonacich 1987) . These metrics are known as closeness centrality, betweenness centrality, and eigenvector centrality, respectively. They take into account the manner in which the citations: (1) accumulate over time for an individual journal; and (2) form a relationship among different journals.",

Nodes that sit on the path between two other nodes serve to control the flow of information between the other nodes ranging from complete control (when only one path exists between the two other nodes) to limited control (when multiple paths exist between nodes) (Freeman 1979) . Deleting nodes with high Betweenness centrality values from a network serves to break the network into coherent clusters (Leydesdorff 2007) . These nodes also control the flow of knowledge between other nodes (Li-chun et al. 2006) . Leydesdorff (2011) shows the application of betweenness centrality, among other metrics, to analyze the fields of nanotechnology and communications within a journal-journal citation network. Betweenness centrality computes the frequency with which a given journal is cited to create the shortest path (i.e. a bridge) between two other journals (Guns et al. 2011; Hanneman and Riddle 2005; Leydesdorff 2007 ).",

A paper that directly connects with many other papers has a high closeness centrality value while a paper with many indirect connections has a lower value. Articles that reside on the outer edges of a citation network are likely to have low closeness values since they require the presence of other intermediary articles in order to reach other articles (Siler 2013) . As such, papers with high closeness centrality values extend their influence throughout the entire network (Li-chun et al. 2006 ) and can be seen as a measure of how long it will take for information to spread from a given node to the remainder of the network (Liu et al. 2015) . Closeness centrality computes the shortest path from one journal to a different journal based on the citations of papers within each journal (Leydesdorff 2007) .",

Journals that frequently create shortest path bridges between different journals have high betweenness centrality and are considered important. Journals with low closeness centrality scores spread information to other journals quickly and are considered important. These metrics have been applied at the journal-journal level to find key journals; at the journal-journal level to find key authors across journals; at the paper level to find key words and sentences; and for analyzing various topic-specific bodies of knowledge (such as brain networks) to find key papers or authors within the given domain. However, there is a gap in the literature for applying these centrality metrics to determine key papers within an individual journal. This is the gap that we seek to fill by applying these metrics to find key papers within PLOS by examining the co-citation network formed within PLOS for PLOS papers cited by other PLOS papers. The following section provides the algorithms for each of these metrics and provides an example network configuration to better illustrate the determination of key papers for each metric.",

Eigenvector centrality also measures the keyness of a paper based on the overlap of the papers that it cites within its own journal and papers that it cites within other journals (Bonacich 1972) . Bonacich (1972) finds that overlaps with central groups provides a greater benefit than overlaps with isolated groups.

Figure 1 displays the same network three times colored differently for each of the centrality metrics. Figure 1a displays the key Glue paper for the network.

A color scheme represents the keyness of each paper in the network with the most ''key'' papers shown in dark red (maximum value) and the least key papers shown in dark blue (minimum value). a N 9 falls on the greatest number of shortest paths between other nodes within the network and serves as the Glue paper. b N 4 contains the greatest number of connections (direct plus indirect) to the other nodes and serves as the Kevin Bacon paper. c N 5 connects to higher valued papers and serves as the Big Fish paper.

In the next section, we present how these centrality metrics fit into our methodology for examining papers within PLOS.",

We start by modeling the publication as a co-citation network consisting of the papers within the publication as nodes and the relationships (the citations) between each of the papers as links. To generate this network, we first retrieve the list of citations for each paper within the journal. Next, we check each of the cited papers to identify if each cited paper comes from the same publication. For each of these papers, we then check their citations to see if they also originate from the same publication. We repeat this process until there are no additional citations that originate from the same journal as the initial paper. This procedure results in a directed network with the flow of information originating from the cited paper into the paper doing the citing. Therefore, we form a dataset of papers A n citing papers B Ax , where n is the number of papers within the publication and B AX is the set of papers within the publication that A i cites (where i is the current paper).

Our assumption is that since citation count is the standard metric, any good metric should correlate well with the number of citations. The approach is as follows. For each key paper obtained we identify (1) the total number of times the paper has been cited in any journal, (2) the total number of times the paper was cited within the journal it was published, and (3) the number of times the paper was cited by other papers within its publishing journal in the first five years of its publication. We use the Spearman correlation coefficient to measure the degree of association between each metric and these three citation counts for each key paper in order to compare the rank of a paper's centrality to its respective citation count. Spearman correlation functions by sorting the papers by high to low centrality value and assigning them a numerical value based on their ranked position after being sorted. Then, the papers are sorted by high to low value based on their citation counts and assigned a numerical value indicating their ranking after being sorted. These two sets of ranking values are then checked for correlation. This correlation approach normalizes the non-linearities between the two sets of data and also accounts for ties within the data sets (i.e. multiple papers with 1 citation).

The inception dates of these journals vary from 2003 to 2005, but each journal has continued to be published through 2014. For each of these journals, we construct a network representation of the papers using the approach described in the ''Methodology'' section, resulting in six unique co-citation networks. The process of creating each of these domain-specific networks starts by taking only the papers within the current periodical and then linking each paper to each other paper that it cites within any of the PLOS journals. This process repeats for each of the cited papers, and then for each of the cited papers' cited PLOS papers, and so on until there are no more cited papers that cite a PLOS paper.

Then we take the citation lists for each of these three papers and add them as nodes with links pointing towards the papers that they cite. This process repeats until no more citations exist within PLOS. Then, we take the next paper within PLOS Biology that is not already contained within the network and start this process again, each time adding to the existing network for PLOS Biology.

In the case of the journals that we analyzed, this filter returns zero papers. Closeness centrality (Kevin Bacon Paper) is also not a good filter because it yields a large number of papers. This finding confirms the recency bias discussed in Price (1965) and points to the lack of existence of the ''super classic'' paper that was posited in Price (1965) . In other words, there is no foundational set of papers that are cited at a relatively higher frequency in the journals that we analyzed. Eigenvector centrality (Big Fish Paper) yields a small set of papers and therefore is the best filter that can be used as an initial starting point. A key observation is that the papers we discover as Big Fish are relatively recent (2007) (2008) (2009) (2010) (2011) (2012) (2013) (2014) . The number of links shown in Column 4 are the number of links connecting any PLOS paper to another PLOS paper within the dataset This finding fits the metric since eigenvector centrality looks at the importance of a paper based on the papers that it cites. The transitive property of eigenvector centrality dictates that newer papers mentioning several important works gains more importance regardless of length of time between the publications. We also observe that although the papers identified as key have a low number of citations, the number of downloads is very high (average 1704 and median 1082 downloads).

Column 2 displays the correlation between the eigenvector centrality value and the number of citations that the paper has accumulated by other papers within PLOS after 5 years. Column 3 displays the correlation between the eigenvector centrality value and the number of citations that the paper has accumulated by other papers within PLOS by the year 2014. Column 4 displays the correlation between the eigenvector centrality value and the total number of citations from any source that the paper has accumulated by the end of year 2014 according to Google Scholar ([0.80) . The eigenvector centrality values correlate well within discipline key papers within 5 years of publication and at least moderately predictive for all other citations. As a result, we conclude that eigenvector centrality is the most appropriate centrality metric for filtering papers and measuring the relative importance of a paper within a journal. Eigenvector centrality identifies the papers frequently cited by other important papers within other disciplines of the same journal for papers within a specific discipline. A high Spearman ranking correlation between eigenvector centrality values and citation counts indicates that papers with high eigenvector centrality values also have high citation counts relative to the other papers within the journal. Recall that Spearman ranking correlation accounts for the ranking of eigenvector values against the ranking of the citation counts for the papers. This might indicate that people are more likely to cite (1) papers within the outlet that they are trying to publish in because the authors are aware of the existing research or they feel pressured to cite papers within this outlet as discussed in Wilhite and Fong (2012) and (2) papers within their first 5 years of publication since they are on the cutting edge of research as observed in Price (1965) .",

This may occur due to the authors being less aware of the papers, being less inclined to search for papers outside of the journal that they are publishing in, or feeling less pressured to cite papers within the current outlet thereby denoting a real non-spurious relationship between the two measures. The papers with low eigenvector centrality values are less likely to be cited by researchers going forward as these papers may not be at the forefront of the research within that discipline, as evidenced by the high correlation between low eigenvector values and low citation counts. However, these papers remain likely to be cited since the correlations remain strong. These finding is also in line with those of Price (1965) . In short, Eigenvalue is a good metric for in-journal article ranking with the limitation that the value of a paper can be inflated as the papers it relates grows in citation count.",

We show that the co-citation network within PLOS follows a power law similar to that of the citation count of a paper over time. Consequently, closeness centrality is not very useful for filtering the papers within a journal because it yields too many important papers and betweenness centrality is not a useful metric when there are no communities of papers to connect. Results show that eigenvector centrality is a good metric for identifying important papers in a journal. Our results are critical in that eigenvector centrality is time-independent and allows for the identification of key papers at the time of their publication. While a newly published paper may be classified as a key paper with respect to eigenvector centrality, the paper will not yet have had a chance to be read by the scientific community; therefore, the eigenvector centrality metric serves as a starting hypothesis that the paper is indeed a key paper. These Big Fish papers link with highly regarded papers and having passed through a peer reviewed process may indeed serve as a key paper within the same networks as the papers that they cite.",

We also recommend that journals publish and update the top 10 or top 25 papers in decreasing order of eigenvector centrality each time a new issue of the journal is published. This top 10 or top 25 can constitute the initial set of papers that the journal recommends a researcher use as a starting point for exploring the journal. The peer-review process remains critical in preventing unworthy papers from being published even if they cite a large number of key papers. Chan et al. (2015) note that the quality of the scientific contribution of a work can be biased due to factors such as institutional affiliation and the time of publication. Therefore, the eigenvector centrality metric identifies papers that are reachable from other key papers, but it does not serve as an absolute metric on the quality of identified Big Fish papers. Furthermore, in terms of proposal submission and promotion, researchers can show the importance of new publications before they accumulate citations by employing eigenvector centrality. Finally, each researcher can create a co-citation network of their publication and measure the relative importance of their work based on the eigenvector centrality rather than the total citation count. By doing so, researchers can identify other important work that is related to their most important work and thus explore fruitful lines of work and areas of collaboration with other researchers working in the same domain.",
