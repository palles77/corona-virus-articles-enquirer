Recent engineering of small molecules designed from RNA sequences to target miRNAs opens up new possibilities in drug development. Furthermore, RNA-based vaccines have been engineered applying RNA virus vectors and non-viral delivery for vaccine development. Traditional science-driven drug discovery has been mostly based on screening for small molecule drugs [1] . More recent technology development has allowed expansion into targeting biotherapeutics [2] , and during the past few years, we have seen some signs of breakthrough in gene therapy [3] . Despite major development on all fronts of drug discovery and development, bringing novel drugs to the market has not been highly successful. Evidently, there remains a large proportion of the 'chemical space' still to be explored in existing chemical libraries [4] . However, the main reasons for the low success rate can be found in difficulties related to delivery, unwanted side effects and drug inefficiency. Obviously, the increase in safety requirements and demands of significant benefit over existing drugs has further limited the success of bringing new drugs to the market. Therefore, the introduction of novel drug targets might provide the means for the discovery of better medicines.",

            "text": "In this context, targeting RNA-based drugs is definitely an interesting approach. Particularly, RNA interference (RNAi) plays an important role as potential molecules for gene silencing, which could provide new means for not only drug target identification and validation, but also therapeutic interventions [5] . In principle, RNA-based gene silencing relates to cleavage of double-stranded RNA into 21-23 nucleotides siRNA by the cellular endonuclease Dicer followed by binding to and degradation of mRNA [6] . Furthermore, miRNA and short hairpin RNA (shRNA) can contribute to gene silencing [7] , for instance, miRNA and chimeric shRNA/miRNA molecules can function at the post-transcriptional level [8] . Especially, the reversibility of gene silencing has made miRNA sequences attractive tools for drug development [9] . Moreover, significant effort has been committed to apply RNA for vaccine development. In this context, in vitro transcribed RNA, particularly based on viral replicon sequences have been used for immunization to provide protection against challenges with lethal doses of pathogens and cancer cells [10] . Additionally, mRNA has been employed for ex vivo modification of APCs, for instance, dendritic cells (DCs), which have proven to be safe and well tolerated and capable of inducing immune responses against tumor antigens [11] . Direct application of mRNA for APC in situ modification has been demonstrated feasible and efficient in preclinical studies. In this review, emphasis is put on the different aspects of applying RNA approaches for both RNA-based drugs and vaccines.",

For instance, a reliable quantitative reporter-based siRNA validation system has been established based on short synthetic DNA fragment containing an RNAi-targeted sequence of interest and two expression vectors for targeting reporter expression and triggering siRNA expression [12] . As only short synthetic DNA fragments are required, the system provides a powerful strategy for screening of RNAi-targeted sequences from mammalian genes as well as application of RNAi-based dsRNA reagents for reverse functional genomics and therapeutic use. Much attention needs to be invested in siRNA design as factors such as low G/C content and low internal stability favor silencing efficiency [13] . Application of RNAi for target validation also requires strong engagement of an RNAi library construction. For instance, enzymatic production of RNAi library, in which cDNA is converted by a sequence of enzymatic treatment into an RNAi library consisting of an array of different shRNA constructs has been applied [14] . When the RNAi library was subjected to high-throughput screening, it was possible to identify the shRNA constructs. It was also possible to construct an RNAi library from a cDNA library, which will enable future whole-genome phenotypic gene screening.",

For this reason, chemical modifications have the potential of enhancing nuclease resistance, prevention of immune activation, lowering off-target effects and improvement of pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties [15] . For example, 2\u00b4-O-methyl-modified antisense oligonucleotide RNAs called antagomirs demonstrated improved resistance to degradation [16] .",

For instance, polymers provide protection for siRNAs from serum nuclease degradation and can aid in cell targeting [18] . Application of polyethylenimine polymers allows the formation of complexes with DNA and siRNA, which creates a proton sponge effect and results in accumulation in the liver, lung, spleen and kidney [18, 19] . Polyethylenimine polymers can be modified by polyethylene glycol, which provides higher transfection efficiency, better solubility and stability as well as longer circulation time in vivo [20] . In a nanoplatform approach, tumor-targeted and pH-responsive nanoparticles were engineered by the combination of an artificial RNA receptor and Zn(II)-DPA hyaluronic acid for the delivery of siRNA, miRNA and oligonucleotides [21] . The nanoparticles were further coated with calcium phosphate and showed efficient delivery of siRNA and miRNA for gene silencing or miRNA replacement into different human cancer cells in vitro and into tumor-bearing mice after intravenous (iv.) administration. Another core-shell micelleplex delivery system based on block copolymer bearing polyethylene glycol, matrix metalloproteinase 2-degradable peptide PLG*LAG, cationic cell penetrating peptide polyarginine r 9 and poly(e-caprolactone) has been used for siRNA delivery [22] . The micelles carrying siRNA demonstrated prolonged circulation time in blood, increased accumulation at tumor sites and cell penetration for siRNA uptake. Furthermore, the inhibition of breast tumor growth was increased.",

Successful delivery of siRNA to neurons was obtained in mouse brain and resulted in inhibition of protein expression and protection against viral encephalitis [25] . Likewise, the liposome-siRNA rabies virus glycoprotein peptide complex was able to knock down the cellular prion protein expression and substantially decreased the protease-resistant isoform in neurons infected with transmissible spongiform encephalopathy [26] . Furthermore, complexes of a mixture of fusogenic and cationic lipids with nucleic acids named stable nucleic acid-lipid particles (SNALPs) have demonstrated efficient siRNA delivery [27] . Coating SNALPs with polyethylene glycol has provided a neutral or hydrophilic surface, stabilizes the particles and protects the cationic bilayer from rapid systemic clearance. SNALPs have been used iv. in mice carrying replicating HBV [27] . The outcome was improved efficacy, increased half-life and reduced HBV DNA concentration in the serum. SNALP-based delivery has also been used in clinical trials for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia [28] .

            "text": "An attractive alternative to nanoparticle-based delivery of RNA is application of viral vectors. Especially, lentivirus vectors have demonstrated high efficiency of shRNA delivery, and it has also been established in bone marrow cells and blood [33] . For instance, lentivirus vectors have been used for delivery of shRNA engineered to silence the Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase (SDS1) mutant SOD1 G93A in mice [34] . Intraspinal administration of lentiviral SOD1-shRNA provided long-term and significant decrease in mutant SOD1 protein and delay in the onset and progression of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Similarly, lentivirus vectors were applied for the expression of prion protein-specific shRNAs for efficient knock down of the cellular prion protein and prolonged survival of scrapie-infected mice [35] . However, there is a limitation to clinical applications as the silencing of the cellular prion protein is irreversible. Another application of lentivirus-based shRNA delivery has been the knock down of chemokine receptor CCR5 in a humanized bone marrow-liver-thymus model [36] . As individuals with deletions in the CCR5 gene are resistant to HIV infections, this might provide a possibility for the development of an anti-HIV therapy. In this context, the lentivirus-based bone marrow/liver/thymus-HIV (rHIV7-shl-TAR-CCR5RZ) has entered a Phase Ib clinical trial for an anti-HIV drug [37] .",

            "text": "Another aspect of applying RNAs in medicine has been the use of miRNAs as biomarkers. In this context, miRNAs have been linked to a large number of diseases for which they may serve as biomarkers [68] . For instance, miRNA binding site polymorphism in the 3\u00b4end untranslated regions of KRAS rs6174370, SET8 rs16917496 and MDM4 rs4245739 are highly promising cancer biomarkers [69] . Similarly, miRNAs have been identified as potential diagnostic biomarkers in renal carcinoma [70] and multiple myeloma [71] . The application of miRNAs as biomarkers has also been suggested for other disease indications such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, as specific expression of seven miRNAs was observed in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients [72] . Moreover, miR-196a, miR-30a-5P and miR-490 have been associated with disease activity among patients with membranous nephropathy and diabetic nephropathy and may serve as biomarkers [73] . Likewise, miR-223 and miR-143 provide important systemic biomarkers for psoriasis activity [74] . Interestingly, a panel of five miR-NAs has demonstrated the potential as biomarkers for diagnosis and assessment of male infertility [75] . In addition to direct applications of miRNAs as biomarkers, they can also be used for target and drug efficacy assessments, with a special emphasis on prediction of clinical responses in patients, promoting personalized medicines [76] . Particularly, in oncology, this approach has allowed prescreening for diseasespecific therapy without subjecting patients to drugs showing no clinical benefit [77] .",

The outcome was significant differences in induction and effector memory and central memory responses, protection and insert stability. Clearly, the SIV gag-pol vaccine provided the best results. In another study, virus-like particles containing the Kunjin virus replicon and the Ebola virus wild-type GP, a membrane anchor-truncated GP (GP/Ctr) and a mutated GP (D637L) with enhanced shedding capacity were evaluated for Ebola virus protection in guinea pigs [ [85] showing humoral and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte responses in mice. Additionally, protection against challenges with lethal doses of Ebola virus in mice and guinea pigs was observed after administration of VEE particles expressing Ebola nucleoprotein [86] and GP [87], respectively. Likewise, VEE particles expressing the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus GP provided protection against challenges with lethal doses of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus in vaccinated mice [88] . In another approach, alphavirus particles with the Rift Valley fever virus GP Gn was fused to the C3d complement protein elicited neutralizing antibodies and provided protection against Rift Valley fever virus challenges in mice [89] . VEE particles have also been subjected to expression of the A33R, B5R, A27L and L1R genes for the development of smallpox vaccines [90] . Protective immunity was obtained in vaccinated mice. Vaccination of macaques generated strong antibody responses, which neutralized and inhibited the spread of vaccinia virus.

The immunization also provided long-term protection, which lasted for 3 months post-vaccination. However, the therapeutic efficacy was only 67%, which could be significantly enhanced by coexpression of HPV E6 and E7 [104]. In a prostate tumor model, strong cellular and humoral immunity was observed after subcutaneous administration of VEE particles expressing the human prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) [105] . Additionally, the prostate tissue-specific six transmembrane epithelial antigen of the prostate was expressed from VEE vectors, which induced a specific immune response and significantly prolonged overall survival of mice bearing TRAMPC-2 tumors [106]. Antitumor protection was achieved in 90% of vaccinated TRAMP mice when prophylactically immunized with a prostate stem cell antigen DNA plasmid followed by VEE-prostate stem cell antigen particle administration [107] . Finally, brain tumors have been targeted in several studies. For instance, a significant reduction of intratumoral vascularization was observed after intratumoral delivery of SFV particles expressing endostation [108] . Additionally, SIN vectors expressing the human melanoma-associated antigen gp100 and IL-18 induced specific antitumor cytotoxic T-lymphocyte responses and provided tumor protection [109] . Immunization prevented B16-hgp100 tumor formation and showed significant survival prolongation in mice with established B16-hgp100 tumors.",

In this context, the CD16 ectodomain of the CD16-RIgE chimera was replaced by the envelope GP domain III of dengue virus or West Nile virus Kunjin and were expressed on the surface of human and insect cells [115] . Displayed on VLPs domain III were capable of inducing specific neutralizing antibodies against dengue virus and West Nile virus in mice. Although the response was modest, this approach could be developed as a vaccine against different flaviviruses. Alphaviruses have also been subjected to vaccine development. For example, when BALB/c mice were vaccinated with an attenuated VEE strain protection was obtained against airborne virus [116] . In another study, a live attenuated V3526 VEE vaccine demonstrated improved protection against VEE challenges [117] . Likewise, vaccination of C57BL/6 mice with a chimeric Eastern equine encephalitis and Western equine encephalitis virus showed complete protection against lethal challenges with a virulent Eastern equine encephalitis strain [118] . The association of Chikungunya (CHIK) alphavirus to recent epidemics has accelerated vaccine development programs. For instance, mosquito transmission of CHIK virus was inhibited by making the replication dependent on internal ribosome entry sites [119] . In the context of RNAi, siRNAs were engineered against two conserved regions in the nsP3 and E1 genes of CHIK, which showed a significant reduction of CHIK virus titers in Vero cells after 24 h (99%) and 48 h (65%) [120] . Furthermore, miRNA-specific sequences targeting replicon particle production were introduced into alphavirus helper RNA [121] . Cellular miRNAs downregulated helper RNA replication, but addition of miRNA-specific inhibitors allowed efficient CHIK particle production. Cellular miRNA further prevented the replicon RNA replication in mice after inoculation of replicon RNA carrying engineered miRNA sequences. This approach demonstrated the feasibility of applying miRNAs for therapeutic interventions. Additionally, VEE RNA-dependent RNA polymerase was targeted by artificial miRNAs for inhibition of VEE replication [122] . Three out of five miRNAs showed significant inhibition of VEE replication in BHK cells.",

VEE replicons carrying the PSMA have also been subjected to a Phase I dose escalation trial in patients with metastatic cancers [126] .

Related to viral delivery, self-amplifying RNA replicons harbored by single-strand RNA viruses of both positive and negative polarity have been used. Typically, replicons of West Nile virus [46] and Kunjin virus [47] belonging to the flavivirus family have been applied. In this context, Kunjin virus replicons expressing GM-CSF demonstrated cure in <50% of mice with established CT26 colon carcinoma and B16-OVA melanoma after intratumoral injections [48]. CT26 tumor regression correlated with the induction of anticancer CD8 T cells. Furthermore, treatment of subcutaneous CT26 tumors showed regression in CT26 lung metastasis. Additionally, Kunjin virus replicons have been applied for vaccine development against simian immunodeficiency virus [49].",

For example, SFV particles expressing influenza virus nucleoprotein generated strong immune responses in mice [80]. Moreover, VEE particles expressing influenza virus hemagglutinin demonstrated protection against challenges with H5N1 virus in chicken [81]. Likewise, when VEE particles expressing the cluster swine influenza virus hemagglutinin H3N2 gene was administered to swine, it resulted in protection against influenza virus challenges [82].
