[3] [4] [5] The variability in the definition of resilience used by studies of physical disease resilience was highlighted in a recent systematic review by Stewart and Yuen. 6 This examined the factors associated with predicting or promoting resilience in the physically ill and found that a range of variables including social support, psychologic factors, and coping strategies were associated with resilience.",

The aim of this systematic review was to summarize the definitions of physical disease resilience and the approaches taken to study resilience in studies examining physical disease and resilient outcomes.",

Peerreviewed quantitative studies with 100 or more participants were eligible. The sample size restriction was applied for pragmatic reasons, as our early work demonstrated that studies of physical disease and resilient outcomes often involved complex analyses with multiple variables and that analyses with smaller populations were often underpowered. Studies examining only psychiatric disorders and resilience at a family or community level were excluded, as were studies not in the English language. The authors were contacted for studies that were not accessible.",

[12] [13] [14] [16] [17] [18] [19] [21] [22] [23] All 11 studies described adversity in their theoretical definition. This is variously described as \"adverse events\" or \"adversity,\" 14,16,17,19,22,23 \"a potentially highly disruptive event,\" 12,13 \"potential trauma,\" 18 \"stressful situations,\" 20 and \"traumatic events.\" 21 Lundman et al. and Perna et al. did not identify an adversity in their study design, although they discussed it in their theoretical definitions of resilience. 19, 20 Many studies referred to a previous work by Bonanno et al. and defined resilience as maintaining healthy levels of function over time despite adversity. 12, 13, 18, 21, 23 Others similarly defined resilience as returning to normal function after adversity, 14 retaining normal function, 19 or adapting successfully to stressful situations. 20 In contrast to this, 2 studies included the concept of thriving under adversity, 16, 17 and the highquality study by Taylor et al. defined resilience as unexpected positive outcomes in adverse conditions. 22 The study by Perna et al. was the only one that stated it was studying resilience as a protective personality factor. This was their justification for not including an adversity in their study design. 20 The remaining definitions treat resilience as a dynamic process, e.g., in 2 studies, Bonanno et al. described the ability to maintain stable functioning following adversity as evidencing resilience. 12, 13 Resilience Measures There were 2 approaches taken when measuring or identifying resilience in the included studies (Table 2) :",

[12] [13] [14] [15] 18, 22 For example, outcome categories for Bonanno et al. were based on the severity of the outcome, with the resilient group comprising those with the absence of or only one posttraumatic stress disorder symptom. 12 Costanzo et al. defined the resilient group as those in which there was no change in functioning before and after the adverse event. 14 Furthermore, 2 studies examined how individuals responded psychologically to an adversity (severe acute respiratory syndrome 10 and breast cancer 15 ) and the way in which these responses changed over time. In these studies, the resilient group was defined as those who demonstrated high psychological functioning following the adversity that changed little over time. 13, 18 The high-quality study by Taylor et al. identified resilience on the basis of better-than-expected outcomes following adversity rather than the maintenance of healthy levels of function over time. The study identified resilience in those who had experienced the adverse event (epilepsy) together with additional disadvantage (poor seizure control and socioeconomic disadvantage) while still maintaining a good outcome (good quality of life). The authors distinguished this from an \"expected good\" outcome (those who experienced epilepsy but no additional disadvantage and demonstrated good quality of life). 22 ",

The nature of the physical diseases that was considered varied.

It is noteworthy that many studies of physical disease refer to resilience in terms of returning to or maintaining normal function. 14, 18, 19, 23 This implies a resilient outcome need not necessarily be an exceptional outcome, particularly if function before the adverse event was not at a high level. Indeed, for those whose baseline functioning was low before the adverse event, the measurement of good function after the event may be evidence for thriving not resilience. Thriving is commonly defined as not solely returning to a normal level of function (as for resilience) but achieving a higher level of functioning. 5, 26 Therefore, the concept of 15 Stroke",

There were 2 approaches to measuring or identifying resilience in the included studies: measuring it using a new or established \"resilience scale\" or identifying it based on outcomes observed in study participants. In all but 2 studies, resilience was measured at a single time point following the adversity. 13, 18 Given the consensus that resilience is a dynamic concept that varies across the life-course, it may be more appropriate to measure resilience at greater than one time point. [3] [4] [5] 8, [12] [13] [14] [16] [17] [18] [19] [21] [22] [23] It would also seem reasonable that measured outcomes either encompass more than one life-course domain or that authors are clear that by measuring resilience using a single outcome only one domain of resilience is therefore being assessed. Of the studies examining outcomes, 3 used composite health indicators such as the short-form 12 questionnaire 13,14,18 and 3 did not. 12, 15, 22 Composite outcome measures may capture a wider spectrum of the resilient outcome, as may selfrated health measures, which are viewed as being reliable and valid measures of individual and population level health and have been found to be powerful predictors of future morbidity and mortality. 27, 28 The characteristics of the resilience measurement scales were not well described by studies but all included a range of psychometric properties. A recent methodologic review of resilience measurement scales concluded that many were lacking conceptual adequacy by focusing on psychometric properties and failing to examine resilience across multiple levels. 29 This involved scales used by studies in this review, including the Wagnild and Young Resilience Scale 19,20 and the Connor-Davidson resilience scale. 12, 15, 18, 21 We found that physical disease may be considered as an adversity after which an individual may or may not demonstrate a resilient outcome. Our work also found that physical disease may act as a variable that promotes or reduces resilience following an adverse event. The promotion of resilience may be an example of a \"steeling effect,\" whereby a negative experience strengthens resilience to another stress. 8 In addition to this, there was a large degree of variability between studies. The nature of the adversity experienced, the characteristics of the disease, the timing and the nature of the measurement of resilience, and the individual's sociocontextual and personality risk and protective factors are all likely to affect the resilient outcome.

However, we acknowledge that as many in the literature treat these terms as synonymous with resilience, we may have missed some potentially informative studies regarding the relationship between physical disease and resilience.

Of particular note, the inclusion of the study by Glymour et al. was subject to some debate owing to its focus on \"cognitive resilience,\" which is generally treated as a component part of cognitive reserve and thus could be seen as a more specialized form of resilience than our review in relation to physical disease aimed to cover. 15 The sample size restriction was applied for pragmatic reasons as our early work demonstrated that studies of physical disease and resilient outcomes often involved complex analyses with multiple variables. Therefore, analyses of populations with fewer than 100 participants were often underpowered. This was further validated by the classification of the 2 studies with the smallest sample sizes in this review as being \"low quality.\" The limitation to adults only is reasonable, given that the burden of physical disease is known to increase with age. 2 Owing to the differences across included studies, we were unable to carry out a meta-analysis; however, we have presented our results in a structured manner to assist interpretation.",

It is unlikely to be feasible for researchers to examine the entire range of potential resilience outcomes across an individual's lifecourse in a single study.
