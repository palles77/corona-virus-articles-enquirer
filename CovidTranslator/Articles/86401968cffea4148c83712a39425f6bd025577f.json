This review shortly describes the main stages of gene silencing mechanism, features of antiviral RNA silencing in plants, invertebrates, mammals, ways of suppression of RNA-interference by viruses, as well as possible approaches of utilization of abovementioned phenomenon for struggling against viral infections.",

It was shown that mutations in the nucleotide sequence lin-4 inhibited the process of animals' development in the same way, as mutations in the protein-encoding gene lin-14 . Taking into account the fact that RNA lin-4 could bind to the transcript of lin-14 in a complementary way, there appeared an idea that lin-4 regulates RNA of lin-14 using RNA-RNA interaction with untranslatable 3'-end of the latest [6] .",

For example RNA of transgene of phytoene desaturase [66] underwent a process of gene silencing while replication of tobacco mosaic virus (TMV), which had the sequence of plant gene in its genome [67] . It caused formation of new term in plant virology as \"Virus-induced gene silencing\" (VIGS). Phenomenon of recovery later demonstrated that plant viruses undergo gene silencing: transgenic plants, which were transformed by the coat protein (CP) of Tobacco etch virus (TEV) and infected by this virus, showed symptoms on inoculated leaves. Hence, new leaves on tobacco plants already were free from the symptoms of viral infection, and plants became resistant to super-infection by TEV [68] . This resistance was associated with complete degradation of both RNA of CP and RNA of transgene. But the real proof that gene silencing is an important mechanism of plants protection against viruses became recovery that siRNAs accumulate in plants in high quantity during infection.",

Roignant et al. [74] proved that in organism of Drosophila there is no prop- agation of the process of silencing, and this mechanism is limited to the cells where it occurred. RNA silencing directed against endogenous and exogenous nucleotide sequences is very similar to the one that acts against exogenous pathogens. However the presence of mechanism of gene silencing of viral sequences is not still shown for insects. Nematodes. On the contrary to Drosophila the process of gene silencing in nematodes is mobile and can be spread over the whole organism [75] . Fire et al. showed that injections of dsRNAs into the body and germ glands of young specimen of C. elegans cause gene-specific interference in somatic tissues [76] . Genome C. elegans includes 2 genes RdRP, ego-1 and rrf-1, necessary for RNA silencing in embryos and somatic tissues [77, 78] . Recently it was shown that the majority of siRNAs formed under the process of gene silencing in nematodes included the secondary siR-NAs-i.e. thus, which were created from dsRNAs synthesized after the first round of silencing [79] . In nematodes RNA silencing plays a very important role while protection of genome from transposons [80] , hence the question whether this mechanism is used as antiviral defense is left open. Thus, it was shown that replication of Vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) was enhanced in nematodes, mutant in complex rde-4-rde-1. As well it was noted that development of the disease is increased in nematodes that had mutations in genes rrf-3 and eri-1-two negative regulators of interference. Lu et al. showed inability of Flock house virus to replicate in C. elegans species that had integrated transgene coding for full-length RNA of virus [81] . Antiviral response used the activity of RdRP and could be blocked by viral protein B2 [82] .",

Lecellier et al. first demonstrated that miRNA of mammals mir-32 terminates the accumulation of primate foamy virus (PFV-1) in human cells [84] . It was shown that cell lines that express viral protein Tas that interferes with mechanism of RNA silencing, accumulate high quantity of virus. Mutations in nucleotide sequence of abovementioned viral protein caused loss of virus an ability to replicate and accumulate in cells. It was proved that Tas is a non-specific blocker of gene silencing and that cells that do not express this suppressor have increased activity of miRNA mir32.

Hence, in response to protective reactions of organism, viruses use mechanisms that will permit them to overcome gene silencing. Mostly it is reached by synthesis of viral proteins, which are able to block certain stages of gene silencing process. Observation over the symptoms caused in plant by one virus or several non-related viruses brought understanding of features of suppression of gene silencing. Potyvirus Potato virus Y (PVY) significantly enhances replication of potato virus X (PVX) in mixed infection. This fact specifies that PVY has mechanism of suppression of protective reaction of the host. For today it is already known that the protein that is in charge of this effect is potyviral helper component protein kinase (HC-Pro) that was able to cause suppression of reporter gene of green fluorescent protein (GFP) in transgenic plants [88] . Further investigations showed that phenomenon of inhibition or suppression of gene silencing is a common feature for the majority plant viruses [89] . Proteins, which are in charge of this process in different viruses are absolutely different in their aminoacid sequence and structure, and are coded both by DNA and RNA viruses [90] . Probably it is connected to the presence of large amount of targets for these proteins. The mostly studied viral suppressor of gene silencing in plants is protein p19 that is expressed by representatives of genus Tombusvirus.",

            "text": "As the result of investigations it was shown that protein p19 of Odontoglossum ringspot virus (ORSV) was able to bind only to dsRNAs 21 bp in length with 3'-overhangs, i.e. such small RNAs that have all characteristics of siRNAs. Moreover, p19 of Tomato bushy stunt virus close-related to ORSV coimmunoprecipitated with siRNAs [91] . X-ray data of protein p19 determine that tombusviral suppressor identifies duplex of RNA independently of their nucleotide sequence and acts on the principle of claws that \"seize\" siRNA [92] . Thus, siRNAs are not unwound and are not bound to RISC. Approximately the same way acts suppressor of gene silencing B2-protein of Flock house virus, seizing and blocking of molecules of dsRNAs that are formed while replication of viral RNA [93] . Proteins NS1 of influenza virus and E3L of vaccinia virus are also suppressors of gene silencing and act by binding of dsRNAs [94] . For today an active search of different ways of obtaining of transgenic plants resistant to viruses is carried out. Thus RNA-induced resistance of potato plants to PVY by transformation of plants with gene of viral replicase NIb was obtained [95] . Plants of Nicotiana benthamiana showed high level of resistance to plum pox virus (PPV) after being transformed with NIb gene [96] . Transgenic clone of European plum was highly resistant to plum pox as a result of transformation with coat protein gene of PPV [97] . RNA silencing of sequence P1/HC-Pro in transgenic plants of plum caused resistance to plum pox [98] .",
