Since the outbreak of infection with avian infl uenza H5N1 virus in 2003, WHO has reported 277 laboratory confi rmed cases in ten countries with a mortality rate of about 60%. 1 So far the virus has spread only from animals to human beings. However, human-to-human transmission potentiated by viral genomic mutation and reassortment of genomic subunits could be imminent. Recently, the fi rst cases of probable human-to-human transmission have been reported. 2, 3 The H5N1 infl uenza A virus is a negative-stranded RNA virus in which the genome consists of eight segments encoding ten viral proteins including haemagglutinin, neuraminidase, polymerase proteins, and nucleoprotein. 4 Little is known about the specifi c eff ects in organs and cells targeted by the virus. The infection initially seemed to be restricted to the lungs, but later reports 5, 6 have suggested that infl uenza A H5N1 could disseminate beyond the lungs. For various reasons (eg, religion), full autopsies of H5N1-infected human cases can often not be obtained. Accordingly, only a few reports 2,5,7-9 have described histopathology and virus distribution in H5N1 cases. Studies using in-situ hybridisation to detect viral genomic sequences in target cells have not been reported thus far.",

On admission, she was lymphopenic, confused, and irritable, had bilateral infi ltration on chest radiograph, and substantially reduced oxygen saturation. She was placed on a ventilator and treated with antibiotics, corticosteroids (hydrocortisone 400 mg on day 6 and day 7, and methylprednisolone 160 mg on day 8 and 240 mg on day 9), and fl uids, but died 62 h after admission, 9 days after the onset of symptoms. No antiviral treatment was given. *Contributed equally to the study as fi rst authors Patient 2 was a 35-year-old Chinese man from China's Jiangxi province who had a 6-day history of fever and productive cough. He had participated in selling birds, of which several had died. On admission, chest radiographs showed evidence of pneumonia, and laboratory results showed abnormally increased hepatic-associated and cardiac-associated enzymes and lymphopenia. He was treated with antibiotics. Corticosteroids were given initially with methylprednisolone 40 mg on day 10 and then 120 mg per day for 17 days. Antiviral treatment was given, including rimantadine 100 mg twice daily on days 10 and 11 and then oseltamivir 150 mg per day from day 11 for 10 days. After admission, he became increasingly irritable and confused, followed by lowered consciousness. He developed respiratory failure and mechanical ventilation was initiated. In a sputum culture, several gram-positive microorganisms and Candida albicans were isolated. Antifungal drugs were added to his treatment. He developed multiple organ failure and died 27 days after the onset of symptoms.",

Two sense and two antisense RNA probes were prepared by in-vitro transcription with T7 and Sp6 RNA polymerase (Promega) in the presence of digoxigenin-UTP (Roche Diagnostics, Penzberg, Germany).

            "text": "In-situ hybridisation and immunohistochemistry detected viral sequences and antigens in lymphocytes in the lymph nodes, and fetal macrophages in the placenta. Circulating mononuclear cells in the fetus and macrophages in the liver were found to harbour viral sequences. Previous in-vitro experiments have shown infection of macrophages by H5N1, 27,28 and ex-vivo experiments have shown that the virus attaches to alveolar macrophages in human lung tissue. 29 In addition to viraemia, infected immune cells could also carry the virus to extrapulmonary organs, which has been thought to participate in the pathogenesis of SARS. 20 The virus localised to type II pneumocytes in the respiratory tract, which has also been reported previously. 5, 29, 30 However, with double labelling, we found viral sequences and antigens in both ciliated and non-ciliated epithelial cells of the trachea (fi gure 1C), contrasting with previous in-vivo and ex-vivo studies. 5, 29 In cultures of human tracheobronchial epithelial cells, H5N1 infl uenza viruses have been reported to infect mainly ciliated cells, which express mainly avian infl uenza virus receptors (\u03b1-2,3-linked sialic acids), although a limited number of non-ciliated cells (<20% of all infected cells) have also been reported to be infected. 31, 32 Some studies have detected only human infl uenza virus receptors (\u03b1-2,6-linked sialic acids) on non-ciliated cells, 32 whereas others also have found avian infl uenza virus receptors in these cells, albeit to a lesser extent. 31, 33 Changes in receptor-binding properties of A/Anhui/1/2005 and A/Jiangxi/1/2005 viruses could, in theory, also account for the infection of non-ciliated cells. However, preliminary tests have not revealed any substantial changes in the receptor-binding sites of either virus, compared with previous H5N1 isolates. 12 Notably, only a few scattered epithelial cells in the lungs were found to harbour the virus, contrasting with the severe and widespread histopathological changes in the lungs. Since this contrast was unexpected, lung tissue was sampled and analysed extensively, but the number of cells with viral localisation was consistently low in both patients. With the technique's very high detection sensitivity (close to 100%), the percentages of positive epithelial cells recorded in this study could be reasonable estimates of H5N1-infected cells. In view of the low number of infected cells in patient 1 and the absence of cells with positive signals after in-situ-hybridisation in patient 2, direct viral injury to the epithelial cells of the respiratory tract is, in our view, unlikely to cause such severe pathological changes. The lack of histopathological changes in the brain, despite our fi ndings indicating active viral replication in the region, also suggests that viral replication might not be specifi cally pathogenic. Recent in-vitro and in-vivo studies have indicated that hyperinduction of cytokines and chemokines could take part in the pathogenesis of H5N1 infl uenza. 5, 7, 8, 27, 28, 34 Despite the high number of infected cells in the fetal respiratory system, we saw no evidence of severe damage to the fetal lungs, which greatly contrasts with the extensive damage found in the adult lungs. The absence of severe pulmonary damage (ie, high numbers of infected cells) in the fetus probably indicated an immunological naive status, which would be expected to result in low concentrations of the cytokines or chemokines to which the fetal lung tissues were exposed, and thus reduce or eliminate their induction of tissue damage. This theory is supported by in-vitro experiments 27 showing that H5N1-infected neonatal macrophages express much lower amounts of chemokines than H5N1-infected adult macrophages.",

The relative number of infected cells in the fetal lungs, as detected by in-situ hybridisation and immunohistochemistry, was substantially higher than in the two adults, which could be explained by the dominance of avian-infl uenza-virus receptors over human-infl uenza-virus receptors in the bronchial and alveolar epithelia during the pseudoglandular stage of lung histiogenesis (up to the 20th gestational week). 41 Despite the long duration of the disease and antiviral treatment in patient 2, viral sequences and antigens were detected in the post-mortem tissues. This fi nding is diff erent from a previous study. 7 The delayed clearance of viral antigens and sequences could be due to the immunosuppressive eff ect of the high-dose corticosteroids with which the patient had been treated for a long period before death. Since viral cultures were not done on post-mortem tissues, whether the detection of antigens and sequences indicates active viral replication is unclear. Positive results with in-situ hybridisation and RT-PCR have been reported in patients with SARS who died late in the course of disease. 20, 35, 42 However, these positive RT-PCR results have been ascribed to the presence of small amounts of residual genome, rather than to active viral replication. 35 We have shown that the H5N1 virus spreads beyond the lungs, infecting both ciliated and non-ciliated epithelial cells of the trachea, the placenta, T lymphocytes in lymph nodes, and cerebral neurons. We also report evidence of transplacental transmission, resulting in infection of fetal organs.
