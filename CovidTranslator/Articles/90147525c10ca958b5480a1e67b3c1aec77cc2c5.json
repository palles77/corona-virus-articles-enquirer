The dose was chosen as sufficient for viral inactivation 1 , while retaining antibody 1,2 or enzyme functional activities 3 . Previous studies have indicated that viral RNA is highly sensitive to radiation and that viruses were by 2 Mrad 1 , even when cooled to minimize heat damage to proteins, whereas antigenicity of viral proteins and antibody binding titres were maintained after doses of 3.6 Mrad 1 or 5 Mrad 3 . Irradiated specimens were tested for infectivity by inoculation onto Vero E6 cells, and examined for cytopathogenic effects for 10 days, followed by blind passage of the cells and testing for the growth of SARS-CoV by PCR 4 .",

            "text": "Pelco International, Redding, CA). Images of SARS-CoV were digitised on a Nikon super coolscan 8000 ED scanner at a pixel size of 2.125\u00c5. Processing was carried out using the EMAN and SPIDER/WEB image processing program packages 5,6 on SGI Fuel and Tezro workstations (SGI, Mountainview, CA). Images were corrected for contrast transfer function (ctf) using the \"ctfit\" function in the EMAN software package 7 , which estimates defocus and corrects for ctf by phase-flipping. Images of the entire virus (n=140) were initially selected which consisted of population of spherical viruses, which represented the majority of the frozenhydrated SARS-CoV virions. These images were analysed using the \"cenalignint\" function of EMAN, based on this data the average lipid bilayer envelope diameter was determined to be 865\u00b144 \u00c5. This diameter was then applied in the subsequent procedure to circularly average the envelope. Data sets composed of the nucleocapsid-centred images were grouped into two data sets recorded at approximately 8\u00b5 defocus (n=582) and 5.5\u00b5 defocus (n=637), as determined in the contrast transfer function correction. The images were analysed using the SPIDER software package using a multireference 2D alignment. This process included a step in which the reference images were circularly averaged as part of the pre-treatment procedure based on the average virus envelope diameter which was previously determined. The data sets composed of images centred on spikes (n= 8386; recorded at 3.3-12.7\u00b5 defocus) were processed using the projection matching approach 8 which incorporated three-fold symmetry into the search function and reconstruction procedure. The population of spike images was composed of both side view projections as well as end-on projections, with the latter being easily identified in the images with greater defocus values. These high-defocus/end-on images were essential to eliminate the \"missing cone\" from the reconstruction. The resolution of the cryo-EM reconstruction was estimated by Fourier shell correlation to be 16\u00c5 using the 12\u03c3 criteria. The structures of the pre-fusion HR2 domain and the receptor binding domain were docked into the cryo-EM reconstruction using the \"colores\" function in the SITUS software package9 . The receptor binding domain atomic coordinates were extracted from the 2AJF.pdb 10 structure, these coordinates were then docked into the cryo-EM reconstruction. The resultant docking generated two distinct locations for the RBD (distal and proximal to the end of the spike). Each solution was then tested to see where the ACE-2 component (which was not used in the docking procedure) would be located. Any solutions in which the ACE-2 would lie within the mass of the spike were eliminated from the population of possible fits. The remaining fits were then compared to each other based on correlation and this indicated that the distal population had the higher correlation. Based on this the distal fit was considered best fit for the receptor binding domain. The docking of the entire 2FXP.pdb 11 structure was accomplished in a similar fashion also using SITUS with the exception that two functional considerations of the pre-fusion core had to be met for a docking to be considered meaningful. These were;firstly that the end of the HR2 pre-fusion core adjacent to the transmembrane domain had to point towards the viral envelope in the cryo-EM reconstruction, and secondly the symmetry axis of the 2FXP.pdb structure must lie on the same axis on the cryo-EM reconstruction.Structure Visualisation. Three-dimensional cryo-EM reconstructions, and the atomic resolution structures 2AJF.pdb and 2FXP.pdb and were visualised using UCSF Chimera (Computer Graphics Laboratory, University of California, San Francisco, supported by NIH P41 RR-01081)12 . Radial density shaded surface colours were produced using the Chimera extension available with EMAN 13 . The 1HA0.pdb 14 atomic structure was converted to an electron density map using EMAN. The spike component of the spikeviral envelope reconstruction was segmented from the entire reconstruction using the \"floodfill\" algorithm in the SITUS software package15 .",
