Associated with each movement there is a probability to transmit or contract infection dependent on the type of movement and the biosecurity of the interacting agents. The agent interactions are mediated by a theoretical truck, both in the case of feed deliveries, and of pig movements among producers or between a producer and a slaughter plant. The probability of infection for each type of interaction is calculated using an independent logistic equation multiplied by a seasonal adjustment. We model the logistic functions to reflect the fact that agents are less likely to become infected when more biosecurity measures are taken to prevent virus incursion. Because PEDv is a seasonal virus with highest infection risk in winter months, we add a seasonal adjustment that modulates the infection probability with time.

These four risk categories reflect risk attitudes observed from an online digital field experiment (data not shown). The participants' strategies ranged from risk averse strategies that allocated more preventative biosecurity during outbreaks to risk-tolerant attitudes that gamble with very little biosecurity investment. A third observed risk strategy category was noted in the digital field-experiment data and delineated by individuals who invested resources in biosecurity when there was a high risk of disease and invested little to none in biosecurity during low risk scenarios. We refer to this group as opportunistic, in contrast to a fourth category, risk neutral, categorized with participants that did not adjust their biosecurity investment behavior with regard to observed risk of infection. In the agent-based model, the risk attitude assignment is done by way of a risk-attitude distribution for each agent population that randomly assigns one of the four categories to each agent. The relative proportion of each risk attitude category in the distribution is set by the user. In this way, it is possible to create agent populations with different risk attitude characteristics. Concretely, we used this feature in our study to create scenarios where we varied the relative proportions of risk tolerant, risk neutral, risk opportunist and risk averse agents in the population of producers and tested the effect of risk attitude shifts in the disease incidence outcome.",

Specifically, we assume that the initial (i.e. before the onset of PEDv) agent's biosecurity is drawn from the same distribution regardless of their risk-attitude category. However, after the first simulated PEDv outbreak, the agents' risk attitude drives the decisions on whether or not to increase biosecurity and therefore modulates the biosecurity landscape in the production system affecting disease transmission probabilities.

The parameters , and are as described in Supplementary Table 2 and the parameter NI0 is the number of infected producers at the inflection point. The parameter values of the logistic function vary for each of the four possible risk attitude categories to which each farm agent is assigned (Supplementary Table 4 ). The rs parameter controls the relative distance among the probability curves (NI0 values) describing the biosecurity increase for four risk categories. For example, agents in the risk averse category increase biosecurity more promptly in response to disease presence than agents in the risk tolerant category, who instead probabilistically start to increase biosecurity at higher infection numbers (Supplementary Figure  4 ). In the model, the intention probability curves are converted to behavior by drawing a random value from a standard uniform distribution. If the random number is smaller than the probability of to increase biosecurity, the producer agent increases its biosecurity level by a fixed quantity; otherwise, the agent maintains its current biosecurity level. Table 4 . Parameters of the biosecurity increase logistic functions for each of the four risk categories (risk averse, risk opportunist, risk neutral, risk tolerant). These values were estimated with a calibration experiment matching observed and simulated PEDv incidence and kept fixed for the scenario experiment presented in this study. Figure 4 . Biosecurity increase logistic functions. The agent's probability to increase (or not) biosecurity is associated with the information about disease presence measured by the number of infected farms in the agent's veterinarian network. Once a week, the veterinarian agent communicates the disease information across its network of producers. In each communication event, a producer responds (or not) with an increase of biosecurity according to the logistic probability designed for the producer's risk attitude. The risk attitude influences the delay of response to the disease information as shown by the colored coded lines. With a relative shift parameter rs=0.09, risk averse producers have 50% chance of increasing biosecurity even when there is no infection in their veterinarian's network and their response reaches 99% at 5 infected farms. The 99% probability trigger for risk tolerant is 10 infected farms.",

Within each risk category, the biosecurity configuration at model startup had the following values (Supplementary Figure 3) : on a biosecurity scale from 0 to 8, 50% of agents had initial biosecurity = 0 (no biosecurity); 40% of agents had initial biosecurity=2.7 (low), 10% had initial biosecurity=5.3 (medium) and 0% had initial biosecurity=8 (high). This initial model configuration of biosecurity represents a situation in which most producers implement biosecurity on a low-to-moderate level before the simulated PEDv incursion. We made this assumption based on exchanges with veterinarian collaborators. The calibration converged on the set of parameter values shown in Supplementary Table 4 . The 136 OF scores ranged from 3.04 to 4.75. We decided to extract the parameter sets that had only slightly higher OF scores than the best fit (OF \u2264 3.19; ~ 50% of data, Supplementary Figure 5 ) to analyze the uniqueness of the best fit. We found a relationship among the parameter values of these sets meaning first that there are constraints among the human behavioral parameters necessary to fit the observed incidence data and second that a range of reasonably consistent human behavioral processes can give rise to the observed patterns. A Pearson correlation matrix (Supplementary Table 6 ), helps explain how these constraints interplay to create a decreasing trend in the PEDv incidence. If psychological distancing increases (higher relaxation rate in biosecurity), the disease incidence trend can only be negative when the producer agents respond to disease with shorter delay and higher biosecurity increase. If instead psychological distancing decreases, meaning that the level of biosecurity is generally maintained at all times, it is possible to reduce the output incidence even in the case when the agent producers act with some delay in their response to disease and they only increase biosecurity by little.",
