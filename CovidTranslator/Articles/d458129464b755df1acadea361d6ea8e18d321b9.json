This enzyme is involved in the first step of synthesis of the mannose 6-phosphate signal, which allows specific targeting of lysosomal acid hydrolase from the trans-Golgi network to lysosomes [2] [3] [4] . The lack of this enzyme precludes the generation of the common phosphomannosyl recognition marker of lysosomal enzymes 1, [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] . Consequently, newly synthesized lysosomal enzymes are secreted into the extracellular space rather than targeted to the lysosomes. Thus, affected lysosomes are secondarily deficient in most acid hydrolases 11) and are unable to degrade some macromolecules. In contrast, plasma levels of lysosomal hydrolases are high 12) . The resulting lysosomal storage, which was first reported in cultured fibroblasts 13, 14) , is seen as cytoplasmic inclusion bodies, particularly in mesenchymal cells, hence the term I-cell disease 12, 15) .",

            "text": "Several reports have described cases of ML II that expressed skeletal dysplasia prenatally 28, 29) . In Lachman's study 29) , the most common disorders associated with fetal skeletal dysplasia were osteogenesis imperfect (18%), thanatophoric dysplasia (14%), campomelic dysplasia (6%), and achondrogenesis type II (5%). In that report, 8 patients were diagnosed with ML II. Their sonographic findings showed short long bones, and 4 cases were detected during the second trimester. In the present case, prenatal ultrasonographic findings included rhizomelia in the upper extremities and micromelia in the lower extremities. Our patient exhibited severe skeletal changes from multiple frac tures, diffuse diaphyseal cloaking in the long bones, marked osteopenia, underossification of the calvarium, and resorption of the mandible with loss of the lamina dura. The distal metaphyses of long tubular bones showed irregular demineralization, which is seen in rickets. These signs suggest the presence of hyperparathyroidism, which was confirmed by the high levels of ALP and PTH. However, in contrast to neonatal severe primary hyperparathyroidism, her total Ca level was normal. These observations are consistent with severe secondary neonatal hyperparathyroidism. The etiology of severe secondary hyperparathyroidism in fetuses and newborns with ML II is uncertain. However, it is speculated that the enzyme-targeting defect in ML II involves trophoblasts and syncytiotrophoblasts in the placenta; this interferes with transplacental Ca transport and leads to Ca starvation of the fetus and activation of the parathyroid response to maintain extracellular Ca 18) . This hypothesis is supported by the findings of foamy vacuolar changes in trophoblasts and syncytiotrophoblasts in the present case.",

            "text": "GNPTAB, which is the only gene known to be associated with ML II, was first identified by Tiede et al. 30) in 2005. ML II correlates with an almost total absence of phosphotransferase activity resulting from homozygosity or compound heterozygosity due to frameshift or nonsense mutations in the GNPTAB gene. However, the presence of at least 1 hypomorph (a missense or splicing site mutation) allele in the GNPTAB mutant genotype results in a clinically milder form of ML III alpha/beta with a low level of phosphotransferase activity 3) . The same result was reported in a Korean study 26) . We performed a genetic study by direct sequencing of all coding exons and flanking intronic regions of GNPTAB. We identified compound heterozygosity in the GNPTAB gene: a combination of a nonsense mutation (c.3091C>T [p.Arg1031X]) and a frameshift by a small insertion or duplication (c.3456_3459dupCAAC [p.Ile1154GlnfsX3]). We confirmed the diagnosis as ML II because the hypomorph allele was not present. The nonsense mutation was inherited from the father, and the frameshift mutation was inherited from the mother. The c.3091C>T mutation has been noted in the literature 3) , but the c.3456_3459dupCAAC mutation is novel.",
