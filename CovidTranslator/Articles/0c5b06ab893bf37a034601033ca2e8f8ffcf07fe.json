This conserved multifunctional protein is also efficient in inducing NDV-specific antibody in chickens. Here, we localized a conserved B-cell immunodominant epitope (IDE) spanning residues 447 to 455 and successfully generated a recombinant NDV lacking the IDE by reverse genetics. Despite deletion of NP residues 443 to 460 encompassing the NP-IDE, the mutant NDV propagated in embryonated specific-pathogen-free chicken eggs to a level comparable to that of the parent virus. In addition, a B-cell epitope of the S2 glycoprotein of murine hepatitis virus (MHV) was inserted in-frame to replace the NP-IDE. Recombinant viruses properly expressing the introduced MHV epitope were successfully generated, demonstrating that the NP-IDE not only is dispensable for virus replication but also can be replaced by foreign sequences. Chickens immunized with the hybrid recombinants produced specific antibodies against the S2 glycoprotein of MHV and completely lacked antibodies directed against the NP-IDE. These marked-NDV recombinants, in conjunction with a diagnostic test, enable serological differentiation of vaccinated animals from infected animals and may be useful tools in ND eradication programs. The identification of a mutation-permissive region on the NP gene allows a rational approach to the insertion of protective epitopes and may be relevant for the design of NDV-based cross-protective marker vaccines.",

            "text": "The negative-strand RNA virus genome of Newcastle disease virus (NDV) contains six genes encoding six major structural proteins: nucleoprotein (NP), phosphoprotein (P), matrix protein (M), fusion protein (F), hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN), and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (L). The RNA together with NP, P, and L proteins forms the ribonucleoprotein complex (RNP), which serves as a template for RNA synthesis (15) . The NP together with the polymerase proteins, P and L, plays an eminent role in encapsidating the RNA. Moreover, NP regulates transcription and replication of the viral genome by interacting with P alone, with P and L, or with itself (NP-NP interaction). For Sendai paramyxovirus, it was shown that a conserved N-terminal region of NP was involved in NP-RNA and NP-NP interaction (5) , whereas the carboxyterminal domain was shown to be required for template function (8) . Most of the NP is thus absolutely essential for virus replication due to multifold engagement of NP in the assembly and biologic activity of the RNP. In addition, NPs of negativestrand RNA viruses are highly immunogenic in nature and have been used as antigens for diagnostic purposes, including the NP of rabies (12) , measles (34) , vesicular stomatitis virus (1) , and NDV (9) . NP-based immunoassays are used mainly to monitor vaccination programs and as a diagnostic test in differentiating between vaccinated and infected animals in conjunction with subunit vaccines (18) .",

            "text": "NDV is responsible for one of the most devastating diseases of poultry and has a substantial economic impact on the poultry industry. Vaccination of chickens, particularly those raised for commercial consumption, is carried out throughout the world. Although effective live or inactivated Newcastle disease (ND) vaccines are currently available, the virus remains an ongoing threat to commercial flocks. For continuation of successful international poultry trades, introduction of a systematic ND control measure is desirable. Recently intensive vaccination with marker vaccines and stamping-out strategies have been gaining popularity in veterinary medicine where eradication of specific diseases is of national or international interest (reviewed in reference 2). A marker vaccine is a vaccine that, in conjunction with a diagnostic test, enables serological differentiation of vaccinated animals from infected animals. An animal diagnosed as positive for the presence of a field infection has to be eliminated regardless of prior vaccination with a marker vaccine. A major drawback of all currently used wholevirus-based live and inactivated NDV vaccines is that vaccinated animals cannot be distinguished from infected animals with standard serological tests, such as hemagglutination inhibition (HI) or virus neutralization. Approaches to develop marker vaccines include deletion of one or more nonessential but immunogenic proteins. This is mainly applicable for large DNA viruses containing several dispensable genes (e.g., herpesviruses). An alternative approach for the development of a marker vaccine is the use of \"subunit vaccines.\" This approach has been implemented for many antigens involved in inducing protective immunity, including the two glycoproteins F and HN of NDV (4, 20, 31) . The disadvantage of most subunit vaccines is that they are less effective than whole-virus-based live vaccines, emphasizing the importance of an NDV marker vaccine based on live attenuated virus.",

Classical swine fever viruses lacking the E rns or E2 genes were successfully recovered in cells constitutively expressing the glycoprotein E rns or E2, respectively (32, 35) . For NDV, most vaccines are derived from low-virulence strains (lentogenic) that can only propagate in embryonated chicken eggs, where in trans complementation is very difficult. Another approach to generate live attenuated marker vaccines is generation of chimeric RNA viruses by replacing a whole immunogenic gene or part of a gene with a corresponding gene from another virus. This approach was employed for NDV by generating a recombinant NDV containing a hybrid HN protein. The chimeric HN is composed of only a one-fourth part of the HN protein from NDV, while the remaining part of the HN protein is derived from avian paramyxovirus type 2 or 4 (23) . Since F and HN surface glycoproteins are the major viral proteins responsible for the induction of protective antibodies, replacement of three-fourth of the HN protein might impair the full effectiveness of a live vaccine, particularly for commercial chickens possessing passive neutralizing antibodies.",

Interestingly, the NPspecific immunity alone is not protective against a lethal challenge (25, 33) , indicating that the immunogenic NP region(s) is dispensable for protection. To determine whether an immunogenic region of the NP is permissive for modification, we first localized a conserved B-cell immunodominant epitope (IDE) on the NP gene of NDV. A recombinant NDV lacking 18 residues encompassing the IDE was successfully generated by reverse genetics (reviewed in references 7 and 26), and this site was used to insert foreign epitopes from an unrelated virus. Chickens immunized with the hybrid viruses lacked antibodies directed against the IDE and produced antibodies specific for the introduced epitopes. We describe the properties of these recombinant viruses and discuss the potential use of such viruses for displaying foreign immunogenic epitope and development of marker NDV vaccines.",

In order to generate mutant NDVs, the plasmid pflNDV expressing the full-length antigenome RNA of the lentogenic ND vaccine strain Clone-30 (27) was used to introduce mutations. After localizing an IDE, the region containing the epitope was deleted using the \"quick change site-directed mutagenesis kit\" according to the supplier's instructions (Stratagene). First, a DNA fragment encompassing nucleotides 77 to 2289 of the NDV genome was prepared by digestion of pflNDV with MluI, filling Replacing an immunodominant epitope with a foreign epitope. In order to determine the possibility of replacing the identified NP-IDE by a foreign epitope, a well-characterized B-cell epitope of the S2 glycoprotein of murine hepatitis virus (MHV) was chosen (14, 16, 17, 30) . PCR mutagenesis was performed on the 2.2-kb MluI/ApaI subclone described above to replace (in-frame) NP amino acids 444 to 459 (nucleotide positions 1451 to 1499) with the MHV-A59 S2 glycoprotein sequence 846 SPLLGCIGSTCAEDGN 861 (MHV-1) or NP amino acids 444 to 455 (nucleotide positions 1451 to 1486) with the sequence 848 LL GCIGSTCA 857 (MHV-2) (Fig. 2) .

The deletion mutant NDV-\u232c18 on March 20, 2020 by guest http://jvi.asm.org/ also reached a similar peak titer of 10 log 10 EID50/ml, albeit 1 day later (Fig. 5) . A maximum difference of \u03f310-fold in the kinetics of replication between the deletion mutant and the parent virus, which was compensated upon further incubation, was observed at 2 days of infection. Taking the involvement of the NP in many viral functions into consideration, this slight delay in replication kinetics is not surprising. The two recombinants expressing the MHV epitope also had replication kinetics similar to that of NDV-\u232c18 for the first 2 days after infection. At 3 days of infection, both recombinants reached a maximum titer of only \u03f39 log 10 EID50/ml, which is \u03f310-fold lower than that of the parent virus or that of NDV-\u232c18 mutant (Fig. 5) . To determine the significance of the differences in growth kinetics, Friedman two-way analysis of variance was used for statistical analysis. No significant difference was found between the growth kinetics of the parent Clone-30 and the mutant NDV-\u232c18, whereas the differences between the parent virus and the two hybrid viruses expressing the MHV epitopes were significant (P \u03fd 0.05).

We first localized an IDE on the NP gene of NDV and successfully generated a recombinant virus lacking this region. In addition, by inserting heterologous epitopes into the NP-IDE region of NDV, we generated viruses that express foreign epitopes and efficiently induced antibodies against these epitopes.

A comparison of the deduced amino acid sequences of the NP of Clone-30 (27) with the corresponding sequences of the velogenic Texas GB (33) and the mesogenic Beaudette C strains of NDV reveals 100 and 99.3% identity. The NP of Texas GB expressed by recombinant vaccinia viruses could induce higher anti-NDV titers than birds inoculated with the live NDV La-Sota strain (33) . However, the strong anti-NDV response did not protect birds against lethal challenge with NDV Texas GB, demonstrating that anti-NP immunity is insufficient to provide protection (25, 33) . The amino acid sequence in the region comprising the identified IDE (amino acids 447 to 455) is 100% identical among so-far-sequenced NP genes of velogenic, mesogenic, and lentogenic strains of NDV, reinforcing the significance of this region as a robust diagnostic tool. Interestingly, it has been found that not all deletions in the region of the NP gene encompassing the IDE are permissible. Although a deletion of residues 443 to 460 of the NP gene led to the recovery of an infectious virus (NDV-\u232c18), we failed to recover infectious viruses from constructs possessing deletions of amino acids 444 to 455 (NDV-\u232c12) or 442 to 489 (NDV-\u232c48). Analysis of the protein secondary structure showed that amino acid positions 444 to 459 of the NP form an alpha helix, indicating that the amino acids constituting the IDE are incorporated into an alpha-helix peak. Removal of the complete helix in NDV-\u232c18 did not prevent the generation of infectious recombinant NDV, whereas removal of the partial helix structure in NDV-\u232c12 did not lead to the recovery of infectious NDV. This suggests that secondary structural constraints on the NP may influence virus viability. Failure to recover infectious virus from the construct with extensive deletion of 48 residues in NDV-\u232c48 might be due to the loss of important functional domains in addition to structural constraints. Indeed, the carboxy-terminal region of the NP of Sendai paramyxovirus was shown to be required for template function (8) . Whether the corresponding region of the NP of NDV possesses similar function remains to be elucidated.",

A well-characterized B-cell epitope of the S2 glycoprotein of MHV (17, 30) was used to replace the NP-IDE of NDV. The in-frame replacement of NP sequence (amino acids 444 to 459) with an equivalent number of MHV amino acids or replacement of 12 amino acids at positions 444 to 455 of the NP with 10 amino acids comprising the 5B19 MHV epitope resulted in genetically stable viruses. Analysis by a Western blot showed the presence of the 5B19 peptide fused within the NP protein. Moreover, as much as 70% of the mice immunized with the NDV expressing the MHV epitope were protected against MHV challenge. This change in function provides additional evidence that amino acids around 444 to 459 of the NP gene contribute to an immunodominant surface structure. Taken together, these results demonstrate that the antigenic sequence of the 5B19 MHV epitope is displayed on the NP and induces protective antibodies in mice against MHV. In a study using tobacco mosaic virus carrying similar MHV epitopes (13), 83% of the mice immunized by three subcutaneous injections or a repetitive intranasal immunization protocol were protected. Several viral systems, including hepatitis B virus, poliovirus, and influenza virus (reviewed in references 10, 22, and 28) have also been used as vectors to express foreign epitopes and induce protective immunity against unrelated pathogens. To our knowledge, this is the first example of a nonsegmented negative-strand RNA virus in which the NP is used to display a foreign peptide and may be an attractive strategy for generation of novel NDV-based vaccine vectors.",

For NDV, legislation to control outbreaks already exists in many countries. In some countries, eradication policies with compulsory elimination of infected birds are practiced. Due to the success in eradicating diseases like pseudorabies in many countries (2) , there is a growing interest in the introduction of marker NDV vaccines in conjunction with robust diagnostic tests. In this study all chickens vaccinated with NDV-\u232c18, NDV-MHV1, or NDV-MHV2 completely lacked antibodies directed against the deleted IDE as determined by 18-mer NP-peptide-based ELISA. In contrast, all sera from animals immunized with conventional live or inactivated vaccines were positive with the NP peptide ELISA, indicating 100% sensitivity and specificity of the test at least under laboratory conditions. The robustness of the diagnostic ELISA should be further confirmed with large-scale field trials, particularly in naturally infected flocks. Interestingly, as many as 90% of the chickens immunized with the recombinants displaying MHV epitope produced specific antibodies against the introduced 5B19 epitope. This property provides extra security in the diagnostic test and makes NDV-MHV1 and NDV-MHV2 viruses attractive dual marker candidates. An additional advantageous property of the whole-virus-based NPmarker vaccines is that they can be combined with other non-NDV vector vaccines expressing the F and/or HN proteins of NDV without affecting the marker diagnostic test based on the 18-mer NP-peptide ELISA. Recombinant vectors, such as herpesvirus of turkey (HVT) and fowlpox virus expressing NDV F and/or HN, have been successfully constructed and their safety and efficacy have been studied (4, 20, 31) . Although these vector vaccines are less effective in inducing local NDV-specific immunity and/or provide a delayed onset of protective immunity compared to that of live NDV vaccines (11, 21) , vectors like HVT are efficient in providing long-lasting immunity (29) . Administration of a combined NP-based live marker NDV vaccine with a vector vaccine, for instance HVT expressing F and/or HN, into day-old chickens will have an advantage in providing long-lasting local and systemic immunity and avoids the necessity of revaccination and repeated handling of chick-ens. At the same time, the marker aspect would remain unaffected.",
