The virus was distantly related (19.3%-23.7% aa identity) in the capsid precursor to other mammalian astroviruses within the Mamastrovirus genus. By using realtime reverse transcription PCR, with specifi c primers and probes and targeting a conserved stretch in open reading frame 1b, we found rabbit astrovirus in 10 (43%) of 23 samples from animals with enteric disease and in 25 (18%) of 139 samples from asymptomatic animals in Italy during 2005-2008. The mean and median titers in the positive animals were 10 2 \u00d7 and 10 3 \u00d7 greater, respectively, in the symptomatic animals than in the asymptomatic animals. These fi ndings support the idea that rabbit astroviruses should be included in the diagnostic algorithm of rabbit enteric disease and animal experiments to increase information obtained about their epidemiology and potential pathogenic role.",

The syndrome may be multifactorial with several microorganisms acting in synergy and with environmental factors also altering or infl uencing rabbit physiology, metabolism, and immune response. Within this miscellaneous group of enteric pathologies, some diseases appear to possess peculiar features, such as the epizootic rabbit enteropathy, enterotoxemia caused by Clostridium spiriforme and C. perfrigens (29) , C. diffi cile (30) infection, Tyzzer disease (caused by C. piliformis), mucoid enteropathy, Escherichia coli enteritis, and coccidiosis (31) .",

            "text": "Several viruses have been identifi ed from rabbits with diarrhea (20) is age restricted to the neonatal period (<2 weeks), although natural infection has been associated with disease in animals after weaning (28-45 days of age) (32) . Also, maternally derived immunity protects young rabbits up to 2 months of age and may infl uence the evolution of virus infection or disease. Accordingly, much additional work remains to elucidate the viral pathogenicity and immunology of most enteric viruses of rabbits. By EM observation, SRV-like viral particles have been seen sporadically in rabbits with EC/REC disease (20, 21) , but the exact nature of the observed SRVs, was not investigated. By using an AstV broadly reactive set of primers, we could detect AstV RNA in the intestinal contents of rabbits affected by EC/REC syndrome and the sequences obtained were used to generate more specifi c diagnostic tools. By rescreening the samples (collection A) with a RT-qPCR, AstV RNA was detected in 43.49% (10/23) of the samples tested. The mean titer in the AstVpositive samples from collection A was 4.3 \u00d7 10 6 GE/\u03bcL RNA extract, corresponding to \u22481.5 \u00d7 10 9 GE/mL feces. Notably, by EM observation, none of the AstV-positive samples was clearly found to contain SRV-like particles ( Table 1) . Immune EM that uses specifi c hyperimmune or convalescent-phase serum specimens could be necessary to improve the sensitivity of the EM technique. Also enzyme-or pH-mediated alterations in virus morphologic features could be triggered during conservation of samples and therefore hamper recognition of these SRVs. Overall, rabbit AstVs can be assumed to be easily undetected in EM-based surveys, thus leading to underestimation of the potential role of SRVs in rabbit EC/REC syndrome.",

However, the differences observed in rabbit AstV prevalence, and titers between the 2 sample collections are not necessarily suggestive of a pathogenic attitude or role for rabbit AstVs and must be interpreted with caution.

Notably, the 5\u2032 end of ORF2 appeared to be more conserved than the central region and the 3\u2032 end. AstVs contain a conserved region at the junction between ORF1b and ORF2 (26) . The exact role of this sequence is not known, but it may be a regulatory element of the subgenomic RNA that encodes for ORF2. This region appeared nearly completely conserved in the sequence of strain Nausika/08/ITA. Unlike the situation with other mammalian AstVs, but not unusually, the highly conserved motif SRGHAE at the C-terminus of the capsid protein (27) was not found. In addition, the stem-loop II-like motif (s2m) at the 3\u2032 end of the genome in the 3\u2032 nontranslated region (28) was not present in strain Nausika/08/ITA. This motif is present in most AstVs, with the exception of turkey AstV 2, human AstV MLB1, and rat AstV (36, 37) . This motif is also found in some coronaviruses and equine rhinovirus serotype 2.",
