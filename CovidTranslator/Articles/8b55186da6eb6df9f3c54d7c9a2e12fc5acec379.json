            "text": "Toxicologists, epidemiologists and risk experts study the physical perils one hazard at a time. But the cumulative load of modern threats may be creating an even greater risk that is largely overlooked: the risk that arises from misperceiving risks as higher or lower than they actually are. As a result of some of the decisions we make when we are fearful, some of the choices we make when we are not fearful enough, and because of the ways our bodies react to chronically elevated levels of stress, the hazards of risk misperception may be more significant than any of the individual risks about which we fret. So those who study risk in the name of promoting public health would do well to accept that our perceptions, irrational as they may seem, are real, although we live in a far safer world than just a few generations ago and many of the risks people worry about are small or non-existent. A more comprehensive risk analysis approach must recognize that these fears pose an actual danger that needs to be understood, accounted for in the analysis, and reduced every bit as much as the threat from any physical hazard. W hy are so many afraid of so much? Some observers suggest that our fears are a post-11 September 2001 phenomenon. This is too simple. It is certainly true that some of our worries have grown since then, and certainly new ones have arisen in the wake of the terrorist attacks. But when George Gray and I asked a wide variety of people what should be included in a book describing many of the risks that Americans most commonly worry about (Gray & Ropeik, 2002) , only one post-9/11 danger-bioweapons-made the list. The rest were hazards that people in many nations have been concerned about for years, many of which are byproducts of modern technology: pesticides, nuclear radiation, genetically modified foods, air pollution, water pollution and hazardous waste. The 9/11 attacks are too simple an explanation for our fretfulness.",

Vaccination has brought major diseases, such as polio and smallpox, under control. Water is safer to drink, air safer to breath.

            "text": "Advances in agriculture have made this a world of relative plenty, which many observers think is contributing to an almost global epidemic of obesity (Lambert, 2004 ) that kills hundreds of thousands per year and has helped to make cardiovascular disease the leading cause of death worldwide (WHO, 2003) . And individual products and technologies, from chlorofluorocarbons to mobile phones to commercial nuclear energy, have brought us both new benefits and new risks, and their hazardous aspects contribute to our widespread sense of worry. B eyond our industrial and technological power, we live in a time of unsurpassed information availability and immediacy. Never before have there been so many ways of finding out so much so quickly. In 1870, there were 489 general circulation newspapers in the USA. Today there are several thousand, 1,457 of which publish daily, according to Robert Giles, Curator of the Nieman Foundation for Journalism at Harvard University (Cambridge, MA, USA). And satellite communications and the widespread accessibility of the internet mean not only that we receive information immediately but also that an unprecedented number of us are empowered to disseminate it. Whenever something is discovered that is even possibly a peril, we learn of it, worldwide, within hours. Word of SARS spread far faster than the disease itself. Interestingly, although the universe of 'information voices' is larger than it has ever been, the ownership of those voices, aside from the world wide web, is in fewer hands than most of us realize, which also contributes to the sense that the world is a risky place. Just 22 owners of newspapers in the USA control papers that reach 70% of the total readers nationwide (Editor & Publisher, 2004) . Three-quarters of the television stations informing Americans are owned by only 6% of all media corporations (www.tvjobs.com). Public businesses, legally beholden to maximize profits, try to gain attention for their news and information outlets to increase readership and viewing figures. A common approach is to make risks sound as dramatic, threatening and urgent as possible. The result is a 24/7 drumbeat of drama and danger, contributing to what George Gerbner called 'the mean world syndrome'-the sense we have, based on a steady supply of frightening and threatening news, that the world is a riskier place than it actually is (Gerbner & Gross, 1976) . Although Gerbner coined the phrase to suggest that exposure to violent content in entertainment media increases the likelihood that viewers would engage in violent behaviour, many have adopted the phrase to emphasize that news media content also affects public attitudes and behaviour (Wilkinson & Fletcher, 1995) . B ut it is still insufficient to blame our industrial-technological-information age for our fears. Another fundamental component is more basic to human nature. For the past 25 years, scholars such as Gilbert White, Amos Tversky, Daniel Kahneman, Baruch Fischhoff and Paul Slovic have created an impressive amount of literature on risk perception. It finds, among other things, that humans appear to fear similar things, for similar reasons (Slovic, 2000) . The study of risk perception reveals that our responses to risks are not simply internal 'rational' risk analyses, but also intuitive 'affective' responses that apply our emotions, values and instincts as we try to judge danger. Risk perception helps to explain why our fears often do not match the facts. In more detail, risk perception research has found that there are several We sometimes fail to take adequate precautions against relatively larger risks that do not cause elevated concern science & society special issue S58 consistent characteristics of risk that form the basis of our perceptions (see sidebar).",

Other symptoms include fatigue, an increased likelihood of osteoporosis and type 2 diabetes, and aggravated clinical depression, accelerated ageing and even premature death (Sapolsky, 1998) .",

In other words, we adjust to the variable conditions in which we live and the stressors we continually face. But under what seems like a constant barrage of new threats and hazards, we sometimes do not completely adjust. We live under what is called allostatic load (McEwen et al, 2002) . And with a litany of new risks arising, and the new age of media availability and immediacy constantly sounding alarms about the 'fear du jour', allostatic load-chronically elevated levels of stress-is certainly the condition under which many of us are living.",

A poll by the US National Mental Health Association found that 85% of Americans believe that the USA will experience a terrorist attack in the near future. As many as 70% of respondents said that this gives them feelings of anger, 49% said they feel worried and 41% said they feel fear (Widmeyer Research & Polling, 2004) . A poll by Robert Blendon at the Harvard School of Public Health (Boston, MA, USA) found that one American in five is worried about getting mad cow disease, and one in six has stopped ordering beef at fast food restaurants (Blendon et al, 2004) . W hat can we do? We cannot roll back the technological and information ages in which we live. Furthermore, we cannot undo what appear to be deeply ingrained patterns of psychological responses to risks as identified by Slovic and others. The first, most important, step is to recognize and accept that our perceptions are real, and have real effects on our behaviour and our health, regardless of whether those perceptions are grounded in facts that are supported by natural science. It is vital for risk managers in government, and risk investigators in science and business, to accept that whether people are 'right' is not the issue. The issue is that their perceptions of risk are real, and the consequences of risk misperception are a hazard that, like any physical hazard, must be understood, quantified in terms of costs and benefits no less than the physical hazard in question, and reduced. This broader definition of risk will allow for the practical steps that can help reduce the hazards that may arise from misperception.",

That policy failed (fewer than 50,000 agreed to participate) because it asked people to take a risk-albeit a low one-in exchange for zero benefit.

Risk communication as commonly practised is often ineffective because it tries to make the recipient think and do what the communicator wants them to think and do. Risk communication is less helpful when it is a top-down monologue. It is also less effective when it fails to acknowledge and respect people's fears and the perception factors behind them, treating these feelings as irrational and curable with simply a clear explanation of the facts. Risk communication is more effective when it sets a more modest goal: to accept that feelings are an important and valid part of why people react to risks they way they do, and to provide information about any given risk based on the psychological and emotional factors involved, in language relevant to and respectful of people's feelings, so that audiences are more trusting of and receptive to the communicator's message.",

They must move beyond what some analysts do, which is to acknowledge, and lament, what Herbert Simon called 'bounded rationality'-the observation that heuristics and biases cause people to make suboptimal 'irrational' choicesand then go no further (Simon, 1957) . Valuation analysts have to develop scientific ways of quantifying the impacts of such choices, to the fullest extent possible. The US Food and Drug Administration has actually done this in a cost-benefit analysis of how to deal with problems with the quality of medical gloves. They figured out ways to quantify the effects of uncertainty and stress (Adler, 2003) . Much more needs to be done to create such methods. T here are many sciences that help us to understand risk. Classically, these include toxicology, biology, epidemiology, mathematics and economics. We must add to these the sciences of psychology, sociology, neurology and immunology. We must acknowledge that a significant component of risk is not the physical hazard itself, or how much of it we are exposed to, but how we perceive that hazard and exposure. We must accept what the Roman philosopher Epictetus said two millennia ago: \"Men are disturbed not by things, but by the view which they take of them.\"",
