Cell activation of CD4 positive hybridomas can be measured easily by determining lymphokine production (e.g., 1L-2). One possible disadvantage which is experienced in working with T cell hybridomas is their relative instability, a phenomenon which is common to hybridomas in general and is due to chromosome loss (Taussig, 1985) . Because hybridomas can be frozen and .thawed easily, this problem can be overcome by freezing multiple aliquots of cells.",

Each mouse received approximately 20-50 ~g of protein. 6 weeks after immunization, mice were killed to obtain the spleens. Spleen cells were incubated for 3-4 days at 2 X 10 6 cells/ml in Iscove's modification of Dulbecco's medium (Gibco) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Gibco, Breda, The Netherlands), penicillin (100 IU/ml), streptomycin (100 ~g/ml) and 2mercaptoethanol (2 x 10 -5 M) in the presence of M41 or FMDV-A10 Holland (1-4 p~g/ml). Subsequently, cells were washed and medium containing 1% of supernatant of Concanavalin Aactivated rat spleen cells was added (Kast et al., 1984) . 7 days later viable cells were isolated on a density gradient (Lympholyte M; Cederlane Laboratories, Hornby, Canada), washed and cultured with irradiated (2500 rad) syngeneic spleen ceils as APCs (107 cells/ml) and M41 or FMDV-A10 Holland (1-4/zg/ml) for another 3-4 days. This stimulation cycle was repeated and antigenspecific reactivity was determined. The IBVspecific T cell line and the FMDV-specific T cell line were fused on day 48 and day 26 of culture (fusion 4 and 5) respectively.",

To accomplish fusion (Fazekas de St.Groth and Scheidegger, 1980; Silva et al., 1983; Curling et al., 1988 ) the mixture of T cells and tumour ceils was incubated with 40% PEG 4000 (Merck 9727) at 37\u00b0C for 1 min. The PEG medium was diluted with 8 ml of medium which did not contain serum during the next 4 min. Then 6 ml of conditioned medium contain-ing 15% fetal calf serum (FCS, Boehringer, Mannheim) were added slowly over 1 min and the ceils were left to stabilize for 10 min at room temperature. Subsequently, cells were pelleted and resuspended in 10 ml conditioned medium. After fusion, cells were plated in flat-bottomed microtitration plates; 2-5x104 cells/well in 200 /xl HAT selection medium containing 15% FCS. On days 7, 10 and 13 of culture 50% of the HAT medium was renewed. Within 14-28 days, growth positive wells were scored and hybrid ceils were cultured in HT medium (without aminopterin). To ensure monoclonality antigen-specific hybridomas were subcloned by seeding 0.5 cell/well in fiat-bottomed microtitration plates in the presence of l0 s feeder cells/well. The feeder ceils consisted of either rat thymocytes or mouse spleen cells.",

The frequencies of specific hybridomas obtained after fusion 1, 2 and 3 were good, ranging from 62% to 86%. This was to be expected considering the monoclonal status of the parental T cell clones. The hybridomas A2bH and A2cH showed no differences in antigenspecific reactivity when compared to the parental clones: they recognized the 180-188 epitope of the 65 kDa heatshock protein of Mycobacterium tuberculosis within the context of MHC class II RT1.B. This indicated the presence of an identical T cell receptor on the surface of the immortalized T cell hybridoma. This finding was further substantiated by analysis of the reactivity of the hybridoma cell lines A2bH and A2cH to a set of PEPSCAN peptides covering the 180-188 sequence. The reactivity of both hybridomas was indistinguishable from the reactivity of the parent clones (Van Eden et al., 1989 ). Although we were not able to analyse the reactivity of the Zla and ZlaH cell lines at a peptide level, both cell lines showed the same antigen-specificity within the context of MHC class II RT1.B.",
