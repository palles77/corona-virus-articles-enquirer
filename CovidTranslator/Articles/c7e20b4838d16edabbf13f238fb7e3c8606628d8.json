            "text": "Cheetah populations are diminishing rapidly in their natural habitat. One reason for their decline is thought to be a high susceptibility to (infectious) diseases because cheetahs in zoos suffer from high disease-induced mortality. Data on the health status of free-ranging cheetahs are scarce, and little is known about their exposure and susceptibility to infectious diseases. We determined seroprevalences to nine key viruses (feline herpesvirus 1, feline calicivirus, feline parvovirus, feline coronavirus, canine distemper virus, feline immunodeficiency virus [FIV], puma lentivirus, feline leukemia virus, and rabies virus) in 68 free-ranging cheetahs on east-central Namibian farmland, 24 nonvaccinated Namibian captive cheetahs, and several other wild carnivore species and conducted necropsies of cheetahs and other wild carnivores. Eight of 11 other wild carnivores were seropositive for at least one of the viruses, including the first record of an FIV-like infection in a wild felid west of the Kalahari, the caracal (Felis caracal). Seroprevalences of the free-ranging cheetahs were below 5% for all nine viruses, which is significantly lower than seroprevalences in nonvaccinated captive cheetahs and those for five of seven viruses in previously studied free-ranging cheetahs from north-central Namibia (L. ). There was no clinical or pathological evidence of infectious diseases in living or dead cheetahs. The results suggest that while free-ranging wild carnivores may be a source of pathogens, the distribution of seroprevalences across studies mirrored local human population density and factors associated with human habitation, probably reflecting contact opportunities with (nonvaccinated) domestic and feral cats and dogs. They also suggest that Namibian cheetahs respond effectively to viral challenges, encouraging consistent and sustainable conservation efforts.",

The global cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus) population has diminished drastically during the last century (31) , yet the health status and disease susceptibility of cheetahs have been studied predominantly in captive cheetahs. Cheetahs kept in various breeding facilities and zoos can suffer from infectious and chronic degenerative diseases, with subsequent mortality (4, 11, 12, 15, 22, 40, 42, 49) . The high mortality from infectious diseases in captive cheetahs was suggested to be a consequence of a lack of genetic variability at the class I loci of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) in this species (44, 45, 67) , because the MHC class I genes encode peptides that mediate the immune response to viral infections (3) . These studies imply that free-ranging cheetahs should also show a high level of mortality from infectious diseases.",

Little is known about the exposure and susceptibility of this cheetah population to infectious diseases (41) . Lions (Panthera leo) and spotted hyenas (Crocuta crocuta), the cheetah's main competitors and predators (8) and potential sources of viral infections, are absent on Namibian farmland. Other carnivore species that do live on Namibian farmland and could potentially transmit viral diseases to cheetahs include leopards (Panthera pardus) and smaller wild carnivores as well as domestic or feral cats and dogs. Not all domestic cats and dogs on Namibian farms, and hardly any feral ones, are vaccinated. Because both cats and dogs can carry viral pathogens transferable to cheetahs (55) , free-ranging cheetahs that come into contact with nonvaccinated cats and dogs may become exposed to viral pathogens. The risk of cheetahs becoming infected with a virus is expected to be higher in areas with high human density, since in these areas contact with nonvaccinated cats and dogs is likely to be increased.",

We also screened sera of various carnivore species on Namibian farmland for antibodies against the same nine viruses.

If cats and dogs play an important role in the transmission of pathogens to cheetahs, then seroprevalences in free-ranging east-central cheetahs (our study) should be significantly lower than those in north-central cheetahs. For nonvaccinated captive cheetahs kept in the vicinity of farmhouses and lodges, we also expected a higher seroprevalence than that for free-ranging east-central cheetahs, because rates of contact with nonvaccinated cats and dogs are likely to be higher than those for free-ranging cheetahs and because pathogens are likely to accumulate in the enclosure and facilitate the infection of captive group members. . Juveniles were assessed to be between 1 and 2 years old. We additionally trapped, examined, and sampled four adult leopards, three adult caracals (Felis caracal), and one adult black-backed jackal (Canis mesomelas). The study area was located approximately 200 km south of the area where most free-ranging cheetahs of a previous study in north-central Namibia were investigated (41) . We further examined and sampled 24 adult cheetahs that were kept in large enclosures in their natural habitat on seven farms and lodges in central, southern, and northern Namibia. Seven of these captive cheetahs in three facilities were vaccinated against FHV, FCV, and FPV with a combined vaccine (FHV and FCV live, attenuated viruses and FPV inactivated virus; Pfizer, Sandton, Republic of South Africa) and against rabies virus (Merial South Africa Ltd., Halfway House, Republic of South Africa). For these cheetahs, only serology results for viruses that they were not vaccinated against were included in the analyses. Four free-ranging and one nonvaccinated captive cheetah were sampled and tested a second time, after periods of 1, 2, 2, 3, and 13 months, and one free-ranging cheetah was tested a total of three times, the initial time and after periods of 1.5 and 4.5 months.",

Since this was a lactating mother and one of her cubs, it is likely that the antibodies were transferred from the mother to the cub via maternal milk and were not the consequence of an infection with the virus.

It is unlikely that the difference in seroprevalence between the cheetahs of the two areas was due to differences in intraspecific contact rates, because cheetah densities are similar in the two areas (17) . Differences in interspecific contact rates with other wild carnivores are possible, but the densities of leopards are similar in the two areas (17) , and densities of other carnivores are also likely to be similar. FPV, FCoV, and CDV-for which some of the seven leopards, three caracals, and one jackal tested positive-can also be transmitted through contact with infected feces; thus, other carnivores may be potential infection sources for cheetahs via fecal-oral transmission (9, 37, 65) .",

            "text": "Are differences in seroprevalence between the cheetahs in the two areas likely to be a consequence of differences in test protocols, cutoff levels to determine positive results, or antigen strains in the two studies? The previous study investigating cheetahs in the area of higher human density (41) applied IFA and serum neutralization tests (1992-1993 and 1993-1998 , respectively) to detect FHV and FCV antibodies (this study used IFA), IFA and hemagglutination inhibition assays (1992-1993 and 1993-1998 , respectively) to detect FPV antibodies (this study used IFA), serum neutralization tests to detect CDV antibodies (this study used IFA), and Western blotting to detect FIV antibodies (this study used ELISA). Only FCoV antibodies and FeLV antigens were tested with the same tests in both studies (IFA and ELISA, respectively). Comparable cutoff levels were specified only for FCoV (titer of 1:25 in reference 13 of reference 41), and antigen strains used for antibody detection were mentioned for only two viruses. For CDV, the previous study used the Onderstepoort strain, the same strain used in this study, and for FIV, the Petaluma strain (46) was used, which differs from the strain used in this study. However, the use of different antigens and protocols is likely to lead to different results only if the investigated virus is highly variable in antigenicity (46, 62) , as is likely the case with FCV and FCoV (24, 50), but not if it is antigenically conserved, as is likely with FHV, FPV, and CDV (14, 21, 36) . Also, serum neutralization tests are more specific than IFA because in the former tests antibodies are detected only when they bind to relatively small areas on the viral surface, which results in the inhibition of infectivity (54) . In contrast, IFA detects antibodies directed to a broader array of epitopes on the viral surface. We concluded that the higher seroprevalences in northcentral than east-central Namibian cheetahs for FHV, FCV, FPV, and CDV are likely to reflect genuine differences in seroprevalence, because these viruses are conserved and/or their antibodies in north-central Namibian cheetahs were tested with the serum neutralization test. We therefore suggest that the significant difference in seroprevalences between the two study areas is a consequence of one or several biological causes that effectively change transmission opportunities for pathogens. We consider the likely difference in densities of nonvaccinated domestic and feral cats and dogs to be one factor likely to promote virus transmission to cheetahs. For CDV, the high seroprevalence of 24% between 1992 and 1998 in north-central Namibia (41) might also have been a consequence of a CDV pandemic in sub-Saharan Africa in the mid-1990s (1, 41, 52) .",

This is the first report, to our knowledge, of an FIV-like infection in a free-ranging felid in Namibia and suggests that an FIV-like infection was present in the area but was not detected with the FIV-ELISA protocol developed for domestic cats. It has previously been shown that the FIV transmembrane protein carries immunodominant epitopes which do not cross-react with those of lentiviruses of lions and pumas (6, 7) . The results for caracals suggest that it might be useful to apply PLV-ELISA to test nondomestic felids and that actual infections in the wild may remain undetected using the FIV-ELISA developed for domestic cats. Since the immunodeficiency virus is transmitted primarily through intense physical contact, such as biting, and since such contact between caracals and cheetahs can be assumed to be rare in the wild, it might be unlikely that this virus is transmitted from caracals to cheetahs. Nevertheless, it is important to continue testing free-ranging Namibian cheetahs with PLV-ELISA, since currently this population appears to be free of FIV and FIV-like infections and any change in seroprevalence should be detected as early as possible.",

            "text": "Exposure to rabies virus. The low neutralizing activity against rabies virus in the seven seropositive cheetahs, with titers of 0.5 IU/ml (threshold of positivity) and 4.2 IU/ml, is difficult to interpret, as the threshold for positivity is arbitrarily defined and specific reactions cannot be distinguished from unspecific reactions. The negative rabies virus antigen result for the brain sample of one of these seropositive animals indicates, however, that the viral load, if present, was low. All rabies virus-positive cheetahs lived for many months after blood sampling without expressing clinical signs of virulent rabies virus infection. This contrasts with the common perception that rabies virus is an aggressive pathogen, usually leading to death within a few days or weeks after incubation (53), but is consistent with studies on spotted hyenas (Crocuta crocuta) (10) and bats (Myotis myotis) (2) . In spotted hyenas, 50% of 37 seropositive animals survived for more than 4.4 years after blood sampling, and there was no association between longevity and exposure to the virus (10) . Similarly, in Myotis myotis bats, all 37 seropositive animals that were recaptured survived for at least 1 year and for up to 8 years, and mortality did not increase after episodes of viral infection (2) . Cheetahs in Namibia might become infected with the virus through bites by other carnivores. Consumption of rabies virus-infected prey species might be another possibility for interspecific transmission of rabies to cheetahs, because rabies virus regularly causes serious disease outbreaks among kudus in Namibia (30) , and kudus are a common prey of cheetahs (33, 64 Recently, a new explanation for increased susceptibility to infectious diseases in cheetahs kept in zoos was suggested. Captive cheetahs in North American zoos had higher fecal glucocorticoid concentrations and a larger adrenal corticomedullary ratio, indicative of chronic stress, than those of free-ranging Namibian cheetahs (59) , suggesting that a hormone-based suppression of the immune response may negatively affect health in captive cheetahs (59) . Free-ranging Namibian and captive North American cheetahs investigated in previous studies originated from the same gene pool (34) , and thus the development of diseases in cheetahs might be modulated by stress levels rather than genetic predisposition (56) . Since free-ranging and captive Namibian cheetahs have similar fecal corticoids (59, 60) and similar adrenal gland sizes, as measured by ultrasonography (61), glucocorticoid influences on viral infections should be similar under both study conditions, and these cheetahs should not be highly susceptible to infectious diseases, as was found in this study. These findings are in line with a previous study that demonstrated that free-ranging cheetah females reproduce well and that the low genetic variability of cheetahs is unlikely to negatively affect the reproductive performance of cheetah females (61) .",

Translocation of cheetahs is conducted regularly in Namibia, by authorized organizations, when farmers have trapped a cheetah and want to have it removed from their farm to decrease the chance of livestock being killed by it (35) . Translocated cheetahs on Namibian farmland are rarely monitored after release, and thus cheetahs that develop virulent infection after translocation are unlikely to be recorded. It seems reasonable to suggest that translocation from areas with high infection levels to areas with low infection levels should be avoided to avoid the risk of exposure for seronegative cheetahs. Also, translocation from areas with low infection levels to areas with high infection levels should be avoided because it might increase the risk of viral exposure for seronegative, na\u00efve cheetahs.",
