            "text": "a b s t r a c t NS5 is the largest and most conserved protein among the four dengue virus (DENV) serotypes. It has been the target of interest for antiviral drug development due to its major role in replication. NS5 consists of two domains, the N-terminal methyltransferase domain and C-terminal catalytic RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) domain. It is an unstable protein and is prone to inactivation upon prolonged incubation at room temperature, thus affecting the inhibitor screening assays. In the current study, we expressed and purified DENV RdRp alone in Esherichia coli (E. coli) cells. The N-terminally His-tagged construct of DENV RdRp was transformed into E. coli expression strain BL-21 (DE3) pLysS cells. Protein expression was induced with isopropyl-\u2424-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) at a final concentration of 0.4 mM. The induced cultures were then grown for 20 h at 18 \u2022 C and cells were harvested by centrifugation at 6000 x g for 15 min at 4 \u2022 C. The recombinant protein was purified using HisTrap affinity column (Ni-NTA) and then the sample was subjected to size exclusion chromatography, which successfully removed the degradation product obtained during the previous purification step. The in vitro polymerase activity of RdRp was successfully demonstrated using homopolymeric polycytidylic acid (poly(rC)) RNA template. This study describes the high level production of enzymatically active DENV RdRp protein which can be used to develop assays for testing large number of compounds in a high-throughput manner. RdRp has the de novo initiation activity and the in vitro polymerase assays for the protein provide a platform for highly robust and efficient antiviral compound screening systems.",

According to recent estimates, the global incidence of dengue infections has increased from 50 to 100 million to almost 400 million cases per year [1] . Despite the enormous efforts towards the development of dengue vaccine, there is still no licensed vaccine available. This is primarily due to the complex pathology of the disease and immune mediated responses against the four distinct serotypes [2] . Presently, many promising vaccine candidates are in pre-clinical and clinical development stages including live attenuated, inactivated, recombinant subunit, DNA, and viral vectored vaccines [3] . The development of therapies for DENV requires both an understanding of the viral life cycle and rational strategies for identifying antiviral inhibitors.",

Dengue virus contains an 11 kb positive-sense, single-stranded RNA genome. The genome consists of a single open reading frame which encodes three structural proteins (capsid C, pre-membrane/membrane (prM/M), and envelope (E) protein), and seven nonstructural proteins (NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, and NS5) [6] . The structural proteins form the viral particle and the non-structural proteins participate in the replication of the RNA genome, virion assembly and invasion of innate immune response [7] . NS5, with a molecular weight of around 104 kDa is the largest of dengue virus proteins containing 900 amino acids. NS5 is the most conserved protein of the dengue proteome as it shares a minimum of 67% amino acid sequence across all four dengue serotypes [8, 9] . NS5 is essential for RNA replication and performs enzymatic activities required for capping and synthesis of RNA genome of virus. It consists of two domains with distinct functions, the N-terminal methyl transferase (MTase) and the C-terminal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) catalytic domain [9, 10] . The tertiary structure of RdRp consists of palm, thumb and finger subdomains. The catalytic site contains conserved aspartic residues and coordinated magnesium cations and nucleotide incorporation occurs through two metal ion catalytic mechanism [9] .",

Recombinant NS5 full-length protein along with C-terminal domain alone have been shown to possess RdRp activity in-vitro, which was also evaluated in a study with NS5 protein of DENV-1 expressed in E. coli as a glutathione-S-transferase (GST) fusion. The in vitro demonstration of polymerase activity in recombinant NS5 protein has made it possible to study and identify the host and virus factors involved in the dengue virus genome replication [13, 14] . Flavivirus RdRp initiates the RNA synthesis via de novo initiation mechanism in which first nucleotide serves as a primer to provide the 3 -hydroxyl group which differs from a primer (an oligonucleotide, a protein linked to nucleotides, or intra-molecular self-priming) dependent mechanism used by other viruses, such as poliovirus and SARS-CoV [15, 16] .",

RdRp is an unstable protein and is prone to inactivation upon prolonged incubation at room temperature (RT) thereby affecting the inhibitor screening assays. It has been observed that addition of linker residues to the N-terminal end of the RdRp domain stabilizes the protein and enhances its de novo polymerase initiation activity and thermostability [18] . Mutation studies of the linker residues have indicated their importance for viral replication, consequently, accelerating the development of antivirals against dengue. The 74 kDa RdRp domain of DENV-2 has been expressed in E. coli and purified with a high quantity of the protein. It was observed that the protein was active with considerably similar enzymatic characteristics as its full-length counterpart [13] . Previous studies with NS5 RdRp of DENV-3 have described high quantity production of the protein with >95% purity, yielding 3 mg protein from 1 L of culture [9] . In the current study, expression and purification of the RdRp domain of DENV-2 NS5 protein from E. coli was carried out and the polymerase activity of the recombinant protein was successfully demonstrated using an in vitro transcribed RNA. Based on its multifunctional role in viral replication, NS5 has been identified as an interesting drug target for the development of therapies against dengue. The aim of this investigation was to demonstrate the in vitro polymerase activity of the purified recombinant RdRp (NS5) protein. This assay will provide a platform for screening and development of antiviral compounds specifically targeting the polymerase protein.",

We successfully expressed RdRp domain of NS5 protein in high expression strain of E. coli using cloned DNA fragments of dengue-2 virus [21] . It was observed that utilizing BL21 (DE3) pLysS cells for expression increased the overall yield of the protein. The protein was purified to homogeneity by successive chromatographic techniques, immobilized metal affinity chromatography and size exclusion chromatography. The two-step purification procedures helped get rid of the degradation product continuously obtained during initial expression and purification steps. Similar degradation products of \u223c35 kDa size have also been reported during studies with Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) and were later identified to be cleavage products of NS5 [22] . It was also observed that RdRp was very sensitive to temperature and a very short exposure to increased temperature lead to a decline in the polymerase activity. Previous studies regarding induced mutation within NS5 RdRp have shown improved thermostability of the protein [18] . It is essential to further optimize the screening procedure and efforts are being made in order to obtain a thermostable protein. In this study, a decline in the activity was observed when protein was incubated for longer than 60 min during in vitro RdRp assay. The reduction in the activity suggests that the reaction was completed within 60 min of incubation and the protein starts to degrade at longer time points. Therefore, all the subsequent optimization reactions were incubated for 60 min.",

These results indicated that the RdRp domain of DENV-2 NS5 protein alone was able to synthesize RNA de novo using homopolymeric poly(rC) RNA template without the help of other viral/cellular proteins, as previously indicated by studies with other flaviviruses such as DENV-1, Kunjin virus and Japanese encephalitis virus [14, 23, 22] . Previous studies have also reported polymerase activity of recombinant NS5 (RdRp) protein in the presence of poly(rC) RNA template [24, 13] . Therefore, optimization studies were carried out in the presence of poly(rC) RNA template in primer-independent setup. Literature suggests that DENV NS5 has the ability to initiate RNA synthesis in the presence of high concentrations of GTP which is the second nucleotide to be incorporated during negative sense RNA synthesis [25] . Structural studies with Bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) polymerase indicated the existence of GTP binding site in the polymerase and during de novo initiation GTP binds to the site serving as a primer by providing the 3 -OH for the formation of first phosphodiester bond [26] . These studies also indicated the importance of the use of poly(rC) RNA template during the in vitro polymerase assays.

Recent studies on enzymatic activities of NS5, coupled with structure-function and interaction studies reveal the multifunctional role of the protein in viral replication [17] . The high-level production and purification of recombinant versions of either the full-length NS5 or the two individual NS5 domains has also led to detail enzymatic studies on NS5 and the determination of structures of the two NS5 domains [10] . Research on flaviviruses has led to the characterization of an increasing number of virus-encoded proteins and enzymes, including envelope and capsid proteins, polymerases, helicases and proteases. Chemical libraries containing molecules of natural and synthetic origins can now be screened against these novel pathways and targets. This study provides an optimized method for the production of an active DENV RdRp (NS5) protein which will further help establish high-throughput compound screening assays directed against NS5. In future, mutation studies of NS5 protein can prove to be helpful in enhancing thermostability and de novo RNA polymerization activities of the protein.",
