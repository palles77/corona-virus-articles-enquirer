Inflammation may occur in response to trauma, chemical or physical injury, autoimmune responses and infectious agents, but also in response to physiological conditions, such as diet and exercise [1, 2] . Inflammation is an important component of innate immunity and necessary for priming adaptive immunity, but is also crucial for the effector phase of the immune response. Soluble mediators, such as chemokines, are shown to play an important role in driving the various components of inflammation, especially leukocyte influx. They may originate from plasma-derived systems, such as complement and kinins, from recruited or tissue-resident cells or released as a direct consequence of tissue damage [3, 4 ].",

            "text": "The chemokine system in mammals is complex and comprises around 50 ligands, which are constitutively expressed or induced by inflammatory stimuli, and 20 G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) or seven transmembrane receptors [5, 6] . In this article, the properties of C--C chemokine ligand 5 (CCL5), also known as regulated upon activation, normal T cell expressed and secreted (RANTES), one of the members of the mammalian chemokine system will be explored. Chemokines bind to their receptors which are expressed on many cell types, including leukocytes, endothelial cells, fibroblasts, epithelial, smooth muscle and parenchymal cells. The interaction between chemokines and their receptors is said to be promiscuous in the sense that several receptors interact with multiple ligands and several ligands interact with more than one receptor. It has been previously argued that this complexity of the system is important for the many actions of chemokine system but is not absolute. Some chemokine--chemokine receptor interactions are not functionally redundant and can potentially be targeted by drugs that block the receptor or interfere with the function of the ligand [5] . Chemokines play an important role in leukocyte biology, by controlling cell recruitment and activation in basal and in inflammatory circumstances. In addition, because chemokine receptors are expressed on other cell types, chemokines have multiple other roles, including angiogenesis, tissue and vascular remodeling, pathogen elimination, antigen presentation, leukocyte activation and survival, chronic inflammation, tissue repair/healing, fibrosis, embryogenesis and tumorigenesis [5, 7] .",

The most relevant known receptors for CCL5 are CCR1, CCR3 and CCR5 [6] . Figure 1 depicts the interactions of CCL5 with its receptors and also the other known chemokine ligands that bind to CCR1, CCR3 and CCR5. The affinity of CCL5 binding to its receptors is variable, with greater affinity for CCR5 and CCR1, and binding CCR3 with less affinity [41] . For the process of cell recruitment in vivo, CCL5 oligomers are immobilized on endothelial glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) and interact with the receptors expressed by incoming leukocytes in the blood vessels. Oligomerization is not essential for CCL5 activity in vitro, but has been demonstrated to be crucial for in vivo activity, as well as GAG binding [42] . CCL5 heterodimerization with CXCL4 enhances CCL5 biological functions [43] . For example, CXCL4 may amplify CCL5-dependent monocyte arrest on the endothelium [44] . In their turn, chemokine receptors are fully functional as monomers but also form homo or heterodimers, which allow for new properties such as receptor cointernalization, crossdesensitization and differential signaling [45] (Figure 1 ).",

The formation of the ligand--receptor complex causes a conformational change in the receptor that activates the subunits Ga i and Gbg of the G-protein, leading to an increase in levels of cyclic AMP, inositol triphosphate and intracellular calcium [7] . These signaling events cause cell polarization and translocation of NF-kB, which results in the increase of phagocytic ability, cell survival and transcription of proinflammatory genes, many of which are chemokines and chemokine receptors [10, 46] . CCL5 is also able to induce G protein-independent signaling. Once G protein-dependent signaling occurs, the CCL5-receptor complex is internalized via chlatrin-mediated endocytosis associated to the adapter molecules Adaptin-2 and b-arrestin. Cytoplasmic organelles and vacuoles are recruited to perform the recycling of receptors, and/or degradation of active chemokine--receptor complexes. These effects are important to regulate receptor levels at the external membrane, allowing for regulation of the cellular activity and reduction of extracellular levels of CCL5 and other chemokines, important to maintain homeostasis [47, 48 ].",

Separately, and certainly a hallmark on the studies of chemokines in viral infections, is the discovery that CCL5 and other chemokines were natural inhibitors of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. A few months after this discovery, in 1995, it was found that CCR5 was a coreceptor for HIV [56] . Interestingly, human subjects carrying a CCR5 gene variant with a 32 bp deletion in the coding region, named the CCR5D32 allele, are resistant to HIV infection and progression of disease. The deletion renders CCR5 defective, and results in impaired viral entry in macrophages, one of the target cells for HIV [57] . Thus, pharmacological blockade of CCR5 was employed as a strategy to treat and prevent HIV infections, resulting in a research boost on the chemokine system and in the development of several inhibitors and antagonists for CCR5 and its ligands [58] . The roles of CCL5 in the context of HIV infection include boosting of T cell responses [55] , and direct inhibition [59] or enhancement of infection [54] . Effects of CCL5 in HIV infection vary due to the concentration of CCL5 in situ, as low concentrations activate GPCRdependent pathways and high concentrations triggers CCL5 aggregation and subsequent G-protein-independent signaling events. GPCR activation by CCL5 inhibits HIV/ CCR5 interaction and suppresses HIV infection. Conversely, G protein-independent pathways do not involve CCL5 and [60] and contributes to eosinophilic inflammation in the airways, mediated by CCL5 and CCL11, which may aggravate chronic diseases such as asthma. For example, it has been shown that hantaviruses, which may cause life-threatening hemorrhagic or cardiopulmonary syndromes, induce CCL5 in vitro in several cell types and in infected patients [61] . Early CCL5 expression is commonly triggered by nonpathogenic hantaviruses, such as Prospect Hill virus, while pathogenic viruses evade immune detection and delay CCL5 production, which is the case for Hantaan virus. CCL5 is believed to play a role in the initial control of viral replication, which would prevent prolonged proinflammatory responses that likely contribute to disease pathogenesis [61] . RSV is a common etiologic agent of lower respiratory tract infection in infants, inducing obstructive lung diseases and bronchial asthma [62] . Children with RSV infections have increased CCL5 levels in airway secretions and CCL5 expression at the upper airway correlates positively with disease severity. Using a murine model of RSV infection, Culley et al. found that CCL5 expression occurs in two phases: the first as a consequence of the innate response by resident lung cells, and the second derived from CD4 + and CD8 + T cells. Treatment with Met-RANTES, a functional inhibitor of CCL5, at the second phase of CCL5 production reduced immunopathology, suggesting that CCL5 receptors play a central role in driving inflammation in RSV lung disease. However, chemokine blockade during the first phase showed opposite effects, which makes it difficult to anticipate what would be the effects of targeting this pathway in clinical studies [63] .",

In vitro infection of human alveolar macrophages with the H1N1 PR/8 strain showed a 234-fold increase in CCL5 mRNA expression [66] . Also, studies demonstrated that CCL5 is elevated in the lungs of H5N1-infected patients [67] . Interestingly, a comparative analysis of a seasonal Influenza strain and the H1N1 pandemic strain revealed that the pandemic strain induced greater levels of CCL3 and CCL5 in human macrophages. This was related to the ability of the pandemic strain to suppress SOCS-1 and RIG-I expression, which resulted in elevated chemokine levels that could contribute to the cytokine storm presented by severe flu patients [68] . To evaluate the role of CCL5 in influenza and paramyxovirus infections, Tyner et al. infected CCL5-and CCR5-deficient mice and demonstrated that the CCL5-CCR5 axis provided antiapoptotic signals to virus-infected macrophages. Usually, apoptosis of infected cells would be helpful for the host, but the enhanced apoptosis of infected macrophages deprived of CCL5-CCR5 signaling reduced the clearance of viruses and infected cell debris, which contributed to tissue damage. Thus, activation of CCR5 by CCL5 is important to extend macrophage survival and control infection [69] .",

CCL5 is induced in several models of viral CNS infection [70, 71] , and participates in the activation of microglia and in the recruitment of T lymphocytes and NK cells, that could either result in pathogenesis or viral clearance [72] . Astrocytes are able to secrete CCL5 when exposed to the dsRNA analogue poly I:C, but not when exposed to other PRR ligands [73] . CCL5 production by astrocytes was shown to contribute to pathogenesis in the infection by Borna disease virus, which does not cause neuronal death directly. In fact, neuronal degeneration was mediated by microglia, when activated by astrocyte-derived CCL5 [74] . In a murine model of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus, it is known that IFN-g-producing T CD4 + cells mediate pathogenesis in the CNS. Further investigation by Lin et al. demonstrated that IFN-g induced the production of CCL5 (and other proinflammatory chemokines) by microglia/macrophages, which enhances neuroinflammation and culminates in mice weight loss [75] . Rabies virus (RV) induces CCL5 production by microglia during replication, through p38-NFkB activation [76] . This induction is controlled by the protein N of RV pathogenic strains, which prevents RIG-I activation and further CCL5 production, leading to disease and lethality in infected mice [77] . In contrast, Zhao et al. infected mice with a genetically modified RV strain that overexpresses CCL5, for the purpose of vaccination, and found that this strain caused extensive neuroinflammation, culminating in neurological disease and mice death, thus confirming the major role that CCL5 play in leukocyte recruitment to the CNS [78] .",

The human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is particularly dedicated to control CCL5 biologic functions, as it encodes a micro-RNA that downregulates CCL5 expression [87] and a chemokine-binding protein that binds to CCL5 at picomolar rates and prevent interactions with host chemokine receptors [88] .

YFV infections have been successfully controlled through vaccination with an attenuated live strain, though a small percentage of vaccinees develop yellow fever. A study by Pulendran et al. described a unique YFV vaccine-associated viscerotropic disease patient, which presented persistent viremia; robust activation of T and B lymphocytes; and a 200-fold increase in the number of CD14 + CD16 + circulating monocytes. Those observations were associated to the genetic background of the patient, who was heterozygous for the -403 CCL5 and CCR532 gene variants, leading to the aberrant immune response to YFV vaccination [92] . Dengue virus (DENV) is closely related to YFV and causes a similar hemorrhagic fever, which emerged as a major world health problem in the past decades. Recent findings on dengue confirmed that DENV infection damages the liver, due to the elevation of serum transaminase levels in severe disease patients [93] . Histological analysis of liver sections from dengue fatal cases show lymphocytes, Kupfer cells and sinusoidal endothelium positively stained for CCL5, which correlates with increased hepatic CCL5 levels observed in acute dengue patients [94] . This increase in hepatic CCL5 due to DENV infection could mediate leukocyte recruitment to the organ and contribute to the systemic inflammation that culminates in the hemorrhagic phenomena. CCL5 production was also described in a dengue model in mice, where CCL5 levels were concomitant with liver injury. However, it is not known if CCL5 contributes to injury or is produced as a consequence of tissue damage in dengue [95] .",

CCL5 is necessary to control certain viral infection, including influenza, RSV, RV, HSV and WNV. The antiviral role of CCL5 is evident in HHV-8 and HCMV infections, where immune evasion mechanisms targeting CCL5 are essential and actively employed by these viruses. However, CCL5 seems to be deleterious in later phases of infection, where it contributes to excessive inflammation and tissue damage in all the diseases addressed in this section. Thus, conceptually, it would be ideal to block CCL5 in later phases of infection, where immunopathology is the main component of respiratory or neurotropic diseases, rather than the virus itself. The role of CCL5 in liver infections is not as clear, especially because beneficial or detrimental effects of CCL5 are dependent on the chemokine receptor engaged and whether the infection is chronic (viral hepatitis) or acute (YFV and DENV). However, CCL5-mediated inflammation is a common feature of these infections in later phases, which contributes to fibrosis or to hemorrhagic manifestations depending on the infection. Therefore, any potential blockade of CCL5 or its receptors in the context of viral infections could only be employed at the later stages of disease in order to prevent immunopathology. Earlier treatment could have deleterious effects on the capacity of the host to deal with the viral infection. As separating early (viral-mediated) and late (immune-mediated) phases of disease after viral infection may be very problematic in the clinical context, it is not likely Targeting CCL5 in inflammation Expert Opin. Ther. Targets (2013) 17(12) that strategies aimed at blocking CCL5 or its receptors may be useful in patients. The clear exception is HIV as in this case blockade of CCR5 is associated with decreased viral entry. Blocking CCL5 in the context of HIV is unlikely to achieve similar benefits.",

In a study by Souza et al., liver granulomas of chronically infected CCR5 --/-mice showed more cells and greater collagen deposition in comparison with WT mice, which was associated with higher levels of IL-5, IL-13, CCL3 and CCL5. Therefore, CCR5 abrogation was deleterious during experimental S. mansoni infection, due to enhanced fibrosis and granulomatous inflammation [96] . Among different consequences of S. mansoni infection, periportal fibrosis of the liver is a serious event that involves remodeling of the extracellular matrix and excessive deposition of collagen, primarily by hepatic stellate cells. Booth et al. demonstrated that a high TNF-a concentration in adult men was the single risk factor for S. mansoni-induced node size, but low TNF-a levels were not protective if the patient also expressed low CCL5 levels [97] . A comprehensive analysis of chemokine expression in a mouse model of S. mansoni infection showed that CCL5 levels were higher where the T h 1 response was enhanced, for example by administration of IL-12 in combination with egg antigen [98] . This study was in accordance with other reports stating that CCL5 was protective in S. mansoni infection, and suggested that high levels of CCL5 resulted in reduced granulomas. In addition, Chensue et al.'s study on pulmonary granulomas elicited with antigens of S. mansoni showed that CCL5 played different roles on granuloma formation. Specifically, CCL5 contributed to a T h 1-biased inflammation and limited the T h 2 response, analogous to the effect of IFN-g in the polarization of immune responses. These findings suggest that CCL5 is an important regulatory molecule that plays distinct roles in T h 1-and T h 2-driven inflammatory responses in schistosomiasis [99] .",

Despite sharing nearly identical receptor affinities, the specificity of CCL3 and CCL5 are well defined, and result in opposing activities regarding the clinical presentation of disease. CCL5 is evidently protective in schistosomiasis. The T h 2-biased immune response developed against helminthes is pathogenic, contributing to the generation and maintenance of granulomas. Thus, any potential pharmacological drug development should prioritize CCL5 activity through CCR5 in order to prevent immunopathology.

The expression of CCL5 is detected in atherosclerotic plaques and in monocyte/macrophages, and is regulated by the Rel proteins p50 and p65. Moreover, the Kruppel-like factor 13 (KLF13), originally designated RANTES factor of late activated T lymphocytes-1, has been recently identified as a new transcription factor that regulates the expression of CCL5 in CD4 + T cells [114] . In smooth muscle cells (SMCs), the expression of CCL5 is controlled by the transcriptional regulator Y-box binding protein-1 (YB-1) [115] . It has been shown that the overexpression of YB-1 in arterial SMCs greatly increased CCL5 transcriptional activity, eventually leading to CCL5-mediated monocyte recruitment. CCR1 and CCR5 are expressed on cell types that participate in atherosclerosis (i.e., monocytes/macrophages, T lymphocytes), and mediate CCL5-dependent arrest and transendothelial diapedesis, resulting in full transmigration into the inflamed tissue. These receptors have also been implicated in the detrimental effects caused by emigrated cells at atherosclerotic lesion sites [116] .",

Genetic ablation of ccr5 reduced the extent of atherosclerotic lesions induced by diet, and the late response, leading to a more stable plaque, reduced mononuclear infiltration and inducing a T h 1-biased immune response. In contrast, the lack of CCR1 enhanced atherosclerotic plaque development and exacerbated local accumulation of T cells [117] . In a model of arterial wire injury in ApoE --/-mice, CCR5 deficiency protected against neointima formation, which was attributed to an upregulation of IL-10 in neointimal SMCs. In this model, CCR1 deficiency did not affect neointimal area or cell accumulation, but led to an increase in IFN-g [113, 118] . Separately, knock-down of YB-1, which reduces CCL5 expression in carotid arteries, led to a significant reduction in neointima formation and macrophage accumulation after injury. The protection induced by YB-1 knockdown was not observed in Apoe --/--, CCR5 --/-or after treatment with Met-RANTES, indicating that the effects of CCL5 are dependent from CCR5 and CCR1 activation [115] . CCL5 is not only expressed within the atherosclerotic plaque, but platelets also represent an important source of CCL5 under pathological and nonpathological vascular conditions [119] . In mice, platelets have been shown to exacerbate atherogenesis through deposition of CCL5/CXCL4 heterodimers, triggering monocyte arrest on inflamed endothelium. Treatment with specific inhibitors of CCL5/CXCL4 interaction attenuates monocyte recruitment and reduces atherosclerosis without compromising other aspects of the immune response [120] . In accordance, curative treatment with [ 44 AANA 47 ]-RANTES, which disrupts CCL5 interactions with GAGs, limited atherosclerotic plaque formation and increased plaque stability in LDLr --/-mice, indicating the protective effect of CCL5 blockade in atherosclerosis [121] .",

CCL5 is expressed in a variety of cancer and metastatic processes, such as breast carcinoma [127] , melanoma [128] and papillary thyroid carcinoma [129] . For instance, chemokines expressed by malignant and stromal cells contribute to the extent and phenotype of the tumor-associated leukocytes, to angiogenesis and to the generation of the fibroblast stroma. In fact, CCL5 recruits monocyte and macrophage precursors to the tumor microenvironment and positively correlates with the extent of myeloid cell infiltrate and tumor progression [130] . Tumors that expressed low levels of CCL5 exhibited a decrease in growth rate in vivo, which is associated to a greater tumor-specific T cell response. Conversely, tumors expressing high levels of CCL5 induce a reduced T cell response and upregulates matrix metalloproteinase-9 transcripts, which contributes to angiogenesis. These observations indicate that tumor-derived CCL5 facilitate tumor growth by inhibiting T cell responses and enhancing angiogenesis [131] . Chemokines may also provide survival signals for malignant cells, since these cells gain functional chemokine receptors that may contribute to metastatic activity. Malignant cells acquire leukocyte-like properties and are able to respond to chemokine gradients at sites of metastasis [132] . CCL5 is secreted by senescent aged fibroblasts, induces proliferation of prostate epithelial cells and induces expression of genes related to angiogenesis [133] . The interaction between cancer and its local microenvironment can determine properties of growth and metastasis. Osteopontin promotes CCL5-mesenchymal stromal cell (MSC)-mediated breast cancer metastasis, by increasing MSC migration to metastatic sites in lung and liver, promoting tumor progression via the transformation of MSC into cancer-associated fibroblasts [134] . Collectively, these data suggested that CCL5 plays a central role in cancer progression, by affecting tumor directly and by controlling leukocyte recruitment and angiogenesis. Thus, therapies that block CCL5 or its receptors could potentially help the treatment of cancer and metastasis, given that its blockade reduces tumor angiogenesis and not the opposite.",

Met-RANTES blocked the effects of hematopoietic cellsderived CCL5 on cultured stellate cell, inhibiting migration, proliferation, chemokine secretion and collagen deposition. Importantly, in vivo administration of Met-RANTES ameliorated liver fibrosis in mice and was able to accelerate fibrosis regression, suggesting that CCL5-receptors blockade reduce inflammation and may be used to treat liver fibrosis [139] . Met-RANTES also diminished early infiltration and activation of mononuclear cells in kidney fibrosis and chronic allograft nephropathy, with an important reduction in the expression of TGFb and PDGF-B [140] . The sole blockade of CCR1, instead of CCR1/CCR5 blockade caused by Met-RANTES treatment, can also be employed to prevent chronic inflammation and tissue remodeling. CCR1 -/mice are more resistant to myocardial infarction, presenting reduced recruitment of proinflammatory cells early after the infarction, associated with increased tissue healing [141] . CCL5 has also been implicated in organ transplant rejection, in which CCL5 would mediate the recruitment of mononuclear cells that destroy the transplanted tissue and contributes to transplant dysfunction or loss. Treatment with BX471, a small-molecule antagonist of CCR1, prolonged allograft rejection in a heart transplant model in rats. This improvement in heart transplant survival was attributed to reduced endothelial damage, as CCR1 blockade reduced CCL5-mediated monocyte arrest on the transplanted heart endothelium [30] . In another study, BX 471 reduced the progression of chronic renal allograft damage, also through reduction of mononuclear cell recruitment to the renal tissue. Decreased numbers of mononuclear cells led to reductions in collagen deposition, TGFb1 levels and a-SMA+ interstitial myofibroblasts accumulation in the renal allograft [142] .",

These data are compounded by many preclinical studies showing the functional role of CCL5 and its receptors. Overall, there is good evidence that CCL5 has unique roles in driving recruitment of leukocytes, angiogenesis and fibrosis in various models of chronic inflammation. Therefore, blockade of CCL5 and its receptors may be useful in decreasing inflammatory cell influx and fibrosis in chronic diseases. Possible targets for CCL5-based drugs include chronic lung diseases, such as asthma and pulmonary fibrosis, liver fibrosis and atherosclerosis. There is also good evidence that CCL5 may play a role in driving angiogenesis and tumor growth, suggesting CCL5-based therapies may be useful as adjunct therapy of certain solid tumors. Moreover, there are good data suggesting that CCL5 plays relevant role in the immune response against certain infections, especially viral infections. This is against the notion that the chemokine system is redundant or promiscuous. There are clearly distinct roles played by chemokines and their receptors which could eventually be translated into novel therapies.",

            "text": "Genetic functional deficiency of CCR5 and blockade of CCR5 with antagonists are clearly beneficial in the context of HIV infection. The role of CCL5 and its receptors in the context of other viral diseases is much less clear. Whereas CCL5 may have host-protective effects in the early phases of viral infections, it may also contribute to disease pathogenesis by driving influx of cells which may damage tissues. This dual effect of CCL5 makes it difficult to target this chemokine in human diseases, as it is difficult to make clear distinction between phases where there is only viral replication or immunopathology. It may be argued that targeting CCL5 could be added to available antiviral drugs. This is indeed a possibility for drug development but faces the issue of timely recognition of the etiology of viral infections in the clinical setting. We are particularly interested in the role played by CCL5 in diseases caused by flaviviruses, the viruses that compose the Flavivirus genre. Infection with these pathogens can cause an intense inflammatory response, which may manifest as encephalitis or as a hemorrhagic fever, depending on viral tropism. CCL5 is a component of this intense inflammatory response and is likely to contribute to disease in later phases of infection. St. Louis encephalitis and dengue are examples of flaviviral infections in which the precise role of CCL5 still needs to be determined. Table 2 lists clinical trials which target CCL5 and its receptors in human diseases [143] . As can be seen, the majority of ongoing clinical trials involves antagonism of CCL5 receptors and not targeting of CCL5 itself. Therefore, the exact function of this chemokine in the context of human disease still remains to be determined. This is not a minor point as CCL5 may bind to multiple receptors and the targeted receptors may be activated by multiple chemokines (Figure 1 ). Clearly, nonredundant functions of any chemokine or receptor will be only uncovered when a particular molecule is targeted in humans. Antagonists, such as [ 44 ANAA 47 ]-RANTES, [E66A]-RANTES and MKEY (Table 1) , prevent binding of CCL5 to GAGs or its oligomerization. As these molecules compete directly with CCL5 for its functions and have a mechanism of action distinct from receptor antagonism, they may provide further insight into the biology of CCL5 in human diseases. However, to the best of our knowledge, these modified molecules have not been taken into humans yet. Only recently, an antibody which targets CCL5 (NovImmune SA, NI-0701, ",
