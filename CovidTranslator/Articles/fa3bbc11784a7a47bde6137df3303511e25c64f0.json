Here we report the expression of the 9-O-, and 7-O-acetylated disialoglycans of GD3 (CD60 b and CD60 c respectively) on human tonsillar lymphocytes. CD60 b and c are surface-expressed on activated germinal centre B cells and colocalize in raft-like structures on the cell surface together with the cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase Lyn and Syk. Addition of CD60 b and c mAb together with anti-IgM/IL-4 to in vitro cultivated tonsillar B cells resulted in a costimulatory effect. During spontaneous and staurosporine-induced apoptosis a distinct population of activated annexin V+/CD60 b+/CD60 c-B cells was observed. CD60 b and c are also found on cells of the extrafollicular T cell area. On tonsillar T cells, CD60 b mAb had a costimulatory effect together with PHA while CD60 c mAb alone was sufficient to induce proliferation. In further contrast to B cells, during apoptosis a distinct CD60 b+ T cell subpopulation was not observed. Together, surfaceexpressed CD60 b and c are differently expressed on tonsillar B and T cells and may be involved in the regulation of activation and apoptosis of lymphocytes in secondary lymphatic tissue.",

In general, GD3 gangliosides have been implicated with two major cellular events: 1) gangliosides drive lipid raft formation on lymphocyte surfaces in which key receptors triggering signal cascades are concentrated. In fact, it had been shown that TAG-1, a GPI-anchored neuronal cell adhesion molecule is located in a complex with GD3 and the Src family kinase Lyn within lipid rafts [16] . Whether O-acetylated variants of GD3 direct a different composition of rafts as compared to GD3 itself remains to be settled. 2) It became evident that CD95-or ceramide-initiated apoptosis cascade includes increased formation of intracellular GD3 which in turn induces mitochondrial permeability transition and cytochrome C release [17] . Thus intracellular GD3 propagates lipid-mediated apoptosis while 9-O-acetylation of GD3 suppresses its pro-apoptotic effect [18] .",

In order to exclude a possible pH-dependent shift of O-acetyl groups on cell surface expressed sialoglycans in particular during tissue and cell preparations we repeatedly incubated tonsillar B lymphocytes for 10 min in culture medium of various pH values (pH 7.3, 8.0, 9.0). In these experiments we could not observe a shift in binding of CD60 b and c mAb with regard to mean fluorescence intensity and percentage of stained live cells (data not shown). We therefore conclude that a shift of O-acetyl groups from C-7 to C-9 is at least unlikely to occur rapidly on cell surface-expressed CD60 b and c epitopes and that our immunostaining results with the CD60 mAb reflect the natural situation of cell surfaceexpressed 7-O-and 9-O-acetylated sialoglycans on tonsillar lymphocytes.",

This treatment abolished expression of all CD60 variants on B cells whereas on T cells expression of CD60 c was totally abolished and that of CD60 a and b was reduced.",

CD60 a was strongly expressed on cells within the T cell zone at the border region of the mantle zone and on scattered single cells within the germinal center ( Fig. 2a.4) . CD60 b was positive on cells in the T cell region, strongly positive on germinal center lymphocytes and (Fig. 2a.2) . The CD60 c mAb showed strong reactivity with cells of the T cell zone comparable with that of CD60 a mAb and staining of fewer germinal center lymphocytes in patchy formation as compared to CD60 b reactivity (Fig. 2a.3) . When freshly isolated live tonsillar CD19+ B lymphocytes were separated on a Percoll density gradient it became evident that CD60 a expression on these cells was weak to absent. CD60 b expression increased from high density to buoyant cells (Fig. 2b) . Since buoyant cells represent lymphoblasts it is concluded that expression of CD60 b and c increases during B cell activation. This observation was in accordance with the strong in vivo expression of CD60 b and c in germinal center lymphocytes.",

During in vitro cultivation a large proportion of the annexin V low/ CD19 high population shifted to stronger annexin V binding. Three color fluorescence of live (via probe (Fig. 4b) . When apoptosis was induced in freshly harvested tonsillar B cells by staurosporine over a period of 18 h a distinct apoptotic cell population with high CD60 b expression was observed (Fig. 4a) . Interestingly, this subpopulation was not seen in untreated annexinV/apo2.7 positive B cells. Stronger expression of CD60 b during the apoptotic process may therefore follow those events which are marked by annexin V binding and staining with mAb apo2.7. Only small changes in CD60 a and CD60 c surface expression on B cells were seen (Fig. 4a) . Thus it seems that both CD60 variants have different functions during the apoptotic process of tonsillar B cells. During apoptosis of tonsillar T cells a small population with increased CD60 c and slightly increased CD60 a expression appeared whereas no significant changes of CD60 b expression were visible after staurosporine treatment of CD3+ T cells (Fig. 4a) .",

CD60 b and even stronger CD60 c are expressed on cells within the extrafollicular T cell area and are markers for tonsillar T cells as shown on isolated CD3+ T cells. The extrafollicular T cell area is primarily colonized by CD4+>CD8+ lymphocytes and to a minor proportion by interdigitating dendritic cells, some macrophages and fewer B cells [32, 33] . With regard to CD60 a,b,c expression no major differences were seen between tonsillar CD4+ and CD8+ T cells (data not shown). Interestingly, in contrast to lymphocytes of the T cell zone, tonsillar B cells showed no significant surface expression of CD60 a as demonstrated by missing or weak mAb R24 reactivity and as observed both on native and in vitro cultivated tonsillar B cells. Spotted R24 staining in tonsillar immunohistology in germinal centers may be due to reactivity with T cells in this area. Thus it appears that in B cells mechanisms exist which regulate the controlled and almost exclusive transport of O-acetylated GD3 to the plasma membrane.",

Therefore it seems that also the density of surface expressed CD60 structures is differentially regulated in tonsillar B and T cells. In this study we could not clarify which intrinsic or exogenous factors regulate surface expression of CD60 b and c during the in vivo activation and differentiation process of tonsillar B cells.",

This again is in contrast to T cells where CD60 c mAb alone was able to provide a mitogenic signal for T cell proliferation, CD60 b mAb was costimulatory together with PHA. It should be noted that in our experiments CD60 a mAb R24 despite its strong staining of tonsillar T cells and in contrast to CD60 c mAb U5 gave no mitogenic signal but like CD60 b mAb MT6004 a costimulatory signal. Our experi-ments confirmed earlier observations that cell surfaceexpressed 9-O-acetyl-and 7-O-acetyl-GD3 variants are involved in activation of T lymphocytes derived from peripheral blood or synovial fluid [12, 13] .",

Such a band was earlier reported on other T cell preparations [8, 34] . In summary of these results we tentatively propose that on tonsillar B cells CD60 b and c carbohydrate moieties are exclusively expressed on gangliosides whereas on T cells a minor proportion may also be expressed on a distinct glycoprotein.",

            "text": "During apoptosis of B and T cells CD60 b and c were differently expressed. Apoptosis is a key regulator system of tonsillar lymphatic development by elimination of negatively selected germinal center B cells [35] . After in vitro staurosporine induction of apoptosis a distinct subpopulation of annexin V positive/Via negative B cells were highly positive for CD60 b but negative for CD60 c. The same was observed with in vitro cultivated B cells undergoing spontaneous apoptosis. How can these results be explained in view of the aforementioned observation that 9-O-acetylated GD3 (CD60 b) suppresses GD3 (CD60 a) induced mitochondrial permeability transduction thus preventing apoptosis [18] ? Recently it has been shown that CD60 b was induced in Jurkat cells after apoptosis induction with GD3 [36] . In our study we solely describe cell surface phenomena. It may well be that O-acetylated gangliosides fulfill different tasks at the cell surface and within the cell and that surface transport is differentially regulated for GD3 and O-acetylated variants thereof. In first experiments we could observe by flow cytometric analysis of antibody stainings that during staurosporine-induced apoptosis of tonsillar B lymphocytes the cytoplasmic amount of GD3 but not that of 9-O-acetyl-and 7-O-acetyl GD3 is increasing while surface expression of GD3 remains weak (unpublished results).",

            "text": "Since lipid raft plasma microdomains serve as platform for coordinated B cell receptor signaling [29, 30] and given the fact that glycolipids such as CD77/Gb3 on B cells [38] and GM1 and GD3 in neuronal cells [16] have been described as supportive elements for raft formation we investigated whether CD60 b and c gangliosides are present in rafts of tonsillar B cells. It became evident that CD60 b and c are constituents of raft-like structure on plasma membranes of B cells together with GM1 as demonstrated by CTB-binding. In T cells CD60 b appears together with GM1 in rafts whereas CD60 c shows a more homogenous plasma membrane expression. The coincidence of CD60 c surface distribution and mitogenic properties of CD60 c mAb in T cells is a phenomenon which deserves further investigation. It should be noted that mitogenic reagents as for instance PHA or pokeweed mitogen (PWM) lectins although possibly inducing raft formation themselves may not require T-or B-cell receptor enriched rafts for inducing signal transduction during activation. It may be that in T cells, CD60 c is linked to a different activation mechanism as compared to costimulatory signals transferred by CD60 b both in T and B cells and CD60 c in B cells. In corroboration of the contribution of CD60 b and c in B cell activation we found that both ganglioside structures are apparently in close physical proximity to Src family tyrosine kinases Syk and Lyn within raft surface domains of tonsillar B cells. Syk and Lyn play a dominant role in the signalling cascade during B cell activation [31] . Together, we postulate from our observations that CD60 b and c have a regulatory role in raft formation for coordinated receptor complexing during B cell activation and provide selection markers for germinal center apoptosis of B cells.",
