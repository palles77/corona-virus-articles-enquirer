Because of the enormous variations in viruses and in their epidemiology and pathogenesis, there is no single, magic-bullet approach to control. Each virus presents its own set of problems. As an example, influenza viruses are highly infectious and constitute a major causative agent for recurrent epidemics and pandemics. On average, approximately 10% of the world's population is infected by the virus annually, resulting in an estimated 250,000 deaths, hence posing a serious health threat (Rajasekaran et al., 2013) . Moreover, new and re-emerging infectious viral diseases are a rising global health threat, and the risk of spreading these viruses between continents and countries is even greater. HIV/AIDS, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic and MERS epidemic are only a few of many examples of emerging infectious diseases in the modern world (Morens and Fauci, 2013; WHO, 2015) .",

            "text": "Several preventive and therapeutic measures, including biosecurity, vaccination and antiviral drugs, are routinely used or tried to prevent and treat viral diseases. Vaccines are the basis of prevention of many viral infections; however, there are considerable drawbacks. Because vaccination requires regular monitoring to confirm matching between the vaccines and the circulating virus strains, time-consuming generation processes limit its availability. Failures of influenza vaccines have been widely documented, and in the elderly populationin which most mortality occurs-influenza vaccines are only approximately 50% effective (Reichert et al., 2012) . In the eventuality of a pandemic infection with a new strain, antiviral drugs also represent the first line of defense. Owing to their metabolic properties, viruses are difficult to control, and the limited availability, associated side effects, and rapid development of antiviral resistance have limited the usefulness of these drugs. Therefore, within this evolving environment, groundbreaking strategies and responses are required to reduce the economic and human health risks associated with viral diseases. The development of safe, effective and inexpensive antiviral drugs is among the top global priorities in drug development. Currently, there is a large and ever-expanding global population base that prefers the use of natural products for preventing and treating medical conditions (Gandhiraja et al., 2009 ) and many pharmaceutical companies are attempting to produce new antimicrobial formulations extracted from plants or herbs. Plants are an important sources of lead compounds; up to 40% of modern drugs are derived from plant material (Pan et al., 2013) . For the viral diseases, empirical evidence of the ethno-medical benefits of plants, coupled with bioassay-guided fractionation and isolation, has the potential to identify novel antiviral drugs.",

Angelica tenuissima Nakai belongs to the family Apiaceae and grows in certain areas in China and rocky slopes in the Korean peninsula (Ka et al., 2005) . It is widely used to treat headache, diarrhea, epilepsy and rheumatic arthralgias in traditional Oriental medicine (Nam et al., 2014) . However, the antiviral activity or immune-modulatory potential of the crude plant extract of Angelica tenuissima Nakai have not been reported in detail. Hence, we evaluated the antiviral activities of total aqueous extracts from this herb against a wide array of viruses in vitro. We also examined the effects of Angelica tenuissima Nakai on innate immune responses. In addition, we used highperformance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis to determine the active molecules present in the aqueous fraction. ",

The EC50 is the extract concentration that results in a 50% reduction in virus, and the extract concentration that results in 50% cell viability is the CC50. Because we primarily used GFP-fused viruses, a 50% reduction in GFP expression was considered equivalent to a 50% reduction in virus titer. In the case of EV-71, a 50% reduction in CPE was considered equivalent to a 50% reduction in virus titer. The aqueous extract of Angelica tenuissima Nakai inhibited the replication of VSV-GFP (MOI=0.2) and HSV-GFP (MOI=3.0) by 50% at an EC50 of 0.34\u00b10.04 \u03bcg/ml and 0.41\u00b10.12 \u03bcg/ml, respectively in HEK293T cells (Table 1 ).

In addition, the observed EC 50 values against Coxsackie-GFP (MOI=3.0) and EV-71 (MOI =0.5) were 0.31\u00b10.03 \u03bcg/ml and 0.24\u00b10.02 \u03bcg/ml, respectively, in HeLa cells. Given its effectiveness and convenience during the experiments, 1.0 \u03bcg/ml has been chosen as the optimal dose of Angelica tenuissima Nakai for further in vitro antiviral assays, observed from EC 50 values.",

To test this hypothesis, we first evaluated the levels of interferon-\u03b2 (IFN\u03b2) and the pro-inflammatory cytokines in the extract-treated cell supernatant of HEK293T or RAW264.7 cells (Fig. 3) . Angelica tenuissima Nakai (1.0 \u03bcg/ml [10 \u03bcl/ml or 1% v/v]) induced high levels of secreted IFN-\u03b2 and IL-6 in HEK293T cells (Fig. 3A) and TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, and IFN-\u03b2 in RAW264.7 cells at both 12 hpt and 24 hpt (Fig. 3B) . Importantly, the secreted cytokine amounts were significantly higher in HEK-293T cells, although the secreted level was not as high as the levels observed in the RAW264.7 cells in comparison with the non-treated groups. These results suggest that the aqueous extract of Angelica tenuissima Nakai can induce the secretion of IFNs and pro-inflammatory cytokines, which can stimulate the cellular antiviral state for inhibition of viral replication. Further, we checked the phosphorylation of interferon-related signal molecules or p65 molecule related to NF-kB activation to observe correlation of above results with the IFNinducing signaling pathway. For this study, immunoblot analyses were performed using whole-cell lysates of the Angelica tenuissima Nakai-treated (1.0 \u03bcg/ml [10 \u03bcl/ml or 1% v/v]) RAW264.7 cells. As shown in Fig. 3C , we found that the significant upregulation of type I interferon or NF-kB related signal molecules (IRF3, STAT1, TBK1, p65, and p38) in Angelica tenuissima Nakai-treated cells such as LPS-treated cells. Taken together, these results clearly indicate that the aqueous extract of Angelica tenuissima Nakai can induce the secretion of IFNs and pro-inflammatory cytokines through the activation of signal molecules in the type I IFN and NF-kB signaling pathway.",

As confirmed by real-time PCR assay, the mRNA expression levels of various antiviral and interferon stimulatory genes in the cells treated with Angelica tenuissima Nakai (1.0 \u03bcg/ml [10 \u03bcl/ml or 1% v/v]) were up-regulated to levels similar to those found with the IFN-\u03b2-treated positive controls (Fig. 4) . Also, to determine the transcription levels of various antiviral genes in the Angelica tenuissima Nakai-treated HEK293T cells (Fig. 4A) , an IFN-\u03b2 real-time PCR assay was performed from 0 to 24 hpt to monitor the time-dependent mRNA changes. Interestingly, the highest fold inductions of cellular transcriptional levels were observed at 12 hpt for all the tested primers (the primers are listed in Table 2 ). In HEK293T cells, upon treatment of Angelica tenuissima Nakai extract, transcriptional levels for IFN-\u03b2, Mx-1, GBP-1, TNF-\u03b1, IL-8, and IL-6 were up-regulated by 7.64-fold, 5.6-fold, 4.3-fold, 10.1-fold, 2.6-fold, and 6.9-fold, respectively (Fig. 4A) . Similarly, transcriptional activation patterns were also observed in the Angelica tenuissima Nakai-treated RAW264.7 cells. The results showed that the extract-treated cells displayed a nine-fold increase in the level of IFN-\u03b2 mRNA at 8 hpt and a thirteen-fold induction at 12 hpt compared with the untreated cells (Fig. 4B) . Hence, we performed a PCR assay for other genes of interest at 0, 8, and 12 hpt using specific primers (the primers are listed in Table 3 ) in RAW264.7 cells. We found that various antiviral gene tran-scriptional levels of were to be up-regulated by Angelica tenuissima Nakai at 8 hpt, including Mx1, OAS-16, PML, PKR, IL-6, ISG-20, and ISG-56, to levels that were 3.1-fold, 3.9fold, 5.4-fold, 6.5-fold, 8.2-fold, 3.2-fold, and 3.3-fold, respectively, higher than those of the control (Fig. 4B) .

And also, we detected the presence of IgA in BALF and SIF in all the tested samples. However, minor levels of IgA secretion were detected in all the samples from the PBS-treated mice (Fig. 6B) . These results indicate that oral inoculation of Angelica tenuissima Nakai extracts stimulate mucosal immune cells of small intestine and ultimately induce the strong inhibition of influenza virus replication in bronchoalveolar through the mucosal immune response system.",

            "text": "For the main component profile of the water extract of Angelica tenuissima Nakai, we used a HPLC system. A reversed-phase HPLC method was employed with a mobile phase of 1% formic acid (Solvent A) and acetonitrile (Solvent B) in the gradient mode as follows: 0-12 min, 0-20% B; 12-15 min, 20-50% B; 15-20 min, 50-58% B; 20-25 min, 58-100% B; and 25-30 min, 100-0% B. The flow rate was kept constant at 1.0 ml/min for the total run time, and 11 fractions were purified successfully. We then evaluated the antiviral effect of the identified fractions (FR-1 to FR-11) in RAW264.7 cells. Viral replication was monitored with PR8-GFP in response to pre-treatment of various fractions. An effective dose of 5.0 \u03bcg/ml was chosen on the basis of our preliminary experiments on the efficacy of purified fractions (data not shown). Interestingly, treatment with FR-5 markedly inhibited the virus replication (Fig. 7C) . Of 11 fractions, FR-5 was detected at a wavelength and retention time of 325 nm and 16.33 min, and the concentration of FR-5 in 6.0 mg/ml (w/v) of Angelica tenuissima Nakai extract was found to be 5.48 \u03bcg/ml ( Fig. 7A and B) . Ultimately, FR-5 was confirmed the ferulic acid by LC-Mass. The ferulic acidtreated cells displayed reduced GFP expression and reduced viral titers compared with the untreated cells. Ferulic acid treatment reduced the viral titers by nearly 5.2-fold against PR8-GFP at 24 hpi (Fig. 7C) . Furthermore, treatment with ferulic acid (5.0 \u03bcg/ml) markedly increased cytokine secretion in the RAW264.7 cells (Fig. 7D) . Therefore, our results strongly suggest that ferulic acid, a major constituent of Angelica tenuissima Nakai, might be able to induce the antiviral state in cells and subsequent inhibition of virus replication.",

            "text": "Historically, natural products and their derivatives have been invaluable sources of therapeutic agents. Recent technological advances, coupled with unrealized expectations of lead-generation strategies, have led to renewed interest in natural products in drug discovery (Koehn and Carter, 2005) . Plants have a long evolutionary history of developing resistance against viruses and have increasingly drawn attention as potential sources of antiviral drugs. For instance, many plant extracts and compounds of plant origin have been shown to have activity against influenza viruses (Park, 2003; Koehn and Carter, 2005) . At present, plant and herb resources are unlimited, have provided mankind with remedies for many infectious diseases and continue to play a major role in primary health care as therapeutic remedies in developing countries. Here, we evaluated the antiviral activity of Angelica tenuissima Nakai in vitro and in vivo. Despite the known biological properties of the plant, no study has been conducted on the antiviral activity and the underlying mechanism of action. First, we found that the total aqueous extract of Angelica tenuissima Nakai displayed a broad spectrum of antiviral properties in vitro. This herb has been used for a variety of purposes for a long time, and no adverse effects of its use have been reported. Notably, Angelica tenuissima Nakai did not show any significant cytotoxic effect on the tested cell lines. Its cell cytotoxic concentration (CC 50 ) was several magnitudes higher than the effective concentration (EC 50 ) of the tested viruses, and the SIs of the herb for various viruses indicate a higher safety margin of the extract for therapeutic or prophylactic purposes (Table 1 ). In examining the in vitro antiviral activity, we determined that Angelica tenuissima Nakai inhibited the replication of influenza (Fig. 2C) , VSV (Figs. 1A and 2A) , HSV (Fig. 1B) , Coxsackie (Fig. 1C) and EV-71 (Fig. 1D ) viruses in immune (RAW264.7) and epithelial (HEK293T and HeLa) cells. Upon viral infection, host cells initially recognize an infection and quickly evoke antiviral innate immune responses, including secretion of Type I IFNs and pro-inflammatory cytokines (Takeuchi and Akira, 2007) . Secreted IFNs and cytokines induce an antiviral state, which is important to protect the host cells against invading viruses (Tenoever et al., 2007) . Induction of an antiviral state at an early stage of virus infection is critical to control the spread and pathogenesis of viruses (Boasso, 2013) by specific agents could be effective approaches for limiting viral infection (Jackson, 2012; Perlman, 2012) . Likewise, we hypothesized that Angelica tenuissima Nakai induces an antiviral state via the induction of type I interferons and proinflammatory cytokines, and we determined the induction of antiviral, IFN-stimulated genes (Fig. 4 ) and the secretion of IFN-\u03b2 and IL-6 ( Fig. 3) by Angelica tenuissima Nakai in vitro. To elucidate the features in antiviral signaling, we also evaluated the effect of Angelica tenuissima Nakai on the phosphorylation of IRF-3, p65, TBK1, STAT1, ERK, and p38, which are key signaling molecules in the type I IFN and NF-\u03baB signaling pathways. Upon stimulation of the pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) or unknown receptors of the host cell by foreign materials containing pathogens or diverse ligands, downstream signal transduction is activated, including the activation of adaptor signal molecules or transcriptional factors, and can initiate the induction of Type I IFNs and pro-inflammatory cytokines to up-regulate the antiviral status of the host cell (Mogensen, 2009) . In this study, we found that Angelica tenuissima Nakai extracts treatment can induce the phosphorylation of IRF-3, STAT1, and TBK1 in a time-dependent manner, providing evidence of downstream signal transduction in the type I IFN signaling pathway (Fig.  3C) . Additionally, the activation of NF-\u03baB (p65, p38), which leads to a strong secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines, was also observed (Fig. 3C ). This phosphorylation could lead to the rapid production of Type I IFNs and various inflammatory cytokines that play a crucial role in stimulating the antiviral state and the subsequent clearance of viruses (Price et al., 2000) .",

            "text": "Oral administration of Angelica tenuissima Nakai extracts not only increased the survival rate of mice subjected to lethal challenges with divergent influenza A subtypes, including H1N1, H5N2, H7N3, and H9N2, but also led to rapid weight recovery (Fig. 5 ). Mice treated with the abstract initially displayed little weight reduction; ultimately, the majority did not lose more than 25% of their body weight. By contrast, all of the mice in the control groups displayed weight loss of more than 25% within 7 dpi and were humanely killed. Influenza virus causes a rapid reduction in the body weight of infected mice; hence, 25% body weight loss is considered the humane end point for sacrificing influenza virus-infected mice . In addition, lung virus titration (Fig.  5E ) correlated with survival, and the extract-treated mice displayed reduced lung viral titers, suggesting that Angelica tenuissima Nakai is sufficiently potent to inhibit viral replication and promote the survival of mice against lethal infections of diverse influenza A viruses. To support the antiviral effects of Angelica tenuissima Nakai in vivo, we observed the immune status in BALF of Angelica tenuissima Nakai inoculated BALB/c Mice. As shown in Fig.  6 , after inoculation with Angelica tenuissima Nakai extracts into mice, we could detect significant level of IL-6 and IFN-\u03bb in BALF. Previous literature has indicated that elevated levels of serum IL-6 correlate with induction of the antiviral state and therefore play an important role in the inhibition of virus replication (Spellberg and Edwards, 2001; Melchjorsen et al., 2003) . And IFN-\u03bb which is an exciting new chapter in the field of IFN research, is also able to activate the same intracellular signaling pathway and many of the same biological activities as those displayed by Type I IFNs, including antiviral activity, in a wide variety of target cells (Lazear et al., 2015) . Moreover, we also found significant level of secreted IgA (SIgA) in BALF and SIF, after inoculation with Angelica tenuissima Nakai extracts. Secretory IgA (SIgA) is the most abundant immunoglobulin in body secretions, including saliva, tears, colostrum and gastrointestinal secretions, and is the main effector of the mucosal immune system, providing an important first line of defense against most pathogens that invade the body at the mucosal surfaces (Woof and Mestecky, 2005; Mantis et al., 2011) . Thus, significant level of IL-6, IFN-\u03bb or SIgA which induced in BALF by Angelica tenuissima Nakai extracts, maybe correlate with the higher survival rates observed in the BALB/c mice against divergent influenza A infection. Macrophages have been widely used in drug development because of their significant role in the immune system, especially in antiviral responses (Wilden et al., 2011; Kim et al., 2013) . Here, we used murine macrophages (RAW264.7) to evaluate the antiviral effect of Angelica tenuissima Nakai in vitro. In addition, we used epithelial cells such as HEK293T and HeLa, which are very susceptible to viral replication. It was recently reported that HEK293T (Graham et al., 2014) and HeLa (Kolli et al., 2013) cells have fewer PRRs than Tolllike receptors (TLRs). This finding means that an aqueous extract of Angelica tenuissima Nakai may contain active components that can bind or penetrate the cell membrane. Those active components may stimulate the cell surface PRRs, cytoplasmic PRRs, or both, and ultimately induce antiviral immune responses in immune or epithelial cells. Surely, we tested Angelica tenuissima Nakai for endotoxin contamination using a limulus amebocyte lysate (LAL) assay and found that it was not contaminated with endotoxin (data not shown). There have been phytochemical reports on various types of compounds from Angelica tenuissima Nakai, including phthalides, coumarins, terpenoids, and phenylpropanoids (Islam et al., 2009; Nam et al., 2014) . Some of these compounds were found to have diverse biological activities, such as antioxidative (Ka et al., 2005) , anticancer (Park et al., 2011) , angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory (Liang et al., 2011) and antifungal effects . To confirm these reports, we conducted HPLC analysis to identify the active compounds present in the total aqueous fraction. We observed 11 major peaks (Fig. 7A) , and 11 fractions (FR-1 to FR-11) were successfully purified. Of the 11 fractions, FR-5 was identified as having significant antiviral properties, like those displayed by Angelica tenuissima Nakai; FR-5 was later confirmed to be ferulic acid (Fig. 7A) . Here, we newly defined the antiviral effects of ferulic acid via Type I IFN stimulation. Thus, the antiviral and immunomodulatory effects of an aqueous extract of Angelica tenuissima Nakai might be due to a cumulative effect of ferulic acid including with other fractions or other unknown active compounds present in the extract. The relationship between the mechanisms of the antiviral effects and active compounds, including ferulic acid, should be studied further.",

The aqueous extract of Angelica tenuissima Nakai inhibit the diverse viral infection through the induction of Type I IFN signaling and pro-inflammatory cytokines, leading to an antiviral state in epithelial and immune cells. The aqueous extract of Angelica tenuissima Nakai can reduce influenza-induced mortality by disrupting viral replication or preventing viral infection by creating an antiviral state in in vivo (lungs). Given the antiviral activities, Angelica tenuissima Nakai extracts or its components, including ferulic acid may be used as a preventive or therapeutic agent to limit viral replication which have been caused a serious damage to human or livestocks. Furthermore, Angelica tenuissima Nakai may also be used as a target for drug design to prevent the viral infection through the innate immune responses.",
