            "text": "Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic autoimmune demyelinating disorder of the central nervous system (CNS) with unknown etiology. Several studies have shown that demyelination in MS is caused by proinflammatory mediators and nitric oxide (NO), which is released by perivascular infiltrates and/or activated glial cells. Both endogenous NO released by microglia and astrocytes; and NO generated from exogenous NO donors are known to induce oligodendrocytes death. However, the molecular mechanism of oligodendroglial death is poorly understood. Here we explore the role of NO in modulating the expression of myelin-specific genes that leads to oligodendroglial death. We investigated the effect of NO on the expression of myelin basic protein (MBP), 2',3'-cyclic nucleotide 3'-phosphodiesterase (CNPase), myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG), and proteolipid protein (PLP) in human primary oligodendrocytes. Combination of IFN-and bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or double stranded RNA in the form of polyIC induced the production of NO and decreased the expression of myelin gene in human fetal mixed glial cultures. Either a scavenger of NO (PTIO) or an inhibitor of inducible nitric oxide synthase (L-NIL) abrogated (LPS+IFN-)-and polyIC-mediated suppression of myelin genes in human mixed glial cells. The role of NO was further corroborated by the inhibition of myelin gene expression in purified human oligodendroglia by several NO donors including SNP, NOC-7, SIN-1, and SNAP. This study illustrates a novel biological role of NO in down-regulating the expression of myelin genes preceding the death of oligodendrocytes.",

            "text": "Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a demyelinating disease of the central nervous system (CNS) in which myelin sheaths and the myelin producing cells, oligodendrocytes, are destroyed. From a clinical standpoint, MS symptoms are diverse, ranging from tremor, nystagmus, paralysis, and disturbances in speech and vision; it occurs primarily in early adult life with characteristic exacerbations and remissions [1] . Pathologically, it is identified by the presence of diffuse, discrete demyelinated areas, called plaques. Although the etiology of MS is not completely understood, studies of MS patients suggest that the observed demyelination in the CNS is a result of an autoimmune inflammation [1] and [2] . Consistently, demyelinated areas in the CNS of MS patients are associated with an inflammatory reaction orchestrated by activated T cells, macrophages, and endogenous glial cells (astroglia and microglia). Activated T cells, macrophages, and endogenous glial cells produce a variety of proinflammatory and neurotoxic factors such as NO [3] . There is abundant evidence that the production of NO is significantly raised within MS lesions, arising not only from the pathological study of lesions themselves, but also from studies of the CSF, blood, and urine patients, and the electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy of animals with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an animal model for MS [4, 5] . Several studies demonstrate that nitric oxide plays an important role in oligodendrocytes damage in MS [6, 7] . Increased expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) has been detected in MS lesions. In fact, both endogenous NO released by glial cells and NO generated from exogenous NO donors are known to induce oligodendrocytes death [3, [8] [9] [10] .",

Chronically activated astrocytes and microglia are also believed to contribute to the pathology of neuroimmunological diseases including MS [10, 13] . Previous studies have shown that astrocytes play important roles in development and differentiation of oligodendrocytes and the proinflammatory products of astrocytes were important in ridding the CNS of pathogens [14] . However, they can also be toxic to host CNS cells including myelin producing oligodendrocytes, which are compromised in the course of primary demyelination in MS and considered to contribute significantly to functional neurological deficits [15] . In acute MS lesions and experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE), intense reactivity for iNOS mRNA and protein was detected in reactive astrocytes and microglia throughout the lesions and in adjacent normal appearing white matter and that astrocyte-derived NO could be important in orchestrating inflammatory response in MS [16] [17] [18] .",

In the present study, we show that both exogenous and endogenous NO down-regulates the expression of myelin genes (MBP, PLP, CNPase, and MOG) in primary human mixed glial cells and oligodendrocytes, which is probably an early event before the oligodendrocytes death.

All of the experimental protocols were reviewed and approved by the Institutional Review Board of the Rush University Medical Center. Briefly, 14-to 16-weeks-old fetal brains obtained from the Human Embryology Laboratory (University of Washington, Seattle, WA) were dissociated by trituration and trypsinization (0.25% trypsin in PBS at 37\u00b0C for 15 min). The trypsin was inactivated with 10% heatinactivated FBS (Mediatech, Washington, DC). The dissociated cells were filtered successively through 380 and 140 \u00b5m meshes (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) and pelleted by centrifugation. The resulting suspension was centrifuged for 10 min at 1500 rpm and then resuspended in DMEM/F12 supplemented with 20% heat inactivated FBS. Cells were plated on poly-D-lysine-coated 75 cm2 flasks and incubated at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO 2 in air. Culture medium was changed after every 3 days. The initial mixed glial cultures, grown for 9 days, were placed on a rotary shaker at 240 rpm at 37\u00b0C for 2 hrs to remove loosely attached microglia. The oligodendrocytes were detached after shaking for 18 hrs at 200 rpm at 11 days. To purify oligodendrocytes from astrocytes and microglia, the detached cell suspension was plated in tissue culture dishes (2\u00d7l0 6 cells/100 mm) for 60 min at 37\u00b0C. This step was repeated twice for non-adherent cells to minimize the contamination. The nonadhering cells, mostly oligodendrocytes, were seeded onto poly-D-lysine-coated culture plates in complete medium (DMEM/F12 supplemented with 10% heat inactivated FBS) at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO 2 in air. The remaining cells in the flask are astrocytes. Earlier we [28, 29] have shown that oligodendrocytes isolated through this procedure are more than 98% pure.",

Figure 4C showed that SNAP time dependency inhibited the expression of myelin genes MBP, PLP, MOG and CNPase. Maximum inhibition was observed at 12 h. Next we determined the effect of SNAP on the expression of myelin protein PLP in primary oligodendrocytes. As evident from the Western blots in Figure 4D , SNAP, dose dependently inhibited the expression PLP in human oligodendrocytes. Dentiometric analysis also further confirmed these results ( Figure 4E Similarly, immunofluroscence analysis also shows that SNP and NOC-7 markedly inhibited the protein expression of MOG and PLP ( Figures 4Q and 4R ).

We have found that exogenous NO decreased the myelin gene expression (Figure 4) . To identify the mechanism underlying the down-regulation of myelin gene expression in oligodendroctes by activated astrocytes, we next asked whether cell-to-cell contact was required for the down-regulation of myelin gene expression. To pursue this question, we performed experiments by using porous transwells in which astrocytes were cultured in transwell and placed into 12-well culture plates containing pure oligodendrocytes. So there was no physical contact between the two cell types but soluble/secreted factors could move across the transwell. In the presence of transwell containing IL-1 activated astrocytes, the expression of PLP and MOG was inhibited. But in the presence of transwell containing untreated astrocytes, PLP and MOG expression remained unchanged. These observations suggested that diffusible factors were responsible for the down-regulation of myelin gene expression. It is evident from Figure 5A that L-NIL and uric acid block the soluble factormediated down-regulation of myelin gene expression. Quantitative real time PCR data in Figure 5B supported this conclusion. Consistent with mRNA results, L-NIL and uric acid also inhibited the soluble factor mediated suppression of PLP and MOG ( Figure 5C ). These results further suggest that IL-1 activated astrocytes induce NO that reacts with superoxide anion at a diffusion-limited rate to form the short-lived potent oxidant peroxynitrite.",

However, despite extensive research on the pathogenesis of MS, no effective therapy is available to halt demyelination and/or stimulate remyelination. Many studies have documented the fact that cytokine induced NO production can lead to damage and destruction of normal cells [4] . It is implicated in autoimmune diseases such as diabetes were the death of pancreatic islet cells occurs as well as normal tissue damage as the result of infarction, such as damage to neurons during stroke. Several reports demonstrate the role for NO in glial cells killing of the myelin-producing cell, the oligodendrocytes [4, 8, 18, 26] . Previous work showed that in mature aggregating brain cells cultures, the combined treatment with IFN-and LPS, two inflammatory agents, caused microglial activation and the up-regulation of a variety of inflammatory mediators including cytokines, chemokines and NO. This inflammatory response was accompanied by demyelination in the absence of neuronal damage, cell death or astrogliosis [38] . The excessive release of NO is major mediator in autoimmune diseases and is involved in the killing of oligodendrocytes, resulting in subsequent demyelination and permanent neurological deficits in affected individuals [12, 39] .",

First, (LPS+IFN-) combination or PolyIC were unable to inhibit the myelin gene expression in mixed glial cultures where either NO production was inhibited by L-NIL or NO was scavenged by PTIO. Second, NO alone was also capable of inhibiting the expression of myelin gene expression in primary human oligodendrocytes. Third, to address the possibility of correlation between NO and down-regulation of myelin gene expression, we applied conditional media from astrocytes by treatment with IL-1 to culture primary oligodendrocytes. The conditioned media from astrocytes treated by IL-causes the downregulation of myelin gene expression. Pretreatment astrocytes with uric acid and PTIO restore the myelin gene expression. These observations demonstrate that myelin gene expression is regulated by NO produced by activated astrocytes. This study also demonstrates that cell-to-cell contact is not necessary to down-regulation of myelin gene expression.",

Studies published in other reports have shown that microglia and astrocytes produce significant NO2-or NOS production after stimulation either with (LPS+IFN-) or polyIC [3, 8] . NO is a reactive molecule, it does not exist in tissues only as a free radical; it also gives rise, sometimes reversibly, to several other related compounds. These compounds include the nitroxyl (NO=) ion, nitrous acid (HNO 2 ), the nitrogen dioxide (NO 2 ) radical, peroxynitrite (ONOO-; a product of the combination of superoxide and nitric oxide) and peroxinitrous acid (ONOOH) [4] . Forms that NO takes at the site of inflammation are not known with much certainty. In pathological conditions, NO reacts with superoxide to form peroxynitrite, which nitrates proteins forming nitrotyrosine residues, leading to loss of protein function, perturbation of signal transduction, and cell death [40] . In the present study, we have examined four different NO generators to regulate the role of myelin genes expression in human primary oligodendrocytes. Previous studies demonstrate that all these NO donors cause the oligodendrocytes damage [9] . SNAP generates the NO radical NO., SNP generates nitrosonium ion, NO + , and SIN-1 generates peroxynitrite [9, 41] . These molecules cause oligodendrocytes damage by different mechanisms, but we found that all these molecules downregulates the myelin gene expression. Scavenging of peroxynitrite by uric acid blocks conditioned media mediateddown-regulation of myelin gene expression suggesting that peroxitrite is the major reactive species in IL-1 -activated astrocytes, and it is an important regulator of myelin gene expression.",

The expression of MBP, PLP, MOG, and CNPase was analyzed by semi-quantitative PCR and real time PCR. It is clearly evident from Figures 3E and 3F that polyIC dose dependently inhibited the expression MBP, PLP, MOG, and CNPase. Marked decreased in the expression of PLP was observed at 25 \u00b5M of polyIC. On the other hand, the expression of MBP was affected moderately by treatment with polyIC.",
