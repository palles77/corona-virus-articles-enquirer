Colostrum-derived antibodies make the detection of persistently BVDV-infected neonatal calves cumbersome and expensive. The objective of this study was to evaluate the use of immunohistochemical staining of skin biopsy samples from neonatal calves as a method for the early detection of persistent BVDV infection. Three hundred thirty-two 1-to 4-week-old dairy calves were screened for BVDV as part of a routine control program. Formalin-fixed skin biopsy samples were stained for BVDV antigen by immunohistochemistry (IHC), and the results were compared to those of virus isolation (VI) from white blood cell preparations. Six calves were positive by both IHC and VI and remained positive for BVDV upon subsequent follow-up testing; thus, they were classified as persistently infected with BVDV. One calf was positive by VI but negative by IHC. On subsequent testing, the calf was negative by VI, suggesting that the initial VI result was due to an acute BVDV infection. One calf was positive by IHC but negative by VI. This calf remained negative by VI on follow-up testing. Immunohistochemical staining of skin biopsy samples is a reliable method for screening neonatal calves for persistent BVDV infection and would be a useful management tool as an aid for controlling and preventing BVDV infection.",

            "text": "Bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) is a significant infectious viral agent of cattle (1, 8) . The primary sources of virus transmission within and between cattle herds are cattle that are persistently infected with BVDV (13) . Persistent infection occurs with the development of immunotolerance to BVDV, which can result if fetal infection with BVDV occurs prior to the fourth month of gestation (14, 16) . A key management strategy that is used to control and prevent BVDV infection is the detection and elimination of cattle that are persistently infected with BVDV. Accurate and inexpensive methods for the detection soon after birth of cattle persistently infected with BVDV would be ideal, since it would allow prevention of BVDV dissemination on farms. Many methods have been used to screen cattle for persistent infection, including virus isolation (VI), enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and PCR analysis of blood samples (5, 7) . However, the detection of BVDV in neonatal calves is complicated by the presence of colostrum-derived passive antibodies which can neutralize virus in serum for up to 4 months (6, 19) , thus making the use of VI and an ELISA using serum unreliable prior to this point (5, 7) . VI from and PCR analysis of white blood cell preparations from neonatal calves have been used successfully to detect BVDV in neonatal calves (5, 7) , but the costs of these procedures for routine screening may be prohibitive. Immunohistochemical staining of skin biopsy samples has recently been shown to be a useful method for screening cattle for persistent BVDV infection (11, 18, 20) and has the potential to be a relatively inexpensive and accurate method for screening cattle for persistent BVDV infection. The use of immunohistochemistry (IHC) for detecting neonatal calves with persistent infection has not been evaluated. The objective of this study was to evaluate IHC as a tool for detecting neonatal calves persistently infected with BVDV.",

Tissue was digested with protease for 10 min and then treated with 5% horse serum to block nonspecific antibody binding sites. Antigen detection was achieved by using the BVDV monoclonal antibody 15C5 (Ed Dubovi, Cornell University) as the primary antibody and a commercially available immunoperoxidase detection system (Vectastain Elite ABC; Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, Calif.). Control slides consisting of known BVDVpositive and -negative samples were stained concurrently in each batch to monitor quality control.

Control programs that screen neonatal calves soon after birth have been advocated (4, 12) . By strategically identifying and removing calves that are persistently infected with BVDV as early as possible, the length of time that these virus reservoirs are on a farm, serving as a source of virus dissemination, is significantly reduced. The cost to raise calves is significant, and it would be economically beneficial if a BVDV control strategy could be implemented in which cattle that are persistently BVDV infected were identified and eliminated at an age as young as possible, i.e., prior to the investment of significant resources in them. The most commonly used technique to screen neonatal calves for BVDV is VI from white blood cells. However, the cost of the routine use of this technique as a screening tool for BVDV may be prohibitive. The use of less costly screening assays such as ELISA or VI from serum is not reliable in neonatal calves because of the presence of colostrum-derived passive antibodies to BVDV that neutralize free virus. These assays can be used as passive antibodies decay and free virus begins to reappear in serum. The reappearance of virus in serum is variable and may occur in cattle that range from 2 to 6 months of age (6, 19) . Many BVDV control programs screen calves at 4 to 6 months of age. However, by this time producers have incurred a significant cost in raising these calves, and any calf that is persistently infected with BVDV is a potential source of virus transmission.",

However, as was the case in this study, it may be logistically simpler to regularly sample all new calves born during a set interval. Virus can readily be identified in most tissues of cattle that are persistently infected with BVDV, including the skin (2, 3, 18, 20) . The use of skin biopsy samples has been reported to be an accurate method for identifying cattle persistently infected with BVDV (18) .

            "text": "In this study, the results of IHC and VI from white blood cells for two calves were in disagreement. In one calf, virus antigen was detected by IHC but not by VI. Staining was limited to small areas in the epidermal layer of the skin only. Several attempts to isolate virus from this calf over the next 3 weeks were unsuccessful. Staining by IHC was still present on a skin biopsy sample taken 1 week after the initial test. It is likely that this calf had undergone an acute infection prior to the initial test and that residual viral antigen was still detectable in tissues. A cohort calf that was persistently infected with BVDV was identified the previous week, thus providing a virus reservoir for the infection of susceptible calves. Viral antigen may be detectable in tissues for an extended time after the virus has been cleared from the blood (10, 15, 21) . In addition, virus can be detected in the skin of cattle that have undergone an acute infection, although the amount and distribution of staining are reported to be different than those found in cattle persistently infected with BVDV (9, 18) . In a second calf, BVDV was isolated from white blood cells on initial screening but was not detected by IHC on the skin. On follow-up testing 1 and 2 weeks later, virus was not isolated from white blood cells or found by IHC on the skin. Again, it is likely that this calf was undergoing an acute BVDV infection and was viremic at the time of initial testing. The detection of BVDV in skin by IHC following acute infection has been reported to be inconsistent (9, 18) , so the failure to detect virus in this calf is not surprising. These two cases illustrate the importance of follow-up testing to confirm positive results that are found in the initial screening of calves for persistent BVDV infection.",
