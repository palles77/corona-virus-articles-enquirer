It is the guardian of homeostasis, the epicenter of the body's metabolic capability, a massive filter detoxifying the portal blood releasing cleansed blood to the systemic circulation, and a lymphoid organ protecting against infection. However high our regard for the liver, it is dwarfed by the perspective of ancient civilizations that regarded the liver as the seat of life and window to the future. In ancient Mesopotamia and Babylonia, the liver was used to divine the future using a technique termed hepatoscopy. This interest is captured in a Biblical quote from Ezekiel 21 : 21, \"For the king of Babylon stands at the parting of the way, at the head of the two ways, to use divination; he shakes the arrows, he consults the household idols, he looks at the liver.\" Hepatoscopy was continued by the Greeks, Etruscans, and the Romans. The practice is continued in a fashion today. Liver injury or neoplasia foretells a poor future for many pharmaceuticals in development.",

Primitive epithelial cells of the hepatic diverticulum extend into the adjacent mesenchymal stroma of the septum transversum, a sheet of cells that incompletely separates the pericardial and peritoneal cavity and that will develop into the connective tissue of the liver. The primitive epithelial cells are arranged in close approximation with the vessels that form the vitelline venous plexus, a complex of vessels that drain the yolk sac. Thus the essential sinusoidal arrangement of the liver is established very early in development. The gallbladder and the cystic duct arise from the caudal part of the hepatic diverticulum.",

            "text": "The hepatic diverticulum is also the origin of the biliary epithelium. Development of the biliary tree begins at the hilus and spreads outward to reach the subcapsular zone over time. Intrahepatic bile ducts develop from the ductal plate, a structure that is composed initially of a single row of hepatoblasts that surround the portal vein branches and ensheath the mesenchyme of the primitive portal tract. The development of the hepatoblasts adjacent to the portal tract mesenchyme is altered by interactions with the mesenchyme. Initially, these cells form the ductal plate, a single row of cells surrounding the portal tract. The cells of the ductal plate can be identified by expression of cytokeratin 7, differentiating them from the hepatoblasts ( Fig. 2-1) . A second discontinuous outer layer of cells forms subsequently, and the 2-cell-thick regions remodel into tubules. Most undergo apoptosis, but 1 or 2 ducts become incorporated in the developing portal tract. At about the time the bile ducts are forming, the hepatic artery branches appear in the developing portal tract. Nerves and lymphatics eventually invest the portal tracts as well, completing the mature portal tract. The wave of development from the hilus to the subcapsular region is imperfect, as the veins, arteries, and bile ducts reach their terminal ends separately. Consequently, in human liver, up to 30% of subcapsular portal tracts are \"dyads\" containing only bile duct and artery profiles. Sinusoidal lining cells other than the endothelium likely arise in the bone marrow and populate the liver via a hematogenous route. The liver is the largest internal organ in the body. In adult carnivores, the liver constitutes ~3% of body weight. In adult omnivores, it is ~2% of body weight and ~1% of body weight in adult herbivores. In neonates of all species, the liver is a larger percentage of body weight than in the adult. The liver has a smooth capsular surface, and the parenchyma consists of friable red-brown tissue that is divided into lobes. The number and shape of the liver lobes of the major domestic mammals vary among species. In monogastric animals, the liver abuts the diaphragm and occupies the central area of the cranial abdomen. In ruminants, and to a lesser extent in horses, the liver is displaced to the right side of the cranial abdominal cavity. A series of ligaments maintains the liver in its position. The coronary ligament attaches the liver to the diaphragm near the esophagus. The falciform ligament attaches the midline of the liver to the ventral midline of the abdomen. The round ligament, a remnant of the umbilical vein, is embedded within the falciform ligament.",

The valveless portal vein drains the digestive tract, forestomachs, glandular stomach, and intestines, as well as the spleen and pancreas. Portal vein flow provides 70-80% of the total afferent hepatic blood flow and ~50% of the oxygen supply. The hepatic artery provides the remainder of hepatic blood flow. Portal blood flow is not regulated, but hepatic arterial flow is regulated, primarily by adenosine, and responds to changes in portal flow. When portal blood flow is reduced, less adenosine is washed out of the hepatic circulation, and this increased concentration drives hepatic arterial dilation, creating a hepatic arterial buffer effect whereby a consistent hepatic blood flow is maintained. Portal blood flow is important for the rapid clearance of nutrients, xenobiotics, microorganisms, and potentially immunogenic materials that enter the circulation from the gastrointestinal tract. Hepatic arterioles disperse into a peribiliary capillary plexus, a perivenous plexus surrounding the portal vein, or join terminal hepatic arterioles before entering the sinusoids, lowering pressure and preventing reversal of portal venous inflow. Portal and arterial blood eventually mix in the low-pressure hepatic sinusoids. Both terminal portal venules and hepatic arterioles flow into the sinusoids, but flow is closely regulated by a series of inlet sphincters formed by endothelial cells for the venules and smooth muscle for the arterioles. Thus, at any particular time, sinusoidal blood could be entirely venous, mixed arterial and venous, or arterial. This blood flow pattern may account for the interlobular and intralobular heterogeneity of lesions following various toxicities. Blood leaves the liver via the hepatic vein, which is very short, and enters the caudal vena cava.",

Hepatic sinusoids are lined by specialized endothelial cells. Hepatic sinusoids differ from vascular structures elsewhere in that they lack a typical basement membrane, and are supported by a specialized, discontinuous or loose extracellular matrix (ECM). Hepatic sinusoidal endothelial cells are fenestrated, and these 100-nm diameter sieve-like pores control fluid, solute, and particulate interchange between blood and the perisinusoidal space, regulated by the action of the cellular cytoskeleton. Sinusoidal endothelial cells are actively pinocytotic and internalize and degrade various endogenous glycoproteins, glycosaminoglycans, and immune complexes.

Because of the pattern of progressive branching of the portal tract system, individual tracts exhibit a range of sizes and shapes, from round to triangular or branching. In larger portal tracts, lymphatic channels and autonomic nerve fibers may be seen. The bile duct system is a branching outflow that ultimately enters the proximal duodenum. Most species, with the exception of the horse and rat, have a bile storage diverticulum (gallbladder). Cats occasionally have divided or bipartite gallbladders. The bile duct joins the pancreatic duct before entry into the duodenum in some species and has a separate entry in others. Intrahepatic bile ducts range in size from the larger septal or trabecular ducts (internal diameter of >100 \u00b5m in humans) to the smaller interlobular ducts, and tend to be adjacent to a hepatic artery branch of approximately the same size. Bile ducts are lined by cuboidal to low columnar bile duct epithelial cells, subtended by a periodic acid-Schiff (PAS)-positive basement membrane.

Mammalian hepatocytes are organized in plate-like monolayer arrays among the sinusoids and in 3 dimensions; plates, sinusoids, and tracts anastomose in a complex pattern. Currently, a somewhat baffling array of models exists, each with their own adherents. These include the well-known lobular and acinar patterns (discussed later) and several others. Matsumoto's primary lobule is based on detailed reconstructions of human liver sections, and considers the penetrating venule extending from the portal tract as a \"vascular septum\" and the origin of the primary lobule's blood flow as it is a starting place for the radially arranged sinusoids flowing to the terminal hepatic vein. In this model, there is a series of branches formed by the portal vein. The first branches provide a conducting portal flow, and the next level of branches drain directly into the sinusoids forming the distributing portal flow. The choleohepaton, related to the concept of the nephron, is composed of an isosceles triangle of hepatocytes with its apex in contact with the terminal hepatic venule and drained by a single bile ductule/canal of Hering at the base of the triangle.

The functional activity of hepatocytes is heterogeneous, and virtually all liver functions have a zonal gradient. Periportal hepatocytes, exposed to the blood with the highest concentration of oxygen, insulin, glucagon, and amino acids, are the principal site of gluconeogenesis, protein synthesis, aerobic metabolism, urea cycle, and lipid and cholesterol metabolism. In the centrilobular region, glycolysis, lipogenesis, and the major biotransformation functions are more active, including the expression of most cytochromes P450, glucuronyl transferases, glutathione S-transferases, and other biotransformation/ detoxification enzymes.

Bile is propelled along the canaliculi by a web of contractile microfilaments. This specialized membrane contains various adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-dependent carriers that export many products, including leukotrienes, bile salts, xenobiotics, and their metabolites into the bile.

These organelles support a variety of hepatocellular functions, including the synthesis and secretion of plasma proteins, coagulation factors, and acute-phase proteins. Hepatocytes store nutrients in times of adequate energy and release glucose when needed. They are key modulators of lipid metabolism, and they synthesize and secrete lipoproteins. In addition, they are the only cells capable of bile acid synthesis, and they can absorb and secrete them into bile. Finally, hepatocytes detoxify the large majority of xenobiotics and secrete them into the bile. Because of this central role in metabolism, the liver is subjected to a variety of nutritionally based insults as well as toxin-related damage. A greater proportion of the genome is expressed in the normal liver than has been observed in any other tissue, an indication that brief surveys of liver functions are necessarily oversimplified. However, those constituents that are most abundant have most influence on the microscopic appearance of the liver. The normal hepatocyte contains abundant glycogen, which varies depending on food intake, and which can be demonstrated by PAS staining, as well as variable amounts of stored triglycerides and various proteins, such as ferritin, an iron-binding protein. The cytoplasm of the centrilobular hepatocytes may also contain uniform, golden-brown granules of lipofuscin, particularly in older cats. This so-called \"wear-and-tear\" pigment becomes more prominent with age, and progressively accumulates in midzonal and periportal hepatocytes. Hepatocytes have a cytoskeleton composed of microtubules, microfilaments, and intermediate filaments. Microtubules are found throughout the cytoplasm, and are involved in the movement of secreted proteins into the extracellular perisinusoidal space; accordingly, microtubule inhibitors such as colchicine and Vinca alkaloids may reduce hepatic protein secretion. Microfilaments, composed of actin and myosin, are concentrated around the bile canaliculus, where they are involved in canalicular peristalsis and bile secretion; microfilament inhibitors result in cholestasis. Intermediate filaments (predominantly cytokeratins 8 and 18) form an irregular meshwork extending from the plasma membrane to the perinuclear zone, and are responsible for spatial organization of the hepatocyte.",

Cytokine responses of Kupffer cells are believed to be important in regulating the extent of adaptive immune response or tolerance to potentially antigenic macromolecules that can reach the liver through the portal blood. The liver contains large numbers of lymphocytes, comprising ~5% of the entire cell population of the liver, with an organ-specific lymphocyte distribution characterized by the enrichment of elements of the innate immune system, including natural killer T lymphocytes (NKT cells), natural killer (NK cells), and innate lymphocytes, in addition to the Kupffer cells previously mentioned. Elements of the acquired immune system, CD8+ T cells, are also increased when compared with peripheral blood. The majority of intrahepatic lymphocytes are involved in innate immune responses rather than acquired immunity. Hepatic NK cells constitute ~40% of hepatic lymphocytes and are distinct phenotypically and functionally from blood NK cells. Hepatic NKT cells reside in the space of Disse, are considered large granular lymphocytes, and were previously referred to as pit cells.

Once thought to be \"fixed,\" it is now known that they can migrate along the sinusoid and into areas of tissue injury (Fig. 2-3) . Kupffer cells may have a dual origin as they are derived, at least in part, from blood-borne monocytes, but they are also capable of local proliferation, particularly in inflammation. They are not efficient antigen presenters, but they are proficient phagocytes of apoptotic and necrotic cells, particulates, and microorganisms; consequently, the liver is a major \"filtering organ\" for the body. There are species differences in the efficiency of this process. Clearance of particulates, and endotoxin in particular, is accomplished more effectively by Kupffer cells in dogs, humans, and laboratory rodents than in ruminants, horse, pig, cats, and whales, species that have a significant population of intravascular macrophages in the pulmonary vasculature. Kupffer cells can phagocytose a variety of gut-derived materials; bacteria, various biologically active bacterial components, including lipopolysaccharides, lipoteichoic acids, and peptidoglycans, without stimulating inflammation. Activated Kupffer cells can secrete tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 and other cytokines, and nitric oxide; these contribute to peripheral vasodilation and hypotension in systemic inflammatory response syndromes initiated by bacterial components. Other secreted cytokines, such as interleukin-1 (IL-1) and IL-6, mediate the acute-phase response and some aspects of the immune and liver regenerative responses. However, there can be a balance activation. They then develop a myofibroblast phenotype characterized by the expression \u03b1-smooth muscle actin. Proinflammatory cytokines released primarily by Kupffer cells, such as transforming growth factor-\u03b2 released in response to tissue injury, stimulate HSC to increase the deposition of ECM, including collagen type I, III, and IV, and laminin. This new ECM transforms the sinusoid to a less permeable capillary, lined by a basement membrane-like layer and without fenestrations in the sinusoidal endothelium, reducing transfer of macromolecules between hepatocytes and the blood. The acquired contractility of the HSC during fibrogenesis is increased because of an increase in the contractile stimulus of endothelin-1 and a reduction in vasodilation driven by diminished nitric oxide generation. In severe chronic injury leading to cirrhosis, the increased expression of contractile proteins within activated stellate cells can further restrict sinusoidal blood flow as a primary effect, rather than a consequence of nodule formation and fibrosis. Peribiliary fibrosis arises from activation of the circumferential fibroblasts of the bile ducts that undergo a phenotypic transformation similar to that of the HSC along the sinusoids. Fibrosis of the portal tracts and the central vein connective tissue develops from activation of myofibroblasts resident in these areas as well. It is also possible that epithelial-mesenchymal transition of hepatocytes, biliary epithelial cells, or HSC can contribute to hepatic fibrosis during chronic injury.",

Congenital hepatic fibrosis has also been reported in aborted and neonatal calves, in the latter case accompanied by cyst formation in the kidney and lung.

However, the functional consequences of focal hepatic atrophy are minor because the remaining liver can compensate and adapt by a process that involves replication and enlargement of hepatocytes. Local pressure atrophy occurs adjacent to space-occupying lesions in the liver, or as a result of chronic pressures from neighboring organs, such as distended rumen in the ox. It has been suggested that right hepatic lobe atrophy, reported in horses, results from long-term compression from abnormal distension of the right dorsal colon and base of the cecum (eFig. 2-3). Chronic diffuse diseases of the biliary tract, such as sporidesmin poisoning and fascioliasis, are likely to cause atrophy of the left lobe in ruminants, possibly as a result of the greater difficulty in maintaining adequate biliary drainage from this lobe, whose bile ducts are longer than those of the right in these species.

These responses are more evident in smaller species, notably in laboratory rodents that have a very pronounced liver growth response after exposure to various xenobiotics. The liver can also adapt to reduced demand or oxygen supply by a combination of cellular atrophy and apoptosis.

A condition known as acquired melanosis is the massive accumulation of black pigment (not melanin) in hepatocytes and Kupffer cells of mature sheep and, less frequently cattle, after prolonged grazing on extensive unimproved pastures in inland eastern Australia, the Falkland Islands, and Scandinavia. The condition in Norway has also been described as hepatic lipofuscinosis. The color of the affected livers ranges from a dull gray to uniform black, and there is usually a prominent acinar pattern. In severe cases, there is also pigmentation of the hepatic lymph nodes, lungs, and renal cortex. Histologically, the pigment is present as granules in lysosomes in periportal and midzonal hepatocytes and macrophages of the liver, the proximal tubular epithelium of the kidneys, and in alveolar and interstitial macrophages in the lung.

In this case, the identity of the pigment is obvious, but when it is present in granular form in Kupffer cell cytoplasm, it may easily be confused with hemosiderin and hematin. Bile pigment is encountered infrequently in hepatocyte cytoplasm, almost never in proliferation of peroxisomes, or mitochondria can also cause hepatocellular hypertrophy. The light microscopic appearance of hypertrophy upon routine hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining will sometimes suggest the selective involvement of one organelle. If total SER volume is increased, the cytoplasm will typically have an eosinophilic ground-glass appearance upon light microscopy. If total peroxisomal volume is increased, the cytoplasm is often noted to have an eosinophilic granular appearance. The response can be seen within a few days after exposure to various drugs and other xenobiotic compounds. Accordingly, the liver becomes grossly enlarged. This induction of SER or peroxisomes is reversible, and after discontinuation of exposure to the inducing agent, the expanded SER or excess peroxisomes are removed by autophagy, and many hepatocytes undergo apoptosis.

Endothelial lipoprotein lipase in muscle and adipose tissue hydrolyzes triglycerides in the VLDL, and the fatty acids released are used locally by \u03b2-oxidation in mitochondria of muscle or re-esterified into triglyceride in adipocytes.

This pattern can occur in several toxic hepatopathies causing mitochondrial injury, including some drug toxicities, such as antiviral nucleosides, aspirin in Reye's syndrome, and excessive tetracycline administration, all of which can be fatal. These toxicities tend to target: mitochondria, disrupting energy production; the normal electron transfer chain, causing oxidative injury; and interfere with \u03b2-oxidation of lipids.

The ill-defined vacuolar boundaries in steroid hepatopathy are readily distinguishable from spherical lipid vacuoles in hepatic steatosis.

The amount of glycogen remaining in affected cells is widely variable, a function of the original glycogen concentration, recent catabolism, and postmortem dissolution. Glycogen content can best be demonstrated in frozen section, followed by staining with periodic acid-Schiff, and can be confirmed as glycogen by its sensitivity to digestion with diastase. Livers affected by glucocorticoid hepatopathy maintain normal hepatocyte functions, but the condition can be confirmed by the induction and serum increase of glucocorticoidinducible alkaline phosphatase, with minor or negligible increases in alanine aminotransferase.

All of these terms refer to the visible accumulation of triglycerides (triacylglycerols) as round globules in the cytoplasm of hepatocytes. The threshold for application of these terms is vague because triglyceride storage and transport are normal hepatic functions, but they are appropriate when the amounts are greater than would normally be seen. Hepatocellular steatosis can be physiologic or pathologic. Any circumstance in which hepatic uptake of lipids exceeds oxidation or secretion can lead to hepatocellular steatosis. Increased mobilization of triglycerides during late pregnancy or heavy lactation in ruminants is associated with hepatocellular steatosis. The lipid represents increased transit of triglycerides in an otherwise healthy liver, so there is little diagnostic significance in mild degrees of hepatocellular smooth (eFig. 2-5). The cut surface has a diffuse greasy appearance or a red and yellow lobular pattern if there is also hepatic congestion or zonal necrosis.

This condition is an acquired storage disorder caused by some therapeutic drugs and chemicals, including amiodarone and chlorphentermine. Despite the diversity of agents capable of causing phospholipidosis, most of these are cationic amphipathic molecules. Mechanistically, phospholipidosis is caused by cationic amphipathic molecules binding to cellular phospholipids and inhibiting complete digestion by lysosomal phospholipase A1, A2, or C within lysosomes; although less often, direct inhibition of phospholipase can occur, as in the case of gentamicin. This leads to an accumulation of lysosomal phospholipids that can develop acutely or only following long-term drug administration. The histologic appearance of phospholipidosis can be quite variable, but typically, hepatocellular and Kupffer cell cytoplasm contains numerous round clear vacuoles that are smaller than the diameter of the nucleus or larger, imparting a foamy appearance to the cytoplasm. Fine vacuoles are most often apparent adjacent to canaliculi. Zonal distribution can vary depending on the type of drug or chemical. Biliary epithelium can also be affected, with or without hepatocellular involvement. The clear vacuoles can be confused with microvesicular steatosis, and in most cases, ultrastructural examination is needed to identify phospholipidosis with certainty. At the ultrastructural level, there is a characteristic multilaminated whorl of material with a \"fingerprint\" pattern, termed myeloid bodies, within affected lysosomes.",

Amyloid infiltration of the liver occurs sporadically in cattle, horses, dogs, and cats as a secondary response to chronic disease or tissuedestructive process. In horses, hepatic amyloidosis occurs chiefly as a result of chronic inflammation and has been well recognized in horses used for the production of hyperimmune serum. Horses may develop icterus and other signs of hepatic failure, but cattle die first of the primary disease or from uremia resulting from concurrent renal amyloidosis. Dogs and cats typically develop signs of renal dysfunction, although cats may be presented with spontaneous hepatic rupture. Familial AA amyloidosis is recognized in Chinese Shar-Pei dogs. The condition resembles familial Mediterranean fever in humans, and is characterized by febrile episodes, swollen hock syndrome, and the development of renal and sometimes hepatic amyloidosis.

ATP depletion or physical damage to membranes of the cell surface, mitochondria, and ER leads to loss of ion homeostasis, altered cellular volume regulation, and increased intracellular calcium ion concentrations. Activation of calcium-dependent endonucleases, proteases (e.g., calpains), and phospholipases is responsible for the terminal events in necrosis. The source of calcium may influence the type of cell death, as calcium influx from the plasma membrane is associated with necrosis, but calcium released from the ER is more likely to trigger apoptosis.

The zonal necrotic insult frequently affects the sinusoidal endothelium, allowing erythrocytes to enter the perisinusoidal space and contribute to the redness of the necrotic zones. Histologically, necrosis is confined to the centrilobular region ( Fig. 2-34) , although bridging can occur in more severe cases ( Fig. 2-35 ). Necrotic cells that are removed can be replaced by stagnant blood, at least in the acute phase. However, this red-on-yellow zonal pattern is difficult to interpret grossly because hepatic steatosis may also have a zonal distribution without having significant necrosis. may be a tendency for focal necrosis to occur nearer to the portal vessels than to the periphery of the circulatory fields, and to be concentrated in some lobular agglomerates rather than others.",

These lesions may occur alone or in any combination, although all seldom occur in one animal. They are known to be of nutritional origin, and the fact that the various lesions can occur separately indicates the complexity of the pathogenesis. Experimental observations have revealed the need for concurrent deficiencies of sulfur-containing amino acids, tocopherols, and trace amounts of selenium if hepatic necrosis is to develop. Selenium protects efficiently against the hepatic necrosis and massive effusions, and tocopherols are probably protective against other lesions that occur as part of the syndrome. The pathogenesis is incompletely understood, but is in part related to the generation of free radicals, exacerbated by deficiency of free-radical scavengers such as vitamin E, and selenium, protective against reactive oxygen radicals through its role in glutathione peroxidase and some other selenoproteins. Hepatosis dietetica occurs in rapidly growing pigs fed diets largely of grain and containing protein supplements lacking in either quality or quantity. There is some evidence that in pigs that are nutritionally predisposed, a cold and damp environment or some other stress may precipitate the disease.

The sinusoidal endothelial cells may lose their typical fenestrae or pores, limiting contact between plasma and hepatocellular microvilli, and if there is an increased deposition of extracellular matrix (ECM) beneath the altered endothelium, the alteration is termed \"capillarization of sinusoids,\" leading to reduced hepatic function. Sinusoidal endothelial cells may relax their connections to the fine to regrow and be eaten again. Although the mythical daily regrowth of hepatic mass is more prodigious than the realworld response, hepatic regeneration is nonetheless remarkable. In rodents, partial hepatectomies can be repeated more than 10 times, followed by restoration of normal hepatic mass. Individual hepatocytes are able to replicate up to 70 times. Simple replacement of missing hepatocytes alone does not truly constitute regeneration because normal liver microscopic architecture is essential to maintain normal hepatic function. Although new lobes are not regenerated following hepatectomy, the remaining lobes enlarge, and the proliferated hepatocytes and other cellular elements progress through a series of steps that involve interaction of hepatocytes and angiogenic processes to restore the normal relationships between the hepatocytes and the sinusoids. Regeneration of mature hepatocytes is stimulated by several factors. These include polypeptide growth factors, such as hepatocyte growth factor, epidermal growth factor, transforming growth factor-\u03b1 (TGF-\u03b1), and insulin-like growth factors. Hepatocyte growth factor is the most potent mitogen and is released by hepatic stellate cells to stimulate hepatocytes in a paracrine fashion. This growth factor can also be embedded in the ECM to be released by proteases. Hepatic regeneration is also enhanced by nutrition, with fasting slowing and dietary protein promoting regeneration. In addition, catecholamines and a broad variety of hormones support regeneration, with insulin, glucagon being the most significant. Cytokines, such as IL-6, produced by TNF-\u03b1-stimulated Kupffer cells, are other important effectors. When IL-6 binds its receptor, it stimulates mitogenic intracellular signaling and potentiates signaling by other growth factors. These effectors are examples of the important role of the innate immune system in hepatic regeneration. The autonomic nervous system also plays a role in hepatic regeneration, as denervation of the liver can significantly limit hepatic regeneration.",

As much as 70% of the normal liver can be removed surgically without clinical insufficiency, and in the course of a few weeks, it is back to its normal mass. Depending on the nature of the injury, regeneration occurs via one of 2 pathways. In cases of moderate injury, cell loss is replaced by proliferation of mature hepatocytes or biliary epithelium, providing swift replacement of parenchymal loss. In cases of more severe injury, or conditions that inhibit replication of mature cells, there is proliferation of bipotential progenitor cells, called a ductular reaction. These cells reside in the periportal region of the lobule at the level of the canals of Hering, the site where bile canaliculi and biliary epithelial cells first join and form the beginning of the epithelium-lined biliary tree. They are recognized histologically as small, basophilic cells that form single-cell arrays or ductules with narrow lumens.

The relationship between the \"oval cells\" described in rodents and the ductular reaction still requires some clarification, but it is likely that the same cell type is involved. In addition, there may be progenitor cells among the mature biliary epithelial cells, and others may be marrow derived and blood-borne to the liver. Immunohistochemical staining of these cells in humans and rodents reveals that they contain cytokeratin markers of biliary epithelium and, simultaneously, hepatocyte markers such as albumin ( Fig.  2-41B ). Similar cells are present in animals as well. There are several circumstances that can trigger the ductular reaction other than massive necrosis, although this is the best recognized form. Both cholestasis and hypoxia can drive the ductular reaction causing proliferation in the periportal region for the former, and in the centrilobular region in the latter instance. The ability of these cells in the ductular reaction to differentiate into mature biliary or hepatocellular phenotypes is well established. It should be appreciated that in most clinical circumstances, hepatic regeneration is a less orderly process than that which occurs in healthy experimental animals.

In cases of acute or self-limited injury, fibrosis may resolve completely and normal liver architecture can be restored, but when damage is too extensive to be repaired, a scar may be permanent, and if the injury is persistent, there is progressive deposition of ECM, leading to the \"final common pathway\" and ending in fibrosis and cirrhosis. In normal liver, the ECM exists in a state of dynamic balance, with synthesis and degradation occurring in balance to maintain normal levels of all constituents. It is found in the portal tracts, along the sinusoids in the space of Disse, around the central vein and in Glisson's capsule. Normally, the hepatic ECM constitutes only 3% of the relative areas on a tissue section and only 0.5% of the total liver wet weight. The main constituents of the hepatic ECM are collagen, proteoglycans, laminin, fibronectin, and matricellular proteins. In the space of Disse, the matrix is composed primarily of collagens IV and VI. Following injury, however, fibrillar collagens I and III as well as fibronectin are deposited. These deposits disrupt the normal structure and function of the sinusoids, leading to capillarization of sinusoids, discussed later. The ECM is not merely scaffolding for the liver. It also functions as a repository for various growth factors and metalloproteinases in latent form, and it can bind a variety of survival factors, such as hepatocyte growth factor and TNF-\u03b1, that may protect the growth factors and inhibit hepatocyte apoptosis.

Ammonia is normally removed in the first pass of portal blood through the liver, wherein it is incorporated with carbon dioxide into carbamoyl phosphate that enters the urea cycle. In shunting or hepatic failure, ammonia that bypasses hepatic clearance accumulates in the circulation. Ammonia is able to cross the blood-brain barrier, and initially, this influx leads to astrocyte injury. Astrocytes are the site of ammonia detoxification in the brain, and they eliminate ammonia by the synthesis of glutamine through amidation of glutamate by the enzyme glutamine synthetase. Elevated blood ammonia increases the accumulation of glutamine in astrocytes, resulting in osmotic stress and astrocyte swelling caused by cytotoxic edema. Affected astrocytes that are adjacent to endothelium cannot maintain the blood-brain barrier, and this permits increased ammonia entry into the brain. Direct ammonia-induced effects on brain endothelial cells are also possible. Briefly, the consequences of increased ammonia in the brain include a net decrease in energy metabolism within the brain, increased edema formation because of astrocyte dysfunction, and injury to neurons, leading to an imbalance in neurotransmitters that emphasizes neural inhibition.",

In acute hepatic failure, cerebral edema may be the leading cause of death because of increased intracerebral pressure with possible herniation. The increase in intracranial pressure is, however, linked to brain ammonia levels. Currently, it is thought that swollen astrocytes release vasogenic factors, such as nitric oxide, causing intracerebral hyperemia, and that this leads to edema formation.

Hepatocellular uptake of unconjugated and conjugated bilirubin, like other organic ions, is mediated by members of the organic anion-transporting polypeptide (OATP) family found on the basolateral aspects of hepatocytes. Bilirubin is conjugated by uridine diphosphate-glucuronyl transferase in the endoplasmic reticulum of hepatocytes. From there it is transported into the bile. Bile acids are imported from the plasma by the Na + -taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide (NTCP). Transport of bile acids, the main osmotic driving force for bile formation (bile acid-dependent flow), into the canaliculus is performed by the bile salt export pump (BSEP). Aquaporin channels facilitate the movement of water into the canaliculus in response to the osmotic forces produced by the bile acids. Movement of bilirubin into the canaliculus for excretion is accomplished by the multidrug-resistance-associated protein-2 (MRP-2). Reduced glutathione is also a substrate for MRP-2, and it is reduced glutathione and bicarbonate that are the main elements of the bile acid-independent portion of bile flow, the second most significant force in bile flow.

Although hepatic insufficiency can increase glucagon levels in animal models, in dogs, the link between liver disease and hypoaminoacidemia remains unclear. A hypermetabolic state with exaggerated amino acid catabolism has, however, been suggested. Other biologically active molecules that are normally cleared by the normal liver or generated by a damaged liver should also be considered. ",

Gas bubbles generated by anaerobic saprophytes form first in the hepatic blood vessels, but soon suffuse large portions of the organ. The vessels and adjacent parenchyma are stained by hemoglobin. The substance of the organ becomes soft and clay-like, and the formation of putrefactive gases may make it foamy. On the capsular surface, irregular, pale foci are visible; they superficially may resemble infarcts or fatty areas but can be observed to increase in size during the postmortem interval, and microscopically are without cellular reaction. Bacilli are present in large numbers with systemic venous congestion (e.g., right-sided heart failure) or hypoproteinemia secondary to protein-losing renal or alimentary tract conditions. It is likely that ascites in advanced liver disease is influenced by both mechanical and dynamic influences on blood flow through a damaged liver. Reduced synthesis of albumin and globulins by the failing liver can reduce vascular oncotic pressure, but edema resulting from this mechanism is generalized. Experimentally, restriction of blood flow from the liver leads to a swift increase in sinusoidal plasma within the space of Disse, leading to increased lymph flow into the thoracic duct and through the hepatic capsule. This explains rapid ascites formation in cases of hepatic outflow obstruction or veno-occlusive diseases.",

            "text": "There are several theories that explain the complicated process of ascites formation in chronic liver disease. The theory that best encompasses the known circulatory changes is known as the peripheral arteriolar vasodilation hypothesis. In end-stage livers, there is progressive sinusoidal and portal vein hypertension with collateral vein formation and acquisition of shunting vessels to the systemic vasculature. Sinusoidal hypertension appears to be an important feature as ascites rarely develops with prehepatic portal hypertension. The main factor leading to ascites formation is splanchnic vasodilation. In chronic liver failure, there is increasing portal vein hypertension and a local release of vasodilators, such as nitric oxide, leading to splanchnic arterial dilation. With progression, the extent of the arterial vasodilation increases to the point that effective arterial volume and pressure drops, leading to activation of vasoconstrictor and antinatriuretic factors, including activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and the sympathetic nervous system, promoting retention of sodium and fluid. Intestinal capillary pressure and permeability are increased as a result of the increased portal vein hypertension, promoting excess fluid transit to the abdominal cavity. Over time, sodium retention by the kidneys is insufficient to compensate for the progressive arteriolar vasodilation as well as the movement of sodium and fluid to the extracellular space of the abdomen. This movement is enhanced by hypoproteinemia caused by reduced synthesis by the liver and dilution secondary to fluid retention. Consequently, there is persistent activation of antinatriuretic systems, and fluid continues to accumulate. There is evidence that increased venous return caused by reduced peripheral arterial vasodilation stimulates endogenous natriuretic substances, but this response is insufficient to counteract the more significant release of antinatriuretic signals.",

The intrinsic lobular pattern of the liver may be slightly more pronounced, particularly on the cut surface, because centrilobular areas are congested (dark red) in contrast to the more normal color of the remainder of the lobule.

Fatty change, trabecular atrophy, and necrosis of centrilobular hepatocytes with retention of the perisinusoidal reticulum framework develop quickly. Erythrocytes tend to move into the perisinusoidal spaces left by the lost hepatocytes, and may be seen trapped there when blood drains from sinusoids and veins in freshly fixed sections.

Peliosis hepatis lesions occur throughout the liver as dark red areas, irregular in shape but well circumscribed, and ranging from pinpoints to many centimeters in size ( Fig. 2-53, eFig 2-12) . Sectioned or capsular surfaces are depressed after death, and on cutting, they appear as cavities from which the blood drains to reveal a delicate network of residual stroma. The histologic lesion is characterized by multiple, dilated, blood-filled spaces sometimes surrounded by fibromyxoid stroma. The blood-filled cystic spaces may be lined by endothelium. In humans, these lesions have an idiosyncratic association with administration of various drugs, including anabolic and contraceptive steroids. Infectious peliosis hepatis caused by Bartonella henselae or B. quintana infection has also been described in immunosuppressed human patients.",

Primary alteration of the sinusoidal barrier, with rupture of the reticulin fibers and increased deposition of basement membrane components in the perisinusoidal region and fibrosis, may alter oxygen and substrate exchange between hepatocytes and the blood, leading to hemodynamic imbalance, hepatocyte atrophy, and eventually to sinusoidal disruption. Peliosis hepatis in livers is quite common in older cats and cattle ( Fig.  2-54 ). There is no evidence clinically of related liver dysfunction.

Acquired shunts can be associated with evidence of portal hypertension, such as distension of the portal veins and ascites, but when shunts are multiple and well established, portal hypertension is somewhat relieved. It is important to distinguish these varicose dilations that develop in response to portal hypertension from true congenital portosystemic shunts. Acquired shunts arise in vestigial nonfunctional portosystemic communications that dilate and become functional in response to portal hypertension. They tend to develop between mesenteric veins and the caudal vena cava, right renal vein, or gonadal veins, and are multiple, taking the form of a plexus of tortuous, thin-walled vessels. Esophageal shunts and varicosities are common in humans with cirrhosis, but are much less important in domestic animals.

            "text": "Peliosis hepatis is a term used to designate a hepatic vascular disorder characterized by cystic, blood-filled spaces in the liver. The distinction between telangiectasis and peliosis hepatis is subtle at best, and both conditions can be considered together. Microvascular permeability to plasma proteins, a hallmark of acute inflammation in most tissues, is a normal property of the fenestrated sinusoidal endothelium of the liver. Thus sinusoidal edema is not a prominent feature of acute parenchymal inflammation, although edema can be observed in the capsule, portal tracts, connective tissue of the terminal and sublobular hepatic veins (particularly in dogs), and in the wall of the gallbladder. Microvascular blood flow in hepatic sinusoids is also less responsive to the actions of various vasoactive mediators that alter blood flow in most other acutely inflamed tissues. Second, resident Kupffer cells play an important and complex role in liver inflammation, injury, and repair. Kupffer cells function in the innate immune response, acting as the final component of the gut barrier by phagocytosing pathogens, immunoreactive material, and endotoxin entering the liver via the portal circulation. However, Kupffer cells also exhibit a range of different activated phenotypes, depending on the local metabolic and immune environment. Classically activated macrophages secrete proinflammatory cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1, interleukin-1 (IL-1), IL-6, IL-12, and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), influencing cell populations in the liver and elsewhere, whereas alternatively, activated macrophages express anti-inflammatory mediators, including IL-10 and contribute to resolution of inflammation and promote repair. Dysregulation of the complex control of inflammatory responses in Kupffer cells can contribute to chronic inflammation in the liver. Third, the liver has central regulatory influences on many proinflammatory insults and inflammatory mediators. As the major source of acute-phase proteins, including secreted pathogen recognition receptors (PRRs), short pentraxins, components of the complement system, and regulators of iron metabolism, hepatocytes are essential constituents of innate immunity and largely contribute to the control of a systemic inflammatory response. The liver is also the site of degradation of most soluble plasma proteins, and Kupffer cells are the main site of clearance of immune complexes from the circulation, playing an important role in the development of immunotolerance to potential antigenic substances absorbed from the intestine. A full discussion of immune surveillance, and the complex innate and adaptive immune responses involved in initiation and regulation of liver inflammation, is beyond the scope of this chapter, and readers are directed to current review articles on the subject.",

The single designation \"chronic hepatitis\" is now used for chronic necroinflammatory disease lasting more than 6 months, further modified by specifying the etiology, type and severity of inflammation, and degree and distribution of apoptosis and/or necrosis (disease activity or grade), and the degree of fibrosis (disease chronicity or stage). Numerous systems for grading and staging chronic hepatitis have been developed. In human medicine, chronic hepatitis is usually the result of chronic infection with hepatotropic viruses, and, less commonly, autoimmune, drug-induced, or associated with inherited metabolic diseases, such as Wilson disease. In veterinary medicine, chronic liver disease may develop following chronic bile duct obstruction, infection with hepatotropic infectious agents, familial or hereditary metabolic diseases, or may be toxic, drug-induced, or possibly autoimmune in origin.

The liver is central to copper homeostasis, and biliary excretion is the major route for regulating levels of copper in the body. Hepatic copper accumulation can arise (1) as the result of a primary metabolic defect in hepatic copper metabolism, (2) secondary to abnormal hepatic function with cholestasis and altered biliary copper excretion, or (3) as a consequence of excess dietary copper intake.

A hereditary, autosomal recessive copper-associated hepatopathy associated with impaired biliary copper excretion and progressive accumulation of copper within hepatocytes has been well documented in Bedlington Terriers. The majority of affected Bedlington Terriers have been found deficient in a protein, COMMD1 (copper metabolism MURR1 domain protein 1), caused by deletion of exon 2 in the COMMD1 gene, although there are other less common mutations that can also occur. Although its function is not fully understood, the COMMD1 protein has been shown to interact with the copper transporter ATP7B, important in Wilson disease, a copper storage disorder in humans, and its absence in affected dogs may impair ATP7B-mediated copper export from hepatocytes into the canaliculus. Homozygous affected dogs have the highest copper levels.

These copper-laden lysosomes become consistently demonstrable by the histochemical stains rubeanic acid and rhodanine, at copper concentrations exceeding 400 \u00b5g/g DW (Fig. 2-57) , although some studies note visible copper granules at hepatic copper concentrations as low as 200 \u00b5g/g DW. A reasonable estimate of copper burden can be made from stained sections; however, biochemical determination of copper is more reliable and can be useful to follow the effectiveness of copper chelation therapy. Care should be taken when collecting liver for copper levels, as once the normal lobular architecture is lost because of injury and regenerative nodule formation, copper distribution within the liver becomes heterogeneous. Hepatocytes in regenerative nodules often have relatively low levels of copper, possibly as an adaptation that facilitates their ability to proliferate and form nodules, or as a function of inadequate time for significant copper accumulation in the hepatocytes forming nodules. The intervening areas of parenchymal collapse may contain an abundance of copper. Because of this regional variation, small samples, such as those taken from needle biopsies, are often inaccurate, and larger samples are required.",

A concurrent general increase in hepatic copper concentrations in a study population of Labrador Retrievers spanning 30 years was postulated to be associated with increased dietary copper availability, the result of a change in the form and bioavailability of supplemental copper added to commercially produced dog foods. A positive association between dietary copper levels and hepatic copper concentrations has been demonstrated, and high dietary copper has been suggested as a risk factor for development of copperassociated hepatitis in susceptible animals within the breed. Concurrent renal proximal tubular dysfunction with glucosuria, and increased renal copper has been described in some Labrador Retrievers with copper-associated hepatitis, and sporadically in other breeds.",

Clinical illness directly attributable to copper hepatotoxicity (concentrations >2,000 \u00b5g/g DW) in West Highland White Terriers is, however, apparently uncommon. Idiopathic chronic hepatitis progressing to cirrhosis does also occur in this breed, and may be distinguished on the basis of a different zonal location and morphology of the inflammatory lesions. In the idiopathic disease, inflammatory foci are smaller, composed of a single apoptotic hepatocyte or fragments of cells accompanied by a few lymphocytes and plasma cells, and are commonly localized to zone 1, or may be random in distribution. In dogs with copper toxicosis, foci of inflammation and necrosis were larger, always found around the central vein among copper-laden hepatocytes, and were composed of debris-filled macrophages, lymphocytes, plasma cells, and scattered neutrophils, with occasional apoptotic hepatocytes around the periphery. Distinguishing between copper toxicosis and idiopathic chronic hepatic disease may be difficult in cirrhotic livers, which, irrespective of the underlying cause, may have reduced copper burdens because of connectivetissue displacement of hepatic parenchyma, and typically lower concentrations of copper in regenerative nodules.",

Bexfield epiphenomenon or cause of chronic liver disease has not yet been proven. \u03b11-AT, a plasma glycoprotein synthesized mainly by hepatocytes, is a member of the serine proteinase inhibitor (serpin) superfamily, and is a potent inhibitor of neutrophil elastase. Hereditary \u03b11-AT deficiency in humans is associated with mutations that perturb the protein's tertiary structure and promote polymerization. These misfolded forms of \u03b11-AT accumulate within the rough endoplasmic reticulum of hepatocytes, forming PAS-positive globules. \u03b11-AT deficiency has been associated in humans with neonatal hepatitis, juvenile cirrhosis, and adult hepatocellular carcinoma. Lobular dissecting hepatitis, associated with predominantly sinusoidal inflammation and fibrosis, has been described in young dogs with ascites and acquired portosystemic shunts.

Within areas of duct obstruction, retention of bile pigments can be found in the regions served by the occluded ducts, but systemic icterus (or photosensitization in herbivores) is unlikely unless a large portion of liver is affected. On cut surface, the enlarged portal tracts are easily visible and accentuate the architecture of the organ. Eventually, the new fibrous tissue replaces the parenchyma, and in chronic diffuse cases in which the original infection persists, continuous fibroplasia may produce hepatic enlargement, the organ becoming huge, gray, and gristly. This spectrum of liver changes is typical of alsike clover poisoning (\"big-liver disease\") in horses (discussed in the later section on Toxic hepatic disease). Alternatively, the chronic fibrosis may occur in wedge-shaped areas oriented to a small bile duct. The enlarged interlobular ducts may be readily visible and frequently contain plugs of inspissated secretion and debris.",

Close to the portal triads, the hepatocytes may be nearly normal in appearance, except for loss of basophilia and the presence of a scattering of inclusion bodies. In spontaneously fatal cases, most of the parenchyma of the peripheral and central portions of the lobules (acini) is dead, the hepatocytes having undergone coagulative necrosis, and in some of these, ghosts of inclusion bodies may be detectable. The margin between necrotic parenchyma and viable tissue is usually quite sharp, although in the viable tissue, there are many individual hepatocytes undergoing apoptosis, most of them without inclusion bodies. Fatty change is common. The losses. Morbidity and mortality may occur in adult sheep; death sometimes occurs in adult cattle, but it is chiefly a disease of the young, causing heavy mortality among lambs, kids, and calves, and abortion in ewes, does, and cows. The infection in enzootic form is widespread in eastern and southern Africa, but it has, in plague-like proportions, extended to West Africa, Egypt, and the Arabian Peninsula. RVFV is a member of the Phlebovirus genus, 1 of the 5 genera in the family Bunyaviridae. It is transmitted by many species of mosquito of the genera Culex and Aedes, in which transovarial passage can occur. Mosquitoes, once infected, remain so, and in them, the virus is not pathogenic. High levels of viremia occur in sheep and cattle and are maintained for up to 5 days. During epizootics, the virus may be spread by fomites, aerosols, and mechanically by other biting insects.",

One of 4 horses experimentally inoculated with the virus developed elevated serum liver enzymes.

About the tunnels is a narrow zone of coagulative necrosis, also produced by the flukes. As usual, the necrotic tissue is demarcated by a thin zone of scavenger cells, chiefly neutrophils. If latent spores are present in the necrotic areas, they quickly vegetate and are visible in sections as large, gram-positive bacilli. In nonimmune animals, the vegetative organisms elaborate exotoxins that cause necrosis of the surrounding tissue, including the eosinophils of the fluke tunnel. As the area of necrosis expands, the bacterial proliferation keeps pace so that bacilli can be found in all parts of the necrotic focus but not in the surrounding viable tissue. Usually, bacteria are concentrated at the advancing margin of the lesion, just inside a zone of infiltrated neutrophils. At about the time of death and immediately afterward, the bacilli scatter in the liver and to other organs.",

Those parasites that have the biliary system as their final habitat will be discussed in detail later. The others produce hepatic lesions in the course of their natural or accidental migrations, and are discussed under the organ (for most of them, the gut) that is their final habitat. It is useful, however, to describe briefly here the lesions produced by larvae in transit. The initial lesion produced by wandering larvae is traumatic. Sinuous tunnels permeate the parenchyma and often breach the capsule. In the tunnels, there are free red cells, degenerating hepatocytes, and leukocytes, chiefly eosinophils, which react to the parasites. Bordering the tunnel is a narrow zone of coagulative necrosis of parenchyma with neutrophils at its margin. Eosinophils also infiltrate the portal triads. The necrotic parasitic tracts heal by scarification, and the fibroblastic tissue, infiltrated with eosinophils, is eventually incorporated into the portal units. Most larvae escape from the liver, but some eventually become encapsulated in the liver in abscesses containing numerous eosinophils. The abscesses may caseate and come to resemble tubercles, and eventually many are heavily mineralized to form permanent pearly nodules. In sheep, the most common cause of this type of hepatitis (aside from liver fluke) is Cysticercus tenuicollis in its wandering phase.

Patent infestations can develop in other wild and domestic animals and in humans. These flukes are leaf shaped and ~2.5 cm long in sheep and slightly larger in cattle. They are found in the bile ducts. Being hermaphroditic, only one fluke is necessary to establish a patent infestation, and each adult may produce 20,000 eggs per day. The longevity of the adult flukes is amazing and is potentially as great as or greater than that of the host; they have been known to survive for 11 years, and it seems that they can produce eggs all this time. The eggs are eliminated in bile, and on pasture, in conditions of suitable warmth and moisture, hatch a larva (miracidium) in ~9 days. If the environmental temperature is low, the incubation period may be delayed for some months. The miracidium can survive only in moisture. It is actively motile and penetrates the tissues of the intermediate host, which is an aquatic snail. Different snails serve this purpose in different countries, but all of them belong to the genus Lymnaea.",

            "text": "Each miracidium, on penetrating a snail, develops into a mother sporocyst that reproduces, probably parthenogenetically, giving rise to a small number of the second generation, the redia. Each redia produces either redia or cercariae, or to the 2 successively. Cercariae, the larval stage of the third (sexual) generation, first appear 1-2 months after the miracidium penetrates. Cercariae continue to escape daily for the life of the snail, but even so, total cercarial production is only 500-1,000. They actively escape from the snail and are attracted to green plants, where they encyst and become infective metacercariae in 1 day. These can remain infective for 1 month in summer and up to 3 months in winter. The developmental events from egg to this stage take 1-2 months under favorable conditions. Infestation occurs by ingestion. Excystment occurs in the duodenum. The young flukes penetrate the intestinal wall and stage is an alveolar hydatid cyst, composed of numerous small vesicles lined by a PAS-positive acellular laminated membrane or cuticle layer and a layer of germinal epithelium from which protoscolices develop. Some infections in dogs do not progress to form protoscolices, and instead form irregular large cysts with a PAS-positive laminated membrane (Fig. 2-85) . Additional exogenous budding results in spread of the metacestodes to other internal locations. The life cycle is completed when the infected intermediate host is consumed by a definitive host, where the protoscolices attach to the intestinal wall and mature. Other species can occasionally act as aberrant intermediate hosts, including pigs, horses, and humans; human alveolar echinococcosis is a serious zoonosis. Dogs can simultaneously act as definitive and intermediate hosts for this parasite. Cases of hepatic alveolar hydatid cysts have been reported in dogs from highly endemic areas in Belgium, Germany, Switzerland, and most recently in Canada (British Columbia, Ontario). Affected dogs display progressive abdominal enlargement, intermittent inappetance, and vomiting, and the cysts may be found in the liver, omentum, abdominal cavity, or lungs. moderate irregular fibrosis. There may, as yet, be no change in the bile ducts. Probably, most of the young flukes reach the bile ducts, but some do not and become encysted in the parenchyma. One or more flukes may be present in each cyst, which consists of a connective-tissue capsule and a dirty brown content of blood, detritus, and excrement from flukes. The cysts ultimately caseate and may mineralize or are obliterated by fibrous tissue. These cysts are most frequent on the visceral surface, where they cause bulging of the capsule.",

From the hilus, the bile ducts on the visceral surface stand out as white, firm, branching cords that in extreme instances may be 2 cm in diameter and allow detectable fluctuation over extended segments or in localized areas of ectasia. This dilation of the ducts in sheep, swine, and horses is largely mechanical and is caused by distension by masses of flukes and bile. It is permitted by the relative paucity of new connectivetissue formation in the walls of the ducts in these species; this in turn is probably related to the rather mild catarrhal type of inflammation in the lumina of the ducts. In cattle, desquamative and ulcerative lesions in the large bile ducts are more severe than in other species, and there is a correspondingly greater proliferation of granulation tissue in and about the walls of the ducts (Fig. 2-86) . The walls of the ducts in cattle are, in consequence, much thickened, and the lumen is irregularly stenotic and dilated and lined largely by granulation tissue. This contributes the typical \"pipe stem\" appearance to the ducts in cattle; the connective tissue may be, in addition, cross the peritoneal cavity, attaching here and there to suck blood and penetrate the liver through its capsule; a few no doubt pass in the portal vessels or migrate up the bile duct. They wander in the liver for a month or more before settling down in the bile ducts to mature, which they do in 2-3 months. Some may, by accident, enter the hepatic veins and systemic circulation to lodge in unusual sites; intrauterine infestations are on record. Lesions caused by aberrant flukes are quite common in bovine lung. They consist of resilient nodules just under the pleura of the peripheral parts of the lung. They range in diameter from ~1 to many centimeters and consist of thinly encapsulated abscesses situated at the ends of bronchi. The content is slightly mucoid, unevenly coagulated brown fluid; in some lesions, the reaction is predominantly caseous. The location of the lesion suggests that it begins as a peripheral bronchiectasis that later becomes sealed off. The fluke persists in the debris, but is small and hard to find.",

Most xenobiotics are unable to directly enter the hepatocyte and require specific transporters to pass through the lipid bilayer of the hepatocyte membrane.

These transporters are members of a large group of sodiumindependent solute transporters known as organic anion transporting polypeptides (OATP). Xenobiotics may be concentrated in hepatocytes to various degrees by mechanisms that remain obscure, but which are associated with special binding proteins of hepatocytes, attachment to enzymatic sites where metabolic conversions occur, and inhibition of export into the bile. The liver is exposed to high concentrations of toxic metabolites because of its role as the primary site of biotransformation for many therapeutic agents and endogenous substances. Some metabolites may produce hepatocellular injury, and others may cause biliary injury once they are transported into the canaliculi. Certain drug metabolites may be reabsorbed in the enterohepatic circulation in a fashion similar to bile acids, facilitating repeated exposure to the drug in question.

Following exposure to injurious compounds, the inflammatory response, particularly the innate immune response, can significantly influence the extent of hepatocellular injury. Studies using acetaminophen have provided most relevant information on this issue; however, the effects of inflammation are complex, and not all studies are in agreement. There are conflicting studies demonstrating either proinflammatory or anti-inflammatory effects of Kupffer cells following drug-induced injury. Some clarification of this controversy has been facilitated by the identification of subsets of intrahepatic macrophages following injury. In addition to the resident Kupffer cells, a population of infiltrating macrophages can be detected quite soon (within 12 hours) after acetaminophen intoxication. There are 2 major phenotypes of intrahepatic macrophages. M1 macrophages are proinflammatory, a source for tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1, interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2) and nitric oxide, which stimulates hepatocellular injury, and these macrophages constitute the majority of the Kupffer cell population. M2 macrophages are anti-inflammatory, secreting IL-10-, IL-6-and IL-18-binding proteins, which modulate inflammation, and comprise the majority of the infiltrating macrophages. Stimulation of other members of the innate immune system, such as natural killer and natural killer T cells can accentuate acetaminophen toxicity. Neutrophils recruited to the liver by the release of damage-associated molecular pattern (DAMP) molecules from necrotic hepatocytes also augment tissue injury.

Cholestatic injury is a reflection of failure of bile excretion associated with biliary epithelial or canalicular injury or other alteration of bile secretion, and displays the features of obstructive jaundice. The typical histologic manifestation consists of bile casts in canalicular spaces, with variable parenchymal injury. An exception to this pattern can be seen in some plant intoxications, such as those produced by steroidal sapogenins and Lantana spp., which can cause cholestasis with minimal evidence of canalicular plugging.

The latter have been somewhat arbitrarily divided into acute and chronic, and although it is recognized that the difference between acute and chronic hepatotoxicity is often simply a matter of dose rate, it is convenient to categorize the sources according to the syndrome of liver damage that they most commonly produce. Various plants and moldy feeds are hepatotoxic, and some phytotoxins (e.g., pyrrolizidine alkaloids) and mycotoxins (e.g., aflatoxins) are notorious hepatotoxins and hepatocarcinogens. Many phytotoxins and mycotoxins target other organ systems or have physiologic rather than pathologic effects. Some of those that cause diagnostic lesions are discussed under the respective target tissues elsewhere. Generally, these areas of toxicology are better accessed in comprehensive references on phytotoxins or mycotoxins. sufficient fibrinogen to form a loose, nonadherent clot. The appearance of the liver depends on the severity and stage of the injury. Severe acute toxicity that destroys endothelium typically results in a hemorrhagic zonal pattern, in which case the liver may be deep red-purple and obviously swollen and turgid. In less severe injury without hemorrhage, the liver tends to be lighter brown because of a combination of edema (exclusion of sinusoidal blood), destruction of cytochrome pigments, and accumulation of bile pigments and/or fat. If the animal survives for several days, the liver develops a typical zonal yellow fatty change as triglyceride accumulates in sublethally injured hepatocytes.",

            "text": "The anticonvulsant drugs primidone, phenytoin, and phenobarbital have been associated with the development of chronic hepatic disease and cirrhosis in dogs. These drugs, used either alone or in combination, can cause biochemical and clinical signs of hepatic dysfunction in up to 14% of dogs treated for >6 months, but only a small percentage of cases progress to cirrhosis and hepatic failure. Currently, monitoring blood levels and adjusting dosages of these drugs to a nontoxic level has significantly reduced the incidence of liver injury. The most consistent histologic finding in the majority of dogs treated with phenobarbital is proliferation of the hepatocellular smooth endoplasmic reticulum resulting from induction of microsomal enzymes, including various subfamilies of cytochrome P450. This results in hepatocellular swelling with fine diffuse granularity, a so-called \"ground-glass\" appearance to hepatocyte cytoplasm. This histologic change is an adaptive response, reflected clinically by increases in serum concentrations of alkaline phosphatase, alanine aminotransferase, and \u03b3-glutamyl transpeptidase, but is not indicative of hepatocellular injury. Actual hepatotoxicity may represent an idiosyncratic reaction in a small percentage of treated dogs, although the possibility of dose-dependent intrinsic hepatotoxicity with long-term treatment has not been ruled out. It is also possible that the enzyme induction associated with anticonvulsant therapy may alter the ability of the liver to detoxify other nonspecified compounds that could be the effectors of liver damage. Certainly, enzyme induction may alter the pharmacokinetics of other co-administered drugs. Chronic hepatitis associated with anticonvulsant therapy is characterized by bridging portal fibrosis, biliary hyperplasia, nodular regeneration, and mild inflammatory cell infiltrates. A separate syndrome of cholestatic hepatotoxic injury with jaundice has also been described in dogs receiving high doses of phenytoin in combination with primidone or phenobarbital. This is characterized by intrahepatic cholestasis, with hepatocellular swelling, vacuolation, and small multifocal areas of hepatocellular necrosis, and has been suggested to represent a metabolic disturbance rather than direct cytotoxic hepatocellular injury. Hepatocutaneous syndrome (superficial necrolytic dermatitis) associated with typical hepatic pathology of parenchymal collapse, vacuolation, and nodular regeneration has also been reported as a separate syndrome in dogs with a history of chronic phenobarbital therapy.",

Other species of cyanobacteria, such as Nodularia spumigenia found in New Zealand and the Baltic region, contain different, but still potent toxins such as nodularin. Ruminants are most commonly poisoned, but poisoning has been reported in horses, sheep, dogs, and domestic poultry. The cyanobacterial toxin is released when the microorganisms disintegrate, which may occur spontaneously in bodies of water or after the application of copper sulfate for algae control, or in the rumen or stomach after ingestion. Microcystin-LR is very stable and persists in water at typical ambient conditions, with a 10-week half-life. It is stable following boiling as well. The toxin is taken into hepatocytes by organic anion-transporting polypeptide (OATP) membrane transporters and causes cell damage by inhibiting cytoplasmic protein phosphatase 1 and 2A. This leads to disorganization of hepatocyte and endothelial cytoskeletal actin filaments, and disruption of their shape and integrity, leading to necrosis, apoptosis, and perisinusoidal hemorrhage. The distribution of the necrosis is usually centrilobular to massive. The pattern may vary within the individual liver and from case to case. In subacute intoxications, the liver is severely fatty, and necrosis is limited to individual hepatocytes or small groups, rather than being zonal. Phagolysosomes and bile pigments accumulate in the cytoplasm, and there is slight biliary proliferation and fibrosis. Necrosis of the renal tubules can also occur. Diagnosis can be made by detection of microcystin in vomitus or liver.",

The genus Amanita contains several species, including A. phalloides, A. verna, A. virosa, and A. ocreata , which are considered extremely toxic. These mushrooms are mycorrhizal with various species of deciduous and coniferous trees, and may be found in urban, suburban, and rural areas. The amanitins are bicyclic octapeptides, ingestion of which is responsible for gastroenteritis, hypoglycemia, and fulminant liver failure in humans, dogs, cats, cattle, and other animals. They are stable compounds and persist in the acid environment of the stomach and following cooking. Amanitin is transported from the systemic circulation to hepatocytes by a specific OATP transporter on the hepatocyte surface. Toxicity is accentuated by enterohepatic circulation of the toxin, causing repeated hepatic exposure. Amanitin inhibits nuclear RNA polymerase II, thus interfering with transcription and inhibiting protein synthesis, resulting in cell death. Dogs or cats dying after ingestion of Amanita spp. have massive hepatocellular necrosis with focal areas of hemorrhage (see Fig. 2-93) . Surviving periportal hepatocytes have vesicular nuclei with loss or fragmentation of nucleoli, consistent with ultrastructural reports of chromatin condensation, dissolution of the nucleolus, and decline in nucleolar RNA content. Necrosis of the proximal convoluted tubules often accompanies the hepatic injury and can aid in the index of suspicion for amanitin intoxication. Because the histologic lesions are nonspecific, and previously, it was difficult to obtain a definitive diagnosis of amanitin intoxication, under-diagnosis was likely. Confirmatory testing consumption of plants by herbivores has competitive or neutral advantage for the plant, especially those that are lush and prolific, so toxicity is counterproductive or unnecessary. However, in arid or semiarid habitats, plants must put up more resistance to herbivores that could obliterate them. Indigenous herbivores are typically reluctant to do this, and are either resistant or reluctant to graze some plants. Plants sometimes protect critical parts at particular stages of growth. For example, Xanthium pungens (Noogoora burr) concentrates its toxin in the cotyledons. The seeds are rarely eaten, even by cattle, but intoxications can occur when this plant is eaten shortly after germination. Phytotoxic liver disease is therefore more frequently encountered in animals grazing pastures at particular times of the year, with limited choice or supply, or when hungry animals are introduced to plants for which their natural or induced resistance is low. The patterns of liver disease resulting from consumption of toxic plants are for the most part quite consistent in comparison with what is seen with exposure to other classes of hepatotoxins. An exhaustive review of the toxicity of all such plants would be repetitive. However, some plants that do produce more distinctive patterns of liver lesions will be discussed in more detail.",

A small amount may be lost by vomition, as elemental phosphorus is directly irritating to the gastrointestinal tract. The mechanism of phosphorus hepatotoxicity is uncertain. It is apparent that metabolism to a toxic intermediate is not necessary, but there is some dispute on the involvement of lipoperoxidation in the hepatocellular injury. There is evidence that protein synthesis is impaired early and that this is responsible for the lipid accumulation that is a prominent feature. A few hours after ingestion of phosphorus, there is severe colic and vomition. If the animal survives this acute phase, there may be apparent recovery for a few days, followed by jaundice and other signs of liver failure, and death by about the fifth day. At postmortem, there is severe icterus and fatty liver, the latter sometimes being predominantly periportal in distribution. Hepatocellular known of which is ngaione, which are responsible for intoxication. Twenty-four to 48 hours may elapse before signs of toxicity appear. Gross lesions include widespread hemorrhage and a pale yellow liver. Histologically, the pattern is unusual, as the injury to the hepatocytes occurs in periportal or midzonal regions accompanied by biliary hyperplasia (Fig. 2-95A, B) . Some animals live long enough to become photosensitized; others may die much more rapidly, with pulmonary edema. The edema appears to be a direct effect of the toxin after its metabolism by the club cells (formerly Clara cells) of the airway.",

The enlargement may be partly the result of hypertrophy of hepatocellular smooth endoplasmic reticulum and some degree of fatty change. As the level of aflatoxin in the ration increases (in young pigs, e.g., to 1.0 mg/kg ration), the liver may show all or none of the following changes: pallor, enlargement, bile staining, increased firmness because of fibrogenesis, and fine nodular regenerative hyperplasia. There may also be edema of the gallbladder and bile-tinged ascites in more severe cases. Even under experimental conditions, some individuals may show minimal liver lesions, whereas others, under the same levels of exposure, die of liver failure. Histologically, affected livers show obvious increase in size of some hepatocytes and their nuclei (megalocytosis) with focal necrosis or apoptosis. Bile ductules proliferate early, and reticulin and collagen deposition occurs throughout the acinus according to no distinct pattern (Fig. 2-96) . Fatty change in affected livers is variable in extent and occurrence, and bile pigments accumulate in canaliculi and hepatocytes in more severely affected livers. Minor degrees of megalocytosis may be seen in proximal tubular epithelium in the kidney. The changes produced resemble those of pyrrolizidine alkaloid toxicosis.

The main genera responsible for plant toxicoses in domestic mammals are Senecio, Crotalaria, Heliotropium, Cynoglossum, Amsinckia, Echium, and Trichodesma, and are widely distributed around the world. Intoxication is relatively infrequent because most plants containing pyrrolizidines are unpalatable. Contamination of baled or cubed forage with toxic plants is a common route of exposure. The seeds are also toxic, and the small seeds of Amsinckia and Crotalaria may, depending on harvesting technique, heavily contaminate other harvested grains used in prepared pig and poultry feeds. More than 350 pyrrolizidine alkaloids have been identified chemically, and most of the toxic plant species contain more than one of the alkaloids. So far, only a small proportion of the known alkaloids have well-characterized toxicity; these are all esters of 1 of 3 amino alcohol bases (necines) or acids (necic acids). The retronecine group includes monocrotaline, retrorsine, retronecine, ridelliine, senecionine, and jacobine, and the heliotridine group includes lasiocarpine and heliotrine. These toxins must be metabolized to more reactive forms for toxicity. Cytochromes P450 mediate the N-oxidation of the necine bases. They can also mediate the 2-step hydroxylation of the necine bases at the C3 and C8 positions; this is followed by spontaneous dehydration to the highly reactive dehydropyrrolizidine (DHP) alkaloids. The toxic DHP alkaloids are electrophilic and can bind covalently to amino acids, proteins, and nucleic acids at guanine and adenine residues. Acute toxicity derives from damage to cellular proteins. Antimitotic effects can be exerted via damage to microtubules. The DNA-binding activity is responsible for genotoxicity; the DHP-derived of unconjugated sporidesmin in bile, where its concentration may initiate oxidative injury, likely mediated by the production of a hydroxyl radical. Sporidesmin is also excreted in urine, and if the dose is high enough, edema and mucosal hemorrhage occur in the bladder. The hepatic lesion is the result of irritation of mesenchymal tissues in the portal triads and surrounding the bile ducts. A high concentration of sporidesmin can injure biliary epithelium, allowing diffusion of the bile duct contents.

There is extensive necrosis of the lining of the larger intrahepatic ducts and the extrahepatic ducts, the epithelium being cast off as debris mixed with a few leukocytes. There is In chronic pyrrolizidine alkaloid poisoning, the liver can become atrophic as hepatocytes are lost faster than they can be replaced. The atrophy can be compensated to various degrees by megalocytosis and regeneration of small, less inhibited hepatocytes that proliferate in a nodular pattern. Concurrently, there is usually proliferation of bile duct epithelial cells (termed ductular reaction) in the portal triads. This is largely explained by the propensity of hepatic progenitor cells to proliferate forming ductules when adult hepatocytes cannot respond to the regenerative stimuli that prevail when liver mass is inadequate. There may also be some periportal fibroplasia that varies with species and exposure; typically, it is minimal in sheep, moderate in horses, and may be marked in cattle . In cattle, the fibrous tissue can infiltrate along the sinusoids to dissect lobules, separate individual cells, and link up with the walls of efferent veins. In acute poisoning, in which there is centrilobular necrosis, fibrosis can also develop in a \"veno-occlusive\" pattern around and sometimes obliterating the hepatic venules. There is evidence that pyrrolizidine metabolite injury is not restricted to hepatocytes and that endothelial cells are also involved, leading to additional vascular insult and fibrosis in the liver. Direct endothelial injury from pyrrolizidines may occur, but an alternative explanation proposes a form of \"bystander\" injury, where toxic metabolites are formed in hepatocytes but are able to damage adjacent endothelial cells. This pattern of fibrosis may occur in some field cases in cattle, but is more commonly observed in humans exposed to pyrrolizidine alkaloids in herbal preparations or \"bush teas,\" and it can be produced experimentally after sublethal acute experimental hepatotoxicity. In fatal cases in cattle, the livers are very tough and nodular, and the nodules have variably efficient biliary drainage and cytochrome expression, so there may be a very striking color pattern, ranging from fatty yellow through green and brown. Hepatic fibrosis can result in portal hypertension with ascites, severe mesenteric edema, and diarrhea. Excretory insufficiency with moderate jaundice and photosensitization can also occur.",

            "text": "The toxicity of a pyrrolizidine alkaloid-containing plant depends on many factors. The content of toxin varies by species of plant; the stage of growth, as new growth tends to have more toxin in general; and the time of year and environmental factors such as rainfall. For an individual pyrrolizidine alkaloid, toxicity depends on the amount of alkaloid that can be converted to reactive metabolites, the rate of cytochrome P450mediated generation of the DHP, and the efficiency of detoxification by glutathione conjugation. Toxicity also depends on the species exposed, age and sex of the animal intoxicated, and the metabolic activity and the mitotic stage of its target cells. Young animals are generally much more susceptible than adults. Grazing animals are more likely to consume plants that contain pyrrolizidine alkaloids, but because the toxins are produced by the plants to deter herbivores, it is unusual for an animal to consume large amounts. Ruminants, especially sheep and goats, are much less susceptible than pigs, in part because the toxins can be degraded in the rumen. However, sheep can graze out stands of Senecio that would be lethal to cattle. Horses and cattle have similar, intermediate susceptibilities. Most pyrrolizidine alkaloids are hepatotoxic because they are metabolically activated to DHPs in the liver. There are 3 common morphologic expressions of pyrrolizidine poisoning. First, acute centrilobular to massive necrosis occurs in animals ingesting large amounts of these alkaloids. Because the plants responsible are unpalatable, naturally occurring outbreaks of acute poisoning are generally restricted to circumstances where animals face starvation, such as grazing pastures affected by prolonged drought. Ingested dosages in grazing circumstances are usually too low for acute effects; however, acute hemorrhagic centrilobular necrosis has been described after experimental exposures to high doses of pyrrolizidine alkaloids. The centrilobular pattern of necrosis produced is similar to that caused by many other hepatotoxins that are bioactivated by hepatic cytochromes P450. Second, phasic (usually seasonal) repetitive exposure to these alkaloids leads to hepatic atrophy with formation of regenerative nodules. This is the most common expression of field exposure to pyrrolizidine alkaloids, and affected livers show a characteristic pattern of hepatocellular polyploidy known as megalocytosis (Fig. 2-99) . Third, prolonged exposure exclusively to Heliotropium induces firm, fibrotic atrophic livers without nodular regeneration. If seasonal exposure to these toxic alkaloids declines, then a remarkable degree of recovery is possible.",

Similar disease has been reported in ruminants intoxicated by Agave lecheguilla, Nolena texana, and the pasture species Brachiaria decumbens (signal grass) in Brazil. In New Zealand, crystal deposition in the biliary tree of cattle has been reported following ingestion of Phytolacca octandra (inkweed). In those cases studied (T. terrestris, P. dichotomiflorum, P. schinzii, Narthecium ossifragum), the characteristic crystalloid material deposited in the bile is principally composed of calcium salts of steroidal sapogenins. In some cases, crystal formation may not be apparent in bile ducts, and affected Kupffer cells and macrophages are more evident. There may be differences in the histologic responses of cattle and sheep grazing various sapinogenincontaining plants. Foamy Kupffer cells and hepatocytes along with foamy macrophages in mesenteric and hepatic lymph nodes may be a more common response in cattle versus crystal formation within bile ducts in sheep ( Fig. 2-101) . To complicate diagnostic efforts, foamy macrophages in the mesenteric and hepatic lymph nodes are also found in healthy cattle and sheep grazing B. decumbens in Brazil. With the exception of Nolena texana, steroidal sapogenins have been demonstrated in all of these plants. As with T. terrestris, extracts of B. decumbens containing steroidal saponins produced typical lesions of cholangitis with crystal deposition when orally administered to lambs, with Pithomyces chartarum spore counts below detectable levels. Similarly, analysis of samples of B. decumbens and P. dichotomiflorum on which cattle and goats had recently been photosensitized showed only low levels of P. chartarum spores, and all isolates obtained failed to produce sporidesmin.

Levels of saponins have been shown to vary greatly within a species from site to site, and with the age of the plant. Additionally, the role of sporadic environmental conditions, such as wilting, which might concentrate the saponins or other unidentified toxins, or the synergistic involvement of endophytic fungi, remains to be determined.

Histologically, lesions begin as vacuolation of a narrow band of centrilobular hepatocytes, followed shortly by accumulation of mononuclear inflammatory cells in this zone and in the stoma of the hepatic venules (eFig. 2-30B). Progression of the lesion is marked by scattered necrosis of a widening zone of centrilobular hepatocytes, disorganization, vacuolation because of fatty change, and accumulation of ceroid pigment in macrophages. Moderate centrilobular fibrosis is seen in later stages, as well as pronounced canalicular cholestasis. By this stage, affected animals begin to show icterus, inappetance, and depression. Bile ductular proliferation is not a marked feature. Death is attended by the usual signs of hepatoencephalopathy and tendency to bleed spontaneously. There is no evidence of direct neurologic damage as is seen in horses. More recently, dogs ingesting canned commercial camel meat developed serious and sometimes fatal liver disease. This may be a concern for dogs with food allergies that are fed nonstandard protein sources in special diets. This intoxication is remarkable by virtue of its unpredictability. Experimental intoxication by pure indospicine has validly been shown to reproduce the naturally occurring intoxication caused by horsemeat feeding; however, liver failure can be produced by either means in only a small proportion of dogs so exposed. On the other hand, milder degrees of liver damage are reliably produced by both methods. Thus it seems an idiosyncratic response is superimposed upon a more consistent effect of the toxin; the nature of the accompanying inflammatory response suggests that the former may be immunologically mediated. This has yet to be established, as has the proposal that the mechanism of the intoxication is the result of competitive inhibition of arginine.",

Second, increased copper accumulation occurs as a result of increased availability of dietary copper; this happens when dietary levels of molybdenum are unusually low. Molybdenum, in the presence of sufficient sulfate, forms insoluble complexes with copper in the gut and liver, making the copper biologically inert. Subterranean clover growing on calcareous soils in southern Australia may be relatively deficient in molybdenum, and in these areas, British breeds of sheep are known to be more susceptible than Merinos to chronic copper poisoning. Other hepatotoxins constitute the third environmental factor that predisposes sheep to outbreaks of chronic copper poisoning.

However, copper is toxic at excess concentrations because of its 2 redox states that can mediate free-radical production, resulting in direct oxidation of cellular components. The liver is the major organ involved in the regulation of copper levels, and homeostasis is maintained by the balance of dietary intake and copper excretion via the bile. Dietary copper is taken up by the enterocytes of the small intestine by dedicated transporters, divalent metal transporter (DMT1) and copper transporter 1 (Ctr1), and conveyed in the portal blood bound to carrier proteins ceruloplasmin and transcuprein, or in a nonspecific fashion to albumin, to the liver for uptake. In the hepatocyte, copper is sequestered in metallothionein or glutathione. Excretion into the bile or blood is regulated by a series of specific chaperone proteins, such as the coppertransporting ATPase ATP7A. Excess copper is stored in lysosomes. Copper-induced injury is produced by oxidative processes that initially reduce available glutathione and eventually damages lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids. Cellular metabolism, structural integrity, and energy generation are affected. Hepatic copper toxicosis can result from a primary metabolic defect in hepatic copper metabolism, altered hepatic biliary excretion of copper, or from excess dietary intake of the element.",

            "text": "These primitive highly toxic microorganisms can flourish as a seasonal bloom on lakes and ponds that have accumulated phosphates and nitrates as runoff from fertilized soils. Outbreaks of poisoning are not common, but they occur in many countries and may be responsible for heavy mortality among mammals or birds that drink from affected bodies of water. Most well-documented cases have involved Microcystis aeruginosa, which may poison stock after the bloom has been piled by wind against the shores of expanses of water. Other toxic species are included in the genera Anabaena and Aphanizomenon. Some deaths are too sudden to be caused by liver damage and are probably the result of the \"fast-death factor\" that has been found in some blooms. The syndrome is one of collapse and prostration, with hyperesthesia that may be radioactivity is removed during the first passage through the liver. Most of the copper is sequestered in hepatocellular lysosomes, where it does little damage at concentrations of up to 200-300 \u00b5g/g dry weight. As the concentration rises, there is presumably more interaction between other cell components and the copper. There is some evidence that lysosomal membranes lose integrity and allow copper and lysosomal hydrolases to damage the rest of the cytoplasm. By the time the liver copper concentration has reached 300 \u00b5g/g or more, there is a histologically apparent increase in hepatocellular turnover, with single hepatocytes undergoing apoptosis within a dense knot of neutrophils. At still higher copper levels, the apoptotic rate increases, while all cells become swollen and their nuclei vesicular. The mitotic rate increases, presumably to keep pace with the accelerated loss of hepatocytes, and large macrophages appear in the sinusoids and stromal spaces about the vessels. These cells contain eosinophilic or somewhat brown, granular debris, which consists of coppercontaining lipofuscins.Sheep with liver copper concentrations >1,000 \u00b5g/g may be clinically and hematologically normal, so long as the increasing mitotic rate produces enough new hepatocytes to take up the copper released by dying cells. At this stage, however, there will be elevated levels of liver-specific enzymes in the plasma. If the rate of hepatocellular loss exceeds the capacity of the liver to phagocytose and sequester cell debris quickly, the plasma copper levels can rise to levels that are high enough to damage circulating erythrocytes, and intravascular hemolysis ensues. The effect of the hemolysis and anemia on the liver is to accelerate the rate of hepatocellular necrosis; thus copper enters the circulation at an increasing rate and acute copper toxic crisis is manifest. The lethal clinical syndrome is then one of paroxysmal intravascular hemolysis and liver failure, in which a sheep may pass from apparent good health to death within ~6 hours. Stresses, such as brief starvation, may also precipitate the crisis in susceptible sheep, but the mechanisms involved are unknown. During the hemolytic crisis, some of the copper is lost from the disintegrating liver; some passes into the urine, and kidney copper concentration rises to 1,000 \u00b5g/g or more. Blood or kidney copper levels therefore give a truer indication of a prior hemolytic crisis caused by chronic copper poisoning than does elevation of liver copper alone.The gross lesions of fatal chronic copper poisoning are those of acute copper toxicity. The carcass is discolored by marked icterus, superimposed on which is the red color imparted by free hemoglobin. Often, there is a brown hue as well, because a proportion of the hemoglobin is oxidized to methemoglobin. The spleen is engorged, dark, and soft. The kidneys are deep red-brown to black and the urine deep red, as a result of hemoglobinuria with oxidation to methemoglobin, and concurrent icterus. The liver is often slightly soft and swollen, and deep orange, but if the condition arises after long-term liver injury, atrophy and fibrosis may be evident. The spectrum of liver lesions can be complicated by other causes of liver necrosis, including hypoxia caused by anemia, heart failure, and shock.A breed of sheep from the Hebridean island of North Ronaldsay has apparently adapted to a seaweed diet low in both copper and molybdenum but rich in zinc. Zinc is also capable of interfering with copper uptake, and these sheep, although avoiding copper deficiency, are exquisitely susceptible to chronic copper poisoning when transferred to normal 343.e1 eFigure 2-31 The acute bovine liver disease syndrome is characterized by periportal necrosis of hepatocytes and bile duct proliferation. (Courtesy R. Kelly.) Ectopic, metaplastic, and hyperplastic lesions Ectopic and metaplastic lesions in the gallbladder have been reported. Ectopic tissue includes hepatocyte nodules attached to or within the wall, and pancreatic islands, which may include islets of Langerhans. Gastric ectopia, readily distinguishable by the presence of chief and parietal cells, may form plaques or large polyps. Ectopia of cardiac or pyloric mucosa is mimicked by metaplastic changes.Nodular hyperplasia of hepatocytes is common in old dogs, but rare in other species. The lesions in dogs do not have a breed or sex predisposition, but their incidence increases sharply with age. Hyperplastic nodules typically develop in livers of normal mass, whereas regenerative nodules arise as a result of compensatory hyperplasia of surviving hepatocytes in a background of hepatic injury, atrophy, and fibrosis (see Responses of the liver to injury).Nodular hyperplasia often occurs as multiple randomly distributed masses throughout the lobes. The grossly visible nodules are spherical, well circumscribed, varying in size from 2 mm to 3 cm or more, and may bulge from the capsular surface or be entirely hidden within the parenchyma ( Fig.  2-103 ). They may be sharply distinct from the surrounding parenchyma because of color differences, either lighter than the surrounding liver because of increased lipid or glycogen content within hepatocytes comprising the nodule, or darker because the sinusoidal vessels are distended with blood. Some nodules are the same color as the surrounding tissue and can only be identified by examination of a washed or blotted slice under a strong light.The larger hyperplastic nodules grow expansively; they do not induce a fibrous capsule, but they can compress the surrounding parenchyma. The hepatocytes comprising nodular hyperplasia are often phenotypically different from those in adjacent parenchyma (Fig. 2-104 ). Old canine livers often have microscopic focal hyperplasia of similarly altered hepatocytes that can be distinguished from the surrounding parenchyma, but they evidently grow more slowly and do not compress their boundaries. These can be regarded as examples of the numerous atypical focal hyperplasias that arise as altered foci, nodules, plaques, or polyps in various tissues of old dogs. In more prominent paler nodules, hepatocytes can be enlarged and vacuolated with lipid or glycogen accumulation. Mitotic figures are uncommon. The sinusoids of the",
