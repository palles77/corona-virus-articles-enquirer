It has been documented that the temperature and its variations might have affected the SARS outbreak [7] . A study in Korea found that the risk of influenza incidence was significantly increased with low daily temperature and low/high relative humidity, a positive significant association was observed for diurnal temperature range (DTR) [8] . Moreover, temperature [9] and DTR [10] have been linked to the death from respiratory diseases. A study demonstrated that absolute humidity had significant correlations with influenza viral survival and transmission rates [11] . Couple of studies reported that the COVID-19 was related to the meteorological factors, which decreased with the temperature increasing [12, 13] , but their effects on the mortality had not been reported. Therefore, we assume that the weather conditions might also contributed to the mortality of COVID-19.",

Worse, a study with data of more than 25 years found that humidity was an important determinant of mortality and low-humidity levels may cause a large increase in mortality rates, potentially by influenza-related mechanisms [39] , similar to a study carried out in the United States [40] . Consistent to these finding, our results also indicated that the risk of dying from COVID-19 decreased only with absolute humidity increasing. Breathing dry air could cause epithelial damage and/or reduction of mucociliary clearance, and then lead to render the host more susceptible to respiratory virus infection; The formation of droplet nuclei is essential to transmission, but exhaled respiratory droplets settle very rapidly at high humidity so that it is hard to contribute to influenza virus spread [41] . Moreover, the transmission of pandemic influenza virus is the most efficient under cold, dry conditions [42] , and influenza virus survival rate increased markedly in accordance with decreasing of absolute humidity [43] , which may be similar to coronavirus. Therefore, the increase of COVID-19 mortality may also be related to the lower humidity in winter.",
