The model also includes vaccination term and general treatment function, which are the two principal control measurements to reduce the disease burden. Using the Lyapunov functions, we show that the disease-free equilibrium state is globally asymptotically stable if R 0 \u2264 1, where R 0 is the basic reproduction number. On the other hand, the disease-endemic equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable when R 0 > 1. For a specific type of treatment and incidence functions, our analysis shows the success of the vaccination strategy, as well as the treatment depends on the initial size of the susceptible population. Moreover, we discuss, numerically, the behavior of the basic reproduction number with respect to vaccination and treatment parameters.",

            "text": "Mathematical modeling has become a powerful and important tool to understand infectious disease dynamic behavior and to improve control of the disease in a population. These models are often described by many forms such as: SI, SIS, SIR, or SIRS models, where S stands for susceptible subpopulation, I is infected subpopulation, and R is recovered subpopulation. The progress of a disease in a population is dictated by the nature and the mode of transmission between infected and susceptible individuals. The mode of transmission is the method of transfer by which the infection moves or carries from one place to another to reach the new host (for example airborne, saliva, vector-borne, and bodily fluids). Hence, it is natural to adapt these models to the concerned disease by choosing the right incidence function. It is known that the function forms of the incidence rate of the infection have a crucial role in the modeling of the infection dynamics, many forms of incidence function have been considered by the researchers in mathematical epidemiology, for example, the bilinear incidence rate \u03b2SI, where \u03b2 is the transmission rate of infection, the saturated incidence rate \u03b2SI 1+\u03b1I , with \u03b1 defined as the inhibitory coefficient, and many other forms (see [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] ). To make a model more realistic, the introduction of the time delay is more interesting, and considerable attention has been paid by several authors to studying the dynamics of epidemic models with discrete or distributed time delay (see [3, 4, [8] [9] [10] [11] ). Vaccination and treatment are the two main public health control strategies that help to minimize the burden of an infectious disease spread and to delay a possible outbreak. Vaccination has the role of preventing healthy people from getting infected by a disease, while treatment cures a disease and can also be used as a prophylactic. These control strategies are usually used together to contain the disease spread (see [12] in the context of influenza). Tulu et al., in [13] , developed a mathematical model to study the effect of both vaccination and quarantine on the spread of Ebola virus, they applied the vaccination strategy to the susceptible individuals. However, in [14] , the authors studied the global dynamics of an SEIRS epidemic model with preventive vaccination applied to the newborns. Various vaccination policies were studied in different mathematical models (see [8, [15] [16] [17] [18] ). It is well known in classical epidemic models that the recovery rate due to treatment is proportional to the number of the infected individuals. However, this proportionality is not satisfied in the reality because of limited medical facilities (see [19] ). In order to include the limited capacity of medical resources, Chauhan et al., in [20] , considered the piecewise linear treatment function of the form",

Other works have investigated the effects of the treatment on an epidemic (see [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] ) and also its optimal control (see [26] ). The motivation of this work comes from [10, 11] , where the authors studied an SIR epidemic model with nonlinear incidence function, and from [19] [20] [21] , where the authors considered a special type of treatment function. The present work would be a continuation and generalization of the above cited works. It is concerned with a generalized SIR epidemic model with distributed delay, vaccination, and treatment. This model incorporates distributed delay, general incidence function, vaccination, and general function treatment. In fact, we apply the vaccination to both susceptible and newborn individuals. On the newborn individuals, we apply the mechanism of \"all-or-nothing\" vaccine. Recall that an \"all-or-nothing\" vaccine offers complete protection to a subset of the vaccinated individuals, but the remainder of them stays susceptible to catching the disease. Second, we consider a class of treatment functions satisfying suitable conditions, and it is more general than the one given by (1) or (2) . Moreover, it is necessary to point out that the delay in this model represents the incubation time taken to become infectious. This model can be applied to investigate the impact of the vaccination and the treatment in containing the spread of infections which have an incubation time to become infectious, for example, SARS-CoV(see [27, 28] ). Our purpose in this work is to investigate the impact of the combined vaccination and treatment strategies on the dynamic behavior of the considered model. We prove that the basic reproduction number R 0 depends explicitly on the vaccination parameters and the general treatment function T(I). Moreover, we discuss the global stability of the model near equilibria (the disease-free equilibrium E 0 and the disease-endemic equilibrium E * ) by means of R 0 and Lyapunov's method. Furthermore, to verify the theoretical results, numerical simulations are performed for special treatment and incidence functions. For illustration, we give some numerical results on the behavior of the basic reproduction number R 0 with respect to vaccination and treatment parameters.",

Moreover, we prove the local stability of the disease-free equilibrium and the global stability of E 0 and E * . In Sect. 4, we give some numerical examples with an incidence and treatment functions satisfying assumptions presented in the previous sections.

The delay, presented in this work, reflects the time that it takes to have an infection after the contact. The model also included the two main types of disease control measures: vaccine and treatment. The question that arises in using these two measures is how each vaccination should depend on the treatment. In fact, as the treatment is the first control measure to be taken either as a prophylactic or antiviral, the vaccination implementation should take into consideration the effect of the treatment on the disease infectiousness. Moreover, the function treatment was chosen to reflect the reality of drug stock supply during the time of the infections. Our analysis showed that when R 0 \u2264 1, the disease-free equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable, and when R 0 > 1, then there is a unique disease-endemic equilibrium, which is globally asymptotically stable. To put this result in context, we chose the treatment function T(I) = aI(t)",
