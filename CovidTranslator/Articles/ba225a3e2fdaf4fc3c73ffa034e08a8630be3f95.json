In an adaptation of John F Kennedy's aphorism, the prime minister argued that patients should ask of the NHS \"not just . . . what it can do for you but what, empowered with new advice, support and information, you can do for yourself and your family.\" More detail will be available later in the year when the much trailed NHS constitution is published, which will set out the \"NHS offer\" to the public and clarify how the government expects people to take responsibility for managing their own health.",

The benefit of washing hands between patients is clear (NNT=4), as is wearing masks (NNT=6), wearing gloves (NNT=5), and wearing gowns (NNT=5). So practices need to have a stock of gloves, simple masks (not necessarily of the advanced N95 make), and gowns. Applying all the recommendations described by various government guidelines 7 -such as isolation, segregation, transport, and identification of patients, creating emergency telephone lists of staff, and on-call cover when staff are sick-may seem daunting to a small practice or office. However, the one advantage with influenza, compared with more sporadic epidemics such as pertussis, is that the practice plan can be tried, evaluated, and modified each year.",

We do not have enough evidence to be certain about many aspects of care for patients with suspected influenza-for example, which face mask is more cost effective within different healthcare settings. Although 336 trials on influenza have been registered on the WHO international clinical trials registry, only three trials are about reducing transmission using distancing (keeping a physical distance from patients with suspected disease) or barrier methods. The reasons for this include the lack of research capacity and funding and an emphasis on drug based treatments. Governments should continue to fund research to confirm the findings of this review and to investigate other areas of uncertainty that it identifies in the management of people with suspected influenza. On Wednesday 9 January 2008, the House of Commons health select committee published the report of its second inquiry into the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE). 1 The committee's first inquiry into NICE was published six years ago, 2 just three years after the institute's launch. Much has happened since the initial inquiry. The institute is now well established and is a core policy driver within the National Health Service in England and Wales (its remit does not cover Scotland), and we know much more about how it operates. Moreover, the working environment of the institute has changed with, for instance, the publication of the Cooksey report on funding for health research in the United Kingdom, 3 the introduction of legislation making NICE technology appraisals essentially compulsory, 4 the involvement of the courts in a legal challenge to NICE, 5 and most recently the Office of Fair Trading's critical review of how brand name drugs are priced in the UK through the Pharmaceutical Price Regulation Scheme (PPRS). 6 All these and more have been embraced in this new inquiry, for which members visited equivalent bodies to NICE in Canada, France, and Scotland; took oral evidence from 31 witnesses; and received 124 written submissions. The committee's report contains 32 recommendations, many of which are far reaching and reflect the work of a particularly effective inquisitorial team.",

The study was restricted to children older than 2 months and might not apply to a large proportion of newborns and young infants who may have a different cause of pneumonia. Children with empyema or overt pneumatoceles (suggestive of possible Staphylococcus aureus infection) were excluded. Similarly, children with wheezing were not included, which potentially limits the applicability of these findings to children with secondary infections related to infection with respiratory syncytial virus or other viruses. 6 Given that most deaths from pneumonia occur early in the course of the illness, health workers using the integrated management for childhood illness guidelines need to have clear algorithms for triage, stabilisation of children, and initiation of antibiotics. The antibiotic regimens for treating non-severe, severe, and very severe pneumonia should therefore form a continuum that is easy for health systems to implement and monitor on a large scale.",

Many viral lower respiratory tract infections present with tachypnoea and chest recessions, and it may be difficult to distinguish them from bacterial infections on clinical criteria alone. 10 Although recent studies do not indicate a good correlation between radiological results and clinically defined pneumonia, 11 the use of portable pulse oximetry may help triage children for hospital admission and additional treatment, such as oxygen and injectable antibiotics. 12 This approach needs to be validated in studies of appropriate diagnostic tools, including newer molecular methods that enable viral and bacterial infections (or combinations of the two) to be identified.",
