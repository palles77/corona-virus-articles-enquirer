In Hunan Province, we estimated Rt to be above the epidemic threshold for about two weeks with a peak value of 1.58 (95%CI: 1.29-1.92) considering an average serial interval of 5.9 days (Fig. 3B) . Shandong Province showed an longer period (more than two weeks) characterized by sustained local transmission and a larger peak value of Rt: 2.17 (95%CI: 1.69-2.76) considering an average serial interval of 5.9 days (Fig. 3C ). In these three locations, Rt remained steadily below the epidemic threshold since the end of January 2020 (Fig. 3A-C) .

Since January 28, 2020, however, the proportion of confirmed cases aged <18 years is still only about 5%, although this age group represents approximately 20% of the Chinese population. From the data available here, it is not possible to distinguish whether younger individuals have a reduced risk of infection or a propensity for milder clinical outcome given infection (thus resulting in a lower risk of detection). It should also be considered that schools in China were closed for most of the epidemic due to the 2020 Chinese New Year holidays 11 . It is unclear whether nationwide school breaks could have contributed to the low proportion of confirmed COVID-19 cases among school-age individuals, and whether schools reopening will lead to a change in the transmission patterns of COVID-19.",

The World Health Organization (WHO) declared the COVID-19 outbreak as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern on January 30, 2020 4 . An early report on epidemiology of the COVID-19 outbreak included analysis of the first 425 confirmed cases detected in Wuhan by January 22, 2020 5 . Since then, the temporal epidemic curve and spatial dissemination of COVID-19 changed quickly, rapidly growing to 72,436 cases by February 17 with 17% of cases reported outside of Hubei. In these other provinces, the COVID-19 epidemic is characterized by a mix of local transmission and importation of cases from Hubei 6 . A recent report based on the 44,672 confirmed cases detected in mainland China by February 11 gave a description of the characteristics of COVID-19 cases for China overall and for Hubei Province 6 . However, until now, there has been little information to understand the epidemiological features and transmission dynamics of COVID-19 outbreak beyond Hubei.

Although strong evidence of pre-symptomatic transmission is still lacking, the possibility of transmission during the incubation phase appears to be supported by field epidemiological investigations 18-20 . The results presented thus far support a change in epidemiological characteristics of the COVID-19 outbreak as time progresses and the epidemic expands to multiple locations. Many of the key epidemiologic time-delay distributions are markedly different from those reported in studies focusing on the early transmission dynamics of COVID-19 in Wuhan 5 . This is likely the consequence of the increased awareness of the public and physicians, behavioral changes of the population with respect to respiratory disease symptoms, increased health care readiness, and elevated alert and response across mainland China.",

This suggests a beneficial effect of the currently implemented public health intervention policies, in combination with the behavior adopted by the population as a response to the epidemic spread. Nonetheless, it should be stressed that the effectiveness of containment measures only apply while those measures are in place, and a relaxation of public health interventions or a significant change in human behavior may lead to a resurgence in transmission. Moreover, it is important to stress that our findings are based on the analysis of 9 of the most affected provinces (n=10 locations) in mainland China outside Hubei. Therefore, although unlikely, it is possible that in other provinces showing only a few cases at the time of writing the epidemic is still self-sustained by local transmission events. Moreover, it is still unclear to what extent asymptomatic and presymptomatic infections contribute to the transmission of COVID-19 and the level at which they are detected.",

However, we analyzed the completeness of individual records used in this study and compared them with official line lists for three locations in mainland China. We found that our data was of similar quality as the official complete line lists. Even in the presence of the above limitations, a timely updated patient line list like ours is critical to assess the epidemiology and transmission dynamics of an emerging pathogen, inform situational awareness, and optimize the responses to the outbreak.

In conclusion, our study provides a detailed overview of the changing epidemiology and transmission dynamics of COVID-19 in mainland China outside Hubei Province. Our findings suggest a slowing down of COVID-19 outbreak in mainland China (outside Hubei Province), indicating that the initial steps taken towards interruption of COVID-19 transmission may be effective. However, the epidemic is not yet under control and a large fraction of the population is still susceptible. The trajectory of the outbreak in China and beyond will depend on the effectiveness of control policies and human behavior in the coming weeks and months.
