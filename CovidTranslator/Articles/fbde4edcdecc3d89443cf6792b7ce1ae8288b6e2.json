Histopathology and mycology identified a Conidiobolus sp., further confirmed as Conidiobolus incongruus through DNA sequencing of D1/D2 regions. This is the first report of this species causing disease in dogs and the fifth reported infection in animals.",

Conidiobolomycosis is characterized as a chronic, granulomatous fungal disease of the nasopharynx [1] . On rare occasion disease can spread to other areas of the head and neck as well as disseminate throughout the body [5] [6] [7] . Geographically the disease is distributed worldwide in tropical and subtropical climates [1] . Affected individuals are usually immunocompetent with locally extensive disease, as dissemination is rare [1] [2] [3] [4] . The majority of infections in both humans and animals are caused by Conidiobolus coronatus with only a few due to Conidiobolus lamprauges or Conidiobolus incongruus. In humans, the handful of reported C. incongruus cases has predominantly involved the lungs or mediastinum, but pericardial, periorbital, orbitofacial and orofacial involvement have also been seen [8] .",

Samples were inoculated onto Sabouraud dextrose agar (SDA, Hardy Diagnostics, Santa Monica, CA) culture plates. The plates were incubated at 37\u00b0C and 25\u00b0C. Fungal growth was detected after 24 h incubation at 37\u00b0C. Individual nascent colonies were transferred on to separate fresh SDA culture plates and incubated at 37\u00b0C for pure growth and determination of colony characteristics. By Day 2, isolated colonies showed a flat glabrous appearance typical of a Conidiobolus sp. (Fig. 2A) . The colonies initially appeared white in color which later changed to tan with age. Microscopically they were characterized by coenocytic hyaline hyphae, numerous papillate conidia (10-35 mm) and a few multireplicative conidia (Fig. 2B) . This isolate was sent to the Fungus Testing Laboratory in the Department of Pathology at the University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio (UTHSCSA DI 14-347) for species level identification by combined phenotypic characterization and DNA sequencing. The isolate that was received was non-viable. However, photomicrographs that had been taken by the requesting laboratory (OADDL) demonstrated multi-replicative conidia (Fig. 2B) . DNA sequencing on the non-viable isolate was attempted by scraping the agar surface and suspending the fungal elements in CPL-100 Buffer (VWR International INC., Radnor, PA). These were then lysed by bead beating, and DNA was isolated manually by chloroform extraction method. Extracted DNA was used for PCR amplification of ITS and D1/D2 regions as described in [9] . PCR products were then sequenced using the ITS1 and ITS4 primers as well as NL1 and NL4 primers at the UTHSCSA Molecular Diagnostics Laboratory [10] . Sequences were assembled and analyzed using DNASTAR software (DNASTAR, Inc., Madison, WI) and queried in GenBank using the BLASTn algorithm at the NCBI site (www. ncbi.nlm.nih.gov), and were also compared to those available in the CBS-KNAW Fungal Biodiversity Centre database (www.cbs. knaw.nl). Sequencing of the ITS region was unsuccessful. However, the D1/D2 sequence showed 98.9% identity to C. incongruus NRRL 28636 (GenBank Accession no. AF113457.1; base pair match 617/ 624). Based on the presence of the multi-replicative conidia, which have been described as a discriminating characteristic between C. incongruus and C. lamprauges [11] , and the D1/D2 sequence analysis, the species of this isolate was determined to be C. incongruus. The D1/D2 sequence has been deposited in GenBank under Accession no. KP777609.",

There have been previous reports of Conidiobolus spp. in dogs, but the particular species was not identified [12, 15] . Several other cases and outbreaks of conidiobolomycosis have been reported in animals and are summarized in Tables 1-3. Primary pulmonary infection is a rare presentation regardless of species [12] . While nasopharyngeal disease is typical, infection of the deeper airways is uncommon. Tracheal involvement has been reported in one dog and one horse, neither of whom had pulmonary or nasopharyngeal disease [12] . This case is also one of only two reported canine cases of fungal pneumonia secondary to conidiobolomycosis [12] . The previous case reported by Hawkins, et. al . also occurred in a dog and the isolate was identified as a Conidiobolus sp. Due to its morphology C. coronatus was ruled out, but further identification was not possible [12] . The dog was successfully treated with itraconazole; however disseminated disease was not present. In our case the lungs were the initial site of infection with dissemination to the skin of the face, trachea as well as both small and large intestines.",

Moreover, tracheal biopsy tissue displayed marked epithelial atypia, and a neoplastic process was still under consideration, which contributed to the grave prognosis. With the benefit of comprehensive necropsy and histology of many organs, including the tracheal site of interest, the epithelial atypia was determined to be consistent with reactive tissue within a severely inflamed focus. Nevertheless, specific antifungal therapies could not be tested in this unique case, and it is unknown how the dog would have responded to that therapy.",
