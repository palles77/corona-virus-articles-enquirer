To enhance the predictive accuracy of tourism demand forecasting, a decomposition-ensemble approach is developed based on the complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise, data characteristic analysis, and the Elman's neural network model. Using Hong Kong tourism demand as an empirical case, this study firstly investigates how data characteristic analysis is used in a decomposition-ensemble approach. The empirical results show that the proposed model outperforms other models in both point and interval forecasts for different prediction horizons, indicating the effectiveness of the proposed approach for forecasting tourism demand, especially for time series with complexity.",

The benefits of tourism are many; they include catering, accommodation, transportation, entertainment, and retailing. Hence, a need exists for substantial investments in infrastructure and promotional activities for tourism (Peng, Song, & Crouch, 2014; Witt & Witt, 1995) . Clearly, accurate tourism demand forecasting is a prerequisite for decision-making relating to investments and planning (Chatziantoniou, Degiannakis, Eeckels, & Filis, 2016; Dharmaratne, 1995) . Making accurate predictions is particularly critical, given the perishable nature of tourism products. For example, unoccupied hotel rooms and airline seats cannot be stored. With accurate predictions of future tourist arrival numbers, the government could formulate a more appropriate development strategy and provide better service to tourists. Simultaneously, accurate forecasts could help the private sector develop more suitable marketing strategies, thus generating greater revenue. Therefore, developing effective models for forecasting tourism demand is a critical issue in the tourism industry (Shahrabi, Hadavandi, & Asadi, 2013) .",

For example, the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic in 2003, and the financial crisis of 2008, both caused structural breaks in the time series of tourist arrivals in many destinations (Cr\u00f3 & Martins, 2017; Narayan, 2005) .

            "text": "For a time series with complexity, the \"divide and conquer\" principle is an effective means to enhance tourism predictive accuracy (Chen, Lai, & Yeh, 2012) . Within this principle, decomposition-ensemble approaches are developed, in order to simplify the difficulty of a forecasting task by dividing it into a number of relatively easier subtasks. Then, the prediction results of the decomposed subtasks are combined into an ensemble forecast (Yu, Wang, & Tang, 2015) . In short, the principle consists of three steps: (1) data decomposition, (2) individual prediction, and (3) ensemble prediction. As a method of the \"divide and conquer\" principle, the empirical mode decomposition (EMD) method has outstanding advantages in processing various non-stationary and complex time series. Moreover, it can help to analyze the impacts of irregular events on the decomposed time series with different time scales and frequencies, and explain the generation of time series data (Zhang, Yu, Wang, & Lai, 2009 ). However, EMD also has the problem of mode mixing. Consequently, the ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) (Wu & Huang, 2009) and the complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise (CEEMDAN) (Torres, Colominas, Schlotthauer, & Flandrin, 2011) methods are developed. With CEEMDAN, the rate of reconstruction errors is almost zero, and the cost of calculation is also greatly reduced (Colominas, Schlotthauer, & Torres, 2014) . Therefore, the CEEMDAN method may be an effective means with which to deal with the complex time series of tourist arrivals.",

Then, each component is predicted by an Elman's neural network, according to data characteristics of mutability and seasonality. Finally, the individual forecasts of the reconstructed components are aggregated into point forecasts of tourism demand, and interval forecasts are generated, with point forecasts as the means.

To predict tourist arrivals in Turkey, Aslanargun, Mammadov, Yazici, and Yolacan (2007) investigated various combinations of ARIMA, linear ANN, multilayer perceptron, and radial basis function network models. Also, Andrawis, Atiya, and Elshishiny (2011) proposed a combination method based on long-term and short-term forecasts for forecasting tourism demand. In addition, Shahrabi et al. (2013) presented a hybrid model, namely the modular genetic-fuzzy forecasting system, to forecast tourism demand. This model uses three main steps: (1) data preprocessing, (2) extracting a fuzzy rule-based system for each cluster, and (3) prediction. Wu and Cao (2016) proposed a novel model by hybridizing a support vector regression model with a fruit fly optimization algorithm and a seasonal index adjustment. To comprehensively evaluate the forecasting performance of this hybrid model, both onestep-ahead and multi-step-ahead predictions were conducted.",

Combining the advantages of the STS model and the time-varying parameter regression approach, Song, Li, Witt, and Athanasopoulos (2011) developed a new model, which introduces a time-varying parameter estimation of the explanatory variable coefficients into a causal STS model. This new model is employed for modeling and predicting quarterly tourist arrivals at Hong Kong. Data are acquired from four main sources: mainland China, Korea, the UK, and the USA. The results indicate that the proposed approach could achieve higher forecasting accuracy than seven alternative models. To forecast monthly tourist arrivals in Turkey from different countries, Ak\u0131n (2015) proposed a method based on STS models, which are linear Gaussian state-space models based on a decomposition of the time series into a number of components.

As a consequence, the interval provides more useful information for tourism practitioners and policymakers to formulate relevant strategies and policies (Wu, Song, & Shen, 2017) .

The ARIMA model can achieve higher predictive accuracy in the USA and UK time series than in other sources. The reason for this finding may be that the time series of these two sources are more stable and less complex than those of other sources.

Accordingly, this study proposes a new methodology, which is the first to investigate how to enhance both point and interval forecasting performance by combining the CEEMDAN method and data characteristic analysis. (2) New techniques are introduced to decompose sample data and capture the data characteristics of tourism demand. Compared with the original EMD method, the CEEMDAN method reduces the occurrence of mode mixing. As multiple scales may exist in the time series of some decomposed components, this study uses multiscale permutation entropy, rather than the traditional single-scale permutation entropy, as a new efficient technique of component reconstruction. It also investigates the mutability and seasonality of reconstructed components, and analyzes the impacts of irregular events on tourism demand. Thus, it is possible to develop more effective forecasting models, using dummy variables, to predict reconstructed components.",

Second, the aim of this study is to validate the effectiveness of the proposed decomposition-ensemble approach, where the ENN is chosen for the prediction of each reconstructed component and exhibits high predictive accuracy. There are various other recurrent neural networks, such as LSTM, which are often found to perform well in time series forecasting. New models can be further developed based on decomposition methods, data characteristic analysis and LSTM. Finally, only MPE is used for complexity tests of component reconstruction. Other component reconstruction methods, including fine-to-coarse techniques, K-means clustering and phase space reconstruction methods, are worthy of investigation in the future.",

New hybrid models are developed to compare with the benchmark models. The results show that the CEEMDAN method is an effective data decomposition technique, and DCA is helpful for tourism demand forecasting. Our investigation has found that multiple time scales may exist in the time series of decomposed components. Hence, multiple scale permutation entropy (MPE) can be morecompetent than single-scale permutation entropy for measuring the complexity of components with multiple time scales. Moreover, there may be mutability and cyclicity (seasonality) for the reconstructed components. Therefore, dummy variables can be used to capture these data characteristics, in order to achieve higher predictive accuracy. 2. How does the paper offer a social science perspective/approach? Tourism demand forecasting is important to tourism management. With accurate predictions of future tourist volumes, the government could formulate a more appropriate development strategy and provide better service to tourists. Simultaneously, accurate forecasts could help the private sector develop more suitable marketing strategies, thus generating greater revenue. However, developing effective models for forecasting tourism demand is still a challenge. Our approach actually improves the existing EMD-based models within the \"divide and conquer\" framework. Due to the complexity of time series of tourist arrivals, a decomposition-ensemble approach is developed for forecasting tourism demand. Four main steps are involved: (1) Sample data of tourist arrivals are decomposed into several components by using the CEEMDAN technique.",
