Imatinib is the first-line treatment of CML; however, many patients are resistant to this drug. In this study, we aimed to compare the differences in expression patterns and functions of time-series genes in imatinib-resistant CML cells under different drug treatments. GSE24946 was downloaded from the GEO database, which included 17 samples of K562-r cells with (n=12) or without drug administration (n=5). Three drug treatment groups were considered for this study: arsenic trioxide (ATO), AMN107, and ATO+AMN107. Each group had one sample at each time point (3, 12, 24, and 48 h). Time-series genes with a ratio of standard deviation/average (coefficient of variation) >0.15 were screened, and their expression patterns were revealed based on Short Time-series Expression Miner (STEM). Then, the functional enrichment analysis of time-series genes in each group was performed using DAVID, and the genes enriched in the top ten functional categories were extracted to detect their expression patterns. Different time-series genes were identified in the three groups, and most of them were enriched in the ribosome and oxidative phosphorylation pathways. Time-series genes in the three treatment groups had different expression patterns and functions. Time-series genes in the ATO group (e.g. CCNA2 and DAB2) were significantly associated with cell adhesion, those in the AMN107 group were related to cellular carbohydrate metabolic process, while those in the ATO+AMN107 group (e.g. AP2M1) were significantly related to cell proliferation and antigen processing. In imatinib-resistant CML cells, ATO could influence genes related to cell adhesion, AMN107 might affect genes involved in cellular carbohydrate metabolism, and the combination therapy might regulate genes involved in cell proliferation.",

            "text": "The different expression patterns for time-series genes between the ATO (or AMN107) group and ATO+AMN107 group could be explained by the different gene functions. Cell to cell adhesion signaling is im-plicated in CML, and several genes, such as CTNNA1 and ACTA1, in this pathway are upregulated in CML hematopoietic stem cells [18] . CyclinA2 (CCNA2) is a cell cycle-related gene that mainly functions in the G 1 /S and G 2 /M phases [19] . In CML, the expression of CCNA2 protein is downregulated by imatinib administration alone or in combination with arsenic sulfide [20] . The cell cycle-related genes also have function during cell adhesion. For instance, the cell cycle-related genes such as COL6A1 and API3 are reported to promote cell adhesion [21] . However, cell adhesion can activate cell cycle progression [22] . Cell cycle and cell adhesion are regulated by the same enzyme 2-O-sulfotransferase [23] . These observations collectively suggest the close relationship of the two cellular activities. Notably, ATO compels the CML-initiating cells (LICs) to enter the cell cycle by downregulating PML expression. This process enhances the drug sensitivity of CML cells [24] . These findings reveal that ATO administration might eradicate the TKI resistance of CML cells through regulation of cell cycle-related genes.",

Likewise, their functions might be weakened over time. Cellular carbohydrate metabolic process is essential in tumor cells owing to vigorous proliferation [28] . AMN107 is a novel aminopyrimidine inhibitor of BCR-ABL in both imatinib-sensitive and imatinib-resistant CML. In particular, AMN107 shows potent activity against imatinib-resistant CML owing to quantitative alterations to the BCR-ABL protein in the activation site [29] . During this process, extensive cellular carbohydrate metabolisms might be involved, and it is understandable that following AMN107 treatment, the altered genes were significantly enriched in this metabolic process. Based on previous findings and the results of enrichment analysis, it can be inferred that AMN107 might influence energy metabolism, and the genes involved in this process might be used as targets for imatinib-resistant CML therapy.",

In addition, based on our present enrichment analysis, we observed that the time-series genes in the ATO+AMN107 group were markedly different from those in ATO or AMN107 group, suggesting that ATO+AMN107 therapy might have different effects on gene expression and their functions. Compared to the AMN107 group, time-series genes in the ATO+AMN107 group, which had expression pattern similar to profile 29 (stable-increasing-stable), were highly correlated with the regulation of cell proliferation. The expression trend suggests that following ATO+AMN107 treatment, the time-series genes might need a short time before their response to these drugs. Notably, after response to the drugs, they might function throughout the remaining time duration. Aberration of several genes is reported to impact cell proliferation. In K562 CML cell lines, overexpressed CCN3 decreases proliferation and enhances sensitivity to imatinib [30] . Moreover, increased IFN\u03b1 expression could directly inhibit cell proliferation in CML cells [31] . Additionally, compared to the ATO group, time-series genes that had expression pattern in profile 40 (increasing-stable-increasing) were significantly related to serine family amino acid metabolic process. The expression pattern indicated that time-series genes having this trend might have an immediate response to the combination treatment, and then might be inactive. Function of these genes might be recovered after a while. Adaptor related protein complex 2 Mu 1 subunit (AP2M1) belongs to the family of adaptor complexes medium subunits. Reportedly, it is involved in antigen processing in the MHC class \u2161 and \u2160 pathways in human monocytes [32] . Monocytes could derive dendritic cells (DCs) from the blood of CML patients [33] . Notably, imatinib could impair the generation of matured DCs from normal monocytes [34] . This provides a hint that the combination therapy of ATO+AMN107 might also block DC formation similar to imatinib. All these suggested genes related to antigen processing might also be altered after ATO+AMN107 treatment. Collectively, ATO+AMN107 therapy might cause alterations in genes involved in the cell proliferation process, serine family amino acid metabolism, and antigen processing in the MHC class \u2161 and \u2160 pathways in imatinib-resistant CML cells.",
