Nosocomial infection rates range from 1% in Northern Europe, especially The Netherlands, which introduced extremely aggressive infection control measures, to \u03fe 40% in some parts of Asia, South America, and sub-Saharan Africa. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [46] [47] [48] Sanitation is clearly a major factor for such high rates of HAI in developing nations. Lack of resources is another. Studies suggest more than 50% of injections administered at HCF in developing countries are unsafe. Often the needles and/or syringes are reused, including between patients. Some of those injections are also unnecessary such as routine injections of vitamin B-12 or antibiotics. However, when a hammer is all you have, everything looks like a nail; HCF use what they have, albeit sometimes in a well-meaning but ill-conceived attempt to heal. A major consequence of this is that an estimated 80,000-160,000 new human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infections occur annually in sub-Saharan Africa, and even more cases of hepatitis B virus and hepatitis C virus occur worldwide each year because of unsafe injections.",

We should consider this a cautionary time. \"Victory\" is better exchanged for the term \"stalemate\" with infections-possible only as long as we practice the sound infection control practices that lead to the changes in mortality from 1900 to 2000. 51 The increased inattention to these infection control practices being reported may account for the death rate from infectious diseases rising 58% between 1980 and 1992 (making them in the aggregate the third leading cause of death in the USA). Influenza and pneumonia remain responsible for 5.5% of the deaths of people 65 and older (95,640) in 1997, with an increase in infection-related deaths among older persons from 1980 to 1992. 51 Also, the combined death rate from influenza and pneumonia for all age-race-sex groups has increased. 51 With almost 2 million patients acquiring nosocomial infections each year in United States hospitals, the war against infectious diseases is clearly not over.

C diff, antibiotic-associated diarrhea, or medication-host--dependent infections such as C diff infection are a growing and significant health hazard for patients. Although it will be discussed in more depth later in this monograph, C diff is increasingly the result of common medical practices that include routine alteration of patient pH (widespread use among the elderly of proton pump inhibitors and gastric acid suppressant therapy, [61] [62] [63] inattention to the benefit of probiotic adjunct therapy when prescribing antibiotics; albeit that remains somewhat controversial, it is a low-risk possible benefit, judicious use of antimicrobial medications, and attention to infection control-especially hand washing, 64, 65 cohorting infectious patients, and other methods.

HAI of avian flu were demonstrated in a retrospective study. Health care workers exposed to patients with H5N1 infection were more likely to be seropositive and this was not attributable to animal exposure. 54, 55, [67] [68] [69] [70] It is reasonable to assume that the route of infection for avian influenza patients, like most influenza patients, can be from inhalation of infective respiratory secretions and/or contact with virusladen secretions and subsequent transference contact with mucous membranes. Studies suggest that the airborne transmission of influenza explains the sometimes numerically explosive nature of flu epidemics. 54, 55, [67] [68] [69] [70] It is important to recognize that seasonal influenza can be transmitted within health care and long-term facilities. The basic reproductive number for influenza (the number of secondary cases produced by 1 primary case) varies from 1.68 to 20.",

Surgical site infections accounted for over 240,000 HAI in the NNIS report. [1] [2] [3] There are also seasonal variations associated with certain pathogens. The return of severely wounded troops from the Persian Gulf is becoming a risk factor for HAI-especially related to the bacteria Acinetobacter, most notably Acinetobacter baumannii at health care facilities. 58, 59, 71, 72 Multidrug-resistant A baumannii is considered near epidemic among the wounded in Iraq compared to Afghanistan. A recent outbreak of A baumannii at Walter Reed Army Medical Center resulted in 53 HAI and 4 deaths. 58, 59 Because of this, returning wounded troops are often isolated until they are cleared of this pathogen. Although typically occurring in ICU settings in US hospitals, the risk of A baumannii as an HAI is increasing. 72 Although organisms causing many nosocomial infections often come from the patient's own body flora, contact in a hospital environment where pathogens often can survive on surfaces or instruments remains a significant risk. Patients also interact with staff and contaminated instruments. Because patients are highly mobile and hospital stays are becoming shorter, patients often are discharged while asymptomatic, before the infection becomes apparent. An infection control challenge resides in the fact that many nosocomial infections in hospitalized patients especially originating from ambulatory care facilities become apparent only after the patients are discharged.",

According to the NNIS there were 33,269 HAI among newborns in high-risk nurseries, of which gram-positive organisms including MRSA, Escherichia coli, a gram-negative organism, and Candida albicans fungal infections were the most common.

Staph, Group B Streptococcus, E coli, Klebsiella, Serratia, and Candida have been implicated as significant causes. MRSA, recognized in the 1970s, continues to be a major pathogen in adult, pediatric, and neonatal HAI, and Candida is a significant cause of mortality among neonates in the ICU. Although beyond the scope of this article, some studies support the newer strategy of using prophylactic fluconazole in high-risk neonates in the ICU such as those \u03fd 750 g to reduce the risk of fungal infections. 12, [73] [74] [75] Not unlike other patients, newborns, even those not requiring NICU care, are susceptible to HAI.

Consistent training, greater emphasis on sanitation, investment in single-use equipment when necessary, greater communication, and coordination of care across disciplines, including directed guidance by infection control professionals, are needed. Amazingly, blood pressure cuffs and other equipment continue to be shared between patients with C diff or other HAI and those uninfected! Solutions include single-use sphygmomanometers that can then be billed to the patient (they are low cost as anyone who has purchased one at a chain pharmacy can attest, especially in the grand scheme of hospital expenses), cuff barriers, which are increasingly available and low cost, or disposable cuffs-all significantly less expensive than a hospital-wide outbreak. Outcome measures need to be \"owned\" by every member of the facility team. Updating the staff where positive-and negative-infection control outcomes are occurring in a \"no blame\" environment can promote greater awareness, problem-solving, and effort. A recent unpublished survey of health care professionals revealed most were not aware C diff was a leading HAI or was readily transmitted by shared stethoscopes or blood pressure cuffs. Some thought it was an ICU problem. In 2008, C diff and HAI should be top concerns at HCF. Too many patients and no support staff are not viable excuses in the short term to not wash hands or attend to infection-control measures. However, they are viable problems that must be addressed for the long term. Local HCF trends in infectioncontrol successes and failures need to be shared across departments and not just the purview of the medicine or infection-control departments. Departmental compartmentalization or annual in-service updates are inadequate to address the daily threat of HAI.",
