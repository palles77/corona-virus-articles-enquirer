The aim of this study was to identify the preventive advice and interventions received by Australian pilgrims before Hajj, and the barriers to and facilitators of their use during Hajj. Methods: Two cross-sectional surveys of Australians pilgrims aged !18 years were undertaken, one before and one after the Hajj 2014. Results: Of 356 pilgrims who completed the survey (response rate 94%), 80% had the influenza vaccine, 30% the pneumococcal vaccine, and 30% the pertussis vaccine. Concern about contracting disease at Hajj was the most cited reason for vaccination (73.4%), and not being aware of vaccine availability was the main reason for non-receipt (56%). Those who obtained pre-travel advice were twice as likely to be vaccinated as those who did not seek advice. Of 150 pilgrims surveyed upon return, 94% reported practicing hand hygiene during Hajj, citing ease of use (67%) and belief in its effectiveness (62.4%) as the main reasons for compliance; university education was a significant predictor of hand hygiene adherence. Fifty-three percent used facemasks, with breathing discomfort (76%) and a feeling of suffocation (40%) being the main obstacles to compliance. Conclusion: This study indicates that there are significant opportunities to improve awareness among Australian Hajj pilgrims about the importance of using preventive health measures.",

Intense congestion, shared accommodation, air pollution, and compromised hygiene all contribute to the transmission of infections at Hajj, most notably acute respiratory infections (ARIs). 1, 2 Hajj presents a public health challenge for Saudi Arabia, as the authorities need to cater for an increasing number of pilgrims and respond to emerging infections such as the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). 3, 4 It is also challenging for the countries sending pilgrims, since these pilgrims can import epidemic diseases to their home countries upon return. In an effort to reduce the risk of infectious diseases at Hajj, an array of preventive measures have been recommended by the Saudi Arabian Ministry of Health (MoH), which include vaccination and hygiene measures (Table 1) . 5 However, studies have demonstrated that vaccine uptake and compliance with hygiene and protective measures are highly variable among pilgrims, 6, 7 and the reasons behind this variability remain unclear.",

To address these questions, two cross-sectional surveys were conducted among Australian pilgrims, one before and one after the Hajj 2014, to identify what preventive advice and interventions pilgrims received before travel, and what factors influenced their compliance with these measures while they were there.",

This study found that 14 and France where the vaccination rate for 2014 was zero due to vaccine non-availability, 15 and compares well with the overall vaccination rates among international pilgrims over recent decades, which range between 0.7% and 100%. 6, 16 Influenza vaccine aside, the uptake of other recommended vaccines was low. For instance, the uptake of pneumococcal vaccine was only 30%. Previous Australian and international surveys have reported coverage rates ranging from 2.5% to 36%. 6, 17 This is concerning because pneumonia is the leading cause of hospital admission and an important cause of mortality at Hajj. [18] [19] [20] Furthermore, surveys have shown that many pilgrims were not aware that pneumonia is transmissible 21 and preventable by vaccination. 22 There is currently no formal guidance from the Saudi MoH on the use of pneumococcal vaccine for Hajj pilgrims, which may partly explain this apparent lack of awareness (Table 1) . 23 The uptake of pertussis vaccine was 30%, compared with 10.6% among French Hajj pilgrims in 2005. 24 Additionally, the coverage for hepatitis A and B vaccines were each 17%, which is higher than the 11.5% uptake for hepatitis A reported among French pilgrims in 2005, 24 and the 6% each for hepatitis A and B among Saudi pilgrims in 2010. 25 While a large proportion of Hajj pilgrims are from countries with intermediate to high hepatitis B virus (HBV) prevalence, the risk of contracting HBV at Hajj is not well studied. 26, 27 It is known that a significant proportion of pilgrims engage in high-risk behaviours; for example it was found that about 43% of male pilgrims shaved their heads with reused razors, 28 or had their heads shaved by non-professional (unlicensed) barbers. 25 Other studies have also reported high-risk behaviours that increase the risk of hepatitis A, including buying and eating food from street vendors. 29 Despite this, hepatitis A and B vaccines are not listed in the Saudi MoH recommendations for Hajj pilgrims (Table 1) . 23 In this study, polio vaccine uptake was 8%, which is low compared with the uptake among French pilgrims in 2006 (15%), 30 and the uptake among pilgrims from other non-endemic countries in 2013 (43%). 31 Typhoid vaccine coverage was 13% in this study, which compares well with the uptake rate of 9% among international pilgrims in 2002. 32 The present study appears to report MMR (measles, mumps, and rubella) vaccine uptake (10%) for the first time.",

These results are consistent with the findings of Memish et al., who reported a lack of knowledge to be a significant factor for poor uptake of the seasonal influenza vaccine among pilgrims. 33 Conversely, previous Australian studies have reported reliance on natural immunity as the main reason for not being vaccinated against influenza in 2011, while low risk perception of contracting influenza was the main reason in 2012. 13 A unique finding of this study is that pilgrims who received pretravel advice from GPs and Hajj tour group leaders were twice as likely to be vaccinated as those who did not receive such advice. Barasheed et al. found that receiving advice from Hajj group leaders was the main motivator for the uptake of influenza vaccine among Australian Hajj pilgrims in 2012. 13 This survey also revealed that older pilgrims (aged >40 years) were more likely to take up the recommended vaccines. Similarly, Gautret et al. demonstrated that influenza vaccine coverage increased with age in French pilgrims. 24 This could be due to the fact that older people are more aware of their health, or it could be due to an increasing number of pre-existing illnesses as people age. Another study among French pilgrims found that 'at risk' pilgrims were significantly more likely to be advised to receive pneumococcal vaccine than those who were not 'at risk'. 22 This may explain why vaccine uptake has been found to increase with age in some studies. 24, 34 Although respiratory infections are the most common diseases during Hajj, 1 the participants in this study were more concerned about food-borne illness than ARIs. Limited knowledge and perception of diseases among pilgrims has been found in other studies; an Australian study found that 42% of pilgrims in 2014 were not aware that pneumonia can be transmissible. 21 Similarly, French pilgrims in 2014 did not perceive pneumonia as a severe condition, and were not aware of the existence of a vaccine against it. 22 No association was found between the disease risk perception for influenza, pneumonia, and hepatitis B and the uptake of the respective vaccines. This contradicts other data, which demonstrated that an increased risk perception of pandemic influenza A (H1N1) was significantly associated with influenza vaccine uptake among US pilgrims in 2009. 35 Almost all of the participants in the present study used some kind of hand hygiene; this was higher compared with French pilgrims in 2013 (50%). 36 More than half of the pilgrims used facemasks in this study, similar to French pilgrims in 2013. 36 Nevertheless, previous studies have reported that only half of the participants were aware of the availability of non-pharmaceutical preventive measures against respiratory infections. 9, 33 Belief that hand hygiene is easy to use and effective in preventing infections were the main reasons for uptake among the present sample. Conversely, facemasks were less accepted. Among non-users, discomfort and difficulty in breathing were barriers to their use. Those who used facemasks believed that they were effective in preventing infectious diseases. Similar quantitative findings have been reported among members of the general Singaporean community, 37 but not previously among Hajj pilgrims. Another important factor identified as a driver for the use of facemasks was protection from air pollution. A recent study found that the air pollution level in Makkah during the Hajj consistently exceeds internationally acceptable standards, 38 and therefore this perception is probably justified and could inform health promotion policy.",

These results support the findings of a recent Australian study, which also demonstrated a high level of confidence in advice from non-health professional sources such as family, friends, and travel agents. 8 The present study identified that being aged between 34 and 49 years was the only factor significantly associated with seeking pre-travel health advice. Therefore, enhancing awareness among other groups of Hajj pilgrims, especially elderly adults and those with pre-existing illnesses, about the importance of seeking professional pre-travel advice could be an important strategy to improve the uptake of preventive measures. Moreover, providing GPs with culturally appropriate health information on Hajj and the preventive measures recommended by the Saudi MoH could also facilitate uptake. 42 This study has some limitations. Two different groups were surveyed and the groups showed significant differences in demographic characteristics, particularly in sex, education level, and country of birth. Also, the sample size of the post-Hajj group was smaller than intended. These could limit the generalizability of the findings of one group to the other. These limitations are being addressed by a second, larger cohort study among Australian pilgrims during Hajj 2015, and a qualitative study among GPs and tour group leaders is underway. Despite these limitations this study has uniquely identified the barriers to and facilitators of the uptake of preventive measures among Australian Hajj pilgrims, providing important preliminary data upon which to build.",
