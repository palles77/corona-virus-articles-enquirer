Through a crosssectional community-based nasal self-swabbing study we sought to determine carriage epidemiology for respiratory pathogens amongst bacteria (Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenza, Moraxella catarrhalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Neisseria meningitidis) and viruses (RSV, Influenza viruses A and B, Rhinovirus/Enterovirus, Coronavirus, Parainfluenza viruses 1-3 and Adenovirus (ADV)).",

The spatial structure of microbial respiratory communities was less nested (more disordered) in the young (0-4 years) and those with recent RTI. Species frequency distributions were flatter than random expectation in young individuals (X 2 = 20.42, p = 0.002), indicating spatial clumping of species consistent with facilitative relationships amongst them. Deviations from a neutral model of ecological niches were observed for samples collected in the summer and from older individuals (those aged 5-17, 18-64 and \u2265 65 years) but not in samples collected from winter, younger individuals (those aged 0-4 years), individuals with recent RTI and individuals without recent RTI, demonstrating the importance of both neutral and niche processes in respiratory community assembly. The application of epidemiological methods and ecological theory to sets of respiratory tract samples has yielded novel insights into the factors that drive microbial community composition, such as seasonality and age, as well as species patterns and interactions within the nose.",

Such interactions will be driven by species presence and diversity of the resident communities of the respiratory tract. Here diversity in species richness and abundance is thought to offer protection from invading pathogens and overgrowth of a single species (5, 6) . It is likely that the dynamics of community structure may impact on infection risk. Species diversity can be measured in the presence of different species within the respiratory tract (inter-species diversity) or the presence of different bacterial strains and types of a single species (intraspecies). The former can be assessed using conventional culture methods or molecular techniques such as real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and 16S rRNA gene sequencing (7, 8) . Intra-species analysis gives insight into the distribution of different types of a species that may display differential capacity for disease. It requires techniques such as serotyping and multi-locus sequence typing (MLST) (9) (10) (11) (12) , or expansions of the MLST methodology such as whole-genome MLST (wgMLST) (13) and ribosomal MLST (rMLST) (14) .",

A strongly nested system has a highly predictable sequence of species incidence amongst samples, while a weakly nested system has a more random turnover of species incidence. A nestedness tool, PlotTemp.R, was used within the R graphical user interface (CRAN, version 3.0.1) to determine spatial ordering amongst nose-swab samples analysed with real-time PCR. Real-time PCR datasets were converted to incidence matrices of the presence/absence of each species in each sample. The plot_temp script shuffles each matrix to rank its rows of samples by their richness (most species rich at top) and its columns of species by their incidence (most frequently present to left). Within the final shuffled matrix, presences are represented by red squares and absences by white squares. Their locations in the matrix are compared to a line of perfect fill that would encompass all presences if they were perfectly packed towards the top-left of the matrix. This line then reveals the locations of 'surprise' presences lying to its right and 'surprise' absences lying to its left. The degree of disorder in the matrix is reported as a matrix 'temperature', ranging from 0-100\u00b0, calculated as a function of the sum across all surprises of squared deviations from the line of perfect fill. Low temperatures reveal strong nesting, characteristic of highly ordered systems, and high temperatures reveal weak nesting, characteristic of disordered systems.

Furthermore, the swab samples used were not optimised for the detection of viral species. The questionnaire used for the study was designed for simplicity and ease of completion. This meant that information was not collected on a number of important factors, including smoking status, siblings, and attendance at nursery or day-care facilities. Samples assessed by real-time PCR were limited by the number of species that were targeted as well as the non-random nature of their selection. The ecological models ignore acquired or specific host immunity, which can influence the ecology of the respiratory tract (53) . The combined analysis of bacterial and viral species, and the combined analysis of all RTI, may also be simplistic.

Statistical Analysis Binary logistic regression (SPSS, version 20) determined the effect of patient characteristics and demographic factors on carriage of the target bacterial species. Univariate linear regression was used to pre-select variables for inclusion in the final model (at Type-I threshold \u03b1 = 0.10). Multivariable binomial logistic regression was then performed using these pre-selected variables, followed by backward elimination of those not meeting a Type-I threshold \u03b1 = 0.05 within the final model. Crude and adjusted odds ratios (OR), 95% confidence intervals and p-values were recorded. Final model fit was assessed using Nagelkerke pseudo-R 2 values and Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis for calculation of the area under the curve (AUC). High pseudo-R 2 values and an AUC significantly different from 0.5 indicate a model that predicts carriage better than chance variation.",

For the commercial kits, a 1 in 10 dilution of the reverse transcriptase (RT) was made up in UHQ water. For each sample, 0.15\u00b5l of diluted RT was added to 15\u00b5l pre-amplification mix. 15\u00b5l of the amplification mix was then aliquoted into the reaction tube along with 10\u00b5l of extracted RNA.

PCR serotyping was used to determine serotypes of S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae identified within summer samples only. In silico serotyping was used to determine serotypes of S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae identified within summer and winter samples. Methicillin resistance typing was done on S. aureus isolates identified within both summer and winter samples to determine the prevalence of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA). For serotyping and whole genome sequencing, genomic DNA was extracted from bacterial colonies using the QIAamp DNA Mini Kit Blood (Qiagen, Germany) according to the manufacturer's protocol. For real-time PCR, nucleic acid extraction (DNA and RNA) from STGG samples was undertaken using the QIAxtractor automated nucleic acid purification instrument and QIAamp Viral RNA Mini kits (Qiagen, Germany) according to the manufacturer's vaccum protocol. PCR Serotyping S. pneumoniae isolates were serotyped using the Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) protocol (9). This involved eight separate PCR reaction pools covering 40 of the most common pneumococcal serotypes (Supplementary Table 1). Each PCR was undertaken in a 12.5\u00b5l volume containing 0.5\u00b5l 50mM MgCl 2 , 6.25\u00b5l 2x Red PCR, 0.0125\u00b5l 100mM cpsA (capsular polysaccharide biosynthesis gene for identification of S. pneumoniae) forward and reverse primers, 100mM serotype forward and reverse primers (volumes in Supplementary Table 1), Ultra-High Quality (UHQ) water and 1\u00b5l extracted DNA (or control). Thermal cycling was performed under the following conditions: 94\u00b0C for 4 minutes followed by 30 cycles of 94\u00b0C for 45 seconds, 54\u00b0C for 45 seconds and 72\u00b0C for 2 minutes 30 seconds. Serotyping of H. influenzae was undertaken using previously published methods (23, 24). Speciation PCR was undertaken for detection of the ompP2 gene. Each PCR was undertaken in a 12.5\u00b5l volume containing 0.625\u00b5l 10mM forward and reverse primers, 6.25\u00b5l 2x Red PCR Mix, 4\u00b5l UHQ water and 1\u00b5l extracted DNA (or control).

Serotyping PCR was undertaken for detection of serotype a-f genes. Each PCR was undertaken in a 12.5\u00b5l volume containing 0.625\u00b5l 10mM forward and reverse primers for each serotype, 6.25\u00b5l 2x Red PCR Mix, 4\u00b5l UHQ water and 1\u00b5l extracted DNA (or control). Thermal cycling was performed under the following conditions: 95\u00b0C for 2 minutes then 25 cycles of 94\u00b0C for 1 minute, 52\u00b0C for 1 minute and 72\u00b0C for 1 minute and then a final step of 72\u00b0C for 8 minutes. All PCR products were visualised using a 2% highresolution agarose gel. Sequencing libraries were prepared using Nextera XT (Illumina, USA). Whole genome sequencing was performed using the Illumina MiSeq paired-end chemistry (2x150bp or 2x250bp). Adapter sequences and low quality regions were removed using Trimmomatic (Usadel Lab, 0.32), quality control of reads was performed using FastQC (Babraham Bioinformatics, version 0.11.2) and then assembled de novo using Velvet (Victorian AssemblyImprovement (Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, version 1.140300). In silico PCR analysis was then undertaken using iPCRess (European Bioinformatics Institute, Exonerate package, version 1.2.0).
