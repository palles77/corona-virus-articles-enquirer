            "text": "Peripheral T cell lymphopenia (lyp) in the BioBreeding (BB) rat is linked to a frameshift mutation in Ian5, a member of the Immune Associated Nucleotide (Ian) gene family on rat chromosome 4. This lymphopenia leads to type 1 (insulin-dependent) diabetes mellitus (T1DM) at rates up to 100% when combined with the BB rat MHC RT1 u/u genotype. In order, to better study the lymphopenia phenotype without possible confounding effects of diabetes or other autoimmune disease, we generated congenic F344.lyp rats by introgression of lyp on diabetes-resistant MHC RT1 lv1/lv1 F344 rats. Analysis of thymic CD4 and CD8 T lymphocytes revealed no difference in the percentage of CD4 CD8 + and CD4 + CD8 subsets in lyp/lyp compared to +/+ F344 rats. The same subsets was however dramatically reduced in blood (P=0.005), spleen (P=0.019) and mesenteric lymph nodes (MLN) (P<0.0001). Compared to F344 +/+ rats double positive CD4 + CD8 + T cells were increased only in lyp/lyp spleen (P=0.034) while double negative CD4 CD8 were increased in thymus (P=0.033), spleen (P=0.012), MLN (P<0.0001), and peripheral blood (P<0.0001). There were no signs of inflammatory lesions in organs and tissues in F344.lyp/lyp rats examined at 120 days of age or older. We thus conclude that the lymphopenia phenotype was reconstituted by introgression of lyp on to F344 rats without subsequent development of organ-specific autoimmunity. The congenic F344.lyp rat should prove useful to dissect the mechanisms by which the Ian5 frameshift mutation affects T cell selection, differentiation and maturation without organ-specific autoimmunity.",

            "text": "Diabetes in the BB rat is associated with autoimmunity not only to the pancreatic islet cells but also to other endocrine organ [1] ; BB rats were found positive for autoantibodies to gastric parietal cells, thyroid colloid antigens, smooth muscle cells and thymocytes [2, 3] . The genetic susceptibility to autoimmune diseases is notoriously complex; however, the BB rat has proven to be a very useful model to dissect the genetics of organ specific autoimmunity [4] [5] [6] [7] . First, lymphopenia (lyp) on chromosome 4 is absolutely required for diabetes along with MHC RT1 u/u, on chromosome 20 [4, 8, 9] . To study the Iddm1/lyp locus in the absence of the other Iddm loci, we generated a congenic strain (DR.lyp), where lymphopenia (lyp) and Iddm1 from a line of inbred diabetic prone BB rats (BBDP) was introgressed on to the genome of inbred diabetes-resistant BB rats (BBDR) by marker assisted selection [10] . This congenic rat strain has confirmed that a single locus is responsible for both T cell lymphopenia and spontaneous autoimmune diabetes. In the 6 years since we completed the congenic DR.lyp line, and in all recombinant animals developed from this strain, we have never had an animal develop diabetes without lymphopenia (lyp). The lymphopenia gene (lyp) has a recessive mode of inheritance and in specific pathogen free (SPF) condition type 1 diabetes occur in 100% of homozygous lyp/lyp BB rats but not in lyp/+ or +/+ congenic DR.lyp animals [5, 10] . In our previous cross-intercross analysis we showed that the MHC RT1 lv1/lv1 or u/lv1 was sufficient to protect lymphopenic lyp/lyp rats from developing diabetes [11] , also demonstrating that RT1 u/u was a more important risk factor for thyroiditis than for lymphopenia [12] . The lymphopenia in diabetes prone BB rats [13, 14] is due to a mutation in a novel (Ian) related gene, Ian5 [5, 6] . The frameshift mutation in Ian5 is linked to a marked reduction in both CD4 + and CD8 + T cell subsets in the peripheral blood and secondary lymphoid organs. Along with this, the RT6.1 differentiation marker (also known as Art2a) is markedly reduced and at the same time there is an increase in Thy.1 positive T cells [15] . While the specific mechanism of lymphopenia is still unclear, in order to more fully examine the consequences of the Ian5 mutation in different genetic background, we generated a congenic line F344.lyp rats in which the critical lyp region has been introgressed on to the diabetesresistant F344 rat. To rapidly generate the F344.lyp rats (within 30 months breeding), we used marker-assisted selection (MAS). The aim of the present study was to test the hypothesis that introgression of the lymphopenia gene on to F344 rats would induce lymphopenia and tissue inflammation. That would depend on the F344 rat MHC RT1 lv1/lv1, and to produce a rat line in which the function of the defective rat Ian5 gene could be studied without the possible confounding factor of background T1DM.",

F344 rats were purchased from Charles River (Wilmington, MA, USA). The parental DR.lyp/lyp rats were selected from our 10th cycle of (BB) crossintercross between DP and DR rats [10] . These rats have the lyp gene introgressed on to the inbred DR rats and are referred to as DR.lyp rats. The congenic line was generated by MAS in five cycles of cross-intercross breeding with whole genome scanning for F344 homozygosity at non-Lyp loci. At 25-30 days of age the rats were weaned and ear marked, a tail biopsy was taken to extract DNA for genotyping and at the same time peripheral blood was collected for T cell phenotyping.",

Continuing with the same strategy, we produced an N5 generation and again used a total genome scan to select those animals to be used for inbreeding by sister-brother intercross. As described below, those animals carried only the F344 alleles of markers outside the lyp region, and so the N5 lyp/+ rats were intercrossed to generate F1 rats, the founders of our line of F344.lyp congenic rats.

The rats were healthy and did not develop any signs of diabetes, thyroiditis, tissue infiltration, inflammation or any other autoimmune disease. Our results therefore support the notion that lyp alone does not cause diabetes or thyroiditis which are both dependent on the u/u (or similar) genotype [12] . More importantly, there was no sign of any other autoimmune disease, which suggests that the lv1/lv1 MHC genotype in F344 rats is resistant to spontaneous organ-specific autoimmunity. Since both the sexes of the lyp/lyp rats gained weight normally as compared to lyp/+ and +/+ F344 rats we also conclude that lyp does not have any effect on body weight. As expected, we noted a profound reduction in the number of peripheral T lymphocytes in the F344.lyp/lyp rats, which indicates that the lymphopenia phenotype was successfully reconstituted by introgression of the critical lyp gene region on to F344 rats. The single nucleotide mutation in the Ian5 gene [5] that causes a truncated protein suggests that the expression of the Ian5 gene should affect the T cell subsets in our F344 congenic-line.",

The differences in percentages of CD4 + CD8 + and CD4 CD8 subsets between lyp/lyp and +/+ F344 rats indicate an abnormal differentiation of T cells in the F344.lyp/lyp rat thymus (Table 2 ). These findings were not consistent with earlier studies showing that the frequency of CD4 + CD8 + and CD4 CD8 subsets was not different between BBDP and BBDR [20] , and BBDP/Ed and congenic lymphopenic PVG-lyp/lyp (RT1u) and (RT1c) rat thymocytes [19] . The increase in the percentage of CD4 CD8 + T cells in the thymus of F344.lyp rat is however not consistent with earlier studies showing a reduction in thymic CD8 single positive T cells. It should be noted that the extent of reduction in CD8 thymocyte numbers caused by the lyp defect might be influenced by other genes in the BB rat [19] . Differences were reported in the RT6 + , Thy-1 + , and CD25 + T cell subsets in the congenic line F344.lypRT1 u [21] . Our congenic line carrying the RT1.lv1/lv1 showed an increase in the percentage of Thy-1 + in spleen, MLN, and peripheral blood. We speculated that this difference is caused solely by the lymphopenia gene. Since in our study we used congenic lymphopenic rats, which have only the short lyp region from the BB rat, and there is no possibility of interference of other genes from the BB rat we conclude that the lyp mutation does cause an increase in the percentages of double negative CD4 CD8 and a reduction of double positive CD4 + CD8 + T cells in the thymus.",

            "text": "In conclusion, our data demonstrate that introgression of lyp is an efficient approach to cause lymphopenia but proved insufficient to induce frank autoimmune disease development in the F344 rat. The F344.lyp rats therefore represent a unique line in which lymphopenia is expressed in the absence of diabetes or other apparent autoimmunity. The F344.lyp/lyp rats represent a perfect tool to study lymphopenia independent of autoimmune abnormalities and should be useful to determine whether the Ian5 gene is a key factor in T-cell development. If the mechanisms of Ian5associated T cell development can be clarified in this rat, it should be possible to demonstrate whether (as we expect) similar mechanisms are applicable to human T-cell development. Finally the understanding of the genomic organization of the Ian gene family and the possible interaction between these genes during T cell differentiation may help to elucidate the possible role of T cells in human type 1 diabetes and other autoimmune disorders.",
