            "text": "Strategies to protect building occupants from the risk of acute respiratory infection (ARI) need to consider ventilation for its ability to dilute and remove indoor bioaerosols. Prior studies have described an association of increased self-reported colds and influenza-like symptoms with low ventilation but have not combined rigorous characterization of ventilation with assessment of laboratory confirmed infections. We report a study designed to fill this gap. We followed laboratory confirmed ARI rates and measured CO 2 concentrations for four months during the winter-spring of 2018 in two campus residence halls: (1) a high ventilation building (HVB) with a dedicated outdoor air system that supplies 100% of outside air to each dormitory room, and (2) a low ventilation building (LVB) that relies on infiltration as ventilation. We enrolled 11 volunteers for a total of 522 person-days in the HVB and 109 volunteers for 6069 person-days in the LVB, and tested upper-respiratory swabs from symptomatic cases and their close contacts for the presence of 44 pathogens using a molecular assay. We observed one ARI case in the HVB (0.70/person-year) and 47 in the LVB (2.83/person-year). Simultaneously, 154 CO 2 sensors distributed primarily in the dormitory rooms collected 668,390 useful data points from over 1 million recorded data points. Average and standard deviation of CO 2 concentrations were 1230 ppm and 408 ppm in the HVB, and 1492 ppm and 837 ppm in the LVB, respectively. Importantly, this study developed and calibrated multi-zone models for the HVB with 229 zones and 983 airflow paths, and for the LVB with 529 zones and 1836 airflow paths by using a subset of CO 2 data for model calibration. The models were used to calculate ventilation rates in the two buildings and potential for viral aerosol migration between rooms in the LVB. With doors and windows closed, the average ventilation rate was 12 L/s in the HVB dormitory rooms and 4 L/s in the LVB dormitory rooms. As a result, residents had on average 6.6 L/(s person) of outside air in the HVB and 2.3 L/(s person) in the LVB. LVB rooms located at the leeward side of the building had smaller average ventilation rates, as well as a somewhat higher ARI incidence rate and average CO 2 concentrations when compared to those values in the rooms located at the windward side of the building. Average ventilation rates in twenty LVB dormitory rooms increased from 2.3 L/s to 7.5 L/s by opening windows, 3.6 L/s by opening doors, and 8.8 L/s by opening both windows and doors. Therefore, opening both windows and doors in the LVB dormitory rooms can increase ventilation rates to the levels comparable to those in the HVB. But it can also have a negative effect on thermal comfort due to low outdoor temperatures. Simulation results identified an aerobiologic pathway from a room occupied by an index case of influenza A to a room occupied by a possible secondary case.",

            "text": "Respiratory viruses are aerosolized through breathing, talking, coughing or sneezing and may become infectious bioaerosols (La Rosa et al., 2013) . Infectious bioaerosols have a capability to simultaneously infect a large number of hosts and cause large outbreaks if the source case rapidly sheds large numbers of infectious bioaerosols, as in the case of measles (Riley et al., 1978) . In addition, bio-aerosols are able to reproduce the full spectrum of disease at doses much smaller than those required by a large droplet transmission (Tellier, 2009) . Alternatively, when a source case sheds very slowly, secondary attack rates are much lower as suggested in an analysis of human rhinovirus transmission by Myatt et al. (2004) . Historically, airborne transmissions have been implicated in transmission of acute respiratory infections (ARIs) in a jail (Hoge et al., 1994) , military barracks (Brundage et al., 1988) , office buildings (Myatt et al., 2004) , college dormitories (Sun et al., 2011) , and residential buildings (Yu et al., 2004) . Most significantly, an analyses of household intervention studies suggested that approximately half of within-home influenza A transmission resulted from exposure to fine particle infectious bioaerosols . What all of these reports have in common is a high occupant density within rooms. What is less clear is movement of viral aerosols between rooms connected via air pathways, as is well described for transmission of tuberculosis (Nardell et al., 1991) .",

However, without knowledge of the relationship between exposure to infectious viral aerosols and risk of infection (i.e. viral particles per infectious quantum) for the specified disease, it is not possible to accurately predict risk of infection and optimal ventilation rate. If a proper ventilation rate for airborne infection control is to be derived, in-situ observations of both ventilation and ARI rates are needed in actual buildings. This study is part of a comprehensive study to develop early biomarkers of contagiousness to identify ARI cases soon after the exposure to an infectious agent and before a case transmits the infection. It is purposed to investigate ventilation rate impact on the spread of ARI diseases by airborne transmission in two college dormitory buildings at a state university in the U.S. According to the preliminary investigation, the measured average CO 2 level was found to be approximately four times higher in a dormitory building with poor ventilation than the average CO 2 level in a dormitory building with good ventilation . Coupling these CO 2 data with the observed viral shedding from 142 influenza cases during 2012-2013 season (Yan et al., 2018) , the inhalation exposure during an 8-hour night was calculated by a new equation (Rudnick and Milton, 2003) that originated from Eq. (1). The calculation predicted exposure to 6 to 79 infectious particles per person depending on average ventilation rates in these dormitory rooms . These results confirmed the importance for an in-depth understanding of building ventilation impact on airborne transmission.",

Importantly, the set point temperatures for the mechanical air-conditioning systems are the same in these two buildings, i.e. 21\u00b0C in winter and 23\u00b0C in summer, in accordance to the university campus energy standards.

CO 2 sensors were placed high on the wall, opposite to the windows and next to the doors, to avoid being near student beds or desks and receiving a direct plume of exhaled CO 2 . This location creates a possibility for an increased sensitivity to airflow with an open door, but this would be less impactful to the measured CO 2 values than direct airflow from a window or exhalation from room occupants. In addition, Gateways/ Routers were installed to transfer the data from Paragon sensors to a server. The sensors collected data points every 15 min to conserve batteries and still allow dynamic monitoring in private student dormitory rooms during the four months of the experimentation. The original data collection began in October 2017 and ended in May 2018, which includes test deployments, sensor calibration, and improvements in experimental protocols. Therefore, the data used in the analysis of building ventilation rates and the calibration of the multi-zone models were collected in the final four months of the experimental time period.",

Sensor calibration occurred at two points in time. The initial sensor calibration was done in January 2018, and the final calibration was done in June 2018. The sensors were put in pressurized chambers for three hours at known CO 2 concentrations of 500, 1000, and 5000 ppm.

Symptom onset was February 6th for the first case and February 7th for the second case. The two cases were further analyzed to model the potential for aerosol spread of influenza A viruses from the room of the case with the earlier onset into the surrounding rooms with multi-zone modeling by introducing influenza A virus (RNA copies) bioaerosols as a contaminant in the model. Analysis of influenza aerosols in exhaled breath and air in healthcare facilities consistently demonstrates the human influenza aerosols are predominantly in the < 5 \u00b5m size range Noti et al., 2012; Milton et al., 2013; Yan et al., 2018) . Therefore, in the simulations, bioaerosols were assumed to have an aerodynamic size of < 5 \u00b5m, and treated as a gaseous contaminant (Tang et al., 2006) . According to the measurement of the clinical-epidemiology team, limit of detection (Armbruster and Pry, 2008) for influenza A virus was 250 virus particles per 30 min sample. The shedding rate was calculated to be 354 viral RNA per hour for the infected occupant in the source room. Considering that influenza may be contagious prior to onset of symptoms, the simulation time period for the spread of infectious bioaerosols was from February 5th to February 7th, 2018. Because we had no information about when the index person stayed in the room, the simulation assumed a continuous source for influenza A virus. The airflow rates were calculated with the LVB model with closed airflow paths and used to map the flow of air and contaminant between the adjacent rooms.",

This process resulted in 668,390 useful data points from over 1 million measurements that represented a success rate of roughly 67% in the data collection effort under a very limited access to the sensors. Fig. 5 shows data distribution of the CO 2 concentrations in the dormitory rooms for both HVB and LVB. In both buildings, the data measured by each sensor greatly varied with the hourly occupancy rates, especially evident in the LVB. As shown in Table 2 , both the average and standard deviation of CO 2 concentrations were lower in the HVB. These results were expected because, assuming constant generation rates, the lower the ventilation rate the higher CO 2 concentrations due to a slow process of dilution. In accordance with the local wind conditions shown in Fig. 1(b) , the average and standard deviation of CO 2 concentrations were higher in the dormitory rooms at the leeward side of LVB. Furthermore, Table 3 also shows that the dormitory rooms at the windward side of the building had a better ventilation and lower ARI rates than those at the leeward side of the LVB. It should be noted that, a total of 4546 CO 2 concentrations measured by 27 HOBO sensors installed in the LVB dormitory rooms exceeded the upper limit of 5000 ppm. This upper detection limit was met in 0.7% of all useful CO 2 data points. Therefore, the variation and the average of CO 2 concentrations in the LVB dormitory rooms are slightly underestimated due to the upper detection limit of HOBO sensors being at 5000 ppm. Fig. 6 shows the variations of hourly averaged CO 2 concentrations on weekdays and weekends in the double rooms in both buildings. Only the data in double rooms were chosen to directly compare the results in two buildings. This constraint is appropriate because all studied dormitory rooms in the HVB, and 91% of the studied dormitory rooms (62) in the LVB were double rooms. Importantly, Fig. 6 does not include the data measured during the spring break (March 18th-25th, 2018) because these data sets are not representative of typical room conditions when occupants were present. As calculated, daily average CO 2 concentration was 1219 ppm on weekdays and slightly higher with 1231 ppm on weekends in HVB. The daily average CO 2 concentration was 1375 ppm on weekdays, and it had a much higher value of 1540 ppm on weekends in the LVB.",

In the HVB, with steady outside air supply by the DOAS system, the hourly averaged CO 2 concentration for each room were in a repeatable and narrow range throughout the day. In the LVB, infiltration could not provide sufficient outside air to counteract the changes in CO 2 source strength, i.e. number of occupants. On weekdays, hourly averaged CO 2 concentrations in the LVB rooms and their standard deviations showed a similar variation trend. In the morning, they slowly increased to the peak at around 10 AM. This was more likely to be caused by the increased metabolic activity during waking, not by the increased occupancy. They then decreased as the student left for classes, and started to increase again after 8 PM as most of the students came back their rooms, and finally trended to a stable value after the students fell asleep. The hourly averaged CO 2 concentrations and their standard deviations had a similar variation pattern during weekends, but the peak in the morning and the time of onset in CO 2 increase during the evening both shifted by one hour ahead. The results were consistent with concept that CO 2 generation rates from building occupants generally increases with their physical activity levels (Persily and de Jonge, 2017) and the idea that students usually spent more time in the dormitory and were more active in their dormitory rooms on the weekends. This potentially resulted in a greater exposure risk on the weekends for the students when they were staying in their rooms, because they generated more bioaerosols and had greater inhalation rate.",

The individual ventilation rates were gradually decreased with the increase in room occupancy, which could not be captured with the room ventilation rate calculations. For example, in the HVB, the residents in single rooms had almost twice the amount of the outside air compared to the amount for those living in triple rooms. The individual ventilation rates in the LVB had the same trend, but much lower values. As a result, only 4.2% of LVB dormitory rooms (12 out of 286) had individual ventilation rates above 5 L/(s person); moreover, all were single rooms except for one double room. And the individual ventilation rate was only 0.76 L/(s person) on average for each resident living in the LVB quadruple rooms.

Most notable is Room 12, which has three windows while majority of other rooms have only one, and therefore experienced a very large increase (17.0 L/s) in ventilation, when they were all opened. The sizeable increase in ventilation due to this minimal open airflow path change indicates the effectiveness of infiltration ventilation in the LVB. The issue with relying on this type of ventilation is the seasonal variation in window usage. Students were less likely to have their window open in January, February, and March, i.e. during the winter respiratory virus season (\"flu season\"), likely due to the low temperature outside. Therefore, it can be assumed that infiltration of outside air through the window leakage is a small percentage of a room's ventilation during the majority of the ARI surveillance period.",

Fig. 12 shows a section of the LVB floor plan; rooms with cases of influenza A were denoted using \"*\" symbol. In this case study, the initial identification of an influenza A virus infection occurred for a participant living in room RM5, while the participant volunteered for screening because of symptoms; a participant living in MR3 volunteered because of symptoms and was identified as infected with the same subtype of influenza one day after. To examine whether the case in RM3 could have been infected via viral aerosol movement between rooms, an aerobiologic pathway between rooms was investigated by simulating the spread of influenza A virus from RM5, using the calibrated multi-zone model with closed airflow paths for the LVB and the fine particle aerosol shedding rate of the case in RM5. Fig. 11 shows the concentrations of viral aerosols in RM5 and RM3 during the simulation period. In both RM5 and RM3 room, the concentrations of viral aerosols reached the steady state 6 h after the release. The residents living in RM3 were exposed to the increasing concentration of influenza A virus during the nighttime on February 5th. And in the following days, they would continuously be exposed to the viral aerosol from RM5 at a concentration of around 0.05 viral RNA/m 3 when they were in their room. Fig. 12 presents the airflows between the zones and modeled RNAcopy concentrations in RM3, RM5, and their neighboring zones, after 8hour simulation period. To illustrate importance of local airflow patterns, Fig. 12(a) shows the airflow map between the zones and RNAcopy concentrations in RM3, RM5, and their neighboring zones. To illustrate importance and complexity of local airflow patterns, Fig. 12 (a) presents the airflows coming in and going out of each room. All of the rooms, except for RM3, had airflows moving toward the hallway. Air entering RM3 from the outside, RM2, and the hallway exited by infiltrated into the bathroom (RM4) through wall leakage and then was sent outside by the exhaust fan located in the bathroom and denoted as F1 in Fig. 12 . As a result, RM3 was unique, the only dormitory room on the hallway that had an aerobiologic pathway connecting it to RM5 (RM5 \u2192 Hallway \u2192 RM3, Fig. 11) , with an estimated viral aerosol concentration of 0.05 viral RNA/m 3 .",

A key finding is that merely identifying occupants of neighboring rooms is not sufficient to characterize exposure and risk. These results clearly demonstrate the strengths of the model in its ability to identify and provide a quantitative estimate of exposure to distantsource viral aerosols within the residence hall. In the current model, however, the estimated exposure to infectious aerosols transported across the hallway were minimal and the cases identified each other as social contacts. Thus, distant-source bioaerosol may be a less likely pathway for transmission between the pair of cases described here. Interestingly, the second case in the pair was observed to be shedding > 10 4 RNA copies/h, but no secondary cases were observed. In terms of infecting persons in neighboring rooms via distant-source aerosols, none would have been expected given the airflow map described (Fig. 12) . Finally, our finding of a strong trend toward increased ARI incidence associated with ventilation rates of less than 5 L/(s person) suggests that very low outdoor air supply rates may be impacting ARI, either by promoting transmission via bioaerosols within the building or by altering host susceptibility to infection.",

These rooms had a decreased ACH with the increase in room volume, because the outside airflow rate primarily depended on the window and wall crack sizes. The reduction in individual ventilation rate along with the increase in room occupancy was most evident in quadruple rooms. Triple rooms had individual ventilation rate comparable to those in double rooms. This may have been related to having window and wall surfaces located at the windward side of the LVB building, and accounted for the trend toward lower ARI attack rates in the triples. Accordingly, locating triple and quadruple rooms at the windward side of LVB-like buildings could improve ventilation within the constraints of the building's capacity.",

            "text": "The study has several limitations with respect to establishing a quantitative relationship between the ventilation rate and ARI incidence, even though a strong trend was observed. These limitations include inherent sample biases in prediction of ventilation rate and observation of ARI incidence. In terms of prediction of ventilation rate, the timing of door/window opening is important. However, this study did not have sufficient data from a sufficiently wide selection of rooms to approximate ventilation on a typical schedule of student door/ window opening habits for all of the rooms. Moreover, the questionnaire about door/window opening was only administered to cases on the day and the days following ARI diagnosis and to contacts of cases on up to seven consecutive days of follow-up. Therefore, with the available survey data, it is not possible to predict an average student schedule of opening windows throughout the flu season. It would be possible to predict these schedules from CO 2 sensors, but these two buildings were only partially instrumented. Sensor maintenance took place only once or twice during the flu season due to limited room access required by campus residential policies and regulations. As a result, the room coverage rate with CO 2 sensors was 32% in HVB, and 24% in LVB; there rooms were used as representative samples for these two buildings. The model prediction can be further improved by collecting additional CO 2 data in the dormitory rooms. Alternatively, the administration of the door/window opening questionnaire to cases and contacts ensured data collection on these critical factors focused on the most critical exposure events, allowing the highest confidence for estimating room-to-room airflow pattern during the relevant time windows. In the future, to remedy the limitation of survey investigation regarding subject and time period selections, we will consider to use motion sensors to record the operation of doors and windows. Such technology can be expected to provide accurate and detailed schedules for door and window opening for all of the rooms of interest during the experimental period.",

            "text": "In terms of ARI incidence, loss of power and potential bias may have been introduced from the skewed participation rates among occupants of the two buildings: 5% in the HVB, and 20% in the LVB. The paucity of person-time contributed by HVB occupants resulted in wide confidence limits and a lack of statistical significance even though the incidence rate ratio was large. Furthermore, we cannot exclude the possibility that the few participants in the HVB were less likely to report symptoms and volunteer for testing than the participants in the LVB where overall participation rate was higher. We note that the HVB residents were students with expressed interest in engineering programs while the LVB residents were students with expressed interest in life sciences and public health. Whether these typical interests are associated with propensity to participate in the study and report illness is unclear. However, these considerations point to a potential for a bias toward overestimating the impact of ventilation and a need to identify methods to increase participation among HVB occupants. Randomization of building assignment so that life science and public health students are not assigned to the LVB every year has not been deemed feasible.",

Transmission at a distance to occupants of neighboring rooms where there is an identifiable aerobiologic pathway (as seen here), when the neighbors are not close social contacts (in contrast to the cases described here) would provide the strongest evidence that a ventilation effect on transmission risk was due to reduced risk of airborne transmission. Alternatively, low ventilation could, in addition to being associated with non-specific building related symptoms, cause increased rates of ARI through a causal impact on host susceptibility to infection. The capability demonstrated here to identify and quantify aerobiologic pathways between rooms will be critical to unravelling these competing, and potentially co-existing effects of ventilation on building occupant health.",

These models also calculated the potential for transport of influenza A viral aerosols between adjacent dormitory rooms and the concentrations and exposures expected for room occupants. According to the results, CO 2 average concentration was 1230 \u00b1 408 ppm in the HVB and 1492 \u00b1 837 ppm in the LVB. Both room and individual ventilation rates in HVB were three times the amount of ventilation in LVB. This difference between ventilation rates in the two dormitory buildings might be overestimated, because the simulations applied closed airflow paths throughout the whole studied period. Nevertheless, in this study, an individual ventilation of 5 L/(s person) distinguished high ventilation and low ventilation buildings.",

Thus, alternative measures, such as careful placement of triple and quadruple dormitory rooms and possibly dividing some quads could be explored for impact on ventilation. Importantly, a case study on the cross-contamination of influenza A virus shows that airborne transmission needs to be analyzed based on the detailed airflow map, rather than the spatial relationship between the rooms. Overall, occupants in poorly ventilated buildings, such as the LVB, may have to play an active role in ensuring adequate ventilation and reducing their risk of suffering from ARIs.",
