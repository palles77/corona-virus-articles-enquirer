Likewise, S gene sequencing of CCV strains has shown that they have a closer relationship to type II FCoVs than to either type I FCoVs or to TGEV (Horsburgh et al., 1992; Wesseling et al., 1994; Horsburgh and Brown, 1995) . In fact, the type II FCoVs apparently evolved by a double recombination between type I FCoVs and CCV (Herrewegh et al., 1998) . Another genetic region that distinguishes among these coronaviruses is at the very 3% end of the genome. Both CCV and FIPV have open reading frames (ORFs) 7a and 7b, and thus, are different from TGEV which lacks ORF 7b and has a single smaller ORF 7 because of a 69 nucleotide deletion (De Groot et al., 1988; De Groot and Horzinek, 1995) .",

All six CCV strains produced DNA amplicons of the same size (1082 bp). The CCV amplicons were slightly larger than the DNA amplicon generated by the FIPV strain (1061 bp) and considerably larger than the 367 bp amplicons produced by two TGEV strains. This confirmed that the six CCV strains originally isolated from dogs were similar at the 3% end of the genome because they all were large enough for an ORF 7a/7b region. Fig. 2 shows the deduced amino acid sequences for the N-terminal half of the S-gene for CCV strains UCD-1, UCD-2, TN449, 1-71, NVSL and their alignment with the previously sequenced reference strains Insavc-1, FIPV 79-1146 and TGEV Miller strain. Downstream of UCD-1 strain amino acid 273, all six CCV strains had a high degree of identity (91-99%). However, between amino acid residues 1 and 273, the UCD-1 strain was distinctly different from the other five CCV strains as shown by the percent identity between each sequence pair (Table 1 ). UCD-1 had only 19-20% identity with the other CCV strains in this region while the others were 79-100% identical. Moreover, in this N-terminal region upstream of residue 273, UCD-1 strain had 86% identity to the same region of the TGEV S-gene (strains Miller and Purdue) but only a 24% identity in this ",

Within this group, CCVs and FCoVs are similar at the very 3% end of the genome in that they contain two ORFs, 7a and 7b, downstream of the nucleocapsid gene. In addition, the S gene of CCV strains Insavc-1, K378, CCV-6 and C54 have been sequenced and shown to be more similar to FIPV than to TGEV based on identities at the N-terminal domain of this gene (Horsburgh et al., 1992; Wesseling et al., 1994; Horsburgh and Brown, 1995) . Similarly, in this paper, CCV strains NVSL, TN449, 1-71 and UCD-2 were also shown to be FIPV-like in terms of the N-terminal end of the S protein. However, one field strain, UCD-1, isolated in the late 1970s in California was more like TGEV in this region (amino acids 1-273) than like FIPV. Although the major coronavirus S gene epitopes are further downstream (residues 382-389; 538-543; 586-591), nevertheless, these differences could account partially for antigenic and host range diversity and may affect the efficacy of CCV vaccines. Jacobs et al., (1987) was the first to show the divergence of S gene sequences between FIPV and TGEV and indicated that this region might be a potential cross-over site. These results support this idea in that most CCVs sequenced so far are FIPV-like at the N-terminus of the S protein but strain UCD-1 is TGEV-like. Thus, CCVs have sequences that are homologous to both feline and porcine CCVs. However, no FCoVs have been shown to have TGEV-like sequences in this N-terminal region nor have any swine coronaviruses been FIPV-like.",

Woods and Wesley (1986, 1992) were able to infect pigs directly with CCV strain UCD-1 or by contact with dogs infected with an older NVSL challenge strain (DK-1). In contrast, pigs were not infected by CCV strain 1-71 (Binn et al., 1974) . Woods and Wesley (1986) hypothesized that these differences could be due to the inoculating dose of virus or to cell culture adaptation of the UCD-1 strain. Another expla- nation might be that CCVs vary in host range infectivity based on S gene sequence differences or other differences in the genome. The old NVSL challenge strain, DK-1, used by Woods and Wesley (1992) to infect dogs and then was transmitted to contact pigs is not the same as the current NVSL challenge strain (95-08). Sequencing of the S gene of the current NVSL challenge strain suggests that it might not be as infectious for pigs.",

CCV strains 1 -71, TN449 and NVSL are like UCD-2 and did not adapt easily. In contrast, the reference strain Insavc-1, readily infected ST cells on the first pass indicating that more than N-terminal S gene sequences are involved in ST cell infectivity. The reason for the broader infectivity of the Insavc-1 strain for cell cultures is not known. However, taken together, these results suggest that the CCV UCD-1 strain has an increased ability to infect porcine cell cultures, and perhaps, it is more infectious for pigs.
