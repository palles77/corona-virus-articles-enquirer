            "text": "To date, the majority of work on RNA virus replication fidelity has focused on the viral RNA polymerase, while the potential role of other viral replicase proteins in this process is poorly understood. Previous studies used resistance to broad-spectrum RNA mutagens, such as ribavirin, to identify polymerases with increased fidelity that avoid misincorporation of such base analogues. We identified a novel variant in the alphavirus viral helicase/protease, nonstructural protein 2 (nsP2) that operates in concert with the viral polymerase nsP4 to further alter replication complex fidelity, a functional linkage that was conserved among the alphavirus genus. Purified chikungunya virus nsP2 presented delayed helicase activity of the high-fidelity enzyme, and yet purified replication complexes manifested stronger RNA polymerization kinetics. Because mutagenic nucleoside analogs such as ribavirin also affect intracellular nucleotide pools, we addressed the link between nucleotide depletion and replication fidelity by using purine and pyrimidine biosynthesis inhibitors. High-fidelity viruses were more resistant to these conditions, and viral growth could be rescued by the addition of exogenous nucleosides, suggesting that mutagenesis by base analogues requires nucleotide pool depletion. This study describes a novel function for nsP2, highlighting the role of other components of the replication complex in regulating viral replication fidelity, and suggests that viruses can alter their replication complex fidelity to overcome intracellular nucleotide-depleting conditions.",

However, the role of other viral replicase components in replication fidelity has not been studied in detail. We identified here an RNA mutagen-resistant variant of the nsP2 helicase/protease that conferred increased fidelity and yet could not operate in the same manner as high-fidelity polymerases. We show that the alphavirus helicase is a key component of the fidelity-regulating machinery. Our data show that the RNA mutagenic activity of compounds such as ribavirin is coupled to and potentiated by nucleotide depletion and that RNA viruses can fine-tune their replication fidelity when faced with an intracellular environment depleted of nucleotides.",

Little is known regarding other viral or cellular components that might regulate fidelity, and in particular those involved in alphavirus replication. By using RNA mutagens to alter mutation rates, the fidelity determinants within the viral polymerase of many RNA viruses have been identified, including footand-mouth disease virus (1, 2) , poliovirus (3, 4) , Coxsackie B virus (5, 6) , influenza A virus (7) , human enterovirus 71 (8, 9) , chikungunya virus (CHIKV) (10, 11) , and Sindbis virus (SINV) (11) . Mutagenic compounds such as ribavirin and 5-fluorouracil are base analogs that provoke mutations in downstream replication cycles after they are misincorporated into the genome. However, ribavirin also functions as an IMP dehydrogenase (IMPDH) inhibitor, an enzyme necessary for de novo purine biosynthesis and more specifically intracellular GTP levels (12) (13) (14) (15) , whereas 5-fluorouracil inhibits thymidylate synthase, leading to decreases in dTTP and increases in dUTP (16) and thus another imbalance in nucleotide pools. Thus, in addition to avoiding the incorporation of mutagenic base analogs, resistance may arise to overcome imbalances in nucleotide pools. How such resistance could be achieved and whether such variants would present altered fidelity is not known.",

These include four nonstructural proteins (nsP1 to nsP4) required for RNA replication and six structural proteins (capsid, E3, E2, 6K, TF, and E1) necessary for virion production (17) . Of the nonstructural proteins, nsP1 contributes to membrane binding, capping events since the viral guanylyl-and methyltransferase and is also required for negative-strand RNA synthesis (18) ; nsP2 is a multifunctional protein which exhibits helicase, NTPase, and protease activity, as well as carries a carboxy-terminal putative methyltransferase-like domain (19) (20) (21) (22) . In addition to roles in precise viral polyprotein cleavage and processing during the initial steps in replication, nsP2 is also required for cellular transcriptional shutoff during infection (22) (23) (24) . nsP3 harbors macrodomains, zinc binding domains, and a hypervariable region, whereas nsP4 is the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) (25) . These four nonstructural proteins, along with host cofactors, function together to orchestrate efficient genome replication (20) .",

Interestingly, in the initial screen for drug-resistant variants (10), we identified an additional variant of the nsP2 protein that was not further characterized. In the present study, we found this nsP2 variant G641D was resistant to RNA mutagens and increased fidelity through a mechanism independent of the viral polymerase. In addition, biochemical assays showed that highfidelity nsP2 had reduced helicase activity, whereas isolated highfidelity replication complexes increased replication kinetics and resistance to low nucleotide concentrations. Finally, we found the high-fidelity variants to be resistant to other nucleotide biosynthesis inhibitors, such as mycophenolic acid and brequinar, suggesting that these variants were selected due to their ability to utilize and survive in low or imbalanced nucleotide conditions. Taken together, these data provide a novel role for nsP2 in regulating alphavirus fidelity and expand our knowledge on other viral components required to regulate these processes. In addition, our results show that RNA viruses can alter their biology to regulate replication fidelity as the intracellular environment changes.",

In a previous study we identified a novel mutagen- resistant variant of CHIKV nsP2 at position 641 (G641D), suggesting that nsP2 may play an important role in maintaining replication fidelity (10) . To address this possibility, we introduced this substitution into our infectious clone and measured the mutation frequencies of the resulting viral populations in multiple cell types compared to wild-type (WT) CHIKV (Fig. 1A) . This variant manifested increased fidelity in every cell type, indicating that nsP2 is indeed involved in regulating CHIKV genome fidelity. Furthermore, given that both the CHIKV high-fidelity polymerase variant nsP4 (C483Y) and the novel nsP2 (G641D) variants were isolated in the same antiviral treatment, we addressed their additive roles in resistance to the RNA mutagens ribavirin and 5-fluorouracil (Fig. 1B) . Both individual variants were resistant to each drug, and the combination of the two variants (DM) enhanced this further. We then addressed the mutation frequency of each virus in the absence (black bars) or presence (white bars) of ribavirin to examine the extent of mutagenesis (Fig. 1C) . As expected, the wild-type population was mutagenized by the drug to the greatest degree, whereas the higher-fidelity nsP4 variant resisted mutagenesis, as previously reported (10) . The nsP2 G641D single variant led to an even higher-fidelity phenotype than the nsP4 variant. Interestingly, the nsP2 and nsP4 double mutant completely resisted the mutagenic activity of ribavirin. These data suggest that these two proteins work together to regulate fidelity by nonredundant mechanisms, so the nsP2 mutation may have been selected based on the antimetabolic activities of ribavirin and 5-fluorouracil. Given the seemingly synergistic role of nsP2 and nsP4 in regulating fidelity, we sought to determine whether the nsP2 fidelityincreasing mutation could compensate for the low-fidelity activity of a mutator variant of the nsP4 polymerase ( Fig. 1D and E) . To analyze this, we took advantage of a previously identified nsP4 variant C483G that has an increased mutation frequency and found that the combination of low-fidelity nsP4 with high-fidelity nsP2 yielded an intermediate mutation frequency, further suggesting these two viral components both contribute to replication fidelity.",

A protein alignment of the alphavirus nsP2 revealed that CHIKV and a close relative, O'nyong nyong virus (ONNV), also contain a glycine at this corresponding position, whereas other alphaviruses contain a glutamic acid (Fig. 2A) . Interestingly, the increase in fidelity observed in G641D was conferred by a change to negatively charged aspartic acid, mirroring the charge of the naturally occurring glutamic acid in other alphaviruses. Therefore, we hypothesized that there is an essential requirement for a negative charge at this position for maintaining fidelity. To address this, we introduced a glutamic acid at position 641 of CHIKV and observed a decrease in mutation frequency similar to the G641D variant (Fig. 2B) . In a previous study, we had observed that SINV maintained a lower basal mutation frequency (higher native fidelity) than CHIKV (11) . When we changed the analogous residue in SINV from a glutamic acid to the glycine normally observed in CHIKV, the mutation frequency of SINV E650G nearly doubled (Fig. 2B ). In addition, we found that SINV with the nsP2 E650G change was sensitive to ribavirin treatment (Fig. 2C) , a phenotypic confirmation of reduced replication fidelity (6, 11) . Taken together, these data implicate nsP2 as a key regulator of alphavirus replication fidelity, which functions together with nsP4 to maintain genomic integrity.",

To further study the role of these high-fidelity variants and their function in the viral life cycle, we determined one-step growth curves to address viral replication and RNA production and yet found no differences between these variants ( Fig. 3A and B) . This does not, however, rule out differences that may occur intracellularly or early during infection. nsP2 functions as the viral protease early during infection, cleaving the viral polyprotein in a temporal manner, which regulates multiple steps in RNA replication (35) (36) (37) . To address the kinetics of polyprotein processing, we performed pulse-chase experiments on the WT and the nsP2 G641D variant, looking specifically at the cleavage of nsP1 and nsP2 dur- ing the initial steps of infection, and yet no differences were observed ( Fig. 3C and D) . In addition to being the viral protease, nsP2 functions as a helicase and NTPase. To address these functions, we took advantage of a recently developed biochemical assay using purified nsP2 (21, 33) . We purified WT nsP2 and the G641D variant and found no difference in protein purity by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 4A ) or protein folding by circular dichroism spectroscopic analysis (Fig. 4B) , suggesting that this mutation does not affect protein structure. Next, we addressed the in vitro protease activity of nsP2 by using a substrate containing the nsP2/3 cleavage site linking two larger protein fragments (21) . We found no difference in nsP2 protease activity at 6 min (early events) or 1 h (late events), confirming our results from tissue culture pulsechase analysis (Fig. 4C) . Interestingly, when we used a more sensitive FRET based protease assay using the nsP3/4 cleavage site, we observed a slight increase in protease activity with the G641D variant ( Fig. 4C and D) . The nsP2 5A-PG variant was used as a negative control. In addition, we addressed the helicase activity of the G641D variant, and we found no difference in helicase activity in the presence or absence of ATP and Mg 2\u03e9 after incubation for 1 h (Fig. 5A and B) . To address this further, we performed kinetic assays to look at the early events in RNA unwinding ( Fig. 5C and   D) . Here, we found the G641D variant to present impaired helicase function early in the boost phase of unwinding and to plateau at a lower level compared to wild-type nsP2. Finally, we looked at the relative NTPase activity of these purified proteins and found that the nsP2 high-fidelity variant G641D exhibited increased NTPase activity for all NTP substrates in vitro ( Fig. 5E and F) . The 5A-PG variant was used a negative control.",

As an alternative approach, we isolated functional replication complexes by differential centrifugation from infected cells to determine the kinetics of in vitro RNA synthesis and biochemical characteristics of these complexes, which contained equal amounts of all viral proteins (Fig. 6A) . We found that highfidelity nsP4 variant C483Y and the double mutant had more rapid kinetics compared to wild-type, whereas the nsP2 variant G641D had an intermediate phenotype ( Fig. 6B and C) . These increased replication kinetics and NTPase activities of nsP2 lead us to hypothesize that the high-fidelity variants are better able to access or utilize nucleotide pools, increasing the overall rate of polymerization. Because ribavirin is known to deplete GTP pools, we hypothesized that increased polymerization in limiting NTP conditions could lead to the resistance we observe in the presence of ribavirin. To study this, we incubated isolated replication complexes in low nucleotide concentrations and addressed the amount of RNA synthesized in vitro ( Fig. 6D and E) . We found that whereas wild-type replication complex activity was reduced roughly 2-fold when nucleotides were limiting, the activity of all three high-fidelity variants was reduced to a greater extent under these conditions (Fig. 6E) . Taken together, these data suggest that high-fidelity variants of nsP4 and nsP2 may reduce their replicase activity to become more selective to nucleotide pools and replicate more efficiently even at low nucleotide concentrations. CHIKV high-fidelity replicase variants confer resistance to inhibitors of nucleoside biosynthesis. The nsP2 and nsP4 variants were selected in the presence of ribavirin, an RNA mutagen that is also a purine biosynthesis inhibitor. Therefore, we hypothesized that the antiviral effects of ribavirin on viral growth should be at least partially complemented by the addition of exogenous nucleosides. Indeed, we found that the viral growth of the highfidelity variants increased with low concentrations of guanosine, and at high concentrations all viruses, including wild type, were rescued (Fig. 7A) . As a control, we added uridine, which was unable to rescue viral growth to the extent of guanosine. These data reinforce previous studies that the antiviral effect of ribavirin contributes at two levels: at the primary level of nucleotide depletion and at the secondary level as a RNA mutagen.",

We thus sought to determine whether these variants were resistant to other nucleotide-depleting compounds, using mycophenolic acid and brequinar, which are not nucleoside analogues. Mycophenolic acid inhibits IMPDH, acting analogously to ribavirin to deplete GTP pools. In contrast, brequinar is a compound that acts by inhibiting dihydroorotate dehydrogenase, a key enzyme in pyrimidine synthesis, depleting both CTP and TTP (38, 39) . By treating cells during viral infection with each compound, we found that the high-fidelity nsP2 variant and double mutant were more resistant to both nucleotide-depleting compounds ( Fig. 7B and C) , similar to what we observed with ribavirin treatment. Interestingly, the nsP4 high-fidelity variant was not resistant to pyrimidine depletion and the addition of this variant to nsP2 G641D did not further enhance the resistance of the single nsP2 mutation, suggesting that nsP2 and nsP4 may function independently under these condi- tions. Furthermore, viral growth was restored with the addition of relevant exogenous nucleosides, whereas the addition of irrelevant nucleosides was not effective for restoring viral growth, confirming that nucleotide depletion was leading to viral attenuation. Taken together, these data show that high-fidelity variants are more resistant to nucleotide-depleting conditions and that the selection of these variants in the presence of these compounds suggests that RNA viruses can regulate their fidelity to compensate for such intracellular changes.",

            "text": "The vast majority of work focusing on RNA virus replication fidelity has highlighted the essential role of the RdRp in maintaining genomic integrity. Past works were largely facilitated by selecting for viruses resistant to RNA mutagens, thus yielding a polymerase that is more resistant to nucleoside analogue misincorporation. In a previous study, we passaged CHIKV in the presence of mutagens in order to identify a high-fidelity alphavirus polymerase. Unexpectedly, in the process we uncovered a variant of the helicase/ protease (nsp2 G641D) in addition to a high-fidelity polymerase variant (C483Y) (10) . Here, we explored the role of this variant and nsP2 in resistance to RNA mutagens, fluctuations in nucleotide pools, and fidelity. We found that this single substitution in nsP2 led to resistance to several RNA mutagens, as well as nucleotide synthesis inhibitors. In addition, this variant increased the fidelity of CHIKV in multiple cell types, providing a novel role for the nsP2 protein in the viral life cycle and demonstrating that other nonstructural proteins play important roles in RNA replication fidelity aside from the polymerase itself. One possible explanation for these changes in fidelity could be due to changes in physical interactions between nsP2 and nsP4, particularly since these mutations were always found on the same genomes in the original screen for resistance to ribavirin and 5-fluorouracil. Nonetheless, this does not rule out the possibility of differences in physical interactions or binding affinities with other viral nonstructural proteins in the replication complex. Interestingly, mutations in the nsP1 of SINV conferring ribavirin resistance have been described (40) . It would be interesting to test whether these mutations in nsp1 also alter viral replication fidelity by mechanisms similar to what we describe for nsP2 G641D. Currently, nonpolymerase fidelity determinants for RNA viruses have only been described in coronaviruses, which are unique in having a proofreading RNase (ExoN) (41) . Manipulating ExoN or its viral cofactor nsp10 yields variants with altered fidelity (42) . Helicaselike accessory proteins, on the other hand, are common across many RNA viruses and may be a more general mechanism of complementing RNA polymerase fidelity. Not only did the nsP2 variant confer resistance to ribavirin and 5-fluorouracil, but the addition of the nsP4 high-fidelity polymerase variant further increased resistance to these mutagens, supporting that these two proteins are functionally linked to modulate replication fidelity by complementary mechanisms. This was highlighted by the additive increase in fidelity of the double mutant containing a high-fidelity polymerase, and the restoration of wild-type-like mutation frequencies in the double mutant containing a low-fidelity polymerase. In fact, the nsP2-nsP4 highfidelity double mutant showed no sign of mutagenesis in the presence of ribavirin. These results suggest that these high-fidelity replication complexes are selectively incorporating nucleotides in such a way that ribavirin cannot enter the replication complex or be incorporated into the growing RNA strand possibly due to selective steric hindrance or increased affinity to intracellular nucleotides. Importantly, our data suggest that the mutagenic effects of base analogs resulting from misincorporation is potentiated under conditions of nucleotide depletion, when natural bases may not be available or accessible. This finding is of importance to optimize the design of future nucleoside analogues, to either more closely resemble natural nucleotides and/or increase their effects on natural nucleotide pools.",

In previous studies, we observed that the mutation frequency of SINV was naturally lower than that of CHIKV. The amino acid sequence alignment of this region between several alphaviruses indicated that, with the exception of ONNV, other alphaviruses contained a negatively charged glutamic acid instead of a glycine ( Fig. 2A) . This negatively charged residue is similar to the aspartic acid that was selected in ribavirin treatment, suggesting that having a negative charge at this position plays an important role in maintaining replication fidelity. Indeed, when we changed the G641D variant from an aspartic to a glutamic acid to mimic the other alphaviruses we obtained the same high-fidelity phenotype. Furthermore, when we changed the glutamic acid of SINV to a glycine, we increased the mutation frequency of SINV, appreciably further confirming the role of this residue and nsP2 protein in determining replication fidelity of this virus genus. Importantly, if manipulating this residue is a genus-wide determinant of fidelity, mutator variants for other alphaviruses could be easily obtained. Mutator strains, which are known to result in attenuation in vivo (6, 11, 43) , could provide novel therapeutic vaccine strategies.",

Using this system, we identified differences in the relative helicase and NTPase activity of the 641D variant. We observed a trend in increased NTPase activity for all nucleotides but a reduction in helicase activity in vitro. Overall increases in NTPase activity by G641D combined with the WT polymerase of (relatively) lower fidelity may provide support as to why the nsP2 641D replication complex is most sensitive to ribavirin misincor- poration among the high-fidelity viruses (compare Fig. 1C , C483Y and G641D), whereas a combination of nsP2 641D and 483Y yields a complex that is largely unable to acquire ribavirin. In addition, slower helicase activity may provide a basis for selective nucleotide incorporation. However, it should be noted that although these results are intriguing and this system is robust and sufficient for studying purified nsP2, it is lacking all other components of the replication complex, which have yet to be successfully expressed in vitro. These missing components will more then likely influence many aspects of nsP2 biology, and thus these in vitro results, while informative, should be interpreted with this in mind.",

In contrast to previous work showing reduced replication rate can increase selectivity and fidelity, we found that high-fidelity replication complexes had increased kinetics compared to the wild type. An explanation for this discrepancy could be the ability of the replication complex to receive and process nucleotides at an increased rate (due to changes in the structural arrangement of the replication complex) and thus have a greater ability to access and process the necessary components for RNA synthesis, while still possessing a high-fidelity state. Nonetheless, these results, which are in contradiction to the observations that a polymerase that makes fewer errors generally manifests a slower polymerization rate (44) . It is also possible that such contrasting results are caused by technical differences in the assays used, since correct nucleotide incorporation assays use synthetic substrates and purified polymerases in isolation, in abbreviated nucleotide incorporation cycles. Regardless, it is likely that replicase function and fidelity is not only regulated at nucleotide access but at multiple levels, including RNA structure, replicase protein-protein interactions and processivity, RNA-protein interactions, and host components, all areas that need to be addressed to fully understand replicase fidelity.",

We found that all of the high-fidelity variants resisted the antiviral effects of mycophenolic acid better than WT CHIKV, whereas only the nsP2 G641D variant conferred resistance to brequinar. In addition, viral growth could be rescued with the addition of relevant exogenous nucleosides. These results in tissue culture support our in vitro and biochemical results that high-fidelity variants are able to function better in the presence of low levels of nucleotide. In particular, the resistance of nsP2 G641D and not nsP4 C483Y to brequinar and pyrimidine depletion may explain the enhanced NTPase activity of the G641D variant to the pyrimidines CTP and UTP. Furthermore, since we were able to completely restore virus titers after drug treatment with the addition of exogenous nucleotides, our data do suggest that these compounds may be more effective RNA mutagens only when natural nucleotide pools are concomitantly depleted, an observation that is supported by the ability to complement the mutagenic effect of ribavirin and mycophenolic acid with the addition of relevant nucleosides (45) . In summary, we show the essential role and novel function of nsP2 in maintaining alphavirus replication complex fidelity. Furthermore, our evidence supports the long-standing hypothesis for a concerted and dynamic interaction between viral helicases and polymerases to orchestrate replication fidelity (46) . These studies highlight the mechanisms by which RNA viruses respond to their intracellular environments to replication fidelity in low nucleotide concentrations. Given that many nucleoside analogs and RNA mutagens are already used or being considered in clinical settings, understanding the mechanisms by which they increase mutation rates will facilitate their use as broad-spectrum antivirals.",
