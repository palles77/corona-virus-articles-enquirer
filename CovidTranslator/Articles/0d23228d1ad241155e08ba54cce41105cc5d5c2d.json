It comprises a simple stomach, duodenum, 'jejunoileum' (jejunum and ileum are indistinguishable), and colon. Ferrets lack a caecum or ileocolic junction. The normal gastrointestinal transit time is rapid, varying from 148 to 219 min. 1 The ferret gut is also extremely reactive and commonly demonstrates a strong inflammatory response from a variety of aetiologies. Chronic gastroenteritis is common, and in the author's experience often results in clinical disease, or in alterations of gut function, such as delayed gastric emptying and greatly slowed gastrointestinal transit times.",

Second, there are commonly held misconceptions regarding ferret gastroenteric disease, which persist despite considerable histopathologic evidence which should force us to rethink some of the current views of the ferret gut. This chapter is an attempt to present ferret gastrointestinal (and hepatic) diseases in a logical and practical format, emphasizing those diseases with high clinical relevance, and de-emphasizing some diseases which have received much attention to date but which may be clinically less important.",

Research models have promoted Helicobacter as a significant gastric pathogen in the domestic ferret, based on its ability to produce lesions in controlled research settings. 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 These studies have shown that Helicobacter is common in the ferret stomach and may be nearly ubiquitous in the domestic ferret population, at least in the USA. Typically, when an organism is so universally distributed in a host population, it is well host-adapted and tends to behave as 'normal flora' in most situations. Our clinical experience supports this; Helicobacter appears to have low pathogenicity in most of our ferret patients; in some cases, it may produce a mild to severe lymphoplasmacytic gastritis. Prior authors noted clinical disease occurring mostly in 3-5-month-old stressed ferrets. 15 However, this organism is now often assumed to be responsible for gastritis, gastric ulcers, or other gastrointestinal lesions in both young and old ferrets. Often the diagnosis is unconfirmed and response to antibiotic treatment is interpreted as confirmation of the disease. There are, however, multiple gastrointestinal disorders that show clinical improvement with antibiotic therapy (due to resolution of secondary bacterial overgrowth in the gut); response to treatment is non-specific and does not verify a specific aetiologic agent. Helicobacter has been claimed to cause diarrhoea with progressive wasting, 15 which are signs one would not expect even with gastric pathology; every case we have seen has had concurrent enteric disease (separate from Helicobacter) which was producing these clinical signs. Chronic blood loss due to severe gastric ulceration might, in severe cases, be able to produce wasting disease.",

The original studies promoting Helicobacter as a ferret pathogen involved small numbers of animals and lacked histopathologic examination of the gut, other than the stomach and proximal 1-2 cm of the duodenum where Helicobacter could be expected to colonize. 10,11,12 Concurrent enteritis or generalized gastroenteritis would not have been detected. Some studies utilized ferrets from a large breeder facility known to have coronavirus enteritis in its ferret population 12, 17 ; this virus causes lymphoplasmacytic inflammation of the ferret gut. 18 Whether concurrent coronavirus infection would influence histopathologic findings in those Helicobacter studies is unknown. In a study utilizing combination drug therapy to eliminate ferret Helicobacter infection, 17 bacterial eradication was proven successful, but the level of gastritis did not improve in five out of six ferrets. This is in contrast to human research with Helicobacter pylori which demonstrated that bacterial elimination produced resolution of gastritis. 19 Such results should make us question whether Helicobacter was the only inciting agent of the gastritis in those research cases. Perhaps a Helicobacter-induced gastritis might persist awhile after bacterial elimination, as can sometimes occur with humans; or perhaps other factors were inciting the inflammatory response. Some reports state that Helicobacter infection in ferrets is associated with chronic gastritis that increases in severity over time. 14 Whether this occurs in non-stressed house ferrets in normal clinical situations is less certain. Review of another study suggests only mild pathology induced by experimental infection: all four ferrets had Helicobacter colonization of the gastric fundus and antrum, but the fundal mucosa showed negligible changes, and the antral mucosa showed only mild inflammation in three ferrets (the fourth remaining normal). The severity of the lesions did not increase during the 6-month interval of the study. 10 Helicobacter has been shown to occasionally incite development of lymphoma in the gastric mucosa (in the mucosa associated lymphatic tissue, i.e. 'MALT' lymphoma). 13 It should be noted that other forms of gastroenteritis can commonly lead to lymphoma, occasionally in the gastroenteric mucosa, but more often in the mesenteric lymph nodes associated with the gut; 8 see Inflammatory bowel disease.",

In most cases, the bacteria seem to be an incidental finding or at most a partial contributor to the inflammatory lesions. When the stomach is biopsied 2-3 cm proximal to the pylorus, we find Helicobacter only about 4% of the time, with only about 2% of cases having a large number of bacteria present -yet biopsies taken in this region reveal significant gastritis also. This is in contrast to the claims made in the original research studies of Helicobacter mustelae, wherein the researchers proposed a causal link between the bacteria and inflammatory lesions due to visualizing a close geographic association of the bacteria to the observed lesions. 11, 12 In the author's experience, most ferrets with gastritis also have enteritis which equals or exceeds the gastric lesions in severity. In a recent sampling of 115 recent gut biopsy cases, only 34 cases (29.5%) had pyloric gastritis which was more severe than the enteritis; of these, only 22 (19%) had detectable Helicobacter on pyloric area biopsy. By contrast, 81 cases (70%) had enteritis which equalled or exceeded the gastritis in severity -in 53 cases (46%) the enteritis was much more severe than the gastritis on biopsy. Helicobacter should not produce these enteric lesions; in hundreds of enteric biopsy samples (silver-stained), we have never detected Helicobacterlike organisms in mid-duodenal or jejunal biopsies, nearly all with enteritis present. Detection of Helicobacter-like organisms in intestinal fluid contents or the bowel lumen is to be expected; the organism must pass through the gut and out of the body if it is to infect additional hosts. But no causal link between this bacterium and active enteritis can be concluded, when the organism cannot be detected in any biopsies of intestinal mucosa.",

In conclusion, most ferrets with gastric disease have a more generalized gastroenteritis, with Helicobacter present either incidentally or as a partial contributor to the gastric lesions. Only a small percent of cases (1.7%) showed heavy Helicobacter growth in the gastric mucosa with a significant gastritis and minimal enteritis; these cases may be examples of primary Helicobacter gastritis. Based on these data, it is evident that although the bacteria may be pathogenic in certain situations, Helicobacter-induced pathology is probably far less common in the ferret than is currently assumed, and the bacteria are blamed for many lesions which in reality are being induced by unrelated pathology.",

Diagnosis ideally should be confirmed with surgical biopsy (not endoscopy); this allows for histopathologic sampling both of the pyloric stomach and small bowel, as well as mesenteric lymph nodes (to assess for cellular or architectural atypia and risk of lymphoma development). (See Inflammatory bowel disease discussion regarding lymph node histopathology.) If gastritis with Helicobacter in the lesions is confirmed via biopsy, or if the clinician elects presumptive treatment to eliminate possible infection, then several treatment protocols are available. In the past, metronidazole at 20 mg/kg p.o. b.i.d./t.i.d. plus amoxicillin at 10 mg/kg p.o. b.i.d./t.i.d. for 14 days or longer was said to eliminate infection. 14 More recent protocols have increased dosing, frequency and duration of therapy due to apparent antibiotic resistance developing. 13 Addition of bismuth subsalicylate (Pepto-Bismol) 0.5 cc p.o. b.i.d. may enhance treatment effectiveness, as bismuth compounds may aid bacterial elimination. 17 One may add acid blockers such as ranitidine (Zantac) at 3.",

Elevation of lipase over 500 IU/L at commercial US veterinary laboratories, 5,6 or over 1000 IU/L using an in house IDEXX VetTest\u00ae machine 7 is consistent with gastritis or gastroenteritis in ferrets. In the author's experience, clinical pancreatitis is rare in ferrets, and produces serum elevations of both amylase and lipase. Gastric lipase seems to be the main component of most serum lipase elevations in ferrets, and amylase remains low (<100 IU/L). 8 Serum lipase elevations of gastroenteric origin have been documented in dogs and cats. 25, 26, 27, 28 Elevated serum globulin levels suggest inflammatory response; most confirmed IBD cases have high serum globulin levels, between 3.0 and 5.5 g/dL. 8 Serum globulins higher than 6.0 g/dL can be seen with very severe IBD, but Aleutian disease virus must be considered as a differential diagnosis whenever serum globulins approach 6.0 g/dL or above. ALT and GGT may be elevated due to secondary lymphocytic hepatitis or less commonly suppurative hepatitis (see Hepatic diseases). CBC findings are variable. A leukocytosis may be present, with a relative or absolute lymphocytosis. In other cases, a neutrophilia may be seen, suggestive of secondary bacterial infection in the gut or liver. Because chronic gastroenteritis is common, insidious and potentially fatal, annual comprehensive CBC and chemistry profiles should be recommended on all ferrets over 3 years old.",

The pyloric area biopsy should be just proximal to the pylorus itself, toward the lesser curvature of the stomach. Bowel biopsies should be on the antimesenteric border. Full thickness biopsies should be obtained ideally. A 5-7 mm wedge is easily taken for gastric biopsies; intestinal biopsies are typically only 2-3 mm long. A reversed scalpel blade is used to nick the antimesenteric surface of the bowel; the tissue everts with gentle digital pressure, allowing trimming of tissue off one margin with curved Metzenbaum scissors. Closures with 5-0 monofilament such as PDS or Maxon in simple interrupted pattern work well; gentle technique is impor- Lymph node biopsies should be taken if any mesenteric nodes are visible. The most commonly enlarged and easily visualized are the gastric lymph nodes located in the fat near the lesser gastric curvature, and the duodenal (peripancreatic) node located just caudal to the pylorus. Figure 9 .5 shows a grossly enlarged duodenal lymph node at the proximal end of the duodenum near the pylorus; a very large gastric lymph node is also visible in the fat near the lesser curvature of the stomach. Reactive lymph nodes in ferrets, unlike those of dogs and cats, demonstrate a gradation of pathology, which may be difficult to interpret: they may progress from mild to severe hyperplasia, then exhibit considerable cellular and/or architectural atypia, prior to transformation into lymphoma. A pathologist accustomed to interpreting canine and feline lymph node biopsies may mistakenly diagnose lymphoma in ferrets when the nodes are only hyperplastic or preneoplastic. Therefore, pathologists not familiar with the histologic appearance of ferret lymph nodes should interpret nodal changes conservatively. Lymphoma should be suspected when histologic exam reveals obliteration of nodal architecture, and when gross exam of the patient reveals very large firm mesenteric or peripheral lymph nodes. Hyperplastic nodes, even when fairly large (over 1 cm diameter) are usually soft, and often oedematous; they may rupture when handled and drain serous fluid. Neoplastic nodes tend to be firm and solid even when sectioned. Ideally biopsy an entire node, as wedge biopsies may not represent the complete nodal architecture or cell population especially if the wedge sample enters a lymphoid follicle. Patients with cellular or architectural atypia in the nodes (which signify a potential for future transformation to lymphoma) warrant aggressive treatment. Figure 9 .6 is a (ventral aspect) diagram of gut and lymph node biopsy sites in the ferret. If serum ALT or GGT elevations were noted, the liver should be biopsied as well; the tip of a lobe (such as the quadrate lobe) may be easily biopsied via suture ligation. Biopsies should be read by a pathologist experienced in interpreting ferret gut histopathology. The author's samples are read by Dr Mike Garner. a The gut and lymph node lesions are identified, and graded as mild, moderate or severe, and any atypia is noted. Possible contributors to gut inflammation, such as Helicobacter or cryptosporidia are also noted when detected.",

Initial therapy may include controlling existing sequelae such as gastric ulcers or bacterial overgrowth/enteritis; some patients present in poor condition and require aggressive supportive therapy prior to any surgical biopsy. Patients with signs suggestive of bacterial enteritis (diarrhoea, mucoid stools, green stools, bruxism, anorexia, thin body condition) may be treated initially with enrofloxacin at 5 mg/kg Ideally, long-term treatment should be based on gut histopathology. Treatment may begin once post-surgical healing is complete, usually 10-14 days postoperatively. If gastric biopsies reveal a significant Helicobacter presence coupled with lymphocytic gastritis, treatment to eliminate this organism should be initiated (see Helicobacter gastritis). Alternatively, as most ferrets carry Helicobacter in their gastric mucosa, one may decide to treat every gastritis patient presumptively, although Helicobacter may not be a significant contributor to gastritis in many patients.

Our drug of choice is azathioprine (Imuran); long experience with this drug in ferrets has shown it to be superior to corticosteroids in several respects. Corticosteroids used at immunosuppressive doses in ferrets will eventually produce unwanted side-effects, including loss of body condition (muscle wasting, fat deposition and 'pot belly'), hair thinning, increased risk of gastric ulceration, and hepatopathies. Patients with pre-existing hepatic pathology such as lymphocytic hepatitis or vacuolar hepatopathy (from concurrent adrenal endocrinopathy) seem particularly prone to prednisone-induced hepatopathies. These patients will sometimes demonstrate clinical malaise and severe elevation of serum hepatic enzymes (ALT, GGT) after even brief dosing with corticosteroids. None of these sequelae are commonly seen with azathioprine, and bone marrow suppression or immune insufficiency are rare at the doses recommended. Azathioprine is easily compounded into a 5 mg/mL suspension which is pleasant tasting and stable for months. The azathioprine dosing protocol varies depending on the severity of the lesions being treated. Patients with gastroenteritis classified as mild or moderate may be placed on azathioprine dosed at 0.9 mg/kg p.o. q. 48 h. (This conservative dose regimen is also used if the patient did not undergo gut biopsy and is being treated presumptively based on history, clinical signs and CBC/ serum chemistry findings.) The dosing frequency may be increased to 0.9 mg/kg p.o. s.i.d. in patients with severe or refractory clinical signs. Patients with gastroenteritis classified as severe, or who have lymphoid atypia present in gut mucosa or lymph node biopsies, should be placed on daily azathioprine dosing immediately. Cellular or architectural atypia in the nodes suggest potential for future transformation to lymphoma and always should be treated aggressively. If prednisone is used instead of azathioprine, the dose is typically 2 mg/kg p.o. s.i.d.; concurrent use of corticosteroids with azathioprine may increase the risk of drug side effects and is not usually recommended.",

One patient demonstrated a gradual non-regenerative anaemia which improved when the azathioprine dose was reduced.

Therefore, chronic medication and monitoring are usually necessary. Resolution of clinical signs does not indicate a cure; only about half of our IBD patients had recognizable clinical signs prior to treatment, and were detected initially via evaluation of serum chemistries. With early detection, proper work-up and treatment, lymphocytic gastroenteritis can be controlled and severe sequelae avoided in most patients.

This disease is mentioned here because wasting disease and diarrhoea with melaena have been reported in severe cases. 36 In the author's experience, ferrets with significant clinical Aleutian disease usually demonstrate an elevation in total serum globulin, occasionally as high as 14.0 g/dL. Other causes of chronic inflammation such as inflammatory bowel disease may also elevate serum globulin levels. However, total serum globulin levels in excess of 6.0 g/dL tend to be highly suspicious for Aleutian disease viral infection, as other inflammatory diseases usually produce lesser elevations. 8 Aleutian disease virus should be suspected when high serum globulin levels and chronic wasting disease or malaise are noted. Renal disease, mild respiratory distress due to viral pneumonia, ocular lesions such as uveitis, or CNS signs may also be present with this disease. Until recently, serologic confirmation of viral infection was available using counterimmunoelectrophoresis (United Vaccine Lab, USA). This laboratory no longer offers Aleutian virus testing, but the test is now available through the Blue Cross Animal Hospital, which has obtained United Vaccine Lab's reagents. ",

Ultrasound-guided biopsy may be performed; avoid needle aspirates as they often are not diagnostic (Ch. 17). Most cases warrant gut biopsies as hepatitis in ferrets usually is secondary to chronic gastroenteritis; include the mesenteric lymph nodes (see Inflammatory bowel disease). Suture ligature of a lobe tip is an easy biopsy technique, if no focal hepatic lesions are noted. Treatment is similar to that for inflammatory bowel disease. Azathioprine dosed at 0.9 mg/kg every 1-2 days p.o. is recommended long term; monitor progress via evaluation of serum ALT and GGT regularly (and lipase/ globulin, if these are elevated due to gastroenteritis). Also evaluate the CBC 4 weeks after initiating therapy, then every 3-4 months thereafter while using azathioprine. Human studies have shown that azathioprine combined with low dose prednisone controlled inflammation as well as high dose prednisone alone. Some anecdotal reports in canine chronic active hepatitis indicated improved results when azathioprine was used with prednisone, as opposed to prednisone alone. 39 In ferrets, prednisone can exacerbate hepatic pathology in some cases and is not recommended. Some ferrets with pre-existing hepatopathies may demonstrate severe elevations in serum ALT levels soon after prednisone dosing begins, often with profound clinical malaise. 4 Cases with severe or refractory elevations of ALT or GGT may benefit from addition of ursodiol (Actigall) at 15 mg/kg p.o. s.i.d. to reduce biliary stasis via thinning of biliary secretions; it also has anti-inflammatory effects. S-adenosylmethionine (SAMe) may be of benefit in some cases also -it reportedly has antioxidant and cell membrane-protective properties. The typical dose is 20 mg/kg per day for dogs; we have not evaluated its use in ferrets at this time. Silymarin (milk thistle) is a flavinolignan mixture with purported antioxidant properties. Its efficacy in treating liver disease in humans, dogs, cats and ferrets has not been demonstrated adequately.",

Mild cases may be subclinical, but severe cases can be acute and dramatic. There is probably underlying lymphocytic gastroenteritis present in most cases, leading to intestinal bacterial overgrowth, ascending biliary inflammation, and lymphocytic hepatitis, all of which predispose the patient to bacterial cholangiohepatitis. In a few cases, liver biopsies reveal neutrophilic infiltration patterns suggestive of bloodborne sepsis, but most are portal hepatitis typical of ascending disease from the GI tract. 4 Acute severe cholangiohepatitis produces significant clinical signs: lethargy, anorexia, fever, vomition or diarrhoea may all occur, as well as icterus. Normal ferrets may have a slight yellowish cast to the skin due to sebaceous secretions, and icterus may be subtle and overlooked. The nose, ears and oral cavity are good locations for visualizing icterus, as is the serum (Fig. 9.9 ). Urine may be vivid deep yellow or greenish tinged with bilirubinuria.",

Serum chemistries in a sample case showed ALT = 4035 IU/L, AST = 596 IU/L, GGT = 102 IU/L, alkaline phosphatase normal, lipase = 605 IU/L, globulin = 3.1 g/dL and glucose = 53 mg/dL. Treatment is via surgical resection if possible. Gross findings are one to many dark irregular liver-coloured masses involving one or more liver lobes, with visible metastasis sometimes seen. Solitary masses may be excised; with more aggressive lesions debulking the tumour mass might slow the clinical progression for a time. The prognosis is poor if the lesions are not detected early.",

Histologic findings would typically be a primarily plasmacytic inflammatory infiltrate in the gut tissues. 4 Treatment is primarily supportive care and anti-inflammatory medication; azathioprine dosed at 0.9 mg/kg p.o. s.i.d. has reduced serum globulin levels and reduced severity of signs in some of the author's patients. Broad spectrum antibiotics such as enrofloxacin 5 mg/kg p.o. b.i.d. plus amoxicillin 10 mg/kg p.o. b.i.d. may reduce severity of diarrhoea and malaise by reducing secondary bacterial overgrowth or enteritis.
