Our skin, gut and mucosal surfaces are colonized by many bacterial species and we may be exposed to potential infectious agents through the air, food and water, contact with other people or in some circumstances via vectors such as insects. Normally our relationship with microorganisms is one of symbiosis. Indeed, humans have co-evolved with microorganisms to such an extent that it is known that normal host\u00c0microbe interactions are essential for many aspects of normal mammalian physiology [1] . So what are the factors that determine whether these agents live in peaceful co-existence with us or lead to local (Fig. 36 .1) or disseminated infection ( Fig. 36. 2), even resulting in death?",

More recently, a mathematical approach to the subject has permitted new insights into these processes. In the 1970s the concept that infectious diseases were eradicable was entertained by many physicians in developed nations; the success of sanitation, vaccination, public health and a battery of antibiotics reassured many that humanity's greatest scourges were on the verge of extinction. Plagues and epidemics have always dwarfed the slaughter of the battlefield. In 14th-century Europe, for example, bubonic plague killed 25 million of an estimated population of 100 million. Local populations could be devastated: the village of Eyam lost 258 of 360 persons to the plague in 1665. The concentration of populations in cities and towns of Europe in the Industrial Revolution led to increased numbers of epidemics such as cholera. Typhus killed some 2.5 million Russians between 1918 and 1921; 20 million died of influenza in 1918\u00c01919. The 21st century is not without its own epidemics such as the influenza ('swine' flu) pandemic of 2009 or the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic in 2003. So why do epidemic or pandemic outbreaks of disseminated infection occur? There is no single simple answer to this question but the scene is set by the introduction of a virulent organism capable of dissemination into a susceptible population.",

From a clinical perspective only some 400 organisms cause infectious diseases in humans, although the exact number is difficult to determine. This needs to be seen in the context of the fact that there are some 1000 species of bacteria co-habiting or colonizing each individual. An adult human has about 10 13 eukaryotic cells, but there are some ten bacterial organisms for each of these, most of which are concentrated around epithelial surfaces. There is no particularly active or inflammatory immune response to FIGURE 36.3 Typical sites of bacterial colonization in humans. All of the organisms here may act as pathogens in the right clinical setting, usually when there has been a breach of the mucosal surface and an increase in the density of surface bacteria. Some organisms, however, are common colonizers but have a much higher pathogenic potential. the vast majority of these but it is alterations in these relationships which result in invasion. It is evident that being surrounded by bacteria is of evolutionary advantage to the human host, and indeed studies of germ-free animals suggest that the presence of colonizing bacteria and perhaps viruses is associated with nutritional and immunological advantages, and prolonged lifespan. These advantages are clearly also relevant to the colonizing species. This situation of mutual support has a number of species-specific characteristics; those organisms found normally in a sheep, cow, dog or cat are distinct from those in humans.",

In the majority of cases bacteria establish infection by crossing mucosal epithelial surfaces such as those of the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts.

Once through the epithelial barrier the organism must be able to pass through the body and evade host defences. Examples of specific cellular targets for microorganisms during adhesion, invasion and dissemination are listed in Table 36 .1 and strategies for evading host responses in Table 36 .2. Commonly, dissemination occurs via the blood but some pathogens, such as Salmonella typhi and many viruses, are transported through the lymphatic system to regional lymph nodes where multiplication occurs. This may be followed by a phase of further lymphatic or bloodstream dissemination.

Firstly, the bacteria may be successfully cleared with no ill effects \u00c0 indeed we all experience transient bacteraemia on a daily basis during activities such as teeth cleaning [7] . Alternatively, the organism may multiply with potentially dire systemic consequences of severe sepsis, organ failure and death. Finally, the organism may disseminate via the bloodstream to distant sites leading to local infection such as meningitis, osteomyelitis or abscess formation. Bacteraemia may result in infection of areas of the vascular tree itself, such as a heart valve or vessel bifurcation (endocarditis) and this focus can lead to further seeding of other body sites. Variations in adhesion molecules, toxins and other virulence determinants also influence the tissue tropism of different organisms when invasion occurs. This variation is even seen within the same species, for example Escherichia coli. E. coli is one of the commonest bacteria colonizing the human gastrointestinal tract and over 170 different serogroups and 50 serotypes have been described. E. coli may lead to a wide variety of clinical syndromes including diarrhoea, urinary tract infection, pyelonephritis, bacteraemia and sepsis. Not surprisingly, E. coli isolated from these clinical scenarios exhibit different molecular determinants leading to disease. For example, gut E. coli may cause diarrhoea through a variety of mechanisms, including adherence to bowel epithelia, invasion of bowel mucosae (e.g. E. coli O157) or toxin production [8, 9] . However, these E. coli strains cause local disease and are not found in the blood. Urinary tract infections are due to E. coli that have the ability to adhere to the uroepithelium via fimbriae that express adhesion molecules that bind to specific host cellular glycoprotein receptors [10] . Isolates of E. coli from lower urinary tract infections express specific type I fimbriae. However, only those that express a different type, called P fimbriae, are able to invade the upper urinary tract, leading to pyelonephritis [10] . Finally, bloodstream isolates of E. coli from patients with severe sepsis may have entered the circulation through a number of different routes. However, variations in surface antigens and fimbriae influence the morbidity and mortality associated with infection [11] .",

            "text": "It is clear from this brief description that dissemination of infection is intimately connected to the interactions between host and organism. Organisms become progressively more invasive as host defences become weaker. Dissemination is therefore one of the principal criteria defining bacterial virulence. In a healthy host the infecting organism must be able to overcome intact host defences including skin and mucosal barriers, innate, humoral and cellular immunity. These defences have evolved over many millennia and pose a formidable hurdle to invading organisms. Bacteria that can overcome such defences can be thought of as highly pathogenic. Once, however, the host is compromised, bacteria and other organisms require less pathogenic determinants to invade and disseminate. Infections by less pathogenic organisms are often referred to as opportunistic. This is discussed in more detail later but it is worth illustrating this point with the simple clinical example of bacterial meningitis. In unvaccinated young children Haemophilus influenzae meningitis is relatively common but almost disappears by age 5 as the children acquire protective antibody, usually following respiratory tract infection. In healthy young adults almost all bacterial meningitis is caused by Neisseria meningitidis (meningococcus) or Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus). These bacteria have the ability to adhere to and penetrate upper respiratory tract mucosae, evade killing in the bloodstream and can penetrate the blood\u00c0brain barrier. If, however, the patient has a severe head injury with a skull fracture through the sinuses then organisms may gain direct entry to the CSF. Meningitis in these patients is often due to staphylococci, streptococci and Haemophilus spp. that are frequent colonizing organisms in the sinuses. If our patient has significantly impaired cell-mediated immunity, for example after organ transplantation, then Listeria, mycobacteria and fungi must be considered as potential causes. The host\u00c0pathogen interaction with N. meningitidis is remarkable given the diversity of interactions that occur \u00c0 from asymptomatic nasopharyngeal colonization through to focal infections of meninges, joints, or eye; to devastating meningococcal sepsis. A high proportion of the population is colonized with N. meningitidis at one time or another. The reason why invasive disease occurs in a very small percentage of individuals remains unclear. Preceding viral infections, inhalation of dry dusty air, or exposure to passive smoking have been associated with invasive disease [12] . The presence of protective antibody appears critical in the prevention of invasive disease, whilst the production of endotoxin is one of the key pathogenic mechanisms.",

This allows rapid growth in situations where there is little crowding of fellow organisms, followed by slower growth whenever the local environment becomes too full of organisms of the same species. The relationship of these changes to human disease is poorly understood but may be significant in determining behaviour of a pathogenic organism. For instance, toxin production by staphylococci is rare in a growing colony of bacteria, but once colony growth is static, toxin production is activated. In contrast, Vibrio cholerae produces toxin while proliferating. Invasiveness is thought to be more likely when streptococci are proliferating rather than static, whilst other bacterial species such as mycobacteria are actually less invasive in the proliferative state. The process of quorum sensing may be extended to involve other organisms too. It is evident that the majority of colonizing organisms survive in a film of fluid and mucus above populations of epithelial cells. This environment or biofilm has characteristics which may be critical in determining the invasive potential or toxin-producing potential of an organism.",

Numerous factors may influence the nature and types of pathogens that we encounter and thus the subsequent risk of infection ( Fig. 36.6 ). Thus, a healthy young adult presenting in the UK with fever and shock is likely to have bacterial sepsis due to meningococcal, streptococcal or staphylococcal infection. These are the commonest causes of community-acquired bacteraemia in the UK and in the absence of immunocompromise or other illness Gram-negative bacteria are far less common. In the same patient presenting in South-East Asia you would also need to consider Burkholderia pseudomallei (meliodosis), typhoid fever, malaria (protozoal) and dengue fever (viral haemorrhagic fever). These organisms can easily be overlooked in countries where these infections are not endemic [15] . On a more local level there are substantial differences in the types of bacteria involved in community-and hospital-acquired infection. Following admission to hospital many factors combine to alter the normal colonizing flora. These include antimicrobial therapy that kills healthy commensal bacteria and spread of bacteria through patient\u00c0patient, staff\u00c0patient and environmental contamination. Within a few days the flora of the nasopharynx changes from predominantly oral streptococci and anaerobes to include enteric Gramnegative bacilli and sometimes Staphylococcus aureus. Over the same period the skin may acquire antibioticresistant staphylococci, enterococci or Gram-negative bacilli that are uncommon in the community. Commonly this leads to no harm and the patient re-acquires normal flora following discharge. If, however, other factors lead to infection such as aspiration pneumonia, intravenous line infection, wound sepsis, etc., then the microbiology of the invading organisms is altered and antibiotic resistance more likely.",

In an effort to reduce mortality and morbidity, the Surviving Sepsis Campaign was launched which has produced guidelines on the management of sepsis. Mortality fell by 5.4% in the 5 years after the introduction of the guidelines and it is hoped a further reduction will occur [24] . Severe sepsis is most commonly related to bacterial infections but may be seen with any class of organisms, including protozoa (malaria), viruses (dengue fever), fungi (Candida) and rickettsia (Rocky Mountain spotted fever). In the past, Gram-negative bacteria were closely associated with septic shock [18] , but recently there has been a marked increase in the proportion of cases related to Gram-positive infection, antibiotic-resistant bacteria and fungi [21, 25] . The full reasons underpinning this shift in epidemiology are not clear but reflect alterations in hospital-acquired infection which has seen the emergence of meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and enterococci as major pathogens within the past 10\u00c020 years. Gram-negative infections remain an important cause of sepsis, however, as many multiresistant organisms are isolated, particularly in the ICU setting [21] .",

Techniques to extract and purify endotoxin were gradually developed and by the 1950s the active fraction of endotoxin was shown to be LPS. LPS is found exclusively in the outer leaflet of the cell membrane of all Gramnegative bacteria. The role of LPS in experimental Gramnegative sepsis was established during the 1970s and the toxic moiety of LPS was eventually identified as a unique glucosamine-based phospholipid called lipid A [26] . The final proof that LPS alone can induce septic shock came when a laboratory worker self-administered 1 mg of purified Salmonella minnesota LPS intravenously in an attempt to treat his cancer. Within a short period of time he developed severe shock and organ failure indistinguishable from classic Gram-negative sepsis [27] . The host response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is complex, involving portions of our innate immune system, circulating factors that both block and enhance LPS activity and cellular response through specific soluble LPS receptors ( Fig. 36.7) . LPS is shed from bacteria during cell growth or when the bacterial cell wall is damaged, for example due to attack by host defences or antibiotics [28] . Free LPS is rapidly incorporated into lipoprotein complexes, from which it may be presented to transport proteins and cellular receptors, resulting either in clearance and detoxification or in cellular activation [29, 30] . LPS enters the circulation on a daily basis with bacterial translocation from the gastrointestinal tract and is generally cleared rapidly by the reticuloendothelial system. When significant Gram-negative infection is present, the amount of LPS entering the circulation may overwhelm this process.",

TLR2 has an intracellular signalling domain with homology to the interleukin 1 receptor, and LPS-induced cell activation is dependent upon signalling through this region. CD14 can recognize bacterial products other than LPS, including cell wall components from Gram-positive bacteria, mycobacteria and fungi. Thus, LBP, CD14 and Toll receptors appear to be an integral part of our innate immune response to a variety of microorganisms.",

The syndrome mainly affected young women at the time of menstruation with shock, diarrhoea, respiratory distress and a widespread macular rash followed by desquamation. Menstruation-associated TSS was found to be caused by a toxin-producing strain of S. aureus [36] that was colonizing the vagina. In this syndrome the organism is not found in the bloodstream and is not disseminated. The organism does not invade deep into body tissues but secretes toxic shock syndrome toxin 1 (TSST-1), absorption of which is sufficient to lead to profound shock and organ failure. TSST-1 acts as a superantigen and induces widespread activation of lymphocytes leading to cytokine release. Superantigens have the ability to bind directly to a subset of lymphocyte T cell receptors, linking them to antigenpresenting cells, thus bypassing the usual antigen-specific pathway of T cell activation [37, 38] . Subsequently nonmenstrual cases of staphylococcal toxic shock have been described with local infection by toxin-producing bacteria at other body sites. Superantigens are not confined to staphylococci and are implicated in some cases of streptococcal toxic shock and may be present in other bacteria.",

The balance of these responses determines whether there is a successful outcome, i.e. eradication of infection and resolution of inflammation, or an adverse outcome, i.e. severe sepsis or persistence of infection. Numerous factors will influence this balance, such as the particular pathogen and site of infection, co-existent disease processes and genetic factors.

Vasodilatation is generally thought to be the result of widespread activation of nitric oxide by cytokines and LPS. In addition, endothelial damage due to the direct action of bacterial products, cytokines and coagulopathy leads to capillary leak and tissue oedema. LPS and cytokines may cause myocardial suppression, thus limiting the ability of the heart to compensate for the fall in SVR [41] .

Here infection at all sites is generally contemporaneous but it is essential to recognize all infected sites to optimise therapy. A good example of this is pneumococcal infection. S. pneumoniae is the commonest bacterial cause of pneumonia and in most patients it remains localized to the lung. About 15\u00c020% of cases are complicated by bacteraemia which is associated with a higher mortality. The risk of pneumococcal bacteraemia is increased by host factors such as smoking, alcoholism, old age, diabetes and immunosuppression [3, 42] . Some patients with bacteraemia will develop pneumococcal meningitis or, more rarely, deep abscesses at other body sites. The dose of antibiotics used needs to be higher when severe sepsis or meningitis is present. A similar process is seen in meningococcal disease, where initial entry occurs through Brain abscess the throat with bacteraemic dissemination. A proportion of patients present in this phase with fulminant sepsis, whilst others progress to exhibit infection at multiple body sites including the skin (meningococcal purpura), joints and meningitis [43] . Failure to recognize metastatic spread and adequately treat all infected sites can lead to treatment failure (Fig. 36.10) . Alternatively, the original focal infection may resolve, but an episode of bacteraemic spread has seeded out a distant site that may lead to clinical disease at a later stage, sometimes many years after the initial infection. In both Lyme disease and syphilis, primary infection occurs at the site of initial inoculation. This leads to erythema chronicum migrans in Lyme disease and a chancre in syphilis. Antibiotic therapy at that time prevents dissemination but patients often overlook the initial lesion. After an interval, bacteraemic spread occurs, which may be asymptomatic or present as secondary manifestations. Again, therapy at this point would lead to cure. Untreated, the patient's symptoms will resolve and they remain well for months or even years before developing late manifestations at distant body sites such as chronic arthritis in Lyme disease or cardiovascular or neurosyphilis.",

This is the scenario in classic subacute bacterial endocarditis. In most cases of endocarditis there is a pre-existing defect in the vascular endothelium, commonly an abnormal heart leading to high-pressure turbulent blood flow and roughened endothelium to which platelets and fibrin adhere. Bacteria may then become trapped in this area and slowly multiply, leading to chronic infection, vegetation formation and low-level persistent bacteraemia. Bacteria may also adhere to and infect vascular prosthetic material. Microemboli containing bacteria can seed any site, giving rise to mycotic aneurysms and abscesses (Fig. 36.11 ). Lung abscesses are associated with endocarditis on the right side of the heart, with systemic abscesses in the spleen, liver, brain and elsewhere from left-sided disease. The commonest causative organisms in endocarditis are given in Table 36 .6. Most of the organisms are not 'high grade' pathogens but tend to be oral or skin commensals. Indeed, endocarditis is a rare complication of bacteraemia due to pathogens including meningococcus, E. coli, pneumococcus and \u03b2-haemolytic streptococci are rare.

The organisms involved also vary: whereas group B streptococcus is currently the most common pathogen in the UK and the USA, historically E. coli was more significant. Enterobacter are becoming increasingly significant in many centres, and in the Asian subcontinent Salmonella spp. or Haemophilus spp. may be of particular significance. The mortality rate was of the order of 80% in the early part of the 20th century, but is now less than 20% in most developed countries. In studies of neonatal infection in which viruses have also been included, it would appear that developed countries see an increasing frequency of viral meningoencephalitis in the neonatal period [46, 47] . Neonatal disease is traditionally divided into early (the first few days of life) and late (up to 8 weeks of age). The mortality is greater in early disease, meningitis is more common in late disease. If the risk factors predisposing to late forms of sepsis are studied epidemiologically, similar risk factors to those outlined above have been found. However, the role of bacterial virulence in such infections is not clear, and is probably significant; in E. coli certain antigens associated with pili formation have been linked to late onset of neonatal meningitis.",

This will generally be from bacteria that are normal commensals of that area and can now act as opportunistic pathogens. So we see skin organisms such as Staphylococcus spp. as the main cause of bacteraemia complicating indwelling vascular lines, E. coli in relation to urinary catheters, and staphylococci and streptococci causing wound infections for example. Do not forget that during hospitalization the commensal flora may alter both in the nature of the organisms and in antibiotic resistance. For example, community-acquired aspiration pneumonia will generally be due to mixed oral flora (\u03b1-haemolytic streptococci and anaerobes), whereas in a hospital-acquired case enteric Gram-negative bacilli must be considered.",

The bacteria encountered will tend to vary from unit to unit.

A minority of organisms have the potential to overcome intact host defences, proliferate and cause infection. The immune response may be able to clear the infection but in some cases widespread immunological activation by bacterial products can lead to widespread tissue damage, shock and organ failure. In other cases the initial response appears to contain the organism but dissemination leads to focal infection at other body sites. Host and environmental factors influence the pattern of colonization by, and exposure to, potential pathogens. Furthermore, host factors, particularly immune impairment, significantly alter the risk and spread of infection. Further understanding of the different strategies employed by microorganisms during tissue invasion and dissemination may ultimately lead to new therapeutic strategies and help to reduce the still significant burden of infectious diseases.",
