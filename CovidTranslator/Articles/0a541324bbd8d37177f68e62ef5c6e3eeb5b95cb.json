Increased expression and activity of APN have been postulated to correlate with the aggressive behavior of several tumor types. In this study, the osteosarcoma cell line MNNG/HOS was stably transfected with an expression vector capable of expressing the antisense transcript of APN. Four stably transfected clones, the control clones and parental cells were characterized. Stable integration of the antisense vector was confirmed by PCR analysis of genomic DNA. Competitive RT-PCR revealed that mRNA expression of antisense-transfectants was decreased to approximately 37% of the control cell line. The activity assay showed that the enzymatic activity of APN was inhibited to approximately 51% of the control cell line. Antisense-transfection had no influence on the cellular proliferation measured by the 3-(4,5dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay, on the motility in Transwell chambers, and on the adhesive potential to collagen I. However, an in vitro invasion assay revealed a significant decrease in the number of cells that migrated through a reconstituted membrane (51% of the control cell line). The adhesive potential to Matrigel was also affected (73% of the control cell line). Furthermore, under in vivo conditions, a reduced potency to metastasize to the lung was shown in an experimental metastasis assay in nude mice. These findings demonstrate that APN plays an active role in the cellular attachment and proteolytic degradation of the extracellular matrix in the metastatic process of osteosarcomas.",

Sequence comparisons of the cloned cDNA revealed that APN is identical to the CD13 antigen, which is the human cluster antigen expressed on the surface of myeloid progenitors, monocytes, granulocytes, and myeloid leukemia cells [7] . APN has been postulated to play diverse tissue-specific roles both in the catalytic and in the non-catalytic pathway. In synaptic membranes, APN degrades enkephalin and endorphins [8] , in the intestinal brush border, this enzyme plays a role in terminating the degradation of peptides as well as in scavenging of amino acids [9] . On vascular cells, APN metabolizes certain vasoactive peptides [10] . In addition, APN has been suggested to play a role in antigen processing and presentation [11] . Cell cycle control and cell differentiation of macrophage/monocyte [12] , and mitogenic activation of lymphocytes [13] have been found to be associated with surface APN activity. Furthermore, APN serves as a virus receptor for the corona virus [14] , and has recently been reported to be involved in signal transduction with p42/ERK2 MAP kinase in a human T cell line [15] .",

Since this protease exerts some influence independent of its enzymatic domain [14, 15, 22, 23] , we decided to employ the antisense strategy for APN inhibition. Antisense RNA blocks APN expression at an early stage of mRNA maturation. Thus, this strategy allows us to affect both catalytic and possible non-catalytic functions of APN. In our study, the osteosarcoma cell line MNNG/HOS was stably transfected with constructs that contained a 1015 bp of 5 -fragment in antisense orientation under control of the potent eukaryotic CMV promoter. To exclude possible artifacts of clonal selection, we isolated 15 antisense clones, four of which showed similar growth properties as well as a sufficiently reduced mRNA expression and enzymatic activity (clone III, V, VII, and X). Since APN is synthesized in a fully active form and unregulated at the cell surface [23] , reduced activity may reflect a decreased protein expression of APN.",

Evaluating three different constructs which corresponded to the 1015 bp of 5 -fragment, 985 bp of 3 -fragment and 979 bp of the middle part of the full-length APN gene in preliminary experiments, we found that the 1015 bp of the 5 -fragment exhibited the strongest and most stable reduction of enzymatic activity of APN. These results, previously observed by others (for review, see [24] ), were not totally unexpected; however, the underlying functional mechanisms remain unclear.",

An anti-growth effect was often observed in studies using peptide inhibitors or anticatalytic antibodies for APN in several tumor types [25] [26] [27] . Particularly significant effects were noted in leukemic cell lines [26, 27] , and one of the inhibitors has even been applied clinically [28] . In contrast to this, Saiki et al. [16] found that although WM15, an anticatalytic antibody, has a potent inhibitory effect on invasion, it did not directly influence tumor cell growth and viability. Two groups have recently reported that peptide inhibitors possess a specific cytotoxicity not mediated by APN [29, 30] . Such an inhibitor-specific toxicity has rarely been reported. Thus, these findings may help to explain the inconsistency of the growth inhibitory effect seen in several inhibitory methods. In our study, direct blocking of mRNA maturation by antisense RNA of APN did not influence the proliferation of osteosarcoma cells for 72 h (Figure 4) .",

Lower expression of APN in antisense clones led to a significantly reduced cellular adhesion to Matrigel, but not to collagen I ( Figure 5 ). Cellular motility was not influenced either (Table 1) . Therefore, we think that APN contributes to tumor malignancy with proteolytic degradation of and cellular attachment to the Matrigel component. These findings are in line with the study of Fujii et al. [18] , who transfected two melanoma cell lines with an expression vector contain- ing full length cDNA in sense orientation. Higher expression of APN led to an increase in the invasive potential, type IV collagenase activity, and adhesion to Matrigel, but not in cellular growth. Furthermore, they performed in vitro digestion of Matrigel and speculated that the main target of APN was entactin/nidogen, a component of the basement membrane. Interestingly, in their study, bestatin did not inhibit cellular adhesion to Matrigel enhanced by sense cDNA transfection. In support of this, another group reported that anti-immune serum for APN did not affect cellular adhesion of tumors [17] . Taken together, the cellular adhesion might be involved in the non-catalytic function of APN.",
