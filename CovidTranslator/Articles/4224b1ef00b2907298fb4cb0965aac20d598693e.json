Twelve other guests became infected including 10 staying on the same floor. These hotel guests subsequently became the index patients who transported the disease to Vietnam, Singapore, Canada, Ireland, and the United States. 2 The primary mode of transmission of SARS appears to be by the airborne spread of large droplets. As the illness has spread, the condition has been particularly prevalent among healthcare workers and their household members. Many cases progressed rapidly and often resulted in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). 3, 4 The syndrome was designated as 'severe acute respiratory syndrome' (SARS) in March 2003. 5, 6 As of July 4, 2003, a total of 8439 cases resulting in 812 deaths (a case-fatality proportion of 9.4%) have been reported from more than 30 countries globally. 7 Taiwan has a population of over 23 million. The development of SARS became a real concern in Taiwan because of the extensive business ties and inter-country travel that exist between Taiwan, Hong Kong, and especially Mainland China, which appears to be the origin of SARS. The first probable SARS patient in Taiwan returned from China via Hong Kong early in the global outbreak in February 2003. 8 For more than a month, the daily incidence cases remained in the single digits until a nosocomial outbreak occurred in a municipal hospital (Hospital A) in Taipei on April 22, 2003. 9 As of July 4, 674 probable cases and 84 deaths have been reported in Taiwan. 7 We analyse the clinical, laboratory, and radiological features of patients with probable SARS who were seen at the Shin Kong Wu Ho-Su Memorial Hospital (SKMH) in Taipei, Taiwan. In addition, we also report the probable index case for the SARS outbreak in Taiwan.",

The patient went to the emergency room of Hospital A in the morning of April 9, 2003. A chest X-ray showed extensive bilateral lower lung infiltrates ( Fig. 1 , Panel A). Soon after arrival in our hospital, she required 100% oxygen through a non-rebreathing mask to maintain her oxygen saturation. A second chest X-ray taken in the afternoon showed progressive changes ( Fig. 1, Panel B) . By that evening, the patient developed progressive tachypnea and had to be intubated. The sputum Gram-stain obtained after intubation showed many inflammatory cells without visible bacteria (Fig. 2) . She was treated with empiric antibiotics, ribavirin and corticosteroids. On the eighth hospital day, her fever subsided, and her oropharyngeal swab came back positive for SARS-associated coronavirus by RT-PCR. On the same day, her husband and son were admitted to other hospitals in Taipei due to fever and pulmonary infiltrates. Both subsequently proved positive for coronavirus by RT-PCR.

The important clues in our reported case included rapid progressive chest X-ray changes and lack of identifiable bacterial pathogen from the initial sputum Gram-stain. Even though the health authority initially excluded the case patient, she was kept in a negative-pressure isolation room, and her family was quarantined. These precautions proved to be prudent, since a positive coronavirus RT-PCR result was obtained one week later.

A similar trend has been described by Peiris et al. with 80% of cases exhibiting radiological worsening at a mean of 7.4 days. 16 Since the initial presentation of SARS is quite non-specific, early diagnosis largely relies on known history of potential exposure to the infection. However, once the disease develops into an epidemic, contact history becomes unreliable. Clinicians must maintain a high index of suspicion since several features of the clinical presentation may be the important clues to differentiate SARS from other infectious diseases. The discovery that a novel coronavirus is the probable cause of SARS 11,19,20 provides a dramatic example of an emerging coronavirus disease in humans. SARS-associated coronavirus fulfills Koch's postulates for an infectious microbiological disease. 21 RT-PCR assay is the most rapid method for the laboratory diagnosis of SARS-associated coronavirus infection. According to a recent cohort study in Hong Kong, viral RNA detection in the nasopharyngeal aspirate has a sensitivity of only 32% at presentation, but testing of multiple nasopharyngeal and faecal samples increased the sensitivity of the RT-PCR assay. 16 In our study, SARS-associated coronavirus RNA was detected in oropharyngeal swabs by RT-PCR in 16 (55.1%) of 29 patients at initial presentation.",

Empirical treatment with a combination of high-dose corticosteroid and ribavirin has been advocated in certain areas. 18, 26, 27 The rationale behind this approach is to reduce both the viral load and the inflammatory response generated by the infection. All of our patients received ribavirin without obvious therapeutic response, and 48.3% of the patients became anaemic. This finding is consistent with Booth et al. who described that 49% of their patients experienced a decrease in the haemoglobin level of 2 g/dl or greater after ribavirin use. 24 Large-dose corticosteroid became the de facto mainstay of our treatment protocol. Most of our patients with clinical deterioration responded to pulse corticosteroid therapy (14 out of 17), including four out of five patients with repeated episodes of deterioration who were successfully rescued by two or more courses of pulse steroid. Recently, a report from Guangzhou by Zhao et al. also supported this approach. 28 However, the use of large-dose corticosteroid is associated with the high attendant risk of infection. Six patients developed several episodes of nosocomial infections in our cohort. We emphasize that appropriate antibiotics coverage and careful microbiological surveillance with judicious corticosteroid use are the key to successful treatment of these patients.",
