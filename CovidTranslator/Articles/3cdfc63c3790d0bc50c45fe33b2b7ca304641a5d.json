            "text": "A fundamental problem of asexual adaptation is that beneficial substitutions are not efficiently accumulated in large populations: Beneficial mutations often go extinct because they compete with one another in going to fixation. It has been argued that such clonal interference may have led to the evolution of sex and recombination in well-mixed populations. Here, we study clonal interference, and mechanisms of its mitigation, in an evolutionary model of spatially structured populations with uniform selection pressure. Clonal interference is much more prevalent with spatial structure than without, due to the slow wave-like spread of beneficial mutations through space. We find that the adaptation speed of asexuals saturates when the linear habitat size exceeds a characteristic interference length, which becomes shorter with smaller migration and larger mutation rate. The limiting speed is proportional to m 1/2 and m 1/3 in linear and planar habitats, respectively, where the mutational supply m is the product of mutation rate and local population density. This scaling and the existence of a speed limit should be amenable to experimental tests as they fall far below predicted adaptation speeds for well-mixed populations (that scale as the logarithm of population size). Finally, we show that not only recombination, but also long-range migration is a highly efficient mechanism of relaxing clonal competition in structured populations. Our conservative estimates of the interference length predict prevalent clonal interference in microbial colonies and biofilms, so clonal competition should be a strong driver of both genetic and spatial mixing in those contexts.",

            "text": "O NE of the most basic questions of evolutionary biology that can be studied in controlled evolution experiments is: How fast do microbial populations adapt to new environments by the accumulation of beneficial mutations? Traditionally, it was thought that the accumulation process is limited by the supply of beneficial mutations (Novick and Szilard 1950; Atwood et al. 1951) . If a rare beneficial mutation arises and becomes sufficiently frequent, it will expand rapidly until it is present in all individuals of the population. After the completion of such a selective sweep, the population is stationary again until the next beneficial mutation arises. The accumulation rate of beneficial mutation should thus be controlled by the appearance of new beneficial mutations, which is proportional to the population size and the mutation rate (Sniegowski and Gerrish 2010) . This scenario of \"periodic selection\" crucially rests on the assumption that mutation rates are so small that beneficial mutations occur strictly sequentially. Evolution experiments of the last decade have shown, however, that beneficial mutation rates in microbes can be as large as 5 \u00b7 10 25 per genome per generation in the bacterium Escherichia coli with typical fitness effects in the range of a few percent Perfeito et al. 2007; Sniegowski and Gerrish 2010) . These high mutation rates have severely restricted the parameter range of periodic selection. Multiple selective sweeps, simultaneously in progress, are characteristic of a well-mixed microbial population containing .10 4 cells (see, e.g., estimates in Appendix D). In the past, most evolution experiments had effective population sizes exceeding this threshold, including the Lenski experiment, in which the bacterium E. coli was evolved for .50,000 generations to adapt to minimal medium (De Visser et al. 1999; Miralles et al. 1999 ; Barrick et al. 2009 ). Accordingly, these experiments did not reveal a linear relation between adaptation speed and population size, but instead a much weaker dependence indicative of a mechanism of \"diminishing returns\" (De Visser et al. 1999; Shaver et al. 2002) . The reason for this behavior is that multiple beneficial mutations arise on different genetic backgrounds simultaneously and compete with one another for sweeping through the population. As a consequence, only a small number of arising beneficial mutations can go to fixation, and most of them are lost in the competition between clones. It was first noted by Fisher (1930) and Muller (1932) that sex relaxes clonal competition and speeds up the process of adaptation as it allows beneficial mutations to be combined in a single genome even if they first appeared in different lineages. Today, this Fisher-Muller advantage of sex is one of the most important explanation for why most organisms engage in some form of genetic exchange.",

Although theoretical models depend on largely unknown effect distributions of beneficial mutations, they all predict that key quantities of interest, including the speed of adaptation and the genetic diversity, depend only weakly (logarithmically) on population size and mutation rates. While these predictions shape our current view of adaptation in large asexual populations, they primarily apply to well-mixed test tube populations of microbes. Many naturally occurring microbial populations attach to surfaces in the form of biofilms exhibiting a pronounced spatial structure (Tolker-Nielsen and Molin 2000; Watnick and Kolter 2000) . Even in laboratories microbes are routinely grown on agar plates by which they acquire spatial structure. More complicated spatial structure is relevant to the evolution of viral populations such as influenza and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), which spread in space via human transportation networks (Hufnagel et al. 2004; Eggo et al. 2011) . Moreover, there is increasing evidence that spatial structure is also important to the evolutionary processes involved in cancer progression (Greaves et al. 2006; Merlo et al. 2006; Salk et al. 2009 ). One might thus wonder whether clonal interference is relevant to spatially extended populations and, if so, whether its effect on adaptation differs from that in well-mixed populations.",

(1937) . Since these adaptation waves spread at a constant speed, mutant clones grow linearly with time and hence much slower than they would if they grew in well-mixed populations. The slowness of selective sweeps has the consequence that growing clones are much more likely to interfere than in well-mixed populations. The link between slow adaptive waves and the potential importance of clonal interference was in fact anticipated by Fisher (1937) in his seminal article on \"The wave of advance of advantageous genes.\" Therein, he considers the concrete example of a mutation with selective advantage s = 1% spreading along a continuously occupied shoreline. He estimates that spreading over 100 miles might take 10,000-100,000 generations and concludes that \". . . at any one time, the number of such waves of selective advance, simultaneously in progress, must be large\" (Fisher 1937, p. 367) .

Therefore, if we plot our data sets for different parameters in one figure using axes V/V 0 and m/m 0 , they should all collapse on a single master curve. The resulting scaling plots for linear and planar habitats are shown in Figure 3 . Data corresponding to constant selection coefficients (Figure 3 , black line) do indeed collapse on a single master curve, even though we varied m, s 0 , and the type of adaptation wave (weak/strong genetic drift). Note also the transition from a linear regime to the sublinear regimes with power law exponents 1 2 and 1 3 in one and two dimensions, respectively. These exponents are consistent with our prediction in Equation 3. Moreover, Figure 3 displays results for simulations in which the fitness effects of new mutations were drawn from an exponential and a gamma distribution (with shape parameter k = 2), respectively. Note that although data for the different distributions follow our scaling predictions individually, they are slightly shifted with respect to each other. This indicates that the prefactors of the adaptation speed depend on the tails of the distribution. Broader distributions tend to yield larger adaptation speeds, apparently because they will more frequently give rise to the sampling of unusually large-s clones that outcompete average-s clones. As a consequence, fixations are more frequent and the adaptation speed is higher (see also Appendix F). The effect is stronger in the clonal interference than in the periodic selection regime.",

Recombinants are produced at a rate r per site from two (haploid) individuals randomly selected from the nearest neighborhood in the parent generation (selfing is allowed). Recombinant genotypes are formed from the parental genotypes by onepoint recombination: The parent chromosomes are paired and a point is randomly chosen by which both chromosomes are split.

A third seed triples the growth rate, etc. In effect, when clonal interference is absent, one obtains exponential growth with the rate",

Importantly, the resulting fast Malthusian growth accelerates the fixation process of beneficial mutations. As a consequence, mutations that would interfere without long-range migration are now more likely to arise sequentially. Consistent with this view, Figure 4 shows that the linear regime of periodic selection is extended to a larger parameter range as the long-range migration rate is increased. Of course, for sufficiently large habitat sizes, clonal interference also occurs in the presence of long-range migration. However, the number of simultaneously competing clones is reduced due to the faster sweeps. This leads to generally larger adaptation rates than for clonal interference without long-range migration, as seen in Figure 4 .",

We expect that similar phenomena to those reported here may be observed in other rapidly evolving populations. Many natural populations are, however, characterized by more complex migration patterns than the stepping-stone model used in our work, for instance, influenza or SARS (Hufnagel et al. 2004; Kaluza et al. 2010; Eggo et al. 2011) . For concrete predictions, the existing model needs to be extended to include these migration networks. There is also increasing evidence that spatial structure is relevant in evolutionary processes related to cancer progression (Salk et al. 2009 ), suggesting that similar modeling approaches may apply (Martens et al. 2011 ). In the following, we estimate under which conditions clonal interference might be observable in microbial colonies and discuss our key predictions and how they may be verified in microbial evolution experiments.",

As a consequence, the regime of clonal interference is inflated in structured populations compared to well-mixed ones. The condition for clonal interference is made explicit by comparing the typical fixation time of a single beneficial mutation with the waiting time for it to arise. We found that clonal interference occurs when the habitat size is larger than a characteristic size L c . The interference scale L c not only defines a crossover, but also measures the typical distance an adaptation wave travels freely before it collides with another wave that arose independently of the first one.

We assume fitness effects on the order of 1% and mutation rates in the range of 10 26 -10 24 per genome and generation. Given the large variance of the thickness of biofilms and microbial colonies, we consider a range of cell densities between 1 and 1000 per square cell diameter. This yields a mutation supply rate m that lies within the range of 10 26 and 10 21 per square cell diameter. For s = 1%, we estimate a deterministic Fisher wave speed c 0 in the range of 0.1-10 cell diameters per generation by assuming that microbes in dense colonies disperse between 1 and 100 cell diameters per generation. Thus, we estimate L c = (c 0 /(2s 0 m)) 1/3 to lie within 4 and 800 cell diameters. The characteristic interference length scale L c = (c 0 / (2s 0 m)) 1/2 for a linear habitat could be relevant for expanding microcolonies. For instance, it has been shown that the expansion of a colony is driven by a thin layer of pioneer cells (Hallatschek and Nelson 2010; Nadell et al. 2010 ). This pioneer population at the expanding front evolves in an effectively linear habitat. Applying similar estimates to the above to the context of an expanding microbial colony, we estimate an interference scale between 50 and 500 cell diameters. Importantly, the length scales both for planar and for linear habitats are much smaller than typical sizes of microbial colonies or biofilms. We thus expect clonal interference to be a widespread phenomenon-rather than the exception-in growing dense cellular clusters that conserve their spatial structure over time.",

Remarkably, we find that in this \"frustrated\" situation, increasing the habitat size does not only lead to an increased loss of beneficial mutation: The adaptation speed actually even saturates to a limiting value V max , which is seen for both constant and distributed selective coefficients (see Appendix F). This speed limit of adaptation and its dependence on parameters were not revealed in a previous study (Gordo and Campos 2006) , seemingly because too small habitats were simulated. A simple approximate expression for the speed limit is provided by Equation 3. In particular, we found that V max is proportional to m 1/2 and m 1/3 in linear and planar habitats, respectively. This scaling was shown to hold for various distributions of fitness effects, including constant and exponentially distributed fitness effects, for very noisy and for deterministic Fisher waves.

Certainly, genetic exchange [in bacteria through lateral gene transfer (Cooper 2007) ] provides a mechanism that lessens clonal interference as it allows one to bring together beneficial mutations that arose on different genetic backgrounds; see Figure 5B . This hypothesis, originally formulated by Fisher (1930) and Muller (1932) , is corroborated by our simulation results in Figure 4A . However, our simulations also show that spatial mixing is a very efficient alternative mechanism of mitigating clonal interference in structured populations. Spatial mixing increases the growth rate of fitter clones and thus lowers fixation times. Lowering fixation times increases the likelihood for beneficial mutations to occur sequentially on the same background, and therefore clonal interference is attenuated. In our simulations, spatial mixing was introduced by allowing for a small rate of long- Figure 5 How can clonal interference and its deleterious effects on adaptation be overcome in spatially extended populations? (A) Standard clonal interference. The scale L c is the typical distance at which adaptation waves collide in the clonal interference regime. (B) Recombination speeds up adaptation by combining beneficial variants (Fisher-Muller hypothesis) . Two clones (red and blue) share interfaces (highlighted white) until recombination occurs (5), and a more fit recombinant arises (violet); another recombination occurs later (yellow and violet result in the green mutant). (C) An alternative mechanism of mitigating clonal interference is provided by spatial mixing, e.g., through long-range migration. Long-range jumps (arrows) accelerate selective sweeps and therefore increase both the interference scale and the fixation probability of beneficial mutations. If clonal interference is strong, spatial mixing is thus predicted to be under strong selection. Stars denote only mutations that eventually reach fixation. range jumps. These jumps enable clones to replicate themselves at distant locations in the habitat, which was shown to lead to accelerated clonal growth, as illustrated in Figure  5C . When clones do not interfere, the growth is exponential. The rate of this exponential growth, or effective selection coefficient s e , was found to depend on both the actual selection coefficient and the rate of long-range jumps (cf. Equation 4). Importantly, we found that, due to these fast Malthusian sweeps, even very small rates of long-range jumps strongly increased adaptation speeds in the clonal interference regime (cf. Figure 4B) . Thus, long-range migration seems highly beneficial in spatially extended populations with homogeneous selection pressures. Nevertheless, it remains to be seen in future work whether alleles conferring the ability of long-range migration are actually selected, even if large jumps impose a danger (for instance, a longrange jump could be fatal to a cell if the cell is swept away to a harmful environment). This evolutionary mechanism could be relevant for biofilm-forming bacteria and select for occasional switching from the biofilm state to the more efficiently dispersing planctonic phenotype.",

As a consequence, the size of a clone follows a random walk on length scales larger than L c . The variance of the size of the winning clones increases over time until it becomes of order L 2 , upon which fixation occurs. Now, if the random walk of the clone size was a normal random walk (similar to, e.g., Brownian motion), we would expect the clone size variance to grow linear with time. Hence, fixation should occur after a time of order L 2 . By contrast, we find much The fixation probability behaves like 2s for small selective coefficients s.

The area of a petri dish occupies $A = pR 2 $ 10 9 square cell lengths. The population in this experiment grows to a final size of N f = 10 10 .

Long-range migration has no effect on the periodic selection regime, because it does not change the limiting supply of beneficial mutations. However, generating seeds may reduce the time for the clone to fixate. As a consequence, effects of clonal interference are mitigated (and thus, the adaptation speed is increased). Moreover, the range of parameters over which periodic selection occurs, characterized by t fix > t mut , becomes larger with increasing rates of long-range migration. We briefly investigate a simple model that explains how long-range migration may lead to an exponential growth of a clone. We assume that waves propagate deterministically (i.e., on straight lines) and that jumps occur before the first (ancestral) clone reaches fixation. Furthermore we assume that at any time there is no more than one mutation present in the habitat (i.e., absence of clonal interference). To effectively generate a seed, an individual must jump from a region already occupied by the ancestral clone to an unoccupied region in the habitat. We denote the average number of such clonal seeds, present at time t, by the variable n\u00f0t\u00de. Furthermore, x\u00f0t\u00de is the average length in a linear habitat (or the area in a planar habitat) that is occupied by the clone. The growth of a clone follows from the following considerations: First, the rate of change of the number of seeds is given by the product of the spatial occupation of the clone, x\u00f0t\u00de, and the rate at which long-range migration events occur per site, i.e., m l . Second, the rate at which the spatial occupation increases, i.e., the effective growth rate of the clone, d x=dt, is twice the velocity of a single wave front times the number of waves present in the population. We denote the velocity of the ancestral clone by c 0 . These considerations are summarized in the following ordinary differential equations:",

Figure F1 demonstrates the same saturation phenomenon when the selective fitness is exponentially distributed. We expect that the saturation behavior documented for constant and exponentially distributed selection coefficients occurs for all subexponential fitness effect distributions. At this point, it is unclear how superexponential distributions might affect the adaptation dynamics.Compared to the case of the constant selection coefficient, a nonzero variance of the distribution of fitness effects g(s) increases the speed of adaptation. For periodic selection, this can be easily understood as follows. The expectation value of the adaptation speed is given by hVi = hNU b 2s 2 i or, more precisely, by Figure E1 Relative increase of the adaptation speed V due to long-range migration. Even a small rate m l = 0.001 of long-range migration drastically increases the speed of adaptation by a factor of $5. Simulations are run with s = const. and parameters s 0 = 0.1, m = 5 \u00b7 10 26 , and the deterministic wave velocity valid for strong selection.",
