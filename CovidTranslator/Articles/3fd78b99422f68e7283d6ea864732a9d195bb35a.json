Malaria is usually an acute febrile illness with symptoms such as fever, headache and chills typically appearing 10-15 days after the individual has been infected. If not treated within 24 h, cases of P. falciparum malaria can progress to severe illness and even death [1, 3] .",

It was estimated that 435 000 deaths from malaria had occurred in 2017 globally [4] . Despite being preventable and treatable, malaria continues to have a devastating impact on human health around the world [5] .

As of 2000, eight countries had eliminated malaria, and many other countries had reduced the transmission to low levels (<100 indigenous malaria cases per year) [5] . In 2016, China was identified as one of the 21 countries that had the potential to eliminate malaria by 2020 [3] . To meet the certification criteria for malaria elimination, a country must prove that the chain of indigenous malaria transmission by Anopheles mosquitoes has been interrupted nationwide (i.e., reducing the rate of malaria cases to zero) for at least three consecutive years. Continued measures are required to prevent the re-establishment of transmission [3, 8] .",

The high-incidence areas were mainly concentrated in central and southern areas of China (Henan, Anhui, Jiangsu, Hubei, Sichuan, Yunnan, Guangdong and Guangxi), while relatively low in northern areas. A previous study reported that the number of malaria cases in Anhui, Yunnan and Hainan provinces accounted for 77.48% of the total cases from 2006 to 2010 and concluded that provinces with high incidence rates were concentrated in central and southwestern China and Hainan [15] . Furthermore, the geographical distribution of malaria tended to concentrate as time progressed from this study. It was also revealed that the spatiotemporal distribution of malaria in China changed from relatively scattered (2004-2009) to relatively clustered (2010-2014) [16] . This mainly resulted from imported cases, since these imported ones from trade activities and international workers would directly increase the number of cases which were not attributed to local climate conditions or mosquitoes density. For mortality, the rates were relatively high in southern China in the 1950s, and the disparity between areas was not obvious and remained at low levels since the 1970s. Seasonal patterns of malaria in China were obvious with the incidence rate peaked in July through September and mortality peaked in August through October. Another study also showed that malaria cases were mostly concentrated in the second half of the year, particularly in July through October [15] . The seasonal and geographical distribution of malaria observed might be associated with the seasonal dynamic of Anopheles mosquito vectors and human population distributions. National surveillance of mosquitoes showed that the mosquito density in the areas south of the Yangtze River was higher than that in other areas, and this corresponded to areas of higher malaria incidences. The density of Anopheles mosquitoes was peaked during June through August [17] . Natural and climatic conditions in summer are more suitable for mosquitoes compared to those in winter. Additionally, the distribution of the population was regional (mainly concentrated in the southeast and central regions), which was also associated with factors such as river network density, temperature and the warming index [18] . The susceptible population was consistent with that of mosquitoes, and these conditions were conducive to the occurrence of the malaria epidemic.",

The susceptibility to malaria among the population was mostly related with the types of transmission (continuous, seasonal or short time). In permanent transmission areas (most African regions), adults developed the immunity and children were more susceptible. While in seasonal transmission areas, the level of exposure was not enough to build a consistent natural immunisation in adults, so the whole population expressed comparable susceptibility. In China, all age groups showed a similar susceptibility to malaria (Supplementary Fig. S4 ) and population at highest risk was exposed to risk factors related to work activities and location of residence [20] . P. vivax is the dominant malaria parasite in most countries outside of sub-Saharan Africa and that P. falciparum is responsible for most malaria-related deaths globally [1, 3] . In China, P. vivax accounted for 76.3% (185 013 cases) of malaria incidence cases and 8.5% (207 701 cases) by P. falciparum between 2004 and 2013. The proportion of malaria deaths attributed to P. falciparum was 87.7% and 6.8% by P. vivax. These results were consistent with other reports [19, [21] [22] [23] .",

The successful control of malaria in China was mainly attributed to the country leadership efforts (national elimination strategy, community mobilisation, case-based surveillance and reference laboratory systems) and the country-led efforts (regional and inter-sectoral collaboration, sustained financial support) [26] . The technical '1-3-7' strategy, which specifies case reporting within one day, case investigation within three days and focuses investigation and action within seven days, was also rolled out and widely disseminated [6] . The timeliness of the implementation of malaria surveillance and response largely improved after the strategy was integrated into the CISDCP system.

The predicted number of malaria cases was 2 914 for 2017 and 2 562 for 2020. The predicted number of deaths would decrease from 13 in 2017 to 10 in 2020. Among those cases, most of which were imported cases and became the major source of disease burden. There will be none indigenous cases during 2016 and 2020 by the prediction compared to the actual three indigenous cases from areas bordering Yunnan and Tibet in 2016, and zero in 2017 [8] . In short, the goal of eliminating malaria by 2020 will be highly probable in China. Along with the vector controlling (insecticide-treated mosquito nets and indoor residual spraying) nationwide [1] , China should give more attention to cross-border areas and imported malaria cases recently [28] . Yunnan and the Tibet Autonomous Region were the only regions that reported locally acquired malaria cases in 2014 [7] . Several high-risk counties in the long international land border still face a persistent risk of malaria introduction and transmission [22] . The imported malaria cases are the key challenges to achieve malaria elimination in China [29] . Since the majority of malaria infections are asymptomatic, active case detection methods in community should also be conducted to overcome the limitations of passive surveillance [30] . A recent study revealed that African ape parasites in the wild are 10-fold more diverse than human P. vivax and exhibit no evidence of species specificity, which means that P. vivax will never be eradicated unless to eliminate malaria from apes, or it can cross the border at any time and cause new malaria outbreaks [31] . Resurgence of malaria may occur if control and surveillance measures are scaled back too early [32] . Historically, a marked increase in malaria incidence worldwide occurred as the funding was cut further [3] . For China, a practical strategy should focus on the investigation and disposal of malaria case and foci in the specific areas and among the high-risk population [33] .",
