HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E are two of the four HCoVs that circulate worldwide and are close phylogenetic relatives. HCoV infections can lead to hospitalization of children, elderly individuals, and immunocompromised patients. Globally, approximately 5% of all upper and lower respiratory tract infections in hospitalized children are caused by HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63. The latter virus has recently been associated with the childhood disease croup. Thus, differentiation between the two viruses is relevant for epidemiology studies. The aim of this study was to develop a double-antibody sandwich enzymelinked immunosorbent assay (DAS-ELISA) as a potential tool for identification and differentiation between HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E. The nucleocapsid (N) proteins of HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E were expressed in an Escherichia coli system and used to immunize mice in order to obtain monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) specific for each virus. Three specific MAbs to HCoV-NL63, one MAb specific to HCoV-229E, and four MAbs that recognized both viruses were obtained. After their characterization, three MAbs were selected in order to develop a differential DAS-ELISA. The described assay could detect up to 3 ng/ml of N protein and 50 50% tissue culture infective doses/ml of virus stock. No cross-reactivity with other human coronaviruses or closely related animal coronaviruses was found.",

Therefore, the aim of the study described in the present report was to establish a double-antibody sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (DAS-ELISA) capable of detecting and distinguishing between HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E. As mentioned in the background, the N protein appears to be the most suitable candidate for use for viral detection. The homology of the amino acid sequence of the HCoV-NL63 N protein with that of the HCoV-229E N protein has been reported to vary from 42 to 49% (15, 20) . Therefore, the N proteins of HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E were expressed in the Escherichia coli system and used to immunize mice in order to obtain monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) specific for each virus and therefore allow the differentiation between them.",

However, this method has some disadvantages, such as possible contamination, instability of the RNA samples, and the need for special equipment that in some cases, in particular, in undeveloped countries, is not available. Other rapid tests are needed in order to facilitate diagnosis. The antigen-capture ELISA using MAbs allows rapid diagnosis of viral infections, and it can be used as an alternative to PCR. On the basis of the low degree of homology among the amino acid sequences of the N proteins of different coronaviruses, together with the high immunogenicity of this protein, the N protein appeared to be a suitable antigenic marker for diagnosis of coronavirus infection. In the work reported here, we described the production and characterization of several species-specific MAbs against the N proteins of human coronaviruses NL63 and 229E and the subsequent development of a differential ELISA that allowed their detection.",

            "text": "As a first attempt to narrow down the location of the epitopes recognized by the antibodies, a fragment covering the C-terminal half of the N protein was expressed and tested in the ELISA with the different MAbs. It has been previously described that the N-terminal half of all CoV N proteins contains a highly conserved motif (22) . However, after two different fusions with the N protein of HCoV-NL63 and the N protein of HCoV-229E, only two out of eight MAbs (1B12 and 2E6) did not bind to the C-terminal half of the N protein (Fig.  2) , indicating that the amino region is less immunogenic, at least in mice. This finding agrees with previous studies with SARS coronavirus N protein, where it was described that the most immunoreactive epitopes were located at the C-terminal end of the protein (31) . The localization of the developed MAbs in this part of the protein was also supported by the results of the competition ELISA. Thus, MAbs specific for HCoV-NL63 (MAbs 1B12, 2D4, and 1E6) which reacted differently with this part of the protein by indirect ELISA did not compete with each other, suggesting that they mapped in different areas of the protein. In contrast, MAbs recognizing both viruses (MAbs 1E8, 1H11, 5D5, and 5D11) and which reacted in a similar way to the C terminus of the protein in indirect ELISA competed with each other, indicating that they map in the same region or very close regions. A detailed study of the C-terminal end sequence of the N protein revealed that although the overall homology between the different species is low, this fragment includes two regions (KPRWKR and QCF GPR) that are well conserved among all the viruses and one that is conserved only between HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E (NGVXAKG) (Fig. 4) . This observation, together with our results, leads to the conclusion that the conserved sequence between HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E probably includes the epitopes of the selected common MAbs, although further experiments using peptides should be done in order to answer this question. As shown in Fig. 2B , the reactivity of MAb 1E7 (specific for HCoV-229E) with the C-terminal fragment was stronger than the reactivity with the full-length protein. This could be due to the structure of the protein, with the epitope becoming more accessible in the fragment than in the complete protein.",

The results of the DAS-ELISA demonstrated that the MAbs were species specific when the recombinant N protein was used as the antigen. This was also true when virus-infected cell lysates were used (Fig. 3) .
