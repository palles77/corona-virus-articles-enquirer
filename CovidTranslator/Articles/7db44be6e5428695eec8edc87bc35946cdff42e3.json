            "text": "activity of probiotic strains. Related to this, Boti\u0107 et al. (2007) unveiled the potential activity of probiotic lactobacilli against vesicular stomatitis viruses (VSV). This study shows that antiviral activity is due to the direct interaction between probiotic strains and enveloped virus. Attempts to use probiotics as antiviral agents may be a promising alternative (Chono et al. 2012) . Probiotic lactic acid bacteria (LAB) and bifidobacteria support immune system's function and balance and contribute to immuno-modulatory effects in combating microbial pathogens, including viruses. The herpes infection is recurrent and can be reactivated at any time (Field and Vere-Hodge 2013) . Acyclovir can be potent only in the reactivation stage, and for these reasons the prevention of this type of infection is of major importance in the sector of public health (Caldeira et al. 2013) . Taken together, these data indicate that the need of alternative strategies and probiotics could offer various advantages. The vaginal microflora usually designed as vaginal lactobacilli is the first line of defence against a large variety of microbes (Al Kassaa et al. 2014a, b) . The inhibitory potency of vaginal lactobacilli can be exerted through different mechanisms including the aggregation and production of anti-microbial compounds (Al Kassaa et al. 2014b ). Related to this, lactic acid, hydrogen peroxide and bacteriocins constitute the main anti-pathogen arsenal produced by vaginal lactobacilli (Al Kassaa et al. 2014a) . Conti et al. reported that the anti-HSV-2 activity of L. brevis was originated by a molecule other than lactic acid and H 2 O 2 (Conti et al. 2009 ). Mastromarino et al. (2011) showed that another strain of L. brevis exerted anti-HSV-2 activity by a heat-resistant and non-protein cell surface component. Subsequent to these findings (Mastromarino et al. 2011) , Khani et al. (2012) showed that L. rhamnosus enhanced macrophage viability in elimination of HSV-1, while Zabihoullahi et al. (2012) reported that supernatants from different lactobacilli inhibited HSV replication.",

In addition, the presence of bacteria was measured as previously described (Jacobsen et al. 1999) . Briefly, a cell suspension containing 10 5 cells in 4-ml complete DMEM medium was transferred to each well of a six-well tissue culture plate. When the cells reached 80 % confluency, the medium was removed 24 h prior to the adhesion assay and the cells were supplemented with DMEM, without antibiotics. The monolayer cells were washed twice with 3 ml of PBS. An aliquot of 2 ml of DMEM (without serum and antibiotics) was added to each well and incubated for 30 min at 37 \u00b0C. Bacterial cells, at 10 8 CFU/ml, were resuspended in 1 ml of DMEM medium (without serum and antibiotics) and added to different wells. The plates were incubated for 2 h at 37 \u00b0C in the presence of 5 % CO 2 . The monolayer cells were washed five times with sterile PBS, and the adhesion score was determined by counting the adhered bacteria within 20 random microscopic fields after Giemsa staining (Jacobsen et al. 1999) . Bacteria were grouped into three categories: nonadhesive (\u226440 bacteria), adhesive (41-100 bacteria) and highly adhesive (>100 bacteria). The percentages of adhesion were determined by plating MRS agar plate followed by colony counting after 48 h of incubation. The adhered bacteria were harvested together with the eukaryotic cells by trypsination; the mixture was serially diluted and streaked onto MRS agar plates (Jacobsen et al. 1999 ).",

The DMEM lactobacilli supernatants were mixed and incubated with viruses prior to infection step. Further, L. gasseri CMUL57-, L. acidophilus CMUL67-and L. plantarum CMUL140-derived neutralized supernatants enhanced slightly the viability of Vero cell monolayer inoculated with 100 PFU HSV-2 with about 9.5, 5.4 and 2.4 %, respectively, due to reduction in viral infectious particles. These data are normalized to HSV-2 alone used as a control (Table 2 ). This very weak inhibition prompted us to investigate whether the anti-HSV-2 activity of lactobacilli was exerted through an interaction between bacteria and HSV-2 particles. Thus, L. gasseri CMUL57 at 10 8 CFU/ml or Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium (DMEM, negative control) were incubated for 2 h at 37 \u00b0C in CO 2 atmosphere in the presence of HSV-2 (10 4 PFU/ml) or CVB4E2 (10 3 TCID 50 /ml). Afterwards, supernatant was collected by centrifugation (20,000 g, 3 min, 4 \u00b0C) and assayed on Vero cells. After the treatment, the number of infectious HSV-2 aureus) ATCC33862 at 10 7 CFU/ml. The cell viability was measured using UptiBlue, and the results were expressed as the percentage of viability compared to the negative control (100 % viable Vero cell monolayers). The results were the means (\u00b1SD) of at least three independent experiments particles was significantly reduced (15,000 vs. 100,000 PFU/ml P = 0.01), whereas that of CVB4E2 remained unchanged as compared to the control (9.8 10 2 TCID 50 /ml) (Fig. 5b, c) . To be noted that the pellet was washed three times with DMEM in order to eliminate any free residual viral particles in the mixture. After each washing, the supernatants were assayed on Vero cells monolayers to evaluate the level of free infectious particles. After the final washing step, DNA was extracted from the pellet and the final supernatant to test by qPCR the presence of the viral particles trapped with L. gasseri CMUL57. Thereof, the cycle threshold of the control assay was 26.2 \u00b1 0.8 for 1000 PFU, and that of the pellet was 24.2 \u00b1 0.9 (Fig. 5d ). In contrast, the detection of HSV-2 DNA in the final washing supernatant was almost negative (Fig. 5d) . The bacterial pellet suspected to be containing HSV-2 infectious particles, as well as the washing supernatants were serially diluted (10 \u22121 to 10 \u22125 ) and added to Vero cell monolayers. Afterwards, a PRA method was carried out to examine these samples' infectivity, by incubating them for 5 days at 37 \u00b0C in 5 % CO 2 . After the incubation, no viral infection was observed for the supernatant of the final washing and for the bacterial pellet (Fig. 5e ).",

HSV-2 is one of the most common sexually HSV-2 and CVB4E2 were used to challenge Vero cells and then incubated for 6 h. The unbound virus particles were removed by three washings. Results were recorded after 48 h of incubation and represented by the virus titration and expressed as logTCID 50 /ml, compared to the control cells (medium) which were not treated with lactobacilli. The data (\u00b1SD) are the means of at least three independent experiments transmitted infections, acting further as a potential risk factor for acquiring other sexually transmitted infections (Chopra et al. 2013) . Here, we demonstrate the anti-HSV-2 potential of L. gasseri CMUL57, L. acidophilus CMUL67 and L. plantarum CMUL140 that were recently isolated from human vagina and characterized for their large antagonism and probiotic characteristics (Al Kassaa et al. 2014a ). The highest anti-HSV-2 activity was observed for L. gasseri CMUL57. Recently, Zabihoullahi et al. (2012) showed the anti-HSV-2 activity of another vaginal L. gasseri strain. These two independent studies utilized live and non-live L. gasseri, respectively, and revealed the capabilities of these lactobacilli to inhibit HSV-2. Further, the absence of cytotoxicity of LAB probiotics is a prerequisite before undertaking any antiviral study. L. gasseri CMUL57, L. acidophilus CMUL67 and L. plantarum CMUL140 used in this study are shown to be not cytotoxic for Vero cells. Safety of Bifidobacterium adolescentis SPM 0214 was established on Vero cells , and that of E. faecium on porcine macrophage cell line strain and HSV-2 mixture was determined using the PRA method. e The real-time PCR method was used to detect the presence of \"trapped\" viruses in the mixture pellet and residual viral particles in washing supernatants. CSC crude supernatant of co-incubation, FWS first washing supernatant, SWS second washing supernatant, TWS third washing supernatant. The control wells refer to the wells containing HSV-2 only, whereas the test wells refer to the wells containing HSV-2 co-incubated with CMUL57 strain two main pathways (Al Kassaa et al. 2014b ). The first one is linked to the production of inhibitory metabolites such as lactic acid, bacteriocins and hydrogen peroxide that are endowed with antiviral activity (Conti et al. 2009 ). Here, this possibility is discarded because the assays conducted with the supernatants gathered from L. gasseri CMUL57, L. acidophilus CMUL67 and L. plantarum CMUL140 cultures revealed either slight or absence of anti-HSV-2 activity. However, the anti-HSV-2 activity attributed to molecules of a other than H 2 O 2 and lactic acid bacteria was reported for L. brevis CD2, L. salivarius FV2 and L. plantarum FV9 isolated from human vagina (Conti et al. 2009 ). The impact of lactic acid produced by vaginal lactobacilli was shown to interfere with the negative charges of the viral envelopes, enhancing their sensitivity and provoking ease virus inactivation (Tao et al. 1997) .",

The data obtained here agree with this concept, as we show that L. gasseri CMUL57 strain is active against enveloped virus (HSV-2), but not against naked one (CBV4E2). Interestingly, co-incubation of HSV-2 and L. gasseri CMUL57 experiments as well as the qPCR one let us to think that HSV-2 particles were indeed present in the bacterial pellet, and the absence of their infectivity could result from trapping/binding mechanism. In direct line, Tao et al. (1997) showed the capabilities of lactobacilli to trap human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) by binding the mannose sugar-rich \"dome\" of their attachment glycoprotein gp120. Ivec et al. (2007) reported the trapping and adsorption of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) by Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium species. Lai et al. (2009) indicated that the trapping of HIV by vaginal lactobacilli rendered the diffusion of HIV very slower than in the normal conditions. Recently, Chai et al. (2013) showed the attachment of the enteropathogenic coronavirus to the surface of E. faecium, which might be a means to trap viruses and prevent infection. Wang et al. showed that E. faecium inhibited influenza viruses by mechanisms including a direct physical interaction and strengthening of innate defence at the cellular level . The use of LAB probiotics as antiviral agents was reported as promising approach for aquaculture (Lakshmi et al. 2013 ) and poultry industry (Seo et al. 2012) because viral diseases cause an enormous loss in the production in shrimp farms (Lai et al. 2009 ), and avian influenza virus occurrence is responsible of severe losses to the poultry industry (Seo et al. 2012) .",
