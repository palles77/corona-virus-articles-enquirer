The alcohols were subsequently transformed into the corresponding 2,2-dialkylamantadine derivatives in high yields (Scheme 3). Remarkably, while the reaction of ester 8 with methyllithium, ethyllithium, and propylmagnesium chloride led to the expected tertiary noradamantyl alcohols in good yields, addition of an excess of isopropylmagnesium bromide to 8 led to a secondary alcohol, 10. Similarly, the reaction of 8 with pentamethylenebis(magnesium bromide) did not furnish 13, but 1-(3-noradamantyl)-5-hexen-1-ol, 9, in 93% yield. The reductive behavior of organometallic reagents on steric encumbered ketones is well documented, and these alcohols may arise from the reduction by a magnesium species of the initially obtained alkyl noradamantyl ketones. 20 We finally succeeded in the synthesis of the cyclohexanol 13 using the known iodide 12 as the starting material. 21 The reaction of 12 with t-butyllithium followed by addition of cyclohexanone led to the expected alcohol in 56% yield. Alcohol 13 smoothly underwent the Ritter reaction to the chloroacetamide 14, which was cleaved with thiourea to amine 15 (Scheme 3). Of note, from 10, we directly obtained the rearranged amine 11 using an excess of urea in trifluoroacetic acid at 115\u00b0C in 43% yield. This one-step procedure for the synthesis of the amine from the alcohol seems to be general, as the application of this procedure to the alcohol 6c led to the corresponding amine 7c in 31% yield. However, the yield for the one-step procedure was much lower than the overall yield obtained using the cloroacetonitrile method.",

Thus, from 7a, reductive alkylation with formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, or benzaldehyde and NaCNBH 3 led to amines 19a, 20, and 21, respectively, in high yield. Several attempts to synthesize the N,N-diethylderivative of 7a, either from 7a or from 20, met with failure, probably as a consequence of the steric hindrance. Alkylation of 7a with 1,5-dibromopentane led to piperidine derivative 22 in low yield. Reductive methylation of secondary amine 21 with formaldehyde and NaCNBH 3 led, in 80% yield, to the tertiary amine 23, which on catalytic hydrogenation quantitatively furnished secondary amine 24. Similarly, N,Ndimethylderivatives of amines 7b, 7c, 11, and 18 were also synthesized, in high yields, by reductive alkylation with formaldehyde and NaCNBH 3 .

First, with the single exception of the dipropyl derivative 7c, all of the primary amines were more potent than amantadine and rimantadine against the A/PR/8/34 strain of influenza A/ H1N1. Although the more potent compound was the spiroderivative 15 (EC 50 = 1.1 \u03bcM), the highest selectivity (i.e., ratio of cytotoxic to antiviral concentration) was noted with compound 7b (EC 50 = 2.0 \u03bcM; ratio of CC 50 to EC 50 > 50). Second, while the introduction of one or two methyl groups into the primary amine was beneficial (i.e., 7c vs 19c) or practically neutral with regard to antiviral activity (i.e., 7b vs 19b or 26, 18 vs 25, and 11 vs 19d), the introduction of larger groups was clearly deleterious for the activity, leading largely to inactive, cytotoxic compounds.",
