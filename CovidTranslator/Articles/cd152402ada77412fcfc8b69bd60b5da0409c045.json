ISG was formulated at a protein concentration of 165 mg/mL that contained 0.3 Molar glycine, 0.9% (weight/volume) sodium chloride and 0.1 g/L merthiolate. ISG solutions were adjusted to pH 6.8 AE 0.4 and stored at 5 C. With time, ISG solutions tended to form particles (aggregates) during storage.

The first IVIG was produced by pepsin digestion and contained a principal fragment with two antigen binding sites linked by disulfide bonds. 7 The desire to reduce anticomplement activity and produce IVIGs with ''intact'' IgG as the principal component led some manufacturers to limit pepsin treatments, 4 to use the more specific enzyme plasmin, 8 and to chemically modify the product. Chemically modified IVIGs were produced that were structurally intact, were low in anticomplement activity, and contained no IgG fragments. [9] [10] [11] Treatments of immunoglobulins with enzymes and chemical modification to suppress spontaneous complement activation had several unintended consequences. The treatments also reduced important antibody biological activities required for clinical efficacy. For example complement activation by antigen-antibody complexes plays an important role in the killing of encapsulated bacteria by leukocytes. 12 Antibodies that are chemically and physically altered are rapidly removed from the circulatory system by the reticuloendothelial system. Thus some antibodies in enzyme-digested and chemically modified IVIGs were shown to have reduced bacterial opsonizing activities [12] [13] [14] [15] and shortened circulating half-lives.

Although IgG produced by cold ethanol fractionation is relatively pure, it contains trace amounts of highly active contaminants that have the potential to cause most of the adverse events previously attributed to aggregates. These contaminants include prekallikrein activator (which initiates production of the potent vasodilator bradykinin), prekallikrein, activated coagulation factors, complement proteins, and immunoglobulins A and M. 6 Other contaminants such as plasmin and plasminogen can degrade IgG to form split products and to reduce some antibody activities during ISG storage. 19 The desire to produce IVIG that contain native IgG with antibodies that are fully active led to development of IVIG using purification with anion exchange (DEAE) chromatography. The first purified IVIG contained none of the trace contaminants associated with adverse events. Some antibody biological activities such as bacterial opsonization and virus neutralization were higher than in treated products. 6 Now virtually all commercial IVIGs are produced with an anion exchange chromatography step and contain relatively low levels of trace contaminants.",

Pooled human plasma presented a higher risk of hepatitis transmission than whole blood because of the increased probability that pooled plasma would be contaminated by one or more donors. Human albumin solutions were also responsible for hepatitis transmission. 22 Heat can be used to inactivate viruses and proteins. The destruction temperature of a protein is sharply defined and is different for each protein. 23 In the presence of substrate, enzymes can be heated to temperatures 10 degrees higher than in the absence of substrate. 23 In 1948, Gellis and coworkers 22 reported that hepatitis transmission by albumin was eliminated by heating it for 10 hours at 60 C. Virus inactivation of albumin by heat treatment was possible because of the discovery that addition of stabilizers increased the heat resistance of albumin. Human albumin has many binding sites for hydrophobic molecules and plays a major role in the transport of fatty acids. Filling these sites with the stabilizers acetyltryptophan and caprylic acid allows albumin to withstand heating for 10 hours at 60 C. Since albumin has no measurable biological activity, the full impact of heating albumin is not known.",

High risk plasma products included fibrinogen, Factor VIII concentrate, and Factor IX. 24 Heated albumin solutions and immunoglobulins produced by cold ethanol fractionation were considered to be low-risk products. 24 Factor VIII is rapidly inactivated when heated in solution. However, dried Factor VIII is relatively heat stable under certain conditions. This observation led to development of heat-treated Factor VIII preparations in the 1980s. 25, 26 Fortunately, HIV was also inactivated in heated Factor VIII but the products had lower biological activities, were relatively insoluble, and produced a higher incidence of Factor VIII inhibitors. Unfortunately, non-A, non-B hepatitis was not inactivated. 25 The perception that immunoglobulins produced by cold ethanol fractionation had a low risk of transmitting virus infections changed in 1983 when Lane reported that an experimental IVIG produced by cold ethanol fractionation transmitted non-A, non-B hepatitis. 27 During this same period, HIV was isolated and shown to be transmitted by blood and blood products. 28, 29 The emergence of HIV and reports of non-A, non-B hepatitis transmission by some IVIG products 30,31 caused manufacturers and regulatory agencies to examine existing IVIG manufacturing procedures for their capacity to eliminate viruses. 32-41 Development of dedicated virus inactivation procedures for IVIG production was also initiated. 42, 43 ",

Thus development of donor screening tests involved not only tests for new pathogens but also tests of ever increasing sensitivity to eliminate window period infections.",

Relevant pathogens are considered to be human pathogens that cause chronic, progressive wasting, or lethal diseases; and some infectious agents that are not prevalent in the transfused population. By these criteria, hepatitis B virus (HBV), HCV, and human immunodeficiency viruses types 1 and 2 (HIV-1 and HIV-2) were characterized as relevant. Parvovirus B19, cytomegalovirus, and hepatitis A viruses (HAV) were classified as occasionally relevant. Since this review was published, nonenveloped viruses such as Parvovirus B19 and HAV have become more relevant and the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Corona virus (SARS-CoV) and West Nile virus (WNV) have emerged. Thus relevance of pathogens to transfusion is an evolving concept.",

A sensitive test for HBV was developed in 1972 50 and was used to eliminate infected donors. Unfortunately, the HBV test did not eliminate transfusion-related hepatitis and the search for one or more non-A, non-B hepatitis viruses was initiated. The AIDS epidemic led to rapid development of a screening test for antibodies to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) in 1984. 51 In 1989 the genome of a non-A, non-B hepatitis virus was isolated and used to develop a donor screening test for HCV. 52 Today, plasma is screened for antibodies to syphilis, HIV-1, HIV-2, and HCV, and for HBV and HIV antigens. Extremely sensitive tests for HCV, HIV-1, HBV, and parvovirus B19 nucleic acids have recently been introduced and are now being used to further eliminate window period donations.",

Serious infections are defined as bacteremia/sepsis, bacterial meningitis, osteomyelitis/septic arthritis, bacterial pneumonia, and visceral abscess. Diagnostic criteria are listed. Statistical analysis should demonstrate that the upper 99% one-sided confidence interval for the frequency of acute serious bacterial infections is less than one per subject per year. 55 Infusional adverse events are now defined as those that occur up to 72 hours following an infusion of test product, regardless of other factors that may impact a possible causal association with product administration. The target for this safety endpoint is an upper 95% one-sided confidence limit of less than 0.40. 55 Pharmacokinetic (PK) data are to be obtained from at least 20 patients. The analysis should include total IgG and several specific antibodies to derive a plasma concentration-time curve, half-life, area under the curve (AUC 0-t ; AUC 0-infinity ), volume of distribution, maximum concentration (Cmax), time from start of infusion to Cmax (Tmax), and elimination rate constants. Serum samples for these antibody measurements should be taken after a washout period of 3 to 5 estimated half-lives (3-5 infusions) investigational IGIV. The FDA also desires that trough IgG and IgG subclass levels be measured monthly. 55 The results of these policies are illustrated in Table 3 . The time period for recording infusional or temporally associated adverse events has been extended from 30 minutes to 72 hours postinfusion. Each study has reported the incidence of acute serious bacterial infections and other bacterial infections. Although not shown in Table 3 , pharmacokinetic studies were also performed for each product. The number of PK subjects ranged from 14 62 to 57 57 . Table 1 , most IVIG products are still produced by cold ethanol fractionation but are now further purified with anion exchange chromatography (DEAE anion exchangers or an equivalent). Plasma fractionation by cold ethanol fractionation involves precipitating proteins by adjusting pH, salt concentration, temperature, and ethanol concentration. Precipitated proteins are removed from proteins still in solution Intravenous Immunoglobulins by filtration or centrifugation. The most abundant plasma proteins, IgG and albumin, have vastly different physicochemical properties and are readily separated. However, some IgG and albumin is distributed to other fractions at each precipitation step.",
