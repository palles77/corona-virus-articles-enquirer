For this study, which was conducted 7 months after the anthrax attacks, structured diagnostic interviews were conducted with 137 Capitol Hill staff workers, including 56 who had been directly exposed to areas independently determined to have been contaminated. Postdisaster psychopathology was associated with exposure; of those with positive nasal swab tests, PTSD was diagnosed in 27% and any postanthrax psychiatric disorder in 55%. Fewer than half of those who were prescribed antibiotics completed the entire course, and only one-fourth had flawless antibiotic adherence. Thirty percent of those not exposed believed they had been exposed; 18% of all study participants had symptoms they suspected were symptoms of anthrax infection, and most of them sought medical care. Extrapolation of raw numbers to large future disasters from proportions with incorrect belief in exposure in this limited study indicates a potential for important public health consequences, to the degree that people alter their healthcare behavior based on incorrect exposure beliefs. Incorrect belief in exposure was associated with being very upset, losing trust in health authorities, having concerns about mortality, taking antibiotics, and being male. Those who incorrectly believe they were exposed may warrant concern and potential interventions as well as those exposed.",

Five deaths among 11 confirmed cases of inhalational anthrax plus 11 cutaneous anthrax cases resulted. 1 This constituted the first U.S. incident of bioterrorism involving anthrax. Authorities responding to the attacks did not have the benefit of prior experience with bioterrorist attacks with anthrax to guide them in determining the scope of the incident, establishing public safety measures, and conducting mass antibiotic prophylaxis. [2] [3] [4] Officials responding to the attacks were criticized for their management of the anthrax exposures, for not responding soon enough, and for risk communication errors such as offering early reassurances of safety that later proved incorrect. [5] [6] [7] The anthrax letter delivered to Capitol Hill was opened the morning of October 15, 2001 , by an office worker in Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle's sixth-floor office in the Hart Senate Office Building. In short order, the office was closed; its staffers were quarantined, tested for anthrax exposure, and treated prophylactically with antibiotics. The House of Representatives, whose offices were not a target of any of the anthrax letters, quickly initiated a historically unprecedented and controversial 3-day shutdown to inspect for anthrax. 8 The Senate, however, remained open for 2 more days until October 17, when its offices were closed for environmental testing. The Hart Building was closed for months after discovery of anthrax contamination there. Many congressional staff from Hart Senate offices initially worked from home until relocating to other temporary spaces, often doubling up in other offices on Capitol Hill (sometimes with their political rivals).",

In contrast to the immediate and unmistakable physical impact of other types of disasters, bioterrorism's effects may be invisible, delayed, and uncertain, 10 earning this type of disaster the label ''stealth terrorism.'' 11 Ambiguities surrounding personal exposure may instill pervasive fear. Behavioral responses to bioterrorism may, therefore, arise from belief in exposure independent of actual exposure and may thus be unpredictable and disproportionate to the actual degree of physical exposure. [12] [13] [14] The novelty of the agent used, the public's lack of familiarity with it, and health authorities' inexperience with it are factors that may incite fear. 10, 15 Bioterrorists seek not just to injure selected individuals, but to create widespread panic, generate chaos, and disrupt the broader society. 16, 17 The concept of ''belief in exposure'' has been examined in combat veterans potentially exposed to chemical and biological weapons. In these studies, belief in exposure correlates with mental illness and psychological stress. 18, 19 Similarly, studies of infectious epidemics and toxic contamination accidents, for which the boundaries of exposure may also be uncertain, [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] suggest that emotional and behavioral responses of populations exposed to epidemics and toxic contamination accidents may relate even more to concerns about possible exposure than to actual exposure. 21, 25, 26 Individuals' beliefs about their exposures may predict health and mental health status apart from actual exposure status. 19 Uncertainty about exposure and associated risk communication issues were evident in the 2001 anthrax attacks. Reports of increasingly sophisticated vehicles for anthrax dissemination in later anthrax-containing letters necessitated redetermination of safety response strategies. Revised messages to potentially exposed groups conflicted with earlier communications and other sources of information, generating confusion and apparent misinformation. 2, 8, 27, 28 Further, the communications were not always clearly understood: many did not realize that the nasal swab testing procedure was not a clinical test of anthrax infection for individual use, but rather an epidemiologic tool for determining zones and perimeters of exposure, 7 a situation that created unintended worry and concern.",

Although no congressional personnel developed an infection with anthrax, many had clear evidence of exposure (28 with anthrax-positive nasal swabs), and many more were considered at significant risk (occupants of 11 Capitol Hill offices where anthrax spores were discovered; prolonged antibiotic prophylaxis to 625 and briefer prophylaxis to >2,000). 3,32 Potential exposures, therefore, clearly go beyond those who succumbed to anthrax infection, or even those positive for anthrax spores on nasal swab testing, to encompass a far wider exposure perimeter. No studies of groups exposed to these anthrax attacks have assessed psychiatric disorders such as posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).",

Belief in exposure was defined as the participant's stated belief, in response to interview query, of having had direct personal contact with anthrax-contaminated material or air. Therefore, belief in exposure might not necessarily always coincide with actual physical exposure to areas later found positive for the presence of anthrax spores. Some individuals who did spend time in contaminated areas may have maintained the belief that they were not really exposed, while others who did not enter these areas may have harbored a belief that they were exposed in spite of not having had direct contact with contaminated areas. Comparison of these 2 variables allowed stratification of the sample by exposure status and belief in exposure: of 56 exposed, 52 (92.9%) believed they had been exposed, and of 81 not exposed, 24 (29.6%) believed they had been exposed.",

Complementary findings from systematic observations on survivors of anthrax infection in previous research 1 together with the current study of a broader exposure group constitute a new empirically based literature on mental health effects of bioterrorism. This work may inform responses to future incidents including not only bioterrorist attacks but also chemical or radiological accidents, emerging infectious diseases, and pandemics such as the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak and the more recent 2009 H1N1 epidemic. 38 All of these events are associated with fear and uncertainty about exposure and=or contagion and BEHAVIORAL RESPONSE TO BIOTERRORISM ON CAPITOL HILL raise public health concerns. In mass emergencies involving large populations with uncertain exposures, small fractions of the populace becoming convinced they were exposed and rushing to seek medical care could translate into massive numbers of patients overwhelming the surge capacity of acute care systems. 10, 39 Extrapolating the proportions of people in this limited study who incorrectly believed they had been personally exposed in order to anticipate in future disasters the raw numbers of people who believe they have been exposed indicates a potentially important public health consequence, if people alter their healthcare behavior based on misunderstanding. In this Capitol Hill anthrax attack study, a sizeable proportion of those unexposed, especially men, believed they had been exposed. To our knowledge the finding that, among those who were not exposed, men were more likely than women to believe that they had been exposed has not been previously reported. This result is not consistent with previous studies that demonstrate greater perception of threat and threat-related anxiety among female exposure groups compared to males, 40, 41 with the wellknown preponderance of PTSD among female traumaexposure groups, 42 or with general symptom-reporting patterns among women compared to men. 43 The false belief in exposure among men in this sample could well represent a false-positive artifact of this particular dataset, or it could reflect unique psychological characteristics of the men and women who work for Congress.",

To the degree that belief in exposure generates emotional distress and seeking of unnecessary treatment, targeted risk communication to help align exposure beliefs with actual exposure status could reduce levels of emotional distress and unnecessary healthcare use. If, however, belief in exposure is generated by individuals' interpretation of healthcare measures (''I was prescribed antibiotics-that must mean NORTH ET AL. I was exposed''), then risk communication can be targeted to better inform people of the significance of medical treatments in order to reduce erroneous conclusions about personal exposure.

The invisible nature of the bioterrorism attack, however, as discussed earlier in this article, may have yielded less apparent psychological effects compared to the more evident response to the example of a terrorist attack using conventional weapons in the Oklahoma City bombing. Further contributors to psychological reactions to the anthrax attacks among Congressional staff may relate to the high-profile and national nature of the anthrax attacks as well as the fact that the anthrax attacks followed soon after the September 11 terrorist attacks (in which Capitol Hill was a target), almost blending the attacks in the perception of the public and of those directly exposed.
