Despite the considerable medical resources and personnel that have been dispensed to combat COVID-19 in Hubei province, hospital capacity continues to be overburdened. There continues to be a shortage of hospital beds needed to accommodate the rising number of COVID-19 patients. In response to this growing crisis, Wuhan plans to transform hotels, venues, training centers and college dorms into quarantine and treatment centers for COVID-19 patients. Further, 13 mobile cabin hospitals will be built to provide over 10,000 beds. [2] Therefore, a careful and precise understanding of the potential number of cases in Wuhan is crucial for the prevention and control of the COVID-19 outbreak. Wu et al. (2020) provided an estimate of the total number of cases of COVID-19 in Wuhan, using the number of cases exported from Wuhan to cities outside mainland China. [3] However, since the number of cases exported from Wuhan to cities outside mainland China is small, their estimate of the size of the epidemic in Wuhan may not be precise and has large variability.

In this article, we propose a new statistical method to estimate daily number of cases in Wuhan under a similar dynamic equation model as the one in [3] . Unlike the one in [3] , our method can also handle the missing information on whether a case is exported from Wuhan.",

This would imply, on average, the daily probability of traveling from Wuhan to places outside Hubei province would be 5*0.34/14/14=0.009. Li et al. estimated that the mean incubation period of 425 patients with COVID-19 was 5.2 days (95% CI, 4.1 -7.0). [10] The mean time from symptom onset to detection calculated from our data is 5.54 days, so we choose 1 = 2 = 5 days. January 29, 2020, has the maximum count of imported cases. Since has a binomial( \u2212 \u2212 , ) distribution with constant , \u2212 \u2212 also reaches its maximum at = January 29, 2020. From the logistic function(2), is the midpoint of and \u2212 , that is \u2212 2 = January 24, 2020, which is shortly after the lockdown of Wuhan city.[5] Wu et al. estimated the epidemic doubling time as 6.4 days (95% CI: 5.8 -7.1) as of January 25, 2020. [3] From this result, we estimate that 2 = Using these values for parameters , , , and , we can derive the maximum likelihood estimate \u0302= 59218, with 95% confidence interval [57567, 60906].",
