            "text": "Background: The pandemic novel influenza H1N1 (swine) influenza A virus (H1N1v) infection has caused large-scale community infection in Taiwan. Anxiety developed in the general public and physicians faced a huge challenge in many aspects. We conducted this prospective study to develop a scoring system based on the clinical manifestations for predicting the results of influenza rapid testing, as a surrogate of influenza rapid testing, to lower the anxiety and decrease the burden for the test. Methods: From , pediatric patients who received influenza rapid tests were enrolled, and questionnaires were recorded and analyzed in the first 2 weeks. A further scoring system was conducted to predict the results of influenza rapid tests and validated in the next 3 weeks. Results: Eight hundred and forty-five children were enrolled in our study. In the first phase, data from 506 patients showed that those with age 5 years, fever 38 C, contact history of influenza A infection, myalgia, lethargy, sore throat, cough, and headache had a higher risk of positive results (odds ratio: 1.1e2.53). A scoring system was designed, with 5 points indicating acceptable sensitivity (69.5%) and specificity (63.6%). Three hundred and thirty-nine Journal of Microbiology, Immunology and Infection (2012) 45, 271e275 patients in the second phase were enrolled to validate the scoring system and the positive and negative predictive values were 52.0% and 73.8%. Conclusion: The emergence of H1N1v infection is not only an important medical issue, but also a socioeconomic problem. Based on easily available clinical information, we develop a scoring system as a preliminary screening tool for the general public and first-line health care providers to evaluate the possibility of influenza virus infection. Although this study was limited by the sensitivity of rapid tests, this type of model may be a surrogate weapon when faced with overwhelming pandemic infection in the future, especially in areas with scarce medical resources.",

On June 11, 2009 , the World Health Organization (WHO) raised the pandemic alert level to phase 6, indicating widespread community transmission. 1 In Taiwan, the first patient with H1N1v infection was identified on May 20, 2009, and large-scale community infection followed. 2 The epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of H1N1v infection differ between countries. Compared with western countries, it was found that the first 61 patients with H1N1v in Taiwan had a lower incidence of fever, diarrhea and vomiting. 3 It is believed that the presentation of influenza infection is relatively atypical in children and this makes it more difficult to make an accurate diagnosis. 4 At the end of September 2009, 18 patients died from H1N1v infection in Taiwan. 2 The influenza infection was over-hyped and anxiety developed in the general public. 5 Anxious people poured into emergency departments requesting an influenza examination and their doctors' assurance, whether or not they had influenza-like illness (ILI). The number of visits doubled compared to the same period in the previous year, and overcrowding with patients, including healthy people in fear of getting influenza, almost paralyzed the medical system. Oseltamivir was offered free to patients with a positive influenza rapid test (IRT), to reduce mortality and complications of H1N1v infection, by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Taiwan, but the measures accelerated the exhaustion of the IRT kits. 2 We conducted this prospective study by designing a scoring system to predict the results of IRT and evaluate the clinical presentation of H1N1v infection. We hope that this scoring system can be a surrogate for IRT to decrease the burden for testing and lower public anxiety.",

Patients younger than 5 years had a lower risk of positive rapid test results.

Among the patients with positive rapid test results, 88.8% of patients had fever, two thirds had sore throat, about half had headache, and a third had myalgia, lethargy or cough. These results are compatible with previous observations. 6, 7 The proportion of gastrointestinal tract symptoms in our series was lower than previously reported. Our patients with positive or negative test results had no significant difference in vomiting or diarrhea. The gene sequence identified in Taiwan is the same as those in other countries, although the reported clinical manifestations are a little different. More studies are needed to evaluate the impact of viral infection in different races. Age is another significant predictive factor and we found that patients aged 10 years had a higher risk of a positive IRT result (odds ratio: 2.53, 95% confidence interval: 1.75e3.67). Influenza is easily spread in school and cluster infection may occur. In addition, adolescents are more able to describe their influenza-like symptoms, and they do not seek medical consultation if they only have mild discomfort.",

We use the commercial Quickvue A\u00feB influenza tests whose sensitivity is only 51.0%, but the specificity of this kit is good for both H1N1v and seasonal influenza virus (99.0%). 10 We designed a simple scoring system to predict the results of IRT, but the unsatisfactory sensitivity of the antigen rapid test may limit its clinical application. Besides the different brand of commercial kit, the sensitivity of the rapid test is also influenced by several factors, such as clinical judgment, the method of sampling, viral load and background prevalence of influenza. 11 According to the data of CDC, Taiwan, during our study period, about 30% of patients with ILI had influenza infection, including children and adults, and >90% of them had H1N1v. 2 The sensitivity and specificity of our scoring system may change over time and between areas, and may be different in children and adults.

Patients infected by H1N1v may be afebrile, therefore, even some well people asked for influenza evaluation.
