            "text": "The biological response modifier 7-thia-8-oxoguanosine was evaluated in mice against the hepatotropic Adames strain of Punta Toro virus. When administered intraperitoneally in divided doses, significant protection from death was conferred at doses of 50 and 100 mg/kg/day given 24 and 17 h pre-virus inoculation, 25-100 mg/kg/day administered 4 h pre-and 3 h post-virus challenge, and 12.5 to 100 mg/ kg/day administered 24 and 31 h after virus inoculation. These doses preventing death reduced liver icterus scores, serum alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase levels, and liver and serum virus titers relative to placebo controis. Full daily doses administered at 24 h were somewhat less protective to mice than divided daily doses starting at the same time. The initiation of treatment could be delayed as late as 36 h after virus inoculation, resulting in complete protection from mortality at 100 mg/kg/day. This prevention of death occurred despite the acute nature of the infection which resulted in deaths by 96 h in the placebo-treated controls. These results show that 7-thia-8-oxoguanosine has both prophylactic and therapeutic potential as an anti-Phlebovirus agent. Interferon induction appears to be the reason for antiviral activity in this model, since up to 10000 units of interferon/ml were induced in mice 1 h after treatment with 100 mg 7-thia-8-oxoguanosine per kg, and antibody to interferon s/I] administered shortly after treatment with the nucleoside negated the antiviral effect.",

They are important pathogens in the Mediterranean area, parts of Africa, and South America (Sabin, 1948; Travassos da Rosa et al., 1983) . Representatives of this group, Rift Valley fever virus and Sandfly fever virus, can be considered important targets of studies to devise treatments for the debilitating diseases they cause. A major epidemic of Rift Valley fever in 1985 was responsible for thousands of cases of infection and over 500 deaths in Egypt (Meegan et al., 1981) . Since this particular strain of virus can be quite dangerous to man, we have developed the closely related Punta Toro virus (PTV) model as a less virulent virus for evaluating anti-Phlebovirus agents. The antiviral agents ribavirin (Sidwell et al., 1988b) and ribamidine (Sidwell et al., 1988a) were effective in treating the hepatotropic form of this disease in mice.",

These agents do not usually show antiviral activity in cell culture because nonimmune cells are predominantly used for viral assays. The nucleoside analog 7thia-8-oxoguanosine is a novel biological response modifier of this type that is known to induce interferon (Smee et al., 1990c) . It was reported to inhibit a broad spectrum of RNA and DNA viruses in animal infection models (Smee et al., 1989; Smee et al., 1990b) . One of these, San Angelo virus, is in the same family as PTV but belongs to the California group of bunyaviruses (Sather and Hammon, 1967) instead of the Phlebovirus group. 7-Thia-8-oxoguanosine was effective in preventing death by San Angelo virus in mice when administered prior to or within 24 h after virus challenge (Smee et al., 1989; Smee et al., 1990b) . In the present report 7-thia-8-oxoguanosine is shown to be effective in the treatment of hepatotropic PTV infections in mice. Interferon induction and action appear to be responsible for the biological activity of the compound.",

Five sham-infected animals were treated with each drug dosage as toxicity controls, while uninfected untreated mice served as normal controls. The toxicity and normal control mice were maintained in an area remote from the infected mice. These were weighed prior to initial treatment and again 18 h after the last treatment. Four days after virus inocu-lation, 10 infected animals from each treatment group and 20 placebo-treated control mice were killed, bled, and their livers removed.

The following mortality results (survivors/total) were achieved by single daily treatments administered 24 h after virus challenge: 100 mg/kg (6/10), 50 mg/kg (10/10), 25 mg/kg (9/10), 12.5 mg/kg (3/10) and placebo (5/20).

The level of IFN induced in C57BL/6 mice and its persistence were similar to IFN induction in Swiss Webster mice (Smee et al., 1990c) . Antibodies to IFN ~x/~ negated the protective effect of 7-thia-8-oxoguanosine. In work performed with Semliki Forest virus, Smee et al. (1990c) established that the in vivo antiviral activity of the nucleoside could also be eliminated by treatment of mice with anti-interferon antibodies. In the same report natural killer cell induction by the nucleoside did not appear to be a significant protective factor. It is important to note that the IFN inducer bropirimine (Wierenga, 1985) is also active against Punta Toro virus infections in vivo (Sidwell et al., manuscript submitted) , and Pifat and Smith (1987) have shown the murine PTV infection to be highly sensitive to IFN. Although no studies were conducted using several days of treatment, previous work with 7-thia-8-oxoguanosine against other virus infections showed that daily treatments do not increase compound efficacy (Smee et al., 1989) . This most likely relates to the fact that hyporesponsiveness occurs with IFN inducers following repeated daily administration (Giese and Kirchner, 1988; Stringfellow, 1977; Stringfellow et al., 1979) . In addition, certain virus infections themselves have been shown to create a state of hyporesponsiveness to IFN inducers in the host . Some of these effects can be overcome by treatment of the animals with prostaglandins (Stringfellow, 1980) . Since 7-thia-8-oxoguanosine was active 24-36 h after virus challenge, PTV may not induce the hyporesponsiveness state in mice as do some other viruses. This point will require further investigation.",

Thus, some comparisons of antiviral activity in the two virus models is warranted. The activity of the nucleoside against San Angelo virus was observed at doses as low as 5 mg/kg/day (given at -24 and -18 h). Under similar conditions, it was effective at 50 mg/kg against PTV. Efficacy against PTV was achieved at 12.5 mg/kg by starting treatments at +24 h, however. In another study it was shown that 7-thia-8-oxoguanosine had only moderate antiviral activity against San Angelo virus at 200 mg/kg (the only dose evaluated) when administered as late as 24 h after virus inoculation. The differences in these results may reflect the models themselves and where the viruses replicate. San Angelo virus replicates to high titers in mice, leading to encephalitis and death (Smee et al., 1989) , whereas the Adames strain of PTV is primarily hepatotropic (Sidwell et al., 1988b) . Infections caused by encephalitis viruses apparently are difficult to treat once virus has entered the brain (at an early time point after virus inoculation), as was determined by Stringfellow and colleagues (1974a,b) using two different IFN inducers against encephalomyocarditis (EMC) virus in mice. The effects of IFN and associated immunomodulation apparently do not affect the brain to the degree necessary to shut down virus replication there. In related work performed with EMC virus, the ability of 7-thia-8-oxoguanosine to delay death was correlated with suppression of virus replication in visceral organs and tissues, contributing to delays in virus replication in the brain (Smee et al., 1990a) .",
