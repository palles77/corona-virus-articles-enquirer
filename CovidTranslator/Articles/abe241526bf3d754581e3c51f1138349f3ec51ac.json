Communicable respiratory illness is an important cause of morbidity among health care workers each year. In Ontario, this problem gained international recognition with the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in Toronto in 2003. In Toronto, SARS resulted in the deaths of 3 health care workers and ongoing morbidity in many others. In a review of the scientific literature on the efficacy of personal protective equipment to prevent the transmission of SARS, it was determined that failure to implement appropriate barrier precautions was one of the key reasons for occupational transmission of communicable respiratory disease. 1 Facial protection (respirators, surgical masks, and eye/face protection) was identified as the personal protective equipment that was least complied with by health care workers, yet it is an important barrier precaution against respiratory illness. [2] [3] [4] Understanding why health care workers fail to appropriately use facial protection has not been well researched.",

            "text": "The Predisposing, Reinforcing, and Enabling Factors in Educational Diagnosis and Evaluation (PRECEDE) model provides a framework to examine the factors that influence health behavior. 5 This model has been adapted for application to self-protective behavior at work. 6 Predisposing factors are individual characteristics such as beliefs, attitudes, and values. Enabling factors are environmental factors such as knowledge and availability of equipment and resources. Reinforcing factors are organizational factors such as communication, policies and procedures, and management commitment to health and safety. 1 The PRECEDE model was used to frame recent literature reviews to identify knowledge gaps and research priorities for effective prevention against occupationally acquired communicable respiratory diseases. 1 These reviews categorized factors as organizational, environmental, and individual. Results showed that an abundance of studies have examined factors related to compliance with universal precautions among health care workers, 7-10 and the majority have found that environmental and organizational factors played a more important role in compliance than individual factors. Results also showed that there has been very little work done regarding factors that influence compliance of health care workers with precautions taken to protect against communicable respiratory illness. The authors suggest that determinants of adherence to universal precautions are likely applicable to many types of selfprotective behavior, including those taken to prevent transmission of communicable respiratory illness. 1 The objectives of this study were to describe the individual, environmental, and organizational factors that affect nurses' compliance with the use of facial protection and to determine the relative importance of these factors. Once the most influential factors are identified, strategies and interventions to enhance compliance can be formulated, tested, and implemented to reduce the prevalence of worker morbidity and mortality from communicable respiratory illness.",

Estimating a 35% to 40% response rate, 400 questionnaires were distributed over a 6-week period during the summer of 2006.

It is suggested that a score $0.70 is an acceptable reliability coefficient. 18 Cronbach a raw scores were calculated for each measure, and 3 scales (knowledge, effectiveness of preventive actions, and perception of risk) had scores less than 0.70. The scale to measure knowledge demonstrated a reliability coefficient of 0.32. Although this low score might be considered problematic for scales measuring a single trait or content domain, a high a statistic cannot be expected for a multidimensional knowledge scale such as the one used. The scale to measure perception of risk demonstrated a reliability coefficient of 0.64. When the item measuring risk was separated from those measuring impact, the raw score increased to 0.79, suggesting that risk and impact, need to be measured separately. The scale to measure perception of effectiveness of preventive actions demonstrated a reliability coefficient of 0.50. This could be due to the discrepancy between nurses' perception of effectiveness of respirators and hand hygiene as opposed to surgical masks and eye protection. Equipment may need to be evaluated on an individual basis. Univariate analysis Table 2 presents the results of the univariate analysis of associations between explanatory variables and compliance. One demographic variable was found to be significantly associated with compliance: nurses with more tenure reported better compliance with recommended use of facial protection. No individual factors demonstrated a significant association.

In a study of correctional workers, it was found that young workers were more likely to be compliant with universal precautions than older workers. 8 On the other hand, another study showed that longer job tenure was related to health care worker compliance with universal precautions and suggests that health care workers with more time on the job have had the opportunity to incorporate experience and judgment into their clinical practice, which could promote the use of appropriate preventive behaviors. 4 This finding is important because managers could enhance compliance by placing nurses with greater tenure into supervisory and mentoring roles.",

One hospital study in the United States found availability of protective equipment to be associated with compliance with universal precautions. 15 In a study on SARS transmission in health care workers in Hong Kong, it was found that workers who perceived the amount of available personal protective equipment to be poor were more likely to have developed SARS. 23 It is possible that, in our study, availability of facial protection was not found to be significant at the multivariate level because of a correlation with the frequency of use of facial protection.

This finding was significant at the univariate and multivariate levels of analysis. Measures for organizational support included management making health and safety a high priority, taking all reasonable steps to minimize hazards, encouraging employees' involvement in health and safety matters, and actively working to protect employees. This finding shows how important it is that nurses think their health and safety are valued by their employer. Those who think that they are valued will engage in healthier work behaviors. Interventions targeted at improving how supportive the organization is of employee health and safety can result in enhanced compliance. This finding is supported in the literature related to universal precautions. 4, 25 An absence of job hindrances was shown to be linked to enhanced compliance at the univariate level. Proper use of facial protection can be hindered by the type of duty carried out (eg, carrying out a long procedure while using a tight-fitting respirator), a lack of time to properly use and dispose of the equipment (eg, busy unit or emergency situation), and the desire to provide good quality patient care (eg, having the patient unable to see your facial expression while explaining a risky procedure). One study found that a worker's perception that the use of universal precautions interfered with their work (job hindrance) was a strong predictor of failure to comply with universal precautions. 16 Reducing or eliminating these or other identified job hindrances is a good strategy to enhance compliance. The literature has also shown that a lack of available time and a heavy workload negatively influenced compliance with hand hygiene precautions. [26] [27] [28] [29] ",

The cross-sectional study design precludes the determination of causality. Study results may not be generalized to all professions, geographic location, or type of health care facility because these findings are from a convenience sample from 2 acute care, urban hospitals with a 44% response rate. Self-selection bias may be a limitation because participation in the study was voluntary and a decision to participate may be correlated with traits that affect the study, making the participants a nonrepresentative sample. For example, people who have strong opinions or substantial knowledge may be more willing to spend time answering the survey than those who do not. Subject recall and social desirability bias may be a problem given the reliance on self-report data for this study. Self-reported compliance has been found to be higher than actual compliance, [30] [31] [32] and it is possible that our data might be an overestimate of our respondents' true compliance.",

Multivariate analysis showed 5 factors to be key predictors of nurses' compliance with the recommended use of facial protection. These factors include full-time work status, greater than 5 years tenure as a nurse, at least monthly use of facial protection, a belief that media coverage of infectious diseases impacts risk perception and work practices, and organizational support for health and safety. Strategies and interventions based on these findings should result in enhanced compliance with facial protection and, ultimately, a reduction in occupational transmission of communicable respiratory illness.",
