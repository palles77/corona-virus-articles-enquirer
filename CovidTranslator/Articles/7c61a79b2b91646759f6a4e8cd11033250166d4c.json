The associated disease is characterized by rash, high fever and severe arthritis that can persist for years. Since the epidemic on La R\u00e9union in 2006, CHIKV has adapted to Aedes albopictus, which also inhabits temperate regions of the eastern and western hemispheres, including Europe and the United States. A. albopictus might continue migrating north with continuing climate change and CHIKV would then no longer be confined to the developing nations. No treatment or licensed CHIKV vaccine exists. A CHIKV neutralization assay in a 384-well format by using CHIKV-pseudotyped lentiviral vectors was established. This assay system can be used for entry inhibitor screening under a reduced safety level (S2). Production of CHIKV-pseudotyped lentiviral vectors and the reaction volume are optimized. A dose dependent, specific neutralization of CHIKV-pseudotyped vectors with sera of CHIKV-infected individuals could be measured in a 384-well format. A safe and simple multiplex assay for the analysis of CHIKV neutralizing activities was developed and will be able to improve drug and vaccine development as well as it would improve the understanding of CHIKV epidemics regarding antibody responses.",

Most CHIKV infections are symptomatic, with an incubation period of 2-4 days. The disease is characterized by a sudden onset of fever, headache, malaise, arthralgias or arthritis, myalgias, and lower back pain. The term 'chikungunya' means 'that which bends up' in the Kimakonde language of Mozambique and describes the disease phenotype. After the acute phase, polyarthritis can be recurrent and may persist for several years after infection.

Aedes aegypti has been the primary CHIKV vector in Asia, but in La R\u00e9union, Aedes albopictus (the Asian tiger mosquito) was the primary vector (Solignat et al., 2009) . During this epidemic, CHIKV adapted effectively to A. albopictus, which also inhabits temperate and even cold temperate regions of the eastern and western hemispheres, including Europe and the United States (Medlock et al., 2012; Rochlin et al., 2013) . A. albopictus might continue migrating north with continuing climate change and CHIKV would then no longer be confined to the developing nations. A further risk of introducing CHIKV into previously non-endemic areas exists from travelers with viremia, leading to local transmission of the virus, especially in tropical or subtropical areas of the United States and also in southern Europe (Rezza et al., 2007) . As a result, the NIAID has designated CHIKV as a Category C pathogen alongside the influenza and SARS-CoV viruses. There is no specific treatment for chikungunya fever and care is only supportive, based on the symptoms. No licensed CHIKV vaccine exists.",

Alphaviruses enter cells by receptor mediated endocytosis and a subsequent pH-dependent fusion step. CHIKV has three surface proteins: the two transmembrane glycoproteins E2 and E1, and the mainly secreted E3 protein, which presumably facilitates secretion of the E2 and E1 glycoproteins (Mayne et al., 1984; Snyder and Mukhopadhyay, 2012) . E1 is a class II viral fusion protein and E2 most likely mediates cell attachment, however the cellular receptor is still unknown. E2 and E1 associate as trimers of heterodimers (E2-E1) on the particle surface (Voss et al., 2010) .",

Additionally, the glycoproteins are the major target of neutralizing antibody responses. A tool used to investigate the glycoproteins of viruses is the pseudotyping of vectors with desired glycoproteins. With this strategy, the vectors incorporate a heterologous viral glycoprotein and thereby acquire the host range of the virus the glycoprotein is derived of. They enable studies without the need of using the native virus, which usually requires a higher safety level. Pseudotyping of retro-or lentiviral vectors is frequently used to study viral entry and to evaluate entry inhibitors (Siegert et al., 2005) , or to harvest neutralizing antibodies at reduced safety levels (Schnierle et al., 1997; Seaman et al., 2010; Dervillez et al., 2010) . It has been previously described that lentiviral vectors can be pseudotyped with CHIKV E1/E2 and transfer the CHIKV host range to these vectors (Salvador et al., 2009; Akahata et al., 2010; Kishishita et al., 2013 ). This vector system was used to create a reduced safety level assay to analyze sera of CHIKV-infected individuals for their neutralizing activity, and thereby established a multiplexed assay in 384-well format for the analysis of compounds able to inhibit CHIKV entry.",

A series of tissue culture cell lines were transduced either with CHIKV-or VSV-G-pseudotyped vectors encoding GFP. Transduction efficiency was determined by flow cytometry. Lentiviral vectors pseudotyped with the vesicular stomatitis virus G protein (VSV-G) were used as positive control, since they are well known for their very broad cellular tropism. CHIKV-pseudotyped vectors were used to transduce a wide variety of mouse, rabbit, hamster, monkey and human cell lines, which is an extension and in agreement with published data (Salvador et al., 2009) (Fig. 2) . In contrast, hematopoietic cell lines were unaffected by CHIKV-pseudotyped vectors although VSV-G pseudotyped vectors were able to transduce them (Fig. 2 ) (Salvador et al., 2009 ). In general, titers of CHIKV-pseudotyped vectors were lower than VSV-G-pseudotyped vectors. Blocking of the pH-dependent entry pathway by addition of chloroquine during the transduction process occurred as expected for both VSV-G and CHIKV-pseudotyped vectors. Gibon ape leukemia virus (GaLV)pseudotyped vectors were not affected by chloroquine, because their entry is not pH-dependent (Fig. 3) .",

Therefore, the CHIKVpseudotyped vector system was adjusted. The vector construct (initially a GFP-encoding vector) was replaced by a vector encoding firefly luciferase (pCSII-Luc). This improved the data analysis, since a whole well readout of luminescence can be performed, which is superior over fluorescent readout in medium-throughput to highthroughput approaches. Furthermore, the luminescence signal is stable (depending on the substrate, the half-life can be >5 h), the assay can be used flexibly in various multi-well formats and it is very sensitive with low signal-to-noise ratios, outperforming standard fluorometric or colorimetric assays. In addition, CHIKVpseudotyped vector production was optimized by changing the transfection reagents. The use of lipofectamine increased the number of infectious particles released by the producer cells by 2.8-fold compared to the transfection reagent polyethylenimine (PEI). The assay was also optimized for a 384-well plate format by changing the reaction volume to 40 l.",

            "text": "Many vaccines rely on the generation of neutralizing antibodies that effectively block the initial viral infection. This result would also be desired for a CHIKV vaccine, since after the acute CHIKV infection phase, persistent polyarthritis frequently occurs in patients. Laboratory diagnosis of viral infection is usually confined to the detection of virus-specific antibodies in the blood, detection of virus antigens or detection of viral genetic material. However, these assays are limited and to provide functional data unable. For instance, nucleic acid amplification can only be used in the viremic phase during CHIKV infections. To determine the neutralizing activity of antibodies or drugs, conventional neutralization assays, like a plaque reduction assay or the inhibition of cytopathogenic effects, are time consuming and rely on the use of fully infectious human pathogens and a reliable reference stock of the virus. Efforts to improve these methods have been described recently. A neutralization assay based on CHIKV replicons expressing secreted Gaussia luciferase (Gluc) as read-out was recently described. The authors showed convincing data with neutralizing antisera of CHIKV infected patients in a 24-well and 96-well format (Glasker et al., 2013) . However the production of replicons requires an in vitro transcription and electroporation steps that may resemble technical hurdles. In addition, replicons still bear some residual danger of recombination and the generation of fully replicating CHIKV, although the readout of luciferase in the supernatant of cells is a benefit and omits cell lysis. A second novel approach uses pseudotyped lentiviral vector particles (Kishishita et al., 2013) . Here the vector particles needed to be purified by sucrose cushion centrifugation and the assay format was 24-well based. The assay was performed manually and in total took 5 days. Therefore, the method described here, to detect neutralizing activities using pseudotyped lentiviral vector particles in a high-throughput format is a further improvement. This semi-automated neutralization assay for CHIKV was established by using pseudotyped vector particles and the quantitation of luciferase activity. This assay has several advantages to other neutralization assays. It can be performed at a lower biosafety level (S2), thus does not require handling of a human S3 pathogen. Finally, an automated performance of the assay, including the seeding of target cells, makes it fast (3 days) and convenient for the development of entry inhibitors of CHIKV by high throughput screening by using pin tools with specific liquid handling high throughput screening equipment. In addition, the assay will also be helpful for CHIKV vaccine development to screen large numbers of serum samples during clinical trials, in an easy to perform, functional assay. Fast detection of neutralizing or cross-reactive neutralizing antibodies will speed up CHIKV and possibly other Alphavirus vaccine developments and might be useful for basic research to study Alphavirus-specific neutralizing immune responses during large outbreaks.",
