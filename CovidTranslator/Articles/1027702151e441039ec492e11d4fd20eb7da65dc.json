            "text": "Health care workers are exposed to potentially infectious airborne particles while providing routine care to coughing patients. However, much is not understood about the behavior of these aerosols and the risks they pose. We used a coughing patient simulator and a breathing worker simulator to investigate the exposure of health care workers to cough aerosol droplets, and to examine the efficacy of face shields in reducing this exposure. Our results showed that 0.9% of the initial burst of aerosol from a cough can be inhaled by a worker 46 cm (18 inches) from the patient. During testing of an influenza-laden cough aerosol with a volume median diameter (VMD) of 8.5 \u03bcm, wearing a face shield reduced the inhalational exposure of the worker by 96% in the period immediately after a cough. The face shield also reduced the surface contamination of a respirator by 97%. When a smaller cough aerosol was used (VMD = 3.4 \u03bcm), the face shield was less effective, blocking only 68% of the cough and 76% of the surface contamination. In the period from 1 to 30 minutes after a cough, during which the aerosol had dispersed throughout the room and larger particles had settled, the face shield reduced aerosol inhalation by only 23%. Increasing the distance between the patient and worker to 183 cm (72 inches) reduced the exposure to influenza that occurred immediately after a cough by 92%. Our results show that health care workers can inhale infectious airborne particles while treating a coughing patient. Face shields can substantially reduce the short-term exposure of health care workers to large infectious aerosol particles, but smaller particles can remain airborne longer and flow around the face shield more easily to be inhaled. Thus, face shields provide a useful adjunct to respiratory protection for workers caring for patients with respiratory infections. However, they cannot be used as a substitute for respiratory protection when it is needed.",

            "text": "Sprays and splashes of fluids containing infectious microorganisms present an occupational hazard for health care workers. Droplets of these fluids can be inhaled, land on broken skin, or deposit on mucus membranes in the mouth, nose, or eyes. Once there, the pathogens they carry may infect workers and cause illness. For this reason, the U.S. Health care Infection Control Practices Advisory Committee (HICPAC) recommends that a mask and eye protection be worn \"during procedures and patient care activities likely to generate splashes or sprays of blood, body fluids, [or] secretions. . ..\" (1) However, although the requirement to wear a face shield or goggles while performing aerosol-generating procedures is well established, the need for such equipment to protect health care workers during routine care of patients with respiratory infections is the subject of debate. The current HICPAC guidelines explicitly recommend wearing a face shield or goggles during all patient care for certain illnesses such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and avian influenza. (1) For other infections that may be spread by respiratory aerosol droplets, HICPAC recommends wearing a face mask but states that it has \"no recommendation for routinely wearing eye protection (e.g., goggle or face shield), in addition to a mask, for close contact with patients who require Droplet Precautions. [This is an] unresolved issue.\" (1) One reason for the controversy surrounding a recommendation to wear goggles or a face shield while treating patients with respiratory infections is that little is known about the potential exposure to pathogen-laden droplets from these patients and the efficacy of different types of protective measures. This is particularly true for aerosols produced during coughing, which is one of the most common symptoms of respiratory tract infections. Coughing helps clear the airways of mucus and remove excess fluids from the lungs, especially when normal mechanisms of mucociliary clearance are impaired. (2) During a cough, droplets of airway secretions can become airborne and be expelled from the mouth in a high-velocity aerosol plume. The aerosol droplets generated during coughing span a broad size range, from tens of nanometers to hundreds of micrometers, and the dispersion of these droplets in the environment depends to a large degree upon their size. (3, 4) Small aerosol droplets from a coughing patient can remain airborne and spread throughout a room, and can easily be inhaled by a health care worker. (5, 6) The potential for larger droplets to settle onto surfaces, impact on the face or eyes, or to be inhaled is not as well studied, and many questions remain. In early work, Wells estimated that droplets with a diameter of 100 \u03bcm or more will tend to settle rapidly to the ground before evaporating, while smaller droplets will evaporate and become \"droplet nuclei,\" remaining airborne much longer. (7) Nicas et al. later revised this with newer data on the composition of respiratory fluids and concluded that particles needed to have initial diameters less than 20 \u03bcm to become droplet nuclei. (4) In an early photographic study, Jennison found that the majority of visible droplets produced during coughing and sneezing travel only 2 to 3 feet from the mouth, but that some were able to travel much farther. (8) Using a numerical model, Xie et al. calculated that droplets as large as 200 \u03bcm could travel 1.5 m from a coughing patient before settling. (9) In an experimental study, Hamburger and Robertson showed that most bacteria from human sneezes were detected in droplets that settled within 1.5 feet of the test subject, but that some droplets settled as far as 9.5 feet away. (10) Bischoff et al. collected aerosol samples in hospital rooms with influenza patients; they found that influenza-laden particles with diameters greater than 4.7 \u03bcm could be found 6 feet away from the patient, but that the amount of virus detected was much lower than at closer distances. (11) Face shields are one option for protecting the face from pathogen-laden droplets. Although they are more bulky than goggles or safety glasses, face shields offer the advantage of guarding the entire face from contamination. (12) Some workers also may find face shields more comfortable or find that they fit better over eyeglasses or respirators. Several studies have examined face shields after use during surgeries or other aerosol-generating medical and dental procedures as a way of demonstrating that an exposure risk exists and that face shields provide protection. These studies found that many or most of the face shields worn by the health care workers had splatters of blood or other fluids and that this contamination frequently went un-noticed. (13) (14) (15) (16) (17) However, although these studies clearly demonstrate that face shields can intercept droplets traveling toward the face, they do not indicate which sizes of aerosol droplets are blocked and which are able to travel around the shield to be inhaled or deposited on the face. In addition, the studies all examined procedures in which significant droplet generation was expected, but none looked at potential exposure to aerosols from coughing patients with respiratory infections, about which less is known. During the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommended that health care workers consider using face shields to reduce the surface contamination of respirators. (18) However, no data have been published showing how much exterior deposition of pathogens occurs or how effectively face shields decrease it. In its 2011 report on preventing transmission of pandemic influenza, the Institute of Medicine (IOM) urged the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) and other organizations to \"investigate the effectiveness of face masks and face shields in preventing transmission of viral respiratory diseases.\" (19) The purpose of this study was to quantify the exposure of health care workers to cough aerosol droplets while working close to a patient and to examine the efficacy of face shields in reducing this exposure. Our results provide a better understanding of the health risks posed by infectious droplets produced by coughing patients and of the appropriate protective equipment in these situations. This work should assist the occupational and public health communities in providing research-based recommendations for effective strategies for the protection of workers in health care settings.",

During the experiments, the chamber was sealed and the filtration system was off, so that no air exchange or filtration occurred. The cough aerosol simulator, breathing simulator, and aerosol particle measurement instruments were controlled from outside the exposure chamber. During the aerosol particle measurement experiments, the chamber temperature was 24\u00b0C (SD 1.4\u00b0C) and the relative humidity was 21% (SD 5.9%). During the experiments using influenza virus, the chamber temperature was 24\u00b0C (SD 1.3\u00b0C) and the relative humidity was 23% (SD 3.3%).",

(21) The test aerosol was generated by aerosolizing CDMEM alone for the aerosol particle measurement experiments, and CDMEM containing influenza virus for the influenza virus experiments. For some experiments, an air brush (Model 200, Badger Air-Brush Co., Franklin, Ill.) was used to produce a cough aerosol with a volume median diameter (VMD) of 8.5 \u03bcm and a geometric standard deviation (GSD) of 2.9 (referred to here as the \"large-particle cough aerosol\"). For other experiments, a micropump nebulizer (Aeroneb AG-AL7000SM, Aerogen, Galway, Ireland) was used to produce an aerosol with a VMD of 3.4 \u03bcm and a GSD of 2.3 (\"small-particle cough aerosol\"). For both aerosol generators, the total volume of the aerosol expelled during each cough was approximately 68 \u03bcl. As described previously, the cough volume and amount of influenza virus expelled in each cough are considerably larger than those reported for human coughs. (21) This is necessary to allow detection of the airborne particles and influenza virus after the particles have dispersed in the test chamber. The cough airflow was produced by a metal bellows driven by a computer-controlled linear motor. It was based on coughs recorded from influenza patients and had a volume of 4.2 l and a peak flow rate of 11.4 liters per second (l/ sec). The coughing and breathing simulators were synchronized so that each cough was initiated at the start of an inhalation by the breathing simulator.",

For experiments using influenza virus in the cough aerosol, a N95 respirator was used as a collection filter for virus-laden particles that were inhaled by the breathing simulator. When a respirator collection filter was used, it was sealed to the head form with adhesive, and the respirator was tested for leaks with a standard respirator fit-testing device (Model 8038 PortaCount Pro Plus, TSI, Shoreview, Minn.).

The outermost layer of each coupon (referred to here as the \"outer layer\") was separated from the middle and inner layers (referred to collectively as the \"inner layers\") and the influenza virus was eluted from each coupon layer by overnight incubation in 2 ml of supplemented Hank's Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS) (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY).

Viral RNA was isolated from an aliquot of the elution medium, and the number of copies of the virus present in each sample was determined with quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR).

Consequently, using the face shield only caused a modest decrease in the inhalation of airborne particles over the long term ( Figure 6 ). The results also indicate that the long-term exposure to the cough aerosol particles was actually somewhat higher when the breathing simulator was farther from the coughing simulator than when it was closer (183 cm vs. 46 cm). This may seem counterintuitive, especially given the results from the spray analyzer, but in fact this outcome reflects the dynamics of the movement of the cough aerosol over a longer time frame and the fact that the long-term exposure measurement does not include the first minute of the cough. When the coughing and breathing simulators are close together, the cough aerosol is concentrated in a fast-moving plume that quickly sweeps past the breathing simulator and is replaced by cleaner entrained air from the surrounding environment. On the other hand, when the coughing and breathing simulators are farther apart, the cough aerosol plume broadens and slows down before reaching the breathing simulator and thus remains in the vicinity longer. The difference in concentration decreases over time as the aerosol disperses more evenly throughout the room (Figure 4 and Figure 5 ).",

Second, the spray analyzer directly measures a region within the aerosol cloud, whereas the OPC draws a sample of the aerosol. Third, the spray analyzer measured the aerosol immediately after the cough, when many of the droplets were still wet, while the OPC measured particles that had time for evaporation and thus may have been smaller and more concentrated. Because of these limitations, the measurements must be compared cautiously, but they do suggest that the volume of aerosol inhaled during the first few seconds was about an order of magnitude larger than the quantity inhaled over the next 29 min.",

This effect was most pronounced for the large-particle cough aerosol when the simulators were 46 cm apart and the virus was collected for 5 min after a cough. In this case, the amount of virus on the respirator was 96% lower when a face shield was worn. Similar results for the inhalation of viable influenza virus were seen with the viral plaque assays, although the lower sensitivity of the VPA relative to PCR produced results that were less conclusive. After 30 min, the amount of virus collected when a face shield was worn was reduced by 81%, which suggests that over the long term the face shield has less of a protective effect because smaller particles are able to flow around it and accumulate over time. Similarly, the face shield also was less effective against the small-particle cough aerosol; virus deposition was reduced by only 68%, again because small particles are better able to travel around the face shield and be inhaled.",

This is consistent with findings from comparing the volumes of inhaled particles with use of the spray analyzer and OPCs, as discussed earlier. Increasing the distance between the simulators to 183 cm decreased the amount of virus inhaled by 92%, and the amount of virus collected was virtually the same with or without a face shield. These results indicate that, over the longer distance, the larger particles tended to slow down and fall toward the ground before they could reach the breathing simulator, while the smaller particles were able to traverse this distance and be inhaled. Note that the influenza virus collection occurred from 0 min to 5 min after each cough, when large particles were still airborne and could be collected. On the other hand, the particle counter results discussed above covered the time from 1 min to 30 min after a cough, when the large particles were no longer airborne. This difference in large particle collection explains why the particle counter results showed an increase in particle inhalation when the distance increased, while the influenza virus results showed a decrease in virus collection when the distance increased. An examination of the amount of virus deposited on the different layers of the respirator also shows that smaller particles are better able to evade a face shield. Larger aerosol particles are more likely to deposit on the outer layer of the respirator, while smaller particles are more likely to reach the inner layers. The use of a face shield reduced the fraction of the virus that deposited in the outer layer relative to the inner layers, which suggests that the aerosol reaching the respirator had a smaller average size.",

(18) Our results suggest that this would in fact be an effective strategy. In the large-particle cough experiments where the simulators were 46 cm apart and collection occurred for 5 min, the amount of influenza virus that was deposited on the outer mask layer was reduced by 97% when a face shield was worn. In fact, because our cough simulations were limited to aerosol particles up to 100 \u03bcm, the reduction in external contamination would likely be much greater in cases where patients were producing coughs or sneezes with larger spray droplets. For the small-particle cough aerosol, the surface contamination was reduced by 76%, again showing that face shields are most protective against larger particles.",

First, aerosol measurements of human coughs show tremendous variation from person to person in the quantity and size distribution of the aerosol particles and the amount of pathogens that are expelled. (3, (22) (23) (24) (25) For this reason, it is impossible to define any particular cough aerosol profile as being representative of a human cough. Although the cough simulator generates aerosol outputs that are similar to human coughs, (21) they are only two possibilities among a multitude of potential human cough aerosol expulsions, and other cough profiles may produce different results. Second, the concentration of influenza virus in the cough aerosol from the simulator is likely to be about the same for droplets of all sizes, since the virus is dispersed in the test medium. This is unlikely to be the case for human cough aerosols because pathogens such as influenza are not uniformly distributed through the respiratory tract, and this distribution probably also varies with different microorganisms.",

The bimodal distribution was consistently present in the results for all coughs; the peak at the larger particle size generally dominated during the initial part of the cough and inhalation, while the peak at the smaller size dominated later in the cough (data not shown). Until this aspect of the results is better understood, it should be interpreted with caution. Fourth, the test chamber was sealed so that no air exchange or filtration occurred during the experiments. Air filtration or exchange would be expected to reduce the long-term exposure to airborne particles, and room airflow patterns could also affect exposure. (5) Finally, these experiments were conducted with the breathing simulator and the face shield facing directly toward the coughing simulator. Although this is probably the most common situation, it is not difficult to imagine scenarios where, for example, the head of a health care worker might be tilted up or sideways, away from a supine patient, to examine a monitor or adjust an IV bag. In that case, a cough could easily enter below or from the side of the face shield and impinge more directly on the face of the worker.",

Although it is agreed that workers need respiratory protection while treating patients with certain diseases that are known to be transmitted by airborne particles, the utility of protective devices such as face shields under these conditions is less clear. Our results show that considerable exposures of workers to potentially infectious material can occur over very short time frames when they examine or treat a coughing patient at close range. The use of face shields can substantially reduce the short-term exposure of health care workers to larger infectious aerosol particles and can reduce contamination of their respirators. They are less effective against smaller particles, which can remain airborne for extended periods and can easily flow around a face shield to be inhaled. Thus, face shields can provide a useful adjunct to respiratory protection for workers caring for patients with respiratory infections. However, they cannot be used as a substitute for respiratory protection when it is needed.",
