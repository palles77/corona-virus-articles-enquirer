At least four kinds of swine enteric CoVs have been identified, including transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV), and the emerging HKU2-like porcine enteric alphacoronavirus (PEAV). The small intestines, particularly the jejunum and ileum, are the most common targets of these four CoVs in vivo, and co-infections by these CoVs are frequently observed in clinically infected pigs. This study was conducted to investigate the susceptibility of the porcine ileum epithelial cell line, IPI-2I, to different swine enteric CoVs. We found that IPI-2I cells are highly susceptible to TGEV, PDCoV, and PEAV, as demonstrated by cytopathic effect and virus multiplication. However, only a small number of cells could be infected by PEDV, possibly due to the heterogeneity of IPI-2I cells. A homogeneous cell line, designated IPI-FX, obtained from IPI-2I cells by sub-cloning with limited serial dilutions, was found to be highly susceptible to PEDV. Furthermore, IPI-FX cells were also highly susceptible to TGEV, PDCoV, as well as PEAV. Thus, this sub-cloned IPI-FX cell line is an ideal cell model to study the mechanisms of infection, particularly co-infections of swine enteric CoVs.",

CoVs can cause respiratory, enteric, hepatic, or neurological diseases of varying severity in a variety of animals (Gerdts and Zakhartchouk, 2017) . Swine enteric CoV is one of the main causative pathogens of viral diarrhea in piglets. To date, at least four kinds of swine enteric CoVs have been identified, including transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV), and HKU2-like porcine enteric alphacoronavirus (PEAV). TGEV, PEDV and PEAV belong to the \u03b1-CoVs, while PDCoV is a member of the genus \u03b4-CoV (Pan et al., 2017; Pensaert and de Bouck, 1978; Woo et al., 2012) . Among the four swine enteric CoVs, TGEV was the first to be identified in the United States as early as 1946 (Doyle and Hutchings, 1946) . PEDV was discovered in the United Kingdom in the early 1970s and was subsequently identified in many European and Asian countries (Lee, 2015; Pensaert and de Bouck, 1978) . Since late 2010, variant PEDV strains have reemerged in China and have now become the dominant global strain (Huang et al., 2013; Li et al., 2012) . PDCoV was originally found in pig manure in Hong Kong in 2009, and the first outbreak was reported in 2014 in the United States Woo et al., 2012) . The newly identified PEAV is a bat-HUK2-like CoV in swine which was found in a diarrhea outbreak in swine herds in Guangdong, China in 2017 (Gong et al., 2017; Pan et al., 2017; Zhou et al., 2018) . All four swine enteric CoVs cause severe diarrhea, vomiting, and mortality in piglets, resulting in great economic losses and posing a continuing threat to the development of the pig industry.",

It is well known that porcine intestinal epithelial cells are the primary target cells in vivo for swine enteric CoVs. However, none of the https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2019.04.014 Received 31 January 2019; Received in revised form 8 April 2019; Accepted 10 April 2019 T cells mentioned above (Vero, ST, are derived from the porcine intestinal tract. Biological experiments with enteric CoVs on non-intestinal epithelial cells often do not mimic real infections and are unsuitable for studying cell-virus interactions. IPEC-J2 is a line of porcine intestinal epithelial cells derived from neonatal pig jejunum (Brosnahan and Brown, 2012) . Some studies have shown that IPEC-J2 cells were susceptible to PEDV infection, while others reported the opposite Zhao et al., 2014) . However, a subclone of IPEC-J2 cells, IPEC-DQ, supports efficient PEDV propagation . Recently, Jung et al. also tested the susceptibility of IPEC-J2 cells to PDCoV infection and found that IPEC-J2 cells supported PDCoV propagation but cytopathic effect (CPE) could only be observed after the 3rd serial passage of PDCoV in this cell type (Jung et al., 2018) .",

However, whether IPI-2I cells are susceptible to swine enteric CoVs has not been characterized. In this study, we investigated the susceptibility of IPI-2I cells to four different swine enteric CoVs and established a subcloned homogeneous cell population (designated IPI-FX), which can be efficiently infected by all four swine enteric CoVs.",

To this end, IPI-2I cells were infected with TGEV strain WH-1 (MOI = 1) and microscopically monitored for CPE at 6, 12, 18, 24 and 30 hpi. As shown in Fig. 1A , typical CPE became visible at 12 hpi and was readily apparent as the infection progressed. IFA was performed X. Wang, et al. Veterinary Microbiology 233 (2019) 21-27 using mAb against TGEV N protein to further confirm TGEV infection at different time points after inoculation (Fig. 1B) . We also compared the growth curves of TGEV in IPI-2I and ST cells (MOI = 0.1). The results showed that the viral titers gradually increased after infection in IPI-2I (Fig. 1C) . Furthermore, TGEV achieved higher viral titers in IPI-2I than in ST cells (Fig. 1C) , suggesting that IPI-2I cells are highly susceptible to TGEV infection. Accumulating evidence has suggested that supplemental trypsin in the cell culture medium contributes to a significant increase in viral titers of PEDV, PDCoV, and PEAV, compared with non-trypsin medium . Before evaluating the susceptibility of IPI-2I cells to infection with these enteric CoVs, we examined the trypsin tolerance of IPI-2I cells. Monolayers of IPI-2I cells were treated with different concentrations (0, 1.25, 2.5, 5, 7.5 and 10 \u03bcg/ml) of trypsin and the results showed that the optimal concentration of trypsin added in IPI-2I cell culture medium was 2.5 \u03bcg/ml. We then investigated the susceptibility of IPI-2I cells to PDCoV infection under this trypsin concentration. As shown in Fig. 2 , typical CPE, characterized by shrunken, rounded and clustered cells, was observed at 12-30 hpi in PDCoV-infected IPI-2I cells ( Fig. 2A) . Infection was also confirmed by IFA staining with mAb against PDCoV S protein (Fig. 2B) . By comparing the growth curves of PDCoV in IPI-2I and LLC-PK1 cells (MOI = 0.1), the viral titers in IPI-2I cells were lower than those in LLC-PK1 cells (Fig. 2C) .

We found that IPI-2I cells are highly susceptible to TGEV, PDCoV and PEAV.

The trypsin concentrations used in IPI-2I cells and Vero cells were 2.5 \u03bcg/ml and 7.5 \u03bcg/ml, respectively. Cell were collected at 6, 12, 18, 24 and 30 hpi to determine the viral titers by TCID 50 assay. X. Wang, et al. Veterinary Microbiology 233 (2019) 21-27 We speculated that the lower trypsin tolerance of IPI-2I may account for the lower viral titers of PDCoV and PEAV. The maximum concentration of trypsin tolerated by IPI-2I cells was 2.5 \u03bcg/ml, while LLC-PK1 and Vero cells are highly resistant to trypsin, and 5-10 \u03bcg/ml of trypsin concentrations are usually used for PDCoV and PEAV infection (Dong et al., 2016; Hu et al., 2015; Pan et al., 2017) . Previous studies have suggested that trypsin is crucial for cell membrane fusion and entry of swine enteric CoVs, and can mediate the membrane fusion activation of virions by lysis of glycoprotein spikes (Dong et al., 2016; Wicht et al., 2014) . The higher viral titers of TGEV in infected IPI-2I cells compared with ST cells appears to support our speculations. There is no need for trypsin addition for TGEV proliferation, and the higher viral titers of TGEV in IPI-2I cells were achieved in the absence of exogenous trypsin. We also determined the viral titers of PDCoV and PEAV in LLC-PK1 and Vero cells, respectively, under the trypsin concentration of 2.5 \u03bcg/ml, and found that similar viral titers could be achieved compared to those X. Wang, et al. Veterinary Microbiology 233 (2019) 21-27 in IPI-2I cells (data not shown). The trypsin tolerance concentrations of IPI-FX cells were also measured and found that the same trypsin concentrations were tolerated by IPI-FX and IPI-2I cells.

Likewise, the non-homogeneous IPEC-J2 cells exhibit lower susceptible to PEDV, while the homogeneous IPEC-DQ which was sub-cloned from IPEC-J2 cells by limited serial dilutions, can be readily infected by PEDV . Recently, Jung et al. tested the susceptibility of IPEC-J2 to infection with PDCoV and found that viral RNA could be detected in the cell culture supernatant after two continuous passages in the IPEC-J2 cells supplemented with 10 \u03bcg/ml of trypsin; however, no CPE was observed (Jung et al., 2018) . By modifying the procedure of inoculation, that is, omitting the washing of cells after virus adsorption, the 4th passaged PDCoV in IPEC-J2 cells showed CPE characterized by enlarged, rounded and densely granular cells (Jung et al., 2018) . In our present study, evident CPE could be observed in IPI-2I cells infected with the 1st passage of PDCoV, even when supplemented with only 2.5 \u03bcg/ml of trypsin in the cell culture medium. It appears that IPI-2I cells are more susceptible than IPEC-J2 cells to PDCoV infection. Based on the results that homogeneous IPEC-DQ from IPEC-J2 as well as IPI-FX from IPI-2I cells are highly susceptible to PEDV, it is possible that homogeneous IPEC cell lines susceptible to PDCoV, and even to all four swine enteric CoVs, can be obtained by the sub-cloning method.

For example, PEDV and TGEV co-infections are frequently detected in piglets with severe diarrhea, and recently a chimeric swine enteric CoV containing the S-gene and 3a sequences from PEDV within a backbone of TGEV has been reported in Italy (Belsham et al., 2016) . Similar chimeric viruses were also reported in Germany and Slovakia (Akimkin et al., 2016; Mandelik et al., 2018) . It was proven experimentally that co-infections with PEDV and TGEV in cultured cells enhanced the damage to tight junctions and the remodeling of microfilaments compared with single infections with the same viruses (Belsham et al., 2016) . Co-infections with PEDV and PDCoV in pigs have also be reported in several studies previously (Dong et al., 2015; Jang et al., 2017; Song et al., 2015) . Before the outbreak of PEAV in farms in China in 2017, PEDV broke out in the same farms, indicating possible concurrent infections with PEDV and PEAV (Gong et al., 2017; Zhou et al., 2018) . Together, co-infections with different Fig. 6 . IPI-FX cells can be effectively infected by TGEV, PDCoV, and PEAV. IPI-FX cells were mock-infected or infected with TGEV (A), PDCoV (B), PEAV (C) at a MOI of 1 for 24 h. Cytopathic effect was observed and indirect immunofluorescence assays were performed to confirm infection with specific monoclonal antibodies. The growth kinetics curves of TGEV (A), PDCoV (B), PEAV (C) in IPI-FX cells were determined by collecting virus-infected cells (MOI = 0.1) at different time points (6, 12, 18, 24 and 30 hpi), followed by TCID 50 assay. X. Wang, et al. Veterinary Microbiology 233 (2019) 21-27 swine enteric CoVs are an enormous threat to pig production. Thus, to dissect the mechanisms involved in co-infection with swine enteric CoVs in vivo or in vitro is receiving increasing attention. The IPI-FX cells established here are highly susceptible to all four swine enteric CoVs, and are derived from the ileum of porcine intestinal tracts, the common natural target of these enteric CoVs. Therefore, the IPI-FX cell line is an ideal cell model to study co-infections of swine enteric CoVs.",
