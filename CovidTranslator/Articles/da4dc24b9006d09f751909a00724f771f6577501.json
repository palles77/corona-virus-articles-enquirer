Two Histophilus somni-associated syndromes were identified: systemic histophilosis (n=4) and abortion (n=1). The principal pathological findings included vasculitis, meningoencephalitis with thrombosis, necrotizing myocarditis, renal infarctions, hepatic abscesses, and bronchopneumonia. PCR assays were used to amplify specific amplicons of the ovine herpesvirus 2, bovine herpesvirus 1 and \u22125, Listeria monocytogenes, H. somni, and pestivirus; bovine group A rotavirus (BoRV-A) and bovine coronavirus (BCoV) were investigated in calves with diarrhea. H. somni DNA was amplified in tissues from all calves and the brain of the aborted fetus with pathological alterations consistent with histophilosis. All other PCR assays were negative; BoRV-A and BCoV were not identified. These findings confirm the participation of H. somni in the pathological alterations observed in this study and represent the first description of histophilosis in cattle from Brazil.",

Additionally, H. somni is one of the bacterial pathogens associated with the clinical entity known as bovine respiratory disease of feedlot cattle (Divers 2008) and is a normal habitat of the reproductive and respiratory mucus membranes of asymptomatic cattle (Harris and Janzen 1989; Corbeil 2007; Woolums et al. 2009 ). Furthermore, based on sequence analyses of the 16S rRNA and rpoB genes, it was proposed that the organisms referred to as Haemophilus somni, Haemophilus agni, and Histophilus ovis are in fact H. somni and should represent a novel genus within the Pasteurellaceae family (Angen et al. 2003) . However, differences between ovine and bovine strains of H. somni have been identified (Tanaka et al. 2005) .",

Furthermore, H. somni-induced infections are more predominant in young cattle (Harris and Janzen 1989; Van Donkersgoed et al. 1990 ) and in feedlot relative to dairy and pastured animals (Fecteau and George 2004) , occurring within the first 2 weeks or months of the feeding period (Woolums et al. 2009 ).",

The clinical signs observed were not common within the farms and varied between sudden death (farms A and B), reproductive problems (farm C), and gastrointestinal manifestations (farm D). Animals at farms A and B demonstrated predominantly neurological manifestations. Reproductive complaints included infertility, 20 abortions, and a reduced conception rate (35 %). Most calves at farm D had a clinical diagnosis of coccidiosis and suffered from intermittent diarrhea during the last few months. All cattle were reared on pasture; water and commercial mineral salts were administered ad libitum.",

Phylogenetic analyses revealed that these sequences clustered with other bovine sequences of H. somni derived from different geographical regions, being more closely related to cases from Canada and Australia (Fig. 3) . However, ovine-derived H. somni sequences clustered apart from their bovine counterparts, but all H. somni sequences (bovine and ovine) formed a cluster that was distinct from other members of the Pasteurellaceae family. The nucleotide sequences used for phylogenetic analyses during this study are given in Fig. 3 . After a diagnosis of H. somni-induced infection was confirmed at farm D, all remaining diarrheic Shorthorn calves were medicated with oxytetracycline. The consulting veterinarian has informed that the episodes of diarrhea have ceased, and these calves have since recuperated and are gaining body weight. Feces from the calf necropsied from this farm were negative for BCoV and BoRV-A.",

Additional confirmation of the participation of H. somni in the etiopathogenesis of these manifestations was obtained by the successful amplification of the 16S rRNA gene of this bacterium from tissue fragments of all animals evaluated; similar results have been described (Angen et al. 1998 (Angen et al. , 2003 . These findings represent the first characterization of H. somni-induced infections in cattle from Brazil and extend the geographical distribution of this important pathogen of cattle, since most descriptions of H. somni in livestock have originated from North America (Harris and Janzen 1989; Fecteau and George 2004; P\u00e9rez et al. 2010 ). All calves herein described demonstrated pathological manifestations consistent with systemic histophilosis, with meningoencephalitis with vasculitis and thrombosis occurring in most animals, except in one calf with severe necrotizing myocardial histophilosis. Although TME is a common neurological manifestation of histophilosis (Fecteau and George 2004; George 2009) , studies have suggested that systemic histophilosis is more frequently diagnosed relative to TME (Harris and Janzen 1989; Van Donkersgoed et al. 1990 ). Furthermore, most of these calves had pulmonary disease, which might be the source of dissemination in these cases (Harris and Janzen 1989; Fecteau and George 2004; P\u00e9rez et al. 2010) . The hepatic abscess observed in animal no. 3 and multiple renal infarctions of animal no. 5 were previously described in systemic histophilosis (P\u00e9rez et al. 2010) . The wedge-shaped patterns observed grossly associated with the histopathological findings are characteristic of infarction due to obstruction of the interlobular artery. The finding of thrombi within several organs of these animals is a frequent manifestation of systemic histophilosis (Momotani et al. 1985) . Although the pathogenesis of H. somni-induced infections is not well elucidated and is very complex (Corbeil 2007) , the disseminated vasculitis observed during this study has been associated with several virulence factors such as lipooligosaccharide, immunoglobulin-binding proteins, major outer membrane proteins, histamine production, and exopolysaccharide (Corbeil 2007; P\u00e9rez et al. 2010) . However, apoptotic cell death of endothelial cells caused by this bacterium might be the key to explain thrombosis in histophilosis (Corbeil 2007; Woolums et al. 2009; P\u00e9rez et al. 2010) .",

Alternatively, the principal pathogens associated with diarrhea in calves are BCoV, BoRV-A, BVDV, Clostridium perfringens-induced enterotoxemia, enterotoxigenic E. coli, Cryptosporidium spp., and Salmonella spp. (Gunn et al. 2009 ).

Additionally, the pathogenesis of bovine babesiosis is incompatible with the age (1 day) of this calf because of the following: (1) clinical manifestations of bovine babesiosis occurs 2 to 3 weeks after tick infestation; (2) the incubation period varies from 5 days to around 3 weeks; and (3) calves in endemic areas, as was this animal, have a natural immunity to babesiosis, which is reinforced by colostral antibodies (Zaugg 2009 ). Consequently, cerebral babesiosis was excluded as part of the etiopathogenesis associated with this manifestation, but it is proposed that cerebral histophilosis be included as differential diagnosis in cases of cerebral cortical congestion in cattle, particularly in young animals.",

Myocardial histophilosis was also one of the main causes of calf mortality in feedlot cattle in another Canadian study (Van Donkersgoed et al. 1990 ). Nevertheless, bovine myocardial histophilosis is considered rare and sporadic in the USA compared to Canada (O'Toole et al. 2009 ). Additionally, in this study, myocardial histophilosis was observed at the left ventricular myocardium in both calves; this also occurred in the case from Wyoming (O'Toole et al. 2009 ) and seems to be a frequent anatomic location for bovine myocardial histophilosis (Harris and Janzen 1989; O'Toole et al. 2009 ).",

Additionally, all diarrheic calves treated with oxytetracycline recovered completely; this is important in associating the participation of H. somni-induced disease in the diarrheic animals since oxytetracycline is the drug of choice for H. somni-induced infections (Harris and Janzen 1989; Fecteau and George 2004; George 2009; Woolums et al. 2009 ), and standing animals medicated during the progression of histophilosis are known to recover (Harris and Janzen 1989; Woolums et al. 2009 ). Although other common pathogens were not identified in these animals, the possible participation of a non-evaluated viral or bacterial agent cannot be completely excluded as stressor associated with the development of systemic histophilosis. Since only one aborted fetus from farm C and one calf was affected at farm D, whole blood was collected from other calves of similar age range and from the cow of the aborted fetus and cows with history of abortion from farm C, in an attempt to identify additional bacteremic calves at the first location and the source of infection at the latter. However, all of these samples from farms C and D were negative for H. somni; this suggests that these animals were not bacteremic, but the PCR-negative cows could have been asymptomatic carriers (P\u00e9rez et al. 2010 ) and the source of infection at the farm with a history of abortion.",

The animals of most farms are reared exclusively on pastures; H. somni is more frequently diagnosed in feedlot cattle (Fecteau and George 2004) . Nevertheless, since these infections occurred at farms from distinct areas and that there was no movement of cattle between the affected farms, the authors believe that this bacterium was always present within the Brazilian cattle herds but was never diagnosed or the possibility of H. somni-induced infections, investigated. This might be because the diverse clinical manifestations associated with H. somni, as observed in these cases, can be easily confused with other diseases (such as bovine viral diarrhea; infectious bovine rhinotracheitis; rotavirus and coronavirus enteritis; herpesvirus-induced meningoencephalitis; and malignant catarrhal fever) that are more frequently associated with cattle mortality in Brazil. Consequently, it is recommended that H. somni be included in the list of differentials to investigate livestock mortality in Brazil and South America, since this pathogen was previously diagnosed in a sheep with endometritis from Brazil (Rizzo et al. 2012) and sporadic outbreaks have occurred in Argentina (Descarga et al. 2002) .",
