It argues that cross-cultural communication is a key skill developed by an exchange. The value base proposed includes belief in global interdependence, a willingness to scrutinize the history of student national and cultural identity, and commitment to evaluation. The knowledge base includes human rights, the history of social and economic development, and models of assessment and social justice.",

Tan referred to the history of the social work profession in the Western World as still focusing on microsystems, casework and the client as victim or person caught up in pathological relationships. Although many of the audience were radical social workers and community organizers, it is difficult to refute this imagery of the West when so much agency and therapeutic work is based on individual interventions financed through health insurance or in some countries, departments of child protection or education.",

Part of the challenge lies in funding sources for the profession. The exchange of information across countries can alert us to opportunities and strategies developed by other systems to separate the principles and implementation of social work practice from purely fiscal control. One example of fiscal control in the US is the influence of insurance company administrators on which claims for healthcare are appropriate. Fiscal responsibility is a professional expectation. When caught up in familiar systems, professionals may miss the wider array of practice that comes with a global view. Student exchange in particular, is a way to escape narrow vision. The focus of this article is the learning that can happen when students are encouraged into exchanges and conversations with social work students, educators and professionals in countries and cultures other than their own. In addition to conceptual arguments, reference is made to the increase in efforts to assess the impact of programs through research and evaluation (Van Hoof and Verbeeten, 2005 ; Center for Global Education, 2011).",

The premise of international exchange is to broaden thinking and recognize that limiting intervention to one model or another is to underserve communities. The tension becomes how to change traditions and find compatible language to share plans for effective future international and global collaboration in a fast globalizing world. Compounding this East-West divide is the current demonizing, especially in the US but also in Europe, of China's fast industrial growth and dominant market position (Editor, Economist, December 2012). For example, it was part of the Republican platform in the US during their 2012 presidential election, to cast China in the negative light of cheap labor and exploitation. An alternative view sees a vast country with much work to do in terms of fair working conditions, catching up on the same cycles of industrial and postindustrial growth that countries of the West have passed through (Midgley, 2012) . India and China, are two vast countries caught up in rates of growth that strain every aspect of life (Editor, Economist, December 2012).",

Beyond the frank interpretation of meaningwhat is trash to one, is rubbish to another is treasure to yet othersis the task to be truly curious, without feelings of superiority. It means realizing that our sense of reality is just one perspective on a complex gathering of cultures that make up the kaleidoscope of the world. Carter and Qureshi (1995) define culture in a way that reflects this notion of variety and equal worth: \"culture is a learned system of meaning and behaviors that is passed from one generation to the next\" in a geographical setting. Similarly Razack (2002: p. 251 ) puts culture at the center of student exchange, where colonial and oppressive history is looked in the eye and students challenge themselves to trace their generational identity.",

First, second or third world concepts are replaced with the (fourth) goal of recognizing that every country is part of a development cycle and all have elements of learning and human insight to share and to benefit from. A fifth goal, integration of this recognition of our universal generational experience of social and economic development, leads to more open attitudes to learning, to future career choices that include international opportunities and relationships (Bess and Link, 2012) . Without this internalized recognition, social workers are at risk of ignoring valuable international policy instruments and worse, exposing themselves to unethical or illegal practice, such as the inadequate documentation of international adoptions (Rotabi, 2012; Shukovsky, 2003) . These goals build the theory of student exchange, which is still relatively new, but the practice of exchange goes back much further (Lager and Mathiesen, 2012) .",

Then, after the Great Depression and the eruption of the Second World War (in Europe 1939-45), there was rapid expansion in international organizations, pulling East and West into dialogue.

The diseases such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) cross all boundaries and natural disasters unite everyone on the plant in the need for emergency preparedness and collaboration. At this time the United Nations is the focus for international learning and the work of the UN in establishing policy frameworks for practice are bearing fruit. An example of this is a simple one: staff at the adolescent refuge in Celje, Slovenia, say that it is a natural part of their work to use the Convention on the Rights of the Child. This contrasts with students in the US who live in one of the last countries in the world that is yet to ratify the Convention on the Rights of the Child.",

The examples cut across all forms of social work intervention. Some of the impact of exchange dialogue is highlighted in the example of the use of the UN Convention on the on the Rights of the Child. Another is the impact of the University of Mona, West Indies on practice with elders in Hartford, following the longstanding exchange with the University of Connecticut, School of Social Work Center for International Social Work. The social workers at the Seattle Adoption Agency may wish they had been more involved in formal social work exchange to avoid their malpractice (Shukovsky, 2003) . This narrative has identified at least four key goals for international exchanges: l to reach beyond the familiar and find new ways of doing familiar things; l to be curious about new cultural norms and in doing so to realize that appreciating the cultural traditions of another does not lessen one's personal identity; l to communicate effectively across cultures and make new friends in distant places of the planet; and l to expand innovations, effective strategies and implementation of international policy instruments in social work practice.",

Student international exchanges represent a key step toward this talking with one another. If social work exchanges continue to build, the next generation will take the new 'Global Agenda' seriously. The Global Agenda combined the work of the International Federation of Social Workers (IFSW), the International Association of Schools of Social Work (IASSW), and the International Council on Social Welfare (ICSW) and was agreed at a conference in Hong Kong in March 2012 (IFSW, 2012) . The agenda includes 'a set of objectives to meet our joint aspirations for social justice and social development' (IFSW, 2012) . The Global Agenda expects students and educators, through their exchanges, to join in communicating and organizing in solidarity with social work practitioners across the world. To be effective as a profession in a globalizing world, we have to seize the moment and build international exchanges.",
