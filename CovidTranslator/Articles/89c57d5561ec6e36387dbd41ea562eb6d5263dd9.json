            "text": "Although deliberate attempts to induce infectious disease among adversaries date back to at least the Roman Empire, concerns about the possible use of microbes by terrorists or by countries with developed biological weapons programs have increased significantly over the past several decades. [1] [2] [3] In the 1990s in response to this growing unease, biological agents of concern were provisionally grouped by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) into three tiered categories (A, B, and C). 4 Tier-specific assignment of an organism was based on several factors, including dissemination or transmissibility characteristics, anticipated associated morbidity and mortality, and/or special preparedness needs, including laboratory preparedness (Table 15-1) . More recently, and complementary to the CDC categories, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), using additional criteria, has developed a systematic framework to assess the risk of a number of organisms. 5 As a result of this assessment, a subset of organisms is deemed to pose a material threat to the national security of the United States (Table 15 -2). 6 The havoc that could be generated by an attack with one of these agents was illustrated in 2001 when a small number of letters containing Bacillus anthracis spores were disseminated via the U.S. postal system. 7 Although only 22 people became ill at five sites in different states, fear and apprehension extended across the country and internationally. [8] [9] [10] There is a general consensus among those who are most knowledgeable of bioterrorism and biological warfare that the potential use of biotechnology for subversive goals poses a serious and growing threat, and that the release of one or more biological agents is inevitable. [11] [12] [13] [14] The release and subsequent spread of a contagious agent such as smallpox virus could prove catastrophic if measures for control are not promptly and effectively applied. Equally serious could be a large-scale release of a highly lethal but nontransmissible agent such as anthrax. The possible use of genetically modified agents offers an additional dimension to the threat. 15 Serious concerns about the potential use of what are commonly referred to as weapons of mass destruction (WMD) arose in the context of the Cold War and focused originally on nuclear weapons and the potential of these to result in the ultimate scenario of a \"nuclear winter. \" 16 Chemical weapons remained on the agenda of concerns given their extensive use during World War I. Concern about biological weapons waned significantly during the 1970s, coincident with President Nixon's initiative in 1969 to terminate the U.S. offensive biological weapons program and the subsequent endorsement by many countries of the 1972 Convention on the Prohibition, Production, and Stockpiling of Bacteriological (Biological) and Toxin Weapons and on their Destruction (usually referred to as the Biological Weapons Convention [BWC] or the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention [BTWC] ). 17, 18 The Convention called for the destruction of all stocks of biological weapons and the cessation of research on their use as offensive agents.",

That biological weapons had been deployed so rarely that precedent would suggest they would not be used; 2. That their use is so morally repugnant that no nation state or organized group would deign to use them; and 3. That it is technologically so difficult to produce organisms in quantity and to disperse them that the science is beyond the reach of any but the most sophisticated laboratories. Each of these arguments has now been shown to be invalid. It is now known that there are nations and dissident groups who have both the motivation and access to skills to cultivate successfully some of the most dangerous pathogens, as well as deploy them as agents in acts of terrorism or war. This was borne out in the anthrax attacks of late 2001 during which letters containing anthrax spores were sent to media and political figures. 7 Methods for transforming biological agents into weapons are publicly available, and the skills and equipment necessary to produce them are modest.",

            "text": "In contrast to the challenges of acquiring functional nuclear weapons, the production of biological weapons is easier and far less expensive. For many of the organisms, production is reasonably straightforward, especially for those with expertise. Those without such expertise can obtain it from the Internet and through academic courses, including sophisticated methods that could be used for genetic engineering of pathogens. Existing or new biomedical production facilities or industries could be converted to the production of microorganisms for bioweapons due to the dual-use nature of manufacturing equipment and supplies. Notably, comparatively little space is required and-for most agents-comparatively small quantities need to be aerosolized to produce large numbers of casualties. For example, in 1999 a small team of scientists without prior training in biological weapons development built a clandestine laboratory in Nevada under a Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) effort to assess whether non-state actors could manufacture biological weapons in the United States using materials purchased on the open market and whether such manufacture could be detected. 20, 21 The scientists produced enough simulated anthrax-without being detected-to kill at least 10,000 people (had they actually produced anthrax spores) with materials purchased on the open market, mostly from a local hardware store, with a budget of less than $1.5 million. 20 Various methods might be used for dispersing biological weapons. The most likely would be direct contamination of food or water supplies and aerosol dispersion. There is a general consensus that aerosols pose the most serious threat. Organisms dispersed by other means could cause disease outbreaks, but they would be much less likely to cause disease on a scale great enough to threaten the integrity of civil government. Each of the organisms of greatest concern could be disseminated in a fine particle aerosol in the range of 1 to 5 microns. Such particles are inhaled and penetrate deeply into the lung. Larger-sized particles, in contrast, are trapped in the upper airways and usually do not succeed in initiating infection. A fine particle aerosol is invisible to the naked eye and behaves much like smoke in that it is able to penetrate most interior air spaces. In the 1979 Sverdlovsk anthrax outbreak, for example, human cases occurred in individuals who were as much as 4 km from the point of purported unintentional release of a spore-contaminated plume from an unfiltered exhaust pipe in a biological weapons production facility; animals who were 50 km away also developed anthrax. 22 Generating an aerosol is comparatively straightforward using any of a number of off-the-shelf devices such as paint sprayers, fogging machines that disseminate insecticides, purse-size perfume atomizers, and hand-held drug delivery devices such as used by asthma patients. Even small releases of an agent would, almost certainly, result in KEYWORDS anthrax; bioterrorism; medical countermeasures; public health preparedness; risk assessment; smallpox; Strategic National Stockpile; threat assessment",

            "text": "In the early part of the 20th century, the advent of microbiology provided the scientific basis for the development of biological weapons and programs began to be developed by some countries, so-called state actors, as part of their warfare armamentarium. For example, Germany instituted a biological weapons program during World War I and conducted attacks of unknown effectiveness against animals (i.e., horses, mules, sheep, cattle) being shipped by neutral countries to the Allies. 30 The use of chemical weapons by both sides of the conflict during World War I was considered appalling and led to the Geneva Protocol for the Prohibition of the Use in War of Asphyxiating, Poisonous or Other Gases and of Bacteriological Methods of Warfare (Geneva Protocol). 31 This treaty was drawn up and signed under the auspices of the League of Nations in 1925 and entered into force in 1928. Although the Geneva Protocol (which has been ratified, acceded to, or succeeded to by 137 State Parties as of March 15, 2013 32 ) banned the use of biological weapons, it did not proscribe the research, production, or possession of biological weapons, and many of the State Parties to the treaty reserved the right to retaliate in kind should they or their allies be attacked. In addition, no provision was made for verification and compliance was voluntary. A number of countries agreeing to the Geneva Protocol began or continued biological weapons programs after becoming treaty signatories. These included Belgium, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Poland, the United Kingdom, and the Soviet Union. 17 The United States did not ratify the Geneva Protocol until 1975 after it had ended its biological weapons program. 25 Despite the list of countries agreeing to the Geneva Protocol, biological weapons are known to have been used during World War II by some who had signed the treaty, including Japan and possibly the Soviet Union. 17 The Japanese biological weapons program was a vast enterprise. It consisted of a major center in Pingfan, Manchuria, termed Unit 731 with more than 3000 scientists plus smaller units at a number of other sites in China. Another center (Unit 100) worked primarily with animal and plant diseases, including glanders, sheep and cattle plague, red rust, and mosaic plant diseases. More than 10,000 prisoners died as a result of experimental infections or execution after experimentation. 25, 33 At least 11 cities in China were attacked during World War II using, variously, anthrax, cholera, Shigella, Salmonella, and plague organisms to contaminate food and water supplies. For example, fleas were infected with plague bacteria and released by aircraft over cities. Data regarding the success of Japan's efforts to infect civilian populations is sketchy. Large outbreaks of cholera and plague are known to have occurred, but it is believed that transmission in any given area was not long sustained. The extent and sophistication of the Japanese program came to be known after the war when Japanese scientists were offered amnesty from war crimes prosecution for the serious public concern as was witnessed during the anthrax release in the United States in 2001. Repeated releases in different parts of the country could be devastating, especially if the public health response were seen as deficient. A large-scale release of agents could be as devastating as a nuclear weapon. For example, a 1993 Office of Technology Assessment report estimated that if 100 kg of anthrax spores were released upwind of Washington, DC, using a crop-duster aircraft, there would be between 130,000 and 3 million deaths. 23 It is clear that preventing the proliferation and use of biological weapons or countering them will be extremely difficult. Detection or interdiction of those intending to use biological weapons is next to impossible. Thus, the first evidence of intent to use such weapons will likely be the appearance of sick people in hospital emergency departments. The rapidity with which those front-line health care workers and others, such as infectious disease specialists and laboratory scientists, can reach a proper diagnosis and the speed with which preventative and/or therapeutic measures are applied could well spell the difference between thousands and, perhaps, tens of thousands of casualties.",

[38] [39] [40] After the establishment of the BWC in 1972, the Soviet Union created a civilian research program called Biopreparat to conduct-under the guise of legitimate research-offensive biological weapons-related research not permitted under the BWC. The program included a system of 18 research laboratories and centers employing up to approximately 60,000 staff at its height. One of the larger and more sophisticated of its facilities, the Vector State Research Center of Virology and Biotechnology, referred to as VECTOR, was a 4000person, 30-building complex with high-security biological facilities for laboratories and isolation of human cases. It was at VECTOR where, during the 1980s, the technical problems were solved for the largescale production of smallpox virus intended to be used as an offensive weapon.",

Examples of human disease-associated organisms or toxins that were weaponized and stockpiled include B. anthracis; botulinum toxins; Francisella tularensis; Brucella suis; Coxiella burnetii; staphylococcal enterotoxin B; and Venezuelan equine encephalitis. In conjunction with these activities, medical countermeasures were developed, including vaccines and antibiotics, to protect scientists and military personnel; technical advances were made that permitted large-scale fermentation and storage of agents. Studies of animal responses to infection were conducted at Fort Detrick, in atolls in the Pacific, and at desert sites in the United States. Experiments using aerosolized simulant organisms were conducted in a number of cities to study survival time of organisms and patterns of dispersal. 34 Over time there was increasing international concern that the Geneva Protocol did not ban the research, production, or possession of biological weapons and lacked the means to verify adherence by signatory countries. Accordingly, in 1969, draft proposals for a new protocol were submitted to the Committee on Disarmament of the United Nations. 17 Meanwhile, President Nixon unilaterally terminated the U.S. offensive biological weapons program in 1969 by National Security Decision Memorandum (NSDM) 35, followed by the toxin weapons program in 1970 by NSDM 44. 35, 36 Then in 1972, the Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production and Stockpiling of Bacteriological and Toxin Weapons and on their Destruction-commonly referred to as the Biological Weapons Convention or the BWC-was opened for signature. 18 State Parties to the BWC-which entered into force in 1975-are obligated to not develop, Although there were no deaths among the 751 persons who became ill, 45 were hospitalized. 49 The public health investigation of this incident initially failed to determine how the salad bars became contaminated. It was not until 1 year after the outbreak that dissension among the perpetrators led law enforcement officials to discover the contamination was deliberate with the ultimate goal of disrupting a local election. 2 This episode illustrates the difficulty in differentiating an ordinary foodborne outbreak from a small-scale biological weapons attack conducted by non-state actors.",

A lengthy investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the U.S. Postal Inspection Service, other law enforcement agencies, and federal prosecutors from the District of Columbia and the Justice Department's Counterterrorism Section determined that the late Dr. Bruce Ivins acted alone in planning and executing the 2001 anthrax attack. 50 A review of the scientific approaches used in the investigation was conducted by a committee of the National Research Council (at the request of the FBI). It determined, among other things, that the available scientific evidence was insufficient to reach a definitive conclusion as to the origins of the anthrax spores used in the attack, leading some to continue to question whether Dr. Ivins was the culprit. 51, 52 In response to increasing concerns regarding the risk that non-state actors might acquire and use biological, chemical, and nuclear weapons and the fact that the BWC does not explicitly address non-state actors, U.N. Security Council Resolution 1540 was appended to Chapter VII of the U.N. Charter by unanimous vote on April 28, 2004 . 53 Chapter VII sets out the U.N. Security Council's powers to maintain peace. Resolution 1540 adds the requirement that all member states develop laws with regulatory enforcement measures aimed at preventing the creation, proliferation, delivery, and spread of chemical, biological, and nuclear weapons by non-state actors. The desired intended outcome is to reduce the threat of non-state actors gaining access to and disseminating these weapons. The objectives of this Resolution were reiterated, and the mandate was extended under U.N. Security Council Resolutions 1673, 1810, and 1977 with the 1540 Committee mandate extended to 2021 to ensure full implementation of the original resolution through capacity building and technical assistance. 54 ",

Determining how to focus limited resources is a key to such efforts. Two critical elements are used to assess and estimate which biological organisms are of greatest concern: threat assessment and risk assessment. Threat assessment is the process of assessing the likelihood that a particular intentional hazard will occur by estimating potential adversaries' capabilities and intentions. 55 This is a particularly difficult task with respect to biological weapons. Potential adversaries pursuing a biological weapons capability encompass a diffuse set of state and nonstate entities (e.g., terrorist groups, criminal networks, individuals), which are difficult to identify and gather information on. 56 To achieve a tactical and strategic advantage, potential adversaries strive to maintain secrecy, making it difficult to gain insight into their specific intentions and capabilities. In addition, it is extremely difficult to differentiate biological weapons research and development from legitimate research and development efforts. These factors make it difficult to develop threat assessments that are accurate and actionable. In addition, the biological weapons threat continually evolves as a result of advances in science and technology and as a result of adversaries adjusting their strategies and tactics in response to a nation's perceived vulnerabilities. Accordingly, there are substantial difficulties in identifying potential aggressors, let alone estimating their intentions and capabilities.",

Risk is the potential for an unwanted outcome from an incident, event, or occurrence, as determined by its likelihood and the associated consequences. 55 In the United States, the Another facility of concern was the Soviet Union's principal production center for smallpox virus located near Moscow, at Sergiev Posad. It was reportedly able to produce upwards of 20 tons of smallpox virus annually, primarily for delivery via intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) as a strategic weapon. 39 Currently, the site houses the Russian Federation's Ministry of Defense Microbiology Scientific Research Institute, a laboratory research complex known to maintain a national collection of dangerous pathogens, including Ebola, Marburg, and Lassa viruses. 42 In 1992, Russian officials confirmed the existence of a biological weapons program it had inherited from the Soviet Union and committed to dismantling it. 43 The dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991 and the halting of the inherited Soviet offensive biological weapons program by Russian President Yeltsin in 1992 resulted in profound reductions in Biopreparat funding and personnel raising concerns that former biological weapons scientists may sell the expertise to states or groups seeking such knowledge. 44 In 2000 it was estimated that approximately 15,000 Biopreparat scientists remained employed within the system, which could pose a proliferation risk. 45 Another example that illustrates the challenges of verifying compliance to the BWC is the case of Iraq, which signed the BWC in 1972. After the first Gulf War (Operation Desert Storm) in 1991, U.N. Security Council Resolution 687 established, among other things, the U.N. Special Commission (UNSCOM) to carry out on-site inspections of Iraq's biological, chemical, and missile capabilities and to oversee their destruction, removal, or procedures to render them harmless. 46 In April 1991 under its initial declaration (as required under U.N. Resolution 687), Iraq declared that it did not have a biological weapons program and in August 1991 declared to the first biological weapons inspection team only that it had conducted \"biological research activities for defensive military purposes. \" 47 It was not until July 1995, after 4 years of UNSCOM investigations and \"in the light of irrefutable evidence\" that Iraq admitted for the first time that it had an offensive biological weapons program. 47 However, Iraq initially denied weaponization. It took a defector to begin to uncover the full extent of the Iraqi program. In August 1995 General Hussein Kamel, who had responsibility for all of Iraq's weapons programs, defected to Jordan and began cooperating with UNSCOM. Subsequently, Iraq admitted to \"a far more extensive biological warfare programme\" than previously admitted including weaponization. \" 47 U.N. Resolution 687 invited Iraq to ratify the BWC, which it did in 1991. 48 Verifying adherence to the BWC remains a challenge. A 2011 assessment by the U.S. Department of State found that China, Iran, and Russia-all State Parties to the BWC-engaged in biological research activities in 2011 with potential dual-use applications; however, available information did not establish that any of these countries is engaged in activities prohibited by the BWC. 43 In addition, it remains unclear if Russia has fulfilled its obligations under the BWC with respect to the items specified in Article I of the BWC that it inherited from the former Soviet Union. Furthermore, the State Department noted that the United States has judged that North Korea-also a State Party to the BWC-might still consider the use of biological weapons an option and continues to develop its research and development capabilities without declaring relevant developments as part of the BWC confidence-building measures. Finally, the State Department noted the United States' concern that Syria-a signatory but not State Party to the BWC-may be engaged in activities that would violate its obligations under the BWC if it were a State Party.",

Some of the funds were used in 1999 to create a laboratory network, under the direction of the CDC, to provide laboratory surge capacity, emergency assistance, and support to state and local public health laboratories for the identification of biological threat agents and later chemical threats.

Ideally, early identification of a biological attack could come from sensitive and specific pattern recognition of illnesses or a surveillance system for identification of environmental pathogens. However, an effective system does not currently exist. This means that early detection of a biological attack will primarily rely on front-line clinicians and laboratorians. In the United States, federal, state, tribal, and territorial governments, as well as many health care systems, have taken steps to improve surveillance capabilities to detect unusual biological outbreaks and cases. And in recent years, improved surveillance systems at the international, national, and local levelsincluding an improved network of public health laboratories-have enabled the detection of outbreaks of novel infectious diseases with an exceedingly small number of cases. 72 Despite these improvements, it is still highly likely that the first identification of a biological attack will be the diagnosis of patients by an astute clinician. Clinically suspect cases require prompt laboratory confirmation, which is an essential step for any public health response. Thus, through a variety of educational approaches and training programs, emphasis has been placed on assuring that clinicians, particularly emergency medicine and infectious disease specialists, are knowledgeable of biological agents of greatest concern, know of the importance of prompt reporting to public health officials, and have access to laboratories that are prepared to provide rapid disease diagnosis.",

The effects of the latter are readily apparent, allowing early approximations to be made as to the geographic extent of the problem and the number and nature of casualties to be expected. Needed response efforts can thus be gauged and initiated immediately. For biological weapons, however, the incubation period of biological agents means there is an inherent delay from the time a covert attack is launched until the realization that an attack has occurred-most likely by the identification of sick patients. The varying incubation periods of the disease inevitably mean a delay in gauging the magnitude and scope of the attack and deploying appropriate response efforts on the basis of the epidemiology of the ensuing outbreak. However, the epidemiology of a disease outbreak from a biological attack can differ greatly from a natural disease outbreak, which can complicate event investigation and response efforts. For example, simultaneous attacks with an aerosolized biological agent in several locations could generate a large, complex geographic distribution of cases complicating efforts to develop an epidemic curve. In addition, exposure to a large inoculum of aerosolized biological agents could result in atypical disease presentations and clinical courses (e.g., shorter incubation periods, compressed and severe disease course). Furthermore, on the basis of experiences after the anthrax attacks, it is to be expected that there will be widespread apprehension, fear, and concern about the possibility of further cases-either from the spread of a contagious agent and/or from sequential attacks. Many may live in fear that they or their families will be the next victims. Experience shows that this inevitably complicates event investigation and response efforts. 8, 9, 74, 75 For example, in the 2001 anthrax attack it was not until more than 2 weeks after the initial anthrax-laden letters were sent through the U.S. Postal Service that the index case was diagnosed and state, and local levels, exercises are being conducted to test response systems to determine how well they are actually functioning.",

Since 2002 the CDC has provided nearly $9 billion to public health departments across the United States for preparedness under the PHEP Cooperative Agreement. In 2011 the CDC issued a set of 15 public health preparedness capabilities to assist state and local planners in identifying preparedness gaps, determining priorities, and developing plans for improving capabilities that align with national priorities. 81 In 2004 the CDC created the Cities Readiness Initiative (CRI) as part of the PHEP Cooperative Agreement. 82 The initiative initially sought to assist 21 major cities to develop plans to rapidly receive, distribute, and dispense medical countermeasures within 48 hours from the National Stockpile in the event of a large-scale public health emergency. The program was expanded to 72 metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) encompassing 57% of the U.S. population with at least one MSA in each state. Each jurisdiction is assessed on its medical countermeasure distribution and dispensing capabilities; only 13 (18.8%) of the jurisdictions were in the unacceptable range in the period 2008-2009.",

            "text": "A major challenge to public health officials is that of instituting necessary measures to avoid panic in the face of an epidemic of a traditionally feared disease. Reviews of past epidemics indicate that the most essential factor is effective leadership and competent, frequent, and open communication with the public, the press, professionals, and others concerned in dealing with the epidemic. This is an area that is too often neglected. The 2001 anthrax outbreak illustrated the problems resulting from inadequate lines of communication. 83 Health departments at all levels were overwhelmed by requests for information from the public, from health professionals, and especially from the media. None had experienced an epidemic threat such as this, and none were prepared. Frequent, authoritative, up-to-date reports through the media to the public proved absolutely vital, but it took time before a pattern for these became established. The need for communication between and among professionals was clear, and this is now being addressed in part by the national Health Alert Network, which is financed by federal preparedness funds. 84 It was also apparent that command centers were required to coordinate and direct operations and to facilitate the flow of information, but these took time to become established and to begin to function well. Sophisticated centers are now in place in the Secretary's Office at HHS, the CDC, and in many states and cities; they are now staffed on a 24-hour-per-day, 7-day-per-week schedule. Information and education materials have been prepared with respect to Category A diseases and are available throughout the health system. Of importance is the fact that at federal, In 2009 the Institute of Medicine constituted a committee to develop guidance for health care systems to establish and implement standards of care during disasters when resources were severely constrained. 98 The committee defined \"crisis standards of care\" as a state where \"a substantial change in health care operations and the level of care that can be delivered in a public health emergency is justified by specific circumstances. \" 98 The committee also developed templates to guide the efforts of professionals and organizations responsible for disaster planning and implementation and emphasized the need for integrated planning for a coordinated response with public health systems. In 2012, a survey of acute care hospitals determined that more than 94% of hospitals participated in a discrete entity, partnership, organization, coalition, planning group, consortium, or other agreement with other hospitals and community partners for emergency preparedness and response. 99 The difficulties of sharing health care providers licensed in one state but not another was highlighted after the events of September 2001. In response, a mandated federal system of guidelines and standards was created to register, credential, and allow deployment of medical professionals across state jurisdictions in the event of a large-scale national emergency. The state-based system, called the Emergency System for Advance Registration of Volunteer Health Professionals, is implemented at the state level with federal assistance, initially from HRSA and, since December 2006, from ASPR. 100 In the event of a large bioterrorist incident requiring supplementation of clinical response efforts, both the National Disaster Medical System (NDMS) and the Medical Reserve Corps (MRC) can be activated. 101,102 NDMS, a system coordinated by HHS, acts to temporarily supplement state and local medical care needs after a disaster of any kind. NDMS can provide personnel, supplies, equipment at the site or at definitive care sites in unaffected areas, and patient care movement. Disaster medical assistance teams (DMATs) are local units activated for 2-week deployments with sufficient supplies and equipment to be selfsustaining for at least 72 hours before resupply is necessary. In the event of a national disaster, DMATs may be moved from their local area, at which time they are made federal employees with medical credentials recognized in all states and protected under the Federal Tort Claims Act against any malpractice claim. Predisaster employment is protected under the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act. The MRC was created in 2002 as community-based and locally organized groups of health care volunteers who donate their time and expertise to prepare for and respond to existing emergency medical and public health resources when needed. There are more than 300 units in the United States. Units have been active, for example, in providing services after hurricanes. The Office of Surgeon General acts as a clearinghouse for information and best practices in establishing and maintaining MRC units. Liability protection for individual MRC practitioners is determined by each state.",

Its goal is to rapidly detect the presence of any of a targeted number of aerosolized biological agents. The original system, first deployed in 2003, used multiple air samplers in each city. In 2005 the system was expanded to increase outdoor air sampling in each city and to add indoor facility monitoring. The estimated 10-year cost of the current system is $0.6 billion with an annualized cost of $80 million. A proposed expansion of the program to include more cities with more detection devices per city would increase the annualized cost to $200 million. 95 Although the system has not reported any false-positive results, it has had several \"BioWatch Actionable Results\" due to detection of airborne, naturally occurring DNA in the environment. Such identification, if declared before further information was known, could have caused considerable public concern. Illustrative of the problem was an event in October 2003 when two air monitors in Houston, Texas, detected the presence of tularemia on 2 consecutive days. Area hospitals and infectious disease specialists were warned about the possibility that a release had taken place, but authorities refrained from taking more definitive action, such as the mass community-wide distribution of antibiotics.",

Routine smallpox vaccination had stopped in 1972 coincident with progress in the smallpox eradication program and a decreasing risk of importation of the disease. Only 15 million doses of smallpox vaccine remained in storage. It had been produced in 1978. This amount was woefully insufficient to cope with epidemic smallpox should the virus be released. The old vaccine had been a crude preparation produced on the skin of calves and would not meet the standards of a contemporary vaccine. After the 1980 declaration that smallpox had been eradicated, vaccination stopped everywhere and all production facilities were dismantled or converted to other uses. It was estimated then that 5 to 8 years would be required, after traditional vaccine development protocols, to develop, produce, and license a new vaccine, grown, as are contemporary vaccines, in tissue cell culture. The pathway from discovery through development, production, and final FDA approval of a new product is costly, as well as time consuming, with a price tag estimated to be between $800 million and $1.2 billion. 104 The perceived need for enough smallpox vaccine for the nation led HHS in the autumn of 2001 to set the goal of securing-as soon as possible-sufficient vaccine for every American. In less than 18 months, the vaccine had been produced and tested for antigenicity and was delivered to the Strategic National Stockpile ready for use as an investigational new drug in the event of an emergency. However, it was recognized that under emergency conditions, it would be impossible to fulfill the formal requirements to satisfy an Investigational New Drug application. Accordingly, plans were made for the vaccine to be used before licensure when authorized by the HHS Secretary under an Emergency Use Authorization. Licensure was granted by the FDA on August 31, 2007. 105 Having the vaccine was not enough. Definitive planning and training by state, city, and regional authorities were requisite if large-scale vaccination programs were to be conducted. Such preparations are still lacking as the nation's response to the influenza A/H1N1 pandemic in 2009-2010 highlighted. For example, despite more than 8 years of preparatory work, the public health response in providing timely access to vaccines and antiviral products would be unacceptable faced with a smallpox epidemic challenge.",

The Board was tasked with reviewing, assessing the impact, and recommending the most appropriate course of action regarding the unpublished manuscripts. After much deliberation, the Board recommended that the manuscripts be revised to not include the methodological details that could enable replication of the experiment by those who would seek to do harm. HHS provided the Board's nonbinding recommendations to the study authors and journal editors. 126 As a result, the original manuscripts were revised accordingly. After further careful deliberation, the Board recommended the publication of both revised manuscripts, noting that the data described in the revised manuscripts do not appear to be directly enabling and no longer posed an immediate threat to public health or national security. 127 In light of the H5N1 controversy, the Board recommended that the federal government develop an oversight policy that would augment existing approaches to evaluating research that has the potential to be misused for harmful purposes.

For example, knowing precisely which gene of an organism causes damage and how it acts may permit a highly targeted vaccine or drug, but at the same time it identifies a gene that if inserted into another organism could potentially produce a devastating effect.",

In the United States, it is a federal crime to knowingly develop, produce, stockpile, transfer, acquire, retain, or possess any biological agent, toxin, or delivery system for use as a weapon or knowingly assist a foreign state or any organization to do so and to knowingly possess any biological agent, toxin, or delivery system that is not reasonably justified by a prophylactic, protective, bona fide research, or other peaceful purpose. 119 In addition to criminal penalties related to the development, possession, or use of biological weapons, the United States employs a number of programs to prevent or limit access to the materials, information, and knowledge that could be used to create a biological weapon. For example, the U.S. Department of Commerce enforces export controls over certain biological agents, toxins, and dual-use equipment and technologies. 120 In addition, HHS and the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) maintain a list of select biological agents and toxins that could threaten public health and safety and are subject to regulations regarding their possession, use, and transfer. 121 Under the Select Agent Program all persons possessing, using, or transferring select agents are required to register with HHS or USDA as appropriate and to meet established biosafety and security standards and procedures. The possession, transport, and receipt of select agents is prohibited by restricted persons, including individuals under indictment for or convicted of a crime punishable by imprisonment for more than 1 year; foreign nationals from countries determined by the Secretary of State to repeatedly supply support for acts of international terrorism; individuals dishonorably discharged from the U.S. Armed Services; individuals adjudicated as a mental defective or who have been committed to any mental institution; and unlawful users of controlled substances.",

Some laboratories have had to abandon or forego studies on these threat agents simply because of the security requirements related to undertaking such research. The costs of registering and policing compliance are likewise substantial. More salient is the question of what efficacy these procedures may have in deterrence, recognizing that few other nations have implemented measures that are, in any way, comparable.",

Further, State Parties should destroy or divert to peaceful purposes all agents, toxins, weapons, equipment, and means of delivery and not transfer to any recipient or in any way assist, encourage, or induce to manufacture or otherwise acquire biological agents, toxins, weapons, equipment, or means of delivery.The BWC-which has 169 State Parties 37 -has no formal verification protocol to monitor compliance. Accordingly, verifying adherence to and compliance with the BWC by State Parties has proven challenging. For example, the Soviet Union became a State Party to the BWC in 1975. However, in the late 1980s and early 1990s serious concerns arose regarding the biological weapons capability of the Soviet Union.",
