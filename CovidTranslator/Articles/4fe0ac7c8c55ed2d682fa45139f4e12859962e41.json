Further, the lessons learned from the response to this outbreak may help to improve current strategies for preventing outbreaks of infectious diseases and for distributing resources efficiently during response operations.",

Taiwan, with its close proximity to the SARS epicenters of Guangdong and Hong Kong, and its extensive business and cultural ties, has many travellers from the most affected areas. Each year more than four million Taiwanese visit mainland China for business and tourism (Bureau of Immigration Ministry of the Interior) and the vast majority of flights return through Hong Kong. Although Taiwan was removed from the list of affected areas on 5 July 2003, it will remain at risk from the importation and spread of SARS should it re-emerge. 3, 6 Methods Surveillance On 14 March 2003 , the day the first cases were reported, Taiwan's Department of Health initiated a system to respond to the potential spread of SARS resulting from the cases. A Task Force Committee established medical aid teams to address disruption in the quarantine system; to conduct rapid assessment by reviewing every reported SARS case within three days after the first case was reported; and to implement a legislative procedure for reporting SARS on 28 March. All suspected SARS cases were required by law to be reported to the Department of Health, and health authorities were required to deliver protective equipment including N-95 masks to the SARS hospitals immediately and to equip all healthcare workers with enhanced protective equipment.",

Travellers in this category were allowed to conduct business if they wore a surgical mask. Public health nurses from local health departments delivered food to the home three times a day. Body temperature was self-monitored three times a day and reported by telephone to the public health nurses. A surgical mask was worn whenever the quarantined individual entered a communal area within their own home.

The man was a 54-year-old businessman who had travelled to Guangdong Province, China, on 5 February and returned to Taipei via Hong Kong on 21 February. On 25 February he developed fever and myalgia, and later a dry cough, but was not hospitalized until 8 March. Several hours after admission he was intubated and required mechanical ventilation for 13 days. His wife and son were exposed during the period before full protective measures were in place, and both developed SARS with a requirement for mechanical ventilation. The infections in the wife and son were confirmed by RT-PCR testing to be associated with the novel coronavirus associated with SARS worldwide. 12 Suddenly, in the last ten days of April, the number of cases began to increase steadily. The first increase was in patients and staff at Hospital H and was attributed to a laundry worker employed at the hospital, aged 42 years with diabetes mellitus and peripheral vascular disease. On 12 April he had a fever and diarrhea and was evaluated in the emergency department. The laundry worker remained on duty and interacted frequently with patients, staff, and visitors. He had sleeping quarters in the hospital's basement and spent off-duty time socializing in the emergency department. On 16 April, because of worsening symptoms, this worker was admitted to the hospital with a diagnosis of salmonellosis (infectious enteritis) and pulmonary edema. On 18 April he became short of breath. A chest radiograph showed bilateral infiltrates, and the patient was transferred to an isolation room in the intensive care unit with suspected SARS. This was a potential index patient because he had been symptomatic for six days before SARS was diagnosed. The number of potentially exposed persons was estimated at up to 10,000 patients and visitors, and 930 staff. On 24 April Hospital H was contained, and all patients, visitors, and staff were quarantined within the building. 15 During the period from 29 April to 14 June, a total of 151 SARS patients were transferred to 11 hospitals (mainly eight hospitals in Taipei city).",

            "text": "In this study, a substantial difference was documented in both the number of cases and the mortality rate after applying the WHO definition proposed in August 2003. It is important to note that the later definition, published after the outbreak was over, was developed to serve a different purpose. In May 2003, the case definition focused on the clinical picture, and was deliberately sensitive in order to identify most suspected cases and implement control measures for SARS. The case definition in August was modified to increase specificity by focusing on laboratory confirmed cases. In addition, the new definition allows for the calculation of a low mortality mainly by permitting deaths in SARS patients to be attributed to other underlying diseases and therefore not contribute to the numerator. Including SARS patients regardless of etiology would prevent subjectivity and provide more uniform data for comparison across countries. Quarantining the contacts is a new challenge to the public. Within this period between 28 March and 30 July, a total of 151,270 persons (0.7% of the population of Taiwan) were quarantined. Only 46 (class A, 34; class B, 12) were subsequently classified as probable cases. In humans infected with the virus there is a wide range of reported incubation periods, from five to 15 days, before patients become symptomatic. 18, 19 This lag time allows apparently healthy people to travel by air almost anywhere in the world after they have been exposed. Once they become symptomatic, the disease is most likely spread through person-to-person transmission. 24 As expected, based on the known transmission patterns for SARS, 19, 20 the fact that transmission appeared to occur from patients in the symptomatic phase of illness, but not from those who were in the pre-symptomatic phase, suggests that the risk of transmission varies by the phase of illness. It is likely that persons who were in contact with patients with the pre-symptomatic phase were at low risk. The fact that transmission has been limited to only close contacts of patients, such as healthcare workers and family members who were not using contact or respiratory precautions, suggests that either droplet secretions or direct contact probably played a role. 4 SARS patients should limit interactions outside the home and should not go to work, school, out-of-home childcare or other public areas until ten days after the resolution of fever. In Taiwan, family and other close contacts, those on airplanes with ill SARS patients (if seated within three rows in front or three rows behind the patient), and those returning from SARS affected areas were given strictly compulsory home quarantine for ten days. It must be considered whether in the future household members or other close contacts of SARS patients need to limit their activities outside the home as recommended by the USA CDC. 25 Epidemiologic investigation and laboratory studies suggest that most patients with illnesses meeting the case definition of SARS in Taiwan were linked to a common source. To date, 37.5% of cases identified in this report were confirmed positive.",

The decrease in worldwide incidence is gratifying; but it may simply reflect the seasonal variation in the transmission of the virus. 24 Some experts have predicted the return of SARS in the cool season. Containing an outbreak at an early stage affords a greater chance of success than does a later response and clearly puts less strain on the healthcare system. Future strategies to control the spread of SARS need to emphasize the greater risk to certain populations: health care workers, older people, and people who have chronic diseases.
