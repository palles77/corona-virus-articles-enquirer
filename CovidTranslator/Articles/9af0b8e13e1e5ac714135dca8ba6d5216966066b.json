            "text": "Intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) challenge the well-established sequence-structurefunction paradigm for describing protein function and evolution. Here, we direct a combination of biophysical and cellular studies to further our understanding of how the intrinsically disordered C-terminal tail of FtsZ contributes to cell division in rod-shaped bacteria. FtsZ is a modular protein that encompasses a conserved GTPase domain and a highly variable intrinsically disordered C-terminal tail (CTT). The CTT is essential for forming the cytokinetic Z-ring. Despite poor sequence conservation of the CTT, the patterning of oppositely charged residues, which refers to the extent of linear mixing / segregation of oppositely charged residues within CTT sequences is bounded within a narrow range. To assess the impact of evolutionary bounds on charge patterning within CTT sequences we performed experiments, aided by sequence design, to quantify the impact of changing the patterning of oppositely charged residues within the CTT on the functions of FtsZ from B. subtilis. Z-ring formation is robust if and only if the extent of linear mixing / segregation of oppositely charged residues within the CTT sequences is within evolutionarily observed bounds. Otherwise, aberrant, CTT-mediated, FtsZ assemblies impair Zring formation. The complexities of CTT sequences also have to be above a threshold value because FtsZ variants with low complexity CTTs are not tolerated in cells. Taken together, our results suggest that CTT sequences have evolved to be \"just right\" and that this is achieved through an optimal extent of charge patterning while maintaining the sequence complexity above a threshold value.",

            "text": "Intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) feature prominently in eukaryotic proteins (Dunker et al., 2002a; van der Lee et al., 2014) . These regions are associated with a range of molecular functions that contribute to an assortment of cellular processes (Dunker et al., 2002b; Iakoucheva et al., 2002; Iakoucheva et al., 2004; Wright and Dyson, 2015) . IDRs and intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) defy the well-established sequence-structure-function paradigm that provides a coherent framework for connecting sequence-encoded information to molecular functions for proteins that fold into well-defined three-dimensional structures (Babu, 2016) . This is because conformational heterogeneity is a defining hallmark of IDRs / IDPs (Babu et al., 2012; Forman-Kay and Mittag, 2013; Lyle et al., 2013; Wright and Dyson, 2015) . Despite this sequence-intrinsic conformational heterogeneity it has become clear that IDRs and IDPs have definable sequence-to-conformation relationships (Das et al., 2015; Forman-Kay and Mittag, 2013; Gibbs and Showalter, 2016) . The overall sizes, shapes, and amplitudes of conformational fluctuations of IDRs / IDPs are governed by compositional parameters such as the fraction of charged residues and the overall proline contents (Hofmann et al., 2012; Holehouse et al., 2017; Mao et al., 2013; Muller-Spath et al., 2010) . Additional contributions to sequence-to-conformation relationships include the linear patterning of oppositely charged residues as well as the linear patterning of proline and charged residues Martin et al., 2016) .",

This view has emerged from bioinformatics analysis, which shows that only a small percentage of bacterial proteins include long IDRs (Brown et al., 2011; Chen et al., 2006; Yruela et al., 2017) . The apparent bias against IDRs / IDPs in bacterial proteomes has been ascribed to a variety of factors. These include shorter protein lengths, the importance of well-defined structure in metabolic enzymes, and the purportedly focused / limited repertoire of functions associated with bacterial proteins (Brown et al., 2010; Dunker et al., 2001; Yruela et al., 2017) .",

These findings raise a key dimerization step and the elongation of polymers (Caplan and Erickson, 2003; Romberg et al., 2001) . Filaments can associate laterally with one another to form bundles (Gonzalez et al., 2005; Romberg and Levin, 2003) . GTP hydrolysis promotes the bending of laterally associated polymers to form wreath-like structures that vary in thickness around the circumference (den Blaauwen et al., 2017) .",

            "text": "We propose that clues to the observed complexities and regulation of FtsZ assembly come from the distinctive protein architecture, which include modules other than the GTPase domain ( Figure 1A) . The modular architecture of FtsZ encompasses a folded N-terminal core domain that forms an active GTP hydrolysis site upon dimerization. The negatively charged core includes the GTP binding site and the coordinating T7 loop. The interface between the nucleotide binding site and the T7 loop (in dimers and higher order polymers) forms the active site for GTP hydrolysis (Oliva et al., 2007) . The C-terminal stretch of FtsZ includes an intrinsically disordered linker (CTL), a 17-residue C-terminal peptide (CTP), and 7-10 residue stretch that is rich in basic residues and has been designated as the C-terminal variable region or CTV Levin, 2012, 2013; Buske et al., 2015) . The CTP is an alpha-helical 7 molecular recognition element (Oldfield et al., 2005) that coordinates heterotypic protein-protein interactions involving FtsZ. The interaction partners that engage with FtsZ through the CTP include the protein FtsA, which assists in the bundling of FtsZ protofilaments and anchoring of Z-rings to bacterial membranes, and SepF, which is required for the late stages of cell division (Adams and Errington, 2009) . Depending on its charge, the CTV can play a significant role in mediating lateral interactions between FtsZ polymers in vitro and in determining the integrity of the FtsZ ring in vivo (Buske and Levin, 2012) .",

In contrast, replacing the CTL with a rigid alpha-helical domain from human betacatenin yielded diffuse FtsZ puncta that compromise Z-ring formation and cell division (Buske and Levin, 2013) . This work underscored the importance of the disordered CTL in FtsZ assembly and Z-ring formation. It also raised several questions regarding the contribution of the intrinsically disordered CTL to the assortment of functions coordinated by FtsZ.

In polyampholytic IDRs, oppositely charged residues can be separated into distinct blocks or they can be uniformly mixed along the sequence ( Figure 1B) . The linear mixing / segregation of oppositely charged residues can be quantified using different parameters Sawle and Ghosh, 2015; Sawle et al., 2017) . The one we use here is designated as \u03ba, where 0 \u2264 \u03ba \u2264 1 . If oppositely charged residues are well mixed, then the sequence will have low \u03ba-values. In contrast, separation of oppositely charged residues into discrete blocks within the linear sequence leads to higher values of \u03ba. In well-mixed sequences, preferential solvation of charged residues combined with a counterbalancing of intra-chain electrostatic repulsions and attractions will promote chain expansion. Increased linear segregation of oppositely charged residues causes systematic compaction of IDRs leading to smaller values for radii of gyration, more spherical shapes for individual molecules, and decreased amplitudes of global conformational fluctuations ( Figure   1B) .",

The expected distribution of \u03ba values for randomly shuffled sequences that are constrained to have the CTT composition of B. subtilis FtsZ is shifted to lower values when compared to the actual \u03ba values observed for the 1209 orthologous sequences ( Figure S2 ). However, when compared to the shuffled sequences generated in the absence of any selective pressure, many sequences with higher \u03ba values are found, although very few naturally occurring sequences have a \u03ba value above 0.4. This suggests that there is an evolutionary pressure against CTT sequences with \u03ba values that go above 0.4. Similarly, there appears to be a selection pressure against sequences with \u03ba values lower than 0.15.",

We used the ABSINTH implicit solvation model and forcefield paradigm (Vitalis and Pappu, 2009a; Vitalis and Pappu, 2009b) for these simulations. The results were used to quantify the impact of charge patterning on the overall sizes, shapes, and amplitudes of conformational fluctuations of CTT sequences modeled as autonomous units. As \u03ba increases, there is a clear trend toward compaction. We quantified the preference for compact structures in terms of the length normalized mean radii of gyration R g n that are plotted for the WT CTT and designed variants ( Figure 2C ). For each variant, R g n is calculated as the mean R g value of the variant divided by the square root of the number of residues n in the CTT. Variants of the B. subtilis CTT sequence with \u03ba values that are lower than the WT are slightly more expanded than the WT CTT, although the degree of expansion is not statistically significant. However, sequences with \u03ba values that are higher than the WT become increasingly more compact with increasing \u03ba.

Like WT, we observed a canonical dependence of light scattering intensity on monovalent salt ( Figure 4D ). At high salt, the interactions that hold the bundles together are screened and CTLV4 forms unbundled polymers that are similar to those formed by WT FtsZ (Figure 4E ). Simulations predict the CTT of CTLV4 is 10% smaller than the WT CTT ( Figure 2C ). Compaction is mediated by increased electrostatic interactions between charged blocks on the CTT sequence. While the simulations illustrate charge-dependent intramolecular interactions, these interactions could also occur in an intermolecular fashion. Concordant with this expectation, we observed a two-fold increase in the peak scattering intensity in the presence of 50 mM KCl for the CTLV4 variant when compared to the WT FtsZ ( Figure 4F ). This increase in scattering intensity derives from two distinct features as revealed by negative stain EM images ( Figure 4E) . When compared to the WT FtsZ, CTLV4 forms longer polymers that become part of thicker bundles in the presence of low salt. Figure   4F shows a comparison of the relative strengths of filament / polymer bundling by comparing the maximum scattering intensities measured for the WT versus CTLV4 in the presence of three different concentrations of KCl.

            "text": "To further assess the robustness of altering charge patterning within evolutionarily observed bounds (Figure 1D) , we quantified the comparative efficiencies of GTP hydrolysis of FtsZ variants. Figure 4G shows results from measurements that compare the efficiencies of WT FtsZ to those for CTLV4 and \u2206CTT. The latter is a variant of FtsZ that lacks the CTT. The efficiency of GTP hydrolysis remains unchanged for CTLV4 when compared to the WT FtsZ ( Figure 4G ). Higher-order assembly, such as protofilament bundling and Z-ring formation, are compromised for \u2206CTT (Buske and Levin, 2013; Sundararajan and Goley, 2017; Sundararajan et al., 2015) and we do not observe a measurable increase in light scattering that is distinguishable from the background. Despite this, we find that \u2206CTT is much more efficient as a GTPase with an enzymatic activity that is ~3 times higher than the WT or CTLV4. Taken together with the observation that GTP hydrolysis promotes the severing of protofilaments (Mukherjee and Lutkenhaus, 1998) our data suggest that \u2206CTT, as a result of being unencumbered by the absence of the CTT, is able to bind GTP, polymerize, hydrolyze GTP, disassemble and repeat the cycle in an extremely efficient manner. Accordingly, we propose that the CTT, which is essential for Z-ring formation, promotes FtsZ assembly and this suppresses GTPase activity. This suppression could arise from steric effects of the CTT, a reduction in subunit turnover, and possible protofilament stabilization through interactions with neighboring filaments mediated by the CTT.",

Surprisingly, even in the absence of GTP, CTLV5 forms discernible assemblies that persist at high salt concentrations ( Figure   5C ). This behavior is distinct from what we observe for WT FtsZ and CTLV4. The assemblies formed by CTLV5 in the absence of GTP are spherical aggregates that are roughly 20 nm in diameter ( Figure 5D ). Interestingly, light scattering from these assemblies that form in the absence of GTP, increases with increased salt concentration. Relative CTLV5 light scattering magnitudes for different buffer conditions are shown in Figure 5E . The increased assembly size in high salt might derive from a weakening of electrostatic repulsions amongst the surfaces of assemblies. This is clearly a CTT-mediated phenomenon given that we do not observe these assemblies for the wild-type FtsZ or for variants with lower degrees of charge segregation within their CTTs.",

In eukaryotic systems, ubiquitinated substrates engage productively with the proteasome if and only if they have low sequence complexity tags at their termini (Kraut et al., 2012; Schrader et al., 2011) . Accordingly, we quantified the sequence complexities of each of the designed CTTs based on the WT and reduced amino acid alphabets. Here, we use the Lempel-Ziv (LZ) measure of complexity (Lempel and Ziv, 1976 ) that has been used in previous analysis of IDPs / IDRs Romero et al., 2000) . Interestingly, we find that the variants that have low cellular levels in B. subtilis (Figure 3B & 6B) also have the lowest LZ sequence complexity in their CTT sequences ( Figure 6E) .

Whilst such an approach would readily identify the structured regions of FtsZ, specifically the core and the CTP, as evolutionarily relevant modules, this approach is not readily transferrable to IDPs / IDRs. The CTL shows minimal sequence conservation -an attribute that is shared by many other IDPs / IDRs (Chen et al., 2006; Holehouse et al., 2017) .

These interactions are weak enough to be screened by monovalent salts such as 200 mM KCl, which is less than the basal KCl salt concentration of 350 mM in B. subtilis (Whatmore et al., 1990) . For FtsZ variants with higher \u03ba CTTs, the lateral interactions appear to have at least two distinct modes. In the presence of GTP, the tail-to-tail interactions can be weakened with monovalent salt if FtsZ molecules bind GTP and make canonical polymers. However, in the second mode of interaction, unmasked here in the absence of GTP, the salt dependence of assembly formation is inverted vis-\u00e0-vis the wild-type FtsZ, and tail-mediated interactions promote aberrant assemblies (Figure 5D & 5E) . It would appear that assemblies stabilized by tail-to-tail associations can grow larger as salt concentration increases -a feature that resembles salting-out transitions whereby proteins become insoluble at higher salt concentrations (Ruckenstein and Shulgin, 2006) .",

Similar results were observed by altering the patterning of oppositely charged residues within the IDR of DDX4, a protein that forms nuage bodies (Nott et al., 2015) . Theories show that the driving forces for phase separation become stronger and the salt dependence becomes weaker with increased separation of charged residues (Chang et al., 2017; Lin et al., 2016 Lin et al., , 2018 .

Thus, the CTT plays an auto-inhibitory role by promoting polymerization and lowering the efficiency of GTP hydrolysis. In this way, although GTP binding is required to promote canonical FtsZ polymerization, the hydrolysis of GTP provides the energy required to bend / deform FtsZ polymers to form Z-rings. Preliminary atomistic simulations of the CTT tethered to the FtsZ core show that the CTP motif makes fluctuating patterns of contacts with the T7 activation loop of the FtsZ core (data not shown). We propose that in addition to stabilizing the protofilaments and reducing subunit turnover by lowering the GTPase activity, the CTL may also enable inhibitory interactions between the CTP and the active site of the enzyme. This auto-inhibition could further reduce the GTPase activity and promote polymerization by weakening the dissociation of FtsZ subunits. Similar auto-inhibitory roles have been ascribed to disordered tails that are tethered to ordered domains in a range of different systems (Trudeau et al., 2013) .",

However, in the bacterial context, the weakening of enzymatic activity ensures robust FtsZ polymerization, which provides the basis for ring formation and serves as a generator of multivalency of CTP motifs that helps coordinate membrane anchoring and a network of interactions with effector proteins and regulatory molecules. The overall picture that emerges is of a multi-functional, multi-purpose CTT with definable features appear to govern the evolution of its amino acid sequence. The sequence complexity has to be sufficiently high vis-\u00e0-vis a random control to ensure cellular stability of FtsZ. The CTT has to enable auto-regulatory functions of suppressing GTP hydrolysis by promoting polymerization in the presence of GTP (Figure 7) . It is worth noting that polymers of FtsZ will be defined by a multivalency of CTP motifs. From a functional standpoint, this should provide the basis for membrane anchoring and mediating a full complement of protein-protein interactions. As far as cell division and cell growth are concerned, the intra-CTT sequence segregation of oppositely charged residues cannot cross a defined threshold value. If this threshold value is crossed, then the regulatory tail-mediated interactions can be overwhelmed by GTP-independent tail-to-tail interactions. These strong tail-mediated will promote alternative assemblies that compromise canonical FtsZ polymerization and Z-ring formation while conferring a dominant negative phenotype.",

The bacterial strains and plasmids used in this study are listed in Table S1 of the supplemental material. Synthetic double-stranded oligonucleotides of the CTL variants were ordered from Integrated DNA Technologies, digested using restriction enzymes, and ligated into pPJ19, which contains FtsZ, under the control of the Pspac promoter that is inducible with 0.1 mM IPTG, with restriction sites flanking the CTL. A BamHI site after amino acid 315 and a XmaI site before residue 366 result in the insertion of amino acid pairs GS and PG N-and C-terminal to the CTL, respectively. The plasmid was transformed into PAL 644, a strain of E. coli derived from PAL930. PAL 644 contains the low copy plasmid pBS58 expressing E. coli ftsQAZ, which allows the sub-cloning of B. subtilis FtsZ. FtsZ was amplified in pPJ19, the product of which was restriction digested, purified, and ligated into pDR67. The multiple cloning site in the vector pDR67 contains the 5'-and 3'-ends of the amyE gene on either side, which allows the insertion of FtsZ into the amyE locus by homologous recombination.",

For WT and CTLV4, bundling decreases as salt concentration increases. (G) Comparative assessments of GTPase activity -normalized to the WT FtsZ -for CTLV4 and \u2206CTT. Polymerization weakens the GTPase activity and this auto-inhibition derives from the presence of the tail. This point is made by comparing the efficiencies of GTP hydrolysis for CTLV4 and \u2206CTT to that of the WT FtsZ. The efficiencies are shown normalized to that of WT. Absence of the CTT leads to an enzyme that almost three times more efficient as a GTPase when compared to the WT or CTLV4.

Polymerization and bundling increases the effective valence of the CTP, shown in pink. In the absence of GTP, FtsZ subunits exist primarily as monomers and small oligomers. As CTT \u03ba is increased above 0.4, the interactions amongst CTTs alter the FtsZ assembly mechanism. In the presence of GTP, high \u03ba FtsZ variants form large linear polymers that become laterally zippered through stable CTT-CTT interactions, forming a train track-like morphology thereby inhibiting GTP hydrolysis and slowing down subunit turnover. In the absence of GTP, FtsZ interactions amongst CTTs lead to the formation of spherical assemblies that are stabilized in higher salt concentrations.",

Pappu Figure S1 : Naturally occurring sequences with an FCR \u2248 0.3 have a more positive \u03ba value than would be expected by random chance. We identified all predicted IDRs from the human protein within the bounds 0.27 < FCR < 0.33 that were thirty residues or more in length (4755 IDRs). For each IDR, we calculated the expected \u03ba (\u27e8\u03ba\u27e9) value associated with a sequence of that composition in the absence of any selective pressure performing multiple random shuffles and assessing the mean value. Finally, for each naturally occurring IDR (WT), we calculated the \u0394\u03ba, where \u0394\u03ba = \u03ba WT -\u27e8\u03ba\u27e9.

The same analysis was performed for randomly shuffled sequences instead of naturally occurring sequences to assess the intrinsic variance in the data, as shown in the black curve. Many sequences showed a bias for higher than expected \u03ba values, although a small number of sequences showed a bias for lower than expected \u03ba values.

The associated distribution of \u03ba values is shown in blue. For each sequence, we then shuffled the sequence multiple times to generate a set of randomly permuted CTT sequences.

(A) The domain architecture of FtsZ is characterized by an N-terminal folded core, which contributes to the GTPase activity, an intrinsically disordered C-terminal linker (CTL), a conserved 17-residue C-terminal peptide (CTP), and a C-terminal tip known as the C-terminal variable (CTV) region. The core is shown using an electrostatic surface representation that was generated using the APBS software package (Jurrus et al., 2018). Regions of high negative and positive potential are shown in red and blue, respectively; and regions that are net neutral are shown in white.
