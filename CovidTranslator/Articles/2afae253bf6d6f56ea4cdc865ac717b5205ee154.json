Currently, there is no effective treatment for this epidemic. SARS-3CL pro has been shown to be essential for replication and is thus a target for drug discovery. Here, a class of stable benzotriazole esters was reported as mechanism-based inactivators of 3CL pro , and the most potent inactivator exhibited a k inact of 0.0011 s 21 and a K i of 7.5 nM. Mechanistic investigation with kinetic and mass spectrometry analyses indicates that the active site Cys145 is acylated, and that no irreversible inactivation was observed with the use of the C145A mutant. In addition, a noncovalent, competitive inhibition became apparent by using benzotriazole ester surrogates in which the bridged ester-oxygen group is replaced with carbon.",

The origin of SARS-CoV is unclear, though studies on the molecular evolution of SARS-CoV indicate that the virus may have emerged from nonhuman species [7] . At present, no efficacious therapy for SARS is available. Therefore, a search for effective antivirals for the SARS-CoV is of current interest.",

The active site of 3CL pro contains Cys145 and His41, constituting a catalytic dyad in which the cysteine thiol functions as the nucleophile in the proteolytic process [11] [12] [13] .

This approach relies on the use of high-yield organic reactions that can be carried out in water or water-miscible, nontoxic solvents on microscales without protecting groups, allowing the product to be assayed directly in situ without isolation and purification. Using this approach, one can quickly modify a lead compound with a small set of building blocks to identify an optimal inhibitor.",

In order to find more potent 3CL pro inhibitors, a library of Lopinavir-like compounds was assembled by using either diamine 1 or amine 2 as the core structure [24] for reaction with various acids in microtiter plates followed by screening in situ (Figure 1 ). In a typical procedure [21] [22] [23] , a library of 90 carboxylic acids (see the Supplemental Data available with this article online) (10 mmol each) in a microtiter plate was used to couple with amine 1 or 2 (10 mmol) in the presence of N,N-diisopropylethylamine (22 mmol) and 2-(1H-benzotriazole-1-yl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate (HBTU, 11 mmol) in DMF (100 ml) for 4 hr. An aliquot of the product, based on a putative 100% conversion of starting materials, was taken and subjected to the 3CL pro inhibition assay in a 20 mM Bis-Tris buffer (pH 7.0) at 25\u00baC. To obtain the IC 50 values, the initial velocities of the inhibited reactions with 50 nM of the protease and 6 mM of a fluorogenic substrate were plotted against different inhibitor concentrations. In this study, we noticed that the products derived from 2-aminobenzoic acid (well C9, IC 50 = 0.2 mM), 4-(methylamino)benzoic acid (well D5, IC 50 = 0.3 mM), 4-(dimethylamino)benzoic acid (well D6, IC 50 = 0.5 mM), and 4-(diethylamino)benzoic acid (well D7, IC 50 = 0.5 mM) showed the best inhibition and that the degree of inhibition was independent of the amine used.",

To our surprise, all of the Lopinavir-like compounds showed only modest inhibitory activities toward 3CL pro (IC 50 R 10 mM), whereas benzotriazole esters 326 showed high inhibition activities. To our knowledge, benzotriazole esters have been used as acylating agents and have never been found to be enzyme inhibitors. We then prepared a series of benzotriazole esters by condensation of HBTU with various carboxylic acids ( Figure 1B) , and we found that the benzotriazole esters derived from benzoic acid containing electron-withdrawing substituents, e.g., NO 2 , CN, and CF 3 , were susceptible to hydrolysis, whereas benzotriazole esters 3-6 and those with electron-donating groups were relatively stable in pH 5.0-8.0 over 24 hr at room temperature. The relative stability of each derivative depends on the pKa of the corresponding benzoic acid and basically follows the Hammett equation [25] [26] [27] . These stable benzotriazole esters, esters 3-10 ( Figure 1C ), were assayed, and their inhibition results against 3CL pro are shown in Table 1 .",

            "text": "Further study of the inhibition of benzotriazole esters 3-10 showed that there was a time-dependent decrease in enzyme activity as a function of the inhibitor concentration (e.g., the inhibition of compound 4) (Figure 2A ). In the presence of 1 mM DTT (dithiothreitol), the preincubation of enzyme with inhibitor did not affect the enzyme activity, indicating that DTT can protect the enzyme from inactivation ( Figure 2B procedures are shown in the Supplemental Data). We used the initial rate of inactivation (0-10 min) showing pseudo first-order kinetics to determine the inhibition constants. The enzyme activity is, however, not reduced to zero over the time period, perhaps because of the decomposition of the thioester intermediate or the existence of two populations of the enzymes. As shown in Table 1 , benzotriazole esters 3-10 are strong inhibitors, and, among these, 8 is the most potent, with an inactivation constant of 1.1 3 10 23 s 21 and an inhibition constant of 7.5 nM. In addition, these esters are not toxic to Vero E6 cells, which are often used in the cell-based assay for SARS-CoV [14] , at a concentration of 100 mM. Compound 8 represents the most potent mechanism-based 3CL pro inhibitor reported to date. We also investigated the nature of the inhibited enzyme by mass spectrometry. Electrospray ionization mass spectra of wild-type 3CL pro and 3CL pro treated with 4-(dimethylamino)benzoyl ester 4 (2 hr of incubation and 18 hr of dialysis) and their deconvoluted mass spectra were determined (see the Supplemental Data). The mass difference of 148.6 Da between the peaks of 33847.35 ([M + H] + ) and 33995.93 ([M + H] + ) implies the acylation of 3CL pro with a 4-(dimethylamino)benzoyl moiety (mass 147.12). To further investigate the acylation site, MALDI-TOF mass spectrometric analysis of the trypsin digest of 3CL pro and 3CL pro treated with 4-(dimethylamino)benzoyl ester 4 was performed. From the MALDI spectra of the tryptic 3CL pro and the tryptic acylated 3CL pro of G138-K180 peptide fragments, a mass shift of 147 Da between T15 (4594.11 Da) and acylated T15 (4741.31 Da) indicates that this peptide fragment contains an acylated residue ( Figures 3A and 3B ). In order to determine the acylation site on the acylated T15 peptide, we performed a sequence analysis by MALDI MS/MS for peptides T15 and acylated T15 as depicted in Figure 3C . There is no mass difference among y series fragment ions up to y 27 , but a mass shift of 147.2 Da (4149.6 Da versus 4296.8 Da) on b 39 clearly shows that Cys145 is the only acylation site. This is consistent with the observation of no mass shift of mutant C145A 3CL pro treated with 4-(dimethylamino)benzoyl ester 4. All of these results support the mechanism of irreversible inhibition of 3CL pro by 4-(dimethylamino)benzoyl ester 4 via acylation of Cys145 ( Figure 4 ).",

Compounds 15 and 16 were methylated or dimethylated to compounds 17-20 by using TBAF as a reagent ( Figure 5A ).

Inhibition analysis shows that compounds 13-20 are noncovalent competitive inhibitors, albeit relatively weak ones compared to the corresponding esters; of these, compound 14 is most potent, with a K i of 1.0 mM. Reduction of the carbonyl group, however, results in a significant loss of activity ( Figure 5A ). It is noted that the benzotriazole compounds contain three equilibrium structures in solution ( Figure 5B ) [25, 26] , and that compounds 13-20 may mimic the ester forms instead of the three equilibrium forms found in solution.",

The g-S atom of Cys145 was close enough, within 3.5 \u00c5 in a rigid model, to the carbonyl group of the benzotriazole ester to render a nucleophilic attack. The aminophenyl group (for 3 and 4) and the indole moiety (for 8 and 9) were in the region surrounded by Thr25, Thr26, His41, Thr45, Ala46, and Met49. The NH group of the indole moiety of 8 was hydrogen bonded with the side chain OH of Thr25. In comparison, the indole group of 9 lacks such hydrogen bonding and thus shows a weaker affinity toward 3CL pro than does isomer 8. Compounds 13-20 do not fit into the pocket well enough to interact with the residues mentioned above, and the calculated minimal energies of binding are w0.5-1.0 kcal/mol higher than those of the corresponding esters, consistent with the inhibition assay result (see the Supplemental Data).",

Currently, no effective antiviral agents exist against this deadly epidemic. The main protease of SARS-CoV, 3CL pro , is an attractive target for drug discovery due to its essential role in viral replication. We have discovered several stable benzotriazole esters as a new class of irreversible enzyme inhibitors, and, to our knowledge, these compounds are the most potent mechanism-based 3CL pro inhibitors known to date. The mode of action has been studied and has been shown to proceed through acylation of the active site Cys145 assisted by the catalytic dyad.",
