Responding to any new threat entails assessing the risk to the blood supply and recipients' health; evaluating how best to manage and/or control each potential risk; and communicating this information to blood donors, recipients, physicians, and the general public. Although the FDA has the regulatory authority to develop guidance documents and new regulations in response to EID threats based on available data, the challenge of generating that data and responding to potential risks requires concerted and coordinated actions by the multiple PHS agencies (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC] , FDA, National Institutes of Health [NIH] ) and by the broader transfusion medicine community (AABB and blood providers). It is therefore incumbent upon the transfusion medicine professionals to collect and provide robust data in a timely manner to policymakers to inform their decision process, as well as take an active role in risk communication. All stakeholders must recognize what they can do and provide leadership and timely research and risk assessments. In so doing, they must take a hard look at their responses and learn lessons from history. Such a process does not involve a confirmation or criticism of what has been done in previous responses to potential threats to the blood supply, but an assessment of how responses can be improved for future threats.",

Busch, MD, PhD, Blood Systems Research Institute, University of California, San Francisco-The possibility that AIDS could be transmitted through blood and blood products was first formally discussed in December 1982 in Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR), 2 almost 6 months after the first reports of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia in patients with hemophilia 3 and almost 18 months after the first reports of P. carinii pneumonia in homosexual men. 4 In January 1983 the CDC convened a workgroup to review existing information on transfusion-and factor concentrate-associated AIDS cases and to identify opportunities to prevent AIDS in blood recipients and persons with hemophilia. At that time persons with hemophilia accounted for only six of more than 800 reported AIDS cases, with five additional cases established as possibly transfusion related. A large lookback program had found that only 10 of 140 AIDS patients interviewed in San Francisco reported donating blood during previous years. In a statement issued later in January 1983, the CDC workgroup simply noted that \"the possibility of blood borne transmission, still unproven, has been raised.\" Furthermore, the cause of AIDS was still unknown in January 1983, but because existing data showed that the vast majority of homosexual men and intravenous (IV) drug users tested positive for surrogate markers such as antibodies against the hepatitis B virus (HBV; anti-HBc), the workgroup remarked that use of \"non-specific markers\" was under evaluation. No agency took responsibility for prevention of transfusion-transmitted AIDS.",

Thus the 1983 statement noted that direct or indirect questions regarding donors' sexual preferences were inappropriate. Nonetheless, the blood bank in San Francisco developed a process whereby donors could discreetly exclude themselves by answering \"yes\" or \"no\" to a block of questions about known AIDS risk factors. By mid-1983 many blood collection organizations, particularly those in cities at high risk, had adopted a donor qualification process known as self-deferral by which presenting donors were provided with information about AIDS risk factors and where those with such risk factors were asked not to donate. There was also outreach to homosexual community organizations to discourage donation from at-risk men. In New York City, and later elsewhere, the \"confidential unit exclusion\" procedures were introduced that allowed individuals to give blood but then inform the blood bank of their nondisclosed risk behaviors so the blood units would be discarded or used for research.",

Of note, flow cytometry equipment for performing T-cell ratios was not available outside of limited research labs and anti-HBc testing yielded many false positives, and no confirmatory tests were available. Moreover, there were concerns that positive surrogate tests would be concerning to donors, that homosexual men would donate blood simply to get the test, and that elimination of homosexual donors would negatively affect the blood supply. Once the homosexual community learned of the potential risks, many in the community stopped donating blood. By 1984, great concerns had arisen in the patient community, and there was a general fear of blood originating from San Francisco. Additionally, the performance characteristics of the anti-HBc test remained of concern. A larger study 5 of transfusion-transmitted AIDS was published in January 1984, and by December 1984 the number of transfusion-related AIDS cases had risen to more than 100.",

Questioning of potential donors was not further optimized because blood banks expected that HIV tests would soon be available. Yet HIV antibody tests were not available until 1985. Lookback studies found that more than 30% of donors testing positive for HIV were also reactive for anti-HBc and that approximately 90% of recipients transfused with blood from HIV-infected or suspected cases acquired infection. An analysis of donation histories of HIV-infected donors in San Francisco, HIV infection prevalence among homosexual men in San Francisco, and HIV donation rates by subsequently identified infected donors estimated that the incidence of transfusion-transmitted HIV infection rose rapidly, from the first occurrence in 1978 to a peak in 1982 of approximately 1% per unit transfused and that more than 2000 recipients in San Francisco alone had been infected with HIV through transfusions. 6 The analysis also showed that donor selection and education efforts had been effective in curbing the number of donations by infected individuals. Donations by individuals who later tested positive for HIV or developed clinical AIDS had declined by 75% by the time anti-HBc testing was implemented and by 90% by the time HIV-specific testing was available.",

A further study found an infectious window period of 56 days from infection to detectable antibody conversion by the first-generation screening assays. 8 Later improvements in the sensitivity of antibody assays reduced this preseroconversion infectious window period to approximately 3 weeks, and the subsequent additions of p24 antigen and its replacement with nucleic acid testing (NAT) virtually eliminated this window, resulting in current risk estimates of approximately 1 infectious unit per 1.5 million transfused units. In fact, six transmissions have been reported in the United States since 1999, when NAT was implemented, during which time from 13 to 17 million whole blood (WB) donations per year were processed and distributed. Even more impressive, the implementation of viral inactivation steps, in addition to donor selection and HIV testing has eliminated transmission of HIV by plasma derivatives, with no cases reported in more than 20 years.",

Dodd, PhD, American Red Cross-Viral hepatitis has long been recognized as a major adverse outcome of transfusion and, indeed, in the 1960s and early 1970s, prospective studies suggested that 10% or more of blood recipients were affected. Hepatitis A and B had been differentiated on epidemiologic and clinical grounds before the discovery of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) in 1968. At that time, posttransfusion hepatitis (PTH) was thought to be entirely due to HBV. Insensitive tests for HBsAg were implemented as a blood safety measure, starting in 1970 to 1971 and had some very limited impact on PTH, although a much greater impact was attributed to careful donor selection methods and the avoidance of paid donations. Even the introduction of highly sensitive radioimmunoassays in 1973 further reduced the incidence of PTH only by 20%. The recognition of hepatitis A virus (HAV) and the development of diagnostic tests revealed that the vast majority of residual PTH was not due to HAV or HBV, and the term non-A, non B hepatitis (NANBH) was coined. Efforts to identify the causative agent started, but did not succeed until 1989. In the meantime, large, multicenter prospective studies of PTH were executed. 9 These studies revealed epidemiologic relationships between surrogate markers (elevated alanine aminotransferase [ALT] levels and the presence of anti-HBc) in donors and PTH in recipients. 10, 11 In 1982, the introduction of donor testing for surrogate markers was predicted to reduce NANBH transmission by 30% to 60%; such testing was not widely implemented until 1986. This delay was attributable to a number of factors including concern about loss of donors, uncertainty about the true severity of NANBH, and the need to manage the HIV/AIDS epidemic.",

NAT for HCV was additionally implemented in 1999 and, currently, it is estimated that the residual risk of transfusion-transmitted HCV in the United States is 1 per 1.5 million blood components. 14 The experience with NANBH illustrates the power of persistence and teaches us some lessons about the benefits and risks of surrogate testing. Although these tests were useful in eliminating potentially infected donors, many donors were excluded even though they were not carriers of HCV. In addition, lessons from the NANBH and/or HCV story might not apply to the 21st century. For example, the virus associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) was identified within 24 hours after samples were received. On the other hand, we should recognize that it is likely that the increased use of molecular genetics and genomic methods to identify viruses will lead to the discovery of many viruses without associated diseases.",

This resulted in development and implementation of algorithms to convert blood regions from pooled to more sensitive individual-donation (ID) testing during intervals with WNV activity in donors. 23 These triggers have evolved while recognizing the operational burden inherent in testing ID aliquots. A 2008 AABB Association Bulletin recommended that ID-NAT be triggered when two presumptively viremic donors are seen within a rolling 7 days. It made recommendations for establishing at-risk donor populations within a collection area, that WNV activity and donor testing be monitored in real time and converted to ID-NAT within 48 hours of reaching a trigger, and that ID aliquot testing continue for a minimum of 7 days with no viremic donors. 24 Six additional cases of transfusion-transmitted WNV have been recognized from 2004 through 2011. 25 For perspective, these occurred against a background of more than 20,000,000 blood components transfused annually. These cases were attributed primarily to insensitive triggers and inefficient communication between neighboring centers. Accordingly, triggers have been continuously reassessed, and in some systems a single viremic donor in the presence of other WNV activity in a community may be used to implement ID screening. In addition, again based on models from CDC, some systems extend ID screening for 2 weeks or more beyond the last viremic donation. 26 Communication in the blood safety community has been reinforced, for example, using processes that include e-mail notification trees, daily examination of the AABBWNV Biovigilance Network website and other public health WNV surveillance sources. These are designed to ensure that overlapping collection regions are aware when there has been donor activity in their areas that should trigger ID screening for multiple organizations, even in the absence of viremic donors at one or more of those collection facilities.",

This program involves the potential suspension of testing in the winter when human activity is minimal, combined with planned conversion to ID testing during historically high incidence weeks and months, anticipating the detection of donor infections. These steps might enhance the capacity to convert to ID testing during the transmission season by conserving resources in testing facilities during low-incidence periods.

Approximately 75% of cases of dengue virus infection are unapparent, but can also range in severity from mild, nonspecific, acute febrile disease referred to as dengue fever to severe dengue, previously referred to as dengue hemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome. Before 1970, only nine countries experienced severe dengue epidemics but now the disease has emerged or reemerged in more than 100 countries, 38 vCJD, the human form of bovine spongiform encephalopathy, is a prion-associated, degenerative, and always fatal disease with a lengthy incubation period of 5 to 15 years. 34 The majority of the 225 vCJD cases reported worldwide through October 2011 have been observed in the United Kingdom (n = 176) after vCJD was first recognized as a distinct agent in 1996. Only three of the known cases remain alive. Although similar to sporadic, iatrogenic, and familial CJD, vCJD occurs primarily among younger individuals, presents with psychiatric symptoms, and generally has a longer course from diagnosis to death. Four cases of transfusion-transmitted vCJD have been recognized from 2003 to 2007, three of which resulted in the development of vCJD in the recipients with the fourth occurring in an individual who died of underlying disease but was found to harbor the agent in the spleen and at least one lymph node. 40 Of note, all transmissions were from nonleukoreduced blood components. There was a fifth possible transmission from Factor VIII concentrates. 41 Only three vCJD cases have been reported in the United States; two of those arose from exposure in the United Kingdom, and the other arose from exposure in Saudi Arabia. Data from a recent study suggest that all blood components can transmit the vCJD prion whether leukoreduced or not; leukoreduction, in the case of PLTs, extended the incubation period by 700 days in the sheep experimental model. 42 The experimental transmissions and human cases in recipients with known exposure to blood from donors who later developed vCJD highlight the high rate of infection among individuals exposed through transfusion. Although the risk for vCJD appears to be declining, the number of exposed individuals is unknown, and a second wave of infections is possible. Interventions that consist primarily of donor deferral based on a history of travel to the United Kingdom and other affected countries were implemented before evidence of transfusion-associated transmission was reported. The efficacy of this strategy is unknown and was implemented as a balance between theoretical risk reduction and manageable donor loss expected not to exceed 2% of presenting donors. No licensed test is available as a donor screen, and the development, licensure, and implementation of a screening test are unlikely in the United States.",

XMRV infection could be seen in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMNCs) and plasma. The authors thus raised the possibility that XMRV infection contributed to the pathogenesis of CFS, and an accompanying commentary further noted that in light of the presence of infectious virus in plasma and blood cells, blood-borne transmission was possible. 45 In response to this potential EID threat, DHHS immediately facilitated the establishment and coordination of collaborative groups, both internal and external to DHHS: the AABB Interorganizational Task Force and the DHHS/NHLBI Blood XMRV Scientific Research Working Group (SRWG). The former took the lead on risk management and risk communication aspects of the response, whereas the latter was charged with the design and coordination of research studies to evaluate whether XMRV poses a threat to blood safety (risk assessment).",

            "text": "Harvey Klein, MD, NIH, Bethesda-Within 60 days of the Science publication, AABB convened an interorganizational task force and charged it with reviewing available data; recommending actions to be considered to mitigate a potential risk for blood-borne transmission; and advising AABB about ways to inform donors, recipients, physicians, and the general public about the risk of transfusion-related transmission of XMRV. 46 Among the evidence reviewed by the Task Force were the Science article, a Proceedings of the National Academies of Science report showing the presence of murine leukemia virus (MLV) nucleic acid (NA), distinct at the sequence level from XMRV, in 86% of CFS patients and 6.8% of controls, 47 and primate studies suggesting that IV injections of XMRV led to viremia and seroconversion and describing tissue tropism. 48 There were also negative data from the United States and several other countries. [49] [50] [51] [52] [53] [54] [55] [56] [57] [58] Although the Task Force never met face to face, monthly teleconferences kept participants current on published and unpublished information; electronic communication circulated prepublications to all members. The Task Force postulated several reasons for the discordant results, including geographic differences in populations, nonvalidated assays, differing definitions of CFS, and laboratory contamination. On the basis of the inconsistent available data and Task Force consensus, the AABB adopted a pre-cautionary policy of donor education and self-deferral for persons with a history of CFS. The policy was instituted widely in the United States and in Canada. A summary of the data and the Task Force policy was published in TRANSFUSION. As more data became available, including the recombinant origin of XMRV in laboratory mice, evidence pointed to contamination of reagents from this recombinant agent. 59, 60 On the basis of these data, the Task Force concluded that the few observed positive results represented false positives and that there was no evidence that XMRV poses a transfusion risk. This experience showed that an interorganizational task force can be formed rapidly and that the inclusion of representation from major stakeholders can provide that task force with credibility. In addition, the public-private partnership in the task force could share unpublished information and form consensus positions effectively, while allowing member organizations autonomy in deciding whether to act on a position or perform alternative actions. Moreover, the Task Force presented a single voice and focused on a rapidly evolving issue, which was helpful in addressing inquiries from the press.",

A careful review of the current state of epidemiologic knowledge on potential association of prostate cancer and/or CFS with receipt of prior blood transfusions, revealed little to no association. Four relevant studies on the potential association of blood transfusions with cancer were identified (reviewed by Simmons et al. 61 ).

The panels consisted of XMRV-infected cells (22Rv1 cells) or supernatant from those cells, diluted in WB or plasma respectively to mimic potential clinical samples. No gross differences between the sensitivities of the participating assays for detecting viral NA were observed for the two analytical panels. 61, 64 Thus, the differences in detection of NA by groups that did not detect virus in clinical samples could not be explained by a lack of sensitivity. 52, 63 In addition, a number of the other participating laboratories used these assays in subsequent studies that failed to detect XMRV or other MLVs in blood donors 64, 65 or other populations such as patients with CFS or prostate cancer. 60, 66 Although the Phase I study was not designed to examine assay specificity, in general there were no concerns in terms of false-positive results. 61, 64 Two pilot studies of clinical samples from CFS patients previously described as XMRV positive 43 were performed in Phase II. The first study was unblinded and designed to identify the best sample type (WB, plasma, PBMNCs) and processing methods. The results were inconsistent and thus a second, blinded study was performed using samples from four patients with CFS who had previously tested XMRV positive and a healthy control individual previously demonstrated to be XMRV negative. Four laboratories performed NA detection, while two studied serologic responses. The majority of laboratories (three of four) were unable to detect any evidence of XMRV or MLV NA in any of the samples, and one of the laboratories failed to detect any serologic response. The fourth NA laboratory was unable to report results due to an internal error in sample processing. The final serologic laboratory reported three of four patients with CFS to be seropositive for XMRV. The control was also found to be positive, despite previously being pedigreed as negative.",

In addition to the NAT performed on all three blood components, serologic and virus culture assays were also performed on plasma. 67 Samples and controls were divided and distributed to nine independent laboratories for blinded testing. Six of seven laboratories performing NAT found no positive clinical samples. The seventh found three positive samples-one from the XMRV or MLV clinical sample set and two from the negative controls, but phylogenetic analysis suggested that all of these sequences likely arose from 22Rv1 contamination (P. Kellam and S. Hu\u00e9, unpublished analysis). Among the two laboratories that were able to report virus culture results, one found no positive samples, and the second reported the presence of XMRV in 40% of negative controls, compared with 20% of clinical samples. Among the four laboratories that conducted serology testing, two reported no positive samples, and the others found an even distribution of positive samples among negative and positive controls. In addition, there was no correlation between which samples the two laboratories found to be positive, despite the fact they were running the same assay. On the basis of these results, the SRWG noted that no laboratory demonstrated reproducible detection of XMRV or MLV and that available assays could not reproducibly detect virus or antibodies in samples from patients previously characterized as positive. The Working Group thus concluded that routine screening of blood donors for XMRV or other MLVs is not warranted. 67 Since this work was published, several additional publications have reported no signs of XMRV in human blood donors 64, 65, 68, 69 and additional publications have found no association between XMRV and CFS, 70, 71 as well as further evidence that detection of XMRV in clinical samples is the result of contamination from multiple sources. 60 These reports eventually led to retractions of the two articles that reported detection of XMRV in CFS patients and control donors. 43, 47 Discussion points",

Kleinman, MD, University of British Columbia-The classic paradigm of emerging threats to the blood supply assumes that an agent can cause persistent, asymptomatic infections in donors and that an infected donor can continue to make many infectious blood donations. Likewise, experiences with HIV and HCV have led many to assume that the next threat will spread by parenteral contact and be associated with risk behaviors. Recent agents, such as WNV and dengue, are vector borne, cause transient infections, and would cause a substantial number of transfusion-transmitted cases only if infection was highly prevalent. Moreover, the risk of infection with these agents depends more on where someone lives or travels. Potential transfusion-transmissible agents that require further investigation might be discovered through repository studies or viral discovery programs without being associated with any known disease; from agents associated with clinical disease, but not proven to be transfusion transmitted at the time they are discovered; or from zoonotic agents, such as the virus underlying SARS, that are spread to humans.",

Likewise, there has been no evidence that recent measles outbreaks are transmitted by transfusion, but there has been enough concern for a working group to issue a fact sheet. Although arboviruses such as WNV can cause human disease and be transmitted by transfusion, the risk for such transmission will depend on their outbreak potential, and because they have complicated epidemiologies such potential cannot be predicted. Retroviruses are of particular concern because of their potential for latent infection and mutagenicity. In addition, transfusion bypasses the body's natural defenses and therefore can be a highly efficient route of transmission. Thus, even low concentrations of pathogen can be transmitted based on the volume of blood transfused. Moreover, many recipients are often immunosuppressed and can therefore develop severe clinical disease if infected.",

NHLBI has established five linked donor-recipient repositories, and several other donor-only or recipient-only repositories are available. 73 Testing of frozen repositories with donorrecipient linkage can help to evaluate transfusion transmission and provide a historical perspective on prevalence and incidence, but these repositories are usually limited to particular geographic catchment areas and time periods, and recipient enrollment and sample collection are difficult and expensive.

A checklist (or decision tree) similar to that used by the Federal Aviation Administration in responding to emergencies was suggested. Such a plan must be developed simultaneously with efforts to corroborate the initial findings; development of the plan should also at least consider situations when inaction is actually the best course. An action plan can include triggers and decision points to guide theoretical actions, but these triggers could simply provide impetus for further consideration. For example, with the H1N1 influenza epidemic, decision trees were established, and stakeholders reconvened and considered potential actions each time a threshold or trigger was approached. Action plans should be flexible, because each infectious agent is different, and one response does not fit all situations. Moreover, in many cases, such as that with XMRV, critical elements of a checklist, such as the epidemiology of an agent or its association with disease, might not be known to guide next steps.",

            "text": "The first antibody screening test was licensed in the United States in December 2006 after clinical trials demonstrated efficacy.31 Universal blood donation screening was implemented by most US blood centers early in 2007 with confirmed seropositive rates of 1 per 25,000 to 1 per 30,000 donations.32 FDA guidance released in December 2010 allowed for a change to a selective testing strategy where a donor would be tested only once for T. cruzi antibody and, if negative, all future donations made by that donor would also be assumed to be negative. The safety of such a strategy is based on the absence of documented incident cases in the United States and low rates of transfusion transmission (<2%) from seropositive components, with documented transmissions confined to platelets (PLTs).33 A supplement published by TRANSFUSION in August 2009 34 identified three EID agents (among more than 68 such agents) as the highest-priority agents for which a blood safety intervention should be considered: the parasite Babesia, dengue viruses, and the prion responsible for causing variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD). All are transmitted by transfusion, are associated with a clinically apparent or fatal disease, and lack an effective intervention. Babesia and dengue are also increasing in frequency and/or recognition. These and other emerging pathogens, including T. cruzi, share few common characteristics. Thus, generalization regarding these diverse agents is dangerous, and each may require a different approach relative to transfusion safety. Because the emergence of these pathogens is unpredictable, vigilance remains critical.Babesia is an intraerythrocytic parasite that is geographically clustered in the northeastern and upper Mid-western regions of the United States; seven states are considered endemic.34,35 Infection is generally mild and transient; intermittent parasitemia may occur for months to up to several years. The parasite is transmitted primarily by Ixodes ticks; this tick is also responsible for transmission of the bacterium that causes Lyme disease and other agents. Transfusion is increasingly recognized as a significant transmission route due to the lack of an effective intervention and the growing number of infected individuals reported. Since January 2011, cases of babesiosis are nationally notifiable. Transfusion-associated babesiosis has been documented in 162 cases from 1979 to 2009 (159 of B. microti and three of B. duncani).36,37 Those at greatest risk from transfusion-transmitted infection include infants; the elderly; and individuals who are immunocompromised and asplenic and have red blood cell (RBC) disorders. Of the cases of transfusion-associated babesiosis reported, 77% occurred between 2000 and 2009, and all but four were associated with RBC components. The remainder was due to random-donor PLTs likely contaminated with residual RBCs. The parasite has been shown, via transfusion-transmitted cases, to survive for up to 42 days in RBCs and indefinitely, if cryo-preserved.",
