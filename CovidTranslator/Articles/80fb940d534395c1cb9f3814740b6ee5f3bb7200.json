            "text": "Sequence comparison has become one of the essential bioinformatics tools in bioinformatics research, which could serve as evidence of structural and functional conservation, as well as of evolutionary relations among the sequences. Existing graphical representation methods have achieved promising results in sequence comparison, but there are some design challenges with the graphical representations and feature-based measures. We reported here a new method for sequence comparison. It considers whole distribution of dual bases and employs polar coordinates method to map a biological sequence into a closed curve. The curve tree was then constructed to numerically characterize the closed curve of biological sequences, and further compared biological sequences by evaluating the distance of the curve tree of the query sequence matching against a corresponding curve tree of the template sequence. The proposed method was tested by phylogenetic analysis, and its performance was further compared with alignment-based methods. The results demonstrate that using polar coordinates representation and curve tree to compare sequences is more efficient.",

One is alignment-based methods, in which dynamic programming that finds an optimal alignment by assigning scores to different possible alignments and picking the alignment with the highest score. Several alignmentbased algorithms have been proposed such as global alignment, local alignment, with or without overlap (Gotoh, 1982; Needleman and Wunsch, 1970; Smith and Waterman, 1981) . Waterman (1995) and Durbin et al. (1998) provided comprehensive reviews about this method. However, the search for optimal solutions using sequence alignment has problems in computationally load with large biological databases and choice of the scoring schemes (Pham and Zuegg, 2004; Vinga and Almeida, 2003) . Therefore, the second class, alignment-free methods, was proposed to overcome the limitations of alignment-based methods.",

            "text": "Graphical representation of DNA sequences was first proposed by Hamori and Ruskin (1983) in which DNAs have been shown as 3D curves. Gates (1986 ), Nandy, (1994 , and Leong and Morgenthaler (1995) developed 2D graphical representations of DNA sequences. These methods are straightforward but are accompanied with some loss of information due to overlapping and crossing of the curve representing DNA with itself. Randic et al. (2003a) developed a novel 2D representation method to overcome the degeneracy of the graphical representation. Recently, several other 2D and 3D representations have been proposed (Liao and Wang, 2004; Chi and Ding, 2005; Yao et al., 2005; Zhang and Liao, 2007; Zhang and Chen, 2006; Huang et al., 2009 Huang et al., , 2011 Wu et al., 2010; Maaty et al., 2010a Maaty et al., , 2010b Bai et al., 2011; Xie and Mo, 2011; Randic et al., 2003b Randic et al., , 2006 Randic et al., , 2001 Yao and Wang, 2004; Liu et al., 2006; Randic, 2000; . According to the handling bases of biological sequences, all the methods can be classified as: single nucleotide-based (Liao and Wang, 2004; Chi and Ding, 2005; Yao et al., 2005; Zhang and Liao, 2007; Zhang and Chen, 2006; Huang et al., 2009 Huang et al., , 2011 Wu et al., 2010; Maaty et al., 2010a Maaty et al., , 2010b Bai et al., 2011; Xie and Mo, 2011; Randic et al., 2003a Randic et al., , 2006 Yao and Wang, 2004) and dual nucleotide-based representations (Liu et al., 2006; Randic, 2000; Randic et al., 2001; . They often assign the n bases to corresponding points (Liao and Wang, 2004; Chi and Ding, 2005; Yao et al., 2005; Zhang and Liao, 2007; Zhang and Chen, 2006; Huang et al., 2009 Huang et al., , 2011 Wu et al., 2010; Maaty et al., 2010a Maaty et al., , 2010b Bai et al., 2011; Xie and Mo, 2011) , to the four lines (Randic et al., 2003b (Randic et al., , 2006 , or to the cell/system (Yao and Wang, 2004; Liu et al., 2006) to design the graphical representation.",

First, many graphical representations were designed by assigning the single bases or dual nucleotides to corresponding direction/points/cells in Cartesian coordinates, so little attention has been paid to the whole distribution of the single nucleotide or dual nucleotides in biological sequences. Second, the choice of the direction/points/cells for the single base or dual nucleotides is arbitrary. Finally, the feature-based similarity measures are always associated with the invariants of the distance matrices that are gotten by complex repetitive computation. When the sequences are long, these kinds of feature-based similarity measures become less useful. Moreover, we believe that better representation and similarity measure will allow us to design more effective sequence comparison method. This paper introduced a novel method to represent and compare biological sequences. Based on the whole distribution of the dual bases, we proposed a polar coordinates representation that maps a biological sequence into a closed curve. The closed curve was then transformed into a curve tree instead of the distance matrix, and a tree matching distance was proposed to estimate the similarity of two biological sequences. To assess the effectiveness of the proposed method, we took two experiments and compared its performance with the alignment-based method.",

The closed curve of Gallus is dissimilar to the other because it is the only non-mammal animals among them. Therefore, polar representation provides us with a simple way to compare different biological sequences. For comparison, we list the recently published results of the examination of the degree of similarity between Human and other several species in Fig. 8 (Zhang, 2009; Yu et al., 2009; Wang et al., 2010; Xie and Mo, 2011) . As one can see there is an overall agreement among similarities obtained by different approaches despite some variation among them. But it is also noted that the degree of dissimilarities of Human-Goat and Human-Bovine are larger than that of Human-Opposum and Human-Gallus, which is an undesirable result because Gallus is the only non-mammal among them, and Opossum is the most remote species from the remaining mammals.",

Both two data sets are aligned with the multiple alignmen CLUSTAL X and use the neighbor-joining to construct the phylogenetic tree presented in Figs. 9(b) and 10(b). From Fig. 9 , we find that the eleven species are separated clearly in our results: (1) three Primates (Human, Gorilla and Chimpanzee) are clustered closely; (2) two Rodents (Mouse and Rat) are grouped closely; (3) Rabbit is clustered closely with Human, Gorilla and Chimpanzee. (4) Opossum and Gallus are less closely with other species, which is consistent with the fact that Gallus is the only non-mammal among them, and Opossum is the most remote species from the remaining mammals. Our results are consistent with the results of the multiple alignment CLUSTAL X ( Fig. 9(b) ). Fig. 10(a) shows that our results are quite consistent with the authoritative results (Gu et al., 2004; Zhang, 2009 ) and that of the multiple alignment in the following aspects. First of all, all SARS-CoVs are grouped in a separate branch, which appear different from the other three groups of coronaviruses. Secondly, BCOV, BCOVL, BCOVM, BCOVQ, MHV, MHV2, MHVM, and MHVP are grouped into a branch, which is consonant with that they belong to group II. Thirdly, HCoV-229E, TGEV, and PEDV are closely related to each other, which is consistent with the fact that they belong to group I. Finally, IBV forms a distinct branch within the genus Coronavirus, because it belongs to group III. Rota et al. (2003) found out that the overall level of similarity between SARS-CoVs and the other coronaviruses is low. Our tree also reconfirms that SARS-CoVs are not closely related to any previously isolated coronaviruses and form a new group, which indicates that the SARS-CoVs have undergone an independent evolution path after the divergence from the other coronaviruses.",

Therefore, considerable efforts have been made to seek for alternative methods for sequence comparison.",

This work presented a novel method to represent and compare biological sequence. In contrast to the existing graphical representations, we used the whole distribution of the dual bases to map a biological sequence into a closed curve in polar coordinates. Then we transformed the closed curve into a curve tree instead of the distance matrix, and proposed a tree matching distance to estimate the similarity of two biological sequences. To compare the effectiveness of the proposed method, we performed extensive tests including similarity of biological sequences and phylogenetic analysis, and compared its performance with alignment-based method. The results demonstrate that the proposed method is efficient, which highlight the necessity for graphical representation method to consider the whole distribution of the dual bases. Thus, this understanding can then be used to guide development of more powerful graphical representation for biological sequence comparison. ",
