A recent study reported that the 82.1% of COVID-19 cases displayed low circulating lymphocyte counts. [4] [5] [6] However, the factors which might cause the reduction in count, and the activation status of T cells in COVID-19 patients, remain uninvestigated. We retrospectively analyze here the clinical data from 522 cases of COVID-19 who were admitted into the General Hospital of Central Theatre Command and Hanyang Hospital in Wuhan from December 2019 to January 2020. We also compared the expression of exhaustion markers PD-1 and Tim-3 on the surface of CD4 + and CD8 + T cells from COVID-19 and healthy controls. Our results thus provide a preliminary demonstration of T cell exhaustion during COVID-19 infection and suggest that more aggressive early intervention may be required in patients with low T lymphocyte counts.",

While previous studies have validated that the secretion of cytokines including IL-6, IL-10 and TNF-\u03b1 are mainly from T cells, macrophages and monocytes etc, based on our results, we suggest that the secretion of these cytokines does not originate from T cells. However, the cytokine storm in turn may promote apoptosis or necrosis of T cells, and consequently leads to their reduction. Our previous work demonstrating that monocytes and macrophages can produce pro-inflammatory cytokine during murine hepatitis virus strain-3 infection, 30, 31 and whether SARS-CoV-2 also triggers cytokine release from monocytes and macrophages in COVID-19 patients need further investigation and such work is in progress in our hospital.",

The application of potent antiviral treatments to prevent the progression to T cell exhaustion in susceptible patients may thus be critical to their recovery. We have read with great interest the successful application of Remdesivir to curing a COVID-19 patient in the US, and to clinical trials indicates that it may have significant potential as such an antiviral. 35, 36 Taken together, we conclude that T cells are decreased and exhausted in patients with COVID-19. Cytokines such as IL-10, IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 might directly mediate T cell reduction. Thus, new therapeutic measures are needed for treatment of ICU patients, and may even be necessary early on to preempt disease progression in higher-risk patients with low T cell counts.",
