Here, we have summarized the significant achievements of high-level laboratory planning, construction, and operation in China, as well as the challenges that we face in the future. Additionally, we have briefly discussed the national plan for construction of highlevel biosafety laboratories from 2016-2025 and ''biosafety-motivated\" management system. This review might be informative for further understanding the present situation and future function of high-level biosafety laboratories in China.",

In this type of laboratory, appropriate protective clothing and equipment are mandatory for scientists working in a negative pressure facility. Lastly, BSL-4 is the maximum containment, state-of-the-art facility constructed to handle dangerous and exotic biological agents that are likely to cause serious or lethal human disease with high individual and community risks, for which there are no preventative or therapeutic interventions usually available. This facility must be in complete isolation and the use of positive pressure personnel suit is mandatory for its staff. 4, 13 BSL-1 and BSL-2 are commonly referred to as basic laboratories while BSL-3 and BSL-4 are designated as high-level biosafety laboratories. 4, 11 The main purpose of these kinds of laboratories is to protect researchers from being infected when manipulating microbial pathogens, while preventing the harmful pathogens from being released into the outside environment. Reliable containment, well-trained and knowledgeable supervisor and personnel, as well as the full execution of specific biosafety manual/standard operation practices are the pre-requisites and guarantees for the safe and secure operation of these laboratories.",

Subsequently, several other laboratories were built for working on Hantavirus, HIV, arboviruses, and human bacterial pathogens in national institutions. These operational laboratories provided safety platforms for research and development to study the etiology and therapeutic approaches of infectious diseases, and they also provided valuable knowledge and experience for the development of biosafety management systems for laboratories later. 2, 12 The unprecedented severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic that affected 37 countries including China from 2002-2003, resulting in 8098 cases and 774 fatalities, highlighted the urgent necessity of strengthening the country's public health system. 14 After the epidemic and several lab-acquired infection events worldwide, biosafety became a major priority for Chinese central and local governments and a series of 'biosafety-motivated' policies were enacted to promote legislative processes and the subsequent construction of more biosafety laboratories. From that moment, a new chapter on the sustainable operation of highlevel biosafety laboratories and harmonious implementation of biosafety management was opened in China. 2, 3, 12, 16, 18 In 2004, China's central government launched a national BSL program that aimed at building a national BSL network comprising high-level BSLs as the nodes. High-level BSLs were then constructed and successfully operated. 2 As of December 31st 2013, 53 BSLs, including 42 BSL-3s, had been fully accredited in China 1 and more laboratories have completed the accreditation in recent years. In addition, more than 1000 BSL-2 labs are currently being operated in universities, research institutions, hospitals and R&D entrepreneurship centers. 2,9.12 In addition, four mobile BSL-3 laboratories were imported from Labover (Montpellier, France) and distributed to institutes in Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangdong for the nation-wide surveillance of pathogens and the emergency response of post-disaster and global public health events. 8 In addition, a self-designed and self-constructed mobile BSL-3 was composed of two 9125 mm containers and met the biosafety requirements for pathogen diagnosis. A new and improved model of BBS-3 was installed in Freetown, Sierra Leone and used for diagnosis of the Ebola virus infection. 6, 8 In parallel, a specific regulation, ''Mobile Laboratory -General Requirements for Biosafety (GB27421-2015)\", was issued and applied. 5 On January 31st 2015, the first Chinese BSL-4 laboratory (National Biosafety Laboratory, Wuhan) constructed by the Chinese Academy of Sciences was physically completed. 7, 15 After several years of commissioning and validation by relevant local and international authorities, the facility was finally accredited by the Chinese National Accreditation Service for Conformity Assessment (CNAS) and fully certified by the National Health Commission for manipulating the Ebola, Nipah, and Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever viruses, and the laboratory became operational in early 2018. 15 The operation of this laboratory marked the preliminary establishment of a national high-level biosafety network. Simultaneously, China has also created and promulgated a series of laboratory biosafety management regulations, norms, and standards to guide the construction, management, and safety operations of laboratories. 17 ",

Accordingly, the national high-level BSL network with a rational layout will be formed and operated by 2025.",

The Wuhan National Biosafety Laboratory (NBL, Wuhan), located in the Hubei Province in central China, will function as a comprehensive research and international cooperation platform for highly pathogenic microorganisms and at the same time will aim to be a reference laboratory for the World Health Organization. In Northern China, the China Center for Disease Control and Prevention will build a high-level BSL as a comprehensive platform for research on prevention and control of infectious diseases. Thereafter, the construction of other maximum biocontainment facilities in South, East, and Northwest China will be considered in accordance with domestic and international demands.",
