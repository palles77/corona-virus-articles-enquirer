To obtain a clear view of the mucous membranes of the buccal and oral cavities, teeth, tongue, gums, and tonsils, it is essential to split the mandibular symphysis and separate the mandibles as far as possible. A thorough examination of all structures will reveal not only local lesions, but often those that may be due to systemic disease. Lesions may be associated with congenital anomalies (genetic and nongenetic); trauma (physical and chemical); bacterial, mycotic, viral, and parasitic infections; metabolic and toxic diseases; and immune-mediated, dysplastic, or neoplastic disease. The poor physical condition of an animal may be directly related to oral lesions that result in difficulties of prehension, mastication, or swallowing of food.",

The development of normal face, jaws, and the oral cavity requires the integration of many embryonic processes, most importantly the frontonasal, maxillary, and mandibular processes. The complexity and duration of this development may lead to a great variety of aberrations. These are usually expressed in the newborn in the form of clefts resulting from failures of integrated growth and fusion of these processes. A common failure of fusion is that of the maxillary processes to the frontonasal process. This may leave facial fissures, cleft lip (harelip, cheiloschisis) and unilateral or bilateral primary cleft palate involving the area rostral to the incisive papilla.",

The most common is a complete cleft from one angle of the mouth to the ear of that side. This results from failure of fusion of the lateral portions of the maxillary and mandibular processes. A defect extending from a cleft lip to the eye results from failure arthrogryposis frequently occur together in Charolais calves, and appear to be hereditary (probably simple autosomal recessive), as in Hereford cattle. Cleft palate in lambs may be genetic in origin, but also is associated with the ingestion of Veratrum californicum. Secondary cleft palates have been induced experimentally in newborn pigs by feeding gilts seeds or plants of poison hemlock (Conium maculatum) during gestational days 30-45. Both tree tobacco (Nicotiana glauca) in the western United States and tobacco stalks (N. tabacum) when fed to gilts early in pregnancy can induce a high incidence of cleft palate and arthrogryposis in newborn pigs. Piperidine alkaloids (coniine, coniceine, and anabasine) in hemlock and tobacco plants are responsible for the teratogenic effects of these plants. Lupines (Lupinus formosus, L. arbustus) produce piperidine alkaloids, including the teratogen ammodendrine, which can cause cleft palate and arthrogryposis (crooked calf disease) in calves born of dams fed the lupine at days 40-50 of gestation. Palatoschisis in piglets has also been associated with consumption of feed contaminated with Crotalaria retusa seed by sows during gestation. Primary and secondary cleft palate of German Boxer dogs appear to be hereditary, probably because of a single autosomal recessive gene. A single autosomal recessive gene has been associated with cleft palate in Pyrenees Shepherd dogs. Secondary cleft palate occurs in Siamese and Abyssinian cats and is likely hereditary. Griseofulvin treatment of the pregnant queen and mare will result in palatoschisis in the offspring. The defect has also been reported in both parts of the doubled face in diprosopus cats. Anomalies in the growth of jaws are quite common. Brachygnathia superior, shortness of the maxillae, is an inherited breed characteristic among dogs and swine. It has been reported in the Large White or Yorkshire breed. The condition is progressive with age, resulting in malapposition of the incisor and cheek teeth, which interferes with prehension and mastication. In swine, brachygnathia superior may be confused with atrophic rhinitis. In Angus and Jersey cattle, brachygnathia superior occurs as a hereditary trait. In any species, it may be associated with chondrodysplasia and is also present with other facial defects.",

Brachygnathia inferior is a common defect in calves. It is inherited, probably as a simple autosomal recessive trait. There is a higher incidence in males. This condition in calves has been associated with cerebellar hypoplasia. In Aberdeen Angus cattle, the defect may occur concurrently with cerebellar hypoplasia, and with osteopetrosis in this and other breeds (see Vol. 1, Bones and joints). In Merino sheep, brachygnathia is associated with a cardiomegaly and renal hypoplasia syndrome that has an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern. Transplacental infection with Schmallenberg virus, an orthobunyavirus, will lead to brachygnathia among other congenital malformations in lambs and calves.

At the midline, they fuse with each other and with the nasal septum, and undergo intramembranous ossification, except in their caudal part, which becomes the soft palate. Inadequate growth of the palatine shelves leaves a central defect, in either or both of the hard and soft palates, which communicates between the oral and nasal cavities. Other manifestations of disordered palato-genesis include unilateral defects in the soft palate; bilateral hypoplasia of the soft palate; or dorsal displacement of the soft palate, with excess soft tissue on the caudal portion. Affected animals have difficulty sucking, may have nasal regurgitation, and usually die within the first few days of life from aspiration pneumonia.

Evaluation of dental disease necessitates a thorough examination of the oral cavity. The comments on dental development and anatomy are intended to provide a brief overview and assist the understanding of dental disease. Teeth develop from a band of ectoderm deep to the mucosal epithelium that spans the length of the gingiva. This ectodermal band is called the dental lamina. In the initial stage of tooth development, neural crest cells beneath the dental laminae induce multiple nodular thickenings along the length of the dental lamina. These are the tooth buds. Next, ectomesenchymal cells aggregate at the base of each tooth bud. The tooth bud then becomes a bell-shaped structure that grows down over the ectomesenchymal cells and becomes the enamel organ, which will give rise to enamel-producing ameloblasts. The ectomesenchyme below the enamel organ develops into the dental papilla, which will give rise to dentin-producing odontoblasts and also the tooth pulp. Ectomesenchyme cells also move around the periphery of the enamel organ to form a limiting sac called the dental follicle or dental sac. The dental sac will ultimately give rise to cementum-producing cells (cementoblasts), the periodontal ligament, and alveolar bone.",

In hypsodont teeth, enamel extends far down on the roots, and is invaginated into the dentin to form infundibula. Also, the hypsodont teeth of herbivores, except the mandibular premolars of ruminants, are covered by cementum, which more or less fills the infundibula. Exceptions to these rules are provided by the tusks of boars, which are hypsodont, but not covered by cementum, and by ruminant incisors, which are brachydont but do have enamel covering part of the root dentin and cementum covering the root enamel.",

Thus its composition is similar to that of bone, and like bone, it contains type I collagen. Dentin is produced by columnar cells with basal nuclei called odontoblasts, which differentiate from ectomesenchyme of the dental papilla. It is formed as unmineralized predentin. The odontoblasts move away from the dentin-enamel junction, gradually encroaching on the pulp cavity as they produce dentin. Each odontoblast has a process extending into the dentin, encased in a dentinal tubule, which arborizes at the dentin-enamel junction. The process also anastomoses with the processes of other odontoblasts.",

Dentigerous cysts enclose at least the crown of the tooth, but may include it all. Of the odontogenic cysts, all except those derived from cell rests of Malassez are potentially dentigerous (the rests of Malassez are the probable source of periodontal cysts). Dentigerous cysts originating in malformed enamel organs usually include malformed teeth. Teeth in cysts of reduced enamel epithelium or rests of dental laminae are also often abnormal. The most common forms of odontogenic dentigerous cysts in animals are those involving the vestigial wolf teeth of horses and the vestigial canines, especially of mares. The smaller cysts appear as tumors of the gums, whereas some of the larger ones may cause swelling of the jaw or adjacent maxillary sinus.

Steep angulation of the occlusal surfaces results from inadequate lateral movement of the jaws, and sharp edges form on the buccal aspect of the maxillary teeth and the lingual aspect of the mandibular teeth. This may be unilateral when the animal chews with only one side of its mouth, the other side then being affected. The teeth wear progressively sharper, and can result in the teeth passing each other like shear blades; hence the term shear mouth. Subnormal resistance to wear on the part of the molar teeth is common, and results in wave mouth (weave mouth) or step mouth, in which successive teeth in an arcade wear at different rates. The wave or step form of the antagonistic arcade is reversed, so that the teeth of the 2 arcades interdigitate.

In smooth-surface caries, plaque produces the acid and maintains a low pH on the surface of the tooth. Progression of lesions depends on various factors such as salivary pH, hardness and resistance to demineralization of enamel, and frequency of access to carbohydrate. Demineralization of enamel often occurs in the subsurface enamel but progresses to caries only with prolonged exposure to acid. Infrequent exposure allows remineralization of enamel between meals. The enzymes that lyse the organic matrix are probably produced by plaque, but may be derived from leukocytes, for which plaque is chemotactic. Carious enamel loses its sheen and becomes dull, white, and pocked. When dentin is exposed, it becomes brown or black. Dentin is softer and more readily demineralized than enamel, and a pinpoint lesion in enamel may lead to a large defect when the carious process reaches the dentin. Enamel loss to caries is permanent, whereas odontoblasts at the pulp/dentin junction can generate tertiary dentin in response to dentin damage and loss. Nerve endings have not been identified at the enamel-dentin junction, and the pain of caries is thought to be caused by chemical or pressure changes in the dentinal tubules. Neuropeptides, including substance P, are generated in the pulp and may enhance pain during caries.

Alterations in the periodontal flora may be responsible for these exacerbations. A major part of chronic periodontal disease is resorption of alveolar bone, which modifies the attachment site of the periodontal ligament. If concomitant bone loss precedes gingival recession, the sulcus is deepened to form a periodontal pocket, which is lined by transformed junctional \"pocket\" epithelium, and becomes the site of chronic active inflammation. When gingival recession precedes loss of alveolar bone and gingival collagen, pockets do not form, but tooth roots are exposed. In either case, destruction of the periodontium and periodontal ligament, resorb enamel and eventually dentin. A reddened swollen area of gingiva or granulation tissue often lies over the lesion, which may be on the labial or buccal aspect, and frequently is painful to touch. The resorptive lesions begin as shallow defects in the cementum, lined by odontoclasts, facing a somewhat disorganized periodontal ligament. They progress into the underlying dentin, and, with time, into the root canal. Either or both coronal and apical extension of lesions may occur. Extension of the process coronally more superficially undermines the enamel, which is resorbed or breaks off, causing destruction or loss of the crown. Extension of the dentinal lesion apically leads to resorption of the root. Remnants of the root may persist, often overgrown by gingiva, following loss of the crown. Conversely, destruction primarily of the root may result in obliteration of the periodontal ligament, resorption of adjacent alveolar bone, but with odontoalveolar ankylosis by reparative hard tissues, retaining the crown in the dental arcade. In addition to the odontoclasts that line the resorbing cementum or dentinal surfaces of the lesion, more advanced defects contain a mixed leukocyte population, macrophages, and disordered granulation tissue. Repair is often superimposed, with cementoblastic or osteoblastic cells producing new mineralized tissue of varied osteoid, bone, cementum, or osteodentin morphology. Pulpitis may occur in the affected root canal, and reparative dentin may be deposited there. The prevalence of such lesions has increased markedly in the past 40 years, suggesting an association with changes in form of diet, but the lesion is idiopathic, with no clear relationship to periodontitis, mechanical trauma, viral infections, or nutritional or metabolic disturbances.

It is characterized by acantholysis of the epidermis, which results in formation of flaccid bullae and erosions involving mainly mucocutaneous junctions, oral mucosa and, to a lesser extent, skin. Canine pemphigus vulgaris follows a similar pathogenesis to that of humans with overexpression of the proto-oncogene c-Myc before acantholysis and bullae formation. c-Myc overexpression is likely a consequence of anti-desmoglein 3 antibody binding to its target on basal keratinocytes. Clinically affected dogs and cats have erosions/ ulcerations of the oral mucosa and may drool. The oral lesions are generally more prominent than, and precede, the skin lesions. They are most obvious on the dorsal surface of the tongue, which is bright red, with a few scattered pink raised areas representing islands of normal mucosa. The lesions vary greatly in severity and distribution, although the hard palate is often severely ulcerated. Bullae are rarely seen in the oral cavity, because they ulcerate rapidly.

There is a variable lymphocytic and plasmacytic lichenoid reaction in the propria. The presence of suprabasilar clefts and bullae caused by acantholysis is considered to be diagnostic of pemphigus vulgaris. However, extensive erosion and ulceration of the mucosa and secondary bacterial infections frequently obscure these clefts and bullae. Several biopsies from different areas of the oral mucosa may be required to demonstrate the characteristic lesions. A presumptive histologic diagnosis should be supported by direct immunofluorescence tests that show mainly anaerobes such as Actinomyces, Fusobacterium, and spirochetes, which exist in balance with each other and in harmony with the host. Disruption of this microfloral balance may lead to stomatitis. The oral mucosa is quite resistant to microbial invasion for several reasons. These include the squamous mucosal lining; antibacterial constituents of saliva such as lysozyme; immunoglobulins, especially immunoglobulin A (IgA), in oral secretions; and the presence of a rich submucosal vascular network and inflammatory cells. Factors altering the balance of indigenous organisms are not well delineated. Systemic illness, stress, and nutritional and hormonal imbalances may alter the microbial population by altering the amount, composition, and pH of saliva.

In horses, exuberant granulation tissue of periodontal origin sometimes develops at the site of extracted teeth to produce a tumor-like mass in the dental arcade. Epithelial remnants and proliferative bone may be associated with the granulation tissue in such cases. Peripheral giant cell granuloma (formerly giant cell epulis) occurs in dogs and cats as gingival masses, often red, that may be smooth and sessile, or pedunculated. Giant cell granuloma is the second most common gingival tumor in cats after fibromatous epulis. These lesions may not be true granulomas. Very occasionally, similar lesions, described as central giant cell granulomas, occur more deeply in the jaw. The gingival epithelium is hyperplastic or ulcerated and extends deeply into the underlying mass, which is well vascularized and often contains hemosiderin-laden cells. Characteristic of the tumor are numerous multinucleated giant cells, with multiple central nuclei and abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm, which are located in a densely cellular stroma. The nature of the giant cells is not fully known, and it is suggested that they may be osteoclastic in origin. Foci of hard tissue, including mineralized osteoid, may be present. Giant cell granulomas are regarded as hyperplastic, and have occurred at the site of tooth extraction.",

They communicate with the erosions, ulcers, or superficial fibrinonecrotic debris. Such damage is most common in the distal esophagus, but in some instances can extend to the pharynx. Epithelial hyperplasia and neutrophilic exocytosis occur in response to mild superficial epithelial necrosis. A consequence of chronic gastroesophageal reflux, well recognized in humans and described in dogs and cats, is columnar and mucous cell metaplasia of the distal esophagus. In humans, the lesion is known as Barrett esophagus and is an important risk factor for development of esophageal adenocarcinoma, but this has not been clearly demonstrated in animals.",

However, because most of this occurs as a chemical process with minimal morphologic correlates, it is an organ that often seems to be overlooked by pathologists. Examination of ruminal contents may provide critical cues with respect to general metabolic states. Overly dry contents are an excellent indicator of dehydration. Voluminous frothy contents occur with primary bloat. Urea toxicity can be detected by an ammoniacal odor and alkaline pH. An odor of cooked turnips or a pungent insecticidal smell is suggestive of organophosphates. In grain overload, contents have a fermentative odor and pH may be <5.0. However, with putrefaction and release of toxic amines into the rumen, pH in cases of acidosis may return to near-normal levels. In these animals, the ruminal epithelium remains adherent to the submucosa despite any intervening postmortem changes, and it is an important clue to mucosal disease. Vagus indigestion, often associated with dysfunction of the esophageal groove, leads to accumulation of large volumes of watery fluid within the forestomachs. The rumen content of animals with Taxus spp. toxicity will have an aromatic odor like cedar several weeks of infection. Following 2-4 months in a granuloma in the aortic adventitia, worms migrate to the subjacent esophagus where they develop to adulthood. Here the adult nematodes are found within large, thick-walled cystic granulomas in the submucosa of the distal esophagus or gastric cardia. A fistula leading to the esophageal lumen is usually present, through which the tail of the female worm may protrude, and which provides the outlet for ova to the gastrointestinal tract ( Fig. 1-26 ). Larvae that adopt aberrant migratory pathways may be found in granulomas in sites such as the subcutis, bladder, kidney, spinal cord, as well as stomach and intrathoracic locations. Aortic lesions associated with Spirocerca are described in Vol. 3, Cardiovascular system, but include intimal and medial hemorrhage and necrosis with eosinophilic inflammation; intimal roughening with thrombosis; aneurysm with rare aortic rupture; intimal and medial mineralization, and heterotopic bone deposition. The presence of persistent aortic lesions in the dog, even in the absence of esophageal granuloma, is evidence of prior infection with S. lupi. Caudal thoracic vertebral body spondylitis occurs in greater than half of cases and is characterized by exostoses or bony spurs arising from the ends of the vertebral bodies.

Primary tympany is also called frothy bloat. Foam production in ruminal contents occurs normally. However, the amount of foam produced is small and unstable. There is apparently a delicate balance between profoaming and antifoaming factors in the rumen. These factors are multiple, and there is considerable controversy as to the extent to which each one influences the production of the foamy, viscous ruminal content so characteristic of frothy bloat, the most common cause of rumen distension.",

Other legumes, notably sainfoin, trefoil, and cicer milk vetch, are not associated with bloat. Soluble proteins, released from chloroplasts, are degraded by the rumen microflora, and they rise to the surface where they are denatured, become insoluble, and stabilize the foam. The optimal pH (isoelectric point) for foam production by soluble proteins ranges from 5.4 to 6.0. Pectins are considered to increase viscosity of ruminal fluid and may act as foam-stabilizing agents. Plant lipids may act as antifoaming agents by competing for metal ions with the soluble proteins, thus inhibiting the denaturation of these proteins and resulting in decreased foam production.",

Sheep, and especially goats, are also susceptible to this problem. Its importance lies partly in loss of production and partly in mortality because of the acute disease, in which rumenitis is of minor significance and lactic acidosis is the major cause of morbidity and mortality. but many types of bacteria are also lost. In those animals that survive the acute phase of ruminal acidosis, recovery is not complete until a normal ruminal flora is re-established through contact with other animals or by transplant of ruminal content from healthy animals. Temporary recovery may be followed by what appears clinically to be a relapse in acidosis, but which is a developing mycotic rumenitis. If treatment of the initial fluid imbalance is delayed, death may occur in a week or so from ischemic renal cortical necrosis. The gross findings in this metabolic disease are not specific, and a practical diagnosis requires knowledge of access to fermentable carbohydrate and a clinically observed circulatory failure. At autopsy, the eyes are sunken, the blood may be thick and dark because of dehydration and hypoxia, and there is general venous congestion. The appearance of the ruminal contents varies with the time interval between ingestion of the carbohydrate and the autopsy. In the early stages, there is a copious amount of porridge-like rumen content, which has a distinct fermentative odor. The amount of grain, corn, or other source of starch varies considerably and is an unreliable indication of acidosis, and the presence of finely ground concentrate may be overlooked. Ruminal pH is only helpful when it is low (<5.0) because it may rise in later stages of the disease. Although the ruminal contents may appear relatively normal in more advanced cases of acidosis, intestinal contents tend to remain very watery.

Ingestion of Datura sp. seeds, which contain a parasympatholytic alkaloid, can also cause ileus, leading to gastric dilation. Primary gastric dilation in horses is a sequel to consumption of excess fermentable carbohydrate, sudden access to lush pasture, or excessive intake of water. Dilation associated with intake of fermentable feed is likely analogous to grain overload in cattle. Ingesta may swell through absorption of saliva and gastric secretion. Evolution of gas and organic acids, including lactic acid, by bacterial fermentation of carbohydrate, occurs in the cranial portion of the stomach. An influx of water follows as the result of increased osmotic pressure in the stomach, contributing to increased distension and to systemic dehydration. Animals surviving for any time with acute gastric dilation of this type may develop laminitis. Gastric rupture may follow primary or secondary dilation of the equine stomach; it may be idiopathic, in that no clear cause is identified. Gastric rupture is diagnosed in \u223c5% of horses with colic admitted to veterinary hospitals. Rupture usually occurs along the greater curvature, parallel to the omental attachment, releasing gastric content into the omental bursa or the abdominal cavity. Death ensues acutely as the result of shock and peritonitis. The margins of the laceration show evidence of antemortem hemorrhage, which differentiates the lesion from postmortem rupture of a dilated stomach. There also may be congestion of the cervical esophagus and blanching of the thoracic esophagus, producing a prominent bloat line. This, and compression atelectasis of the lungs in some cases, attests to the tremendous increase in intraabdominal and intrathoracic pressure exerted by the dilated stomach before rupture.

Because mucosal and muscular lesions can be present independently, they may have separate causes. The mucosal hypertrophy has features in common with hypertrophic gastritis, described elsewhere. The cardinal presenting sign is chronic intermittent vomition, perhaps with weight loss, and with gastric distention in a few cases. Gross examination, by gastroscopy, at gastrotomy, or autopsy, in most cases reveals enlarged mucosal folds surrounding and obstructing the pyloric canal. This reflects completely occluded in volvulus, which may involve rotation of up to 270-360\u00b0.

Salmonellosis and Escherichia coli septicemia in all species, and in addition, in swine, postweaning coliform gastroenteritis, erysipelas, swine dysentery, and Glasser's disease are associated with the lesion. Porcine dermatopathy and nephropathy syndrome has also been associated with gastric infarction. The fundic mucosa is bright red or deep red-black and may have excess mucus or perhaps fibrin on the surface. Occasionally the superficial mucosa is obviously necrotic, adopting a yellowbrown caseous appearance, and may lift off with the ingesta. In section there is thrombosis of venules in the mucosa and often at the mucosal-submucosal junction, usually with prominent fibrin plugs. Thrombosed capillaries and venules may be present at any level of the mucosa, along the base of the ischemic zone of superficial coagulative necrosis, with local hemorrhage and edema. There may be an acute inflammatory reaction delineating the necrotic area in the mucosa. Sometimes the full thickness of the gastric mucosa, focally or diffusely, may be necrotic. decreased intake in feed in the face of continued normal renal excretion, place these animals in perilous physiologic circumstances, often before inanition becomes a significant factor.

No morphologic gross or microscopic lesions of the stomach, vagus nerve, or other organs have been found, except scattered chromatolytic and necrotic neurons in the celiacomesenteric autonomic ganglion.

The picture that has emerged is a confusing one because of substantial flux in the taxonomy of the various gastric spiral organisms, and because of the existence of many different species of Helicobacter (only some of which have been successfully cultivated). At least 20 different Helicobacter species, distinguished by mRNA sequencing, have been reported from various mammalian species.

Furthermore, wild cheetahs have the same Helicobacter colonization, but not the gastritis. In dogs and cats, it is routine to see various spiral organisms colonizing the gastric surface and within canaliculi in parietal cells in normal animals and in those with gastrointestinal disease. Depending on detection methods, the prevalence of colonization is at least 50% and may be nearly universal in adults. The prevalence of such colonization as determined by direct visualization or by culture is as high in clinically healthy animals as in those with clinical signs of gastritis. On the other hand, there are several studies claiming that dogs or cats with natural or experimental Helicobacter infection have a higher prevalence of mucosal mononuclear leukocytes and mucosal lymphoid follicles, and faster mucosal turnover, than is seen in animals in which Helicobacter infection could not be demonstrated. The problem is that the modest histologic changes have not been correlated with the development of clinical disease. The changes described resemble the kind of changes seen elsewhere in the intestinal tract with, for example, acquisition of the normal flora by germfree animals, or even as part of normal immunologic maturation of the gastrointestinal tract.

In pathology, the term is often used with equal imprecision, referring to a wide range of gastric injury in which histologic criteria of inflammation may not be particularly prominent. Under the broad umbrella of gastritis fall several different types of lesions: gastric mucosal necrosis, erosion or ulceration caused by mechanical, chemical, or ischemic insults, among which is uremic gastritis, described earlier; true gastritis, in which the lamina propria contains the leukocytic and vascular changes characteristic of inflammation; and finally, lesions of gastric mucosal atrophy, fibrosis, and lymphofollicular hyperplasia that arguably are the residual lesions of previous active inflammatory disease. Chemical gastritis or abomasitis, reflected in diffuse gastric congestion, hemorrhage, necrosis, and ulceration, may be induced by chemicals such as arsenic, thallium, formalin, bronopol, steroidal and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), phosphatic fertilizers, and by the toxic principle in bitterweed (Hymenoxon odorata). Blister beetle (Epicauta spp.) intoxication in horses, induced by the cantharidin contained in these insects, may cause necrosis and ulceration of the distal esophagus and pars esophagea, and intense hyperemia of the glandular mucosa of the stomach, and in some cases gastric ulcers and rupture. In addition, enterocolitis, nephrosis, hemorrhages of the urinary bladder, and myocardial hemorrhage and necrosis are reported with regularity in blister beetle toxicosis. Zinc may cause acute mortality, in which the mucosa of the abomasum and duodenum is a distinctive lime green and necrotic, with an underlying congested, edematous submucosa. Microscopically, radiating crystals are evident in the necrotic tissue. Subacute zinc intoxication may be reflected in abomasal damage characterized by exfoliation of glandular epithelium, ablation of glands in some areas, and reparative proliferation of mucous neck cells, in addition to fibrosing pancreatitis and mild nephrosis. In sheep, type-A trichothecene mycotoxin has been associated with rumenitis and abomasal ulceration in acute toxicity. Mechanical gastritis is most commonly seen in dogs after ingestion of coarse foreign materials and in cats with hairballs. The lesion is discovered as an incidental finding when careful clinicians biopsy the stomach via endoscopy when making the diagnosis of gastric foreign body, or at the time of surgical removal of that foreign material. Hairballs in the abomasum of ruminants are associated with lack of roughage in young animals, but virtually never with disease.",

Compromised resistance, perhaps associated with endotoxemia, septicemia, endogenous or exogenous steroids, neoplasia, lympholytic viral disease, and altered gastrointestinal flora caused by antibiotic therapy, may further promote mycosis. Fungal hyphae attaining the submucosa typically invade venules and arterioles, causing thrombosis and hemorrhagic infarction. The agents involved are usually zygomycetes (phycomycetes) such as Rhizopus, Absidia, or Mucor; rarely, Aspergillus may be implicated. The lesions are areas of necrosis, with an intensely congested or hemorrhagic periphery, ranging in diameter from 1 to 2 cm, to confluence over much of the body of the stomach ( Fig.  1-38A ). Affected mucosa is thickened, red or pale in the necrotic zone, and may be covered by hemorrhage. Edema and hemorrhage are evident in the submucosa. The lesion may penetrate to the serosa, where it is typically seen as a roughly circular area of hemorrhage in the external muscle and subserosa. Hyphae, usually broad and nonseptate zygomycotic in type, are present in sections of the necrotic mucosa, submucosa, and invading vessels, where they initiate thrombosis ( Fig.  1-38B ).Candidiasis of the pars esophagea may occur in swine, often in association with preulcerative epithelial hyperplasia and parakeratosis.

            "text": "There is little disagreement over the morphology of ulceration of the pars esophagea, although its etiopathogenesis has been controversial. Many factors have been implicated in the etiology. Stressful husbandry practices have been considered to contribute to development of ulcer, although glucocorticoid administration results in lesions of the fundus, not pars esophagea, in pigs. Environment has been identified as a factor, for example, pigs held on slatted floors have a higher incidence of nonglandular ulcers than pigs on solid or straw flooring. High dietary copper levels, feeding of whey, starchy diets low in protein, high levels of dietary unsaturated fatty acids, and microbial production of short-chain fatty acids have been associated with the development of ulcers. Experimental infection with Ascaris suum has been associated with ulcer, but natural infection is not considered causally associated. Although an association between the presence of Helicobacter heilmannii and ulceration has been proposed in pigs, this has not been strongly substantiated, and gastric ulcers in pigs involve squamous, rather than glandular, mucosa. Experimentally in gnotobiotic pigs, H. heilmannii has been shown to induce ulcers in the squamous portion of the stomach of pigs fed a ration high in carbohydrate. Experimentally, factors stimulating acid secretion, especially histamine, consistently cause ulcers of the pars esophagea, suggesting that gastric acidity may play an etiologic role. Repeatedly, finely ground rations have been found to be ulcerogenic, and this may be the single most important predisposing factor. Squamous epithelium has no innate buffering capacity, and it is highly susceptible to attack by gastric acid, pepsin, and refluxed bile, as occurs in reflux esophagitis. Similar events may initiate ulceration of the pars esophagea. Swine with gastric ulcers usually have abnormally fluid stomach contents. Feeding of finely divided rations and prolonged fasting are associated experimentally with increased water in stomach content. Normally there is a declining gradient of pH from esophagus to pylorus in stomach ingesta. Abnormally fluid gastric content fails to partition properly, and the pH gradient from esophagus to pylorus is not established. Relatively low pH occurs at the esophageal end of the stomach, where hydrochloric acid, pepsin, and refluxed bile, along with short-chain fatty acids produced by microbial fermentation of carbohydrate, synergistically attack the squamous mucosa. Meanwhile, the pH at the pylorus is higher than normal. Under conditions of prolonged gastric distention and relatively high antral pH, gastrin-stimulated acid secretion may be excessive, promoting that insult.",

The pathogenesis of ulceration in the pars esophagea in horses probably resembles that in swine.

Myofibroblastic pacemaker cells of the intestine, known as interstitial cells of Cajal, are distributed throughout the intestinal musculature, integrated with the extrinsic and enteric nervous systems.

Ultimately, fecal water may be hypotonic with respect to plasma. Absorption of volatile fatty acids also accounts for considerable water absorption from the colon. Potassium increases in concentration in colonic content as sodium concentration declines; this is due to an active secretory process and a passive response to transepithelial electrochemical gradients.",

Some products of intrinsic and extrinsic neurons, such as vasoactive intestinal polypeptide and acetylcholine, may stimulate secretion, whereas others, such as somatostatin and norepinephrine, are absorptive or antisecretory. Local paracrine effects are mediated by the products of enteroendocrine cells, such as somatostatin, neurotensin, and serotonin. Guanylin is a peptide secreted from epithelial cells that stimulates local fluid secretion. Mesenchymal elements in the lamina propria, including myofibroblasts, lymphocytes, mast cells, macrophages, and other inflammatory and connective tissue cells, also produce locally active substances with a direct or indirect effect on epithelial function.

This is important in so-called smallbowel diarrhea, where the lesion is in the small intestine. Because the colon has reserve absorptive capacity, the excess volume entering from the ileum must be considerable for diarrhea to occur. The large capacity and fermentative function of the equine colon may mitigate to some extent the expression of small-bowel diarrhea in mature horses. Large-bowel diarrhea, on the other hand, reflects an intrinsically reduced capacity of the colon to handle even normal volumes of fluid and electrolyte presented to it by the small intestine. most species, lactase levels decline with age, and malabsorption in dogs has been attributed to low levels of lactase. The poorly differentiated surface epithelium present on atrophic villi may lack the full complement of enzymes on the brush border and in the cytoplasm necessary for nutrient digestion and assimilation. Lectins present in uncooked beans attach to and damage microvilli on enterocytes, which may explain the malabsorption and diarrhea associated with their use in feeds; lectins also promote bacterial adhesion and overgrowth in the small intestine. A heritable syndrome of gluten-sensitive enteropathy is reported in Irish Setter dogs, and is characterized by villus atrophy, increased intraepithelial lymphocytes, and abnormal levels of mucosal microvillar hydrolases. Cobalamin malabsorption has been described as a hereditary defect in Beagles, Australian Shepherd Dogs, Chinese Shar-Peis, Giant Schnauzers, and Border Collies, resulting in anemia and failure to thrive. Delivery of nutrients, especially lipid, to the circulation, may be impaired in lymphangiectasia. The pathogenesis of malabsorption of the major classes of nutrients will be considered briefly.",

Mostly this is a result of pancreatic atrophy or fibrosis; however, it also may be due to failure by atrophic intestinal mucosa to release the cholecystokinin necessary to stimulate pancreatic secretions. Reduced surface area for lipid uptake also may contribute to malabsorption of fat. The availability of bile salts is reduced in intrahepatic cholestasis, biliary obstruction, or by depletion resulting from reduced ileal absorption following resection or atrophy. Thus fatty acid and monoglyceride are not emulsified and are therefore not as accessible to absorptive enterocytes. Poorly differentiated enterocytes may be less able than normal epithelium to re-esterify long-chain fatty acids to triglyceride and to produce chylomicrons for export from the cell.

This is rapidly absorbed and buffered in the colon under normal circumstances; however, a heavy carbohydrate load may overwhelm the colonic buffering capacity, and cause reduced pH.

Smallbowel diarrhea is characterized by infrequent passage of large amounts of fluid feces. Secretory diarrhea is due to an excess of secretion over absorption of fluid, resulting from derangement of normal secretory and absorptive mechanisms. It is best exemplified by the effects of diarrheagenic bacterial enterotoxins. Vibrio cholerae and Escherichia coli are the most important sources of such toxins, though only the latter occurs in domestic animals; some Salmonella serotypes, Yersinia enterocolitica, and Shigella also produce enterotoxin. Cholera and heat-labile E. coli enterotoxin act through the mediation of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). Toxin-stimulated cAMP shuts down sodium chloride cotransport at the luminal cell membrane of enterocytes, reducing passive water absorption. Meanwhile, cAMP-stimulated chloride secretion is promoted, and water follows. The resultant increase in secretion and decrease in absorption increase the solute and water load passing from the small bowel to the colon. Heat-stable E. coli and Y. enterocolitica enterotoxins stimulate cyclic guanosine monophosphatemediated secretion by the mucosa.",

A predisposition for male calves has been described, but this is not consistent among studies. An association has been postulated between pressure on the amniotic vesicle during palpation of the embryo for pregnancy diagnosis before 42 days of gestation, and the development of atresia coli in calves; however, the mechanism of this effect is uncertain. Atresia intestinalis is less common. Atresia ilei is most prevalent in calves, and rare in foals, lambs, piglets, and pups. These lesions prevent normal movement of gut content and meconium and therefore lead to dilation of the proximal segment and progressive abdominal distention, which may become so extensive in an affected fetus to cause dystocia.

Atresia ani may be an isolated abnormality, but is more commonly associated with other malformations, especially of the distal spinal column (spinal dysraphism, sacral or coccygeal vertebral agenesis), genitourinary tract (rectovaginal fistula, renal agenesis, horseshoe kidney, polycystic kidneys, cryptorchidism, duplication of scrotum or penis), and occasionally with intestinal atresia or agenesis of the colon. Vitamin A deficiency during pregnancy has been associated with increased risk of congenital ano-rectal malformations in several species; this is thought to be related to improper development of the enteric nervous system. Short colon has been reported in dogs and cats, and is probably the result of abnormal rotation of the midgut and failure to lengthen during fetal life.

Obstipation of the colon in dogs may result from voluntarily suppressed defecation caused by pain from inflammation or neoplasia involving the prostate gland or anal sacs. Impaction with foreign bodies, such as hair or fine bones in the colon or rectum, or the result of stenosis caused by tumors or strictures, is less common. Colonic obstipation also may be associated with trauma to the pelvic area or spinal cord; it is described in Manx cats because of sacral spinal cord anomalies. Megacolon ensues if the obstruction persists; however, in small animals megacolon is frequently idiopathic. Examination of the syndrome in cats reveals no histologic abnormalities and it is suggested that the underlying problem is a disturbance in the activation of smooth-muscle myofilaments. Impaction of the cecum or colon in horses occur mostly where the lumen narrows at the pelvic flexure and transverse or small colon. Impaction may be precipitated by water deprivation, a dietary change to rough hay or chaff, or poor dentition; recurrent impaction is seen in animals with dental problems. Abnormal motility resulting from altered colonic or cecal peristalsis may explain impaction in the absence of other predisposing causes and is discussed later with pseudoobstructions of the gut. Ingestion of indigestible synthetic fibers has been associated with colonic impaction. In horses grazing poorly covered sandy soils, sand may cause chronic colitis and diarrhea or it may sediment, accumulate, and cause impaction at any level of the large or small colon. Sand impaction in horses is often associated with concurrent displacement or torsion. Ingestion of large numbers of acorns and leaves may also cause impaction of the intestinal tract in ruminants.

Response to medical therapy and dissolution of phytobezoars has been reported in horses. Hairballs (trichobezoars) sometimes occur in dogs, cats, and ruminants; in ruminants they occur mostly in the forestomachs ( Fig. 1-44 ) and abomasum but can also cause small intestinal obstruction.

They may obstruct the gut if they become impacted, usually where season and the gastrointestinal tract is most affected. Grass sickness can occur acutely as colic, tympany, and drooling with rapid progression and is nearly always fatal, usually within 7 days. The condition can also occur as chronic colic of >7 days duration, usually characterized by weight loss or dysphagia. Horses with this form may survive with appropriate management. In acute cases, postmortem findings include gastric and small intestinal distention; often there is esophageal ulceration caused by reflux. In chronic cases gross lesions are often not present except for marked emaciation. There also may be impaction of the colon and cecum by dehydrated ingesta in cases of longer duration.

It has been estimated that 40 liters of fluid may accumulate in the wall of a horse colon that has undergone volvulus. Bloody fluid content and gas distend the lumen of the infarcted segment. As gangrene of the intestinal wall proceeds, the tissue becomes green-black, and septic peritonitis eventually ensues, with or without perforation of the bowel. Advanced venous infarction involves the full thickness of the intestinal wall, and the initiating intestinal accident is commonly evident, except in cases subjected to surgery. Even if a displacement has been reduced, the limits of the infarcted segment are usually relatively sharply demarcated, and the acute inflammatory cells prevails until epithelium extends to cover the eroded surface fully. Partial damage to the proliferative compartment initially results in dilation of crypts, which are lined by flattened epithelium resembling that seen after radiation injury. If the amplifier population of progenitor cells can be regenerated, hyperplastic basophilic cells will populate crypts until the mucosal architecture is reconstituted ( Fig. 1-46) .",

Countercurrent transfer of oxygen from the afferent to efferent vessels in the villus aggravates hypoxemia in the villus by increased shunting of oxygen to the efferent venule.

The syndrome is usually characterized clinically by sudden death, although a few affected animals may have blood in their feces, bloat and acute abdominal pain for a short time before death. At postmortem examination, there are one or more short jejunal loops with intramural hemorrhage (Fig. 1-55A ). The latter usually distends the intestinal mucosa to the point of complete or partial obstruction of the intestinal lumen ( Fig. 1-55B) . Intraluminal hemorrhage is also present in some cases. Determination of the primary location of the hemorrhage (intramural versus intraluminal) requires careful dissection, as in the cases of intramural hemorrhage, the compressed and thin intestinal mucosa frequently tears when the intestine is opened, giving the false impression that the blood is intraluminal rather than intramural. Microscopically, the interface between the hematoma and nonhematoma portions of the jejunum has an abrupt elevation of the mucosa, and the muscularis mucosa is often split by severe hemorrhage, with one portion adherent to the submucosa and the other to the lamina propria. The elevated mucosa may be completely necrotic or have only necrosis of the surface epithelium. Often, the affected mucosa has moderate to large numbers of large, gram-positive rods on the luminal surface. Because the percentage of gram-positive rods was found to increase with the degree of autolysis, it has been postulated that this bacterial population is a consequence rather than a cause of the condition. The affected mucosa, but also the more normal looking adjacent mucosa, has dilated villus lacteals that are either empty or contain abundant erythrocytes and/or pale eosinophilic, hyalinized material. Occasionally there are small numbers of hemosiderophages in the lamina propria of the affected mucosa. In a few cases, the mucosa may show mild to moderate edema, mild neutrophilic infiltration and small foci of submucosal hemorrhage. Submucosal blood vessels in these areas are usually within normal limits but a small percentage of cases may have mild to moderate vasculopathy with hyaline change of the vessel wall, mild pleocellular perivascular and subintimal inflammatory infiltrates and plump lining endothelium. Focal suppurative peritonitis can rarely be seen in affected areas of the jejunum. The cause of this entity is not known. A B factor for these changes. In a study of 30 equids referred to a medical teaching hospital with a diagnosis of oleander intoxication, 85% had gastrointestinal signs included colic, diarrhea, gastric reflux, intestinal hyper- or hypo-motility, and abdominal distention.

In section, villi may be of normal length or somewhat blunt or stubby, with some hypertrophy of crypts. The surface epithelium may appear normal or perhaps slightly attenuated, and lateral interepithelial spaces are often dilated. The lacteals in many villi are distended, and lymphatics in deeper portions of the mucosa, submucosa, and muscularis usually are as well. Occasional lipid-laden macrophages are present in and around lacteals and lymphatics; large focal accumulations of lipophages around lymphatics, sometimes with a local granulomatous response to lipid or saponified fat, form the white masses that may be seen grossly. A similar reaction may be present in the draining lymph nodes. The lamina propria is edematous, as are the submucosa and deeper portions of the gut wall.

However, the thoroughness of the clinical and laboratory investigation before the use of endoscopic biopsy is influenced by the amount of time and money available to evaluate what are often elusive functional entities. Endoscopic biopsies are often done early, after symptomatic medical therapy has failed to control clinical signs. The microscopic findings commonly associated with inflammatory bowel disease are not specific, and reflect chronic mucosal inflammation resulting from a number of potential etiologies.

Eosinophils have more variation, and often are present in very large numbers throughout the small intestinal mucosa. However, they are very sparse within the superficial half of the canine colonic mucosa, and are infrequent within the gastric mucosa. Because the normal stomach has relatively few mucosal leukocytes, the pursuit of a diagnosis of gastritis based upon objective assessment of leukocyte numbers may be a credible goal. Although it has been possible, by counting different types of leukocytes identified by routine histology and immunohistochemistry, to establish reference intervals for eosinophils, plasma cells, B cells, and T cells within various parts of the gastric lamina propria of healthy dogs, more than half of the round cells in the normal canine gastric lamina propria could not be precisely identified. Healthy dogs had an 8-fold range in total mucosal cellularity, and the pyloric antrum was 3 times more cellular than the fundic mucosa. Although dogs with clinical signs of gastritis had an objective increase in eosinophils, plasma cells, and/or intraepithelial lymphocytes in many different combinations, it was difficult to correlate clinical severity or response to therapy with cellular or other parameters of gastric mucosal abnormality. There was no significance to whether the inflammation was limited to the superficial third of the mucosa or was found throughout, although the former was more common than the latter. In a second study of idiopathic gastritis, all cases were classified as lymphocytic, and T cells predominated. Eosinophils were not a significant component, and there was no observed regional variation in severity.",

Similar to humans with IBD, it is likely that multiple factors, including genetics, mucosal immunity, intestinal microbiota, diet, and environment, play a role in pathogenesis. A familial role in dogs is established with enteropathies documented in multiple breeds including Boxers, Basenjis, German Shepherds, and Irish Setters. As molecular techniques to detect intestinal microbes improve, alterations in the intestinal microbial communities in dogs and cats have been detected. Shifts in the major microbial constituents, from gram-positive Firmicutes species to gram-negative proteobacteria in the gut have been noted in healthy animals versus those with intestinal inflammation. These alterations in the composition of the intestinal microbiota have been termed dysbiosis. Dysbiosis correlates with mucosal inflammation and may be a driver of persistent inflammation. Potential pathogens, such as invasive species of E. coli in Boxer dogs and French Bulldogs with granulomatous colitis, have been identified. Diet also appears to be important with a significant percentage of dogs and cats with chronic enteropathy responding favorably to dietary changes. An immunologic basis for this sensitivity is not always determined and adverse food reaction may be better terms than food allergy.

Ulcerative colitis with perforation has been reported in dogs with uremia, but the mechanism is uncertain. Given the frequency of concurrent vascular lesions including arteritis, fibrinoid necrosis, and mineralization, colonic mucosal damage may be related to mucosal ischemia or a variety of toxins, including increased ammonia formed by bacterial urease in the colon. Trichuris vulpis, the canine whipworm, causes acute or chronic mucosal colitis or typhlitis; in heavy infestations, there may be significant blood loss because of mucosal damage inflicted by the nematodes. Clinical trichuriasis is generally associated with adult trichurid nematodes extending from the cecum and proximal ascending colon into more distal parts of the large intestine. Ulcerative colitis in dogs is also rarely caused by Entamoeba histolytica. Ulcerative granulomatous transmural colitis is common as an enteric manifestation of infection with Histoplasma capsulatum. The alga Prototheca is a rare cause of enterocolitis as part of systemic disease in dogs. Leishmaniasis in dogs is often a multisystemic disease, but chronic mixed-cell inflammatory infiltration of the colon along with numerous L. infantum amastigotes is usually observed. Canine parvovirus 2 causes colonic damage, but in virtually all cases, there are more severe lesions elsewhere, notably in the small intestine.

Brachyspira spp. may be present in the canine colon and may be associated with diarrheal disease; however, their role in disease remains controversial.

Mycotic colitis has been reported in cats as a hemorrhagic ulcerative colitis with microvascular thrombosis and mucosal invasion by Candida, zygomycetes, or Aspergillus; these are probably secondary to colonic damage and leukopenia caused by FPLV. Clostridium piliforme is reported as a cause of mild mucosal colitis in kittens, also probably occurring primarily in kittens immunocompromised by FPLV infection. The lesions include focal necrosis, dilation of crypts, exfoliation of epithelial cells, and neutrophilic inflammation. C. piliforme was recognized by histology, immunohistochemistry, and ultrastructure.",

As these clusters seem to expand, the lymphocytes infiltrate into the overlying epithelium, obliterating the distinction between lamina propria and epithelium. Unlike inflammatory bowel disease, such lesions may be very patchy, and there is no concurrent increase in plasma cells or eosinophils. With time, the lymphocyte population appears to expand throughout the lamina propria and then transmurally. Sixty percent of intestinal T-cell lymphomas have been reported to be epitheliotropic. Microscopically this is demonstrated by increased numbers of intraepithelial lymphocytes within villus and crypt epithelium. The syndrome shares substantial clinical overlap with inflammatory bowel disease in that it is often slowly progressive and it is usually not accompanied by clinical signs related to neoplastic infiltration of liver, spleen, or lymph node, even though there is often microscopic tumor within those organs. The extent of microscopic disease within the intestine is usually much greater than the macroscopic impression at the time of surgery. Determination of T-cell receptor (TCR) rearrangement clonality using PCR has been shown to be an accurate method of diagnosis of small cell lymphoma in cats. Large cell/lymphoblastic lymphoma, in contrast, is characterized by a rapidly progressing transmural lesion that is usually accompanied by clinically palpable intestinal masses and by markedly enlarged mesenteric lymph nodes. Cats of any age may be affected. Most of these are reported as B-cell tumors, although not all investigators concur, and the majority of these high-grade lymphomas have not been subjected to immunophenotyping. It is likely that the incidence of T-cell lymphoma has been underestimated. B-cell lymphomas have been shown to be most common in the stomach and ileocecocolic junction, whereas T-cell lymphomas are most common in the proximal small intestine, especially the jejunum. The tumor resembles canine lymphomas, in that there is usually transmural effacement of intestinal architecture, and obliteration of the structure of affected mesenteric lymph nodes. Many cases differ from canine lymphomas, however, in having marked cellular pleomorphism. The tumor cells may have fairly abundant cytoplasm, nuclear cleavage, and up to 2-fold anisokaryosis. Descriptive names such as \"histiocytic lymphoma\" for some of these more anaplastic variants are no longer appropriate because immunophenotyping is available to identify the cells more precisely.

            "text": "Enteritis is often not grossly recognized in the small bowel at necropsy of animals with intestinal helminthosis. Therefore the pathologist needs a high index of suspicion to come to a diagnosis in some cases. To make a firm diagnosis of intestinal helminthosis, it is necessary to demonstrate substantial populations of nematodes by worm count in intestinal content or digests, and ideally to observe villus atrophy in tissue sections of infected intestine. These findings should be associated with a compatible syndrome-in the case of Ostertagia, Strongyloides, and the intestinal trichostrongyles, inefficient weight gain or wasting, and usually diarrhea. The hematophagous genera Haemonchus and Bunostomum cause anemia and hypoproteinemia, and associated poor growth but without diarrhea. Oesophagostomum radiatum, in the colon, may result in foals, although their role in diarrhea of foals has not been ruled out yet. Actinobacillus equuli may cause severe diarrhea and hemorrhagic enteritis, with lesions of bacteremia evident in other organs at autopsy. Salmonellosis in foals may be seen as fatal diarrhea with few gross lesions, or as fibrinous enterocolitis and septicemia, similar to that seen in older horses. Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae, with occasional gram-positive infections, are common causes of neonatal septicemia and possibly diarrhea, predisposed by failure of passive transfer of immunoglobulin. Fibrinonecrotic enterocolitis in foals <1 week of age may be due to C. perfringens type C, C. difficile, or co-infection by both microorganisms. C. perfringens type B infection has been reported rarely in foals; the disease has not been diagnosed in North America. Rhodococcus equi may cause chronic diarrhea and wasting in foals. Pyogranulomatous ulcerative lesions of the large bowel, and purulent mesenteric lymphadenitis, often associated with chronic purulent bronchopneumonia, are characteristically found in R. equi infection. Enterococcus (Streptococcus) durans, an enteroadherent coccus, has been associated with diarrhea in a foal. Moderate atrophy of villi covered with adherent gram-positive cocci was characteristic; the large bowel not being colonized. Strongyloides westeri is capable of causing diarrhea in young foals occasionally. Tyzzer's disease-caused by Clostridium piliforme (formerly Bacillus piliformis)-which is restricted to foals less than \u223c6 weeks of age, may be associated with diarrhea. However, the liver lesion dominates the pathologic picture.",

Larval paramphistomes will also cause enteritis in lambs in enzootic areas. Strongyloides may affect lambs up to several months of age, even those held in confinement. Where it occurs, Nematodirus is usually a disease of lambs 1-3 months of age. Trichostrongylosis usually affects lambs 3 months to yearling age. Oesophagostomum columbianum may cause significant disease in sheep, as well as causing nodule formation in the intestinal submucosa. Trichuris typhlitis is an uncommon problem in sheep, as is Chabertia infection of the colon. Bunostomum and especially Haemonchus cause marked anemia and hypoproteinemia without diarrhea. Hemonchosis is a particular problem in lambs and kids at pasture or held in semiconfinement in warm humid climates. It is also important in ewes and does during the postparturient period, or spring, when retarded larvae emerge synchronously from the abomasal mucosa, and mature. Coccidiosis is a problem mainly in lambs and kids reared in confinement, on feedlot or heavily stocked on pasture. The disease is most severe between 2 and 8 weeks of age. Villus atrophy caused by mixed-species infections may be responsible for ill-thrift and diarrhea in older animals, whereas Eimeria arloingi and E. christenseni or E. ovina and E. ahsata may be responsible for mortality in very young kids and lambs, respectively.",

The seasonal nature of the disease suggests that it is transmitted by insects; however, insect transmission is not essential and contact transmission has been proved experimentally. VSV has been isolated from both biting and nonbiting insects and black flies have transmitted the virus to pigs. Biting insects most likely become infected from feeding on lesions rather than blood, because viremia is transient, if present. Nonbiting insects act as mechanical carriers of the virus. It is not known how the virus spreads from one geographic area to another.

Clinically, the disease is characterized by lethargy, anorexia, mild oculonasal discharge, and occasional mild oral erosions and shallow ulcers. Diarrhea may occur. In dairy herds there is a transient drop in milk production. Affected animals develop neutralizing antibodies that peak in 10-12 weeks, and probably are immune for life. A syndrome of severe acute BVD, characterized by high morbidity and mortality in all age groups of susceptible animals, has been recognized since the early 1990s. Sometimes termed BVD type 2, because it is caused mainly, although not exclusively, by primary infections with BVDV-2, this syndrome usually has a peracute to acute course, with fever, sudden death, diarrhea, or pneumonia. It should be noted that not all BVDV-2 isolates are highly virulent. In some cases a thrombocytopenic syndrome, characterized clinically by epistaxis, hyphema, mucosal hemorrhages, bleeding at injection sites, and bloody diarrhea, is superimposed on the alimentary syndrome caused by BVDV-2, or occurs independently. The pathogenesis of BVD type 2 is most frequently linked to increased strain virulence. However, production of inflammatory cytokines, in response to widespread infection of mononuclear phagocytes, has also been postulated as a cause for the severe disease seen clinically. The mechanism of thrombocytopenia is not completely defined, although infected megakaryocytes in the bone marrow undergo necrosis.",

It is widespread in cattle populations and this or closely related viruses can infect most eventoed ungulates, including swine. Although evidence for BVDV infection has been found in farmed and free-ranging wildlife in North America, the risk of transmission of the disease from wildlife to cattle remains unknown. As an RNA virus, BVDV is highly mutable because of the error-prone nature of the RNA polymerases responsible for replication of viral RNA. As a result, \"swarms\" of viral mutants form \"quasispecies\" that circulate within an infected individual and among individuals in a population. Although most quasispecies lack a selective advantage, or suffer deleterious point mutations, preventing them from becoming dominant, the ability to generate mutants enables BVDV to adapt to host responses, and to establish chronic or persistent infections in some circumstances. Although low virulence would seem to promote prolonged viral shedding, there may be advantages in high virulence that favor the emergence of quasispecies capable of causing severe disease and high virus shedding.",

Cattle, and modified live virus vaccines containing contaminated fetal bovine serum, are considered to be common sources of infection for swine. Infection of pigs with BVDV usually occurs without clinical signs, allowing an opportunity for the virus to spread without detection. There are sporadic reports of disease in pigs associated with BVDV infection, including stillbirth, and poorly viable piglets, some showing tremors. A few 2-4-week-old pigs in infected herds are anemic, have a rough hair coat, growth retardation, wasting, and diarrhea. Affected pigs fail to develop neutralizing antibodies to the infecting homologous BVDV. Littermates that remain normal develop neutralizing antibodies. The suggestion is that the infections are congenital. In pigs infected postnatally with BVDV, usually no lesions, or very mild lesions, are observed.

The disease was first recognized in West Africa, and is now distributed in north and sub-Saharan Africa, the Arabian Peninsula, Anatolia, the Indian subcontinent, including Nepal and Bangladesh, and China. Species Peste-des-petits-ruminants virus (PPRV), genus Morbillivirus, family Paramyxoviridae, is closely related to species Rinderpest virus, with which it shares common antigenic determinants. The virus cross-reacts with RPV in immunodiffusion and complement fixation tests. It may be differentiated from RPV using monoclonal antibody techniques and cDNA probes. Peste des petits ruminants is currently being considered for global eradication.",

Quite consistently, affected animals have enlarged lymph nodes, although this may be less the case in bison, and there is usually some degree of ocular and oral disease, and exudative dermatitis. There is edema of the eyelids and palpebral conjunctivae and congestion of the nasal and buccal mucosae. Photophobia is accompanied by copious lacrimation. There is conjunctivitis and an increasing rim of corneal opacity, starting at the limbus and progressing centripetally. Corneal ulceration occurs in some cases, but in those that die quickly, the infiltration of the filtration angle may be all that is seen, and this is easily overlooked. Hypopyon may be seen. In some cases there are nervous signs, such as hyperesthesia, head pressing, trembling, nystagmus, incoordination, and behavioral changes. Other animals may have gastroenteritis with diarrhea, which may be bloody in acute cases. This is most commonly seen in deer. The disease may take an acute course of \u223c1-3 days, particularly in animals with hemorrhagic enteritis. Those with less severe gastroenteritis, central nervous signs, or generalized disease may linger for as long as 9-10 days. Mortality in MCF has been considered to approach 100% of clinical cases, but recovery may occur, although chronic ocular lesions and vasculitis persist. Clinical signs in bison are more subtle than in cattle, with a high percentage of animals dying without clinical signs being observed or with animals dying very soon after onset of clinical disease.",

As with most other herpesvirus, the trigeminal ganglion is an important latency site for canid herpesvirus.

Latently infected dogs may or may not shed virus, and shedding may occur continuously or intermittently.

Large concentration of BCoV can be typically found in the spiral colon. Infected epithelial cells die, slough off, and are replaced by immature cells. The microscopic lesions of coronaviral infection in calves vary with the severity and duration of the infection; villus atrophy in combination with mild colitis is typical (Fig. 1-114) . In the calf small intestine, villus atrophy is rarely as severe as that seen in neonatal swine with TGE. Rather, villi are moderately shortened, or have subtotal atrophy with stumpy, club-shaped, or pointed tips, and villus fusion may be common. In the early phase of the clinical disease, villi are often pointed and covered by cuboidal to squamous epithelium. Exfoliation of epithelium and microerosion may be evident. Later, the epithelium is cuboidal to low columnar, basophilic, with irregular nuclear polarity and an indistinct brush border. Cryptal epithelium is hyperplastic. The lamina propria may contain a moderate infiltrate of mainly mononuclear inflammatory cells, some of which may have pyknotic or karyorrhectic nuclei. In the early stages of infection, necrosis of cells in mesenteric lymph nodes is hyperplastic epithelium, and the surface epithelium will be restored to a cuboidal or low columnar cell type. Goblet cells are usually relatively uncommon. Colonic lesions may be recognizable in tissues from animals submitted dead, even though postmortem change has obscured changes in the small intestine. Live calves in the early stages of clinical disease are the best subjects for confirmation of an etiologic diagnosis. In calves becoming ill <7 days of age, enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli is the main alternative diagnosis. Rotavirus, Cryptosporidium, and combined infections must be considered in calves 5-15 days of age. Infectious bovine rhinotracheitis, salmonellosis, and bovine viral diarrhea must also be considered. Both salmonellosis and bovine viral diarrhea may be associated with depletion of Peyer's patches and colitis that can be confused with that of coronaviral infection; neither is common in the strictly neonatal age group (<7-14 days of age).",

Syncytial cell formation has been recognized in porcine, bovine, and laboratory animal infections with rotavirus. Microvilli become irregular and somewhat stunted, and there may be some blebbing of membranes. Infected cells exfoliate into the intestinal lumen, and virus is released by lysis of damaged epithelium prior to or after exfoliation. The pathogenesis of diarrhea with rotavirus involves 3 mechanisms. First, malabsorption occurs secondary to destruction of enterocytes. Second, a vasoactive agent is released from infected epithelial cells and causes villus ischemia and activation of the enteric nervous system. Third, rotaviruses are capable of producing a nonstructural protein, NSP4, which acts as a secretory enterotoxin. This is the first viral pathogen known to produce a toxin.",

CPV has been shown to evolve very rapidly in comparison to FPV. Antigenic differences can be detected by monoclonal antibodies and there are differences in host specificity conferred by variations in only very small segments of the viral genome. However, host range is overlapping.

Variations in the rate of epithelial proliferation related to age, starvation, and refeeding, or concomitant parasitic, bacterial, or viral infections, may also influence the susceptibility of crypt epithelium to infection, and therefore affect the extent and severity of intestinal lesions and signs.",

BPV has been recognized for many years and occurs widely in cattle populations on all continents. It has been isolated from the feces of normal and recently diarrheic calves as well as from conjunctiva and aborted fetuses. The status of BPV as an enteric pathogen is unclear, although it is believed to cause diarrhea in neonatal calves and respiratory and reproductive disease in adult cattle. Virus shedding is not always associated with diarrhea, and it may be part of a mixed infection in diarrheic animals. Serologic prevalence of antibodies to BPV is high, with 83% of cattle and 100% of herds being positive over 2 years of testing in one study. It is rarely diagnosed as a cause of death, and unless sought specifically by culture, direct electron microscopy, or molecular probe, would be missed as a cause of clinical diarrhea.

The interplay between host and pathogen has been extensively studied for a number of important enteric bacterial pathogens, including Salmonella and Escherichia coli. Genes encoding a range of virulence characteristics in pathogenic bacteria, including adhesion factors, toxins, proteolytic enzymes, and other agents that promote tissue invasion, are often clustered in discrete regions of the genome known as pathogenicity islands. These appear to be sites of relative instability, and are thought to facilitate the horizontal transfer of virulence factors between bacteria, and their continued evolution. Similarities in the regulatory mechanisms for pathogenicity islands of important enteric pathogens, including Salmonella, Shigella, Vibrio, Yersinia, and E. coli, are providing new insights into the reasons why strains of many genera of bacteria vary greatly in their host range and ability to cause disease. Among the factors in the mucosal barrier that resist pathogen virulence there is growing interest in the role of the luminal microbiota and their metabolites. Disruption of the intestinal microbiota may facilitate virulence factors of invading pathogens listed earlier. They are antigenically distinct, permitting recognition by specific antibody. Fimbrial adhesins include F5 (K99) and F41 in strains affecting calves, lambs, and pigs; F42, F165, F17, F18 in calves and pigs; and F4 (K88), F6 (987P), F18 in pigs. Combinations of adhesins may be expressed by the same strain of ETEC; typically, F41 is expressed by strains also expressing F5, and seems to be of minor importance. Bacteria possessing F4 colonize the entire small bowel, whereas those with F5, F6, and F41 mainly adhere in the jejunum and ileum.",

LTI is antigenically similar to cholera toxin, whereas LTII toxins have B subunits that differ from LTI. The B subunits bind to ganglioside receptors (GM1 gangliosides) on the enterocyte surface; the toxin complex then dissociates, and the A1 subunit is internalized into the cell. It operates via an adenylate cyclase pathway to cause chloride secretion by enterocytes, sodium, and water following osmotically from the mucosa. Co-transport of sodium chloride by enterocytes, and associated water uptake, is probably also shut down at the same time. LT may also promote mucosal secretion by stimulation of local prostaglandin production, the enteric nervous system, and cytokine activation.

There is a high fever; characteristic but not pathognomonic blue discoloration of the skin, especially of the tail, snout, and ears ( Fig. 1-133) ; caudal weakness; dyspnea that often leads to misdiagnosis of primary pneumonia; and sometimes terminal convulsions. Sows may abort during the septicemic phase of infection. Pigs that have recovered from this phase may have dry gangrene of the ears and tail, caudal paralysis, blindness, and diphtheritic enteritis. The chronic or enteric form may develop from the acute, but is usually insidious from the onset. It is characterized by loose resulting from endotoxin, and focal localization of bacteria. The discoloration of the skin is initially caused by intense dilation, congestion, and thrombosis of capillaries and venules in the dermal papillae. There is activation and necrosis of the endothelial cells in affected vessels. The renal lesions vary but principally affect the glomeruli. In some there is diffuse glomerulitis, and this is associated with mild nephrosis and hyaline casts. In others the glomerulitis is exudative and hemorrhagic and in these a great many capillary loops contain hyaline thrombi. Embolic bacterial colonies are occasionally seen in the glomerular and intertubular capillaries. Fibrin thrombi also may be found in the afferent arterioles and interlobular arteries.",

Glands are lined by dysplastic pseudostratified columnar epithelial cells with basophilic cytoplasm; goblet cells often are reduced in number. Mucosal glands are elongated, dilated, and branched, resulting in a thickened mucosal layer ( Fig. 1-143A) . Hyperplastic glands may protrude multifocally into the underlying submucosal lymphoid tissue or epithelial cells may form elevated plaques above the mucosal surface; use of the term adenomatosis to describe such a change is obvious. Occasionally, microscopic foci of adenomatous epithelium may be found in submucosal lymphatics or the regional lymph node. Small intestinal villi in infected animals undergo progressive atrophy, and they may be absent in well-established lesions. The proliferative lesion in the crypts is considered a primary lesion, and not a secondary hyperplastic response to increased epithelial exfoliation. L. intracellularis organisms are readily recognized as curved rods within the apical cytoplasm of glandular epithelial cells in silver-stained tissue sections ( Fig.  1-143B ) or by immunohistochemistry ( Fig. 1-143C ). L. intracellularis also have been identified ultrastructurally in degenerate cells and macrophages in the lamina propria. Inflammation in areas of uncomplicated adenomatosis is usually not a prominent feature. In the least complicated forms of the disease, lesions are always found in the terminal portion of the ileum, extending proximally for a variable distance, usually <1 meter. In a significant proportion of cases, lesions occur in the cecum and proximal spiral colon primarily, or in addition to the ileum. In mild cases, only a few ridges or plaque-like thickened areas Microscopically, coagulative necrosis of the mucosal epithelium may be focal and superficial but can involve the full thickness of the mucosa or even extend into the submucosa. A few islands of viable hyperplastic crypts or glands may remain, and masses of bacteria, presumably fecal anaerobes, are observed among the necrotic debris. With time, granulation tissue develops in ulcerated areas. Proximal ileum along the margin of the zone of mucosal necrosis should be examined for hyperplastic epithelium because, in severe cases of necrotic enteritis, few remnants of mucosa persist. Repeated bouts of epithelial proliferation, necrosis, ulceration, and granulation may result in progressive stricture of the lumen that may be accompanied by hypertrophy of the external muscle layer. This should be differentiated from idiopathic ileal muscular hypertrophy of swine, which is known to occur independent of antecedent PPE.",

A presumptive diagnosis of proliferative enteritis in any species can be based on typical gross and histologic lesions, and supported by Warthin-Starry staining to visualize the intracellular bacteria. Confirmation can be obtained by immunohistochemistry using a specific antibody for L. intracellularis or by polymerase chain reaction. The pathogenesis of swine dysentery is still incompletely understood, but gene studies have identified virulence traits for Brachyspira that include hemolysins, cytotoxins, outer membrane proteins, motility factors such as flagella, and NADH oxidase that is thought to be required for the bacterium to successfully colonize the colonic epithelium. B. hyodysenteriae first colonizes mucus on the luminal surface of the large bowel before invading the cytoplasm of enterocytes and goblet cells; spirochetes can be observed by electron microscopy or in situ hybridization. This process is likely mediated by flagella and outer membrane proteins that enable the pathogen to successfully colonize the host. Following invasion by the pathogen, there is enhanced and altered mucin secretion, degeneration, and necrosis of epithelial cells and hemorrhage, which are thought to be mediated by cytotoxins and endotoxin. Exfoliation of surface epithelial cells has been associated with large numbers of spirochetes and other anaerobic bacteria on the mucosa. Brachyspira do not usually invade beyond the epithelial cells, and the result is mucosal colitis characterized by superficial erosion with hyperplasia of cells in colonic glands, hypersecretion of mucus, and a mixed inflammatory infiltrate in the lamina propria. Thrombosis of capillaries and venules in the superficial areas of the colonic mucosa is probably due to absorption of endotoxin through the damaged mucosal epithelium. Diarrhea is due to malabsorption of fluids and electrolytes in the colon; this presumably results from damage to the superficial epithelium of the colon, which in the pig normally has tremendous absorptive capacity. Active fluid secretion by the colon, associated with bacterial enterotoxins, probably does not play a major role in swine dysentery.",

Since 1921, classical swine dysentery has been recognized as a highly infectious disease, mainly of weaned pigs. B. hyodysenteriae is a gram-negative, anaerobic, oxygen-tolerant, strongly beta-hemolytic spirochete. The loosely coiled motile organism has 7-13 periplasmic flagella. Although the bacterial genus Brachyspira includes several species capable of colonizing a wide spectrum of hosts, B. hyodysenteriae is predominantly a pathogen of pigs, although the bacterium has been associated with necrotizing typhlocolitis in rheas. Experimental reproduction of swine dysentery in gnotobiotic pigs requires the presence of anaerobic bacteria indigenous to the normal colon, along with B. hyodysenteriae; there is apparently a synergistic action between B. hyodysenteriae and the intestinal microbiota, mainly Bacteroides and Fusobacterium. Several studies have implicated dietary factors, specifically an elevated protein : carbohydrate ratio in the hindgut, as a predisposing factor for enhanced pathogenicity of B. hyodysenteriae in pigs.

C. perfringens type A is responsible for necrotic enteritis in chickens, and it has been associated with several alimentary syndromes in mammals, including enteritis in foals; enterocolitis in horses; necrotizing enterocolitis in neonatal piglets; enterotoxemia and hemorrhagic enteritis in lambs and neonatal calves and older cattle; and diarrhea and hemorrhagic enteritis in dogs. However, absolute proof of involvement of C. perfringens type A in these alimentary syndromes of mammals is lacking.",

Affected animals may be found dead or moribund, and jaundice and hemoglobinuria may be toxins produced in the intestine. The enterotoxin is only elaborated during sporulation and is released upon lysis of vegetative cells. It may be produced by most strains, but most cases of disease are associated with type A. Enterotoxin-producing C. perfringens type A is the second and third most important cause of human food poisoning in humans in the United States over the past decades. Enterotoxigenic type A strains are also associated with antibiotic treatment-related diarrhea in humans. The significance of enterotoxin in animal disease is limited. It is also a pore-forming toxin. Clostridial diseases originating in the intestine are often called enterotoxemias, which by definition are diseases produced by toxins generated in the intestine and absorbed into the circulation and that act on distant organs such as the brain and lungs. However, although several clostridial diseases of the intestine are true enterotoxemias, some of them are not. For instance, disease produced in sheep by C. perfringens type D, whose epsilon exotoxin is elaborated in the intestine but in this species exerts its important effects on distant organs such as brain and lungs, is a true enterotoxemia. The same toxinotype can produce an enterocolitis in goats with, in the chronic cases, no systemic absorption of epsilon toxin, in which case, no enterotoxemia occurs.",

As well, they glycosylate Rho and interfere with its ability to regulate cytoskeletal actin. Under the influence of these toxins, the cytoskeleton condenses, tight junctions open, cells round up and undergo apoptosis. They also cause release of proinflammatory mediators, attracting neutrophils, and activate secretion stimulated by the enteric nervous system. Hence, disease is characterized by fluid intestinal content, with focal or diffuse small intestinal or colonic epithelial necrosis, through which neutrophils may exude into the lumen, producing a so-called \"volcano\" lesion.

Gross lesions are similar in all areas of the intestine, and in acute cases consist of intestinal and mesenteric hyperemia, extensive necrosis of the intestinal mucosa, which may be covered by a pseudomembrane (Fig. 1-149A) , and blood-staining of the contents.

The main virulence factor of C. perfringens type C is beta toxin as demonstrated in animal experiments using toxin mutants of this microorganism in rabbits, mice, and goats. Beta toxin is trypsinlabile, and circumstances such as low trypsin levels in neonatal animals, trypsin inhibitors in the diet and/or very high levels of toxin are critical in the pathogenesis of type C disease. The high susceptibility of neonatal animals to type C disease is considered to be a consequence of the trypsin inhibitor effect of colostrum, a mechanism apparently aimed to protect immunoglobulins present in the colostrum. \"Pig-bel,\" also known as \"enteritis necroticans,\" is a necrotizing enteritis of humans caused by C. perfringens type C, which was the most important cause of human deaths in the 1960s in Papua New Guinea and still occurs sporadically in that island and other countries of the region. The disease has been associated with consumption of trypsin inhibitors in sweet potatoes, a significant component of the diet in Papua New Guinea. This, coupled with the low level of protein in the diet, results in low trypsin in the intestine, which allows persistence of beta toxin in the intestinal lumen.

However, it has been demonstrated by the use of reverse genetic experiments in animal models that epsilon toxin is sufficient to cause all the clinical signs and lesions of type D enterotoxemia in sheep and goats. Epsilon toxin is the third most potent clostridial toxin (after botulinum and tetanus toxins) and, until recently it was considered a class B select agent by the USDA and CDC in the United States. Activated epsilon toxin apparently facilitates its own absorption through the intestinal mucosa and it is then transported to several target organs, including the brain, lungs, and kidneys. In the brain and possibly also in other organs, epsilon toxin affects endothelial cells, producing the lesions described later. It also has been suggested that epsilon toxin acts directly on neurons within the brain.",

However, it has been demonstrated in vitro that the absence of glucose in a culture medium stimulates epsilon toxin production. Therefore it is possible that the presence of starch in the intestine stimulates the growth of C. perfringens type D, whereas the absence of glucose stimulates epsilon toxin production. When the animal is suddenly provided with excessive quantities of food, particularly starch-rich food, there is a delay before the ruminal flora can adapt. In this period, undigested or partially digested starch may escape into the intestine, and C. perfringens type D is likely to take advantage of it. The lack of digestion of starch also would be responsible for the absence of glucose in the small intestine. The epsilon prototoxin is produced as a relatively inactive prototoxin, which is fully activated by digestive enzymes, especially the combination of trypsin and chymotrypsin, but also by some proteases produced by C. perfringens itself.",

Mucosal thickening is due to accumulation of predominantly macrophages, as well as edema fluid, in the mucosa and submucosa. The mucosa and/or serosa may have a slightly granular appearance because of increased cellularity and edema. The ileocecal and mesenteric lymph nodes are enlarged, pale, and edematous.

MAP is transmitted predominantly by the fecaloral route, either directly by ingestion in feces or indirectly via MAP-contaminated milk, colostrum, or water. Organisms may be present in semen or urine, and may cross the placenta, particularly during advanced disease. A distinct age-dependent susceptibility to MAP infection is observed; the infectious dose for adults is considerable higher than for neonates. The basis for this is unknown, and control programs aimed at blocking transmission are almost exclusively focused on neonates. Johne's disease is often categorized into 3 (or 4) stages: silent infection, subclinical infection, clinical disease (and advanced clinical disease), based on severity of clinical signs, potential for shedding of MAP organisms into the environment, and ease of diagnosis. Of particular importance is the subclinical period, which can last 2-5 years before infected animals develop clinical signs. Because shedding of MAP into the environment by subclinical cows is variable and progressive, this period represents a significant risk for spread of the infection to susceptible herdmates. This long and unpredictable incubation period has given rise to the concept of the iceberg effect because in any infected herd, although few animals may be showing clinical signs of Johne's disease, a much greater number of animals are likely MAP infected. Sheep, goats, and cervids are considered to be more susceptible to MAP infection compared with cattle, and have a shorter incubation period before development of clinical signs. Survivability of MAP in the environment is proposed to have a significant effect on the epidemiology of MAP infection in animals; however, the biologic relevance of these factors for transmission of infection is still unclear.",

Macrophages are the preferred host cell for MAP, and the ability of pathogenic mycobacteria including MAP to inhibit phagosome-lysosome fusion is fundamental to its survival and persistence within the host. Experimental in vitro and in vivo work indicates that MAP-infected cattle develop a proinflammatory immune response early after intestinal infection, which is probably driven by innate intestinal T lymphocytes including gammadelta T cells and natural killer cells. However, in animals that fail to clear the infection, the early proinflammatory response eventually gives way to an apparently ineffective but robust MAP-specific antibody response. This transition correlates with the progression from subclinical to clinical disease in affected adults, but the mechanisms for this remain largely unknown. The rate of disease progression and the length of the subclinical period of Johne's disease are irregular and can be protracted; clinical cows are rarely <2 years of age. The reasons for this remain unclear, although there is likely a complex interplay of factors, including age of initial exposure, dose, re-exposure over time, environment, nutrition, production stage, and genetics.

It is caused by Neorickettsia (formerly Ehrlichia) risticii, a member of the order Rickettsiales, which are obligate intracellular bacterial pathogens. Potomac horse fever typically occurs in the summer. It was first described in the Potomac river valley of Maryland, Virginia, and Pennsylvania but it is now found in most areas of the United States and Canada, with cases also reported in Brazil and Uruguay, where it has been known for many years as churrido. Considering the current distribution of the disease, the name Potomac horse fever is probably no longer appropriate, and the term equine neorickettsiosis has been proposed. Neorickettsia spp. replicate within the phagosome in the host cell, and use trematodes as hosts. The life cycle of the fluke includes freshwater snails from where it goes back into water, where it is ingested by the larval stages of several aquatic insects, including caddis flies and mayflies. The main mode of infection is most likely by accidental ingestion of tract; however, the rumen and omasum are the most common sites. Aspergillus tends to be most common in the abomasum. These organisms have a propensity to invade mucosal and submucosal veins, producing thrombosis and venous infarction. Characteristic gross lesions are focal or multifocal areas of edema and red-black discoloration caused by venous stasis and hemorrhage.

            "text": "Formerly referred to as phycomycosis, the term zygomycosis denotes infections caused by one of several genera of fungi in the class Zygomycetes, which is divided into the orders of Mucorales and Entomophthorales. The gastrointestinal mucosa is the main portal of entry; fungal invasion is a common sequel to many mucosal diseases and lesions, and it may be the precursor to systemic infection. Heavy fungal challenge, disruption of the normal flora, a primary local lesion, and/or lowered host resistance are probably required for establishment of mycotic disease in the gut. Spores are probably normally carried across the mucosa by macrophages, and only if host immunity is compromised in some way will they establish in the deeper tissues or become disseminated. The most common organisms associated with alimentary tract mycoses are zygomycetes of the family Mucoraceae (Lichtheimia, Mortierella, Mucor, Rhizomucor, and Rhizopus) ; other organisms that also may be involved include family Entomophthoraceae (Basidiobolus and Conidiobolus) and rarely Aspergillus sp., Candida spp., and Histoplasma capsulatum also may invade the wall of the alimentary canal; these are considered separately later in this chapter. Mucoraceae are characterized in their invasive mycelial form by broad (6-25 \u00b5m), coarse irregular hyphae, with infrequent septation and random branching, sometimes surrounded by an eosinophilic sleeve in tissue sections. Entomophthoraceae hyphae vary from 5 to 25 \u00b5m in diameter, with thin irregularly parallel walls, infrequent septa, and rare random branching. They are characteristically surrounded by a wide sheath or sleeve of eosinophilic material in tissue section. Aspergillus has relatively uniform narrow (3-6 \u00b5m) septate hyphae; it typically displays acute angled dichotomous branching.",

It is viviparous, and third-stage larvae developing in the uterus of the female are transmitted in vomitus. As a result, infection is usually not detected by fecal examination, and infection with this species may go unnoticed. In some parts of the world it is common, particularly in cat colonies and cats that roam. Clinical signs and gross lesions caused by O. tricuspis are uncommon. Vomition, anorexia, and weight loss are the signs most frequently associated with infection. The worms lie beneath the mucus on the surface of the stomach, or partly in gastric glands. Infection is associated with increased numbers of lymphoid follicles deep in the gastric mucosa, increased interstitial connective tissue in the mucosa, and numerous globule leukocytes in the gastric epithelium. Heavy infection results in mucous metaplasia and hyperplasia of gastric glands, causing the surface of the stomach to be thrown into thickened convoluted folds, grossly resembling idiopathic hypertrophic gastritis of dogs. Gastric glands are often separated by the heavy reactive fibrous stroma in the mucosa. In gastric biopsies, this suite of microscopic changes in the mucosa should be recognized as characteristic of Ollulanus infection, even if worms are not present. Ollulanus are characterized in section by the numerous longitudinal cuticular ridges (synlophe) recognized as projections on the surface of sectioned worms. Intestinal trichostrongylosis. Members of the genus Trichostrongylus parasitize the proximal small intestine of ruminants worldwide. They cause significant subclinical inefficiency in production, or clinical disease characterized by diarrhea, illthrift, and in some cases, death. The most important species infecting sheep and goats are T. colubriformis, T. vitrinus, and T. rugatus; others include T. longispicularis, T. falculatus, T. capricola, and T. probolurus. T. colubriformis and T. longispicularis also parasitize cattle. Although some T. axei may be found in the duodenum of cattle and sheep, this species is primarily parasitic in the abomasum. Experimental infection studies indicate that the lesions and pathogenesis of disease caused by Trichostrongylus species are similar, although some evidence suggests that T. vitrinus is more pathogenic than T. colubriformis and T. rugatus.",

Crypts are hyperplastic, dilated, and elongated; there is goblet cell hyperplasia. The lamina propria is populated by a moderately heavy mixed inflammatory cell population, including lymphocytes, plasma cells, eosinophils, and globule leukocytes, the latter of which are thought to indicate strength of the immune response or repeated infection. The diagnosis is based on recovery of substantial populations of Trichostrongylus spp. in association with the clinicopathologic syndrome. Mixed infections with other parasitic genera are common. The life cycle is direct, although infective larvae within eggs of N. battus and N. filicollis require a period of conditioning by cold (overwintering) before hatching.

Infective third-stage larval cyathostomins are ingested, and they migrate into the deep mucosa or submucosa of the cecum and large colon to encyst and molt, before emerging to the lumen to molt again and mature into adults. Encysted third- or fourth-stage larvae may undergo hypobiosis or developmental inhibition, persisting in nodules in the colonic wall for as long as 2 years. The timing during which inhibition occurs is dependent on the climate: Inhibition occurs during cooler months of the year in temperate climates, and during the hot summer in tropical climates. The most devastating damage occurs when large numbers of encysted inhibited larvae emerge en masse to continue their development in the intestinal lumen. This occurs in the late winter, spring, and early summer in northern temperate climates. Initially, hemorrhagic tracks are present near portal areas and throughout lobules. They are visible through the capsule as pinpoint red areas, perhaps slightly depressed and surrounded by a narrow pale zone. These lesions collapse and heal by fibrosis, causing scarring that involves most intensely the adjacent portal tracts.

In the second pathway, larvae penetrate alveoli but are distributed by the circulatory system throughout the body where they encyst (larva migrans), rather than undergoing development and tracheal migration; this is more common in older animals. Most migrating larvae end up in kidneys, skeletal muscle, liver and central nervous system. Probably the most important route in young dogs is transplacental transmission. In the pregnant bitch encysted larvae in tissues are mobilized and cross the placenta to infect the fetus after day 42 of gestation; mechanisms for mobilization of larvae is not clearly understood.

In the dog, large populations of worms overflow their normal habitat and infect the mucosa of the ascending colon, sometimes extending to the rectum. Clinical signs may include chronic diarrhea or dysentery, perhaps with some weight loss. The blood and foul odor of the feces are due to hemorrhage and effusion of tissue fluid from the mucosal surface damaged by the embedded worms. Grossly the mucosa is thickened, red, and edematous. The colonic content is often watery, and contains blood or mucus. Masses of tangled worms are visible on the mucosa. Microscopically the mucosal surface is widely eroded or mildly ulcerated, and effusion of proteinaceous fluid, inflammatory exudate, and blood is evident. The glandular epithelium is hyperplastic.

Changes in the myenteric ganglia, including loss and degeneration of neurons, edema, and inflammation, have been described. The risk of spasmodic colic also increases with parasite burden, which may be at least partially explained by the histologic lesions described. Ileal muscular hypertrophy, impaction and partial obstruction of the ileocecal orifice, and ileocecal and cecocecal intussusception are also associated with large numbers of A. perfoliata. Although histologic lesions correlate well with the parasite burden, whether the development of colic, obstruction, muscular hypertrophy, or intussusception is the result of altered peristaltic waves or mucosal and submucosal lesions remains unclear. Histologically, adult cestodes have flattened solid parenchymatous bodies segmented into proglottids. Internal organs are embedded within the parenchymatous matrix, and contain male and female reproductive organs but lack a digestive tract. Other features that may be observed include anterior muscular suckers and hooks.

Taeniid cestodes are the most important tapeworms in domestic animals, not because of the effects of the adult worm in the carnivorous definitive host, but rather because of the metacestodes, or larval forms, in intermediate or paratenic hosts. Gravid taeniid segments exit from the definitive host and shed their eggs. If ingested by an appropriate intermediate vertebrate host, the egg hatches and the embryo enters the intestinal wall to migrate to the organ of predilection, which is often the liver, peritoneum, or muscle. Here they differentiate into second-stage larvae characterized by a fluid-filled bladder with one or more scolices (bladderworm), which is infective to the definitive host. Once the second-stage larva is ingested by the definitive host, the scolex embeds itself into the small intestinal mucosa, where it begins to bud segments to form strobila.

The worms that develop are short, usually <6-7 mm long; they commonly have only 3-5 proglottids, the caudal gravid one making up almost half the length of the worm. Burdens of E. granulosus are often heavy, no doubt because of the large numbers of protoscolices ingested at a meal containing one or more hydatid cysts. The heavily infected intestine is carpeted by the tiny white blunt projections, partially obscured between the villi and resembling lymphangiectasia; enteric signs are not normally observed. Eggs shed from adults are ingested by the intermediate host; oncospheres released from eggs in the intestine of the intermediate host migrate via subepithelial capillaries or lacteals to the liver, lungs, and general circulation. Hydatid cysts occur most commonly in the liver and lung, with some strain and host species variation in the relative prevalence in these organs. In sheep they may be more common in lungs, whereas in cattle and horses the liver is the usual site of establishment. Less common sites in domestic animals include the brain, heart, bone, and subcutaneous tissue. A single cyst, or up to several hundreds, may be present, displacing tissue in infected organs. Disease is rarely attributed to hydatidosis in animals, even in those heavily infected. However, strategic location of one or more cysts may lead to heart failure, bloat, or central nervous signs because of space occupation. Condemnation of infected organs at slaughter inspection may cause significant economic loss.",

They occur after invasion by the infective sporozoite, before merogony; after invasion by a merozoite, before a subsequent generation of merogony; and after invasion by a merozoite, before differentiation into a recognizable gamont. Developing meronts are multinucleated. Merogony may involve endopolygeny, which is multiple fission or apparent \"budding\" of merozoites from the periphery of the meront or from infoldings of it. A single residual body, surrounded by slightly curved, fusiform, or banana-shaped uninucleate merozoites, or many spherical clusters of merozoites with a central residuum, may be present. A second form of replication, termed endodyogeny, occurs in meronts of many of the heteroxenous coccidia. Two daughter organisms develop within a mother organism, which is destroyed when they are released. The location of a meront, and the number of merozoites it contains, vary with the species and the generation of merogony. A very few, or up to tens or hundreds of thousands of merozoites, may be released from a single meront.",

During the second phase, the microgametes differentiate about the periphery of the gamont, which may become deeply folded or fissured by invaginations. Immature microgametocytes during these stages may resemble developing schizonts. However, fully differentiated microgametes differ from merozoites in being small, densely basophilic, and comma-shaped, with 2-3 flagella. They may be present in swirling masses, perhaps with some residual bodies, in mature microgametocytes. Macrogametes, the female stage, have a large nucleus with a prominent nucleolus, and with time they usually enlarge to contain refractile eosinophilic \"plastic granules\" or wall-forming bodies, which give rise to the layers of the oocyst usually low. The duration of severe disease is \u223c3-10 days, after which most cases recover, because infection is essentially selflimiting. Some animals develop concurrent nervous signs, including tremors, nystagmus, opisthotonos, and convulsions, and many of these die within a few days.",

In heavily infected animals, disease and sometimes death can occur before many oocysts are passed in the feces. The life cycles of both agents are similar, two schizogonous generations preceding gametogony. The first-generation schizont of E. bovis infects hypertrophic endothelial cells in lacteals on the upper part of villi in the lower small intestine, several meters proximal to the ileocecal valve. These schizonts may be large, up to \u223c300 \u00b5m in diameter, and are visible to the naked eye as pinpoint white nodular foci in the mucosa. They contain tens of thousands of merozoites, but are invested by only a narrow rim of mononuclear inflammatory cells, unless they degenerate, when a marked local mixed reaction develops, including neutrophils and macrophages. Merozoites released from these schizonts \u223c14-18 days after infection enter cells deep in cecal and colonic glands. In heavy infections, crypts of Lieberk\u00fchn in the terminal ileum also may be infected.

It is especially important in naive young animals exposed to a high level of infection. This is predisposed by high contamination rates associated with crowding, yarding, or high stocking rates on pasture. A damp substrate promotes oocyst sporulation and survival, and practices such as feeding on the ground or the natural propensity of young animals to nibble or perhaps indulge in coprophagy may promote infection. Although infections may not proceed to patency, chronic ingestion of oocysts may cause an intestinal immune response, villus atrophy, and in some situations perhaps ill-thrift. Immune reactions may only halt development of, but not kill, endogenous asexual stages. Epidemiologic evidence suggests that under some circumstances there may be relaxation of resistance and resumption of development of the organisms, ultimately expressed in disease.

However, implication of E. leuckarti in the disease process is rarely, if ever, convincing, and this parasite is encountered incidentally in the intestine of horses dead of other clearly defined conditions. Furthermore, heavy experimental inoculations, producing many gamonts in the gut and heavy oocyst passage, have failed to elicit clinical signs.",

Hashemnia M, et al. Experimental In animals surviving for a few days, the cryptal epithelium may be markedly hyperplastic. The severity of the lesions is a function of the size of the inoculum and the age of the pigs. Heavier inocula, within limits, produce more cellular damage and villus atrophy; fibrinonecrotic enteritis indicates ingestion of a large dose of oocysts. However, severe lesions may not be associated with heavy shedding of oocysts because relatively few gamonts are able to develop in the reduced population of epithelial cells remaining on villi. The severity of lesions and signs is much greater in piglets a few days old in comparison with those 2 weeks of age. This partly relates to the lower rate of replication of epithelium in the crypts of young piglets, and therefore the development of more severe villus atrophy. The smaller size of young piglets also makes them more susceptible to the effects of malabsorption and diarrhea.

In some cases the large bowel may be infected, with exfoliation of surface epithelium, and accumulation of necrotic debris in some dilated glands. Toxoplasmosis. Toxoplasma gondii uses felids as definitive hosts. It is optionally heteroxenous; cats may be infected directly by ingestion of oocysts, but probably most commonly by ingestion of asexual stages in the tissues of prey species. Cats excrete oocysts 3-10 days after ingesting bradyzoites, \u223c13 days after ingesting tachyzoites, and 18 days after ingesting oocysts. Transmission efficacy varies and cats can become infected after ingestion of one bradyzoite, whereas ingestion of 1,000 oocysts is required to establish infection. Intermediate hosts are infected by oocysts shed in the feces of cats, or by a variety of other routes considered later. Five stages of asexual development are recognized in the intestinal epithelium of cats infected with tissue cysts from intermediate hosts.",

The remaining cell-mediated immune capacity may control pathogen proliferation and promote progression to chronic disease. In experimental models lacking cytokines associated with cell-mediated immunity, including \u03b3-interferon, Toxoplasma infection is nearly always fatal. The chronic or dormant form of Toxoplasma infection is characterized by the formation of cysts containing bradyzoites. These are mainly located in the brain, skeletal muscle, and myocardium. Cysts may form as early as 1-2 weeks after infection and they may persist for months, possibly years. Intracellular encystment protects the bradyzoites from both cellular and humoral immune mechanisms. Inflammation is usually not associated with cysts. When the level of resistance drops below a critical level, for example, because of treatment with immunosuppressive drugs, intercurrent disease, or other factors that depress immunity, particularly decreased levels of \u03b3-interferon, a chronic infection may become reactivated.

Although villus atrophy may occur in humans with giardiosis, this mainly occurs in a subgroup of patients with hypogammaglobulinemia. Marked histologic abnormality is not found in many cases of giardiosis in humans, and this also seems to be true for dogs, cats, and calves. In experimental murine giardiosis, infection is associated with hypertrophy of crypts and increased production of cells, combined with an increased rate of movement of enterocytes along villi, with an increased crypt : villus ratio. Deficiencies in brush border form and function may be attributable to incomplete differentiation of enterocytes in this circumstance, or perhaps to damage mediated by mucosal T cells. Intraepithelial lymphocytes are common in infected intestine, and altered epithelial kinetics may be related to cell-mediated immune reactions in the mucosa. Infection may lead to increased enterocyte apoptosis, and alterations in epithelial barrier function. Infection has been shown in experimental models to interfere with tight junctions in the epithelium. Atrophy of villi has been associated with restoration of cell-mediated immune competence in Giardia-infected athymic mice, reinforcing the notion that immune phenomena may be involved in the pathogenesis of giardiosis.",

Both parietal and visceral peritoneum are continuously involved in transport of fluid in both directions. Normal fluid contains only traces of protein and secreted macromolecules that reduce permeability, and the electronegativity of the endothelium relative to mesothelium inhibits transfer of plasma proteins from capillaries into the cavity. Thus the net hydraulic forces favor movement of fluid into the abdominal cavity. Several pathways contribute to the drainage of peritoneal fluid. Direct transfer through stomata in the membrane to subserosal lymphatics is the main mechanism, dominated by transfer into lymphatics of the ventral diaphragm, and thence via the sternal lymph nodes to the right lymphatic duct, or via mediastinal lymph nodes to the thoracic duct. Respiratory diaphragmatic movements assist transfer through the diaphragm to ventral mediastinal lymphatics. Less fluid is taken up through the omentum and abdominal viscera, and drains via visceral lymphatics and lymph nodes to the thoracic duct. There is a lesser contribution to drainage by the pelvic serosa. Transfer of peritoneal fluid through and between mesothelial cells occurs but is a minor contributor to overall fluid movement.",

A requirement for development of FIP is likely the capacity of the virus to replicate within monocytes of the host. In comparison to FECV, FIPV strains have less tropism for the gut. FIPV replicates in macrophages, and it is thought that macrophages from the intestine acquire virus from the intestinal epithelium and carry it to regional lymph nodes and disseminate the virus to many parts of the body; this is central to their virulence. It has been proposed that mutation and transformation of FECV to FIPV can also take place within these macrophages; however, this has not been definitively demonstrated. Incidence of the disease is apparently not higher in cats infected with feline leukemia virus or feline immunodeficiency virus; however, FCoV replicates 10-100 fold more in macrophages of cats infected with FIV, thus enhancing the probability of spontaneous mutations.",

Strongylus edentatus and S. equinus normally migrate through the liver, as well as the ligaments and lumen of the peritoneal cavity. Fibrous tags on the liver, particularly the diaphragmatic aspect, are thought to be sequelae of S. edentatus migration. The larvae of both species may be found in the retroperitoneal tissues of the dorsal abdomen in horses, and in the mesenteries supported by thin fibrovascular stroma. Mitotic figures are typically not numerous. Some tumors have atypical cells with marked anisokaryosis and prominent nucleoli, or large multinucleated cells. Mesothelial cells form clusters and whorls, or they line cystic spaces forming tubular structures with mucinous matrix. Mesotheliomas resembling carcinoma can mimic implantation and metastasis via subserosal lymphatics so completely that adequate differentiation from a true carcinoma may rest on very careful examination for, and exclusion of, a primary malignant neoplasm. Mesothelioma must be differentiated from activated or hyperplastic mesothelium, which can be extremely challenging. No single feature can be used reliably to distinguish between hyperplastic and neoplastic mesothelium. Histochemistry and immunohistochemistry have not been particularly successful in uniquely identifying malignant mesothelial cells in domestic animals.",

These benign tumors are well known in horses, in which they usually originate in the mesenteries. They may reach enormous size, but their greatest significance is when they become pedunculated and cause acute strangulation obstruction when the pedicle wraps around a loop of intestine. The core of many lipomas is friable and necrotic, probably from ischemia; in many lipomas, only the superficial centimeter or so remains viable, perhaps nourished by diffusion from the peritoneal environment ( Fig.  1-201) . In the dog, lipomas arise in the omentum, rather than the mesenteries, and settle on the abdominal floor. They may become very large, but tend not to become pedunculated and therefore do not cause acute distress. Lipomas are benign lesions that do not metastasize.",

Mild infections may be discovered incidentally at autopsy. Mesocestoides infection of the abdominal cavity must be differentiated from peritoneal infections by cysticerci of several Taenia spp., which occur very rarely in carnivores. Dipylidium caninum occurs in the dog, cat, fox, and, occasionally, children. It is ubiquitous. The narrow worms, up to 0.5 meters long, have distinctive cucumber-seed\u2212like segments, and are often encountered incidentally in the small intestine at autopsy. They are of no pathologic significance. Cysticercoids develop in fleas and perhaps in the dog louse Trichodectes canis",

Adult S. labiatopapillosa in the peritoneal cavity, or in the tunica vaginalis around the testis, may incite granulomatous peritonitis or periorchitis if they die; remnants of the dead nematode may be detected in sections of the granulomatous reaction. Adult S. digitata rarely may be found in abnormal locations, such as the heart, lungs, and mesenteric lymph nodes, where they incite eosinophilic granulomatous inflammation. The larval form of S. digitata can produce mild peritonitis and granulomas in the retroperitoneum and bladder of cattle. The larvae of S. equina, S. digitata, and perhaps others that normally spend part of their time in the central nervous system, may occasionally penetrate the neural parenchyma and cause lesions. The sheathed microfilariae deposited by adult females in the peritoneal cavity are found in the blood. The intermediate host may be a mosquito, or for some Setaria spp., biting flies (Haematobia and Stomoxys spp). The microfilariae develop into infective larvae in 2-3 weeks. They are released from the feeding arthropod and enter the final host. Setaria digitata is normally found as an adult in the peritoneal cavity of cattle and buffalo in Asia, but its larvae can cause cerebrospinal nematodiasis in aberrant hosts (see",

Although the fungus has worldwide distribution, histoplasmosis is endemic in certain areas such as the Mississippi, Ohio, and Missouri river valleys of the United States. In Canada, it is thought to be limited to south central Canada, along the Ottawa and St. Lawrence River valleys with only sporadic cases reported elsewhere. It is an important disease of humans and dogs, and occasionally occurs in other species. Infection generally occurs via inhalation of spores, and possibly by ingestion of microconidia or macroconidia in the mycelial phase that transition to yeast forms within host macrophages in which they resist host defense mechanisms. Immunocompetent individuals probably have self-limiting infections, but animals that are immunocompromised or receive large doses of organism have greater risk of developing disease.Given the routes of exposure, infection in dogs is usually confined to the lungs, but dissemination can occur to the gastrointestinal tract, and less commonly to the skin, bone, liver, spleen, or brain. Rare cases of histoplasmosis confined to the gastrointestinal tract suggest exposure by ingestion, potentially of infected sputum. Disseminated histoplasmosis is predominantly a disease of young dogs that are usually presented with weight loss, generalized lymphadenopathy, hemorrhagic diarrhea, and tenesmus. In cats, disseminated disease is most common and may involve lungs, lymph nodes, liver, spleen, kidney, adrenal glands, bone marrow, and the gastrointestinal tract; primary intestinal histoplasmosis is probably rare in cats. Horses appear to be relatively resistant to histoplasmosis, although sporadic cases have been reported in a variety of organs, including the intestine; a single report of disseminated disease has been reported.",

            "text": "Candida spp. are commensal inhabitants of the alimentary and biliary tract of animals, existing as budding yeasts in association with mucosal surfaces. With changes in the mucosal surface itself, particularly squamous mucosae, or in the mucosal flora, these yeasts may become opportunistic pathogens and invade as branching, filamentous pseudohyphae and hyphae that replace the yeast forms. Candida spp. are occasionally opportunistic invaders of nonsquamous mucosal lesions in the alimentary tract, but other opportunistic fungi are more likely to be associated with nonsquamous lesions, particularly in older animals. Candidiasis is mainly a disease of keratinized epithelium in young animals, especially pigs, calves, and foals.Only a few of the almost 200 Candida species cause candidiasis; in animals the most important are C. albicans and C. tropicalis. Changes in the mucosal flora usually result from systemic antimicrobial therapy that reduces the numbers of anaerobic bacteria and allows proliferation of Candida spp. Immunosuppression, environmental and social stress, and treatment with chemotherapeutic, anti-cancer, or antiinflammatory agents may also predispose to candidiasis. An important factor in the virulence of Candida spp., especially C. albicans, is the ability to adhere to, colonize, and invade the epithelium. Adherence to the epithelium is mediated by a family of adhesins produced by the yeast. Candida spp. is a polymorphic fungus that can grow as an ovoid 3-6 \u00b5m yeast (with budding), elongated ellipsoid pseudohyphae (chains of tubular yeast) or true hyphae, and binding to the epithelium induces the well-known yeast-to-hypha switch. Epithelial damage may be induced by yeast-produced enzymes, including proteinases and catalases, or by host cell-produced enzymes such as neutrophil myeloperoxidase. These enzymes contribute to local damage, which permits deeper penetration into squamous epithelium and perhaps promote systemic dissemination. Accumulation of keratin caused by anorexia may also contribute to the extensiveness of lesions in all species by increasing the substrate available to the fungus.In pigs, Candida spp. often invade the parakeratotic material that accumulates on the gastric squamous mucosa; apparently these infections are innocuous. Thrush is the term for candidiasis of the oral cavity, which is seen occasionally in young pigs, especially those raised on artificial diets, or in pigs with concurrent disease. Lesions may be confined to the tongue, hard palate, or pharynx, but often involve the esophagus and gastric squamous mucosa as well. Grossly the lesions are yellow-white, smooth, or wrinkled plaques loosely adherent to the mucosa. Histologically, there is vacuolar degeneration of the epithelium, which contains many yeasts, pseudohyphae, hyphae, and pockets of neutrophils and bacteria within and beneath the stratum corneum. Vascular congestion, mild inflammation, and erosion and ulceration of the epithelium may be evident.In calves, candidiasis occurs following prolonged antimicrobial therapy and in association with rumen putrefaction. Lesions are most often seen in the ventral sac of the rumen, but may involve the omasum and reticulum and occasionally the abomasum. Grossly the lesions resemble those of thrush in pigs, but the keratin layer tends to be thicker, less diffuse, and light gray. Omasal leaves may be adhered together by the mass of fungus-riddled keratin. C. glabrata in the abomasum has been implicated as a cause of diarrhea in calves, especially during winter months. Disseminated candidiasis occurs more often in calves than in pigs, probably because of the relatively",

They are ubiquitous in some environmental niches including raw and treated sewage, water, feces, plant sap, and tree slime; they also can be contaminants of various substrates including cow's milk. Two species, P. zopfii and P. wickerhamii, cause Gross intestinal lesions may be absent, or there may be hemorrhagic enteritis of small and/or large intestine, or the lesions mimic neoplasia as they cause granulomatous nodular thickening of the intestinal wall with mucosal ulceration. Mesenteric lymph nodes are often markedly enlarged. Characteristic histologic lesions are multifocal and coalescing transmural granulomatous inflammation of the stomach, or small and/or large intestine ( Fig. 1-169A ). Nonulcerated areas of the mucosa and draining lymph nodes contain multifocal to diffuse infiltrations of macrophages laden with H. capsulatum organisms within cytoplasmic vacuoles. Oval to round 2-5 \u00b5m diameter yeasts with a characteristic central spherical basophilic body surrounded by a clear halo ( Fig. 1-169B ) usually can be readily observed with hematoxylin and eosin stain; however, periodic acid-Schiff stain highlights the organisms in tissues. Microscopic diagnosis of gastrointestinal histoplasmosis is not difficult, but grossly the disease must be distinguished from intestinal lymphoma and in the colon, and from colitis of other types. Histoplasmosis is discussed in detail in Vol. 3, Hematopoietic system. Aulakh HK, et A B (roundworms), trematodes (flukes), and cestodes (tapeworms). The diagnosis of disease resulting from gastrointestinal helminths must be made with knowledge of their pathogenic potential and the mechanisms by which it is expressed. Parasites are much more common than the diseases they cause, and \"helminthiasis,\" the state of infection, must be clearly differentiated from \"helminthosis,\" the state of disease. According to their action on the host and pathogenesis of disease, gastrointestinal helminths fall into 5 categories: 1. The first group, including some nematodes and cestodes, resides free in the lumen of the intestine, competing with the host for nutrients in the gut content. They are generally of low pathogenicity, except for rare massive infections, and are not likely to be lethal, except by obstruction. Some of these worms, in sufficient numbers, may cause subclinical disease such as inefficient growth, or clinical disease in the form of ill-thrift; others are essentially nonpathogenic. Lesions caused by Prototheca spp. are predominantly cutaneous infections of cats and human, mastitis in cows, and gastrointestinal or disseminated infections in dogs. The pathogenesis of protothecosis is not completely understood. Traumatic inoculation is thought to lead to cutaneous infection in humans and cats. An environmental pathogen in dairy cows, P. zopfii probably gains access to the mammary gland by invasion of the teat canal. In dogs, the colon has been proposed as a primary site of infection, with dissemination to other organs, including eyes, brain, liver, kidneys, bone marrow, and skin. The prognosis following dissemination in dogs is usually considered poor.",

            "text": "Factors predisposing to the development of intestinal protothecosis are poorly understood. Immunosuppression may account for the sporadic incidence of disease in dogs; Collies and Boxer dogs have been overrepresented in some reports, suggesting breed-related susceptibility. Perhaps Prototheca spp. is an opportunistic invader of existing mucosal lesions. Cattle, horses, and wild pigs pass Prototheca spp. in the feces without apparent clinical disease.Clinical signs in dogs often include chronic, episodic, and intractable, hemorrhagic large-bowel diarrhea, with progressive weight loss. Hemorrhagic and ulcerative colitis is the first and most consistent enteric lesion. In dogs with disseminated disease intestinal lesions may be subtle; dissemination via the hematogenous or lymphatic route most commonly affects the eyes, central nervous system, kidneys, and heart. Mesenteric lymph nodes may be enlarged. Histologically, the cellular host inflammatory response to infection can vary; granulomatous to pyogranulomatous ulcerative colitis is typical. Intracellular and extracellular algal organisms are observed in variable numbers, depending on the severity of disease in affected tissue. In cases of disseminated disease, granulomas containing organisms can be found in various organs.Prototheca in tissue sections stained with hematoxylin and eosin can be difficult to visualize; periodic acid-Schiff or silver stains are helpful. The algae are unicellular, nonbudding, round to oval spherules with a refractile capsule, and range in size from 5-12 \u00b5m (P. wickerhamii) to 10-25 \u00b5m (P. zopfii). The presence of multiple wedge-shaped endospores within a single sporangium characterizes Prototheca spp. Other potentially pathogenic algal organisms that also undergo endosporulation such as Chlorella contain periodic acid-Schiff-positive cytoplasmic starch granules that are PAS-negative after diastase digestion; this test can be helpful for differentiation of these organisms. Culture, cytology, and fluorescent antibody tests are also helpful ancillary diagnostic techniques. ancylostomosis is due to increased loss of erythrocytes, iron, and plasma protein.Animals that succumb to ancylostomosis are characteristically extremely pale. There is often edema of subcutaneous tissue and mesentery, and serous effusion into body cavities, attributable to hypoproteinemia. In chronic infections, cachexia may be evident. If recent exposure to heavy percutaneous infection has occurred, there may be dermatitis, and multifocal hemorrhages throughout the pulmonary parenchyma because of larval migration. The intestinal mucosa is often diffusely red or has pinpoint red foci where adults have previously fed. Parasites are 1-1.5 cm long, translucent, gray or red depending on when they last consumed blood, and dispersed over the mucosa of the small intestine and less commonly into the large intestine. In a young pup, as few as 20-50 worms may cause fatal infection, and they may be easily overlooked.Uncinaria stenocephala mainly infects by the oral route. Percutaneous infection is not efficient, although dermatitis may occur; prenatal and lactogenic transmission appear not to occur. This species sucks little blood and is less pathogenic than A. caninum; however, heavy infections with this species (burdens of >1,000 worms) may cause clinical disease and occasional mortality in pups. Nonspecific signs of infection include lethargy, inappetence, and ill-thrift and perhaps diarrhea; hypoproteinemia may be observed, but anemia does not occur.The lesions are similar to those found in ancylostomosis. Grossly, the intestinal mucosa appears thickened, with scattered focal hemorrhages at sites of attachment. Histologic lesions may include moderate atrophy and thickening of villi and irregularity of the surface epithelium. There are aggregates of inflammatory cells, including neutrophils, secondary to the damage induced by deep attachment of adult worms. Disease caused by U. stenocephala is the result of protein loss and malabsorption. A similar syndrome may be associated with heavy infections of A. braziliense, in which hypoproteinemia also occurs.All of these hookworms are zoonotic. In humans, A. braziliense is most commonly associated with cutaneous larva migrans; other hookworm species larvae less commonly cause eosinophilic pneumonitis, myositis, or ocular lesions. A. caninum has been shown to mature to adulthood and cause eosinophilic enteritis in humans.The hookworms of ruminants include the following: in cattle, Bunostomum phlebotomum, and in India and Indonesia, Agriostomum vryburgi; in sheep, B. trigonocephalum and, in India and Southeast Asia, Africa, and South America, Gaigeria pachyscelis. The life cycle of these nematodes is typical of hookworms. Bunostomum third-stage larvae infect by the oral or percutaneous routes, whereas Gaigeria only infect across the skin. Eggs and larval stages on the ground are extremely susceptible to desiccation, and hookworm disease in ruminants is most common in tropical or subtropical areas during wet seasons. Stabled animals in cooler temperate areas may be affected by larvae invading the skin from contaminated bedding. Following skin penetration, the usual pattern is seen, with migration of larvae to the lungs, where they molt to the fourth stage, and subsequently pass up the trachea to the digestive tract. Larvae taken in by ingestion spend some time in the deep mucosa of the intestine before emerging to mature in the lumen of the small intestine. The prepatent period of Bunostomum is long, approximately 7-8 weeks. Gaigeria larvae Hookworm infection. Members of the family Ancylostomatidae infect dogs, cats, ruminants, and swine. Hookworms of the genus Globocephalus appear to be of little significance in swine. In dogs, Ancylostoma caninum, A. braziliense, and A. ceylanicum occur. The former is most common in tropical, subtropical, and warm temperate zones of Africa, Australia, Asia, and North America, where adequate humidity for larval development occurs. A. braziliense occurs in dogs and cats in the tropics and subtropics, whereas A. ceylanicum is found in both species in Sri Lanka and Southeast Asia. Uncinaria stenocephala occurs in dogs in cool temperate regions of Europe and North America. A. tubaeformae only occurs in the cat.Ancylostoma spp. are capable of infecting the host by 4 routes: (1) orally, with direct development to adult worms in the intestine; (2) by skin penetration, resulting in movement through the bloodstream to the lungs, and then by tracheal migration to the pharynx and the intestine; (3) by the lactogenic transmission of third-stage larvae mobilized from dormancy in the skeletal muscle of parturient bitches; and (4) occasionally by prenatal transplacental transmission of mobilized larvae. The latter route of transmission does not apparently occur in A. braziliense infection. Some larvae of A. caninum may become arrested at the third stage in the intestine, to resume development at a later time.Ancylostomosis is the result of persistent blood loss, resulting in anemia and hypoproteinemia in affected individuals. Ancylostoma spp. usually inhabit the small intestine, where they move about the surface, intermittently attaching several times a day to feed. They penetrate deeply into the mucosa, sometimes to the muscularis mucosae, as they take a plug of host tissue into their large buccal capsule. Host tissue is lacerated by large teeth and parasite-produced anticoagulant is released locally, which permits persistent blood flow. Blood loss is maximal while worms are attaining maturity between 12 and 16 days after infection, and then again during the peak period of egg production after 3-4 weeks of infection. The prepatent period for A. caninum is \u223c15 days.There is considerable variation in the blood-sucking activity, and therefore the pathogenicity, of members of the genus. A. caninum consumes in the range of 0.01-0.2 mL of blood per worm per day, which in young puppies and kittens can represent a significant percentage of their blood volume. Experimentally, 200 A. tubaeformae worms cause anemia, weight loss, and mortality in 1.5-kg cats. Anemia in ancylostomosis is at first normochromic and normocytic; however, suckling pups with ancylostomosis are susceptible to rapid development of microcytic hypochromic anemia because of their poor iron reserves and the low iron levels in the dam's milk.Acute fatal ancylostomosis occurs most commonly in 2-3 week-old pups infected via the lactogenic route. Heavy infections acquired by this route may result in death from acute anemia and hypoproteinemia before eggs are present in the feces. Chronic anemia may also lead to mortality of pups after a longer course. Percutaneous infection occurs in older dogs housed in suboptimal conditions in which moisture and temperature are conducive to larval development. Dermatitis caused by larval penetration may be observed between the toes or on ventral contact surfaces of the body. Ancylostomosis in older dogs is usually characterized by anemia, exercise intolerance, weakness, and emaciation. Watery feces may contain mucus or blood; however, the major effect of Oesophagostomum and Chabertia infection. Members of the genus Oesophagostomum infect sheep, cattle, and swine. Two species in sheep, O. columbianum and O. venulosum, are most significant; the former is considerably more pathogenic and is particularly important in warm temperate to tropical areas. After ingestion, infective third-stage larvae penetrate the intestinal wall and encyst deep in the mucosa, inciting the formation of inflammatory nodules in the wall of the intestine. After \u223c1 week, they molt, emerge, and mature into adults in the colon. A proportion of fourth-stage larvae encyst within nodules in the colonic submucosa. Adult worms in the colon may be pathogenic for lambs, and burdens of only a few hundred O. columbianum are associated with anorexia, mucoid feces or diarrhea, and ill-thrift.Gross lesions associated with clinical oesophagostomosis are nonspecific and include emaciation, enlarged mesenteric lymph nodes, and thickened and congested colonic mucosa with a layer of mucus in which the adult worms are scattered. Histologically there is hyperplasia of goblet cells, and the lamina propria contains a heavy mixed inflammatory infiltrate with many eosinophils. Globule leukocytes are in the epithelium of glands. Nodules caused by fourth-stage larvae are found mainly in the large intestine. These nodules are \u223c0.5-1 cm in diameter and comprised of a central caseous or mineralized core, eosinophils, giant cells, and macrophages often centered on the nematode (or its remnant), and surrounded by a thin fibrous capsule. Similar nodules may be found in liver, lungs, mesentery, and mesenteric lymph nodes. Those in the deeper layers of the gut project from the serosal surface and give rise to the name pimply gut. They may cause adhesion to adjacent abdominal viscera, intussusception, or Coccidiosis in sheep and goats. Coccidial infection is universal in sheep and goats, and coccidiosis can be a significant problem in the young of both species. The etiology of coccidiosis in these species is complicated by the morphologic similarity of the coccidia infecting sheep and goats. Assumptions on the potential for cross-infection of coccidia between sheep and goats, and of the species found in each host, have been revised as new taxonomic and biologic information has come to light.About a dozen species of coccidia are found in each of sheep and goats. Of these, three (Eimeria pallida, E. caprovina, E. punctata) may occur in both sheep and goats, although the validity of E. punctata as a species is questioned. Eight species pairs of Eimeria occur, in which the coccidia look and behave similarly in sheep and goats, but do not cross-infect. Listing the sheep-adapted species of each pair first, these are:Two species are unique to sheep, E. weybridgensis (formerly E. arloingi \"B\"), and E. marsica; in goats, one species, E. caprina, is unique. In addition, giant schizonts of an unknown coccidian, termed Eimeria (Globidium) gilruthi, are seen incidentally as pinpoint white foci in the abomasum of sheep and goats. An individual case of proliferative abomasitis associated with this parasite was described in a sheep. The taxonomic confusion has been carried over into descriptions of the natural or experimental disease, because many infections were of mixed species, resulted from Besnoitia infection. Besnoitia spp. are also obligatorily heteroxenous, but the definitive host for many species has not been identified. Some stages of merogony and gametogony occur in the intestine of the only definitive host yet known, the cat, where they are not known to be pathogenic. Oocysts are shed unsporulated, and resemble those of Toxoplasma and Hammondia when sporulated. Meronts in the intermediate host develop in mesenchymal cells, probably fibroblasts, which become massively hypertrophic, forming cysts containing many clusters of merozoites (bradyzoites) in the host cell cytoplasm. Among domestic animals, cysts of B. besnoiti may assume some significance in the skin of cattle and goats (Vol. 1, Integumentary system), and Besnoitia cysts have been reported in association with laryngeal polyps in a horse.

Respiratory infection is most significant in birds, and disease in mammals is generally enteric.

Sarcocystis infection. Sarcocystis is comprised of \u223c200 obligatorily heteroxenous species. Inconspicuous sexual stages occur in the epithelium at the tips of villi in the small intestine, and oocysts sporulate in the subepithelial lamina propria, producing two sporocysts within a thin oocyst wall. Sporocysts containing four sporozoites are shed in feces. These are infective to intermediate hosts, in which three generations of merogony occur in vascular endothelium, and a final cyst containing first metrocytes (mother cells), which produce merozoites (bradyzoites), is formed in myocytes and occasionally other cells. Ingestion of tissue cysts containing bradyzoites initiates gametogony in the definitive host. There is apparently no resistance to the development of gamonts, and no disease is associated with them in the definitive host.Many species of Sarcocystis are recognized, based on preypredator cycles, for instance, between cattle and dogs, and cattle and cats. Sporogony of a given species usually occurs in only one or a few genera of carnivores. The number of species capable of acting as intermediate hosts may be narrow or wide, depending on the species of Sarcocystis.Sarcocystis cysts in ovine and, occasionally, bovine muscle may be grossly visible, causing losses at meat inspection. Eosinophilic myositis can result from granulomas caused by Sarcocystis infection of muscle. However, studies have shown that unaffected muscle often harbors more of these organisms than the inflamed portions. Sarcocystis infection in cattle (S. cruzi), sheep (S. tenella), and swine (S. miescheriana), and, experimentally, in goats (S. capracanis), may cause acute fatal disease characterized by anemia and widespread hemorrhage, which is associated with clotting disorders. As the disease progresses, cattle may develop inappetence, weight loss, reduced milk yield, hyperexcitability, hair loss, and in some animals, nervous signs. Ill-thrift associated with Sarcocystis infection may also occur in other species. Both syndromes are initiated during the endothelial phase of the infection. As well,",

            "text": "Giardia spp. are flagellate protists that inhabit the small intestine of a wide range of vertebrates. The taxonomy of the genus is difficult. It appears that 4 or 5 morphologically distinct \"species\" exist, each with a relatively wide host range within amphibians, birds, rodents, and other mammals. Giardia duodenalis (= G. lamblia) infection is common in humans, and it also occurs in a wide array of mammals. Although morphologically similar, molecular genetic investigations have identified at least 7 genotypes within G. duodenalis, several of which (assemblages A and B) infect humans. Hoofed animals are infected by assemblages A and E, the former being potentially zoonotic, dogs by assemblages C and D, and cats by assemblage F. Giardia infection has been associated with disease, with various degrees of credibility, in most of these hosts. In an experimental model, genotypes A and B appear to be more infectious and cause more severe mucosal injury.Giardia trophozoites are pyriform in outline, \u223c10-20 \u00b5m long by 5-15 \u00b5m wide and 2-4 \u00b5m thick, and convex on the dorsal surface. The concave ventral surface is modified by the presence of a disk that functions in attachment. Nutrient absorption seems to occur through the dorsal surface. A pair of nuclei, 2 axonemes, 2 medial bodies, and 4 pairs of flagella are present, and the organisms multiply by binary fission in the gut lumen. They apply their ventral aspect to the microvillus surface of enterocytes, usually between villi, in folds on the villus surface, or occasionally in crypts of Lieberk\u00fchn. Giardia has been demonstrated in the mucosa, but this is an unusual and probably aberrant location. Relatively resistant oval cysts are passed in the feces, and transmission is by the fecal-oral route.The significance of Giardia as a pathogen in humans and other species has been controversial because asymptomatic infection is the rule. However, under some circumstances Giardia may cause disease. How the host-parasite relationship is modified, and the pathogenesis of the disease, are still unclear.In young dogs and cats, in which giardiosis is most important, although still uncommon, the main sign is intermittent or chronic diarrhea, which may persist for several months. The stool is soft, pale, mucoid, and greasy. Although appetite is not usually impaired, there may be a reduced growth rate or weight loss, suggesting malabsorption. A poor hair coat is attributed to deficiency of fat-soluble vitamins. Among animals other than dogs and cats, Giardia seems most convincingly to be associated with enteric signs in neonatal calves, which may pass soft mucoid feces, and have a reduced growth rate.Gastrointestinal dysfunction has not been extensively documented in domestic animals. However, in a variety of experimental systems, deficiencies in microvillus-associated digestive enzymes, electrolyte and glucose malabsorption, and microvillus shortening or injury have been documented, although not consistently. Some humans with Giardia infection have malabsorption of D-xylose and vitamin B 12 , with steatorrhea and hypocarotinemia. Excess fecal fat has been found in infected cats, but was not demonstrated in experimentally infected rats.",

            "text": "Entamoeba histolytica is the cause of amebiasis in humans, nonhuman primates, and, rarely, in other species, including dogs and cattle; cats are susceptible to experimental infection. Infection in dogs is sporadic, probably acquired by exposure to cysts in feces from infected humans. Dogs tend not to pass encysted amebae; hence it has been suggested that they present little public health hazard, and are unlikely to support spread from dog to dog. However, under some circumstances, cysts may be shed, and fecal material containing motile trophozoites has been used to transmit infection orally to other dogs.Amebae are usually nonpathogenic inhabitants of the lumen of the large bowel, but sometimes they cause colitis. The diet and immune status of the host, and virulence attributes of various strains of the organism, seem to influence pathogenicity. Adhesion to mucus by specific lectins, enzymatic degradation of mucus, and lectin-mediated adherence of amebae to host epithelium are essential steps leading to tissue damage. Cysteine proteinases produced by E. histolytica contribute to epithelial cell damage and to induction of inflammation, both of which are involved in initiation of mucosal lesions. Cytolysis is induced by in-contact amebae.Amebiasis in dogs is associated with diarrheic or mucoid feces, perhaps with some blood, or with dysentery. Erosive mucosal colitis or ulcerative colitis occurs in dogs with amebiasis, and disease seems more common or severe in animals with concomitant Trichuris or Ancylostoma infection.Early lesions in human amebiasis seem to be diffuse acute mucosal colitis, with focal erosions or ulcerations. Amebae, although scarce, may be found in mucus on the colonic surface, but are most numerous in the fibrinocellular exudate over erosions or superficial ulcers. Ulcers advance as an area of necrosis and predominantly neutrophilic infiltrate, causing loss of glands, and extending for the full depth of the mucosa. Initial lesions consist of tiny erosions of the surface epithelium that evolve to deeper, more extensive ulcers. Established ulcerative amebic colitis classically has a flask-shaped ulcer, the narrow neck through the mucosa, and the broad base in the submucosa. There amebae, and necrosis, expand laterally, apparently less constrained by the architecture of the tissue. Intestinal perforations and intramural abscesses may form.Amebae may be present, commonly in small clusters, in necrotic debris or in adjacent viable tissue, frequently not involved in an inflammatory reaction. Amebae in tissue, often surrounded by a clear halo, may be spherical or irregular, with extended pseudopodia, and are \u223c6-50 \u00b5m in diameter. The nucleus has a central dense karyosome and peripheral chromatin clumps. The cytoplasm may appear foamy, can contain remnants of erythrocytes in phagolysosomes, and contains glycogen, which makes the cytoplasm periodic acid-Schiff-positive. The lesions of established amebiasis in the colon of dogs resemble those in humans; the early lesions may as well.Although dissemination of amebae, with abscessation in other organs, especially liver, lung, and brain, is a relatively common complication in humans, it seems rare in dogs. One such case occurred in an animal with canine distemper. Hemoperitoneum is the presence of blood or hemorrhagic effusion in the peritoneal cavity. The amount present at death is not necessarily an indication of the volume of bleeding during life, because the blood may be removed quite rapidly via diaphragmatic lymphatics. Blood in the cavity may remain fluid or be partially clotted. Hemoperitoneum can be traumatic or atraumatic (spontaneous), and is seen most commonly in the dog and cat as a result of blunt or penetrating trauma. Spontaneous hemoperitoneum usually is associated with one of many pathologic processes, including hepatic or splenic torsion or rupture, gastric dilation and volvulus, coagulopathies, and neoplastic processes involving the liver, spleen, kidney, or other abdominal organs. When traumatic in origin, the liver and spleen are most commonly involved. Splenic hemangiosarcoma or hematoma, which may bleed into the abdomen, are the most common causes of spontaneous hemoperitoneum in dogs past middle age. Enlargement of liver or spleen because of infiltrating neoplastic cells, fat, or amyloid predisposes to rupture. Fine fissures in the capsule of the liver resulting in hemorrhage have been reported in infectious canine hepatitis.In several species, acquired coagulopathies following ingestion of anticoagulant rodenticides cause hemorrhage that results in unclotted blood in the abdomen. Calves born of cows that have been fed moldy sweet-clover hay hemorrhage from the umbilical vessels into the peritoneal cavity and elsewhere. Manual ablation of a corpus luteum is a source of hemorrhage in cattle. In cattle and horses, laceration of the uterus or rupture of a uterine artery at parturition can result in fatal hemorrhage. In horses, hemoperitoneum may be due to hemorrhage from granulosa-thecal cell tumor of the ovary, and in all species any friable intra-abdominal or retroperitoneal neoplasm may occasionally rupture and hemorrhage if traumatized.Hemorrhage on or beneath the peritoneal surface without free blood in the cavity may occur in acute bacterial toxemias and in other conditions that interfere with vascular integrity or hemostasis. Peritoneal hemorrhage must be differentiated from hemorrhagic peritonitis, which is an important lesion in some diseases. Subserosal hemorrhage and hemomelasma ilei occasionally occur on the intestine of the horse; this lesion has long been attributed to migration of strongyles. Rarely, subserosal hematomas may cause intestinal obstruction. Hemorrhage into an omental or mesenteric cyst can cause sudden abdominal enlargement without free blood in the abdomen.",

            "text": "Abnormal contents in the peritoneal cavity Foreign materials within the peritoneal cavity, such as urine, ingesta, blood, or air indicate an abnormality of another organ. Uroperitoneum in adults usually results from rupture of the urinary bladder, urethra, or ureters, which most frequently occurs as a consequence of urethral obstruction, particularly in ruminants. Uroperitoneum in neonates is associated with sepsis, and is described as a consequence of inflammation or congenital abnormalities involving the urachus or urethra.Ingesta in the peritoneal cavity caused by bowel rupture or perforation occurs in horses and cattle, less frequently in swine, sheep, and goats, and rarely in dogs and cats. The site of perforation or rupture is usually easy to find, especially when the animal dies before peritonitis develops; once the intestines and mesenteries become adhered together, the primary site of perforation may be very difficult to discover. Ingesta may leak from any devitalized segment of small or large bowel as a consequence of impaction and pressure necrosis, tympany and rupture, or perforation either from sharp objects or deep mucosal ulceration. Cecal rupture in cattle following overload or impaction is reported; this condition in other species is rare. Rectal perforation can cause contamination of the abdomen with feces, and these lesions may be difficult to discover during postmortem examination. Rectal perforation in horses is most commonly secondary to accidental iatrogenic injury during rectal palpation, but can also occur secondary to dystocia; most tears occur 25-30 cm from the anus on the dorsal aspect of the rectum. Deep tears that involve the tunica muscularis have potential for contamination of the peritoneal cavity and secondary peritonitis. If the serosa remains intact, the potential exists for development of subserosal or rectal diverticula, perineal abscessation or fistula, pelvic cellulitis, or other complications. If these lesions progress and eventually perforate the mesorectum, gross fecal contamination of the peritoneum occurs.Any portion of the bowel may easily rupture as a postmortem artifact; therefore postmortem rupture of a viscus must be differentiated from an antemortem lesion. The margin of a postmortem defect lacks hemorrhage and exudate, and the peritoneal surfaces are not inflamed.Pneumoperitoneum arises from traumatic perforation of the abdominal wall (including surgery), from diaphragmatic tears in horses with concurrent pneumothorax, or from leakage of gas and liquid contents from a gastrointestinal perforation. Rarely, pneumoperitoneum can develop secondary to rupture of the urinary bladder or the female reproductive tract. bulk of hepatic lymph comes from the space of Disse, which is separated from the sinusoidal lumen by fenestrated endothelium that is freely permeable to plasma constituents, including large protein molecules. Hence, the formation of hepatic lymph is not regulated by plasma oncotic pressure, but is sensitive to small changes in hydrostatic pressure in the sinusoids. This accounts for the frequency with which ascites is associated with diseases that cause increased central and hepatic venous pressure, or increased intrahepatic resistance to blood flow. If the capacity of the hepatic lymphatics is exceeded, then high-protein lymph oozes from the extensive lymphatic plexus along the hepatic capsule, and it may spill from efferent lymphatics passing from the porta hepatis to the cisterna chyli. In hepatic ascites these efferent lymphatics become very large, numerous, and thick walled.The fluid that enters the peritoneal cavity is continually in flux. Gross ascites will only develop when the normal high capacity to drain fluid from the abdomen is exceeded by the rate of production, and this requires an increase in renal retention of sodium and water. The initiating factors causing excess of total body salt and water are uncertain, but contributing factors include increase of adrenal medullary hormones, increased sympathetic output leading to reduced natriuresis, and activation of the renin-angiotensin system. Renal factors, including reduced excretion of water and increased reabsorption of sodium, are important in perpetuating the condition. The resultant expansion of plasma volume permits the development of edema and ascites in congestive heart failure, and ascites in hepatic disease. It also further increases hydrostatic pressure in the hepatic sinusoids, driving lymph production to the point that ascites develops. Secondarily, reduced effective vascular volume, associated with sequestration of fluid in ascites, expansion of the splanchnic circulation, and other systemic circulatory events, also causes sodium retention via the renin-angiotensin pathway, with aldosterone secretion, and by parallel mechanisms. In heart failure, activation of the renin-angiotensin system is expected, because of reduced effective vascular volume.Hypoproteinemia caused by reduced hepatic synthesis may occur in severe liver disease. Normally, oncotic forces are subsidiary to hydrostatic forces at the level of the sinusoid in affecting the formation of lymph. However, in diffuse fibrosis, once advanced capillarization of sinusoids occurs, the free permeability of the hepatic vascular system to the flow of large molecules is reduced. In this circumstance, reduced plasma oncotic pressure caused by hypoalbuminemia promotes continued hepatic lymph formation and ascites; it also promotes fluid flux to the peritoneum across the splanchnic capillary bed.Hypoproteinemia of nonhepatic origin is most commonly associated with protein-losing enteropathy, such as Johne's disease in ruminants, or with protein-losing nephropathy, such as glomerular amyloidosis. Severe hypoproteinemia reduces plasma oncotic pressure, promoting edema and permitting transudate to accumulate in serous spaces, including the peritoneal cavity.Vascular injury in the portal circulation allows increased permeability to plasma protein and substantially favors development of ascites. Mild ascites may occur in a variety of systemic illnesses altering vascular permeability, such as the clostridial intoxications, endotoxemia, acute uremic syndromes in ruminants and pigs, and in exudative diathesis of pigs with vitamin E deficiency.",

            "text": "Ascites, or hydroperitoneum, is the presence of excess fluid, usually a modified transudate, in the peritoneal cavity. Ascites occurs because of reduced removal of, or overproduction of, fluid in the abdominal cavity. Ascitic fluid is generally watery and clear or straw-colored, and contains few leukocytes but possibly numerous desquamated mesothelial cells. The serosal lining is normal and glistening but may become slightly opaque as a result of subserosal edema.Reduced removal of fluid from the peritoneal cavity is mainly caused by obstruction of lymphatic drainage through the diaphragm. Limited area for direct-to-lymphatic absorption and the small size of stomata on the diaphragmatic and pelvic serosa explain the ease and rapidity with which peritoneal drainage can be blocked. An example is peritoneal carcinomatosis, in which neoplastic cells implant throughout the abdomen; when they implant on the diaphragm in the region of the lymphatic stomata, obstruction of lymphatic drainage occurs. Ascites may also develop if there is obstruction to sternal lymphatic flow cranial to the diaphragm. This may occur with sclerosing lymphadenitis or space-occupying lesions in the ventral or cranial mediastinum, and is common in lymphosarcoma of adult cattle.Overproduction of peritoneal lymph is mainly related to altered hydrostatic pressure gradients in the hepatic and portal circulation, except for chylous ascites, which results when the cisterna chyli leak triglyceride-rich milky fluid into the abdomen. Increased prehepatic portal venous pressure alone does not usually lead to ascites; if present, such fluid is low protein, being derived from intestinal and mesenteric interstitial fluid. Acute portal vein obstruction causes intestinal infarction and death, but not ascites. Slowly developing portal hypertension of prehepatic, hepatic, or hepatic venous origin may cause transient ascites, which resolves with the development of collateral portal-postcaval venous shunts within a few weeks. However, portal hypertension of cardiac origin does not result in portocaval shunts, because the elevation in central venous pressure permits no pressure gradient between the portal and postcaval systems. The sine qua non of hepatic ascites is increased resistance in the intrahepatic or posthepatic circulation. The exception is the increase in portal blood flow caused by hepatic arteriovenous fistulas or anastomoses; in this circumstance, hydrostatic pressure at the level of the hepatic sinusoids is elevated by the arterialization of the portal flow.The usual conditions causing increased hepatic or posthepatic resistance to blood flow are fibrosis of the liver and congestive heart failure, respectively. In diffuse fibrosis, intrahepatic resistance may be compounded by the development of arteriovenous anastomoses in the fibrous septa around nodules; these arterialize the hepatic portal circulation, further elevating hydrostatic pressure. Additional causes of portal hypertension include: primary neoplasms of the liver, especially cholangiocellular carcinomas, which tend to be diffuse and infiltrative; secondary tumors, especially lymphosarcomas, which widely infiltrate the liver; extensive infestation with hydatid cysts; and chronic biliary trematodiasis, or other causes of chronic cholangiohepatitis and portal fibrosis. Tumors or abscesses in or compressing the hepatic vein as it leaves the liver, or obstructions in the caudal vena cava cranial to the entry of the hepatic vein, may also cause posthepatic obstruction.When the liver is congested, there is increased flow of hepatic lymph, which has a high concentration of protein.

            "text": "Necrosis of mesenteric or other abdominal or retroperitoneal fat occurs either as a consequence of pancreatitis in several species, or as a poorly understood condition affecting the abdominal fat predominantly of ruminants.In pancreatic necrosis, enzymatic necrosis of peripancreatic adipose tissue is always seen, and may in fact be the initial morphologic change. In acute pancreatic necrosis, discrete foci or confluent masses of white necrotic adipose tissue are surrounded by a zone of intense hyperemia with fibrin deposited on the surface. Such lesions may be limited to the peripancreatic fat or be distributed throughout the abdominal cavity. Histologically, there is necrosis of adipocytes containing acidophilic, opaque, amorphous, or basophilic fibrillar to granular mineralized material. The necrosis is attributed to release of proteolytic and lipolytic enzymes from damaged pancreatic acini, and to degeneration of neutrophils recruited to the area.Massive fat necrosis in cattle is reported most frequently in Channel Island breeds and occurs in older animals that may be excessively fat. The disease is characterized by the formation of multifocal masses of necrotic fat of various sizes that may coalesce to involve significant portions of the abdominal cavity. Although it is often an incidental finding, it can cause clinical signs and even death if there is compression or obstruction of abdominal viscera. Necrosis may occur in any portion of the omental, mesenteric, and retroperitoneal fat, and has been observed in intermuscular and subcutaneous fat. Initially there is acute inflammation, and the hard necrotic masses are surrounded by a zone of hyperemia; the overlying peritoneum may be necrotic, perhaps with adhesions to adjacent viscera. On cut section these nodular masses are firm, dry, and chalky, or sometimes moist, oily, and deep yellow. Because of the unusual bulk of the necrotic tissue in some cases, and because necrotic fat is sometimes found in abnormal locations, such as under the serosa of the intestine, the condition has been called from omental bursitis.

            "text": "The consequences of peritonitis vary widely from insignificant to catastrophic. Acute generalized peritonitis is a catastrophic sequel of many local diseases of the abdominal cavity, but it may be a relatively insignificant secondary event in generalized infections. Obviously peritonitis does not significantly affect the outcome of Escherichia coli septicemia or of clostridial infections such as blackleg or braxy. Within the first few hours of generalized peritonitis, there may be intestinal hypermotility; however, paralytic ileus, mediated by autonomic innervation, soon supervenes. Initially ileus may be beneficial as exudates are no longer further distributed by intestinal movement, but development of fibrinous adhesions between loops of intestine can be significant and eventually produce fibrous adhesions and their sequelae.The systemic effects of generalized peritonitis are largely related to detrimental effects on cardiovascular function, circulatory homeostasis, and acid-base balance. These are partly the result of sequestration of fluid and plasma proteins in the peritoneal exudate; sequestration of fluid and electrolyte in immotile intestinal tract; and loss of intestinal absorptive function. Endotoxin and exotoxins, such as those produced by clostridia, may be absorbed into the circulation, directly through the peritoneum or via the lymphatic drainage, causing increased vascular permeability, shock, and other detrimental cardiovascular effects. Death from toxemia may result before overt peritonitis develops. Bacteria may spread via the lymphatics to the pleura and the sternal or mediastinal nodes, or may reach the general circulation, causing septicemia.Not all cases of generalized peritonitis are immediately fatal. Depending on the nature, distribution, and severity of the exudate, the lesions may resolve completely, mature into fibrous adhesions, or persist in some localized areas as chronic active peritonitis or abscessation. In uncomplicated situations, peritoneal lesions are debrided by phagocytes; fibroplasia neovascularization and collagen deposition occur within days, and mesothelial restoration is accomplished by 5-8 days after the insult. Because the mesothelium differentiates from mesenchymal elements in the subserosa or from free-floating peritoneal stem cells, reconstitution of the mesothelium is not affected by the size of the defect.Damage to, or loss of the peritoneal lining may diminish the fibrinolytic activity of mesothelium. Fibrin between damaged serosal surfaces persisting beyond 3-4 days after the original insult becomes progressively organized and mature, resulting in formation of fibrous adhesions. Downstream effects vary depending on the location of adhesions, but there may be persistent adhesion of adjacent structures, or stenosis or compression of abdominal viscera resulting in impaired motility, obstruction, or circulatory embarrassment. Fibrous adhesions may remodel and occasionally separate, but often persist as scars on the serosa.Formation of adhesions seems to be promoted by ischemia, increasing severity of tissue necrosis, foreign material such as sutures on the serosa, and by sepsis; all of these increase and prolong the inflammatory response. Determining the duration of peritonitis may be important in cases such as iatrogenic rectal perforation, and its assessment requires careful gross and microscopic examination of the serosal surface and the primary or secondary; as acute or chronic; as local or diffuse; as septic or nonseptic; and on the basis of the type of exudate, which may be serofibrinous, fibrinopurulent, purulent, hemorrhagic, or granulomatous. Differences in distribution, type of exudate, and duration of the lesion can be more or less anticipated from the source and the cause. Most cases of peritonitis in domestic animals are secondary; that is, they arise as complications of other events in the abdomen, but primary serositis in systemic infections is of much importance for agricultural livestock. The causes of peritonitis are numerous and varied, so only some of the more common and important of them are considered here.Chemical peritonitis may be induced by a variety of agents. Intraperitoneal instillation of a number of therapeutic agents causes mild and usually inconsequential peritonitis; however, abdominal lavage has been associated with more severe serosal damage and formation of adhesions. Surgical glove powders, including talc or starch, provoke granulomatous peritonitis; starch granules have a characteristic Maltese cross appearance in polarized light, and are periodic acid-Schiff-positive. Accidental leakage of barium sulfate into the abdomen during contrast studies causes a potentially fatal hemorrhagic peritonitis that progresses over several days to severe granulomatous and fibrosing peritonitis. Leakage of barium is often concurrent with leakage of ingesta, and thus is frequently complicated by intercurrent sepsis.The most devastating forms of chemical peritonitis are endogenous, and are caused by bile and pancreatic enzymes. Bile peritonitis is associated with endothelial dysfunction and increased production of proinflammatory cytokines. Bile peritonitis is readily recognized by the typical yellow-green staining of visceral and parietal peritoneal surfaces; the lesions can be intense, and, especially if complicated by sepsis, can be fatal. Peritonitis associated with pancreatic necrosis is also common in dogs. The reaction within and adjacent to the pancreas is characterized by acute necrosis and neutrophilic inflammation; there is often adhesion of the lesser omentum to the pancreas, adjacent liver, and other organs. This local peritoneal reaction resolves completely if the animal survives, and only very minor adhesions or slight puckering of the mesentery persist with fibrosis in the pancreas. The peritoneal exudate of mostly neutrophils may be scant, but contains droplets of fats and soaps released from the adipose tissue by the pancreatic enzymes. Rarely, acute accumulation of chyle in the peritoneum occurs secondary to acute pancreatitis, and this causes a peritoneal reaction referred to as chylous peritonitis.Bacterial peritonitis may occur if bacteria reach the peritoneum by direct implantation after perforation of a contaminated external surface. It most commonly originates with peritoneal contamination by ingesta from a perforation or rupture of the gastrointestinal tract; however, bacteria also can be introduced from the skin or in females via the reproductive tract. Endometritis caused by tuberculosis or brucellosis in cows, and brucellosis in sows, may extend to the peritoneum through the uterine tubes. Cystitis and rupture of the urinary bladder may also cause peritonitis. Bacterial peritonitis is also common as an extension from a localized inflammatory reaction in an abdominal viscus or the umbilicus, or as a component of bacteremia or septicemia. For example, acute serofibrinous peritonitis may occur by extension through the wall of an intestine with localized necrosis, or from a uterus just before rupture. Secondary peritonitis occasionally results by extension from retroperitoneal infection, or in ruminants",

            "text": "Acute diffuse fibrinopurulent peritonitis is common in cattle, and is usually the result of perforation of a viscus, including the gastrointestinal or reproductive tracts. Perforation initially results in local acute disease, which is typically followed by diffuse chronic peritonitis with adhesions. Diffuse fibrinous traumatic reticuloperitonitis (hardware disease) may evolve to include septic reticulopericarditis if the offending foreign body migrates as far as the pericardial sac ( Fig. 1-197) . Disordered motility of the forestomachs, manifest clinically as vagus indigestion, may follow scarring that interferes with esophageal function.Cattle seem to have a relatively high capacity to localize and wall off septic foci within the peritoneal cavity, and abscesses frequently develop from such foci. Sometimes these may become quite large; mixed bacterial flora is most commonly isolated. Perforation of the abomasum or intestine is more likely to cause diffuse fibrinous or fibrinohemorrhagic peritonitis, but occasionally causes local chronic peritonitis and abscessation.In neonates, extension of infection from the umbilicus produces fibrinopurulent peritonitis, which tends to be most severe along the ventral abdominal wall, adjacent to associated liver abscesses, or extending along the urachus to the bladder. Fibrinous peritonitis may be an expression of polyserositis in neonatal calves with septicemic colibacillosis and neonatal streptococcal infection. Copious serofibrinous peritonitis (with similar lesions on other serous membranes) is typical of sporadic bovine encephalomyelitis. Diffuse fibrinohemorrhagic peritonitis occurs in most cases of clostridial hemoglobinuria, and in some cases of blackleg and septicemic pasteurellosis; a more localized peritonitis of this type occurs in clostridial enteritis of calves caused by C. perfringens type B and type C and in braxy.Tuberculosis, actinobacillosis, and infection with green algae are rarely reported causes of inflammatory lesions in the peritoneum of cattle.

            "text": "Diffuse peritonitis in horses is usually acute and fatal; this is perhaps associated in part with a small omentum, and a poor capacity to heal contaminated areas. In most cases the cause is rupture or perforation of the stomach or intestine with spillage of ingesta into the abdominal cavity. Purulent peritonitis and mesenteric lymphadenitis may be seen in Rhodococcus equi infection of foals. Intestinal infection of foals by Actinobacillus equuli causes fibrinous mesenteric lymphangitis and peritonitis. Clostridium perfringens in foals, and anthrax in older horses, causes acute hemorrhagic enteritis with peritonitis. Peritoneal lavage may cause severe diffuse chemical peritonitis. Seminoperitoneum caused by laceration of the vagina at breeding is an unusual cause of acute diffuse nonseptic peritonitis; sperm are present in the cytoplasm of neutrophils. Chronic diffuse peritonitis is virtually never recorded in horses, other than rare nocardiosis. Acute or chronic local peritonitis does occasionally occur after castration, and the colon may adhere to the inner inguinal area; from penetrating wounds originating from the skin; and from streptococcal abscesses in the mesentery. It may be secondary to local verminous lesions such as from suppurative gastritis in habronemiasis, or from gastrointestinal perforation associated with Gasterophilus or Anoplocephala infestation. Migrating Strongylus equinus or S. edentatus larvae are thought to cause retroperitoneal lesions in the flank, perirenal fat, and diaphragm; fibrous tags on the liver capsule; and chronic diffuse thickening and inflammation in the mesentery, omentum, and hepatorenal ligament. Large strongyles returning to the gut may cause focal peritoneal lesions on the ileum, cecum, and colon, and migration of large strongyles in the wall of the small intestine is thought to be a cause of hemomelasma ilei.Retroperitonitis may arise from sepsis involving the pelvic or abdominal urogenital tract, or the mesenteric root; from penetrating wounds; from rectal tears in horses; and from migrating grass awns or other foreign bodies. Frequently it evolves to form a fluctuant abscess or draining fistula in the flank, based on the path of least resistance in the soft tissue of the region. The lesion is usually a poorly encapsulated sinus or abscess, with a wall of granulation tissue and containing purulent exudate. It may extend to involve adjacent vertebrae as periostitis or osteomyelitis. A foreign body may be encountered on exploration, or the lesion may be traced back to a primary septic focus in the abdomen, perhaps a renal or perirenal abscess; an ovarian stump with a remnant of unresorbed suture; or an abscess or pyogranuloma in the root of the mesentery. Mixed bacterial flora are usually isolated, and if Actinomyces spp. are present, there may be sulfur granules surrounded by granulomatous inflammation.Nonneoplastic retroperitoneal masses include hematomas or accumulations of urine, following trauma to the caudal abdominal or pelvic area. Hemorrhage may dissect widely in this area, and the origin may be difficult to detect. Rupture of retroperitoneal hematomas may be fatal. Retroperitoneal hemorrhage in newborn calves is often an indication of fracture of the spinal column caused by inappropriate rotation during assisted calving. Sublumbar hemorrhage is frequent in male lambs castrated by traction of the testis. Renal and perirenal cysts, and pseudocysts or capsular cysts, also may be encountered, and are usually incidental.Neoplasms of the retroperitoneal space include lipomas, fibrosarcomas, lymphosarcomas, osteosarcomas, and nonchromaffin paragangliomas, as well as primary renal (or other) carcinomas and adrenal tumors.Metastatic tumors to the region include those commonly involving the sublumbar lymph nodes, such as lymphosarcoma, transitional cell, prostatic, colonic, perianal gland, and anal gland malignancies. Metastatic involvement of the sublumbar lymph nodes may stimulate periosteal reaction on the ventral aspect of adjacent vertebral bodies. Occasionally, tumors metastatic to the region lyse vertebral bodies or transverse processes, and they may occasionally invade the spinal canal. Lytic and osteophytic reactions must be distinguished from the effects of osteomyelitis.",
