The day begins at 7:00 AM with a layer of mosquito repellent and boiled coffee in a tin cup. Our medical clinic in the small village of Rancho Pedro along the Dominican Republic-Haiti border is a small hut composed of dilapidated wooden planks fastened together under a thatched reed roof. Patients with a variety of ailments line up daily outside the clinic door in anticipation of seeing a physician, often for the first time. Most patients have been waiting for hours, usually after enduring an overnight mountainous trek from a neighboring Haitian or Dominican village. Many of the medical problems encountered can be treated effectively with simple measures of wound debridement, bandages, analgesics, or antibiotics; however, some are more complex with no referral options. The work is intense but inspiring, rewarding but often frustrating as the limitations of our abilities quickly become apparent.",

We work under the pretense of promoting community autonomy and health sustainability in rural communities without access to healthcare, but can any positive difference in community health through the efforts of our volunteer medical teams be noticed? For the local rural communities that we temporarily serve, have any of our interventions subsequently reduced the burden of illness or death? Has individual or communal quality of life been enhanced? Have the social, economic, and educational boundaries been addressed to realistically implement some sustained beneficial impact? After our team leaves Rancho Pedro, is the community really better off, or do they simply wait for the next foreign medical team to arrive?",

For any project, one must first determine whether direct patient care is even warranted or whether the focus is better placed on alternative measures in public and preventative health (eg, vaccinations). Volunteers providing healthcare may not always be trained or licensed health providers. 7 In the absence of appropriate supervision, visiting medical students and residents may quickly over-reach their clinical abilities and may not fully understand select diseases or managerial approaches appropriate for a select region. 8 Even experienced physicians without adequate preparation may quickly find themselves without the optimal procedural skills or appropriate knowledge base to provide quality service. 8, 9 Different languages, local customs, and religious beliefs can pose barriers to well-intentioned healthcare delivery and community acceptance of public health measures. Intermittent international healthcare volunteerism by itself does not confer a sustainable community healthcare benefit. Without the participation and engagement of local health providers, there is a significant risk of fulfilling the self-interests of the volunteer team rather than the inherent needs of the local providers and communities. Quality patient care, education, and research depend on an integrated understanding of the medical needs identified and expressed by local providers and community leaders.

A well-structured program focuses not only on the well-being of the patients and community but also on the volunteer medical providers, residents, and students themselves. Table 3 lists a number of pre-travel considerations that participants should address. This preparation begins by ensuring that each member of a medical volunteer team has a formal pre-travel assessment (eg, through a local travel clinic). Such services include appropriate pre-travel and routine vaccinations, anti-malaria prophylaxis, precautions against mosquitos and other vectors of infection, and information on food handling, sun exposure, prevalent local diseases, and how to register with the US embassy in a foreign country. It is important to ensure before travel that incountry lodging and transportation and food, water, and other logistics for the team have been established. Personal safety and team security should be addressed and appropriate measures taken to ensure a positive experience. Many local laws and customs of a country may be different than those in the United States. Such differences should be discussed with the team and compliance ensured. Depending on the types of service planned, select personal protective equipment (including gloves, hand sanitizers, and face masks) may need to be acquired. An important but often overlooked item is outlining a reliable \"exit strategy\" in case of medical emergency or sudden development of local political instability.",

The sustainability of any such efforts, however, must remain the primary focus. Despite the popularity of medical care volunteerism, focusing on vaccinations, provisions for clean water, and improvements in community hygiene may actually have a larger, more profound, and enduring impact. Such public health projects should be considerations for any undeserved healthcare initiative. Direct patient care by volunteers may still have a worthy role, but only in the appropriate context. If conducted with the emphasis placed on the needs and values of the local communities and a focus to assist and support the local health providers, the work of volunteer teams can be mutually beneficial. 18 The education of local health providers (\"train the trainer\") is a key element to ensure a lasting benefit. Enhancing autonomy through training local providers and expanding medication and equipment supply chains will require time and patience. The establishment of open, trusting, and long-term relationships with the community and its local providers is essential to ensure the appropriateness of underserved health activities and optimize outcomes. 17, 19 Within the United States, the practice of medicine evokes many kinds of stress, including meeting clinical productivity targets, obtaining Medicare reimbursements, minimizing liability risk, and maintaining comprehensive documentation. Participation in underserved health activities can remind us of why we cherish our profession and reaffirm the core values of why we entered the healthcare profession. Both domestically and abroad, there are communities in dire need of medical services. Our efforts to meet those needs, however, should be coupled with strategies focused on sustainable and long-term health infrastructure development. By following the rules of engagement, we have a wonderful opportunity to make a positive and meaningful difference.",
