N protein binds to the RNA genome, forming a helical nucleocapsid (Escors et al., 2001; Sturman et al., 1980) . N protein has a structural role in coronavirus assembly (Risco et al., 1996) and is a growing evidence for a role in RNA synthesis (Almazan et al., 2004; Baric et al., 1988; Stohlman et al., 1988) . Some reports have been Transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus (TGEV) is an enteropathogenic coronavirus that causes diarrhea in pigs, which is correlated with high morbidity and mortality in suckling piglets. Using the method of GST pull-down with the nucleocapsid (N), N protein was found to interact with swine testes (ST) cells elongation factor 1-alpha (EF1A), an essential component of the translational machinery with an important role in cells. In vitro and in virus-infected cells interaction was then confirmed by co-precipitation. Knockdown of EF1A impairs N protein proliferation and TGEV replication in host cell. It was demonstrated that EF1A plays a role in TGEV replication. The present study thus provides a protein-related information that should be useful for underlying mechanism of coronavirus replication.",

Elongation factor 1-alpha (EF1A) is a major translation factor involved in protein synthesis in mammalian cells. EF1A is an abundant G protein that delivers aminoacyl-tRNA to the elongating ribosome (Carvalho et al., 1984b) . EF1A hydrolyzes GTP, dissociates from the aminoacyl-tRNA, and leaves the ribosome (Moldave, 1985) . Except a major translation factor, EF1A plays important multifunctional roles in mammalian cells. EF1A Interacts with newly synthesized polypeptides for quality surveillance (Hotokezaka et al., 2002) . In ubiquitin-dependent degradation, EF1A interacted with ubiquitinated proteins and is essential for ubiquitin-dependent degradation (Chuang et al., 2005; Gonen et al., 1994) . EF1A undergoes several post-translational modifications, mainly phosphorylation and methylation, and plays important role in facilitating apoptosis (Lamberti et al., 2004) .",

EF1 complex is composed of four different subunits, alpha, beta, gamma, and delta (2:1:1:1) in mammalian cells (Carvalho et al., 1984a) . In TGEV infected cells, EF1A may interact with N protein of TGEV that bind to TGEV RNA in a similar manner. Instead of an enzymatic activity, EF1A may provide protein-RNA and protein-protein interactions that promote the assembly of TGEV replication complexes. In this study, the results demonstrate that EF1A can interact with N protein of TGEV. It is possible that EF1A is involved in targeting TGEV N onto intracellular membranes that provide a microenvironment for the efficient replication of the viral RNA. From  Fig. 3 , we can see that the attenuated strain of TGEV N protein appears to be pulled down much more with EF1A than the wild type N protein in. The reason maybe that attenuated TGEV virus was better to adapt ST cells than infectious TGEV (data not shown). We assumed that the interaction of EF1A and N protein maybe play a role in cell culture adaptation.",

In host cells, EF1A is found in high concentrations, approximately 1% of the total protein in animal cells (Condeelis, 1995) and 5% in plant cells (Browning et al., 1990) . For viral replication, the abundance of EF1A would make it unnecessary to compete with cellular processes. CoVs replicate in many hosts (Enjuanes et al., 2006) . It is likely that host factors selected for virus replication would be both structurally and functionally conserved across different species. EF1A affords an excellent model system for the further analysis of host protein and virus interactions.",

The NS5A protein of bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) interacts with EF1A, which may play a role in the replication of BVDV (Johnson et al., 2001) . The nucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV interacted with EF1A and inhibited cell proliferation (Zhou et al., 2008) . The RNA-dependent RNA polymerase of Turnip mosaic virus (TuMv) interacts with EF1A in virus-induced vesicles (Thivierge et al., 2008) . RNA polymerase of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) specifically associates with EF1A (Das et al., 1998) . Gag polyprotein of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) interacts with EF1A requires tRNA, and EF1A may contribute to tRNA incorporation into HIV-1 virions (Cimarelli and Luban, 1999) . Studying the mechanism of EF1A and N protein of TGEV will help to understand the pathogenesis of CoVs.",
