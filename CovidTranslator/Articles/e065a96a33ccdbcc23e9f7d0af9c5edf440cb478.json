To address speculations that the virus originated in domesticated animals, or that domestic species were susceptible to the virus, we inoculated 6week-old pigs and chickens intravenously, intranasally, ocularly, and orally with 106 PFU of SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV). Clinical signs did not develop in any animal, nor were gross pathologic changes evident on postmortem examinations. Attempts at virus isolation were unsuccessful; however, viral RNA was detected by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction in blood of both species during the first week after inoculation, and in chicken organs at 2 weeks after inoculation. Virus-neutralizing antibodies developed in the pigs. Our results indicate that these animals do not play a role as amplifying hosts for SARS-CoV.",

According to the World Health Organization, SARS affected more than 8,200 people worldwide and killed more than 700. The sequence analysis of SARS-CoV suggests that it is substantially distinct from all other known coronaviruses (1, 2) . Based on the nucleotide sequence, the virus is speculated to have evolved and been maintained in an animal host. However, no conclusive data have been presented to date on a possible reservoir for this virus. Our study aimed to address the role of domestic animals in the outbreak, both from the public health perspective (as a potential source of virus for human infections) and the animal health perspective. A potential susceptibility of domestic species to SARS-CoV would have major implications on the management of livestock operations worldwide.",

Animal housing and all animal manipulations were approved by the Animal Care Committee of the Canadian Science Centre for Human and Animal Health and met the Canadian Council on Animal Care guidelines. For the preparation of primary chicken embryo kidney epithelial cells (CEKEC), kidneys were harvested from 18day-old chicken embryos and digested with 3 U of pronase (Sigma)/mL in citrate buffer (1.5 mM KCl, 27 mM sodium citrate, 8 mM KH 2 PO 4 , 5.6 mM Na 2 HPO 4 , pH 7.3) by repeated incubation for 2 min at 37\u00b0C with stirring.

The suspension was centrifuged at 2000 x g, 4\u00b0C, 20 min. The supernatant was diluted 10-fold in the corresponding media for the individual cell types, and 400 \u00b5L (in duplicates) was incubated on cells for 1 h at 37\u00b0C, 5% CO 2 . The inoculum was then removed and replaced with the appropriate media, supplemented with 5% FBS (Vero and PT-K75 cells) or 1% FBS (CEEKC). Plates were incubated for 5 days at 37\u00b0C, 5% CO 2 . Isolation from blood and swabs was performed as for tissues without the homogenization step. The sensitivity of virus isolation was determined by spiking negative control lung tissues from one chicken and one pig with virus inoculum before homogenization, titrating out the samples on Vero E6 and Vero V76 cells, and comparing the titers to the inoculum titer, using plaque assay described in the virus section. The Qiagen OneStep RT-PCR kit was also used for the two-step RT-PCR with the following modifications: the template was incubated at 50\u00b0C for 30 min only with forward N primer followed by the incubation at 95\u00b0C for 15 min to inactivate the reverse transcriptase. Residual singlestrand RNA template was removed by digestion at 37\u00b0C for 20 min with 2 U of Rnase H (Invitrogen, Burlington, ON). After both forward and reverse N primers and the Platinum Pfx DNA polymerase (Invitrogen) were added, the DNA synthesis was completed by using the above conditions for the N primers in a one-step RT-PCR. Randomly selected amplicons were sequenced with the respective primers to verify the identity of the bands. Sensitivity of the individual primer sets used in the RT-PCR assays was tested by spiking negative control lung tissues from chicken and pig with virus inoculum before homogenization, titrating out the homogenate, and running the RT-PCRs in parallel on the same RNA extracts.",

Due to the presence of 3\u2032-coterminal nested mRNAs and genomic RNA (6,7) during coronavirus replication, nucleocapsid RT-PCR was expected to be more sensitive in samples containing replicating virus. The originally used NML primers were less sensitive than the other two sets of primers (BNI pol and N), and the samples were retested with these two sets of primers. Sensitivity of the RT-PCR employing the individual primer sets is illustrated in Table  1 , as determined by using negative control lung tissues spiked with SARS-CoV. RT-PCR with the N and the BNI primers detected viral RNA equivalent to approximately 10 -3/-4 PFU.

Clearance of low or nonreplicating intravenous inoculum from blood, including the viral RNA, occurs rapidly in a number of viruses (8, 9) . In light of the typical clearance rates and the estimated initial virus load Neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV developed in the pigs within 2 weeks of inoculation. These antibodies did not cross-react with TGEV/PRCV in a TGEV neutralization assay (PRCV and TGEV are indistinguishable in the virus neutralization assays) (10) . Likewise, the preinoculation serum samples with the highest TGEV-neutralizing antibodies did not neutralize SARS-CoV, and the neutralizing antibodies against TGEV decreased as the SARS antibody titers increased. Based on the serum neutralization tests, TGEV/PRCV and SARS-CoV do not appear to be antigenically closely related, an observation supported by the initial genomic analysis (1, 2) . The crossneutralization with TGEV/PRCV was initially a concern after the publication of immunohistochemical assays on SARS-CoV-infected cells (11) . Since virus-neutralizing antibodies often take approximately 3 weeks to develop in chickens, no conclusions were made with regard to the low or absent antibody titers in their sera at 2 weeks after inoculation. In conclusion, the limited extent of virus replication as indicated by RT-PCR, the failure to isolate the virus, and the lack of virus shedding indicate that neither pigs nor chickens are likely to play a role as an amplifying host.

Three sets of primers were used in a one-step RT-PCR assay employing the Qiagen OneStep RT-PCR kit (Qiagen, Mississauga, ON): 1. NML polymerase primers: forward primer CAG AGC CAT GCC TAA CATG and reverse primer AAT GTT TAC GCA GGT AAG CG were used in the RT-PCR reaction (50\u00b0C for 30 min, 95\u00b0C for 15 min, followed by 50 cycles of 94\u00b0C for 15 s, 50\u00b0C for 30 s, 72\u00b0C for 30 s with 7-min extension at 72\u00b0C). The 389-nt amplicon is located within the RNAdependent RNA polymerase gene (ORF 1b). 2. Nucleocapsid (N) primers: forward primer ATA ATA CTG CGT CTT GGT TC and reverse primer TGG CAA TGT TGT TCC TTG AG were used under the same reaction conditions as the first set of primers, yielding a 364-base pair (bp) long amplicon. 3. BNI polymerase primers and RT-PCR conditions were developed at the Bernhard-Nocht Institute for Tropical Medicine, Hamburg, Germany, by C. Drosten, and published on their Web site on March 26, 2003: BNI OUT S2: ATG AAT TAC CAA GTC AAT GGT TAC (forward); BNI OUTAS: CAT AAC CAG TCG GTA CAG CTA C (reverse). The RT-PCR conditions were: 30 min at 50\u00b0C, 15 min at 95\u00b0C, followed by 50 cycles of 95\u00b0C for 10 s, 56\u00b0C for 10 s, 72\u00b0C for 20 s, and completed at 72\u00b0C for 7 min, yielding an amplicon of 195 bp.",

Our data suggest that pigs and chickens of the age used in the experiment were infected with SARS-CoV and, to a very limited degree, supported virus replication. The unsuccessful attempts at virus isolation could be explained by a very low rate of virus replication perhaps combined with loss of infectivity during the sample collection and processing. Although the observed decrease in virus recovery (virus spiked control samples) is not significant, it may have played a role in case of the low virus load. The intravenous route likely does not represent the route of infection in a field situation, and the question of possible natural infection of chickens and pigs with SARS-CoV remains open.",
