In order to improve efficiency and flexibility of concept learning, in this paper we discuss concept learning via granular computing from the point of view of cognitive computing. More precisely, cognitive mechanism of forming concepts is analyzed based on the principles from philosophy and cognitive psychology, including how to model concept-forming cognitive operators, define cognitive concepts and establish cognitive concept structure. Granular computing is then combined with the cognitive concept structure to improve efficiency of concept learning. Furthermore, we put forward a cognitive computing system which is the initial environment to learn composite concepts and can integrate past experiences into itself for enhancing flexibility of concept learning. Also, we investigate cognitive processes whose aims are to deal with the problem of learning one exact or two approximate cognitive concepts from a given object set, attribute set or pair of object and attribute sets.",

Up to now, for meeting the requirements of data analysis and knowledge manipulation, all kinds of concepts which carry certain meanings have been proposed such as abstract concepts [37] , Wille's concepts [42] , object-oriented concepts [48, 49] and property-oriented concepts [9] . http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ins.2014.12.010 0020-0255/\u00d3 2014 Elsevier Inc.

The extent of a concept is the set of all objects or instances that the concept denotes, and the intent of a concept is the set of attributes or properties that a concept connotes [37, 42] . In order to reflect the relationship of specialization and generalization among concepts, a structure of concepts can further be built by defining a partial order on the concepts under consideration. By this means, the obtained concept structure often forms a complete lattice no matter what kinds of meanings we give to the concepts, and hence some scholars from the community of formal concept analysis [42] called it certain concept lattice instead. For example, different concept structures have been proposed by specifying certain meanings of the concepts in the real world such as Wille's concept lattice [42] , object-oriented concept lattice [48, 49] , property-oriented concept lattice [9] , AFS-concept lattice [40] , power concept lattice [11] and others [6, 15, 16, 20, 21] . Note that these certain concept structures or lattices establish rigorous mathematical models and provide formal semantics for data analysis in practice. In other words, meanings of real-world concrete entities can be represented and semantics of abstract subjects can be embodied by these certain concept structures. All in all, learning concepts (sometimes including their corresponding structure) has been investigated from various aspects. However, the current paper focuses on this issue from a novel aspect (i.e., a cognitive viewpoint).",

            "text": "Note that, generally speaking, learning a certain concept structure from a given dataset is computationally expensive when its size is large. The reason is that the number of concepts in the structure will increase exponentially in the worst case. Considering that granular computing gives rise to processing that is less time demanding than the one required when dealing with detailed numeric processing [2] [3] [4] . Information granule, the basic notion in the theory of granular computing which can broadly be viewed as a collection of information granules and the area of intelligent computing revolving around them [26] , was introduced into Wille's concept lattice as an attempt to decrease computation time [43] . In a general sense, by information granule, one regards a collection of elements drawn together by their closeness (resemblance, proximity, functionality, etc.) articulated in terms of some useful spatial, temporal, or functional relationships [52, 53] . In fact, information granules are intuitively appealing constructs, which play a pivotal role in human cognitive and decision-making activities [24] . It is also worth stressing that information granules permeate almost all human endeavors [2] [3] [4] [5] 24, 25, 27, 53, 54] . For example, information granules have been studied in rough set theory [17, 23, 29, 30, 35, 44, 46, 47] extensively which is considered as one of the approaches of granular computing, and applied in formal concept analysis [10] , evidence analysis [33] , etc. Recently, studies on combination of granular computing with formal concept analysis have been made by several researchers [7, 12, 19, 31, 41, 43, 45, 56] . And what is particularly worth mentioning is that information granules in formal concept analysis mean granular concepts [43] which are the basic concepts used to deduce others. As a matter of fact, in order to improve efficiency sharply, learning concept structure indeed needs the idea of granular computing no matter how we specify the certain meanings of the concepts in the real world, no exception to cognitive concepts to be discussed in the current paper.",

In the meanwhile, axiomatic methods are also needed in terms of learning methodologies in which concepts are learned by establishing axiomatic systems (i.e., sets of axioms). To the best of our knowledge, axiomatic systems of concept learning were often called concept systems instead. In recent years, there have been several concept systems proposed for certain concept learning such as cognitive system [45] , concept granular computing system [31] , generalized concept system [19] and generalized dual concept system [18] . At the same time, it should be pointed out that these concept systems can also be used to learn the certain concepts which were obtained by using the constructive methods in [9, 11, 16, 40, 42, 48, 49] . Compared with constructive methods, axiomatic methods try to look beyond appearance for the essence of concept learning. However, the existing concept systems cannot integrate past experiences into itself. In other words, they are not able to deal with e.g., dynamic data and thereby are lack of flexibility for data analysis in practice. Besides, no explanation was provided to the background of the axioms of the existing concept systems, which means that they are too abstract to be understood. But, as far as we know, it is possible to solve these problems to some extent by means of concept learning based on cognitive computing because this kind of computing approach has the characteristic of integrating past experiences into itself and the background of simulating intelligence behaviors of the brain including perception, attention and learning.",

Our current study mainly focuses on this issue. More precisely, the problems to be discussed are analysis of cognitive mechanism of forming concepts, integration of granular computing into cognitive concept structure, establishment of cognitive computing system, and implementation of cognitive processes. Note that the proposed cognitive computing system not only can integrate past experiences into itself by recursive thinking, but also is easy to be understood because cognitive mechanism of forming concepts is analyzed in advance based on the principles from philosophy and cognitive psychology.",

In Section 2, cognitive mechanism of forming concepts is analyzed based on the principles from philosophy and cognitive psychology, including how to define concept-forming cognitive operators, construct cognitive concepts and induce their hierarchical structure. In Section 3, granular computing is integrated into the induced cognitive concept structure. In Section 4, we put forward a cognitive computing system in which the notions of a cognitive computing state, an object-oriented cognitive computing state and an attribute-oriented cognitive computing state are proposed. In Section 5, we investigate the cognitive processes whose aims are to deal with the problem of learning one exact or two approximate cognitive concepts from a given object set, attribute set or pair of object and attribute sets. In Section 6, we discuss the main differences and relations between the proposed concept learning approach and the existing ones, and give explanations on some obtained results in our study. The paper is then concluded with a brief summary and an outlook for further research.",

However, in practice, it may be hard to implement such an action since the exhaustion of all elements of L and H is difficult when the cardinalities of U and A are large, let alone finding all cognitive concepts. For instance, in Example 1, the total number of X i # L\u00f0X i \u00de (X i # U) in L and B j # H\u00f0B j \u00de (B j # A) in H is 2 jUj \u00fe 2 jAj , which is exponential with respect to the cardinalities jUj and jAj.

Similarly, it is also necessary to learn additional cognitive concept(s) when new information is given to an attribute set or a pair of object and attribute sets. In this section, using set approximations, we discuss cognitive processes to learn one exact or two approximate cognitive concepts from a given object set, attribute set or pair of object and attribute sets based on the granular concepts G LnHn of a cognitive computing system. Before embarking on this issue, we introduce some basic notions related to rough set theory (e.g., lower and upper approximations, rough set, etc) in order to explicitly show where the idea of our set approximations comes from.",

The existing work put forward cognitive computing systems (e.g., [18, 19, 31, 45] ) by means of different axiomatic ways, which cannot integrate past experiences into itself to deal with e.g., dynamic data. However, the current study has proposed such a cognitive computing system that is composed of a series of cognitive computing states and is able to integrate past experiences into itself through recursive thinking. In addition, granular computing has also been integrated into the proposed cognitive computing system to decrease the computation time sharply. The existing researches on cognitive process mainly investigated the problem of learning concept(s) from a given pair of object and attribute sets by means of iterative algorithms [31, 45] , regardless of discussing whether the pair of object and attribute sets is concept-inducible or not, let alone the learning accuracy. However, the current paper has put forward the notion of a concept-inducible pair of object and attribute sets and a simple way of learning concept(s) from the concept-inducible pair via set approximations.

For example, the importance of applying cognitive viewpoint to concept learning was mentioned in [45] . Learning concept(s) from a given pair of object and attribute sets by iterative algorithm was considered as a natural reflection of cognition. Motivated by these work, in this paper we have explicitly applied the idea of cognitive computing to concept learning based on granular computing, including a detailed discussion of cognitive mechanism, cognitive computing system and cognitive process. Both the proposed method and the existing ones allow users to specify the operators in the cognitive computing system. In other words, users can remould the operators according to their certain requirements of data analysis before learning concepts through the cognitive computing system.",

Some basic propositions (e.g., Propositions 1-4) of the proposed cognitive operators L and H are similar to those obtained by Zhang Wenxiu's research group [18, 19, 31] in formal concept analysis since L and H here form Galois connection as well. However, the difference is that the proposed cognitive operators are characterized by the axioms in Definition 1 which are from the principles in philosophy and cognitive psychology. Since the time complexities of Algorithms 1-4 are O\u00f0n\u00f0jU n j \u00fe jA n j\u00dejU n jjA n j\u00de; O\u00f0jU n j 2 \u00fe jU n jjA n j \u00fe jA n j 2 \u00de, O\u00f0jU n j 2 \u00fe jU n jjA n j \u00fe jA n j 2 \u00de and O\u00f0jU n j 2 \u00fe jU n jjA n j \u00fe jA n j 2 \u00de, respectively, the proposed concept learning method can be completed in polynomial time. However, the classical algorithms in [10] take exponential time in the worst case for concept learning. So, granular computing integrated into cognitive concept lattice can indeed improve the efficiency of concept learning.",

To be more concrete, cognitive mechanism of forming concepts has been analyzed based on the principles from philosophy and cognitive psychology. Then granular computing has been combined with the cognitive concept lattice to improve the efficiency of concept learning. What is more, we have put forward a cognitive computing system which is the initial environment to learn composite concepts and can integrate past experiences into itself for enhancing the flexibility of concept learning. In addition, cognitive processes have also been investigated to deal with the problem of learning one exact or two approximate cognitive concepts from a given object set, attribute set or pair of object and attribute sets. The obtained results in this paper may be beneficial to simulating intelligence behaviors of the brain including perception, attention and learning, but it still needs to be further confirmed.",
