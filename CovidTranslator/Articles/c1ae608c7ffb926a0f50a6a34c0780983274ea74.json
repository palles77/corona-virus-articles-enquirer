The incubation period of H7N9 (Human Avian Influenza A) is about 6.5 days, but the incubation period for SARS-CoV is typically 2 to 7 days [5] [6] .

We further employ the maximum likelihood estimates (MLEs) for the parameters of the gamma, conduct the goodness-fit test, and obtain p-value=8.6807e-04.

It indicates that the younger group tends to have a shorter incubation period. The variance of their incubation period also seems to be smaller. The Mann-Whitney rank test shows that there's a statistically significant difference between the incubation of age<40 and age>=40 groups with the null hypothesis: the medians of incubation period between two groups are the same. The p-values for corresponding alternative hypotheses: the age<40 group has a smaller incubation median is 0.00474. It suggests that the age<40 group has a shorter incubation period than the age>=40 group. Similarly, the Siegal-Tukey test indicates the younger group's incubation variance is less than the older group's by p-value: 0.0083. It may suggest COVID-19 has a faster but relatively constant spread speed among people <40 years old than people >=40 years old. Figure 4 illustrates biplots of the dataset by removing two cases with missing items by using PCA (principal component analysis), sparse PCA (sparse principal component analysis, t-SNE (t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding), and LLE (locally linear embedding) [16] [17] [18] [19] . Data is partitioned as the age>=40 and age<40 groups in visualization. t-SNE shows that only one case in the age>=40 group falls in the cluster of the age < 40 group. But PCA, sparse PCA and LLE all show that the incubation of two groups is linearly separable, which means there exists an obvious linear boundary to separate them, in the subspaces generated by PCA, SPCA, t-SNE, or LLE. Such machine learning results indicate that the two groups are actually independent clusters spatially. However, we also find that the incubation data will no longer demonstrate the linear separability property when we partition it as age>=50 and age<50 groups or age>=55 All rights reserved.
