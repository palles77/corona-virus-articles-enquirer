Methods: This was a cross-sectional study. Clinical, epidemiological, and laboratory data of patients hospitalized with acute respiratory syndrome in a tertiary care hospital from 2012 to 2013 were reviewed. Results: HRV was the most common CRV observed (36%, 162/444) and was present in the majority of viral co-detections (69%, 88/128), mainly in association with human enterovirus (45%). Most HRV-infected patients were younger than 2 years (57%). Overall, patients infected with HRV had a lower frequency of severe acute respiratory infection than those infected with other CRVs (60% and 84%, respectively, p = 0.006), but had more comorbidities (40% and 27%, respectively; p = 0.043). However, in the adjusted analysis this association was not significant. The mortality rate within the HRV group was 3%. Detection of HRV was more prevalent during autumn and winter, with a moderately negative correlation between viral infection frequency and temperature (r = \u22120.636, p < 0.001) but no correlation with rainfall (r = \u22120.036, p = 0.866). \u0b1d Please cite this article as: Leotte J, Trombetta H, Faggion HZ, Almeida BM, Nogueira MB, Vidal LR, et al.

            "text": "Human rhinoviruses (HRVs) belong to Picornaviridae family, genus Enterovirus, and are divided in three species (HRV-A, HRV-B, and HRV-C) with about 100 serotypes within these species. 1, 2 The development of highly-sensitive molecular techniques for characterization of the HRV genome has recently allowed recognition of the HRV-C species. 3 There is already evidence that this new species may be more virulent and more strongly associated with lower respiratory tract infections than HRV-A and HRV-B. 4 HRV is the most common cause of upper respiratory tract infections, being responsible for at least 50% of cases of the common cold. This leads to considerable economic burden in terms of medical visits and both school and work absenteeism. 2, 4 HRVs have also been linked to lower airway effects that result in significant morbidity and mortality, 1 such as exacerbations of chronic pulmonary disease, severe bronchiolitis in infants and children, as well as fatal pneumonia in elderly and immunocompromised adults. 4, 5 In general, HRV infections occur during spring and autumn, 6 and manifest differently depending on whether the lower or upper respiratory tract is infected. Infections of the upper respiratory tract ordinarily include symptoms of the common cold, but can present as acute otitis media or rhinosinusitis. On the other hand, infections of the lower respiratory tract can cause severe symptoms and result in bronchiolitis and pneumonia. 4 In Brazil, since the influenza A pandemic of 2009, referral hospitals have been conducting active surveillance to detect respiratory viruses. Such surveillance includes notification and laboratory investigation of cases meeting the diagnostic criteria of severe acute respiratory infection (SARI). This viral respiratory infection monitoring has resulted in important information about the circulation of other community-acquired respiratory viruses (CRV). The present study reports the epidemiological features, clinical characteristics, and outcomes of HRV infections in comparison with other CRV infections in patients hospitalized in a referral hospital in Southern Brazil, for two consecutive years.",

Respiratory samples (nasal swab or nasopharyngeal aspirate, or bronchoalveolar lavage) were collected in different periods of hospitalization according to medical recommendation. Individuals with more than one sample collected during the same symptomatic period were considered as a single case and only the first result was evaluated, so that the number of respiratory viral detections was not overestimated. The medical records and influenza notification forms of patients with detectable respiratory virus were reviewed, focusing on epidemiology, clinical manifestation, outcome, laboratory findings, and diagnosis of SARI. SARI was defined as a flu-like syndrome with signs of severity (dyspnea or oxygen saturation below 95%).",

Although this study included all age groups, a predominance of pediatric patients infected with HRV was observed, mostly younger than 1 year old. In addition, the HRV-positive group had a greater proportion of patients with pre-existing comorbidities than the group with other identified CRVs. 6,7,11---14 Among the comorbidities observed in this study, chronic lung diseases were frequent in the HRV group, a correlation that has already been demonstrated in another similar study, 14 which corroborates the close association of HRV infection and exacerbations of chronic lung diseases, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma, and cystic fibrosis. 4 Of 444 samples positive for CRVs, 128 samples (29%) had at least two co-detected viruses, in keeping with the expected 10---31% encountered in hospitalized individuals. 7, 8, 15 The viruses most frequently co-detected with HRV were EV (45%), RSV (33%), and AdV (18%); consistent with previously reported patterns. 14, 15 However, the high frequency of EV and HRV co-detection may be as a result of using the 5 NRT region of the viral genome to identify both pathogens, which may have lowered the specificity of the RT-PCR test. 16 A more appropriate means to discern between these species would be to carry out the RT-PCR followed by nucleotide sequencing of amplicons. 17 The high level of dual infection involving HRV and RSV is often explained both by the coexistence of these viruses throughout the year and their similar seasonal variation, 15 but this hypothesis is not unanimous. 12 In contrast to findings reported by Goka et al., 15 this study did not show an association between disease severity and viral co-detections. Furthermore, HRV was not found to have a protective influence in cases where it was involved in codetection, as there was no significant difference in disease severity when comparing the groups with or without HRV co-detection. Likewise, in contradiction to the present findings, Asner et al. 18 observed an increased disease severity in children infected with HRV alone. Among the probable factors associated with these contrasting findings, the following may be cited: (i) analysis in different groups of patients (outpatient and hospitalized), (ii) assessing a small number of patients, and (iii) adoption of different severity criteria.",

However, this is the first report about HRV infections in the region and a critical analysis of the data is important to obtain greater awareness of the dynamics of dispersion and impact of these respiratory viruses in the community.",

However, a dependent relationship between the presence of HRV in viral co-detections and severity of disease was not observed in this study. Conflicts in the literature demand a closer analysis of cases of co-detection involving HRV with review of the data to determine the impact of this, since the lack of standardization between studies probably contributes to the divergent data. HRV infection is closely associated with comorbidities, mainly chronic lung diseases, and is an important factor in exacerbations of these underlying lung diseases. The colder seasons were the period with higher frequency of HRV infections in Southern Brazil, and therefore must be a period to warn clinicians about young age children affected by respiratory infections, especially those with comorbidities such as chronic lung disease. Patients with this profile should have respiratory samples collected to identify possible viral infection, and if HRV is detected, the medical staff should be ready for adequate management, taking into consideration the possible poor outcomes.",
