            "text": "The cellular responses to infection are many, and include programmed cell death to inhibit microbial dissemination and the production and secretion of interferons (IFNs), which confer resistance to uninfected cells. In addition to the antimicrobial effects of IFNs, these cytokines have been used clinically for the treatment of various neoplasias to inhibit proliferation and stimulate apoptosis. However, the precise mechanisms of action of IFNs remain to be completely understood. One of the primary response genes induced after an infection or treatment with type I or III IFN is known as IFN-stimulated gene 54 (ISG54) or IFN-induced gene with tetratricopeptide repeats 2 (IFIT2). ISG54/IFIT2 is a member of a family of IFN-induced genes related in the sequence and structure. Expression of this protein has been found to promote cellular apoptosis by a mitochondrial pathway dependent on the action of Bcl2 proteins. ISG54/IFIT2 does not function as a monomer, and it forms complexes with itself and with the related ISG56/IFIT1 and ISG60/IFIT3 proteins to elicit complex cellular responses. The apoptotic response to ISG54/IFIT2 may contribute to other functions that have been reported, including translational regulation, inhibition of tumor colonization, and protection against a lethal viral infection.",

            "text": "T he biological effects of interferons (IFNs) are complex, and reflect the impact of these cytokines on hundreds of cellular genes (de Veer and others 2001; Gomez and Reich 2003; Borden and others 2007) . Initially discovered for their ability to inhibit viral replication, they are known to influence activation, differentiation, proliferation, and survival of various cell types. They have been used clinically as antiviral agents, for the treatment of immune diseases such as multiple sclerosis, and for the inhibition of various neoplasias. IFNs bind to the receptors in the plasma membrane and initiate a signal transduction pathway that leads to transcriptional induction of nuclear genes. The concerted and balanced effects of the induced genes, commonly referred to as IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs), are responsible for the unique physiological responses to IFN. Only by understanding the actions of individual ISGs will the biological effects of IFNs be understood. The ISG54 gene codes for a protein of 54 kDa (472 a.a.) with 9 tetratricopeptide repeats (TPR) (Levy and others 1986; Wathelet and others 1986; Stawowczyk and others 2011; Yang and others 2012) . TPR motifs are proteinprotein interaction modules that are known to play a role in the formation of multiprotein complexes (Blatch and Lassle 1999; D'Andrea and Regan 2003) . For this reason, ISG54 has also been designated IFN-induced protein with tetratricopeptide repeat 2 (IFIT2). It is 1 of 4 related human ISGs (ISG54/IFIT2, ISG56/IFIT1, ISG58/IFIT5, and ISG60/IFIT3), and 3 murine ISGs (ISG54/IFIT2, ISG56/IFIT1, and ISG49/ IFIT3) (Fensterl and Sen 2011) . Human ISG54/IFIT2 will be the focus of this article, as it has the ability to promote cell death (Stawowczyk and others 2011) . The proapoptotic effects of ISG54/IFIT2 likely contribute to both antiviral and antiproliferative actions of IFN.",

            "text": "There are 3 families of IFN cytokines (type I, II, and III) that bind to 3 distinct cell surface receptors associated with Janus tyrosine kinases ( JAKs) (de Weerd and Nguyen 2012) . JAKs are activated after IFN binding and subsequently phosphorylate multiple signaling substrates; of particular significance are the signal transducers and activators of transcription (STATs) (Levy and Darnell 2002; Platanias 2005; Schindler and others 2007; Stark and Darnell 2012) . Tyrosine phosphorylation of the STATs promotes the reciprocal interaction of STAT monomers via their phosphotyrosine and SH2 domains to form dimers with the ability to recognize specific DNA target sites in the responsive genes. Type I IFNs (including aand bIFNs) and type III IFNs (lIFNs) stimulate the formation of STAT1 tyrosinephosphorylated dimers, and as well the unique multimeric transcription factor complex known as the IFN-stimulated gene factor 3 (ISGF3) (Fu and others 1990) . ISGF3 is composed of a tyrosine-phosphorylated STAT1 and tyrosine-phosphorylated STAT2 that is associated with the IFN regulatory factor 9 (IRF9) (Martinez-Moczygemba and others 1997; Ozato and others 2007) . ISGF3 binds specifically to an inducible enhancer sequence corresponding to a tandem repeat, designated as the IFN-stimulated response element (ISRE) (Levy and others 1988) . In contrast, the tyrosine-phosphorylated STAT1 dimer and other STAT dimers recognize a DNA sequence with an inverted repeat, the gIFN-activated site, originally described in the type II IFN (gIFN) pathway (Decker and others 1991) . The promoter of the ISG54/IFIT2 gene has an ISRE that binds ISGF3, and it is robustly induced in response to type I and III IFNs (Fig. 1) .",

ISG54 was tagged with monomeric green fluorescence protein (mGFP), and the effect of mGFP or ISG54-mGFP expression was evaluated in cell cultures by flow cytometry. There was a dramatic decrease with time in the cell population expressing ISG54-mGFP, indicating that ISG54 had a negative effect on cell viability. This was confirmed by measuring propidium iodide (PI) uptake with flow cytometry in cells expressing ISG54-mGFP. PI is a fluorescent molecule excluded from viable cells, but enters the cells with permeabilized membranes and subsequently intercalates nuclear DNA. The loss of viability in cells expressing ISG54 was evident by 48 h (Stawowczyk and others 2011) . To determine if cell death was mediated by apoptosis, cells were stained with allophycocyanin-annexin-V. Annexin-V binds to the phosphatidylserine groups that become exposed on the surface of apoptotic cells. Cells expressing ISG54-mGFP displayed a significant increase in annexin-V staining, indicating that cell death was mediated by apoptosis. Ectopic protein levels of ISG54-mGFP were comparatively similar to the levels of ISG54 in cells treated with IFN, indicating a physiologically relevant expression level of ISG54-mGFP. Transient expression of a tetracycline-inducible ISG54-mGFP elicited a similar apoptotic death response, and the response was demonstrated in various human transformed cell lines.",

Immunofluorescence studies with antibodies reactive to activated caspase-3, a primary executioner enzyme, showed a significant correlation with ISG54-mGFP expression (Stawowczyk and others 2011) . Pathways that lead to caspase activation have been described as extrinsic, triggered by ligands that bind cell surface death receptors, or intrinsic, triggered by intracellular events. ISG54 does not appear to stimulate the extrinsic pathway, since a dominant-negative Fas-associated protein with a death domain and a caspase-8 cell-permeable inhibitor do not block apoptosis in response to ISG54. Intrinsic apoptosis is triggered by a shift in the delicate balance of antiapoptotic and proapoptotic factors that regulate mitochondrial permeability (Adams and Cory 2007; Youle and Strasser 2008; Llambi and others 2011) . When mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP) occurs in response to apoptotic factors, cytochrome c is released and forms a complex with Apaf-1 and caspase-9 (apoptosome). The apoptosome subsequently activates the effector caspases, caspase-3 and caspase-7. MOMP is tightly controlled by the interactions between members of a family of B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl2) proteins that have either proapoptotic or antiapoptotic effects (Fig. 2) . The antiapoptotic proteins (Bcl2, Bclxl, Bclw, and Mcl-1) are associated with the outer membrane of mitochondria via their transmembrane domain. The activators of apoptosis (Bim, Bmf, Bid, Bik, Bad, Hrk, Noxa, and Puma) function when they are released from a sequestered cellular location, or cleaved from a larger protein, or are newly synthesized. They bind to the effectors of apoptosis (Bax, Bak, and less-studied Bok) to change their conformation. The conformational change promotes Bax, Bak effector binding to mitochondria, and MOMP. Current models indicate that the prosurvival Bcl2 proteins bind to and inhibit both the activators and effectors, but discerning the mechanisms that regulate their interactions and functions is an active field of study.",

In a converse approach, the response of cells that lack the proapoptotic Bax and Bak genes was evaluated. The bax -/ -; bak -/ -double-knockout cells are resistant to diverse stimuli that trigger mitochondrial apoptosis. These cells and corresponding wild-type cells were transfected with ISG54-mGFP. There was no increase in cell death in bax -/ -;bak -/ -cells even after 72 h of ISG54 expression, indicating that Bax and Bak are required for apoptosis in response to ISG54-mGFP.

Two independent cell lines were generated that knocked down endogenous ISG54 mRNA by introducing shRNA with a lentiviral expression system. Control shRNA cells and the ISG54 knockdown cell lines were compared for various parameters, including cell migration in vitro. An in vitro wound-healing assay was performed, in which a scrape was made in a confluent tissue culture monolayer with a pipette tip. The extent of cell migration to close the wound was measured after 24 h. The ISG54-knocked down cell lines showed a significantly increased migration that closed the wound. The enhanced migration of the knockdown cells was also apparent in the transwell invasion assays. These used a modified Boyden chamber assay in which cells were placed in a serum-free medium in the upper chamber separated from the medium with serum in the lower chamber by a membrane precoated with Matrigel. The knockdown of ISG54 correlated with increased migration. For this reason, the knockdown cells were evaluated for the markers associated with the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a process associated with migration and invasion in vivo. These studies indicated that the patterns of protein expression in the ISG54 knockdown cells were correlative with the EMT.",

In fact, the adenoviral E1B 19K protein, known to function as a viral homolog of Bcl2, and the KSHV (Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus) viral Bcl2 homolog can block apoptosis induced by ISG54 (Stawowczyk and others 2011) (M.

These mice had decreased survival after infection by 2\u00a2-O-methylation-deficient viruses, but not by WT virus.

For this reason, the gain of function by ectopic expression in the absence of other ISGs has also been used to evaluate the impact of individual proteins on viral replication.

Since a subset of PRRs are activated during viral infection by binding dsRNA or uncapped 5\u00a2triphosphorylated (5\u00a2ppp) RNA (TLR3, RIG-I, and MDA5), Pichlmair and others (2011) used affinity proteomics to search for proteins that bind 5\u00a2ppp RNA. They identified ISG56/IFIT1 and ISG58/IFIT5. Their subsequent studies indicated that ISG56/IFIT1 antagonized viral replication by physically sequestering viral 5\u00a2ppp RNA generated during infection. Another group provided evidence that the ISG54/ IFIT2 protein can bind AU-rich RNA (Yang and others 2012) . This work derived from the crystal structure of ISG54 that revealed an area of basic residues along an inner channel of its C-terminus. The positively charged region prompted investigations to evaluate the ability of ISG54 to bind nucleic acid. Following a series of in vitro binding assays, the preferential binding of ISG54 to AU-rich dsRNA and ssRNA was demonstrated. Studies by a different group indicated a negative impact of ISG54 expression on the stability of TNFa mRNA after gene induction by bacterial lipopolysaccharide (Berchtold and others 2008) . The effect was dependent on the 3\u00a2-untranslated region of the TNFa mRNA and a region, including a constitutive decay element, but it did not involve the AU-rich region.",

The majority of transcripts are noncoding RNAs that include long and short noncoding RNAs. For this reason, it is feasible that ISG54 binds and inhibits the function of one or more noncoding regulatory RNAs. A major class of short noncoding RNAs is micro-RNA (miRNA). miRNAs are complementary to their target mRNAs and decrease gene expression by translational inhibition and/or mRNA degradation, and more significantly, miRNAs have been shown to function as either oncogenes or tumor suppressors (Iorio and Croce 2012; Lujambio and Lowe 2012) .

ISG54 expression promotes apoptosis via a mitochondrial pathway, and overexpression of antiapoptotic Bcl2 proteins or antiapoptotic viral proteins can block that apoptosis. In light of the ability of ISG54 to promote apoptosis, it remains to be determined how this response contributes to the reported effects of ISG54 on tumor colonization and antiviral responses (Fig. 4) . The antiviral and anticancer effects of IFNs result from a concerted function of many ISGs, and ISG54 is one of the factors responsible for IFN-stimulated cell death.
