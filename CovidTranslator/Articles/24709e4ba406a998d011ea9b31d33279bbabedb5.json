        {
            "text": "It remains largely mysterious how the genomes of non-enveloped eukaryotic viruses are transferred across a membrane into the host cell. Picornaviruses are simple models for such viruses, and initiate this uncoating process through particle expansion, which reveals channels through which internal capsid proteins and the viral genome presumably exit the particle, although this has not been clearly seen until now. Here we present the atomic structure of an uncoating intermediate for the major human picornavirus pathogen CAV16, which reveals VP1 partly extruded from the capsid, poised to embed in the host membrane. Together with previous low-resolution results, we are able to propose a detailed hypothesis for the ordered egress of the internal proteins, using two distinct sets of channels through the capsid, and suggest a structural link to the condensed RNA within the particle, which may be involved in triggering RNA release.",

Picornaviruses are small icosahedral RNA viruses 3 responsible for many important animal and human diseases, from polio to the common cold, and are well-established models for non-enveloped viruses.

Circulating CAV16s are complex recombinant viruses involving multiple HEVA subgroup viruses 19 . Mature virions comprise 60 copies each of capsid proteins VP1, VP2 and VP3, arranged with quasi T \u00bc 3 icosahedral symmetry. These proteins possess the jelly-roll fold seen in many viral proteins and have N-terminal extensions, which, along with 60 copies of the smaller internal protein VP4, line the capsid and surround the single-stranded RNA genome.

This particle is endocytosed 23 and, at some point, engages fully with the vesicle membrane to deliver the RNA to the cell, leaving an empty, 80S or B-particle. Both 135S and 80S particles are antigenically distinct from the mature virion. Although no structures have been reported for CAV16, crystal structures for EV71 have been obtained for the mature capsid and also for an expanded natural empty particle.

            "text": "Identification of CAV16 135S-like expanded particles. CAV16 isolated from the Zhejiang Province, China, was grown in Vero cells, inactivated by incubation with formaldehyde and purified (Methods). Note that although all of our results here are derived from inactivated virus, our analyses of EV71 demonstrate that such stochastic cross-links do not perturb the capsid's threedimensional structure 14 . One batch of inactivated virus contained 160S mature virions plus natural empty particles, whereas another contained natural empty particles plus other particles that ran at markedly less than 160S. These latter particles were analysed by zonal ultracentrifugation, analytical ultracentrifugation and gel electrophoresis (Supplementary Figs S1-S3). Analytical ultracentrifugation shows that they have a sedimentation coefficient of 120S, somewhat less than the 135S value normally associated with A-particles, but their 260/280 nm absorbance ratio of 1.66 confirms that they contain RNA and gel electrophoresis analysis shows no evidence of VP4, typically 135S particles have lost VP4 ( Supplementary Fig. S3 ). These particles are therefore equivalent to the 135S disassembly intermediates identified for poliovirus; hence, we term them '135S-like'. It remains unclear why conversion occurred in only one batch of material ( Supplementary  Fig. S1 ). The PaSTRy assay 25 was used to investigate the stability and RNA accessibility of the 135S-like and natural empty particles ( Supplementary Fig. S4 ), demonstrating that the 135S-like particles are less stable than the natural empty particles, and that the viral RNA, which is inaccessible to fluorescent dye in the 160S mature virion, becomes accessible on conversion to the 135S-like particle. The 135S-like particle is broadly similar to the EV71 80S particle. We determined the atomic structure of the 135S-like CAV16 particles at 3.0 \u00c5 resolution, by room temperature in situ crystallography 24 , for two crystal forms (see Methods and Table 1 ). The two forms are essentially indistinguishable (r.m.s.d. 0.34 \u00c5 for 697 Cas); however, the P4 2 32 data yielded more reliable coordinates, which are used for all subsequent analyses. The CAV16 135S-like particle is exactly icosahedral, strikingly similar in structure to that of the EV71 80S-like particle 14 , and broadly similar to the expanded form of HRV2 (ref. 13 ) and the intermediate structures of enteroviruses determined by cryo-EM [6] [7] [8] [9] . Compared with mature virions, the particles show a 4% increase in capsid radius, a collapsed VP1 pocket, and paired helices from two molecules of VP2 are pulled apart, opening a major channel at the icosahedral two-fold axis 'two-fold axis channel', together with a smaller channel nearby at the base of the canyon 'off-axis channel'. Comparing the CAV16 135S-like particle with the 80S-like EV71 particle (PDB code 3VBR), the r.m.s.d. in Ca positions for 671 matched residues is 0.9 \u00c5, which falls to 0.7 \u00c5 if the icosahedral asymmetric units are superposed as rigid bodies ( Supplementary Fig. S5 ). This great similarity in atomic structure supports the proposal 14 that there are essentially two distinct configurations for enterovirus capsids, one corresponding to the mature virion and the other expanded, with different antigenic properties (Fig. 1 ). As expected, the expanded CAV16 particle lacks visible VP4. Indeed in line with other expanded particles, the internal protein festoon, primarily composed of VP4 and the N terminus of VP1, is completely lost.",

            "text": "135S particles show enlarged major openings and VP1 emerging. There are two notable differences between the CAV16 135S-like and EV71 80S-like structures: a widening of the two-fold axis channel and an obstruction in the smaller off-axis channel ( Fig.1 b,c) . Remarkably, the off-axis channel is plugged by the VP1 N terminus. Although the first 61 residues of VP1 are disordered (or cleaved), we can visualize 11 residues beyond those visible in the EV71 80S-like particle, 7 of which traverse the capsid (entering at residue 71 and leaving at residue 65) terminating on the surface at residue 62 (Figs 1c and 2a,b) . Although this change has relatively little overall impact on the particle (Figs 1b,c and 2b; for example, the structure of the pocket-factor-binding region is almost identical (Fig. 2c) ), there are marked alterations in the VP3 GH loop region. This loop contains a helix in the mature virion, but in both expanded particles it forms a b-hairpin. In the 80S-like particle the hairpin is short and clipped onto an extension of the I-strand of the VP3 b-barrel, whereas in the 135S-like particle the hairpin is more extended with one edge clipped to the VP3 b-barrel and the other to the extruded VP1 N terminus to form a sheet of five strands (Fig. 2d-f ). The enlargement of the two-fold axis channel in the 135S-like particle is achieved mainly by the reorientation of side chains, triggered by a reorganization of the carboxy terminus of VP2. In the 80S-like particle Arg 249 of VP2 interacts with carbonyl groups at the base of the VP3 GH loop, whereas in the 135S-like particle this side chain is disordered and the VP2 C terminus is rearranged, as is the side chain of Phe 98 of VP2. The net effect of these subtle changes is to increase the cross-section area of the two-fold axis channel by some 40%. The residues that separate the two-fold axis and off-axis channels are much less well ordered in the expanded particles than in the mature virus (Fig. 3a,b) . Geometric considerations show that the expansion and loss of protein components results in an increase in internal particle volume of B25% for the 135S-like particle compared with the mature virus. We have calculated low-resolution maps for the CAV16 135S-like particle to investigate the RNA structure and these show an B15 \u00c5 gap between the capsid and density, which we interpret as condensed viral genome (Fig. 4 ). In contrast, in the mature EV71 virion the RNA is evenly packed at a concentration of 4800 mg ml \u00c0 1 , forming a semistable core, which can be isolated from the virus 26, 27 (in the so-called plant picornaviruses, the far lower RNA concentration allowed ordered RNA to be detected) 28 .",

            "text": "Staged exit of proteins during uncoating. The crystallographic results from EV71 and CAV16 can be combined with the wealth of other data available for enteroviruses 7, 10, 29, 30 , to detail much of the process of cell attachment and entry. Work on poliovirus has shown that the mature virion 'breathes' transiently exposing the N terminus of VP1 (residues 1-53; Fig. 5a ) 4 . This has been captured by EM, again for poliovirus, using a Fab directed against the N terminus of VP1, showing egress close to the two-fold axes 30 . Usually the N terminus retracts rapidly back into the particle 4 ; however, on binding the cellular receptor (or in some viruses, such as the minor receptor group rhinoviruses, following a drop in pH), the lipidic pocket factor leaves VP1, probably in a cooperative fashion and the balance tips in favour of the expanded state, as described for EV71 (ref. 14) . The mechanism appears to be that receptor interaction at the sensor-adaptor region transmits changes, which destabilize the helix interactions at the icosahedral two-folds 14 . The expansion of the capsid increases its volume by 12% (arising from a 4% increase in radius 14 ) , facilitating movement of the VP1 N terminus (B85 \u00c5 for EV71) to exit the capsid at the two-fold channel 29 (Fig. 5b,c) with little perturbation to the structure. The CAV16 135S-like structure we report here shows that up to 64 residues of VP1 are exposed, including residues 3-22, which are likely to form an amphipathic helix 15 . If the particle remains in the expanded form, the CAV16 135S-like structure shows that the VP1 N terminus must then move sideways towards off-axis channel at the base of the canyon, rearranging the VP3 GH loop en route before being finally pinned to it by the main-chain hydrogen bonds. This also has the effect of increasing the size of the two-fold axis channel as described above. This structure is seen not only in our analysis of CAV16 135S-like particles, but also suggested by low-resolution cryo-EM analyses of 135S poliovirus particles 9 (Fig. 5c ). If the exposed VP1 amphipathic helix engages a host membrane, it will likely tug the VP1 N terminus, accelerating the motion through a 'Brownian ratchet' mechanism. A second VP1 N terminus can now exit through the two-fold axis channel and slide into the small opening on the opposite side of the two-fold (Fig. 5d,e) . Unravelling the VP1 N termini from the virus interior presumably unlocks the adjacent coils of VP4, which can, in turn, exit through the enlarged two-fold axis channel (Fig. 5f ). This membrane-association-catalysed process, combined with the icosahedral symmetry of the capsid, results in a series of 30 potential exit portals for the RNA, few of which will be close to the cell membrane.",

Higherresolution tomographic results are required to reveal the architecture of this engagement. The question remains why the RNA does not exit prematurely following receptor binding. Although we do not know the signal that triggers RNA release, in the CAV16 electron-density maps we observe links (Fig. 4) between the capsid and RNA density, one of which occurs at the point where VP1 leaves the capsid. These features suggest a mechanism of communication from outside the capsid to the RNA. Remarkably, RNA is resistant to hydrolysis by high levels of RNase during transfer in vivo, consistent with polarized exit through the appropriate channel, and it has also been shown to be resistant to RNAse in vitro (J. Hogle, personal communication). . (a,b) B-factor-coloured cartoon diagrams show that particle expansion greatly increases the relative flexibility around the two opening channels in 135S-like CAV16 in b compared with mature EV71 in a. Residues with B-factors substantially lower than the average are coloured in blue and above the average in red. (c,d) Electrostatic surfaces inside (c) and outside (d) 135S-like CAV16 around the two-fold axis channel contoured at \u00b1 3 kT/e. The low-resolution (50-6 \u00c5) map of 135S-like CAV16 contoured at 0.5 s indicates that the RNA genome is packed in layers inside the virus. The gap between the outer layer of the RNA and the capsid is about 15 \u00c5; this corresponds to the space left by the N-terminal residues of VP1 and VP4 after they have exited the capsid. There are patches of electron density bridging the RNA and the capsid proteins close to residues 74-80 of VP1 and the N termini of VP2. As the crystals of 135S-like CAV16 and 80S-like EV71 are isomorphous (overall isomorphous difference 31.6% for 6 \u00c5, 86.8% for 50-22 \u00c5 resolution shell) 14 , we also calculated a |F oCAV16 \u00c0 F oEV71 | low-resolution difference map (50-6 \u00c5), which shows similar features (data not shown).",

However, the mechanism by which the correct channel is selected for RNA egress is not established, and indeed virus rolling to achieve alignment cannot be ruled out. It seems most plausible that one end of the RNA exits first, most likely the 3 0 -end, as this has less secondary structure and, as the final portion to be synthesized, it is likely to be on the outside of the condensed genome, close to the capsid. The negatively charged regions on the inside of the particle close to the two-fold may then help direct the RNA through the appropriately sized two-fold axis channel ( Supplementary Fig. S6 ) by electrostatic focusing (Fig. 3c,d) . The RNA secondary structure is lost during the egress, as shown by loss of fluorescence of intercalating dye 23 , and, despite the flexibility of the particle in the region of the two-fold axis channel (Fig. 3b) , this is likely to slow the exit process in regions of high secondary structure.",
