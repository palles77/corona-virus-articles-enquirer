The performance of the RVP Fast assay was assessed in the analysis of 373 nasopharyngeal samples. For the viruses of the DFA panel, detection rates of 27.6% and 23.8% were obtained by RVP and DFA, respectively, in analysis of a set of 297 samples collected in 2009-2010. These results show statistically significant superiority of the RVP Fast assay (P = 0.049). For RSV, hMPV, EV, and RV, detection rates of 48.0% and 45.2% were achieved by RVP and RT-PCR, respectively. For individual targets, increased detection of EV/RV (P = 0.043) and decreased detection of influenza A virus (P = 0.004) by RVP in comparison to real-time RT-PCR was observed. The results of the present study imply the need to adjust the InfA component of the RVP Fast assay to also cover the InfA(H1N1) 2009 virus.",

The nonspecific symptoms of respiratory infections and overlapping seasons of the various viruses have forced virology laboratories to shift towards molecular assays. These enable rapid and costeffective detection of potential viral pathogens by offering short turn-around time, sensitivity and specificity superior to those of direct fluorescent assay (DFA) or culture, and a potential for multiplexing.",

            "text": "A feasible approach to broaden the detection spectrum is to employ postamplification detection in a solid phase (Li et al., 2007; Quan et al., 2007; Raymond et al., 2009; Takahashi et al., 2008) or a suspension array format Li et al., 2007; Mahony et al., 2007; Marshall et al., 2007; Merante et al., 2007; Nolte et al., 2007; Pabbaraju et al., 2008) . The xTAG respiratory virus panel (RVP) assay is a suspension array based on a multiplex PCR amplification. In the RVP Fast assay, sequential PCR, an exonuclease-phosphatase reaction, and target-specific primer extension steps of the original RVP assay have been replaced by a PCR amplification using biotinlabeled primers followed by hybridization of the amplicons to fluorescent beads with specific antitag sequences. The biotin label of the amplicons enables attachment of a reporter molecule, streptavidin-R-phycoerythrin. During the detection phase, the beads are identified and the signal from phycoerythrin is measured as an indicator of the specific amplification product present. The RVP Fast assay detects influenza A and B viruses (InfA and InfB), respiratory syncytial viruses A and B (RSV-A and RSV-B), parainfluenzaviruses 1-4 (PIV1-4), adenovirus (AdV), hMPV, CoVs 229E, OC43, NL63, and HKU1, enterovirus/rhinovirus (EV/RV), and hBoV. Additionally, the assay allows subtyping of InfA viruses to prepandemic seasonal H1 or H3 viruses. In this study, the performance of the RVP Fast assay is assessed in comparison to DFA, a real-time RT-PCR assay for detection of RSV and hMPV (Jokela et al., 2010) and a real-time EV and RV RT-PCR assay first described in the present study.

Implementing the RVP Fast assay into daily diagnosis of respiratory infections would result in negative findings with more clinical relevance, since a negative result of a reliably performed RVP analysis may be considered as absence of a spectrum of pathogens in the sample. Evaluation of the RVP Fast assay demonstrated that adopting a PCR-based multiplex assay results in a remarkable increase in overall viral detection rate of respiratory viruses, compared with conventional methods. The relatively high prevalence of EV/RV, CoVs, hMPV, and hBoV in our study population also emphasizes the need for a broader detection spectrum of respiratory virus diagnostics than what is achievable by the DFA. Moreover, a cost analysis study (Mahony et al., 2009) suggested that substantial savings may be achieved with testing by the xTAG RVP test alone, with most of the savings resulting from shortened lengths of hospital stays. However, since batching of samples for the RVP analysis retards the test results, the DFA is still the method of choice when PCR-based testing is too slow to support clinical decisions. Broadspectrum RVP analysis will result in samples with two or more viral pathogens identified. Although the clinical relevance of such findings is currently not clear, it has been suggested that coinfection with more than one virus may result in greater disease severity and longer hospital stays (Cilla et al., 2008; Esper et al., 2011; Paranhos-Baccal\u00e3 et al., 2008) . With multiplex testing becoming more common, our understanding of the epidemiology of respiratory viruses may be improved further and the clinical importance of mixed infections systematically studied.",

Concordant results were obtained for the negative samples, whereas two of the samples PCR-positive for seasonal InfA (mean Ct 37.2) remained negative by RVP. Moreover, the RVP Fast assay was unable to type one of the positive samples. Furthermore, only 12 (63.2%) of the 19 samples positive for InfA(H1N1) 2009 by RT-PCR were positive in the RVP Fast assay. These samples missed by the assay had a mean Ct of 32.8 in RT-PCR. The figures described above result in 76.2% concordance of the results, and the difference between the results was statistically significant in McNemar's test (P = 0.004). No InfB was found in the sample set collected in 2009-2010. To assess the performance of the RVP Fast assay in detection of InfB, 22 additional samples positive for the virus in DFA were analyzed by the assay.
