New pathogens are continually identified, the geographic patterns of disease shift constantly, and known pathogens continually change their patterns of sensitivity and disease manifestations. Tourism and globalization of business have exerted a profound impact on the spread of disease. Tropical and exotic diseases are becoming more common in western countries. The recent outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) demonstrated the potential for the worldwide spread of virulent diseases in a single season. Travelers often introduce the new pathogens before manifesting serious signs or symptoms, contributing to the global spread of disease. 1 This article reviews the new and emerging pathogens important to dermatologists.",

            "text": "Antibiotic resistance among staphylococcal isolates is a growing problem in many regions. Community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA) is increasing in prevalence and is predominantly associated with skin and soft tissue infections. 2, 3 Cutaneous abscesses and cellulites are particularly common. 4, 5 CA-MRSA appears to be more virulent than methicillinsensitive S aureus (MSSA). In a prospective observational study of 812 US Army soldiers, the baseline prevalence of CA-MRSA colonization was 3%. Soft-tissue infections developed in 9 of the colonized individuals (38%). In contrast, 28% were colonized with MSSA, and only 8 of the latter group (3%) developed clinical infections. 6 CA-MRSA strains generally share the presence of staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec (SCCmec) type IV in their genomes, but are genetically distinct from hospital acquired strains. 7 Many strains share a common genotype and tend to affect healthy individuals with no known risk factors for nosocomial acquisition. A second group, consisting of two related genotypes, spa types 1 and 7, has been responsible for severe infections in HIVpositive patients in Los Angeles and New York. 8 It is important to note that abscesses caused by CA-MRSA often respond to incision and drainage alone. 2,3 Antibiotic therapy (trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole with or without rifampin, tetracycline, vancomycin, or linezolid) is required for patients who do not respond to drainage and for all cases of cellulitis. Unfortunately, sensitivity to tetracycline and sulfa are often not reported by the laboratory. Some of the barriers to reporting are regulatory in nature and must be addressed. The newly formed Institute for Quality in Laboratory Medicine, a partnership representing the governmental and professional organizations involved in the establishment of benchmarks for quality in health care, has the potential to help address some of these issues. The American Academy of Dermatology, a member organization of the Institute for Quality in Laboratory Medicine, should act as a vocal advocate for our patients in seeking regulatory relief that would allow the reporting of all antibiotic sensitivities important to patient care.",

As of August 2004, 21 cases of severe peripheral and optic neuropathy had been reported. In most of the cases, the optic neuropathy resolved after linezolid was stopped, but peripheral neuropathy did not. Duration of therapy is the most important risk factor. 12 Vancomycin-intermediate S aureus is now recognized as an important emerging pathogen. Vancomycin-intermediate S aureus infection with phenotypic susceptibility to methicillin has been described, reinforcing the importance of culture and sensitivity testing in high-risk patients and any infection unresponsive to initial therapy. 13 Mupirocin remains a helpful agent for some patients with MRSA, but resistance is emerging. In New Zealand, where mupirocin was available over the counter from 1991 to 2000, mupirocin resistance among Staphylococcus spp is markedly higher than in other comparable countries. By 1999, resistance averaged 28%. 14 This observation reinforces the importance of using antibiotics only for appropriate indications.",

During the 2001 study year, the SENTRY Antimicrobial Surveillance Program evaluated the resistance rates of b-hemolytic streptococci. Seven hundred eighty-seven isolates were studied, from 25 medical centers in North America. Strains included serogroups A, B, G , C, and F. Resistance to erythromycin and clindamycin was highest among group B isolates. Most of the resistant strains were M-phenotypes, and all of the isolates were susceptible to b-lactams, linezolid, vancomycin, chloramphenicol, quinupristin/dalfopristin, and the fluoroquinolones. 17 Acinetobacter baumannii has emerged as an important nosocomial pathogen, causing pneumonia, bacteremia, meningitis, urinary tract infections, and skin and soft tissue infections. Multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter infections are being reported, and isolates resistant to almost all commercially available antimicrobials have been identified. Older compounds, such as polymyxins, and tetracycline may still be active, and ampicillin/sulbactam is effective in some of these patients. 18 Bartonella spp cause cat scratch disease and bacillary angiomatosis, as well as culture-negative endocarditis and neuroretinitis. Spread of disease may be through the bite of a flea or body louse. Disease is especially prevalent among the homeless, those with HIV infection, and other immunosuppressed patients. Culture methods have improved, including promising results with liquid culture media, but serologic testing remains the cornerstone of clinical diagnosis. For testing purposes, Vero cell cocultivated antigens appear to provide higher sensitivity and specificity when compared with agarderived antigens. 19 Molecular techniques, including polymerase chain reaction (PCR), offer high sensitivity and may establish the diagnosis when other tests have failed.",

Specifically, PCR analysis must target several genes and be coupled with DNA sequencing to avoid species misidentification. 20 Although B henselae infection is strongly associated with cats, a severe protracted illness was recently reported in an otherwise healthy police dog handler. 21 Although the infection may occur in both dogs and cats, in cats, B henselae bacteremia often persists for years, whereas in dogs long-term bacteremia is uncommon. 22 This difference probably accounts for the greater epidemiologic association between cats and clinical infection in humans.",

Human monocytic ehrlichiosis (HME) is caused by Ehrlichia chaffeensis. Both are emerging tick-borne infections caused by obligate intracellular bacteria in the family Anaplasmataceae. The organisms are closely related to the Rickettsiae spp. HA is carried by Ixodes ticks and HME by Amblyomma ticks. Most patients present with fever and variable signs and symptoms, including headache, myalgia, leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia. Meningoencephalitis is common with HME, but not with HA. This appears to be because infected host monocytes cross the central nervous system endothelial cell barriers 6 times more efficiently than neutrophils. 30 Molecular taxonomic methods have led to the reclassification of many organisms. Recently, Orientia tsutsugamushi, the agent responsible for scrub typhus, was removed from the genus Rickettsia. There are an estimated 1,000,000 cases of scrub typhus annually, and the disease is re-emerging in Japan, where serious pneumonitis occurs in up to 22% of patients. 31 Any patient with fever and an eschar should be evaluated for rickettsial-type diseases.",

Overall, the mortality rate was approximately 10%. 32 Recently outbreaks of measles have been reported in Chinese orphanages, and children adopted from Chinese orphanages have brought measles to the United States on commercial airlines. 31 Measles may also be brought back to the United States by tourists and students traveling to areas where the disease is more prevalent. Because of this risk, and to prevent school outbreaks of measles, there was a change in recommendations for measles vaccination in the United States in 1989, with a series of two injections currently recommended. The two-dose strategy has been shown to be effective in reducing the measles risk in the United States. 33 Avian influenza has emerged as a major public health threat in Asia. Like measles and SARS, it may spread rapidly to other continents. 34 West Nile virus is transmitted by Culex mosquitoes. Most infections are asymptomatic, and encephalitis is more likely in older patients. West Nile encephalitis was first identified in New York City in 1999. The initial outbreak included 62 human cases of West Nile virus infection with 7 deaths. In 2002, there were 4156 human cases of infection, with 284 fatalities. 35 The disease can be acquired through organ transplantation, blood transfusion, breast milk, transplacental transmission, and occupational exposure. A variable exanthem is noted in 19% of patients. 36 The Nipah virus, a virulent paramyxovirus, was first isolated during a large outbreak of viral encephalitis in Malaysia. It has been identified as a potential bioterrorism agent. Fruit bats are the reservoir for natural infection and probably introduced the virus to pig farms in Malaysia. The virus spreads quickly among pigs and can spread from them to dogs, cats, horses, and humans. 37 Morbidity and mortality are principally related to a systemic vasculitis with widespread thrombotic occlusion and microinfarction in most major organs, including the central nervous system. 38 Although the major symptoms are fever, headache, and giddiness followed by coma, cutaneous vasculitis is also possible.",

Pythiosis can present as localized disease and has systemic and vasculotropic forms. Skin lesions may appear as cellulitis, infarctive, or ulcerative. Arterial pythiosis is usually seen in association with an underlying hematologic disorder, such as thalassemia or aplastic anemia. Arterial pythiosis is characterized by ascending blood vessel involvement and thrombosis of the major arteries of the legs. As the organism is resistant to most antifungal drugs, the death rate is high. Immunotherapy with P insidiosum antigen has recently been used successfully in some patients. 58 ",

Recently, visceral leishmaniasis caused by Leishmania infantum has emerged as a widespread zoonotic infection of foxhounds in the United States and parts of Canada. 60 The potential for human disease exists, as sandfly vectors, such as Lutzomyia vexator, have recently been identified as far north as upstate New York. 61 Human cutaneous leishmaniasis, long endemic to South Texas, has recently been reported as far north as Pennsylvania in a patient with no travel history (personal observation and Centers for Disease and Control investigation initiated by William Tyler, MD). Leishmania mexicana has recently been identified in white-throated wood rats in Pima County, Arizona. 62 Various forms of leishmaniasis may emerge as important diseases with a widespread distribution in the United States. Cutaneous leishmaniasis will also be seen in many American soldiers returning from Iraq.",

Given the potential for rapid spread of virulent organisms and the potential use of some of these organisms for biological terrorism, surveillance is critical. Early warning systems have been designed that aggregate data from emergency room visits, private-practice billing codes, and veterinary practices with data on absenteeism, nurse hotline calls, and the purchase of medications. Together, the data could provide early warning of the use of a biological weapon or predict the start of an epidemic. The Electronic Surveillance System for the Early Notification of Community-Based Epidemics (ESSENCE) is one such surveillance system that operates in the Washington DC area. 63 The ESSENCE system is an early step in what should ultimately be a global network to track unusual and emerging pathogens.",
