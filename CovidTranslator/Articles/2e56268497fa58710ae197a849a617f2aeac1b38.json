While in male patients, the IgG antibody raised from mild status patients to general patients, and then decreased from severe patients to recovering patients. In addition to severe status, the level of IgG antibody in the other three statuses were nearly the same. While in severe status, compared with male patients, the level of IgG antibody in severe status seemed to be higher in female patients. Next, we mapped scatter diagrams respectively for the above four status of patients. However, none of these four status showed a statistical difference in IgG antibody level between male and female patients ( Figure 1B-1E) . Notably, in severe status, most of the female patients had an antibody level for more than 100AU/mL, while in male patients, most of the IgG antibody were under 100AU/mL. Together, above data showed that the SARS-CoV-2 IgG level in female patients seemed to be higher than that of in male patients in severe status.",

As is shown in Figure 2A , the proportion of range 0-10 AU/mL were consistent in male and female patients and the proportion of range 100-150 AU/mL was also close between male and female patients. However, the range 10-100AU/mL and 150-200 AU/mL showed great difference between two groups. In range 10-100 AU/mL, the male patients accounted for as much as 63.64%, while the female patient took up 27.27%. In range 150-200 AU/mL, the female patients accounted for as much as 54.55%, while the male patients occupied only 9.09%. Then we divided the severe status patient into two groups (high and low level: 0-100 AU/mL and 100-200 AU/mL) by antibody concentration. The statistical analysis showed that the level of IgG antibody in female patients was of no statistical difference between male and female patients in low level groups, while in high level groups female patients was significantly higher than male patients.

In addition, we collected the time information of each cases and analyzed the difference in IgG level after disease onset. The result showed that the level of IgG antibody in female patients tended to be higher than male patients in 2-4 weeks after disease onset, and the difference in antibody disappeared after 4 weeks of disease onset. Above data indicated that the generation of IgG antibody differs between male and female patients after disease onset. IgG antibody in female patient generated a high level in most severe cases and a stronger production in disease early phase.",

Here we reported that the production and dynamic of IgG antibody were different between male and female patients. In the early phase of the disease, the IgG antibody presented a stronger production in female patients. In the severe status, contrast with the male, SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody in female tended to enrich in the high levels. The above two phenomena may be good reasons to explain the different outcomes between male and female COVID-19 patients. However, the exact mechanism contributing to this difference remains elusive and needs further investigation. At present, convalescent plasma was considered as a potential therapy for COVID-19 and now has been used in sever and critical patients in clinical [9] . Our study proposed that convalescent plasma should be used in advance especially for female patient with low IgG antibody for a long time to prevent the disease from progressing to severe and critical status, if the convalescent plasma is available. In addition, our study also supported that monitoring the SARS-CoV-2 antibody for routine examination maybe an efficient way to predict the progression of COVID-19 patients.",
