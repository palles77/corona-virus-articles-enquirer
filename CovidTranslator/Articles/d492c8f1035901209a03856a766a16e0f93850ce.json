Here, we describe the development and validation of an oligonucleotide resequencing array for interrogating the entire 30-kb SARS-CoV genome in a rapid, cost-effective fashion. Using this platform, we sequenced SARS-CoV genomes from Vero cell culture isolates of 12 patients and directly from four patient tissues. The sequence obtained from the array is highly reproducible, accurate (>99.99% accuracy) and capable of identifying known and novel variants of SARS-CoV. Notably, we applied this technology to a field specimen of probable SARS and rapidly deduced its infectious source. We demonstrate that array-based resequencing-by-hybridization is a fast, reliable, and economical alternative to capillary sequencing for obtaining SARS-CoV genomic sequence on a population scale, making this an ideal platform for the global monitoring of SARS-CoV and other small-genome pathogens. 4 Corresponding authors.

            "text": "[Supplemental material is available online at www.genome.org and http://www.gis.a-star.edu.sg/homepage/toolssup. jsp.] In April 2003, the SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV), a singlestranded RNA virus, was identified as the pathogen responsible for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (Drosten et al. 2003; Fouchier et al. 2003) . Soon after, the consensus genome sequence for SARS-CoV was published (Marra et al. 2003; Ruan et al. 2003) . Our studies have shown that the SARS-CoV mutates at a significant rate. In addition to single nucleotide changes, we observed small deletions of 5-6 nucleotides in some SARS-CoV isolates. Also, we identified several recurrent sequence variants capable of distinguishing genotypes linked to strains originating in different geographical regions (Ruan et al. 2003) . As mutations can alter virulence and therapeutic response of viral pathogens, it is important to develop methods for the rapid monitoring of genetic changes in the SARS-CoV in human populations. Moreover, the rapid detection of genetic variants in newly confirmed SARS cases could also provide important clues to the geographic origins of infection, thus facilitating contact tracing.",

            "text": "Sequencing of viral genomes has historically used standard dye termination technologies. Recently, sequencing by hybridization to oligonucleotides has been described (Drmanac et al. 1992; Maskos and Southern 1992a; Southern et al. 1992; Schena et al. 1995) and commercialized (Pease et al. 1994; Nuwaysir et al. 2002) . These methods have been adapted for studies of genetic diversity in disease, genes, and between species (Drmanac et al. 1998; Hacia et al. 1998; Wang et al. 1998; Hacia 1999; Vahey et al. 1999; Brenner et al. 2000; Drmanac and Drmanac 2001; Fan et al. 2002) . Despite these advances, several limitations temper the enthusiasm for sequencing by hybridization, including difficulties in detection of deletions and cost considerations that signifi-cantly restrict array modifications and reformatting for optimization (Cutler et al. 2001; Drmanac et al. 2002; Nuwaysir et al. 2002) . We have developed a DNA resequencing array containing 383,102 in situ synthesized oligonucleotide probes capable of interrogating the entire 29.7-kb SARS-CoV genome. This array can detect single-base sequence variations with respect to the consensus SARS-CoV sequence, and all known deletions and insertions reported previously in 14 SARS-CoV isolates. As the array synthesis process is maskless, it is highly flexible, allowing any new sequence variation to be rapidly included on redesigned arrays within 2 d of discovery without additional manufacturing costs.",

On our array platform, each nucleotide to be queried is located at the 15 th position of a PM 29-mer oligonucleotide. For each PM oligo, probes representing the three possible mismatch nucleotides at the 15 th position were also synthesized on the array. The differences in hybridization signal intensities between sequences that bind strongly to the PM oligo and those that bind poorly to the corresponding MM oligos make it possible to discern the correct base at a given sequence position (Fig. 1B,C) . Our array contains probes to resequence all but 14 bases on either end of the 29.7-kb viral genome in replicate fashion. As the viral target in the hybridization reaction is double-stranded cDNA, the array contains probes to interrogate both strands of the SARS-CoV target. Because preliminary data suggest greater sequence polymorphism at the 3\u0408 end of the SARS-CoV genome, probes representing the last 18,000 bases are present in duplicate. Thus, each base is queried two to four times in a single hybridization. In all, our arrays contain 383,102 29-mer probes, with up to 4 PM probes per base position to resequence a total of 48,887 bases. By hybridizing each sample on two arrays, each base is effectively queried four to eight times, similar to the standard replication level used in traditional ABI capillary sequencing (ACS). The arrays were synthesized using NimbleGen System's Maskless Array Synthesizer (MAS) technology, which uses a computer-controlled digital mirror device for the in situ light-directed synthesis of oligonucleotides ( Fig. 1B ; Singh-Gasson et al. 1999; Nuwaysir et al. 2002) .",

Custom software was used to extract signal intensities and to compile the full genome sequence for each sample.

For statistical confidence, we hybridized each sample onto two replicate arrays. A mean call rate (i.e., rate of confident base calls) of 99.04% \u202b\u05e2\u202c 0.69% was achieved with duplicate hybridizations (Table 1) . We found that little improvement of the call rate could be gained with more replication. For example, Tissue 1 was hybridized on a total of six arrays and had a call rate of 99.24% for the first two arrays, 99.79% for four replicate arrays, and 99.82% for six replicate arrays for a maximum gain of only 0.58%. Using the ACS sequence as the gold standard for comparison, we found that our resequencing array achieves an accuracy rate >99.99% for called bases. This corresponds to an average of only 3.8 discordant calls per 100,000 bases sequenced. Notably, this is comparable with the average error rate found in the highest quality sequence obtained by ACS using the Phred algorithm (2.2 errors per 100,000 bases; Ewing et al. 1998; Richterich 1998 ). The precise causes of these discordant calls are unclear. Whereas their occurrence appears random with respect to samples and genomic position, they are reproducible within sample replicates. For example, Tissue 1 (1-1, 1-2, and 1-3; Table 1 ) contains one discordant call that is reproducible in 3/3 replicates. Using primer extension assay coupled with mass spectroscopy (Sequenom), we determined that this discordant call was the result of differential detection of coinfecting strains, where ACS called the correct base of one strain, and the resequencing chip called the correct base of the other (J.J. Liu, pers. commun.). This phenomenon, although having a small impact on our results, warrants further investigation. Approximately 1% of bases (i.e., mean = 284 bases per genome) were ambiguous calls (N calls). A base position was scored as N if the ABACUS algorithm could not make a confident call, or when different calls were made for the same position on replicate arrays. We found that the ambiguous calls were often reproducible (\u223c51% occurred in two or more samples) and frequently occurred in runs of two or more Ns, suggestive of genomic regions with poor hybridization characteristics (Fig. 2 ).",

We also observed a markedly reduced average feature intensity for probes with <20% G/C, with maximal average intensities for probes with >50% G/C. Together, these findings support the view that probes with low G/C content tend to hybridize weakly and produce insufficient signals for base calling, whereas probes with high G/C content hybridize strongly, such that a single mismatch is less likely to significantly destabilize hybridization ( Fig.  3 ; see Methods section Data Extraction and Analysis). We also found that probe secondary structure contributes to the ambiguous calls. In particular, probes containing regions of self-homology predicted to form stem-loop structures yielded insufficient signals for base-call discrimination. For example, we observed a string of 3-5 N calls beginning at position 25955. The probelength sequence at this position is palindromic, predicted by GeneRunner software to have a 9-bp stem and 4-bp loop (Fig. 4A) . The largest recurrent run of Ns spanned 12-16 bases, and is centered around position 22785. Examination of the sequence in this region revealed an AT-rich region resulting in a 3-bp stem and 9-bp loop and, concurrently, had a G/C content of only 17% (Fig.  4B ). In both cases, the frequency of ambiguous calls peaked within the predicted loop structure and coincided with low signal intensities and low PM:MM ratios. Together, we estimate that the majority of the recurrent N calls on a given array can be attributed to Tm (\u223c42%) and secondary structure (\u223c15%) phenomena.",

Sequence analysis using the resequencing array revealed that SIN0409 was most similar to SIN2774, a SARS-CoV strain used frequently by research laboratories in Singapore. The major difference between these two samples, however, was a novel 47-bp deletion between bases 27744 and 27790 in SIN0409. Subsequent resequencing of a vial of frozen virus, SINWNV, revealed identity with SIN0409 at the 13 signature genome positions used for SARS-CoV strain determination, including the 47-bp deletion, which was not observed in any other SARS-CoV strain sequenced to date.

Because the resequencing process relies on a previously determined consensus sequence, full-sequence attainment is achieved by simple base-call prediction rather than the more timeconsuming, and computationally intensive process of sequence assembly required of conventional ACS. We project that one technician using the resequencing array format can process up to 50 cDNA samples (i.e., 100 arrays) in 5 d, whereas the same sample volume would require 50 days and two technicians by conventional ACS. We find that the reagent costs of sequencing a genome the size of SARS-CoV are approximately equal for both methods. However, the only specialized equipment required for array hybridization is a 5-\u00b5m-resolution scanner (identical to that used for 2-color DNA microarrays), and an inexpensive hybridization apparatus. Thus, the initial capital and continuing maintenance costs for the resequencing array are significantly reduced compared with that required for a capillary sequencing machine. Furthermore, the resequencing platform does not require any specialized training for sample preparation and sequence acquisition. Taken together, the resequencing array is able to obtain sequence information more rapidly, and has significantly less manpower needs and infrastructure costs than ACS. Thus, the resequencing platform is ideal for investigating viral sequence variants in a parallel and whole-genome fashion under field conditions.",

In the case of the SARS-CoV, Vero E6 (monkey kidney) cells were identified early in the epidemic as an effective vehicle for viral amplification capable of achieving titers in the range of 10 8 viral copies/ \u00b5L. From a sequencing standpoint, this proved fortuitous, as the ability to sequence the 29.7-kb genome in rapid fashion depended on high-purity viral isolates. The drawback to this methodology, however, is that often more than 1 wk may be required to propagate and purify virus. Coupled with an additional week's time to prepare and sequence the genome, delays the identification of the SARS-CoV strain, which would allow for tracing of the infectious source. Here, we show that not only can the resequencing chip reduce the amount of time required to obtain full sequence, but that we can bypass cell-culture passaging and obtain reliable sequence data directly from patient tissue samples. This latter innovation was achieved in large part by a systematic primer design strategy to select primers based on not only optimal annealing characteristics, but also low predicted crosshomology with human transcripts-that is, the same criteria applied to the selection of oligo probes for expression microarrays. Through empirical testing of select primers, we derived the RT, first-round PCR, and nested PCR conditions necessary to amplify the entire genome from tissue specimens with approximate viral titers of only 2 \u202b\u05df\u202c 10 5 copies/\u00b5L. Notably, in the SARS case SIN0409, we amplified the full genome sequence (with the exception of \u223c2 kb) from a sputum sample and positively identified the viral strain within 3 d. In our validation studies, we also observed a consistent number of single-base variants when comparing viral sequence obtained from patient tissues with sequence following amplification in Vero E cell culture (V.B. Vega, C. Lee, Y. Ruan, J.J. Liu, P. Kolatkar, E.T. Liu, L.W. Stanton, P. Long, in prep.).

Novel deletions or insertions encountered by the resequencing array can be confirmed rapidly by performing capillary sequencing only on that small PCR fragment giving ambiguous calls, rather than on the entire genome. Because probes are directly synthesized on the array with great design flexibility, additional probes can be added to screen for any new deletions or insertions identified by de novo sequencing. A new array, capable of screening for these features, can be produced within 48 h, given the facile nature of the maskless array manufacturing process. In the case of pathogens in which strain coinfection is common, key SNP regions that distinguish strains could be specifically assessed by sequence technologies that can discriminate and quantitate heterozygous sequences, such as the mass-spectometry-based technology.",

The image was interpolated and scaled up \u202b\u05df5.2\u202c in size using NIH Image software (http://rsb.info.nih.gov/nih-image/). Each feature on the array consists of 49 pixels, and pixel intensities were extracted using NimbleScan Software (NimbleGen Systems). Sequence calls were made by statistical analysis of the hybridization intensities combining data from both strands using a customized version of ABACUS run at its default thresholds (Cutler et al. 2001) . Briefly, ABACUS makes base calls on the basis of the differential hybridization of genomic fragments to short perfect-match (PM) and mismatch (MM) oligonucleotides. In making base calls, ABACUS uses both the mean intensity for a feature as well as the variance in the intensity of the feature. Generally, large PM:MM intensity ratios are readily called. However, very small PM:MM ratios can be detected if the variance in intensity of those features is small. On the other hand, very large differences, when compromised by high variance, can result in no calls. When run at the default thresholds, a typical base call usually involves an observed mean intensity (on the PM oligo) more than 10 standard errors higher than the next brightest MM oligo. A single set of thresholds were used for this study. As samples were hybridized to at least two SARS Resequencing arrays, data from multiple arrays were integrated by combining called bases from multiple arrays. Discor-dant calls between arrays were designated as N. This analysis generated complete genome sequences in FASTA format and tabulated the polymorphisms identified. Visualization and multiple sequence alignment were performed using Gene Runner 3.05.
