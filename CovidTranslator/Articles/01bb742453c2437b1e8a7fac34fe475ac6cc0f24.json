            "text": "Recent studies have described several broadly neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (bN-mAbs) that recognize glycan-dependent epitopes (GDEs) in the HIV-1 envelope protein, gp120. These were recovered from HIV-1 infected subjects, and several (e.g., PG9, PG16, CH01, CH03) target glycans in the first and second variable (V1/V2) domain of gp120. The V1/V2 domain is thought to play an important role in conformational masking, and antibodies to the V1/V2 domain were recently identified as the only immune response that correlated with protection in the RV144 HIV-1 vaccine trial. While the importance of antibodies to polymeric glycans is well established for vaccines targeting bacterial diseases, the importance of antibodies to glycans in vaccines targeting HIV has only recently been recognized. Antibodies to GDEs may be particularly significant in HIV vaccines based on gp120, where 50% of the molecular mass of the envelope protein is contributed by N-linked carbohydrate. However, few studies have reported antibodies to GDEs in humans or animals immunized with candidate HIV-1 vaccines. In this report, we describe the isolation of a mouse mAb, 4B6, after immunization with the extracellular domain of the HIV-1 envelope protein, gp140. Epitope mapping using glycopeptide fragments and in vitro mutagenesis showed that binding of this antibody depends on N-linked glycosylation at asparagine N130 (HXB2 numbering) in the gp120 V1/V2 domain. Our results demonstrate that, in addition to natural HIV-1 infection, immunization with recombinant proteins can elicit antibodies to the GDEs in the V1/V2 domain of gp120. Although little is known regarding conditions that favor antibody responses to GDEs, our studies demonstrate that these antibodies can arise from a short-term immunization regimen. Our results suggest that antibodies to GDEs are more common than previously suspected, and that further analysis of antibody responses to the HIV-1 envelope protein will lead to the discovery of additional antibodies to GDEs.",

            "text": "Recombinant forms of the HIV-1 envelope (Env) protein have long been studied as HIV vaccine immunogens (Lasky et al., 1986; Berman et al., 1990) . The Env protein is synthesized as a 160 kDa precursor, gp160, which then undergoes maturational cleavage to yield gp41, a membrane-bound protein that mediates virus fusion, and gp120, a peripheral membrane protein that is responsible for CD4 and chemokine receptor binding and virus tropism. In virus particles, the envelope proteins gp120 and gp41 are associated by non-covalent interactions and form a trimeric spike structure. Both gp120 and gp41 are highly glycosylated, with approximately 50% of their molecular mass attributed to N-linked glycosylation. Since both gp120 and gp41 possess epitopes recognized by neutralizing antibodies, multiple vaccine development efforts have investigated the immunogenicity of these proteins. However, after more than 30 years of effort, none of the candidate vaccines described to date have been effective in eliciting broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs). For many years, the inability to elicit bNAbs was attributed to the inability to accurately replicate the trimeric structure of the Env protein found on the surface of viruses or virus-infected cells. However, the recent discovery of bNAbs to glycan-dependent epitopes (GDEs) on monomeric HIV-1 (Walker et al., 2009 (Walker et al., , 2011 McLellan et al., 2011; Pejchal et al., 2011; raised the possibility that the inability to elicit bNAbs was due to:",

Although the V1/V2 domain is known as a \"variable\" region (Leonard et al., 1990) , numerous glycosylation sites within the V1/V2 domain exhibit a high degree of conservation (Zolla-Pazner and Cardozo, 2010; Go et al., 2011) . Previously, it was thought that glycans on gp120 were poorly immunogenic. This characteristic, in addition to the unusually large number of glycosylation sites on gp120, was thought to be a major mechanism, glycan shielding, responsible for immune escape (Wei et al., 2003; Wyatt et al., 1995; Bunnik et al., 2008; Rong et al., 2007; van Gils et al., 2010 van Gils et al., , 2011 . However, the recent discovery of bN-mAbs to GDEs suggests that these epitopes are more immunogenic than previously imagined and that a vaccine targeting GDEs might help to overcome the problem of virus variation. Thus, we have begun to investigate the magnitude, specificity, and frequency of antibodies to GDEs resulting from immunization with recombinant Env proteins.",

            "text": "At this early stage of investigation, all antibodies to GDEs of the HIV-1 envelope protein are informative; however, antibodies to the V1/V2 domain of gp120 are of particular interest. First, the V1/V2 domain contains the GDEs recognized by several bN-mAbs (e.g., PG9, PG16, CH01-4, PGT145) (Walker et al., 2009 (Walker et al., , 2011 Pejchal et al., 2011; Sanders et al., 2002; Trkola et al., 1996; Mouquet et al., 2012; Bonsignori et al., 2011) . Second, nonneutralizing antibodies to the V1/V2 domain represent the only antibody response found to correlate with protection in the RV144 HIV vaccine trial, which included immunization with the ALVAC-HIV canarypox vector vaccine (vCP1521) and the AIDSVAX B/E recombinant gp120 subunit vaccine (Berman, 1998; Berman et al., 1999; Rerks-Ngarm et al., 2009; Haynes et al., 2012) . The lack of correlation between neutralizing antibodies and protection in the RV144 trial caused investigators to consider numerous ways by which non-neutralizing antibodies against the V1/V2 domain may confer protection against infection (Liu et al., 2013) . Such methods may involve viral inactivation through antibody-dependent cellmediated virus inhibition, virion aggregation, or inhibition of virion mobility and transport across mucosal surfaces (Liu et al., 2013) . Therefore, GDEs in the V1/V2 domain recognized by both neutralizing and non-neutralizing antibodies represent intriguing targets for candidate vaccines to prevent HIV-1 infection.",

These were designed to contain overlapping sequences of the 108060 Q655R-rgp140, similar to those previously described (Nakamura, 2012) (Fig. 1, Supplementary Fig. S1 ). Briefly, fragments of the 108060 Q655R-rgp140 sequence were designed to contain consecutive constant and variable domains of HIV gp120. The smallest fragment contained only the V1/V2 domain (Supplementary Fig. S1F ), while the largest fragment included sequences from the V1/V2 domain through the C4 domain ( Supplementary  Fig. S1B ). Constructs were appended with an N-terminal gD flag epitope for purification purposes and were expressed by transient transfection in FreeStyle TM 293-F cells. In order to maintain as much tertiary structure as possible, the constructs were designed to preserve the disulfide bridges found in the full-length gp140. As described previously (Nakamura et al., 1993 (Nakamura et al., , 2012 , fragments expressed by this approach are typically glycosylated, and maintain the disulfide structures required for recognition by a variety of conformation-dependent mAbs.",

These synthetic peptides contained neither the glycosylation nor the disulfide structures present in the secreted fragments used for the initial screening. In contrast to rabbit antibodies to MN-rgp120 that bound to multiple peptides, 4B6 was unable to bind to any of the synthetic peptides in this panel (Supplementary Table S1 ). This result suggested that 4B6 might recognize a conformation-dependent epitope. To further investigate this possibility, we measured binding to the native and the reduced and carboxymethylated (RCM) forms of the V1/V2 domain of MN-rgp120 ( Supplementary Fig. S1 , panel G). Surprisingly, we found that 4B6 bound to both the native and the RCM MN V1/V2 fragment ( Fig. 2A) . This result demonstrated that 4B6 recognized a conformation-independent epitope in the V1/V2 domain of both MN and 108060 Q655R gp120. The observation that 4B6 bound to the RCM form of MN V1/V2 but not to the synthetic peptides indicated that a factor other than conformation was required for 4B6 binding. We hypothesized that 4B6 binding may be dependent on the glycosylation present in the V1/V2 fragment expressed in mammalian cells, but not in the synthetic peptides.",

To prevent glycosylation at this position, we independently substituted for either the N or the T of the canonical N-X-T/S N-linked glycosylation motif. First, we replaced N at position 130 with histidine (H), because examination of multiple HIV sequence data sets revealed that histidine is the second most common amino acid at position 130 after N. The results of this study are shown in Fig. 4A . We found that replacement of N with H at position 130 completely abolished the binding of 4B6 to the V1/V2 fragment of MN-rgp120. To confirm this finding, we replaced threonine (T) at position 132 with alanine (A) in an independent construct. This substitution also disrupted the N130 PNGS and abolished the binding of 4B6 to the V1/V2 fragment of MN-rgp120 (Fig. 4B ). In contrast, neither of these mutations had any effect on the binding of a positive control anti-V1/V2 mAb (1088), whose binding has been established to be independent of glycosylation (Nakamura, 2012) .

This enzyme cleaves N-linked glycans at the first N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNac), effectively removing any carbohydrates on a glycoprotein. In ELISA assays (Fig. 2B) , we observed that PNGase treatment destroyed the binding of the 4B6 mAb to the MN V1/V2 domain fragment. To confirm that the PNGase treatment ran to completion, and to verify the identity of the species bound by 4B6, immunoblot studies were carried out. For these experiments, the mock-and enzyme-treated proteins were probed with either 4B6 (Fig. 5A) or an anti-gD control mAb, 34.1 (Fig. 5B) . We observed that the native and mock-treated V1/V2 fragment exhibited a molecular mass that was higher than expected, approximately 50 kDa. This anomalous migration was attributed to the high carbohydrate content of the V1/V2 domain which contains 9 PNGSs in 131 amino acids, including the gD tag. As expected, treatment with PNGase F resulted in a molecular mass consistent with the calculated (17 kDa) value. These results further suggested that 4B6 recognizes a GDE in the V1/V2 domain.

Second, we show that antibodies to GDEs can result from a relatively short immunization schedule and that continuous exposure to gp120 over a long period of time, as occurs during chronic HIV infection, is not required to elicit antibodies to GDEs. Third, we show that the 4B6 epitope is common among clade B viruses. Finally, we show that while 4B6 binds to GDEs in the V1/V2 domain, this binding is not sufficient for virus neutralization, and that additional factors determine whether an antibody possesses virus neutralizing activity.",

Diagram of the V1/V2 domain. The 4-stranded \u2424-sheet structure of the V1/V2 domain reported by McLellan et al. (2011) was modified to show the approximate location of glycosylation sites (red segments) recognized by the 4B6 mAb (N130) and the broadly neutralizing PG9 mAb (N156 and N160) (Walker et al., 2009) . Letters (A-D) indicate each strand of the \u2424-sheet structure. The two disulfide bonds at positions C126 and C131 flanking the N130 glycosylation site are also indicated (yellow). Other features including the B-C connecting peptide required for PG9 binding are also shown. (For interpretation of the references to color in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.) Pejchal et al., 2011) . While it has been well documented that N-linked glycans found on the HIV envelope protein function as a \"glycan shield\" to protect large regions of the gp120 structure from antibody binding by steric hindrance, we now know that this shield is imperfect, and that glycans can themselves become targets for neutralizing antibodies (Moore et al., 2012) . Recent studies of mAbs from HIV-infected humans have identified at least two different clonal lineages of bNAbs that recognize GDEs in the V1/V2 domain. These include the PG9 lineage that recognizes glycans at positions 156 and 160, and the PGT121/122 lineage that recognizes glycans at position 137 (Kwong and Mascola, 2012; Julien, 2013) . Thus far, antibodies from humans recognizing the N130 GDE have not been described. However, recent pepscan analysis of clinical specimens from VAX003 and RV144 vaccine trials revealed that the portion of the V1/V2 domain containing N130 PNGS is highly immunogenic (Gottardo, 2013) . The observation that the N130 site is contained within a region that is particularly visible to the humoral immune response supports the hypothesis that antibodies to the N130 GDE may additionally be found in human sera.",

            "text": "Studies showing that GDEs are major targets of bNAbs have prompted considerable interest in developing vaccines able to elicit antibodies to this class of epitope. However, numerous uncertainties remain concerning the best approach to elicit antibodies to GDEs in gp120. We know little regarding the optimal formulation or immunization regimen to elicit antibodies to GDEs. In humans, bNAbs to GDEs are seldom found until 2-3 years post-infection, following years of continuous exposure to viral antigens (Walker et al., 2009 (Walker et al., , 2011 Bonsignori et al., 2011) . Based on these kinetics, it has been postulated that antibodies to GDEs might only occur as the result of continuous exposure to highly glycosylated viral antigens, or as a consequence of breakdown in immune tolerance of the glycan structures resulting from HIV infection. Indeed, several groups are pursuing the possibility of \"guided\" immunization strategy with viral proteins recovered from the sequential virus isolates thought to have guided the evolution of antibodies to GDEs with broadly neutralizing activity (Kwong and Mascola, 2012; Bonsignori et al., 2012; Klein et al., 2013) . It is postulated that this approach might be effective in driving the evolution of antibodies with the atypical structures found in most bNAbs, such as long CDR H3 domains (>20 amino acids) resulting from unusual VDJ splicing, or highly mutated antibody genes (>100 nucleotide changes) resulting from unusually high levels of somatic mutation (Kwong and Mascola, 2012) . Moreover, bNAbs to GDEs often appear to bind simultaneously to two different glycan moieties (e.g., N156 and N160 in the case of PG9, and N302 and N332 in the case of PGT128) (Kong et al., 2012) . Our isolation of 4B6 demonstrates that antibodies to GDEs can arise in healthy, uninfected animals as a result of a short intensive immunization regimen with recombinant envelope protein. Further work to sequence and solve the structure of this antibody would provide insight as to whether its inability to neutralize HIV results from a lack of structural features (e.g., long CDR H3 domain, etc.) common to bNAbs.",

Until recently, vaccines were developed to epitopes that were primarily amino acids or carbohydrates, but not a combination of both.
