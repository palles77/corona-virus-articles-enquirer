            "text": "The assay for HIV reverse transcriptase-inhibitory activity was carried out according to instructions supplied with the assay kit from Boehringer Mannhein (Germany). The assay takes advantage of the ability of reverse transcriptase to synthesize DNA, starting from the template/primer hybrid poly (A) oligo (dT) 15. The digoxigenin-and biotin-labeled nucleotides in an optimized ratio are incorporated into one of the same DNA molecule, which is freshly synthesized by the reverse transcriptase (RT). The detection and quantification of synthesized DNA as a parameter for RT activity follows a sandwich ELISA protocol. Biotinlabeled DNA binds to the surface of microtiter plate modules that have been precoated with strepatavidin. In the next step, an antibody to digoxigenin, conjugated to peroxidase, binds to the digoxigenin-labeled DNA. In the final step, the peroxidase substrate is added. The peroxidase enzyme catalyzes the cleavage of the substrate, producing a colored reaction product. The absorbance of the sample at 405 nm can be determined using a microtiter plate (ELISA) reader and is directly correlated to the level of RT activity. A fixed amount (4-6 ng) of recombinant HIV-1 reverse transcriptase was used. The inhibitory activity of the trypsin inhibitor was calculated as percent inhibition as compared to a control without the protein [28] . The leguminous defensin-like protein sesquin was used as a positive control [28] and the antifungal protein mungin [32] as a negative control.",

After the integrase reaction, the biotinylated DNA immobilized on the wells was detected by incubation with streptavidin-conjugated alkaline phosphatase (Boehringer Mannheim) followed by colorimetric detection with 1 mg/ml p-nitrophenyl phosphate in 10% diethanolamine buffer, pH 9.8, containing 0.5 mM MgCl 2 . The absorbance due to the alkaline phosphatase reaction was measured at 415 nm. The ribosome inactivating protein trichosanthin was used as a positive control [32, 33] .",

Trypsin-inhibitory activity resided only in fraction Q1 eluted with 0.1 M NaCl (Fig. 1A) . This fraction was next chromatographed on SP-Sepharose to yield an unadsorbed fraction without trypsininhibitory activity, a sharp adsorbed fraction SP1 eluted with 0.2 M NaCl, and a broad adsorbed fraction SP2 eluted with 1 M NaCl in the starting buffer (Fig. 1B) . Fraction SP1, with trypsin-inhibitory activity eluted with 0.2 M NaCl, was fractionated on Mono Q to yield a small unadsorbed fraction S1 and a broad adsorbed fraction S2, both without trypsin-inhibitory activity. Trypsin-inhibitory activity was located in the sharp and more strongly adsorbed fraction S3 (Fig. 1C) . This fraction yielded a single sharp peak with a molecular mass of 40 kDa upon FPLC-gel filtration on a Superdex 75 column which has been calibrated with markers with molecular weights ranging from 67 to 17 kDa (not shown). The peak from Superdex 75 appeared as a single band with a molecular mass of about 20 kDa in SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2) . The purification of dull black soybean trypsin inhibitor is summarized in Table 1 . There was 65fold purification. The N-terminal sequence of the purified trypsin inhibitor was highly homologous to those of Kunitz-type trypsin inhibitors from yellow soybean, wild soybean and spinach ( Table 2) . Dull black soybean trypsin inhibitor and soybean trypsin inhibitor more potently inhibited trypsin than they inhibited chymotrypsin (Fig. 3) . Dithiothreitol dose-dependently and timedependently inhibited the trypsin-inhibitory activity of dull black soybean and soybean trypsin inhibitors (Fig. 4) . The trypsininhibitory activity of BSKTI was totally preserved after exposure to the entire pH range (1-14) for 2 h, and after exposure to temperatures up to 80 8C for 10 min. Only 80 and 70% activity remained after exposure for 10 min to 90 and 100 8C, respectively (data not shown). The dull black soybean trypsin inhibitor enhanced nitric oxide production by murine macrophages, and so did lipopolysaccharide and Con A (Fig. 5A ). The enhancement was in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 5B ). The enhancement caused by soybean trypsin inhibitor was only minimal. The dull black soybean inhibitor inhibited proliferation of HepG2 cells and MCF7 cells with an IC 50 of 39 and 70 mM, respectively. The corresponding values for soybean trypsin inhibitor were lower, being 31 and 47 mM, respectively ( Fig. 6A and B) . Dull black soybean trypsin inhibitor inhibited HIV-1 reverse transcriptase with an IC 50 of 9.4 mM (Fig. 7) . Soybean trypsin inhibitor was inactive. Dull black soybean trypsin inhibitor inhibited translation in the cell-free rabbit reticulocyte system with an IC 50 of 14 mM.",

Similarity to other leguminous trypsin/chymotrypsin inhibitors, however, is less obvious. The difference in molecular mass of the peak derived from BSKTI in gel filtration (40 kDa) and that of the band in SDS-PAGE (20 kDa) suggests that it is a dimeric Kunitz-type trypsin inhibitor like the inhibitor from Leucaena leucocephala [35] . Like G. soja trypsin inhibitor, which is adsorbed on SP-Toyopearl and DEAE-Toyopearl [24] , BSKTI is adsorbed on SP-Sepharose, Q-Sepharose and Mono Q. BSKTI is highly purified after three ionexchange chromatographic steps as evidenced by presence of a single peak in gel filtration on Superdex 75 and a single band in SDS-PAGE. Previously a procedure involving (NH 4 ) 2 SO 4 precipitation, cation exchange chromatography on SP-Sepharose and anion exchange chromatography on Q-Sepharose followed by chromatography on a trypsin affinity column was used to isolate the protease inhibitor bikunin from human urine [36] . The yield of BSKTI is comparable to that from Peltophorum dubium (50 mg/ 100 g) [37] but much higher than that (1.1 mg/100 g) from broad beans [3] . BSKTI is obtained with a purification fold about 9 times higher than that for the trypsin inhibitor from madeira-vine [38] . Like the sporamin B-like trypsin inhibitor from wampee seeds [39] , BSKTI exerts an inhibitory action on cell-free translation in the rabbit reticulocyte system.

            "text": "Although broad bean trypsin inhibitor, STI and BSKTI inhibit both trypsin and chymotrypsin, the potency toward trypsin is higher. In this aspect it resembles broad bean trypsin inhibitor [2] . The stability of the trypsin-inhibitory activity of BSKTI despite fluctuations in ambient pH, and its relatively high thermostability, are reminiscent of the pronounced stability of papaya Kunitz-type trypsin inhibitor [27] . The inhibitory effect of dithiothreitol on trypsin-inhibitory activity of BSKTI is indicative of the significance of the disulfide bonds to the activity of the inhibitor. The present findings are in agreement with a previous report on papaya Kunitztype trypsin inhibitor [27] but at variance with the findings on Erythrina caffra Kunitz-type trypsin inhibitor [2] . Protease inhibitors may exhibit immunomodulatory effects [45] . It is interesting to note that BSKTI stimulates nitric oxide production by macrophages. On the other hand, it fails to evoke a mitogenic response from splenocytes. Epidemiological evidence suggests that a diet rich in legumes reduces the incidence of cancer probably due to the presence of protease inhibitors [46] . The in vivo antitumor and in vitro antiproliferative [47] [48] [49] [50] [51] [52] [53] [54] [55] [56] activities of trypsin inhibitors have been demonstrated, but most of the anticarcinogenic activity was shown using Bowman-Birk trypsin inhibitors [2] . It is thus noteworthy that BSKTI reduces proliferation of hepatoma and breast cancer cells with a relatively high potency. Most Kunitztype trypsin inhibitors are inactivated by heat [2] . The observation that BSKTI has pronounced pH stability and thermostability and serine protease-inhibitory activity adds to the importance of the TI. Leguminous plants produce a variety of proteins including antifungal proteins [28] , lectins [29] , ribosome inactivating proteins [34] , trypsin inhibitors [2] , and a-amylase inhibitors.",

It has the potential of being developed into an agent for anticancer therapy in view of its potent anti-proliferative activity forward tumor cells and ability to elicit nitric oxide production from macrophages. On the other hand, it may not be useful in helping plants in combating against pathogenic fungi and bacteria since it lacks antifungal and antibacterial activities. It has potent inhibitory activity against HIV-1 reverse transcriptase and hence is a potential antiretroviral agent. However, there is no inhibition of HIV-1 integrase, unlike plant antifungal proteins [43] . The present investigation also reveals that dull black soybean trypsin inhibitor resembles soybean trypsin inhibitor in ability to inhibit activities of trypsin and chymotrypsin and tumor cell proliferation, but differs in ability to stimulate macrophages nitric oxide production and inhibit HIV-1 reverse transcriptase and cell-free translation. It appears that dull black soybean trypsin inhibitor is more versatile than soybean trypsin inhibitor in its biological activity. ",
