Outbreaks of many RNA viruses are still the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in worldwide population. Many antiviral agents against diverse viruses have been reported. However, effective antiviral agents which specifically target to some RNA viruses such as SARS-CoV, influenza A (H5N1, H1N1) and measles are in shortage due to genetic variations of the virus and the lack of approved or universally recommended therapies (Wen et al., 2003; Lorin et al., 2005; Triggiani et al., 2006) . Hence, there is a global requirement for continued development of new antiviral agents, especially from natural sources to provide several alternatives for the control, prevention, and management of the spread of diseases caused by RNA and DNA viruses. Number of compounds derived from natural sources are reported to have numerous biological activities, thus considered potential sources of various modern pharmaceuticals including antiviral agents (Jacobs and Coyne, 2013; Kim et al., 2016; Weeratunga et al., 2016) . Bee venom (BV) of the honey bee Apis melifera has been utilize as a traditional medicine for the treatment of rheumatism, arthritis, skin diseases, cancerous tumors, and back pains (Billingham et al., 1973; Son et al., 2007) due to its antibacterial, antiviral and anti-inflammatory effects (Habermann, 1972; Son et al., 2007; Hwang et al., 2015) . Such bio activities are explained by the variety of components contain in the BV such as peptides melittin (MLT), adolapin, apamin, and mast cell degranulating peptide; several enzymes including phospholipase A2 (PLA2); biologically active amines (histamine and epinephrine); and non-peptide components (carbohydrates, lipids, and free amino acids) (Lariviere and Melzack, 1996; Park et al., 2004; Son et al., 2007) . However, antiviral properties of BV have not well investigated and also its mechanisms are not fully understood.",

BV significantly induced higher levels of secreted IFN-\u03b2 compared to the control (medium only), which was similar to the pattern observed in rhIFN-\u03b2 treated HEK293T cell supernatant. Thus, data indicated that BV can mediate the antiviral innate immune responses in epithelial cells by triggering the expression of type I IFN, which may stimulate the antiviral state in the cells. As shown in Fig. 1C , BV (2.0 \u03bcg/ml) co-incubating with VSV-GFP at 4\u00b0C for 30 min before inoculating to the cells (virus/peptide co-incubation) also showed prominent reduction in virus titer at 24 hpi (5,370-fold) compared to the only VSV-GFP infected cells. Although in a low degree, HEK293T cells infected with VSV-GFP and treated with 3.0 \u03bcg/ml of BV (post-treatment) at 4 hpi also showed inhibition of virus replication at 12 (16136-fold) or 24 hpi (63-fold) (Fig. 1D ). Both BV and rhIFN\u03b2 post-treated cells showed similar virus titer, espe-cially at 12 hpi, and it was significantly lower than the only VSV-GFP infected cells. Based on the three treatment modes carried out, we speculate that anti-viral activity of BV attributed to stimulating type I IFN signaling, virucidal activity, and ability for the inhibition of virus replication after virus enter to the cells.",

Moreover, PR8-GFP viruses treated with PBS fractions (40% sucrose cushion) showed high virus infectivity in vitro, however, viruses co-incubated with MLT did not show the infectivity at over 40% sucrose cushions ( Fig. 6B and C) . Cells that were treated with the fractions from 20 to 30% sucrose cushion were very weakly infected, probably due to the remained intact virus particles that has not been interacted with the MLT. From the mass differences between native PR8-GFP and the MLT co-incubated with PR8-GFP fractions, it demonstrates that MLT has direct effect on structure destabilization of the virus particle, thus interrupts the virus infectivity.",

Among the three different modes of antiviral activities of BV studied, we mainly focused on the antiviral effect of BV by the co-incubation experiments. BV mainly constitutes MLT, PLA2, biologically active amines (apamin, adolapin), diverse peptides and non-peptide components (Habermann, 1972; Lariviere and Melzack, 1996; Park et al., 2004; Son et al., 2007) , thus we investigated antiviral activity of BV main constituents using the co-incubation experiment. As a result, it was found that MLT the only compound that showed the similar effects with BV (data not shown). MLT constitutes almost 40-50% of dry BV and is an \u03b1-helical cationic peptide with hemolytic activity in human erythrocytes (Tosteson et al., 1985) and other eukaryotic cells. It has a broad antimicrobial spectrum due to its ability to disrupt lipid cell membranes (Habermann, 1972; Tosteson et al., 1985) . MLT rapidly binds to human red blood cells already in sub micro-molar concentrations, induces release of hemoglobin, increase membrane permeability, and finally lysed the cells (DeGrado et al., 1982) . MLT disrupts cell membranes and kills Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria in micro-molar concentration range (Maher and McClean, 2006) . Besides its powerful antimicrobial and lytic activity, MLT exhibits a variety of other biological effects. MLT hinder transport pumps, such as (H + + K + ) ATPase (Cuppoletti et al., 1989) and (Na + + K + ) ATPase (Cuppoletti and Abbott, 1990) and accelerate the permeability of cell membranes to ions. It induces inhibition and aggregation of membrane proteins (Clague and Cherry, 1988; Mahaney and Thomas, 1991) , and also MLT stimulates activity of phospholipase A2 (Kuchinka and Seelig, 1989) . Furthermore, MLT could interfere with the activity of cellular enzyme, Na+, K+ ATPase, which responsible in membrane fusion process and suppresses cell fusion mediated by HSV-1 syncytial mutants (Baghian and Kousoulas, 1993) . Matanic and Castilla (2004) speculate that broad spectrum of antiviral actions might be due to ability of MLT to affect ion gradients across cell membrane. Previous studies also showed that MLT display anti-viral activity against animal and plant viruses such as murine retroviruses (Esser et al., 1979) , HSV-1 and HIV-1 (Wachinger et al., 1992 (Wachinger et al., , 1998 Baghian et al., 1997) and Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) (Marcos et al., 1995) , nevertheless, the mechanism of MLT activity has been not fully discovered in most cases.",

            "text": "In this study, antiviral effect of MLT was examined against broad spectrum of viruses. MLT exhibited antiviral activity against enveloped viruses such as Influenza A virus (PR8), Vesicular Stomatitis Virus (VSV), Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV), and Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV). Additionally, MLT also inhibited the replication of non-enveloped viruses such as Enterovirus-71 (EV-71) and Coxsackie Virus (H3). Based on our data, virus infectivity in the cells has decreased as the incubation time of the virus and MLT increased, and in the attachment or entry assay, MLT was unable to inhibit virus infection and replication (Fig. 5 ). Velocity sedimentation ultracentrifugation followed by immunoblotting convinced that mass of the PR8-GFP co-incubated with MLT was reduced compared to native PR8-GFP (Fig. 6) . Consequently, it could suggest that antiviral activity of MLT was mainly occurred due to involvement of direct interaction with the virus surfaces. This direct effect may involves to destabilize the virus structure and inactivates the viral particles (virucidal activity) which interrupts the virus infectivity. These results suggest that MLT may binds to the virus surface of the enveloped virus by surface charge interaction in virus and decrease the infectivity of the viruses (Li et al., 2011) . Previously, Esser et al. (1979) showed that the antiviral activity of MLT has been attributed to direct lysis of viral membranes, which demonstrated to murine retroviruses. Although electron microscopy or crystal structure analysis of the MLT interacting with the viral membranes has not been conducted in this study, previous information of the MLT crystal structure analysis and bio physical properties (a-helical, amphipathic, hydrophobic, and cationic) (Dempsey, 1990) , it could assume that MLT may also able to interact with the phospholipid bilayer of viral envelope and cause alterations of lipid organization in the membrane as reported for hemolysis (DeGrado et al., 1982; Terwilliger et al., 1982) or forms of ion-permeable channels in the way of the voltage gated 'pore' (Tosteson et al., 1985) or micellize disc formation in the membranes which could diffuse cell contents through the holes produced (Dufourc et al., 1986a (Dufourc et al., , 1986b . However, the exact mechanism involves not yet identified and needs to be elucidated in future studies. Moreover, one of the interesting data obtained from this study was that MLT can inactivate not only enveloped viruses, but also non-enveloped viruses such as Enterovirus-71 (EV-71) and Coxsackie Virus (H3). However, MLT effects to which constituent of the virus and extended virucidal activity mechanism against non-enveloped viruses needs to be investigated in detail. Additionally, apart from the virucidal activity of the BV, it was found that pre-treatment or post-treatment of BV can inhibit the virus replication. Especially, pre-treatment experiment demonstrated that BV could induce the type I IFN (IFN-\u03b2) secretion in HEK293T cells (Fig. 1B) . This data suggest that BV can mediate the antiviral responses in the epithelial cells by triggering the antiviral state, playing a crucial role in inhibition of viral replication. Moreover, post-treat-ment experiment of BV also showed the inhibition of VSV-GFP replication. However, MLT did not show the induction of type I IFN at 2 and 3 \u03bcg/ml (data not shown). From these results, it could assume that biological active components present in the BV other than the MLT can inhibit the specific viral replication steps of VSV. Consequently, it could expect that BV or specific compounds of BV might play a role for viral replication step and various innate immune pathways that can be involved in BV anti-viral activity, especially, stimulation of Type 1 IFN signaling, however, MLT has no effect on the stimulation of Type 1 IFN. The detail relationship between the mechanisms of the antiviral effects of BV and active compounds present, which has not been identified yet in the BV should be investigated further. Cytotoxicity of the peptide is one of the main difficulty rise during the clinical usage of therapeutic peptide, hence, cytotoxicity was evaluated for the BV and MLT and it exhibited range of CC50 (4.36-8.98 \u03bcg/ml) for tested cells (Table 1) . It could suggest from the data that the antiviral activity of BV or MLT against the viruses examined, were not resulted from the cytotoxicity of the peptide on the tested cells. Further, in vivo studies also showed no toxicity signs in the mouse during challenge experiments (Fig. 7) and mice protected from lethal infection of influenza A virus (H1N1). This suggest that MLT can be used safely as an antiviral agent against broad spectrum of viruses with in maximum efficacy dependent on the cell type, however, its safety in concern and mechanism of action needs to be elucidated more in detail in future.",

Moreover, its antiviral mechanism has been confirmed to involve direct interaction with the viral surface. Apart from BV virucidal activity, BV can stimulate type I IFN, which subsequently could stimulate the antiviral state in the host cell and also inhibit the viral replication. Taken together, these results suggest that BV or MLT has potential to become prophylactic or therapeutic agent for infectious viral diseases.",

Native PR8-GFP was loaded as an immunobloting positive control (PC). (B and C) The same fractions which used for immunobloting were examined for the infectivity of the virus particles by observing and measuring the GFP expression at 24 hpi, after infection to MDCK cells. GFP images were obtained under fluorescence microscopy (200X magnification). GFP expression levels were measured by Gloma multi dectection luminometer (promega). GFP expression levels were expressed as mean \u00b1 SD. Scale bars, 100 \u03bcm.
