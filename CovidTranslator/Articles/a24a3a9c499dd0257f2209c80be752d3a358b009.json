The rectal temperature is usually normal in the initial stages but becomes subnormal as the disease worsens. Affected calves die or recover in several days depending on the severity of the diarrhea and the therapy they receive. Death usually occurs in 3 to 5 days. lO Mild to moderately affected calves may be diarrheic for a few days and recover spontaneously with or without treatment. Those more severely affected become progressively worse over a period of several days, gradually become more weak, completely anorexic, and progressively more clinically dehydrated. The degree of dehydration will vary from 4 to 6 per cent of body weight (when it is just barely detectable clinically) to up to 10 to 16 per cent of body weight. Degree of hydration can be assessed by \"tenting\" the skin of the neck and measuring the time required for the skin fold to return to normal. In calves with 8 per cent dehydration, it will take 5 to 10 seconds for the skin fold to disappear; in calves with 10 to 12 per cent dehydration, it will take up to 30 seconds. 7 ",

This results in sufficient enterotoxin to stimulate intestinal villous hypersecretion, causing diarrhea. 32 Three adherence or colonizing factors have been identified on EPEC of calves, lambs, and pigs. They are pili (fimbriae), which are plasmidmediated, hairlike projections on the surface of the bacteria (Figs. 1 and 2) . These pili have been identified as the K88, K99, and 987P antigens. All three occur on EPEC of piglets, whereas only the K99 pilus has been commonly identified on calf and lamb EPEC. 62 The common adhesion factor of calf and lamb EPEC, which was first reported in 1971, was identified as a pilus and designated the K99 antigen in 1975. 13 ,62 Pilus antigens behave serologically like capsular K polysaccharide antigens during serotyping, and some were designated as K antigens even though they were recognized as protein. 48 A new nomenclature has been suggested to eliminate the confusion between capsular K and pilus K antigens.

It was suggested that type-A capsular polysaccharide should also be considered a virulence factor of bovine EPEC.65 PATHOGENESIS Categories in the pathogenesis of diarrhea have been described as (1) hypermotility, (2) increased intestinal permeability, (3) hypersecretion, and (4) malabsorption. 46 Enteric colibacillosis is an example of a diarrheal disease resulting from intestinal hypersecretion. In this disease, the intestinal villi, along with their digestive and absorptive capabilities, remain intact. The intestinal crypts also remain intact; however, their secretion is apparently increased beyond the absorptive capacity of the villi so that diarrhea occurs. 47 Calves are most susceptible to intestinal colonization by EPEC immediately after birth. Age-related resistance to adhesion appears to develop in the first few days of the calf's life. 66 It has been demonstrated that prior or simultaneous rotavirus infection enables ETEC colonization of the intestine in older calves. 74 Adherence brings the bacteria into close association with the intestinal villous cells, allowing colonization, and facilitates the effect of enterotoxin on the secretory cells. 66 Heat-stable enterotoxin initiates a buildup of cyclic guanosine 3' ,5'monophosphate (cGMP) in gut secretory cells, which produces net secretion. Hypersecretion causes the loss of needed electrolytes, including bicarbonate, and fluid into diarrheic feces. 16 ,20 Dehydration and acidosis occur because of these losses, causing the clinical signs of enteric colibacillosis and possibly death.",

There is peak absorption at about 6 hours of age with a decrease to no absorptive capability by 24 hours of age. 4,5 Absorbed colostral antibodies are active systemically against septicemic colibacillosis. They also provide local immunity within the intestinal lumen to protect against the scours of enteric colibacillosis. 42 ,43,45 Colostral K99 antibodies are most protective if consumed previous to infection with EPEC. 41 Calves should consume about 50 ml per kg body weight of colostrum at the first feeding, and this should occur within 4 hours after birth for maximum absorption. 43 A second feeding of colostrum seems to increase the efficiency of antibody absorption from the first. 28 Consumption of colostral antibody should continue during the first 24 hours of life to maintain antibody with the intestine during the time that EPEC adhesion to the intestinal wall may occur. 36 Colstral K99 antibodies have little effect once diarrhea has commenced; they are principally prophylactic in action. A recent study showed that K99 antibodies consumed up to 3 hours after oral challenge with EPEC were protective against enteric colibacillosis. These antibodies consumed 4 hours after challenge allowed disease to occur in most calves, with a 40 per cent mortality rate. After a 5-hour delay, there was no protective effect provided by the antibodies. 75",

In a controlled field trial using 23 herds (3508 cows) with histories of acute calf diarrhea, significantly fewer calves of cows vaccinated with the six-strain E. coli bacterin died of diarrheic disease than did calves of control cows. There was, however, marked interherd variation in efficacy. 57 A four-strain E. coli bacterin was used in 1980 investigations to evaluate its ability to elicit passive immunity in calves of vaccinated cows. Strain B41 (0101:K-:K99) was used as the source ofK99 antigen. Three other serogroups (0101:K30:K99, 09:K35:K99, 08:K85:K99) were also used because their capsular antigens were found on 90 per cent of the isolates of ETEC from diarrheic calves in Montana. 56 These same three capular antigens were also commonly associated with epizootics of neonatal calf enteric colibacillosis from other areas. 24 ,58 In a challenge study, all 21 calves nursing vaccinated dams were protected from acute enteric colibacillosis, whereas 14 of20 calves nursing control dams developed the disease. In 12 privately owned herds with histories of naturally occurring diarrheic disease, significantly fewer calves nursing vaccinated dams died of enteric disease than did calves nursing control dams. There was considerable interherd variability in efficacy, which could be expected because of the variety of infectious agents, environmental conditions, and management factors that can contribute to occurrence of calf diarrhea. 56",
