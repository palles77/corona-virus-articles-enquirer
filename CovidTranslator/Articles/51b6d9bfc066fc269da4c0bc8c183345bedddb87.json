The study comprised 67 patients with skin or mucous membrane lesions suggestive of herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection. The sensitivity of EM increased 25% after virus concentration by ultracentrifugation. Herpes virus infection was confirmed in 55 of the 67 cases by EM or VC or both. EM detected 53 herpes virus-positive lesion samples of which 14 were not detected by VC; only two lesion samples that were herpes virus-positive in VC were not detected by EM. The sensitivities of EM, VC, and Tzanck smear for the group of 55 herpes virus-positive cases were 96%, 75% and 76%, respectively. The specificity of the Tzanck smear was 83% (prevalence 82%). Colloidal gold immuno-EM was used to rapidly type HSV-1, HSV-2 and varicella zoster virus (VZV) present in skin and mucous membrane lesions in less than 4 h. Immuno-EM was able to detect antiviral antibodies on viral envelopes and viral cores in lesion samples with negative VC. Antiviral antibodies do not interfere with typing of herpes viruses by immuno-EM. It is suggested that formation of viral immune complexes and inactivation of virus particles by antibodies may have caused a Correspondence to: E. Folkers,",

The rapidity of obtaining a conclusive diagnosis of these herpes virus infections can be important, especially in immunocompromised patients, for prompt initiation of adequate antiviral therapy to prevent serious complications of the infection. Although viral culture (VC) by the demonstration of characteristic cytopathic effect (CPE) is still the 'gold standard' for the detection of HSV, this method is not completely specific or sensitive (Solomon, 1988) . Virus isoiation requires at least one day, but the CPE often does not become visible for several days (Gleaves et al., 1990) . Because the herpes virus, especially in case of VZV, can be inactivated during transportation or storage, the samples must thus be inoculated as soon as possible, which is usually difficult in non-university hospitals, in out-patient clinics, and in general medical practice.",

One third was used for adsorption of virus without addition of PTA and fixed and stained afterwards. The third part was transferred to a prewetted mortar with sand. To this sample the ultracent~fugation-enhanced method was applied. The results of herpes virus detection are shown in Fig. 1 . The number of particles detected after ultracentrifugation increased with a factor 10. No difference in detection of virus particles was observed before and after clarification of the suspension made from the SW50 pellet, nor caused dilution of the virus suspension to 400 ~1 or use of sand for tissue homogenization a decrease of virus detection in comparison with herpes virus detection in cell smear suspension by classical EM. Experiments in our EM laboratory with different types of herpes viruses (such as equine herpes virus, unpublished data) also confirmed the usefulness of sand during processing of organ tissue samples.

However, SPIEM carried out on pellet suspensions obtained after ultra~entrifugation showed a better virus~background-ia~lling ratio, but was still hampered by a higher background la~lling, compared with colloidal gold labelling of viruses directly adsorbed to carbon coated collodionnickel grids (compare Fig. 2 and Fig. 3) .

Virus particles, cores (c) and enveloped virus (ev) were adsorbed to EM grids coated with rabbit anti-HSV antibodies. Trapped virus particles were labelled with anti-HSV-1 monoclonal antibodies, followed by gold labelled anti-mouse antibodies. The efficient antigen trapping, also including viral proteins, is responsible for high background labelling (60 000 x ). virus typing was carried out by immuno-EM (Table 3 ). The specimen numbers are presented in a way as to create an overview of different typing levels. Since the electron microscope was available for a limited time during this study, the full range of typing tests could not be applied to all lesion samples. One VC (T5-4091) suggested VZV isolation based on the typical CPE (Table 3 : column 3, CPE). Therefore, herpes virus typing was omitted but HSV-1 was clearly demonstrated by immuno-EM. In 7 cases, showing negative VC (Table 3: column 3, nd), immune-EM was positive for HSV. In one sample (T5-1384), with negative VC, immuno-EM demonstrated VZV infection (Table 3: column   283 9, VZV).

It is not available in most diagnostic laboratories, but it can rapidly and specifically diagnose herpetic infection in crude vesicle fluid of lesions (Almeida, 1962) . This classical method, still in use by some EM laboratories, is based on detection of particles in suspensions made directly from smears. This technique might work well with lesion samples that largely consist of vesicle fluid and do not need a follow-up with gold labelling techniques. In addition, a large number of lesions are pustular and ulcerous and produce unreliable results with classical EM. The large amount of soluble proteins in such virus suspensions interferes with virus adsorption. The proteins adsorbed to the grid contain a lot of soluble viral antigens that make these grids unsuitable for successive virus labelling. Smith et al. (1962a,b) studied trypsin-chymotrypsin treatment of samples and agar filtration followed by virus detection in pseudoreplicas (Sharp 1960; Palmer 1975) to increase virus counts. These techniques are not suitable for the routine laboratory.",

In SPIEM, the virus is picked up by a bilayer of protein A and capture antibody adsorbed to the EM grid (Kohn et al., 1985) . The improvement of transmittable gastroenteritis (TGE) virus detection in faeces by SPIEM was at least 100 fold, compared with standard EM (Van Nieuwstadt et al., 1988) . El-Ghorr et al. (1988) showed that this EM-adapted 'ELISA technique' can easily be combined with gold labelling techniques. Our studies indicated that this technique can also be used for herpes virus diagnosis (Fig. 3) , and the 2 samples that were missed by EM in this study ( Table 2 ) might have been detected in this way. SPIEM certainly will increase herpes virus detection levels. However, SPIEM gold labelling profiles are not consistent because background levels depend largely on the amount of soluble antigen present in a specific lesion sample. Therefore, it is not advisable to apply SPIEM-gold labelling methods directly to the crude tissue suspension, but labelling profiles will be better when carried out on ultracentrifugationtreated virus suspensions.",

This probably contributed to the high virus particle count observed after diluting the virus suspension 15-20 times to approximately 400 ~1. In addition, we found evidence that the use of sand and the effect of short sonication greatly facilitates herpes virus release from cell fragments and improves the detection of equine herpes viruses in the organ tissues of aborted foetuses (unpublished observations). Therefore, we assume that the use of sand facilitates the release of viruses from all types of HSV lesions. Taking into account the above considerations, the improvement of detection by a factor lo-12 after centrifugation through tartrate was no surprise. Moreover, protein-free virus suspensions after ultracentrifugation make all successive gold labelling steps more easy to interpret and will give more reliable and reproducible results.",

However, a relation cannot be found between the lesion type and the presence of human (IgA, IgM, IgG) antiviral immunecomplexes in EM preparations (Table 3) , which implies that we cannot explain a decrease of VC sensitivity simply by circulating anti-HSV antibodies, which may have penetrated into the lesions and neutralized the viruses in the final stages of the disease.
