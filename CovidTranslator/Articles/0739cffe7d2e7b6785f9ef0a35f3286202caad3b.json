The microbiological flora on the hands can be classified into resident and transient groups.

In contrast, transient microbes do not reproduce while on the hands, and are normally only viable for a short time. However, they can be pathogenic, easily transmitted or colonize skin wounds or dermatitis [1, 2] .",

Appelgrein et al. reported that ozonized water was inferior to propanol based hand rubs [7] , while Nakamura et al. observed a 3 log 10 reduction in CFU after hand washing with ozonized water, or antimicrobial soap and water [8] . A concern is that ozone gas is toxic to humans at high concentrations and can substantially damage the lungs. However, the gas can be dissolved in tap water for hand washing, and most of the gas then passes in the water through the outlet of the sink. The Norwegian Labor Inspection Authority accepts an 8-h average exposure (TWA) of 0.1 ppm in the working atmosphere [9] . Usually humans can also notice the characteristic smell of ozone gas at very low concentration.",

Based on this work, ozonized water might be an alternative to traditional hand disinfectants. However, larger studies in clinical settings would be required to validate its efficacy. The potential use of ozonized water against viruses should also be further examined, including a possible effect on the new COVID-19.",
