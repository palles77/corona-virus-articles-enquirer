In this context, we hypothesized that transfecting alveolar type II epithelial cells with CCR3-targeted siRNA or antisense (AS-ODN) sequences will downregulate cellular synthesis and release of the primary CCR3 ligands CCL26 and CCL24 and will modulate other CCR3 ligands. The human A549 alveolar type II epithelium-like cell culture model was used for transfection and subsequent effects on CCR3 agonists. siRNAs were particularly effective. PCR showed a 60-80% decrease in mRNA and immunoblots showed up to 75-84% reduction of CCR3 in siRNA treated cells. CCR3-siRNA treatments reduced IL-4 stimulated CCL26 release and constitutive CCL24 release by 65% and 80%, respectively. Release of four additional CCR3 agonists RANTES, MCP-2, MCP-3 and MCP-4 was also significantly reduced by CCR3-siRNA treatments of the alveolar type II cells. Activation of eosinophils, assessed as superoxide anion generation, was reduced when eosinophils were treated with supernatants of A549 cells pretreated with CCR3targeted siRNAs or AS-ODNs. Collectively, the data suggest that post-transcriptional regulation of CCR3 receptors may be a potential therapeutic approach for interrupting proinflammatory signaling.",

The chronic inflammation causes an associated increase in airway hyperresponsiveness and leads to episodic wheezing, breathlessness and coughing\" (1) . While the episodic symptoms may often be successfully treated, the chronic airway inflammation is more insidious. Bronchial biopsy studies have revealed that asthmatics in clinical remission do show ongoing airway inflammation and remodeling of the pulmonary epithelium (2). The emerging paradigm of asthma depicts an incompletely repaired damaged epithelium that displays altered permeability and releases increased amounts of numerous growth factors, cytokines and chemokines (3) .",

            "text": "Chemokines orchestrate leukocyte trafficking during states of homeostasis, immune responses and inflammation, and are implicated in the pathogenesis of chronic diseases including asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), emphysema and chronic bronchitis. Chemokines directly modulate cell bioactivities through complex networks wherein a particular chemokine may bind multiple chemokine receptors with varying affinities and subsequently direct migration/activation of specific types of inflammatory leukocytes (4) . For example, asthma is characterized by Th2-type cytokine-driven elevation of CC chemokines including the three eotaxins CCL11 (eotaxin-1), CCL24 (eotaxin-2) and CCL26 (eotaxin-3) (2). The eotaxins serve as recruitment signals for eosinophils (EOS) with concomitant increases in Th2 lymphocytes, mast cells and basophils. Bidirectional interactions between the emigrating leukocytes and the resident cells, in particular the epithelium, engage the selfsustaining proinflammatory cycle (3) . The three eotaxins, as well as CCL28, exert effector actions by binding to their high affinity G-protein-coupled receptor designated CCR3 (7) (8) (9) which is expressed by EOS, basophils, mast cells, subsets of Th2 lymphocytes and dendritic cells (10) (11) (12) . Of particular interest to the present studies are the findings that the constitutively expressed CCR3 of airway epithelial cells is increased following stimulation with IL-4 or IL-13. This stimulation also increases synthesis and release of CCL11, CCL24 and large amounts of CCL26. CCR3-CCL26 receptor-agonist autocrine regulatory mechanisms result in downregulation of both CCR3 and CCL26. Thus, the eotaxins may contribute to pathogenesis at sites of Th2 phenotypic inflammation not only through leukocyte recruitment but ligand-CCR3 receptor autoregulatory mechanisms (12) .",

Reported approaches to inhibiting CCR3-ligand transduction signaling have focused on synthesis of low molecular weight antagonists and eotaxin-neutralizing antibodies (17) (18) (19) (20) . Attractive alternatives include antisense oligonucleotides (AS-ODNs) and short-interfering RNAs (siRNAs) directed at posttranscriptional inhibition of gene expression rather than blocking gene products (21, 22) . Of importance here is the recent report indicating that AS-ODN-induced topical inhibition of CCR3 expression may represent a novel and efficacious approach for the treatment of airway disease (23, 24) . The therapeutic potential of siRNA for treatment of human disease is being explored at the levels of target identification, product specificity, potency, delivery and clinical effects (25) . Studies involving siRNA-based treatment of respiratory diseases have focused predominantly on viral infections and acute lung injury (26) (27) (28) . Reports involving the eotaxins have been limited to delineating factors which modulate their synthesis (29, 30) . To date, effects of CCR3-targeted siRNA delivered to human airway epithelial cells have not been reported.",

Studies were carried out to test the hypothesis that transfection of alveolar type II cells with CCR3-targeted AS-ODNs or siRNAs will downregulate alveolar type II epithelial cell CCR3, synthesis and release of the agonists CCL26 and CCL24 and will also modulate other chemokines that bind to CCR3. Briefly, the data confirm that CCR3-targeted AS-ODNs and siRNAs significantly inhibited CCR3 expression which then concomitantly decreased CCL26 and CCL24 synthesis and release as well as release of other CCR3 ligands. Supernatants from CCR3 AS-ODN or siRNA treated A549 cells significantly reduced eosinophil superoxide anion release suggesting that inhibition of CCR3 expression at the alveolar epithelium level may be a key approach to limiting eosinophil activation within the airway.",

It was of interest to explore the effect of CCR3 antisense treatment on expression of CCL26. Results are shown in figure 4 . Treatment of cells with antisense 1 or 2 did not significantly decrease amounts of CCL26 measured in whole cell lysates. In contrast, both antisense 1 and 2 significantly decreased IL-4 stimulated release of CCL26. Treatment with sense AS-ODN sequences 1 or 2 had no significant effect. These results suggest that regulation of CCL26 may be partly controlled by blockade of the CCR3-ligand pathway through targeted antisense treatment.",

Results for constitutive release and IL-4-stimulated release of CCL26 are depicted in figure 5A and 5B, respectively. As expected, very little constitutive release of CCL26 was noted. Cells stimulated with IL-4 in the absence of transfection mix released 1564 \u00b1 112 pg/ml CCL26 (data not shown). Cells treated with the non-targeting siRNA transfection mix released 959 \u00b1 201 pg/ml CCL26 while treatment of cells with duplex 7 reduced CCL26 by only 13%. In contrast, significant inhibition of IL-4-stimulated release of CCL26 was noted for duplexes 8, 9, 10 and the combined SMARTpool. The percents inhibition of CCL26 release were 63%, 53%, 65% and 64%, respectively. Alveolar type II cells constitutively release CCL24 which increases following treatment of cells with IL-4. Results of the present experiments indicate that cells constitutively released 176 \u00b1 61 pg/ml CCL24. Effects of constitutive release of CCL24 in cells treated with CCR3-siRNA sequences are shown in figure 6A . Very significant inhibition of CCL24 release was noted following treatment with CCR3-siRNA transfection mixes. Inhibitions were as follows: duplex 8 -77%, duplex 9 -59%, duplex 10 -74% and SMARTpool -95%. Interestingly, when siRNA treated cells were stimulated with IL-4, less inhibition of CCL24 was measured, as shown in figure 6B . Although the percent inhibition of stimulated CCL24 release was 53% in duplex 8 treated cells and 55% in SMARTpool treated cells, these were not significantly different than the non-targeting siRNA treated cells. Taken together, these results suggest that treatment of alveolar type II epithelial cells with CCR3-targeted siRNAs significantly influences the release of eotaxins under basal and stimulated conditions.",

Cells were treated with either non-targeting siRNA or CCR3 SMARTpool siRNA with or without subsequent stimulation with IL-4. Results of selected cytokines capable of binding to CCR3 are depicted in figure 7 . Results with CCL24 and CCL26 corroborate CCR3 siRNA effects demonstrated in previous figures and thus validate the cytokine array results. Four additional chemokines capable of binding to CCR3 were significantly increased by treatment with IL-4 and include CCL5 (RANTES), CCL8 (MCP-2), CCL13 (MCP-4), and CXCL11 (I-TAC). Comparisons of the NT + IL-4 versus SP + IL-4 treatments indicated significant decreases for CCL5, CCL8, CCL7 (MCP-3) and CCL13. Other ligands of interest included the CCR3 antagonists CXCL9 (MIG) and CXCL11 (I-TAC). CXCL9 (MIG) was not altered by IL-4 or CCR3 siRNA treatments, in contrast, data indicate that CXCL11 may be upregulated by IL-4. These results suggest that post-transcriptional silencing of CCR3 modulates chemokines capable of signaling through the receptor as either agonists or antagonists.",

Therefore, EOS were exposed to medium of IL-4 stimulated and AS-ODN or CCR3-siRNA treated airway epithelial cells and O 2 \u2022\u2212 generation by EOS assessed and depicted in table 1 and figure 8 , respectively. Significant decresases in O 2 \u2022\u2212 generation were measured from EOS exposed to supernatants collected from cells pretreated with antisense 1 or 2. Results with supernatants from CCR3-targeted siRNA treated A549 cells are depicted in figure 8 .

All CCR3-siRNA duplex treatments of A549 cells yielded supernatants which decreased O 2 \u2022\u2212 generation by EOS. These data suggest that products released from stimulated A549 cells contained proinflammatory mediators including the CC chemokines CCL26 and CCL24, that act to stimulate O 2 \u2022\u2212 generation by EOS, and CCR3 targeted AS-ODN or siRNA treatment may lead to desirable decreases in EOS activation.",

Thus, chemokine ligands and receptors are important candidates in the development of novel anti-inflammatory strategies. In these present studies we have focused on the airway epithelial cell CCR3/eotaxin axis as a viable target for development of novel post-transcription-based therapies to interrupt the underlying proinflammatory cycle of chronic airway diseases. CCR3 is expressed on EOS, basophils, airway epithelial cells and subpopulations of mast cells, activated Th1 and Th2 cells, macrophages and dendritic cells. The present experiments were designed to test the hypothesis that transfection of alveolar type II cells with CCR3-targeted AS-ODNs or siRNAs will results in downregulation of surface CCR3, decrease synthesis and release of CCL24 and CCL26, and modulate other CCR3 ligands. Results demonstrate that: 1 -both CCR3-targeted AS-ODNs and siRNAs decreased CCR3 mRNA which, in turn, caused a decrease in CCR3 protein, 2release of IL-4-stimulated CCL26 was significantly decreased, 3 -constitutive release of CCL24 was likewise significantly reduced, 4 -downregulation of chemokines was extended to non-eotaxin CCR3 ligands and, 5 -EOS bioactivity was reduced in response to products released from the siRNA treated alveolar type II cells.",

Cell culture systems, including the A549 alveolar type II epithelial cell system, have been valuable tools for delineating potential targets (29, (32) (33) (34) . In these present investigations, the A549 cell culture system was employed to demonstrate that CCR3-targeted siRNA resulted in specific reduction in the target gene mRNA and subsequently its protein. Use of several effective siRNA duplexes suggested specificity of the effects. Absence of \"off-target\" effects is also supported by the lack of effect of the non-targeting duplexes designed as scramble sequences not present in the human genome. This is the first report of the efficacy of CCR3targeted siRNAs for downregulation of CCL24 and CCL26 as well as other known CCR3 ligands, namely CCL5, CCL8, CCL7 and CCL13. Collectively, the data suggest that post-transcriptional regulation of this chemokine receptor may be a potential therapeutic approach for interrupting proinflammatory signaling.",

            "text": "Humans possess all three eotaxins, CCL11, CCL24 and CCL26, which transduce signals predominantly, though not exclusively, via the CCR3 receptor. Results of previous investigations from this laboratory have demonstrated that alveolar type II cells constitutively express CCR3, and the Th2 cytokines IL-4 and IL-13 increase both CCR3 expression and synthesis and release of CCL24 and large, sustained amounts of CCL26 (31, 12) . Elevated levels of both IL-4 and IL-13 have been reported in asthmatic lungs where they act as chemotactic agents and activate effector pathways of both resident cells and emigrated EOS and other leukocytes (35) (36) (37) (38) (39) . Importantly, these present investigations demonstrate that posttranscriptional silencing of CCR3 decreased release of the receptor's predominant ligands CCL26 and CCL24. Since several other resident pulmonary cells express CCR3 and produce eotaxins (40) (41) (42) (43) (44) (45) , these results suggest that CCR3-targeted siRNAs may downregulate cognate CCR3 receptors on resident cells of the lung with subsequent downregulation of the leukocyteattracting chemokines and a favorable interruption of persistent underlying inflammation. Chemokines modulate immune system responses by coordinating leukocyte recruitment and activation during both innate and adaptive inflammatory responses (46) . Complexity of the chemokine network adds to the challenge of designing inflammation-targeted therapies. The CC and CXC chemokine networks, categorized by receptors, principal agonists, antagonists and functional activities, have been implicated in human allergy/inflammation. In addition to the three eotaxins, known agonists for CCR3 include CCL5 (RANTES), CCL7 (MCP-3), CCL8 (MCP-2), CCL13 (MCP-4), CCL15 (MIP-1\u03b4) and CCL28 (MEC) (5, 47) . Conversely, the CXCR3 high affinity ligands CXCL9 (MIG), CXCL10 (IP-10) and CXCL11 (I-TAC) are known antagonists at CCR3 (47) (48) (49) . In the case of asthma, increased release of several of these CC chemokines namely CCL2 (MCP-1), CCL13, CCL5, the three eotaxins, CCL17 and CCL22, is firmly established (50, 51) . Herein, cytokine array results demonstrate that, in addition to the eotaxins, several other CCR3 agonists were increased during IL-4 stimulation of untreated alveolar type II cells. These included CCL5, CCL8 and CCL13. In IL-4 stimulated cells pretreated with CCR3-targeted siRNA, there was a significant decrease in these same agonists as well as CCL7. Interestingly, the MCPs and RANTES (CCL5), specifically chemotactic for monocytes and lymphocytes, were also affected. The CCR3 antagonists CXCL9 and CXCL11, chemotactic for T lymphocytes and mast cells (52), were not significantly altered by CCR3 siRNA and IL-4 treatments. Collectively, these results suggest that CCR3 gene-specific silencing may extend beyond recruitment of EOS and may also include mononuclear cells.",

            "text": "Prominent airway mucosa infiltration of activated EOS is considered a central pathologic feature of chronic airway diseases such as asthma (53) . Airway epithelial cells are an important source of cytokines/chemokines which stimulate EOS bioactivities (54) including generation of reactive oxygen species such as O 2 \u2022\u2212, release of leukotrienes, degranulation of EOS-specific cationic proteins and release of cytokines. The compelling evidence which indicates that CCL11 and CCL24 function with IL-5 to promote EOS emigration and activation and CCL26 supports prolonged recruitment and activation (55, 39, 56) may require expansion to include additional CCR3 ligands, in particular CCL7, CCL8 and CCL13 (47) . Thus, exploring the effects of CCR3-siRNA and CCR3-AS-ODN treatments of alveolar type II cells on bioactivity of EOS was of interest since EOS are known to generate O 2 \u2022\u2212 generation stimulated by occupation of their CCR3 receptors (57) . Significantly reduced levels of O 2 \u2022\u2212 were generated by EOS exposed to CCR3-targeted siRNAs or AS-ODN treated/IL-4 stimulated A549 cell supernatants. These results imply that depletion of CCR3 and resulting modulation of its ligands would result in an effective reduction of activated EOS in the airway.",

            "text": "In summary, although some symptoms of airway diseases may be controlled, there is a need for therapies that provide control of chemokine-driven chronic airway inflammation (58) . These investigations have focused on the CCR3/ligand network and demonstrated that alveolar type II cell release of CCL24 and CCL26 may be down-regulated by post-transcriptional silencing of CCR3. Concomitant decreases in additional CCR3 ligands (CCL5, CCL8, CCL13 and CCL7) also occurred and together reduced EOS bioactivity in response to products released from the treated cell. These findings establish the appropriateness of CCR3 as a target for development of siRNA or AS-ODN post-transcriptional gene inhibition therapies for the control of alveolar inflammation in airway diseases. First-strand cDNA was synthesized from total RNA by reverse transcription (RT) and cDNA amplified by PCR using human CCR3 and GAPDH primers. PCR products were separated by electrophoresis in 1.2% agarose gels, stained with ethidium bromide and mRNA expression captured by a Fluor-s Max MultiImager. Panel C -Data from experiments are expressed as the relative CCR3/GAPDH ratio mean \u00b1 SD. Treatments which differed significantly (p < 0.05) from the non-targeting siRNA followed by IL-4 treatment group are indicated by an asterisk. Cells were cultured, treated with siRNA then stimulated with IL-4 (100 ng/ml) as described in figure 1 . Panel A depicts a typical dot blot of 10 \u03bcg/well of lysate proteins probed for human CCR3. Panel B summarizes dot blot densities of CCR3 from three separate experiments acquired with Quantity One analysis software. Data are expressed as mean pixel density \u00b1 SEM. Panel C shows similar experiments where cell lysate proteins were separated by electrophoresis on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels (10 \u03bcg lysates protein/lane), transferred to Immobilon-P PVDF membranes and probed for human CCR3 and GAPDH. Panel D depicts the western blot band density ratios of CCR3/GAPDH in three separate experiments expressed as relative mean CCR3/GAPDH ratio \u00b1 SEM. In panels B and D asterisks indicate those treatments which differed significantly (p<0.05) from cells treated with non-targeting siRNA followed by stimulation with IL-4. Cells were treated with 3 \u03bcM antisense/sense 1 or 2 as described in figure 3 followed without (panel A) or with IL-4 stimulation (30 ng/ml) for 18 hr (panel B). Cell lysates were prepared, total protein assessed and 50 \u03bcg protein used for CCL26 sandwich ELISAs. Asterisks indicate treatments that differed significantly (p < 0.05) from cells stimulated with IL-4 in the absence of oligonucleotides. Cells were treated for 96 hr with 120 nM siRNA (non-targeting control, duplex-7, -8, -9, 10 alone and the SMARTpool combination in the presence of DharmaFECT 1. Treated cell monolayers were washed with serum-free medium then incubated for an additional 24 hr in the absence (panel A) or presence of IL-4 (100 ng/ml) (panel B). CCL26 was quantified in culture supernatants by specific sandwich ELISA. Data are the mean \u00b1 SEM of three experiments each performed in duplicate. Asterisks indicate those treatments which differed significantly from the non-targeting siRNA control as assessed by Dunnetts post test with p < 0.05. Cells were treated as described in figure 5 . CCL24 was assessed in cell culture supernatants by specific ELISA following incubation without (panel A) or with IL-4 (100 ng/ml) (panel B). Data are the mean \u00b1 SEM of three experiments each performed in duplicate. Asterisks indicate those treatments which differed significantly from the non-targeting siRNA control as assessed by Dunnetts post test with p < 0.05. A549 cells were treated with non-targeting or SMARTpool CCR3 siRNA followed by IL-4 (100 ng/ml). Supernatants were assayed for the presence of cytokines using the RayBio\u00ae Human Cytokine Antibody Array C series 1000. Images were obtained with a Flour-s Max Multi-imager. Densities of cytokine protein spots were quantified with Quantity One 1-D Analysis Software Version 4.6.0. Data were normalized to the membrane positive control and are expressed as relative pixel densities of the mean \u00b1 SD of two samples. The ANOVA Tukey post test was used with p < 0.05 to determine significant differences between non-targeting (NT) and NT + IL-4 (\u25c6) or between NT + IL-4 and SP + IL-4 (*). Figure 8 . Superoxide anion generation is suppressed in clone 15 HL-60 eosinophilic cells exposed to supernatants from CCR3-siRNA treated A549 alveolar type II cells A549 alveolar type II cells were treated as described in figure 1 and supernatants used to stimulated EOS as described in table 1. Additional controls included EOS in medium (control), and medium to which 100 ng/ml recombinant CCL26 or CCL24 had been added. There was no significant difference between IL-4 and non-targeting (NT) siRNA + IL-4 supernatants. Asterisks indicate those treatments which differed significantly from the non-targeting siRNA control as assessed by Dunnetts post test with p < 0.05.",

Cells were rested for 12 hr then stimulated for 4 hr with IL-4 (30 ng/ml). An aliquot of cells was stained for flow cytometry as described in figure 1. Panel A: Histograms are labeled as follows: isotype antibody control is the gray filled histogram, CCR3-FITC stained untreated cells are represented by the light gray dotted line and the thick black line represents cells stimulated with IL-4 for four hours but without antisense 1. The light black lines indicate CCR3-FITC staining following treatments with CCR3 AS-ODN sequence 1 at 1 \u03bcM or 3 \u03bcM. Histograms are representative of experiments performed in duplicate on three separate occasions. Panel B: The remaining cells were used for western immunoblotting.
