It consisted of 1001 adenine (24.1%), 849 cytosine (20.4%), 877 guanine (21.1%) and 1425 thymine (34.3%) residues. The Chinju99 S ORF nucleotide sequence was 94.5% homologous with that of the Br1/87 and CV777 strains, respectively. The Chinju99 S protein had 92.8% amino acid identity with that of Br1/87 and CV777, respectively. The amino acid sequence contained 27 potential sites for asparagine (N)-linked glycosylation and there was a stretch of highly hydrophobic residues at position 1325\u00b11350.",

Pigs in all age groups are susceptible to the disease and show acute diarrhea and dehydration, leading to death with high mortality, especially up to 90% in 1\u00b12 weeks old piglets [7\u00b19] . PED is clinically and pathologically similar to transmissible gastroenteritis (TGE), which obscures the differentiation of the two diseases. Immunity is, therefore, important for the prevention and control of the disease. Moreover, maternal antibodies derived from immunized sows are the sole source for immunity to the disease in highly susceptible neonates during the first few weeks after birth [7, 9] . However, no effective vaccines have been developed for the mucosal immunity in the gut of pigs where the etiologic agent causes severe enteritis [9] .",

            "text": "The etiologic agent, porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), belongs to the family Coronaviridae of the order Nidovirales and has a genome of positive sense, ss-RNA [7, 10] . The subgenomic mRNAs, which are transcribed from the genome, produce viral proteins such as the spike (S, 180\u00b1220 kDa), membrane (M, 27\u00b132 kDa) and nucleocapsid (N, 55\u00b158 kDa) proteins [10\u00b112] . Recently, Pensaert [9] suggested a molecular mass of 85\u00b1135 kDa for the S protein. Among the proteins, S, a glycoprotein peplomer on the viral surface, plays an important role in the attachment of viral particles to the receptors of host cells with subsequent penetration into the cells by membrane fusion. The S glycoprotein also stimulates induction of neutralizing antibodies in the host [13] . The S gene is, therefore, an important target for cloning and expression in the development of genetically engineered vaccines. Duarte et al. [14] reported a sequence of 1741 nucleotides in the region between the S and N genes of the British, Br1/87 and Belgian, CV777 strains of PEDV. Duarte and Laude [13] also reported a sequence of 4162 nucleotides including the coding region of the Br1/87 S gene. More recently, the complete S gene sequence has been reported within the complete genome sequence of PEDV CV777 [15] .",

Previous studies showed the same lengths for the nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences of the S gene in Br1/87 [13] and CV777. A single ORF of 4149 nucleotides was identified with the potential to produce a coronavirus S protein [18] . The Chinju99 S gene also had a sequence GUAAAC at 8 nucleotides upstream of the initiator ATG as previously recognized in Br1/87 [13] . This is a common hexameric motif in coronaviruses and similar to the motifs XUA(A/G)AC found adjacent to other PEDV ORFs [12] . The hexameric motifs were suggested as the site for transcription of the subgenomic mRNAs [18] .",

Similarly, the Br1/87 S protein [13] had 29 potential N-linked glycosylation sites and a hydrophobic stretch at 1322\u00b11337. Consequently, the conformational features of the Chinju99 S protein are probably highly conserved with those of Br1/87. Nevertheless, the Chinju99 S gene showed 94.5% nucleotide sequence homology and 92.8% amino acid sequence identity with those of both Br1/87 and CV777, respectively, although the ratios of adenine (24.0\u00b124.1%), cytosine (20.4%), guanine (21.1%) and thymine (34.3\u00b134.4%) were identical or very similar among the three strains. Accordingly, the Chinju99 S protein had only minimal differences in overall structure compared to that of Br1/87 and CV777. Nevertheless the minor differences in the structural features of the S protein could help in elucidating aspects related to both molecular pathogenesis and antigenic structures of PEDV isolates in relation to prevention and control of the disease. This is the first published report on the nucleotide sequences of the S gene of any Korean PEDV isolate. In the present study, the complete nucleotide sequence of the Chinju99 S gene was determined, and its amino acid composition was analyzed in comparison to other PEDVs. The nucleotide sequence of the Chinju99 S gene can form the basis for further studies on the development of genetically engineered vaccines and diagnostic reagents for PEDV isolates in Korea.",
