Newer macrolide have been introduced that show improved ab orption after oral administration, better gastrointestinal tolerance, and delivery of increased amount ofdrug to the infection ite. Macrolides are commonly used in community-acquired pneumonia, as ,'.'ell as in atypical pneumonia and legionello is. The newer macrolides, in comparative studies, have been shown to be as effective as the conventional therapies for treating acute otitis media, acute sinusitis and acute pharyngitis, with a low incidence of side-effect. HOlvever, dosing can be simplified because of their unique pharmacokinetic properties. Limitations in the use of macrolides for respiratory infections include rather marginal activity in the most severe cases ofHaemophilu influenzae infections, lack of activity against Kleb iella and other coliforms, which precludes their lise as single agents in the therapy of pneumonia in patient with Significant underlying disease or in the elderly, and development of resistance in treptococci and taphylococci.",

It is derived from a strain of Streptomyces erythreus discovered in a soil sample from the Philippines. Macrolides have been widely used during the last four decades, mainly in out-patients with respiratory tract infections. In recent years, their use in clinical practice has become even more extensive, the renewed interest in macrolide antibiotics having several causes. Their value for the treatment of lower respiratory tract infections has been increasingly appreciated, since their antibacterial spectrum matches almost exactly that required for the therapy of pulmonary infections caused by more recently recognized pathogens (Legionella spp., Chlamydia pneumoniae, C. trachomatis). Molecules have been developed that overcome some of the disadvantages associated with erythromycin: irregular and limited absorption after oral administration; and frequent adverse gastrointestinal side-effects. In addition, newer agents that assure increased amounts of drugs in infected tissues have been recently introduced including, in particular, 14-membered macrolides such as roxithromycin, dirithromycin, flurithromycin and clarithromycin, and the IS-membered azithromycin which results from the insertion of a methyl-substituted nitrogen into the erythromycin molecule, producing a new class of macrolides, the azalides.",

The antimicrobial activity is due to the binding of the macrolide molecule to the 50S ribosomal subunit, effectively blocking the ribosomal P site and resulting in the inhibition of RNAdependent protein synthesis. Due to very different ribosomal structures, this binding cannot occur in eucaryotic cells, which accounts for the low toxicity ofmacroIides in humans. Ofparticular interest in the context of respiratory tract infection therapy is the fact that macrolides exhibit consistent activity against atypical bacteria frequently involved in pneumonia (e.g. Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Chlamydia spp.) whereas~-lactams and aminoglycosides are ineffective. Macrolides also possess excellent potency against Legionella spp., Bordetella pertussis and Corynebacterium diphtheriae, as well as having certain antimycobacterial activities which can be helpful in the context of the recent increased prevalence, and the multiple-resistance problems of these diseases.",

In general, 14-membered macrolides are more active against streptococci and B. pertussis than is azithromycin (a IS-membered azaIide), which in turn is more active than the 16-membered macrolides. Clarithromycin is the most active compound against Streptococcus pyogenes, pneumococci and Corynebacterium spp. Azithromycin exhibits greatly enhanced potency (eight-fold or more) against Gram-negative species, including H. infiuenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Campylobacter jejuni and Enterobacteriaceae, probably as a result of the insertion of the second basic site of protonation into the macrocyclic nucleus which improves the outer membrane [4] . Clarithromycin yields similar minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) against H. injluenzae as erythromycin but is metabolized in vivo, leading to the production of a 14-hydroxy metabolite that is a little more active than the parent compound and with which it generates an additive effect [5] .",

            "text": "Resistance to macrolides may result from reduced permeability in Enterobacteriaceae, drug inactivation (notably in Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli [6] ) or, most importantly, alteration of the target site. The last mechanism involves a demethylation of adenine residues in 23S ribosomal RNA leading to a reduction in the affinity between the antibiotic and the 50S fraction of the ribosome. As a result, the activity of macrolides, lincosamides and streptogramin B (the so-called MLS B phenotype) is affected [7] . This alteration can be inducible [8] , in which case the resistance is apparently dissociated, the 14-and 15-membered macrolides being clearly inactive, whereas the MICs of 16-membered macrolides are less than 1mg/l [3] . The clinical efficacy of 16-membered macrolides in infections caused by strains possessing the inducible MLS B phenotype, however, remains to be solidly documented and some authorities feel it would be preferable to avoid the use of all macrolides in such cases. MLS B resistance can also be constitutive, with clear cut resistance to all antibiotics ofthe group. MLS B resistance has been shown in many bacterial species, including staphylococci, streptococci, C. diphtheriae and Le- gionella spp. [9, 10] . The erythromycin resistance methylase gene (erm) responsible for the MLS B phenotype can be located on a plasmid, a transposon, or the chromosome. The prevalence of resistance to macrolides shows great geographical variations. Resistance of methicillin-susceptible S. aureus ranges from 1% to 50%, community isolates being more frequently susceptible than hospital isolates, and the majority of methicillin-resistant staphylococci are resistant to macrolides [2] . Prevalence of erythromycin resistance in pneumococci is also variable and has tended to increase during recent years. The percentage of resistance seems to peak in South Africa, reaching more than 50% in one report [11] and pockets of high incidence have been reported in France [12] , Belgium and Spain. In many other areas, resistance has been reported to be lower than 5% [11] . Some of the pneumococcal isolates are especially troublesome because of multiple resistance, affecting practically all drugs available except vancomycin [13] . Resistance in S. pyogenes is generally less than 5% in most parts of the world, with some notable exceptions, such as Japan, where a prevalence exceeding 50% has been reported [14] . Resistance in Legionella spp. and mycoplasmas is very infrequent, and remains rare in C. diphtheriae [7] .",

Excellent tissue penetration is the pharmacokinetic hallmark of macrolides; they penetrate well into the host cells, particularly phagocytes, and once within the cells, the macrolides only slowly egress. As a consequence of this, tissue:plasma antibiotic ratios are well above lover the complete time course following ingestion, high macrolide concentrations are found in most tissues and body fluid (with the exception of the cerebrospinal fluid), tissue and plasma half-lives are prolonged (Table 3) , and apparent volumes of distribution are relatively large. In practical terms, this unique pharmacokinetic profile has allowed simplified dosing schedules, with the possibility of once-S56 daily administration for roxithromycin, dirithromycin and azithromycin [17, 18] . Tissue specificity depends on the compound and appears to be especially remarkable in the case of azithromycin, a feature thought to be due to the insertion of a second nitrogen capable of protonation in the molecule. After oral administration, azithromycin produces relatively low plasma concentrations, but a number of animal models of localized infections have demonstrated that efficacy of azithromycin correlates with its extravascular pharmacokinetics and not with blood concentrations [19] .",

Erythromycin, however, generates a rapid increase in gastric and upper intestinal motility when administered either by the oral or the intravenous route, and this can produce serious discomfort in patients and a high incidence of vomiting [22] .

Antibiotic therapy of streptococcal pharyngitis is important for the prevention of suppurative complications, notably otitis, and reduction of the risk of acute rheumatic fever. The gold standard for treating the disease is a 1O-day course ofan oral penicillin, or in poor areas, a single intramuscular injection of 1.2 x 10 6 IU benzathin penicillin. There are some problems, however, associated with these schedules: possible serious allergic reactions; the need for oral administration every 6-8 h, or a painful injection; and a high incidence of therapeutic failure manifested by recurrent symptomatic illness. As an alternative, a 1D-day course of erythromycin is traditionally used to treat streptococcal pharyngitis in patients allergic to penicillin. Some of the newer macrolides may, however, challenge the traditional regimens, due to their attractive pharmacokinetic properties, allowing simplified dosing, and their excellent tolerance. Several studies have shown that drugs like josamycin, c1arithromycin, roxithromycin or azithromycin are as efficacious and better tolerated than traditional comparators (Table 5 ). In these studies, the newer regimens were simplified, which may have led to a better patient compliance. With this regard, the efficacy obtained with a 3-day course of azithromycin was especially impressive.",

This is a potentially severe disease which can lead to meningitis or an intracranial abscess. The bacterial species most often responsible for acute sinusitis include S. pneumoniae (the main agent), H. injluenzae and various anaerobic bacteria belonging to the oral flora; S. aureus, S. pyogenes and M. catarrhalis have also been implicated. The efficacy of antimicrobial therapy is well established in this disease and conventionally includes any of the drugs used to treat otitis media. Significant efficacy has been obtained using macrolides but classic studies have shown that patients with sinusitis due to H. injluenzae responded more slowly to therapy with erythromycin than did those with streptococcal sinusitis [32] . Until recently, therefore, the relatively poor activity against H. injluenzae justified the macrolides not being considered as first-line drugs in sinusitis. The newer compounds, which ensure improved penetration into the appropriate tissues and fluids, may reverse this trend. Illustrating this statement, clarithromycin has been found to be as effective and well tolerated as amoxycillin in the treatment of acute sinusitis [33] , and azithromycin for 3 days yielded similar results to clarithromycin given for 10 days [34] .",

There are multiple microbiological causes ofpneumonia and, since the exact aetiology is difficult to determine in many cases, the phy-sician must use a management strategy that does not rely on a precise diagnosis in each case. Macrolides are part of this strategy for several reasons: they are the drugs of first choice in Mycoplasma pneumoniae infections which are the main bacterial cause of socalled 'atypical pneumonia'; erythromycin is also the established standard therapy for legionellosis; it is often recommended as an alternative therapy in pneumococcal pneumonia, notably in patients allergic to penicillin; and macrolides, but not~-lactams, are active against C. trachomatis resulting in pneumonia in infants, and are used as an alternative to tetracycline in the treatment of Chlamydia psittaci infections. In addition, macrolides are probably effective in the newly recognized infections caused by C. pneumoniae. Erythromycin or its derivatives, therefore, are recommended as empirical therapy for community-acquired pneumonia in normal hosts [35] , especially when the clinical background corresponds to a 'viral-like illness' or if legionnaire's disease is suspected or proven. In some cases, a~-lac tam such as ampicillin or amoxycillin-clavulanate is combined with the macrolide. Complications can arise in certain patient groups, e.g. patients of advanced age (especially if staying in nursing homes) or those with an underlying disease that changes the aetiological considerations, in which case Gramnegative bacteria, including Klebsiella pneumoniae, H. injluenzae or even Pseudomonas aeruginosa, become a significant risk and the macroIides are not recommended. In addition, in any patient with clinical signs and symptoms that are highly suggestive of pneumococcal pneumonia, penicillin G should be used provided the patient is not allergic to the drug.",

Since macrolides only poorly penetrate the cerebrospinal fluid, it is probably not advisable to use them as single antimicrobial agents in such cases. Of course, this observation is not valid in legionellosis, which can be extremely severe but is rarely complicated with meningitis. Macrolides are not recommended in severe staphylococcal infections due to limited bactericidal potency. S59 Specific H. influenzae infections Most ofthe studies presented here describe empirical therapy of respiratory infections, but in some patients H. injluenzae is formally recognized or highly suspected as being the invasive pathogen (e.g. acute epiglottitis in a young child). In general, macrolides possess marginal potency against H. influenzae, with MIC 9 0s typically of 4 or 8 mg/l and, thus, cannot be recommended. In contrast, p-Iactams or quinolones are more active and have good clinical records in this setting. Multiple studies, however, involving the use of macrolides, especially the newer compounds, against various respiratory tract infections including diseases where H. injluenzae was recognized as the pathogen responsible after initiation of therapy have shown good efficacy. So the use of macrolides as empirical antimicrobial therapy can assure an acceptable coverage of H. injluenzae infections. The 14-hydroxy metabolite of c1arithromycin and overall azithromycin (typical MIC 9 0s: 0.5-2 mg/l) possess improved activity against H. injluenzae compared with the other drugs of the group, but it is presently considered that further clinical studies specifically addressing this problem are required for a definitive opinion on the clinical benefit of this enhanced potency.",
