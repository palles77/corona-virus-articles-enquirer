Airflows induced by door opening motion and healthcare worker passage can, however, transport the potentially pathogen laden air across the doorway. In this study airflow patterns across the isolation room doorway induced by the operation of single hinged and sliding doors with simulated human passage were examined. Smoke visualizations demonstrated that the hinged door opening generated a greater flow across the doorway than the sliding door. Tracer gas measurements showed that the examined ventilation rates (6 and 12 air changes per hour) had only a small effect on the air volume exchange across the doorway with the hinged door. The results were more variable with the sliding door. Supply-exhaust flow rate differential reduced the door motion-induced air transfer significantly with both door types. The experiments showed that the passage induced substantial air volume transport through the doorway with both door types. However, overall, the sliding door performed better in all tested scenarios, because the door-opening motion itself generated relatively smaller air volume exchange across the doorway, and hence should be the preferred choice in the design of isolation rooms.",

The negative pressure in negative pressure isolation rooms draws the air towards the isolation room in order to minimise the leakage of potentially contaminated air into surrounding areas. However, the situation can be disrupted by many factors which can lead to containment failure [9, 10] , including: the opening of the doors themselves, which cancels or even reverses the negative pressure between the rooms, allowing the escape of potentially contaminated air through the open doorway [11] ; the passage of healthcare workers through the doorway, which increases the airflow through the doorway as moving body creates a wake in which air and contaminants can be transported over long distances [12e16], e.g. out of isolation room [17e20] . It has been estimated that the combined effect of door opening and passage may be among the most important factors causing containment failures in isolation rooms [9, 10] .",

For instance, some earlier studies have shown that the usage of sliding doors can reduce the airflow out of the isolation rooms compared to hinged doors [17, 35] . On the other hand, it has been argued also that there are no significant differences on the isolation efficiency [36] or on the air volume migration generated by the operation the two door types [18] . However, more recent studies have shown experimentally that sliding doors can reduce the air exchange through the doorway [19, 20] . Nevertheless, more evidence and data are needed on the range of door-opening-induced flows with and without passage under realistic isolation room conditions (e.g. ventilation rates, supply-exhaust flow rate differential etc.) to clarify the differences between sliding and hinged doors.",

The manikin was 1.7 m tall and was wearing a laboratory robe to simulate the outfit of hospital staff. The manikin was fixed to a small cart (on wheels) moving along a rail running on the floor between the two rooms (see Fig. 2 ). The movements of the manikin and the door were controlled by the same computer program, making the synchronization of the door movements and manikin passage easier and repeatable throughout the experiments. Fig. 3 shows the details of the door and manikin movement cycles. Initially, the manikin stood in the middle of a room. As the cycle began, the manikin accelerated rapidly to full-speed (1 m/s), approached the door and stopped in front of it. After the door had opened completely, the manikin moved through the doorway into the other room. The manikin stopped at the center of the other room and following a short wait the door closed behind the manikin after which the moving cycle was considered to be over. In each examined case the door opened in 3 s, stayed fully open for 8 s and closed in 5.4 s. The hold-open time was set long enough for the manikin to pass through the doorway avoiding crashing with the door. During the hinged door experiments the manikin halted slightly further away from the door (while approaching it from the isolation room side) to avoid collision with the sweeping door. Otherwise, the door-manikin movement cycles were similar for the experiments with both door types.",

Although there have been efforts to locate the ideal positions of the supply and exhaust registers the optimal setting is still somewhat unclear [37, 38] . One suggested choice is top-supply-top-exhaust [5, 6, 38] and hence it was decided to install a radial supply air diffusers in the ceiling at the center of the rooms and rectangular exhaust grilles (280 mm \u00c2 180 mm) up on the wall close to the ceiling next to the dividing wall in both rooms (see Fig. 1 for details). The diffuser outlet section pointing towards the doorway was blocked in order to avoid direct flow to door as this might severely affect the doorway flows possibly increasing the risk for containment failures. Two air change rates (based on exhaust flow rates) were used in the study, 6 and 12 ACH (corresponding flow rates being 94 and 188 L/s). Supply air temperature was set the same in both rooms resulting in~22 C room temperature. The supply and exhaust airflow rates and the pressure difference between the rooms were monitored and measured with Swema 3000 multi-purpose instrument (Swema, Sweden). Calibrated orifices were installed to the supply and exhaust ducts for accurate airflow rate measurement. The accuracy for airflow rate measurement was \u00b14 L/s and for pressure \u00b10.3 Pa. The room temperatures were monitored continuously with thermometers (Craftemp thermistors, Craftemp, Sweden, \u00b10.2 C accuracy) located at 1 m and 2.6 m above the floor in each room.",

Negative pressure was created by an imbalance between the supply and exhaust flow rates. However, the pressure difference between the rooms disappears when the doorway is open, leaving only the supply-exhaust flow rate differential effective between the rooms. This imbalance (between the anteroom and the isolation room) induces a net flow through the open doorway towards the isolation room (see Fig. 4 for illustration of the concept). Hence, it was decided to characterize the experimental conditions in terms of the supply-exhaust flow rate differential between the rooms, rather than using the pressure difference which is not effective during the door opening. A~20 L/s flow rate difference between the rooms was measured during the door operation (resulting in~20 Pa pressure difference between the rooms while doors were closed).

Fig. 6 shows the anteroom (i.e. Room 1 in Fig. 1 ) side-view of the single hinged door-generated airflow patterns. Fig. 6b shows that the door motion induces significant airflow through the doorway. Fig. 6c illustrates that the door-generated flow severely masks the wake behind the moving manikin. However, Fig. 6d shows that a notable amount of air is dragged in the wake which can be seen moving past the now stationary manikin. The door motion does not seem to cause any significant air movements in the anteroom while closing (Fig. 6e) . The smoke is spread and mixed (partly vanishing from the lit section) due to effective ventilation (Fig. 6f ). Fig. 7 shows the anteroom top-view of the single hinged doorinduced airflow patterns. Fig. 7b shows that the smoke penetrates far into the room. From this viewpoint, the wake behind the manikin is masked by the door motion-induced airflow (Fig. 7c) . However, Fig. 7d shows that a notable amount of air is carried in the wake and can be seen to move past the now stationary manikin. The door motion does not seem to cause any significant airflows while closing (Fig. 7e) . Again, the smoke is spread inside the room due to ventilation and partly vanishes from the lit section (Fig. 7f ). Fig. 8 shows the isolation room (i.e. Room 2 in Fig. 1 ) side-view of the single hinged door-induced airflow patterns. The sweeping door drags notable amount of the anteroom air into the isolation room (Fig. 8b ). Fig. 8c shows that the wake is coupled with the doorinduced flow and difficult to distinguish. Nevertheless, in Fig. 8d a significant amount of smoke can be seen to flow past the stopped manikin. The sweeping door seems to induce air movement by pushing the air towards the viewer while closing (Fig. 8e) . After the door has closed the smoke disperses into the room and is mixed throughout the room partly vanishing from the lit section (Fig. 8f ). Fig. 9 shows the isolation room top-view of the single hinged door-generated airflow patterns. Fig. 9b shows that the sweeping door forms a vortex. The effect of the moving manikin cannot be distinguished from the door motion induced flow (Fig. 9c) . However, after the manikin has stopped some of the air can be seen flowing past it (Fig. 9d) . The closing door pushes the air towards the right corner of the room (Fig. 9e ). Fig. 9f shows that the air is spread around the room (and partly disappears from the lit section). Fig. 10 shows the anteroom side-view of the sliding doorgenerated airflow patterns. The door-opening induces only modest flow through the doorway (Fig. 10b) . The wake behind the moving manikin can now be seen clearly (Fig. 10c) . The manikin drags significant amount of air with it to the anteroom, which can be seen flowing past it after it has stopped (Fig. 10d) . The sliding door does not seem to generate any notable air movements across the doorway while closing (Fig. 10e) . The smoke is quickly mixed across the room partly vanishing from the lit section (Fig. 10f) . Fig. 11 shows the anteroom top-view of the sliding doorgenerated airflow patterns. Fig. 11b shows that the induced airflow is modest also in horizontal direction. The wake behind the moving manikin can be seen clearly (Fig. 11c) . The manikin drags substantial amount of air with it to the anteroom (Fig. 11d) . The door motion does not generate notable air movements in the doorway while closing (Fig. 11e) . The air is spread around the room partly disappearing from the lit section as seen from Fig. 11f . Only anteroom visualizations for the sliding door are shown as the flow patterns were essentially similar on both sides of the doorway. ",

In principle, increasing ventilation rates can generate more turbulence which in turn can enhance the mixing across the open doorway [41] . However, it should be noted that in general, increased ventilation rates improve the containment as the concentration of particles and gaseous agents are more quickly diluted already in an isolation room [21, 38] .

Also the smoke visualizations shown here illustrate that the opening induce fast and swirling flow across the doorway. High momentum supply air can generate high air velocities in the room and around the doorway as well. In the experiments, however, the section of the supply air terminal towards the doorway was blocked and thus the air movements caused by the supply air jet were assumed to be only modest close to the door. Hence it seems like the hinged door motion itself creates strong mixing which dominates or at least delays the onset of the ventilation generated effects in the doorway (with the examined ventilation rates at least). The sliding door motion induced airflow seemed to be rather modest and hence the air velocities (and turbulence) in the doorway might be dominated by the ventilation flows. Thus the onset of the ventilation generated mixing across the doorway is not severely delayed by the sliding door opening motion and hence can result in increased air exchange through the doorway (seen well with 12 ACH in this study). However, this should be confirmed in the future with additional measurements with complementary ventilation rates.",

For instance, Adams et al. [28] and Mousavi and Grosskopf [32] have pointed out that pressure difference significantly reduces the aerosol transfer through the doorway during hinged door operation. However, only few have estimated or measured the effect of flow rate differentials for both hinged and sliding doors. For instance, Shaw [17] found that 0.30 m 3 /s excess flow for sliding door (with 1 C temperature difference across the doorway) would be needed to reduce the transfer close to zero (however, no data were reported for hinged door). Later, Hayden et al. [18] observed that flow rate differential was the only parameter (of the examined variables) significantly affecting the air volume migration through the isolation room doorway generated by hinged and sliding doors. They estimated that flow rate differential of c. 0.36 m 3 /s (c. 0.26 m 3 /s) would be enough to decrease the air transfer through the doorway to close to zero during hinged (sliding) door operation.",

However, one should note that in practice the door motion-induced flow can penetrate far into the rooms (especially with hinged door) and might not be directed back through the doorway (while open) but will stay in the room. Besides, maintaining high flow rate differentials constantly requires controlled leakage and elevated ventilation rates and thus is not energy efficient. More practical solutions should be considered instead. One solution would be to increase the flow rate differential temporarily during door operation only. Kim and Augenbroe [43] suggested realizing this by adaptive VAV (variable air volume) method normally keeping a low flow rate differential but capable of increasing it to higher values prior and during door operation. This kind of method sounds promising but more detailed studies are required to define how feasible these kinds of applications are in a real hospital environment.",

However, Hayden et al. [18] and Kokkonen et al. [25] did not find any significant effect of the passage direction on the air volume migration across the isolation room doorway when realistic ventilation rates were used. Fig. 14 shows that for the hinged door the exit seems to generate greater air volume migration than entry with 6 ACH. However, with 12 ACH the induced air exchange appeared to be independent of the passage direction. Hence it seems like airflows generated by the 12 ACH ventilation rate are strong enough to cancel the effect of passage direction. With the sliding door this appeared to be insignificant with both ventilation rates. Thus it seems that at least high ventilation rates can mask the effect of moving direction.",

On the other hand, Kiel and Wilson [54] found out the typical exchange volume (for hinged door) to be only around 50% of the swept volume. Kalliom\u20ac aki et al.

Finally and most convincingly, Shaw [17] , who is one of the few who has measured the amount of air dragged behind a real person moving between a treatment room and an associated lobby in a hospital setting, found the effect of passage to be 0.29 m 3 during fast walk.

However, more detailed studies are needed in order to define the effect of room size explicitly. Nevertheless, the anteroom should be utilized correctly to fulfill its contaminant dispersion prevention potential. For example, the doors should always be interlocked so that only one of the doors can be open at a time. Also, the anteroom should not be shared with another isolation room or rooms. Hang et al.
