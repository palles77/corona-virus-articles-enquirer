We suggest that the evolution of some MHV N sequences resulted from a double recombination phenomenon between two ancestors.

In a first step, we verified by PAUP [22] that the N sequences of viruses infecting the same species (mouse, pig, and cattle) were clustered together on the tree. We chose one sequence for pig and cattle viruses and two for MHV (MHV 1 and 3), the most distant ones. For avian and turkey viruses and among human viruses which are not closely related on the tree, individual sequences were used. The phylogenetic tree of the various N proteins constructed by the parsimony method is shown in Fig. 3 A, while the cladogram of birds and mammals based on morphological characters [12] is provided in Fig. 3 B. First, we found that human OC 43, bovine, and turkey enteric coronaviruses give a monophyletic group. The distances between these 3 viruses were smaller than between MHVs. Second, porcine and feline viruses were more closely related than their respective hosts. The same analysis was performed on protein M sequences of the same coronaviruses (when available) and an identical most parsimonious tree was obtained (data not shown).",

The smallest one was also detected in other MHV N sequences [13] , although these ORF are shorter (207 aa). The only exception is for the MHV JHM sequence in which a premature stop codon is found. This hypothetical protein has not yet been detected. The longer ORF which codes for the nucleocapsid protein presents a discrepancy between the calculated and estimated molecular mass which could be explained by post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation of serine residues, which account for 8.5% of total amino acids. Phosphorylation of MHV nucleoproteins has been described [19] . We showed that the nucleotide sequences of gene N of 2 viruses which were classified under the name MHV 3 are different. The N gene of the virus used in our laboratory (Mill Hill strain) seemed original by comparison with the MHV3 PM [13-] which is almost identical to MHV A59. The identity of these 2 sequences could be explained by genetic recombination between the 3' termini of MHV 3 and A 59 genomes leading to a common N gene. Such recombination processes have been observed among laboratory strains ofmurine coronaviruses, under special laboratory conditions [5, 8, 11] . Alternative hypotheses can also be considered such as a mixture of viruses in the infected animal from which MHV 3 was first isolated or a mixture of the two strains in the cultured cells. The junctions of the putative recombination events would be between positions 254 and 260 and between positions 11.49-1194, as indicated by the dashed lines in Fig. 2 . It is interesting to note that a three domain structure for the nucleoprotein has been suggested, with spacers A (positions 420 to 486) and B (positions 1143 to 1215) defined as hot spots of variability between domains [13] . Spacer B corresponds to the second putative recombination region that we have identified, but spacer A is not located within the first recombination region. If instead of comparing nucleotide sequences, we converted the sequence into amino acids, very little information appears since most nucleotide informative positions were silent at the amino acid level (only 6 informative positions remain at the amino acid level).",

The M and N genes are located next to each other and it would have been better to use 2 distant genes, one at the beginning of the genomic RNA, the N gene being located at the 3' end, but the sequences are not all available.
