The Alberta Real Time Syndromic Surveillance Net (ARTSSN) was developed with three goals: 1) improve upon traditional paperbased, fragmented public health surveillance using a centralized automated system; 2) enhance routine public health surveillance through effective use of existing Provincial Electronic Health Record data for earlier detection of cases, clusters, outbreaks and trends of communicable disease, injury, and environmental hazard exposure; and 3) track the effectiveness of public health interventions. This paper describes ARTSSN and the lessons learned in its development as a real-world application of syndromic surveillance.",

Automation minimizes interruptions to real-time surveillance even during the most resource-challenging conditions like pH1N1 2009 (Figure 1 ). Each ED visit or HL call about influenza-like illness (ILI) or laboratoryconfirmed pH1N1 case is automatically acquired by the data repository and updated on online dashboards for timely understanding of the pandemic progressing in the community. The information is then relayed to Emergency Operation Centres to inform their pandemic responses. Real-time information also enables ED managers to promptly re-allocate patient care and infection prevention and control resources based on ED patient flow, punctually intervene in screening ILI patients and significantly improve ILI data quality. The pH1N1 2009 experience demonstrates that ARTSSN is truly useful to both the data user and provider. 19 Real-time surveillance reduces recall bias and improves interpretation of statistical associations since immediate temporal, spatial and population connections are possible as events are unfolding ( Figure 2 ). Real-time surveillance in ARTSSN gives public health practitioners a new tool to survey injury, environmental hazard exposure, chronic and communicable disease comprehensively for improved and targeted health protection and promotion.",
