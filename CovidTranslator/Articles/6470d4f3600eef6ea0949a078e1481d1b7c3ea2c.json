SAFV-1 was first defined in 2007 having been the putative cause of fever of unknown origin in a child in 1981. 1 SAFVs include an approximately 8 kb positive-sense single-stranded RNA genome (Fig. 1 ). Since the first definition, SAFV-2, 2 SAFV-3, 3 SAFV-4-SAFV-8 4 and SAFV-9 5 have been described along with a suggestion that more genotypes remain to be characterised. 6 Cell culture is in general known to be an inefficient method of routine virus detection but it can be used for study of SAFV. The SAFVs are predicted to encode a single polyprotein and in silico analysis suggest that a classical picornavirus post-translational proteolytic cleavage pattern ensues (Fig. 1) .",

Other SAFV detections have been made in the nasopharynx of patients with tonsillitis, 10,11 pharyngitis, 11 herpangina 11 and in cerebrospinal fluid specimens. [12] [13] [14] These are often accompanied by fever, cough and rhinorrhoea. Currently, SAFVs are described as orphan viruses lacking a consensus disease association 15, 16 despite >90% of the population having serological evidence of past exposure. 15 It is therefore important to examine a range of disease states for this ubiquitous virus, to establish a link between detection and illness. The first step is the development of assays that can detect viral variants and their implementation by others.",

Its design was based on all publicly available 5 UTR sequences (alignments included known SAFV-1, 2, 3, 5, 6 genotypes and a range of unclassified SAFV sequences prepared in Geneious Pro 5.6. Defined SAFV-4, 7-9 5 UTRs remain absent from public databases). The newly developed SAFV RT-rtPCR employed 0.4 M of each oligonucleotide primer (TIB-MOLBIOL, Germany; Table 1 ) and 0.1 M of each dual-labelled fluorogenic oligoprobe (SAFV TM) in a 20 L one-step RT-PCR reaction mix (SensiFAST OneStep Mix, Bioline, Australia) including RNase inhibitor and 5 mM MgCl 2 . After 2 L of nucleic acid extract was added and reverse transcribed for 20 min at 45 \u2022 C, the mixes were incubated at 94 \u2022 C for 2 min then cycled through 55 rounds of 94 \u2022 C for 15 s and 60 \u2022 C for 60 s using a RotorGene 3000, 6000 or RGQ (QIAGEN, Australia) to acquire fluorescence data at the final (annealing and extension) step of each cycle. Assay sensitivity was determined using a specific in vitro transcribed RNA (ivtRNA; Fig. 1 , Table 1 ) created based on a previously described approach. 17 Briefly, ivtRNA was subjected to two treatments with DNase (Turbo, Life Technologies), each followed by column purification (ISOLATE RNA Mini Kit, Bioline). The stock RNA was used to determine the analytical sensitivity of each assay after testing a 10-fold dilution series. The last dilution to yield a positive result (defined below) was taken as the limit of analytical sensitivity. The ivtRNA copy number was calculated using the optical density to approximate the mass of RNA in the stock solution at 260 nm, determining the number of moles by establishing the molecular weight of the ivtRNA and then multiplying by 6.02 \u00d7 10 23 (Avogadro's number). A positive diagnostic result was defined by the presence of a sigmoidal curve that crossed an arbitrary threshold of 0.05, before 45 cycles, during an experiment in which duplicate non-template controls did not cross the threshold.",

The assay's analytical sensitivity was between 40 and 100 RNA copies per 20 L reaction and the assay was linear across a 10 log 10 dynamic range (Fig. 3) . The RT-rtPCR identified 8 distinct cases of SAFV. Most cases had fever reported on presentation; one case (QPID11-0005) had coinciding sore throat, headache, neck stiffness, diarrhoea and vomiting. Five cases were able to be genotyped (four SAFV-2s and a SAFV-3; GenBank Accession numbers JQ820263-JQ820267) and three were not. The latter may have been related to mismatches we observed between the VP1 primers and some SAFV genotypes or lower viral loads (all T7 RNA polymerase promoter region-underlined; S/AS -sense/antisense primers; S1/AS1 -round 1 sense/antisense primer set; S2/AS2 -round 2 sense/antisense, nested primer set. typed specimens had C T values \u226433 while the three untypeable specimens had C T values >33). No SAFV detections were made from winter or spring (May-December; Fig. 2 ). Most (n = 6; 75%) of the SAFV-positive specimens were from children two years of age or younger; an age group that comprised 39.2% of the entire specimen population. Specimens from this age group were 3.9 times as likely as those from older patients to be positive for SAFV but the risk failed to attain statistical significance (1.2% vs 0.4%, RR 3.6, 95% CI 0.66-25.4, p = 0.152). Specimens from males were 1.5 times as likely as those from females to be positive for SAFV (0.9% vs 0.6%, RR 1.5, 95% CI 0.3-7.7, p = 0.73). Over half of SAFV detections (n = 5; 62.5%) were in the presence of another virus (0.8% vs 0.7%, RR 1.159, 95% CI 0.244-6.087, p = 1.00). Similar or greater numbers of SAFV detections were made than of influenza C virus (n = 1), HPIV-1 (n = 9), HPIV-2 (n = 4), coronavirus 229E/HKU1 (n = 0), NL63 (n = 3), or HPIV-4 (n = 9) detections were apparent.",

This assay will be an important tool in augmenting the culture, serological, Fig. 3 . Dynamic range and sensitivity (y-intercept) of the SAFV RT-rtPCR when the threshold cycle (CT) is plotted against log10 of the initial ivtRNA copy number. Each ivtRNA dilution was amplified on three distinct occasions each time using a fresh dilution of ivtRNA stock and each dilution was tested in triplicate. Error bars represent +/\u2212 one standard deviation. conventional or SYBR green RT-rt PCR methods that have underpinned most SAFV detections to date. The assay's performance on SAFV genotypes lacking 5 UTR sequence on public databases or with undefined 5 UTR sequences that may represent these types (SAFV-4, 7-9), remains to be evaluated. Other SAFV RT-rtPCRs designed for broad reactivity only identified a single SAFV type circulating in the CSF of children 13 or contain some mismatches 3 which our assay sought to minimise. It may be that certain SAFV genotypes impart a tissue-specific pathogenicity, but much more research will be required to investigate this theory. Commonly, use of PCR documents one or no SAFV genotypes in the airways, 3, 10, 11, 19 our assay concurrently identified both SAFV-2 and SAFV-3 in the airways of children during 2011. We believe this assay is likely to detect all SAFVs with characterised 5 UTRs and will permit better understanding of the role of SAFVs in human disease.",
