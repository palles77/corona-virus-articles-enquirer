However, irrational antibiotic using has also become a common issue worldwide [1] [2] [3] , which has resulted in a rise and exacerbation of antibiotic resistance, and leading to a decline in clinical efficacy and an increase in adverse reactions. Irrational antibiotic use has presented an enormous challenge to infection control in hospitals. The World Health Organization (WHO) considers \"bacterial resistance\" to be one of the healthcare issues that is severely threatening to human life. Similarly, China is also facing a large threat from antibiotic use [4] [5] [6] . To enhance the management of antimicrobial agents, the Ministry of Health (MOH) of the People's Republic of China released the \"Nationwide Special Campaign for Antibiotic Stewardship Program (ASP) 2011\" and conducted a specific rectification of irrational antibiotic use in China [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] . In this study, we investigated and analyzed the changes in relevant indicators in antibiotic use in 41 medical organizations (19 tertiary hospitals and 22 secondary hospitals) between 2011 and 2013 in an attempt to evaluate the effectiveness of specific activities in the control of antibiotic use in secondary and tertiary hospitals in Tianjin, China.",

In addition, nosocomial infections and infectious outbreaks in general hospitals were monitored via antibiotic use and resistance surveillance networks. Prescriptions and medical orders were identified by computer-assisted electronic prescription systems through integration of clinical patient data, basic medication information, and the pathogen spectrum of infection.
