They believed that cleanliness would lead to good health and made links between causes of disease and methods of prevention. For example, during this time an association was made between the increased death rate of persons living near swamps and sewage, and as a result the Roman Empire began working on two major public health projects in sanitation control: the building of aqueducts to supply clean water to the city and a sewage system to eliminate waste from the streets. Today, the benefits of public health infrastructure in the United States and abroad continue to strengthen the well-being of society. The impact of interventions has been great. In the past century , the 10 greatest public health achievements have been documented as the following 1 :",

Recognition of tobacco use as a health hazard Public health is founded on the efforts of a society to protect, promote, and restore the health of its citizens. Public health programs and services emphasize the prevention of disease and administration of health needs to the population as an entity, versus the study and treatment of a single patient, as is found in the discipline of medicine.Today, public health is defined as \"the science and the art of preventing disease, prolonging life, and promoting physical health and mental health and efficiency through organized community efforts . . . and the development of the social machinery to ensure to every individual in the community a standard of living adequate for the maintenance of health.\" 2 The mission of public health is to fulfill society's desire to create conditions so that people can be healthy. Public health is divided into the staple pillars of assessment, policy development, and assurance. 3 All three of these pillars are interdependent and cyclical. Two functions address the issues of assessment: (1) monitor health and (2) diagnose and investigate. Under policy development are the functions (1) inform, educate, empower; (2) mobilize community partnerships; and (3) develop policies. The following functions define assurance: (1) link to and/or provide care, (2) ensure a competent workforce, and (3) evaluate. 3 Like traditional programs in public health, ranging from maternal and reproductive health to injury control and prevention, the public health response to disasters also fulfills the same basic tenets of assessment, policy development, and assurance. This chapter introduces the reader to how public health integrates into disaster preparedness and response systems by highlighting some specific subjects relevant to those tenets. It will cover topics like the public health disaster response cycle, policies in disaster response, the provision of disaster medical services, as well as worker safety and epidemiological/data issues (Figure 1-1 ).",

Public health seeks to mitigate hazards such as explosions, chemical exposures, natural disasters like floods and earthquakes, and infectious disease, as well as reducing vulnerabilities of the infrastructure such as weak assets, resources, personnel, and science. One form of mitigation may be hardening structures against blast, but also can be the placement of surveillance systems to increase early detection of infectious diseases in a hospital setting, for example. Today, these systems, as well as reporting parameters, are being put into place across the country to both recognize and protect populations from a bioterrorism event. Early warning offers the benefit of a rapid response and reduction in morbidity and mortality.",

This phase should also include the participation in tabletop and functional exercises. Public health personnel must be integrated and participate with other response agencies during drills and exercises to better familiarize each stakeholder with their respective roles and abilities.

Furthermore, recovery efforts comprise several components, some of which are Search and Rescue (SAR) in the case of an earthquake, bombing, or landslide; reinstitution of medical services if clinics and hospitals are destroyed; and establishment of corrupted lifelines like sanitation, electricity, and water. Those affected by the horrendous Tsunami disaster-that killed hundreds of thousands in Indonesia,Thailand,India,and so many other nations-demonstrated the international public health relief operation: an extreme example of multilateral, global relief spanning commercial and government sectors.The recovery from this disaster is ongoing and likely will last several years.",

Thirteen people were trapped and 6 died from LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH RESPONSE TO THE WORST TERRORIST ATTACK IN U.S. HISTORY On Sept. 11, 2001, two commercial jets that were hijacked by terrorists crashed into the two towers of the World Trade Center in New York City. Within 90 minutes, both 110-story towers had collapsed. The New York State Department of Health (NYS DOH) had pre-established Emergency Operations Center committees that came together and began working within 30 minutes of the attack. NYS DOH nursing staff assisted in triaging and treating injured persons at an emergency triage center. In collaboration with the American Red Cross, the DOH also provided nursing staff for emergency shelters that housed displaced residents. Within the disaster site and surrounding commu-nity, DOH performed environmental monitoring. With losses in power and water as well as having tons of airborne contaminants in the area, DOH had its hands full with monitoring both the general public and emergency responders in addition to performing its daily activities. The DOH regularly sent faxes, e-mail alerts, and press releases containing urgent public health information and/or concerns to local hospitals and physicians. The DOH designed and implemented a rescue and recovery worker-safety plan. Additionally, the DOH initiated four disease and injury surveillance systems after the disaster, with assistance from the CDC. mudslides in La Conchita, California; and a train disaster in Graniteville, South Carolina released concentrated chlorine fumes, leading to 9 deaths and 250 hospitalizations. Finally, in the fall of 2005 Hurricane Katrina devastated the Gulf coast of the United States, resulting in the flooding and complete evacuation of New Orleans. Although these disasters are not on the same scale in terms of death, injury, social loss, and destruction as the tsunami, they still maintain criteria that classify them as disasters.",

Bioterrorist response, for example, involves an enormous breadth of players and their respective functions. 9 The DHHS alone elicits responses from its agencies: the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality ( 9 Different agencies function to deliver services to varying target audiences. For example, the target audiences of the CDC are state and local health agencies. In terms of activities, the CDC provides grants, technical support, and performance standards to support preparedness and response planning for bioterrorism; chemical and radiological incidents; natural disasters; and terrorist incidents, such as explosions, that may yield significant physical trauma. 9 The OEP enhances medical response capabilities, such as early identification of a biologic incident, mass prophylaxis, mass casualty care, and mass fatality management. 9 Its target audiences are local jurisdictions, including fire and police departments, emergency medical services (EMS), hospitals, and public health agencies. 9 The DOJ helps states develop strategic plans and funds training, the obtaining of equipment, and the planning of drills and exercises for fire, law enforcement, emergency medical and hazardous response (HazMat) teams, hospitals, and public health departments. 9 FEMA supports state emergency management agencies by providing grant assistance to sustain local-consequence management planning, training, and exercises for all disasters, including biological incidents. 9 For example, FEMA, with the U.S. Army, conducts the Chemical Stockpile Emergency Preparedness Program (CSEPP) and the Radiological Emergency Preparedness (REP) program. 12 The goal of CSEPP is to improve preparedness in the event of an accident involving U.S. stockpiles of obsolete chemical munitions. 12 The REP carries out exercises to ensure that residents living around nuclear power plants are safe and prepared in case of a disaster.",

            "text": "A biologic attack could result in the infection thousands of people without any indication in the first few hours of how many people are infected. 16 For example, one hypothetical scenario depicted a national and global spread of smallpox, resulting in 15,000 cases and 2000 deaths. 17 It is therefore recommended to provide mass prophylaxis to the population-the use of antibiotics being the primary key to survival for most people. 16 Some believe that vaccines are not the first line of defense against biological threats but can be used for control of a smallpox epidemic, prophylaxis against anthrax in combination with antibiotics, control of global pandemic infections, and pre-exposure prophylaxis for high-risk workers in laboratory and health care environments. 18 Because most public health departments, hospitals, and local institutions lack the amount of drugs needed for a national emergency, federal medical resources are available through the Strategic National Stockpile (SNS), formerly named the National Pharmaceutical Stockpile (NPS). After institution of the Homeland Security Act of 2002, the DHS and CDC began to jointly manage the SNS, with the DHS defining the goals and performance requirements of the program and being responsible for administering the actual deployment of the 12-hour push package. 19 The cache of medical supplies includes antibiotics, chemical antidotes, antitoxins, life support medications, intravenous administration and airway maintenance supplies, and medical/surgical items that can be delivered in the event of a national emergency within 12 hours to strategically designated warehouses across the United States and its territories. 19 The SNS is not meant to be a first response tool but rather to augment and restock existing state and local health agencies' medical supplies. The SNS program conducts quarterly quality assurance checks, rotates materials, performs a full annual inventory of all package items, and regularly inspects environmental conditions, security, and overall package maintenance. 19 Deployment of the SNS is made when the state governor's office directly requests assets from the CDC or DHS. 19 Once the SNS cache has been delivered, several key steps must be taken to effectively use it: officially receive the supplies and unload them; have adequate personnel for packaging, distributing, dispensing, tracking, and storing the supplies; have the local public health department assign dosages; and provide communication and security. 16 There are additional public health issues beyond these logistics that should be taken into account when distributing mass prophylaxis to the public. They include dividing the population into groups who require medication first, a step that is politically sensitive and should be decided before a biologic attack happens. 16 Also, public health personnel should be ready to distribute clear agentspecific and drug information, to make available multilingual staff and handouts, to handle the needs of special populations, to provide personal protective equipment (PPE) for people at staffing and dispensing centers, and to provide security in case of crowd panic. 16 Disasters cause various patterns of injury and disease, ranging from blast injuries by a terrorist bombing to ventilatory failure from the chemical release of a nerve agent. As a result, responses significantly vary in terms of how widespread the response is (local to international), which personnel are used to respond, the duration of the response, and what medical management must be used to treat those affected or exposed.",

Such responses may vary in location and size. However, natural disasters, such as hurricanes, call for a different type of medical response altogether, in which medical problems seem to arise out of environmental hazards resulting from the natural disaster's aftermath. For instance, injuries and deaths occur because victims fail to evacuate and take shelter, do not take precautions in securing property, and do not follow guidelines for food and water safety or injury prevention during the recovery phase. 20 Injuries from a hurricane can result from near-drowning; electrocution; lacerations from flying debris; blunt trauma or bone fractures from falling trees and other heavy objects; stress-related disorders; heart attacks; gastrointestinal, respiratory, vector-borne, and skin diseases; toxic poisoning; fires; bites from displaced wild animals, such as animals and snakes; and even improper use of mechanical equipment, such as chain saws and power tools. 20 Chemical and radiological incidents have more specific medical issues, including the recognition of patterns of injury, prophylaxis, and antidotes. Managing a volume of exposed patients in a limited healthcare environment can be challenging and can include issues of decontamination; on-site prehospital management; transportation; the use of PPE; and treatment of patterns of injury specifically associated with chemical and radiological sequelae, such as skin lesions, blisters and burns, nervous system disorders, inhalational injuries, and acute radiation syndrome.

Facilities with backup generators were able to continue operations, but only sparingly. In the United States, three people died as a result of the blackout and one firefighter was injured. In Ottawa, a teenager died from fire-related injuries and another person died after being hit by a car. In New York during the 30-hour period of no electricity, 3000 fires were reported, mainly from people using candles, and EMS personnel responded to 80,000 calls to 911, double the average. 22 On the other hand, finite, sudden disasters causing immediate injury and mortality (such as terrorist bombings, transportation disasters, and building collapses) require a more robust response capacity at a local and perhaps regional level.This differs from the national and sometimes international assistance required after largescale natural disasters that affect vast regions of terrain, as was seen in the case of the 2004 tsunami disaster, as well as in several instances of floods, hurricanes, and even complex humanitarian emergencies overseas. In the case of an explosion, trauma systems must be equipped and ready to accept incoming patients, manage the bulk of patients with minor wounds who will flood the nearest hospital, and prepare for possibly unexpected rates of casualty flow. Physicians should be prepared to treat hundreds of trauma patients, which may be complicated by loss of utilities, difficulty in reaching hospitals, or possible damage to hospital facilities. 23 The physically injured from high-energy disasters, such as earthquakes, tornadoes, or explosions, will most likely be treated at regional trauma centers for severe injuries. In the United States, there are 600 regional trauma centers. 24 They coordinate EMS, including paramedics and air medical transport. A regional trauma center is composed of paramedics and emergency medical technicians (EMTs) who transport injured victims to trauma teams that include a trauma surgeon, emergency physician, several trauma nurses, and specialized personnel. Up to 16 physicians in various specialties, from neurosurgery to obstetrics, comprise a trauma team ready to receive injured patients in the operating room and critical care unit. 24 For disease outbreaks, the provision of medical services and public health capabilities is considerably great and involves a large network of local to sometimes international response. When severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) made its way onto the global front as a highly threatening disease in November 2002, it crippled the Asian healthcare system and brought to light serious questions about the U.S. public health system's ability to respond to a similar crisis at home. SARS had the greatest impact on Asian countries, with 7782 cases and 729 deaths, challenging Asian healthcare systems, adversely affecting Asian economies, and testing the effectiveness of international health codes. 25 SARS is part of the coronavirus family. Within 2 to 10 days after infection, the affected person can develop symptoms including cough, fever, and body aches that are indiscriminate from other respiratory illnesses, appearing as an atypical pneumonia. 25 The fatality rate from SARS is 11% and can be greater than 50% for people older than 65. 25 SARS is a person-to-person transmitted disease that is acquired primarily through direct and indirect contact with respiratory secretions and/or contaminated objects.",

Participants of a tabletop exercise are broad and may include government officials (mayors, city council members, risk manager), public works/utilities personnel (water superintendent, gas company representative), law enforcement (police chief, sheriff), community services (Red Cross representative), emergency management (emergency program manager, National Guard representative), fire department representatives (fire chief, dispatcher), emergency medical/health personnel (emergency medical coordinator, public health official), and public information officers. 12 The tabletop exercise, which commonly includes senior-level officials, prompts participants to discuss how their respective agencies or units might react to a specific set of scenarios, emphasizing higherlevel policy and procedural issues. 12 Unlike full-scale exercises or field exercise drills, such as a hospital disaster simulation in which operations are evaluated on scene and equipment is deployed, tabletop exercises do not involve management of equipment or personnel, but are rather classroom-type exercises held in a classroom setting. 12 Full-scale exercises engage tactics, techniques, and procedures that could be used in an actual incident and are designed to be realistic. 12 In May 2000, May 2003, and most recently May 2005, FEMA led three exercises called the Top Officials (TOPOFF1, TOPOFF2, and TOPOFF3), which were large-scale,\"no-notice\" field drills involving federal, state, and local agencies. TOPOFF1 in 2000 was jointly led by FEMA and DOJ and was conducted in three cities: a biological weapons incident in Denver, Colo., a chemical incident in Portsmouth, N.H., and a mass casualty radiological incident in the Washington, D.C. region. 12 In 2003, the TOPOFF2 4-day drill involved a Radiological Dispersal Device (RDD), or \"dirty bomb,\" release in Seattle, Washington, and a biologic incident involving Yersinia pestis, or Pneumonic Plague, in Chicago. 26 TOPOFF3 was the largest U.S. counter-terrorism exercise to date. It exceeded 10,000 players, and involved 275 federal, state, local, and private organizations, as well as international partners Canada and the United Kingdom, with 13 countries sending representative observers. The exercise simulated a chemical release attack in New London, Connecticut, and a biologic attack in New Jersey.",

Importantly, the sender of information should verify that the transmitted message has been received and understood by the intended audience. When the public heeds the actions and recommendations made by public health officials, those messages have been adequately delivered to the audiences. 20 Experts emphasize that warning messages should not be withheld until the last minute. This has been documented to happen out of fear that panic will overwhelm the public and lead to more deaths and injuries than the actual disaster. 20 Internally among public health systems and partners, secure and redundant lines of communication should be set up during a disaster. These include computers with a CD drive, e-mail capability, continuous online Internet access, and security software to protect sensitive data from intruders. 20 Fixed facilities such as hospitals and health departments should have a standby source of power to operate electrical and communication systems in case a disaster strikes the main source. 20 Communication equipment that has been used for public health response includes radio equipment, such as twoway radios, pagers, broadcast radios, televisions, and satellites; wire lines, such as telephones, facsimile machines, and computer modems; and a combination of both radio and wire lines, including cellular and satellite telephones. 20 However, it is important to realize that in times of disaster, routine communications like these may not be readily available, especially to the public and private sectors. Such was the case in the London Bombings on July 7, 2005, when private businesses found it nearly impossible to access e-mails or make mobile phone calls, as cellular networks were congested from a surge in traffic.",

To characterize unusual levels of activity, the attack rate for the disease in question is compared against that of previous years to measure deviation from the norm. The outbreak can then be characterized in terms of time, place, and person, lending crucial data to determine the origin of the disease. 39 By analyzing data of cases over time, an epidemic curve can be calculated that will allow for differentiation between an outbreak and normal pattern of disease. 39 However, if an intentional release of a biological agent is suspected, time is of the essence, and as previously emphasized, early detection is key. Therefore, the development of surveillance systems, including syndromic surveillance systems and real-time computer models, are being developed. Surveillance \"concentrates on the incidence, prevalence, and severity of illness or injury due to ecological changes, changes in endemic levels of disease, population displacement, loss of usual source of health care, overcrowding, breakdowns in sanitation, disruption of public utilities, monitors increases in communicable diseases, including vector-borne, waterborne, and person-to-person transmission\" and ultimately helps one to determine an association between exposure and outcome, whether that outcome includes specific injuries, illnesses, or death. 20 In setting up a surveillance system, managers should consider using existing systems, such as those used to track reportable diseases, or developing temporary systems to track specific injuries and illnesses before, during, or after the disaster. 20 Primary and secondary sources of data need to be identified and can vary from patient medical records (primary) to victim surveys and interviews (secondary). Primary data collection methods are direct observations or surveys, and secondary methods are interviews with key informants or review of existing records. 20 Data sets can be obtained from numerous places, including state hospitalization data, hospitals and clinics, private providers, insurance companies, temporary shelters, first responders, and mobile health clinics. 20 Increasingly, nontraditional data sources such as worker sick days from employer records are being used to screen for disease outbreaks. Next, case definitions need to be developed for uniformity of reporting outcomes. Finally, appropriate analytical methods should be used and can include descriptive measures, geographical analysis of spread, rates of disease or death, or an analysis over time measuring total numbers of cases and rates of appearance. 20 It is also important to remember that in a disaster situation, rigorous epidemiological approaches may not be time-conducive and that there will be an immediate need to quickly collect key, important data that may be perishable as time goes on and populations change in exposure and impact to the hazard. As a result, disaster situations invoke the use of \"quick and dirty\" data collection, \"quick\" being simple and flexible and \"dirty\" being that some quantitative data are rough estimates gathered to answer immediate questions. 18 Increasingly, for bioterrorism purposes, health departments are developing and testing syndromic surveillance systems. Syndromic surveillance is \"an investigational approach where health department staff, assisted by automated data acquisition and generation of statistical alarms, monitor disease indicators continually (real-time) or at least daily (near real-time) to detect outbreaks of diseases earlier and more completely than would otherwise be possible with traditional public health methods (e.g., by reportable disease surveillance or telephone consultation).\" Syndromic surveillance uses nontraditional data sources, or those other than laboratory data.These data reflect events \"that precede clinical diagnosis, such as emergency department chief complaints, clinical impressions on ambulance run sheets, prescriptions filled, retail drug and product purchases, school or work absenteeism, and constellations of medical signs and symptoms in persons seen in various clinical settings.\" 40",

This discipline, called public health, is a broad one, encompassing multiple sectors of the community and professional fields; government and nongovernment agencies; and local, regional, federal, and sometimes international institutions. Collectively, these groups respond to disasters to study, reduce, and develop ways to mitigate adverse health effects in the future. This chapter has summarized phases of the disaster cycle, the players involved, and the basic policy of disaster declaration and response. Additionally, we have reviewed components of public health infrastructure, provision of medical services, education and communications in disasters, mental health issues, worker safety, and finally the value and techniques of data collection and analysis.",

Importantly, responders should be proactive and become trained, well-informed, experienced providers and openly disseminate factual knowledge to the community and their peers. This is the beginning to a more efficient, life-saving public health response to disasters. CDC deployed field teams to New York City emergency departments on Sept. 14, 2001, to conduct surveillance for possible covert biological releases. For the first two weeks, epidemic intelligence service officers (EISOs) staffed 15 hospitals for 24 hours and then provided 18-hour coverage at 12 hospitals for the remaining 30-day surveillance period. The teams entered data on-site and reported data to the New York City departments of Health and Mental Health each morning and followed up on significant cases. Between Sept. 13 and Oct. 12, 68,546 emergency department visits were recorded, with trauma as the highest syndrome-to-none-ratio (SNR) found (18.6%), followed by exacerbation of a chronic respiratory condition (7.6%). Diarrhea/gastroenteritis (4.4%) and upper and lower respiratory infections (4.2%) were also reported. Children younger than 15 years presented most often with respiratory syndrome complaints (67%) and rash syndromes (59%). Those between 25 and 64 years old made up 80% of inhalational visits and 75% of anxiety visits. Analyses were also specifically conducted for home postal codes within a two-mile radius of the World Trade Center and revealed that persons in the two-mile radius were no more likely to have a syndrome of bioterrorism interest than those who were outside of that proximity. However, the study found that people in close proximity to the towers on Sept. 11 were 61.5 times more likely to visit the emergency department for smoke/dust inhalation complaints than people from other areas. Overall, no health data to support a bioterrorist release were found. 41 PUBLIC HEALTH ASSESSMENT",
