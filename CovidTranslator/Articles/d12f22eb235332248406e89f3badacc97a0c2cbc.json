Subjects were organized in 8-12 per group and interviews were conducted by trained field research assistants. General discussions especially on sensitive subjects was led by a group leader selected by participants. The focus group leader concept was used to encourage participants to disclose information freely. Responses obtained from the groups were documented and similar results were aggregated using tallies. All discussions were conducted in the local dialect of respondents.",
