Virtually every hospital has an infection control professional (ICP), and many larger hospitals have a consulting hospital epidemiologist. The Study on the Efficacy of Nosocomial Infection Control (SENIC) documented the effectiveness of a hospital infection control program that applies standard surveillance and control measures. 2 The major elements leading to a HAI are the infectious agent, a susceptible host, and a means of transmission. These elements are present in LTCFs as well as in hospitals. It is not surprising, therefore, that almost as many HAIs occur annually in LTCFs as in hospitals in the US. 3 The last 2 decades have seen increased recognition of the problem of infections in LTCFs, with subsequent widespread development of LTCF infection control programs and definition of the role of the ICP in LTCFs. An increasingly robust literature is devoted to LTC infection control issues such as the descriptive epidemiology of LTCF infections, the microbiology of LTCF infections, outbreaks, control measures, and isolation. Nevertheless, there is as yet no SENIC-equivalent study documenting the efficacy of infection control in LTCFs, and few controlled studies have analyzed the efficacy or cost-effectiveness of the specific control measures in that setting.",

The acute care facility focus is on providing intensive care to a patient who is generally expected to recover or improve, and high technology is integral to the process. In LTCFs, the patient population may be very heterogeneous. Most LTCFs carry out plans of care that have already been established in acute care or evaluate chronic conditions. The LTCF is functionally the home for the resident, who is usually elderly and in declining health and will often stay for years, hence comfort, dignity, and rights are paramount. It is a low-technology setting. Residents are often transferred between the acute care and the LTC setting, adding an additional dynamic to transmission and acquisition of HAIs.",

In LTC residents, the use of invasive devices (eg, central venous catheters, mechanical ventilators, enteral feeding tubes) increases the likelihood of a device-associated infection. Of the over 15,000 LTCFs in the US in 2004, 42% provided infusion therapy, 22% had residents with peripherally-inserted central lines, and 46% provided parenteral nutrition. 14 Another challenge for preventing infections in LTCFs is the increasing acuity of residents, especially with the rapidly growing subpopulation of postacute residents. Postacute residents are hospitalized patients who are discharged to LTCFs to receive skilled nursing care or physical/occupational therapy. In the past, these patients, often frail, would have remained hospitalized, but, with increasing efforts to control hospital costs, these patients are now discharged to LTCFs. In addition to higher device utilization, these residents are more likely to receive antimicrobial therapy than long-stay LTCF residents. 15 Much remains to be learned about resident and LTCF factors correlated with HAIs. There is evidence that institutional factors such as nurse turnover, staffing levels, prevalence of Medicare recipients, rates of hospital transfer for infection, intensity of medical services, and family visitation rates are associated with incidence of HAI in the LTC setting. 16 The rate of deaths in LTCF residents with infections ranges from 0.04 to 0.71 per 1000 resident-days, with pneumonia being the leading cause of death. 8 Infections are a leading reason for hospital transfer to LTCF residents, and the resulting hospital costs range from $673 million to $2 billion each year. 8 LTCFs and acute care facilities differ in another key aspect: LTCFs are residential. As residences, LTCFs are required to provide socialization of residents through group activities. While these activities are important for promoting good physical and mental health, they may also increase communicable infectious disease exposure and transmission. Occupational and physical therapy activities, while vital toward restoring or maintaining physical and mental function, may increase risk for person-to-person transmission or exposure to contaminated environmental surfaces (eg, physical or occupational therapy equipment).",

The elderly may present with atypical or nonlocalizing symptoms. Chronic genitourinary symptoms are also common but are not attributable to bacteriuria. 20, 21 Because the prevalence of bacteriuria is high, a positive urine culture, with or without pyuria, is not sufficient to diagnose urinary infection. 20 Clinical findings for diagnosis of UTI in the noncatheterized resident must include some localization to the genitourinary tract. 23 The diagnosis also requires a positive quantitative urine culture. This is obtained by the clean-catch voided technique, by in and out catheterization, or by aspiration through a catheter system sampling port. A negative test for pyuria or a negative urine culture obtained prior to initiation of antimicrobial therapy excludes urinary infection.",

[24] [25] [26] Catheterization predisposes to clinical UTI, and the catheterized urinary tract is the most common source of bacteremia in LTCFs. 17, 19 Residents with long-term catheters often present with fever alone. Residents with indwelling urinary catheters in the LTCF are uniformly colonized with bacteria, largely attributable to biofilm on the catheter. 27 These organisms are often more resistant to oral antibiotics than bacteria isolated from elderly persons in the community. 28, 29 Catheter-related bacteriuria is dynamic, and antimicrobial treatment only leads to increased antimicrobial resistance. 30 Thus, it is inappropriate to screen asymptomatic catheterized residents for bacteriuria or to treat asymptomatic bacteriuria. 20 Specimens collected through the catheter present for more than a few days reflect biofilm microbiology. For residents with chronic indwelling catheters and symptomatic infection, changing the catheter immediately prior to instituting antimicrobial therapy allows collection of a bladder specimen, which is a more accurate reflection of infecting organisms. 31 Catheter replacement immediately prior to therapy is also associated with more rapid defervescence and lower risk of early symptomatic relapse posttherapy. 31 Guidelines for prevention of catheter-associated UTIs in hospitalized patients 32 are generally applicable to catheterized residents in LTCFs. Recommended measures include limiting use of catheters, insertion of catheters aseptically by trained personnel, use of as small diameter a catheter as possible, handwashing before and after catheter manipulation, maintenance of a closed catheter system, avoiding irrigation unless the catheter is obstructed, keeping the collecting bag below the bladder, and maintaining good hydration in residents. Urinary catheters coated with antimicrobial materials have the potential to decrease UTIs but have not been studied in the LTCF setting. For some residents with impaired voiding, intermittent catheterization is an option, and clean technique is as safe as sterile technique. 33 External catheters are also a risk factor for UTIs in male residents 34 but are significantly more comfortable and associated with fewer adverse effects, including symptomatic urinary infection, than an indwelling catheter. 35 Local external care is required. The CDC guideline 32 briefly discusses care of condom catheters and suprapubic catheters, but no guideline for leg bags is available. Leg bags allow for improved ambulation of residents but probably increase the risk of UTI because opening of the system and reflux of urine from the bag to the bladder occur more frequently than with a standard closed system. Suggestions for care of leg bags include using aseptic technique when disconnecting and reconnecting, disinfecting connections with alcohol, changing bags at regular intervals, rinsing with diluted vinegar, and drying between uses. 36 A 1:3 dilution of white vinegar has been recommended for leg bag disinfection. 37",

            "text": "Because of the impaired immunity of elderly persons, viral upper respiratory infections (URIs) that generally are mild in other populations may cause significant disease in the institutionalized elderly patient. 38, 39 Examples include influenza, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza, coronavirus, rhinoviruses, adenoviruses, and recently discovered human metapneumovirus. 40 Pneumonia. Pneumonia or lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) is the second most common cause of infection among nursing home residents, with an incidence ranging from 0.3 to 2.5 episodes per 1000 resident care-days and is the leading cause of death from infections in this setting. Elderly LTCF residents are predisposed to pneumonia by virtue of decreased clearance of bacteria from the airways and altered throat flora, poor functional status, presence of feeding tubes, swallowing difficulties, and aspiration as well as inadequate oral care. [41] [42] [43] Underlying diseases, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and heart disease, further increase the risk of pneumonia in this population. 44 The clinical presentation of pneumonia in the elderly often is atypical. While there is a paucity of typical respiratory symptoms, recent studies have shown that fever is present in 70%, new or increased cough in 61%, altered mental status in 38%, and increased respiratory rate above 30 per minute in 23% of residents with pneumonia. 45 While acquiring a diagnostic sputum can be difficult, obtaining a chest radiograph is now more feasible than in the past. In general it is recommended that a pulse oximetry, chest radiograph, complete blood count with differential, and blood urea nitrogen should be obtained in residents with suspected pneumonia. 46 Streptococcus pneumoniae appears to be the most common etiologic agent accounting for about 13% of all cases, 47,48 followed by Hemophilus influenzae (6.5%), Staphylococcus aureus (6.5%), Moraxella catarrhalis (4.5%), and aerobic gram-negative bacteria (13%). 44 Legionella pneumoniae also is a concern in the LTCF. Colonization with methicillin-resistant S aureus (MRSA) and antibiotic-resistant, gram-negative bacteria further complicate diagnosis and management of pneumonia in LTCF residents. 49, 50 The mortality rate for LTCF-acquired pneumonia is significantly higher than for community-acquired pneumonia in the elderly population. 51 Preinfection functional status, dementia, increased rate of respirations and pulse, and a change in mental status are considered to be poor prognostic factors. Several indices predictive of mortality have been developed and may be useful in managing residents with pneumonia. 45, 52, 53 The CDC guideline for prevention of pneumonia 54 is oriented toward acute care hospitals but covers a number of points relevant to the LTCF, including respiratory therapy equipment, suctioning techniques, tracheostomy care, prevention of aspiration with enteral feedings, and immunizations. Examples of relevant recommendations for the LTCF include hand hygiene after contact with respiratory secretions, wearing gloves for suctioning, elevating the head of the bed 30 to 45 degrees during tube feeding and for at least 1 hour after to decrease aspiration, and vaccination of high-risk residents with pneumococcal vaccine. 54 The evidence for the efficacy of pneumococcal vaccine in high-risk populations, including the elderly population, is debated. 55, 56 However, the vaccine is safe, relatively inexpensive, and recommended for routine use in individuals over the age of 65 years. 56, 57 Pneumococcal vaccination rates for a facility are now publicly reported at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). 58 Influenza. Influenza is an acute respiratory disease signaled by the abrupt onset of fever, chills, myalgias, and headache along with sore throat and cough, although elderly LTCF residents may not have this typical presentation. The incubation period for influenza is approximately 1 to 2 days. 59 It is a major threat to LTCF residents, who are among the high-risk groups deserving preventive measures. 60 Influenza is very contagious, and outbreaks in LTCFs are common and often severe. Clinical attack rates range from 25% to 70%, and case fatality rates average over 10%. [61] [62] [63] [64] A killed virus vaccine is available but must be given annually. Influenza vaccine in the elderly is approximately 40% effective at preventing hospitalization for pneumonia and approximately 50% effective at preventing hospital deaths from pneumonia. 65 Although concern has been expressed regarding the efficacy of the influenza vaccine in institutionalized elderly patients, most authors feel that the influenza vaccine is effective and indicated for all residents and caregivers. [63] [64] [65] [66] [67] [68] Recent surveys have shown an increased rate of influenza vaccination among LTCF residents, although significant variability exists. 69, 70 Influenza vaccination rates for a facility are now publicly reported at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid (CMS) Web site http://www.medicare.gov/NHCompare/ home.asp. Staff immunization rates remain less impressive, with average immunization rates between 40% and 50% at best.",

Chest radiographs, when obtained, often show characteristic pulmonary infiltrates (eg, cavities in the upper lung fields). Infection with TB usually causes a positive tuberculin skin test (TST), although occasional false positives and false negatives are seen. The specificity of the TST may be improved by an in vitro blood test of interferon release in response to TB peptides, such as the quantiferon test. The most specific diagnostic test is a sputum culture for TB, but a good specimen may be difficult to obtain. Recent advances in microbiology have facilitated the diagnosis of TB greatly. Diagnostics such as radiometric systems, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), as well as specific DNA probes help shorten the time for diagnosis of TB, although susceptibility testing requires several weeks.",

For LTCF residents without any known contact with a case of known TB or other significant risk factors such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or immunosuppression, induration of 10 mm or greater to PPD injection is considered positive. Induration of 5 mm or greater is considered positive in any individual with recent contact with a known case of TB or other significant risk factors such as immunosuppression or changes on chest x-ray consistent with old TB. 83 There was a resurgence of TB in the US in the mid-1980s; multidrug-resistant cases of TB have been seen, and nosocomial spread within health care facilities is a concern. 84 In response to this, guidelines have been promulgated by the CDC that address surveillance (identification and reporting of all TB cases in the facility including residents and staff); containment (recommended treatment under directly observed therapy and appropriate respiratory isolation and ventilation control measures); assessment (monitoring of surveillance and containment activities); and ongoing education of residents, families, and staff. 85 Since most LTCFs do not have a negative-pressure room, residents with suspected active TB should be transferred to an appropriate acute care facility for evaluation.

Outbreaks of group A streptococcal infections have been described, presenting as cellulitis, pharyngitis, pneumonia, or septicemia. [91] [92] [93] Scabies is a contagious skin infection caused by a mite. Lesions usually are very pruritic, burrow-like, and associated with erythema and excoriations, usually in interdigital spaces of the fingers, palms and wrists, axilla, waist, buttocks, and the perineal area. However, these typical findings may be absent in debilitated residents, leading to large, prolonged outbreaks in LTCFs. [94] [95] [96] Diagnosis in an individual with a rash requires a high index of suspicion in order to recognize the need for diagnostic skin scrapings. The presence of a proven case should prompt a thorough search for secondary cases. A single treatment with permethrin or lindane usually is effective, but repeated treatment or treatment of all LTCF residents, personnel, and families occasionally is necessary. 97, 98 Ivermectin, an oral antihelminthic agent, is an effective, safe, and inexpensive option for treatment of scabies. However, it has not been approved by the FDA for this indication. Therapy of rashes without confirming the diagnosis of scabies unnecessarily exposes residents to the toxic effects of the topical agents. Because scabies can be transmitted by linen and clothing, the environment should be cleaned thoroughly. This includes cleaning inanimate surfaces, hot-cycle washing of washable items (clothing, sheets, towels, etc), and vacuuming the carpet.",

[128] [129] [130] [131] [132] [133] [134] [135] [136] [137] In this setting, infection with MDROs has been associated with increased morbidity, mortality, and cost, 138, 139 although the attributable morbidity, mortality, and cost of MDROs has not yet been fully defined. Indeed, LTCF residence has been frequently identified as a risk factor for antibiotic-resistant infection in hospitalized patients. 140, 141 Elderly and disabled residents are at increased risk for colonization with resistant organisms, and colonization may persist for long periods of time (ie, months to years). 133, [142] [143] [144] [145] [146] Within the LTCF, length of stay in the facility and accommodation in rooms with multiple beds have been identified as risk factors for transmission of MRSA. 147 Both infected and colonized residents may serve as sources for the spread of MDROs in the LTCF. 135, 148 When MRSA becomes endemic within a facility, elimination is highly unlikely. 148 LTCFs can expect infections with MDROs to be a continuing problem. Strategies for curbing the emergence and spread of antimicrobial resistance in LTCFs are discussed below in ''Antibiotic Stewardship'' and ''Isolation and Precautions'' sections.",

            "text": "The 1980s saw a dramatic increase in LTCF infection control activities, stimulated by federal and state regulations. Several studies provide insight into the extent of program development. A 1981 survey of Utah LTCFs 113 noted that all facilities had regular infection control meetings, but none performed systematic surveillance for infections or conducted regular infection control training. All LTCFs had policies regarding the maintenance and care of urinary catheters, although the policies were not uniform. Price et al 149 surveyed 12 North Carolina LTCFs in 1985 and found that, although all 12 had a designated ICP, none of the ICPs had received special training in this area. Also noted were deficiencies in isolation facilities, particularly an insufficient number of sinks and recirculated, inadequately filtered air.",

            "text": "In a 1985 survey of Minnesota LTCFs, Crossley et al 150 found that the majority had an infection control committee (ICC) and a designated ICP, although substantial deficiencies in resident and employee health programs occurred. For instance, only 61% offered the influenza vaccine to residents, and one third did not screen new employees for a history of infectious disease problems. A 1988 Maryland survey 151 found that one third of nursing homes still performed routine environmental cultures, and many lacked proper isolation policies. In 1990, a survey of Connecticut LTCFs found that most ICPs had received some training in infection control. 152, 153 Most LTCFs performed surveillance at least weekly, and most used written criteria to determine HAIs. More recent regional surveys of facilities from Maryland and New England in the mid-1990s and Michigan in 2005 noted increasing gains in time spent in infection control activities from 1994 to 2005. 69, 154 In New England, 98% of facilities had a person designated to do infection control, 90% were registered nurses, and 52% had formal training. 154 In the 1990s, an average of 9 to 12 hours per week was spent on infection control; 50% to 54% of that time was spent on surveillance activities. 154 Seventy-eight to 97% percent of the LTCFs reported a systematic surveillance system. 69 Formal definitions were used by 95% of respondents; 81% used the McGeer criteria, and 59% calculated infection rates. 154 All facilities reportedly used Universal Precautions in caring for their residents. 154 By 2005, 50% of responding facilities in Michigan had a full-time ICP. 69 The mean time spent on infection 69 However, part-time ICPs did not necessarily supervise smaller facilities with fewer subacute care beds or give fewer in-services than full-time staff. Despite these improvements, the number of ICPs per nursing home bed is 4-fold fewer than the number of ICPs available in acute care hospitals. 155 LTCF-based ICPs are more likely to assume noninfection control functions than acute care ICPs regardless of bed size; in one survey, 98% of LTCF ICPs had other duties, 156 while in a Michigan survey, 50% of 34 LTCFs had fulltime ICPs. 69 Many of these noninfection control functions include employee health, staff education and development, and quality improvement. 155 In addition, LTCF ICPs are still less likely to receive additional formal training in infection control (8%) compared with 95% of acute care ICPs. 155 The results of this study from Maryland led to a state proposal that at least one ICP from each LTCF be formally trained in infection control. 155 From these surveys, one can develop a composite picture of the LTCF ICP as a nurse who still has not necessarily received formal training in infection control. 154, 155 Many ICPs still work part-time on infection control activities regardless of the number of beds or patient acuity. 69, 155 While the time spent on infection control activities appears to have increased significantly from 36 to 48 hours per month in the 1990s to 90 to 160 hours per month in 2005, the ICP continues to have other duties such as general duty nursing, nursing supervision, in-service education, employee health, and quality assurance. 34, 69, 154 Regulatory aspects LTCFs are covered by federal and state regulations as well as voluntary agency standards such as those written by The Joint Commission (TJC). 157 Skilled nursing facilities are required by the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1987 (OBRA) to have an infection control program. 158 CMS has published requirements for LTCFs 159 that apply to LTCFs accepting Medicare and/ or Medicaid residents. CMS regulations address the need for a comprehensive infection control program that includes surveillance of infections; implementation of methods for preventing the spread of infections including use of appropriate isolation measures, employee health protocols, hand hygiene practices; and appropriate handling, processing, and storage of linens. 160, 161 For example, the LTCF is required to establish and maintain an infection control program designed to provide a safe, sanitary, and comfortable environment and to help prevent the development and transmission of disease and infection. Interpretive guidelines for surveyors further discuss definitions of infection, risk assessment, outbreak management and control, measures for preventing specific infections, staff orientation, antibiotic monitoring, sanitation, and assessment of compliance with infection control policies. 161 Because the LTCF is an employer of health care workers (HCWs), it must comply with federal and/or state OSHA regulations. For infection control, those regulations 162,163 deal primarily with protection of workers from exposure to bloodborne pathogens such as HIV, hepatitis B virus (HBV), and hepatitis C virus (HCV) and from TB exposure. 85 Adherence of LTCFs to infection control regulations is an OSHA priority.",

The Standards also deal with managing an influx of patients with an infectious disease as well as leadership's involvement in the program. 165 In addition, many states have statutory requirements for LTCFs that vary widely. On October 7, 2005, CMS published a final rule requiring LTCFs to offer annually to each resident immunization against influenza and to offer lifetime immunization against pneumococcal disease. LTCFs are required to ensure that each resident or legal representative receive education on the benefits and potential side effects of the immunizations prior to their being administered. 58 The LTCF administrative staff should be knowledgeable about the federal, state, and local regulations governing infection control in order to implement and maintain a program in compliance with these regulations.

Infection surveillance may either include all residents in a facility (total house surveillance) or be targeted at specific subpopulations.

Because residents of LTCFs are hospitalized frequently, they can transfer pathogens between LTCFs and receiving hospitals; transfer of patients colonized with MDROs between hospitals and LTCFs has been well documented. 192, 193 On the other hand, LTCF residents remain in the facility for extended periods of time, and the LTCF is functionally their home.

ICPs in the LTCF have thus been required to adapt these practices to their individual settings. Traditionally, 2 types of systems for implementing barrier precautions in the hospital were promoted. A Category-Specific System listed 7 categories of isolation or precautions based on means of disease transmission: strict isolation, contact isolation, respiratory isolation, TB isolation, enteric precautions, drainage and secretion precautions, and blood and body fluid precautions. Modifications of this approach have been promoted since 1970 with a refined Category-Specific System in the 1983 recommendations. 194, 195 A Disease-Specific System listed all relevant contagious diseases and the recommended barrier method. In general, the Category-Specific System was simpler to use, but the Disease-Specific System consumed fewer resources because precautions were tailored to the specific disease. In the 1983 guideline, blood precautions were expanded to include body fluids. 195 In response to the HIV/AIDS epidemic, the concept of Universal Precautions was introduced to protect HCWs from all bloodborne exposures. 196, 197 These recommendations became adopted by OSHA and have thus been applicable to all health care settings including LTCFs. 163, 198 In this system, all blood and certain body fluids are considered potentially infectious. Education, provision of needle-disposal units, provision of protective equipment (such as gloves, gowns, and protective eye wear), and monitoring compliance were part of Universal Precautions, although it alone was not considered a complete isolation system.",

In LTCFs, it is advised to consider the individual resident's clinical situation when deciding whether to implement or modify the use of Contact Precautions in addition to Standard Precautions if colonized or infected with a MDRO. Standard Precautions are sufficient for relatively healthy and independent residents, ensuring that gloves and gowns are used for contact with uncontrolled secretions, pressure ulcers, draining wounds, stool, and ostomy tubes/bags. Contact Precautions are indicated for residents with MDROs who are ill and totally dependent upon HCWs for activities of daily living or whose secretions or drainage cannot be contained. Single rooms for these residents are recommended if available. The cohorting of MDRO residents is acceptable if single rooms are not available. If cohorting is not possible, then placing residents with MDRO with residents who are low risk for acquisition or with anticipated short lengths of stay is advised. While ''low risk for acquisition'' of an MDRO has not been officially defined, one source suggested that it should include residents who are not immunosuppressed; not on antibiotics; and free of open wounds, drains, and indwelling urinary catheters. 209 Case-by-case decisions, as needed, can be made regarding the best precautions to use for each resident with a MDRO. With Contact Precautions, wearing a gown and gloves for all interactions that may involve contact with the resident and their environment is advised, and eye protection is recommended when there is risk of splash or spray of respiratory or other body fluids.",

[242] [243] [244] A study of 22 LTCFs noted an incidence of antibiotic prescriptions of 2.9 to 13.9 antibiotic courses per 1000 resident-days. 245 Several studies have questioned the appropriateness of this practice. [242] [243] [244] A common problem is the failure to distinguish infection and colonization (such as a positive swab culture of a pressure ulcer or a urine culture showing bacteriuria without signs or symptoms of infection) and the treatment of the colonization with antibiotics. In addition, antibiotics often are prescribed over the telephone in this setting. 246 There also appears to be significant variability in antibiotic prescribing patterns in the LTCF. 247 Several reviews and guidelines for infection control efforts to curb antibiotic resistance in health care settings (including LTCFs) have been published. 167, 173, 200 These guidelines stress the importance of having an ICP trained in infection control and LTCF administrative support and resources for the infection control program. 237 The CDC has published a 12-step program for preventing antimicrobial resistance among LTCF residents that addresses the broad areas of preventing infection (eg, resident vaccination), diagnosis/treatment of infection, using antibiotics wisely, and preventing transmission (www.cdc.gov). A LTCF antibiotic review program is recommended 173 and is often found in LTCFs. 248, 249 Recent guidelines have addressed the development of antimicrobial stewardship programs in hospitals. 250 Using this guideline as a starting point, LTCFs are encouraged to include antimicrobial stewardship in the LTCF infection control program and discuss appropriate choices for various clinical situations. 241 A recent survey revealed that fewer than one third of LTCFs surveyed had any such antibiotic use protocols in place. 251 Minimum criteria for initiation of antibiotic therapy have been proposed to improve antimicrobial prescribing in LTCFs 252 and may be of assistance in developing antibiotic appropriateness criteria.",

            "text": "Categorization of recommendations In addition to the above outcome measures, surveillance should also include analysis of process measures relevant to infection control (Category II). Surveillance data should be used to detect and prevent outbreaks in the LTCF (Category IB/IC).Comment: The occurrence of even a single verified case of a highly transmissible disease (such as infectious TB, influenza, scabies, Salmonella, and norovirus) in the LTCF should prompt notification of appropriate individuals (such as the medical director or administrator), consideration of an outbreak, and institution of control measures. After the institution of isolation precautions, assessment of exposed residents and personnel should be made in a timely fashion to detect other cases. The facility should define authority for intervention during an outbreak (Category IB).Comment: The LTCF should have a preexisting protocol for dealing with infectious disease epidemics, including the authority to relocate residents, confine residents to their rooms, restrict visitors, obtain cultures, isolate, and administer relevant prophylaxis or treatment (such as antivirals during an influenza outbreak). In order to facilitate response to an outbreak, consent for appropriate diagnostic or therapeutic measures should be obtained from the resident or medical decision maker and the resident's primary physician on admission to the facility (Category II). 4 Obtaining cultures of the environment or from asymptomatic personnel is not recommended except as targeted by an epidemiologic investigation (Category II). 5 A TB control program should focus on detection of active cases in residents and staff and isolation or transfer of residents with known or suspected pulmonary TB disease (Category IC).Comment: TB control programs are mandated by OSHA. A case of TB in residents or staff that was or may have been acquired in the facility should lead to clinical evaluation and TB testing of residents and employees. F. The facility 1 Hand hygiene facilities and supplies should be available and conveniently located for residents and staff (Category IA). 2 Clean and soiled utility areas should be functionally separate and clearly designated (Category IC). 3 Appropriate ventilation and air filtration should be addressed by the LTCF (Category IC). Comment: If the LTCF provides care for residents or accepts residents with a diagnosis of active TB, the airborne infection isolation (AII) requirement should be met. If these requirements cannot be met, a system for transfer of cases to an appropriate institution that provides AII should be part of the overall infection control plan. 4 Housekeeping in the facility should be performed on a routine and consistent basis to provide for a safe and sanitary environment (Category IC). Comment: Cleaning schedules should be kept for all areas in the LTCF. Cleaning products should be approved and labeled appropriately; manufacturer's (or other authoritative) recommendations for use and dilution should be followed. 5 Measures should be instituted to correct unsafe and unsanitary practices (Category II). Comment: Environmental cleanliness may be monitored by walking rounds with a checklist for each area of the LTCF. Nursing interventions may be monitored by direct observation during such rounds. 6 Areas in the LTCF with unique infection control concerns (eg, laundry, kitchen, rehabilitation) should have the appropriate policies and procedures developed (Category II). Comment: Laundry policies and procedures should address the following: proper bagging of linen at the site of use, transporting linen in appropriate carts, cleaning of the carts on a regular basis, separation of clean and soiled linen, washing temperatures or use of an appropriate chemical mix for low-temperature washing, covering of clean linen, protection of personnel handling soiled laundry, and hand hygiene after contact with soiled linen. Adequate supplies of clean linen should be available. Laundry regulations should be addressed if the facility does its own laundry. Dietetic service area policies and procedures should address the following: handling of uncooked foods, cooking of food, cleaning of food preparation areas, food storage, cooking and refrigeration temperatures, cleaning of ice machines, hand hygiene indications, and employee health. Food and drink should be limited to specific areas. Policies and procedures covering infection control aspects of physical therapy (including cleaning of hydrotherapy tanks) should be developed. It should include cleaning and disinfection of hydrotherapy equipment, hand hygiene indications, and cleaning of exercise equipment. If pets are allowed, the LTCF should have a policy defining access, containment, cleanliness, and vaccination of pets. 7 Policies and procedures for disposal of infectious medical waste (including waste categorization, packaging, storage, collection, transport, and disposal) should be developed in accordance with federal, state, and local regulations (Category IC). Comment: Examples of specific issues include types of waste disposal bags, cleaning of waste transportation carts, and types of waste storage containers. Policies for sharps disposal should be developed. G. Isolation and precautions 1 Isolation and precautions policies and procedures should be developed, evaluated, and updated in accordance with most recent CDC/HICPAC guidance (Category IC). 2 Regular education programs should be developed to reinforce understanding and compliance (Category IC). 3 Compliance with these infection control practices (eg, hand hygiene, isolation) should be monitored (Category IC). 4 Any isolation and precautions system used should include implementation of Standard Precautions for all residents (eg, wearing of gloves, masks, eye protection, and gowns when contamination or splashing with blood or body fluids is likely) (Category IC). 5 Any isolation and precautions system should include the implementation of transmission-based precautions (Contact Precautions, Droplet Precautions, or Airborne Precautions) in accordance with current CDC/HICPAC guidance (Category IB/IC). 6 The LTCF should have a policy dealing with MDROs (such as MRSA or VRE) that is compatible with current national standards (such as the HICPAC isolation and MDRO guidelines) and appropriate to the LTCF setting (Category IB). Comment: This policy should deal with issues such as acceptance of colonized or infected patients into the facility, inquiring about colonization of admissions with MDROs, and isolation of residents with MDROs. Denial of admission to the LTCF solely on the basis of colonization or infection with a resistant organism is not appropriate. HICPAC recommends intensification of containment measures for MDROs if ongoing transmission is occurring. The individual resident's clinical situation should be considered when deciding whether to implement or modify the use of Contact Precautions in addition to Standard Precautions if colonized or infected with a MDRO (Category IB/IC).Comment. Routine glove use is an example of a form of modified Contact Precautions, but it has not been validated in the LTCF setting.8 A program of safe work practices to prevent HCW exposure should be developed in accordance with CDC/HICPAC and OSHA guidance. Used needles and syringes should not be manually recapped, broken, or bent. Self-capping needles should be used. They should be disposed of, with all sharps, in a puncture-resistant, leak-proof container (Category IC). 9 Gloves are indicated for contact with blood or body fluids, contaminated items, mucous membranes, or nonintact skin (Category IC). 10 Policies should be developed to deal with spills and personnel exposure to blood or body fluids. Employees should know how to respond to an exposure (eg, immediately washing the skin in the event of a blood exposure). Postexposure prophylaxis should be readily available (Category IC). 11 Residents with suspected TB should be placed in a negative-pressure room or transferred to a facility with such a room (Category IC).H. Asepsis and hand hygiene1 Routine hand hygiene should be encouraged. Hands should be washed after any patient contact but especially after contact with body fluids, after removing gloves, when soiled, and when otherwise indicated (Category IA). Unless hands are visibly soiled, use of alcohol-based hand gels is encouraged (Category IA/IC). 2 A hand hygiene policy and procedure should be developed by the LTCF in accordance with current CDC/HICPAC guidance with a program of ongoing hand hygiene education (Category IB/IC). 3 Hand hygiene compliance should be monitored (Category IC). Policies and procedures for disinfection and sterilization should be developed (Category IB). Comment: These policies and procedures should address issues such as sterile supplies, reuse of disposable items, disinfection of equipment (such as thermometers), and cleaning of noncritical items. All items, other than disposables, should be cleaned, disinfected, or sterilized, following published guidelines and manufacturers' recommendations. The ICP should identify those resident care procedures that require aseptic technique. I. Resident care 1 Resident rooms should have an accessible sink, with soap, water, towels, and toilet facilities (Category II). Comment: Provision should be made for maintaining adequate resident personal hygiene and for instructing residents in hygiene and hand hygiene as appropriate to their functional status. 2 A resident skin care program should be developed to maintain the skin as a barrier to infection (Category II). Comment: Resident skin care should include the following: routine frequent turning for those unable to do so themselves, keeping the residents clean and dry, inspecting all residents' skin on a routine basis, ensuring appropriate nutrition, treating pressure ulcers, and providing prompt care for any other breaks in skin integrity. Turning schedules and pressure ulcer assessment forms may be useful. 3 A program to prevent UTIs should be developed, including the following: d Routine urinalysis or urine culture to screen for bacteriuria or pyuria is not recommended (Category IA). d Residents with impaired bladder emptying managed with intermittent catheterization should be managed with a clean technique (Category IA). s Policies for catheter use should address catheter insertion, closed drainage systems, maintenance of urinary flow, and indications for changing the catheter (Category IB). s Irrigation of indwelling catheters with saline or antiseptics is not routinely recommended (Category IB). d If leg bags are used, the LTCF should develop policies and procedures for aseptic connection, cleaning, and storage of leg bags (Category II). d Adequate hydration should be maintained (Category II).",
