Craig Venter Institute (JCVI) published on Science their latest achievement on the creation of the first synthetic cell, as labeled JCVI-syn1.0, which was controlled by a completely chemically synthesized genome [1] . This achievement upon its publication has brought great concerns and extensive discussions in both scientific community and social society. The birth of the first synthetic cell indicates an important breakthrough in synthetic biology, which is an emerging field showing great value and potential in many fields, including medicine, energy, environment and agriculture. According to the report by The Royal Academy of Engineering of United Kingdom in 2009, it is expected that synthetic biology will create new significant industries, and the development of this field will have great impact on the future economy of United Kingdom, Europe and even all over the world [2] . Researchers from a wide range of disciplines, including *Corresponding author (email: wangjing@psych.ac.cn) biology, computer science, engineering and mathematics, have been attracted to devote themselves to the research of synthetic biology. Numerous projects on synthetic biology have been proposed. A flourish of synthetic biology has been envisioned especially in Europe and USA. In order to promote the development of synthetic biology in China, here in this article, we made a systematic review on synthetic biology, including its basic concept, research content, and key achievements. We also investigated its current situation in both China and abroad. At last, we analyzed the opportunities and challenges in synthetic biology, and looked forward to the future development of synthetic biology, especially its future development in China.",

According to the definition from the Synthetic Biology Community (http://syntheticbiology.org/), which is the most widely accepted concept, synthetic biology is the design and construction of new biological parts, devices and systems and the re-design of existing natural biological systems for useful purposes. Synthetic biology on the one hand is important to explore the origin and evolution of life, on the other hand, it has a broad range of applications ranging from health care (diagnostics and therapeutics), environment (biosensors, bioremediation), energy (biofuel) to agriculture (optimized food), through engineering the biological systems or modules [2] [3] [4] [5] . One of the key features of synthetic biology is to apply the engineering principles to biological studies. The pipeline for engineering design, described as specification, design, modeling, implementation and testing/validation, was introduced into the design and construction of biological systems (Figure 1 ). Under the principle of synthetic biology, the complex life system can be treated as an organic combination of various functional elements. Synthetic biology starts from specification and standardization of biological parts, and then assembles the parts into devices and systems step by step [6] . The standardization of biological parts helps to improve the controllability and predictability of designed modules. Figure 2 shows the feature of synthetic biology and its difference in comparison to traditional genetic engineering.",

The Engineering Cycle starts with defining the specification for the device or system which is to be designed and built. The next step in the process is to design the device or system on the basis of the specification. Frequently in engineering the design is then tested by extensive modeling. In the case of synthetic biology this is almost always an important step. Modeling is followed by implementation, testing and validation [6] .",

Both traditional genetic engineering and synthetic biology employ naturally occurring and modified biological components to construct an engineered system. However, because the building blocks and assembly methods of traditional genetic engineering methods are not well characterized, they often result in unanticipated interactions that can lead to suboptimal integration and pleiotropic effects when assembled into a larger system. This means that the output is frequently unpredictable and strongly dependent upon both the selection of specific parts and the methods for assembly. By contrast, synthetic biology begins with developing standardized biological components, with standardized interfaces that are fixed to promote optimal integration. The result should be highly predictable engineered systems with a single output for a single input [5] . and mathematics provide technical support on life design; while accumulated experiences on genetic and metabolic engineering etc. enable the process of life engineering. Synthetic biology can not only optimize life, but also can create new life. In this respect, we may regard synthetic biology as a revolutionarily new biotechnology.",

A bio-part, or BioBrick, usually refers to a short segment of DNA which acts as a promoter, terminator, protein coding sequence, or any other functional element. Standardization of bio-parts is a process to characterize and specify the bio-parts, including a detailed description and quality control testing by following certain standards. The highly characterized bio-parts make the design and construction of biological modules (devices, systems) much easier. The interaction of various elements in biological system is similar to that in electronic system. Based on these similarities, genetic circuits were designed and constructed ( Figure 3 ). The design and construction of biological modules not only include the de novo design and construction of new biological modules, but also the re-design of the existing natural biological systems.",

An ideal chassis is supposed to have a simplified but robust genome, i.e. \"minimal genome\", to reduce background noise and complexity, and to improve predictability and controllability of the new system. A minimal genome is a collection of essential gene contents which has the ability to sustain normal cellular life under ideal conditions, that is, in the presence of a full complement of essential nutrients and in the absence of environmental stress [8] . So the key question for minimal genome research is to identify the essentiality of genes. Usually there are two strategies [9] to get a minimal genome: the top-down strategy which aims to delete the non-essential segments from existing natural genomes, and the bottom-up strategy which obtains a minimal genome by de novo synthesis and assembly of essential genes. It should be noted that here the \"minimal genome\" is not an absolute concept but a relative concept in comparison to natural genomes. Usually the living condition and research objective help define the boundary of a minimal genome [10] . It is hard to get a universal chassis suitable for different research or application purposes. With more microbial genomes being sequenced, the rich database of genome sequences, as well as the rapid development of DNA sequencing and synthesis techniques, provide strong foundations for the construction of minimal genomes.",

Multiple genes from bacterium, yeast and plant were involved and designed to make an engineered organism which has the ability of producing artemisinic acid with high efficiency. Once this achievement was applied to industrial production, the cost of anti-malaria drug would be greatly reduced. This event also indicates the great value and prospect of synthetic biology in medicine field.",

Some other challenges also need to be tackled, such as the test of SNPs, quality control of DNA synthesis, DNA methylation, etc. It is estimated that about 40 million U.S. dollars were spent with over a decade efforts from 20 people for creation of such a synthetic cell [61] .

To distinguish the synthetic genome from the natural one, 4 watermark sequences were designed to replace one or more cassettes in regions not interfering with cell viability [1]. The synthetic genome was produced with 1078 of 1080-bp cassettes which covered the whole designed genome. These cassettes were all chemically synthesized, and the ends of each cassette had 80-bp overlaps to adjacent cassettes to facilitate their assembly. A three-stage strategy was utilized to assemble the genome from these cassettes by transformation and homologous recombination in yeast. First, 109 of 10080-bp assemblies were stitched, then 11 of 100000-bp assemblies, and finally the complete genome with 1077947-bp length. The intact synthetic M. mycoides genomes from the yeast were transplanted into the restriction-minus M. capricolum recipient cells by using techniques described in ref. [66] . After culturing and selection, a blue colony of bacteria was found to rapidly grow on a lab plate, which was subsequently identified as the synthetic transplants. Oct. 1995 The whole genome sequencing of Mycoplasma genitalium was completed [30] Dec. 1999 After identified by global transposon mutagenesis, it is estimated that there are about 265-350 genes are essential in the genome of M. genitalium [62] Dec. 2003",

For example, the suicide gene can be used to kill the engineered cell once it developed in a wrong way; some designed cell can only survive under certain conditions, and some engineered cell only has limited age. On the other hand, from the social point of view, regulations on bio-security and bio-safety should be proposed. First, government should strengthen the management. Second, scientists should fulfill their responsibility to prevent the abuse of such techniques. Third, the public should be educated to have a objective understanding of the new technology to avoid unnecessary panic (http://world.people.com.cn/GB/ 57507/11806145.html). An assessment from related ethical committee in U.S. said that currently synthetic biology will not produce huge unexpected destructive influence, but long-term supervision should be paid and appropriate measures should be formulated and implemented to avoid the risk.",

How to make full use of the current achievements and to establish our own research platform for synthetic biology is one of the important issues we are facing. Meanwhile synthetic biology research in China should cater for the national needs aiming to benefit the whole society. Since synthetic biology is a cross-disciplinary field, researchers from different areas should strengthen communication and cooperation to promote the development of synthetic biology in China. Scientists in China have the ability to make great achievements in this field and we look forward that synthetic biology will bring great impact on our future economical and social development. ",
