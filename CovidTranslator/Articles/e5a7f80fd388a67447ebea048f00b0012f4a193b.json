As of now, many countries have been severely affected, partly because of slow responses to the crisis, ill-preparedness of their health system, and the fragile health infrastructure and the shortage of protective equipment. This note evaluates various scenarios, based on an estimation of number of identified and unidentified infected cases, and examines the effectiveness of different policy responses to contain this pandemic. Our result, based on an estimation of the model for Iran, show that in many instances the number of unidentified cases, including asymptomatic individuals, could be much bigger than the reported numbers. The results confirm that in such circumstances, social distancing alone cannot be an effective policy unless a large portion of the population confine themselves for an extended period of time, which is not only difficult to implement, but it could also prove extremely costly and damaging to the economy. An alternative policy, this note argues, is to couple effective social distancing with extensive testing, even to those who are asymptomatic, and isolate the identified cases actively. Otherwise, many lives will be lost, and the health system will collapse, adding to the ongoing economic troubles that many countries have started to encounter.",

The testing, should be targeted to geographic locations that the virus is wide spread, to airports and cruise ships, to road travellers, and anyone who has been in areas that are hot spot or has been in any contact with someone in affected locations over the past two weeks. The strategy should not \"just\" focus on those that show symptoms but should include \"all\" who might have been exposed.

We developed a variant of the SEIR model for the epidemic dynamic and control of COVID-19, using seven state variables and a minimal number of parameters to avoid over-fitting. The model is estimated for Iran, but it can be estimated for other country examples. It is different from a standard SEIR model by distinguishing hidden and identified infected cases. Indeed, standard SEIR models are estimated assuming that all infected people are reported. Such an assumption for the novel coronavirus pandemic is largely unreasonable, as many infected people show no or mild symptoms and as the testing procedure is not available in mass, many remain undetected. Thus, we divide infected compartment into Infected but not reported (I) and infected, detected and reported (Q) groups. We assume that identified cases are less infectious by taking self-precautionary measures and/or due to hospitalization. While unidentified cases can largely continue to infect the rest of the population. The model, therefore, 3 .

The authorities refused to quarantine areas affected by the outbreak and instead asked people to remain inside their houses on a voluntary basis, without any enforcing measures. Some religious sites remained open until mid-March. Unlike every year in late March (Persian New Year) the authorities urged the public to avoid travelling for the two-weeks holidays. However, according the official statistics, roads were still busy, and millions of people travelled, making the self-quarantine policy ineffective. In the absence of firm suppression policies 4 , we simulate the model based on the changes in the behaviors of the public by comparing i) the baseline or uncontrolled scenario, ii) with complete isolation of identified infected cases, iii) case isolation and self-quarantine, iv) intensive testing, identification of cases and quarantine, v) a combination of previous scenarios, vi) abandoning shelter-in-place policy one month after the peak of the epidemic under scenario v. Scenario (ii) is implemented by assuming \u03b2 Q = 0, meaning that as soon as an individual is reported as infected, all necessary measures are taken to stop contagion from this person to other people. China forced hospitalization of all \"confirmed cases\" and not just those who required hospital care, to reduce onward transmission in the household and potentially in other social settings.

Table 1 reports the number of death and recoveries at end-2020. Obviously, the combined set of policies, described in scenario v yields the best outcome with the lowest fatality and infected cases. Comparing scenario iii and iv, we conclude that a combined intensive testing, identifying infected individuals, and quarantine is a more effective policy than just a shelter-in-place policy. As discussed, scenario vi is the same as scenario v, assuming that the authorities end the shelterin-place policy 30-days after the peak of the pandemic. Unfortunately, under such scenario the death toll can be still multiplied by 4 times compared to the scenario where social interactions are just reduced and kept low by 50 percent. If the social interaction is increased to normal times, the death toll can be 15 times larger than in the scenario v. Many governments are impatient to open their countries businesses. They are rightly worried about the economic cost of a prolonged shutdown of economic activity. There are already outcry across countries by those who have lost their jobs. Many in low income and developing countries cannot afford to stay in home for long, since there are not enough safety nets to protect the most vulnerable. On the other hand, even in advanced economies, the ripple effect of a lengthy and uncertain shutdown of the economy is too painful. This is the reason that countries' authorities have to start implementing a broad range of decisive actions.",

Unlike the current approach in some countries, where only the symptomatic cases are tested, the authorities should provide intensive and extensive testing and try to identify almost-all infected cases. This process would identify asymptomatic but infected cases and stop them of spreading the virus. This is key for a successful containment policy. Given the geographic distribution of the pandemic, the testing should focus on the most affected locations first and then expand to those people who have visited the hot spots or have been in contact with anyone in those areas, while everyone practice social distancing. A combination policy, as discussed above, not only reduces the number of infected, and ultimately the death toll, but it shorten the shelter-in-place period and consequently lowers the economic cost.",
