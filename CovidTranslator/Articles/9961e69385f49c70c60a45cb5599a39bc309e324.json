Outbreak Column 12 touched on the period in the 1940s before the organism was first recognised as a nosocomial pathogen. Noted in the column was the inability to control these organisms because of the inadequate healthcare environments and some healthcare practices therein. Also noted was the periodic decline of epidemic strains such as occurred in the 1970s (Curran, 2014) . Outbreak Column 13 focuses on guidelines from the 1980s onwards which were produced for infection prevention and control teams (IPCTs) to use to prevent outbreaks of (and hospitals becoming endemic with) MRSA. As IPCTs are already embarking on our next major challenge, the control of carbapenemase-producing enterobacteriaceae (CPE), it is an opportune moment to take stock and muse. This Outbreak Column is therefore a reflection, with acknowledged hindsight bias, from an infection control practitioner who over the 25 years has tried to implement each of the guideline iterations. This review has resulted in a personal consideration of what I would do differently if the situation was repeated.",

Table 1 lists the guideline titles, the number of pages and the time between productions. Each new guideline increased in size from the previous version although the number of topic areas did not itself alter much. What is noticeable from the titles at least is that the 1986, 1990 and 2006 guidelines are attempting to control the organisms; and only the 1959 and 1998 guidelines are explicitly trying to control infections. It is possible that the authors considered that controlling organism transmission was synonymous with controlling infection -this will be further examined later. It is not until the 2006 guidelines that the word 'prevention' appears in the title. Latterly in 2008, guidelines were produced to prevent and control infections caused by S. aureus -not specifying a resistance patternbut the possession of the Panton-Valentine Leucocidin toxin; this guidance is not covered in Outbreak Column 13.",

It may be necessary to close wards to new admissions, particularly to surgical or intensive care patients.\" (Anon, 1986) This was certainly a control measure that could bring health care to an abrupt halt. It would seem reasonable to conclude that the assumption behind this recommendation was that significant transmission occurred from both recognised and unrecognised carriers, and that all colonised persons could be identified, isolated and decolonised. However, later on in the text the authors indicate that there was little or no expectation of successful carrier eradication of EMRSA (and thereby control of the spread of the organism). Despite the 'screen all' policy, comments in the decolonisation section stated that 'eradication of carriage is difficult and may often fail'. There is something illogical here given that such efforts were taken to find carriers yet eradication methods were considered so unlikely to succeed. What was highlighted as being of paramount importance to limiting the spread of EMRSA was the isolation of infected or colonised patients who were transferred from affected hospitals. The guidance stressed that MRSA control would be further aided by the restriction of inter-hospital movements (Anon, 1986) .",

Consequently, for all their efforts IPCTs were always closing the stable door after several horses had bolted. At that time IPCTs would aim to make the best decisions given the resources available to them. With hindsight, occasions when there was a 'failure to isolate' due to unavailable isolation rooms should have made its way onto some kind of risk register much earlier.",

Although the specifics of these 'problems' were not discussed there was a significant relaxation of the 'screen all' approach that had been advocated in 1986. Screening was now reserved for patients and staff in 'critical areas such as surgical intensive care areas' (Anon, 1990) . Of note there was no specification in this iteration as to who was included in the term 'staff'. It was also noted that in a hospital with an endemic problem it may not be 'economically feasible to screen after single isolates'. Note the rationale for 'not screening', i.e. that the hospital might not be able to afford it -efficacy and patient safety arguments were not put forward (Anon, 1990) .",

The 1986 guidelines had focused considerable efforts on control measures for agency nurses who could work in several different hospitals (endemic and non-endemic) within a week. If one such nurse shed vast quantities of the organism there could be widespread transmission in several hospitals and yet extensive outbreak screening of permanent staff might find no carriers.

Expectations of successful decolonisation were still low and there was still an inability to reliably and promptly detect colonised persons. There were still too few siderooms to enable isolation of patients who were recognised as being at Opinion/ Comment a higher risk of having MRSA. Even though the healthcare environment had improved markedly since the first guidance in 1959, clinical teams and IPCTs were still doing the best they could with what they had -which was still insufficient to gain control. These guidelines were focused on minimising transmission. Although there is a section titled 'Prevention of spread of infection between patients' the contents therein were only about preventing transmission -there were no control measures to prevent infections. Local surveillance or epidemiology was extremely primitive at that time and generally not computerised. (In the early 1990s I was able to produce a computer-generated line list, but to do so each morning I had to load DOS on to the computer (one floppy disc), then load the software onto the computer (two floppy discs), then load the file on to the computer (one floppy disc) and only then could I produce one line list (using DOS commands; there was no mouse and no pull-down menus).

The ICNA joined the Hospital Infection Society and the British Society for Antimicrobial Chemotherapy as part of the guideline production working party (Anon, 1998) . The working party pointed out that 'in the light of changes in epidemiology, increasing prevalence and finite hospital resources available to control spread there was pressure to re-convene' (Anon, 1998) . I can find no explanation in the guidelines for the dropping of the epidemic 'E' from the title. Reference is made about the requirements for specific MRSA strains to be labelled epidemic, i.e. 'When epidemic strains have spread in two or more hospitals within the UK, they have been numbered sequentially, i.e., EMRSA-1, EMRSA-2, etc' (Anon, 1998) . The 1998 guidelines were, in particular, for the control of two epidemic strains which had emerged to become a significant problem since the 1990s -EMRSA-15 and EMRSA-16 (Anon, 1998) .",

Preventing spread was considered important to reduce the additional costs of treatment and of control.

One IPCT found that effective ward closures enabled them to contain multiple outbreaks of MRSA -but ultimately they 'lost the war' (Farrington et al, 1998) . A different approach was evidently needed. The main difference in the 1998 guideline was that the decision-making of what was to be implemented had switched from what the guideline writers' specifically advocated, to what the IPCTs locally decided were necessary given all the factors in the healthcare systems they managed. The impracticalities of the inflexible 1986 and 1990 guidelines had resulted in a 1998 approach that again improved the degree to which implementation was now possible -however, it did not improve the extent to which implementation was likely to lead to control of the organism. Once again the authors made no claims that their advocated guidance was likely to be successful in gaining control. Even though 'infection' was included in the title of the document, the 1998 guidelines remained focused on preventing spread and not on preventing infections. There was still no instruction to understand what type of infections MRSA was causing and as a consequence what should be done to prevent what was on the patients getting inside them.",

Secondly, on Friday 5 November 2004, the Secretary of State for Health, John Reid MP, in a landmark announcement stated 'I expect MRSA bloodstream infection rates to be halved in our hospitals by 2008' (BBC, 2004) .

Once again the same professional groups made up the working party and contributed to the revision of the twice-previously revised guidance. The explicit task was 'to revise the guidelines with an enhanced focus on the prevention and control of MRSA infections in the UK' (Coia et al, 2006) . This time the production process was open. The databases were used and the search questions were listed. The searches looked back to 1996, which meant that some of the rich vein of learning on Staphylococcus aureus in the 1960s and 1970s was neglected (Williams et al, 1960) . Again acknowledging hindsight bias, it is now possible to determine that these questions were perhaps incomplete. The word 'infection' appears only once in the four questions asked: 'To what extent does environmental cleaning with detergent or detergent plus disinfectant contribute to the control of MRSA infection and what are the costs?' (Coia et al, 2006) . The other questions related to screening of patients, surveillance and isolation or cohorting procedures. These remaining three questions all have the same tail, i.e. 'contribute to reducing the incidence of MRSA transmission.' Ergo, the searches looked for the efficacy of four interventions (surveillance, screening, isolation and cleaning or disinfection) and not specifically at how MRSA infections arise or how to prevent them. I would argue that preventing transmission and preventing infections are not synonymous. I also think it would have been helpful to have started with a discourse of the problem before examining the value of possible solutions, i.e. 'How does cross-transmission, and cross-infection, with MRSA (and or MSSA) arise in hospital environments?'",

Four years after the introduction of control measures the Geneva hospitals were experiencing similar levels of MRSA to that experienced in the two years before their introduction (Harbarth et al, 2000) .

This was a plausible explanation, but so was the explanation that controlling transmission will only get you so far -to prevent the remaining infections you need a concurrent strategy directed specifically at infection prevention.

Some of what had vexed earlier guideline writers, e.g. agency nurses and S. aureus dispersers received scant or no attention. The agency nurse statement was abridged to: 'The special difficulties and risks posed by agency and locum staff should be considered (Category 1b)' (Coia et al, 2006) . However, the specifics of the considerations are limited and no active recommendations are made. The identification of dispersers deemed necessary in the 1986, 1990 and 1998 guidance was no longer included in the 2006 guidance (Anon, 1986 (Anon, , 1990 (Anon, , 1998 Coia et al, 2006) . There were advantages to identifying MRSA at that time. Specifically there was a high degree of assurance that isolation of MRSA equated to evidence of nosocomial cross transmission. As a consequence its use as a marker of infection prevention and control was advocated and exploited in some areas (Curran et al, 2002) .",

There was an embryonic approach to quality improvement included within the discussion with the illustration of statistical process control charts (SPCs) and a cause and effect chart (Coia et al, 2006) . The SPC and cause and effect charts were mine, and I will be eternally grateful to the only mention of invasive devices in the entire document, which appears in the cause and effect chart 'Avoid use of invasive devices -remove any devices as soon as possible' (Coia et al, 2006) . Of note however the overall aim in the cause and effect chart was minimising cross transmission. We were getting there but preventing infections was still subservient to preventing transmission. In the years since the publication of the 2006 guidance the embryonic quality improvement approach ultimately developed and has borne fruit (perhaps alongside a naturally declining MRSA (Wyllie et al, 2011; Curran, 2014) ).",

An examination of these MRSA guidelines (with acknowledged hindsight bias), has identified what I think needs further attention. This can be summed up as the guideline purpose, the expectations and the impact assessment. The purpose of the guidance (despite what titles said) was to prevent transmission when what was required with equal focus was the prevention of infection. Because expectations of success were so low, there was little to be gained (and much to be lost) by advocating draconian control measures. Also, as the advocated control measures were so extensive, an impact assessment should have been done concurrently to provide confirmation that these control measures were at least feasible.",

The guidance writers' goal therefore is to design-in IPC without significant impact on the healthcare system's purpose. To do this a wider literature than that produced by the IPC community is required, e.g. systems thinking and human factors sciences.",

There are now accepted and accredited methodologies (Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network, 2011). However, evidence-based guideline production for IPC will always be an imperfect art. This is because the IPC literature is itself imperfect; new or re-emerging organisms may not necessarily behave the same as genetically related organisms that have gone before. Ergo, control measures could be either in excess of, or insufficient, to gain control. For example, it was not until outbreaks of SARS arose, and the evidence on the modes of transmission was gathered, including the implications of super-spreaders, that control measures sufficient to gain control were introduced (Seto et al, 2003) . Similarly, the MRSAs from the 1980s onwards behaved differently to those that went before. It is accepted that data on new and emerging pathogens is often weak and sometimes nonexistent; nevertheless, as John Snow demonstrated, control measures can still be very effective (Hennekens and Buring, 1987) .",
