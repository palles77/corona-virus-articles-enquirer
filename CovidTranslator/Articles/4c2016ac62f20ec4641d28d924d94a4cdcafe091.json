Flexibility with respect to the peptide tag is essential since no single tag suites all purposes. This report describes the usage of two short peptides from the SARS-associated coronavirus nucleocapsid (SARS-N) protein as protein tags. Plasmids for the generation of tagged proteins were generated by ligating synthetic oligonucleotides for the peptide-coding regions downstream of the protein coding sequence. The data show recognition of prokaryotically expressed HIV-1 Gag/p24 fusion protein by Western blot and efficient affinity purification using monoclonal antibodies against the tags. The SARS peptide antibody system described presents an alternative tagging opportunity in the growing field of protein science.",

To facilitate analysis, solubility and handling, proteins are commonly fused to large fusion partners such as the Escherichia coli maltose binding protein [1] or the glutathione-S-transferase [2] or to small oligopeptides. Protein tagging with a short peptide to which an antibody is available has first been described by Munro and Pelham [3] . It allows detection and affinity purification of a protein in the absence of a specific antibody against the protein itself. Use of a tag is of particular advantage if no specific antiserum is available for instance with proteins that are poorly immunogenic [4] or when it is necessary to distinguish expression of a transgene from protein production from endogenic loci [5] .",

For instance, the presence of a series of histidine-containing products can make purification of the desired His-tagged protein difficult since the eluate may contain impurities from less specific binding events [12] . For the same reason, use of an anti-His antibody for detection of recombinant proteins in immunoblot or immunofluorescence analysis can be problematic as non-spe-cific reactions might occur. In addition, purification may be inefficient if protein folding prevents accessibility of the His tag [13] . The anti-FLAG antibody preferentially recognizes its epitope when expressed at the N-terminus of a protein [14] . This limits the use of the system for certain purification procedures. C-myc antibodies may cross-react with other structures and bind non-specifically [12] . In addition, Fan et al. [15] observed detection of c-myc-tagged proteins in immunofluorescence analysis that could not be confirmed by Western blot. Finally, peptide tags may be problematic in certain expression systems [12, 13, 15, 16] or affect the function of the protein depending on the size and amino acid composition of the tag [17] . Therefore, efforts are constantly being made to provide alternative peptide tagging systems [18, 19] .",
