This model was further utilized to design small molecules that are expected to block an ATPase catalytic pocket thus inhibit the enzymatic activity. Binding sites for various functional groups were identified in a series of molecular dynamics calculation. Their positions in the catalytic pocket were used as constraints in the Cam-bridge structural database search for molecules having the pharmacophores that interacted most strongly with the enzyme in a desired position. The subsequent MD simulations followed by calculations of binding energies of the designed molecules were compared to ATP identifying the most successful candidates, for likely inhibitors-molecules possessing two phosphonic acid moieties at distal ends of the molecule.",

            "text": "Over the last 20 years many new viruses were identified, and many mutations resulting in increased virulence of the known viruses were discovered. HIV, HCV, influenza, and SARS are examples of diversity of the biohazard on the Earth. Such threads constitute a challenge to develop fast and productive methods to predict new target proteins, their functions, and active sites, as well as create the need for improved drug design procedures. The information gathered by molecular biologists is often stored in publicly available protein databases, like Swiss-Prot-with nonredundant protein sequences with accurate functional annotations [1] -or PDB-with macromolecular structural data [2] . Therefore such databases can serve as mines of information and speed up the process of drug design. In this study we utilized the information gathered in these databases to address the recent threat caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). SARS is a life-threatening form of pneumonia characterized by high fever, nonproductive cough, chills, myalgia, lymphopenia, and progressing infiltrates on chest radiography [3] . Between 2002 and 2003, an epidemic emerged that, facilitated by international air travel, spread within a few weeks from its origin in Guangdong Province, China, to many other countries. WHO reported over 8,000 SARS cases and nearly 800 deaths resulting from the infection with the SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS CoV) [4] . Studies on SARS CoV resulted in identification of protein targets for potential drugs, which included SARS CoV protease, polymerase and helicase [5] . In this study we focused on SARS CoV Hel (helicase)-the enzyme which couples energy from nucleotide triphosphate (NTP) hydrolysis with the unwinding of duplex viral nucleic acid obtained after replication.",

            "text": "We used SARS CoV Hel polypeptide sequence from SARS CoV replicase polyprotein 1ab (UniProt accession number P59641) as an input for protein structure prediction Meta Server [6] . The Meta Server collects output from diverse structure prediction methods and generates a consensus model using the 3D-Jury approach. This approach has proven efficient and effective in successful fold prediction for many proteins [7] [8] [9] . In brief, the 3D-Jury utilizes groups of models generated by a set of servers predicting protein structure. All models are compared with each other and a similarity score is assigned to each pair, which equals to the number of C a atom pairs that are within 3.5 \u00c5 after optimal superposition. 3D-Jury selects the model that has the highest average similarity to other models in the collected set. The average similarity expressed as the average number of superimposed C a atoms is also a reliable measure of the accuracy of the model. If this values is above 50 the selected model has approximately a 90% chance to belong to the same fold class as the native structure of the target protein [9] . The 3D-Jury system is used to select a correct initial template for full atom modeling conducted usually with Modeller [10] as was also done in this case. The main goal for Modeller is the correct loop closure and side chain placement. Advanced minimization options feasible in Modeller are usually disabled to prevent a distortion of the correctly aligned core and functional residues.",

            "text": "The application of computer-based models using analytical potential energy functions within the framework of classical mechanics has proven effective and powerful in studying large-scale molecules like proteins or nucleic acids [11] . The binding of small molecule ligands to giant protein targets is central to numerous biological functions. Thus, docking ligands to the binding site of a receptor is often performed using points of complementarities between host and guest molecules. The accurate prediction of the binding modes between the ligand and protein is of utmost importance in modern structure-based drug design. Moreover, drug design requires advanced force field based on non-covalent interactions between molecules, covalent bonding, charges, and atomic volume. Only then such a force field is powerful enough for analysis and prediction of molecular interactions. Despite various limitations and crude approximations molecular mechanics (MM) and molecular dynamics (MD) methods have been used to study a wide variety of phenomena, including structure and dynamics of simple and complex structures, thermodynamics of ligands binding to proteins, conformational transitions in nucleic acids, and many others [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] . Recent developments in hybrid quantum mechanics (QM) and MM method created new opportunities in more accurate assessment of interaction energies [22] [23] [24] [25] . In particular ONIOM method nicely resolved problems with QM and MM boundary and was successfully utilized in studies on mechanism of enzymatic reactions or calculations of interaction energies between proteins and their ligands [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] .",

All models are compared with each other and a similarity score is assigned to each pair, which equals to the number of C-alpha atom pairs that are within 3.5 \u00c5 after optimal superposition. The final 3D-Jury score of a model equals to the average similarity scores of considered model pairs. It can be expected that highly reliable models produced by fold recognition methods have less ambiguities in the alignments to their template structures, which would result in higher similarity between models and consequently in higher 3D-Jury scores. The final score of the model can be also calculated on a per residue basis enabling the detection of well and less well modeled regions. The application of the 3D-Jury approach on the sequence of the SARS CoV Hel ATPase catalitic domain resulted in the selection of models based on three template structure: 1PJR [39] , 1UAA [40] , and 1W36 [41] . In order to obtain the full atom three dimensional model the side chains and missing loops were rebuild with Modeller program [10, 42, 43] . The final model was energy minimized using Amber force field [44] [45] [46] [47] .",

Therefore, we could verify if simulations with TINKER package and Amber force field parameters are capable to identify ATP binding site correctly. In this test we derived ATP conformations observed in complexes with macromolecules with the help of PDB-Ligand database, where 435 models of ATP molecule interacting with proteins were collected, based on 205 entries in PDB. These ATP structures clustered at 1 \u00c5 RMS deviation led to identification of 37 unique ATP conformations. Then, we randomly rotated ATP molecule in a given conformation and placed it in a random position on the surface of the SARS CoV helicase. One hundred repetitions for each conformation generated starting points (3,700) for the initial energy pre-minimization, where protein coordinates were kept frozen, while flexible ATP molecules were docked to the enzyme. After initial MM minimization with Amber force field, the resulting ATP molecules were clustered at 1 \u00c5 RMS deviation identifying unique positions of ATP in complex with SARS CoV Hel. From this set one hundred structures of the lowest energy were selected for further simulations. These structures served as starting points for MD simulations with temperature varying from 1,000 to 0 K (simulated annealing) over 0.1 ps, followed by MD simulations over 0.2 ls at 273 K. In all these MD simulations only the positions of C a carbon atoms of polypeptide chain were frozen, while the positions of other atoms of the protein, and all atoms of ATP, or putative inhibitors were optimized. Having had the MD results, the subsequent energy minimization was performed. The comparison of ATP binding energies led to identification of the most favorable mode of interaction between the protein and ATP.",

Then simulated annealing procedure and MD simulations, as the one used for ATP, were carried out, followed by energy minimization optimizing the positions of the functional groups (see Fig. 2 ).",

Because the two phosphate groups possessed the highest binding energies, at least twice as favorable as any other small molecule, we focused our search on molecules possessing P atom in their structure [61] . The obtained hits were investigated and modified manually to fit into SARS CoV Hel ATP binding site so that 17 molecules were selected for further studies. These molecules were placed in the active side of the protein, so that two desired functional groups were in the positions identified by the attractors for the corresponding small molecules. In the next step MD simulations with temperature varying from 1,000 to 0 K (simulated annealing) over 0.1 ps were carried out, followed by MD simulations over 0.2 ls at 273 K, and energy minimization.

The pronounced dependence of interaction energies calculated with MM methods on dielectric constant suggests that electrostatic interactions are strongly overestimated. Thus, we decided to employ quantum mechanical methods to calculate interaction energies between ligands and the amino acids residues surrounding them. Because of the size of the systems we performed ONIOM two layer QM: MM calculations (see Fig. 4 ) using Gaussian 03 program [63] . Amino acid residues within 3.6 \u00c5 from any atom of an inhibitor together with this inhibitor were treated quantum mechanically with AM1 [64] [65] [66] and PM3 [67, 68] semiempirical methods, while the remaining part of the protein was kept frozen and described with the use of Amber force field. In ONIOM extrapolation scheme energy of large system calculated at high level of theory is approximated as energy of large system calculated at low level + energy of small system calculated at high level-energy of small system calculated at low level. Thus, computationally very expensive calculations for large system at high level of theory are avoided.

However, in the SARS CoV Hel the motif I is completely conserved (GPPGTGKS). The side chain of the key lysine (Lys288) occupies the position that will be occupied by the bound Mg 2+ ion when the NTP-Mg 2+ complex binds the SARS CoV helicase. Upon binding NTP-Mg 2+ , the lysine side chain contacts the b phosphate of the bound NTP and can stabilize the transition state during catalysis [72] . Replacement of this residue in mutant helicases resulted in large decrease of the rate of NTP hydrolysis. Mutated helicases were unable to catalyse duplex nucleic acid unwinding [76] .",

            "text": "As it was mentioned earlier, mutations in motives, which are responsible for the binding of the terminal phosphate group, eliminate the NTP hydrolytic activity of the helicase. On the basis of these results one could expect that a reduction of accessibility of the NTPbinding site for NTP should lead to inhibition of the NTPase and, consequently, of the helicase activity of the SARS CoV NTPase/helicase [80] . Therefore, the compounds that reduce the activity of the enzyme could act as inhibitors of virus replication [81] . In this study we attempted the design of molecules that are expected to bind in the catalytic pocket. After, we had identified attractors for various functional groups and selected the positions where these groups are most strongly bound, we searched CSD [58] for molecules having the desired functional groups in a given position (see Fig. 9 ). We searched for molecules having three or two functional groups at a given distance from one another. Because phosphate groups were bound at least twice as strongly as any other small molecule (no surprise owing the role in ATP hydrolysis) we focused on searching for molecules possessing at least one P atom. By modifying the obtained hits, we designed a set of molecules that are suspected to bind to the SARS CoV Hel (see Fig. 10 ). The subsequent calculations for these compounds revealed the binding modes of these molecules in the catalytic pocket and provided data for assessment of binding energies. The binding energies obtained in Amber force field calculations seem to be non-sensually high, in particular when compared with AM1 and PM3 values. Nevertheless, all computational methods predict that in the set of the investigated molecules there are molecules that interact with SARS CoV Hel stronger than ATP. Comparison of the results obtained from different computational methods (see Table 3 for AM1 and PM3 results and Table 4 for Amber force field results) identifies molecules whose protein ligand interactions are more favorable than for ATP. Molecules 3, 4, 11, 13, 16, 17 are likely to compete with ATP for the access to the active site, thus serve as inhibitors. Detailed interactions between these ligands and SARS CoV Hel are presented in Fig. 11 .",

On the other hand, the inspection of specific interactions reveals that 3 is capable of forming strong interactions within catalytic pocket of SARS CoV Hel. In the energetically favored position the NH 2 + group of Arg443 interacts with phosphonate group of 3 via a salt bridge. The hydrogen atom connected to C a from Ser539 approaches the aromatic ring of 3 perpendicularly creating a CH-p interaction.

Molecule 13 possesses three phosphate moieties each interacting with arginine side chains via salt bridges. It should be noted that 13 has geminal phosphate moieties, which are not likely to be stable in aqueous solution. However, structures deposited in CSD are biased towards unusual molecules and the molecules with geminal phosphates were present in the set of molecules that we obtained in our search (HIBYIA, QEQNOP, QURYAD, XOBMOQ). Nevertheless, this molecule in all computational methods employed in our study binds to SARS CoV Hel more strongly than ATP. The phosphate closer to phenyl ring interacts with Arg409 and additionally with OH group of Ser310. Another phosphate forms a bonding with NH group of Arg443 and His290, while the last phosphate forms a salt bridge with NH group of Arg567 and additionally much weaker interaction with CH of Gly285. NH group of guanidine part of 13 forms a salt bridge with carboxylate group of Asp115. The position of the phenyl ring of 13 is stabilized due to CH-p interaction with CH of Ala313. In addition there is a close contact between ethyleneamine nitrogen atom and hydrogen atom attached to C a of Gly279.",
