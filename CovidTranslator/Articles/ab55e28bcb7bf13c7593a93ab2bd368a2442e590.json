Predictive, preventive, and personalized medicine (PPPM) not only highlights a patient-tailored approach by choosing the right medication, the right dose at the right time point but it as well essentially requires early identification, by the means of complex and state-of-the-art technologies of unmanifested pathological processes in an individual, in order to deliver targeted prevention early enough to reverse manifestation of a pathology. Such an approach can be achieved by taking into account clinical, pathological, environmental, and psychosocial characteristics of the patients or an individual who has a suboptimal health condition. Inappropriate modeling of chronic and complex disorders, in this context, may diminish the predictive potential and slow down the development of PPPM and consequently modern healthcare. Therefore, it is the common goal of PPPM and translational medicine to find the solution for the problem we present in our review. Both, translational medicine and PPPM in parallel, essentially need accurate surrogates for misleading animal models. This study was therefore undertaken to provide shreds of evidence against the validity of animal models. Limitations of current animal models and drug development strategies based on animal modeling have been systematically discussed. Finally, a variety of potential surrogates have been suggested to change the unfavorable situation in medical research and consequently in healthcare.",

Predictive diagnostics, targeted prevention, and personalization of medical services are the main objective of the predictive, preventive, and personalized medicine (PPPM). Translational medicine was introduced recently to emphasize the appropriate translation of knowledge from studies at the bench side to care at the bedside. Economic circumstances and missing political regulations are among the factors resulting in the blockage between the bench and bedside; to these, we should add the applicability of the bench studies as the foundation of clinical investigation and subsequent clinical trials. In order to efficiently indorse the translational medicine as the \"catalyzer\" for the practical implementation of the accumulated scientific achievements, an appropriate dialogue is essential between three clusters of \"clinician, clinical investigator, and PPPM relevant professional groups,\" \"the bench scientists,\" and \"industry and policy-makers\" [1, 2] .",

            "text": "Animal models made a revolution in biomedical research [3] . Plenty of treatment modalities were developed on the basis of animal experimentations. Meanwhile, there is an increasing number of failed clinical trials, particularly on chronic and complex diseases that biased from the results of studies on inappropriate animal models [4, 5] . It is time to ask whether animal models truly predict human health conditions. While validity and acceptability of current successful trials and guidelines are debated in the 21st century because they are not patient tailored, how could we rely on animal models as an appropriate predictor of human conditions? Simplifying a complex system is inevitable to study the basis of a complex phenomenon. However, simplified models do not reflect all the properties of complex systems [4, 6] . When an animal model is used as the basis of a clinical trial, it is needed to mimic the complex properties of the patients. Otherwise, animal models might be misleading; consequently, a large number of therapeutic modalities might have lost in translation [7] . This study was therefore undertaken to provide shreds of evidence against the validity of animal models. It has been systematically discussed why the authors believe that it is time to re-evaluate the validity of animal experimentations. Although plenty of state-of-the-art disease modeling techniques have been introduced recently, their acceptance and application in the medical science society are scarce; nevertheless validity of these modern modeling techniques needs further evaluation as well. There is a gap between bench and bedside that, unfortunately, has not been appropriately filled with the animal models. In our contribution, we want to provide relevant facts which clearly show that translational medicine and PPPM need accurate surrogate for misleading animal models in order to increase the level of the future healthcare. In this article, we review the knowledge on inappropriate modeling of chronic and complex disorders, which is very important point for the predictive, preventive, and personalized medicine. The translation medicine in this point has to deal with this problem in order to support further and smooth development of PPPM. It is absolutely essential the experts in all fields of medicine, and beyond, are aware of the described problems. The predictions in PPPM and potential preventive actions may very well be compromised if inappropriate modeling is being widely used in numerous cases, let alone the creation of personalized models for an individual patient. There is a great need and potential for fundamental changes in strategies, leading to substantial improvements in future healthcare.",

Similarly, kidney transplantation is not tolerated in dogs while it has an acceptable tolerance in humans [11] . Moreover, the toxic effects of statins in animals delayed their clinical use in humans that tolerate them very well [12] .

Our efforts in the war against cancer were not encouraging in terms of therapeutic approaches; in fact, it was preventive approaches that showed promising effects. Genetic, molecular, cellular, and immunologic differences between models and human beings made them poor prognostic modalities [4] . False positivity of rodent studies in this case was around 95% [25, 26] . In reality, rodent cancer models is believed to be invalid and financially indefensible [27] . Only 8% success rate in the translation of cancer studies has been reported; actually, 85% of all clinical trials failed before starting phase 3 trials. Among studies which enter phase 3, half of them were withdrawn [28, 29] . Only a little number of these studies are adopted and the others are being withdrawn after sacrificing their victims [7, 30] . Most of the cancer animal models are suffering from inappropriate modeling. Inoculation of malignant cells (cell lines) is the most common current method of malignancy modeling. This model does not reflect the prolonged complex process of developing a malignancy. Recently, knocked out animal models and animal models with special mutations have been introduced [7, 29, 31] ; although these models sufficiently mimic genetic background of malignant tumors, the epigenetic role and the role of environment were not reflected in these models. Additionally, there are several probable genotypes for a single phenotype of malignancy.",

The 8th edition of the AJCC tumor, node, and metastase (TNM) breast cancer staging system delivers a flexible platform for prognostic classification based on traditional anatomic factors, which may be modified and enhanced with respect to patient biomarkers and other prognostic panel data. Compared to the previous version, a variety of genetic and molecular factors has been incorporated to the current version, among them are HER2, estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and also multigene panels such as Oncotype DX [35, 36] . There is a difference between \"silent\" carriers of tumor lesions and patients who are predisposed to disease development and progression; a \"fertile\" microenvironment that supports the tumorigenesis, tumor invasion, and metastasis can distinguish between them. The mechanisms \"fertilizing\" the microenvironment for the cancer advancement are not addressed in animal models but it is very well addressed by innovative PPPM strategies in cancer [1, 37, 38] .",

Thus, current protocols of ALS treatment are a range of broad-spectrum antibiotics and general antiinflammatory agents.

For example, clofibrate, nafenopin, phenobarbital, and reserpine cause cancer in old but not young rats [80] [81] [82] . Different depression pathophysiology in pre-and postmenopausal women is another example. Menopausal status barely modeled if any in animal modeling. As another example, it has been repeatedly shown that premenopausal women with breast cancer have a higher risk for brain metastasis development. Thus, the premenopausal status at the time of breast cancer diagnosis is considered as an additional risk factor for the brain metastatic lesions which were not reflected in animal models of breast cancer [32, 38] . It is time to ask how could we rely on the results of animal experiments with such significant inter-and intra-species discrepancies.",

Subsequently, it has been shown that CD4 + effector memory T cells (TEM) were responsible for the cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and multi-organ failure in the studied patients [28] . As rodents were stored under very clean circumstances, they had no multiple exposures to infectious microorganisms; hence, TEM cell accumulation did not happen in them. Unfortunately, studies in monkeys also failed to show these adverse effects because of the diversity of their immune system compared to the human.

Ebola outbreaks in American monkey colonies infected a number of lab workers [85] .

Furthermore, working with animals is accompanied by several serious problems, such as the production of new serotypes, genetically drifted viruses, and contamination of biological products. For example, Simian virus 40 infected polio vaccines; as a known carcinogen, it has infected millions of Americans [86] .

A large number of responsible factors have been suggested for developing Alzheimer and among them are aging, inflammation, oxidative stress, vascular abnormalities, and amyloid depositions. Surprisingly, lifestyle, nutrition, education, academic achievements, and even career are also related to Alzheimer development [94] [95] [96] . Now it is time to ask, how could we synthesize such a complex, chronic, multi-factorial disease of an extremely complex organ (human brain) in a mouse model? Is a transgenic model such as amyloid precursor protein transgenic mouse model a suitable model for human Alzheimer disease [97] [98] [99] ? It has been shown that patients with Down syndrome develop Alzheimer earlier than the normal population due to having three copies of chromosome 21 and hence three copies of amyloid precursor protein (APP) gene. However, does it mean that Alzheimer in Down syndrome is equal to Alzheimer in elderly?! Does an Alzheimer model, which was developed by means of applying a mitochondrial toxin to a rat, is a good representative of Alzheimer in a Nobel laureate? How could we compare cognitive impairment in animals and human beings? We have to change the names of our models. Amyloid precursor protein transgenic mouse model is not an Alzheimer model. It is nothing but three copies of amyloid precursor protein deposition in the brain of a mouse. Conclusively, targeting a single aspect of a multifactorial disease such as Alzheimer will not appropriately model such a multifactorial chronic complex disease. In fact, none of age, oxidative stress, education, and other responsible genes were reflected in APP models of Alzheimer. It seems that in neuroscience, it is inevitable to fade out the stress of primary animal models. Weight of human trials is not comparable with the animal studies. Animal models might be misleading, if we do not revise our models' names and if not revising the concept of disease modeling instead of risk factor modeling.",

In our opinion, pharmaceutical companies, by means of presenting experimental studies as scientific evidence, can find their way to escape from complaints. Moreover, it seems that only after having their money back and when plenty of patients have suffered from unexpected side effects (as evidenced in plenty of phase 4 studies) they will withdraw selling their products, while, unfortunately, most of them are not willing to compensate for their fault. Huge amounts of money and resources are wasted, and pharmaceutical companies are not those who missed their resources. Actually, by providing false scientific pieces of evidence using inappropriate animal models and selling their drugs, they usually have their money back before phase 3 and 4 studies reveal hazards and inefficacy of their products. When the society complains against this malpractice, these inappropriate pieces of evidences will likely protect them from being sued.",

Furthermore, many of old-school researchers currently working with animals as experts in this field do not like to learn new methods such as tissue culture. Animal experiments are lucrative since there are several direct grants for animal research. Additionally, there are less ethical investigations during the conduction of the study and at the time of publication. Surprisingly, animal studies appear more scientific compared to clinical investigation. A very small number of clinician scientists exist, and tunnel vision of PhDs and lack of holistic knowledge of the diseases and its complex character are real challenges for current investigations.

For example, courtesy of Mendelian randomization studies, the causal relationship between high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and coronary heart disease (CHD) is in doubt now; this might explain why plenty of HDL-targeted medications failed to protect patients from developing CHD. Meanwhile, we should keep in mind that just like any other newly presented method, Mendelian randomization has its own limitations yet to be uncovered [117] [118] [119] [120] [121] .",

This approach may not be achieved unless taking into account clinical, pathological, environmental, and psychosocial characteristics of the patients. In order to accurately model the patients and make relevant predictions, it is necessary to reflect all complex characteristics of the patients into our models. Unfortunately, none of the complexity, chronicity, age, comorbidities, sex, genetic similarity, and environmental factors has been appropriately modeled in most of the current animal models. Hence, current animal models should be extensively revised and/or replaced by novel surrogates to achieve this goal. There might be plenty of agents, potentially safe in humans, that were not studied in people due to observed toxicity in animals. Also, there might be plenty of missed potential treatments which did not show efficacy in animals and hence never studied clinically; as mentioned above, plenty of currently approved treatments were delayed because of misleading animal models. Hence, we have to look back and re-evaluate hundreds of potential treatments. Some agents might not show efficacy in animals or might be lethal for them while they are well tolerated in humans and could be curative.",
