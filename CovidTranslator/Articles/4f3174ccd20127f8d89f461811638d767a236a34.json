Based on these observations it has been suggested that inhibition of proteolysis of the viral proteins would result in an inhibition of virus replication, and that antiproteinase agents could be used for this purpose [for review see 12,29] . In exploring this chemotherapeutic approach, we were able to suppress influenza and paramyxovirus infections through blockage of virus glycoprotein cleavage by antiproteinases [27, 28, 30, 33] , and beneficial results were obtained in clinical trials with antiproteinase aerosol inhalations during an influenza outbreak [32] . In this communication we present experimental data on the proposed chemotherapeutic approach against alphavirus infection.",

For this purpose cell monolayers were primarily infected with a low virus dose (10 -4 PFU/ceI1) and incubated with antiproteinase-containing medium. After incubation, the medium was removed and infected cells were processed for analysis of protein synthesis. Three patterns of polypeptide synthesis could be expected from such experiments. First, the virus replication might fail to be suppressed by the proteinase inhibitor; the monolayer, therefore, would be totally infected due to an effective multicycle virus replication, and the synthesis of virus proteins would be revealed. Second, the antiproteinase agent may suffer virus replication without concomitant toxicity for the host cells; host cell protein synthesis would be detected in these samples. Third, cell monolayer might be damaged by toxic concentrations of the proteinase inhibitors and in this case p?otein synthesis would be markedly reduced or even abolished.",

The results of these experiments are demonstrated in Fig. 1B ,C. It can be seen that TPCK concentrations up to 2-5-5.0 p,M did not cause antiviral activity; at concentrations of 7.5-12.5 gM, TPCK markedly reduced virus polypeptide synthesis without affecting host cell synthesis. Initial toxicity resulting in a decrease of protein synthesis was observed at 22.5 p,M TPCK and extensive cell damage was seen at concentrations of 25 laM or more (Fig. 1B, line 11; Fig. IC, lines 10-12) . It is also seen, that in samples where synthesis of virus polypeptides was reduced the synthesis of 75 kDa and 22 kDa host polypeptides was enhanced (Fig. 1B, lines 5-7) . Similar parallelism was denoted in cells treated by high concentrations of aprotinin-G ( Fig. 1 A, lines Table 1 ) and cells were processed to examine polypeptide synthesis. Cellular polypeptides synthesized were analyzed by electrophoresis in 10-15% gradient polyacrylamide gel. (Fig. IA, lines 5-7, 13-15 ). The data on the inhibition of virus protein synthesis by TPCK and aprotinin-G fully correlated with the results indicating a decrease of virus yield in culture fluid of antiproteinase-treated cells (see Table 1 of infection. These data confirmed that Sindbis virus replicated effectively in placebotreated mice. Almost complete inhibition of virus replication in brain and decrease of virus in blood of a majority of TPCK-treated mice was observed. On the third day after infection mean virus titers (log PFU/ml) in blood of placebo, aprotinin G, and TPCK-treated mice were 2.0 + 0.32, 1.2 __+ 0.16, and 0.95 + 0.21, respectively. Statistical significance of virus titer reductions in blood of TPCKotreated mice is P> 0.95. Mean virus titer in brain of control and TPCK-treated mice on day 5 of infection was 4.5 _ 0.58 and 1.2 + 0.53, respectively (mean values for three independent experiments); and this decrease was statistically significant (P> 0.999). A clear antiviral effect was observed at a TPCK dose of about 20 lag/mouse per day (Fig. 2) , whereas a less prominent effect was seen with TPCK at 5 lag/mouse per day (data not shown). The primary non-lethal toxic symptoms (such as hypothermia, reduced weight gain, etc.) were found to occur at TPCK doses of 80-100 lag/mouse per day (data not shown). Aprotinin-G did not cause reduction in the overall virus yield in mouse brain. However, aprotinin-G delayed virus replication in brain and brought about a slight reduction of viraemia (see Fig. 2 ).",

Inhibition of virus replication by TPCK is most likely due to an inhibition of the proteinases responsible for virus protein cleavage. High concentrations (> 100 laM) of TPCK have been reported to suppress proteolysis of the structural C/PE2/E1 polypeptides in Sindbis virus-infected cells [16] and block proteolytic processing of 270 kDa polyprotein, a precursor of a non-structural polymerase-associated nsP 1-nsP4 protein of Sindsbis virus [5] . Partial inhibition of proteolytic formation of viral proteins C, PE2 and E1 and appearance of high molecular weight precursors have been noted when cells infected with another alphavirus, Semliki Forest virus, were exposed to high concentrations (> 300 laM) of TPCK [ 15] . During examination of the antiproteolytical activity of TPCK in alphavirus-infected cells we did not see a reduction of C and E 1 proteolytic formation and only partial inhibition of PE2~E2 cleavage was obtained at non-toxic concentrations (10--20 laM) of TPCK (Zhirnov et al., unpublished results) . On the other hand, TPCK has been reported to interact selectively with structural proteins P and M of measles virus [9, 26] . A similar direct interaction of TPCK with alphavirus-specific protein(s) may affect their intracellular conversions.",

These results can be explained by a differential transport of the antiproteinase agents towards their viral targets in animals. TPCK is a low molecular weight phenylalanine analogue which is well known to penetrate effectively through the cell membrane. Thus TPCK distribution in the host organism is possibly adequate for antiviral targetting. Aprotinin is a 12 000 molecular weight polypeptide and its distribution in the organism therefore could be insufficient for inhibition of alphavirus replication. The antiviral activity of TPCK in animals as shown here is mainly of theoretical significance. Much more needs to be known about the toxicity and exact mode of action of the antiproteinase agents in the whole organism. Elucidation of these factors may allow the design of effective non-toxic antivirals with appropriate delivery to the viral targets.",
