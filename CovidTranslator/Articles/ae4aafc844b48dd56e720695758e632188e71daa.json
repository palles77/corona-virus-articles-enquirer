Furthermore, an event like this is also likely, if not certain, to occur again in the future. Unlike influenza epidemics, a pandemic occurs far less frequently. Influenza epidemics occur annually, during the winter period, caused by genetically drifting strains of influenza. Major changes of the virus, a so-called antigenic shift, may lead to new strains to which no immunity exists in the population and can hereby cause a pandemic. Three major pandemics occurred in the 20th century: the 1918-1919 'Spanish flu', the 1957-1958 'Asian flu', and the 1968-1969 'Hong Kong flu'. Although the recent situation eventually showed a relatively mild course of disease, a future pandemic might show a worse situation than the one we have seen now.",

A pandemic may urge health care workers to undergo certain or even large risks that others are not exposed to. That these risks are not fictional is shown by prior experiences with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), where 30% of the cases were among healthcare workers [2] . According to the World Health Organization (WHO) as well as commentators, a strong case can be made for adopting a duty to treat during a disease outbreak [3, 4] . This so-called duty to treat contagious patients when this poses risks of infection, and perhaps death, to the healthcare worker him-/herself has been hotly debated over time, but particularly in the context of HIV/AIDS. In the past 20 years, much of the discussion of the duty to treat has occurred in the context of HIV and has focused on the duty of physicians [5] [6] [7] [8] . The recent and emerging threats of other serious infectious diseases, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), drug-resistant tuberculosis, Ebola, and pandemic influenza, show this context to be too narrow [9] . Moreover, many current professional codes of ethics fail to provide explicit guidance sufficient to set policy or assure the public in the event of an infectious disease outbreak [4] . Up to what extent can we expect doctors to undergo risks in order to protect others, merely because they happen to be employed in health care? Does something like a duty to treat indeed exist in the context of an influenza pandemic and if so, what should we consider reasonable risks?",

Clarity on this subject in codes of ethics would prevent confusion and uncertainty among doctors concerning their rights and responsibilities. We will first clarify what we mean with a duty to treat. Then we review the arguments that have been put forward as possible grounds for the duty to treat. We discuss five arguments as proposed in the literature and add three potential arguments to this. As we conclude that there are valid reasons that support the view that such a duty exists, we will subsequently explore the scope and limits of the duty to treat in the case of an influenza pandemic. Although the duty to treat for health care workers may include a large range of professionals, we will in this paper restrict ourselves to (all) medical doctors.",

If there were a duty to treat in the event of an influenza pandemic, this could for example require medical doctors to work longer hours, to execute tasks beyond their ordinary responsibilities, and/or to expose themselves to risk of infection -and perhaps death -while providing care to patients [10] . That taking these risks is not an obvious and undisputed fact was shown by a recent survey, that pointed out that nearly 25% of doctors did not consider that they had a duty to work where doing so would pose risk to themselves or their family [11] .",

There is a continuum running from a very strict duty through weaker duties to supererogatory acts, i.e. ideals beyond the obligatory, a fulfilment of which can be perceived as praiseworthy or even heroic. In this paper, we refer to an absolute moral duty when a duty cannot be legitimately overruled by other moral considerations and to a prima facie moral duty when the duty must be fulfilled unless it conflicts, on a particular occasion, with an equal or stronger duty [12] . We now take a closer look to determine how the duty to treat, if there is any, should be grounded, how to interpret it, and if there would be limits to this duty.",

            "text": "A first possible ground for the duty to treat is explicit consent by physicians [9] . This implies that a physician gives explicit consent, for example by signing an employment contract, to assist in times of crisis. It would be difficult to maintain that an explicit consent made by physicians to do all the necessary acts as required in the case of an influenza pandemic would not have moral force. The difficulty, however, with grounding a duty to treat in an explicit consent particularly lies in the unspecified nature of such a consent: an explicit consent will hardly ever be sufficiently specified to coerce physicians to act in certain ways. Employment contracts for example seldom explicate all rights and duties of the employee in detail. So, even if there would be explicit consent to assist in times of crises, then this will probably still ask for a further filling in and interpretation for specific situations. In a crisis situation, one might be called upon to perform tasks that are not described in the contract, or that are described only vaguely. Should we, then, consider this to be explicit consent? An option may be to describe the physicians' obligations in more detail, but it is highly questionable whether this is feasible, for it would require an extensive list of rights and duties, specified for many imaginary situations. One could in addition also question whether formulating a detailed list of obligations would be desirable, as this may deter professionals (and there is already a shortage) and, more importantly, it expresses distrust rather than trust.",

It may be given form in phrases using terms like 'the patient', but that is not a patient with whom a relationship is already established, making it less specific. Oaths could perhaps better be viewed as symbolic. If an oath will change over time, this does not automatically imply that it binds members who took their oath before this change. An oath would rather address noble motives than binding doctors to a duty. But violating one's oath is often seen as immoral.

This grounds differs from the above (special training), because it does not focus on the abilities gained by the training, but on how it is facilitated to gain these abilities, benefits and privileges.

When one doctor refuses to provide care the workload of his colleagues increases as well as the risk incurred by them [18] . This could lead to a moral obligation towards colleagues. Risk exposure might ideally be controlled by distributing it in such a way that those most prepared for risks would face the highest burden of risk exposure [14] . Certain trained professionals can handle more with a lower relative risk as professionals that lack that specific training. They know how to cope with certain risks due to their training. These specialists could thereby prevent risk to colleagues. Even further, one could state that they are morally obliged to do so.

In previous occasions, such as the SARS epidemic of 2003, it was argued that healthcare workers have a duty to treat. In this paper various grounds regarding such a duty to treat in the context of an influenza pandemic have been set forth. Based on the grounds discussed in this paper we conclude that one can speak of a duty to treat. This duty to treat should rather be perceived as a prima facie moral duty than an absolute one. In the case of a pandemic medical doctors are needed; relying on benevolence solely might prove to be sufficient, but we cannot hope for that. Doctors should at least have a duty to treat as long as providing medical care will not lead to greater harm than not acting. At least doctors should have a duty to justify themselves when refusing a duty to treat.",

            "text": "Responsibilities that arise out of competing duties might be compensated. Care for children for example could temporarily be taken care of by others who are not needed for delivering medical care. Financial compensation could be an option. Granting doctors working under these circumstances the certainty to direct access to healthcare when needed would alleviate the fear of getting sick. By compensating these responsibilities competing duties could be overruled. Filling in how to do so is beyond the scope of this paper; this would be an interesting task for policy makers and hospital managers. Finally, the healthcare system is not just formed by doctors, but also by many supporting forces. Healthcare will not function when only licensed doctors are obliged to work and others will not show up for work. One should also consider their duty to work in the situation of an influenza pandemic.",
