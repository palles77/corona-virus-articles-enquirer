The deep-blue region shows the extent to which the model is ill-identified by the data. Indeed, all these deep-blue models equally fit the data which results in a range of predictions. For robustness, we pick the white square in the middle of the deep-blue region, but note here that it is only one of the models which are consistent period and initial infections. Blue is better fit, red is worse fit. The deep-blue region corresponds to comparable models, within 0.5% of the optimal fit.

A side benefit of the predictions in Table 1 , if the model is to be trusted, is as a benchmark against which to evaluate public health interventions. If moving forward, observed new infections are low compared to the data in Table 1 , it means the interventions are working by most likely reducing \u03b2.

If our \"lag\" k = 10 is accurate, and the social distancing protocols have been effective at reducing \u03b2, the observed new infections should drop below the predictions starting on or before March 22.

We end with some limitations. First, the independent evolution of infection sites only applies to early dynamics. Hence, when the model infections increase beyond some point, and the pandemic begins to saturate the population, a more sophisticated network model that captures the dependence between infection sites would be needed Balcan et al. . While we did present an optimal model, it should be taken with a grain of salt because many models are nearly equivalent, resulting in prediction uncertainty. The model and the interpretation of its parameters will change once public health protocols kick in. The model may have to be re-calibrated (for example if \u03b2 decreases) and the parameters may have to be reinterpreted (for example \u03b3 is a virulence only in the self-reporting setting, not for random testing). It is also possible to build a more general model with an early phase \u03b2 1 and a latter phase \u03b2 2 (after social distancing). Lastly, the model was learned on USA data. The learned model parameters may not be appropriate for another society. The virulence could be globally invariant, but it could also depend on genetic and demographic factors like age, as well as what \"serious\" means for the culture -that is when do you get yourself checked. In a high-strung society, you expect high virulence since the threshold for serious is lower. One certainly expects the infectious force to depend on the underlying social network and interaction patterns between people, which can vary drastically from one society to another and depending on interventions. Hence, one should calibrate the model to country specific data to gain more useful insights.",

Our lag, k = 10, says the confirmed infections should fall away from the predictions on about 03/22, because agressive social distancing began on around 03/12. The lag is important due to how public policy can be driven by human psychology as opposed to quantitative models. March 20 saw a 40% increase in new infections compared to the previous day. This led to a significant heightening of vigilance and calls for \"shelter in place\" protocols. But, by March 20, we still do not know the effectiveness of social distancing protocols from March 12th have been. Hence, such calls to vigilance can be premature. More importantly, suppose strict shelter in place protocols are enacted on March 21 and infections fall the next day. The Human tendency is to associate the improvement to the March 21 strict protocols. But, if the model is correct, the March 21 protocols have nothing to do with the improvement on March 22. Such lags are present in traditional machine learning, for example the delayed reward in reinforcement learning settings. Credit assignment to prior actions in the face of delayed reward is a notoriously difficult task, and this remains so with humans in the loop. Knowledge of the lag helps to assign credit appropriately to prior actions, and the public health setting is no exception.",
