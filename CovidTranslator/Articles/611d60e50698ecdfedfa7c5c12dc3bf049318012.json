An approximately 70 kDa fragment of the N-terminal globular domain of the spike (S) protein (S N protein) from the coronavirus TGEV was used as the transmissible gastroenteritis virus antigen model. Recombinant L. lactis, expressing the S N protein, was constructed with the pNZ8112 plasmid. Expression and localization of the transcribed S N protein from the recombinant L NZ 9000-rTGEV-S N were detected via SDS-PAGE, Western blot, and immunofluorescence. BALB/c mice, orally immunized with L NZ 9000-rTGEV-S N , produced local mucosal immune responses against TGEV. The induced antibodies demonstrated neutralizing effects on TGEV infection. These data indicated that the recombinant L. lactis could be a valuable tool in the development of future vaccines against TGEV.",

            "text": "Research carried out in recent years has led to the conviction that certain strains of lactic acid bacteria (LAB), in particular strains from the genera Lactobacillus and Bifidobactrium, may promote health in man and animals. LAB possesses a number of properties that make them attractive candidates for oral vaccination purposes. These bacteria are considered to be 'safe' organisms with a GRAS (Generally Recognized As Safe) status. In addition, Lactobacilli are able to survive passage through the upper gastrointestinal tract (GIT), and certain strains are capable of colonizing the intestinal tract [1] [2] [3] . These properties are particularly relevant when vaccines are to be applied in less industrialized countries. Furthermore, many bacterial, viral, and parasitic pathogens enter the body via the mucosal surfaces of the body. The first line of defense for humans and animals is found, not surprisingly, in the intestines, the largest immunological organ of the human body. More than 60% of antibodies produced daily are secreted into the GIT. Oral immunization frequently evokes both local and systemic immune responses, resulting in an effective elimination of foreign invaders [4] [5] [6] [7] . These characteristics make them attractive candidates for delivering pharmaceutical compounds of interest to the mucosa, particularly vaccines and immunomodulators.",

For many pathogens, the initial infection mainly occurs at the mucosa tissues of intestines. Therefore, it is important to develop vaccines that elicit protective immune responses against infection and replication of the pathogens at the mucosal level. Vaccines administered by parenteral routes generally fail to stimulate mucosal immune responses. Mucosal immunization is a proven, effective approach against colonization of pathogens and their further spread to the systemic circulation [4] . Therefore, it is necessary to develop efficient and safe antigen vectors that could trigger mucosal and systemic immune responses. One promising approach relies on the use of live bacterial vehicles. The potential of recombinant LAB to deliver heterologous antigens to the mucosal immune system has been under investigation [25] [26] [27] . This approach offers a number of advantages over the traditional parenteral vaccination, such as non-invasiveness and the possibility to elicit both mucosal and systemic immune responses. A great deal of research, currently being explored for oral application, focused on the development of adequate mucosal vaccines with various vaccine delivery systems. Among available approaches that efficiently stimulate mucosal responses, the use of Lactococcus carriers to deliver vaccine antigens probably constitutes one of the most successful strategies. The use of LAB as a live vehicle for the delivery of antigens or other therapeutic molecules for mucosal immunization has been proposed. However, only a few of systems have been described using Lactobacillus casei strains as a carrier of heterologous viral antigens in a form that can be presented to and processed by the mammalian host [28] . The TGEV S protein was expressed by Lactobacillus casei [29] . Lactobacillus is the resident strain present in the intestinal tract of mammals. It may produce immunological tolerance, and a practical application for its use should be identified. IgA is the predominant antibody at the mucosal surface, as its local production is greater than other immunoglobulins. Therefore, an efficient TGEV oral vaccine should be able to induce a specific mucosal IgA response. We evaluated the immunogenicity of L NZ 9000-rTGEV-S N using BALB/ c mice as the animal model. The L NZ 9000-rTGEV-S N produced both mucosal and systemic immune responses after intragastric administration. The oral administration regimen consisted of three sets of three successive daily doses of L NZ 9000-rTGEV-S N by vaccination. This protocol was adapted from Challacombe's procedure [21] , which was consistently effective when particulate oral vaccines were used to immunize mice. Three successive daily doses of recombinant bacteria were required in order to ensure that a systemic antibody response to TGEV could be elicited in all mice that received the recombinant strain, intragastrically.",

These data indicated that the recombinant Lactococcus could be a useful tool in the development of future vaccines against TGEV.",
