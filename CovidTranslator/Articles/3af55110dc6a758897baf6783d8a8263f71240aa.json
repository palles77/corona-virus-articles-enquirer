Statistical heterogeneity between studies was evaluated with Cochran's Q test and the I 2 statistic [4] . For the Q statistic, a p value < 0.10 was considered statistically significant for heterogeneity; for I 2 , a value >50% was considered to have severe heterogeneity. Publication bias was evaluated by constructing a funnel plot and by Egger's test [5] . For Egger's test, a p value < 0.10 was considered to be statistically significant.
