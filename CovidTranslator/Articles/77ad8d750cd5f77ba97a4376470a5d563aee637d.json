The calves were challenged 3 weeks later with a virulent strain of M. bovis on two occasions within 24 h using the aerosol route. The calves were monitored for clinical signs and serological responses then post mortemed 3 weeks after challenge. The vaccine was shown to be highly immunogenic in calves and did not cause adverse effects. Vaccinated calves showed few clinical signs while all unvaccinated calves developed signs of pneumonia. There was a significant decrease in body weight gain in unvaccinated calves compared to vaccinates and a significant increase in lung lesions and rectal temperatures in unvaccinated calves. The vaccine also reduced the spread of M. bovis to internal organs. In conclusion the M. bovis vaccine produced a significant level of protection against a large virulent challenge. Crown",

Few countries are free of disease because of the worldwide movement of cattle. In Europe, M. bovis is believed to be responsible for 25-33% of outbreaks of calf pneumonia and control is largely restricted to management practises such as improving ventilation or reducing stocking densities and chemotherapy. However, it has long been known that M. bovis, like all mycoplasmas, are naturally resistant to many antibiotics because of their lack of a cell wall. Furthermore, over the last decade evidence has accumulated that M. bovis is becoming resistant to antibiotics which have traditionally been effective including the tetracyclines, tilmicosin and spectinomycin [3] . As a result of this increasingly poor response to treatment, the use of vaccines would seem to be a rational approach to the control of disease caused or exacerbated by M. bovis.",

            "text": "The first attempt to develop vaccines against calf pneumonia was reported by Howard et al. in 1987 [4] who showed that a quadrivalent formalised killed vaccine incorporating M. bovis with other respiratory pathogens comprising respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza type 3 virus (PI3) and Mycoplasma dispar was effective in protecting against natural outbreaks of bovine respiratory disease. However, no further work continued on this vaccine. A vaccine prepared with formalin-inactivated strains of M. bovis and Mannheimia haemolytica taken from the target herd reduced losses from pneumonia and cost of treatment in newly introduced feedlot calves [5] . Other attempts again using formalin as an inactivant for mycoplasma infections have been largely unsuccessful or produce only transient protection probably because of the damaging effect of this chemical on the antigenic composition of the mycoplasma [6] . In one report the use of a formalin inactivated M. bovis vaccine actually led to an increase in disease following challenge in vaccinated calves compared to sham-vaccinated animals [7] . More modern approaches to vaccination have also been disappointing as an experimental vaccine composed of partially purified membrane proteins from M. bovis also increased pneumonic pathology [8] .",

A lack of a commercial vaccine for M. bovis probably reflects the inconclusive results of previous experiments including those in which an exacerbation of disease was seen following vaccination [7, 8] . Furthermore, the need for specialist and expensive facilities for diagnosing mycoplasma infection has led to an under reporting of mycoplasma diseases giving rise to the still pervasive view amongst many veterinarians that the role of M. bovis in the respiratory disease complex is not proven [16] . The importance of M. bovis has been shown conclusively following its introduction into both Northern and the Republic of Ireland in the early 1990s where it rapidly became a major cause of respiratory disease as well as frequent cause of mastitis and arthritis [17, 18] . In Britain and France M. bovis is believed to be responsible for 25-33% of calf pneumonias [19, 20] while in the USA some authors believe it may be involved in up to 50% of chronic calf pneumonias. In Denmark an increase in cases has also been reported [21] . Finally the ease with which M. bovis can cause pneumonia in calves experimentally should demonstrate its importance in the field ( [22] , present work).",

Evidence was also provided that the vaccine may also protect against arthritis though further work will be needed to confirm this.

[9] speculated that the high level of protection seen with the use of saponins with vaccines in mice may be caused by the ability of saponins to induce an isotype profile similar to that seen in natural immunity to bacterial infections. It is not known what the effect of saponin alone would have been on the calves challenged in the present experiment although a brief stimulation of the immune system, in particular the Th1 response, may have been expected (B. Morein, personal communication); however, it is highly unlikely to have led to the levels of protection seen with the saponised vaccine.",
