            "text": "The IFNL4 gene is a recently discovered type III interferon, which in a significant fraction of the human population harbours a frameshift mutation abolishing the IFNk4 ORF. The expression of IFNk4 is correlated with both poor spontaneous clearance of hepatitis C virus (HCV) and poor response to treatment with type I interferon. Here, we show that the IFNL4 gene encodes an active type III interferon, named IFNk4, which signals through the IFNkR1 and IL-10R2 receptor chains. Recombinant IFNk4 is antiviral against both HCV and coronaviruses at levels comparable to IFNk3. However, the secretion of IFNk4 is impaired compared to that of IFNk3, and this impairment is not due to a weak signal peptide, which was previously believed. We found that IFNk4 gets N-linked glycosylated and that this glycosylation is required for secretion. Nevertheless, this glycosylation is not required for activity. Together, these findings result in the paradox that IFNk4 is strongly antiviral but a disadvantage during HCV infection.",

Although IFNls are clearly interferons (Ank et al, 2006; Doyle et al, 2006; Zhou et al, 2007) , they signal via a complex consisting of the IFNlR1 and IL-10R2 receptor chains and share both structural features and the IL-10R2 chain with the IL-10 family of cytokines . Type III interferons distinguish themselves in being highly tissue specific. The IFNlR1 receptor chain is expressed on cells of epithelial origin and a yet not clearly defined small subset of haematopoietic cells (Mennechet and Uze, 2006; Mordstein et al, 2010; Pott et al, 2011) . The liver is of particular interest to this report. In humans, hepatocytes express IFNlR1, and thus respond to IFNl Wang et al, 2013) . Humans possess four IFNl genes (IFNL1, -L2, -L3 and -L4) as well as a pseudogene (IFNL3P1) (Lasfar et al, 2006; Fox et al, 2009) . Whereas the IFNL1, -L2 and -L3 genes were described in 2003 (Kotenko et al, 2003; Sheppard et al, 2003) , the IFNL4 gene was described recently and the IFNL4 gene has been inactivated in large part of the human population by a frameshift mutation (Prokunina-Olsson et al, 2013) . Phase 2 of clinical trials using pegylated IFNl1 against hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection has recently been completed (Ramos, 2010) , and it has now entered the phase 3 trials. IFNls are interesting pharmaceuticals, as the rather specific expression pattern of the IFNlR1 receptor should reduce the adverse effects compared to the type I IFN treatment.",

Rather unexpectedly, single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) located within and around the IFNl3 gene were discovered as powerful predictors of treatment outcome as well as the likelihood for spontaneous clearance of the virus Thomas et al, 2009) . Extensive studies of the genetic region around the IFNL3 gene revealed the existence of a novel gene, the IFNL4 gene, which harbours a dinucleotide variant (ss469415590, TT or DG), where the TT allele leads to a frameshift thus inactivating the gene, and the DG allele results in a functional IFNL4 gene (Prokunina-Olsson et al, 2013) . In humans, the TT allele is strongly positively associated with HCV clearance as well as with positive treatment outcome (Bibert et al, 2013; Prokunina-Olsson et al, 2013) . Thus, disruption of the IFNL4 gene is beneficial for humans in the context of HCV infection, though the reason for this remains unclear.",

In addition, the authors produced recombinant IFNl4 inactive protein using insect cells. However, this protein was purified from cell lysates and not from the media as it is normally done with secreted proteins, and it appears likely that the protein was not properly folded. The lack of IFNl4 secretion together with the clear observation of intracellular IFNl4 protein led to the suggestion that IFNl4 could signal via an intracellular receptor (Booth and George, 2013; Lupberger et al, 2013; Ray, 2013) . Furthermore, the sequence of IFNl4 is similar to other IFNls within the first and last helices, which bind IFNlR1, while the IL-10R2 binding region is poorly conserved. Thus, the authors questioned whether IFNl4 actually signals through IL-10R2.",

These cells express low levels of IFNlR1 and normally respond very poorly to type III interferon (Meager et al, 2005) . They do, however, express IL-10R2. In our assay, we introduced a luciferase reporter under the control of the Mx1 promoter in order to measure the interferon activity, and at the same time, we introduced IFNlR1 by transfection and/or knocked down IL-10R2, using specific siRNA ( Figure 2C ). The expression of IFNlR1 by transfection renders them highly responsive to both IFNl4 and IFNl3. However, this signal is largely lost when IL-10R2 is knocked down using siRNA ( Figure 2C ). The IFNamediated signalling was not significantly affected by either overexpression of IFNlR1 or knock-down of IL-10R2. To confirm these results, we repeated the experiment now blocking IL-10R2 with a specific antibody which has previously been shown to block IL-10R2 signalling in relation to IFNl (Sheppard et al, 2003) . The IL-10R2 antibody did not result in any activation of the reporter gene on its own, but both IFNl3 and IFNl4 signalling were sensitive to the IL-10R2 antibody, whereas IFNa signalling was unaffected. These results conclusively demonstrate that IFNl4, like the other members of the type III interferon family, signals via a heterodimeric receptor complex consisting of IFNlR1 and IL-10R2.",

The overall structure of homIFNl4 is similar to that of IFNl3 ( Figure 3C ), as is expected for a homology model. The following observations validate the accuracy of the model. Cys76 and Cys178, which are not present in IFNl3, are in close proximity in homIFNl4, and with minor local rearrangements, they could form a disulphide bridge ( Figure 3B ). Furthermore, two conserved disulphide links are expected to exist in IFNl4, connecting Cys27 to Cys122 and Cys62 to Cys152. In both cases, homIFNl4 is compatible with the formation of these disulphide links. Moreover, superimposing homIFNl4 onto the structure of IFNl1 bound to IFNlR1 clearly shows that the homIFNl4 structure is compatible with the IFNlR1 binding.",

Yet our data clearly show that both IFNl3 and IFNl4 use IFNlR1 and IL-10R2 for signalling. The model of IFNl4 suggests a conservation of the helical structure and the way this is presented to IL-10R2. The conserved residues in helix D are primarily hydrophobic residues, which dock helix D to the rest of the structure and thus, determine the steric conformation of this helix. This conservation is most likely crucial for the activation as both receptor chains need to be engaged simultaneously. It is, however, important to remember that IL-10R2 is a shared chain that is capable of binding several different cytokines (IL-10, IL-22 and IL-26 and the IFNls). The chain is thus, promiscuous, allowing itself to interact with different ligands (Logsdon et al, 2012) .",

The glycosylation site N61 in IFNl4 is equivalent to W47 in IFNl1. W47 interacts weakly with IFNlR1, but is located at the periphery of the interaction site away from the membrane and is situated in a loop between the A-and B-helixes (Miknis et al, 2010) .

Contrary to this, IFNl4 is not detectable by western blot in the media regardless of the SP. Thus, the poor secretion of IFNl4 cannot solely be ascribed to the SP.",

As IFNl4 is predicted to contain a single N-linked glycosylation site at Asn61 (marked with a square in Figure 3A and labelled in Figure 3E ), the upper band could be due to glycosylation. To test this, we treated the cell lysates from the IFNl4transfected cells with PNGase F that cleaves N-linked glycosylation between the asparagine and the innermost N-acetylchondrosamine of high mannose, hybrid and complex oligosaccharides.

Thus, IFNl4 is secreted at substantially lower levels. Swapping the SPs made no difference for IFNl3, which was equally well produced with its own or the SP of IFNl4.

Thus, we wanted to address the glycosylation state of the secreted IFNl4. As IFNl4 levels were too low to be detected using standard western blotting, we first refined the detection of IFNl4 in the media of transfected cells using acetone precipitation ( Figure 7A ). The western blot revealed IFNl4 of a size consistent with glycosylation, and this result was confirmed with PNGase F treatment. Next, we made a mutant of IFNl4 where the glycosylated asparagine residue N61 was mutated to aspartate (IFNl4 N61D). HEK293 cells were transfected with empty vector, IFNl4, IFNl3 or IFNl4 N61D, and the intracellular and extracellular fractions were analysed by western blotting ( Figure 7B ). IFNl4 N61D only gives one band on the western blot of the intracellular fractions corresponding to the unmodified IFNl4. Neither IFNl4 nor IFNl4 N61D is detectable in the extracellular fraction by standard western blotting. However, when we carry out acetone precipitation on the media before western blotting, we see a clear band for IFNl4, but not for IFNl4 N61D, showing that this mutation further impairs the secretion of IFNl4. This is also reflected in the IFNl activity (performed as in Figure 6C ), where the activity in the supernatant of cells transfected with IFNl4 N61D is greatly decreased compared to that from cells transfected with IFNl4 ( Figure 7C ).",

However, the question arose whether the glycosylated IFNl4 is active or whether low levels of unglycosylated protein that is undetectable by western blotting even after acetone precipitation mediate the activity. To exclude that non-glycosylated IFNl4 could be the source of the interferon activity, we incubated media from IFNl4-transfected cells with Concanavalin A (Con A) beads. Con A is a lectin that binds terminal a-D mannose and a-D glucose found on high mannose and hybrid N-linked glycans. Media from cells transfected with IFNl4 or empty vector were incubated with Con A beads. In the IFNl4-transfected cells, there was interferon activity in the input before addition of the Con A beads and this activity was removed after incubation with the beads ( Figure 7E ). This shows that the glycosylated IFNl4 is the source of the measured interferon activity. We attempted to elute IFNl4 from the beads using standard elution buffer but without success, as seen by the lack of activity ( Figure 7D ) and protein ( Figure 7E ) in the eluate. Nevertheless, we were able to confirm that IFNl4 was bound to the Con A beads by boiling these beads in SDS page buffer and performing a western blotting ( Figure 7E ).

Next, we demonstrated the involvement of IL-10R2 both by siRNA knockdown and by blocking the IL-10R2 chain by a specific antibody that has been used to define the receptor usage of the other IFNls (Sheppard et al, 2003) . Thus, IFNl4 leads to the activation of an interferon response and mediates antiviral effects through the canonical IFNl receptor complex composed of IFNlR1 and IL-10R2.

To our surprise, the antiviral activity of IFNl3 and IFNl4, respectively, was indistinguishable in all viral infection models tested. For HCV, we tested two different hepatic cell lines, Huh7 and HepG2, and in neither case did we observe any difference between IFNl3 and IFNl4. Likewise, using primary HAE cells for the infection with either HCoV-229E or MERS-CoV, we did not observe any difference between IFNl3 and IFNl4. This is remarkable as the sequence identity between the two isoforms is only 29% (Prokunina-Olsson et al, 2013), and our preliminary bioinformatics studies reveal that the protein sequence of IFNl4 is well conserved among mammals (data not shown). Thus, there must have been an evolutionary pressure to keep IFNl4 as a functional protein throughout the mammalian evolution until the sudden introduction of a frameshift mutation in humans. Since the inactivation of the IFNL4 gene is strongly correlated with increased likelihood of spontaneous clearance of HCV as well as with a positive response to the treatment with type I IFN, it appears that the production of IFNl4 protein is actually a disadvantage during HCV infection. Furthermore, there appears to be a positive selection in humans for the frameshift mutation abolishing IFNl4 production (Prokunina-Olsson et al, 2013) . Whether this selection is solely driven by HCV is currently not known. IFNl4 production could even be beneficial in the context of other viral infections. It was thus recently reported that the SNPs that have been shown to be favourable for the treatment outcome as well as the likelihood for spontaneous clearance of HCV are associated with poor recovery from hepatitis B virus infection (Kim et al, 2013) .

As discussed above, the induction of ISGs occurs through the canonical IFNl receptor complex, but we cannot exclude that IFNl4 has activities outside the induction of ISGs, which could be mediated through an as yet unidentified receptor. However, our data suggests that IFNl4 is highly active against HCV despite the fact that it has been shown to be a predictor of poor response to HCV. The current data cannot exclude indirect genetic effects, and thus it is not firmly proven that the IFNl4 protein is the causal agent for the poor prognosis of HCV patients with a functional IFNL4 gene. Furthermore, no evidence for the presence of the IFNl4 protein in HCV patients exists to date. However, if one assumes that the IFNl4 protein is the causal agent, this would suggest a complicated relationship between IFNl4 and HCV in humans, where IFNl4 somehow impairs a full immune response towards HCV. We have produced fully functional IFNl4 protein which should be used for further studies of IFNl4 on hepatic and immune cells. Furthermore, it will be important to address whether HCV is driving the selection of the TT allele (non-functional IFNl4) in humans, and if the introduction of the TT allele changes susceptibility towards other viral infections.",

            "text": "The question whether the glycosylation impairs activity was also raised. As the E. coli-produced protein is fully active, it is obvious that the glycosylation is not required for activity, but could it interfere with receptor binding? Our structure modelling suggested that the sugars were attached outside the receptor-binding site, and the activity that we recovered from the supernatant of IFNl4-transfected cells, which appeared only to contain glycosylated IFNl4, suggested that the sugars did not interfere with activity. However, to confirm this result, we used Con A beads to deplete the media from glycosylated IFNl4. As this led to an almost complete loss of activity, we conclude that the IFNl4 secreted from HEK293 cells is both glycosylated and active.",

The lack of secretion of IFNl4 led several news and views papers to suggest the presence of an intracellular receptor. Our data clearly demonstrate that IFNl4 does use the normal receptor situated at the cellular membrane, although we cannot formally exclude the presence of an intracellular receptor. However, we consider it likely that the activation of the interferon pathway, which was observed after transfection of HepG2 cells with IFNl4 expressing plasmids (Prokunina-Olsson et al, 2013) , is due to low levels of secreted IFNl4.",
