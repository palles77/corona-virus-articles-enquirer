The agent multiplied but failed to induce readily recognizable cytopathic effect in bovine embryonic kidney cell cultures (3) . The virus has been assayed therefore in these cultures by a rather cumbersome method in which the presence of the virus was determined by microscopic examination for syncytia of cultures stained with gentian violet, or by immunofluorescent technique (3). This paper describes briefly our recent observation that the virus readily replicates and induces a marked cytopathic effect in cultures of a continuous cell line, BEK-1, derived from bovine embryonic kidney (2), thus providing a sensitive, practical assay method and a satisfactory source of the virus.",
