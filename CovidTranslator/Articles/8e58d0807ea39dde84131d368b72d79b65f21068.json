It causes a severe and deadly hemorrhagic fever in humans and other mammals, called Ebola Virus Disease (EVD). In recent outbreaks of EVD, there has been loss of large numbers of individual's life. Therefore, EBOV has attracted researchers and increased interests in developing new models for virus evolution, and therapies. The EBOV interacts with the immune system of the host which led to understand how the virus functions and effects immune system behaviour. This article presents an exhaustive review on Ebola research which includes EVD illness, symptoms, transmission patterns, patho-physiology conditions, development of antiviral agents and vaccines, resilient health system, dynamics and mathematical model of EBOV, challenges and prospects for future studies.",

It is a member of \"Filoviridae\" virus family, under the genus \"Ebolavirus\", having five species: Zaire Ebola, Tai Forest Ebola, Sudan Ebola, Bundibugyo Ebola, and Reston Ebola Virus [1] . Out of these species, former four cause illness in humans, whereas the Reston Ebola Virus causes illness in primates. Ebola virus causes an illness called as hemorrhagic fever [2] , especially in humans and other mammals, named as \"Ebola Virus Disease\" (EVD), and therefore EVD is also known as \"Ebola Hemorrhagic Fever\" (EHF). Ebola viruses are native to a number of African countries. The disease was firstly recognized in 1976 in two concurrent outbreaks: one of them in Nzara, an state in South Sudan, and another one in village Yambuku, previously known as Democratic Republic of Congo, adjacent to 'Ebola River', and hence the name Ebola Virus Disease [3] .",

When the virus enters the body, it infects various types of immune cells by initially targeting monocytes and macrophages, and cause the release of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines [98] . In the previous studies it was shown that host Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) is a sensor for EBOV glycoprotein (GP) on virus-like particles (VLPs) and that resultant TLR4 signaling pathways lead to the production of proinflammatory cytokines and suppressor of cytokine signaling 1 (SOCS1) in a human monocytic cell line and in HEK293-TLR4/MD2 cells stably expressing the TLR4/MD2 complex. EBOV GP interacts with TLR4, and on VLPs it was able to stimulate expression of NF-\u03baB in a TLR4-dependent manner. It was also found that budding of EBOV VLPs was more pronounced in TLR4-stimulated cells than in unstimulated control cells. These findings identify the host innate immune protein TLR4 as a sensor for Ebola virus GP and play an important role in the immune-pathogenesis.",

In some cases, innate defenses are not able to handle viral infection, and second-line of defenses is mobilized to ensure host survival. The adaptive defense consists of antibodies and lymphocytes, often called the humoral response and the cell mediated responses which are essential for destruction of viruses [6] . Innate and adaptive responses usually work together to eliminate the viruses, but in some cases both these immune responses are not able to eradicate the viruses which led to diseases. Filoviridae family of viruses is one of the examples which are not destroyed by the immune system. Many studies shown that the induction of an innate immune response lead to infection or stimulation of macrophages/monocytes and DCs with Ebola virus or VLPs, respectively. For example, incubation of Ebola virus VP40 + GP VLPs with DCs led to the induction of interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-8, NF-\u03baB and ERK1/2. Ebola virus VP40 + GP VLPs, but not VP40 VLPs, induced cytokine and SOCS1 expression in a TLR4/ MD2 dependent manner both in a human monocytic cell line (THP-1 cells) and in 293T cells expressing a functional TLR4/MD2 receptor. Stimulation of TLR4 by Ebola virus envelope GP results in an innate host response, induction of SOCS1 protein, and potential enhancement of virus egress. The detailed coverage of various genes involved in immune response can be found in [5, 6, 7, 46] .",

In addition, Ebola cases were also exported to several other African and European countries including United States, with further transmission to healthcare workers across several countries [13] . The large number of Ebola survivors has the frequency of persistent symptoms and the possibility of virus persistence in sanctuary sites, leading to delayed transmission. EBOV may also persist in immune-privileged sites and semen of survivors which lead to re-ignition of EVD outbreak. As EBOV RNA can remain detectable in immune-privileged tissues for prolonged periods of time after clearance from the blood, suggesting that it may persists during convalescence and thereafter [97] .

It is suggested that humans are confronted by animal derived pathogens, however, only a small fraction of people (having weak immunity) get affected.

Systems Biology can be used for modeling the events, and deriving the answers to all those questions which are still unanswered. Systematic Modeling and Interaction Modeling can be used extensively to model biological phenomenon. With the help of computational and analytics approaches, we can unlock many new theories related to EVD transmission, and mechanism of EBOV invasions. We can even develop better vaccines and drugs for the diseases [27] . Infectious diseases are growing rapidly as the pathogens are evolving themselves against our therapeutics. There has been an urgent need for improved remedies against pathogens. Systems Biology based studies have proved to be icing on the cake! Systems Biology based analysis have been worked out recently in order to capture how the host genes are associated with the viral replication that tend to occupy space in the human protein interactome [28, 29] . A comprehensive systems-level analysis of the virus-host interactome is very important for understanding the roles of host factors Many antiviral drug discovery approaches have produced appreciable achievements but there are no medications available in order to fight it. Systems biology based antiviral drug studies have tremendously helped in the identification of new antiviral candidates. Cheng et al. [31] have proposed an integrated approach to determine new antiviral candidates for the existing drugs by adding drug-gene patterns into the virus-host interactome. Using systems biology analysis they have determined three molecule drugs namely, Ajmaline, Piroxicam and Azlocillin, as the new drug candidates for anti-Ebola virus treatment. Along with this, they have also proposed the mechanism showing how these drugs can block the Ebola virus and henceforth, inhibit the infection.",

After all, a human being is a resource, and a life saved is more important than to make heaps of stocks of money. The current drugs that are being used to treat Ebola affected patients are so costly, for example: Favipiravir (T-705) 25mg costs around $280, whereas, the same medicine but of a higher dosage, about 100mg costs around $780. Such therapeutic treatments and medications are very costly, which actually can be one of the reasons why we still lag behind in completely eliminating Ebola roots from the world. Epidemiologic practices, like toss-back analyses to establish and lazaretto people debunked to Ebola, are momentous to curb the spill-over. Such control practices are desired to train people on the ground in even the most lonesome locale [87] . Given that nosocomial transmission has contributed heavily to past Ebola epidemics [42] .

In the fresh phase of the disease, fluid replacement therapy hysterically escalates the probability of endurability. Ribavirin, the only acknowledged antiviral viz. competent against certain VHF pathogens such as Lassa fever, is not active against Ebola viruses, which is unfortunate as it has already passed the 3rd phase of clinical trials. ZMapp, on the other hand, is a combination of monoclonal antibodies used to treat Ebola patients. Its role in treating EVD is still not certified as enough data proving it to be efficient is yet not published. It works well when tested on non-primates as it was capable enough to revert back the EVD. Favipiravir is the most commonly used and tested drug on humans. When tested on mice, it prevented its death, but its activity in non-human models still need to be validated. BCX 4430 is another drug extensively studied and worked on, and has proved to be effective against Marburg Viruses in non-human primate models and Ebola model of mice. Ebola outbreak of Kikwit in 1995 was treated with patients being treated to Convalescent Plasma treatment, which at that time proved to be better as fewer people died and many survived.

Furthermore, EBOV attacks the innate and the adaptive immunity, thereby creating chaos which restricts these drugs in the human body.",

Despite, the results did not ascertain any cogent vaccine candidates even in commensuration of animal model [92] . Nevertheless, Ebola vaccine design and development studies have been going on for the last several decades, but unfortunately, the pace was not so rapid or rewarding. As a result, the development of vaccines related to EBOV has several limitations related to safety and personal expertise [36] . Some approaches were based on DNA, called DNA Vaccine, and were initiated during 2000s. Such approaches were tested and found to be successful. In DNA vaccine, infused nucleoprotein (NP) or glycoprotein (GP) of EBOV acts as an antigen to activate host immune responses and infused antigen-delivering DNA boosts the immunization [49] . Recently, a trial using Vesicular Stomatitis Virus (VSV) platform has been devised as bivalent vaccine against EBOV showing systemic immune responses safe-guarding animals after injection [50] . This non-segmented, negative stranded RNA virus is likewise celebrated to be a superlative competitor for recombinant DNA vaccine belvedere across several filoviruses as the virtue of the virus is an animal pathogen that does not coax any kind of serious manifestations in humans [50, 51] .VSV based candidate vaccines (VSV-GP) have been successful in mice and have proved to give complete protection and also, have shown to be effective in the post exposure treatment regime. Since VSV-based vaccines are replication competent recombinant viruses, their use have been suspected in humans [88] . VSV based vaccines are an exclusive feature that is very precious in laboratory accidents, outbreak and bio-weapon exposure situations [52] . A review on phase-I trials of EBOV vaccines can be in found in Lambe et al. [53] .",

If we correlate the two terms, we may answer how communities have coped EVD. Resilience in general means \"Elasticity\", i.e., transforming our medical health systems into resilient ones in order to become multifaceted, giving care and support to the patients to overcome the past and prepare them for a better future [61, 62] . Healthcare systems can be termed as resilient only when they have the zeal and springiness in their mode of action towards such epidemic disease spills [63] .

EBOV is an enveloped virus composed of 18.8-19 kb single-stranded, negative sense RNA genome that encodes 7 proteins and has surface glycoprotein presenting roles in cell attachment, fusion and cell entry involved in immune evasion and pathogenesis of disease. Transmission of the virus is generally zoonosis which involves animals and humans. As it was identified that fruit bats are the reservoir hosts of the Ebola Virus and therefore they carried this virus and transmits to other animals and further to humans. The spill-over of infections basically occurs from bats to humans but the dynamical mechanism of EBOV is understood by 3 factors, namely, Biological Factors, Environmental Factors and Social Factors, and therefore, the infectious interaction between bats and the ecosystem is responsible for the spillover dynamics of deadly diseases either directly (bats -> humans) or indirectly (bats -> animals -> humans). So, to understand the framework for the holistic study of disease dynamics mechanism of EBOV, various approaches such as Life Sciences, Mathematics, Systems Biology, Computational, and Analytical methods need to be applied.",

            "text": "There is a big challenge in the treatment of EVD as there is no approved therapeutics so far. But some of the diagnostic methods such as ELISA and rRT-PCR are generally used. In addition, a number of vaccines and antiviral drugs are under the development against EVD by using animal models such as mice, guinea pigs, and NHPs to test the safety and efficacy of the vaccines or drugs, which gives results for only phase I clinical trials. Phase II, III, and IV trials didn't give better results due to lack of equipment, resources and technology. Various small molecules and antiviral drugs, including as Favipiravir, siRNAs, PMOs, AVI6002, Brincidofovir, BCX4430, and ZMapp, have been developed. Among these, the most promising and active antiviral drugs are ZMapp and Favipiravir. Hence, to get a victory against Ebola, we still require powerful drugs and vaccines. In addition to therapeutics and medications, optimized care using resilient health system is very important. Optimal control theory was used to develop dynamic mathematical model of EVD which can be used to reduce the sensitivity in the population. The Centre for Disease Control and Prevention is engrossed broadly with allies to help stop the epidemic at its source in Africa. Thousands of people from affected areas travel to different part of the world. As long as Ebola is growing, practitioners are required to be very alert to the probability of EVD, check travel history, and immediately separate and test ill travelers who have travelled to EVD affected regions in the past 3 weeks [71] . However, it is a challenging task. Regardless of the fact, the service of anticoagulant therapy in humans needs additional studies distinctly in confining with clear-cut antiviral remedies. Though, the services of interferons as broad-spectrum antivirals archaize finite both by the brevity and fatality of their effects. This has jeopardized attention about the expectancies for a wide array of other newly characterized cytokines that also inspires innate immunity. To elevate the predictability, it becomes mandatory to identify infected persons as soon as possible, which requires latest diagnostic techniques and treatment facilities. A single nonchalant activity can be disastrous. By following precautionary measures, spread of the disease can be restricted to a large extent. Challenges in combating Ebola are not only limited to resources and knowledge, but also public and personal hygiene that must be adopted in the society.",
