Here we present crystal structures of SARS-CoV M pro , the activesite cysteine of which has been acylated by benzotriazole esters that act as suicide inhibitors. In one of the structures, the thioester product has been hydrolyzed and benzoic acid is observed to bind to the hydrophobic S2 pocket. This structure also features the enzyme with a shortened N-terminal segment (''amputated N finger''). The results further the understanding of the important role of the N finger for catalysis as well as the design of benzotriazole inhibitors with improved specificity.",

            "text": "The global 2003 outbreak of the highly infectious severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) was caused by a new human coronavirus, SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) (Ksiazek et al., 2003; Drosten et al., 2003; Peiris et al., 2003) . Spreading from southern China, the disease was responsible for the death of about 10% of those infected (Stockman et al., 2006) . Since 2003 there have been two isolated mini-outbreaks in China, but they have been contained in their early stages. These cases remind us of the lingering danger to human health represented by SARS-CoV as well as other coronaviruses, and the need for effective anticoronaviral therapeutics. Since the global SARS outbreak, two new coronaviruses infecting humans have been discovered (van der Hoek et al., 2004; Fouchier et al., 2004; Woo et al., 2005) . HCoV NL63, a coronavirus associated with croup (Chiu et al., 2005) , appears to be the most widespread member of the entire family. It is the causative agent of up to 10% of all respiratory diseases (Pyrc et al., 2006 and references therein) . Detected in 13 patients in Hong Kong, HCoV HKU1 is a coronavirus associated with relatively mild, community-acquired pneumonia characterized by fever, running nose, and cough (Lau et al., 2006) , although a subtype of HKU1 causing a severe obstructive pneumonia was recently identified (Kupfer et al., 2007) . Two other human coronaviruses, HCoV 229E and OC43, have been known for decades, and are believed to cause mild upper respiratory tract illnesses, including the common cold (McIntosh et al., 1967) . Furthermore, HCoV OC43 has also been reported to have a high prevalence in the brains of multiple sclerosis patients (Arbour et al., 2000) .",

            "text": "Coronaviruses are enveloped, positive-sense RNA viruses. Their large single-stranded RNA genome ranges from 27 to 31 kb (29.7 kb for SARS-CoV) and encodes several structural and auxiliary proteins as well as two large overlapping polyproteins, pp1a (replicase 1a, $486 kDa for SARS-CoV) and pp1ab (replicase 1ab, $790 kDa) (Thiel et al., 2003) . These polyproteins are subsequently cleaved to give rise to the individual nonstructural proteins essential for building the viral replicase complex. In most coronaviruses, this maturation process is performed by extensive proteolytic processing by three cysteine peptidases. There are two papain-like proteinases (PL pro ) that are responsible for acting on three cleavage sites near the N terminus of the polyproteins (Ziebuhr et al., 1995) , and the main proteinase or M pro (also called ''3C-like protease'' or 3CL pro ), which is necessary for cleaving at no less than 11 conserved sites containing a large hydrophobic residue (preferably Leu) in the P2 position, a Gln in the P1 position, and a small aliphatic amino acid residue (Ser, Gly, Ala) in the P1 0 position (Ziebuhr et al., 2000; Hegyi and Ziebuhr, 2002; Anand et al., 2003) . In contrast to other coronaviruses, the SARS-CoV genome encodes only one PL pro in addition to the M pro . Besides being involved in the processing of the polyproteins, the PL pro has a second function as a deubiquitinating enzyme (Barretto et al., 2005; Lindner et al., 2005) . Because of its pivotal role in viral replication, the 33.8 kDa main proteinase has become the prime target in the development of inhibitors directed at SARS-CoV and other coronaviruses (Anand et al., 2003 .",

Domains I (residues 1-101) and II (residues 102-184) each consist of an antiparallel b barrel; taken together, domains I and II resemble the structure of chymotrypsin-like serine proteinases (Anand et al., 2002 (Anand et al., , 2003 Yang et al., 2003; Tsukada and Blow, 1985) . The active site of the M pro is located in the interface between the two domains and consists of a Cys-His catalytic dyad, in which the cysteine acts as the nucleophile in the proteolytic cleavage reaction (Anand et al., 2002 (Anand et al., , 2003 Yang et al., 2003) . Connected by a long loop (residues 185-200) to domain II, domain III is all-helical and not only involved, to some extent, in dimer formation but also in placing the N finger next to the substrate-binding site of the other monomer. In the active conformation of the protein, the individual binding pockets for the respective amino acid residues of the substrate are accessible and the oxyanion loop (residues 138-145) has the correct shape to donate two hydrogen bonds from main-chain amides to stabilize the tetrahedral transition state of the proteolysis reaction. The two monomers in the dimer are arranged perpendicular to each other ( Figure 1 ; Yang et al., 2003) .",

            "text": "In the early stages of the 2003 SARS outbreak, one of the first drugs tried for the treatment of patients was ribavirin, an antiviral drug commonly used against a number of DNA and RNA viruses (Sidwell et al., 1972) , but this proved to be unsuccessful (Stockman et al., 2006; Knowles et al., 2003) . Left with few other options, physicians also tested HIV proteinase inhibitors (Stockman et al., 2006) , and Wu et al. (2006) found that one of them, lopinavir, targeted SARS-CoV M pro with an IC 50 of z50 mM. In their search for derivatives of lopinavir with an improved inhibitory action toward M pro , Wu et al. (2006) noticed by serendipity that the intermediate benzotriazole esters occurring during the synthesis of these derivatives were better inhibitors of the enzyme than the final products (see also Hilgenfeld and Pumpor, 2006) . These benzotriazole esters are the result of the activation of carboxylic acids by 2-(1H-benzotriazole-1-yl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate (HBTU), which was used as a coupling reagent in the synthesis of the lopinavir-like molecules. Wu et al. (2006) reported K i = 7.5 nM and k inact (=k 3 ) = 0.0011 s \u00c01 for the best of these inhibitors and suggested, on the basis of mass spectrometric analyses, that the benzotriazole esters irreversibly acylate the active-site Cys145. However, even though these K i values are among the lowest for any inhibitor of the SARS-CoV M pro described so far, Wu et al. (2006) also reported that full inhibition of the enzyme could not be achieved. Also, upon replacement of the ester oxygen by a methylene group, the inhibitors bound noncovalently to the enzyme, with K i values in the micromolar range . Such a mechanism might also apply, to some extent, to the benzotriazole esters themselves, perhaps explaining the incomplete inhibition reported by Wu et al. (2006) . Because of these uncertainties, we wanted to visualize the binding mode of benzotriazole esters to the SARS-CoV main proteinase, and have determined the crystal structures of the enzyme after incubation with two such compounds, 1-(benzoyloxy)-benzotriazole (compound XP-27) and 1-(4-dimethylaminobenzoyloxy)-benzotriazole (compound XP-59) (see Figure 2 ).",

The difference in enzymatic activity and dimer stability between the two constructs illustrates the importance of an intact N terminus (N finger). The k cat /K M of the (DSer1)/C-His 6 protein, determined by using an HPLC-based assay with the pentadecapeptide SWTSAVLQYSGFRKWA as a substrate, was 61.9 (\u00b11.5) mM \u00c01 min \u00c01 (Tan et al., 2005) . Using a FRET-based assay with a fluorogenic peptide substrate (Dabcyl-KTSAVLQY SGFRKME-Edans), this value was 167.9 mM \u00c01 min \u00c01 . The K D value for the monomer-dimer equilibrium of this enzyme species was estimated at z250 nM by using the method of Kuo et al. (2004) , much lower than the values derived for a similar construct by Graziano et al. (2006) from small-angle scattering and chemical crosslinking. Accordingly, the fraction of catalytically active (DSer1)/C-His 6 dimers at the enzyme concentration used in the assays (1.0 mM with respect to monomers) is about 0.8, and the k cat /K M of this enzyme species has to be corrected to z209 mM \u00c01 min \u00c01 . The M pro with the authentic chain termini, however, is significantly more active under the same circumstances and has a k cat /K M value of 502.3 mM \u00c01 min \u00c01 . For the latter enzyme, the K D value for dimer dissociation was estimated to be significantly lower than 100 nM, in agreement with most reports in the literature Hsu et al., 2005b) . This would indicate that > > 90% of the authentic M pro molecules exist as dimers at the concentration of 1.0 mM (with respect to monomers) used in the assays. Occasionally, much higher K D values have been reported for SARS-CoV M pro dimer dissociation in the literature (e.g., Fan et al., 2004; Chen et al., 2005a) , but in most of these cases, the enzyme did not have authentic chain termini.",

The leaving group of the reaction is 1-hydroxybenzotriazole. For the inhibitor XP-59, the K i and k 3 values were determined as 1.38 mM and 0.013 s \u00c01 , respectively. At an inhibitor concentration of 1.3 mM, approximately 97% inhibition of the enzyme was achieved. For the inhibitor XP-27, the exact determination of the inhibition constant proved difficult because of the inherent instability of this compound. UV absorption of XP-27 decreased in anhydrous dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) over time, even in the absence of enzyme, and this process was significantly enhanced by addition of a few microliters of water. Addition of XP-27 to the enzyme led to rapid inactivation, but after about 3-4 min, the enzyme activity started to recover ( Figure 3A ). A possible reason for this behavior is that the rather instable thioester product may have been partially hydrolyzed. As we shall see below, our crystal structure of the enzyme acylated by XP-27 provides an explanation for this observation. In contrast to XP-27 and its thioester product with the enzyme, XP-59 and its covalent M pro adduct were more stable, because the electron-donating nature of the p-dimethylamino group decreased the electrophilicity of the carbonyl C atom. The inhibition curve (fluorescence versus time) of XP-59 displayed the expected hyperbolic shape ( Figure 3B ). Wu et al. (2006) reported a K i value of 17.4 nM and a k 3 of 0.0013 s \u00c01 for XP-59 (their compound 4). We have no immediate explanation for the discrepancy by a factor of 80 between the K i value reported by these authors and our findings, nor for the factor of 10 between their and our k 3 values. We also do not know whether the k cat /K M value of their enzyme preparation is comparable to ours.",

The O32 atom of the reoriented Glu166 now makes a hydrogen bond to the N32 atom of His172 (2.54 \u00c5 ), just like in the active conformation (Tan et al., 2005) .

However, in the hydrophobic S2 specificity pocket, we found clear difference density (>4s) for a benzoic acid molecule. The molecule is sandwiched between the side chains of Met49 and Met165. The latter adopts two conformations, one of which (occupancy 50%) is not compatible with the presence of benzoic acid at this site. The occupancy of the benzoic acid molecule was fixed at 30%. The observation of this molecule in the S2 site immediately raises the question as to which mechanism was at work here. We assume that the thioester formed between the benzoyl group and Cys145 (with 1-hydroxybenzotriazole being the leaving group) is attacked by one of the numerous water molecules in the substrate-binding site. This results in the production of benzoic acid and restoration of the free active-site cysteine. Because of its overall hydrophobicity, the benzoic acid then binds to the nearby S2 pocket ( Figure 4B ). This interpretation is in full agreement with the observed biphasic kinetics for XP-27 ( Figure 3A ). However, even though benzoic acid itself is not an inhibitor of the enzyme up to mM concentrations (data not shown), we cannot exclude that the compound bound to the S2 pocket might originate from degradation of free XP-27 in solution over the time of the crystal-soaking experiment. In any case, our findings help explain the observation of Wu et al.

The overall root-mean-square deviation for 577 out of 600 Ca atoms is 0.36 \u00c5 . Interestingly, we found electron density for three DMSO molecules, which must originate from the DMSO used to dissolve the inhibitor in the crystal-soaking experiment. One of them fills a hole at the site where the N fingers of the two polypeptide chains approach each other, near the carbonyl groups of the Lys5 residues of both the A and the B monomer, that is, more or less on the noncrystallographic two-fold axis of symmetry (near the position where the magenta and green polypeptide segments meet in Figure 1 ). This site could be of interest for designing dimerization inhibitors. The two remaining DMSO molecules fill the space between the M pro dimers adjacent to the crystal contacts, next to the AspB244.His#A134 (DMSO2) and the GlnA256.Trp#A31/Ala#A70 (DMSO3) contacts (# marks a residue in a symmetry-related dimer).",

This causes the ''amputated N finger'' (residues 2-7, DSer1) to become more flexible. As a result, residues Gly2 and Phe3 in both monomers A and B have flipped their orientation such that the N terminus of Gly2 is now, at least in protomer B, hydrogen bonded to the Sg atom of Cys300 (domain III) of the parent monomer (at 2.39 \u00c5 in protomer B, 4.50 \u00c5 in protomer A) and the N finger can no longer stabilize the loop (residues 138-145) forming the oxyanion hole of the other monomer. This is observed in monomer B, where the oxyanion loop is in a collapsed conformation as discussed before. Yet, in monomer A, this loop is in the catalytically competent form although the main-chain conformation of Phe140 is no longer stabilized by the N finger of monomer B. But the phenyl ring of this residue is still embedded in a hydrophobic pocket consisting of Val114, Ala116, Tyr126, Tyr161, His163, and His172. The lack of an intact N finger, however, does make the loop 138-145 more flexible. This is reflected in the B factors of the main-chain atoms of the loop in monomer A (44.4-74.0 \u00c5 2 , with an average of 64.3 \u00c5 2 ), which are higher than the average B factor of the entire main chain (40.4 \u00c5 2 ). This situation is comparable to the B factors observed in the loop 138-145 of the B monomer (47.1-77.8 \u00c5 2 , with an average of 67.9 \u00c5 2 ; the average B factor for the entire main chain is 41.7 \u00c5 2 ). The high flexibility of the oxyanion-binding loop explains the fact that k cat for the enzyme with the amputated N finger is significantly lower (40.3 min \u00c01 ) than for the authentic M pro (1105 min \u00c01 ). On the other hand, deletion of the N-terminal serine may create more space in the substrate-binding site, hence the lower K M for the (DSer1)/C-His 6 enzyme.",

In another study, Hsu et al. (2005a) have shown that a deletion of the three N-terminal amino acid residues reduces the enzyme's activity by a mere 24%, whereas the fourth residue, arginine, is absolutely essential for catalytic activity and important for the formation of the dimer. In agreement with this, we previously reported almost total inactivation of the homologous main proteinase from TGEV upon removal of five residues from the N terminus (Anand et al., 2002) . In another report, removal of the seven N-terminal residues abolishes the enzymatic activity of the main proteinase almost completely, but does not seem to have much influence on dimer formation (Chen et al., 2005a ) (however, the enzyme used in this study had both N-and C-terminal extensions). It has been suggested by molecular dynamics simulations that a different dimer could form under these conditions, which involves much more elaborate contact between domains III of the monomers (Chen et al., 2005a) .

In an attempt to explain how the inhibition can proceed, Wu et al. (2006) have modeled a number of their benzotriazole inhibitors, among them XP-59, into the active site of the SARS-CoV M pro . In their model of the Michaelis complex, the benzotriazole is positioned in the oxyanion hole environment and the remainder of the inhibitor is located in the vicinity of amino acid residues Thr25, Thr26, His41, Thr45, Ala46, and Met49, leaving the carbonyl group of the benzotriazole ester close enough to the Sg of the active-site Cys145 for a nucleophilic attack to occur. This orientation of the inhibitor is possible, but then the resulting covalently bound products have to swing at least 90 around the covalent bond to occupy an energetically probably more favorable niche on top of the S1-binding site or in the S2 pocket in the two crystal structures, respectively. Because of the rather small size of the products of suicide inhibition, this should be possible without serious steric clashes. That structural rearrangements must have happened in the enzyme after the reaction with the inhibitor is clear in the crystal structure of M pro complexed with the dimethylaminobenzoyloxy moiety (from compound XP-59) where, first, the oxygen atom proposed to be stabilized in the oxyanion hole (formed by the main-chain amides of Gly143 and Cys145) during the transition state of the reaction is flipped away and makes no specific contacts anymore and, second, the side chain of the active-site residue His41 has moved away from its original position to make the stacking interactions with the inhibitor product as discussed previously ( Figure 5B ).",

The animal reservoir for the virus (most probably bats) is still existent and a renewed zoonotic transition to man cannot be excluded. Therefore, efficient drugs are needed in order to be prepared for a possible future outbreak. The SARS-CoV main proteinase (M pro ) plays a central role in the formation of the viral replicase/transcriptase complex and is thus an ideal target for the development of suitable drugs.",

Because of their high reactivity, the inhibitors presented here might not be very selective, although it is encouraging to note that in the entire main proteinase with its 12 cysteine residues, only the active-site Cys145 is acylated. Furthermore, Wu et al. (2006) reported that these compounds are not cell toxic, at least not up to a concentration of 100 mM. Starting from these lead structures, the inhibitors can now be modified by substituents occupying the S1 and S2 specificity pockets in order to improve their potency and specificity. The structures presented here also demonstrate that electron-donating substituents in the benzoyl moiety are useful to stabilize the thioester bonds with the active-site cysteine against hydrolysis. Finally, the structure of the M pro featuring an amputated N finger (residue Ser1 deleted) explains the reduced catalytic activity of this species.",

The reaction was initiated by adding proteinase (final concentration 0.5 mM) to a solution containing different final concentrations of the fluorogenic peptide (10-40 mM). The initial rates were converted to enzyme activities (mmol substrate cleaved per s).
