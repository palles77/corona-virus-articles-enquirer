Thus, adequate surveillance of HCoV is essential. This study aimed to analyze the impact of HCoV infections and their relation to severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) in a hospitalized population in Southern Brazil. A cross-sectional study was conducted at a tertiary care hospital, and assessed inpatients under investigation for SARI by the hospital epidemiology department, and all patients who had nasopharyngeal aspirates collected from January 2012 to December 2013 to detect respiratory viruses (RVs). Viral infection was detected by multiplex reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), with primers specific to the subtypes HCoV-229E/NL63 and OC43/HKU1. The overall positivity rate was 58.8% (444/755), and HCoVs were detected in 7.6% (n = 34) of positive samples. Children below two years of age were most frequently affected (62%). Comorbidities were more likely to be associated with HCoVs than with other RVs. Immunosuppression was an independent risk factor for HCoV infection (OR = 3.5, 95% CI 1.6-7.6). Dyspnea was less frequently associated with HCoV infection (p < 0.001), and HCoV accounted for 6% of the SARI cases. Three patients infected with HCoV (9%) died from respiratory infection. HCoVs are important respiratory pathogens, especially in hospitalized children under 2 years of age and in immunosuppressed patients. They may account for a small proportion of SARI diagnoses, increased need for mechanical ventilation, intensive care unit admission, and death.",

            "text": "Human coronaviruses (HCoVs) are enveloped, single-stranded, positive-sense RNA viruses that belong to the Coronaviridae family. HCoVs have been identified to be a frequent cause of respiratory tract infections. 1 Phylogenetic analysis has previously led to the identification of six strains. HCoV-229E, -OC43, -NL63, and -HKU1 are endemic worldwide and spread, mainly by the respiratory route. 2 More recently, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) have been identified, both of which were introduced into the human population by zoonotic transmission, and are associated with severe disease. 3 HCoVs are phylogenetically subdivided into alphacoronaviruses (HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63) and betacoronaviruses (all other strains). 3 These viruses were first discovered in the mid-1960s by Hamre and Procknow, who described two strains: HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-229E. 4 Subsequently, HCoV-NL63 was identified in the Netherlands in 2004 5 and HCoV-HKU1 in Hong Kong in 2005. 6 Following studies demonstrated that these viruses were associated with the common cold, through the infection of healthy volunteers. Since then, HCoVs have been considered to be mild respiratory pathogens, although reports of lower respiratory tract infections caused by HCoVs have been published. 3, 7 The most common clinical presentations following HCoV infections are non-specific influenza symptoms with benign outcomes. 8 However, in select groups of patients, these viruses can cause severe and even fatal disease. Groups at high risk include young children, the elderly, immunocompromised patients, and those with underlying conditions such as cardiac or respiratory impairment. 1, 2, 9 In Brazil, a national laboratory and clinical surveillance system was implemented following the influenza pandemic in 2009. This system aimed to monitor circulating respiratory viruses (RVs) in the country and identify novel viral pathogens. The system is based on the active investigation of hospitalized patients for influenza-like illness (ILI) and severe acute respiratory illness (SARI), along with outpatients who develop ILI. Flu-like symptoms include fever of recent onset, along with either a cough or sore throat. The presence of flu-like symptoms and other indications of disease severity, defined as oxygen saturation below 95%, dyspnea, or respiratory discomfort, are considered for the diagnosis of SARI. The SARI surveillance system has provided a large amount of data for in regards to the epidemiology of many viral pathogens, including HCoV.",

The overall positivity rate was 58.8% (444/755). Table 1 shows the frequencies of identified viruses. HCoVs were detected in 7.6% of RV positive samples (34/444). The most frequently detected viruses were HRV and RSV (162 and 161 cases, respectively). HCoV was the eighth most frequently identified viral pathogen in this study. Two or more viruses were co-detected in 127 cases (29% of positive samples). Among the HCoVs, 9 cases exhibited co-infection, mainly with RSV 3 and HRV. 2 We defined severe disease as that requiring mechanical ventilation, admission to an ICU, or having a fatal outcome, and observed no statistical difference between the groups. SARI diagnosis was significantly less frequent in the HCoV group by univariate analysis (20/34, 59% vs. 314/410, 76%; p = 0.021), but was non-significant on the adjusted analysis. Three patients died following the respiratory infection; two were in an immunosuppressed state and one did not have an underlying disease but was co-infected with two HCoVs. Figure 1 shows the temporal distribution of HCoV cases and meteorological data for Curitiba, Southern Brazil. As presented in Table 3 , there was a negative correlation between the frequencies of HCoV positive samples and the mean temperature (r = \u22120.54; p < 0.009). No correlation was found between the number of positive samples and the amount of rainfall (r = 0.14; p = 0.50). malignancy, corticosteroid treatment, and human immunodeficiency virus infection), 5 had a chronic respiratory disease, and 4 had cardiac illness. The HCoV group had a significantly lower number of patients without underlying conditions (10/34, 29% vs. 281/410, 69%, p < 0.0001). Immunosuppression was an independent risk factor was significantly more frequent among HCoV-infected patients, and was found to be an independent risk factor for infection by this virus. Between the HCoV group, although betacoronaviruses predominated in immunosuppressed patients, their detection was not significant on adjusted analysis. Previous reports have attributed this finding to the presence of the 229E subtype. 14 A cohort study previously conducted with healthy adults, healthy seniors, high-risk seniors, and hospitalized patients showed that the probability of an asymptomatic infection caused by strain 229E was higher than that caused by stain OC43, and symptoms were milder when they did occur. 16 Nevertheless, in immunocompromised patients, infection with strain 229E may result in presentation with symptoms more frequently than in healthy patients, resulting in a higher detection rate. Since in this study, the HCoV detection was performed by virus groups only (OC43/HKU1 and NL63/229E), it was not possible to evaluate the relationship between HCoV subtype and associated diseases. A recent study conducted in Brazil analyzing the impact of HCoV in patients with cystic fibrosis showed greater respiratory exacerbation rate in patients infected with NL63 strain. However, such result was not confirmed by adjusted analysis, and no significant difference in rates of respiratory exacerbation or hospitalization in patients infected by HCoV in general or a given HCoV (including NL63) was found. 17 Our study reports similar findings, as the prevalence of comorbid chronic lung disease was not different between the HCoV and other RV groups, or between alphacoronavirus and betacoronavirus groups.",

Our data do not corroborate this conclusion, as we observed severe lower respiratory tract diseases caused by coronaviruses alone, both in the presence and absence of comorbidities.",

Hospital databases (Hospital Epidemiology Division and Laboratory of Virology) and/ or medical charts of patients hospitalized for acute respiratory infection during the years 2012 and 2013 were reviewed.Inclusion criteria were defined as either hospitalization due to SARI, identified by active surveillance of the Hospital Epidemiology Division, or investigation for other RVs (despite presence of SARI). SARI was defined as the presence of ILI and signs of respiratory insufficiency (dyspnea, oxygen saturation <95%, or respiratory distress). Data were collected by completion of a form with relevant epidemiological, clinical, and laboratory questions. The Institutional Review Board of HC-UFPR approved the study (Approval number # 18714013.4.0000.0096).",

The median age was 0.5 (IQR 0.1-20.9) years for patients with HCoV infection and 0.8 (IQR 0.2-3.2) years for those with other RV infections. Nosocomial infection was significantly more frequent in the HCoV group (10/34, 29%) compared with the other RV group (43/410, 10%) (p = 0.0035). The difference in length of hospitalization was also significant; patients with HCoV infections and those with other RV infections had a median hospitalization VOL. 110 NO.3 However, none of the parameters proved to be independently linked to HCoV infection, as a multivariate analysis showed no significant differences. Dyspnea was significantly less frequent during infection with HCoVs (21/34, 61%) compared with other RVs (369/410, 90%) in the adjusted analysis (p < 0.001).Among the HCoV group, 24 patients had underlying medical conditions; 15 were immunosuppressed (mainly because of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation,",
