Two major considerations must be made when re-sterilizing masks: (1) the sterilization method effectively kills pathogens, penetrating into the fibers of the mask, and (2) the method does not degrade the operational integrity of the N95 filters.",

The chamber in the irradiator is approximately 6 inches in diameter and 8 inches tall. Since the most radio-opaque component in the masks is a thin aluminum nose piece, which is still essentially transparent to the \u223c1.3 MeV photons produced in 60 Co decay, the dose throughout the chamber should be fairly uniform.",

All masks, including the unirradiated controls, the 10 kGy, and the 50 kGy masks passed a qualitative fit test (no saccharin was detected by the subject), with the exception of one mask that had received 50 kGy that was donned improperly. For the one 50 kGy-irradiated 8210 mask that did result in saccharin taste sensation by the test subject, the cause was found to be poor donning of the mask (the subject reported cool air flowing in around his nose while breathing in during that particular test). This was the second mask tested in the series of 18, and this test failure was believed to be due to inexperience on the part of the test subject in correctly applying a tight fit to the mask. After more practice, an additional 50 kGy-irradiated 8210 mask was randomly inserted into the test matrix, and it along with all other masks resulted in no detection of the saccharin mist. The one anomalous test served to confirm that the test subject could strongly taste the saccharin mist if it entered the mask, either through the filter or around the mask periphery. The subject did notice that some irradiated masks had a slight unrecognizable odor-the Food and Drug Administration notes that gamma ray sterilization of foods can impart an odor as well [14] .",
