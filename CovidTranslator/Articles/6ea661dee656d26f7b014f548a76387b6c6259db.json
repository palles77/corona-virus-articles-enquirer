Approaches to epidemiological surveillance and control to the spread of the agents of especially dangerous diseases on endemic areas are described for zoonosis that has a medical value. The knowledge of specific design of tools for the implementation of epidemiological surveillance, monitoring and evaluation of natural foci diseases in developing countries is low; accordingly, little is known on the ecology and transmission dynamics for the agents of especially dangerous diseases. Important is to know the effectiveness of serological monitoring of the indigenous population to determine the activity of natural foci of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome, tick-borne encephalitis, tularemia, Q-fever, Lyme disease and West Nile disease. The main species of reservoirs and vectors for these agents have been determined in different regions of Ukraine. New tick-borne agents that were unknown for certain regions have been detected. These data indicate the spreading of different pathogens in combination with natural foci.",

            "text": "The spectrum of biological hazards for humans has changed over evolution. Emerging zoonotic infectious diseases have presented specific challenges in response strategies (de Cock et al. 2013; Jones et al. 2008; Keim et al. 2007 ). Unfortunately, progress in many areas of society not only has led to the reduction in range and reduced adverse events caused by biological agents, but also expanded ones. Globalization and the change of climate essentially influenced the modification of natural foci of zoonotic diseases, which have a medical value (Bradley and Altizer 2007; Pavlin et al. 2009; Semenza and Menne 2009) . Natural foci are stable with a long-time activity, while they change under climate, geographical and human influence (Keesing et al. 2010) . Dynamic changes of the population properties, level of pathogens, animal and vectors, immunological patterns of human are to be determined; anthropogenic pressure on biocenosis complexes and other conditions requiring continuous and comprehensive assessment of the epidemiological situation are investigated (Gratz 2006; Heyman et al. 2010) . Simultaneous circulation of different species of pathogens and their unequal distribution within the natural foci is the reason why there are still many unexplored questions on the nature of species-to-species interaction (Futse et al. 2008; Krause et al. 2002; Reis et al. 2011) . Epidemiological surveillance of endemic natural focal diseases is an essential task for maintaining the health-care system. The effectiveness of protection of population against natural biological threats in endemic areas depends on the timeliness and completeness of the risks of epidemic events identified, and the adequacy of measures to minimize them. Using geographic information systems optimized the control system of natural foci of a number of extremely dangerous infections. Nevertheless, constant updating of data on the major components of this approach will be the best solution enabling to make the right decisions (Armed Forces Pest Management Board 2012; Smith et al. 2009 ). The reality of today is changing the boundaries of the recognized nosological areas and expression of new biological threats as a result of climate change, intensification of migration processes and transport communication, global trade and so on (Lindgren et al. 2000) . On the other hand, continued evolution of recognized pathogens as well as new genetically modified manmade agents with unpredictable effects for environment are developing.",

There are basic classical approaches to the organization of epidemiological surveillance to natural focal diseases (Brouqui et al. 2004 ). Mandatory elements are to determine the spectrum and properties of circulating pathogens, species composition of reservoirs and vectors, influence of environmental factors (social and natural) and specific risk factors for a community. The aim of surveillance is to make decisions about ongoing public health response to EDP events (outbreaks) and to evaluate the needs for adequate measures.",

The specific species of mosquitoes have been detected as carriers of West Nile virus on Northwest Black Sea Coast (Vynograd and Komarenko 2013a; Vynograd et al. 2013) . Species composition of ticks, that were involved in the transmission of EDPs in the northern part of Ukraine, were different as compared with other regions. In addition to the mentioned above, pathogens of Anaplasma phagocytophilum and Ehrlichia spp. were shown to be present in some regions (Vynograd and Komarenko 2013b) . Analysis of the data provides many advantages in identifying national (regional) priorities to control and initiate systematic epidemiological surveillance of EDPs' natural foci. It is important to note that, at this stage, the study of reservoirs and vectors and other objects of the environment where pathogens circulate in nature should be extended; the standard case for each actual disease should be determined, and the structure and borders of natural foci should be established. This will make it possible to assess the risks to the public and apply prevention policies correctly and control the activity of natural foci.",
