Each of the (\u2212 )-strand subgenomic RNAs corresponds in size to each of the subgenomic mRNA species that are made in infected cells. We tested whether (\u2212 )-strand subgenomic RNAs might initially be synthesized from the input single-stranded ( + )-strand genomic RNA prior to the production of subgenomic mRNAs. We used a mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) defective interfering (DI) RNA, from which subgenomic RNA was produced in DI RNA-replicating cells, because this DI RNA had a functional MHV intergenic region inserted in its interior. MHV samples containing the DI particles were irradiated with UV-light and then superinfected into cells that had been infected with MHV 4 h prior to superinfection. Northern blot analysis of intracellular RNAs that were extracted 3 h after superinfection showed that genomic DI RNA and subgenomic DI RNA had similar UV-target sizes, indicating that ( \u2212 )-strand genomic DI RNA synthesis from input genomic DI RNA probably occurred prior to the subgenomic-size DI RNA synthesis. We discuss why, in the course of coronavirus transcription, ( \u2212)-strand genomic-length coronavirus RNA synthesis might occur before subgenomic-sized RNAs of either polarity are made.",

The 5%-end of MHV genomic RNA contains a 72-77-nucleotide long leader sequence. The MHV-specific genes, which are all located downstream from the leader, are separated from one another by an intergenic region. MHV-infected cells produce genomic-size mRNA and six to seven species of subgenomic mRNA species that make up a 3%-coterminal nested group, in which each mRNA carries one more gene in the 5% direction than the last (Lai et al., 1981; Leibowitz et al., 1981) . All these virusspecific mRNAs have a leader RNA sequence at their 5%-end (Lai et al., , 1984 Spaan et al., 1983 ) and a poly (A) tail at the 3%-end. On the subgenomic mRNAs, the leader sequence is fused to the intergenic region (Spaan et al., 1983; Lai et al., 1984) . Genomic-size and subgenomic-size (\u2212 )-strand RNAs, each of them corresponding in size to each of the subgenomic mRNA species, are also present in coronavirus-infected cells (Sethna et al., 1989) .

Sawicki and Sawicki (1990) proposed that (\u2212)-strand subgenomic RNAs are synthesized from (+)-strand genomic RNA and serve as templates for subgenomic mRNA synthesis. They speculated that (\u2212 )strand RNA synthesis terminated at the intergenic regions to produce (\u2212)-strand subgenomic RNAs. Another possibility is that (\u2212 )-strand subgenomic RNAs may be synthesized by processing of precursor (\u2212 )-strand genomic RNAs that are synthesized from (+)-strand genomic RNA. Other models propose that subgenomic mRNAs are synthesized prior to production of ( \u2212 )-strand subgenomic RNAs. In these models, subgenomic mRNAs may result from the processing of (+)-strand genomic RNA, from transcription off (\u2212)-strand genomic RNA by a unique leader-primed transcription mechanism, in which short 'free' leader RNAs serve as primers for subgenomic mRNA synthesis , or from polymerase jumping off the leader sequence to an intergenic region during subgenomic mRNA synthesis (Spaan et al., 1983) . The (\u2212 )strand subgenomic RNAs would then be copied from the subgenomic mRNAs, and might be active templates for subgenomic mRNA synthesis (Sethna et al., 1989; Sawicki and Sawicki, 1990; Schaad and Baric, 1994) or dead-end transcription products (Jeong and Makino, 1992) .",

The 5%-most, 3.1-kb long region of MIGCAT was made from the corresponding region of a cloned MHV-JHM DIssF DI RNA (Makino et al., 1990) , PR6 (Makino et al., 1991) . The second region contained an intergenic sequence (5%-AAUCUAAUCUAAACUUUA-3%) and the 5%-most, 0.27-kb region of the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene. The most 3%-end region of MIGCAT came from the very 3%-end of the 0.46-kb long MHV-JHM genomic RNA. MIGCAT DI RNA contained MHV-JHM DI RNA cis-acting replication signals (Kim et al., 1993; Kim and Makino, 1995; Lin and Lai, 1993) , a packaging signal (van der Most et al., 1991; Fosmire et al., 1992; Woo et al., 1997) , and an intergenic sequence. We expected MIGCAT DI RNA to replicate and transcribe subgenomic DI RNA in MHV-infected cells. MIGCAT DI RNA transcripts were synthesized in vitro using T7 polymerase (Makino and Lai, 1989) , and then transfected into MHV-A59-infected DBT cells (Hirano et al., 1974) using a lipofection procedure, as described previously (Makino et al., 1991) . Virus released into the culture supernatant was collected 15 h after RNA transfection and was subsequently passaged twice on DBT cells to amplify the DI particles containing MIGCAT DI RNA (MIGCAT DI particles). We used this virus preparation, which is designated P2, in this study. The presence of MIGCAT DI RNA was confirmed by Northern blot analysis of virion RNA extracted from the gradient-purified P2 virus sample using CAT-specific probe (data not shown).",

A 30-W germicidal lamp at a distance of 40 cm was employed for this purpose. In the experimental group, DBT cells were initially infected with helper MHV-A59, and 3 h later these cells were superinfected with the UV-irradiated P2 sample. In the control group, the DBT cells were coinfected with helper MHV-A59 and UV-irradiated P2 sample. MHV RNA replication activities, but not transcription activities, were active very early in infection (An et al., 1998 ) therefore, we expected that MIGCAT genomic DI RNA replication, but not transcription, would start immediately after coinfection in the control group; we expected to see similar susceptibility to UV-light irradiation of MIGCAT subgenomic and genomic DI RNAs, because subgenomic-size MIGCAT DI RNA should be synthesized after replication of genomic MIGCAT DI RNA. Intracellular RNAs were extracted 7 h p.i. of MHV, and MIGCAT-specific RNAs were detected by Northern blot analysis, using a CAT gene-specific probe ( Fig. 2A,C) , in which digoxigenin-11-dUTP was incorporated (DIG system, Boehringer Mannheim). After hybridization of probe to immobilized RNAs on the membrane, an anti-digoxigenin antibody-alkaline phosphate conjugate was added to the membrane, to allow binding to the hybridized probe. The RNA signal was detected on an X-ray film after treating the membrane with a chemiluminescent alkaline phosphatase substrate. Accumulation of genomic MIGCAT DI RNA and subgenomic MIGCAT DI RNA were quantitated by densitometric scanning of the autoradiograms, and susceptibility of MIGCAT-specific RNAs to UV-irradiation was plotted (Microsoft, Cricket graph) (Fig. 2B,D) . Comparison of the accumulation of subgenomic MIGCAT DI RNA to genomic MIGCAT DI RNA showed that in both the experimental and control groups, the genomic and subgenomic DI RNAs had very similar susceptibilities to UV-irradiation. These data indirectly suggested that (\u2212 )strand subgenomic MIGCAT DI RNAs that might act as templates for subgenomic MIGCAT DI RNA synthesis were not synthesized from the input single-stranded (+)-strand genomic MIGCAT DI RNA prior to synthesis of subgenomic MIGCAT DI RNA. Our data also suggested that synthesis of (\u2212 )-strand genomic-size MIGCAT DI RNA occurred prior to the synthesis of ( + )-strand subgenomic MIGCAT DI RNA, indicating that synthesis of full-length (\u2212 )strand genomic RNA is probably a prerequisite for subgenomic MHV RNA synthesis.",

In these UV-transcription mapping studies, UV-lesions are introduced into the (\u2212 )-strand template RNAs that accumulate during coronavirus replication. A study of UV-irradiation of MHV-infected cells at 2.5 or 3 h p.i. suggested that MHV mRNA synthesis requires the presence of a genomic-length RNA template early in infection (Yokomori et al., 1992) . Their conclusion is consistent with our present data. UV-irradiation late in coronavirus infection showed that a UV-target size of the template for mRNAs is very similar to their physical size (Jacobs et al., 1981; Stern and Sefton, 1982; Yokomori et al., 1992; Den Boon et al., 1995) , indicating that coronavirus mRNAs are not accumulated by the processing of a genomic-size (+ )strand precursor RNA. These UV-transcription mapping studies late in infection, however, did not clarify whether mRNAs are synthesized from a genomic-size (\u2212 )-strand template RNA or each mRNA is synthesized from the (\u2212 )-strand template RNA of its own size. Although UV-irradiation was used in the present study, the aim of UV-irradiation and UV-irradiation procedure were different from the previous UV-transcription mapping studies. We specifically tested the possibility that (\u2212 )-strand subgenomic RNAs are synthesized from the full-length (+ )-strand genomic RNA prior to subgenomic mRNA synthesis. For this purpose, UV-lesions were introduced to (+ )strand MIGCAT DI RNA in virus particles and UV-unirradiated helper virus was provided for the replication of UV-irradiated MIGCAT DI RNA. Our present data, suggesting that the synthesis of full-length (\u2212 )-strand genomic RNA is a likely prerequisite for subgenomic MHV RNA synthesis, does not contradict the conclusion from previous UV-transcription mapping studies.",

We could not completely eliminate the possibility that UV-lesions introduced into genomic MIGCAT DI RNA may also affect some undescribed biological functions of MIGCAT genomic RNA that work prior to initiation of ( \u2212 )-strand RNA, however, this has not been implicated in previously published studies. It is possible that the introduction of UV-lesions in genomic MIGCAT DI RNA inhibits translation of MIGCAT DI-specific protein, and suppression of MIGCAT-specific protein synthesis may affect the initiation of (\u2212)-strand RNA. This is less likely, because translation of a DI-specific protein of MHV-JHM-derived DI RNA, from which MIGCAT DI RNA was constructed, is not necessary for DI RNA synthesis (Liao and Lai, 1995) . It has been postulated that sequences near the 5%-region and 3%-end of MHV genomic RNA may interact, and that this interaction is important for RNA synthesis (Lin et al., 1996) . Consequently, there is a possibility that the introduction of UV-lesions may damage the structure of the 5%-region of genomic MIGCAT RNA and suppress (\u2212)-strand RNA synthesis. However, it is reported that the very 3%-end 55 nt plus poly (A) is sufficient for MHV (\u2212 )-strand synthesis (Lin et al., 1994) .

Alternatively, our data may indicate that the synthesis of (\u2212 )-strand genomic-size RNA is required for the synthesis of (\u2212 )-strand subgenomic RNA from the (+ )-strand genomic MIGCAT DI RNA. Perhaps (\u2212 )-strand subgenomic RNA synthesis requires a template that is a double-stranded. Initiation and elongation of MHV (\u2212 )-strand RNA synthesis does not require a double-stranded RNA structure, because MHV (\u2212 )-strand RNA synthesis must occur from the input MHV single-stranded genomic RNA in MHV-infected cells. Accordingly, if (\u2212)-strand subgenomic MHV RNA is synthesized from double-stranded genomic-size MHV RNA prior to subgenomic mRNA synthesis, then this possible requirement for a doublestranded RNA structure would probably center on termination of ( \u2212 )-strand subgenomic RNA synthesis.",
