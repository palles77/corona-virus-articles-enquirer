The purpose of this project was to study the feasibility of turning an entire ward into a negative pressure ward to handle a surge of airborne infectious patients. To accomplish this objective, we investigated specifically how to contain inert airborne particulates (surrogates for infectious micro-organisms), to a single hospital ward using modified ventilation airflows designed to increase capacity to care for large numbers of patients. We also sought to understand particulate movement from rooms to hallways with door openings. To this end, the ventilation air supply to a decommissioned hospital ward was modified and a tracer aerosol was released and monitored in real-time on the ward.",

In addition, when the hallway door to the patient room was opened at the end of the test, Fig. 2 shows the rapid spillage of aerosol out of the patient room into the adjacent hallway, resulting in a reduction of the aerosol concentration in the patient room and a concurrent increase of the aerosol concentration in the hallway. A significant drift in the background hallway concentration of particles was observed in the 0.5e1.0 mm size range during both the baseline and in the modified mode tests (Fig. 2) . Since the 100% outdoor air ventilation system utilized MERV 14 filters with an approximate 83% efficiency for 0.5-mm diameter particles, as compared to 95% for 1.0 mm particles and greater than 99% for 2.5 mm particles [2] , changes in the outdoor particle concentration of 0.5e1.0 mm particles are expected to have some impact on the indoor concentrations.",

Table 1 details the protection efficiencies for the hallway adjacent to the patient room during aerosol release into the room with the ventilation system in the baseline and modified (whole floor negative air) operation modes. The maximum measurable PE was greater than 99% for the 1.0e2.5 mm and 2.5e5.0 mm particles during both the baseline and modified operation modes. The average PE, as measured during the 2.5-hr test in the baseline mode, and including the four entry/exits into the patient room, was 99.8% for the 1.0e2.5 mm particles and >99.7% for the 2.5e5.0 mm particles. During the modified mode, the On average, the PE was statistically significantly lower using the modified ventilation airflow rate compared to the baseline condition (p < 0.0001). During the four door entry/exits the average minimum PEs were lower during the modified mode (93.5e93.6%) than those for the normal mode (98.6e98.7%). Lower observed PEs in the modified mode may be explained, at least in part, by the 52% reduction in the outdoor air ventilation in the hallway. Thus, particles released into the hallway from the patient room accumulated to higher concentrations with the lower ventilation rate. The measurement uncertainty of the particle counters is estimated to be \u00b110%. For a PE of 98%, this measurement uncertainty translates into an uncertainty for the PE of approximately 0.5% (i.e. 97.6%e 98.4%).",

Thus, changes in the ambient aerosol concentrations produced errors in the interpretation of the aerosol concentrations. This was especially evident in the small size particles (i.e. 0.5e1.0 mm), which were not removed with high efficiency by the air filtration system. Some researchers [13] have used a tracer gas such as sulfur hexafluoride (SF6), which is a unique tracer not present in significant concentrations in the outdoor air. However, since SF6 is a gas and not a particle, the transport and removal mechanisms will differ from that of particles. Ideally we would use a unique aerosol with an aerodynamic size similar to that of infectious disease droplet nuclei, however there currently is no instrumentation capable of real-time measurements a unique aerosol tracer. Some researchers [9] have used unique fluorescent particles, but these studies typically involve collecting non-real time integrated air samples on filters with subsequent analyses.",
