Shortly thereafter, short dsRNAs -or short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) (reviewed in ref. 1 ) -were generated artificially and used to demonstrate that this process also occurs in mammalian cells, usually, but not always, without triggering the innate immune sys tem, which normally recognizes RNAs as part of an antiviral defence mechanism (see page 421).

For one, RNAi is a fundamentally important regulatory mechanism in the cell, and tapping into it in the interests of therapeutic benefit could result in side effects. Exogenously introduced dsRNA sequences can sequester components that make up the cellular machinery involved in gene silencing (see page 396), thereby reducing the accessibility of the machinery to a class of small RNAs known as microRNAs (miRNAs) that are entering the natural cellular pathway 4,5 . In addition, some synthetic siRNAs contain sequence motifs that can induce type I interferon responses and stimulate the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines 6-8 . During the past few years, many scientists have searched for solutions to overcome these limitations and to increase the safety of potential RNAi-based therapeutics. This article explores recent strategies to minimize undesirable secondary effects, describes new approaches to delivery and discusses RNAi therapies that are being tested. As it is anticipated that this technology will be applied to an increasing range of diseases, the potential problems and solutions that could one day transform RNAi into a conventional treatment for human diseases warrant careful attention.",

Its catalytic core in plants and animals (with the exception of single-celled organisms) is AGO2, a member of the highly conserved Argonaute protein family 10 . These small RNAs can silence gene expression by two mechanisms: post-transcriptional gene silencing (PTGS) 11 , and transcriptional gene silencing (TGS) 12,13 ( Fig. 1 ). PTGS can, in turn, be divided into two main mechanisms: direct sequence-specific cleavage, and translational repression and RNA degradation. Direct sequence-specific cleavage occurs when the targeted mRNA is perfectly complementary to the siRNA and is degraded after site-specific cleavage by the RISC. Translational repression and RNA degradation occur when the small RNA guide sequence has only limited complementarity to the target in the 'seed' region (nucleotides 2 to 8 from the 5\u2032 end of the guide strand), with base-pairing usually occurring in the 3\u2032 untranslated region (UTR).

The identification of piRNAs has been restricted to germline cells. Recently, a new class of endogenous siRNAs (endo-siRNAs or esiRNAs) has been identified in the gonads and somatic tissues of D. melanogaster 26-29 and in mouse oocytes 30,31 . In mice, endo-siRNAs have been proposed to regulate retrotransposon movement 30,31 . Several families of small RNAs, including repeat-associated siRNAs (ra-siRNAs), tiny non-coding RNAs (tncRNAs), trans-acting siRNAs (ta-siRNAs) and scan RNAs (scnRNAs) ( Table 1) are found in fungi, plants and animals, but so far none of these has been observed in mammals.

Because not all siRNAs achieve equivalent levels of target knockdown, large-scale siRNA screening is often performed for any given target to find the most potent inhibitors. These have yielded some rules for siRNA design. For example, to facilitate incorporation into the RISC, the 5\u2032 end of the antisense (guide) strand should be designed to have a lower thermodynamic stability than the 5\u2032 end of the sense strand. The proportion of the nucleotides guanosine and cytidine should be around 50% or lower, and targeting of known protein-binding sites in mRNA regulatory regions should be avoided because binding of regulatory proteins may block siRNA-target pairing. For the same reason, intramolecular structures in the target should be avoided. Statistical analyses have also found a preference for certain nucleotides at specific positions within the siRNA 34 . Many computer programs are available for identifying the optimal target sequences for a given gene 34,35 . One of these, an artificial neural network, has been used to develop a genome-wide siRNA library for humans and to identify effective siRNAs for 34 targets 36 .",

A single 2\u2032-O-methyl group on the passenger strand of an siRNA duplex can abrogate activation of the Toll-like receptors 38 and prevent tox icities due to the activation of type I interferon pathway gene expression. It has recently been demonstrated that fluoro-\u03b2-D-arabinonucleic acid (FANA39 or as 4\u2032-S-FANA 40 ) or arabinonucleic acid (ANA41) modifications can increase both the serum stability and the potency of siRNAs.

Given the way that RNAi has transformed basic research and the unprecedented speed with which it has reached the clinic, the coming years promise to be exciting. Figure 1 . Mechanisms of cellular gene silencing a, Primary microRNAs (pri-miRNAs) are, in plants and animals, processed by Drosha and its partner DGCR8 into precursor miRNAs (pre-miRNAs) and then transported to the cytoplasm by exportin 5 (XPO5). In the cytoplasm, they are bound by a Dicer-containing pre-RISC and processed to yield the guide sequence that is loaded into the holo-RISC, which contains all the components required for gene silencing. AGO2 is the catalytic core of the RISC (present but not shown in the schematically drawn holo-RISC). The guide sequence binds to the corresponding target sequences in the 3\u2032 UTRs of cellular mRNAs. If the miRNA guide sequence is fully complementary to its target site (left pathway), it triggers site-specific cleavage and degradation of the mRNA through the catalytic domain of AGO2. If the basepairing is incomplete (right pathway) but includes pairing of the seed region (nucleotides 2-8 of the miRNA) with the target, translational inhibition occurs, and this can be accompanied by non-sequence-specific degradation of the mRNA in P bodies. b, Similarly to miRNAs, artificially transcribed shRNAs (in this case from a plasmid) are transported to the cytoplasm by XPO5. The dsRNA in the cytoplasm is recognized and processed by Dicer into ~21-25nucleotide siRNA fragments that are loaded into the RISC. The siRNAs can target complementary sequences of cellular mRNAs and trigger their degradation through AGO2mediated cleavage. c, When siRNAs are present in the nucleus and are complementary to promoter regions, they can trigger chromatin remodelling and histone modifications that result in transcriptional gene silencing. In mammalian cells, the details of this mechanism are still under investigation but are known to include Argonaute-family proteins. Accessory proteins Figure 2 . In vivo delivery strategies for therapeutic siRNAs a, Cholesterol groups can be linked to modified siRNAs to enhance their stability before systemic delivery. The most common siRNA modifications are 2\u2032-O-methyluridine or 2\u2032fluorouridine substitutions (blue circles) combined with phosphorothioate linkages. b, Polycation nanoparticles can direct delivery of the siRNAs to specific cells through the use of surface ligands (such as transferrin) that bind to receptors on target cells. c, SNALPs encapsulate modified siRNAs into cationic or neutral lipid bilayers coated with diffusible PEGlipid conjugates. SNALPs allow siRNAs to be taken up by cells and released by endosomes. d, Masked endosomolytic agent (MEA)-Dynamic PolyConjugates (DPCs) are similar to SNALPS but smaller, and contain a ligand that allows targeted cell delivery. The release of the siRNA from the endosome is also improved by the inclusion of a pH-labile bond in the MEA-DPC particles. e, Tagging specific antibodies with protamine or other positive charges allows the delivery of siRNAs to specific cell types via receptor-mediated uptake. f, Chemically linking or co-transcribing siRNAs with RNA aptamers allows the targeted delivery of the siRNAs to cells expressing the appropriate receptor.
