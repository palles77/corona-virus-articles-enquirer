Technical advances in fields such as genomics and proteomics, synthetic chemistry and robotics, computer modeling, molecular and genetic epidemiology, and information technology have yielded unprecedented new insights into disease pathogenesis, host immunity, pathogen virulence, transmission patterns and drug resistance 1,2 . These advances have facilitated the discovery and design of new vaccines, diagnostics, treatments and other interventions that have had an important part in reducing the burden of infectious diseases. For example, the development of more than 20 licensed medications against human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) has greatly reduced HIV-related morbidity and mortality in settings in which these drugs are used 1, 2 . The list of vaccine-preventable diseases has grown with the licensure of vaccines against pathogens such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae type b and hepatitis A and B viruses, and improved vaccines for pertussis 1, 2 . Many other therapeutics and vaccine candidates are in the research 'pipeline' to treat and prevent disease caused by both endemic pathogens and emerging and re-emerging microbes such as H5N1 avian influenza virus and potential agents of bioterrorism.",

A strong momentum was established, and subsequent research advances in areas such as recombinant DNA technology were truly extraordinary, compounding the possibilities for even greater accomplishments. The doubling of the overall NIH budget between fiscal year (FY) 1999 and FY 2003 to $26.7 billion provided another big boost (Fig. 1) HIV-AIDS funding alone, an estimated $2.9 billion in FY 2005, now comprises more than 10% of the total NIH budget and approximately one third of the NIAID budget. This increase has not come at the expense of NIH support for other areas of infectious diseases, as increases for non-AIDS infectious diseases and immunology have increased more than the mean increases for the NIH as a whole over the past decade. This level of funding certainly is well justified by the enormity of the medical, public health and societal challenges posed by the HIV-AIDS pandemic. There are unprecedented scientific opportunities to have an effect on the lives of people throughout the world and on the course of the pandemic through an improved understanding of HIV pathogenesis and the development of new or improved approaches to treatment, prevention, care and diagnostics 4, 5 .",

At the time I wrote that \"\u2026resources for biomedical research in general are unlikely to increase substantially in the foreseeable future, and in some areas will be constrained. Yet the opportunities C O M M E N TA R Y for advances in knowledge and the practical application of these advances will surely increase. Hence, the dichotomy between aspirations and resources will probably widen.\" 3 To make the best use of available resources and to limit the gap between aspirations and resources, a top-to-bottom examination of every NIH research portfolio was undertaken in the mid-1990s to prepare for the possibility of a substantial budget decrease; it was enlightening to see that there were many areas in which research could have been carried out more efficiently. Fortunately, the budget decreases we expected did not come to pass, thanks to a 'deus ex machina' in the form of advocacy efforts and congressional and administrative leadership, which resulted in the aforementioned doubling of the NIH budget 7 . NIH-funded investigators, especially those in infectious diseases research, enjoyed substantial annual budget increases that helped facilitate important advances in pathogenesis, natural history, epidemiology, behavioral and social sciences, vaccine development and therapeutics 5 . Indeed, some younger investigators in the areas of HIV-AIDS and other infectious diseases have been fortunate to have worked their entire careers relatively unfettered by the fiscal constraints that have typified other eras in biomedical research funding. But as with other areas of NIH-funded research, infectious disease research, including the HIV-AIDS research 'portfolio' , now faces the reality of a constrained level of funding; in HIV research, only HIV vaccine research is projected to see a substantial increase in FY 2006 (ref. 10 ). The selective increase in HIV vaccine research ous threats for a year or two (such as West Nile virus and SARS) and do not drive the budget in a significant and sustained way, compared with HIV-AIDS, a pandemic that rages out of control 1,2 , and bioterrorism, which is perceived to be an 'indefinite' threat 12 . The substantial NIH funding base for biodefense, like that for HIV-AIDS, is likely to be maintained for the foreseeable future together with the funding base for infectious diseases in general.",

In FY 2004, the latest year for which final figures are available, NIAID funded more than 1,100 competing awards. Regardless of budget constraints, we feel that it is imperative not to fall below the threshold of 950 RPGs, to avoid 'turning off the faucet' of innovation fed by basic research. However, to maintain the level of 950 awards per year, we will need to take some unfamiliar measures. Almost certainly, the NIAID along with the NIH as a whole will no longer be able to provide investigators with yearly inflationary increases in their grant funding, and we may need to reduce the average dollar amount of new awards. In addition, success rates (that is, the proportion of grant applications that receive funding) will drop from about 24% in FY 2004 to about 18-19% in the period FY 2007 to FY 2009. Of course, it remains essential that all of us in the medical and public health communities continue to argue cogently for adequate attention and sustained research support for all diseases of global health importance. The public health challenges facing us are substantial and the scientific opportunities for true breakthroughs abound. At the same time, we must collectively prepare for the difficult questions that are posed more and more frequently as policymakers and the public challenge what some perceive to be 'research entitlements' in well funded areas of inquiry such as HIV-AIDS research. Such questions, asked during congressional hearings, meetings with administration officials and briefings of constituency groups include the following: how are you spending the large bolus of money you already have received; how do you set your priorities; can you accomplish even more by increasing efficiencies; and-perhaps most salient-is your research yielding products that benefit the health of the American people? In today's budget environment, the administration, congress and the public expect us to continually ex amine the research enterprise; in other words, there can be no 'sacred cows' that are exempt from scrutiny and review.",

The answer is almost certainly no, given the recognition by those at the White House, by members of congress on both sides of the aisle and by the general public that HIV-AIDS is a plague of historic proportions 4 . Certainly, cuts in HIV-AIDS funding will not be part of NIAID strategic planning 8 . However, with HIV-AIDS and other infectious diseases, we will need to make the best of available funding by re-examining how we do business. Several necessary steps must be taken (Fig. 3) . First, we must strive for more collaborations and better cooperation among investigators in government, industry, academia and philanthropic organizations, with an eye toward 'harmonization' and improving economies of scale. In many infectious disease disciplines, we can probably eliminate redundancy in our clinical trials networks. We also must standardize assays, reagents and endpoints such that results of investigations are broadly relevant to an entire field, rather than to only the subset of research groups that have chosen a particular set of parameters 11 . It also is imperative that we eliminate unnecessary duplication in the research enterprise to the extent possible. Many times duplication is very important and indeed necessary to confirm research findings, but unnecessary duplication is unacceptable in a time of fiscal constraint.",

However, to rapidly develop safe and effective products, we have been asked by the government that provides our funding to intensify and accelerate this process. We cannot do this at the expense of our basic research 'portfolio' . Thus, we have sought creative ways to modify the traditional processes of research and development to move more rapidly ahead while continuing to preserve the excellence in basic research that Bioshield also provides industry with assurances that markets for their products will exist should they invest the resources necessary to fully develop them. To help provide these incentives, BioShield establishes a secure 10-year funding source for the purchase and stockpiling of new vaccines and drugs for use in an emergency. Thus, BioShield has given us new ways to both 'push' and 'pull' science toward needed countermeasures: basic research provides the push, and new incentives to industry for product development provide the pull. Project BioShield may represent a new model for enticing industry to participate in developing products for which a profitable market is not assured and is emblematic of a broader shift in the role of the NIH in advanced product development. Increasingly, the NIH and NIAID are expanding their roles beyond traditional areas of basic, preclinical and small-scale research into advanced product development using mechanisms such as vaccine production contracts and new partnership programs 8 (Fig. 4) . This approach transcends HIV-AIDS and biodefense and can apply to countermeasures for a broad range of infectious diseases. In this context, the NIAID Vaccine Research Center has proven to a be an extraordinarily successful model, developing vaccines against pathogens such as HIV, the SARS coronavirus, smallpox virus and West Nile virus, taking ideas from basic research to the production of 'pilot lots' to the conduct of clinical trials (National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. Dale and Betty Bumpers Vaccine Research Center, http://www.niaid.nih.gov/ vrc/).

In FY 1984, the NIAID was theThe global challenge of infectious diseases: the evolving role of the National Institutes of Health in basic and clinical research Anthony S Fauci The US has entered a new period of fiscal restraint. What does this mean for basic research? Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, discusses the way forward for research scientists in the US. Anthony S. Fauci is with the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Department of Health and Human Services, Bethesda, Maryland 20892-2520, USA. e-mail: (afauci@niaid.nih.gov) Much of the budget growth of NIAID can be attributed to large increases in spending on HIV-AIDS, from $19.6 million in FY 1984 to $1.5 billion in FY 2005, and on biodefense research, from $41.7 million in FY 2001 to $1.7 billion in FY 2005, and on larger-than-average increases in budget for other emerging and reemerging infectious diseases. Clearly, the infectious diseases research community has fared well in terms of NIH support. Policymakers and taxpayers have recognized that research on global infectious diseases deserves robust support, that it is now axiomatic that we live in a global community and microbes do not recognize borders, and that we must address infectious disease threats regardless of their geographic origin 4 .",
