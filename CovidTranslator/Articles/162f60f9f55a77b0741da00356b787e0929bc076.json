However, it is critical to determine whether SARS-CoV-specific memory T cells can persist for long periods of time. In this study, we analyzed the cellular immune response from 21 SARS-recovered individuals who had been diagnosed with SARS in 2003 by using ELISA, CBA, ELISpot and multiparameter flow cytometry assays. Our results demonstrated that low levels of specific memory T cell responses to SARS-CoV S, M, E and N peptides were detected in a proportion of SARS-recovered patients, and IFN-c was the predominant cytokine produced by T cells after stimulation with peptides. Cytometry analysis indicated that the majority of memory CD8 ? T cells produced IFN-c, whereas memory CD4 ? T cells produced IFN-c, IL-2 or TNF-a. These results might provide valuable information on the cellular immune response in recovered SARS-CoV patients for the rational design of vaccines against SARS-CoV infection.",

The cells were incubated in the presence or absence of a pool of SARS-CoV-derived peptides including S, M, E and N with or without anti-CD28 mAb. After stimulation for 3 days, the levels of IFN-c in the cell cultures were assessed by ELISA. The results in Fig. 1a show that in the absence of stimulation, there was no detectable level of IFN-c production. Remarkably, the stimulation of PBMCs from recovered individuals but not from normal donors with SARS-CoV S peptides resulted in significantly high levels of IFN-c production (P \\ 0.01). Similar results were also obtained when the cells were stimulated with SARS-CoV N peptides (P \\ 0.05). Although the cells that were stimulated with M peptides produced IFN-c, the level of IFN-c production was not significantly different compared to using medium alone (P [ 0.05). In addition, no IFN-c was detected in SARS-CoV-recovered individuals after stimulation with SARS-CoV E peptides (P [ 0.05). Furthermore, no marked difference in the production of IFN-c by recovered individuals and healthy donors was observed when the PBMCs were stimulated with PMA plus ionomycin (P [ 0.05). The statistical results showed that 66.70, 28.57, 14.29, and 38.10% of the SARS-CoV-recovered individuals tested in this study responded to stimulation by S, M, E, and N peptides, respectively, to produce IFN-c (data not shown). Further analysis revealed that 9.52% of SARS-CoV-recovered persons produced IFN-c in response to all four peptides, 14.29% to three, 19.05% to two, 28.57% to one, and 28.57% did not respond to any of four peptide antigens (Fig. 1b) .",

            "text": "Memory T cells consist of both CD4 ? and CD8 ? T cells that can rapidly acquire effector functions to kill and eliminate infected cells and secrete cytokines to inhibit replication of pathogens and to regulate immune responses. After stimulation with antigen, memory CD4 ? T cells differentiate into effector cells. According to the cytokine production, CD4 ? T cells can be divided into Th1 and Th2 cells. Th1 cells secrete IFN-c, IL-2 and TNF-a and participate in the cellular immune response. On the other hand, Th2 cells secrete IL-4, IL-5, IL-10 and IL-13 and enhance humoral immune response [9, [14] [15] [16] . Our previous studies on immune response of SARS-recovered individuals have demonstrated that after natural infection, both CD4 ? and CD8 ? T cells are involved in immune responses to SARS-CoV S, M, E and N antigens. Memory CD8 ? T cells display an effector memory cell phenotype expressing CD45RO -CCR7 -CD62L -. In contrast, the majority of IFN-c ? CD4 ? T cells are central memory cells expressing CD45RO ? CCR7 ? CD62L - [12, 13, 19, 20] . The existence of memory T cells in response to SARS-CoV antigens after immunization of mice with DNA vaccine has been described. T cell proliferation, IFN-c production, DTH responses and cytotoxic T cell activities as well as the induction of high levels of specific antibodies were also demonstrated in our studies and those of other [3] [4] [5] . In addition, the heterogeneity of Th1 cells indicated that T cells specific for SARS-CoV antigen could be divided into three subsets based on IL-2 and IFN-c expression, including IFN-c ? cells, IL-2 ? and IFN-c ? cells and IL-2 ? cells [18] . It has been confirmed recently that Th1 cells producing multiple cytokines are more efficient as effector cells. Single CD4 ? IFN-c-producing cells are more limited in mediating optimal and sustained protection. The factors controlling the quality of Th1 responses seem to be the amount and duration of antigen, the type of antigen-presenting cell and the innate cytokine milieu [2] . In our study, we found that in the absence of antigen, memory T cells can still persist for 4 years in a proportion of SARS-CoVrecovered individuals, but most of the memory Th1 cells and memory CD8 ? T cells are single-cytokine-producing cells. This might imply that the memory T cells will ultimately become unresponsive or die. The poor Th1 response could be one of the reasons for the diminished antigenspecific neutralizing antibody production. Therefore, the naturally acquired immune response does not persist for a long period of time and might not provide a protection upon re-exposure to SARS-CoV infection.",
