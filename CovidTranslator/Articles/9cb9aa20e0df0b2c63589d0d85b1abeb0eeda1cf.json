            "text": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) emerged in the Guangdong province of China in late 2002 and spread to 29 countries. By the end of the outbreak in July 2003, the CDC and WHO reported 8437 cases with a 9.6% case fatality rate. The disease was caused by a previously unrecognized coronavirus, SARS-CoV. Drawing on experience with animal coronavirus vaccines, several vaccine candidates have been developed and evaluated in pre-clinical trials. Available data suggest that vaccines should be based on the the 180 kDa viral spike protein, S, the only significant neutralization antigen capable of inducing protective immune responses in animals. In the absence of clinical cases of SARS, candidate vaccines should be evaluated for efficacy in animal models, and although it is uncertain whether the United States Food and Drug Administration's \"animal rule\" would apply to licensure of a SARS vaccine, it is important to develop standardized animal models and immunological assays in preparation for this eventuality. This report summarizes the recommendations from a WHO Technical Meeting on Animal Models and Antibody Assays for Evaluating Candidate SARS Vaccines held on 25-26 August 2005 in South Mimms, UK, provides guidance on the use of animal models, and outlines the steps to develop standard reagents and assays for immunological evaluation of candidate SARS vaccines.",

The disease emerged in the Guangdong province of China in late 2002 [2] and spread to 29 countries mostly within Asia, although Europe and North America were also affected, notably Toronto, Canada. The epidemic was finally controlled by July 2003 through strict implementation of prevalence for SARS-CoV antibody, although they had no history of SARS-like disease. SARS-CoV-like viruses that were isolated from civets and raccoon dogs had more than 99% homology with human SARS-CoV, with major differences found in ORF8, whose deletion has been suggested to represent a sign of adaptation to humans [12] . Only four amino acid residues in the receptor glycoprotein ACE2binding domain of the viral spike protein differ between the human epidemic SARS-CoV strains and civet strains, but they cause more than a 1000-fold difference in binding affinity to the ACE2 molecule [13, 14] . Although a high prevalence of SARS-like coronaviruses were found in Chinese horseshoe bats [15, 16] , their great genetic diversity makes it difficult to identify which one might be the ancestor of SARS-CoV and to decide with certainty whether bats indeed are the animal reservoir of the virus.",

Pathology in SARS patients has been associated with diffuse alveolar damage, epithelial cell proliferation and multinucleated giant cell infiltrates of epithelial or macrophage origin, suggestive of syncytium-like formation in the lung. The virus can be recovered from peripheral blood mononuclear cells, respiratory secretions, stools, urine and even sweat (for a review, see [19] ). SARS vaccine development efforts were initiated very rapidly after the identification of the etiologic agent, even though the immune correlates of protection were not known. Research efforts to identify protective antigens and to develop animal models were undertaken in parallel with efforts to develop candidate vaccines [20] , drawing on experience with animal coronavirus vaccines and using several vaccine strategies, including inactivated virus vaccines, purified subunit vaccines, plasmid DNA and viral vector-based vaccines as well as virus-like particles. Much effort has been made to identify appropriate animal models for SARS-CoV replication and pathogenesis. Several research groups have shown that mice [21, 22] , ferrets [23] , hamsters [24] and nonhuman primates [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] support replication of SARS-CoV with varying degrees of associated disease.",

Moreover, the protective effect of the vaccine should be demonstrated in more than one animal species expected to react with a response predictive for humans. The endpoint of animal studies should be clearly related to the desired benefit in humans (i.e. enhancement of survival or reduction in major morbidity), and the data generated should allow selection of an effective dose in humans. At the present time it is uncertain whether the \"animal rule\" would apply to licensure of a SARS vaccine.

In addition, standardization of antibody assays and the establishment of a WHO International Standard for SARS-CoV antibody were also discussed. This report endeavors to summarize the recommendations from this meeting, based on consensus agreement. Recommendations for use of each animal model are given in Section 2 below.

At this time, no single model offers a direct reproduction of what was seen in humans with SARS. Pathology (including pneumonitis, alveolar edema, and diffuse alveolar damage (DAD)) in humans is probably the most difficult element to reproduce in an animal model. Attention also should be given to the reduction of viral shedding because this would likely correlate with decreased risk of further spread of the disease among humans. In using animal models to study aspects of SARS-CoV infection, it must be emphasized that the kinetics of viral replication and appearance and resolu-tion of pathological findings are much more rapid in animal models than in humans.",

Whereas vaccines or antivirals may be addressed in many models, pathogenesis is best evaluated in those animal models for which immunological tools and reagents are available for detailed analysis of the immune response to the vaccine. This includes inbred mice and rhesus and cynomolgus macaques. It may actually be worthwhile to enhance the virulence of a SARS-CoV isolate by serial passages in an animal model to produce a challenge virus stock for vaccine studies that would elicit more reproducible disease in the animals. If a highly virulent host-adapted virus were to become available, such as a mouse-adapted or a monkey-adapted SARS-CoV strain, demonstration of the capacity of vaccines to protect against challenge with these more virulent strains would provide an almost ideal animal model. Different models may also need to be employed to evaluate pathogenesis versus immunogenicity. For pathogenesis studies in animal models, mortality is not required as a readout. It would be ideal to develop animal models with comparable levels of mortality to that seen in humans (\u223c10% overall), including the increased mortality at increased age (\u223c50% > age 60). The optimal result would be to demonstrate efficacy of vaccines or antivirals in SARS-CoV animal models that mimic human morbidity and mortality and that show protection without vaccine-associated immunopathology.",

Thus, mice immunized with live-recombinant vaccines expressing the SARS-CoV spike protein, using rabies virus [51] , vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) [52] , adenovirus (Ad5) [27, 53] or attenuated vaccinia virus MVA [36, 38] as a vector, as well as mice immunized with DNA vaccines expressing the S gene [37, 54] , developed neutralizing antibodies to SARS-CoV and were protected against SARS-CoV challenge. Similar findings were reported after mucosal immunization of hamsters and AGMs using a bovine parainfluenza virus type 3 (BPIV3) vector expressing the SARS CoV S gene [33, 39] . Several whole inactivated virus and recombinant protein candidate vaccines also have been developed and shown to elicit a neutralizing antibody response that provided protection against infectious challenge [55] [56] [57] [58] [59] [60] . In addition, passively administered sera from vaccinated animals prevented SARS-CoV infection upon subsequent challenge of na\u00efve mice, demonstrating that antibodies induced by these vaccines did confer protection [37, 52] .",

Enhanced disease and mortality have been observed in kittens immunized against or infected with a type-I coronavirus, feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV), when subsequently exposed to FIPV infection [63] [64] [65] . Aggravated FIP is apparently a result of enhanced viral entry into macrophages mediated by sub-neutralizing antibody levels [66] . Children vaccinated with inactivated respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccines developed serious disease on subsequent exposure to RSV [67] [68] [69] . Individuals exposed to one of the four serotypes of Dengue virus developed severe disease when subsequently infected with a second, different serotype [70, 71] . Enhanced disease following RSV vaccine or dengue infection occur by different mechanisms than FIPV. In view of such examples of enhanced disease following infection in a vaccinated host, there has been heightened concern that a similar phenomenon could occur with SARS-CoV vaccines. It was highly recommended, therefore, that known mechanisms of disease enhancement observed with other viruses and especially with other coronaviruses should be examined in SARS-CoV infections, especially in vaccinated animals. Although none of the studies to date have shown enhanced respiratory disease following SARS-CoV challenge in previously immunized animals, further studies in this area are warranted in view of some of the available in vitro data.",

This phenomenon was seen with pseudo-typed lentiviruses expressing SARS-CoV spike protein of civet sequence specificity, but not with pseudo-typed viruses expressing spike proteins of human SARS-CoV isolates.

The role of enhanced viral entry, as observed in these in vitro studies, has not been related to any known component of human disease or infection in vivo.

Although these findings are worrisome, several questions were raised regarding the significance of the observation. The MVA-SARS-S vaccine used in these experiments was poorly immunogenic in the ferrets. The question of whether there could have been any co-pathogen in the animals was raised. It also would be important to know if the observed phenomenon depends on the MVA vector or on the animal model. It was strongly urged, therefore, that the experiment be repeated in ferrets.

The process of establishing a WHO IS involves an international collaborative study, in which the candidate IS is compared with other samples. If the results of the tests are suitable, the candidate IS assigned a provisional arbitrary unitage, a report is distributed for approval by study participants and for eventual approval by the WHO Expert Committee on Biological Standardization (ECBS).

Data from several collaborative studies demonstrate that use of an IS generally reduces the level of variability between assay results.",

Examples of potential problems can be found in HBV and Parvovirus B19 studies [79] , which showed that different assay kits gave different results even when the IS was included in the assays. Another issue is the degree of antigenic homology between the viral antigen used for the preparation of the IS and the virus used in the assays. In a JEV collaborative study, a candidate antibody IS, which had been prepared from the sera of vaccinees immunized with an inactivated vaccine that was antigenically different from some of the viruses used in VN assays, demonstrated that the response to at least some inactivated vaccine is strain specific and the candidate IS was consequently not established by the WHO ECBS. Whether a panel of monoclonal antibodies to SARS-CoV could be used to prepare an IS is an attractive alternative which should be explored.",

One serum sample was selected for further evaluation based on crossreactivity with four SARS-CoV strains and on Western blot analysis. This serum was freeze dried in 0.5 mL aliquots and was then assessed for stability by VN assays. The Chinese standard was assigned a VN titer of 52.7 with 95% confidence limits of 47.6-62.2.",

All were in good health and their plasma tested negative for blood-borne agents. Plasma samples were processed by a combination of cold ethanol fractionation and ultrafiltration. In September 2003, three lots of IgG were produced and assayed by nationally-agreed procedures. The stock of immunoglobulin currently available is sufficient to treat 100 patients.

It is therefore desirable to establish an antibody IS to serve as a basis of comparison in all VN assays. The most important activity at this time is to obtain a suitable source of antibody. A number of options can be considered, such as convalescent human sera, post-immunization human sera, monoclonal antibodies or hyperimmune animal sera.
