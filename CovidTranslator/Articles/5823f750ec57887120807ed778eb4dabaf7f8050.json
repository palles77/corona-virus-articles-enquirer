In the comparison with several hydrophobic functionalities, alkane, cycloalkane and aromatic rings, the phenyl group was fitted on the S2 pocket of the R188I mutant protease to obtain a (2R,3S)-PIS derivative (4). The docking simulations of the other three stereoisomers of (2R,3S)-4 hardly interacted with the R188I mutant protease and therefore the (2R,3S)-isomer (4) as a candidate for this research was selected. The (2R,3S)-PIS derivative (4) has the following characteristics: (a) The substrates by nature have involved small amino acids (Ser, Ala or Gly) at the P1 0 position of SARS 3CL protease. However, it may be preferable to adopt the phenyl group, which was optimized as the serine-type inhibitor SK23 (2). 13 (b) As with SK23 (2), the cyclohexyl ring may have the essential functionality of the P1 position, as well as stabilizing interactions of other positions. (c) The substrates at the P2 position are Leu, Val, Phe and Met with the hydrophobic side chains and therefore the S2 pocket is rather hydrophobic in nature. Consequently, the phenyl ring makes good contact with target regions. This is interesting in the results of docking simulations. The S2 pocket of the R188I mutant protease barely allowed the phenyl functionality of the serine-type inhibitor. (d) Although the S4 pocket prefers hydrophobic side chains (Ala, Val or Pro), aromatic derivatives on the synthetic substrates are acceptable. Especially, cinnamoyl residues play an important role to interact with the mutant protease. This result strongly supports those of Bai's 15 and our 13 information (Scheme 1).",

Based on these results, we decided to synthesize and evaluate inhibitory activity against SARS 3CL mutant protease. It appears to be a reasonable binding mode by the surface mode of the protease with SK80 (4) shown in Fig. 2A . The functionalities at the P1 0 , P1, P2 and P4 sites of SK80 (4) were located on the S1 0 , S1, S2 and S4 pockets with hydrophobic spaces, respectively. As depicted in Fig. 2B , two amide groups of SK80 (4) were involved in hydrogen bonding interactions with His164 and Gln189. These interactions of SK80 (4) with the R188I mutant protease were found to be identical to those of SK23 (2) with the protease. This suggests that carbonyl of the benzoyl group of the inhibitor (4) interacts with the active site of Cys145 and His41 of SARS 3CL protease. Interestingly, the distances of hydrogen and oxygen between the two amide groups of SK80 (4) as the docking simulation exhibited 2.1 and 3.1 \u00c5, respectively. These values are reasonable to estimate the intramolecular hydrogen bonding networks. Therefore, the fixed eight-membered cyclic structure in the scaffold motif of SK80 (4) is proposed to locate the active site of SARS 3CL mutant protease by induced fit (Fig. 2C ). In comparison with the stable conformation of SK80 (4) in absence of the SARS 3CL protease, a molecular mechanics calculation for conformational analysis by SPARTAN'14 was attempted (Fig. 2D) . The distances of intramolecular hydrogen bonds between the corresponding two amide groups of 4 showed 2.0 and 5.3 \u00c5, respectively. This result suggests that the conformation of 4 by the intramolecular hydrogen bond of two amide groups is partly fixed to increase the inhibitory activities against the SARS 3CL mutant protease. We conclude that the two amide groups of SK80 (4) interact to form inter-and intra- molecular hydrogen bondings and the binding of the SARS 3CL mutant protease and SK80 (4) using induced fit are shown (Fig. 2) . Since any protease inhibitor needs to have an orthogonal relationship between anti-virus activity and microbial activities or cytotoxicity, antibacterial and antifungal activities and cytotoxicity for SK80 (4) were investigated. The antifungal activities of SK80 (4) against Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain X2180-1A and Candida viswanathii NBRC10321 were evaluated by our assay protocols. 19 In addition, we tested the bacterial activities of SK80 (4) against E. coli NBRC3972 and Pseudomonas putida NBRC14164 for gramnegative and Micrococcus luteus NBRC13867, Bacillus subtilis NBRC111470 and Staphylococcus epidermidis NBRC12993 for gram-positive. As a result, there were no inhibitory activities for any screened microbials (MICs > 800 mg/mL). The cytotoxicity of SK80 (4) was performed against Hela cells by a standard MTT assay using WST-8 protocols. 20 Although SK80 (4) at 1 lM concentrations was evaluated against Hela cells RCB 0007 (5000 cells), the cell death ratio caused by these compounds was less than 10% and therefore showed practically no cytotoxicity.",

The inhibitors containing 3,5-and/or 4-methoxy groups on a phenyl ring exhibited moderate activities. In contrast, cinnamate derivatives 10, 17 and the phenylpropanoate derivative18 increased the inhibitory activities to show the IC 50 values of 65-85 lM (entries 7, 8, 9). The CH 2 O of Cbz group of 17 and the double bond of cinnamoyl group of 10 played a similar role and consequently both the phenyl rings interact with the S4 pocket to show approximately same activities. The inhibitor containing a 3-methoxy group on a phenyl ring (12) had 65 lM as an IC 50 value (entry 10)",
