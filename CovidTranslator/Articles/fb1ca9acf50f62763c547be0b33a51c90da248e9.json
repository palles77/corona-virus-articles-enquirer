            "text": "HCoV NL 63 primarily infects the upper respiratory tract, typically causing mild upper respiratory infectious symptoms such as cough, rhinorrhoea, and fever. The clinical course of HCoV NL63 infection is more severe in immunocompromised patients. Several inhibitors are known to reduce in vitro replication of the virus, but there is no effective antiviral treatment or vaccine at present. 2 HCoV NL63 virus is transmitted by airborne droplets and infection is community acquired. Community-acquired respiratory viruses are known to account for many cases of interstitial pneumonia as a common complication following allo-haematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). 3 During immune reconstitution after allo-HCT, there is increased susceptibility to pulmonary viral infections, partly because of T-lymphocyte dysfunction due to the reversed CD4/CD8 ratio. 4 Multiple factors such as conditioning therapy, donor type, prolonged cytopenia, use of immunosuppressive drugs and GVHD predispose to prolonged immune reconstitution after allo-HCT. 5 The most commonly identified viral pathogens in the late-postengraftment phase are CMV and varicella zoster. 6 However, in many cases of suspected post transplant viral respiratory tract infection, no aetiological agent is identified. 7 We present a case of fatal HCoV NL63 pulmonary infection during the late-engraftment phase, 5 months after an allo-HCT with a matched unrelated donor in a patient without active GVHD and receiving only modest immune suppressive treatment.",

It was noted that the son spent every day at the kindergarten. At admission, the patient presented with a dry cough and intercostal pain due to coughing. He developed a fever on the day of admission. Neutrophil levels were 2.5 \u00c2 10 9 /l and lymphocyte levels 0.4 \u00c2 10 9 /l; C-reactive protein level had elevated to 34 mg/l (0-10). The chest X-ray showed bilateral infiltrates that were predominantly localized to the lower right lobe. BAL examination was performed twice. The BAL fluid taken at the day of admission was PCR positive for HCoV NL 63, whereas that taken at day 11 was negative for HCoV NL63. The BAL and several tracheal and nasopharyngeal fluid examinations before and during admission were negative for fungi, acid-fast bacilli, gram stain and culture, cytology, CMV, and respiratory viruses (RSV, influenzavirus A \u00fe B, parainfluenzavirus, metapneumovirus, adenovirus, rhinovirus and Pneumocystis jiroveci). On the day of admission, i.v. empirical antimicrobial therapy comprising carbapenemes, caspofungin and trimethoprim was initiated. There was no relief of symptoms. He was intubated at day 4, as his respiratory status deteriorated. At day 7, caspofungin treatment was replaced by lipid amphothericin B, and steroid treatment was initiated (80 mg/day) for idiopathic pneumonia syndrome (IPS) without improvement.",

The BAL fluid at day 11 of admission and the final PCR analysis post mortem were negative for HCoV NL63, suggesting that the patient had cleared the virus. The time of onset of respiratory symptoms and the radiology and autopsy findings are consistent with development of IPS.
