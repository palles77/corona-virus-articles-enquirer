All residues involved in the catalysis, substrate binding and dimerisation are 100% conserved. Comparison of the polyprotein PP1AB sequences showed 86% identity. The 3C-like cleavage sites on the coronaviral polyproteins are highly conserved. Based on the near-identical substrate specificities and high sequence identities, we are of the opinion that some of the previous progress of specific inhibitors development for the SARS-CoV enzyme can be conferred on its SARS-CoV-2 counterpart. With the 3CL molecular model, we performed virtual screening for purchasable drugs and proposed 16 candidates for consideration. Among these, the antivirals ledipasvir or velpatasvir are particularly attractive as therapeutics to combat the new coronavirus with minimal side effects, commonly fatigue and headache. The drugs Epclusa (velpatasvir/sofosbuvir) and Harvoni (ledipasvir/sofosbuvir) could be very effective owing to their dual inhibitory actions on two viral enzymes. How to cite this article:",

The World Health Organisation has declared this a global public health emergency -on 15 February 2020, there are more than 65,000 confirmed cases reported, and the death toll is over 1500.

The 3-chymotrypsin-like protease (3CL pro , aka main protease, M pro ) is considered to be a promising drug target. Tremendous effort has been spent on studying this protein in order to identify therapeutics against the SARS-CoV in particular and other pathogenic coronaviruses (e.g. MERS-CoV, the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus) in general because they share similar active sites and enzymatic mechanisms. The purpose of this study is to build a molecular model of the 3CL pro of the SARS-CoV-2 and to carry out virtual screening to identify readily usable therapeutics. It was not our intention, however, to comment on other structure-based drug design research as these will not be timely for the current epidemic.",

Among these, we first noticed velpatasvir ( Figure 1A , D) and ledipasvir, which are inhibitors of the NS5A protein of the hepatitis C virus (HCV). Both are marketed as approved drugs in combination with sofosbuvir, which is a prodrug nucleotide analogue inhibitor of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp, or NS5B). Interestingly, sofosbuvir has recently been proposed as an antiviral for the SARS-CoV-2 based on the similarity between the replication mechanisms of the HCV and the coronaviruses 14 . Our results further strengthen that these dual-component HCV drugs, Epclusa (velpatasvir/sofosbuvir) and Harvoni (ledipasvir/sofosbuvir), may be attractive candidates to repurpose because they may inhibit two coronaviral enzymes. A drug that can target two viral proteins substantially reduces the ability of the virus to develop resistance. These direct-acting antiviral drugs are also associated with very minimal side effects and are conveniently orally administered (Table 4 ).",

During the 2003 SARS outbreak, despite lacking a clinical trial, they were tried as an emergency measure and found to offer improved clinical outcome 18 . However, some scientists did express scepticism 19 . By analogy, these compounds were speculated to act on SARS-CoV 3CL pro specifically, but there is as yet no crystal structure to support that, although docking studies were carried out to propose various binding modes 20-23 . The IC 50 value of lopinavir is 50 \u03bcM (K i = 14 \u03bcM) and that for ritonavir cannot be established 24 . Although this is far from a cure, based on our results that the two CoV 3CL pro enzymes are identical as far as protein sequences and substrate specificities are concerned, we are of the opinion that this is still one of the recommended routes for immediate treatment at the time of writing (early February 2020).",

This study is timely in view of the recent outbreak of COVID-19. The rationale of repurposing existing drugs to tackle the global viral outbreak is sound. The manuscript is also well-written and structured. It should be noted that:The authors compared their model with the recently published crystal structure of 3CLpro and found a high similarity between the two structures. They also obtained a similar list of top-ranked drug candidates when the crystal structure was subjected to the same screening protocol.Several studies using similar modeling and virtual screening approaches have also been published recently. Some suggestions for improving the manuscript:The authors proposed that the HCV drugs velpatasvir and ledipasvir, and thus Epclusa and Harvoni, could be attractive drug candidates for treating SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, there is no direct evidence to support this claim. To support this claim, the authors should connect the computational results with experimental data. To test their hypothesis, the authors should at least prove (or disprove) that the two HCV drugs could inhibit the biochemical activity of 3CLpro of SARS-CoV-2.To further test the hypothesis, the two NS5A inhibitors should be tested using in vitro assays such as viral RNA PCR assay.If there are no such experimental data to support the claim, the authors may consider revising their conclusion to \"the computational results provide a rationale for further experimental validation of treating SARS-CoV-2 with velpatasvir and ledipasvir\".",

The manuscript started with comparing polyprotein PP1AB sequences of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, based on which the 3D structure of SARS-CoV-2 3CLPro protein was constructed. The authors then performed virtual screening against SARS-CoV-2 3CLPro using a library of 7173 purchasable drugs. Considering both binding affinities and known side effects, the authors recommend velpatasvir and ledipasvir, and further suggest combining them with another HCV RdRp inhibitor sofosbuvir, aka repurposing the Epclusa and Harvoni for treating the coronavirus. This is a concise and timely report, and has proposed new therapeutic possibilities for the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The manuscript could be further improved by addressing the following comments.",
