Importantly, although Legionella spp turned out not to be a new human pathogen but one that had caused human diseases for centuries, HIV was a new pathogen to humans, and its origin was traced to simian immunodeficiency viruses in primates. 8 The public health threats posed by emerging diseases have been well described in 2 reports from the Institute of Medicine, one in 1992 and one in 2001. 9, 10 Since the discovery of Legionella and HIV, many emerging infectious diseases have had important infection control implications. This review will focus on several of the most important threats, including novel coronaviruses (severe acute respiratory disease [SARS] and Middle East respiratory syndrome [MERS] ), hemorrhagic viruses (Lassa, Ebola), and novel influenza viruses, and the infection control strategies required to mitigate the associated public health threat posed by these viruses.",

Of the approximately 1,400 known human pathogens, 58% are zoonotic, including 73% of the 117 that meet the definition for emerging or re-emerging infectious pathogens. 14 Importantly, all of the pathogens that are the focus of this article are zoonotic. A more complete list of pathogens considered to have emerged via a species jump have been published. 15 Karesh et al have reviewed how zoonotic diseases result from natural pathogen ecology and how other circumstances, such as animal production, extraction of natural resources, and antimicrobial application, change the dynamics of disease exposure to human beings. 16 The stages in emergence of pandemic zoonotic diseases have also been reviewed. [17] [18] [19] Morse et al described 3 stages in emergence of zoonotic diseases: (1) pre-emergence (encroachment into wildlife habitat and change in land use); (2) localized emergence (expansion of the wildlife-human being interface, for example Ebola virus); and (3) pandemic emergence (international travel, for example SARS, HIV and AIDS). 18 Pike et al described 5 stages in zoonotic disease emergence: (1) exclusive to animals; (2) primary human infections only; (3) limited human-to-human transmission; (4) sustained human-to-human transmission; and (5) exclusive to humans. 17 The 1992 Institute of Medicine report on microbial threats listed the factors in infectious disease emergence as follows: (1) ecological changes, including those caused by economic development and land use (agriculture: dams, changes in water ecosystems; deforestation/reforestation; flood-drought; famine; climate changes);",

The most important microorganisms have included methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, 30 vancomycin-resistance enterococci, 31 extendedspectrum \u03b2-lactamase-producing enteric gram-negative bacilli (especially Escherichia coli, Klebsiella, and Enterobacter), 32 and carbapenem-resistance Enterobacteriaceae. 33 Pathogens with enhanced virulence in recent years have included Clostridium difficile (BI/NAP1/027) 34 and norovirus (GII.4 strains). 35 Also of concern are continued outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases, mumps 36 and measles, 37 and the resurgence of pertussis. 38 ",

First, inadequate screening procedures when patients enter a health care facility can potentially allow transmission from an ill patient to HCP, other patients, or visitors. Second, inadequate supplies of personal protective equipment (PPE) or inadequate training of HCP in proper donning and doffing procedures can increase the risk of exposure for HCP.",

Any vegetative bacteria would be inactivated by an agent active against a nonenveloped virus or mycobacteria.

Transmission of Lassa virus to humans occurs most commonly through ingestion or inhalation of the virus. Mastomys rodents shed the virus in urine and droppings, and direct contact with these materials through touching soiled objects, eating contaminated food, or exposure to nonintact skin can lead to infection. Person-to-person transmission may occur after exposure to virus in the blood, tissue, secretions, or excretions of a Lassa virus-infected individual.

Recently, cases have been reported in which persons who had recovered from EVD developed recrudescent infection with Ebola virus being recovered from protected body locations, such as eyes and central nervous systems. Ebola is not transmitted through the air or by water. However, in Africa, it may be acquired by handling bushmeat and contact with infected bats.

Influenza pandemics are relatively rare; there have been only 4 in the last 100 years. Multiple influenza A pandemics are likely to have occurred in the last 4 centuries, including 3 in the 18th century, 4 in the 19th century, 3 in 20th century, and 1 in the 21st century. 106 The first pandemic of the 20th century occurred in 1918 because of the novel A(H1N1) influenza virus, followed by pandemics in 1957 because of A(H2N20), 1968 because of A(H3N2), and 2009 because of novel A(H1N1). 107 In addition, influenza A(H1N1) was reintroduced in 1977, which may have been caused by a laboratory release. In the era before 1977, there was only a single circulating strain of influenza causing seasonal influenza in humans. Since 1977, both A(H1N1) and A(H3N2) have circulated.",

Since its widespread emergence in 2003 and 2004, A(H5N1) has spread from Asia to Europe and Africa and has become entrenched in poultry in some countries. To date it has been reported in 16 countries, infected >500 persons with a reported mortality of approximately 60%. The incubation period for A(H5N1) is generally 2-8 days (maximum, 17 days), which is much longer than the 2-to 3-day incubation period for normal seasonal influenza. Other known H5 subtypes include H5N2, H5N3, H5N4, H5N5, H5N6, H5N7, H5N8, and H5N9.",

Such training should be individualized to the specialty of the health care providers [ie, physician, nurse, respiratory therapist]); (2) team training using mannequins; and (3) team training in the designated containment unit. \u2022 Train team personnel on donning and doffing using an explicit written list of all donning and doffing steps. \u2022 Screen and exclude health care personnel unable to wear the proper personal protective equipment. Consider excluding from the care team personnel at high risk for disease acquisition or more severe illness, such as persons with nonintact skin, pregnancy, and immunocompromised persons. Consider excluding trainees from providing care. \u2022 Store an adequate supply of personal protective equipment. \u2022 If needed, have dedicated point of care laboratory equipment. \u2022 Develop a method to safely dispose of solid and liquid wastes. \u2022 Restrict visitors (if indicated) and maintain a log of all visitors. \u2022 Maintain a log of all health care personnel providing care.\u2022 Develop a plan for managing health care personnel with unprotected exposure to the infectious agent (eg, needlestick). \u2022 Assure that care team members receive proper rest.",
