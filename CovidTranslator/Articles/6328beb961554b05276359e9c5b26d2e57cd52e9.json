Biochemical analyses and immunofluorescence microscopy demonstrated that these hybrid genes were correctly expressed in eukaryotic cells and that the hybrid proteins were transported to the plasma membrane. The rate of transport to the Golgi complex of G protein with an immunoglobulin # membrane cytoplasmic domain was approximately sixfold slower than G protein with its normal cytoplasmic domain. However, this rate was virtually identical to the rate of transport of ~m heavy chain molecules measured in the B cell line WEHI 231. The rate of transport of G protein with a hemagglutinin cytoplasmic domain was threefold slower than wild type G protein and G protein with a p23 cytoplasmic domain, which were transported at similar rates. The combined results underscore the importance of the amino acid sequence in the cytoplasmic domain for efficient transport of G protein to the cell surface. Also, normal cytoplasmic domains from other transmembrane glycoproteins can substitute for the G protein cytoplasmic domain in transport of G protein to the plasma membrane. The method of constructing precise hybrid proteins described here will be useful in defining functions of specific domains of viral and cellular integral membrane proteins. I NTEGRAL membrane proteins and secretory proteins are synthesized on membrane-bound ribosomes of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) I. Signal peptides, required to initiate transfer of nascent polypeptides across the ER during synthesis, have been identified for most eukaryotic secretory and integral membrane proteins thus far examined (7, 51) . Addition of high mannose core oligosaccharides occurs on the cisternal surface of the rough ER during translocation of the nascent chain (49) . Hydrophobic regions of 20-30 amino acids serve to anchor glycoproteins in the membrane. Secretory proteins lack these transmembrane hydrophobic regions and are completely translocated across the ER membrane. Also, complete translocation of the extracytoplasmic domain 1.

From their site of synthesis in the rough ER, integral membrane and secretory proteins are transferred to their site of function, which can include the ER, Golgi complex, lysosomes, or plasma membrane. The mechanisms that direct proteins to these specific destinations in the cell are not well understood, with the exception of mannose 6-phosphate which targets some enzymes to lysosomes (10, 13) .",

            "text": "An earlier study on VSV G protein addressed the role of the cytoplasmic domain in this transport process. When cDNA clones encoding G proteins in which the carboxylterminal half of the normal cytoplasmic domain was replaced with 3-23 extraneous amino acids encoded by SV40 are expressed in transfected cells, G protein is transported to the cell surface at a much slower rate than the wild type G protein (as suggested by rate of acquisition of sugars in the Golgi complex that are resistant to removal by endoglycosidase H [endo H]). When the entire normal 29 amino acid cytoplasmic domain is deleted from G protein and replaced with 3 or 12 vector-encoded amino acids, G protein accumulates in rough ER and nuclear membranes and is not transported to the cell surface (47) . A different approach to examining the role of the cytoplasmic domain in transport of G protein to the cell surface yielded similar results. In VSV-infected cells, microinjection of antibodies directed against the 11 carboxyl-terminal amino acids in the cytoplasmic domain of G protein has little effect on the exocytotic transport of G protein, but microinjection of antibodies directed against the 22 carboxyl-terminal amino acids in the cytoplasmic domain completely abolishes G protein transport to the surface (4). These studies, and similar studies examining expression of cDNA clones encoding the Rous sarcoma virus or influenza virus envelope glycoproteins with altered cytoplasmic domains, show that the structure of the cytoplasmic domain is important to a normal rate ofglycoprotein transport to the cell surface (15, 62) . Such studies suggested that the cytoplasmic domains of at least some proteins might constitute signals that facilitate transport to the cell surface. Deletions have also been constructed in regions of cDNA clones which specify the cytoplasmic domains of the Semliki Forest virus E2 glycoprotein (18) or a murine major histocompatibility antigen (H-2L d) (39, 65) . These mutant glycoproteins are expressed on the cell surface. However, portions of the normal cytoplasmic domains were retained in the constructions (3/31, 7/31, or 11/31 amino acids) and rates of transport through the cell were not measured.",

Deblocked oligonueleotides were purified by electrophoresis on 12% polyacrylamide gels.

Extension of primers on the phage template was carried out using the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I as described (46). Singlestranded template remaining after the extension was nicked by incubation with a low concentration of S1 nuclcase before transformation of Escherichia coil strain JMI03 (33) . 15-25% of plaques screened hybridized (21) with the respective 5'-[32p]-labeled oligonucleotide.

The G-encoding fragment was obtained from a mutant generated by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis of the G gene, with a single nucleotide change at position 1483 (46) to produce a BamHl site (plasmid pTMB). This recombinant results in the in-frame fusion of the coding sequences of G protein and p23, and was expected to encode a hybrid protein of 612 amino acids: the aminoterminal 485 amino acids of G protein, and the carboxyl-terminal 127 amino acids of p23.

Internal labeling of G protein in the nuclear membrane and a GolDlike region is detected in some cells expressing the wild type G protein but is frequently difficult to resolve due to the extensive accumulation of G protein on the plasma membrane (Fig. 2, A and B; 48 ). In most cells (60-90%) expressing G# or G protein with a shortened cytoplasmic domain (G*), immunofluorescent labeling of the plasma membrane was observed (Fig. 2 , C-F), however it appeared less intense than for the wild type G protein. The internal labeling pattern of transfected cells that expressed G proteins with cytoplasmic domains of three amino acids included a reticular ER-like pattern including the nuclear envelope and a perinuclear Goigi-like region. These results suggest that a short cytoplasmic domain derived from a normal cellular glycoprotein Um and a shortened cytoplasmic domain from G protein are functional in transport of G protein to the cell surface.",

            "text": "During synthesis of G protein on rough ER and nuclear membranes, there is cotranslational addition of two high mannose-type oligosaccharides (41, 49) . After synthesis, G protein is rapidly transferred to a site in the Golgi complex, where its oligosaccharides are modified and become resistant to removal by the enzyme endo H (23). Thus the time course of transport of G protein to this site can be measured from its rate of acquisition of endo H-resistant oligosaccharides. To determine the time course of transport of G proteins with short cytoplasmic domains, cells transfected with pGu, pG*, and pa 1473H 1 were pulse-labeled with [35S]methionine, then chased by incubation in medium containing unlabeled methionine for various lengths of time. Immunoprecipitates from cells at each time point were treated with endo H, and labeled proteins were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and fluorography (Fig. 3) . The time course of transport of G protein containing a Ur, cytoplasmic domain was slower (h/2 = 105 min) than that observed for the wild type A and B) . The mobility of G proteins after removal of oligosaccharides by endo H is indicated for the wild type (arrow) and mutant (arrowheads) G proteins. As expected, the apparent molecular weights of G proteins with shortened cytoplasmic domains determined on SDS-polyacrylamide gels were less than that observed for the wild type G protein. Preexposed x-ray films obtained from this and similar experiments were quantified by densitometry and the rate of acquisition of endo H-resistant oligosaccharides for each of the glycoproteins was calculated. Results presented are the means of at least two experiments (C). G protein (t,/2 = 20 min). G protein containing only the first three normal amino acids in its cytoplasmic domain had a similarly reduced rate of acquisition of endo H-resistant oligosaccharides. We also found that in some cases, 4 or 6 h after synthesis, as much as 15-25% of 1473H1 glycoprotein molecules had acquired resistance to cleavage by endo H.",

WEHI 231 cells have characteristics of an undifferentiated B lymphocyte that produces #m and us mRNAs in similar amounts, both of which are translated into protein (34) . They synthesize large quantities of monomeric lgM as a membrane receptor, but they do not secrete IgM due to lack of synthesis of the J polypeptide chain and possibly other components required to assemble the pentameric form for secretion (28) . It has been determined that biosynthesis and maturation of tzm occurs via a pathway similar to the VSV G protein from the rough ER through the Golgi complex to the plasma membrane (36, 53, 60) , however an accurate rate of transport for this protein is difficult to extrapolate from existing data (17, 60) .

Detergent extracts of cells harvested at each time point were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-tz or anti-~ sera. To identify the mature form of IgM on the cell surface, WEHI 231 cells were subjected to radioiodination followed by immunoprecipitation with antisera directed against ~ heavy chains, lmmunoprecipitated proteins were reduced, alkylated, and precipitated with acetone before incubation with endo H and analysis by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and fluorography (Fig. 4) . The half-time for acquisition of endo H-resistant oligosaccharides by Gu in COS-1 cells was ~2 h and similarly the half-time for acquisition of such oligosaccharides by 35Slabeled #m was 2 h in WEHI 231 cells. The electrophoretic mobility of the ['25I]-labeled cell surface form of Ur, increases after incubation with endo H (Fig. 4, lanes 16 and 17) as 1-2 oligosaccharides on the mature protein are unprocessed and of the high mannose-type, thus susceptible to removal by endo H (25) . Virtually all the 35S-labeled Um was mature 8 h after synthesis (Fig. 4, lanes 14 and 15) and comigrated with the ~2~I-labeled ~m, consistent with the fact that (given a halftime of 2 h) ~94% of the Ur, molecules have passed through the Golgi complex. Although turnover of both m and /d m occurred during this experiment, analysis by densitometry of radioactivity in each form of u,, at the time points shown in Fig. 4 as well as earlier time points (e.g., 30 min) indicated that no selective degradation of the endo H-sensitive form of #m occurred in these cells (data not shown; 17). Thus, the ratio of Um molecules in the endo H-resistant form to total um molecules can be used to determine a time course of transport of IgM from the rough ER through the Golgi complex in WEHI 231 cells.",

A cDNA-encoding G protein containing the putative cytoplasmic domain of the IBV p23 glycoprotein (pG23) was constructed as described in Materials and Methods. The cDNA constructed encoded a hybrid protein consisting of the extracellular and transmembrane domains of G protein and a cytoplasmic domain consisting of three amil~o acid residues derived from G protein fused to the carboxyl-terrninal 128 amino acids of p23 which included its putative cytoplasmic domain. Double-label indirect immunofluorescence microscopy of COS-1 cells transfected with pG23 showed both cell surface and internal staining similar to that observed for wild type G protein (data not shown). We also measured the rate of acquisition of endo H-resistant oligosaccharides by G23 (Fig. 6 ) and the half-time was 25 min, almost as fast as G protein with its normal cytoplasmic domain.",

            "text": "The transport of membrane and secretory proteins to the cell surface is thought to occur along the same basic pathway from the ER, through the three to four compartments of the Golgi complex to the cell surface (51) . In principle, one can imagine that sorting of proteins within this pathway occurs in two ways. In the \"positive signal\" model, recognition of sorting signals by specific factors would result in direct movement of proteins to specific locations within the cell. In the \"negative signal\" model, all proteins would move (perhaps with phospholipids or cholesterol destined for various cellular membranes) unless they were delayed at specific sites after recognition by specific factors. It is well documented that different proteins move through the exocytic pathway at different rates (22, 56) , and this observation could be reconciled with either model for sorting. That is, proteins could have different affinities for the same transport factors resulting in different rates of transport, or they could have different affinities for resident components along the pathway, and thus move through the cell at different rates. Given the complexity of the transport process which presumably requires that some proteins segregate into transport vesicles while others do not, it seems likely that both positive and negative signals operate within the exocytic pathway. In a transmembrane protein, the sorting signals could reside in the cytoplasmic domain, the transmembrane domain, the extracytoplasmic domain or in some combination of these domains. In fact, mutations in any of these domains of VSV G protein can arrest transit from the rough ER or Golgi complex, whereas other changes in these domains have little or no effect on transport of G protein to the plasma membrane (2, 33, 47) . In an initial search for sorting signals in the VSV G protein, two considerations led us to analyze mutations affecting the cytoplasmic domain (47) . First, this domain is separated from the remainder of the protein by an a-helical segment of 20 amino acid residues that spans the membrane, and thus it seemed unlikely that changes in the cytoplasmic domain would affect the folding of the extracytoplasmic domain of the protein on the other side of the membrane. The second consideration was that the cytoplasmic domain is localized where it might be expected to interact with proteins or other factors involved in formation of transport vesicles or in subsequent fusion of these vesicles with various membrane compartments in the cell. The results of the earlier studies indicated that the structure of the cytoplasmic domain is important in signaling a normal rate of transport of G protein to the cell surface (47) . We undertook the experiments described here to extend these earlier studies and to ask specifically if cytoplasmic domains from other integral membrane proteins could substitute for the normal cytoplasmic domain of VSV G protein in transport to the plasma membrane.",

In fact, we show here (using a more sensitive reagent) that the 1473H1 protein was detected on the plasma membrane of ~20% of the cells expressing this protein. Also, we detected a small percentage of conversion of the oligosaccharides on the protein to a form resistant to cleavage by endo H, indicating some transfer of 1473H 1 from the rough ER through the Golgi complex. From these experiments we conclude that the two to three uncharged amino acids in the cytoplasmic domain of 1473H1 were sufficient for expression of G protein on the plasma membrane. Thus, none of the normal cytoplasmic domain was essential for transport of G protein to the cell surface. However, the rate of transport of this protein lacking the entire normal cytoplasmic domain was at least 30-fold lower than the rate of transport of the wild type G protein. This slow rate of transport of 1473H1 could account for the fact that only a small proportion of COS-1 cells expressing 1473H 1 had detectable levels of this protein on the cell surface at 40 h after transfection. That is, in the transient expression system used here, most of the cells may not have had sufficient time to transport and accumulate detectable levels of the mutant protein on the cell surface after initiation of protein synthesis.",

However the rate of acquisition ofendo H-resistant oligosaccharides by G* was sixfold slower than for the wild type G protein. A second mutant (G#) with the three amino acid cytoplasmic domain from the immunoglobulin u membrane heavy chain (Lys-Val-Lys) showed a rate of acquisition of endo H-resistant oligosaccharides and level of expression on the plasma membrane virtually identical to that of G*. The presence of the one basic amino acid residue in these short cytoplasmic domains could be responsible for promoting the fivefold increase in the rate of transport of the mutant proteins to the cell surface (as compared with 1473H1). In a recent report, rates of processing were determined for H-2L d with mutations in the cytoplasmic domain and, similar to our results, the presence of basic amino acid residues greatly enhanced expression of mutant H-2L d on the cell surface (66) . Also, these results are consistent with observations of Lehrman et al. in which a mutation in the low density lipoprotein receptor that leaves tFree of the 50 normal amino acid residues in the cytoplasmic domain generates a mutant protein that is transported to the plasma membrane but at a rate slower than the wild type protein (31) .",

The time course we observed also resembled the rate of acquisition of endo H-resistant oligosaccharides by #m in the human B lymphoblastoid cell line Daudi in which the pulse-labeled Um and m forms are more difficult to resolve on SDS-polyacrylamide gels (17) . A similar transit time has been suggested for 6m molecules in B 1-8& 1 cells (3). The Um molecules synthesized in these two cell lines and 6m molecules differ in their extracellular domains with respect to amino acid composition and extent of glycosylation yet their transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains are identical (6) . Thus, very different glycoproteins, Urn, ~,,, and G~,, which contain an identical cytoplasmic domain consisting of the three amino acids Lys-Val-Lys, are transported to the cell surface at very similar rates. These results would be consistent with a model ofintracellular glycoprotein transport in which important interactions occur on the cytoplasmic side of intracellular membranes. In the case of these three proteins we would suggest that the amino acid sequence in the cytoplasmic domain could be providing a significant, although perhaps weak, transport signal. In the case of wild type G protein, the complete cytoplasmic domain might provide for stronger interactions and result in its more rapid rate of transport.",

A reasonable interpretation of this result is that the structure of the cytoplasmic domain of HA is less important than that of G protein in signaling efficient transfer to the cell surface. That mutations in the cytoplasmic domain of HA have a much less profound effect on the rate of acquisition of endo H-resistant oligosaccharides by mutant HA molecules (15) than do mutations in the cytoplasmic domain of the VSV G protein (47) is consistent with this hypothesis. Thus, the HA protein may rely more heavily than G protein on extracytoplasmic signals to promote its rapid transport to the cell surface. Because the HA protein is known to be a trimer (63) while G protein may be a monomer (14) , an alternative explanation is that the extracellular and transmembrane domains of G protein are not structurally compatible with the HA cytoplasmic domain. For example, perhaps the cytoplasmic domain of HA is efficiently recognized in a trimeric configuration, and since such a conformation is unexpected in the hybrid protein, the rate of transport observed for GHA was reduced as compared with either parent molecule.",

This observation was interesting in view of the fact that coronaviruses encode two transmembrane glycoproteins, one that is transported to the surface of infected cells, and the other that remains localized in rough ER and Golgi membranes (l 6, 40). The location of p23 in these intracellular membranes is believed to direct budding of coronaviruses from infected cells. We conclude from our experiment that the cytoplasmic domain of p23 cannot halt G protein in intracellular membranes. Instead, it increases the rate of transport of G protein with three of its normal amino acids in the cytoplasmic domain, at least from the rough ER through the Golgi complex. Other domains of p23 may provide signals that halt transfer of p23 beyond the Golgi complex. Further experiments on expression of p23 itself and other G-p23 hybrid proteins are in progress and may allow identification of features of the p23 protein that are critical for targeting to intracellular membranes.",

This is in contrast to expression of chimeric cDNAs generated by recombination at restriction sites which can result in novel properties which resemble neither parent glycoprotein (37) . The experiments also illustrate the complexity involved in analysis of the sorting problem using recombinant DNA and gene expression technology. Although the simple methods we describe allow the precise replacement of small protein domains with the corresponding domains from other proteins, the results obtained with these proteins are not always con-sistent with simple models. However, considering that proteins potentially contain signals in more than one domain that function actively to promote transport, as well as signals that may retard transport at certain stages, it is possible to arrive at consistent models to explain the results without invoking effects of the cytoplasmic domain on the threedimensional structure of the extracytoplasmic domain of the protein as suggested by Doyle et al. (15) . Having precise constructs encoding hybrid glycoproteins correctly targeted to the plasma membrane of transfected cells, we can now begin to assess directly the biological roles of the cytoplasmic domain of G protein in targeting to specific plasma membrane domains in epithelial cells, in assembly of VSV virions, in lateral diffusion of G protein, and in immune recognition.",

Nucleotides in the G gene that encode the first four amino acids in the cytoplasmic domain of G protein were replaced with nucleotides that encode the three amino acid cytoplasmic domain of IgM or IgD membrane heavy chains and a termination codon. As deduced from sequences of DNA clones, the cytoplasmic domains Of#m and 6m are identical and consist of the amino acids Lys-Val-Lys (11, 25). As illustrated in Fig. 1A, an oligonucleotide (34mer) was hybridized to circular template DNA containing the G gene sequence (mp8-G4) and the primer was extended. This primer encodes the sequence Lys-Val-Lys followed by a translation termination codon, and is flanked by 11 nucleotides complementary to the G gene on each side. After transfection of this DNA into E. coli we obtained phage carrying the desired replacement of 12 nucleotides. The mutant gene was then subcloned from the double-strand replicative-form DNA into the SV40-based expression vector pJC119 (54). The plasmid was designated pGu.",

Also, extracts from 6 x 102 cells were subjected to immunoprecipitation with antiserum directed against light chains (lanes 2-4). Immunoprecipitates were reduced and alkylated before incubation in the presence (+) or absence (-) ofendo H. Proteins were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and a fluorograph of the dried gel is shown. The apparent molecular weight of ~,m and ~, synthesized by these cells is indicated. The electrophoretic mobility of urn and #s after removal of oligosaccharides by endo H is shown by large and small arrowheads, respectively. No IgM is secreted from these cells and #s is degraded intracellularly (39; our unpublished results). Molecular weight markers are the VSV proteins: L (240,000), G (65,000), N (50,000), and M (27,000).",

Immunoprecipitates of cells from each time point were incubated in the presence (+) or absence (-) of endo H and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Fluorograms of the dried gels are shown (A-C). The mobility of G proteins after removal of oligosaccharides by endo H is indicated for the wild type (arrow) and mutant (arrowheads) G proteins. The apparent molecular weights of mutant G proteins determined on SDS-polyacrylamide gels was consistent with the substitution of a 10 amino acid cytoplasmic domain (GHA)or a 130 amino acid cytoplasmic domain (G23) for the normal 29 amino acid cytoplasmic domain of wild type G protein. Preexposed x-ray films obtained from this and similar experiments were quantified by densitometry and the rate of acquisition of endo H-resistant oligosaccharides by each glycoprotein was calculated.
