A majority of viral diseases attack infants and young children, while others strike people in their prime. Development of preventive measures against viral diseases is, therefore, of paramount importance. Vaccination is the most cost-effective medical intervention for preventing mortality and morbidity against infectious diseases. A number of effective and safe vaccines are currently available against several viral diseases of significant medical importance. Many of these manufactured in India, are at par with international standards and are affordable. For many other viral diseases, for which vaccines are currently not available, research is underway at various national laboratories, as well as in the private sector companies in India. The present overview highlights the various vaccine preventable viral diseases that are of special importance to India and aims to provide a glimpse of the various vaccines that are currently available, or are under development in India.",

Vaccines not only provide benefits at the level of the individual, but also to society at large. These are powerful as they not only prevent the primary disease, but also its complications or sequelae. Of the many medically important viral diseases prevalent in India, vaccines for only two, namely polio and measles, find a place in the Universal Immunization Programme (UIP) implemented by the Government of India. The other diseases that find a place in the UIP are of bacterial origin, namely, diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus, and childhood tuberculosis. All these UIP vaccines are available free of cost. The UIP is one of the largest programs of its kind in the world, in terms of the number of vaccine doses used and the number of people reached.",

While for many viral diseases total eradication is impossible due to their zoonotic nature, but for diseases like polio and measles the story is different. These two childhood viral diseases can be totally eradicated since human beings are the only host. What is required is a concerted and sustained global effort, with active public participation and co-operation, as was the case when smallpox was eradicated from the planet Earth. 260 million [2] .

India has been able to contribute to allround development in the health sector since it has an excellent R&D infrastructure, both in the public as well as the private sectors. Since independence, it has established top-class research institutes, medical colleges and hospitals. It has excellent drug testing laboratories, bio-safety labs, clinical trial centers, clinical research organizations (CRO) and other world-class facilities. The major R&D facilities in the public sector include Indian Immunologicals Ltd., Bharat Immunologicals & Biologicals Corp. Ltd., Haffkine Bio-Pharmaceutical Corp. Ltd., and the Central Research Institute (Kasauli). Their counterparts in the private sector include Serum Institute of India Ltd., Bharat Biotech International Ltd., Shantha Biotech, and Panacea Biotec Ltd. A new vaccine production plant has been completed at Dholka (Gujarat) by CPL Biologicals (a joint venture between Cadila Pharmaceuticals Ltd. and Novavax Inc., USA). The plant will have the capacity to manufacture 60 million doses of seasonal and pandemic (H1N1) flu vaccines annually [4] . Pune-based Serum Institute of India makes one out of every two vaccines produced in the world. Interestingly, Serum Institute of India was the first Indian company to be approached by the World Health Organization (WHO) to develop and manufacture the pandemic influenza vaccine. The institute launched its intranasal H1N1 vaccine (NASOVAC TM ) in July 2010 [5] . Panacea Biotec (New Delhi) has been playing a major role in the polio eradication programme by supplying over 6 billion doses of oral polio vaccine (OPV) to the Government of India and UNICEF [6] . From the South, Shantha Biotech's Shanvac-B was the first Indian Hepatitis B vaccine to be pre-qualified by WHO for global distribution through the UN agencies. With Shantha's Hepatitis B vaccine priced at just one-tenth of the imported vaccine, along with five other Indian companies entering the market, India has the cheapest Hepatitis B vaccine in the world [7] . Moreover, with the recent efforts of the Government of India, the Central Research Institute (Kasauli), Pasteur Institute of India (Coonoor), and the BCG Vaccine Laboratory (Guindy) have been enabled to resume vaccine production [8] . Hence, this is indeed an exciting time for vaccine production in India.",

The importance accorded to this group of viral diseases stems from the fact that India has a significantly high density of mosquito population and a wide distribution of various mosquito species. Globally, more than 130 arboviruses are known to cause human diseases and some of these have a significant presence in India. Most arboviruses of public health importance belong to one of the three virus genuses: Flavivirus, Alphavirus, and Bunyavirus. In the Indian context, Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) and Dengue virus (DENV) are two important Flaviviruses, whereas Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is an important Alphavirus. Although the epidemiology of each of these diseases is unique, there is a certain degree of similarity that underlies all these diseases, particularly with reference to socioeconomic, ecological and environmental factors that substantially contribute to the emergence, spread and sustenance of these diseases in nature [9] .",

            "text": "Japanese Encephalitis Virus (JEV): Leading Cause of ''Brain Fever'' in Children JEV is a Flavivirus that is spread to humans and animals by Culicine mosquitoes. The virion particles are spherical (*45 nm diameter), enveloped and possess a singlestranded, positive-sense, non-segmented RNA genome of approximately 11 kb length. The genome codes for 10 viral proteins (VP); three structural (capsid, pre-membrane/ membrane, and envelope), and seven non-structural (NS1, NS2a, NS2b, NS3, NS4a, NS4b, NS5). The virus is responsible for causing Japanese encephalitis (JE), which is the most important form of viral encephalitis globally [10] . JE originated in Japan in the late 1800s, and has since spread over vast regions of South and South-East Asia, where approximately 3 billion people are at risk of contracting JE [11] . Needless to say that JE is a major public health problem in the region, accounting for *50,000 cases and *10,000 fatalities. This is a very conservative figure that may merely be indicating the proverbial tip-ofthe-iceberg. In India, JE was first reported in 1955 from Vellore (formerly North Arcot district), Tamil Nadu, with a total of *65 cases being reported between 1955 and 1966 from the area [12] . The first major outbreak occurred in 1973 in Burdwan and Bankura districts of West Bengal, with *700 cases and 300 deaths [13] . Over the years JE epidemics have been reported from most parts of India and it has become endemic in several districts. There are no comprehensive figures on JE disease burden in India but it constitutes a substantial proportion of the total global burden. JEV is maintained in nature by means of a zoonotic cycle involving Culicine mosquitoes (the vectors), pigs (the amplifying hosts) and ardeid birds (vertebrate reservoir). Humans act as the so called dead-end hosts, since infection with JEV usually does not produce sufficiently high titers of viremia for further propagation of the virus. JE, being a zoonosis, cannot be totally eradicated, but can be effectively kept in check by prophylactic vaccination of susceptible human populations. Vaccination becomes all the more important for controlling JE, since there is currently no effective treatment available, coupled with the fact that vector control measures are not totally effective. A mouse brain-derived, formalin-inactivated JE vaccine was produced by Central Research Institute (Kasauli) till about a couple of years ago. The vaccine was largely effective although there were concerns relating to its safety. Besides, the vaccine was produced in only limited quantities and prices were high. As the vaccine production facilities of the century-old Central Research Institute (Kasauli) did not comply with the internationally accepted cGMP guidelines, JE vaccine production was halted in 2008 [14] . However, there are a couple of JE vaccines that are in the advanced stages of development [15] . The front runners are IXI-ARO \u00d2 (IC51), a purified inactivated vaccine (PIV) developed by Intercell (Austria) [16] , and IMOJEV \u00d2 a chimeric vaccine by Sanofi Pasteur [17] employing the Yellow fever virus 17D (YFV17D) ChimeriVax Technology platform. These two vaccines have proven themselves to be exemplary throughout pre-clinical and clinical development, with reference to safety and efficacy, the two cardinal properties of a ''good'' vaccine. Intercell's Indian partner is Biological E, who will be manufacturing and marketing IXIARO \u00d2 in India.",

While this vaccine is safe, efficacious, and also cheap, it has not been taken up by the international community due to the PHK cell substrate used in its preparation. It will be interesting to see if the government adopts a change in its JE vaccination policy, once IXIARO \u00d2 becomes available in the Indian market. The most important factor that will affect the decision-making process will definitely be the cost, because the Intercell vaccine is likely to be much costlier than the Chinese vaccine. However, this is unlikely to be a hindrance for IXIARO \u00d2 's commercial viability as Intercell's primary target is the tourism market, since tourists from the West increasingly prefer to travel to exotic destinations that are inevitably JE endemic. Hence, efforts to develop safe and effective indigenous JE vaccines that are likely to be cheaper still continue. Our laboratory at the National Institute of Immunology has been engaged in this endeavor for the past several years. We have utilized conventional vaccine development strategies such as cell culture of virus followed by formalininactivation, as well as newer approaches involving recombinant DNA techniques. A PIV [18] has been developed using an Indian strain (P20778) of JEV grown in Vero cells, the technology for which has been transferred to Panacea Biotec for commercial development. A JEV DNA vaccine candidate has been evaluated in non-human primates with limited success [19] , while an adenovirus 5 (Ad5)-vectored JEV vaccine candidate has shown promising results in mice [20] . Due to the widespread presence of Ad5 neutralizing antibodies in the human population and the recent disappointing outcome of the Ad5 based HIV vaccine trial [21] efforts are on to use novel adenoviral vectors for engineering recombinant JE vaccine.",

These diseases are caused by four, related but antigenically distinct, DENVs (DENV 1-4).

DENV is transmitted primarily by Aedes aegypti, although Aedes albopictus has also been implicated. DENV is more dangerous than other arboviruses from a transmission-dynamics standpoint, because the viremia in humans is sufficiently high for further propagation of the virus. Hence, unlike JEV infections, humans do not act as dead-end-hosts in case of DENV infections, and a vertebrate reservoir/amplifying host is not required for maintenance of the virus in nature. For example, in an urban setting, DENV life-cycle can easily be maintained between humans and mosquitoes.",

As currently there is no specific antiviral treatment for DEN, management of complications is supportive, involving fluid replacement, in order to counteract the plasma leakage observed in Grade III/IV DHF and DSS [26] . Moreover, even implementation of supportive care is hindered by the absence of a low-cost rapid diagnostic test (RDT) having a sufficiently high specificity and sensitivity that can accurately predict disease severity [27] . DEN can be prevented by vaccination of susceptible human populations, and efforts in this direction have been on globally for over three decades, albeit without much success. The Indian effort to develop a dengue vaccine by the International Center for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology (ICGEB) has utilized an adenovirus-vectored approach to develop a tetravalent DENV vaccine candidate. Here, the genes encoding the domain III of the envelope (E) protein (EDIII) of the respective DENV strains have been stitched together to create the tetravalent gene (EDIII-T) cassette that was inserted into a replicationdefective Ad5 vector. This vaccine candidate was evaluated in mice, where cell-mediated immune responses as well as virus-neutralizing antibodies were generated [28] . Again, this vaccine construct suffers from the limitations of Ad5 vectors described above. Efforts are currently ongoing at ICGEB to produce EDIII-T in Pichia expression system.",

RotaTeq \u00d2 is a pentavalent live oral vaccine made from human-bovine reassortant RV containing G1, G2, G3, G4 and P1A [8] . Rotarix \u00d2 is a monovalent live oral vaccine made from human RV strain G1P [8] . However, these vaccines are expensive in the Indian context and feasibility of incorporating these in the Indian childhood immunization program would very much depend on their cost-effective availability [49, 50] . Efforts are also on to develop cheaper indigenous RV vaccines. One RV vaccine candidate, based on the strain 116E, having the genotype G9,P [11] , originally isolated from a neonate at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), New Delhi, has recently completed a dose-escalation randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in infants in New Delhi. The study indicated that the vaccine candidate elicits a robust immune response following three doses [51] . Phase III clinical trials of this vaccine candidate are currently in progress. If this indigenous vaccine candidate is successful, it will be an effective yet cheaper alternative to the already licensed RV vaccines. Another candidate, based on the UK human-bovine reassortant developed at the National Institutes of Health (NIH), Bethesda, USA [52, 53] has been licensed out to the Serum Institute of India (Pune) and Shantha Biotech (Hyderabad) for further development.",

            "text": "Rabies is one of the oldest zoonotic viral diseases to have plagued India since Vedic times, spanning well over 3,000 years. Although the rabies virus (RABV) is borne by a large number of terrestrial as well as flying mammals, dogs have been and still are the major reservoirs of the virus in India [54] . An estimated 55,000 deaths occur annually due to rabies, of which 20,000 are from India, accounting for approximately 36% of all global deaths. The annual incidence of rabies in India is 2 per 100,000 population [55] . Two distinct clinical syndromes are recognized in humans-furious (encephalitic) and paralytic. The furious form is characterized by fever, distal paresthesias, fasciculation, altered sensorium, pleocytosis in the cerebrospinal fluid, accompanied by rapid progression of symptoms, and is comparatively easier to diagnose. The paralytic form poses more difficulty in diagnosis, as it exhibits similar symptoms to Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, and in the absence of a history of dog bite, the clinical picture is similar to a psychiatric syndrome [56] . The incubation period for RABV, unlike other viral infections, can be quite long, ranging from \\1 week to [1 year, but typically 1-3 months. However, it should be noted that once symptoms of the disease develop, rabies is fatal to both animals and humans. Moreover, since no specific test for RABV is currently available, in the absence of the classical rabiesspecific signs, such as hydrophobia or aerophobia, clinical diagnosis is very difficult [55] .",

            "text": "Rabies can be very effectively prevented through vaccination. The vaccine can be given pre-exposure, as well as post-exposure. Pre-exposure prophylaxis is recommended for anyone who is at increased risk of exposure to RABV such as laboratory workers, while post-exposure prophylaxis is recommended for affected individuals. There are essentially two types of vaccines for human use, the nerve tissue vaccine (NTV) and the cell culture vaccines (CCV). The NTV is produced by growing RABV in sheep brain, and in India, it is called Semple vaccine, after the British Director of the Central Research Institute (Kasauli) who developed the technique at the turn of the last century. The Semple vaccine requires a large number of painful intramuscular (i.m.) injections. Moreover, since it contains myelin protein, there is a possibility of occurrence of allergic encephalomyelitis (AEM) in certain vaccine recipients. The WHO has recommended that the NTV be replaced with the more efficacious and safer CCV [58] . Following a Supreme Court order in 2005, the production of the Semple vaccine has been banned, and is gradually being phased out from the Indian health system. Two WHO approved CCVs have been available in India for over two decades. These include a purified chick embryo cell (PCEC) vaccine (Rabipur \u00d2 ) produced by Chiron Vaccines (India) and marketed by Sanofi Aventis (India). The other is a purified Vero cell rabies vaccine (PVRV), manufactured by Sanofi Pasteur (France), and marketed by Ranbaxy (India) under the brand name Verorab \u00d2 . Considering the high price of these vaccines, rabies CCVs have been developed indigenously. Indirab TM , a Vero cell-based rabies vaccine manufactured by Bharat Biotech International Ltd., (Hyderabad) has been found to be safe and immunogenic in humans [59] . Abhayrab TM is another PVRV available from Indian Immunologicals Ltd. (Hyderabad). Rabies vaccines have also been prepared using human diploid cells, the international standard being the Merieux inactivated rabies vaccine (MIRV), manufactured by Sanofi Pasteur (Lyon, France). In 1999, Serum Institute of India (Pune) indigenously developed an adsorbed human diploid cell rabies vaccine (Rabivax \u00d2 ) using the Pitman-Moore RABV strain grown on human diploid cells, followed by inactivation with BPL. This vaccine was found to be immunogenic and safe for rabies prophylaxis in humans [60] . A purified duck embryo vaccine (PDEV) against rabies, is manufactured by Berna Biotech (Switzerland) and available internationally as Lyssavac N for over two decades. Following technology transfer, the same vaccine is manufactured in India by Zydus Cadila Health Care Ltd. (Ahmedabad), and marketed as Vaxirab \u00d2 . An open label, randomized phase IV comparative clinical trial indicated that Vaxirab \u00d2 was as safe, tolerable and immunogenic as Rabipur \u00d2 and Verorab \u00d2 the two WHO approved vaccines, and could be used as an alternative vaccine for post-exposure prophylaxis of rabies [61] . A multicentric study has also indicated the safety and efficacy of this indigenously manufactured PDEV for post-exposure prophylaxis [62] . For the purpose of immunotherapy, anti-RABV immunoglobulins raised in horses are also available in the Indian market. For example, AbhayRIG is available from Indian Immunologicals Ltd.",

Of the 150 or so types of HPV that have been identified, at least 30 types infect the genital mucosa in humans, and hence, are sexually transmitted. These HPV types are categorized as low-and high-risk types. The former are responsible for genital warts, as well as recurrent respiratory papillomatosis (RRP), while the latter are responsible for cervical cancer. The most common low-risk HPV types that cause up to 90% of all genital warts are HPV-6 and HPV-11 [74] , while the most common high-risk HPV types that account for *70% of cervical cancers are HPV-16 and HPV-18 [75] . HPV infections are one of the most common STIs amongst women. Approximately 80% of sexually active women and men become infected with HPV at some point in their lives [76] . Most infections are transient, and are usually cleared by the immune response, and usually do not present any clinical symptoms [77] . However, persistent infection can lead to cervical cancer. In India, there are an estimated 132,000 new cases of cervical cancer and 74,000 deaths annually [78] .",

Accessibility to these life-saving vaccines has been hindered by their exorbitant cost, being the most expensive vaccines produced so far [80] . The retail price in India for the complete schedule of Gardasil \u00d2 is Rs. 6,900 and that for Cervarix \u00d2 is Rs. 7,800, which clearly indicates that this vaccine is still essentially out-of-reach of the general Indian public.

However, within a decade, companies from developing countries like India developed and introduced the vaccine at USD 3 per dose, which due to the ensuing competition, came down to less than 30 cents per dose by 2001 [81] . This same approach should be feasible for the HPV vaccine. Four leading Indian companies, namely Shantha Biotech, Serum Institute of India, Bharat Biotech and Indian Immunologicals are currently developing HPV vaccines that could be much cheaper than the current vaccines [82] . Shantha has even indicated that its vaccine could be initially priced at just USD 15 [83] . Besides these companies, two others, namely, Virchow Biotech and Gennova Biopharmaceuticals are also developing HPV vaccines with support from the Department of Biotechnology (DBT), Government of India, under the Biotechnology Industry Partnership Programme (BIPP) [84] . All these efforts are still in their infancy and it's going to be some time before an Indian HPV vaccine becomes available.",

A characteristic clinical feature of measles is the appearance of rash, which is erythematous and maculopapular in nature, and begins in the head, then spreads to the trunk and finally to the limbs over a span of 3-4 days. Two to 3 days before the onset of the rash, Koplik's spots, the pathognomonic enanthem of measles, appear in the mucosa of the buccal cavity. This disease is highly contagious and spreads by droplet transmission. The most common complications of measles are otitis media, pneumonia, diarrhea and convulsions. More rare complications include encephalitis and sub-acute sclerosing pan-encephalitis (SSPE) [85] .",

India is the only country in the world not to have introduced a second dose of measles vaccine in spite of documented evidence of the efficacy of two doses of the vaccine in reducing measles related mortality [87] . Moreover, India has not followed the recommendations made by the WHO Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE) on immunization in November 2008 for administering two doses of the measles vaccine [88] .

Due to the severity of complications arising from measles in adults; recent outbreaks of mumps including in India [94] ; as well as rubella seropositivity in infants suspected to be infected in utero [95] , as well as in pregnant women [96] , it has been recommended by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) that all adults born after 1957 should receive at least two doses of MMR vaccine, unless otherwise contraindicated [97] . Efforts should be directed at vaccinating susceptible adolescents and adults, especially against rubella, particularly women of child bearing age since the virus can cause congenital defects if contracted during pregnancy.",

Influenza viruses are classified into three genera, namely, A, B and C, of which the first two are known to cause human disease.

Influenza A and B viruses possess eight different RNA segments that code for 10 and 11 different proteins respectively.

Although there is no defined seasonal pattern, it has been generally observed that in northern India cases occur during winter, while in the south cases occur during the monsoon season. Viral ARI in India is caused primarily by influenza A and B viruses, parainfluenza virus and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) [102, 103] . The burden of seasonal influenza in India appears to be low [104] , although further cross-sectional studies as well as active surveillance are required. However, influenza does account for a large number of absentees at schools, colleges and offices annually. We believe that currently there are no sufficient reasons to initiate vaccination against seasonal influenza in India and the seasonal influenza should be prevented by implementation of simple public health interventions such as hand washing with soap and inculcating habits for improving general respiratory hygiene. However, surveillance systems should be in place so that vaccination options may be kept open for special cases, such as mass human congregations that occur during religious occasions like the Maha-Kumbh Mela, Ganga Sagar Mela and the Muslim pilgrimage of Hajj [105] .",

Moreover, the genes of INFV from different species can recombine and undergo reassortment, giving rise to INFV with pandemic potential, such as the influenza A (H1N1) virus that caused the 2009 influenza (swine flu) pandemic [106] . The virus can also ''jump'' the species barrier, as occurred during the avian influenza outbreaks, when a bird-specific influenza A (H5N1) virus infected humans. This bird flu virus originated in China, but rapidly spread across three continents-Asia, Africa and Europe, causing outbreaks in over 30 countries, including India [107] . Threats like bird flu are very real and can only be checked by implementing a surveillance system that can closely monitor viruses circulating in birds, especially those that have a direct bearing on humans, such as poultry. There is really no justification for developing a bird flu vaccine due to its limited human-to-human transmission potential. Moreover, human cases can be treated with antivirals such as Oseltamivir and Amantadine, while outbreaks in poultry can be controlled by effective culling activities. However, for pandemic influenza A (H1N1) virus, a vaccine is essential. Currently, India has its own swine flu vaccine manufactured by the Serum Institute of India (Pune). This is a live-attenuated vaccine (NASO-VAC TM ) that uses the California isolate (A/17/California/ 2009/38) of human H1N1, which is propagated in specific pathogen free (SPF) embryonated hen eggs, followed by lyophilization, and is formulated for intranasal administration. Serum Institute of India is also developing other immunogens and monoclonal antibodies against pandemic H1N1 with funding from DBT under BIPP [84] . Moreover, Panacea Biotec is also developing a H1N1 pandemic influenza vaccine with funding from the same source. Bharat Biotech also has a pandemic influenza vaccine in its product pipeline [108] . We are of the opinion that the pandemic H1N1 influenza (swine flu) vaccine should be reserved for individuals at high-risk of contracting infection, and for the management of outbreak situations.",

In fact, Egyptian stone carvings suggest that polio could have existed since pre-biblical times; as far back as 1580 B.C. Polio is an acute illness that follows invasion through the gastro-intestinal (GI) tract by one of the three serotypes of polio virus. Polio viruses are enteroviruses that belong to the Family Picornaviridae, since they are very small (pico) and possess an RNA genome. As indicated above, wild polio viruses (WPV) are of three types-WPV1, WPV2 and WPV3 [109] . The virus replicates in the gut, and then invades the bloodstream. It has a high degree of tropism for nervous tissue, and once the peripheral nerves become infected, the virus reaches the central nervous system (CNS) by retrograde axonal transport. Infection might be clinically asymptomatic, but when symptoms appear, they may range from fever to aseptic meningitis or paralysis. Infection is spread by feco-oral route, as well as from pharyngeal secretions from infected individuals. Over-crowding and poor sanitation facilitate the rapid spread of polio, a major reason for this disease being endemic in developing countries.",

The IPV was developed by Jonas Salk in 1955, while the live-attenuated OPV was developed by Albert Sabin in 1961. Vaccination efforts have essentially eradicated the disease from the western hemisphere. The Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) a public-private partnership (established in 1988) led by *200 national governments and spearheaded by the WHO, CDC, UNICEF and Rotary International is the driving force behind all efforts directed at global polio eradication. Largely due to this huge global effort, polio is on the verge of eradication. Currently, four countries (Afghanistan, India, Nigeria, Pakistan) are polio endemic, while four others (all in Africa) are having re-established polio transmission. There are 13 other countries that have reported imported poliovirus cases [110] . Due to sustained vaccination efforts, WPV2 has been eradicated from the wild, the last case being detected in India in 1999. In this final stage of the eradication process, the goal is to wipe out the remaining WPV1 and 3. Both these types circulate in endemic areas and are highly infectious, and both cause paralysis. While WPV1 is more widespread, WPV3 is more localized in northern India, northern Nigeria, Pakistan and Afghanistan. In order to tackle this problem, a bivalent OPV (bOPV) has been developed. A randomized, doubleblind, controlled trial indicated the superiority of bOPV compared to trivalent OPV (tOPV), and non-inferiority compared with monovalent OPV1 (mOPV1) and monovalent OPV3 (mOPV3) [111] . The bOPV was first introduced in Afghanistan in December 2009, when 2.8 million children \\5 years old received the vaccine. This vaccine was introduced in India in January 2010, following which polio cases decreased dramatically. As of April 20, 2011, the historically polio-prone State of Uttar Pradesh has not reported a single case of polio for over a year, the last case being reported on April 21, 2010, from Ferozabad. Only a single paralytic-polio case has been reported so far this year (WPV1 infection, reported on January 13, 2011) from Howrah district in West Bengal. This has set the West Bengal outbreak response team into action, which has initiated Sub-National Immunization Days (SNID) since April 24, 2011, in an effort to check any further polio cases. In fact, India is currently faring better than some other countries, for example, the Democratic Republic of Congo (36 cases; all WPV1), Pakistan (28 cases; all WPV1), and Chad (20 cases; 18 WPV1; 2 WPV3), which have reported comparatively much higher number of polio cases so far this year [112] .",

In fact, recent modeling studies indicate that if a HIV/AIDS vaccine (possessing 70% efficacy) could be developed by 2015, and administered to 40% of the population, it would reduce the annual number of new infections by 81% by 2030 [119] . However, with over three decades of sustained global efforts, it is now widely accepted that developing a HIV/AIDS vaccine is one of the most difficult challenges confronting bio-medical scientists today. But the quest goes on.",

With the burgeoning population, zoonotic nich\u00e9 that were previously undisturbed are increasingly being encroached by humans. As a consequence, many viral diseases that were previously unheard-of are emerging, while those that were quiescent for decades are re-emerging. Vaccines could confer protection against many of these emerging viral diseases. However, there are several key programmatic areas that need to be looked into and properly addressed, in order to ensure that vaccines become a reality. One of the areas that require attention is improving the understanding of disease burden through surveillance. Establishment of an integrated surveillance system across Asia, with various stakeholder countries contributing to its sustenance is the need of the hour. This will help in detecting diseases like Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) before they cause large outbreaks. India was lucky last time, with only one imported case of SARS. Next time, luck might not be on India's side, since improvements in aviation can now send infected people to any part of the globe within 24 h. For surveillance to be sustainable, financial support needs to be garnered for the economically weaker countries. Moreover, dedicated advocacy is a must, in order to keep the topic of vaccine preventable viral diseases on the national, regional and international agendas.",

            "text": "However, we should simultaneously ask the question: A vaccine for every viral disease-is it practicable? We should do justice by trying to find a proper answer. Vaccines for all viral diseases are not feasible in a vast and diverse country like India. Disease burden is not clear for many viral diseases. Hence the need for disease burden studies. Resources should be properly utilized so that indigenous vaccine development efforts focus on viral diseases with a proven and established burden of disease. Many viruses mutate so rapidly that strain replacement occurs every year e.g. seasonal influenza. Here, India cannot afford to mimic the West by trying to introduce a seasonal influenza vaccine. Not only would this be financially impractical, but also a logistical nightmare. For viruses like HIV, for which vaccines are not available, and probably will not be for quite some time, efforts need to be focused in bringing about behavioral changes as an adjunct to therapeutic interventions. For diseases like Hepatitis B, for which cheap and effective vaccines are already available, the programmatic deadlock should be broken so that every newborn gets the vaccine. Other types of hepatitis, like Hepatitis A and E should be managed by implementation of simple public health measures such as handwashing and improvements in sanitation. There is now renewed hope of treating Hepatitis C with a new potent oral HCV-protease inhibitor (Boceprevir). Moreover, there is a need for health education activities so that parents can make informed choices about vaccines for their children, some of which are not mandatory (Varicella vaccine), while others are highly expensive (HPV vaccine). Lastly, unfinished programmes like Polio eradication should be completed as soon as possible, and at the same time, the second dose measles vaccination initiative should be kickstarted, so that it picks up momentum, in time to achieve the targets set in the Millennium Development Goals by 2015.",
