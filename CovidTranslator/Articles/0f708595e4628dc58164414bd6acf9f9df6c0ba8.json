If viruses play a role in sickle cell disease children presenting with acute chest syndrome, [5] they are less frequently observed in adults. The overall vaccination coverage in our cohort was higher than that of other targeted French populations (elderly people, immunocompromised patients, or respiratory insufficiency) [16] [17] [18] .

This should be considered in future prospective studies.",
