Interleukin 6 was detected in the aqueous humor of 18/21 (85.7%) and 3/6 (50%) of the cats with and without serologic evidence of exposure to one to the infectious diseases, respectively. Statistically significant increases in mean IL-6 activity in aqueous humor were found for cats with any evidence of infection with T. gondii, for cats with T. gondii antigen in aqueous humor and for cats with coronavirus antibody titers 2 1:lOO. Aqueous humor IL-6 activity was greater than corresponding serum IL-6 activity in 21/27 cats.",

There are no pathognomonic ophthalmic signs for these diseases. Histopathologic examination of ocular tissues documents fungal elements, T. gondii, and the characteristic vasculitis induced by FIP in some cases of feline uveitis; lymphocytes and plasma cells infiltrating the iris and ciliary body, without an obvious etiology, is detected most commonly (Davidson et al., 1990; Peiffer and Wilcock, 1991) .

Interleukin 6 was measured at the highest dilution causing proliferation of 7TDl cells and quantitated by comparison with a standard curve generated using human recombinant IL-6 (Boehringer-Mannhein Biochemicals, Indianapolis, IN). The assay was sensitive to 1.0 units mll I IL-6. Results were expressed as the average IL-6 activity for triplicate wells for a given dilution. Human recombinant IL-6 was added to media and three serum samples from SPF cats to give a concentration of 50 units ml -' and the samples assayed for IL-6 as described. IL-6 activities were greater in each serum sample than the media control showing that feline sera does not inhibit the IL-6 assay described herein.",

Toxoplasma gondii IgM has never been documented in aqueous humor of healthy cats with experimentally-induced toxoplasmosis (Chavkin et al., 1994) but is the most common antibody produced in aqueous humor of cats with naturally-occurring uveitis (Lappin et al., 1992bl . Interleukin 6 has been shown to be a potent cofactor with IL1 in the stimulation of IgM synthesis (Kunimoto et al., 1989) . It is possible that in some cats with uveitis, IL-6 potentiates the production of T. gondii IgM in aqueous humor. The finding of high IL-6 activity in aqueous humor only during uveitis may partially explain the detection of 7'. gondii IgM only in aqueous humor of cats with uveitis. Interleukin 6 reverses interferon-gamma mediated activation of murine macrophages and promotes replication of T. gondii (Beaman et al., 1994) which may explain our finding of T. gondii antigens in the aqueous humor of cats with the highest IL-6 activity.",

TG: Toxoplasma gondii: IL-6: interleukin 6; ND: not detectable. T. gondii IgM and IgG titers determined by ELISA and reported as reciprocal titers. T. gondii IgM and IgG C-values determined by calculating the Goldman-Witmer coefficient. C-values > 1 are consistent with local antibody production in the aqueous humor. T. gondii antigen levels determined by ELISA. FIV: feline immunodeficiency virus. Results determined by an ELBA for the detection of IgG antibodies against FIV in serum. FeLV: feline leukemia virus.
