Severe outbreaks of PEDV variants have re-emerged in Asia and North America since 2010, causing tremendous economic losses to the swine industry. The lack of effective therapeutic treatment promotes the research for new antivirals. Lithium chloride (LiCl) has been reported as a potential antiviral drug for certain viruses. In this study, the antiviral effect of LiCl on PEDV in Vero cells was evaluated. Real-time quantitative PCR and indirect immunofluorescence assay indicated that LiCl effectively inhibited the entry and replication of PEDV in Vero cells. The expression of viral RNA and protein of PEDV in Vero cells was suppressed in a dose-dependent manner by LiCl. Moreover, addition of LiCl inhibited both early and late cell apoptosis induced by PEDV. Our data implied that LiCl could be a potential antiviral drug against PEDV infection. Further studies are required to explore the antiviral effect of lithium chloride on PEDV infection in vivo.",

PEDV is an enveloped virus with a single-stranded positive sense RNA genome of approximately 28 kb in size, and it possesses four structural proteins: the glycosylated spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M) proteins and the unglycosylated nucleocapid (N) protein (Jung and Saif, 2015) . PEDV has circulated throughout Europe and Asia during the past four decades, and has caused devastating impacts on world pig-rearing industry (Collin et al., 2015) . Currently, vaccination is the primary measure for prevention of PEDV. However, genetic variants have been identifying in Asia, Europe and North America since 2010 (Hanke et al., 2015; Horie et al., 2016; Huang et al., 2013; Lee and Lee, 2014; Li et al., 2012; Sung et al., 2015; Trujillo-Ortega et al., 2016; Vui et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2013; ) , which makes current traditional inactivated and attenuated PEDV vaccines are less effective against circulating PEDV variants (Choi et al., 2009; Lee, 2015) . The lack of effective therapeutic treatment underlines the importance of research for new antivirals.",

Antiviral effects of LiCl have been extensively investigated. LiCl can inhibit the infection of some DNA and RNA viruses, such as herpes simplex virus (Skinner et al., 1980) , canine parvovirus (Zhou et al., 2015) , porcine parvovirus (Chen et al., 2015) , pseudorabies herpesvirus (Sui et al., 2010) , porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (Hao et al., 2015) , feline calicivirus (Wu et al., 2015) , infectious bronchitis virus, an avian coronavirus (Li et al., 2009) and transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), a porcine coronavirus (Ren et al., 2011) . Both PEDV and TGEV are classified into group I of the genus Alphacoroavirus. However, it remains unknown whether LiCl has inhibitory effects on PEDV infection. In this study, we demonstrated the inhibitory effect of LiCl on PEDV infection. Moreover, the effect of LiCl on the cell apoptosis induced by PEDV was investigated.

            "text": "Previous studies have shown that LiCl can inhibit the infection of coronaviruses (Li et al., 2009; Ren et al., 2011) . However, it remains unknown whether LiCl has inhibitory effects on PEDV, a porcine coronavirus. In this study, we demonstrated the inhibitory effect of LiCl on PEDV infection. LiCl inhibits PEDV infection of Vero cells. After LiCl treatment, both viral RNA and viral protein levels decreased. When effects of LiCl on the stages of PEDV life cycles were evaluated, the realtime PCR, IFA and Viral titration results showed that LiCl significantly inhibited the entry and replication of PEDV in Vero cells in a dosedependent manner. However LiCl had no effect on attachment of PEDV to Vero cells at every concentration tested, indicating that it did not directly affect the attachment of the virus to the cell receptor. Apoptosis is considered to be a host innate defense mechanism that eliminates virus-infected cells. However, some viruses possess the ability to actively induce apoptosis to facilitate the release and dissemination of viral progeny to neighboring cells for further invasion, which are important biological parts in viral pathogenesis and disease processes that promote cell death and tissue injury (DeDiego et al., 2011; Favreau et al., 2012; Lan et al., 2013) . PEDV induced caspaseindependent apoptosis through activation of mitochondrial apoptosisinducing factor has been demonstrated (Kim and Lee, 2014) . In this study, we re-confirmed that PEDV infection induced the appearance of apoptotic cells as shown by IFA, and most apoptotic cells were at a stage of late apoptosis at 48 h post-infection. LiCl had a potent inhibitory effect on PEDV-induced early and late cell apoptosis. This is in accordance with the results from TGEV, another porcine coronavirus (Ren et al., 2011) . Regarding the action mechanisms of LiCl on cell infection by PEDV, our data implies that LiCl may inhibit PEDV infection via exerting an anti-apoptotic effect, since a caspase-independent mitochondrial apoptosis-mediated pathway plays a central role in PEDVinduced apoptosis to facilitate viral replication. This is conflict with the results of the expression of caspase-3 was inhibited by LiCl in TGEVinfected cells. Apoptosis-associated caspase activation of TGEV and SARS-CoV has been reported. Maybe LiCl can act on multiple factors in the apoptosis pathway or PEDV induces apoptosis through different pathway. However the exact action mechanism of LiCl on PEDV-induced apoptosis needs to be defined.",

The antiviral effect of LiCl was at the phase of PEDV entry and replication in Vero cells. These results indicate that LiCl has potential as an effective anti-PEDV drug. Further research will be required to explore whether LiCl has an antiviral effect and the mechanism of the antiviral effect of LiCl on PEDV infection in vivo.",
