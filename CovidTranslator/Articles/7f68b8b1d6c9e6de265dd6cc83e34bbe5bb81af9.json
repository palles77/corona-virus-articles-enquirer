Using a miniaturized corona ionizer and two pairs of separator electrodes, airborne bacteria were ionized and removed from the airflow. Two microorganism-ionizing respirator designs were experimentally evaluated with flow rates ranging from \u223c10 to 20 L/min and yielded airborne bacterial removal efficiencies of \u223c75%-100%. Further, they were in close agreement with the analytical airborne particle removal efficiencies, at a similar range of flow rates. These flow rates also correspond to the breathing rates of standing and walking adults. More importantly, the breathing resistance could be reduced by more than 50% for flow rates of \u223c200 L/min. Using manganese (IV) oxide coated mesh, the ozone concentration in the air outflow was reduced to less than 0.1 ppm, at a flow rate of \u223c20 L/min, thus enabling safe use. The power consumption was less than 1 W.",

Exactly 100 years ago, the 1918 flu pandemic took its toll with at least 50 million dead and 500 million infected [1] . Recent airborne pathogenic viral outbreaks such as severe acute respiratory syndrome in 2003 and middle east respiratory syndrome in 2015, managed to spread across tens of countries causing multiple deaths [2] [3] [4] [5] . In addition to viruses, there arehighly contagious airborne bacteria that can be transmitted person-to-person, causing diseases such as whooping cough (Bordetella pertussis), diphtheria (Corynebacterium diphtheriae), and tuberculosis (Mycobacterium tuberculosis) [6] [7] [8] . In the 1990 s, there were over 20 million cases of whooping cough worldwide, resulting in over 200,000 deaths [9] . In 2009, worldwide deaths due to tuberculosis were estimated at \u223c150,000 [10] ; in 2013 alone, there were almost half a million tuberculosis cases [11] . Airborne transmission between humans occurs via respiratory droplets, with sizes ranging from 0.58 to \u223c5 \u03bcm [12, 13] .",

Existing N95-based respirators employ woven fibers for mechanical filtration via inertia impaction, interception and diffusion to remove airborne particles and microorganisms from the air stream [16, 17] .",

            "text": "Unfortunately, the use of mechanical filtration is also accompanied by an increase in breathing resistance. Breathing resistance could increase by more than 100%, with a \u223c40% reduction in air exchange volume [18] . Further, with the gradual loading of particles on the mechanical filter, the pressure drop could also increase, by as much as a factor of 10 [19] . Therefore, associated discomfort and impaired breathing are not uncommon [20] . When used long-term, these problems can result in either the wearer loosening the respirator, causing improper fitting, or a complete avoidance. Mechanical filtration can also be augmented electrostatically (electret filtration) so that the fibers are electrically pre-charged. But it is equally susceptible to particle loading and the fibers lose their electrical charge over time. Although powered air-purifying respirators can circumvent the breathing resistance caused by mechanical and electret filters by using a large motorized air blower, they are exceedingly bulky and noisy. At this juncture, it is important to highlight the fact that non-usage of a respirator (due to discomfort) could result in increased patient-to-patient transmission in a crowded environment, such as an emergency room [21] .",

This would be intended as a low breathing resistance alternative to existing mechanical filtration based personal respirators. Electrostatic precipitators are well known for their use in removing airborne particles, with efficiencies exceeding 90% [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] . Even in their miniaturized form, they have been shown to effectively capture airborne particles and microorganisms [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] . In particular, a miniaturized corona ionizer with pin cathode and liquid anode was used as a bio-precipitator to charge, capture, and lyse airborne bacteria prior to detection [33] . However the use of liquid anode only allows it to operate for a short duration (\u223c1 min). In this work, MIRI employs a miniaturized corona ionizer with pin cathode and metallic anode to electrically charge the incoming airborne microorganisms, which are then captured downstream by a pair of separator electrodes. In addition, it uses manganese (IV) oxide coated mesh to remove excess ozone generated by the miniaturized corona ionizer. Since the airflow would be relatively unimpeded, compared to using mechanical filtration, the differential pressure (hence breathing resistance) would also be reduced.",

First, we will present the design and principle of operation. This is followed by an estimation of analytical airborne particle removal efficiency. Experimental measurements of the corona current versus applied voltage were performed for the miniaturized corona ionizer. The differential pressure across MIRI-1 was experimentally measured and compared with a commercial N95 respirator (Model 9322 K, 3 M, Paul, MN, USA), and a control (unobstructed flow). The ozone removal efficiency of the manganese (IV) oxide coated mesh (subsequently referred to as MnO mesh), was also experimentally characterized and compared against US-EPA's safety standard for ozone inhalation. Finally, the airborne bacterial removal efficiency was demonstrated for varying airflow rates. This was performed by using plate counting to monitor the amount of airborne bacteria removed by MIRI-1 and MIRI-2.",

During the experiment, a variable DC power supply (Model HY3005F-3, Mastech, China) powered both the air inlet fan and the high voltage DC-DC converter of MIRI-1. The air inlet fan was operated from 3 to 9 V, with 1 V increments. This corresponded to air flow rates from 12 to 27.6 L/min, as measured by an anemometer (Model GM8903, Benetech, China). Note that these flow rates also corresponded to the breathing rate of an adult male standing and walking (2.5 mph) [39, 40] . The air entered MIRI-1 via the air inlet, and ozone was produced as a by-product of the corona ionizer. As mentioned earlier, the ozone in the air flow was reduced as it flowed past the MnO mesh in the ozone removal stage. MnO mesh designs A and B were used in the experiment. Prior to exiting the air outlet, the ozone sensor measured the ozone concentration in the air flow. The data sampling rate was two readings/sec. At the beginning of the experiment (at a particular flow rate), a 1 min average measurement was used as the baseline ozone concentration. Then the ozone concentration was allowed to increase for 45 min, until it reached a steady state. The average steady-state ozone concentration was obtained over the next 10 min. The final ozone concentration was deduced by subtracting the baseline ozone concentration from the steady-state ozone concentration. The experiment was performed at \u223c25 \u2103 and RH of < 30% (monitored by Model RHTemp101A humidity and temperature data logger, MadgeTech, Warner, NH, USA). Note that a similar experimental setup was also used to characterize MIRI-2. In this case, MnO mesh design C was used.",

For an adult standing or sitting (breathing rate of \u223c10 L/min or less) [39, 40] , MIRI-1 and MIRI-2 could operate with \u223c85% and 100% airborne bacterial removal efficiency, respectively.

Note that the differential pressure measurements were performed at flow rates much higher (\u223c200 L/min) than its intended flow rate range (\u223c20 L/min). Therefore, the difference in breathing resistance at the intended flow rate range may be lower. Nonetheless, a fractional reduction in breathing resistance would still be useful and desirable. For example, it could be useful for a healthcare worker during an airborne pathogenic outbreak, such as tuberculosis. The healthcare worker would constantly be exposed to the pathogen while working with patients for an extended duration. Another example would be an elderly patient, with a compromised breathing capacity, waiting in a crowded emergency room while exposed to potential airborne pathogens. In both scenarios, a reduction in breathing resistance, with the accompanied portability, would be highly desirable.",

Extended operation in a high humidity environment may accelerate the corrosion. This means that periodic replacement would be necessary. Furthermore, the separator electrodes would also need to be cleaned or replaced periodically. Another limitation of this approach relates to the possible reentrainment of MnO powder from the mesh, and hence into the air flow. This could be circumvented by using a more durable coating, or by forming techniques such as the hydrothermal method [42] . In addition, this feasibility study was only performed on bacteria. Though it is reasonable (and tempting) to extend the usage to other airborne microorganisms, such as viruses and spores, it would be necessary to repeat the experiment with other airborne microorganisms in the future. In the case of person-to-person airborne transmission of viruses, it is concievable that they are also transmitted via larger respiratory droplets. Finally, there is an absence of on-board bacterial detection mechanism although it may be possible to analyze the captured microorganisms separately via existing bacterial detection methods [43, 44] .",

This range of flow rates corresponds to breathing rates for standing or walking adults.
