If this international research effort is going to be as swift and effective as possible, it will need to rely on a principle of open science. When researchers share data, code, and software and generally make their work as transparent as possible, it allows other researchers to verify and expand upon their work. Furthermore, it allows public officials to make informed decisions. In this study, we analyzed 535 preprint articles related to COVID-19 for eight transparency criteria and recorded study location and funding information. We found that individual researchers have lined up to help during this crisis, quickly tackling important public health questions, often without funding or support from outside organizations. However, most authors could improve their data sharing and scientific reporting practices. The contrast between researchers' commitment to doing important research and their reporting practices reveals underlying weaknesses in the research community's reporting habits, but not necessarily their science.",

The actual number of cases is likely much higher, 1 and the disease is still in its early phases, meaning that COVID-19 could have a staggering human toll. No matter its ultimate trajectory, the virus has already sparked an economic crisis, which will 2 have its own implications for global justice. 3 More now than ever, scientists and public officials need access to good, accurate information to inform their research and decision-making. Top researchers in affected nations have swiftly taken up the charge, researching the virus, its trajectory, and best practices for treating and preventing the spread of the virus. But scientists' task does not end with analyzing results. Here at Ripeta, we have always recognized that open science supports good science, so this outbreak has heightened the importance of transparently sharing data, analysis methods, software, and code. When research is truly reproducible, it allows researchers to evaluate and expand upon each other's work. Right now, 4 that could mean lives saved. And, the easier it is for researchers to replicate each other's work, the more quickly we will learn about COVID-19. We echo the sentiments of Wellcome Trust, which has urged \" researchers, journals and funders to ensure that the research findings and data relevant to this outbreak are shared rapidly and openly to inform the public health response and help save lives.\" 5",

Our research found that 8% of preprint articles received no funding. Furthermore, several new preprint articles related to COVID-19 are uploaded to medRxiv and bioRxiv each day. These actions reveal the dedication of scientists to provide their scientific information to decision-makers as quickly as possible. Yet, we found that most authors are not employing best reporting practices, despite the importance of open science during a health crisis. Many authors did not make their data readily accessible, did not share code, and did not engage in other important transparency practices. At a time when many scientists are going above and beyond to promote their research, these findings suggest that the scientific community may not recognize the role that certain criteria play in reproducibility and may not appreciate the extent to which open science promotes innovation and advancement. It may also signal that it is simply difficult to improve the reporting and data sharing practices within science.",

Furthermore, almost all authors provided a funding statement, and over half of authors described their analysis processes. Perhaps most importantly, only 21% of authors included data availability statements, and only 11% of those made their data available in external repositories. Though we found that the data for 46% of those articles were available online, many of these studies used pre-existing online data, meaning that they did not actually make new data available. These low numbers suggest that some authors might not recognize the importance of data sharing, believing that they only need to share their methods in order to make their studies reproducible. Overall, authors who engaged in more reporting practices may have simply been exposed to more information about how to promote transparency. Conversely, authors who engaged in fewer of the practices may have been confused by conflicting advice in the myriad of available author guidelines. Thus, our findings 6 suggest the need to make clear cases for a handful of the most important reporting practices as often and as publicly as possible.",

Though authors may care about reporting practices, they may not know which ones are most important, and they may choose to focus their energy on the content of their research. Furthermore, the peer review process is labor intensive and time consuming, and reviewers may understandably focus on process, results, and content more than specific reporting guidelines. The scientific community can combat this issue by implementing automated reviews when possible. As shown in this study, there are many checks for certain reproducibility and integrity criteria that have been and can be automated. It took approximately 30 minutes to do automated checks for all 535 papers, while our manual checks took approximately 5 minutes per paper, culminating in dozens of hours of work. Thus, automation would make reporting checks feasible by drastically reducing the time it takes to conduct them, allowing expert reviewers to focus on evaluating the science itself. Before proceeding to peer review, authors would need to address any transparency concerns and conduct a second automated check.",

Finally, we must reiterate the general importance of open science: that our best work comes from the knowledge we create together, across borders and with collaborators we may never know exist.",
