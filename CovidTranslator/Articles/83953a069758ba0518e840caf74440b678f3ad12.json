            "text": "In the USA, this condition has not been a problem, as ferrets are usually supplied to the pet market by Marshall Farms, New York, as young animals already sterilized at 6 weeks of age. Some private breeders however do not agree with such early sterilization, so supply to the pet market young ferrets that need to be sterilized. This procedure is usually done, as in Australia and elsewhere, at 5-6 months of age if the ferret is not going on to breeding. Opinion is now increasing against the too early sterilization of ferrets, which may bring its own problems. The sterilization of ferrets at 5-6 months was advocated for some time by American veterinarians (S. Brown, pers. comm. 1994). The condition of POA can be life-threatening. 1 Jills in heat over 1 month without being served by a hob would be at risk. The condition is an aplastic anaemia with bone marrow depression. Ferrets living outside will sometimes carry a flea burden. In the event of POA or other illness, the ferrets lose the ability to groom and the flea burden increases, adding to the sickness. Ferrets are highly susceptible to oestrogeninduced toxicity of the haematopoietic tissue like dogs. Aplastic anaemia is uncommon in domesticated species (with the exception of the cat with FeLV, which develops an erythroid hypoplasia) but has been described in six pet ferrets by Kociba and Caputo. 2 In Hungary, the pet ferrets are normally not sterilized until 6 months of age and usually after the first litter. Consequently, ferret owners have to be aware of POA (A. Prohaczik, pers. comm. 2005).",

It is interesting that the first death occurred 1 month after the start of oestrus, the last deaths 6 months after, while the 12 remaining ferrets went into anoestrous. This phenomenon can be seen in practice where some ferrets, which miss the first early September mating but then come into heat again in December display more acute cases of POA unless mated. Usually the prognosis is poor for untreated ferrets at any time in the breeding season. Breeding jills in later life, which mate but fail to conceive, may develop ovarian tumours, possibly oestrogen-induced. 4 Sherrill and Gorham found that the disease is initiated by prolonged high blood levels of oestrogens leading to a depressed bone marrow with hypocellularity and resulting temporary thrombocytosis, then thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, eosinopenia and anaemia of the normocytic, normochromic, or macrocytic, hypochromic kind.",

The jill's owner becomes aware of the continuing swollen vulva, which is easily traumatized. I have seen cases including one of my own jills with pale mucous membranes, depression and anorexia. Bilateral alopecia is also seen with skin ecchymosis and petechial haemorrhages ( Fig. 11.1a,b) . Hind leg posterior paralysis can develop, which may occur from a subdural haematoma of the spinal cord or brain. Systolic heart murmurs are usually detectable due the acute anaemia. The scats can show melaena due to gastrointestinal bleeding. A vulval discharge due to a concurrent metritis/ vaginitis can occur followed by pyometra, collapse and death. Note: the usual cause of death is the haemorrhage associated with the thrombocytopenia. Differential diagnosis: spayed jills can show alopecia and a swollen vulva but here the problem is usually adrenal gland neoplasia (AGN) with involvement of vestigial ovarian tissue and seen in America as ferret adrenal disease complex (Ch. 14). 1 In some cases, remnant ovarian tissue can lead to POA signs. The condition has been found by Greg Rich in one ferret where an ovary remnant plus a cystic kidney could be displayed postoperatively (Fig. 11.1c ).",

Subdural haematoma or haematomyelia occur in the thoracic, lumbar and sacral skeletal regions and become the cause of ataxia and paraplegia. The vulval discharges and pyometra experienced by the ferret are caused by an E. coli pyometritis and/or a Corynebacteria vaginitis. The possibility of bronchopneumonia can be due to Klebsiella species. 2 Diagnosis This is indicated by the obvious vulval swelling and associated alopecia in the unsterilized jill. A blood PCV of less than 20% is conclusive. It is possible to do vaginal cytology but not usually necessary. 7 The jill when seen may be well into POA and signs of pyometra and pneumonia plus CNS conditions may confuse the picture.

This is given in September as oestrus commences (March in the northern hemisphere) when the jill has been on heat for 10 days. This drug technique was trialed by M. Oxenham with the Wessex Ferret Club, UK in 1984 with success. 8 Proligestone is given at 0.5 mL s.c., which causes reduction of vulval swelling in 3-4 days.

The infective agent was found to be a Streptococcus. In breeding colonies, the bedding adhered to the vulva during the jill's oestrus because of mucous secretion. The clinical signs were again a yellow mucopurulent vulval discharge, which could lead to secondary metritis and signs of septicaemia. Pathological signs included a nondestructive purulent vaginitis and cervicitis with secondary ulcerative purulent metritis in some cases. The treatment followed the usual lines of removing the foreign material from the vagina and using longterm penicillin.

With infected tissue however, treatment involves surgical removal of the prostate mass, which is not an easy operation. The infective greenish material of a prostate abscess is cultured and the ferret must be placed on a broad-spectrum antibiotic of choice for many weeks. 1 For treating the hormone-affected prostate without surgery, the best medical treatment is flutamide, which was tested by Rosenthal and is used now extensively by Brown and others in the USA (S. Brown, pers. comm. 1999). This human drug acts as an anti-androgen at the level of the prostate, by blocking the effect of excessive androgen hormones being produced by the adrenals via receptors in the prostate tissue, thus preventing stimulation of the prostate tissue. The dose rate for ferrets is 10 mg/kg q. 12 h p.o. The drug is expensive and would require special compounding for use in ferrets; it could however be used to avoid costly prostate surgery (Ch. 18). Thus in cases of prostatic disease where there is no obstruction of the urinary tract and no evidence of infection, flutamide can be very effective in slowing or reducing the prostatic condition. If surgery has been carried out, the drug will prevent recurrence but would have to be given for life. The prognosis of this condition is variable as it may not be possible to remove all the cancer to stop recurrence. It may even be necessary to perform a cystotomy on the sick ferret as well. 1",

Being thin, the ferret could be palpated easily and showed a 4-5 cm long mass in the midabdominal area, which on radiology and subsequent post mortem of the ferret was found to be one of two cystic kidneys. The enlarged kidneys had typical irregular surfaces with multiple translucent fluid-filled cysts of the cortex and medulla. The ureters were patent which ruled out bilateral hydronephrosis. If one kidney only had been affected it could have been removed and the ferret could have survived. The cystic spaces were lined by cuboidal epithelium but there were some normal glomeruli and tubules in the affected kidneys, though fibrous thickening of the renal tissue was progressing. The aetiology of cystic kidneys is considered as hereditary, developmental or acquired. 17 Kidney failure occurs secondary to the renal cyst disease so with suspect cases a check of renal functions is required. This should include a complete blood count, urine check and serum chemistry plus ultrasound and even intravenous pyelographs if possible. 7 It is noted by one author 17 that bilateral multiple cortical renal cysts must be distinguished from those of kidney polycystic disease. The latter is seen in man and is hereditary. Both diseases have early irregular renal cyst distribution but polycystic disease is known to have cysts in other organs such as the liver. Besides other animals and fish where polycystic disease is recorded, it has been noted in the mustelids in striped skunks. 18",

Pyelonephritis is an acute infection of the kidney. In general, acute renal failure may be overcome but there may be kidney damage which gives rise to a stressed kidney, then progressive renal failure leading to chronic renal failure or chronic interstitial nephritis. It is useful to consider renal disease in cats as with young adult cats it can involve lower urinary tract inflammation and urethral obstruction. 23 In young ferrets, urethral obstruction in some sterilized hobs has been seen in the USA but not to date in Australia. It is considered to be a diet problem by some authorities (J. Bell pers. comm. 1998). In older cats, the problem is usually a progressive loss of renal function and older ferrets show similar problems. This has been seen in Australia and other countries. With ferrets from 6-10 years, the renal problems of ageing occur which might be exacerbated by climate where ferrets are kept outdoors all the time. Outdoor ferrets in the UK and New Zealand, for instance, are not stressed by heat through living in a colder climate. Ferrets being outside in a hot climate should have facilities to go below ground away from the heat or be kept in cool sheds. They usually sleep by day and are active in the evening and night (Ch. 3).",

Toxicity effects with ferrets can be a constant worry. 21 Sick ferret rehydration requires lactated Ringer's solution or, if hyperkalaemia (high potassium) is present or suspected, the use of 0.9% normal saline is necessary. 23 Even when water is available for sick ferrets, oliguria occurs and may persist after rehydration. In cats the correction of metabolic acidosis is only necessary with pH <7.2 or serum <14 mm/L. The hyperkalaemia can be managed temporarily with sodium bicarbonate, glucose/insulin and calcium gluconate administration. A diuretic course should be given with sick ferrets with oliguria. Furosemide (frusemide) is recommended at 1-2 mg/kg p.o., i.m. or i.v. b.i.d. A diuretic given hours or days after the initial onset of ARF will not decrease the severity of renal damage but polyuric animals are easier to manage. 23 Beware of over-hydration with fluid therapy and diuretic use, which can lead to pulmonary oedema where there is a persistent oliguria. To prevent excess sodium, the i.v. fluids should be changed to 2.5% dextrose in 0.5% saline or 5% dextrose in water. 23 Maintenance fluids should thus have low sodium (<70 mmol/L) and high potassium (>20 mmol/L). The rate of administration should be slowed to replace the insensible losses + urine production + gastrointestinal losses (diarrhoea and vomiting); in the ferret this could be around 100 mL/kg per day. Thus a maintenance rate of 4 mL/kg per hour, at least, plus any additional losses is required (Ch. 16). Peritoneal dialysis can be attempted in cases where persistent oliguria leads to dangerous hyperkalaemia, extreme azotaemia and severe metabolic acidosis, but even treating cats the results are relatively poor. 23 This can be due to the severity of renal damage in ARF, which prevents a return to normal renal function and possibly due to complications associated with any dialysis, e.g. peritonitis. Note that polyuria could occur in ferrets, as in cats. In an ARF situation where drugs like gentamycin or amphotericin B are used over a long period, they can be nephrotoxic. 21 Care should be taken to avoid such drugs if possible.",

Increased urinary losses of protein or of specific amino acids can occur in renal failure c. In CRF, the protein requirements for dogs and cats, and probably ferrets, have not been established. It is likely that they may be different or higher than those of healthy animals. Thus, consideration should be made to providing high quality protein sources for use in restricted protein diets to prevent essential amino acid deficiencies. Very low protein diets may not be accepted easily by dogs, cats 27 or ferrets. With CRF dogs, the protein intake is recommended at not less than 1.9 g/kg body weight daily unless further restrictions are required to control uraemia (~11 g protein/400 kcal metabolizable energy (ME) from a 10 kg dog diet). 27 CRF cats have a greater risk of protein malnutrition due to the inability to downregulate hepatic enzyme activity associated with protein catabolism, even when the dietary protein intake is low. 27 In CRF ferrets the effect of reducing protein intake has not been fully studied. 16 It is surmised that restriction of dietary protein before clinical signs of CRF would delay the progression of renal damage. 27 Could this concept be applicable to ferrets? Could it be postulated that feeding ferrets at a lower food weight, instead of continuous ad lib feeding, may take stress off the kidneys? However, evidence is not clear about this concept for dogs and cats. It could be speculated that the idea might be one of the answers explaining why working ferrets in temperate climates, which get fed once daily or even a. Thus hyperkalaemia caused by an obligatory potassium loss, as seen in the cat, is possible in ferrets and would require dietary replacement of the mineral b. The blood calcium concentration in CRF can be low, normal or high, so calcium supplementation would be helpful in hypocalcaemia but contraindicated in the presence of hypercalcaemia c. The kidneys play a primary role in sodium homeostasis, so in CRF, as the glomerular filtration rate falls, the surviving nephrons have to increase their secretion of sodium to cope with the increased delivery rate. This must decrease in efficiency as the disease progresses.",

The disease is characterized by solitary or multiple renal cystic calculi or possibly sandy material in the bladder or urethra. A urethral blockage is the outcome and can be very acute in sterilized hobs and less acute in sterilized jills. In the latter, large stones can develop in the bladder before symptoms arise. Struvite (magnesium ammonium phosphate) uroliths occur with or without a urinary tract infection. The aetiology of struvite disease is not clear but it is considered that diet is a likely factor as seen by work at Marshall Farms. 12 The normal pH of hob and jill ferret urine is 6-7.5. 7 A diet that contains mostly plant source protein will produce a urine pH above 6.0, the point at which struvite crystals will form; with an animal protein diet, the metabolic processes form acid urine. Ferrets fed on cat food can be at risk of struvite formation 12 because most generic cat foods and cat chow contain a corn base. Ferrets on pelleted dog food are at risk as the food contains a high fibre and vegetable content (Ch. 4). In Australia, New Zealand and Europe where working and pet ferrets are on a fresh meat diet, any urolithiasis is rare. Working ferrets are less likely to get urolithiasis anyway compared with sterilized pet ferrets. Note that by keeping ferrets off dry ferret or cat food this problem can be avoided. It is suggested that high quality cat food such as Iams, ANF Tami Premium and Science diets, as in the USA, will not induce struvite formation as they are meat-based diets. 12 ",

Catheterization is difficult, though not impossible, in the male ferret due to the J-shaped os penis (baculum) but is described in Chapter 20. However, trauma from the operation may induce an ascending infection. Also, the penis may be quickly filled with fine struvite material after the initial pressure is relieved. For that reason, a cystotomy is preferable. 12 The bladder can be first decompressed using a 22-25 gauge needle, removing most of the struvite content and flushing out with saline and repeated or a full cystotomy done (S. Brown, pers. comm. 1997). This is obviously less stressful to the ferret. It may be possible to retrograde flush via a catheter in the prepuce. Note: the prepuce is pinched as the back flushing is done and possibly clears struvite grains. If a cystotomy is carried out, the bladder is then flushed with saline, an antibiotic drug is left in the bladder and the ferret is put onto a fresh meat diet. In the USA, some cases of urolithiasis are so severe that a perineal urethrostomy is required.",

            "text": "With the jill, surgery would be required to remove the bladder stones. With the jill there is more time to prepare in contrast to the sterilized hob. Brown did not find calculolytic diets useful. 1 Ferret emergency procedures were needed (Ch. 20). When the jill undergoes surgery, the urethra is checked as stones too large for the jill to expel via the vulva will get lodged and must be repositioned into the bladder by gentle manipulation. Thus they can be removed with the cystotomy. It is advisable to operate on pregnant jills quickly as they may sometimes develop a prolapsed rectum and vagina with resulting fatal haemorrhage due to tissue damage (D. Manning, pers. comm. 1998). The situation of stone formation can be avoided by a good diet! It is considered that sterilized hobs and jills, pregnant or not, will tolerate the anaesthesia and the kittens carried by a pregnant jill will not be compromised. The ferret's postoperative care would involve use of broadspectrum antibiotics such as clavulanic acid/amoxicillin (Clavulox palatable drops) 0.25 mL b.i.d., or a trimethoprim-sulfa combination at 15-30 mg/kg q. 12 h, p.o. or s.c. after urine and stones culture. The latter drug is useful as it will concentrate in the urine and most pathogenic urinary organisms are sensitive to it. The drug tablet has to be made up in solution. Paediatric drops can be used for ferrets if available. Dietary changes away from the offending vegetable protein type food should be gradual, with the ferret given a wide selection of high quality cat food as ferrets might reject a sudden change. 12 It is suggested that warming pelleted foods may be acceptable. In a suspect urinary case, I have used diced lamb hearts covered in a chicken stock, which was licked up before the meat was eaten. As a diet, eggnog with 20% fat level, is made with whipped cream, milk and egg yolk with a tablespoon of raw pureed liver added to each 6 oz; this is highly palatable to the ferret. The diet provides a concentrated source of calories, especially for those affected pregnant or lactating jills and remarkably will lower the urine pH, even when the original diet is still fed. 12 Fresh water should of course be available to ferrets at all times but in my experience ferrets do not drink to excess, unless sick, and do get a fair amount of fluid from fresh meat. There are specialized diets such as the Hill's Prescription Diet range with Canine s/d used as an aid to the dissolution of struvite urolithiasis and initial control of struvite crystalluria. I would consider a whole fresh meat diet would have avoided this crisis. It might be difficult to get clients to move away from dry foods for ferrets, which of course are considered 'convenient' as they are for feeding dogs and cats. As has been stated regarding ferret nutrition, many USA veterinarians dealing with ferrets are reconsidering the feeding of dry food over the long term with regard to other possible conditions besides urolithiasis (S. Brown, pers. comm. 1998).",

The ferret showed no specific urinary tract signs and there appeared to be no abdominal distension or discomfort.

In ferrets suffering dilatative cardiomyopathy, sinus rhythm, atrial and ventricular arrhythmias, atrial premature contraction (APC), ventricular premature contraction (VPC) and different degrees of A-V block have been detected. 32 The S wave is seen in leads II, III, or aVF indicating right ventricular enlargement (RVE), ventricular premature contractions (VPC); bradycardia or tachycardia (Fig. 11.20 ). If possible, the ferret ECG is recorded without resort to sedation but this is sometimes not possible, so light isoflurane anaesthesia is advised. The ECG clips will have to be adapted for ferrets with the teeth on the alligator clips flattened and/or covered with gauze ( Fig. 11.21) . 33 Experimental values for ferrets were obtained under anaesthesia, which can be compared with anaesthetic ideas (Ch. 16). The ECG values of 52 clinically normal ferrets obtained by Bone et al. 34 are shown in Table 11 .9, with the ferrets under ketamine and ketamine-xylazine combination. The latter procedure proved best in obtaining a stable ECG base line, due to fewer muscle tremors and more relaxed ferrets under the combination. In another study by Smith and Bishop 35 recording ECGs on weanlings, normal adults and ferrets with right ventricular hypertrophy, the young ferrets were anaesthetized using ketamine (15 mg/kg i.m.) but with halothane (1%) after intubation. The adults were anaesthetized by sodium pentobarbital (25 mg/kg i.p.) and readings were taken with the subject in right lateral recumbency. The recording were taken using leads I, II, aVR, aVL and aVF. The ECGs obtained of normal and affected ferrets are shown in Figure 11 .20. All ferrets showed (a) normal sinus rhythm while diseased ferrets showed (b) disruption of heart cycle. Ferrets with cardiac disease commonly show a sinus tachycardia and less commonly a sinus bradycardia and conductive disturbances. 33 Abnormal rhythms are ventricular premature contractions (VPC), atrial premature contractions (APC) (Fig. 11.22 ), second and third degree AV block (Fig. 11.23 ). Sternal positioning produces larger QRSs than right lateral positioning (Finkler, pers. comm. 2005 ).

If the dose is tolerated, increase on daily basis but if ferret is lethargic adjust to once every 3 days. Why use enalapril? In the normal ferret when there is low blood pressure, the kidney is stimulated to release the enzyme rennin which acts on catalyzing the conversion of angiotensinogen to angiotensin I, which is converted by an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) in the lungs to angiotensin II. This latter powerful vasoconstrictor helps readjust blood pressure to vital organs. It increases aldosterone production and sodium resorption while stimulating myocardial fibrosis and remodels the heart. There are many receptors on the heart for this hormone. Thus, in the normal animal it is compensatory but in the heart-diseased animal it is deleterious. Enalapril maleate (Merial) is an ACE inhibitor, blocking the angiotensin II and thus aldosterone production, vasoconstriction and myocardial reconstruction (T. Kawasaki, pers. comm. 2005 ).

That, and the total lack of response to any conventional therapy they initiated, led them to believe that they were indeed dealing with a disease process they had not previously encountered. Dr Mike Garner at Northwest ZooPath in the Seattle, Washington area, agreed after viewing histopathology specimens. He noted a suppurative myositis involving nearly all muscle groups in the body, including the heart.

The complete lack of response to numerous antibiotics also makes these aetiologies less likely. Rickettsia may elude detection more easily than bacteria, so cannot be completely ruled out. Negative electron microscopy and virus isolation studies are inconclusive. Low viral numbers and difficulty with detection of some viruses can produce negative results even in the face of viral infection. Only a few cases have had EM and virus isolations studies, so no conclusions can yet be drawn regarding a viral aetiology at this time. Prions and protozoa tend not to incite a neutrophilic inflammation; fungal infection is unlikely due to lack of visualization of fungal elements with special staining.",

Canine distemper virus could also mimic these initial signs, but is far less common and should only be considered in unvaccinated ferrets. One or two enlarged firm peripheral lymph nodes would also be suspicious for DIM; lymphoma would be a differential diagnosis.",

Moderate to severe leukocytosis with neutrophilia is consistent with DIM, especially if other findings are mostly normal. If neutrophilia is not present or is not extreme, i.e. <12 000/\u03bcL, then a follow-up CBC should be performed 5-7 days after the initial blood profile; in many cases the neutrophilia will have markedly increased during that time.

The best muscles to biopsy ante-mortem, based on severity of pathology in past cases, would be rear leg or lumbar muscles. Oesophageal muscle has the most consistently severe lesions but is not practical to biopsy except on post mortem exam. If peripheral lymphadenopathy is present, a lymph node biopsy should be performed. Biopsy sam-ples should be preserved in formalin, with additional samples sent for bacterial culture and sensitivity if possible. The author recommends samples be sent to Dr Mike Garner at Northwest ZooPath (near Seattle, Washington, USA) as he has been evaluating tissues samples from multiple cases from the time they first recognized the syndrome. Ideally, the practitioner submitting tissues should contact Dr Garner regarding any need for additional tissue samples (besides formalin-fixed tissues) that he may use for other testing modalities.",
