Coulter and shown to possess inhibitory activity against several Gram-positive bacteria, including isolates of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Mycobacterium bovis BCG, and avirulent Bacillus anthracis (Sterne strain), among others. These results prompted the design and synthesis of two new classes of compounds, phenoxystyrenes and phenothiostyrenes, as analogs of the natural antimicrobial stilbene. These and additional stilbenoid analogs were synthesized using new, efficient, copper-mediated coupling strategies. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) antimicrobial assays were performed on all compounds prepared. These preliminary structure-activity relationship studies indicated that both new classes of synthetic analogs, as well as the stilbenes, show promising activity against Gram-positive bacteria when at least one phenolic moiety is present, but not when absent. The potencies of the phenolic phenoxystyrenes and phenothiostyrenes were found to be comparable to those of the phenolic stilbenes tested.",

Interestingly, compound 1 was identified in the plants, Didymochlaena truncatala (Sw.) J.

            "text": "After the purification of the natural product 1, a battery of minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) assays was performed to assess the range of antimicrobial activity. 7 Analysis of those studies indicated that 1 exhibited selective inhibition of the growth of numerous clinically relevant Gram-positive bacteria at reasonably low concentrations. 1 For example, 1 was found to inhibit the growth of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) with an MIC of 32 lg/mL and of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) with an MIC of 16 lg/mL (Table 1) . 1 Currently, MRSA and VRE are two bacterial species of growing concern to the medical community because of the development of widespread resistance to existing frontline drugs. [8] [9] [10] In addition, 1 also showed very good inhibitory activity against the Sterne strain of Bacillus anthracis (MIC 8 lg/mL), the attenuated variant of the causative species of anthrax, as well as promising activity against other related Bacillus species (Table 1) . Furthermore, natural product 1 was found to be effective in inhibiting the growth of Mycobacterium bovis with an MIC of 26 lg/mL, which indicated it might serve as a promising lead scaffold in the development of drugs used to combat drug resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis infections. Organic and medicinal chemists have found trans-stilbene scaffolds to be an intriguing structural class of compounds (e.g., see methoxylated and phenolic stilbenes, Fig. 1 ). 11, 12 These stilbene scaffolds may be considered to be 'privileged structures' because of their wide variety of biological activity. 11, 12 Indeed, (E)-stilbenoid compounds are widely distributed throughout nature, [13] [14] [15] and natural methoxylated and phenolic stilbenes are found in numerous medicinal plants and food products. 11, 12 For instance, the natural phenolic stilbene, resveratrol (trans-3,5,4 0 -trihydroxystilbene), has been shown to possess a diverse range of biological and potential therapeutic properties. [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] Specifically, resveratrol and its related substituted (E)-stilbenes have been forwarded as potential: (i) cancer chemotherapeutic agents that inhibit in vitro growth of human cancer cell lines; [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] (ii) anti-inflammatory agents that act through the cyclooxygenase (COX) enzyme inhibition mechanism; [16] [17] [18] and (iii) antioxidants, 18 which may serve as chemo-protective agents. Resveratrol and its analogs also may prevent heart disease due to the lipid lowering effects and through the inhibition of lipid peroxidation. 14 Additional properties of resveratrol, such as radical scavenging, 15 neuroprotection, 15 antiviral activity, 15 antibacterial activity, 18-23 inhibition of SARS coronavirus replication, 24 anti-platelet aggregation, 25 anti-carcinogenic activity, 25 anti-HIV activity, 25 and inhibition of human cytochrome P450 1B1 26 have all recently been documented.",

The condensation of the benzyl bromide-derived phosphorate and 3,5-dimethoxybenzaldehyde, under basic conditions, yielded a mixture of stilbenes 1a in a Z:E ratio of approximately 1:4 (Scheme 1). The pure E-3,5-dimethoxystilbene 1a was obtained from this mixture by crystallization from methanol and water. Subsequent mono-demethylation of (E)-1a using BBr 3 at \u00c078\u00b0C gave the desired phenolic stilbene 1 in good yield.",

Importantly, the phenolic 2-and 3-styrylthiophenes 8 and 9, respectively, were produced efficiently using this one-pot process. 27 Thus, coupling between the TBDPS-protected arylvinyl iodide 7 and the thiophenyl zinc reagent, followed by deprotection using TBAF-THF, afforded the target phenolic styrylthiophenes without the requirement of an extra demethylation step.",

All of the dimethoxylated compounds, 1a, 5-6, 17-23, and 29, were devoid of inhibitory activity against the Gram-positive (and Gram-negative) species investigated. However, natural product 1 and all of its analogs that contain a meta-hydroxy group (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) (14) (15) (16) 26) exhibited inhibitory activity against Gram-positive organisms, even when this moiety was located in the phenoxy ring as opposed to the styryl ring, as seen in compound 26. These results are not surprising because phenolic compounds are viewed as one of the major classes of natural antimicrobial agents. 31 Perhaps the most exciting finding in this study is that both the phenoxystyrene and phenothiostyrene analogs (10) (11) (12) (13) (14) (15) (16) 26) of the phenolic stilbenes (1, (8) (9) are roughly equivalent in their potency in the MIC assays performed. Although none of these vinyl ether or vinyl thioether analogs was significantly better at inhibition of the growth of Gram-positive microorganisms than the original natural (16 lg/mL), and was only 2-fold less potent than 1 against MRSA (32 lg/mL) and M. smegmatis (128 lg/mL). These initial results are highly encouraging in consideration of the viability of using phenoxystyrene and phenothiostyrene scaffold structural analogs of bioactive antimicrobial stilbenes to treat disease because they are stable at low and high pH values. Indeed, these novel scaffolds may serve as excellent starting points for further chemical optimization and the development of new drugs that are certainly needed to combat threatening MRSA, tuberculosis, and anthrax infections. Furthermore, because trans-stilbenes have been shown to possess such a diverse array of biological activity, 11-26 these findings should promote additional SAR studies of stilbenoid compounds for additional therapeutic areas.",

Importantly, 1 was active against M. bovis (BCG) and against B. anthracis, as well as three related Bacillus species. When the phenolic stilbene scaffold was modified with other aryl moieties or extended by one heteroatom to create the novel phenoxystyrene and phenothiostyrene derivatives, these agents also demonstrated promising antimicrobial activity, given that at least one phenolic moiety was present, as in compounds 8-16 and 26. Consequently, further exploration of these novel scaffolds is warranted from both synthetic and microbiological perspectives. Additional SAR studies of these novel homologous stilbenoid compounds and more extensive microbiological characterization of the active agents are currently underway. ",

For example, the phenolic ether 12 was equipotent to 1 in the inhibition of the growth of both S. aureus and M. smegmatis (16 lg/mL) and only 2-fold less potent than 1 in the inhibition of the growth of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) and B. cereus (32 lg/ mL). Likewise, phenolic thioether 16 had the same MIC value as 1 in the inhibition of the growth of both S. aureus and B. cereus",
