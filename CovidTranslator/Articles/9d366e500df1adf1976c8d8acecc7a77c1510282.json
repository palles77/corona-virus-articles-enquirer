The DI RNAs were detected in RNA isolated from virus particles and in 2.3 M LiCI-soluble RNA fractions isolated from inoculated leaves. Symptom attenuation leading to persistent infections was closely correlated with the passage in which Dls first developed. Comparisons of nucleotide sequences of 10 cDNA clones from 2 DI RNA populations and with a previously characterized TBSV DI RNA revealed the same four regions of sequence from the TBSV genome were strictly conserved in each of the DI RNAs: the virus 5' leader sequence of 168 bases; a region of approximately 200-250 bases from the viral polymerase gene; approximately 70 bases from the 3 terminus of the viral pl9 and p22 genes; and approximately 130 bases from the 3'terminal noncoding region. Conservation of the sequence motif present in all of the Dls suggests that there might be a common mechanism of DI formation as well as selection pressure to maintain sequences essential for replication and encapsidation.",

Dls have been reported for virtually every family of animal viruses and are thought to occur universally (Perrault, 1981) . The Dls associated with RNA viruses of animals have proved particularly useful for identifying sequence elements involved in viral functions such as encapsidation and replication (Levis et a/., 1986; Weiss et a/., 1989; Schlesinger, 1988) and they have also been implicated as important components in driving viral evolution (Steinhauer and Holland, 1987; De Polo et a/., 1987) . Although most frequently studied in cell culture, there is increasing evidence that Dls play a role in natural infections in modulating disease symptoms and in establishing virus persistence (Barrett and Dimmock, 1986 ). However, due to complications presented by the immune and interferon systems in animal hosts, this role has been difficult to establish unambiguously (Huang. 1988) .",

Among these, DI RNAs which meet the criteria of Huang and Baltimore (1970) have been described for only two related groups of plant viruses, the tombusviruses and carmoviruses (see Morns and Knorr, 1990 , for a review). Biological and molecular characterization of a novel RNA species associated with the cherry strain of tomato bushy stunt virus (TBSV) provided the first definitive demonstration of DI RNAs associated with a plant virus infection (Hillman et a/., 1987) . It was also shown that the lethal necrosis syndrome normally caused by TBSV in solanaceous hosts was prevented by the DI RNA and persistent infections resulted. The DI RNA (termed DI 1) was shown to be a collinear deletion mutant of TBSV that was dependent on the parent virus for both replication and encapsidation. TBSV DI RNAs were shown to reduce virus accumulation in infected plants (Hillman et al., 1987) and to inhibit genomic RNA replication in protoplasts (Jones e? al., 1990) . Subsequently, DI RNAs were found associated with two other tombusviruses, cymbidium ringspot virus (Burgyan et a/., 1989) and cucumber necrosis virus (D. Rochon, personal communication;",

In general, Dls can arise in cell cultures when a fully competent virus is passaged serially at high multiplicities of infection (m.0.i.). In such experiments, preexisting Dls would appear as species of uniform size after serial passage of independent isolates, while de nova generation of Dls from the helper virus genome would result in the appearance of DI species with different sizes (Holland, 1990) . Accordingly, we investigated the de nova generation of TBSV DI RNAs by analogous high m.o.i. passage experiments performed in planta. Our results indicate that TBSV DI RNAs arise spontaneously upon passage, and that the de nova appearance of DI RNAs is closely associated with attenuation of symptoms induced by the virus. We have also characterized biologically active DI RNAs from two independent populations generated during passage. Comparisons of sequences revealed that DI RNAs retained four conserved regions from the TBSV genome.",

Sixteen independent DI-free TBSV isolates, each derived from a single local lesion of the DI-free TBSV stock culture, were passaged serially on two systemic plant hosts, N. clevelandii and N. benthamiana. On each host species, six isolates were passed at high m.o.i. and two control isolates were passed at low m.o.i. In these hosts, DI-free TBSV induces lethal necrosis within 7-l 0 days postinoculation (d.p.i.), except in the presence of DI RNAs which are associated with attenuation and the establishment of persistent infections (Hillman et a/., 1987) . For each local lesion isolate, detection of DI RNAs and appearance of symptom attenuation were noted and the results are summarized in Table 1 . None of the isolates passed at low m.o.i. developed attenuated symptoms, but by the eleventh passage, each of the isolates passed at high m.o.i. were inducing attenuated symptoms. The passage at which symptom attenuation appeared in each of the high m.o.i. isolates was not uniform, occurring as early as passage 3 for two isolates (C6 and B7), and as late as passage 11 for others (Bl 1 and B12). As summarized in Table 1 , in each case where symptom attenuation was apparent, low molecular weight (LMW) RNAs of approximately 400-600 bases were detected in the LiCI-soluble fraction of the cellular RNA extracts. Examples of these are presented for the different isolates at passage 11 in Figs. 1 C and 1 D. The small RNAs which developed in each of the high m.o.i. isolates hybridized to both 5'-and 3'-proximal TBSV genomic sequences, but generally were larger (-600 bases) than the previously characterized DI 1 RNA species (-400 bases). In 9 of 12 high m.o.i. isolates, the passage at which DI RNAs were detected either coincided with or just preceeded the passage at which symptom attenuation was first observed. However, in three isolates (C2, B8, and B9) DI RNAs were detected several passes prior to symptom attenuation, suggesting that all defective RNAs that were generated were not equally able to interfere with virus symptoms. b Passage number Identifies the number of serial passages on the designated host plants after the initial local lesion transfer at which attenuated symptoms were observed or Dls were detected. N designates inoculations that resulted in lethal necrosis at 7 d.p.i. and in which DI RNAs could not be detected.",

It is evident from the analysis of virion RNAs on the high-resolution polyactylamide gels (Figs. 1A and 1 B) that each of the 12 high m.o.i. isolates contained 1 or 2 major DI RNA species of a discrete size that were not detectable in any of the 4 low m.o.i. isolates. Additional analyses of the LiCI-soluble fraction isolated from the same infected plants of each isolate (Figs. 1 C and 1 D) showed a complex population of low molecular weight RNAs in each of the high m.o.i. lines in addition to the prominent DI species corresponding in size to the DI RNA present the virion RNA fraction. Northern analyses were performed on all of these samples to confirm the TBSV-specific nature of the low molecular weight DI-like species. An analysis of LiCI-fractionated RNAs from tissue and virion RNAs which is typical and representative for 1 high m.o.i. DI RNA-containing isolate (BlO, passage 11) and 1 DIfree low m.o.i. isolate (B15, passage 1 1) is given in Fig.   2 . The results clearly demonstrate that the low m.o.i. line is completely free of detectable DI RNA. Furthermore, the DI RNA species purified from virions in the high m.o.i. line is the same size as the major DI RNA species present in the 2.3 n/l LiCI-soluble fraction isolated from the same tissue, suggesting both that the RNA is highly structured and that it is encapsidated. These results are consistent with the properties of previously characterized DI RNAs found to be associated with this strain of TBSV (Hillman et al., 1987) .",

The encapsidated DI RNAs from isolates C6 and BlO migrated during electrophoresis as apparently homogeneous populations with an estimated size of approximately 600 bases. Complete sequences for four cDNA clones generated from C6 LiCI-soluble RNAs and six cDNA clones generated from BlO vinon RNAs were determined and are presented in Fig. 3 . Although derived independently, the sequence alignments show that the DI RNAs from the C6 and BlO TBSV isolates are strikingly similar. Each of the DI RNAs appears to have been formed by deletion of three large internal regions from the TBSV genome, leaving four regions of sequence with highly conserved boundaries: (region I) the TBSV 5' leader sequence including the initiator methionine codon; (region II) a block of approximately 200 to 250 bases from the putative polymerase gene; (region III) approximately 70 bases from the 3' terminus of the viral P19 and P22 open reading frames (ORFs); and (region IV) the terminus of the 3' nontranslated region (see Fig. 3 ). In each of the clones, patterns of small deletions and nucleotide replacements were identified, indicating that each sequence represented an independent DI RNA.

As shown previously with cloned TBSV, a dinucleotide cap was not required for infectivity of the in vitro transcripts of cloned DI RNAs. The individual cloned DI RNAs attenuated symptoms to the same degree as the parental, noncloned BlO DI RNA population. Interestingly, the homogeneous DI RNA inoculum derived from cloned cDNAs (Fig. 4 , lane 2) gave rise to a complex pattern of smaller RNA spe- ties in the infected plants, suggesting that DI RNAs may be capable of sequence evolution upon reintroduction into plants.

We interpret these results as strong evidence that each DI RNA population arose spontaneously from the viral genome during passage and not from a preexisting template. This conclusion is supported by the demonstration that DI RNAs appeared in each virus isolate at different times during serial passage and were also of different sizes, These observations are consistent with the generally accepted proof for de nova generation of Dls in many well-studied animal virus infections (Holland, 1990) . Subsequent to completing these experiments, we were able to corroborate this conclusion by observing that DI RNAs similar in size to those reported here appeared after high m.o.i. passage of TBSV inocula derived from in vitro transcripts of TBSV cDNA clones. A thorough characterization of those DI RNAs and conditions conducive to their generation will be published elsewhere.",

The difficulties of examining the role of Dls in modulating virus disease and in establishing persistent infections are well known (Huang, 1988; Barrett and Dimmock, 1986) . A plausible alternative would be to pursue such studies using plant virus systems. The strong correlation between symptom attenuation and appearance of Dls supports our previous findings that inhibition of virus replication by DI RNAs also lessens disease severity (Jones et a/., 1990; Hillman et al., 1987) . However, we also observed that in three isolates (C2, B8, and B9) symptom attenuation was delayed by several passes after the initial detection of Dls, and in many of the isolates the dominant DI RNA species became smaller after its initial appearance. Although the overall effects of individual DI RNA species upon virus replication was not determined, it seems likely that some Dls may differ in their ability to interfere with TBSV. A more thorough characterization of the evolution and biological activities of different DI RNA species will be reported elsewhere (D. Knorr and J. Morris, in preparation) .",

Both the processivity of the viral replicase and local structure of the viral template have been implicated in the formation of DI RNAs in other viruses. Makino et a/.

(198 1) identified a hexanucleotide sequence on the vesicular stomatitis virus RNA at which initiation by the viral polymerase led to formation of DI RNAs. In the TBSV, the hexanucleotide motif 5'-APuAGAA-3' occurs at or near the endpoints of regions II and III in the DI RNAs. It is possible that polymerase dissociation and reinitiation take place in these regions and may account for the large deletions generated between these regions. In cloning TBSV genomic sequences we encountered several regions of \"strong stop\" signals. These polymerase-destabilizing regions in the RNA could also contribute to the formation of DI RNAs. Interestingly, the most highly conserved deletion in the DI RNAs, occurring between regions Ill and IV, does not contain a sequence duplication, but rather an inverted repeat of the sequence AGGTTA.",

            "text": "The mechanism of DI-mediated symptom attenuation in TBSV infections is not understood, although recent experiments using protoplasts clearly show that DI RNAs replicate at the expense of the helper virus (Jones et al., 1990) . It seems unlikely that competition for available coat protein during encapsidation is an important factor because proportionally less DI than genomic RNA is encapsidated. It is also unlikely that a specific DI-encoded protein is responsible for attenuation because there are no conserved ORFs of significant size which could be translated without internal initiation and all previous attempts to translate DI RNAs in vitro have been negative (B. Hillman, personal communication). Consequently, the most likely mechanism leading to symptom attenuation is reducedviral replication resulting from competition between the viral genome and DI RNAs for replicase. It seems possible that selection pressure resulting in symptom attenuation would favor replicative fitness of the DI RNAs through FIG. 4. Infectivity of RNA transcripts from cloned TBSV BlO DI RNAs. The DI sequences from independent cDNA clones of the BlO DI RNAs were amplified by PCR. transcribed in vitro and inoculated onto Nicofiene clevelendii plants together with TBSV DI-free genomic RNA. RNA was isolated from inoculated leaves at 7 d.p.i. and the 2.3 M LiCCsoluble fraction was separated in a 5% polyacrylamide gel under nondenaturing conditions (top), togetherwith DI-free TBSV (DI-), a sample product of the T7 transcriptions, a PCR-amplified product, and the LiCI-soluble RNA from a noninoculated plant (Healthy). Below is a Northern blot of the same RNAs probed with a TBSV DI-specific sequence. Because no denaturant was employed, only single-stranded TBSV-specific RNAs hybridized with the probe. (Blumenthal, 1979) and an internal region is also required for maintenance of brome mosaic virus RNA 3 . Internal sequences in Dls associated with vesicular stomatitis virus appear to provide stability and may contribute to the overall persistence of viral infection (O'Hara eta/., 1984) . Another possible function for the internal domains is in promoting the initiation of encapsidation. It has been suggested for TCV that several internal regions may be involved in nucleating virus assembly (Wei et a/,, 1990) . Of significance in that study was the identification of a primary binding site near the amber readthrough codon of the viral replicase, a location similar to that of region II in the TBSV DI RNAs. Judging by relative levels of DI versus genomic RNAs in purified virion preparations (see, Fig. 2 ) DI 1 is packaged less efficiently than Bl 0, and also contains a smaller, more dissected, region II. It is possible that biological properties such as infection persistence are related to the ability of TBSV DI RNAs to become encapsidated, hence the strong 5 .

The same shading pattern is used below to represent each DI sequence in expanded form, with lines to indicate the derivation of each of four conserved regions from the TBSV genome (I-IV). Major deletions forming the four regions are shown as bent lines and straight lines connect the smaller deleted sequences occurring within a region. Each DI RNA contained the entire 5' leader sequence as well as the 3' terminal -130 nucleotides (regions I and IV). The largest difference between the different sequences were the size and internal deletions within reconservation of these sequences in TBSV Dls. gion II. selection of optimal polymerase binding sequences. In addition, the small size and structural stability of DI RNAs might also contribute to their ability to be maintained. Whatever mechanisms are involved, it is clear that selection pressures strongly favor maintenance of DI RNAs that function to down-regulate virus replication and thereby allow host survival and virus persistence.",
