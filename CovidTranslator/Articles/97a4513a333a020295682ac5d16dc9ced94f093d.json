How ever, only at the turn of the century XXI with the appearance of DNA technologies, it became possible to modify plant genomes and to create new types of plants (transgenic plants), which are capable of syn thesizing and accumulating in their tissues recombi nant proteins from various heterologous systems. To date transgenic plants in which nuclear and chloro plast genomes have been transformed with genes encoding heterologous proteins that are important in the treatment of various diseases -antigens of infec tious agents, antibodies, immunomodulators, etc. have been created [1, 2] . Of principal importance of this work development was the creation of the \"edible vaccine\" concept, the essence of which is the use of genetically modified plants containing protein anti gens of infectious agents for oral delivery of relevant antigens to the mucosa of the gastrointestinal tract of warm blooded animals.",

Just this team of researchers not only demonstrated a possibility of the accumulation of the surface HBsAg antigen of hepati tis B virus but also its capability for self assembling in the virus like particles in transgenic tobacco plants. The virus like particles isolated from plant tissues were identical to the particles of HBsAg antigen of indus trial recombinant vaccine obtained in the yeast expres sion system and also to virus like particles from the blood plasma of patients infected with hepatitis B virus.

Heat labile toxin of E. coli consists of two parts: LT A (enzyme) and LT B (pentamer of receptor binding polypeptides). LT B binds to the receptors on the sur face of membranes of epithelial cells of the mammal small intestine and transports LT A in the intestinal cells, where it induces changes in the cell metabolism and cell dehydration. When the two parts of the heat labile enterotoxin are separated, the appearance of the LT B protein complex on the surface of epitheliocytes will stimulate a strong immune response of intestine mucosa without the appearance of any disease signs. Just this feature was the basis for the research of C. Arntzen [6] team on the creation of plant vaccine providing for the resistance to enterotoxigenic E. coli toxins. The authors established that LT B synthesized in transgenic tobacco and potato plants and also LT B isolated from E. coli delivered orally to mice induced similar immune responses.",

The surface of the dome is covered by a specialized follicle associated epithe lium containing the folded cells (M cells), which are able to absorb and transport antigens from the intesti nal lumen. After successful capture, the antigen is par tially cleaved and enters into dendritic cells (see Fig. 1 , step 1). Dendritic cells are especially important in the initiation of adaptive immune responses, since they migrate to the lymph nodes (see Fig. 1 , step 2), and the mediators act in the development of various subpopu lations of T helper cells from naive T lymphocytes and also can interact with B lymphocytes (see Fig. 1 , step 5). The activated B and T cells leave the Peyer's patches and penetrate into the circulatory system.

It is estab lished that recombinant proteins synthesized in chlo roplasts do not differ from native ones in their func tional activities [38, 39] . Chloroplast attractiveness as the system of recombinant protein expression is in the fact that they are closed structures and it preserves the metabolites, which when released into the cytosol are toxic to plant cells, such as B subunit of cholera toxin [38] and trihalose in tobacco cells [40] . On the basis of the above works, it becomes appar ent that transplastome plants can be regarded as the most promising system for efficient production of pro tein antigens. However, the main disadvantage of such expression system at plant vaccine manufacturing is that chloroplasts cannot glycosylate proteins. At present, the creation of transplastome plants is also associated with some technological problems related to the absence of the efficient system of regeneration for most plant species and also with the absence of the efficient system of transgen delivery to the chloroplast genome providing for the high percent of transformed plant yield.",

Main specific immunogenic No. 1 2015 proteins synthesized at respective diseases (structural proteins, hemagglutinins, glycoproteins) are usually used as antigens. The most commonly used method of transgene construct delivering into plant cells is still the agrobacterial transformation. In some cases, the level of target protein expression was rather high [55] [56] [57] [58] , espe cially in the systems of transient expression [59] [60] [61] , and suitable for product commercialization. In all experiments using the \"candidate\" plant vac cines, the formation of a specific immune response was demonstrated in vivo, and in most experiments immunogenic proteins were delivered to animals just orally. \"Candidate\" plant vaccines were usually tested on mice, but in approximately a quarter works the ani mals subjected to the disease were tested. Protein S of the transmissible swine gastroenteritis virus synthe sized in the cells of transgenic maize [55, 62, 63] or tobacco [64] and delivered into the body of pigs as a food supplement, provided for 100% survival of ani mals after infection [62] . Rabbit protein VP60 virus synthesized in potato [65] and other plants (tobacco, pea, rape) [66] and delivered orally enhanced protective immunity: after infecting rabbits with this virus all ani mals survived [66] . The effect of plant recombinant antigen was comparable with commercially used vac cines. The use of plant vaccines for the vaccination of wild animals using edible baits (e.g., vaccine against rabies) will lead to an increase in the proportion of wild animal populations having immunity to the rabies virus.",

The first of them is related to the problem of biosafetythe cultivation of genetically modified plants in the field can lead to the accidental introduction of foreign genes into crops grown for human consumption. Therefore, most companies producing biopharma ceutics focused on plant species, which are absent from the food chain of humans and animals and also on growing of genetically modified plants preventing their cross pollination with other crops. The second difficulty is related to the necessity of plant material treatment for the removal of various undesired com pounds, such as lignin, proteases, phenolic com pounds, and pigments, especially in the case of plant species, which are not consumed. All these facts result in the requirement of additional studies. The third cir cumstance is due to the fact that until now all aspects of maintaining and growing of plants producing biop harmaceuticals are not settled at the legislative level. Ambiguity and vagueness of the existing legislation in this area lead to the fact that large biopharmaceutical and biotechnology companies do not tend to invest in the development of technological lines and research programs in this area, which significantly inhibits the development of the industry. A significant problem for the development of vac cines for veterinary use, especially those used in agri culture, is the need to minimize the price of the final product. The vaccine should be inexpensive for entre preneurs engaged in commercial animal breeding and fully subsidized, if you intend to use the vaccine for mass immunization and the prevention of the disease spread in underdeveloped regions. As a result, the potential income of manufacturers of vaccines for ani mals is much less than that for vaccines intended for humans. For example, in 2007, the volume of the mar ket for the vaccine against human papilloma virus was estimated at more than 1 billion dollars, but the mar ket for the most popular animal vaccines (against foot and mouth disease of cattle and against Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae in pigs) together amounted to only 10-20% of this amount [3] . Animal vaccines are cheaper and the volume of market for them is less; therefore, the investments in their development are substantially less as compared with investments in the production of vaccines for humans, whereas the com plexity and diversity of both hosts and pathogens in the case of vaccines for animals is much higher.",
