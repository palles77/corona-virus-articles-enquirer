            "text": "Sarcoidosis is a multisystem, granulomatous disease whose aetiology is obscure and controversial. Nevertheless, the condition is relatively common with a significantly higher age-adjusted annual incidence in African-Americans (35.5 cases/100 000) versus Caucasian-Americans (10.9 cases/100 000). An estimated one million people in the USA have this disease. Based on the current US population of 315 556 000, there will be approximately 38 605 new cases of sarcoidosis this year and just over 1000 (2.6%) will die of the illness. 1 2 The fundamental pathological abnormality in the disease is the formation of noncaseating epithelioid granulomas, which usually confine poorly soluble foreign material that simply cannot be removed by a single phagocytic cell. The key feature in sarcoidosis is activated CD4 T cells which differentiate into type 1 helper T cells, secreting interleukin 2 and interferon \u03b3, augmenting macrophage tumour necrosis factor-\u03b1 and Strengths and limitations of this study \u25aa Although a number of prior studies have demonstrated the consistent presence of bacterial DNA (mostly atypical mycobacteria and Propionibacterium acnes) in sarcoidosis tissue, the current study is the first to correlate clinical outcomes with the presence of detectable bacterial DNA, suggesting the most promising candidates for treatment. \u25aa Nevertheless, the molecular approach to bacterial detection has distinct limitations including possible false-positive results secondary to contaminated PCR reagents, the paraffin embedding process or postembedding handling and processing of the paraffin block. Also, the mere physical presence of the bacterial DNA in the lymph nodes does not prove that the disease is caused by the microorganism. \u25aa In addition, the number of lymph nodes positive for bacterial DNA may be significantly underestimated because of the tendency of the formalinfixation and paraffin-embedding process to breakdown prokaryotic DNA.",

Since sarcoidosis primarily involves the lungs, eyes and skin, attention has focused on airborne environmental antigens that might trigger this presumed hypersensitivity response with its T cell-mediated cellular immune response. 3 Similar granulomatous responses can be seen from a variety of infectious agents including mycobacteria, parasites (schistosoma) and fungi (coccidiomycosis). Early studies reported associations with non-infective agents including beryllium, zirconium, aluminium, woodburning stoves, tree pollen, clay soil, talc, insecticides, inorganic particles and moldy environments, but none of these theoretical causes has endured. 3 5 6 There is also a several-fold increased incidence of sarcoidosis occurring in siblings and parents, as well as a consistent strong association with specific gene products such as class I and class II human leukocyte antigens, which may add to the familial connection.",

Inhibition was ruled out by checking the ability of exogenously added target DNA to be amplified in the same PCR mix that contained DNA extracted from clinical specimen. Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Bartonella henselae have been detected multiple times in the past using these PCR assays. 16S primers used were of broad range for all bacteria. hsp65 and rpoB were of broad range for Mycobacteria spp only. 16S PCR detected non-Mycobacterium spp DNA such as Propionibacterium acnes. Mycobacterium spp DNA were detected by hsp65 and/or rpoB primers. Primers used for amplification were also used for amplicon sequencing. The PCR amplicon was directly sequenced; no cloning was performed. Mixed infection was not detected in this set of specimens. For alignment, BLASTN was used. Identification was based on exact match on all cases. No sequence that could not be linked to a microbe was detected. P acnes was detected by 16S primers and Mycobacterium avium was detected by hsp65 primers. M avium was detected and identified by sequence analysis.",

Additionally identified were one skin and mucous membrane organism (Corynebacterium propinquum), and one aerobic Gram-negative bacillus (Duganella zoogloeoides) that is usually found in aqueous environments.

In addition, P acnes DNA was found in only 1 of 30 (3.3%) control lymph nodes in our study, in stark contrast to Ishige et al 18 in Japan who reported this microorganism as an ubiquitous pulmonary lymph node commensal found in 8 of 11 (72.7%) non-sarcoid patients in their study.

Numerous non-infective agents have been implicated based on epidemiological studies but none have stood up to scrutiny. 1 3 5 The focus over the past two decades has been on infective agents that might trigger sarcoidosis, with the strongest suspects found in the mycobacteria family and the common commensal P acnes. And like classical tuberculosis where up to 90% of people infected with M tuberculosis remain in remission without treatment, 20 sarcoidosis also has a 65-80% spontaneous remission rate without treatment. 1 One may speculate that similar to tuberculosis, the immune system, after its initial response to a triggering microorganism, is successful in eradicating the agent and the immune response subsides. Then in the 20% or so with persistent and progressive sarcoidosis, the organism remains viable and perpetuates the destructive immune response. Symptomatic sarcoidosis is usually treated with various anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive agents such as corticosteroids, methotrexate and TNF-inhibitors (biologics). 21 The similarities in immunological abnormalities and treatment to another debilitating granulomatous disease, Crohn's disease, are striking. 22 Granulomatous ileitis (Crohn's) has been suspected by many investigators to be the result of a chronic infection with the obligate intracellular microorganism M avium subspecies paratuberculosis (MAP) that is known to cause a granulomatous ileitis in cattle and other ruminants called Johne's disease. 23 Although the classical treatment of Crohn's disease has been with immunosuppressive agents just like with sarcoidosis, many recent studies suggest a much more effective treatment with less side effects may be a triple antibiotic regimen geared towards the putative triggering agent MAP. [24] [25] [26] In fact, many in the field suspect that this intracellular organism (MAP) that resides in the macrophage impairs the normal autophagy that would usually eradicate the organism. 24 Agents that enhance autophagy such as 16\u03b1-bromoepiandersterone, 27 28 currently in human trials, may prove effective along with antibiotics in Crohn's disease. 24 Can some antibacterial/antimycobacterial regimen such as that used in Crohn's disease alter the natural history of sarcoidosis in chronically symptomatic patients? Sixty years ago a number of small trials using classical antituberculous drugs (isoniazid, streptomycin or cortisone) were published with discouraging results. 29 However, atypical mycobacteria (rather than M tuberculosis) that are more likely to be one of the aetiological agents in sarcoidosis are almost all resistant to the standard antituberculosis agents such as isoniazid. [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] And if other organisms such as P acnes or perhaps cell-wall deficient (L-forms) bacteria trigger and perpetuate sarcoidosis in some individuals, then the standard antituberculous drugs would also be ineffective.",

Drake et al 38 just published positive results of the first randomised trial (NCT01074554) of an antimicrobial regimen (directed at atypical mycobacteria) in the USA using oral concomitant levofloxacin, ethambutol, azithromycin and rifampin (CLEAR) regimen to treat 30 patients with cutaneous sarcoidosis, with quite significant reductions in cutaneous lesion size.

Gupta is also the principal investigator in an ongoing clinical trial in India using more standard antituberculous therapy \"Rifampicin and Isoniazid Along With Prednisolone Compared to Prednisolone Alone in Treatment of Sarcoidosis: a Pilot Randomized Controlled Trial\" (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01245036). 40 The results of this trial in India with its high burden of tuberculosis will be available next year, though the drug regimen used may not be as effective in countries with a low tuberculosis burden. If indeed sarcoidosis arises from an abnormal immunological response to a microorganism(s), the patient's geographical location may dictate which microorganism is involved and what antimicrobial regimen will be most effective.",
