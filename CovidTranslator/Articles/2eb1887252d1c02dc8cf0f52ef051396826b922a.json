            "text": "The rows of viral particles between the microvilli of infected cells, and the viral particles present in apical pits, may represent either uptake or release of the virus. However, since their presence was often associated with heavy infection and morphologic alterations of the cell, it points to release rather than to uptake. Assembly of the virus seems to occur by budding through intracyeoplasmic membranes. Budding structures have been described in a number of coronaviral infections (1, 2, 13, 17, 19) , and are considered to be characteristic for members of the family Coronaviridae (20) . The frequency with which budding structures are observed seems to vary markedIy not only from one coronavirus to the other (I, 12), but, it also seems to depend on the host or eel1 type. This was very obvious in neonatal calf diarrhoea coronavirus (NCDCV) infection (2, 9) . In the present study, budding structures were very frequently seen in the one animal killed 96 hours after the first clinical signs appeared, whereas they were very rarely observed in the earlier phases of diarrhoea when larger numbers of intraeellular viral particles were present. The ultrastructure of the epithelial cells (DtTcAT:~LL]~ et al., to be published) and the time delay between inoculation and euthanasia in this one animal indicate that these cells are a second generation of epithelial cells since the infection first started. Immunoftuorescenee of the intestine of this animal has demonstrated that the cells are heavily infected (DEBOUCK et al., to be published), whereas histopatholog~eal study has shown very little desquamation (CovssE-3~E~-T et al., to be published). All this may indicate that the virus assembly occurs slower in this second generation of infected epithelial cells than in the first generation, so that it is more easily observed by electron microscopy. The presence of many viral particles in close apposition to intraeytoplasmic membranes of vacuoles, as described during the watery phase of diarrhoea, may indicate that these viral particles have just been passing through the process of budding. This also indicates that in the first generation of infected epithelial cells virus assembly is a rapid process. Structures resembling those called \"viral factories\" in NCDCV infection (10) have also been observed in cells infected with CVLA (Fig. 5) . It can, however, not be excluded that they merely represent particles which came into these vesicles by budding through the membrane.",

It has been suggested that they represent some form of virus assembly (6, 14) . The large, virus-containing intracytoplasmic vacuoles probably represent dilated cisternae of EPR (1). Since there exists a physiologic transport mechanism from the EPI~ to the Golgi apparatus (5), it is very possible that viral particles are transported to the Golgi cisternae, where they were frequently located. Golgi sacs have been reported as a site of morphogenesis of other coronaviruses (15, 19) . Constrictions seen at the ends of the Golgi sacs and in electron dense cytoplasmic vacuoles ( Fig. 6 and 8) suggest the pinchingoff of small vesicles containing one or two viral ]?articles. The numerous intravesicular particles seen in the cytoplasm of infected cells are probably produced in this way.",
