Severe CMV-induced liver injury is characterized histologically by small collections (microabscesses) of inflammatory cells (mainly neutrophils) throughout the hepatic lobule, often surrounding hepatocytes with nuclear and/or cytoplasmic inclusions, so-called \"owl's eye\" inclusions. 7. CMV is a common infection in patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and has been associated with papillary stenosis and sclerosing cholangitis (AIDS cholangiopathy) (see Chapter 27). 8. The diagnosis is made in the appropriate clinical context with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing or histologic evidence of infection. 9. Infection is usually defined as primary if the patient has no evidence of prior exposure (i.e., negative immunoglobulin [Ig]G anti-CMV) or recurrent if the patient has detectable IgG anti-CMV. 10. Treatment of CMV infection is not always indicated in immunocompetent patients, unless the infection is severe or life threatening. 11. Many immunocompromised patients at risk for CMV are routinely tested by a PCR assay or treated prophylactically with an antiviral agent. Treatment of viremia before the onset of symptoms is considered preemptive. 12. Drugs approved for the treatment of CMV infection include oral ganciclovir, valganciclovir, intravenous ganciclovir, intravenous foscarnet, and intravenous cidofovir. 13. Ganciclovir-resistant strains of CMV are emerging. 14. The choice and duration of treatment are dependent on the severity of disease and the immune status of the patient. Repeated assessments for CMV viremia should be made. 15. Organ transplantation recipients at risk of CMV reactivation usually receive 3 to 6 months of prophylactic therapy after transplantation.",

Half of the deaths from mononucleosis, while rare, are attributable to ALF. Less than 1% of all cases of ALF, however, are attributable to EBV. EBV-associated ALF carries with it a 25% transplant-free survival. 6. The monospot test, which detects heterophile antibodies, is sensitive but not specific. 7. Liver injury attributable to EBV mononucleosis can be diagnosed clinically by the combination of symptoms with consistent serology (IgM directed against the viral capsid antigens [IgM anti-EBV VCA]). 8. Definite severe EBV infection is confirmed by the combination of serologic evidence of virus (by a PCR assay) and evidence of EBV-associated hepatopathology on light microscopy (diffuse sinusoidal lymphocytic infiltration) with or without EBV-encoded RNA (EBER)-positive tissue staining. 9. Treatments with demonstrated efficacy in clinical trials are lacking. Acyclovir inhibits EBV in vitro and reduces viral shedding in the oropharynx but has little to no effect on symptoms. Ganciclovir use has been supported by a study of two children with EBV hepatitis.",

Up to 25% of children with primary varicella infection have elevated liver enzymes. There are a few reports of ALF attributable to VZV in patients with a confluence of vesicular rash, positive VZV by a PCR assay, and severe liver injury. Primary varicella infection in organ transplant recipients has been associated with ALF. Treatment is the same as for HSV: Intravenous acyclovir, 10 mg/kg three times a day for 7 to 10 days. 2. Adenovirus is a double-stranded DNA virus that is frequently implicated in upper respiratory tract and ocular infections. Confirmation of adenoviral hepatitis requires evidence of systemic infection (positive PCR assay, antigenemia, or viral blood culture) and liver biopsy specimens consistent with a viral infection-either stains for adenoviral antigens or diagnostic morphology (randomly scattered punched-out lesions, large nuclei with inclusions consisting of waxy-appearing dense material with unstained clear zones). Most reported cases have been in organ transplant recipients. Severe adenoviral hepatitis has a poor prognosis with a low rate of spontaneous recovery. Treatment may be attempted with cidofovir. 3. Influenza is an RNA virus associated with pandemic infections and a predominance of respiratory symptoms. Mild asymptomatic elevations of liver enzyme levels are common. However, influenza does not directly infect hepatocytes. Influenza infection induces the expansion of CD8+ T cells, which cause \"collateral damage\" to the liver while interacting with Kupffer cells. 4. Human herpesvirus 6 is a rare cause of liver injury, lymphadenopathy, and a nonspecific rash.",
