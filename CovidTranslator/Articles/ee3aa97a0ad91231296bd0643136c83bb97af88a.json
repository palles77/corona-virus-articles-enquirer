Unfortunately, most of the existing models are either too fine-grained to be efficient or too coarse-grained to be reliable. Here we propose a computationally efficient hybrid approach that uses SIR model for individual cities which are in turn coupled via empirical transportation networks that facilitate migration among them. The treatment presented here differs from existing models in two crucial ways: first, self-consistent determination of coupling parameters so as to maintain the populations of individual cities, and second, the incorporation of distance dependent temporal delays in migration. We apply our model to Indian aviation as well as railway networks taking into account populations of more than 300 cities. Our results project that through the domestic transportation, the significant population is poised to be exposed within 90 days of the onset of epidemic. Thus, serious supervision of domestic transport networks is warranted even after restricting international migration.",

This model distributes the total population into compartments for Susceptible, Infected and Recovered individuals, and a set of coupled differential equations describes the movement of population from one compartment to another. Although the model has been used extensively it fails to account for the demographic details and spatial heterogeneity. Several remedies have been proposed to overcome this limitation. For example, 'fully-mixed' assumption can be replaced with network of con-tacts between individuals 9,10 . In the last few days network based SIR-type models were also used to predict the spread of ongoing epidemic of COVID-19 coronavirus 11, 12 . Many studies have used the transmission dynamics of virus in metapopulation patches where the total population is subdivided into a number of discrete patches, each of which is treated as being well-mixed 13 . Bolker et al. 14 used such a model to demonstrate the effectiveness of vaccination against measles outbreak. Arino and van den Driessche 15,16 have proposed a model in which the population of a city is coupled with other cities via a mobility parameter that describes the net rate of intercity migration 16 . Lloyd and Jansen 17 also used metapopulation of n-patches to epidemics' dynamics to see the patterns of synchrony in outbreaks. A more involved model with cross-patch infection was investigated for various cases by Muroya et al. 18 , who looked at the global stability of an endemic.",

In this approach, disease dynamics inside individual cities are treated with SIR model that accounts for the intra-city mixing. On the other hand, intercity migration is modeled by spatially realistic networks of airports and train stations. Put differently, the \"fully-mixed\" approximation is assumed to be valid inside cities but not between the cities. Another notable feature of the scheme proposed here is the introduction of distancedependent delay inherent in the transportation. Additionally, the model is also capable of simultaneously handling cities with different populations. This is achieved by scaling the product terms inside the SIR equations by respective populations as discussed in the next section. As an application to ongoing COVID-19 outbreak, we run our model on aviation and rail networks of India where links connect multiple cities of varying population sizes.",

Fig. 1 shows the time series of infected population of several cities for D = 0.01. We note several key features of these time series. First, as a result of our modification of the SIR model that allows us to handle heterogeneous population sizes, the values of the maxima are proportional to the populations of the corresponding cities. Second, because \u03b2 and \u03b3 are same for all the cities, bigger cities take longer to achieve their maxima. Also, for both the networks, most of the maxima occur in close proximity with each other implying the necessity of the preparedness against simultaneous large-scale outbreaks. Since the train network includes delay, the maxima tend to occur much later relative to that of Delhi. Because the train transport is the dominant means of transport in India, this shift of the peaks is more relevant for the response against coronavirus.",

Thus, to check its effect on the epidemic, we vary it and observe the behaviour of the time t max at which the infection maximum occurs for each city. The results are shown in Fig 4 with initial infection only at Delhi. D = 0 corresponds to quarantining Delhi from the rest of the nodes, and hence only Delhi has finite t max while for others t max is undefined. For D > 0, infection spreads to other nodes, and understandably very small values of D result in very large values of t max . Upon increasing D, the value of t max decreases rapidly as more fraction of individuals migrate among the cities. Interestingly, for each node except the initially infected one, there exists a critical value of D at which this trend reverses and t max starts increasing again. We can understand this unexpected behaviour with the following argument. When D is very high, it is analogous to having all the population wellmixed. As a result, too many infected individuals migrate from node to node to infect any one node effectively. In other words, too few infected individuals remain in any given city compared to low D. As a result, even the initially infected node takes long time to get maximally infected, and peaks for all the cities appear simultaneously.",

Here we have proposed a novel approach that addresses both these issues, and offers fast and realistic predictions that are useful for policy-makers and health personnels. Our hybrid approach to SIR model with well-mixed intra-city populations and intercity coupling based on transportation network lets us predict the course of ongoing pandemic of COVID19 coronavirus in India. The forecasts based on our model indicate that within 90 days of the start of the epidemic, All rights reserved.

Our work also shows that because of the contagious nature of the COVID19 and the crucial role of the domestic transportation networks, even a small infected population is sufficient to sustain and spread the pandemic. Thus, along with restricting international links, it is equally important to monitor the domestic transportation.",
