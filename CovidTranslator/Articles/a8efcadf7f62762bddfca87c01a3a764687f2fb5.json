The virus caused cytopathic effect (CPE) in C6/36 cells and passaged stably. Polyacrylamide gel analysis showed that the genome of YN12243 was composed of 12 segments of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), with a distribution pattern of 6-6. The nucleotide and amino acid sequences of the coding region (1-12 segments) were 17,803 bp and 5,925 amino acids in length, respectively. The phylogenetic analysis of VP1 protein (RdRp) revealed that YN12243 belonged to genus Seadornavirus of family Reoviridae, and further analysis indicated that YN12243 belongs to the Banna virus (BAV) genotype A2. Additionally, YN12243 was located in the same evolutionary cluster as BAV strains isolated from different mosquito species, suggesting that the BAV isolated from Culicoides does not have species barriers. These results indicate that Culicoides can also be a vector for BAV. In view of the hematophagous habits of Culicoides on cattle, horses, deer, and other large animals, as well as the possibility of spreading and causing a variety of animal arboviral diseases, it is important to improve infection detection and monitor the BAV in large livestock.",

Since then, BAV has been isolated from various mosquito specimens (Liu et al., 2010) , suggesting that mosquitoes are the natural vector for BAV. To date, BAV has been isolated from mosquito specimens collected in Indonesia (Brown et al., 1993) , Vietnam (Nabeshima et al., 2008) , South Korea (Kim et al., 2016) , as well as from many subtropical or temperate provinces of China (Gansu, Shanxi, Inner Mongolia, Liaoning, Beijing, and Yunnan) (Liu et al., 2010a; Liu et al., 2010b; Liu et al., 2011) . Moreover, it was recently reported that BAV has been isolated in Hungary, which is in the northern, more temperate zone of Europe (Reuter et al., 2013) . Because BAV has been isolated from a patient, and can be carried or transmitted by a variety of hematophagic vectors and vertebrates, it is considered as a \"newly discovered virus\" with considerable public health significance (Liu et al., 2010a; Attoui et al., 2005a) .",

The group contains three members: BAV, Liaoning virus (LNV), and Kadipiro virus (KDV). Among them, BAV can be taken as the representative virus of the group (Attoui et al., 2005b; Mohd Jaafar et al., 2005) . The BAV genome is composed of 12 segments of dsRNA. Virus RNA can be isolated into 1-12 bands with different molecular weights on polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE). BAV segment 1 encodes the virus RNAdependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). The VP1 is a highly conserved and an important marker for species identification within the family Reoviridae. Segment 2 encodes the T2 protein, forming the innermost nucleus layer. The segment 12 is conserved and abundant sequences of it can be used to analyze (39 sequences registered in GenBank). Besides, the length of segment 12 is relatively short (670 bp), which makes it easy to obtain a full length sequence by PCR. Due to these factors mentioned above, segment 12 is commonly used for identification and evolutionary analysis of BAV (Attoui et al., 2005b; Mohd Jaafar et al., 2005) .",

The table involves the genome of the virus strains SC043 (GenBank accession number KC954611 to KC954622), 02VN078b (GenBank accession number EU265695 to EU265705, EU312980), 02VN018b (GenBank accession number EU265683 to EU265694), JKT-6423 (GenBank accession number NC_004211, NC_004217 to NC_004221, AF019908, AF052014 to AF052018) and QTM104536 (KX884638 to KX884639). ary analyses of the BAV genome isolated from Culicoides (YN12243) and other mosquito samples were performed for the first time. It was found that the virus was an A2 genotype BAV. Furthermore, the genome sequence of the BAV isolated from Culicoides (SC043), which was previously registered in GenBank, was in the same evolutionary branch as the BAVs isolated from various mosquitoes. The YN12243 and SC043 viruses which belonged to A2 genotype BAV constituted a cluster based on their evolutionary characteristics ( Figure 4B ). However, The YN12243 and SC043 viruses were located in the different branch on the phylogenetic tree. Whether a species barrier between Culicoides and various mosquitoes existed is difficult to determine at this stage. More samplings of BAV from Culicoides and in vivo experiments are needed. The BAV genome found in Odonata not only had different nucleotide and amino acid sequence lengths from those of the strains isolated form Culicoides and mosquitoes (Table 2) , but also had different molecular genetic evolution characteristics that were intermediate between those of the Culicoides and mosquito viruses. QTM104536 occupies an independent evolutionary branch between BAVs and Banna-like viruses. Whether these results indicate that BAV isolated from Odonata is a new type of BAV or a unique genus needs further study.",

Moreover, the YN12243 isolated from Culicoides has the same nucleotide and amino acid sequence lengths as the BAVs isolated from mosquitoes, and closer nucleotide and amino acid homology (Table 2 ). However, we were only able to obtain 50% of the amplified products of YN12243 using the whole genome amplification primers published for BAVs isolated from mosquitoes (Liu et al., 2016a) , suggesting that while the nucleotide length is the same but the sequence length differs. Additionally, PAGE results showed that the distance between the segments 5 and 6 of YN12243 was significantly greater than that for mosquito isolates ( Figure  2) , and the distance from segments 7 and 8 to segment 9 for YN12243 was shorter than that for HB35 isolated from mosquitoes; this indicates that compared with the mosquito isolates, the Culicoides isolate not only has a difference in terms of genomic nucleotide sequence conservation, but also a different secondary or tertiary genomic structure.",

Subsequent monitoring showed that serum samples of suspected Japanese encephalitisor viral encephalitis cases collected from hospitals were BAV immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibody-positive at a rate of 11.4% (130/1141) (Tao and Chen, 2005) . Another study showed that of 63 serum samples of patients diagnosed with viral encephalitis in the acute phase, 11 cases were positive for BAV IgM antibody and 37 cases were positive for Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) IgM antibody; seven patients were simultaneously positive for both of the IgM antibodies (Yang et al., 1996) . These findings further suggest that BAV may be associated with infection in patients with viral encephalitis. Recently, a microneutralization test was used to detect BAV-neutralizing antibody in 200 bovine serum samples and 535 pig serum samples collected from Yunnan Province, which was the initial BAV discovery site (Kou et al., 2016) . The results showed that 10 pig serum samples were positive for BAV-neutralizing antibody, with antibody titers of 1:20-1:320, and 1 bovine serum sample was positive (with an antibody titer of 1:160). This was the first time that neutralization test methods were used to test animal serum samples for BAV-neutralizing antibodies (Kou et al., 2016) . The results suggest that BAV not only affects humans, but can also infect pigs and cattle. Previous studies involving surveillance of insect-borne viruses in the Sino-Burmese border area over a period of more than 10 years suggested that BAV was only isolated from mosquito specimens (Wang et al., 2011; Sun et al., 2009) and not from Culicoides, it was thought that Culicoides might not carry BAV. However, BAV was isolated from Culicoides in the present study, suggesting the possibility that Culicoides carry BAV. However, whether the ability of Culicoides to carry BAV is innate, or represents a new cross-transfer ability, needs further research.",

The results also suggested that although BAV is widely distributed in the tropics, it has evolved such that it can now survive not only in different regions of the tropics, but also in temperate regions and at higher latitudes (Liu et al., 2016b) . The isolation of BAV from Culicoides indicates that Culicoides can be a vector for BAV, thereby expanding the vector range of BAV. Culicoides are blood-sucking insects distributed widely in temperate regions that have hematophagous feeding habits (on cattle, horses, deer, and other large animals). In addition, they can spread various insect-borne viruses, such as blue tongue virus and hemorrhagic fever virus, which caused an epidemic in deer. Thus, it is of great importance to improve the detection and monitoring of animal diseases caused by the spread of BAVs by Culicoides.",

BioEdit (ver. 7.0.5.3; http://www.mbio.ncsu.edu/BioEdit/bioedit.html) was used for multiple sequence alignment. The MEGA 6.0 was used to perform a system evolution analysis, based on the neighbor-joining (NJ) method and with the bootstrap value set to 1,000 .
