The affected pigs had antibody against porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV). The predominant lung lesions were severe proliferative and interstitial pneumonia, and slight suppurative bronchopneumonia. The lesions were closely associated with the sites at which PRRSV and Mycoplasma hyorhinis antigens were detected. Four of five pigs inoculated with PRRSV developed slight pneumonitis. The fifth animal, which died of severe pneumonitis, yielded a heavy culture of M. hyorhinis. These findings demonstrate that dual infection with M. hyorhinis and PRRSV caused severe pulmonary lesions.",

            "text": "In the field, clinical signs of PRRS vary considerably. After investigating the clinical signs of 3612 sows in 16 herds, De Jong et al. (1991) reported that 50% of the pigs had anorexia, up to 10% had fever, and up to 30% had respiratory distress: Sh~mizu et al. (1994) also pointed out that PRRSV-infected pigs showed abdominal breathing at the late stage of the disease. In the present study, 11 field cases with severe dyspnoea or abdominal breathing had pneumonic lesions throughout the lungs and antibody against PRRSV. Clinically and virologically, they resembled pigs in previously reported outbreaks of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome. Pathologically, the predominant lung lesion in the field cases was moderate to severe proliferative and interstitial pneumonia, with slight suppurative bronchopneumonia. The lesion was composed of interstitial infiltration of mononuclear cells, accumulations of macrophages and cell debris in the alveolar spaces. A large amount of PRRSV antigen was detected in the cytoplasm of macrophages and in cell debris in the lesions. M. hyorhinis was also found on the surface of broncho-alveolar epithelial cells and degenerated neutrophils. The bacteria were closely associated with the pneumonic lesions. The pathological changes in four of five pigs experimentally infected with PRRSV resembled those described by investigators in Canada (Dea et al., 1992) and the USA (Yoon et al., 1992; Rossow et al., 1994) . These infected pigs were kept in isolation houses, but one of them died 22 days after inoculation with virus. At necropsy it had severe pneumonitis and a heavy culture ofM. hyorhinis was isolated from the lung lesion, together with PRRSV. The pathological findings in the pig that died, including the detection of PRRSV and M. hyorhinis antigens, were almost the same as those in the 11 field cases. Therefore, if there had been no enhancement of M. hyorhinis proliferation in the lung of experimental pig no. 5, the pneumonitis caused by PRRSV infection might have resolved, as in the other four experimentally infected pigs.",

Experimentally, some strains of M. hyorhinis produced slight bronchopneumonia or interstitial pneumonia in gnotobiotic pigs (Friis, 1971 ; Gois et al., 1971 ) and specific fluorescence for M. hyorhinis antigen was detected on the bronchial epithelium by indirect fluorescent-antibody staining (Gois et al., 1971 ).
