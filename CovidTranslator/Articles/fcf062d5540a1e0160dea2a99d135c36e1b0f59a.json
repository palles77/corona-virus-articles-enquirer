To understand this puzzle-like phenomenon, we surveyed 220 residents in a lead-zinc mining area located in Fenghuang County of China. We found that: 1) The degree of risk perception of villagers living around the mining site correlated inversely with their degree of involvement in mining risk. We refer to this as the ''involvement'' version of the psychological typhoon eye effect. 2) Perceived benefit and perceived harm provided a satisfactory explanation for this ''involvement'' version of the psychological typhoon eye effect. 3) Risk perception was negatively related to support for the relevant policy which we viewed as constituting a sort of voting behavior. The results may have implications for better understanding how benefited individuals respond to environmental health risks.",

Lead-zinc mining and smelting activities are, however, some of the primary sources of heavy metals pollution (Horvath & Gruiz, 1996; Tong, Schirnding, & Prapamontol, 2000) . Lead exposure, which can cause increased blood-lead levels and affect many tissues and systems in the body, was responsible for about 143,000 deaths and 0.6% of the global burden of disease in 2004 and can seriously endanger human health (WHO, 2004 (WHO, , 2009 .

Such a puzzle-like phenomenon has been so robust that local villagers tend to continue to practice unprotected mining regardless of any legal prohibitions (Y. Li, Wang, Yang, & Li, 2005) . For example, the situation in the Dabaoshan heavy metal mining areas has frustrated the public at large because local private mining still exists, even after being shut down by the government several times from 1993 to 2005. Such unprotected mining has caused at least 250 deaths from cancer in the last 20 years (M. Wang et al., 2011) . This continued private mining by local individuals can be seen as an evidence of being likely to 'sail close to the wind' with respect to environmental issues. The problem raised in this study is how to understand such a puzzle-like phenomenon from the perspective of risk perception and risk analysis.",

Wise (2009) described a compelling example of the disjuncture between fear and danger: Londoners who were subjected to German bombings regularly during the Blitz in World War II eventually grew blas e, while those in the suburbs became more fearful. Guedeney and Mendel (1973) reported that, in a local attitude survey about a nuclear power station in France, anxiety was lower among those living closer to the nuclear reactor. Maderthaner, Guttmann, Swaton, and Otway (1978) also found that people living far from a nuclear research reactor perceived it to be riskier than the nearer residents. Tilt (2006) reported that, although industrial workers labored on a daily basis under highly polluted conditions, they provided risk ratings that were well below those of farmers and commercial/service sector workers who were far from the polluting sources.",

In fact, this phenomenon can be demonstrated in many contexts. In the context of terrorist attacks, a post-9/11 study of New York City public school children showed that children from the schools nearest to Ground Zero had significantly less psychopathology than children from more remote schools (Hoven et al., 2005) . In the context of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), it was reported that the level of exposure to SARS was not a primary determinant of experienced anxiety; nearness to the center of the epidemic was negatively related to anxiety levels (Xie, Stone, Zheng, & Zhang, 2011) . Also in the context of earthquake, it was reported that a village closer to the epicenter of the earthquake (0.5 km) that occurred in 1998 in northern Hebei province, China, had considerably fewer cases of PTSD than one that was further away (10 km) from the epicenter (X. Wang et al., 2000) . A similar study by J. Xie, Xie, and Gan (2011) showed that the perceived risk of experiencing an aftershock by residents of devastated cities (e.g., Hanwang, Panzhihua) was lower than the perceived risk of aftershocks in the devastated area by people in a non-devastated city (e.g., Beijing). All these studies assessed the relationship between a disaster and a social cognitive reaction as a function of geometric distance. As Harada (2011) pointed out in a special issue on \"Cognitive Studies in the Real World\" in Psychologia, \"The results are especially insightful for Japanese readers after the Great East Japan Earthquake of 2011.\" (Harada, 2011) .",

            "text": "Despite the fact that similar, interesting findings have appeared in many studies, the mechanism of the psychological typhoon eye effect is unclear. Attempts have been made to identify possible/ alternative explanations. For instance, the psychological immunization theory assumes that resistance to adverse life events is naturally acquired through repeated exposure (Henderson, Montgomery, & Williams, 1972) . Residents in devastated quake areas are presumed to be provided with an increased psychological immunity to the severe disaster by their natural exposure to hazardous stimuli. Some previous researchers (e.g. Li, Rao, et al., 2009; Maderthaner et al., 1978) viewed the psychological immunization theory as a possible explanation and mentioned it in their discussion. To test whether the psychological immunization theory could account for the psychological typhoon eye effect, Li et al. (2010) asked respondents to indicate the extent and frequency of their personal exposure to the earthquake damage, using a six-point scale (from ''not at all'' to ''extremely strong'' for the extent and from \"never'' to ''always'' for the frequency). The covariance analysis in Li et al.'s (2010) study revealed that the psychological typhoon eye effect was independent of the extent of exposure to hazardous stimuli. This result suggested that the psychological immunization theory is insufficient to account for the psychological typhoon eye effect. The residents did not receive increased psychological immunity to the severe disaster by personal exposure to hazardous stimuli. Before we can accept the conclusion that the residents had not received such increased psychological immunity, however, the distinctions between exposure to hazardous stimuli and people's subjective perceptions of the same stimulus (Brewer & Hallman, 2006; Howarth, 1988) should be taken into account.",

As remarked in a blog by Gray (2010) , the devastation of an area creates a sense of danger, yet an individual may have no choice but to remain close by, counter to their survival instinct. To reconcile these conflicting beliefs, the individual may unconsciously lower their self-assessed risk to justify remaining in the area. However, the cognitive dissonance account has not yet been directly tested, mainly because it is difficult to manipulate the levels of cognitive dissonance in a field study. Because the level of cognitive dissonance cannot be measured and manipulated in the center of the lead-zinc mining risk area, we decided not to test the cognitive dissonance account in the present study.",

            "text": "Alternatively, a so called \"perceived benefit\" account has been proposed by several investigators. X. Wang et al. (2000) proposed a possible explanation of why the villagers closer to the epicenter had a considerably lower level of PTSD. They proposed that this was because the closer village was allotted considerably greater immediate disaster relief and subsequent reconstruction support because they had been assessed by government relief authorities as having suffered greater damage. These resources in turn appeared to have helped buffer members of the village from developing chronic PTSD reactions (Wang et al., 2000) . Tilt's (2006) study on risk perception from industrial pollution proposed that the reason the risk rating provided by industrial workers was lower than that provided by farmers and commercial/service sector workers was that the industrial workers could earn more monthly income than the others could. The perceived benefit account is also consistent with the health belief model (Janz & Becker, 1984) and protection motivation theory (Floyd, PrenticeeDunn, & Rogers, 2000; Rogers, Cacioppo, & Petty, 1983) , which were originally proposed to predict behavior in the context of personal health threats. Janz and Becker (1984) found that a kind of cost-benefit analysis occurred wherein an individual weighs the healthy action's effectiveness against perceptions that it may be unpleasant or time-consuming. The severity and vulnerability assessments are reduced by perceived intrinsic and extrinsic rewards from the unhealthy behavior (Rogers et al., 1983) . Bockarjova and Steg (2014) first applied protection motivation theory to slow-onset environmental risk and found that higher perceived rewards associated with a conventional vehicle negatively affected adoption of electric vehicles. Because the perceived benefit account is reasonable but lacks abundant empirical evidence in environmental studies, the second aim of the present study was to empirically test whether the perceived benefit account can explain an involvement version, that is, that involvement in risky mining decreases risk perception, of the psychological typhoon eye effect. If the perceived benefit account is correct, we should observe a negative relationship between the perceived benefit and risk perception. Because risk perception can be taken to be a function of perceived benefit and perceived harm (Holtgrave & Weber, 1993) , we further hypothesized that both perceived benefit and perceived harm might be correlated with risk perception by the villagers.",

As an example of panic behavior, when the Fukushima incident happened after the Tohoku Earthquake on March 11, 2011, it was not the nearby Japanese but the Chinese who lived far away from Fukushima who engaged in panic buying of salt, causing supermarkets in some major cities to run out (Setiogi, 2011) . Likewise, drug stores in Russia and British Columbia, Canada (but not Japan), reported shortages of iodine pills, in spite of health officials insisting that potassium iodide is not an antiradiation drug (Chen, Shen, Ye, Chen, & Kerr, 2013) . A very relevant case was reported in a news article entitled \"A survey showed that opponents of Jiangmen nuclear fuel project were not local residents but entrepreneurs from neighboring cities\" (\u8c03\u67e5\u79f0\u6c5f\u95e8\u53cd \u6838\u8005\u591a\u975e\u5f53\u5730\u666e\u901a\u7fa4\u4f17 \u5468\u8fb9\u57ce\u5e02\u4f01\u4e1a\u5bb6\u6210\u6025\u5148\u950b) (Observer, 2013). According to this report, the Jiangmen nuclear fuel project in China, which was valued at 40 billion CNY, was forced to be cancelled because of fierce opposition, not from residents of the central area (i.e., Jiangmen) but from residents of peripheral areas (that is, those are about 50e100 km distance from Jiangmen; such as Zhongshan, Guangzhou and Foshan). This project met the same fate as paraxylene (PX) producing projects in China. Since 2007, the PX projects planned in Xiamen, Dalian, and Kunming were shut down because of public fears about possible environmental pollution. This sort of policy \"voting\" behavior is not isolated to Chinese. The German government (rather than the Japanese government) was compelled to reevaluate nuclear power and, in a spectacular policy U-turn, made a decision to terminate nuclear power in Germany by 2022 because of opposition and demonstrations by German voters (Opinion polls show that 80% of Germans no longer accept nuclear power.) (Batsford, 2013) . Nevertheless, whether these media reports were accurate is unclear due to a lack of scientific evidence.",

Because we explored the antecedents and consequences of risk perception at the same time in the former hypotheses, this third hypothesis implied that risk perception has a mediating role between perceived benefit/harm and support for a relevant policy.",

Province, China. The administrative village consists of four historical villages with 346 local families, lodged within steep hills and roughly 40 km from the nearest county town. Mining activities in the area go back to the Qing Dynasty (1644e1912). Since 1994, the local villagers have had governmental permission to exploit the mines. At the time of an earlier survey, the state-owned or collective-owned mine enterprises had already officially been closed down to protect the environment (Lora-Wainwright, 2013). However, many private mines still operate in the village. The geographical distribution of the villages and mines are shown in Fig. 2 , which clearly shows that the lead-zinc mines and villages are mixed within this area. Environmental geography studies found that the concentrations of lead (Pb) in the soil were much higher than Level 2 of the National Environmental Quality Standard for Soils in China (GB15618-1995), i.e., the level suitable for the soil of arable land, and that the lead levels in the blood of local residents and crops were above national safety levels in the \"Feng\" administrative villages.

We utilized the psychometric paradigm (Fischhoff, Slovic, Lichtenstein, Read, & Combs, 1978; Slovic, 1987) as a research framework to measure risk perception about a leadzinc mine. Three items for measuring risk perception about a lead-zinc mine were adapted from previous studies (Fischhoff et al., 1978; Xie, Stone, Zheng, & Zhang, 2011) . The respondents were asked if they thought the pollution caused by the lead-zinc mine was serious, dreadful, and uncontrollable. For the measurement of the other constructs, new items related to lead-zinc mining were formulated according to the actual situation and interviews in the \"Feng\" village. To prepare for the benefit and harm measures, we interviewed 12 local villagers, three medical geographers who had previously carried out heavy metal pollution research in Feng village, and two staff members from the local Center for Disease Control (CDC). The questionnaire we developed was based on the first-hand information they provided. Four items were used to measure perceived benefit and eight items were used to measure perceived harm (see Table 3 ). Items were recoded so that higher values expressed a better perception of lead-zinc mining and lower values expressed a worse perception of lead-zinc mining. Another variable was \"support for the relevant policy\", which was intended to measure the villagers' voting intention. The items for measuring the support for a relevant policy were adapted from a study by Tanaka (2004) . Our study obtained this information by asking questions about whether the participants or other villagers favored lead-zinc mining in the village. The questions were answered on a 5-point scale (see Table 3 ).",

One-factor and four-factor models were performed to test which model provided the best fit for the data (Anderson & Gerbing, 1988) . The hypothesized four-factor model yielded a better fit than the single-factor model (see Table 4 ) with a change in the chi-square of 275.98 (Ddf \u00bc 10, p < 0.001). Second, all variables in the study had an acceptable Cronbach's a value greater than 0.6 and were considered reliable (Hair, Anderson, Tatham, & Black, 1998) .

The scores for their risk perception (see Fig. 3 ) from highest to lowest were: villager not involved in mining, family member of mine owner/worker, mine worker, and mine owner. Fisher's least significant difference (LSD) post hoc test further revealed that the 'villager not involved in mining' group reported the highest risk perception, significantly higher than the ratings given by mine owners and mine worker (ps < 0.05). No significant difference was observed between the rated risk perceptions of the latter two groups (p > 0.05). The rated risk perception of the 'family members of mine owner/worker' group was the second highest, but, similarly, no significant difference was found between their rated risk perceptions and those of the other three groups (ps > 0.05). These results showed that the risk perception of villagers living around the mine significantly increased with a decrease in their involvement in mining risk. The hypothesized ''involvement'' version of the psychological typhoon eye effect was thus observed in the present study. The hypothesized model (see Fig. 1 ) was tested using the structural equation model (SEM) with AMOS 18 and examined with the following goodness-of-fit indices: chi-square (c 2 ), c 2 /df, goodness-of-fit index (GFI), comparative fit index (CFI), Tuck-ereLewis Index (TLI), and root-mean-square error of approximation (RMSEA). There is a limitation to the chi-square test in that the c 2 is highly sensitive to sample size, especially if the number of participants is greater than 200. An alternate statistic examines the ratio of c 2 to the df for the model (Hoe, 2008; Joreskog & Sorbom, 1986) . Kline (1998) suggested that a c 2 /df ratio of 3 or less is a reasonably good indicator of model fit. The GFI, CFI, and TLI should be greater than 0.90 to indicate an acceptable model fit. A value of 0.08 or less for RMSEA would suggest a close fit of the model in relation to the degrees of freedom.",

A model is said to be nested within another model when the set of freely estimated parameters of the first model is a subset of those estimated in the second model (Anderson & Gerbing, 1988) . First, the hypothesized model was estimated to determine whether it fit the data. The model provided an acceptable fit (see Table 6 ) to the data. Although the c 2 was significant, the c 2 /df ratio was less than 3. All of the standardized path coefficients for the hypothesized model yielded significant coefficients (ps < 0.001) in the appropriate direction. In accordance with recommendations from methodological experts (Anderson & Gerbing, 1988) , we tested an alternative model to compare with the hypothesized model. Because previous studies (Siegrist, Earle, & Gutscher, 2003; Tanaka, 2004) found that perceived benefit and perceived harm (Bower & Miller, 1960; Holtgrave & Weber, 1993) had an impact on behavioral tendencies such as support for the relevant policy, we estimated an alternative model to test whether the addition of paths from perceived benefit to support for the relevant policy and from perceived harm to support for the relevant policy would result in a significant improvement over the hypothesized model. If the addition of the paths significantly improved the model fit, this would indicate that the paths should be included in the model. The result showed that the standardized path estimate from perceived benefit to support for the relevant policy was significant, but from perceived harm to support for the relevant policy was not significant (b \u00bc 0.11, p > 0.05), so this insignificant path was deleted from further analyses. Thus, the alternative model was a better fit to the data (see Table 6 ). Similar to the result from the hypothesized model, although the c 2 was significant, the c 2 /df ratio was also less than 3 in the alternative model.",

The score of the risk perception from highest to lowest was: villager not involved in mining, family member of mine owner/worker, mine worker, and mine owner. We dubbed it the ''involvement'' version of the psychological typhoon eye effect in the lead-zinc mining area. That is, the more involved in lead-zinc mining the villagers were, the less they were concerned about the pollution risk from lead-zinc mining. This finding extends our understanding of the psychological typhoon eye effect. Unlike the fundamental effect, where the concern about safety and health was a function of geometric distance, the concern about safety and health reported in the present variation is a function of involvement distance, even though the geometric distance remained constant. In this type of case, in which the geometric distance remained unchanged (see map in Fig. 2) , the cognitive dissonance account is unlikely to work and cannot be tested because of a lack of \"objective dissonance\". This is because all our participants shared the same degree of cognitive dissonance e there is a pollution risk from lead-zinc mining and they continue to live nearby and, therefore, would be expected to want to restore consistency or consonance. However, it could be argued that dissonance is a subjectively experienced phenomenon. In this sense, differences in psychological distance caused by involvement might lead to subjectively experienced cognitive dissonance. Future studies are needed to test whether subjectively experienced cognitive dissonance could account for the psychological typhoon eye effect.",

An awareness of the discrepancy between people who were involved more and those who were involved less in mining may enhance decisions in situations in which there are environmental health threats and may also enrich our understanding of how people can become resilient to different kinds of threats. The psychological typhoon eye effect has previously been detected and reported in three categories of risk (see Table 1 , acute humancaused risk, acute nature-caused risk, and chronic human-caused risk). Although researchers have found the psychological typhoon eye effect in its original version in chronic human-caused risks, such as nuclear power stations, a variation termed the ''involvement'' version was first explored within this category of risk. It is worth exploring whether other variations of the psychological typhoon eye effect can be applied in this risk category. Furthermore, to the best of our knowledge, the psychological typhoon eye effect has not been reported in chronic nature-caused risk (see the bottom left cell of Table 1 ). It would be interesting to explore in future studies whether the psychological typhoon eye effect exists in chronic nature-caused risk.",

Previous studies showed that people overestimate the intensity of their reactions to an imagined event. Gilbert, Morewedge, Risen, and Wilson (2004) measured people's anticipations and experiences of regret and self-blame and found that people are less susceptible to regret in real situations than they are when they imagine events. Wilson, Wheatley, Kurtz, Dunn, and Gilbert (2004) found that people predicted that losing would make them feel worse than it did and selected a higher dose of a drug (hypothetical medication) to cope with an anticipated loss than did people who actually lost. Likewise, some studies found evidence that was consistent with the idea that rare events seem to be given more weight when imagined (e.g. by reading the descriptive information) than when experienced (Hertwig & Erev, 2009; Rakow & Newell, 2010) . However, a gap between experiencing and imagining is not the case in our study. The villagers under investigation all lived in the lead-zinc risk area, and the risks they perceived were not imagined but truly experienced. Future study is needed to test whether this gap between experiencing and imagining could account for the psychological typhoon eye effect.",

            "text": "Furthermore, some other potential factors of the effect need to be considered in the future. Researchers (Jang, 2005; Jang & Lamendola, 2006) found that the Hakka spirit seemed to cause the Hakka people to accept that what had occurred had acted as a catalyst for future-orientated action and reduced stress after the 921 earthquake in Taiwan. These results suggested that cultural differences exist that may be important in investigating the psychological typhoon eye effect. Moreover, previous studies indicated that high levels of hazard-related anxiety could trigger avoidance and denial (Cameron & Leventhal, 2003) and thus further reduce the likelihood that people would prepare (Paton, Smith, & Johnston, 2005) . In future studies, it would be interesting to distinguish between the responses to anxiety by different groups and to explore whether hazard-related anxiety can lead to the psychological typhoon eye effect. The observed relationship between risk perception and support for the relevant policy are in accord with common-sense expectations that the more risk the villagers perceived, the less their support for the lead-zinc mining preferred policy. Nonetheless, the important thing is that risk perception was distorted in this particular situation in a way described by the psychological typhoon eye effect. The distorted risk perception consequently influenced the observed support for the relevant policy. The 'support for the relevant policy' measured in the present study is a sort of \"voting\" behavior. Voting plays an important role in the functioning of modern society (Elkind & Faliszewski, 2010) . Policy voting is at the heart of the electoral connection between popular preferences and elite decisions (Schoen, 2008) . There has been increased interest in involving the public in decisions regarding science and technology policies, such as issues concerning the management of environmental and health risks (Rowe & Frewer, 2000) . Therefore, the present study on the impact of risk perception on 'support for the relevant policy' is of practical significance. The knowledge of how risk perception influences support for the relevant policy can help us to understand the cognitive process underlying policy voting, thereby provide a psychology-based theoretical foundation for facilitating people's foresight and green awareness.",

Another limitation of the current study is that some measures of risk perception were ambiguous. For example, different respondents may have had different interpretations of \"negative effects caused by pollution.\" Future studies should include a manipulation check to ensure that the items used are not ambiguous, or future studies should develop new items that are clearer.",

The villagers' low perception of risk as well as their pro-voting in many cases can be considered to be a \"distorted\" action because the voters may be subject to economic temptation (such as the instant gain from mining). With this in mind, the agents of risk analysis and policymaking should be aware of the unique role that interest groups (such as mine owners) play in shaping policy choices. Apart from the involvement of an interest group, risk communication and risk management is understandable and people's responses are predictable. Once an interest group becomes involved in practicing, planning, or managing risk, the perceived risk as well as the interest-group's pro-voting becomes distorted, as revealed in the present study. Therefore, policy makers and managers involved in risk management should think twice about the desires of different interest groups before they act.",

The first strategy is to mention the \"obvious\" cost of lead-mining risk. A potential intervention for people who are under direct threat (e.g., lead-zinc mine owners and mine workers) could be to manipulate the way the opportunity cost (or harm) is framed. As suggested by recent framing studies (Magen, Dweck, & Gross, 2008; Zhao et al., 2015) , mentioning the \"obvious\" opportunity cost of alternatives may help decision makers choose in a more informed manner. That is, the explicitness of the opportunity cost in each alternative can influence the impulsive choice of the decision maker -the same option (mining activity) which is seen as a gain/reward in one frame (hidden frame) can be seen as a loss/cost in another frame (explicit frame). The second strategy could be to provide opportunities to make money from occupations other than lead-zinc mining. Considering the economic temptation (Janz & Becker, 1984) , offering new options for making a living (such as planting cash crops) might reduce the attractiveness of lead-zinc mining.",
