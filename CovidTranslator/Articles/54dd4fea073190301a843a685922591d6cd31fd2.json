With a view to facilitating the development of such compounds, crystals were obtained of the enzyme at pH 6.5 in the orthorhombic space group P2 1 2 1 2 that diffract to a resolution of 1.9 \u00c5 . These crystals contain one monomer per asymmetric unit and the biologically active dimer is generated via the crystallographic twofold axis.

            "text": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a severe form of pneumonia. Its transmission pattern, high mortality rate and possible re-emergence in the future make SARS a serious threat for which neither efficient therapy nor vaccine is currently available. The disease is caused by a member of the coronavirus family: the SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV; Fouchier et al., 2003) . Following viral entry into cells, two polyproteins named pp1a and pp1ab, with molecular weights of 486 and 790 kDa, respectively, are synthesized (Rota et al., 2003) . During the viral life cycle, pp1a and pp1ab are processed into 15 putative non-structural proteins by two viral proteases: the papainlike protease and the main proteinase M pro (also named the 3C-like protease; 3CL pro ; reviewed in Ziebuhr et al., 2000) . In SARS-CoV, M pro is responsible for the cleavage of 11 sites in the replicase polyproteins (Snijder et al., 2003) , releasing viral enzymes needed for replication, such as the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and the helicase, as well as other accessory proteins and non-structural proteins the functions of which are not fully understood. Thus, given its pivotal role in the viral life cycle, M pro is an attractive target for the development of drugs directed against the SARS virus. Threedimensional structures of M pro enzymes have been reported for several coronaviruses including human CoV (HCoV229E; , porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV; Anand et al., 2002) and SARS-CoV (Yang et al., 2003) . In this study, using an Escherichia coli overexpression system, we purified the SARS-CoV M pro and obtained a novel crystal form at pH 6.5 that diffracts to high resolution and contains one monomer per asymmetric unit. The active-site residues and the oxyanion hole adopt a functional conformation, indicating that this crystal form might be useful for structure-based drug design.",

The forward primer (5 0 -TACTAATTGAAGGA GTTCGGGTTTTAGGAAAATGG-3 0 ) contains an XmnI site (bold). The reverse primer (5 0 -AGCCGGATCCTTATTGGAAGGT AACACCAG-3 0 ) contains a BamHI site (bold) downstream of the stop codon TAA. Four additional amino acids (IEGR) were introduced to facilitate the removal of MBP by factor Xa. Transformed BL21(DE3) E. coli cells were grown at 310 K in LB media supplemented with 0.2% glucose until an OD 600 nm of 0.6-0.8 was attained. IPTG was added to a final concentration of 1 mM and the temperature was lowered to 303 K. After 2 h, cells were harvested by centrifugation at 8000g for 10 min, resuspended in buffer A (20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 50 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA) and lysed by sonication for 20 min, followed by centrifugation at 20 000g for 20 min at 277 K. The supernatant was loaded onto an Econo-column (Bio-Rad) packed with amylose resin (New England Biolab) equilibrated with buffer A and incubated overnight at 277 K. The fusion protein was eluted at 277 K using 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 50 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 10 mM maltose and loaded onto a HiPrep 16/10 Q Sepharose FF column (Amersham) equilibrated with buffer B (20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 50 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA). Proteins were eluted using a linear NaCl concentration gradient in buffer C (20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 1 M NaCl, 1 mM EDTA). Fractions containing MBP-SARS-CoV M pro were pooled, concentrated by ultrafiltration at 3000g (Centricon, Vivascience) and desalted in 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.0, 50 mM NaCl, 1 mM CaCl 2 using PD-10 columns (Amersham). One unit of factor Xa was added per 142 mg of fusion protein for 6 h at 297 K. After cleavage, factor Xa was removed using a resin (Qiagen). Cleaved products were loaded onto an XK 16/20 phenyl Sepharose resin column (Amersham) equilibrated in buffer D (12.5 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.0, 300 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT, 0.1 mM EDTA). The recombinant SARS-CoV M pro was eluted using buffer E (12.5 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.0, 1 mM DTT, 0.1 mM EDTA). Fractions containing SARS-CoV M pro were pooled and the buffer changed to 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT for concentration to 5 mg ml \u00c01 as determined using the Bradford method (Bio-Rad) with BSA as a standard and stored at 193 K.",

Residues 1-101 (domain I) and 102-184 (domain II) form the chymotrypsin-like double--barrel structure which is observed in several viral proteases including picornaviruses, togaviruses and flaviviruses (Babe & Craik, 1997) . The C-terminal -helical domain (residues 201-301) of SARS-CoV M pro is required for activity, since a truncated fragment comprising only its catalytic domain displays a significant decrease in enzymatic activity (Bacha et al., 2004) . Structural and functional studies of coronavirus M pro have shown that dimerization is required for maximal protease activity. In this respect, a prominent role is played by the seven amino-terminal amino acids, which adopt an extended conformation making extensive contacts with domain II of the other monomer and ensuring the formation of a catalytically competent active site (Yang et al., 2003) . In our crystal form, the active dimer is generated through the crystallographic twofold. No contact is established by Ser1, which is mobile as shown by a higher than average temperature factor. The path of the main chain, however, closely follows that observed in previously reported active monomers, with an r.m.s deviation of 0.80 \u00c5 for 300 equivalent mainchain atoms (PDB code 1uj1 chain A; Yang et al., 2003) (Fig. 1a) . This latter crystal form belongs to space group P2 1 and contains one dimer in the asymmetric unit with quasi-twofold symmetry. This indicates that the N-terminal residue is not absolutely required for the active site to adopt an active conformation.",

Although the crystals were obtained at pH 6.5, a value which is presumably near the pK a value of His residues in the substrate-binding site and where the enzyme shows a slightly reduced activity, the conformation of the active site indicates an active enzyme (Fig. 1b) . The immediate vicinity of the active site is involved in extensive intermolecular contacts with neighbouring molecules.
