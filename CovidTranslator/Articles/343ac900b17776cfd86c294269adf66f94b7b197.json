From a sample of 345 Vietnamese respondents aged from 15 to 47 years, this brief note found that the risk perception of COVID-19 danger significantly increases the likelihood of wearing the medical masks. In addition, there is a weak evidence about the differences in age under the COVID-19 outbreaks. More noticeably, those who use masks before COVID-19 pandemic tend to maintain their behaviors.

Our study also confirmed the theoretical foundations devised by Leppin and Aro (2009) . It means that risk is basically related to cognitions and emotions. Therefore, people perceived risk and would behave in the dominant expectancy and value components. Consequently, protective behaviors will be made to meet their cognition and emotions. However, we also draw the noticeable point that WHO's recommendations do not include the behavior in using medical mask in public due to the lack of evidence.

The 'age' coefficient (0.04) is positive at 10% significance level after the COVID-19 outbreak. However, when we control the behaviors which are done before the COVID-19 pandemic, the 'age' effect tends to be stronger (0.047) and this coefficient is at 5% significance level. In addition, the age factor is negative at 10% significance level before the spread of COVID-19. This finding suggests that the elder has a tendency to not care about the medical mask before the COVID-19 outbreak while this behavior seems to change afterwards.

However, the contagious COVID-19 novel virus need to be studied urgently, especially how to contain the spreading in our community. Drawing a sample of 345 Vietnamese citizens from 15 to 47 years old, we found that the risk perception is the main factor which drives the behaviors in wearing medical masks in the public. This substantially contributes to the behavioral economics as well as infectious disease epidemiology to understand and creating behavior change to cope with this deadly virus. In addition, age is also a factor should be carefully examined later because we found that the elder is likely to wear masks after the COVID-19 outbreaks, with the weak evidence. Finally, those who have good habit in wearing mask are consistent to their behaviors.",

Although the effects of wearing masks are controversial, the Asian countries seem to control the COVID-19 pandemic better because the citizens tend to perceive higher risk in the public. Then, they choose to protect themselves by avoiding the virus droplet via closely social communication. Our study limits that the study sample covers those who aged 15 to 47 years. Therefore, the most vulnerable people (over 80 years old) might have different risk perception. We leave this avenue for the future research. How likely do you concern the COVID-19 pandemic?
