            "text": "Background: Intravascular-thrombosis and extravascular-lipid-deposition are the two key pathogenic events considered to interrupt intraosseous blood supply during steroid-associated osteonecrosis (ON) development. However, there are no reported candidate agents capable of simultaneously targeting these two key pathogenic events. The authors' published experimental studies have shown that Epimedium-derived flavonoids possess an anti-ON effect. Further, the authors have recently identified a small molecule Icaritin as an intestinal metabolite of Epimedium-derived flavonoids. Objective: The present study was to evaluate the prevention effect of the available semisynthesized small molecule Icaritin on steroid-associated ON development in a rabbit model. Methods: After receiving an established inductive protocol for inducing steroid-associated ON, eighty-four male 28-week-old New-Zealand white rabbits were divided into the following three daily oral administration groups, including low dose Icaritin group (L-ICT; n = 28; 5 mg\u00b7kg \u2212 1 \u00b7day \u2212 1 ), high dose Icaritin group (H-ICT; n = 28; 10 mg\u00b7kg \u2212 1 \u00b7day \u2212 1 ), and control vehicle group (CON; n = 28). Before and after induction, dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI was performed on proximal femur for intra-osseous perfusion function index. Meanwhile, blood samples were examined for coagulation, fibrinolysis, lipid-transportation, endothelium injury, oxidative stress, and hepatocyte injury index, while marrow samples were quantified for adipogenic potential index of mesenchymal stem cell by in vitro culture and proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARgamma) protein expression by western blot. At baseline, week 1 and 2 post-induction, 4, 8 and 16 rabbits in each group were sacrificed, respectively. After sacrifice, femora were dissected for micro-CT-based micro-angiography, followed by histological examination of ON lesion, intravascular thrombosis, extravascular fat-cell and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) localized expression. Results: The ON incidence in the L-ICT and H-ICT groups was both significantly lower than that in the CON group (p b 0.05 for both). The ON incidence in the H-ICT group was significantly lower than that in the L-ICT group (p b 0.05). A significant decrease in the vascularization index and a significant increase in the permeability index seen in the CON group was attenuated in the L-ICT group and almost prevented in the H-ICT group at week 1 post-induction. Reduced perfusion to vessel-like structural units was more rarely found in the H-ICT group than in the L-ICT group. Regarding intravascular thrombosis, a significant increase in the thrombotic vessel count, endothelium injury index, coagulation index, and a significant decrease in both the fibrinolysis and oxidative stress index in the CON group were attenuated in the L-ICT group and prevented in the H-ICT group. For extravascular lipid-deposition, a significant increase in the fat cell area fraction, adipogenic potential index, PPARgamma expression and lipid-transportation index in the CON group was attenuated in the L-ICT group and prevented in the H-ICT group. Increased immunoreactivity of VEGF in the CON group was attenuated in the L-ICT group and prevented in the H-ICT group. Regarding safety, the hepatocyte injury index did not show significant change from baseline in any group. Conclusion: Icaritin, a novel semisynthesized small molecule with osteoprotective potential, exerts dosedependent effect on reducing incidence of steroid-associated ON with inhibition of both intravascular thrombosis and extravascular lipid-deposition.

An imbalance between coagulation and fibrinolysis resulting from endothelium injury induced by activated oxidative stress, which predisposes to both hypercoagulation and hypofibrinolysis, has consistently presented itself in the intravascular events [5, 6] ; while predominant lipid transportation to peripheral tissue and elevated adipogenesis via upregulated proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARgamma) expression is involved in the extravascular events [7, 8] . Although it has been experimentally confirmed that a combined administration of an anticoagulant with a lipid-lowering agent may help prevent steroid-associated ON [9] , the ideal strategy would be to simultaneously target both intravascular thrombosis and extravascular lipid deposition to prevent steroid-associated ON development [4] .",

Our previously published studies showed that, using our established rabbit model [12] , Epimedium-derived flavonoids (EF, composed of seven flavonoid compounds with parent ring) (Fig. 1A ) demonstrated beneficial effects in the prevention of steroidassociated ON with inhibition of both intravascular thrombosis and extravascular lipid-deposition in a dose-dependent manner [13, 14] . Our more recent study on intestinal metabolism of EF has shown that a single molecule Icaritin (ICT) (Fig. 1B ) may be involved in intestinal metabolism of those seven flavonoid compounds with parent ring in EF, which corresponds to the recent consensus that diversiform isoflavones with a parent ring may be intestinally metabolized to a single Equal for acting on pharmacological targets [15, 16] and Icaritin may be involved in enzymatic hydrolysis of prenylated flavonols [17] . As there were no available studies addressing the dose-dependent effect as well as the underlying mechanism of Icaritin in preventing steroid-associated ON development, the present study was accordingly designed to use our established rabbit model to examine the dose-dependent effect of Icaritin by evaluation on molecular, cytological, and haematological indices for intravascular thrombosis and extravascular lipid-deposition, dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI based perfusion function indices, micro-CT based angiography, histopathological indices for ON lesion, intravascular thrombosis and extravascular lipid-deposition, and local vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression.",

Then, the bilateral proximal femora were dissected for micro-CT-based three-dimensional (3-D) angiography after specimen decalcification, including a histogram generated to display size (thickness) distribution of angiographic structural units and a color-coded scale mapped to the surface of the 3-D images to provide a visual representation of size distribution of angiographic structural units [12, 13] . Histopathological examination was performed to identify local ON lesion by established criteria, i.e. diffuse presence of empty lacunae or pyknotic nuclei of osteocytes in the trabeculae accompanied by surrounding necrotic bone marrow [43] . Each rabbit that had at least one ON lesion in the areas was considered as ON + , while that without ON lesion was considered as ON \u2212 . ON incidence was defined as numbers of ON + rabbits divided by numbers of total rabbits in each group, and ON extent was defined as numbers of ON lesions per ON + rabbit [12, 13] . Intravascular thrombosis index (thrombotic vessle counts), extravascular lipid-deposition index (fat cell area fraction) [41] and size distribution of extravascular leakage particles during angiography were also quantified histomorphometrically [14, 44] . Local vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression was graded by a semi-quantitative estimation of immunoreactivity: negative (\u2212), weak (+), moderate (++), strong (+++) [45] .

This is comparable to the prevention effect of Epimedium-derived flavonoids at employed dosages (10 mg/kg and 20-40 mg/kg) shown in our previous studies [13, 14] . This study also provides experimental explanation for the previously noted clinical observation that ON prevalence was lower in SARS patients frequently prescribed crude extract of Epimedium in southern China than those seldom prescribed crude extract of Epimedium in northern China [10, 11, 18 ]. On the other hand, no significant difference in the ON extent among the three groups (Fig. 3B) was observed suggesting that a threshold exists beyond which ON is initiated, which is consistent with the findings in our recent study [13] and other researchers' study [9] . It also indicated that Icaritin was able to modulate the ON threshold. However, once the threshold was reached, Icaritin had little effect on occurrence of ON.",

GSH/LPO in plasma is a biochemical marker indicating level of oxidation stress [22] . GSH stabilizes lysosomal membrane suppressing vascular endothelium injury by inhibiting increase in lipoperoxides and maintaining cellular oxidation balance in favor of reduction [23] [24] [25] . LPO is generated by hyperoxidation of lipids, a biochemical indicator of tissue injury by active oxygens, closely associated with vascular injury [26, 27] . In the present study, a significant decrease in GSH/LPO in CON group at week 1 postinduction was found (Fig. 4D) , which was consistent with the findings of an experimental study of steroid-induced ON in rabbits [6] . The close correlation between GSH/LPO and TM (R 2 = 0.78) at 1 week postinduction strongly suggested that activated oxidative stress was involved in endothelium injury at an early stage during steroidassociated ON development. Our results also indicated that Icaritin was able to protect the endothelium from oxidative stress in a dosedependent manner, as shown by a significant decrease in GSH/LPO in the CON group which was attenuated in the L-ICT group and almost negated in the H-ICT group at week 1 post-induction. This implied a protective effect of Icaritin on intravascular endothelium injury resulting from activated oxidative stress. This is not unexpected given that several flavonoids family agents derived from herbs have been identified as potential therapeutic antioxidants in different animal models [28] [29] [30] .",

This could be explained by local hypoxia-induced angiogenesis, as evidenced by local VEGF expression which was maintained at high level in the CON group throughout the experimental period. Icaritin was able to continuously relieve local hypoxia condition during steroid-associated ON development, as reflected by the continuously maintained high expression of VEGF in the CON group being attenuated in the L-ICT group and prevented in the H-ICT group throughout the experimental period (Figs. 2E-H) .",

Micro-CT based angio-graphy indicated the presence of many medium-sized disseminated leakageparticle-like structural units (200-400 \u00b5m) at week 1 post-induction compared to baseline (Fig. 7A ). This consistency in \"vascular permeability\" between dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI based functional evidence and micro-CT based structural evidence suggested that local impairment of local blood supply in the CON group at an early stage could be secondary to endothelium injury, a likelihood that was supported by a significant increase in serum TM in the CON group at week 1 post-induction. These findings also concur with a recent work reporting an increase in vascular permeability in steroid-induced ON model [6] . Our results also indicated that Icaritin was able to control \"vascular permeability\" at an early stage in a dose-dependent manner, as supported by the following two functional-and structural-level evidences: 1) the significantly increased PS\u03c1 in the CON group was attenuated in the L-ICT group and almost prevented in the H-ICT group at week 1 post-induction (Figs. 5A, B, D); and 2) nu-merous mediumsized disseminated leakage-particle-like structural units (200-400 \u00b5m, and confirmed histologically as by leakage particles) (Figs. 7G, 7H) in the CON group were not found in the H-ICT group but found only occasionally in the L-ICT group at week 1 post-induction (Figs. 7B, C).",

Note: Red circle indicates the CON group at week 1 post-induction, blue square indicates baseline before induction, brown rhombus indicates the L-ICT group, and green rhombus indicates the H-ICT group.",
