            "text": "A novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) first detected in Wuhan, China, has spread rapidly since December 2019, causing more than 80,000 confirmed infections and 2,700 fatalities (as of Feb 27, 2020). Imported cases and transmission clusters of various sizes have been reported globally suggesting a pandemic is likely. Here, we explore how seasonal variation in transmissibility could modulate a SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Data from routine diagnostics show a strong and consistent seasonal variation of the four endemic coronaviruses (229E, HKU1, NL63, OC43) and we parameterize our model for SARS-CoV-2 using these data. The model allows for many subpopulations of different size with variable parameters. Simulations of different scenarios show that plausible parameters result in a small peak in early 2020 in temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and a larger peak in winter 2020/2021. Variation in transmission and migration rates can result in substantial variation in prevalence between regions. While the uncertainty in parameters is large, the scenarios we explore show that transient reductions in the incidence rate might be due to a combination of seasonal variation and infection control efforts but do not necessarily mean the epidemic is contained. Seasonal forcing on SARS-CoV-2 should thus be taken into account in the further monitoring of the global transmission. The likely aggregated effect of seasonal variation, infection control measures, and transmission rate variation is a prolonged pandemic wave with lower prevalence at any given time, thereby providing a window of opportunity for better preparation of health care systems.",

Higher estimates have also been reported (Sanche et al., 2020; Yang et al., 2020) . Importantly, R 0 is not a biological constant for a pathogen, but is affected by factors such as environmental conditions and the behaviour of infected individuals. One such environmental factor is climate which modulates transmissibility throughout the year. As a result, many respiratory viruses show clear seasonal variation in prevalence; the most well-known example being seasonal influenza which peaks every winter in the temperate zone of the Northern Hemisphere (Petrova and Russell, 2018) . A similar pattern is seen for the four seasonal human coronaviruses: HKU1, NL63, OC43 and 229E (hereafter collectively referred to as \"seasonal CoVs\") (Al-Khannaq et al., 2016; Friedman et al., 2018; Galanti et al., 2019; G\u00f3es et al., 2019; Huang et al., 2017; Killerby et al., 2018) . These viruses cause respiratory infections which usually are mild and primarily affect young children.",

In Stockholm, seasonal variation of CoVs (especially HKU1/OC43) is very consistent across years (see Fig. S3 ). We therefore fit the SIER model to the average seasonal variation across years by calculating the squared deviation of observed and predicted prevalence relative to their respective mean values. Simulations of the model are compatible with observations in two separate regions of parameter space: If Northern Europe was very isolated with less than 1 in 1,000 susceptible individuals returning with a seasonal CoV infection from abroad each year, weak seasonality of around \u03b5 = 0.15 would be sufficient to generate strong variation through the year compatible with observations (Fig. 2 , bottom-left ridge). In this regime, prevalence is oscillating intrinsically with a period that is commensurate with annual seasonal oscillations giving rise to a resonance phenomenon with annual or biennial patterns even for weak seasonal forcing (Chen and Epureanu, 2017; Dushoff et al., 2004) .",

An R 0 \u2248 3 in winter in Hubei and a seasonal forcing of \u03b5 = 0.4 implies an annual average R 0 = \u03b2 0 /\u03bd = 2.2. This reasoning leads to our parameter choice of \u03b2 0 = 158/year, \u03bd = 72/year, \u03b8 = 0. We assume the outbreak started at t = 2019.8 in Hubei with one infected individual and use N = 6 \u00d7 10 7 as population size. To incorporate infection control measures, transmissibility is reduced by 50% once prevalence reached 3% (third order Hill-function, see Supplemental Material). Introductions to a location like Northern Europe with \u03b5 = 0.5 (i.e. slightly stronger seasonal forcing then Hubei) are assumed to happen at a rate of 0.01 per year for each infected individual elsewhere. The simulation of the SIER model in different regions is deterministic, but migration is implemented stochastically by Poisson resampling of the average number of migrating individuals. Fig. 3 shows simulated trajectories of SARS-CoV-2 prevalence in the temperate Northern Hemisphere assuming the outbreak started in Hubei early December 2019. Depending whether the peak transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 in the northern temperate zone is in November, January, or March, the simulation predicts a main peak in the first half of 2020, a main peak in winter 2020/2021, or two similarly sized peaks.",

Rapid growth (high R 0 ) and late transmission peaks result in a large peak in the first half 2020, while lower R 0 and transmission peaks in early winter favor a large secondary peak. These two scenarios are separated by a band of parameter values that give rise to two pandemic waves in the winters of 2020 and 2021 in the Northern Hemisphere. Individual trajectories for a variety of parameter combinations are given in Fig. S4 .

We find that seasonal variation in transmissibility has the potential to modulate the spread of SARS-CoV-2 with a wide range of possible outcomes that need to be taken into account when interpreting case counts and projecting the outbreak dynamics. The onset of spring and summer could, for example, give the impression that SARS-CoV-2 has been successfully contained, only for infections to increase again in 2020-2021 winter season. Even in Hubei virus circulation might decrease due to containment measures and the arrival of spring but might increase again towards the end of the year. Whether a pandemic in the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere would peak early in 2020, late in 2020, or show multiple waves as H1N1pdm did in 2009, depends on the timing of peak transmissibility and the rate of spread (R 0 and serial interval).",

The results we present are critically dependent on the assumptions i) that the outbreak will develop into a pandemic, ii) that the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 shows seasonal variability of sufficient strength (range \u03b5 = 0.3 to 0.7), and iii) that parameters like R 0 estimated from the early phase of the outbreak are comparable in other populations. These assumptions are not implausible but not certain: cases of SARS-CoV-2 has been in several countries in Asia apart from China, as well as in Europe, Africa, North America, and Australia (WHO Emergency Committee, 2020b), and mild or asymptomatic cases make detection and thus prevention of spread by isolation challenging, e.g. airport screening as a preventive measure is unlikely to prevent spread and local seeding (Quilty et al., 2020) . Person-to-person transmission of the virus has been documented in several countries outside of China, including large outbreaks in Iran, South Korea, and Italy (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), 2020). It is likely that not all exported cases have been detected, and some may have seeded outbreaks outside of China that have yet to be detected.",

It should be noted, however, that SARS-CoV-2 does seem to transmit in tropical climates like Singapore, and so winter is not a necessary condition of SARS-CoV-2 spread. Furthermore, our models are compatible with work by Luo et al. (2020) showing that recent trends in different regions across East-Asia imply that seasonality alone is unlikely to end SARS-CoV-2 spread. Precise values for the underlying model parameters and the effect of infection control measures are currently unavailable. For this reason we explored a range of parameter values to assess the robustness of the results to model assumptions.",

Compatibility of SIER model trajectories with observations. The heatmap shows the inverse mean squared deviation between the model trajectories and the observed seasonal forcing in seasonal CoV prevalence.

The left panel shows example trajectories assuming SARS-CoV-2 transmissibility peaks in November, January, or March. These outbreaks in Northern Europe ('NE') are assumed to be seeded by the outbreak in Hubei (model trajectory shown as a dashed line). Within the model, these cases are exported at rate of 0.01/year to temperate Northern Europe with an average R0 = 2.2 and seasonal forcing of \u03b5 = 0.5. Corresponding graphs for different values of R0 and the migration rate are shown in SupplementalFig. S4. The right panel shows the ratio of the first and second peak for a range of different combinations of R0 and \u03b8. The yellow area corresponds to parameter combinations with essentially only an early peak similar to the yellow line on the left. The blue/purple area shows parameter combinations for which a peak in late 2020 dominates, as with the purple line on the left, while the central pink/orange band shows the combinations giving rise to two comparable peaks. These simulations are for \u03b5 = 0.5. Similar results were obtained for \u03b5 = 0.3 and 0.7, seeSupplementary Fig. 6.",

The super-position of many variable epidemics can result in a global prevalence that decays only slowly through 2020 and 2021. Lighter lines have lower R0, darker lines have higher R0. The actual observed case counts reported for Hubei are added (brown line) and multiplied by three to account for possible under-reporting of mild cases. A subset of 30 randomly chosen simulations are plotted for each region. Analogous figures for different R0 parameter values are shown in Supplementary Fig. Transition to an endemic seasonal virus.",
