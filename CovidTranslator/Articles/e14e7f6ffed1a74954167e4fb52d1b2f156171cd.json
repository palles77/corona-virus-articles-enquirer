TGE was last reported in Hungary in 2013 and the virus has not been found since, therefore a serological survey was planned to estimate the level of protection against it. 908 sera of sows from 93 farms were selected together with 174 archive samples from one farm covering a wider age group. All samples were screened with an indirect immunofluorescence (IF) test with a positive result of 15.42% and 17.82%, respectively. All IF-positive samples were examined with a commercial ELISA, revealing seropositivity against PRCV in almost all cases. These findings should serve as a recommendation to not omit TGE from the diagnostics of diarrhoea in swine.",

            "text": "Transmissible gastroenteritis (TGE) was first described in the United States in 1946 (Doyle & Hutchings 1946) , then spread worldwide causing diarrhoea and vomiting in swine of all ages (Saif, Pensaert, Sestak, Yeo, & Jung, 2012) . However, a few decades later (Laude, Van Reeth, & Pensaert, 1993) a clinically milder, endemic form of TGE emerged parallel with the appearance of porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV). PRCV is a mutant of TGE virus (TGEV), showing deletions mainly in the spike (S) gene. This difference is recognized minimal at the genetic level, which explains how both viruses are considered as one species Alphacoronavirus 1 (Lin et al., 2015) , but it can be great phenotypically, as it may be the result of their different tissue tropism, as the expressed S glycoprotein is responsible for cell entry (Ballesteros, Sanchez, & Enjuanes, 1997) . In contrast to TGEV, PRCV has respiratory tropism and usually causes an undiscerned subclinical infection (Pensaert, Cox, Van Deun, & Callebaut, 1993) , which can induce the production of cross-reacting antibodies, causing difficulties in serological diagnostics (Miyazaki, Fukuda, Kuga, Takagi, & Tsunemitsu, 2010) . The virus neutralization assay cannot be used to differentiate TGEV and PRCV, therefore various enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) were developed using monoclonal antibodies targeting the different epitopes of the S protein (Carman et al., 2002) . Serological tests such as these can be used to monitor herd status or newly transported animals, as TGEV/PRCV-seronegative farms are at risk of the disease, although TGE outbreaks occurred only sporadically since the appearance of PRCV (L\u0151rincz, Biksi, Andersson, Cs\u00e1gola, & Tuboly, 2013) .",

Our hypothesis was denied, since the overall seropositivity based on the IF test of 908 samples was only 15.42%. Examining different age groups in farm \"F\" showed similar results with a seropositivity of 17.82%. It was interesting to find no positive sows, although it should be noted that there was no connection between the samples of piglets and sows. A differentiating ELISA revealed that actually almost all positive sera had antibodies against PRCV. These antibodies can react to TGEV, as confirmed also in this study by the IF test, but frequent reinfections with PRCV are needed to reach an efficient titer for protection against TGE (Laude et al., 1993) , which was not realized in the examined samples of farm \"F\". The IF positive, but ELISA negative samples could be also explained by the relative amount of antibodies, which was not sufficient to cross the threshold of the kit. The only TGEV positive serum was found in a farm with five PRCV positive and four negative samples, which may indicate that there was an unapparent TGE outbreak overcome by protective anti-PRCV antibodies.",
