Although the World Health Organization (WHO) provided extremely fast information and support to afflicted countries, the European network of state epidemiologists and national agencies failed to respond quickly enough. Important information about possible cases of SARS or European travel restrictions were often communicated with delays of 48 hours or more. European healthcare officials hope to avoid repeats of such inadequate responses, and are determined that faster coordination and better surveillance will be made possible by a European Centre for Disease Control (ECDC), similar to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta, Georgia. A decision about the new ECDC director is expected shortly, but it is already clear that this director will face an uphill struggle to create a European equivalent to the CDC.",

The current difficulties of the European Union in collating and disseminating epidemiological information -as seen with SARS -will only get worse with the addition of ten new member states. Therefore the creation of an independent agency for surveillance and control of communicable diseases has been welcomed, and from 2005 the ECDC will operate from a base in Stockholm, Sweden.",

This is currently carried out on a national level in Europe. But EU countries vary considerably in terms of resources and which diseases are notifiable. The surveillance systems and the quality of the data generated also vary. For example, each year more cases of salmonellosis are reported for Swedish tourists visiting some European countries than for the entire native populations of those countries. Standardization of these systems is not likely to occur in the near future, except for the most severe infections, which will be regulated by the new International Health Regulations, to be ratified by the WHO in 2005.",

Of particular concern is that the transmission of avian flu in Asia has led to high death rates among bird handlers -although the viruses have not been transmissible between humans. If even one of them becomes transmissible, we could be faced with an outbreak similar to the 'Spanish flu' of 1918. That epidemic resulted in approximately 40 million deaths and many who died were young and previously healthy individuals. In Europe, and elsewhere, the amount of influenza vaccine produced would be insufficient to prevent such a scenario. The ECDC needs to issue guidelines for member states, facilitate vaccine availability and support the development of national plans for a pandemic.",

At present, the European response is handled through the Directorate General for Health and Consumer Protection (DG SANCO) in Luxemburg, but that responsibility (and associated funds) should be taken over by ECDC. There are also plans to increase the number of BSL4 laboratories in Europe, from the handful in France, Germany, Britain and Sweden. It would make sense for the ECDC to form a network between these existing laboratories -thereby avoiding redundancy of effort. If you consider the expense of building these complex facilities (in excess of US$15 million each) and the type of rare infections they study, the money allocated to planned facilities in Germany and The Netherlands would be better spent elsewhere. Clearly, the ECDC cannot hope to become an equivalent to the CDC in the short term. The lack of authority and lab facilities will hamper ECDC's ability to become an efficient coordinating force for infectious disease control in Europe. And the ECDC will find it hard to train, finance and deploy an epidemiological field force within its allocated budget. But with the expectation of future funding increases, the ECDC should initiate field forces within the member states. A substantial boost to the ECDC would be money well spent as the costs of antibiotic resistance, let alone of SARS or influenza outbreaks, are likely to be enormous. ",
