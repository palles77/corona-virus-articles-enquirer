(b) Alignment and tagging strategy for EV7-StrUP and EV7-StrUP-PTC mutants. Since the uORF overlaps the polyprotein ORF, in order to add a C-terminal Strep tag to UP the overlap region was duplicated upstream of the polyprotein ORF initiation site and the duplicated region was synonymously mutated to prevent recombination. Sequence encoding a Strep tag was appended to the end of the duplicated uORF sequence, the polyprotein ORF initiation context was maintained, and an AUG codon in the duplicated region was mutated (AUG to AUC, underlined; Met to Ile change in UP) to avoid inhibiting scanning 43S preinitiation complexes from reaching the polyprotein AUG.",
