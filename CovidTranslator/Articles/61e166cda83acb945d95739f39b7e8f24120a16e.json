Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), an arterivirus containing a single-stranded positive-sense RNA genome (\u223c15 kb), was served as a model virus and its genomic cDNA was recombinated into baculovirus. We investigated whether infectious virus particles could be generated by expression of the full-length cloned genome from the modified baculovirus vector. The recombinant baculovirus, AcAPRRS, was used to infect sf9 cells. Immunofluorescence assay demonstrated the presence of PRRSV nonstructural protein (nsp) 2 and nucleocapsid (N) protein and electron microscopy revealed PRRSV particles in the culture supernatant. Infectious PRRSV particles were also produced in susceptible MARC-145 cells inoculated with AcAPRRS, and the growth characteristics of the PRRSV generated were similar to those of the parental PRRSV strain. Infectious PRRSV particles were also generated following AcAPRRS transduction of BHK-21 cells and Vero cells that are not sensitive to PRRSV. Titers of PRRSV obtained from BHK-21 and Vero cells were up to 10 4.05 TCID 50 /ml. These findings open a new route to the propagation of the virus in vitro and will be of utility in vaccine development.",

In addition, recombinant baculovirus has been used to amplify an adeno-associated virus vector in insect cells and recently Rhopalosiphum padi virus (RhPV), an insect virus that infects aphids, was successfully generated in insect cells from recombinant baculovirus (Aslanidi et al., 2009; Pal et al., 2007) .

The PRRSV genome, a singlestranded positive-sense RNA approximately 15 kb in length with a 5 cap and a 3 polyA-tail, contains at least nine open reading frames (ORFs). ORFs 1a and 1b encode a polyprotein that is processed co-and post-translationally to generate the mature nonstructural protein (nsp) required for virus replication. The other seven ORFs encode seven structural proteins designed glycoprotein (GP) 2, envelope (E) protein, GP3, GP4, GP5, membrane (M) protein and nucleocapsid (N) protein, respectively (Snijder and Meulenberg, 1998) . Expression of PRRSV structural proteins, as reported for coronavirus structural proteins, requires subgenomic (sg) mRNA synthesis by a mechanism of discontinuous transcription (Pasternak et al., 2006) . The only known natural host for PRRSV is the pig, and the virus has been shown to infect primary porcine alveolar macrophages (PAM) as well as a monkey kidney epithelial cell line, MA-104, and its derivatives including MARC-145 cells.",

The parental AcAPRRS virus was first removed by centrifugation at 50,000 \u00d7 g. Virus particles still present in the supernatant were collected by high-speed centrifugation (106,750 \u00d7 g) and examined by electron microscopy. As shown in Fig. 3A , the final supernatants contained virus particles 45-60 nm in diameter that were morphologically similar to PRRSV virions. However, the particles of AcAPRRS were morphologically identic to baculovirus virions (Fig. 3B) . To address whether these particles in final supernatants contained PRRSV genomic RNA, the preparations were digested with DNaseI and then subjected to RT-PCR using PRRSV-specific primers. As shown in Fig. 3C and D, omission of the RT step failed to generate any PCR product (lane 3), whereas RT-PCR generated a PCR product of the expected size (lane 2). Because PCR amplification of PRRSV sequences was crucially dependent on RT, we concluded that virions containing PRRSV RNA were generated in sf9 cells. PRRSV particles observed by electron microscopy. Residual AcAPRRS particles were removed by centrifugation (50,000 \u00d7 g) and PRRSV virions (45-60 nm; arrowed) were collected by high-speed centrifugation (106,750 \u00d7 g) and visualized after negative staining.

We report that infection of insect sf9 cells with the recombinant baculovirus AcAPRRS led to the synthesis of PRRSV proteins and the culture supernatant contained particles that were morphologically indistinguishable from PRRSV virions. These findings demonstrated that the PRRSV genomic cDNA contained within AcAPRRS was transcribed for protein synthesis and PRRSV RNA was actively packaged into virus particles. The recombinant baculovirus approach could therefore provide a general method for propagating viruses, notably RNA viruses, for which no appropriate in vitro culture system is as yet available.",

This may be due to the fact that the genomic cDNA is inserted downstream of two promoters, the polyhedrin promoter and the CMV promoter. Transcription initiation at the CMV promoter was thought to generate intact genomic PRRSV RNA, but the CMV promoter is only poorly active in insect cells (He et al., 2008) . Further experiments will be required to address whether direct linkage of PRRSV genomic sequences to a strong promoter sequence active in insect cells would significantly increase virus titers.",

Baculovirus is generally considered to be a safe vector. Transduction of mammalian cells appears to take place efficiently but there are no manifest adverse effects and the baculovirus genome is not transcribed and is unable to replicate (Kost and Condreay, 2002; Tjia et al., 1983) . Baculovirus can transduce diverse mammalian cell types and has been exploited as a vector for gene therapy and for DNA vaccine delivery (Kost and Condreay, 2002; Tani et al., 2003) . It was previously reported that baculovirus expressing the E2 glycoprotein of HCV under the control of the CMV immediate-early promoter-enhancer elicited specific humoral and cell-mediated immune responses following intramuscular inoculation of mice (Facciabene et al., 2004) . In this study, we have demonstrated that a recombinant baculovirus carrying PRRSV genomic cDNA was able to generate infectious PRRSV following transduction of mammalian cells that are themselves refractory to infection with PRRSV in vitro. This approach may therefore provide an alternative route for vaccine development, particularly if combined with the expression of genomic cDNA derived from an attenuated virus strain. It is possible that direct inoculation of such a recombinant baculovirus into animals or humans could generate infectious vaccine virus in vivo and thereby induce effective anti-viral immunity. Because baculovirus can be cultured on insect cells in the absence of serum, this avoids the potential risks of contamination associated with the use of animal products.",
