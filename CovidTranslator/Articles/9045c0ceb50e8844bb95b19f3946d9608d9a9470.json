The rate of detection of viruses between exacerbations when individuals are asymptomatic is only of the order of 3-12%.

            "text": "In general, the clinical, physiological and cellular responses to experimental RV infection in asthma are relatively mild and do not necessarily mimic exactly the events after a natural common cold. It has been suggested that this requires a more complex model including both virus infection and preexisting increase in allergic airway inflammation. Indeed, recent epidemiological evidence confirms a synergistic interaction between virus infection and allergen exposure in precipitating hospital admissions for asthma. Other trigger factors that may interact with infection include air pollution. A study of asthmatic children demonstrated an increased risk of developing an asthmatic episode within 7 days of an upper respiratory tract infection if the nitrogen dioxide level was greater than 28 lg/m 3 . 26 Most studies of experimental virus infection in allergic subjects are performed outside the relevant season for allergen exposure. One recent attempt to provide a model combining allergen exposure and virus infection utilized RV infection in subjects with allergic rhinitis. Individuals received three high-dose allergen challenges in the week prior to innoculation to try to mimic combined allergen exposure and virus infection. 27 Interestingly, prior allergen challenge in this model, somewhat unexpectedly, appeared to protect against a RV cold with delayed nasal leukocytosis, delayed rise of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and IL-8 and a delayed, less severe clinical course. There was an inverse correlation between nasal lavage eosinophilia and the severity of cold symptoms. The explanation proposed by the authors of this study is that limited high-dose allergen challenge may not reproduce the effects of chronic low-dose allergen exposure and may stimulate the production of antiinflammatory mediators such as IL-10, or antiviral cytokines such as IFN-c or TNF-a. Further development of models of combined allergen exposure and virus infection is clearly required.",

            "text": "The interaction of respiratory virus infection and chronic asthmatic airway inflammation results in respiratory symptoms that are more severe than those suffered by nonasthmatic individuals. The detailed immunological mechanisms underlying this interaction are currently unclear. Current hypotheses for the pathogenesis of virus-induced asthma exacerbations are summarized in Table 39 .1. The disease syndrome following infection by virus is a consequence both of direct harmful effects of the virus itself and of immunopathology resulting from the host-immune response. In an asthmatic individual, exacerbation may occur because of functional interaction between viral pathology and asthmatic pathology, i.e. through different mechanisms with the same end effect on function, or by sharing the same pathogenetic mechanism in an additive or even in a synergistic fashion. Preexisting asthmatic inflammation might interfere with an effective anti-viral response and thus allow the virus itself to cause increased airway damage. Alternatively, virus infection might increase the sensitivity of the asthmatic airway to trigger factors, such as allergen exposure. In fact, it is likely that virus-induced asthma exacerbations occur because of a combination of these types of interaction. The increased severity of symptoms, including lower respiratory symptoms, seen in subjects with allergic rhinitis, but without asthma, during viral infection suggests that the atopic phenotype itself is important in determining the clinical syndrome following infection by respiratory viruses. Alternatively, it is possible that virus infection in some way amplifies subclinical allergic lower airway inflammation already present prior to infection. Table 39 .1 summarizes some of the current hypotheses proposed to explain the mechanisms of exacerbation of asthma following respiratory virus infection. The evidence supporting these hypotheses is reviewed in detail below.",

            "text": "The extent of epithelial cell destruction observed in the airway varies according to virus type. Influenza typically causes extensive necrosis, 35 whereas RV causes little or only patchy damage. Destruction of epithelial cells results in an increase in epithelial permeability, increased penetration of irritants and allergens, and exposure of the extensive network of afferent nerve fibers.These effects may contribute to the increased bronchial hyperresponsiveness induced by virus infection. 16 There is increasing evidence that the epithelium does not simply act as a physical barrier but has important regulatory roles. Epithelial cells contribute to the immune response following virus infection through the production of cytokines and chemokines ( Fig. 39.1) . They may also act as antigen presenting cells particularly during secondary respiratory viral infections. Epithelial cells express MHC class I and the costimulatory molecules B7-1 and B7-2 and this expression is upregulated in vitro by RV16. 36 Inflammation is a central event both in asthma and in viral infections. The processes involved include interacting cascades from the complement, coagulation, fibrinolytic and kinin systems of the plasma, as well as cell-derived cytokines, chemokines and arachidonic acid metabolites. Our understanding of the interaction of viruses with these cascades in asthma is incomplete and it is likely that different viruses interact with each system to different extents. However, it is reasonable to believe that in all cases the A multitude of inflammatory mediators are generated or act on the epithelial surface. Bradykinin, a 9 amino acid peptide generated from plasma precursors as part of the inflammatory process has been shown to be present in nasal secretions of RV-infected individuals. 37 Bradykinin given intranasally is able to reproduce some of the symptoms of the common cold, such as sore throat and rhinitis. 38 Although the presence of kinins in the lungs of virusinfected individuals has not been reported they are present in both the upper and lower airways in allergic reactions. [39] [40] [41] Some viruses may also cause complement-mediated damage. Complement components bind to epithelial cells both in vitro and in vivo during RSV infections. C3a and C5a are increased in human volunteers infected with influenza A virus. 42 NO is produced by diverse sources including epithelial, endothelial and smooth muscle cells. In human airways, NO appears to be important in relaxation of the human airway smooth muscle. 43 In experimental animals, parainfluenza virus-induced hyperreactivity correlates with a deficiency in constitutive NO production. 44 On the other hand, in inflamed tissues NO reacts with superoxide anion generating peroxynitrite, a highly toxic compound suggesting a dual role for this mediator. Increased levels of exhaled NO are found in nonasthmatic volunteers following natural colds, 45 as well as in asthmatic patients after experimental RV infection. 46 In the latter study an inverse association between NO increase and worsening of airway hyperresponsiveness was demonstrated arguing in favor of a protective role for this substance. This is further supported by the observation that NO reduces cytokine production and viral replication in an in vitro model of RV infection. 47 The up-regulation of ICAM-1 in the asthmatic airway is one explanation for the increased severity of RV infection. RV has itself been shown to further up-regulate ICAM-1 in bronchial biopsies following experimental RV infection. 48 In nasal epithelial cells obtained by brushings from atopic subjects, basal levels of ICAM-1 were increased relative to nonatopic subjects and were elevated in the relevant season for peak allergen exposure. Nasal epithelial cells from atopic subjects showed further up-regulation after in vitro culture with allergen. The highest basal level of expression of ICAM-1 was found on nasal polyp epithelial cells and this was increased further after infection with RV14. Viral titers recovered after RV14 infection were significantly higher for polyp epithelial cells than for nonatopic and atopic nonpolyp epithelial cells. 49 In vitro RV increases expression of both ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 in cultures of primary bronchial epithelial cells and in the A549 respiratory epithelial cell line via a mechanism involving the transcription factor NF-jB. 50, 51 Inhibition of the up-regulation of ICAM-1 might be expected to modify favorably the course of RV infection. One effect of corticosteroids is to inhibit NF-jB. 52 In both A549 cells and in primary bronchial epithelial cells pretreatment with three different corticosteroids, hydrocortisone, dexamethasone and mometasone furoate, inhibits RV16-induced increases in ICAM-1 surface expression, mRNA and promoter activation without alteration of virus infectivity or replication. 53 Disappointingly, a study of inhaled corticosteroids in asthmatics prior to experimental RV infection failed to show a reduction of virus-induced ICAM-1 expression in bronchial biopsies, 48 but it is possible that a longer course and/or a higher dose of inhaled steroid or administration of oral steroids might have demonstrated a significant effect. Viral infection of the respiratory tract results in significant changes in the pattern of cytokine expression by a number of cell types, both by cells of the immune system, which may be increased in number and activation status, and by cells often considered to be structural, but which in fact contribute significantly to the immune response, such as epithelial cells. Efficient orchestration of the immune response by cytokines is essential for eradication of virus. Modification of cytokine expression in the airway may contribute to the increased severity of virus infection in asthma.",

IL-1, TNF-a and IL-6 share pro-inflammatory properties, such as the induction of the acute phase response and the activation of both T and B lymphocytes. IL-1 enhances the adhesion of inflammatory cells to endothelium, facilitating chemotaxis. 57 TNF-a is a potent antiviral cytokine, but in vitro increases the susceptibility of cultured epithelial cells to infection by the major group rhinovirus RV14 through upregulation of ICAM-1. 30 IL-6 has been shown to stimulate IgA-mediated immune responses. IL-11 may also be important in virus-induced asthma. 58 It appears to cause bronchoconstriction by a direct effect on bronchial smooth muscle. 55 In vivo IL-11 is elevated in nasal aspirates from children with colds, levels correlating with the presence of wheezing. Similarly the chemokine MIP-1a is increased in nasal secretions during natural viral exacerbations of asthma. 59 Viral up-regulation of cytokines may be mediated through certain key transcription factors. Increases in IL-6 and IL-8 production by cultured epithelial cells due to RV is dependent on NF-jB 60,61 as is the induction of IL-1, -6, -8, -11 and TNF-a by RSV. 62, 63 Effects of viruses on airway smooth muscle cells Studies utilizing isolated rabbit tissues and human cultured airway smooth muscle cells suggest that, for RV16, exposure to the virus may have a direct effect on smooth muscle cells, resulting in increased contractility to acetylcholine and impaired relaxation to isoproterenol.This effect is dependent on ICAM-1 and appears to involve an autocrine signaling mechanism, including up-regulation of production of IL-5 and IL-1b by the airway smooth muscle itself. 64 Whether rhinovirus reaches airway smooth muscle cells in sufficient quantity to produce a significant effect by this mechanism in vivo is as yet unknown. The effects of other respiratory viruses on smooth muscle require further investigation.",

Although protein could not be detected in sputum due to the presence of inhibitors of the ELISA assay used, there were increases in mRNA, as determined by semi-quantitative RT-PCR, for both IL-5 and IFN-c. An inverse correlation was demonstrated between the ratio of IFN-c mRNA to IL-5 mRNA and peak cold symptoms. In addition subjects with RV16 still detectable 14 days after inoculation had lower IFN-c/IL-5 ratios during the acute phase of the cold than those subjects who had cleared the virus. 75 CD8\u03e9 T cells are important effector cells in specific cellmediated antiviral immunity. These cells also demonstrate polarization of cytokine production, the major cytokine produced by Tc1 cells being IFN-c and they are believed to play a role in the regulation of CD4 Th1/Th2 balance. 76 In a murine model of asthma the induction of bystander CD4\u03e9 Th2 immune responses to ovalbumin resulted in a switch of virus-peptide-specific CD8\u03e9 T cells in the lung to the production of Tc2 cytokines including IL-5 with, after challenge with virus peptide, the induction of airway eosinophilia. 77 If such a mechanism occurs in man it would suggest a means whereby CD8 antiviral function could be inhibited at the same time as CD8 amplification of allergic inflammation through IL-5 induction of airway eosinophilia.",

Intracellular staining demonstrated that the increase in cells positive for IL-8 at day 2 could be attributed to the increase in IL-8-positive neutrophils. 19 The chemokine IL-8 is a potent chemoattractant for neutrophils, but also acts on lymphocytes, basophils and primed eosinophils. An increase in IL-8 has been found in nasal lavage from children with natural colds. 56 Experimental infection of atopic asthmatics with RV16 resulted in elevated IL-8 in nasal lavage and this correlated with cold and asthma symptom scores and a fall in histamine PC20. 21 Sputum from asthmatics with asthma exacerbations has both elevated IL-8 and neutrophilia. 88 A study of experimental virus-induced asthma in children also demonstrated elevated IL-8 and neutrophilia in nasal aspirates during the acute phase of infection and levels of neutrophil myeloperoxidase correlated with symptom severity. 89 Such studies suggest a prominent role for the neutrophil in tissues damaged during virus-induced asthma.",

One definition is an acute tracheobronchitis, generally infectious in etiology, that occurs in a patient with established COPD. An important element of this definition is that other causes of respiratory deterioration frequently encountered in this patient group, such as congestive cardiac failure, cardiac arrhythmias, pneumothorax, pneumonia and pulmonary thromboembolism must be excluded. 101 The typical clinical features of an exacerbation include increased dyspnea, wheezing, cough, sputum production and worsened gas exchange.

In a study of 186 patients rhinoviruses, influenza virus, parainfluenza virus and coronavirus were significantly associated with COPD exacerbations. Patients did not seem to have increased susceptibility to these viruses but viral infection had more serious consequences if it occurred. 103 The role of bacteria in precipitating exacerbations is controversial. Bacteria may have a primary role in the development of an exacerbation or represent a secondary superinfection of an initial viral process. Various bacterial species are present in the airways of 25-50% of patients, even when the COPD is stable but increased frequency of recovery of bacteria during exacerbations suggests that they play a role. 104, 105 Significant bacterial infection has been suggested when there is an abundance of neutrophils in the sputum 106 and when the sputum is purulent and green (due to neutrophil myeloperoxidase). 107 The major bacterial organisms associated with COPD exacerbations are nontypable Haemophilis influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis. 108, 109 Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Chlamydia pneumoniae may play a part. 110 Evidence also suggests that in more severe patients with a baseline FEV 1 of 35% predicted or less, Gram-negative bacteria especially Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas play an important part in acute exacerbations. 111 Although the results of placebo-controlled trials show conflicting results, overall the effects of antibiotic treatment also suggest an etiological role for bacteria in exacerbations in some patients. A meta-analysis of nine studies showed a small overall benefit when antibiotics were used for COPD exacerbations. 112 The largest study included 362 exacerbations in 173 outpatients. 106 Compared with placebo, the rate of symptom resolution and improvement of peak expiratory flow during exacerbations was slightly but significantly faster when patients were treated with cotrimoxazole, amoxicillin or doxycycline. More importantly, treatment failures as defined by respiratory deterioration were nearly twice as likely in the placebo group. Benefit from antibiotics was most evident for patients with most symptoms (dyspnea, increased sputum volume and sputum purulence).",

The American Thoracic Society statement on COPD 99 suggests using antibiotics if there is evidence of infection (fever, leukocytosis, CXR changes), but not all patients with bacterial bronchial infection have fever (this is more common in viral infection or pneumonia) and few have CXR changes. The European Respiratory Society recommends antibiotics if the sputum is purulent, using standard antibiotics as first line, and sputum culture if these fail. 113 The major bacterial pathogens isolated during bronchial infections all form part of the commensal flora in the nasopharynx. Bronchial infections occur in patients with abnormal airways with reduced host defenses. Persistence of bacteria within the bronchial tree may come about through toxins that impair mucociliary clearance, enzymes that break down local immunoglobulin, products that alter immune effector cell function, adherence to mucous and damaged epithelium or other mechanisms of avoiding immune surveillance. 114 Bronchial infections usually remain confined to the mucosa. Many will resolve spontaneously without antibiotic treatment. Persistent bacterial infection usually reflects the severity of the impairment of the lung defenses, rather than the virulence of the micro-organism. The damage to lung tissue caused by the host inflammatory response to chronic bacterial infection may be more important than the damage caused directly by the bacteria themselves. 102",

Both proteinase enzymes and reactive oxygen species cause damage to the epithelium, stimulating mucous production and impairing mucociliary clearance. Neutrophil elastase stimulates epithelial cell production of the chemokine IL-8 which attracts further neutrophils and in addition impairs phagocytosis by destroying antibody and cleaving complement receptors from neutrophils and complement components from bacteria. Similar cellular mechanisms operate in COPD. Neutrophils are also stimulated by cigarette smoke.",

Between 33 and 70% of exacerbations are associated with symptoms of the common cold. The frequency of exacerbations requiring hospitalization is higher in the winter. One explanation for this could be the increased frequency of respiratory viruses at this time of the year. A recent study of 321 exacerbations in 83 patients with moderate to severe COPD using new diagnostic methods including RT-PCR shows a high incidence of viral infection. 116 Viruses were detected in nasal aspirates at exacerbation in almost 40% of cases. Rhinovirus was the most common, occurring in 58% of cases where a virus was present. The presence of virus was associated with increased dyspnea, cold symptoms and sore throat and with prolonged recovery from exacerbation. Earlier studies relying on serology and virus culture quote lower virus detection rates of 15-20%. 103, [117] [118] [119] It has been suggested that persistent virus infection contributes to the progression of COPD. In particular, adenovirus appears to persist in a latent form in which viral proteins are produced without replication of complete virus. Such latent infection may amplify lung inflammation due to cigarette smoke. 120 Adenoviral E1A DNA persists in human lungs from patients with COPD compared with patients of similar age, sex and smoking history who do not have COPD. 121 The E1A protein has been demonstrated in airway epithelial cells from smokers. 122 It is able to amplify many host genes through attachment to the DNA-binding sites of transcription factors. 123 Airway epithelial cells transfected with E1A produce excess inflammatory cytokines such as IL-8, 124 and surface adhesion molecules such as ICAM-1 125 after in-vitro challenge by an NF-jBdependent mechanism. 126 RSV has been identified in induced sputum from patients with stable COPD. These individuals have a higher plasma fibrinogen and serum IL-6, a higher pCO 2 and increased frequency of exacerbations. 116 This suggests either that low grade persistent RSV infection contributes to COPD severity or that patients with more severe COPD are less able to clear RSV from the airway.",

Similar studies are required in COPD exacerbations for which fewer data are currently available.

Corticosteroids form the major antiinflammatory component of such therapy, but their use can be associated with significant side-effects, especially if used systemically and in high doses. Antibiotics are indicated for bacterial infection. Antiviral agents do exist, in particular for influenza viruses, but the effective use of such drugs in asthma and COPD requires viral diagnosis and commencement of treatment early in the course of an exacerbation or the targeting of high-risk groups for prophylaxis. Clinically effective broad spectrum agents are not yet available for the rhinoviruses which are the most common cause of exacerbations. Alternative strategies for drug development may involve the identification of key factors common to exacerbations induced by a range of different viruses.
