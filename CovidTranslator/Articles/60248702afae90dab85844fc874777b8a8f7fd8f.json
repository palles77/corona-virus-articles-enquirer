The aim of this prospective birth cohort study was to identify risk factors for an hMPV or RSV infection during the first year of life in unselected healthy children. We followed 217 children from birth to 1 year of age. Nasal swabs and symptom diaries were collected monthly. Anti-hMPV and anti-RSV IgG antibodies by age 1 year were detected by ELISA, and nasal swabs were analysed for hMPV and RSV by RT-PCR. Logistic regression was used for risk factor analysis. Anti-hMPV IgG was found in 38 children (17.5%), and anti-RSV IgG in 172 children (79%). Risk factors for being anti-hMPV IgG-positive were: (1) being born in the spring (OR =2.36; 95% CI:1.06-5.27), and (2) having older siblings (OR=3.82; 95% CI:1.75-8.34). Risk factors for being anti-RSV IgG-positive were: (1) gestational age <38 weeks (OR=3.39; 95% CI:1.42-8.05), (2) increasing paternal age (OR=1.85 per 5 yrs; 95% CI:1.28-2.68), and (3) wall-to-wall carpeting (OR=3.15; 95% CI:1.29-7.68). Being born in the spring was associated with decreased odds of being anti-RSV IgG-positive (OR=0.27, 95% CI:0.09-0.85). Risk factors for RSV hospitalisation (n= 11) were: (1) older siblings (OR=4.49; 95% CI: 1.08-18.73) and (2) smoking in the household (OR=5.06; 95% CI: 1.36-18.76). Exclusive breastfeeding for the first 14 days of life protected against hospitalisation (OR= 0.21; 95% CI:0.06-0.79). In conclusion, this study identifies risk factors for mild and asymptomatic hMPV infections in infancy.

A number of studies have compared the clinical symptoms associated with hMPV infection in hospitalised children with those associated with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infections [1, 3, 12, 27, 28, 36, 37, 39, 42] . Although hMPV infections in many studies tend to be slightly milder than RSV infections, a statistically significant difference was not observed. Few studies have reported longer hospital stays for hMPV-infected children than for RSV-infected children [25, 28] .",

One to 3 percent of RSV-infected children get hospitalised, and several studies have identified a number of risk factors for severe RSV infection [2, 5, 20, 26, 32] . A recent study suggests that risk factors for hMPV hospitalisation appear to be similar to risk factors for RSV hospitalisation [30] . However, risk factors leading to hospitalisation in high-risk groups are not necessarily identical to risk factors for infection in the general population. Little is known about factors protecting against hospitalisation for hMPV infection. As both hMPV and RSV infection have been associated with subsequent wheezing [11, 19, 21, 33] , it is important to investigate risk factors for early infection in order to prevent or postpone infection in predisposed individuals.",

The effect of increasing paternal age on risk of RSV infection was new to us. The paternal age span ranged from 20-53 years, and the effect was especially noticeable among fathers older than 38 years. Young adults usually have the highest amounts of antibodies to respiratory viruses. With increasing age, antibody levels decline, making the individual more susceptible to new infections. An explanation could be that older fathers, due to low levels of RSV antibodies, become infected and transmit the virus to the child. However, we did not collect plasma samples from the fathers for antibody detection to confirm this theory. The same effect was not noticed for mother's age, probably due to a smaller age span.",

However, this finding disappeared in multiple regression analysis, as the protective effect of being born in the spring was more pronounced. To our knowledge, the association between carpeting and RSV infection has not been described previously. It is not known whether the survival of RSV is greater on carpets than on smooth floors, but young children spend much time lying and crawling on the floor, and transmission from surfaces contaminated with RSVinfected nasal secretions is possible [14] . Maybe parents are more inclined to place their child directly on a carpet rather than on a cold floor, and maybe cleaning is easier achieved on the floor through rubbing. Factors highly associated with RSV hospitalisation were passive smoking and the presence of older siblings, while exclusive breastfeeding in the first 2 weeks of life was protective. This is in accordance with other studies of severe RSV infection [17, 26, 29] . The identification of children with a previous hMPV or RSV infection was based on IgG detection in plasma by age 1 year. In most children, maternal antibodies disappear within 6 months [4, 6, 7] , and IgG detected after that age will be the result of natural infection. Some studies report that infants <6 months of age have poor serum antibody responses against RSV infection, making the use of seroepidemiological diagnosis difficult [4, 10, 41] . Other studies have found that almost all children <1 year of age generate an antibody response after their first RSV infection [31] . The seroprevalence of anti-RSV IgG in our cohort is at the higher end of what is usually reported, and seven children with proven RSV infection before 2 months of age all had detectable low levels of anti-RSV IgG by age 12 months, making the possibility of an underestimation unlikely. The seroprevalence of anti-hMPV IgG correlates well with the results of other studies [22] .",

The study was first and foremost designed to detect risk factors for hMPV and RSV infection in infancy. The sample size calculation for detection of differences in symptoms related to hMPV and RSV infection was based on the assumption that all hMPV and RSV infections were identified during the study period. However, we did not identify time of infection for the majority of IgG-positive children. The clinical symptoms related to hMPV and RSV infection in young children in the community in this study is therefore descriptive in nature. Shedding durations of RSV and hMPV in nasal secretions after an acute infection have been reported to be 11.5 and 5 days respectively [38] . Therefore, nasal swab specimens taken more often than once a month would be preferable to identify the time of primary infection. However, for ethical and practical reasons, this was not possible in the present study. Collecting nasal swabs at regular monthly intervals made it possible to identify a quarter of the hMPV infections. We used this method to avoid the risk of bias and underreporting by parents if they actively had to contact us for every respiratory episode, which has been the case in other studies [8] .",
