The household has traditionally been the site for studying these illnesses since it allowed identification of varying illness frequencies in different members of the family in a setting where significant transmission occurred [4] . While it is possible to draw general conclusions from the findings of these household studies, there were clear differences among them, based on the methods used and the populations investigated [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] . Differing were the number of households followed, the way they were identified for participation, the method and frequency of contact for reporting illness onset, whether specimens were collected on a regular basis or only at illness onset, and the case definition that triggered specimen collection.",

The specific viruses causing ARIs were most likely to be identified in children aged <5 years (77% of ARIs were etiologically confirmed) and least likely in adults aged 18-49 years (46% were etiologically confirmed). Rhinoviruses and coronaviruses were the most frequently identified viruses in all age categories (21% and 16% overall, respectively), with coronaviruses more frequent than rhinoviruses in adults; ARIs caused by these viruses and ARIs with no agent identified were least likely to be medically attended.

While all of the studies were longitudinal in nature, they involved varied population groups and differed in other characteristics, such as case definitions, ways of ascertaining that an illness had occurred, and how etiologic agents were identified [6] [7] [8] . Despite this variation, certain concepts emerged involving both how illnesses in general varied in the population by age, sex, and family composition and how the individual viruses varied by frequency of identification and by season [21] . There was a perception that these studies could not again be performed, for reasons of logistics and expense. This was despite the concern that social changes might have altered the frequency of illnesses and transmission characteristics; previous observations had formed the basis of strategies for control of an influenza pandemic, which would make initiation of such studies desirable. There have also been recent major improvements in the determination of illness etiology, driven by the development of the RT-PCR assay [10] [11] [12] . This technique has increased the sensitivity of virus detection and expanded the ability to detect viruses now known to cause ARIs (eg, HMPVs and new coronaviruses) [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] . RT-PCR is also more easily and reliably performed than isolation of virus in (7) 279/696 (40) 78/417 (19) 12-17 y 258/2515 (10) 56/258 (22) 29/258 (11) 12/258 (5) 4/258 (2) 3/258 (1) 3/258 (1) 19/258 (7) 9/258 (3) 127/258 (49) cell culture or serology, both of which were used extensively in past studies to determine etiology [21, [27] [28] [29] . We began the current study of respiratory tract infection in households as a way to supply updated information on influenza frequency and transmission, using a design that would manage costs and overcome some of the logistical challenges. We concentrated surveillance on the period when we expected influenza virus to be circulating, but we also extended this period so that occurrence of other viruses, when influenza virus was not circulating, could be determined. In fact, the period covered would include most of the annual time of increased transmission of respiratory viruses in general. We used an ARI case definition more rigorous than that used in the Tecumseh study [6] and required that ill individuals come to the research study site to have specimens collected. This could partially explain the lower frequency of illnesses currently identified. However, the overall patterns of illness frequency observed here were similar to those observed previously. Specifically, ARI frequency declined with increasing age in childhood, and increased among young adults with exposure to children [21, 27, 29] . However, even if it were possible to annualize the total age-specific frequencies of illnesses seen, they would be lower than those seen in the older studies [5, 21, 27, 29] . There could be many explanations for this, including changes in living conditions and implementation of vaccination programs, in addition to differences in study design. Indeed, such differences related to design were demonstrated within the Seattle Virus Watch, a classic household study [8] . The trade-off between intensively following a small number of households and less intensive surveillance of larger, more diverse households has been previously recognized [30] .",

Rhinoviruses were the most commonly identified viruses in the original and current studies, even though the surveillance periods in the current study did not include the period immediately following opening of schools, when that virus predominates [31] [32] [33] . Coronavirus infections were documented in the Tecumseh study only by means of serology; at that time, only 229E and OC43 were recognized, with the latter being more common [28, 34] . Now, NL63 is a commonly identified coronavirus, with HKU1 similar in frequency to 229E [22] [23] [24] . It had been suspected that the role of coronaviruses in common respiratory infections had been underestimated, and our findings support that hypothesis. RSVs, HMPVs, and parainfluenza viruses are mainly thought of as childhood viruses [26, [35] [36] [37] [38] ; while they were more common in young children, they were found in all age groups and were intermediate in requiring medical attention. Too few parainfluenza viruses were detected to note the alternative patterns of serotype circulation seen previously [36, 39] . During the 3 seasons, 274 influenza viruses were identified, mainly in years 1 and 3, despite vaccination coverage of approximately 60% [17] .",

It will be challenging to separate long-term shedding, which is probably the case with adenovirus, and potentially incidental coinfection, which may be the case with some other viruses (eg, rhinoviruses), from actual relation to the current illness [40] . Frequent identification of coinfecting viruses has also been demonstrated in studies involving medically attended ARIs [41] . Other studies, involving day care attendees, have found no relation between the number of infectious agents identified and illness severity [42] , an observation in line with our finding of coinfection even in those with nonmedically attended illnesses.",

Coronaviruses have now joined the rhinoviruses in causing most illnesses, and medical consultation remains a good indicator of illness severity [27] . The PCR technique has detected a new issue, virus coinfection. The etiological role of each virus identified will need to be examined, perhaps by specimens collected early and late in the illness. This type of household study is logistically challenging but permits not only the observations reported here, but also, for example, longitudinal analyses of interactions between viruses that could affect subsequent infection risks. As is illustrated by the year-to-year variation observed [29] , evaluations need to be performed over time, allowing the maximum use of the data collected.",

Influenza virus circulated intensively from January through April 2011 (year 1), sporadically from February through April 2012 (year 2), and with moderate intensity but far longer duration from November 2012 through April 2013 (year 3). Influenza A(H3N2) virus, 2009 pandemic influenza A(H1N1) virus, and influenza B virus cocirculated in year 1, influenza A (H3N2) virus predominated in year 2, and influenza A (H3N2) virus and influenza B virus cocirculated in year 3. Each year, rhinoviruses and coronaviruses were both frequently identified throughout surveillance periods. Peak circulation of rhinoviruses occurred in October-November in year 1 and February-March in year 3; peak circulation of coronaviruses was during the winter months either immediately prior to or consistent with peak influenza virus circulation.
