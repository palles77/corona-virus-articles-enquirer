To obtain the complex cabin contaminant distribution fields accurately and completely, which is also essential to provide solid and precise data for computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model validation, this paper aimed to investigate and improve the method for simultaneous particle and gaseous contaminant fields measurement. The experiment was conducted in a functional MD-82 aircraft. Sulfur hexafluoride (SF 6 ) was used as tracer gas, and Di-Ethyl-Hexyl-Sebacat (DEHS) was used as particulate contaminant. The whole measurement was completed in a part of the economy-class cabin without heating manikins or occupied with heating manikins. The experimental method, in terms of pollutant source setting, sampling points and schedule, was investigated. Statistical analysis showed that appropriately modified sampling grid was able to provide reasonable data. A small difference in the source locations can lead to a significant difference in cabin contaminant fields. And the relationship between gaseous and particulate pollutant transport was also discussed through tracking behavior analysis.",

Long exposure time in the aircraft cabin environment containing contaminant such as pathogenic aerosol may make passengers sick. Mangili and Gendreau (2005) evaluates the risk of respirable infectious disease (Tuberculosis-TB and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-SARS) transmission in commercial aircraft cabins and concluded that air travel is an important factor in the spread of respirable infectious diseases worldwide. In addition, the high passenger density (Mangili and Gendreau, 2005) and lower personal fresh air rate than for the buildings environment result in a high concentration of CO 2 (Haghighat et al., 1999) . And the use of various cleaning products in the cabin leads to a high concentration of VOCs such as ethanol and acetone (Nagda and Rector, 2003) . These particulate and gaseous pollutants can be removed by the cabin ventilation system. Therefore, to provide a healthy and comfortable cabin environment for passengers, and to design better ventilation system, it is important to study the feature of contaminant distributions in the cabin.",

Some used water-filled scaled model, but the different scale and working fluid further complicate the equivalent analysis for the full scale cabin environment (Thatcher et al., 2004) . In addition, the two main points missing consideration in previous experimental studies are: First, how to set the contaminant source was not clearly described, which would influence the concentration distribution. Second, the number of sampling points was usually limited, and whether they were enough for obtaining complete and accurate fields for simulation validation was not discussed.",

Numerical simulation is another important way to study the pollutant transport and distribution due to its cost, time and labor saving nature compared with the experimental method (Pepper and Wang, 2011; Zhai et al., 2012) . However, one numerical model must be validated before it can be applied for design or research purpose. Yan et al. (2009) found the simulation results of tracer gas transport cannot be clearly indicated by the experimental data possibly due to the \"sampling points were too coarse to describe the concentration gradient\". Wan et al. (2009) also discussed the measurement uncertainty because of low particle concentration while comparing with the numerical results. In study, the predicted tracer gas and particle concentration did not agree well with the measurement which may be due to the measurement uncertainty caused by unstable airflow. In summary, there is a general agreement that an accurate and complete measurement is essential for numerical method validation.",

The objective of this study is to investigate the method for accurate and complete concentration field measurement for both particulate and gaseous contaminants. The contours of contaminant distribution at 8 lateral and 6 longitudinal sections are obtained. The effect of sampling grid, source generation setting which is essential for experiment in the cabin is discussed. We also investigate the difference between gas and particle distribution and analyze the particle tracking behavior which can indicate the effect of velocity fields on particle distribution. To provide a stable thermal boundary condition, the aircraft cabin was insulated. The size of the cabin was 2.91 m (W) \u00c2 40 m (L) \u00c2 2.04 m (H). It was a single-aisle cabin with 3 rows of seats (12 seats) in the first-class cabin, and 28 rows of seats (130 seats) in the economy-class cabin. The air was supplied from upper-side, and was exhausted through side walls near the floor. The MD-82 aircraft cabin environment was controlled by a ground air-conditioning cart (GAC). The total airflow supplied by the GAC to the cabin was 10 L s \u00c01 person \u00c01 . The air temperature was controlled at 20 AE 1 C in the experiment. Twelve heating manikins (75 W each) were placed in the first-class cabin and they were uniformly wrapped The effects of a moving human body on flow and contaminants transport inside an aircraft cabin. with resistance wire to mimic the thermal plume generated by passengers. The economy-class cabin was unoccupied. This investigation used mixed SF 6 (1% SF 6 balanced with 99% N 2 ) as a representative of gaseous contaminants. Although CO 2 is commonly used as a tracer gas (Zhang et al., 2012; Wang et al., 2008) , its measurement can be easily disturbed by the background concentration and operators around. The low background concentration, non-reactive and nontoxic nature and easy detectability of SF 6 make it ideal as a tracer gas to simulate gas contaminant and often used to measure ventilation rate (Cheong, 2001) . In addition, the density of the 1% SF 6 -N 2 mixed gas (1.25 kg m \u00c03 ) is similar to that of air (1.2 kg m \u00c03 ), so the buoyancy effect of the mixed gas can be neglected. The SF 6 concentration was analyzed with a photo-acoustic multi-gas analyzer (INNOVA 1412, LumaSense Technologies).",

However, the different flow field over time may have already changed the pollutant fields, therefore the measured gas and particle field cannot be easily compared. In this study, the tracer gas and particles were devised to release at the same time. Because the influence of the airflow on contaminants distribution would be investigated, the contaminants were released with almost zero momentum to avoid their effects on airflow field. In addition, as the velocity field is dynamic and complex in the cabin ), a small difference in the source locations may lead to a significant difference of contaminant fields. Therefore, two source location settings were studied. The first source setting is shown in Fig. 2 (a). The particles and SF 6 were released from separate sources with a distance of 10 cm between, which is the minimum length of the concentration sampling grid in the current study. The second source setting is shown in Fig. 2 (b). The generation flow of particles and SF 6 were same as in separate-source condition, but they were released from a single port, which was placed at the mouth of a seated passenger. The releasing port was made by a rubber bulb which had a mixing chamber to mix the contaminants uniformly.",

The SF 6 was released from a block of porous material ( Fig. 2(a) ), and the velocity on the surface of the block was about 0.02 m s \u00c01 which was much smaller than the air velocity near the location. The source can be considered to be non-momentum. Due to the mixed gas contained 1% SF 6 , The tracer gas was continuously released into the cabin with a volume flow rate of 1.65 \u00c2 10 \u00c07 m 3 s \u00c01 (0.01 L min \u00c01 ). With this flow rate, divided by the total air volume supplied by the airconditioning system, the average concentration in the cabin was approximately 0.1 ppm. The lower detection limit of INNOVA 1412 is 0.06 ppm for SF 6 . A non-momentum particle source was made of a rubber bulb. The diameter of the bulb was 5 cm and there were about 200 holes with diameter of 2 mm on the surface ( Fig. 2(a) ). The flow rate of carrier gas was set to 3.5 L min \u00c01 and also controlled by a gas rotameter. The velocity from the holes on the surface of the rubber bulb was about 0.023 m s \u00c01 . According to Duguid (1946) , most of the expiratory droplets have a size between 2 and 8 mm and the diameter of most bacteria which is parasitized by viruses to spread through the air is 0.2e3.2 mm (Kowalski et al., 1999) . In addition, previous studies (Murakami et al., 1992; Zhao et al., 2004) in buildings assumed that particles with aerosol diameter less than 4.5 mm showed diffusion properties similar to those of gas with zero gravitational settling velocity. Therefore, in the current study the mean particle size generated was controlled to be 3 mm, with which the particles were most likely to spread with airflow. The geometric standard deviation (GSD) of the generated particles was less than 1.2. Meanwhile, according to Yang et al. (2007) , the particle number generated through coughing is approximately 3 \u00c2 10 6 pt s \u00c01 , thus the total number of generated particles with aerodynamic diameter of 3 mm was controlled to have a similar level.

To reduce the labor and time cost, the second simplified sampling grid resolution was designed to be sparse, and was 0.2 m \u00c2 0.2 m for a cross section ( Fig. 4(b) ). To optimize the sampling point number for a complete capture of the concentration field, based on second sampling grid, the third modified sampling grid was modified with dense grid near the source and air supply inlet where the concentration gradient is higher (Fig. 4(c) ). Sampling points blocked by seats were deleted in the measurement. In total, for the first grid resolution, there were actually 335 points on a lateral plane and 240 on a longitudinal plane for first-class cabin; and 360 points on a lateral plane and 540 on a longitude plane for economy-class cabin, while the total number of sampling points with the third grid resolution was reduced to about half of that. The performance of these three grid resolutions will be analyzed in next section.",

This indicates that there is no practical restriction on still-air sampling of particles less than 10 mm in aerodynamic diameter. For particle concentration measurement in cabin environment, the maximum air velocity U 0 for which the still-air sampling criteria can be used is defined as (Hinds, 1999): ( 2) where U 0 in cm s \u00c01 is air velocity, Q in L min \u00c01 is the sampling flow rate (5 L min \u00c01 in this study). The calculated criterion is 1.6 m s \u00c01 for current study, therefore the air velocity in the cabin meets the still-air sampling criteria. We utilized the conductive silicone ports and tubes with the diameter of 8 mm facing toward the back of the cabin for particle sampling.

It is clearly shown in Fig. 10 (a) that the smoke from particle source presented a consistent backward transport trend, while some of the smoke from the gas source diffused to the front lower parts of the cabin. The lateral view ( Fig. 10(b) ) also presented different paths for particle and gas sources. Most of smoke released from gas source flowed to the lower part, while most of smoke released from the particle source flowed to the upper part. Considering the same nature of smoke used for particle and SF 6 sources, different airflow direction should be the only reason for affecting the pollutants path. The distance between the two sources was 10 cm as described previously. Because of the small space in the aircraft cabin and its complex air distribution pattern, such a distance was large enough to put the sources in different locations of the vortex above the seat, and therefore affected the contaminants transport and distribution.",

The distance between the calculated mean position of SF 6 and particle was 4 cm for Row 2 plane and was 5 cm for FC-A plane. These values were less than or equal to the diameter of the combined bulb source. Therefore, one could consider there was not obvious difference between the mean positions of SF 6 and particle. As the velocity and concentration field in first-class cabin with heated manikin is more complex than that in the economic class cabin, it is reasonable to expect that the concentration field of the two contaminants can be also consistent with each other if the combined source case were measured in the empty economic class cabin. In summary, as the velocity gradient was large in the cabin, a small difference in the source locations can lead to a significant difference of contaminant transport paths and fields. In the current study, 10 cm was large enough to lead an obvious difference. Therefore it is recommended that contaminants need to be released at exactly the same location if the two kinds of pollutants were to be studied simultaneously and compared. Comparison between Figs. 8 and 13, which demonstrate the pollutant distribution at the cross section with and without heating manikins in the cabin shows that the pollutant concentration was much higher at the top of the cabin when there were heating manikins. Note that the sources were at the same height above the chairs under same ventilation mode and similar geometry. This might indicate the phenomenon of the thermal buoyancy plumes from the passengers, which brought the pollutants up. Fig. 11 displays the velocity field in Row 2 with heating manikins. Obvious upward flow because of the thermal plume can be observed.",

On the right side of the equation, these terms are the steady state drag force (Stokes force with Re < 1 in this study), pressure force caused by accelerated flow velocity, shear stress force, Basset force caused by unsteady flow, and potential force F e , which is gravity in this case, respectively. To determine whether gravity has an obvious effect on the movement of particles, we compare the magnitude of the Stokes force and gravity force. In the cabin environment, 95% of the velocity is greater than 0.02 m s \u00c01 , and the largest velocity is about 0.5 m s \u00c01 from our measurement. Because the Stokes force decreases with velocity magnitude decrease, we compare the gravity force with Stokes force under the condition with the velocity as 0.02 m s \u00c01 (Fig. 14) . For particles with aerodynamic diameter from 0.7 mm to 10 mm, the gravity force is almost at least one order of magnitude smaller than the Stokes drag force in the cabin environment. Therefore, the effect of gravity can be reasonably neglected when compared with that of the Stokes force. Murakami et al. (1992) investigated the effects of gravitational sedimentation on the diffusion characteristic of an airborne particle in a conventional flow-type clean room. They used ethylene as a tracer gas and three types of mono-dispersed polystyrene standard particles (0.31, 1.0, and 4.5 mm in particle size with the density of 1.05 g cm \u00c03 ). A characteristic time scale was used to indicate the effect of gravitational sedimentation on the distribution. When the sedimentation time scale of airborne particles (calculated from the vertical distance from the source to the solid surface boundary and the gravitational settling velocity) was larger than or on the same order of magnitude as characteristic diffusion time scale, indicating much slower sedimentation processes, the particle fields do not differ greatly from those at a gravitational settling velocity close to zero. In our study, the sedimentation time scale of the 3 mm airborne particles is about 1850s (height of the source 0.5 m divided by gravitational settling velocity 2.7 \u00c2 10 \u00c04 m s \u00c01 ) and the diffusion time scale is about 100 s (volume of the first cabin/airflow rate of first cabin). Therefore, one can again conclude that gravity has no obvious effect on contaminant distribution.",

Non-uniform grids were applied, meaning more sampling grids should be arranged in areas with great concentration gradient (e.g. approximately within 0.3 m from the source and diffuser locations), and coarse grids can be arranged elsewhere. Note that the modified sampling grids obtained in current study should be limited to the similar cases only as particle size and ventilation type will affect the concentration distribution therefore the optimum sampling grid.
