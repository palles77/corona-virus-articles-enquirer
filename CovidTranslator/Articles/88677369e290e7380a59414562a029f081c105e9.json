Farr, MD, MSc This review was derived from the first Association for Professionals in Infection Control and Epidemiology (APIC) ''State of the Science'' lecture, which was delivered at the 30th Annual APIC Educational Conference and International Meeting in San Antonio, Texas, in June 2003. It begins with a few comments about science in general and then moves on to comments about the current state of the science in question, the epidemiology and prevention of adverse events associated with health care. It focuses on the topic that has been both the traditional and the continuing predominant focus of health care epidemiology, health care-associated infections. Of the hundreds of recent publications in this field, many were very good. In the space allotted, however, the review will necessarily cover only selected topics that will hopefully provide some insight into the current state of the science.",

            "text": "Science has been defined by Webster's Dictionary as ''systematized knowledge derived from observation, study, and experimentation carried on to determine the nature or principles of what is being studied.'' At a recent Festschrift honoring the career of my scientific mentor, Dr Jack Gwaltney, Jack's mentor Dr Bill Jordan commented on the effects of chance on science and on scientific careers. Many are aware that a Penicillium spore landed by chance on an agar plate seeded with Staphylococcus aureus by Alexander Fleming and that this led to his discovery of penicillin and the dawn of the antibiotic era. Many like to emphasize the serendipity of this finding, but Fleming had been working for years searching for anything that would inhibit S aureus like that, illustrating Pasteur's statement that ''chance favors the prepared mind.'' It has been said that science is like a mosaic, with each bit coming from an individual study. By looking at the pattern of how all the studies come together, one can see when the bulk of the evidence supports a particular hypothesis as opposed to another. I like this simile because it emphasizes the importance and interdependence of all studies, including those in the past, not unlike Newton's statement ''If I have seen further than others, it is by standing upon the shoulders of giants.''",

            "text": "Occasionally there is a major paradigm shift, however, that suddenly allows a much larger change in the mosaic. It does not necessarily negate all the data previously collected but may change the interpretation of the whole pattern. For example, Howard Margolis, 1 a professor of the history of science at the University of Chicago, believes that the explorations of Columbus and others resulting in the publication of a New World map in 1507, which showed the New World on the back side of the earth, may have resulted in Copernicus, an astronomer who studied both medicine and law as a young man, being able to take data commonly available for centuries and draw radically new conclusions. In 1543, Copernicus published his book about the solar system, De Revolutionibus, in which he said that earth was not the center of the universe but merely a planet among planets, rotating around the sun. He began the book with an apology for presenting an idea that he knew would seem absurd. He ended the book by warning philosophers and theologians not to meddle in this lest they make fools of themselves.",

            "text": "Margolis 1 says that the helicocentric hypothesis was an idea whose time had come, which turned the world of science inside out and seemed to catalyze rapid progress in science. He notes that there were major scientific accomplishments at the dawn of what some have called the scientific revolution at the beginning of the 17th century, the likes of which had not been seen in the previous 14 centuries. He also claims that all the very important discoveries were made by a small number of Copernicans, men like Galileo who embraced and were apparently inspired by what Copernicus had done. Margolis says that although Copernicans were still vastly outnumbered at this time, ''they could see that the opposition was in retreat and making a last stand in a bastion that looked ridiculous to Copernicans.'' Some have expressed concern that scientists like Copernicus sometimes ''go out on a limb'' and advocate a scientific conclusion they know to be true before it is widely accepted by the scientific community, arguing that scientists should be dispassionate and that dispassionate scientists shouldn't care whether a scientific idea is accepted or not. In an article on ''the social imperatives of medical research,'' however, Eisenberg 2 observed that ''not to act is to act.'' Table 1 shows that the history of science has, in fact, been filled with scientists advocating scientific findings that they found to be true before the scientific community was comfortable with their conclusions. Moreover, history shows that other scientists vigorously opposed these new hypotheses. For example, when Paul Lauterbur, the 2003 Nobel laureate in medicine, first published an article on magnetic resonance imaging, he said he was advised by previous Nobel laureates that magnetic resonance imaging would never work. Most of the names listed in Table 1 are probably as well-known as the hypotheses the scientists advocated. A possible exception is Barry Marshall, a recently active scientist who joined the faculty at the University of Virginia a couple of decades ago. He was derided for years for believing something that most specialists in the area considered to be absurd, that a bacterial infection could cause peptic ulcers. I added him to the list because virtually all now recognize that he was right.",

Using this method, Louis found that the time-honored practice of bloodletting, which was known to have been used for at least 24 centuries (since the time of Hippocrates), didn't work. His publication was met with controversy and dismay. It took decades for his work to be accepted as correct and the practice of bloodletting to be abandoned. Louis had many students from both Europe and America, including Oliver Wendell Holmes. Josef Skoda studied under Louis and then taught Semmelweis at the University of Vienna. Louis's numerical method is displayed in Semmelweis's 3 most famous study (Table 2) , which also required decades for acceptance by the medical community. Full acceptance and implementation of la m\u00e9thode num\u00e9rique took quite a few decades.",

The first small open trial using streptomycin showed a case fatality rate of only 50%. This was viewed as miraculous, and it became an accepted therapy with no discussion about or calculation of statistical significance. This was related to me by Dr Thomas Hunter, 4 the physician who discovered the synergy between streptomycin and penicillin for treating streptococcal endocarditis in the 1940s.",

There has been political support for investigatorinitiated grants dealing with infections, such as malaria or leishmaniasis, that occur predominantly or entirely in third world countries, but not for grants related to nosocomial infection (NI) in American hospitals. A counterexample has been the National Institutes of Health (NIH) support of a Mycosis Study Group for conducting a series of studies of therapy of various fungal infections, some of which were nosocomial. For this reason I wrote to the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases a decade ago, proposing the creation of a Nosocomial Infections Study Group that would have a budget and could distribute public funds for undertaking studies hard to manage without such funding. The reply was that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) gets all monies related to that problem area, even though at the time there was no mechanism for individual investigators to submit a grant for extramural funding. This means that funded RCTs for NIs have usually been smaller than might be optimal for statistical power considerations. It also means they have often involved funding by a corporation with a vested interest in the results and thereby may have been subject to the selection of investigators with a track record favorable to the company.",

Three recent meta-analyses compared the results of many RCTs and observational studies examining the same questions and found that the results were generally in agreement both qualitatively and quantitatively. [7] [8] [9] For example, Fig 1 offers a graph from one of these studies showing the point estimates of RCTs and observational studies for several different questions. The authors, a well-known and respected epidemiology group from Yale University, concluded that the results of observational studies did not systematically overestimate or underestimate the effects of an intervention. They also noted that there was sometimes greater variation among the results of RCTs. Some RCTs showed obviously wrong results, if the mean results of all RCTs of the question are taken as mostly likely reflecting truth. This makes it clear that a single study of either type cannot be considered definitive and that consistent results from different studies by different investigators in different populations are needed, as emphasized by Hill. Each of the 3 meta-analyses concluded that randomized trials are the design of choice but found that the data from observational studies of the same question usually yielded comparable results.",

After the New England Journal of Medicine published the study, which found that scheduled replacement of CVCs did not prevent infection and actually harmed patients, 10 it was calculated that stopping the practice would net US hospitals approximately $500 million in collective savings per year simply by avoiding the costs of routine CVC replacement, without including excess costs because of complications engendered by routine CVC replacement. In 1996, CDC issued a new guideline regarding prevention of catheter infections and strongly recommended against scheduled replacement of CVCs, citing the University of Virginia study reporting that it did not work as category IA evidence. 11 None of the studies showing that this worldwide practice didn't work were conducted by the CDC or with extramural support from CDC, illustrating the difficulty in getting answers to important questions regarding NIs.",

This suggests the need for careful scrutiny by health care epidemiologists and/or confirmatory studies. SARS is likely the biggest news story in infectious diseases epidemiology during the past year, with notable articles showing a significant association with a novel coronavirus, 16 that 77% of SARS cases in a Toronto epidemic involved NI of health care workers, 17 and that infection control measures worked when used, especially wearing masks or respirators. 18 A recent study in the Annals of Internal Medicine found that community-acquired BSI were now frequently health care-associated and that the mortality of such cases was similar to that of nosocomial BSI and higher than for other community-acquired BSI. 19 Four studies in the New England Journal of Medicine were included in the review. The first reported that nurse staffing in general and RN staffing in particular were inversely correlated with risk for multiple adverse outcomes, including infections and deaths from infections (pneumonia or sepsis). 20 The second article reported that a manufacturer's recall of a bronchoscope with a defective part linked to ineffective disinfection led to recognition of a sizable outbreak of Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections and possibly 3 deaths in 1 hospital. 21 The hospital's outbreak stopped with the recall. The third article described 1 of the 2 vancomycin-resistant S aureus cases reported in the United States during 2002. 22 Pulsed field gel electrophoresis showed the patient's vancomycin-resistant S aureus to be identical to the methicillin-resistant S aureus (MRSA) of the patient and her friend. Polymerase chain reaction revealed vanA, which on sequencing was identical to the vanA in the patient's Vancomycinresistant Enterococcus isolate and in transposon TN 1546. The minimal inhibitory concentration to vancomycin was 1,024 mg/mL, and the authors concluded that ''this finding underscores the importance of extending efforts to prevent and reduce spread of MRSA.'' The fourth article reported the results of an RCT of prophylactic intranasal mupirocin to prevent postoperative S aureus infections. 23 It found no significant surgical-site infection (SSI) prevention, but power was only 75.6%; among S aureus carriers there was a strong trend toward SSI prevention, and overall postoperative S aureus infections were reduced significantly. Multiple prior RCTs of mupirocin prophylaxis have shown significant prevention of dialysis-related infections. There also have been multiple observational studies with both surgical and dialysis patients, suggesting significant prevention.",

Clone W caused infections in 10 of the 12 hospitals. The second study reported that a selective mannitol broth offered a ''convenient, inexpensive, sensitive method for high throughput screening for MRSA.'' 29 A third study reported rates of invasive aspergillosis in Paris hospitals. 30 There was no seasonal variation, and crude mortality was 63%. Incidence was 8% in patients with acute myelogenous leukemia, 6% with ALL, 13% after allogeneic stem cell transplant, 1% after autologous stem cell transplant, 11% after heart-lung transplant, and 0.4% after kidney transplant. The fourth study reported molecular typing of Aspergillus fumigatus isolates but reported inability to locate the environmental reservoir for patient infections despite finding many A fumigatus isolates from the environment. 31 A fifth article examined risk and prognostic factors for candidemia. 32 Catheter removal was associated with higher survival (71% vs. 47% when the catheter was not removed). Septic shock occurred in 17%. The sixth study reported a significant decrease in infection in an intensive care unit that continued for years after hiring a dedicated infection control professional for that unit. Infection rates were reduced by 42% over 3 years and 33% over 5 years. 33 Eight studies from the American Journal of Infection Control were included in the review. The first showed repeatedly that when surveillance cultures and contact precautions were implemented VRE rates fell significantly, and when they were withdrawn rates increased significantly. 34 This showed both reversibility and specificity for control with this approach, 2 of Bradford Hill's criteria for causality. Use of standard precautions was the control measure that did not work repeatedly for controlling VRE spread. The second article described an Italian study reporting a two thirds reduction in MRSA infections in a unit undergoing an MRSA epidemic after enteral vancomycin was used to suppress MRSA colonization. 35 Neither VRE nor VISA was isolated from surveillance or diagnostic samples.",

A second study showed that an intraoperative time alert from a computer resulted in a significantly higher rate of redosing when indicated, as recommended by national guidelines. 43 The third study reported 28 hepatitis B infections of patients from a hepatitis B-infected surgeon over a 4-year period. 44 The surgeon was found to have been carrying hepatitis B at a high level for at least a decade before transmissions began to be recognized. Of note, transmission occurred during both low-and high-risk surgical procedures. A fourth study summarized the documented cases of occupational HIV infection during the first 20 years of the HIV epidemic in the United States, including some despite postexposure prophylaxis. 45 A graph in the article showed that transmission to health care workers has been greatly reduced with current control measures. A fifth study suggested that mupirocin doesn't work to eradicate mupirocin-resistant MRSA. 46 The authors strongly suggested susceptibility testing. The sixth was another study finding that VRE rates were significantly reduced when both gowns and gloves were worn for care of VRE patients, as compared with when gloves only were worn. 47 This study also showed a significant decrease in clonal VRE spread. The seventh study showed a 38-fold higher frequency of nosocomial clonal spread of MRSA when patients were not detected by screening cultures and placed into contact precautions. 48 This suggests that standard precautions cannot be relied upon to control nosocomial MRSA spread even in a country like the Netherlands, with optimum antibiotic control and perhaps better overall compliance with hand hygiene.",

            "text": "More than 750 studies have been published annually in scores of medical journals regarding health carerelated infections and have yielded much valuable information. The number has increased in recent years with the arrival of new issues such as smallpox vaccination of health care workers for bioterror preparedness and SARS and monkeypox outbreaks. Nevertheless, there remain significant challenges to the state of the science. Relatively few governmental sources exist for funding of independent, investigatorinitiated grants for research regarding the epidemiology, prevention, or management of health care-related infections. As a result, most of aforementioned studies have been conducted on a shoestring budget, using the existing resources of individual hospitals. Many hospitals have recently reduced their support for infection control, and some weren't investing that much to start with. The APIC Research Foundation has traditionally funded very small grants (ie, of a size unlikely to definitively address any question). The CDC has recently advertised the creation of a new office that may someday soon begin accepting grants for conducting research on NIs. The NIH has recently expanded the Mycosis Study Group to include studies of bacterial infections, but has funded very few grants on this topic. The most important resource has been the people in this field who have done a great deal of work over the past 3 decades with very little financial support.",
