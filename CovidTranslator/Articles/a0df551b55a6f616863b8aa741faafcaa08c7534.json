Seven effect size metrics were compared for single case design (SCD) data focused on teaching speech generating device use to individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD) with moderate to profound levels of impairment. The effect size metrics included percent of data points exceeding the median (PEM), percent of nonoverlapping data (PND), improvement rate difference (IRD), percent of all nonoverlapping data (PAND), Phi, nonoverlap of all pairs (NAP), and Tau novlap . Results showed that among the seven effect size metrics, PAND, Phi, IRD, and PND were more effective in quantifying intervention effects for the data sample (N = 285 phase or condition contrasts). Results are discussed with respect to issues concerning extracting and calculating effect sizes, visual analysis, and SCD intervention research in IDD.",

In the specific area of speech generating device (SGD) interventions for individuals with IDD with moderate to profound levels of impairment, for example, the population is extremely heterogeneous. This has resulted in a preponderance of single case design (SCD) studies for which there is not a standard effect size metric. In this article, we used the results from SCD SGD intervention studies as a vehicle to further evaluate different non-parametric effect size metrics from SCD studies. Our rationale was, in part, pragmatic. That is, the literature specific to SGD and severe disabilities is a manageable literature. Additionally, SGDs represent an area of a relatively rapid growth with tablet-based systems emerging and proliferating (Kuster, 2012; McNaughton & Light, 2013) . In the following sections we provide a brief overview of the literature addressing SGD and SCD. Subsequently, we provide a rationale for the SCD effect size comparisons that were conducted.",

To accomplish this, we identified and compared seven effect size metrics that were previously reported on by : PEM, PND, IRD, PAND, Phi, NAP, and Tau novlap . In the current investigation we chose to focus on non-parametric effect size metrics because they are more often used in practice by analyzing the overlap of data points across phases as compared to parametric effect size metrics (Maggin et al., 2011; Shadish et al., 2014) . Additionally, the calculation of non-parametric effect size metrics is more aligned with the advocacy for a \"bottom-up\" approach to analysis of SCD data in comparison to a \"topdown\" approach (Parker & Vannest, 2012) . Specifically, the bottom-up approach refers to combining data from individual phase contrasts to form one or more effect size metrics that represent the entire design; whereas the top-down approach refers to using data from the entire design to form an omnibus effect size metric by use of statistical models, such as hierarchical modeling, randomization, or complex multiseries regression (Parker & Vannest, 2012) . Therefore, although top-down models seem promising, the bottom-up approach is advocated for use given its easier accessibility for interventionists and behavior analysts, higher consistency with the logic of visual analysis, and more intuitive and meaningful results (Parker & Vannest, 2012) .",

Six electronic databases were searched including: Academic Search Premier, Education Resources Information Center (ERIC; Access via CSA), PsychINFO, Medline (Ovid), Education Full Text, and LLBA (Linguistics & Language Behavior Abstracts). The search was limited to English-language peer-reviewed studies published between 1985 and 2013. Historically, SGDs have been referred to by a variety of terms, including voice output communication aid (Olive et al., 2007) , VOCA (e.g., Sigafoos, Drasgow, et al., 2004) , and voice output device (e.g., Dicarlo & Banajee, 2000) . In other sources, no specific term was used to describe the device itself. Instead, the SGD was referred to as assistive technology (e.g., Kagohara, 2010) , or by the method it was accessed by the communicator such as microswitch (e.g., Lancioni et al., 2006) . To ensure that a sufficiently broad search was conducted, six separate multiword search terms were entered into each database including speech generating device, voice output communication aid, voice output device, VOCA and assistive technology, communication device and assistive technology, and microswitch and communication.",

The median number of data points per phase or condition contrast was 15, and the interquartile range (IQR) was 8 to 22. The median number of data points in Phase A (i.e., the baseline condition) was 5 (IQR: 3-9), and in Phase B (i.e., the intervention condition) was 8 (IQR: 4-16).

Although the PlotDigitizer \u00ae software identifies values up to the 5 th decimal place, values of each dependent measure were rounded to the decimal place that was reported in the original study. For instance, if a target dependent measure of the frequency of requests was reported using a whole number in a study, the data extracted through PlotDigitizer \u00ae were also rounded to the whole number. Additionally, if the original data were graphed in a cumulative manner (e.g., Sigafoos & Drasgow, 2001 , sessions two through 28), the cumulative data were extracted through PlotDigitizer \u00ae and then the data were further transformed into noncumulative data by subtracting the first session data from the second session, subtracting the second session data from the third session, and so on, until only the data for each respective session were obtained.",

Additionally, if one intervention condition involving SGD use was superior to other condition(s) and then a final phase was implemented involving continued use of the superior condition alone, data from the final phase were not extracted for analysis. For data extraction and later effect size metric computations of between-condition comparisons, the condition involving the use of an SGD served as the intervention condition whereas the condition involving no use of an SGD was considered as the baseline condition.

The core research question in comparison designs is to compare the effects of different intervention conditions (Barlow & Hayes, 1979) . Thus, conducting a visual analysis for the comparison of different intervention conditions and comparing that analysis with the results of effect size metrics for the condition contrasts was conceptually aligned with our research questions.",

The first group included PAND, Phi, IRD, and PND, and the second included NAP, Tau novlap , and PEM. Consequently, for meta-analyses of SCD intervention studies, once the choice between these two groups has been made; the specific effect size metric chosen may be a somewhat less important methodological decision. For instance, some existing meta-analyses in the field (e.g., Branson & Demchak, 2009; Millar, Light, & Schlosser, 2006; Schlosser & Wendt, 2008; Stephenson & Limbrick, 2013) used PND as the effect size metric whereas others (e.g., Ganz et al., 2012) used IRD as the effect size metric. The relatively high correlation between PND and IRD in the current study provided some evidence that the results from these meta-analyses may be comparable in terms of quantifying effect size.",

            "text": "In this study, NAP was less correlated with PAND (r = .7 for the dataset that only involved phase contrasts and .4 for the dataset that included condition contrasts). This result was not consistent with results reported by in which NAP and PAND were highly correlated (r = .9). Given that the correlation between NAP and PAND differed across the two datasets (i.e., studies with and without intervention comparisons) in the current study, it is reasonable to suspect that the correlations among effect size metrics may vary as a function of the data samples selected for effect size analysis and this may explain the differences between the results reported by and the current study. Notably, used data obtained through a convenience sample of published studies, whereas the data for the current study was obtained through a systematic search of a specific content area that was known to include a diversity of SCDs that compare clinically relevant interventions (i.e., they require alternating treatment designs). did not include alternating treatment designs in their convenience sample, whereas the data sample in the current study included both SCDs that only had phase contrasts, as well as alternating treatment designs with condition contrasts. Therefore, the degree to which specific, highly correlated effect size metrics are interchangeable may at least partly depend on how the dataset is selected. (Figure 1 & Figure 2 ) should be considered with caution. Visual analysis results for each study suggest the possibility of publication bias. None of the 45 studies examined for this investigation were judged as having no intervention effect, only five were judged as having a small effect, and 40 were judged as having a large intervention effect. Due to potential publication bias toward studies yielding positive intervention effects (Ickowicz, 2014) and the general characteristics of SCD research (Wolery, Dunlap, & Ledford, 2011) , it is unlikely that the results of the seven effect size metrics were normally distributed. Overall, the analysis of the uniform probability plot for the seven effect size metrics revealed that none of the seven effect size metrics fully discriminated intervention effects ranging from a very small to very large magnitude. In particular, at around 60 th to 80 th percentile, the maximum had been reached. However, when the dataset was comprised of both phase and condition contrasts, the relative superiority among these effect size metrics in discriminating intervention effects became more clear. This finding suggests that the discriminability of these metrics may be also a function of the data sample and design selected. When only phase contrasts were included, due to potential publication bias, there seemed to be little room for the effect size metrics to reflect their discrimination ranges. When condition contrasts were included, there seemed to be more room for these effect size metrics to show their capacity in discriminating intervention effects of different magnitude. One potential reason might be that performance data from condition contrasts comparing two different interventions may provide more variable data sets than those generated by phase contrasts in which no intervention is compared to an intervention, the latter likely contribute to publication bias in favor of studies featuring phase contrasts of high magnitude with less variability.",

While there was still some evidence of ceiling effect, this difference suggested that these effect size metrics may be better able to discriminate intervention effects of small to moderate magnitude. One explanation for this finding is related to the limits of non-parametric overlap-based effect size metrics in differentiating the magnitude of intervention effects when two phase or condition contrasts have the same data overlap patterns (Gast & Ledford, 2014; Wolery et al., 2010) . For example, consider an intervention study in which two participants obtained the same baseline data of 0, 1, 1, 0, 0. The intervention data for one participant were 6, 7, 5, 7, 6, and the intervention data for the second participant were 60, 70, 50, 70, 60. Clearly, the magnitude of the change between baseline and intervention was greater for the second participant. Because overlap is the major consideration when computing a non-parametric effect size metric, the same effect size would be obtained for both the first and second participants. Consequently, non-parametric, overlap-based effect size metrics may more accurately be referred to as effect size estimators (Shadish, Rindskopf, & Hedges, 2008) and this limitation of overlap-based effect size metrics may help explain the results revealed by the probability distributions in the current study.",

Their uniform probability distributions seemed to be closer to the diagonal line, especially through the 60 th or 80 th percentile (see Figure 1 and Figure 2 ; these results were similar to . That is, although IRD and Phi were also limited in differentiating among the large intervention effects, they seemed to be the most effective in differentiating the intervention effects of small to moderate magnitude. Thus, IRD and Phi may be more promising metrics in terms of their ability to differentiate intervention effect magnitude. (2007) suggested that given the holistic nature of visual analysis as well as its historical significance for SCD research, statistical analysis would not be a substitute for visual analysis but could augment it. From this perspective, the utility of effect size metrics for SCD research is partly dependent upon whether the inferences about intervention effects from the two analysis approaches are in agreement at a high level. In this study, the cutoff scores for each effect size metric to differentiate large versus small intervention effects in accordance with visual analysis results ranged from .47 for Tau novlap to .77 for PAND. Notably, our cutoff score for NAP was .73 which was lower than the .96 cutoff score reported by Petersen-Brown et al. (2012) who used the same computation procedure. This may suggest that cutoff scores might also be influenced by the data sample selected. That said, when cutoff scores were identified using this procedure, most of the effect size metrics (i.e., all of them except PEM) corresponded well with the visual analysis findings. In particular, IRD corresponded best with visual analysis findings, having the highest kappa coefficient of .67, followed by PAND and Phi which both had kappa coefficients of .56.",

First, prior to conducting meta-analyses to inform EBP in a particular content area, the rationale for selecting any one particular effect size metric should be established because different metrics may lead to different conclusions. Second, although the general effect size metric comparison research may provide us with some confidence in utilizing certain effect size metric(s) for metaanalyses, it is likely that the results from the extant comparison research studies may not be readily generalizable. In particular, a majority of the comparison research was based on convenience samples of published studies, which is not the case for meta-analyses that require systematic searches. Third, there may be \"subsets\" of effect metrics within which the effect sizes may be comparable and interchangeable, as shown in the current data sample. Knowing that some SCD effect sizes may be comparable or interchangeable, could create some confidence in lining up and interpreting the results from meta-analyses for SGD interventions involving SCD studies.",

In the current study, we defined the condition involving no use or less complex or sophisticated use of SGDs as the baseline, while the condition involving the use or more complex or sophisticated use of SGDs as the intervention condition. In this manner, we were able to apply the same analysis procedures that have been commonly applied to phase contrasts.

It may be helpful to explore whether similar findings would be found for other curricular areas. Second, our findings are specific to the metrics we evaluated. Future work should systematically address the relative performance of other effect size metrics, including parametric effect size metrics such as ANOVA-based procedures like Cohen's d and Hedges's g.

However, we did not appraise the degree of experimental control in each of the included studies, nor the EBP status of the SGD field. To investigate whether the practice of SGD interventions for individuals with IDD is evidencebased, some systematic methods for evaluating EBP associated with SCD studies are available, such as the procedural and coding manual for review of evidence-based interventions outlined by the Task Force on Evidence-Based Interventions in School Psychology of American Psychological Association (2002), and the What Works Clearinghouse (WWC) standards for SCD studies (Kratochwill et al., 2010) . The WWC standards, for example, suggest that for a literature base to be determined as scientifically validated, it needs to be gauged against standards in terms of design, visual analysis, quantitative measurement, and replication (Kratochwill et al., 2010; Maggin, Briesch, & Chafouleas, 2013) . Although we acknowledge these procedures for standardizing the EBP evaluation, the present study did not seek to validate the evidence status for the SGD field and instead only examined effect size. For instance, effect size metrics were computed for data from ABA designs, which does not meet the WWC standard of three intra-individual replications. In part, this was because including effect size metrics pertaining only to studies that meet predetermined standards and demonstrate strong experimental control may bring about other limitations (Manolov, Sierra, Solanas, & Botella, 2014; Nickerson, 2000) . Because our focus was on the comparison of effect size metrics, we hope our results may inform one aspect of the EBP evaluation for SCD studies, that is, quantifying effects.",
