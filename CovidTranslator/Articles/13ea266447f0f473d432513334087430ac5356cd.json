[1] [2] [3] [4] [5] Though the incidence of these infections in hematopoietic cell transplantation patients usually parallels that in the community, their course can be more severe with progression to lower respiratory tract infection, co-infection with serious pulmonary co-pathogens such as invasive molds, and late airflow decline. 3, [6] [7] [8] Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation with non-myeloablative or reduced-intensity conditioning regimens is an increasingly common modality in patients who because of age or co-morbidity are not eligible for conventional transplantation. [9] [10] [11] Non-myeloablative conditioning regimens achieve engraftment with less toxicity and host hematopoietic cells are not immediately eradicated. This potentially allows for a period of protection against infections commonly seen in hematopoietic cell transplantation patients treated with standard intensity conditioning; patients who are placed on non-myeloablative protocols are more frequently followed as outpatients than patients undergoing myeloablative transplantation. However, graft-versus-host disease and its therapies continue to be significant risk factors for invasive cytomegalovirus and fungal infection in patients undergoing non-myeloablative transplantation, particularly in the late period after conditioning. 12, 13 It is unknown whether non-myeloablative conditioning has an effect on acquisition of respiratory virus infection, likelihood of respiratory virus associated lower tract infection, risk of progression of disease from upper to lower tract infection, or mortality rate associated with respiratory virus infection. We performed a retrospective cohort study to measure the incidence and severity of these infections in myeloablative versus non-myeloablative hematopoietic cell transplantation patients.",

This signified a limited duration of protective immunity in non-myeloablative cohorts The transition from a preponderance of early-onset to lateonset infections has been described for invasive fungi 12 and cytomegalovirus. 13 Parainfluenza infection accounted for the statistical difference between the two cohorts and was the most common virus isolated. High doses of corticosteroids for graft versus host disease and lymphopenia were risk factors for progression from parainfluenza upper to lower tract infection, perhaps due to a decrease in Tcell immunity. 7 In our current analysis, corticosteroid dose did not correlate with progression to lower tract infection, possibly based on our policy to attempt to reduce steroid doses in patients infected with parainfluenza that was introduced following analysis of our earlier cohort. 7 Another risk factor for lower tract infection was parainfluenza type-1 infection (rather than type 3). Though more clinical data are needed to confirm this finding, it was a novel observation and might suggest that factors related to pathogen, and not just host, predict severity of disease.",

Patients who developed respiratory syncitial virus infection were less likely to die from this infection than patients with parainfluenza or influenza, possibly due to early therapy with inhaled ribavirin and palivizumab, 25 though this should be interpreted with caution based on the small number of lower tract infection patients in the cohort. Strengths of our analysis include large sample size and standardized diagnostic approach for all hematopoietic cell transplantation patients with respiratory symptoms. Limitations included its retrospective nature and use of only conventional diagnostic tests that lack the sensitivity of polymerase chain reaction, as well as the lack of a quantitative assay as a measure of disease severity. The exclusion of other respiratory viruses that are detected with PCR (such as human metapneumovirus and coronavirus) is another weakness. Routine molecular testing for these viruses or the viruses included in our study, including quantitative measures, was not routinely performed in our center or elsewhere during the time period of this retrospective cohort.

Respiratory virus lower tract infection had high co-infection and mortality rates. Screening for respiratory viruses should continue in all hematopoietic cell transplantation patients, although for patients on non-myeloablative protocols, the likelihood of developing a respiratory virus lower tract infection was very low during the first 100 days after hematopoietic cell transplantation. The low risk of progression to lower tract infection among nonmyeloablative transplantation recipients suggests the intriguing possibility of using this conditioning regimen in patients who develop respiratory virus disease before transplantation. In such cases, delay of transplantation until resolution of infections is currently recommended, especially for infections due to respiratory syncitial virus, parainfluenza, and influenza. 26 However, this delay may increase the risk of progression of the underlying hematologic malignancy. Thus, non-myeloablative conditioning may provide a safer alternative if transplantation is urgent. An evaluation of this approach is needed.",
