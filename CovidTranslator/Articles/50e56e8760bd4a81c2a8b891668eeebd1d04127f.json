(Thormar and Hilmarsson, 2007) and (Churchward et al., 2018) . Previously, (Thormar et al., 1987) demonstrated the antiviral effects of 14 different free fatty acids and lipid extracts from human milk against vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), herpes simplex virus (HSV) and visna virus revealed that short chain saturated fatty acids (butyric, caproic and caprylic) together with long chain saturated fatty acids (palmitic and stearic) had no or very little antiviral activity, whereas medium chain saturated entities including capric, lauric, myristic and long chain unsaturated oleic, linoleic and linolenic acids were anti-viral, albeit at different concentrations. Another study (Hilmarsson et al., 2005) reported similar trends in the antiviral activity of six medium chain fatty acids together with their alcohol and mono-glyceride derivatives against herpes simplex viruses 1 and 2. In contrast, Dichtelmuller et al (2002) reported that caprylic acid had antiviral activity against enveloped viruses including human immunodeficiency virus, bovine viral diarrhoea virus, Sindbis virus and pseudorabies virus (Dichtelmuller et al., 2002 , Pingen et al., 2016 . Studies investigating the antiviral properties of whole milk reported no antiviral properties of fresh human milk, whereas milk that had been stored at 4 o C possessed potent antiviral activity against several viruses in vitro. Refrigeration disrupts the milk fat globule membrane allowing ingress of milk serum lipase which results in hydrolysis of milk fat triglyceride (Thormar et al., 1987 , Isaacs et al., 1990 .

Caprylic acid delivered in the ViroSAL emulsion exhibited significant anti-viral effects. A range of enveloped viral infection systems was utilized, and complete inhibition of viral infection was observed without any evidence of cytotoxicity. ViroSAL had no effect on the infectivity of a non-enveloped virus, norovirus, which is in agreement with previous studies demonstrating that free fatty acids are ineffective against nonenveloped viruses (Thormar et al., 1987 , Kohn et al., 1980 . Furthermore, ViroSAL inactivated the enveloped mosquito-borne viruses Semliki Forest virus (SFV) and Zika virus (ZIKV) in vitro. Prophylactic topical treatment of viral infection in mosquito bites with ViroSAL inhibited local replication and dissemination of SFV and plasma levels of ZIKV in mice. Transmission electron microscopy analysis indicated that ViroSAL disrupts orf parapoxvirus envelope integrity, with higher concentrations completely disrupting virion morphology. These data indicate that ViroSAL has antiviral activity against a range of enveloped viruses in vitro and in vivo.",

Following immediate restoration of physiological pH, solution was applied to monolayers of BHK-21 cells and infectious titre assessed by plaque assay. As a control SFV6 was incubated similarly at pH5.5 in the absence of ViroSAL. The amount of infectious SFV was reduced to beyond the limit of detection by ViroSAL, suggesting this virus is highly sensitive to treatment (Supplementary Figure 2) . Similarly, when ViroSAL treated SFV6 was inoculated subcutaneously into mice, the titre of virus at 24 hours post infection was significantly reduced (Supplementary Figure 2) . We next determined whether topical application of ViroSAL can also suppress virus infection when virus was inoculated subcutaneously into a mosquito bite. In this experiment, ViroSAL was applied immediate post mosquito bite and left for 20 minutes to allow penetration of skin by ViroSAL, or left untreated as a control. SFV was then inoculated subcutaneously into the mosquito bite as previously described (Pingen et al., 2016) . Re-application of ViroSAL to the inoculation site was repeated at 5 hours post infection. At 24 hours post infection, those mice receiving ViroSAL had a significantly reduced amount of virus RNA at the inoculation/bite site and limited dissemination of virus to the spleen 24 hours post infection ( Figure 6A ).",

We observed a significant concentration-and time-dependent (rapid) decrease in infectivity of all enveloped viruses tested in the present study, with no effect on non-enveloped norovirus.

Moreover, Isaacs (Isaacs et al., 1990) reported no antiviral activity of human milk or milk formula, but potent antiviral activity of milk aspirated from the stomachs of infants one hour after feeding, which occurred due to the release of free fatty acids by lipolysis. Similar observations were reported by Thormar et al. (Thormar et al., 1994) , after lipolysis by storage of human milk at 4\u00b0C.",

ViroSAL has optimal activity at pH5.5 and is consequently suitable for use in environments close to this pH, such as skin, oral cavity and mucous membranes which are also relevant portals of infection. The present study demonstrated that ViroSAL has antiviral activity against HSV-1, EBV and orf viruses, all of which are pathogens of skin or mucous membranes and have a tropism for epithelial cells. Since ViroSAL has optimal activity at pH5.5, we also tested a range of epithelial cell systems that would physiologically have a lower pH than that of plasma, such as skin which has a pH of approximately 5 (Lambers et al., 2006) and the oral cavity which can have a pH of 6.5 or lower depending on the level of oral health. ViroSAL had strong antiviral activity against Semliki Forest and Zika viruses, which are transmitted via mosquitoes into the skin dermis. This is an important stage of the virus life cycle, in which it replicates in dermal cells before disseminating to the blood and then throughout the body (Hamel et al., 2015; Pingen et al., 2017) .",

ViroSAL, therefore, has potential applications as a topical or inhaled therapy to treat epitheliotropic viral infections or those that infect the airway or other mucous membranes. The fact that ViroSAL has applications against a wide range of enveloped viruses is of great interest, and while many antivirals have activity against specific viral families, there are few broad-spectrum antivirals currently available.
