            "text": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) was the first natural disaster that challenged the Chinese people at the beginning of the twenty-first century. It was caused by a novel animal coronavirus, never recognized or characterized before. This SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV ) exploited opportunities provided by 'wet markets' in southern China to adapt to the palm civet and human. Under the positive selection pressure of human host, certain mutated lineages of the virus became readily transmissible between humans and thus caused the epidemic of 2002-2003. This review will provide first-hand information, particularly from Guangdong, China, about the initial epidemiology, the identification of the aetiological agent of the disease, the molecular evolution study of the virus, the finding of SARS-like CoV in horseshoe bats and the mechanistic analysis for the cross-host tropism transition. The substantial scientific contributions made by the Chinese scientists towards understanding the virus and the disease will be emphasized. Along with the description of the scientific discoveries and analyses, the significant impact of these researches upon the public health measurement or regulations will be highlighted. It is aimed to appreciate the concerted and coordinated global response that controlled SARS within a short period of time as well as the research strategy and methodology developed along with this process, which can be applied in response to other public health challenges, particularly the future emerging/re-merging infectious diseases.",

Although patriotic revolutionaries and reforms have dramatically changed China since then, the beginning of the twenty-first century was not easy either. Besides other difficulties, a new 'plague', originally called 'atypical pneumonia' and later designated as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), emerging in the southeastern Guangdong Province of China in November 2002, was one of the most serious natural disasters that unexpectedly challenged the Chinese people.",

He transmitted an infection to 16 other guests during his stay . These, in turn, seeded outbreaks of the disease in Hong Kong, Toronto, Singapore and Vietnam (CDCP 2003) . Within weeks, atypical pneumonia had spread to affect more than 8000 people in 25 countries and regions across five continents ( World Health Organization ( WHO), http://www.who.int/csr/sars/country/table2004_04_21/ en/index.html). By the end of the global outbreak (5 July 2003), it had killed 774 people. Although it is a small number in comparison with the fatalities during the previous pandemics of plague and influenza, as a novel infectious disease with unknown aetiological agent, but rapidly spread by air travel at the beginning of the epidemic, the panic thus caused was enormous. With today's globalization of economic activity, this panic eventually caused far more pronounced impact of this epidemic than any previous ones. It was estimated by the Asian Development Bank (November 2003) that the global economic loss was 59 billion USD with 17.9 billion USD of Mainland China (approx. 1.3% of its annual gross domestic product (GDP), a 0.7% decrease in the GDP growth rate) and 12 billion USD of Hong Kong (approx. 7.6% of its annual GDP).",

The clinical syndrome was quickly described (Lee et al. 2003; Poutanen et al. 2003; Tsang et al. 2003) and the viral aetiological agent was identified (Drosten et al. 2003a; Ksiazek et al. 2003; Peiris et al. 2003b) . With this knowledge, diagnostic tests were devised (Drosten et al. 2003a; Poon et al. 2003 ) and the genome of the virus was completely sequenced (Marra et al. 2003; Rota et al. 2003) . Meanwhile, epidemiology studies (Lipsitch et al. 2003; Riley et al. 2003) indicated the effectiveness of public health intervention strategy and thus supported the corresponding administrative measures enforced by the government, which eventually proved to be successful. Just one and a half years later, the first phase 1 vaccine trials are underway, and several other vaccine candidates are under evaluation in animal models (Enserink 2004) . It was a triumph for global public health and provided a new paradigm for the detection and control of future threats caused by emerging infectious diseases.",

A more detailed review emphasizing the aspects of pathogenesis and their correlation to clinical outcome and discussing the progress that has been made towards antiviral treatment and vaccine development is also available . Because I was deeply involved in the molecular epidemiology studies of this disease and had an opportunity to contact many Chinese scientists, physicians and public health workers during the research, I would like to share my knowledge with readers about the real epidemic story and the research efforts made in China, especially, in Guangdong Province, where the disease initiated. I hope that, through reading this review, people of the world may realize how the Chinese scientists together with the public health and medical workers of this largest developing country, considered being 'defeated' at the early stage of the combat against SARS (Enserink 2003) , found their way to quickly understand and control an emerging zoonotic epidemic in the genomics era.",

Although atypical pneumonia was no surprise to medical experts, this particular case was considered unique owing to its propensity to cause clusters of disease in families and healthcare workers (Zhong & Zeng 2003) .

Therefore, only the average number (0.5) was used as the contribution made by the secondary cases. d Because SQS and ZZF were together in Hospital HZS-2 for a few days, it is difficult to clearly identify the transmission path. Therefore, estimates were made by the staff of HZS-2 Hospital according to the contact history and the onset dates of the patients for the secondary, tertiary and quaternary infections.

Because all the viral sequences of the HZS-2 Hospital isolates were basically the same, it could be inferred that ZZF was the original host of the outbreak virus of the HZS-2 Hospital, although the genotype of SQS's virus is still unknown. Therefore, unless the viral genotype of the brothers of Shunde is the same as ZZF's, the majority of the secondary infections should have been caused by ZZF.

Based on the pathogenesis and epidemiological studies, a detailed and logical case definition was developed and the incubation period was estimated as 1-12 days (average 4.5 days). It was particularly important at that time to recognize that no infectivity was detected in patients at the stage of incubation or convalescence. These parameters are critical for a public health strategy designed for SARS prevention and control. In fact, the first active public health surveillance and report system for SARS was established and implemented throughout Guangdong Province on 3 February 2003, which was the first daily zero case report system for SARS, as well as the first local SARS surveillance and report system being set up worldwide (figure 2; Fang et al. 2003; He et al. 2003b; Peng et al. 2003; Qin et al. 2003b; Wang et al. 2003b; Zhou et al. 2003; Xu et al. 2004a ).

Although we observed a similar situation almost 10 months later in the same region, it is significant to realize and characterize the early phase of the epidemic by a series of seemingly independent cases, with scattered but limited geographical distribution and limited transmission/infectivity (Chinese 2004) . On the basis of these epidemiological investigations, we divided the course of the epidemic into early, middle and late phases (Chinese 2004) . The early phase is defined as the period from the first emergence of SARS to the first documented SSE of the HZS-2 Hospital of Guangzhou at the end of January, as previously described. The middle phase refers to the ensuing events up to the first cluster of SARS cases in a hotel (hotel M) in Hong Kong, while cases following this cluster fall into the late phase.",

Quantitative studies of viral load have provided insights into the pathogenesis of SARS. Viral load is higher in the lower respiratory tract than in the upper airways Drosten et al. 2004) . Viral load in the upper respiratory tract (Peiris et al. 2003a ) and faeces is low during the first 4 days and peaks at around day 10 of the illness. In marked contrast, viral load in influenza peaks soon after the onset of clinical symptoms (Kaiser et al. 1999) . This unusual feature of SARS-CoV infection explains its low transmissibility early in the illness. In addition, RT-PCR has identified the virus in the serum, plasma and peripheral blood leucocytes Ng et al. 2003) . Thus, the first-generation RT-PCR diagnostic tests on the upper respiratory tract and faecal specimens collected early in the illness had very low sensitivity , and many laboratories (R. W. Chiu & Y. M. Lo, 2004, personal communication) as well as our experiences have indicated that faecal samples collected during the middle phase of the illness are ideal sources for SARS-CoV isolation and detection, particularly for patients with mild symptoms.",

Using a specially developed immunosorbent assay, they were able to establish N-protein concentrations in the samples. The approach resulted in a test specificity of 99.9%. The technique could be used in medical centres lacking sophisticated equipment and in mass screening to track the origins of SARS (Khamsi 2004) .

Meanwhile, the complete genome of strain BJ01, an isolate related to the Shanxi index patient hospitalized in Beijing (refer to \u00a72 of this review for detailed description of the case), was sequenced by Beijing Genomics Institute (BGI), Chinese Academy of Sciences (Qin 2003) . Immediately following, the genome of strain GD01 (originally designated GZ01), isolated from the first autopsy sample of Guangdong (refer to the first paragraph of \u00a73 of this review for detailed description of the autopsy) was completely sequenced by the Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology, Chinese Academy of Military Medical Sciences (Qin et al. 2003a) , while other isolates of the BJ group, two isolates related to the Shanxi index patient, BJ02 and BJ03, and one isolate (BJ04) from the lung autopsy of one of the early patients of the HZS-2 Hospital SSE outbreak, Guangzhou (the ambulance driver for patients of SGQ/SQS brothers and ZZF of the HZS-2 Hospital; refer to \u00a72 about the patients' information), were sequenced by the BGI (unpublished personal communication, 2003; Bi et al. 2003) . Among these 'first-round' sequencing efforts, it is also important to emphasize the contributions made by Hong Kong and Singapore scientists. In particular, the Singapore group promptly recognized the significance of employing the limited sequence information with accurate epidemiology information to trace the genotypic variation of the viral transmission paths (Ruan et al. 2003) . They also established the practical methodology, which allowed the efficient usage of cell cultured or partially sequenced SARS-CoV genomic sequences.",

A zoologist, Shuyi Zhang, of the Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences also arrived in Guangzhou. Based on his knowledge about zoonotic diseases, he speculated that warm-blooded animals were probably the origins of SARS-CoV and was happy to learn that the Ministry of Agriculture and the Guangdong Province had collaborated in searching for SARS-like coronaviruses from animals. With his expertise in personal interviews/surveys, he contacted as many early patients as possible. Meanwhile, as a member of the special expert envoy sent by the Task Force Group for Science and Technology Research (TFGSTR) under the State Council to Guangdong and Hong Kong, I had a chance to review the detailed epidemiology records made by the CDCP of Guangdong and some related information in Hong Kong, which I summarized previously. It is clear that many of the affected individuals in November and December 2002 had contact with the live-game trade, including restaurants serving exotic animal dishes (Xu et al. 2004a) . The lack of serological evidence of previous infection in healthy humans suggested that SARS-CoV had recently emerged in the human population and that animal-to-human interspecies transmission seemed the most probable explanation for its emergence.",

Although it was then a popular idea to sequence hundreds of SARS-CoV genomes from strains isolated from Beijing, Hong Kong and Taiwan to understand the rule of the viral evolution (figure 5), I realized that it would be difficult, not only due to the lack of proper samples, but also due to the lack of detailed, consistent and accurate biological information useful for the analysis. On the other hand, I learned that the CDCP of Guangdong Province, with the help of CDCP of Guangzhou and local hospitals, collected samples from the very early days of the epidemic and these samples could well be associated with the epidemiological information of the patients. I discussed this idea with the senior epidemiologists in Guangzhou, as well as with some young scientists working in the front lines. All of them showed tremendous enthusiasm to support this effort. Therefore, on the 20 May 2003, I was asked to present this strategy to the CDCP of Guangdong Province with only a single slide (figure 5). However, this might be the most important scientific slide I have ever made in my life. I strongly emphasized that genomic sequencing of approximately 30 representative strains of SARS-CoV isolated from early-phase patients' samples with accurate epidemiological information might eventually not only help the identification of the animal origin of the virus, but also delineate its evolution direction, which, in turn, may support further efforts in controlling the disease. It was a successful effort and the collaboration started right after the meeting. While we were working on this project, scientists of Hong Kong University and the CDCP of Shenzhen, Guangdong Province, China, isolated and characterized a SARS-CoV-like virus with more than 99% nucleotide homology to the human SARS-CoV from specimens collected from animals, particularly Himalayan palm civets (Paguma larvata) and raccoon dogs (Nyctereutes procyonoides) of a live wild-game animal market in Shenzhen . Meanwhile, many workers who handled animals in these wet markets were proved to have antibodies against SARS-CoV, although they had no history of a SARS-like disease Yu et al. 2003) .",

We were able to determine 29 SARS-CoV genomic sequences obtained from 20 patients from Guangdong Province, with disease onset dates in the early and middle phases of the epidemic and from four patients of the late phase, one from Guangdong, one from Inner Mongolia and the other two from Hong Kong. These sequences supplied a bridge not only for the genotype gaps of different isolates, but also for the time gaps of SARS-CoV evolution and the geographical gaps of the SARS epidemiology.",

Isolates from Guangzhou contained a 29-nucleotide (nt) sequence, which is absent in most of the publicly available SARS-CoV sequences, but these were the same as the isolates from the palm civets. Because this type of sequence was the longest among all the SARS-CoV isolated and the closest to the virus isolated from animals, a representative strain of this kind, GZ02 (GenBank accession no.: AY390556) from the first SARS autopsy sample as that of GD01 (originally designated as GZ01, GenBank accession no.: AY278489) and therefore, epidemiologically the earliest isolate, was used as the reference. Another group of isolates was from Zhongshan with a previously unreported 82-nt deletion in the same region of the genome, Orf8. A sequence with an identical 82-nt deletion was also observed in coronaviruses isolated from farmed civets in Hubei Province, China. It was interesting that a lung biopsy of a patient from the middle phase was found to contain two SARS-CoV genotypes, with the 29-nt and the 82-nt deletions, respectively. Because this patient did have contacts with two patients (SQS and ZZF of HZS-2 Hospital, see \u00a72) from different cities at the time between the early and the middle phases, we may never know whether he was infected with two different kinds of viruses or the virus with 29-nt deletion had further deleted 53 nucleotides. It was also remarkable that another genotype with a 415-nt deletion resulting in the loss of the whole Orf8 region was isolated and confirmed in two Hong Kong patients, with the disease onset from mid-May 2003 (Chiu et al. 2005) .",

This genotype was basically representative not only for the SSE of the HZS-2 Hospital, Guangzhou, but also for the isolates from Shanxi (the BJ group) and Shenzhen. It was particularly interesting to observe another distinguished genotype, G : G : C : T : C, in the HZS-2 Hospital represented by only one patient, who was a worker of the hospital and her job was to help the transfer of patients from the outpatient department to the respective wards. Her onset date was 7 February 2003 with flu-like syndromes (chills for 3 days and fever for 1 day), but she was only hospitalized on 9 February 2003. She was considered to be the tertiary infected patient originated from ZZF and she had a chance to contact doctor A (onset date: 21 February 2003) in the outpatient department during her initial flu-like syndrome period of 7-8 February 2003 while she was still working regularly. She had mild disease course and was released from hospital on 24 February 2003. Although this genotype was one step closer to the late-phase genotype, the genotypes connected with the hotel M outbreak, T : G : T : T : T, had three base substitutions representing the extremely stable late-phase viral genome.

However, pairwise analysis of the Ka/Ks for the genotypes in each epidemic group shows that the average Ka/Ks for the early phase was significantly larger than that for the middle phase, which, in turn, was significantly larger than the ratio for the late phase, which, in fact, was significantly less than 1. These data indicate that the S gene showed the strongest positive selection pressures initially, with subsequent purifying selections and eventual stabilization. For Orf1a, we observed a pattern similar to that for the S gene.

Owing to the unsuccessful domestication of 120 individuals of fruit bats, the SARS-CoV infection test on this animal failed to provide a conclusion. Clinical observations of the infected 10 individuals of palm civets indicated that the in vivo viral amplification and secretion of the infected palm civets were significantly more efficient than any other infection experiments conducted on animal models, such as monkey Bukreyev et al. 2004; Rowe et al. 2004) , ferret (Martina et al. 2003) , cat (Martina et al. 2003) , mouse , rabbit, pig and guinea-pig , etc. This research should be an important contribution for SARS-CoV vaccine and drug development if it can be further supported and continued.",

In particular, of the 10 independently occurring index cases of seven to eight cities in the Pearl River Delta region, at least six had direct contact history with animals (particularly wild animals in restaurants), while the possible contact history with animals of the other four could not be excluded.

Meanwhile, the high percentage of positive tests for anti-SARS-CoV antibodies in serological surveys for people specializing in the retail business of palm civet (72.7%) or wild animals (13.02%) also inferred that the exposure to the animal precursor of SARS-CoV seems to have resulted in asymptomatic infection in most cases of contact He et al. 2003b; Yu et al. 2003; Xu et al. 2004a) .",

These included a ban on serving palm civet dishes, cleaning the wild animal market and epidemiologically following the people involved in the wild animal business, such as purchasing and trading. Meanwhile, surveillance control aiming at detecting SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV infection in the palm civets and rats from both local farms and farms of other locations was carried out. A systematic analysis of 103 serum samples from the palm civets was performed by the Animal Hygiene Laboratory of Australia (Tu et al. 2004) . They found no positives for samples from palm civet farms of Jiangxi, Hunan, Hubei, Henan and Hebei Provinces, but 40% positives of the farms in Shanwe, Guangdong Province. Particularly significant was the 78% positive results for samples from Guangzhou wild animal market. The wet markets in Guangdong sell live poultry, fishes, reptiles and other mammals, which are commonplace across southeast Asia and southern China to service the cultural demand for freshly killed meat and fish produce. In some regions (e.g. Guangdong province, China), increasing affluence has led to the proliferation of markets housing a range of live 'wild' animal species, such as civet cats, linked to the restaurant trade, servicing the demand for these exotic foods. Therefore, it was suggested that the special ecological environment may favour the transmission of SARS-CoV and that the wild animal market of Guangzhou is apparently an important mixture incubator of SARS-CoV ( Tu et al. 2004) .",

I clearly proposed that it would not be surprising to have SARS cases during the winter/spring period. However, there were two possible sources of infection. The viruses from the environment, most probably from wild animals, might have mild symptoms and low infectivity, which, in turn, would be easy to control if the patients could be identified and isolated promptly. On the other hand, if the infection was initiated from the laboratory strains, mostly isolated from the late-phase strains well adapted to human hosts and apparently the most pathogenic and contagious, it would be dangerous and likely to cause human-to-human infection and severe symptoms with bad prognostics, including possible death.",

None of these patients had contact with each other nor with other previously documented SARS cases. However, all of them had clear direct or indirect contact history with wild animals; in particular, three of them had independent contact history related to the TDL Restaurant where palm civet dishes were provided.

In addition, the genomes of the SARS-CoV from human patients were almost identical to those of the SARS-CoV-like viruses from the palm civet (0.11% difference). Thus, structurally, there was little difference to distinguish the genomic sequences of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoVlike viruses and, functionally, concerning the animal contact history of the four patients.

This relatively long-term evolutionary analysis once again strongly suggested that SARS-CoV evolves at a relatively constant neutral rate in both human and palm civet. Furthermore, the date estimates of MRCAs for palm civet and human of different transmission lineages were obtained and a rooted phylogenetic tree covering 2 years' epidemic was constructed (figure 7; Song et al. 2005) . It clearly indicates that the viral transmission from animal to human occurred independently in these two instances. Because a higher viral load in the palm civet of Guangzhou wet market was suggested during the 2003/2004 outbreak based on the study illustrated previously, SARS-CoV of 2003 might have evolved to be more virulent in, or better adapted to palm civet. This further demonstrated that SARS is a zoonotic disease from still unknown origin that has been evolving not only in human, but also in palm civet hosts.",

However, only occasionally has it succeeded in adapting to human-to-human transmission, which clearly occurred in late 2002, and once the virus had adapted to human-to-human transmission in the later part of the outbreak, asymptomatic infection seemed to be rare (Leung et al. 2004b) . This time, the findings led to the reintroduction of the ban on wild-game animal markets and there have been no further naturally acquired human cases since. The effectiveness of this public health measure not only changed the food habits of Cantonese, but also clearly reduced the detection rate of anti-SARS-CoV antibody from sera samples of people working in the business of wild animals. It was 25.07% for May 2003, 13.03% for January 2004, but significantly dropped to 5.04% in July of the same year (data from Guangzhou CDCP). Meanwhile, no new cases were detected during the period of winter 2004 to spring 2005. Although this kind of cross-species transition may happen again in the future, given the present understanding and awareness about SARS, we expect that such re-emergence is unlikely to lead to a global outbreak on the scale of 2003.",

After only a couple of days of close working relationship, we became very good friends and he started to share his thoughts with me about the possibilities for a natural reservoir for SARS-CoV. 'Must be warm blood animals, and bats are very likely', he told me repeatedly. His rationale was simple. Bats, the only flying mammals, account for 20% of the 4800 mammalian species recorded in the world. They are an important reservoir of emerging zoonotic viruses, including Hendra and Nipah, which have recently emerged in Australia and east Asia, respectively (Murray et al. 1995; Chua et al. 2000; Wang & Eaton 2001) . Because the fruit-mediated contacts of domestic pigs with fruit bats causing the emerging of Nipah virus infection in human made a vivid similarity with the fruit-eating palm civets as the carrier of SARS-CoV, Shuyi Zhang's interests in bat as the natural reservoir mainly focused on fruit bats (Rousettus, Cynopterus, etc.) for a while. In fact, seropositive fruit bats (Rousettus leschenaulti ) were occasionally identified at fairly low frequencies (approx. 1-2%; Li et al. 2005b) .",

After the so-called SARS-like CoV genomic RNA fragments were identified in these bats, sampling species were extended and further efforts in this Rhinolophus genus belonging to the family Rhinolophidae were very successful. In mainland China, among six genera of bat species surveyed (Rousettus, Cynopterus, Myotis, Rhinolophus, Nyctalus and Miniopterus) , only three communal, cave-dwelling species from the genus Rhinolophus demonstrated a high SARS-CoV antibody prevalence: 13 out of 46 (28%) in R. pearsoni from Guangxi; 2 out of 6 (33%) in R. pussilus from Guangxi; and 5 out of 7 (71%) in R. macrotis from Hubei (Li et al. 2005b) .

Although the computer simulated three-dimensional structure of the S protein (Protein Data Bank code 1T7G) predicted to have these six amino acids exposed at the surface of the S1 domain (Bernini et al. 2004) , combinatorial substitution of two key residues (N479K/T487S) in the S protein RBD of the middle-phase human SARS-CoV strain, BJ01, greatly interferes with the human ACE2mediated pseudotyped virus entry to only 0.1% of the original. On the other hand, any single substitutions or double substitutions with/of the other four residues had no obvious effects. This lossof-function observation was substantiated with a gain-of-function experiment by substituting amino acid residues K479 and S487 in the typical palm civet SARS-CoV S protein RBD to N479 and T487, individually or in combination. The results showed that compared with the wild-type palm civet strain, SZ3, both the two single amino acid substitutions and the double amino acid substitution greatly enhanced the human ACE2-mediated pseudotyped virus entry of the palm civet SARS-CoV infection, although less efficiently than the case mediated by the BJ01 S protein.",

S N479K/T487S showed undetectable binding ability even when the S protein concentration reached 1 mM. 180 160 140 120 100 80 60 40 20 0 mean fluorescence intensity 2 0 2 2 2 4 2 6 2 8 2 10 2 12 S protein (nM) S BJ01 S F360S S N479K S T487S S N479K/T487S Figure 8 . The binding affinity curves of selected mutants of human SARS-CoV S proteins (BJ01) to human ACE2expressed Hela cells (Hela F5). These mutated S fragments (13-510) were constructed based on the S gene of strain BJ01. They were fused with human Fc. Hela cells expressing human ACE2 were incubated with 100 nM S fragments and the binding affinity of S proteins was detected through FACS analysis using FITC-conjugated anti-human IgG-Fc antibody. The mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) in the y-axis was determined by a series of FACS analysis in which Hela F5 cells were incubated with serially diluted S fragments from 1 mM to 2 nM.

The S K(R)497/S487 protein naturally exists in all isolates from the palm civet in 2003 and most isolates of palm civet in 2004. Considering that these double amino acid substituted viruses had extremely low viral entry ability and receptor binding affinity specifically towards human ACE2-expressing cells, it is not surprising that workers who handled or had close contact with palm civet during the 2002-2003 period showed no SARS-like syndrome, although they may have positive antiserum against SARS-CoV. These results strongly suggest that the coexistence of K/R479 and S487 functions as the entry barrier for animalto-human transmission of the SARS-CoV.",

All the viral isolates from human patients of the 2003-2004 period had a genome very close to four isolates from the palm civet of the same time, i.e. they all had the S N479/S487 protein.",

With the high human ACE2 binding affinity of BJ01 as the reference, the S 487T amino acid switch may reflect the virus adaptation to human host and the presence of the S N479/T487 protein might be essential for causing the pandemic, i.e. the successful transition from animal-tohuman transmission to human-to-human transmission.",

The existence of S N479/S487 in the 2003-2004 SARS-CoV isolates both from human patients and some palm civets reveals a dangerous signal. It manifests that some isolates in the palm civet have already evolved to acquire the ability to cross the entry barrier between palm civets and humans. In this direction, it is significant to emphasize that the inhibition of the pseudotyped virus infection caused by the N479K/T487S double substitution of human SARS-CoV S protein was human-specific, as the decrease in infectivity could be observed only in human ACE2-expressing cells but not in cells expressing mouse ACE2. Although one early study has showed that the mouse ACE2 is a relatively poor receptor (Li et al. 2004b) , this study showed that the high level and sustained expression of mouse ACE2 was capable of supporting SARS-CoV pseudotyped virus entry. These results are in accordance with the finding from the animal model study that mice can be efficiently infected by human SARS-CoV Wentworth et al. 2004) . Therefore, the potential intermediate host position of rodents for SARS-CoV should be carefully studied as a reasonable extrapolation of these experimental findings.",

Instead, it is more probably the beginning of the overall molecular mechanistic studies. For instance, the evolutionary relationship between the SARS-like CoV, in the wild-animal reservoir, and the SARS-CoV, causing epidemic in human, is yet to be elucidated and the molecular mechanism of SARS pathogenesis is still largely unclear. However, by reviewing the progress we have made within less than 4 years, we may appreciate the great impact of human genomic research upon today's medical research. Honestly speaking, without the continuous efforts that Chinese scientists have made in human genome research since 1994, it would have been impossible for us to achieve the present success that people have witnessed. The experiences and lessons we may learn from this history are not just experimental design and technology, but also include the wisdom of strategic planning and the capability of team organization. It is my sincere hope that these lessons and experiences will become useful guidance for our future research, particularly in combating the emergence/re-emergence of infectious diseases, which eventually may help our people to construct and develop a safer, healthier and more harmonious society.
