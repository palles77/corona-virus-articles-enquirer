By inspecting the stable monophyletic branchings in CVTrees reconstructed from a total of 861 genomes (56 Archaea plus 797 Bacteria, using 8 Eukarya as outgroups) definite taxonomic assignments were proposed for these not-fully-classified species. Further development of Archaea taxonomy may verify the predicted phylogenetic results of the CVTree approach.",

            "text": "The introduction of 16S rRNA analysis and the recognition of Archaea as one of the three main domains of life by Woese and coworkers [1] was a milestone in prokaryotic phylogeny and taxonomy. Although at present there is no generally accepted prokaryotic taxonomy, many microbiologists consider the new edition of the Bergey's Manual of Systematic Bacteriology [2] and the closely related Taxonomic Outline of Bacteria and Archaea (TOBA) [3] as the best approximation to a standard [4] . As both Bergey's Manual and TOBA are based on 16S rRNA phylogeny, complemented by single gene or few gene analysis and traditional morphological characters, many questions remain unanswered as regards the objectivity and reliability of this approach. In particular, to what extent conclusions drawn from aligning a single or a few RNA or protein-coding *These authors contributed equally to this work \u2020Corresponding author (email: hao@mail.itp.ac.cn) genes may be applied to the relation of species. It is natural that whole-genome based methods may yield more convincing results in this context. However, most whole-genome based phylogenetic methods rely on sequence alignments at certain stage and alignment algorithms often involve various parameters, e.g., scoring matrices and gap penalties. Therefore, their results require alternative and independent verification by parameter-free and alignment-free phylogenetic methods. Our newly proposed Composition Vector (CVTree) approach [5, 6] is such a method and has been successfully applied to viruses [7, 8] , chloroplasts [9] , prokaryotes [5, 10] and fungi [11] . Nonetheless, the intention of this study is not merely to add a few more leaves to a tree, but to keep some records for the future test of the predictive capability of the CVTree approach. The 7 species from the 56 available Archaea genomes without a definite or complete taxonomic characterization provides an appropriate opportunity.",

An organism is represented by a Composition Vector (CV) derived from all protein products in its genome. For a fixed integer K one collects all overlapping K-peptides, starting from the beginning of a protein. Putting all 20 K possible K-peptide counts in lexicographic order of the amino acid characters as components, a raw CV of 20 K dimensions is obtained. Then each component is \"renormalized\" by subtracting a \"predicted\" count by using a Markovian assumption from the counts of (K\u22121) and (K\u22122) peptides. The subtraction procedure suppresses random background caused by neutral mutations and highlights the taxon-specificity of the CV [6] . Then correlations between CV pairs are calculated to generate a distance/dissimilarity matrix from which trees are constructed by using the neighbor-joining [14] program from the Philip package [15] . In order to enable experimental biologists to enjoy the CVTree method a Web Server [16, 17] has been made public.

For greater K this number is limited by a linearly decreasing function L-M(K+1). There is a prominent maximum in the distribution of significant K-peptide number. For prokaryotes both overall structure and fine branchings of CVTrees are \"best\" (in the sense of agreement with taxonomy) at K=5 or 6. In particular, the resolution of the three main domains of life, Archaea, Bacteria and Eukarya, appears from K=4. ",

Whenever leaves in a monophyletic branch come under a taxonomic unit we call the branch by that taxonomic name. We perform a reduction of CVTrees from bottom up in order to carry out a thorough comparison with taxonomy. First of all, there are 6 extremely halophilous archaeons that form a monophyletic branch in all CVTrees from K=3 to 7, as shown in Figure 1 . Among this group five species belong to different genera of one and the same class Halobacteria which contains only one order that in turn contains only one family, i.e., they share a common TOBA code A2.4=1=1. Independent of the internal placement, the genus Haloquadratum, not listed in TOBA but present in the all-living species tree [13] , was safely assigned to the same lineage.
