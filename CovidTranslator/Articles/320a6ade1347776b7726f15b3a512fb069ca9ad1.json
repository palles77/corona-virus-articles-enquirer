Studies have consistently shown inadequate health care worker (HCW) compliance with isolation precautions. Evaluating adherence through direct observation of HCW behavior is considered the ''gold standard'' but is labor-intensive, requiring the collection and analysis of a large volume of observations. Methods: Two methods of data collection to assess HCW compliance were evaluated: a manual method using a paper form (PF), with subsequent data entry into a database, and an electronic method using a Web-based form (WBF) with real-time data recording. Observations were conducted at 4 hospitals (a total of 2,065 beds) to assess the availability of gloves, gowns, and masks; isolation sign postings; and HCW isolation practices. Results: A total of 13,878 isolation rooms were observed in 2009. The median number of rooms observed per day was 61 for PF and 60 for WBF, and the respective mean observation times per room were 149 seconds and 60 seconds. Thus, use of the WBF provided a time savings of 89 seconds per room. Conclusion: Simple electronic forms can significantly decrease the required resources for monitoring HCW adherence to hospital policies. Use of the WBF decreased the observation time by 60%, allowing for increases in the frequency and intensity of surveillance activities.",

Up to 16% of all HAIs reported through the US National Health Care Safety Network in 2006-2007 were associated with 9 multidrug-resistant organisms (MDROs), and these continue to pose serious therapeutic challenges. 1 Other studies have reported increases in antimicrobial resistance in some organisms by as much as 47% since the 1990s. [1] [2] [3] Recently, novel pathogens, such as the H1N1 influenza virus and coronavirus (severe acute respiratory syndrome), as well as an increased virulence of known pathogens, such as Clostridium difficile, have become a concern in hospitalized patients. The Healthcare Infection Control Advisory Committee of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends isolation precautions for patients with MDROs and C difficile infection (contact isolation), influenza and meningococcal meningitis (droplet isolation), and tuberculosis and measles (airborne isolation). The CDC also recommends that health care workers (HCWs) and visitors perform hand hygiene before and after contact with all patients or patient equipment/environment. 4 Breaches in technique may lead to the spread of organisms directly to patients via HCWs' hands or by contact with the contaminated environment or equipment.",

The IPS electronically identifies patients who require isolation by capturing demographic information from the admission/ discharge/transfer system and merging it with microbiology data, physicians' isolation orders from the hospital's electronic medical record, and isolation information from previous admissions. Rules and logic are applied to monitor the need for isolation precautions; for example, organisms of interest are automatically linked to the correct category of isolation based on Centers for Disease Control and Prevention criteria and institutional policy. In addition, patients with a previous history of an infection requiring isolation are automatically placed back on the isolation patient list on readmission to the respective institution. Patient-specific clinical information also can be gathered from the system and displayed in a summary format on a single screen. 14 The hospital's infection preventionists confirm the isolation information for patients on the IPS list at least twice daily. When a patient did not have positive microbiologic results suggestive of an infectious process but clinicians nevertheless suspected that the patient had a communicable illness (eg, signs and symptoms of tuberculosis or diarrhea), clinical indications were entered by the infection preventionists into the IPS for monitoring.",

Each room was evaluated for the presence of an isolation supply cart or anteroom and for the existence of PPE, including gloves (small, medium, and large sizes), isolation gowns, and, if appropriate, masks and protective eyewear. If HCWs were seen entering or exiting a patient's room, the observer documented whether they performed hand hygiene and wore PPE on entering the room, removed the PPE on exiting the room, and performed hand hygiene after removing gloves. If the HCW did not remove his or her PPE before leaving the room, the observer noted whether he or she touched the inanimate environment or patient care equipment outside the room. If a group of staff or visitors entered or exited an isolation room, a maximum of 3 people were observed for a total of 6 observations per room.

The observer visited each patient's room listed on the isolation census. These visits were generally made on weekdays during the day or evening shift, although they were occasionally made on weekends. A schedule was developed on a monthly basis by the observer. If the observer found additional patients who had been placed on isolation by the medical team but were not listed on the IPS, then the observer added the room and bed information to the PF and observed those patients as well. If the observer identified inconsistencies between the expected isolation status for a room/bed on the IPS list (eg, an unoccupied room, a missing sign), then a staff member was consulted to confirm the patient's information. The PF was modified based on changes in patient location, isolation status, or discharge. The observer recorded HCW and visitor compliance with hand hygiene and transmission-based precautions, and noted whether the appropriate PPE was available for each patient. Periodically, the observer transcribed the observations into an Excel (Microsoft, Redmond, WA) database, and these data were rematched to the IPS to merge additional information on visit admission and discharge dates and isolation start and end dates. Mismatches and data entry errors (eg, incorrect medical record number or isolation category) were retrospectively adjusted to ensure that observations were being made on the correct patient.",

            "text": "Surveillance of HAIs and MDROs is time-consuming and limits the ability of infection preventionists to focus on prevention activities such as education, current practice assessment, and performance improvement initiatives. 15 In fact, a recent survey concluded that most health care epidemiology and infection prevention and control programs are understaffed and lack adequate resources to address the mandate for more thorough reporting of HAIs and prevention efforts. 16 Several external factors have put increasing pressure on hospital leadership to reduce HAIs without increasing infection prevention and control staff levels. These factors include mandatory public reporting of HAIs to federal and state agencies, adherence to performance standards associated with Joint Commission patient safety goals, decreases in Medicare reimbursement, and increased public accountability. 17 These increased demands are forcing each institution to evaluate current workflow and process patterns and identify new ways to streamline their activities. This involves carefully evaluating the advantages and disadvantages of performing surveillance using a PF versus a WBF (Table 1) . Each method has its advantages and disadvantages. For example, a PF requires extra transcription time and data entry time and has the potential for data loss from misplaced data collection forms or transcription errors from the PF to an electronic database or software package. Moreover, the PF cannot control for user variability in documenting observations, because only free text is allowed. On the other hand, the PF does not require technical expertise, a portable tablet computer, or special software, and it can be easily created and adjusted as needed. Thus, the initial development time is minimal.

The tablet may be costly, heavy, and have a short battery life. The design of the WBF requires forethought to ensure adequate and appropriate output. The WBF has some significant advantages, however, in that it does not require either transcription or additional data entry time and minimizes incorrect or incomplete entries by providing structured choices. The WBF avoids data loss and increased security, because the records can be saved on a hospital server. Initial startup costs for the WBF, including the cost of the tablet, an extra battery, replacement batteries, and per month charge for a wireless card, is approximately $3,200. Other incidental costs associated with the WBF were consistent with those associated with any computer.",

Also, although the total observation times per day and per data entry session were documented for the PF, observation times for individual patients were not documented. For the WBF, time stamps of all activities can be reviewed. It also is important to note that the surveillance activities described in this article were conducted for research purposes. For clinical purposes, surveillance must be accompanied by feedback to allow behavior change. The time saved in surveillance activities using automated methods could be used for such feedback and other educational activities.",

The methods described here can be replicated by other institutions using an electronic spreadsheet or IPS. Additional systematic and objective comparative studies of the costs and data accuracy of these methods are needed to help guide infection preventionists in choosing the optimal data collection tool and method for their institution. Standard forms could be developed to facilitate uniform data collection practices and allow comparisons across settings. The cost-effectiveness and clinical outcomes of such data collection systems merit further study.",
