            "text": "Background: Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is one of the most prevalent long-term psychiatric diagnoses among survivors of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). Objectives: The objective of this study was to identify the predictors of chronic PTSD in SARS survivors. Design: PTSD at 30 months after the SARS outbreak was assessed by the Structured Clinical Interview for the DSM-IV. Survivors' demographic data, medical information and psychosocial variables were collected for risk factor analysis. Results: Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that female gender as well as the presence of chronic medical illnesses diagnosed before the onset of SARS and avascular necrosis were independent predictors of PTSD at 30 months post-SARS. Associated factors included higher-chance external locus of control, higher functional disability and higher average pain intensity. Conclusion: The study of PTSD at 30 months post-SARS showed that the predictive value of acute medical variables may fade out. Our findings do not support some prior hypotheses that the use of high dose corticosteroids is protective against the development of PTSD. On the contrary, the adversity both before and after the SARS outbreak may be more important in hindering recovery from PTSD. The risk factor analysis can not only improve the detection of hidden psychiatric complications but also provide insight for the possible model of care delivery for the SARS survivors. With the complex interaction of the biopsychosocial challenges of SARS, an integrated multidisciplinary clinic setting may be a superior approach in the long-term management of complicated PTSD cases.",

Patients with severe communication problems (e.g., deafness, dementia, mental retardation) were excluded from the study. Patients who also received treatment for SARS infection in other hospitals and were transferred back to UCH for follow-up were also excluded due to possible differences in hospital management and the likelihood that these patients represented a biased group with fewer complications. A total of 119 adult patients were admitted to UCH for treatment of suspected or confirmed SARS infection. All of them were offered subsequent follow-ups at UCH according to the government policy. Of these patients, 17 failed to fulfill WHO criteria for SARS infection, 4 had also received SARS infection treatment in other hospitals, 4 were of Filipino ethnicity, and 1 had a history of a cerebrovascular accident with severe dysphasia and communication problems. Of the remaining 93 eligible subjects, 2 refused to participate and 1 returned to his home country. The cohort consisted of 90 subjects, representing a response rate of 96.8%. The subjects were relatively young (mean age=41.1 years, S.D.=12.1), predominantly female (62.2%) and relatively well educated (80% had received education to the level of secondary school or above). More than two thirds (68.9%) were either cohabiting or married at the time of the SARS outbreak. However, five subjects' spouses died of SARS, and one subject divorced after the SARS outbreak. Twenty-seven (30%) subjects were HCW. Among them, nursing staff constituted 55.6% (n=15), followed by health care assistants (22.2%, n=6) and doctors (14.8%, n=4).",

The experience of SARS infection may have threatened the subject's view of the self, the world and the future. There is evidence that diminished perceived control is associated with more severe pain and functional disability [31] . However, appraisal is a dynamic process, and it may change when new dramatic health or illness-related experiences like SARS occur. Whether certain appraisal styles exacerbate the effects of stressor and whether the predominant use of each style is related to the stress process are complex issues [23] . A prospective study may help to explain the relationship between the appraisal style and the subsequent psychological response. Early intervention to enhance self efficacy in coping with these stressful events may be a potential secondary prevention strategy, a hypothesis that requires further exploration.",

The femoral head is the most commonly affected area, but other bone areas may be involved as well. AVN might affect recovery from PTSD through the following mechanisms. First, AVN has the potential to cause pain and functional impairment, which are associated with chronic PTSD as previously discussed. Second, the discovery of AVN occurred between six and nine months post-SARS, when patients started to expect improvement of physical function. The delayed and unexpected onset causes a heavy blow to the subject's locus of control system. The unclear likelihood of AVN later progressing to bone collapse may further defeat the subject's belief system of self-efficacy. Thus, AVN demonstrates that the interaction of biopsychosocial consequences might hinder recovery from PTSD. This study also illustrates that unexpected, long-lasting physical complications of SARS might affect recovery from PTSD. The careful detection of psychiatric symptoms is needed when any further physical complication is newly identified.",

Adversity, both before and after the disaster, combined with particular interactions between biopsychosocial factors, can markedly hinder recovery from psychiatric consequences. We have shown that AVN, an unexpected and delayed treatment complication, was associated with persistent psychiatric morbidity. Clinicians should thus be alert to the psychological impact of any other unexpected physical complications, especially if they have a strong biological and psychological impact. The association factors for PTSD included subjective pain perception, functional impairment and the locus of control appraisal. These findings highlight the potential treatment direction for optimization of pain management, physical rehabilitation and cognitive work in promoting self-efficacy.",

The important roles of pain, appraisal and the locus of control may be the future focus for understanding the risk mechanisms and potential treatments of PTSD. Although our findings were based on a cohort of SARS survivors in a general hospital in HK, we hope that the findings can help in exploring the management of comparable infectious disease outbreaks. In case of an unfortunate future massive outbreak, a prospective study with an early baseline and longitudinal assessment should be adopted to study the effects of psychosocial correlates with PTSD.",
