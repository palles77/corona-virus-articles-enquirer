Dictyocaulus infections are known to occur sporadically in the Midwest, including Iowa (Al-Qudah et al., 1995) . Dictyocaulosis can be diagnosed by (a) demonstrating the slender, white adult worms in the bronchi of the caudal lobes in gross specimens at necropsy, (b) visualizing prominently alate adult worms with coelomyarian musculature and embryonated egg in the uterus in bronchi by histopathological techniques, or (c) through the recovery of larva using the Baermann technique (Al-Qudah et al., 1995) . However, confirmatory diagnosis of ascarid larval infections by classical pathological and parasitological techniques is difficult, without additional molecular techniques because (a) complete sets of microanatomical measurements and descriptions of only a few ascarid larvae in mice tissue are available (Bowman, 1987) , and it is unknown if the larvae measure the same in cattle lungs (b) ascarid larvae undergo changes in length and width to different extents during the migratory phase (Nichols, 1956a) .",

            "text": "Compared with mild gross lesions, histopathology revealed more serious inflammation associated with larvae migrating in the lung. Characteristics of the larvae included alae, coelomyarin musculature, prominent lateral chords, and an intestine lined by uninucleate cells. Morphological features allowed for preliminary identification of the larvae as an ascarid larvae (Nichols, 1956b ). An acute to subacute bronchiolitis and interstitial pattern was observed similar to the lesions observed by McCraw (McCraw and Lautenslager, 1971 ). Contrary to the findings described by McCraw and Leuternslager, gross lesions were fairly subtle in this case. Follow-up on the outcome of the disease in the remaining cohort of calves was unavailable. Larval migratory patterns following the ingestion of infective egg and hatching in the alimentary tract are similar among members of the ascarids. A hepatic-pulmonary-tracheal route is followed by Ascaris in its definitive (Douvres et al., 1969) and accidental hosts including humans and cattle (Kennedy, 1954; Nichols, 1956b) . Toxocara vitulorum, the cattle ascarid, must be considered in the differential diagnosis, because it follows a similar hepatic-pulmonary-tracheal route (Warren, 1971) , infects calves, and has been recently reported in North America (Chelladurai et al., 2015; Davila et al., 2010; Woodbury et al., 2012) . Therefore, molecular techniques are essential for obtaining a definitive diagnosis. Adults of the Dictylocaulus viviparus which reside in the bronchi are also capable of causing parasitic bronchitis (Panuska, 2006) .",

Although this approach is specific and sensitive enough to differentiate between Dictyocaulus viviparus, Toxocara vitulorum and Ascaris spp., neither this method nor PCR-RFLP of the ITS gene can be used to differentiate between pig and human isolates of Ascaris (Nejsum et al., 2017) . But, this approach is still useful to draw comparisons and establish a preliminary population epidemiology between isolates from a given area and from across the world . Given the propensity of Ascaris for cross transmission between animals and humans (Anderson, 1995) , and the very high identity of amino acid sequences encoded by the mitochondrial genome in human and pig isolates (Liu et al., 2012) , the debate on the existence of one or two species continues. The limitations of the use of the ITS gene and difficulty in amplifying other genes from FFPE tissue precludes identification of the Ascaris larvae in this study as being from a pig or human source.",
