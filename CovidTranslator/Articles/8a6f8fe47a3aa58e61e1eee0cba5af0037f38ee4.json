            "text": "The SARS-coronavirus (SARS-CoV) is a newly emerged, highly pathogenic agent that caused over 8,000 human infections with nearly 800 deaths between November 2002 and September 2003. While direct person-to-person transmission via respiratory droplets accounted for most cases, other modes have not been ruled out. Faecal shedding is common and prolonged and has caused an outbreak in Hong Kong. We studied the stability of SARS-CoV under different conditions, both in suspension and dried on surfaces, in comparison with other human-pathogenic viruses, including human coronavirus HCoV-229E. In suspension, HCoV-229E gradually lost its infectivity completely while SARS-CoV retained its infectivity for up to 9 days; in the dried state, survival times were 24 h versus 6 days. Thermal inactivation at 56\u00b0C was highly effective in the absence of protein, reducing the virus titre to below detectability; however, the addition of 20% protein exerted a protective effect resulting in residual infectivity. If protein-containing solutions are to be inactivated, heat treatment at 60\u00b0C for at least 30 min must be used. Different fixation procedures, e.g. for the preparation of immunofluorescence slides, as well as chemical means of virus inactivation commonly used in hospital and laboratory settings were generally found to be effective. Our investigations confirm that it is possible to care for SARS patients and to conduct laboratory scientific studies on SARS-CoV safely. Nevertheless, the agent's tenacity is considerably higher than that of HCoV-229E, and should SARS re-emerge, increased efforts need to be devoted to questions of environmental hygiene.",

Most cases were the result of direct transmission via respiratory droplets during close personal contact, and adequate respiratory protective measures were shown to be effective [14] . However, there are a number of instances when transmission occurred through other means that are often still not well defined. In the ''Hotel M'' episode, cases occurred in individuals that had never met a SARS-infected individual face-to-face [11] . At the Amoy Gardens high-rise housing estate, transmission probably occurred through SARS-CoV shed in the faeces of a patient [7] . In mainland China, around 50% of probable SARS patients did not have an apparent history of close personal contact with another case [8] . At least a proportion of these cases might have arisen from modes of transmission other than droplets.",

HCoV-229E and HSV-1 were most sensitive and completely lost their infectivity within 72 h, with or without added FCS. This is in agreement with previous studies [15] . In contrast, dried SARS-CoV retained its infectivity for as long as 6 days, with 10% FCS exerting a protective influence throughout. Only after 9 days in a dried state had SARS-CoV completely lost its infectivity. Adenovirus type 3 was the most stable amongst the viruses tested, retaining infectivity as late as day 9, when the experiment was terminated.",
