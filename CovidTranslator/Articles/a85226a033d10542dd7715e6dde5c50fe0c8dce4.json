Both assays were provided in the kit by Molbiol (ModularDx Kit Coronavirus SA1 (EMC) upstream E-gene and Light Mix Modular MERS-CoV Orf1a). The open reading frame 1b (ORF1b) gene region was also tested before being replaced by Orf1a. All assays were optimized for Roche LightCycler 1.5 and 2.0 real-time PCR system. 20 lL of total reaction was prepared from 5 lL extracted RNA, 0.5 lL reaction mix of UpE or Orf1a from the kit, 4.0 lL Roche Real-time ready RNA Virus Master, 0.1 lL RT enzyme, and 10.4 lL PCR-grade water. The thermal cycling condition and detection procedure of Light Cycler were set according to the manufacturer (MolBiol Roche Diagnostics). Positive samples were further confirmed by sequencing the RNAdependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), nucleocapsid (N) gene regions, and five different partial fragments comprising ORF1a, ORF1ab, Spike1, Spike2, and NSP4 genes from selected sequences as previously described [9] .",

The 1.6 % molecular prevalence observed here is lower when compared with the previously reported (97 %) MERS-CoV seroprevalence in UAE [6] . The high prevalence of antibodies against MERS-CoV resulted from previous infection might protect dromedary camels against infection. In contrast, it has also been reported that prior infection or passively acquired maternal antibody might not provide a complete protection from infection [11] . Whether one of the two hypotheses is correct will necessitate further investigation. It should be noted that the absence of clear clinical signs or observed mortalities in MERS-CoV-infected camels may represent potential danger of camels serving as reservoir for human infections.",

Specifically, higher infection rate was observed in camels at slaughter houses when compared to borders, whereas no virus was detected in public escorts and zoos. This indicates that the former two locations could represent higher hot spots for potential human and animal infections. It should be noted that even though no clinical signs of a disease were observed in all personnel who were in direct contact with the infected camels in all locations, some personnel was seropositive to MERS-CoV (data not shown). Whether such antibodies against MERS-CoV are protective needs further investigation. Moreover, the detection of MERS-CoV in camel shipments crossing borders with Saudi Arabia and Oman reflects that animal movement between countries is participating in the spread of the virus in the Arabian Peninsula among either animals or humans. Thus, it is necessary to investigate such locations when conducting systematic surveillances or prior to establishing disease control programs.",

In addition, it provides further evidence of zoonosis and cross-species transmission of MERS-CoV between humans and dromedary camels. However, the direction of transmission between humans and camels remains unclear, which could be elucidated by further amplifying and comparing complete genome sequences obtained from humans and camels in UAE.",

The virus was shown to circulate in camels crossing borders with Saudi Arabia and Oman and in camels at slaughter houses within Abu Dhabi Emirate. The molecular prevalence of the virus was found to be lower than the previously reported serological one. MERS-CoV sequences obtained from camels in UAE were clustering with human-and camel-derived MERS-CoV sequences in the same geographic area. The study can provide a basis for future epidemiological research and control.",

On the other hand, none of the samples collected from public escort and zoos were positive by real-time PCR. For confirmation of real-time PCR results, partial regions of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp)and nucleocapsid (N) genes of two different samples were sequenced and submitted to the GenBank with accession numbers KM609328 and KM609329, respectively. Seven camel sequences characterized this study (Camel-4, Camel-6, Camel-8, Camel-12, Camel-14-Camel-17, and Camel-18) were submitted to GenBank with accession numbers: ORF1a (KP202191, KP202192, KP202194, KP20 2198, KP202199, KP202200, KP202201), ORF1ab (KP202 203, KP202204, KP202206, KP202208, KP202210, KP202 212, KP202213), Spike 1 (KP202215, KP202216, KP2022 18, KP202222, KP202223, KP202224, KP202225), Spike 2 (KP202227, KP202228, KP202230, KP202234, KP202235, KP202236, KP202237), and NSP4 (KP202239, KP202240, KP202242, KP202246, KP202247, KP202248, KP202249).",
