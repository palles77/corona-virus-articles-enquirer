In a questionnaire study of dog owners in the UK, 14.9% (266/1784) of dogs had had diarrhoea within the previous two week period (Hubbard et al., 2007) . Similarly, in a cross-sectional study of vet-visiting dogs, 28.6% (68/249) of dogs either had a presenting complaint of diarrhoea, or had had diarrhoea within the previous month . However, risk factors and aetiological agents remain poorly understood, partly because many cases resolve with no, or only symptomatic treatment. Whilst many dogs do recover, their wellbeing must be considered impaired by this syndrome, and additionally, outbreaks of even self-limiting diarrhoea can have extensive implications both in terms of welfare and economics, especially when large numbers of dogs are involved. These negative consequences of diarrhoea become magnified in outbreaks of severe disease, when affected dogs suffer systemic illness, and the cost of their care is increased. Consequently, an improved understanding of potential causes of this condition is desirable.",

A small number of studies have been performed to clarify the role of infectious agents in canine diarrhoea in veterinary practice. In faecal samples from 71 vet-visiting dogs and 59 age-matched non-diarrhoeic controls, 30% of cases and 22% of controls were found to contain potential pathogens, including canine enteric coronavirus (CECoV), canine parvovirus 2 (CPV-2), Campylobacter spp., Salmonella spp, Giardia spp, cryptosporidium and helminths (Hackett and Lappin, 2003) . These prevalence figures may have been an underestimate, as some of the methods used in the study, for example electron microscopy for viruses, are relatively insensitive. Another study compared the prevalence of pathogens, again using electron microscopy, in the faeces of 936 dogs presenting at a veterinary hospital with haemorrhagic diarrhoea with samples from 200 healthy controls (Schulz et al., 2008) . Potential pathogens were detected in 44% of cases and 18% of controls, and included CECoV, CPV-2 and a non-speciated paramyxovirus.",

This agrees with a previous study in which male dogs were found to be at increased risk of diarrhoea (Hubbard et al., 2007) . Although the reason for such a finding is unclear, it may be that males are more likely to encounter pathogens whilst engaged in investigatory and roaming behaviour. No statistical association was observed between gender and scavenging behaviour; however this was not a primary objective of the study. Others have suggested a relationship between male hormones and roaming behaviour (Maarschalkerweerd et al., 1997) and sniffing contacts with other dogs (Westgarth et al., 2008) , all of which may give increased opportunity for the acquisition of gastrointestinal (and other) pathogens.",

Routine vaccination in the UK, when administered, typically includes vaccines protective against diseases caused by CDV, CPV-2, CPIV and canine adenovirus, and Leptospira serovars canicola and icterohaemorrhagiae (Gaskell et al., 2002) . Of these, CPV-2 and CDV are the most likely to be associated with diarrhoea, although CDV infection is typically also accompanied by respiratory and other signs. Despite using sensitive molecular techniques, no CDV was detected, and only four case dogs were found to be shedding CPV-2. None of these four positive dogs was known to have a complete vaccination history; two dogs had not yet been vaccinated, and for the other two dogs the vaccine history was unknown.",

            "text": "The reason why there was a relatively low prevalence of the recognised enteric viral pathogens such as CPV-2 and CECoV in this study is not clear. One possible expla- nation is that the cases were obtained from first opinion practice and the case definition was relatively broad, thus potentially leading to the inclusion of a variety of other aetiologies, including lifestyle factors, as well as other potential pathogens for which we did not screen. Another possibility is that the sensitivity and specificity of our tests was too low. In general, sensitivity and specificity of individual tests have not been reported for the majority of canine pathogens, partly because of insufficient data, and partly because of a lack of agreement for what constitutes a 'gold standard'. However in a recent study where we focused on more severe, haemorrhagic cases of diarrhoea, we detected CPV-2 in 58% of 355 diarrhoeic dogs attending a charitable hospital practice, using an identical laboratory protocol (Godsall et al., 2010) . Similarly in previous work we have been able to detect a prevalence of CECoV of up to 20% using the same real-time RT-PCR assay in kennelled dogs . Overall, it is perhaps more likely that the apparent association between up to date vaccinations and a reduced risk of diarrhoea may be a proxy for better owner care including vaccination, or due to sampling bias within the study. For example control dogs visiting the practice may be more likely to be up to date with vaccinations, or veterinarians may have preferentially recruited dogs presented for booster vaccination rather than more complex consultations. This may have resulted in dogs visiting for boosters being over-represented in the control population.",

An un-anticipated reason given was 'social', and this encompassed both dogs visiting for habituation to the practice, and dogs accompanying another dog. This reason was unexpected, and may suggest either that a relatively large number of dogs visit the vet for social reasons, or that a small number of control participants were recruited on a convenience basis, rather than strictly according to the study protocol. It is difficult to predict what effect, if any, this may have had on the composition of the control group of dogs; it is how-ever possible that some bias may have been introduced in this way.",

In addition, it has been suggested that the consumption of cellulose may reduce the water content of faeces (Wichert et al., 2002) . The question asked was limited to whether the dog had had contact with the faeces, rather than whether it had consumed them; therefore whilst it is possible that there is some genuine protective effect evoked by the contact with or consumption of some herbivore faeces in the dog, this would require further study.",
