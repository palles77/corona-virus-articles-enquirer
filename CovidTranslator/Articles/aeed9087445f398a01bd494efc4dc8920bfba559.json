Pope and Dockery [11] conducted an extensive review on the research about health effects of particulate matter (PM)the most harmful component in smog. They focused on the shortterm and long-term PM exposure and its effects on mortality and some diseases. Recently, Hughes et al. [2] compared annual case numbers of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with smog trends in some cities to investigate the health effects of smog in past years. Meanwhile, current studies investigating smog-related public health often adopt small data sets with limited population and time coverage. Motley et al. [12] measured only 66 volunteers' health status to acquire public health information during a smog disaster in Los Angeles. Chen et al. [13] used hospital visits to analyze health hazard trends under smog disasters, but the records only covered one hospital in Beijing during one high-smog period. Schwartz [14] investigated mortality caused by smog disasters, but the research was based on data records from some typical big smog disasters in some big cities.",

Our previous work [24] utilized Chinese tweets on Weibo to analyze the correlation between smog disasters and public health statuses, but did not study smog-related health hazard forecasting. Its prediction model simply approximated the health hazard with physical observations, which aimed at quantitatively analyzing the relationship and generating a standard for rating smog disasters' health hazard. The work presented in this paper actually extends our previous work [24] from historical relationship analysis to real-time forecasting. Our another work [25] in progress aims at forecasting smog disaster directly with different kinds of data including social media data. It will reinforce our study for decision making under smog disasters, but is quite different from the health hazard forecasting topic presented in this paper.",

In recent years, ANNs are further extended with deep architectures.

The first kind of features (F a ) is extracted from air quality observations, including both air pollution concentrations (CO, NO 2 , SO 2 , O 3 , PM 2:5 and PM 10 ) and air quality index (AQI) which comprehensively evaluates the air quality. The second kind of features (F m ) is extracted from records of various meteorological elements, including humidity, cloud value, pressure, temperature and wind speed, all of which have been proven to affect smog disasters greatly. For example, high wind speed and low cloud value usually make smog pollution to decrease in the next day. The third kind of features (F s ) comes from records of smog severity index (SSI) and social network diffusion incorporated smog severity index (D-SSI), both of them represent people's opinions and observations on the current and future smog disasters. The fourth kind of features (F h ) uses the current and recent PHI and D-PHI records, which enables the model to take the autocorrelation factor of the time-series data into consideration.",

On one hand, we should filter out some unimportant kinds of observations such as some specific air pollutants and meteorology elements, as they may be not very predictive for the next day PHI or may be quite correlated with some other inputs. For example, we find that O 3 does not improve the prediction much when it is inputted with the other air pollutions. On the other hand, we should find out important records in time line for each observation. For example, we find that only the current records instead of all the recent records are important for wind speed and wind direction. In contrary, for D-PHI and PHI, both the current records and the records in the past 6 h are useful. In selecting features, a view independent subset searching method is adopted. It does not search all the subsets of the whole feature set \u00f0F a \u00fe F m \u00fe F s \u00fe F h \u00de, but finds out proper features from each kind of features individually, which reduce the complexity from 2 jFaj \u00fe jFmj \u00fe jFsj \u00fe jF h j to 2 jFaj \u00fe 2 jFmj \u00fe 2 jFsj \u00fe 2 jF h j . It is reasonable because in our application one kind of features represents one independent view to observe the forecasting target, which means two features from different views will not be highly correlated. Meanwhile, we further decrease the search spacing through testing records of each observation in time line from the current to the past. If we find the record at time t \u00c0 i is not important, the records before that time point will also be regarded as unimportant.",

In this framework, we first propose a new method for smog-related health hazard measurement based on individuals' smog and health related comments, as well as their diffusions on social media. Next, we develop a prediction model that utilizes ANNs to learn the non-linear relationships between the current physical and social smog observations and the next day smog-related health hazard.

The percentage of correct tweets after filtering by a keyword mostly ranges from 85% to 95% [24] . We can find some other public health information such as hospital visit records as supplements.",
