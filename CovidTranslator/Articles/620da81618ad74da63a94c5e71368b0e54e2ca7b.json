            "text": "Five cDNA probes prepared from molecular clones representing genomic RNA sequences of the virulent Miller strain of transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) were used in a dot blot hybridization assay to detect TGEV in cell culture and fecal specimens. Two clones (pA2 and pB4) represent nucleotide base pairs at the 3' terminus of the Miller TGEV genome. The other three clones represent various portions of the 5' end of the E 2 gene, which codes for the major surface glycoprotein of TGEV. Each of the 32P-labeled cDNA probes hybridized to the virulent Miller, attenuated Purdue and four field strains of TGEV. The probes detected 200 to 2000 pg of TGEV RNA extracted from density gradient purified virions and did not hybridize RNA from mock-infected cell cultures, porcine rotavirus or antigenically unrelated coronaviruses. The pB4 and Hpa-1600 probes detected TGEV RNA sequences in 79 and 88%, respectively of 34 field samples identified as TGEV positive by the immunofluorescence assay and electron microscopy (EM). The pD24 clone, which is able to differentiate TGEV from the antigenically related coronaviruses, also compared favorably with conventional methods of EM and immunofluorescence for the detection of TGEV in fecal specimens.",

            "text": "Transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), family Coronaviridae, genus Coronavirus, causes an acute and mostly fatal disease in newborn pigs [23] . The TGEV genome is a single-stranded, polyadenylated infectious RNA approximately 20 kb in length, which codes for at least 5 [12, 15] to 9 [4] subgenomic mRNAs and three major structural proteins: a nucleocapsid protein (N), a transmembrane matrix protein (El) and a surface glycoprotein (E2) [8, 12] . Nucleotide sequence data indicate that the 3' terminus of the TGEV genome codes for mRNAs in the N, El, and E2 regions [14] . Sequencing and hybridization data [13, 25] indicate that the 3' end of the TGEV genome is highly conserved between TGEV strains, feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV), and canine coronavirus (CCV), which are members of the same antigenic subgroup of coronaviruses [ 18] . The E2 gene is also conserved between strains of TGEV, but sequences in the 5' end of this gene are apparently divergent between TGEV and FIPV [13] . Recently, a cDNA probe representing the first 2.1 kb of the attenuated Purdue strain of TGEV was reported to be sensitive and specific for detection of TGEV nucleic acid sequences in cell culture lysates and fecal samples [-25] .",

DNA polymerase I (25 U) and 0.85 U of RNase H were used and incubation was at 16 \u00b0C for 2 h. Double-stranded cDNA was tailed using dCTP and terminal transferase and then annealed into the PstI cut oligo (dG) tailed pUC 9 vector.

This method also eliminated filtration problems with most field samples and concentration of the nucleic acid from the feces by ethanol precipitation increased the sensitivity of the assay. Because the quantity of the clinical material was limited, only three (pB4, Hpa-1600, and pD24) of the cDNA probes were used in this portion of the study. We observed positive hybridization of native plasmid sequences to some fecal samples, thus, only the cloned cDNA inserts rather than the recombinant ptasmids were used as probes to detect TGEV RNA in fecal samples. The results obtained with these three probes and the dot blot hybridization assay are shown in Figs. 4 and 5 and Tables 2 and 3 . Not all 40 field samples (34 positive for TGEV and 6 negative) are illustrated in the figures. An accurate estimate of the amount of RNA could not be determined probably due to contaminating RNA from other sources in the feces. In general, the hybridization signals were more intense with probes prepared to the Hpa-1600 cDNA, which is 5 times larger than the pB4 or the pD24 cDNA (Table2). The Hpa-1600 probe detected 88% of the samples identified as TGEV positive by conventional methods of EM and immunofluorescence compared to 79% for the pB4 probe (Table3). Only 18 of the 34 fecal samples positive for TGEV were available for hybridization using the pD24 probe. This E2 probe detected TGEV RNA in 89% of the TGEV positive samples. It also hybridized weakly with one field sample from a conventional pig identified as being infected with rotavirus, but not TGEV (Fig. 5, C4) . TGEV in four positive fecal samples was not detected by either the pB4 or the Hpa-1600 probe and one of these four samples also failed to hybridize with the pD24 probe. Three positive samples (Table2, samples 11, 17 and 18), which did not hybridize to pB4, reacted weakly with Hpa-1600.

One previous report has indicated that a 2 kb cDNA probe derived from the 3' end of the genome of the Purdue strain of TGEV could be used to detect TGEV in cell culture or fecal samples from experimentally infected pigs [25] . However, to our knowledge cDNA probes derived from the genome of the virulent Miller strain of TGEV have not been used to detect TGEV RNA in cell culture and clinical field samples. We have established that both the 3' end probes and the E2 gene probes were equivalent in sensitivity for detection of TGEV RNA in cell culture, but in this study, the E2 gene probes were somewhat more sensitive in detecting viral genomic sequences in fecal specimens from pigs naturally infected with TGEV.

            "text": "Published data on the primary nucleotide sequence of the first 2000 bases of the attenuated strain of Purdue TGEV [14] would suggest that probes pA2 and pB4 were derived from a 3' terminal noncoding sequence, which extends 276 bases downstream from the poly (A) tail of the TGEV genome. These two probes may also overlap with the gene coding for the \"postulated\" hydrophobic protein adjacent to the noncoding region in the Purdue TGEV strain. While the significance of the noncoding region is not known, Kapke and Brian [14] speculate that it functions as an attachment region for the polymerase to initiate synthesis of the negative strand RNA. One would assume, and our hybridization results using the 3' terminus probes pA2 and pB4 confirm that this noncoding region is highly conserved among strains of TGEV and the antigenically related coronaviruses, FIPV, FECV, and CCV. However, this region is not conserved among all coronaviruses, because even at the low stringency conditions employed in our dot blot hybridization assay, we could not demonstrate crossreactivity with coronaviruses antigenically unrelated to TGEV. Thus, our data confirm and extend a previous report where a 2 kb probe derived from the 3' terminus of the TGEV genome also cross-hybridized with coronaviruses antigenically related to the parental TGEV, but not coronaviruses belonging to an antigenically unrelated group [25] . Furthermore, results of our study and those of Shockley et al. [25] indicate that conserved sequences on the 3' end of the TGEV genome would be ideal for producing a universal cDNA probe to detect several strains of TGEV. The universality of our 3' end probes pA2 and pB4 was demonstrated by their ability to detect the Miller, Purdue and four field strains of TGEV.",

However, the autoradiographs in that study reveal the most intense hybridization signal with 500 pg of purified TGEV RNA. Studies using other RNA probes to infectious bursal disease virus [11] and rotaviruses [6, 7, 16] detected homologous viral RNA at concentrations ranging from 100 to 1,000 pg. The level of sensitivity inherent to the five TGEV probes used in the present study is within reported sensitivity levels for other cDNA probes of comparable size derived from other RNA viruses. Sensitivity could be improved using larger probe sizes and increasing the specific activity of each probe. Probe length appeared to influence the intensity of the signals as demonstrated by the stronger hybridization signals observed with the 1.6 kb Hpa-1600 probe. However, the different cDNA lengths used to prepare probes did not markedly influence the sensitivity of the assay, because the Hpa-1600 probe detected TGEV RNA at the same concentration as the other cDNA probes, which are approximately one-fifth the length of Hpa-1600. Another possible explanation for the lower than expected sensitivity for detection of TGEV RNA is that coronaviruses are difficult to purify by density gradients and contaminating cellular material may have resulted in an inaccurate spectrophotometrically determined concentration of the actual amount of viral RNA. We did not expect the hybridization of the cDNA probes to yeast tRNA. This reaction may be related to nonspecific binding of the probes to yeast tRNA at the low stringency conditions used in the hybridization assay, since the hybridization was principally observed at the highest concentration of yeast RNA.",

Clinical diagnosis of TGEV infections is determined by EM demonstration of virus particles with coronavirus morphology [22] and/or the detection of viral antigens in intestinal epithelial cells using an immunofluorescence assay on tissue sections [19] . The advantage of both these conventional diagnostic techniques has been the rapid detection of the virus particles or antigens. However, EM requires instrumentation and highly trained technical personnel. Further, certain membrane components in cell culture and clinical samples, which morphologically resemble coronaviruses are often mistaken for true coronaviruses [1] . Immunofluorescence detection of TGEV antigens in cells is best done with fresh tissue and most of the virus infected cells are destroyed within 24 to 36 hours after infection rendering the immunofluorescence assay of little diagnostic value late in infection [20] . Virus isolation is not a useful procedure for the detection of TGEV because most field isolates are not easily adapted to grow in cell culture. In addition, there is a need for a sensitive procedure to detect small quantities of TGEV in the fecal material of carrier sows or subclinically infected swine, which are believed to serve as an important reservoir for infection [23] .",

Thus, the pB4 probe would be expected to recognize sequences on more of the RNAs in an infected cell than the Hpa-1600 and pD24 probes which would react with only a limited number of mRNAs having similar 5' terminal coding sequences. However, results obtained with the Hpa-1600 probe showed a higher percent agreement (88%) with conventional EM and immunofluorescence techniques compared to the pB4 probe results (79% agreement). The higher percent agreement observed for the Hpa-1600 probe may simply reflect the larger region of hybridization of this probe compared to the pB4, since the signal obtained with Hpa-1600 was generally more intense.",

[25] reported that coronavirus particles were generally detected sooner by EM than by either virus isolation or dot blot hybridization. These same investigators also indicated that there appears to be a narrow window of detection for TGEV RNA, which appears to exist between 18 to 30 h after infection. Although TGEV RNA was detected up to 114 h post inoculation in their study, there was a wide variation in the consistency of detection of TGEV RNA; between 40 to 114h D.A. Benfield etal. after inoculation. It is conceivable that the quantity of viral RNA present in the four samples not identified by our probes was below detectable limits or that the RNA was degraded by nucleases in the fecal material. Another possibility is poor filterability of the sample. These four samples were highly viscous and filtration may not have been as efficient as with other preparations, thus a smaller amount of RNA may have bound to the membrane. Also, we cannot rule out of the possiblity of the existence of a second coronavirus serologically related to TGEV, which has a primary nucleotide sequence different from the Miller strain of TGEV.",

No false positives were detected with the pB4 or Hpa-1600 probes, but one sample negative for TGEV by conventional methods of EM and immunofluorescence hybridized to the pD24 probe.

In addition, it takes a minimum of 72 h to complete the hybridization assay compared to 1 to 2 h for either the conventional methods of EM or immunofluorescence. Also for this assay to be practical, the use of nonradioactive probes needs to be investigated.
