PRRSV infection is characterized by reproductive failure including abortion and stillborn piglets in infected pregnant sows and by acute respiratory disease in neonatal and young pigs. Approximately 10 million animals are infected with PRRSV each year in the US with the economic impact reaching 560 million dollars (Neumann et al., 2005) . PRRSV primarily PRRSV Mo-DC IFN-a/b PI3K Post-transcriptional mechanism A B S T R A C T Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) is known to be a poor inducer of interferon alpha/beta (IFN-a/b), which may contribute to the delayed development of adaptive immunity and the resultant viral persistence. However, the exact mechanism by which PRRSV inhibits the induction of IFN-a/b during infection of its natural host cells remains less well defined. Here, we show that PRRSV efficiently activates the transcription of IFN-a/b in porcine monocyte-derived dendritic cells (Mo-DC) in a time-dependent and transient manner; and this effect is dependent on the activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K). Despite the abundant IFN-a transcripts detected in PRRSV-infected Mo-DC, little or no detectable IFN-a is found in the supernatants and cell lysates of PRRSV-infected Mo-DC, suggesting that PRRSV either blocks the translation of IFN-a or inhibits the RNA processing and transport. Furthermore, we observed that PRRSV infection significantly reduced the induction of IFN-a by Poly I:C treatment; and virus replication is essential to the effect since heat-inactivated PRRSV has no effect on IFN-a induction by Poly I:C. Overall, our data provide evidence for the possible role of PI3K in the activation of the transcription of IFN-a/b by PRRSV. We conclude that PRRSV inhibits the induction of IFN-a in Mo-DC by as yet undefined post-transcriptional mechanisms.",

PRRSV infections induce little or no IFN-a/b in vivo and in vitro (Albina et al., 1998; Buddaert et al., 1998) . Studies have further suggested that PRRSV not only failed to induce IFN-a, but also was capable of blocking the IFN-a induction ability of other viruses such as porcine transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus (TGEV) or dsRNA (Poly I:C) in vitro (Albina et al., 1998; Calzada-Nova et al., 2011; Miller et al., 2004) . Overall, the existing evidence clearly suggests that PRRSV may have intrinsic properties to inhibit or reduce the induction of IFN-a/b. Several recent studies have shown the role of nonstructural proteins of PRRSV, especially Nsp1a and Nsp1b, in antagonizing the transcriptional activation of IFN-b in vitro (Beura et al., 2010; Chen et al., 2010; Kim et al., 2010; Song et al., 2010) , but their relevance to the natural host cells such as macrophages and Mo-DC remains unknown.

We have also shown that inhibition of PI3K/Akt by a PI3K specific inhibitor reduced PRRSV replication in Mo-DC (Zhang and Wang, 2010) . Since some previous studies have suggested the possible role of PI3K/Akt activation in mediating the IFN-a induction in plasmacytoid dendritic cells (Guiducci et al., 2008) , it is reasonable to speculate that PRRSV may activate the IFN-a transcription in a PI3Kdependent manner. We sought to determine whether PI3K/Akt activation actually contributes to the activated transcription of IFN-a by PRRSV. We infected Mo-DC with PRRSV in the presence of DMSO or LY294002, a PI3K specific inhibitor. At 4, 12, 24, 48 h after virus infection, Mo-DC treated with Poly I:C and Pam3CSK4 were included as controls. At 4, 12, 24 and 48 h after infection, cells were harvested and used for RNA extraction and real-time RT-PCR as described in the materials and methods. B: Supernatants were collected from the same experiments and used in a quantitative ELISA to determine the production of IFN-a. C: Cell lysates from the same experiments were prepared and used in a quantitative ELISA to determine the production of IFN-a. Representative results of two experiments are shown. cells were harvested for real-time RT-PCR. Supernatants were collected for IFN-a ELISA. We found that treatment of Mo-DC with a PI3K inhibitor prior to PRRSV infection dramatically reduced the transcription of IFN-a (Fig. 1A) . This suggests that PRRSV activates the transcription of IFNa in a PI3K dependent manner in Mo-DC.",

However, the exact mechanism by which PRRSV inhibits the induction of IFN-a/b remains elusive, especially in porcine susceptible cells such as alveolar macrophages and Mo-DC. Although several recent studies have suggested the role of nonstructural proteins of PRRSV, especially Nsp1a and Nsp1b in antagonizing the promoter activity of IFN-b in MARC-145 and human cell culture systems (Beura et al., 2010; Chen et al., 2010; Kim et al., 2010; Song et al., 2010) , their relevance to the PRRSV naturally susceptible porcine cells remains uncertain. More intriguingly, a couple previous studies have clearly demonstrated that PRRSV activated the transcription of IFN-a/b in vitro and in vivo as evidenced by the increased mRNA molecules detected by real-time RT-PCR (Chung et al., 2004; Lee et al., 2004) . A similar observation was reported for mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) (Rose and Weiss, 2009) . Although the nucleocapsid protein and two nonstructural proteins (nsp1 and nsp3) of MHV have been reported to antagonize the IFN promoter activity, IFN is induced in primary cell types such as plasmacytoid dendritic cells and macrophages. Here, we have observed that PRRSV efficiently activated the transcription of IFN-a/b in porcine Mo-DC. Abundant and a comparable level of IFN-a/b transcripts was induced by PRRSV and Poly I:C in Mo-DC. However, PRRSV blocked the induction of IFN-a in Mo-DC by as yet undefined post-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms. This agrees with the conclusions of the study on porcine alveolar macrophages by Lee et al. (Lee et al., 2004) . Our results are contradictory to an earlier study, which showed that neither Poly I:C nor PRRSV activated the transcription of IFN-a in Mo-DC at 12 and 24 h after treatment (Loving et al., 2007) . Our results also support the conclusion that virus replication is essential to the inhibition of IFN-a/b induction by PRRSV as reported by Albina et al. (Albina et al., 1998) , but contradictory to the results of a more recent study which showed that virus replication is not necessary to the suppressive activity of IFN-a/b induction by PRRSV (Calzada-Nova et al., 2011) in plasmacytoid dendritic cells. We have further demonstrated that the increased transcription of IFN-a is mainly mediated by the activation of PI3K by PRRSV since the use of a PI3K specific inhibitor prior to PRRSV infection significantly reduced the transcripts of IFNa upon PRRSV infection. This is in agreement with the previous study showing the critical role of PI3K mediated IRF-7 in the induction IFN-a in plasmacytoid dendritic cells by CpG ODN (a TLR9 ligand) and influenza A virus (a TLR7 ligand) (Guiducci et al., 2008) . Our previous study has suggested that PRRSV activated the PI3K/Akt pathway during early infection to facilitate virus replication process. Here, we have further shown the positive correlation between PI3K activation and increased transcription of IFN-a. It seems that the PI3K/Akt pathway may be important in both virus's survival and replication and host's innate defense mechanism, suggesting a delicately controlled balance between virus's offense and host's defense mechanisms. A very similar role of PI3K/Akt in both virus replication and host defense has been suggested previously for influenza A virus (Ehrhardt et al., 2006) .",
