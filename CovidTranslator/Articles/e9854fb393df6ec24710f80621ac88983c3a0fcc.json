Bacteriological and toxocological research has not been able to reveal any definite etiological factor, although pesticide residues have been demonstrated to some extent. This must of course bring viruses into consideration. A synergistic action between pesticides and virus seems one possible working hypothesis in this connection. Since Norwegian seabird colonies in general are rather frequently visited by scientists, students, holiday travellers and the local public, the recent documentation of the ability of I. uriae to attack man (18) raises the question of public health implications. Isolations from I. urine of Uukuniemi viruses (30, 31, 33) orbiviruses (12, 32) and flaviviruses (9, 33) ill addition to Runde virus further stresses this point.",
