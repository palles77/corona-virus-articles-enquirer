            "text": "Ophthalmic examination of rabbits can be performed easily. 43, 44 The eyes are laterally located and have a round pupil. Evaluation of a menace response is difficult, but most rabbits will react to bright light by squinting. The dorsal rectus muscle can usually be seen as a large striated band of tissue under the conjunctiva. Some rabbits do not respond to topical application of mydriatic agents because of the natural presence of atropinase. In these rabbits, the addition of 10% phenylephrine may help to obtain mydriasis. Rabbits have a merangiotic fundus. The well-myelinated optic nerve is present above the visual axis and has a deep optic cup. Retinal blood vessels are present in a linear streak medial and lateral to the optic nerve. An extensive venous plexus is present in the orbit. Tear production in rabbits can be measured by using Schirmer tear test strips. Average tear production is 5 mm/min (standard deviation, \u00b12.4 mm/min) 1 ; however, very low values can be measured in some normal rabbits. Normal intraocular pressure measured by applanation tonometry is between 10 and 20 mm Hg.",

After instilling a topical ophthalmic anesthetic, use a 23-gauge lacrimal cannula or a 24-gauge Teflon intravenous catheter to flush the duct ( Fig. 39-2) . Recurrence of the obstruction is common, and duct irrigation may need to be repeated every 2 to 3 days or weekly until a few consecutive clear irrigations are obtained. If topical antibiotic therapy is used, a broad-spectrum medication such as triple antibiotic solution is recommended. Topical nonsteroidal, anti-inflammatory ophthalmic medications, such as 0.03% flurbiprofen or 1% diclofenac, may help minimize irritation caused by the procedure. In rabbits with chronic or severe infections, concurrent topical ophthalmic and systemic antibiotic therapy may be needed. Suggested combinations include systemic enrofloxacin (Baytril, Bayer Corporation, Shawnee Mission, KS) and topical ciprofloxacin (Ciloxan, Alcon Laboratories, Inc., Fort Worth, TX) or gentamicin.

Ophthalmic examination reveals a circular membrane that originates at the limbus (the junction of the cornea and sclera) and gradually advances over the cornea. In severe cases, only a small central opening is present, allowing visibility of an otherwise normal globe. The membrane does not adhere to the cornea. The cause of this condition is unknown, although trauma has been suggested. Progressive membranous occlusion in rabbits has been compared with pterygium in humans. However, in humans the membrane is triangular and adherent to the cornea, whereas in rabbits it is nonadherent and circumferential from the limbus. Treatment with topical antibiotic or antibiotic-steroid medications has no effect. Surgically resecting the membrane and treating with topical antibiotics after surgery usually result in quick recurrence of the membrane. However, resecting the membrane a few millimeters beyond the limbus and treating with a topical antibiotic-steroid combination after surgery may prevent recurrence. Good results have also been obtained with surgical resection and the use of topical cyclosporine. Another described surgical technique is to incise the membrane into four quarters and suture each quadrant of the membrane to the inside of the eyelids. 35 With this technique, recurrence may be prevented for at least 1 year.",

Many rabbits infected with E. cuniculi are asymptomatic, but neurologic signs can include convulsions, tremors, torticollis, paresis, and coma. Encephalitozoon cuniculi infection has also been associated with phacoclastic uveitis. In one report, examination of phacofragmentation fluid from a rabbit revealed the presence of E. cuniculi DNA. 38 Most affected rabbits are young (less than 2 years), and dwarf rabbits appear predisposed to disease. Clinically, a white mass is often seen protruding into the anterior chamber ( Fig. 39-4) . Careful examination of the anterior segment of the eye with slit lamp biomicroscopy may reveal a break in the anterior lens capsule. The break is frequently hidden by inflammatory material and it may appear as if only the iris is involved in the inflammatory process. A focal cataract is often present in the area of the anterior lens capsule break. Signs of a severe pyogranulomatous anterior uveitis are usually present, such as conjunctival hyperemia, a swollen hyperemic iris, miosis, aqueous flare, and low intraocular pressure. The posterior segment of the eye is initially normal; however, if left untreated, severe uveitis and cataract formation can lead to blindness and possible phthisis bulbi or glaucoma. An abscess in the iris caused by P. multocida initially may resemble phacoclastic uveitis. Measuring serum antibody titers for E. cuniculi and P. multocida may aid in the differential diagnosis. Treatment of choice is surgical removal of the lens by phacofragmentation. Because of the rabbit's ability to regenerate a lens after this procedure, inserting an artificial lens after phacofragmentation is not recommended. Systemic treatment of E. cuniculi with albendazole (30 mg/kg PO q24h for 30 days, then 15 mg/kg PO q24h for an additional 30 days) has been reported. 38 More recently, fenbendazole (20 mg/kg q24h for 28 days) has proved effective in both preventing experimental E. cuniculi infection in rabbits and treating naturally infected, seropositive rabbits. 39 If the lens is not removed surgically, control of the uveitis with topical steroidal (such as 1% prednisolone acetate) and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications as well as systemic fenbendazole or albendazole is necessary. Enucleation may be indicated if the uveitis cannot be controlled medically and a chronic painful eye is present. 46",

Dental disease with tooth root abscessation is often a predisposing factor, and a good dental examination and skull radiographs are indicated in any rabbit with a suspected retrobulbar mass (see Chapter 34) . If available, a computed tomography scan is especially helpful in diagnosis (Fig. 39-5) . Retrobulbar neoplasia is uncommon in rabbits.",

Because of the thick nature of the abscessed material, drainage of the abscess through the mouth, as performed in dogs and cats, may or may not be successful. If the abscess is caused by an abscessed tooth root, the tooth or teeth must be extracted to allow drainage and the rabbit must be treated with long-term systemic antibiotic therapy. In some cases, aggressive surgical debridement may be necessary. This may include exenteration of the orbit and sacrifice of a sighted eye. Even with aggressive surgical and medical management, the prognosis for recovery is always guarded. Anecdotal reports suggest some rabbits with retrobulbar abscesses respond to medical therapy with long-term (3 months) administration of benzathine/procaine penicillin G (for rabbits <2.5 kg, 75,000 U/ rabbit SC q48h; for rabbits >2.5 kg, 150,000 U/rabbit SC q48h). 34 Exophthalmos in obese rabbits may be caused by excessive fat deposition in the orbit. Periodic exophthalmos has been reported in rabbits with thymomas. 21, 42 In one report, a localized myasthenia gravis associated with the thymoma was suggested as a cause. 42 More probably, the presence of a large intrathoracic mass obstructs blood flow in the right and left cranial vena cava, causing decreased vascular drainage from the head. Exophthalmos was also reported in a rabbit after chronic external jugular catheter placement 17 and has been seen clinically in a rabbit with erally to the brain, whereas in albino ferrets, only 1500 retinal ganglion cells project ipsilaterally. The significance of this difference has not been established.",

Severity ranged from clinically insignificant, small cataracts in the posterior cortex of the lens to blinding complete cataracts. By 18 months of age, cataracts were detected in virtually every animal, and in animals previously diagnosed, the cataracts had progressed. A genetically separate group had a combination of blinding cataract, microphthalmos, abnormal iris formation, and retinal detachment. In another ferret colony, microphthalmos, cataract, retinal dysplasia, and a persistent hyperplastic primary vitreous-type membrane were shown to be inherited as an autosomal dominant defect. 11 Dietary factors may play a role in the development of cataracts in ferrets. A diet high in fat or deficient in vitamin E or protein may promote cataract formation. 26 Monitor the eyes of ferrets with cataracts regularly for the onset of secondary complications. Lens-induced uveitis can usually be controlled with topical 1% prednisolone acetate once or twice daily. Other complications caused by cataracts include lens subluxation or luxation and glaucoma. Ferrets that are blind because of cataracts usually adjust well in a home environment. However, cataract surgery can be performed successfully in ferrets. The lenses can be removed by phacofragmentation or by an extracapsular technique. Artificial lenses are not available in a size suitable for ferrets. Before cataract surgery, make sure the ferret becomes accustomed to frequent application of eye medications to facilitate easy treatment after surgery.",

Blepharitis with crust formation in the medial canthus and partial periocular alopecia were observed in mice experimentally infected with Trypanosoma brucei. 36 Conjunctivitis in mice can be caused by numerous infectious agents, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa, P. pneumotropica, Salmonella species, Streptobacillus moniliformis, Corynebacterium kutscheri, Lancefield group C streptococci, Mycoplasma pulmonis, mousepox or ectromelia virus, Sendai virus, and lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus. 20 Bacteriologic culture and sensitivity testing may be indicated in individual rats and mice with persistent conjunctivitis.

Sialodacryoadenitis virus is a highly contagious coronavirus that replicates in the respiratory tract epithelium, causing rhinotracheitis, bronchitis, and alveolitis. The virus also causes sialoadenitis of the submandibular and parotid salivary glands and necrotizing dacryoadenitis of orbital and harderian lacrimal glands. Exophthalmos, epiphora, and keratoconjunctivitis may result. The infection usually resolves within 1 week in immunocompetent animals. In a study of athymic rats, infection persisted for more than 3 months, indicating that normal T-cell function is required for host defenses against the virus. 42 Infection with sialodacryoadenitis virus may also result in uveitis and multifocal retinal degeneration. 20 Complications from infection include corneal opacification, anterior and posterior synechiae, cataract, and glaucoma. Specific therapy is not available, and treatment is supportive only. Other causes for red tears include infection with parainfluenza virus type 3 or Sendai virus as well as pain or stress. Ammonia vapor from soiled bedding can act as an ocular irritant, predisposing animals to secondary infection. Keeping the housing areas well ventilated is important in preventing infection with sialodacryoadenitis virus.",
