            "text": "Several severe respiratory virus infections that have emerged during the past decade originated in animals, including bats. In Indonesia, exposure to bats has been associated with increased risk of acquiring orthoreovirus infection. Although orthoreovirus infections are mild and self-limiting, we explored their potential for evolution into a more virulent form. We used conventional virus culture, electron microscopy, and molecular sequencing to isolate and identify orthoreoviruses from 3 patients in whom respiratory tract infection developed after travel to Indonesia. Virus characterization by plaque-reduction neutralization testing showed antigenic similarity, but sequencing of the small segment genes suggested virus reassortment, which could lead to increased virulence. Bats as a reservoir might contribute to virus evolution and genetic diversity, giving orthoreoviruses the potential to become more virulent. Evolution of this virus should be closely monitored so that prevention and control measures can be taken should it become more virulent.",

Members of the genus Orthoreovirus are classifi ed as fusogenic or nonfusogenic, depending on their ability to cause syncytium formation in cell culture. Genetically, orthoreoviruses contain 10 segments: 3 large, 3 medium, and 4 small (S1, S2, S3, and S4). The characteristic of the segmented genome facilitates virus reassortment, which contributes to virus diversity. Sequencing studies indicate that reassortment in nature is a major determinant of reovirus evolution (1, 2) .",

The role of bats as reservoirs and sources of potential emerging viral infections has been extensively studied with regard to Nipah, Hendra, lyssavirus, and coronaviruses (6, 7, 10) . Although we were unable to demonstrate rises in antibody titers because of a lack of paired acute-phase and convalescent-phase serum samples, we believe that the isolation of fusogenic orthoreoviruses, the presence 946 Emerging Infectious Diseases \u2022 www.cdc.gov/eid \u2022 Vol. 18, No. 6, June 2012 of antibody to the viruses, and epidemiologic information suggest that orthoreoviruses were possibly associated with the patients' upper respiratory tract infections. Similar to infection caused by Melaka virus, the infection in the patients reported here was a mild upper respiratory infection followed by full recovery. Also, similar to the 7-day incubation period of the patient infected with Melaka virus, incubation periods for the patients reported here ranged from 4 to 7 days. The crossreactivity of the 3 virus strains, demonstrated by PRNT, suggests that they were antigenically similar. Neutralizing antibodies appeared within 8 days of disease onset, and titers were still high at 2 months. Although all persons who had been in contact with the patients during their travel and at home were asymptomatic, no serum was available for further workup to determine subclinical infection or human-to-human transmission. Nevertheless, subclinical infection and transmission among close contacts have been demonstrated (3, 4) .",

Infections occurred in humans when the pathogens crossed the species barrier to expand their host range. Changes in human activities also bring humans in close contact with animals (6, 8, (13) (14) (15) . Epidemiologic and molecular studies provide evidence that the pathogens isolated from humans shared a high degree of homology with viruses isolated from their animal reservoirs (8, 15) . The ability of a pathogen to emerge and cause outbreaks depends on the effi ciency of its human-to-human spread. Recombination and reassortment events facilitate virus adaptation in the new host. Further study is warranted to unravel the possible virus spillover and adaptation of orthoreoviruses as a cause of human infection. Although symptoms of orthoreovirus infection are mild and self-limiting, continued close monitoring of virus evolution and further study are essential. Changes in virulence would signal the need for prevention and control strategies.",
