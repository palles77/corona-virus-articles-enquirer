It is shown that there are a weak focus of multiplicity at most two and a cusp of codimension at most two for various parameter values, and the model undergoes saddle-node bifurcation, Bogdanov-Takens bifurcation of codimension two, Hopf bifurcation, and degenerate Hopf bifurcation of codimension two as the parameters vary. It is shown that there exists a critical value \u03b1 = \u03b1 0 for the psychological effect, and two critical values k = k 0 , k 1 (k 0 < k 1 ) for the infection rate such that: (i) when \u03b1 > \u03b1 0 , or \u03b1 \u2264 \u03b1 0 and k \u2264 k 0 , the disease will die out for all positive initial populations; (ii) when \u03b1 = \u03b1 0 and k 0 < k \u2264 k 1 , the disease will die out for almost all positive initial populations; (iii) when \u03b1 = \u03b1 0 and k > k 1 , the disease will persist in the form of a positive coexistent steady state for some positive initial populations; and (iv) when \u03b1 < \u03b1 0 and k > k 0 , the disease will persist in the form of multiple positive periodic coexistent oscillations and coexistent steady states for some positive initial populations. Numerical simulations, including the existence of one or two limit cycles and data-fitting of the influenza data in Mainland China, are presented to illustrate the theoretical results.",

The incidence rate g(I )S plays a very important role in describing the evolution of infectious disease. In [16] Kermack and McKendrick assumed that the incidence rate is bilinear, i.e., g(I )S = kI S, (1.2) where g(I ) = kI is unbounded when I \u2265 0. The bilinear incidence rate (1.2) might be true when the number of the infective individuals I (t) is small, but it becomes unrealistic when I (t) is getting larger. Studying the data on the cholera epidemic spread in Bari, Italy, in 1973, Capasso et al. [5] and Capasso and Serio [6] proposed two types of nonlinear incidence rates, namely a saturated incidence rate and an incidence rate taking psychological effect into account (see Fig. 1.1) .",

Notice that the nonlinear incidence function g(I ) eventually tends to a saturation level k \u03b1 when I is getting larger. The general incidence rate g(I )S = kI p S 1 + \u03b1I q (1.4) was proposed by Liu et al. [20] (q = p \u2212 1) and Hethcote and van den Driessche [13] (p \u2265 q), and used by a number of authors, see, for example, Alexander and Moghadas [1, 2] , Derrick and van den Driessche [9, 10] , Li et al. [17] , Liu et al. [19] , Lizana and Rivero [21] , Moghadas and Alexande [22] , and Wang [28] . According to Tang et al. [27] and Hu et al. [14] , the incidence function g(I ) = kI p 1+\u03b1I q includes three types: (i) unbounded incidence function: p > q; (ii) saturated incidence function: p = q; and (iii) nonmonotone incidence function: p < q. In order to better understand the generic bifurcations in SIRS models with saturated incidence rates, Ruan and Wang [25] studied model (1.1) with a specific nonlinear incidence rate, g(I )S = kI 2 S 1 + \u03b1I 2 , (1.5) and presented a detailed qualitative and bifurcation analysis of the model. (b) Nonmonotone Incidence Rates with Psychological Effect. Though Capasso and Serio [6] described incidence functions taking into account psychological effect, but they did not give any specific function to describe such incidence. To model the effects of psychological factor, protection measures and intervention policies when a serious disease emerges, Xiao and Ruan [29] proposed the following specific incidence rate:",

This implies that the contact rate and the infection probability are increasing when a new infectious disease emerges, since people have very little knowledge about the disease. However, when I is large and the disease becomes more serious, psychological factor leads people to implementing measures to control the spread of the disease. For example, in the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), the aggressive measures and policies, such as border screening, mask wearing, quarantine, isolation, etc. were proved to be very effective in reducing the transmission. So the infection force decreases when the number of infected individuals becomes larger. Liu et al. [18] used (1.6) to describe the psychological effect toward avian influenza in the human population. In [29] , Xiao and Ruan presented a global analysis for model (1.1) with nonmonotone incidence rate (1.6) , and showed that either the number of infective individuals tends to zero as time evolves or the disease persists. Hence, model (1.1) with nonmonotone incidence rate (1.6) cannot exhibit complicated dynamics and bifurcations.",

Thus, a more reasonable incidence function g(I ) may be one that first increases to a maximum when a new infectious disease emerges or an old infectious disease reemerges, then decreases due to psychological effect, and eventually tends to a saturation level due to crowding effect. On the other hand, in some specific infectious diseases, the incidence rate may not be monotonic or non-monotonic alone, a more general incidence rate may have a combination of monotonicity, nonmonotonicity and saturation properties.",

It can be seen from Fig. 1 .2 that when \u03b1 and k are fixed, g(I ) increases faster for smaller \u03b2 when I is small, and then decreases to the same fixed value k \u03b1 for any \u03b2. When \u03b2 = 0, the general incidence rate (1.8) becomes the saturated incidence rate (1.5). Ruan and Wang [25] studied model (1.1) with incidence rate (1.5) and presented a detailed qualitative and bifurcation analysis of the model. They showed that the system undergoes Bogdanov-Takens bifurcation of codimension two and Hopf bifurcation of codimension one, but the exact codimension of Hopf bifurcation remains unknown. In [27] , Tang et al. proved that the maximal multiplicity of the weak focus is two by complex algebraic calculations but did not give the explicit conditions for degenerate Hopf bifurcation.

By considering a more general model, our results show that Bogdanov-Takens bifurcation of codimension higher than two cannot occur, which clarifies and corrects the corresponding results obtained by Tang et al.

Furthermore, it is shown that there exists a critical value \u03b1 = \u03b1 0 for the psychological or inhibitory effect, and two critical values k = k 0 , k 1 (k 0 < k 1 ) for the infection rate such that: (i) when \u03b1 > \u03b1 0 , or \u03b1 \u2264 \u03b1 0 and k \u2264 k 0 , the disease will die out for all positive initial populations; (ii) when \u03b1 = \u03b1 0 and k 0 < k \u2264 k 1 , the disease will die out for almost all positive initial populations; (iii) when \u03b1 = \u03b1 0 and k > k 1 , the disease will persist in the form of a positive coexistent steady state for some positive initial populations; and (iv) when \u03b1 < \u03b1 0 and k > k 0 , the disease will persist in the form of multiple positive periodic coexistent oscillations and coexistent steady states for some positive initial populations.",

Next we first perturb q such that q increases to 23 15 + 0.1, then \u1ebc 2 (1, 1) becomes a stable multiple focus with multiplicity one, an unstable limit cycle occurs around \u1ebc 2 (1, 1) which is the outer limit cycle in Fig. 3 .5. Secondly, we perturb a such that a decreases to 1 \u2212 0.003, then \u1ebc 2 (1, 1) becomes an unstable hyperbolic focus, another stable limit cycle occurs around \u1ebc 2 (1, 1), which is the inner limit cycle in Fig. 3 .5. Fig. 3 .5, we can see that the existence of multiple periodic coexistent oscillations and coexistent steady states when the psychological effect \u03b1 is smaller than the critical value \u03b1 0 but the infection rate k is greater than the first critical value k 0 , i.e., n < n * and A > mp. The disease will die out for almost all initial populations outside the outer unstable periodic orbit, and will tend to periodic outbreaks for almost all initial populations on or inside the outer unstable periodic orbit, and will persist in the form of positive steady states when the initial population lies on the positive equilibria or their stable manifolds.",

In this paper, we considered the SIRS epidemic model (1.1) with a generalized nonmonotone and saturated incidence function g(I ) = kI 2 1+\u03b2I +\u03b1I 2 , which exhibits three different properties: (i) when \u03b2 \u2265 0, g(I ) is monotonic, which always increases and then tends to a saturated level k \u03b1 as I intends to infinite. (ii) When \u22122 \u221a \u03b1 < \u03b2 < 0, g(I ) is nonmonotonic, which increases when I is small and decreases when I is large, and finally tends to a saturated level k \u03b1 as I tends to infinite (see Fig. 1.2) , which can be used to describe the phenomenon that the infection force first increases to a maximum when a new infectious disease emerges, and then decreases due to psychological effect and eventually tends to a saturation level due to crowding effect. (iii) When \u03b2 > \u22122 \u221a \u03b1, g(I ) has both properties of (i) and (ii), i.e., g(I ) is first nonmonotonic and then monotonic when \u03b2 increases from negative to positive. In this paper, we performed qualitative and bifurcation analysis, and found that the model (1.1) with general incidence rate (1.8) has complicated dynamical behaviors and bifurcation phenomena. It has been shown that there exists a weak focus of multiplicity at most two and a cusp of codimension at most two for various parameter values, and the model undergoes saddle-node bifurcation, Bogdanov-Takens bifurcation of codimension two, Hopf bifurcation and degenerate Hopf bifurcation of codimension two as the parameter values vary. By considering a more general model, our results show that Bogdanov-Takens bifurcation of codimension higher than two cannot occur, which clarifies and corrects the corresponding results by Tang et al. [27] . Moreover, our results about degenerate Hopf bifurcation (i.e., Hopf bifurcation of codimension two) can also be seen as a complement of the results in Ruan and Wang [25] . We also used model (2.1) to simulate the reported human influenza data from 2004 to 2017 reported by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention.",

            "text": "In recent years, people realize the importance of the inhibition effect from the behavioral change of susceptible individuals when their number increases or from the crowding effect of the infective individuals, and the psychological effect or inhibition effect can cause people to adopt some aggressive measures and policies, such as border screening, mask wearing, quarantine, isolation and so on, which have been proved to be very effective in reducing the contact rate or the infection force. However, it is difficult to measure the psychological effect. So can we give a quantitative description about the psychological effect with respect to variation of the parameters involved in the infectious diseases? In this paper, we presented a concrete critical value to measure the psychological effect. More specifically, we have shown that there exists a critical value \u03b1 = \u03b1 0 for the psychological or inhibitory effect and two critical values k = k 0 , k 1 (k 0 < k 1 ) for the infection rate such that: (i) when \u03b1 > \u03b1 0 , or \u03b1 \u2264 \u03b1 0 and k \u2264 k 0 , the disease will die out for all positive initial populations; (ii) when \u03b1 = \u03b1 0 and k 0 < k \u2264 k 1 , the disease will die out for almost all positive initial populations; (iii) when \u03b1 = \u03b1 0 and k > k 1 , the disease will persist in the form of a positive coexistent steady state for some positive initial populations; and (iv) when \u03b1 < \u03b1 0 and k > k 0 , the disease will persist in the form of multiple positive periodic coexistent oscillations and coexistent steady states for some positive initial populations.",
