Design: Serial cross-sectional design with five consecutive surveys. Setting: Nationwide general population in South Korea. Participants: These included 5,015 respondents (aged 19 years) from the general population during the MERS-CoV epidemic. Primary and secondary outcome measures: The main outcome measures were 1) personallevel risk perception and 2) societal-level risk perception. Multivariate logistic regression models were used to identify the factors associated with risk perceptions.",

Generally, precautionary behaviors are likely to depend directly upon personal-level risk perception; however that of societal-level risk perception may not affect behaviors directly.

Nearly half of the participants were female, aged <50 years, were educated up to high school or below, were from the affected area, showed disapproval of the president or the ruling party, and had personal-level risk perception. Majority of the participants were employed, were in the middle economic status, metropolitan, without societal-level risk perception (controlled). Figure 1 reports how the outbreak proceeded, with three overlapping transmission periods, the timing of the five independent surveys, and the risk perception rates. Noticeable differences were investigated between personal-level and societal-level risk proportions throughout the epidemic periods. Overall risk perception at personal-level proportion (56.5%) was nearly two times higher than at societal-level (30.3%). Personal-level risk perception proportions were always higher than societal-level during the present study periods. Of the personal-level risk perception, proportion was initially high during survey 1 (67.3%), declined during survey 2 (55.1%), temporally rose during survey 3 (62.8%), and declined again during surveys 4 and 5 (52.2% and 44.9%, respectively). A similar trend was observed in the societal-level risk perception proportions. The percentages of respondents who reported as being \"worried\" or \"uncontrolled\" decreased gradually after survey 3. Societal-level risk perception proportions decreased more rapidly than personal-level, over time, from 52.6% and 62.8% in survey 3 to 9.0% and 44.9% in survey 5, respectively. At the beginning of the occurrences of tertiary and quaternary cases, we identified high perceived risk in both the personal-level and societal-level proportions. 29 ; 95% CI 1.27-6.66). Higher level of education was also associated with lower level of risk perception at the personal-level, but was not statistically significant except university degree in the overall survey (aOR 0.73; 95% CI 0.55-0.96). Lower economic status and those living in metropolitan cities paid more attention to the personal-level risk of MERS-CoV in the overall model.

Risk perception increased with new generations of transmission, such as with the tertiary and quaternary infection. Both risk perceptions tended to decrease over time and the societal-level risk perception declined more rapidly. Given that external stimuli are extreme events, two different reactions can occur: the affective reaction (risk-as-feelings) and cognitive reaction (risk-as-analysis). 19 20 Previous studies suggest that affective reaction is quick, intuitive, automatic, while cognitive reaction is slow, deliberate, and probability calculative.

The traditional impersonal-impact hypothesis proposes that cognitive reaction is more likely to correlate with societal-level risk perception than that of the personal-level. 5 8 Because the societal-level risk perception decreased rapidly, this study does not seem to support that cognitive reaction is more closely related to societallevel risk perception. While the affective or cognitive reaction do not individually make an impact on the different stages of epidemic; however, they can affect it together, simultaneously, indicating both personal and societal level risk perceptions. 17 Additional research is needed to understand why the personal-level risk perception was doubled and lasted longer than that of the societal-level.",

In the group that did not approve of the president, the probabilities of risk perception were higher at the individual-level than at the societal-level, but not for the party identification.

Those who did not support the president were reported to have had higher risk perception in both the affective and cognitive levels. In the group that did not approve of the president, the probabilities of risk perception were higher at the cognitive dimension than at affective dimension. In the early days of the MERS-COV outbreak, the government did not specify details regarding scientifically uncertain information in order to reduce public anxiety over the crisis, nor did the government disclose which hospitals the confirmed patients had visited. This resulted in increased public distrust in the government. 4 5 8 9 Similar pattern of distrust in the government was associated with the spread of infection, during the outbreak of Ebola. 34 35 Those who disapproved of the ruling party had also higher risk perceptions.",

Further research is needed to determine why the same female group showed differences in perceived risk for affective and cognitive levels. The older the respondents, the lower the perceived cognitive dimension, but the opposite occurred weakly at the affective risk perception. The correlation with age and affective risk perception was not significant in the most model (survey 1, survey 2, survey 3, survey 4 models).

Affective risk perception proportions were always higher than cognitive dimension during the present study periods. Of the affective risk perception, proportion was initially high during survey 1 (55.0%), rose during survey 2 (62.8%), and declined again during surveys 3 and 4 (52.2% and 44.9%, respectively). A similar trend was observed in the cognitive risk perception proportions. The percentages of respondents who reported as being \"worried\" or \"spread further\" decreased gradually after survey 2. Cognitive risk perception proportions decreased more rapidly than affective aspect, over time, from 52.6% and 62.8% in survey 2 to 9.0% and 44.9% in survey 4, respectively. At the beginning of the occurrences of tertiary and quaternary cases, we identified high perceived risk in both the affective and cognitive aspects proportions. Table 3 shows the association between variables and risk perception of MERS-CoV at the affective dimension. The result showed that gender, age, educational attainment, self-reported economic status, area, presidential job approval rating, and party identification were significantly associated with affective risk perception. Women (adjusted OR [aOR] 1.72-2.00; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.14-2.86) were more likely to perceive MERS-CoV risk at affective dimension, which decreased with time, and subsequently increased again. Groups of older than 40 years were less aware of the risk (aOR 0.58-0.76; 95% CI 0.28-1.56) in survey 1; however, they perceived the risk more over time (aOR 2.84-3.29; 95% CI 1.27-6.66) in survey 4. The association of education with affective risk perception was non-significant except university degree in the overall survey (aOR 0.73; 95% CI 0.55-0.96). Lower economic status and those living in metropolitan cities paid more attention to the affective risk of MERS-CoV in the overall model.

After party identification was adjusted for, we examined correlation with trust and risk perception. It is consistent with previous studies that trust in government could shape the public`s risk perception (both affective and cognitive). 21 22 26 27 However, the previous studies have not distinguished between affective and cognitive reaction when evaluating the impact of trust regarding contagious diseases during outbreaks. 3 12 23 24 28-30 Our findings suggest that trust in government is correlated with both affective and cognitive risk perception and it is important to understand the relationship between trust in government and two different aspects of risk perceptions. Those who did not support the president were reported to have had higher risk perception in both the affective and cognitive levels. In the group that did not approve of the president, the probabilities of risk perception were higher at the cognitive dimension than at affective dimension. In the early days of the MERS-COV outbreak, the government did not specify details regarding scientifically uncertain information in order to reduce public anxiety over the crisis, nor did the government disclose which hospitals the confirmed patients had visited. This resulted in increased public distrust in the government. 4 5 8 9 Similar patterns of distrust in the government was associated with the spread of infection, during the outbreak of Ebola. 34 35 Those who disapproved of the ruling party had also higher risk perceptions. Identification of party can be classified in the political aspect of trust. 36 There is need to investigate further comprehensive understanding of trust`s effect on risk perception. 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59  60   F  o  r  p  e  e  r  r  e  v  i  e  w  o  n  l  y 17 Third, we found that gender, age, self-reported economic status, residential area, party identification correlated significantly with risk perception. According to multiple logistic regression analyses, being female predisposed to greater risk perception at the affective risk perception, but not at the cognitive dimension. Previous studies that investigated risk perception by gender also showed that a lower risk perception was associated with the male gender. 3 28 37-39 Possible explanation for lower perception of risk by male are that male have more to gain from risky behaviors. 40 However, previous studies did not distinguish between the level of risk perception. Further research is needed to determine why the same female group showed differences in perceived risk for affective and cognitive levels. The older the respondents, the lower the perceived cognitive dimension, but the opposite occurred weakly in the affective risk perception. The correlation with age and affective risk perception was not significant in most model (survey 1, survey 2, survey 3 models). After trust in government was adjusted for, we found correlation between older age and lower cognitive risk perception.",

[41] [42] [43] The location effect on risk perception also was evaluated in this study, but it was not clear the correlation with risk proximity and risk perception. 44 There were no significant differences in the proportions of those with risk perception according to the major socioeconomic characteristics (education, income level, occupation). It is necessary to further investigate the correlation with demographic factors and risk perception. 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59  60   F  o  r  p  e  e  r  r  e  v  i  e  w  o  n  l  y   18 This study, which used a serial cross-sectional study design had some limitations. First, the study used a cross-sectional study design. Thus, causal relations between personal characteristics and risk perceptions could not be determined-rather, it could only suggest their relevance. Second, this study could not evaluate the intensity of risk perception, because it only included questions focusing on whether or not participants recognized the risk at the different levels. It would be useful to evaluate risk perceptions of respondents qualitatively if questions about the circumstances and characteristics of risk perception were surveyed in future studies.",

Multivariate logistic regression models were used to identify the factors (demographic, socioeconomic, area, political orientation) associated with risk perceptions. Results: Both affective and cognitive risk perceptions decreased as the MERS-CoV epidemic progressed.

Design: Serial cross-sectional design with four consecutive surveys. Setting: Nationwide general population in South Korea. Participants: Overall 4,010 respondents (aged 19 years) from the general population during the MERS-CoV epidemic were included. Primary and secondary outcome measures: The main outcome measures were 1) affective risk perception, 2) cognitive risk perception, and 3) trust in the government. Multivariate logistic regression models were used to identify factors (demographic, socioeconomic, area, political orientation) associated with risk perceptions. Results: Both affective and cognitive risk perceptions decreased as the MERS-CoV epidemic progressed. Proportions of affective risk perception were higher in all surveys and slowly decreased compared to cognitive risk perception over time. Females (adjusted OR [aOR] 1.72-2.00; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.14-2.86) and lower self-reported economic status respondents were more likely to perceive the affective risk. The older the adults, the higher the affective risk perception, but the lower the cognitive risk perception compared to younger adults. The respondents who had low trust in the government had higher affective (aOR 2.19-3.11; 95 CI 1.44-4.67) and cognitive (aOR 3.55-5.41; 95 CI 1.44-9.01) risk perceptions.",
