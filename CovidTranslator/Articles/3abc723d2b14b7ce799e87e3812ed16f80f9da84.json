In the pediatric wellness examinations, an important part of the veterinarian's job is to educate the client. A client who hears the same or similar recommendations from different sources within the hospital is much more likely to comply with those recommendations. For example, one veterinarian in a three-doctor practice may feel that strictly indoor cats do not require feline leukemia virus (FeLV) testing. The second veterinarian may recommend testing only in multiple cat households. The third veterinarian may recommend testing for all cats but leave it up to the client to decide. Inconsistencies create confusion with clients, as well as support staff, and the client is much less likely to follow any of the recommendations given. A pediatric standard of care allows clinicians to practice better overall medicine. Every private small animal practice experiences busy days, juggling multiple patients simultaneously. With an established set of guidelines and protocols, there is less chance of omitting a FeLV test, failing to recommend a fecal flotation, or forgetting to discuss a particular aspect of behavior and training on those busy days. The pediatric visits are more likely to become a complete health care program, both medically and behaviorally, rather than a series of vaccines and deworming.",

This is a team effort in Puppies and kittens make up a large part of the private small animal practice. Developing and implementing a pediatric wellness program and standard of care are important aspects of ensuring consistent, comprehensive health care for pediatric patients, as well as promoting a long-term, clientpractice bond. One of the best ways to begin this process is to establish a pediatric standard of care that is unique to your practice. A properly developed standard of care ensures that all puppies and kittens receive consistent care during their individual office visits and throughout their long-term pediatric care. According to the New England Journal of Medicine, standard of care is defined as a diagnostic or treatment process that a clinician should follow for a certain type of patient, illness, or clinical circumstance.",

Even clinicians within a practice have different interests and practice styles, which lead to similar cases being treated very differently within the same hospital.

There are typically 3 to 4 pediatric visits between the ages of 6 to 20 weeks (corresponding with vaccination dates), depending on the age of the pet when it is first seen. Each visit and handout should cover different selected topics. A list of suggested topics can be found in Box 7-1. Since there is a large volume of information to be given to the new puppy or kitten owner and the average client remembers about 25% of what they hear, alternative learning aids are helpful. Systematically transferring information into smaller, easier-to-digest sections in a written format for the client to take home is a significant tool in client education.",

Regular staff meetings can be used to educate staff on the standards and to review and reinforce the protocols and standards of care. A list should be generated of the top 25 to 50 most frequently asked questions that are fielded by the receptionists and technicians, and the written answers to these questions can serve as a source or script for those staff members. Written protocols and standards of care guidelines aid in standardizing and enhancing the training of new staff members. A test bank of different topics from the pediatric wellness visits (or any other aspect of a practice) can be created, and staff members can be periodically tested on the information. For example, how often are vaccinations given, what are the available canine vs. feline vaccinations, or what are the common internal and external parasites of puppies and kittens?

Some may contend that this amount of time is too much for a busy practice; however, if it ensures that the puppy is well socialized and trained, then the time will be recouped in future visits (instead of having to muzzle or deal with an unruly patient). Generally, there is too much information for the average client to digest on the first visit, especially if this is their first pet. It is recommended that information be divided into smaller sections to be discussed at each of the scheduled pediatric visits, so the client does not become overwhelmed. The pediatric visits are an opportunity to educate the clients, to make sure they understand the plan of care and recommendations, and to make sure their new puppy or kitten is going to be a good fit for their family and lifestyle. Based on the information obtained from the risk assessment, physical examination, and the geographic location, the clinician can determine the appropriate vaccinations and anthelmintics and at what interval they will be administered and assess the need for any other internal or external parasite control (e.g., heartworms, fleas, or ticks).",

Clients should understand that vaccinations are medical procedures that should be individualized based on history, physical examination, risk, and lifestyle of the individual animal.

CAPC guidelines are as follows: \"Puppies and kittens require more frequent anthelmintic administration than adult dogs and cats, because (1) they often are serially reinfected via nursing and from the environment, and (2) they often harbor parasite larvae in migration that later mature and commence laying eggs. Intestinal parasite infections in puppies and kittens may cause serious illness or even death before a diagnosis is possible by fecal examination. Puppies and their mothers should be treated with appropriate anthelmintics when puppies are 2, 4, 6, and 8 weeks of age, then put on a monthly preventive. Because prenatal infection does not occur in kittens, biweekly treatment can begin at 3 weeks of age, and they can be put on a monthly preventive at 8 or 9 weeks of age. Nursing bitches and queens should be treated concurrently with their offspring since they often develop patent infections along with their young.\" Because geographic, seasonal, and lifestyle factors substantially affect parasite prevalence, veterinarians should have been associated with an adverse event, resulting in the risk outweighing the benefit. A list of these vaccines can be seen in Table 7 -1. The initial core vaccination series is begun at the first visit, with boosters given at 3 to 4 week intervals. For example, the core puppy vaccinations (distemper-adenovirus type 2, parvovirus [DA 2 P]) may be given at 8, 12, and 16 weeks, and core kitten vaccinations (feline viral rhinotracheitis, calicivirus, panleukopenia [FVRCP]) given at 9 and 13 weeks. State requirements may vary, so rabies vaccines may be given at the final pediatric visit or at the time of the ovariohysterectomy or castration.",
