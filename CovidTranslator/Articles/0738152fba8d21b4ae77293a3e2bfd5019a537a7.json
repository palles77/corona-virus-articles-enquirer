During routine CT scan performed in February 2020 a centimetric nodule in left superior lobe suspected for malignancy was reported. Functional imaging with 18 F-FDG PET/CT was requested by tumor board to evaluate nodule metabolism. 18 F-FDG PET/CT was scheduled for March 18 th 2020, twenty-seven days after SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in Italy. During triage procedures required for COVID-19 prevention, body temperature resulted < 37.5 \u00b0C and the patient did not present nor cough or wheezing, neither shortness of breath. Patient declared no suspected expositions to infected people and he was a non-smoker with no cardiovascular comorbidities. The nuclear medicine team interpreted the PET scan as active inflammatory processes with consensus, with a CT pattern highly suspicious for on-going COVID-19 pneumonia, as reported in literature (1, 2) . After consultation with COVID-19 task-force authorities, the patient has been tested with real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), resulted positive, and he was subsequently quarantined. However, hospitalization in intensive care unit was necessary three days after PET/CT scan for rapid disease progression and severe respiratory distress syndrome.",

PET scans are still offered to oncological patients to guarantee the continuation of best clinical practice, even in the scenario of national 3 restrictive directives. Thus, the number of asymptomatic pathogen carrier in Nuclear Medicine facilities is not negligible. COVID-19 radiological pattern (Rx and CT) has become known, usually described as peripheral predominant GGOs or lung consolidation involving mainly the lower lobes (3) . However, discrepancy between radiological patterns and clinical symptoms is possible and several studies have reported this clinical-radiological dissociation (4, 5) . The few reports of 18 F-FDG PET/CT in patients with COVID-19 currently available, describe in all cases symptomatic patients with common COVID-19 manifestation including fever, cough, shortness of breath, myalgia and fatigue (1, 2) . To the best of our knowledge this is the first case report in asymptomatic patient, investigated with 18 F-FDG PET/CT. This case highlights the rapid disease progression in asymptomatic patient presenting FDG avid COVID-19 pneumonia. While far from giving definitive evidence, asymptomatic patients presenting typical radiological CT patterns and positive FDG uptake should be promptly tested and strictly monitored, since sudden worsening of patient clinical condition, might be possible.",

FDG uptake corresponded to peripheral predominant ground-glass opacities (GGOs) observed in low-dose CT without contrast media administration (Figure 1). Increased uptake of 18 F-FDG in mediastinal lymph nodes was also observed (SUVmax=5.6 in right lower paratracheal node) (Figure 2). No pleural effusion was noted. The solitary nodule of the left superior lobe did not show significant 18 F-FDG uptake.",
