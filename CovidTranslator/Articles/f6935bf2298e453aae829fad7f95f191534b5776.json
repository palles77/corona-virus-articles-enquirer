Residents in Guangzhou, the provincial capital of Guangdong, were reportedly rushing to buy masks, antibiotics and traditional remedies including white vinegar, the boiling of which was believed to ward off respiratory infections (Rosling & Rosling 2003) . At this time, the health authorities of the Hong Kong SAR and Guangdong did not have efficient channels for exchanging information on matters of health on a 'real-time' basis (SARS Expert Committee 2003) . By 11 February, the People's Republic of China had informed the WHO of an outbreak of an acute respiratory syndrome with 305 cases and five deaths in Guangdong Province (WHO 2003a) . The disease had been circulating in Guangdong since November 2002. It was a severe viral pneumonia that failed to respond to antibiotics including \u2424-lactams and macrolides. The most notable characteristic was the propensity to cause clusters of disease in family contacts and healthcare workers, and in recognition of this the disease had been named 'infectious atypical pneumonia' (Zhong & Zeng 2003) . Some of the patients with this disease in Guangdong during November and December 2002 had a history of occupational or other exposure to markets or restaurants involved in the live game animal trade (Breiman et al. 2003; Zhong et al. 2003) . Several aetiological agents were under consideration including Chlamydia.",

The Hospital Authority of Hong Kong manages all public hospitals accounting for more than 90% of all hospital admission within Hong Kong SAR. However, community-acquired pneumonia is a common disease in all parts of the world and Hong Kong SAR (population 6.8 million) had ca. 1400 episodes of disease every month, with 55-75 of them requiring management in intensive care units (SARS Expert Committee 2003) . It was clear from the outset that an indicator with such a high baseline would not provide early warning of a new disease. Therefore, surveillance focused on severe community-acquired pneumonia and included intensive microbiological investigation of all such cases. Those patients with recent travel to Guangdong received particular attention, though microbiological investigation was not restricted to this group.",

One of the cell lines included in our panel of cells was FRhK-4: a cell used to grow hepatitis A virus. Over the past year, we had found FRhK-4 cells able to support the replication of several respiratory viruses including human metapneumovirus, a virus with fastidious growth requirements . A lung biopsy from one patient and a nasopharyngeal aspirate from another showed evidence of a subtle cytopathic effect on FRhK-4 cells which became more pronounced on passage (figure 1a). Using infected cells as antigen in an indirect immunofluorescence assay (figure 1b), we were able to demonstrate seroconversion or rising antibody titres in sera of several patients with suspected SARS. Paired sera from patients with atypical pneumonia as a result of other causes were seronegative. Thus, there was a close link between the novel virus and SARS. Thin section electron microscopy on infected cells clearly showed evidence of abundant virus particles in the Golgi-endoplasmic reticulum complex and on the surface of infected cells. Electron microscopy of infected cell supernatants using negative staining showed evidence of virus particles of 60-80 nm with a morphology compatible with coronaviruses. Electron microscopic examination of the lung biopsy that yielded the virus isolate revealed viral particles similar in morphology to that seen in virus-infected cells in vitro.",

However, the extent of genetic homology to known coronaviruses was not high and we suspected that we were dealing with a novel coronavirus . We established evidence of SARS-CoV infection by serology or RT-PCR in 45 out of 50 patients with SARS whereas there was little evidence of virus activity in community controls ). These findings provided evidence of the association between this novel coronavirus and SARS. Using Vero-E6 cells, similar findings were being reported to the WHO laboratory network from the Centers for Disease Control, Atlanta and the Bernhard Nocht Institute for Tropical Medicine, Hamburg, who were investigating patients originating from Vietnam and Singapore, respectively (Drosten et al. 2003; Ksiazek et al. 2003) . Independent reports of a novel coronavirus from three laboratories investigating patients from three countries provided a compelling case for the link between the novel virus (now named SARS-CoV) and SARS. Confirmation of Koch's postulates was achieved by reproducing the disease in cynomolgous macaques after experimental inoculation with SARS-CoV (Fouchier et al. 2003; Kuiken et al. 2003 ; reviewed by Osterhaus et al. 2004 ).

Initial indirect immunofluorescent tests with blood donor sera on SARS-CoV infected cells gave negative results suggesting that SARS-CoV was not previously endemic in the human population (Ksiazek et al. 2003; Peiris et al. 2003a) . It also indicated that the immunofluorescent test could be a useful serological test for diagnosis of SARS. On 28 March, just a week after the aetiological agent was identified, we began laboratory testing for SARS based on these two tests with the caveat that these were experimental tests still under evaluation. Under normal circumstances, one would not provide a diagnostic service without careful prior evaluation and validation. However, these times were far from 'normal': the need for the diagnostic service was here and now, not sometime in the future, when the test may be better validated but the need may have passed. However, providing such a diagnostic service was fraught with problems. We were swamped with diagnostic test requests from across Hong Kong, with over 200 specimens arriving per day at our laboratory alone. There were initially two and then three laboratories providing serology and RT-PCR diagnosis. Clinical data on many of these patients were difficult to obtain and therefore evaluation of the performance characteristics of the tests on a real-time basis proved difficult. In general, data-capture and data-flow proved to Phil. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B (2004) be a major obstacle in reacting to the SARS crisis. The sudden and large workload hampered further optimization and test development in the short term. In subsequent months, the Hospital Authority of Hong Kong consolidated all the clinical and laboratory data into one database (designated e-SARS) thereby facilitating much better data analysis. Such a system would be invaluable in dealing with emerging infectious disease outbreaks in future.",

Hospitals served as amplifiers of the disease and SARS exposed the logistical problems of coping with an epidemic of infectious disease in the twenty-first century and highlighted the weak links in infection control within hospitals, especially in tertiary hospitals providing modern invasive care. Determined and concerted global public health measures by case detection using a clinical case definition and patient isolation, succeeded in interrupting the chain of disease transmission and by 5 July 2003, the outbreak was formally declared as over. The understanding of the aetiology and the availability of diagnostic tests no doubt contributed to this success. But it is not clear whether the public health interventions may have achieved the desired result irrespective of such knowledge of aetiology. However, a better understanding of the causative virus did prove invaluable in several respects that were pertinent for control of SARS. Virus was isolated from the faeces and urine as well as the respiratory tract, suggesting that the infection was not confined to the respiratory tract. Furthermore, because SARS-CoV was unusually stable in the environment, including in faeces (WHO 2003d ), the possibility of faecal transmission had to be considered. These findings provided the basis for understanding the community outbreak at Amoy Gardens, where over 300 patients were infected within a few days and where contaminated sewage may have played a role in transmission of infection (Yu et al. 2004) . Quantitative RT-PCR assays on longitudinally collected specimens from the same patient showed that SARS-CoV viral load in the upper respiratory tract was low in the first 5 days of illness and increased progressively to peak at around day 10 after disease onset (Peiris et al. 2003c) . This was in contrast with most other respiratory viral infections where maximal viral load in the respiratory tract occurs soon after the onset of clinical disease. These findings explained the epidemiological observations that transmission was more common after the first 5 days of illness (Lipsitch et al. 2003) . The unusual stability of SARS-CoV may also explain the propensity of this virus to spread so readily in a hospital setting. The low viral load in respiratory secretions early in the disease suggested that diagnostic tests applied to upper respiratory tract specimens would have to be pushed to the limits of sensitivity to diagnose disease in the first few days when viral loads are very low. Later modifications of RT-PCR test strategies based on real-time RT-PCR together with enhanced RNA extraction methods allowed higher success rates in diagnosis of patients in the first few days of illness (Poon et al. 2003b) .",

The anecdotal reports of the early patients with SARS having contact with the live wild animal restaurant trade suggested that live wild game markets that were prevalent in Guangdong and other parts of mainland China may be the initial source of the virus infecting humans. Investigation of these wild game markets revealed the presence of a closely related virus in several small mammalian species, most notably the palm civet cat (Paguma larvata). Persons working directly in this trade had high prevalence of antibody to the SARS-CoV and related animal viruses (Guan et al. 2003) . The recent re-emergence of SARS in humans was also linked to the animal trade (see the accompanying article by Zhong 2004).",

Similar strategies were instrumental in the discovery of other recent novel pathogens including Nipah virus and human metapneumovirus. In this age of high-throughput genomics, it is important that expertise in methods of 'classical virology' are not neglected and lost. Given budgetary constraints imposed by 'managed care' and repeated 'efficiency gains' in the health systems of many countries, there is the perceived need for diagnostic virology laboratories to be primarily accountable for patient care (i.e. providing rapid diagnosis) rather than for public health. Therefore, conventional technologies such as viral culture are being abandoned in favour of methods that provide rapid diagnosis such as antigen detection and molecular (e.g. RT-PCR based) diagnosis. These last methods detect the presence of only a pre-selected agent: they are not 'open ended' methods able to detect the unexpected! It is, however, equally clear that once the candidate agent had been identified, the approaches of modern molecular biology made short shrift of the complete genetic characterization of the virus.",

            "text": "SARS manifested several features that made it more amenable to control through public health measures than some other potential emerging infectious disease threats. Most important of these was the fact that there was little or no transmission of SARS-CoV in the late incubation period or even in the first few days of illness. Furthermore, asymptomatic infection seemed to be less common and less epidemiologically relevant than with many other respiratory viral infections. It is salutary to keep in mind that the next global emerging infectious disease threat may not be so amenable to interruption by case detection and isolation, once human-to-human transmission is established. The current threat from avian influenza subtype H5N1 is a case in point (WHO 2004) . The parallels with SARS are poignant. As with SARS in late 2002, there are now repeated inter-species transmission events of H5N1 virus from the avian reservoir to humans and other mammalian species. In this instance, the intensity and geographical scale over which these events are occurring are vastly greater than was the case with SARS. 'Wet markets' where live animals are sold for human consumption play a role in both diseases (Guan et al. 2003; Webster 2004) . At the time of writing, transmission of influenza H5N1 to humans is inefficient, and has so far not resulted in efficient human-to-human transmission. However, if left unchecked, as occurred with SARS in late 2002, it is possible that the virus may acquire the property of efficient human-to-human transmission, either through reassortment or mutation of the viral genome. Once adapted to human-to-human transmission, influenza is highly transmissible, both in the late incubation period as well as early in the disease. Therefore, its spread may not be amenable to interruption with the same public health measures used to successfully contain SARS. The recent reports that the influenza pandemic of 1918 may have been caused by an avian virus directly adapting to human transmission (rather than reassorting with a pre-existing human virus) provides an ominous portent (Stevens et al. 2004) .",
