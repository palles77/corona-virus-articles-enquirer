Prevention of future outbreaks is essential and requires understanding pathogenesis and evolution of the virus. We have isolated a SARS-CoV in China and analyzed 47 SARS-CoV genomes with the aims to reveal the evolution trends of the virus and provide insights into understanding pathogenesis and SARS epidemic. Specimen from a SARS patient was inoculated into cell culture. The presence of SARS-CoV was determined by RT-PCR and confirmed by electron microscopy. Virus was isolated followed by the determination of its genome sequences, which were then analyzed by comparing with other 46 SARS-CoV genomes. Genetic mutations with potential implications to pathogenesis and the epidemic were characterized. This viral genome consists of 29,728 nucleotides with overall organization in agreement with that of published isolates. A total of 348 positions were mutated on 47 viral genomes. Among them 22 had mutations in more than three genomes. Hot spots of nucleotide variations and unique trends of mutations were identified on the viral genomes. Mutation rates were different from gene to gene and were correlated well with periodical or geographic characteristics of the epidemic.",

In March 2003, the World Health Organization (WHO) made an unprecedented international effort by organizing world-leading laboratories to find the causative agent. This effort resulted in the declaration made simultaneously by three research groups that a new SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) was the pathogen of this disease [3] [4] [5] . When the outbreak of SARS came to an end in July 2003, it had caused a cumulative total of 8437 cases and 813 deaths worldwide [6] .",

It is possible that distinct patterns of several genes and unique variations in the SARS-CoV genome may contribute to its severe virulence or pathogenesis. The mechanism of SARS-CoV pathogenesis may involve both direct viral cytocidal effects on the target cells and immunemediated mechanisms.

This region not only carried 11 mutations, but also had the second highest variable positions (residual 3852 and 11,493). ORF1b gene contains additional two residuals (17,564 and 19 ,084) at which 7 viruses were mutated. We also noticed that the S gene had a high mutability with residual 22222 mutated in 7 viruses, residual 21721 in 6, and residual 24933 in 3. Two positions with high mutation rate were identified within the M gene. One was located at the most variable residual 26477, at which 20 viruses were mutated. The other one was residual 26600, at which 6 viral genomes were changed. E gene and N gene had one mutation spot at residual 26203 and 28276, respectively. Among five nonstructural genes, X4 had one mutation site at residual 27243 with mutation rate of 5, while X5 gene had two mutation spots at residual 27813 and 27827 with mutation rate of 7 ( Fig. 4 and Table 3 ).",

However, the situation of this year seems quite different from last year, since transmission, infection and severity of SARS-CoV were clearly weakened. One possible explanation is that it might be just a preface of SARS epidemics. Like last year, in the early period of SARS pandemics, the virus did not show strong toxicity. Another possibility is that SARS-CoV might be truly weakened due to many reasons including genetic mutations, like the influenza FluA virus which has caused a disaster outbreak in 1918 and was weakened after the pandemic that took 20 million lives [21] . Influenza epidemics throughout the world occurred periodically between the first pandemic and present time due to the viral antigenic drift and shift. These processes also resulted in the appearance of influenza B and C virus with significant differences in genetic characterizations [22] . It would be important to find out if SARS-CoV has similar epidemic rules as influenza virus dose, whether SARS-CoV is weakening or will SARS breakout periodically.

Hubei was a less SARS representative area in China, because there were only a total of three patients confirmed as probable SARS cases and only one viral strain was isolated from this region. These facts prompted us to study this virus further. Our sequence analysis indicated that although the overall genome organization of WHU (Fig. 2 ) is in agreement with published studies on other isolates, WHU carried a two-nucleotide deletion at residuals 27825 and 27826 was genetically diverse from most SARS-CoV isolates. These results implicated that mutations occurred during the viral transmission from Beijing to Hubei, although we do not know at this point whether these mutations have any biological significance. It is interesting to notice that although the SARS-CoV virus evaded human population only for 6 months, its genetic information already altered in many ways during its short journey of human transmission.",

For instance, mutability of the S gene was high during early-mid period, but low during mid-late period of the epidemic, which suggested that mutability of S gene decreased as viral transmission increased. One possible explanation for this observation is that during early-mid period of the epidemic, as the gene encoding protein for the recognition of receptors of the host and for the mediation of viral entry into host cells, S gene had to change at a high frequency in order to quickly fulfill its biological roles. Once the viral adaptation to human cells completed or reached its equilibrium, genetic changes were less important or no longer needed. Thus, genetic information of S gene became relatively stable during mid-late period of the outbreak [23] . Another example is ORF lab that encodes the polyprotein of SARS-CoV. Like S gene, ORF lab was also actively involved in genetic mutations. However, in contrast to S gene, mutability of ORF lab was low at the beginning, but high during midlate period of the epidemics. This observation can be explained well by the fact that the toxicity of SARS-CoV was weakened in mid-late period. Other structural genes including E, M, and N genes were more conserved at beginning of the outbreak, but underwent genetic changes at the end of transmission. This pattern of genetic mutation obviously reflects biological roles of these structural genes in viral particles assembly, which in turn crucial for the virus to fight with increasing immune pressures from the hosts. Genetic analysis of non-structural genes showed that they intended to keep genetic information conserved throughout the entire process of transmission. Therefore, these genes may prove to be ideal targets for the diagnosis of SARS-Co.V, screening antiviral drugs, and perhaps developing antiviral vaccines.",

Mutations at residuals 3825 and 26203 within the X5 and E genes could clearly set the Taiwan isolates apart from others. Thus, these two positions may be used as molecular signatures in the identification of Taiwan isolates. Similar phenomena were also found in three viral strains (SoD, FRA, and Frankfurt) isolated from Europe during mid-late period of the outbreak. These viral strains had mutations at the same residuals (2557, 11,448 and 24,933), while all isolates from other regions did not show any changes at these positions. This kind of specific mutation pattern may reflect relatively independent geographical locations of Taiwan and Europe. We speculated that population in these regions perhaps developed unique immunity due to their unique locations, for which the virus had to make specific genetic mutations in order to invade these populations. In addition, based on genome-wide mutation analysis, some viral strains isolated from Beijing had a close relationship to isolates identified from Southern China during early-mid period of the outbreak. It could be translated to that at least these SARS-CoV isolates found in Beijing were originally from Southern China.",
