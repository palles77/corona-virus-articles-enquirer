To date, no data on the immunogenicity of the replication-defective vaccinia virus (derived from the Tiantan strain) (rNTV)-based HCV vaccine in primates have been reported. This study describes in detail the immunogenicity of various vaccine candidates in rhesus macaques, including rNTV-based and replicationdefective recombinant adenoviral (rAd)-based HCV vaccines, as well as HCV pseudotyped virus-like particles (HCVpp). Our data showed that rAd-HCV vaccine boosting induced robust CMI, while priming or boosting with HCVpp enhanced the antigen-specific nAb response after rAd-HCV vaccination; however, CMI was not enhanced. Vaccination includes rNTV-HCV priming induced robust antigen-specific antibody, particularly nAbs, and CMI responses. Furthermore, more robust and longer-lasting CMI and higher cytokine levels (both Th1 and Th2 types, especially IFN-\u03b3) resulted from boosting with rAd-HCV. We conclude that the rNTV-based HCV vaccine induces robust nAbs and CMI when combined with a heterogeneous primer-booster strategy, which shows promise for development of a human HCV vaccine.",

[4] [5] [6] [7] At the same time, neutralizing antibody (nAb), induced by the candidate vaccine, should recognize and bind to a variety of genotypes of HCV at multiple sites to prevent infection. 7 Also, the immune responses induced by immunogens are regulated by cytokines (e.g., IFN-\u03b3, TNF-\u03b1, IL10), which then determine the outcome of HCV infection. 8 The integrated cytokine test, although cytokine production is majorly primarily by the genetic makeup of an individual, may assist in assessment of the efficacy of a candidate vaccine. 2 The antigen-presenting pathway is mediated and modulated by viral vectors, 2, 9 which regulate the efficiency of antigen-presentation and the host immune response. After much research, several HCV vaccine candidates, including peptides, proteins, DNA, virus-like particles, and viral vector-based vaccines, have been developed. 10 The immunogenic potential of these vaccines and combinations has been described in laboratory animals and humans. 6 Previous studies revealed that most recombinant virus vectors, such as rAd and recombinant vaccinia virus (rVV), are advantageous in terms of their induction of the cellular immune response. Moreover, pseudotyped virus-like particles with HCV E1/E2 envelope proteins (HCVpp), derived from recombinant retroviral or lentiviral vectors, can induce high-titre antigen-specific antibodies and nAbs. 11 Heterologous prime-boost immunization seems to be a good strategy to enhance both humoral and cellular immune responses. The rAd-based vaccine was used as the priming vaccination, followed by boosting with HCVpp 11,12 and a combination of rAd-and DNA-or MVA-based vaccines proved efficacious in stimulating cell-mediated immunity (CMI). However, other heterologous prome-boost regimens, such as priming with HCVpp and boosting with rAd or rVV, may also have potential.",

[13] [14] [15] Furthermore, by deleted the 26 genes associate with host range and virulence between the C and K digestion fragments of Hind III, we developed a recombinant, replication-defective vaccinia (Tiantan strain) viral vector (rNTV), which can well propagated in primary chick embryo fibroblasts but lack of replicative ability in primates and rabbits, and is therefore much safer than rVVT. 15 To date, no data on the immunogenicity of the rNTV-based HCV vaccine in primates have been reported. HCV structural proteins might induce nAbs and activate T-cell responses that mediate viral clearance, and NS3 is essential for HCV clearance as it induces an early and sustained cell-mediated immune response. 10, 16, 17 Therefore, both structural proteins and the NS3 antigen are targets for HCV vaccine development. 2 Due to safety considerations, integration-deficient lentiviral vectors were used to capture HCV envelope proteins (E1, E2) and insert a relatively well conserved non-structural protein NS3 into the transfer genome as the target antigen. 13, 14, 18 Recent studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of both recombinant viral vector-based vaccines and the prime-boost strategy in several clinical trials. 2 Research has begun to focus increasingly on replicating-deficient vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA)-based vaccines. 2, 19, 20 Although not a natural host, the macaque has proven to be an important vaccination model for predicting successful human immune responses to multiple antigens because of the similarity of the macaque immune system to that of humans. Here, we compare a number of vaccination regimes in macaques using various HCV vaccine candidates; i.e., rAd-HCV, rNTV-HCV, and HCVpp. This report is to our knowledge the first to describe an optimized rNTV-based HCV vaccine regime that elicits robust CMI and cross-nAb responses in macaques when combined with rAd-HCV vaccine candidates.",

Blood samples were assessed for HCV-antigen-specific cell-mediated immunity (CMI) (ELISPOT, Luminex) at the (filled triangle) indicated time points (Luminex detection of multiple cytokines only at week 38). Antibody (IgG) and neutralizing antibody (nAb) titres were assessed every 2 weeks after immunization (inverted triangle) (nAb analysis at weeks 26 and 38). Only four monkeys were immunized with rAd-HCV and were assessed in the weeks indicated by italicized numbers. Table 1 . Each group was then evaluated in terms of immunogenicity (Figure 2 ). We first assessed the HCV-specific antibody response following administration of various vaccine regimens (Figure 3) . Robust antibodies against E1, E2, and NS3 were induced among most of the monkeys in groups A and C, which were primed with both HCVpp and rNTV-HCV (Figure 3a-f) . No significant enhancement of antibody against HCV target antigens was observed after boosting with HCVpp or rAd-HCV (Figure 3a-c) . A single injection of rNTV produced a significantly higher E1 antibody titre than did a single injection of HCVpp or rAd-HCV (P = 0.042). In the rNTV-HCV priming group, the titre decreased slowly over the next 3 months, and HCV E1 (P = 0.004) and E2 (P = 0.035) antibody were also detected after heterologous boosting with rAd-HCV (Figure 3d-f ). The titres of antibodies against E1 and E2 were low in the group primed with a single rAd-HCV, but anti-E1 antibody titre was enhanced after a second rAd-HCV injection (P = 0.03). Boosting with HCVpp increased the antibody titres against E1 and E2, which persisted up to week 34 in group C (Figure 3g-i) . However, no increased production of antibodies against E1, E2, or NS3 was detected after further boosting with rNTV-HCV in group C (Figure 3g-i) . The differences among the three groups were compared at each time point. There were no significant differences in levels of antibodies against E2 and NS3 among the three groups primed with HCVpp, rNTV-HCV, and rAd-HCV, although the anti-E1 antibody titre was higher in the group primed with rNTV-HCV (Figure 4a ). In addition, the anti-E1 and -E2 responses in group B (rNTV-HCV priming and rAd-HCV boosting) were significantly higher than those in the other two groups (P < 0.023) at week 38 (Figure 4b) .",

Monkeys were bled 2 weeks after each vaccination, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) isolated from whole blood were stimulated with overlapping peptides spanning the HCV target antigens. No CMI was detected in macaques primed with HCVpp at weeks 22 and 28. After boosting with rAd-HCV, three monkeys in the HCVpp priming group demonstrated positive immunity (median, 178; range: 27-541 SFU/million PBMCs), which was maintained up to week 50 (median, 78; range: 11-148 SFU/million PBMCs) (Figure 5a) . In contrast, all four monkeys primed with rNTV-HCV showed strong CMI responses (median, 597; range: 311-1,210 SFU/million PBMCs) at week 22. The CMI response decreased markedly by week 32 in the group with rNTV-HCV priming, but marked enhancement resulted from rAd-HCV vaccination boosting at week 36 (median, 1,545; range: 818-2,210 SFU/million PBMCs). Furthermore, the CMI was maintained at a higher level in the group with rNTV-HCV prime/rAd-HCV boost compared with the other two groups at week 50, and was detectable up to week 74 (range: 121-496 SFU/million PBMCs) (Figure 5b) . Before week 20, four monkeys were immunized with rAd twice, but only one monkey (06080022) demonstrated weak HCV-specific T-cell responses (range: 112-344 SFU/million PBMCs) (mainly to E2 peptides). The sample remained positive up to week 20. The rAd-primed group was then boosted with HCVpp at week 24, and although the response in 06080022 was not increased, other monkeys in the same group showed slight increases (median, 166; range: 110-232 SFU/million PBMCs). However, two boosts with HCVpps did not significantly reinforce the T-cell response. The rNTV boost at week 30 caused a marked increase in two out of four macaques in the rAd group (median, 324; range: 10-1,518 SFU/million PBMCs) (Figure 5c) . In addition, specific T-cell responses were also assessed using four separate peptide pools spanning the four HCV vaccine targets (Core, E1, E2, NS3). The rNTV-HCV priming group exhibited significant enhancements in all four peptides, especially after boosting with rAd-HCV at week 36 (Figure 5d ). In detail, priming with rNTV-HCV induced two monkeys in the group to be positive to E1, all positive to E2, and three positive to NS3; this was the only vaccine that was effective after a single administration. After boosting with rAd-HCV, all samples in group 2 became positive to the four peptides, with the exception of one monkey that was negative to NS3 and Core. This is a compelling advantage compared with the other two regimens. Boosting with rAd-HCV was also effective in the HCVpp-primed group. However, priming with rAd did not markedly enhance the CMI in group 1 (Figure 5d) . The boost effect of rNTV-HCV was similarly disappointing in group 3 after boosting with HCVpp. Moreover, use of HCVpp as either the primer or booster antigen induced no detectable CMI.",

            "text": "The rhesus macaque vaccination model is a useful tool in the evaluation of immune responses induced by HCV immunogens. 15 We report herein for the first time the evaluation of immunogenicity in primates using a novel replication-defective rNTV-based HCV vaccine. We also performed the first in-depth analysis of the 3, [23] [24] [25] Recently, several viral vaccine candidates have shown great promise in preclinical and clinical trials, transiently reducing viral loads in some chronically infected subjects. Among these, viral vector (especially rAd or rMVA-based) vaccine candidates and heterogeneous prime-boost vaccination may represent the most promising strategy for development of an HCV vaccine. 2, 10, 17, 23 The distinguished safety record of rTTV, coupled with its ability to induce robust and persistent CMI in humans, make this live-attenuated vaccine an attractive vector candidate for HCV vaccines. 17 Given the concerns surrounding the pre-existing immunity and potential risks of rAd5-and rTTV-based vaccines in humans, it remains encouraging that comparable immunogenicity can be achieved in primates using replication-defective rNTV-based vaccine candidates and a heterologous prime-boost regimen. 26 rNTV is a novel viral vector vaccine based on the Tiantan strain of vaccinia virus, which is a highly attenuated strain used widely as a safe viral vector to deliver antigens. 15 The vector can be effectively amplified in chicken embryo cells to reach a high titre, but has not been effectively reproduced in cell lines from humans, rabbits, and monkeys, which make the rNTV vector easy to produce and safer for human use. The rNTV exhibits DNA replication, RNA transcription and protein expression similar to the original Tiantan strain, so its expression efficiency and immunogenicity is approximated to the original virus. Our data agree with previous reports in which rNTV was a highly reliable primer of antibody and CD8 + T-cell responses. In this study, we showed that the rNTV vector has excellent immunogenicity in terms of induction of effective HCV-specific cellular and humoral immune responses in rhesus monkeys, and the neutralizing capacity of the activated antibody was not weaker than the HCVpp. However, our data also show that the immunity induced in rhesus macaques by rNTV-HCV vaccination was not of long duration. Encouragingly, the immune response can be rapidly stimulated and enhanced by rAd-HCV boosting. The enhanced response was maintained for longer, and the spectrum of antibodies may be improved, suggesting that priming with rNTV and boosting with rAd may be an ideal strategy for inducing long-lasting protective immunity against HCV. In addition, analysis of the cytokine profile revealed that cytokine production by the HCV-specific Th1 (especially IFN-\u03b3) and Th2 subsets in PBMCs of macaques with an rNTV-HCV prime/rAd-HCV booster were significantly increased compared with other regimens. Figure 6 Multiple cytokine detection in the culture supernatants of PBMCs stimulated with peptides at week 38. PBMCs (5 \u00d7 10 5 ) from vaccinated rhesus macaques were cocultured with 4 \u03bcg/ml peptides, with culture medium as the negative control. After 2 days in culture, cytokines in supernatants were assayed by Luminex. (a,b) Th1 (TNF-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b3, IL2, and IL12) and Th2 (IL4, IL5, IL10, and IL6) cytokines were quantitated. (c) The cytokine levels of activated samples were divided by those of the negative control to calculate the enhancement rate. The enhancement rates among the three groups were compared by two-way analysis of variance. Cytokines whose expression was significantly different between the groups are indicated by asterisks (*P < 0.05, **P < 0.01).

However, rAd-HCV priming failed to induce a robust nAb response to HCV in macaques. Furthermore, rAd-HCV boosting also failed to significantly broaden or enhance the nAb response to HCV in macaques primed with HCVpp.",

To develop a double-effect vaccine that induces both cellular and humoral immunity to HCV, we developed a novel HCVpp with envelope proteins from E1E2 of HCV within which was packed the NS3 gene in an ssRNA form, based on an integration-deficient lentiviral vectors platform. [28] [29] [30] Our previous work in mice initially confirmed that the novel HCVpp exhibited a specific cellular-immunity-enhancing ability and induced production of cross-nAb. Therefore, this new HCVpp vaccine may also exhibit a double-activation ability in rhesus macaques. Using the same rAd prime and HCVpp boost immunization strategy as in a previous study, 11 HCVpp vaccination also elicited strong humoral immune responses to HCV antigens in macaques. More broad-spectrum neutralizing activity was also induced after priming with HCVpp and boosting with rAd-HCV, although there was no obvious enhancement of the antibody response to HCV E1/E2. rAd-HCV boosting may play a more important role in the induction of a cross-neutralizing response by a vaccine. 2 However, priming with HCVpp failed to induce robust CMI to HCV in macaques.",
