Therefore, a more sophisticated look into the cellular metabolism might lead to a more efficient use of the production medium resulting in high quantities of the protein with the desired product quality. For intracellular metabolite quantification the sample preparation including quenching of cells is a very critical step strongly affecting subsequent results. A simple and straightforward protocol, not needing special equipment, was investigated focusing on the efficiency of stopping metabolic activities and the potential metabolic leakage due to losses in membrane integrity. In a next attempt, the comparison between the producer cell line and the corresponding mock cell line using targeted mass spectrometry approaches for intra-and extracellular metabolite quantification was performed. The influence of the increased protein production capacity and the need of a complex glycosylation machinery on metabolite profiles was assessed. In order to find a link between the determined output parameters, detailed data evaluation including multivariate data analysis tools was implemented.",

This fully automated assay was based on PITC (phenylisothiocyanate)derivatization in the presence of internal standards followed by LC-MS/MS detection using a AB SCIEX 4000 QTrap\u2122 mass spectrometer with electrospray ionization [1] . For the quantitative analysis of energy metabolism intermediates (glycolysis, citrate cycle, urea cycle), a hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC)-ESI-MS/MS method in highly selective negative MRM detection mode was used. Intracellular amounts of nucleotides and nucleotide sugars were analyzed by liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry on surface-conditioned porous graphitic carbon as described by Pabst et al.

The increased glycosylation processing in producer cells seemed to lead to higher intracellular concentrations of required precursors due to increased stimulation of the overall glycosylation machinery. Otherwise, an increased consumption by producer cells should have led to lower concentrations or even to limiting bottlenecks. The increased amounts of intracellular nucleotide sugars at late stage for both cell lines were evident, but an adequate explanation with respect to cell-and process knowledge is still missing.",
