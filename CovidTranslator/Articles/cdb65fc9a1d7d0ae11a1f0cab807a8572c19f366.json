Advances in perinatal and neonatal care have contributed to a growing population of premature infants at risk for NEC. It is now the most common newborn surgical emergency, with a mortality rate that far exceeds that of any other gastrointestinal (GI) condition requiring surgical intervention. Despite extensive research, the precise cause and pathogenesis remain elusive.",

NEC accounts for 1% to 7% of all NICU admissions in the United States, or 1 to 3 cases per 1000 live births. 100, 102, 131, 152 In infants born with very low birth weight (VLBW, <1500 g), the disease occurs in approximately 10% to 12%, but ranges between 2% and 22%, depending on the center of inquiry. 44, 51, 131, 174, 291 Worldwide, the incidence of NEC in VLBW infants varies from 1% to 2% in Japan, 7% in Austria, 10% in Greece, 14% in Argentina, and 28% in Hong Kong. 44, 76, 101, 131, 271 Several confounding factors may account for this variability, including the number and survival of low-birthweight infants, the source of patient referrals (in-or outborn), and the diagnostic criteria used. A relatively large multicenter survey of VLBW infants noted an incidence of 10.1% for definite NEC and 17.2% for suspected NEC, although there was considerable intercenter variability. 291 In another study, the incidence of definite NEC versus suspected NEC was 8.6% and 18.6%, respectively. 152 In a report by Pokorny et al. 234 of more than 18,000 in-born neonates, including 1735 low-birth-weight infants, the incidence of NEC was 3 per 1000 live births. This and many other series may be underestimating the frequency of NEC because the incidence is often defined as the total number of cases of NEC divided by the total number of patients admitted to the NICU. Thus, these figures may include many premature infants who die within the first 3 days of life of cardiorespiratory disease and do not live long enough for NEC to develop. One study that excluded early neonatal deaths and included only infants who had been fed reported an incidence of 15%. 146 Most recent reports demonstrate a strong association between NEC and prematurity, with preterm babies of low gestational age and birth weight being at particular risk. It is estimated that only 7% to 13% of all NEC cases occur in full-term infants. 27, 221, 311 The advent of early surfactant therapy and improved methods of mechanical ventilation has resulted in significant improvement in the survival of low-and extremely low-birth-weight infants. 51, 113 As a result, an increasing population of tiny infants is now at risk for the development of NEC. In the future, NEC may surpass respiratory distress syndrome as the principal cause of death in premature infants. 141 ",

Ostlie et al. 221 demonstrated a similar inverse relationship between gestational age and the onset of NEC. Full-term (\u226538 weeks) infants had a significantly earlier onset of NEC (4.9 days) than did preterm (<38 weeks) infants (13 days) . Similarly, Martinez-Tallo et al. 187 also demonstrated an earlier onset of NEC (3.3 days) in infants with a birth weight greater than 2000 g.",

            "text": "Wilson et al. 310 calculated the birth weight-specific, weekly attack rate in patients with NEC. The risk period for NEC decreased as birth weight increased. They found a consistent pattern of sharply declining risk with attainment of age equivalent to 35 to 36 weeks' gestation. It was suggested that functional maturation of the GI tract may play a principal role in determining the risk for NEC. The preterm GI tract has decreased gastric acid production and lower levels of protective mucus, 19, 213 increased mucosal permeability, 292 and an absence of normal coordinated peristaltic activity until around 34 to 35 weeks' gestation. 19, 213 Feedings NEC develops in approximately 90% of infants after being fed, whereas it develops in only 10% or less before feedings are initiated. 144, 147, 157, 185, 281 In 1978, Brown and Sweet 33 proposed that aggressive feeding protocols contributed to the pathogenesis of NEC. They found that before they changed to a slowly progressive feeding regimen in July 1974, 14 cases of NEC occurred in 1745 lowbirth-weight infants. From July 1974 to June 1978, when a cautious approach to feeding was practiced, only 1 case developed in 932 low-birth-weight infants and 2557 total patients admitted to the NICU. In a longitudinal cohort study reviewing the incidence of NEC for a 3-year period before and after implementing a \"standardized feeding schedule\" for infants weighing between 1250 and 2500 g and less than 35 weeks' gestation, Kamitsuka et al. 132 reported an 84% reduction in the risk for NEC. Other studies have also suggested an association between an increase in the incidence of NEC and advancement of formula feedings at rates greater than 20 kcal/kg/day. 9, 165, 291, 313 Despite these reports, however, randomized trials have failed to demonstrate any difference in the incidence of NEC related to fast versus slow, early versus delayed, or continuous versus intermittent bolus feedings. 136, 137, 238, 243 In a randomized trial involving 185 VLBW infants in which slow (15-mL/kg/day increments; 10-day schedule to full feeding) and fast (35-mL/kg/day increments; 5-day schedule to full feeding) feeding advancements were compared, Rayyis et al. 243 demonstrated no significant difference in the incidence of NEC (13% versus 9%), perforation (4% versus 2%), and mortality (2% versus 3%) in both groups. In a review of randomized trials comparing continuous versus intermittent bolus tube feeding for premature infants weighing less than 1500 g, Premji and Chessell 238 could find no significant differences in the incidence of NEC between the two groups.",

            "text": "Xanthine derivatives (e.g., theophylline, aminophylline), which are known to slow intestinal motility and produce oxygen free radicals during their metabolism to uric acid, have been reported to be associated with NEC. In 1980, Williams 307 and Robinson et al. 248 described three patients in whom NEC developed after receiving oral and intravenous xanthines for apnea of prematurity. In animal experiments, Cronin et al. 59 demonstrated alterations in GI blood flow and oxygen delivery after aminophylline administration in newborn lambs that may result in depletion of the GI oxygen reserve and mucosal injury. Despite these earlier reports, subsequent results in large patient studies have failed to confirm this association. 63, 112 Administration of large doses of vitamin E to premature infants has been linked to an increase in NEC. 124 Vitamin E is given to reduce the incidence of adverse sequelae of retinopathy in premature infants and has been shown to interfere with intracellular killing of bacteria by leukocytes. The increased incidence of NEC, however, has been noted only after oral administration of hyperosmolar preparations and not after intramuscular administration. 82 Indomethacin blocks prostaglandin synthetase and causes vasoconstriction. This effect has been exploited to close the patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) in premature infants with congestive heart failure. GI perforation and NEC have been noted in low-birth-weight infants treated with high-dose indomethacin. 7, 98, 162 It has been postulated that indomethacin increases mesenteric vascular resistance and reduces mesenteric blood flow by 16% to 20%. 99 Norton et al. 215 demonstrated that the use of indomethacin as a tocolytic agent was associated with an increased incidence of NEC in babies delivered before 30 weeks' gestational age (mean age at delivery, 27.6 weeks); however, indomethacin did not increase the incidence of NEC in babies born after 32 weeks' gestation. In a retrospective study involving 252 premature infants with symptomatic PDA treated with intravenous indomethacin, Grosfeld et al. 97 found a 35% incidence of NEC. In contrast, two randomized controlled trials involving more than 500 low-birth-weight premature infants receiving early low-dose indomethacin versus placebo for closure of PDA demonstrated no difference in the subsequent incidence of NEC. 89, 183 Indomethacin by itself may not be enough to cause NEC; however, in the setting of hypoxia, heart failure, or sepsis, its adverse GI effects contribute to the development of NEC in VLBW infants. 156 ",

Studies in pregnant rats exposed to cocaine demonstrated severe inflammatory changes in the uterus, placenta, and GI tract of the embryos. 37 Newborn piglets receiving high doses of cocaine had a prolonged increase in mesenteric vascular resistance and a decrease in mesenteric blood flow by Doppler evaluation. 110 In a study using radiolabeling techniques in which pregnant and nonpregnant rats were compared, exposure to cocaine resulted in a significant dose-dependent decrease in perfusion of the uterus, placenta, and fetus in the pregnant group but no change in perfusion of the uterus in the nonpregnant animals. 138 In retrospective studies involving infants with confirmed NEC, several differences have been reported between infants with and without prenatal exposure to cocaine. Czyrko et al. 61 noted a significantly greater need for surgical intervention (72.7% versus 38%), higher incidence of massive intestinal gangrene (54% versus 12%), and higher mortality (54.5% versus 18%) in infants with prenatal cocaine exposure than in those without exposure. Case-controlled analysis matching for race, sex, and birth weight demonstrated a 2.5-fold increased risk for the development of NEC in the cocaine-exposed group versus the nonexposed group. Lopez et al. 178 reported a 12% incidence of NEC in infants exposed to cocaine as compared with 3% in nonexposed babies. In addition, NEC developed in a significantly greater number of infants within the first 7 days of life in the cocaine-exposed group. In a retrospective cohort study of infants with a birth weight between 750 and 1500 g, Hand et al. 106 compared 48 infants prenatally exposed to only cocaine with 101 infants who had no drug exposure. There was no significant difference in the incidence of NEC between the two groups.",

It is recognized that cytokines and growth factors have important effects on a number of cells from various tissues, including those in the GI tract (Table 92-1) . Intestinal cells are exposed to cytokines secreted by intestinal endothelial cells, by mucosal fibroblasts, and by enterocytes themselves. 172, 214, 224, 226, 316 Epidermal growth factor (EGF) is known to be an important trophic factor for the developing GI tract. EGF receptors have been demonstrated throughout the fetal and neonatal intestine. 50, 57, 126, 184 EGF is secreted into the gut lumen primarily by the salivary glands and Brunner glands of the duodenum and has been shown to be present in high concentration in human breast milk. 233, 244 Significantly reduced levels of salivary and serum EGF have been demonstrated in premature infants in whom NEC developed versus age-matched controls. 111, 267 Inactivation of the EGF receptor in knockout mice has been shown to result in a hemorrhagic enteritis that is histologically similar to NEC. 191 In studies using a neonatal rat model of NEC that involved exposure to asphyxia and cold stress, enterally administered supplements of EGF have been shown to significantly decrease the incidence and severity of NEC in rat pups, 72 thus suggesting that this protective effect may be mediated by down-regulation of the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-18 (IL-18) and increased production of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10. 103 Fagbemi et al. 80 investigated the association of NEC with EGF receptors in the intestinal mucosa of preterm infants undergoing resection for severe NEC and confirmed the presence of intact EGF receptors located on the basolateral membrane of enterocytes.",

            "text": "Erythropoietin (Epo) is a growth factor produced by the kidneys that regulates red blood cell production in response to anemia. Since development of the recombinant protein, rEpo has become widely used in the NICU. 127, 218 Epo has been found in human breast milk, and functional Epo receptors have been demonstrated in fetal and neonatal small intestine, thus suggesting a possible role in GI development. 128, 130, 149 In a retrospective study comparing 260 VLBW infants who received rEpo with 233 matched controls, Ledbetter and Juul 171 demonstrated a significantly lower incidence of NEC in the rEpo group (4.6%) than in the control group (10.8%). Studies in neonatal rats given rEpo enterally have demonstrated a dose-dependent increase in intestinal mucosal villus surface area and increased cellular proliferation, thus suggesting a role of rEpo as a trophic factor in the developing small intestine. 129 In a neonatal rat model of NEC involving exposure to hypoxia and reoxygenation, pretreatment with intraperitoneal injections of rEpo resulted in significantly decreased mucosal inflammation and necrosis, which was thought to be mediated by decreased production of nitric oxide (NO). 163 Cytokines are endogenous mediators of the inflammatory cascade. Proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokine production is tightly regulated by complex feedback mechanisms to maintain homeostasis. 285, 297 Overproduction of either may have significant untoward effects. Overproduction of proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1, IL-2, IL-6, IL-8, IL-12, tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 [TNF-\u03b1], interferon-\u03b3, platelet-activating factor [PAF]) may lead to shock, multiorgan failure, and death. 188, 232 Overproduction of anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-4, IL-10, IL-11) may result in excessive suppression of immune function. 28, 83 A number of different inflammatory mediators have been implicated in the pathogenesis of NEC. 47, 107 In vitro studies comparing the response of mature human intestinal cell lines and fetal intestinal cell lines to inflammatory stimulation by TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, or lipopolysaccharide (LPS) demonstrated an exaggerated secretion of IL-8 by the fetal cells. 56, 210 Pretreatment of cells with Epo inhibited TNF-\u03b1-induced IL-8 secretion to control levels. In a study evaluating serial serum levels of two proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1\u03b2, IL-8) and two anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1 receptor antagonist [IL-ra], IL-10) in infants with NEC, Edelson et al. 73 demonstrated significantly higher levels of IL-8 and IL-10 in infants with severe NEC from the onset of disease through 24 hours than in infants with less severe NEC. They noted that counter-regulatory mediators in premature infants are secreted in appropriate concentrations, are released later after the onset of disease, and may be useful as a marker of more severe disease. Nadler et al. 209 investigated the pattern of cytokine expression in infants undergoing resection for severe NEC and infants undergoing intestinal resection for other inflammatory conditions. Significant up-regulation of IL-8 mRNA was seen in the specimens from infants with NEC as compared with controls. In addition, they noted significant up-regulation of IL-11 mRNA in infants with NEC and found an inverse correlation between IL-11 expression and the likelihood of pan-necrosis, thus suggesting that IL-11 secretion may be an adaptive response to limit the extent of intestinal damage. Several of the interleukins (IL-4, IL-10, IL-11) have been shown to have a protective or trophic role in the GI tract. IL-4 has been demonstrated to possess cytoprotective effects in human intestinal epithelial cells by reducing bacterial translocation, increasing leukocyte superoxide production, and inducing decay-accelerating factor, which protects the host from the attack of autologous complement activation. 10,268 IL-10 is known to be a potent anti-inflammatory cytokine that inhibits the production of proinflammatory cytokines. 168 In a neonatal rat hypoxia-reoxygenation model of NEC, recombinant IL-10 administered subcutaneously was found to significantly attenuate the extent of intestinal injury when compared with control animals, thus suggesting a protective effect of its anti-inflammatory properties. 222 has been shown to be a pleiotropic cytokine that promotes epithelial regeneration and enhances adaptation after bowel resection. 177 Subcutaneous administration of recombinant IL-11 in rats undergoing placement of a defunctionalized (Thiry-Vella) loop of intestine or massive small bowel resection has resulted in prevention of mucosal atrophy in the defunctionalized loop and enhanced mucosal adaptation and absorptive function in the remaining intestine after resection. 4, 68 A tremendous amount of investigation has been performed to define the role of NO in the pathogenesis of a number of different inflammatory processes. There is evidence to support a possible dichotomous function of NO as both a beneficial and a detrimental molecule, especially with regard to the GI tract. 159, 161 NO is produced from arginine by three isoforms of nitric oxide synthase (NOS). NOS-1 (neuronal, nNOS) and NOS-3 (endothelial, eNOS) are constitutively present at low levels in the small intestine. NOS-2 (inducible, iNOS) is a form that can be induced in response to inflammatory cytokines. 5, 211 The constitutive forms of NOS and constitutive levels of NO have been demonstrated to modulate a number of important functions in the GI tract, including maintenance of mucosal integrity, regulation of mucosal permeability and blood flow, regulation of motility, and inhibition of leukocyte adhesion and activation. 6, 18, 90, 198, 279 Inhibition of NO synthesis in a variety of animal models of intestinal injury induced by ischemia-reperfusion, LPS, or PAF has resulted in marked exacerbation of mucosal injury. 41, 117, 158, 181, 193, 239 Administration of exogenous sources of NO, including L-arginine, sodium nitroprusside, and nitroglycerin, greatly attenuates these detrimental effects. 3, 69, 95, 228 In a prospective study of 53 premature infants, Zamora et al. 317 demonstrated a significantly lower plasma arginine level at the time of diagnosis in infants in whom NEC developed than in controls. In a randomized prospective placebo-controlled study of VLBW infants assigned to receive either daily oral or parenteral L-arginine supplements (261 mg/kg) or placebo for the first 28 days of life, Amin et al. 8 found a significantly lower incidence of NEC in the supplement group (6.7%) than in the control group (27.3%). Throughout the study, the group that received arginine supplementation had significantly higher mean plasma arginine levels than the control group did. Interestingly, in both groups the infants in whom NEC developed had significantly lower plasma arginine levels at the time of diagnosis than their respective peers did. It is not known whether the decreased arginine levels represent increased utilization for NO production, consumption for the synthesis of other proteins, or decreased enteral absorption. This study suggests the possible benefits of arginine supplementation and potentially other NO donors in the prevention of NEC.",

Within several hours of stimulation, NOS-2 expression and activity within the intestinal epithelium increase up to 15-fold and result in the production of large amounts of NO. 287 Although the low levels of NO produced by the constitutive isoforms of NOS may play a homeostatic role in the GI tract, sustained release of NO as a result of up-regulation of NOS-2 has been suggested to have deleterious effects by inducing cellular injury and failure of the mucosal barrier. 53, 60, 287 This is thought to occur by the reaction of excess NO with superoxide (O 2 \u2212 ) to produce peroxynitrite (ONOO \u2212 ), which is a potent reactive nitrogen intermediate that may trigger cytotoxic processes, including lipid peroxidation and DNA damage. 60, 242, 256 In a prospective study investigating NOS-2 expression in the intestine of infants undergoing resection for NEC, Ford et al. 84 demonstrated marked up-regulation of NOS-2 gene expression in the intestinal epithelium and increased apoptosis of enterocytes in the apical villi. In addition, increased levels of nitrotyrosine residues were detected in the apical villi, thus suggesting that the mucosal injury and increased apoptosis were mediated through the formation of NO and peroxynitrite. In a neonatal rat hypoxia model of NEC in which breast milk-fed animals were compared with formula-fed animals, Nadler et al. 208 demonstrated a significantly higher incidence of NEC, NOS-2 expression, and enterocyte apoptosis and decreased IL-12 mRNA in the formula-fed group than in the breast milk-fed group. The decreased IL-12 expression is thought to be mediated by NO and theorized to contribute to intestinal injury by attenuating bacterial clearance.",

COX-1 is constitutively expressed in many tissues, including the GI tract. 308 COX-2 is the inducible form that is expressed in inflammatory conditions of the GI tract such as inflammatory bowel disease. 11, 270 Proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1, IL-6, TNF-\u03b1), as well as the proinflammatory transcription factor nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB), have been shown to increase COX-2 expression. 266 NF-\u03baB is an important protein in the activation of a number of inflammatory mediators and cytokines. 189 A marked increase in COX-2 expression has been demonstrated in intestine resected from infants with severe NEC. 55 To elucidate the mechanisms involved in COX-2 expression in NEC, Chung et al., 55 in a neonatal rat model of NEC, demonstrated a coordinated induction of NF-\u03baB activation and COX-2 expression during the early phase of the injurious event.",

            "text": "Reduced mucosal blood flow leading to cellular hypoxia and injury is one of the most frequently cited etiologic factors for NEC. Touloukian 290 emphasized the high incidence of perinatal physiologic stressors that may primarily or secondarily cause intestinal ischemia. Chief among these factors are hypoxic and hypotensive episodes, exchange transfusions through the umbilical vein, umbilical artery catheters, cardiovascular lesions, and serum hyperviscosity. An atavistic \"diving reflex\" in which blood is preferentially diverted away from the splanchnic circulation in order to maintain adequate perfusion of the heart and brain has been hypothesized to occur during these episodes. 216 During periods of low blood flow and subsequent reperfusion, Parks et al. 227 found that a reaction between xanthine oxidase, hypoxanthine, and molecular oxygen results in a burst of superoxide radical production. These free radicals may cause damage to cellular and mitochondrial membranes and alter the permeability of the intestinal mucosal barrier. Although animal studies provide support for this theory, clinical correlation has been lacking, and prospective clinical trials have not been able to consistently establish an association between a hypoxic event and the development of NEC. 145 Extensive investigation into the critical role of various inflammatory mediators in the pathogenesis of NEC has been conducted. Studies in animal models and human specimens have identified PAF, LPS, NO, and TNF-\u03b1 as potential mediators of the disease. 48, 84, 94 The effects of LPS and TNF-\u03b1 have been shown to be mediated by PAF. Increased mucosal permeability and susceptibility allowing translocation of bacteria or bacterial toxin and activation of the inflammatory cascade are thought to be the critical steps leading to the final collapse of intestinal epithelial integrity. 654, 167 Very little is known about the early chain of events that occur at the onset of tissue damage. Recent studies have suggested that the disruption in the intestinal mucosal barrier results from accelerated apoptosis. All of the key mediators identified in NEC (PAF, NO, LPS, TNF-\u03b1) have been shown to cause apoptosis of intestinal epithelial cells. 58, 84, 119, 314 In a neonatal rat model of NEC involving formula-fed animals exposed to hypoxia and cold stress and mother-fed controls, Jilling et al. 123 demonstrated a marked increase in apoptosis in the epithelial layer of the NEC group in comparison to controls, although the mechanism was undetermined. The accelerated apoptosis was shown to precede gross morphologic changes in the intestinal epithelium. Administration of a pan-caspase inhibitor to inhibit intestinal apoptosis resulted in a significantly reduced rate of epithelial apoptosis, as well as a decreased incidence of NEC, thus suggesting that apoptosis was the underlying cause of the subsequent mucosal damage ultimately leading to NEC.",

This accelerated apoptosis is thought to result in a \"bare area\" at the villus tip representing a break in the intestinal mucosal barrier where bacteria may attach, translocate, and initiate an inflammatory cascade. 236 In addition, peroxynitrite has also been shown to inhibit the proliferation of intestinal epithelial cells in rat models of NEC. 237 The data suggest that in conditions associated with sustained overproduction of NO or peroxynitrite (e.g., NEC), intestinal epithelial barrier dysfunction may result from an imbalance caused by accelerated epithelial injury and blunted tissue repair mechanisms.",

The infant may experience intermittent episodes of apnea and bradycardia. The broadspectrum antibiotics that are routinely administered eliminate the infant's anaerobic flora, which normally functions as a barrier to colonization and overgrowth of potentially pathogenic gram-negative organisms. Instead of breast milk, formula feedings are usually administered. Formula provides substrate for bacterial growth and contains none of the protective factors present in breast milk. Poor peristalsis of the GI tract permits overgrowth by pathogenic bacteria. Depending on the quantity and virulence of the microorganisms and the presence or absence of mucosal damage, bacteria may breach the mucosal barrier. Because of deficiencies in both specific and nonspecific immune defenses, bacterial killing is ineffective. Either through episodes of decreased perfusion and reperfusion or through mild infection, the mucosal barrier is damaged. Proinflammatory cytokines are induced and result in initiation of the inflammatory cascade. This cascade leads to increased mucosal permeability, which in turn causes further damage to the mucosa and bowel wall. More bacteria and bacterial by-products invade through the mucosal breaks, and progressive bowel damage results in fullthickness necrosis and perforation.",

Stool samples are commonly positive for occult blood and reducing substances. Book et al. 30 reasoned that intestinal mucosal damage from NEC leads to carbohydrate malabsorption. Poorly digested carbohydrates pass into the colon where they are fermented and excreted in stool. The authors tested the stool of formulafed infants for reducing substances with Clinitest tablets and found that 71% of formula-fed infants in whom NEC developed had greater than 2+ reducing substances in their stool. Colonic bacterial fermentation increases the local production of D-lactate, which is absorbed and excreted by the kidneys. Garcia et al. 86 could show elevated urinary D-lactate levels in infants with NEC but not in control infants. With recovery from NEC or administration of enteral antibiotics, D-lactate excretion decreased. Similarly, hydrogen excretion in the breath is elevated when fermentation is increased. This test is helpful in ruling out NEC. A negative result on a breath hydrogen test is 99% accurate in ruling out NEC. 54 C-reactive protein (CRP), an acute phase reactant, has been measured in an attempt to correlate its level with the presence, absence, or resolution of the disease. 120 CRP may serve as an early indicator of NEC when its level rises more than 10 mg/L within 48 hours of the suspected diagnosis (reported sensitivity, 92%; specificity, 81%).

Blood and urine samples are sent for culture, and broadspectrum intravenous antibiotic therapy is initiated. Until recently, most antibiotic regimens included a penicillin, an aminoglycoside, and an agent effective against anaerobic organisms. It seems logical that coverage for anaerobic organisms be included because these infants are usually 1 to 2 weeks old, but in carefully performed studies, anaerobes are sparse. To date, no controlled study has shown the efficacy of this therapy. The antibiotic regimen is best tailored not only to the most common organisms found with NEC but also to the nosocomial nursery flora. Because of recent reports of patients with stool and blood cultures positive for coagulase-negative staphylococci, some groups now empirically treat patients with a combination of vancomycin and gentamicin or vancomycin and a third-generation cephalosporin. 262 The incidence of fungal sepsis in infants who die of NEC is high, so a strong index of suspicion must be maintained and empirical antifungal therapy should be considered if the patient continues to be symptomatic without an obvious bacterial cause. Close clinical observation consists of frequent physical examination, two-view abdominal radiography performed every 6 to 8 hours, serum platelet and leukocyte counts, and blood gas analysis.",

Unfortunately, no combination of clinical examination or adjunct testing has been shown to have high sensitivity for intestinal gangrene. 153, 155 Thus, there remains controversy regarding the indications for surgery, the most appropriate timing of intervention, and the optimal surgical treatment strategy. The most widely accepted indication for surgery is the presence of pneumoperitoneum. In an attempt to identify characteristics that may serve as predictors of intestinal gangrene, Kosloske 153 reviewed 12 criteria used as indications for surgery in 147 patients with NEC and stratified these criteria according to sensitivity, specificity, positive/negative predictive value, and prevalence. The \"best\" indicators (specificity and positive predictive value [PPV] approaching 100%, prevalence >10%) were pneumoperitoneum, positive paracentesis (aspiration of >0.5 mL brown or yellow fluid containing bacteria on Gram stain), and portal venous gas. \"Good\" indicators (specificity and PPV approaching 100%, prevalence <10%) were a fixed intestinal loop, erythema of the abdominal wall, and a palpable abdominal mass. A \"fair\" indicator (specificity of 91%, PPV of 94%, prevalence of 20%) was \"severe\" pneumatosis intestinalis as graded by a radiographic system. \"Poorer\" indicators were clinical deterioration (PPV of 78%), platelet count lower than 100,000/mm 3 (PPV of 50%), abdominal tenderness (PPV of 58%), severe GI hemorrhage (PPV of 50%), and gasless abdomen with ascites (0%). Unfortunately, none of the indicators had sensitivity greater than 48%. Currently, the only absolute indication for surgery is pneumoperitoneum.

Unfortunately, pneumoperitoneum is not always demonstrable in neonates with gut perforation, with one study reporting that only 63% of infants with perforation demonstrated free air. 85 Paracentesis A positive result on paracentesis, defined as free-flowing aspiration of more than 0.5 mL of brown or yellow-brown fluid that contains bacteria on gram stain, 53 is highly specific for intestinal necrosis. A negative result on paracentesis is rare with intestinal necrosis but can occur when a localized, walled-off perforation is present or a segment of bowel is injured but not perforated. 246 There is no absolute indication for paracentesis. Kosloske 153 recommends abdominal paracentesis for patients with extensive pneumatosis intestinalis or for those who do not improve with nonoperative management. If no peritoneal fluid is aspirated, peritoneal lavage is performed by instilling up to 30 mL/kg of normal saline solution into the peritoneal cavity, turning the patient from side to side, and then withdrawing the fluid. Ricketts and Jerles 246 reported a greater than 70% survival rate when a positive result on abdominal paracentesis was used as the indication for surgery in 51% of their patients; three false negatives occurred. They performed paracentesis when there was erythema and edema of the abdominal wall, portal vein gas, a fixed and dilated loop on sequential abdominal radiography, a fixed and tender abdominal mass, or persistent clinical deterioration.

In 1977, Ein et al. 77 reported the use of peritoneal drainage (PD) as a means of stabilizing and improving the systemic status of premature infants with perforation before laparotomy. Since then, primary treatment with PD has been used in a variety of settings, and some investigators have suggested that it may serve as definitive therapy. 14, 66, 93, 176, 203 In a prospective study involving 44 infants treated with PD as primary management for advanced NEC, Demestre et al. 66 reported 28 patients (63.6%) treated with PD only and 16 patients (36.4%) who required laparotomy after PD. The survival rate after PD only was 64%, although 86% demonstrated improvement after drainage. After PD, 54% of infants required delayed surgery. Morgan et al. 203 used PD as primary treatment of NEC and perforation for infants weighing less than 1500 g and for unstable babies heavier than 1500 g. They reported a 79% survival rate after PD, with 17 of 23 (73.9%) survivors requiring no other operative intervention. Moss et al. 205 recently performed a meta-analysis of PD versus laparotomy for perforated NEC and reviewed 10 published studies on this topic. Because of the marked bias in treatment assignment, with a greater proportion of smaller babies undergoing PD versus laparotomy, the authors were unable to determine the relative merits of PD. Currently, most surgeons propose PD as the initial treatment in VLBW infants with perforated NEC to allow resuscitation and stabilization before definitive laparotomy. In an attempt to address this issue, two multicenter prospective randomized controlled trials are currently in progress to compare PD with primary laparotomy in premature infants less than 1000 g (A. Pierro: NET trial) or less than 1500 g (R.L. Moss: NECSTEPS trial).",

Effective supportive treatment includes improved ventilatory strategies, surfactant therapy, total parenteral nutrition, improved understanding of the pathophysiology and management of critically ill newborns, and advancements in pediatric anesthesia. The increased survival has been most noticeable in infants who weigh less than 1000 g and are less than 28 weeks' gestational age. In a recent review of 754 premature infants born between 22 and 25 weeks' gestation, the overall survival rate was 63%, with a range of 14% at 22 weeks' gestation to 76% at 25 weeks' gestation. 51 Mortality was still significantly higher in VLBW infants than larger patients. This is highlighted by studies that examined the outcome of VLBW infants in comparison to \"standard\" premature infants (>1000 g) with pan-involvement NEC. Snyder et al. 273 found that infants weighing less than 1000 g are more likely to require surgery (51% versus 34%) and to eventually have pan-involvement (10% versus 4%) than infants greater than 1000 g. Pan-involvement was associated with 100% mortality in both groups. In a retrospective study of 70 infants weighing less than 1000 g with perforated NEC, Erhlich et al. 75 demonstrated that infant survival was independent of the type of surgical treatment (PD versus laparotomy), but instead was inversely related to the number of comorbid conditions associated with the patient.",

It is recommended that developmental screening be performed every 4 months during the first year and every 6 months during the second year because long-term follow-up data suggest that normal premature infants and survivors of severe NEC remain at high risk for neurologic developmental morbidity. Approximately 50% of infants surviving NEC are neurodevelopmentally normal. 246, 280 Historically, it was believed that any adverse neurodevelopmental outcome in a patient treated for NEC was due to underlying prematurity and comorbid conditions rather than the NEC itself, but recent evaluations of surviving infants contest this assumption. Vohr et al. 301 studied the neurodevelopmental, neurosensory, and functional outcomes of 1151 extremely low-birth-weight (401 to 1000 g) survivors at 18 to 22 months' corrected age and reported significant deficits in neurologic development (25%), a Bayley II Mental Developmental Index less than 70 (37%), a Psychomotor Development Index less than 70 (29%), vision impairment (9%), and hearing impairment (11%). NEC was specifically associated as a risk factor for both an abnormal neurologic examination and a low Bayley Psychomotor Development Index. In a study assessing the effect of NEC on neurodevelopment, Sonntag et al. 277 compared VLBW infants with NEC with matched infants without NEC at 12 and 20 months' corrected age. Despite normal somatic growth in infants with NEC not complicated by short-bowel syndrome, the authors demonstrated significant neurodevelopmental delay at both 12 and 20 months of age. Fifty-five percent of infants with NEC were noted to be severely retarded versus only 22.5% of infants without NEC.",

Halac et al. 101 conducted a randomized, controlled trial of prenatal glucocorticoid administration to mothers in preterm labor. The control mothers received placebo, but their infants received an immediate postnatal course of high-dose dexamethasone for 7 days. The rate of NEC within and between groups significantly decreased after prenatal and postnatal steroid treatment. Although postnatal therapy did not decrease the incidence as effectively as prenatal therapy did, it improved the clinical outcome of NEC; however, many potentially confounding factors were not assessed in this study.

The use of an enteral aminoglycoside (e.g., kanamycin or gentamicin) has been proposed as a means to decrease the incidence of perforation during nonoperative treatment. However, randomized, controlled studies found no difference in the clinical course, complications, or mortality rate between infants who received the antibiotic and those who did not. 74, 194 In addition, oral aminoglycosides may be absorbed across the damaged gut, which can lead to increased serum levels and thereby potentially contribute to drug toxicity. Resistant strains of bacteria emerged after treatment with enteral kanamycin, 74 and there is the omnipresent risk for promotion of the growth of fungal species. In a recent randomized placebo-controlled study of oral vancomycin in preventing NEC in preterm infants, Siu et al. 271 reported a 50% reduction in the incidence of NEC in the vancomycin group in comparison to controls.",
