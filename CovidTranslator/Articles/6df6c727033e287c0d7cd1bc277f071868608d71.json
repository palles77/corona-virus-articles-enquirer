            "text": "It has been well documented that BST2 restricts the release of enveloped viruses by cross-linking newly produced virions to the cell membrane. However, it is less clear whether and how BST2 inhibits the release of enveloped viruses which bud via the secretory pathway. Here, we demonstrated that BST2 restricts the release of Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) whose budding occurs at the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment, and in turn, JEV infection downregulates BST2 expression. We further found that the JEV envelope protein E, but not other viral components, significantly downregulates BST2 with the viral protein M playing an auxiliary role in the process. Envelope protein E-mediated BST2 downregulation appears to undergo lysosomal degradation pathway. Additional study revealed that the transmembrane domain and the coiled-coil domain (CC) of BST2 are the target domains of viral protein E and that the N-and C-terminal membrane anchors and the CC domain of BST2 are essential for blocking JEV release. Our results together indicate that the release of enveloped viruses whose budding take place in an intracellular compartment can be restricted by BST2.",

            "text": "Bone marrow stromal cell antigen 2 (BST2) is an unusual type II glycoprotein composed of a short N-terminal cytoplasmic domain, a transmembrane domain, an extracellular loop and a C-terminal Glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor (Hinz et al., 2010; Kupzig et al., 2003; Perez-Caballero et al., 2009) . A number of viruses have been reported to be restricted by BST2, including retroviruses (alpha-, beta-, delta-, lenti-, and spuma-) (Jouvenet et al., 2009) , arenaviruses (Lassa virus and Machupo virus) (Radoshitzky et al., 2010; Sakuma et al., 2009) , herpesviruses (Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus and human simplex virus) (Blondeau et al., 2013; Liu et al., 2015; Mansouri et al., 2009; Zenner et al., 2013) , filoviruses (Ebola virus and Marburg virus) (Jouvenet et al., 2009; Sakuma et al., 2009) , rhabdoviruses (vesicular stomatitis virus) (Weidner et al., 2010) , paramyxoviruses (Nipah virus), orthomyxoviruses (influenza A virus) (Watanabe et al., 2011; Yondola et al., 2011) , and flaviviruses (Dengue virus) (Pan et al., 2012) . To date, several viral antagonists have been shown to counteract the restriction of BST2, including the Vpu (Neil et al., 2008) , Env (Gupta et al., 2009) and Nef (Jia et al., 2009; Sakuma et al., 2009) proteins from primate lentiviruses, the K5 protein from KHSV (Mansouri et al., 2009; Pardieu et al., 2010) , the glycoprotein (GP) from Ebola virus (Sakuma et al., 2009) , the virion host shutoff protein (vhs) and glycoprotein M (gM) from HSV-1 (Blondeau et al., 2013; Zenner et al., 2013) , and multiple viral glycoproteins (gB, gD, gH, gL) from HSV-2 (Liu et al., 2015) . The fate of BST2 counteracted by viruses remains inconclusive. For instance, while some studies reported that Vpu mediates BST2 degradation through proteasomal pathway Mangeat et al., 2009) , others suggested that Vpu induces the retention of BST2 within the endolysosomal system with concomitant partial lysosomal degradation (Iwabu et al., 2009) . KSHV K5 promotes BST2 lysosomal degradation through the ubiquitination of a single lysine residue in the cytoplasmic domain of the protein, which targets BST2 for transport to lysosomes via the ESCRT pathway (Mansouri et al., 2009; Pardieu et al., 2010) , whereas HIV-2 Env exclusively sequesters BST2 within the TGN with no concomitant degradation (Hauser et al., 2010; Le Tortorec and Neil, 2009) .",

Firstly, 293T cells were transfected with BST2 expression plasmid (pBST2) or pcDNA3.1 and then collected at different time points post transfection. The expression of BST2 was confirmed by Western blot. As shown in Fig. 1A , BST2 displayed several isoforms, likely due to heterogeneity of glycosylation during post-translational modification (Andrew et al., 2009 ). There was no detectable BST2 at 6 h post transfection. 293T cells transfected with pBST2 or pcDNA3.1 were infected with JEV at an MOI of 10 at 6 h post transfection. At different time points post infection, plaque assays were conducted to assess the amounts of infectious cell-free virions (SV) and cell-associated progeny virions (CV) containing both extracellular viruses attached to the cell and intracellular viruses. As shown in Fig. 1B , there was about 2-fold reduction of infectious cell-free virions in the presence of BST2. In contrast, the titer of CV in BST2-expressing cells was higher than that from pcDNA3.1 transfected cells (Fig. 1C) , suggesting that exogenous expression of BST2 restricts the release of JEV progeny virions. The antiviral property of endogenous BST2 was also examined in HeLa cells. Retroviral vectors expressing BST2 shRNA or control shRNA were used. Western blot showed that, at 48 h post transfection, all of the four BST2 shRNAs reduced the expression of BST2 with different efficiency and the most effective shRNA was the #4BST2 shRNA ( Fig. 2A) . Subsequently, the #4BST2 shRNA was used in the following experiments. Flow cytometry and western blot analysis indicated that BST2 shRNA reduced cell-surface and total expression levels of BST2 at 12 h post-transfection ( Fig. 2B and C). HeLa cells transfected with BST2 shRNA or control shRNA were infected with JEV at an MOI of 25 at 6 h post shRNA transfection. The amounts of SV and CV were analyzed at different time points post infection. As shown in Fig. 2D , downregulation of BST2 led to a 2.5-fold increase of SV production, whereas the CV of the control cells was more than that in the BST2-depleted HeLa cells (Fig. 2E ). The level of protein E in SV or CV were determined by western blot assay at 24 h post infection. As shown in Fig. 2F , there was much more protein E in SV in the absence of BST2. In contrast, the level of protein E in CV of BST2-expressing cells was higher than that from BST2 shRNA or pcDNA3.1 transfected cells. These data together demonstrated that BST2 can function as a restriction factor to inhibit the release of JEV progeny virions.",

Compared to pcDNA3.1, *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001. surface followed by either sequestration in intracellular compartments or degradation in the lysosomes or proteasome. For instance, HIV-1 and Sendai virus can downregulate the expression level of BST2 on the cell surface (Bampi et al., 2013; Douglas et al., 2009) . To investigate whether JEV has a similar capability, we first examined whether JEV infection can reduce the endogenous expression of BST2. HeLa cells were infected with JEV at an MOI of 25. At different time points post infection, cells were collected and analyzed. The total expression level of BST2 was decreased at 36 h post infection (Fig. S1A ), while the cellular localization of BST2 did not changed (Fig. S1B ). As shown in Fig. 3A , the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of cell-surface BST2 in infected cells was lower than that in the mock-infected cells, indicating that the surface expression level of BST2 was significantly downregulated following JEV infection. Western blot analysis showed that the total expression level of BST2 was also decreased in the parallel samples (Fig. 3B) . We subsequently investigated whether JEV infection reduced the exogenous expression of BST2. After 6 h post transfection with pBST2, 293T cells were infected with JEV at an MOI of 10. Consistent with the results shown in Fig. 3A and B, JEV infection significantly decreased cell surface and total expression of BST2 in 293T cells ( Fig. 3C and D) . To examine whether BST2 downregulation was due to the depletion of BST2 mRNA as suggested by others (Zenner et al., 2013) , BST2 mRNA was measured by real-time PCR. As shown in Fig. 3E , the BST2 mRNA level in JEV-infected cells had no significant difference compared with that in uninfected cells. These data suggested that the expression level of BST2 was reduced by JEV infection.",

In an attempt to clarify the mechanism of BST2 degradation caused by JEV, expressing vectors encoding different JEV structural and non-structural proteins were transfected into HeLa cells, respectively. At 48 h post transfection, the surface expression of BST2 was examined by flow cytometry. We observed that BST2 was downregulated on the cell surface following transfection of plasmid expressing envelope protein E (Fig. 4A) . We compared the downregulation effects of protein E in both HeLa cells and BST2-transfected 293T cells, while HIV-1 Vpu was used as a positive control.

Similarly, the expression of protein E profoundly reduced the surface and total expression of BST2 in BST2-transfected 293T cells ( Fig. 4D and E). To examine whether envelope protein E mediateddownregulation of BST2 undergoes lysosomal degradation, we used a lysosome enrichment kit (Thermo) to isolate and enrich intact lysosomes from cells transfected with pCAGGS or plasmids expressing MEflag. The prepared cell extracts were ultracentrifuged by density gradient centrifugation. The corresponding bands were collected and the harvested lysosome pellets were detected by western blot. As shown in Fig. 4F , the lysosome marker LAMP1, BST2 and protein E all existed in the separated samples from ME-flag-transfected cells. In contrast, only LAMP1 existed in the samples from pCAGGS transfected cells. To examine whether protein E mediated-downregulation of BST2 undergoes proteasomal degradation pathway, HeLa cells were transfected with pCAGGS or prME plasmid followed by cultivation in the presence of the proteasome protease inhibitor (MG132). At 24 h post transfection, cells were processed for immunofluorescence staining for subcellular localization of BST2 and a proteasome marker 20S proteasome, showing that BST2 colocalized with the 20S proteasome in the presence or absence of protein E (Fig. S2) . These data together indicated that protein E mediated-downregulation of BST2 undergoes lysosomal degradation.",

Although prM alone did not downregulate BST2, whether it plays a role in facilitating the function of protein E on BST2 downregulation was unclear. Therefore, co-IP experiments were carried out to assess the role of prM during the process of BST2 downregulation. 293T cells were cotransfected with plasmids encoding E-flag (the protein E with a flag tag) or prME-flag (the fusion protein of E and prM with a flag tag) and BST2. Precleared cell lysates were incubated with an antiflag antibody, and the resulting complexes were analyzed by western blotting using the antibody against BST2. As shown in Fig. 5A , BST2 was specifically and effectively precipitated in the presence of protein E. The co-IP experiments were also performed by pulling down with the anti-BST2 antibody, followed by western blot with the anti-flag antibody. The flag antibody was able to specifically precipitate the immune complex that contained the BST2 and E-flag or ME-flag (Fig. 5B) . To preclude a possible interaction between prM and BST2, 293T cells were contransfected with prM-HA and BST2. The lysates were immunoprecipitated with the anti-HA antibody and the anti-BST2 antibody, respectively, showing that prM did not interact with BST2 (Fig. 5C ). To further confirm the interaction of protein E with BST2 in JEV-infected cells, we used JEV to infect HeLa cells at an MOI of 25. At 48 h post infection, cells were collected and assayed by co-IP. The interaction between BST2 and protein E was observed in JEV-infected cells (Fig. 5D) . Immunofluorescence assay was also carried out in parallel. 293T cells were cotransfected with plasmids encoding E-flag (the protein E with a flag tag) or prME-flag (the fusion protein of E and prM with a flag tag) and BST2. At 24 h post transfection, cells were analyzed for colocalization by confocal microscopy. As shown in Fig. 5E , the JEV protein E colocalized with BST2 on cell surfaces of both non-permeabilized and permeabilized cells. In the presence of prM, more protein E was detected on the cell surface than that in the absence of prM (Fig. 5F ). Taken together, these results confirmed a specific interaction between protein E and BST2 and the auxiliary role of prM in this process. ",

Examples include HIV-1 Vpu, HIV-2 Env, simian immunodeficiency virus Nef and Env, Ebola and Sendai virus GP, and KSHV K5. We found that JEV infection significantly downregulated BST2 expression. After examining the structural and non-structural proteins of JEV, we identified envelope proteins E as the only viral component that downregulated the cell surface and total expression levels of BST2. Co-IP assays demonstrated a specific interaction between the viral protein E and BST2, revealing that protein E functions as a viral antagonist to counteract the restriction by the host. JEV infection or viral protein E resulted in BST2 degradation in both HeLa cells which constitutively express BST2 and 293T cells exogenously expressing BST2, indicating that JEV counteracts BST2 in a cell type and expression mode independent fashion. There are several proposed mechanisms for viral proteins to antagonize BST2, including lysosomal degradation, proteasomal degradation, and/or sequestration/retargeting of BST2 to the trans-Golgi network. Using proteasomal protease inhibitors, immunofluorescence imaging revealed that BST2 colocalized with the proteasome marker 20S proteasome in the presence or absence of protein E. Western blot assay showed that protein E and BST2 existed in the isolated lysosomes of protein E-transfected cells. These together indicate that protein E promotes the degradation of BST2 via lysosomal pathway.",

The M protein is derived from a glycosylated precursor membrane protein (prM) following a cleavage by a furin-like protease when immature virions are released via the secretory pathway (Mukhopadhyay et al., 2005) . It has been demonstrated that prM is required for the proper folding, membrane association and assembly of the flavivirus envelope protein E (Konishi and Mason, 1993; Mukhopadhyay et al., 2005) . We found that higher expression level of protein E was detected in the presence of prM than that in absence of prM, indicating that prM likely plays an auxiliary role in protein Emediated BST2 downregulation, likely by promoting more protein E to interact with BST2.",
