It acts as both an antiviral agent and an immunomodulator as well as a cell growth inhibitor. Several leukocyte populations are able to secrete IFNa, in response to virus stimuli, depending on the virus used and on whether viral infection of leukocytes is necessary or not.",

Human and porcine NIPCs have been characterized as highly infrequent, non-phagocytic, non-adherent, non-B, non-T, MHC II+ and CD4+ cells (Cederblad and AIm, 1990; Charley and Lavenant, 1990; Sandberg et al., 1990; Fitzgerald-Bocarsly, 1993; Nowacki and Charley, 1993) . Viral glycoproteins were suggested as being responsible for triggering synthesis of IFNa in NIPC. Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to viral glycoproteins of herpes simplex virus type I, transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) and Aujeszky's disease virus were shown to block virus-induced IFNa. secretion (Lebon, 1985; Charley and Laude, 1988; Artursson, 1993) . However, the precise nature of NIPCs as well as of the interactions between NIPCs and virus leading to IFNa production remains to be elucidated.",

This type of placentation together with multiparity, relatively long term of gestation and size of foetuses makes this species suitable for studies on the development of the immune system. In an earlier study on the prenatal ontogeny of porcine IFNa-SCs, we detected in vitro inducible IFNa-SCs in pig foetal liver and other 1ymphohaematopoietic organs, at very early stages of gestation (Splichal et aI., 1994) . The present study was undertaken to evaluate in utero viral induction of IFNa-SC in pig foetuses by TGEV, either partially or fully UV-inactivated, at different stages of gestation. We found that 10 or 20 h after in utero injection of TGEV in the umbilical cord of pig foetuses, IFNa-SCs were detected ex vivo in Iymphohaematopoietic tissues by the ELISPOT assay.",

Foetuses were thereafter infected with this amount of partially inactivated TGEV, and other foetuses were shamoperated as controls. At 52 days of gestation only three foetuses (two infected and one control) survived till the next day; dead foetuses infected by virus did not exhibit any macroscopic pathological lesions when compared with the dead control foetus. Only cell suspensions and plasma of surviving foetuses were used for IFNa determina-tions.IFNa-SCs or IFNa were detected in liver and bone marrow cells or plasma in only one of two TGEV-treated foetuses already at mid-gestation (day 52) (table I). In the spleen they were found at later stages of gestation. The highest IFNa-SC frequency was observed in foetal liver. A slightly higher IFNa-SC frequency was detected in non-adherent cells compared with that in total cells (table I, 101 days). The absence of lFNa-SCs in spleen cells at 52 days may be due to the limited number of cells. The highest IFNa-SC frequency was observed by 101 days of gestation. whilst IFNa yield (production of IFNa per cell) was roughly constant (table II). No IFNa secretion in bone marrow cell culture supernatants could be detected at 52 days of gestation (table II) , although low numbers of IFNa-specific spots were detected in one stimulated foetus (table I) . Results are expressed as individual data or as means \u00b1 standard deviation. Day of gestation =day of stimulation by TGEV; ( a) nonadherent fraction; ( b) low number of cells. ND=non-detected.",

J.FN was found not only in human foetuses during intraamniotic rubella infection (Lebon et al., 1985) but also in the amniotic fluid of pregnant women without clinical signs of congenital virus infection (Lebon et al., 1982b) . Following our previous demonstration that in vitro inducible IFNa-SCs were present at early stages of gestation in porcine foetal lymphohaematopoietic organs (SpHchal et al., 1994) , the aim of the present study was therefore to evaluate, at the cell level, the secretion of IFNa following in utero intravenous injection of TGEV in pig foetuses at different stages of gestation. The study was divided into two parts: (a) induction of IFNa secretion by partially inactivated wild TGEV, for which IFNa secretion was analysed in total cell populations (first series of experiments) and (b) induction of IFNa secretion in the non-adherent IFNa-SC fraction (presumably NIPC-like cells) after exposure to non-infectious TGEV. Wild and dm49-4 mutant TGEVs were compared in order to evaluate the influence of an amino acid point mutation in protein M on the IFNa-inducing properties in vivo (second series of experiments). even in the case of one control foetus treated by saline only, which could be due to easier damage of the umbilical cord at this period of gestation than with older foetuses.",

The fact that IFNa-SCs were found in only one virus-injected foetus may be due to an unsuccessful virus inoculation.

A much lower IFNa production was observed after injection of fully inactivated virus compared with that after injection of infectious TGEV, as evidenced by both lower plasma IFNa titres and lFNa-SC frequency. This lower IFNa induction very probably reflects a lower amount of virus available when non-infectious TGEV is injected. lFNa-SCs or IFNa was never found in blood cell suspensions (negative data not shown), but due to the low number of PBMC obtained, we cannot conclude whether these negative results could only be due to an insufficient number of cells tested or to a real absence of IFNa-SCs.",

In the pre sent study, cell s isolated fr om fo etal Iymph ohaematopoietic org an s were an aly sed on the basis of their size, internal complexity (SSC/FSC) and surface markers . PMN with a higher sse parameter could be distinguished from mononuclear leukocytes (MaC) with lower internal complexity. The PMN/MOC ratio was found to be reduced in virus-treated foetal organs (figs. l a, b and c). In most cases studied, PMN percentages were lower in wild-virus-treated than in dm49 -4-treated foetuses ( fig. 2) . Because dm49-4 did not induce IFNa in vivo, it is likely that TGEV-induced reduction of PMN percentages is IFNa-mediated. Previous studies also showed that immunization of pig foetuses with corpuscular antigen resulted in depletion of myeloid cells from foetallymphohaematopoietic organs (Sterzl and Kovafu, 1977) .

IFNa detected in foetal infected tissues may indeed originate from NIPCs localized in foetal lymphohaematopoietic tissues. In addition, our experimental model of in utero induction of IFNa in pig foetuses will prove to be useful for future studies on prenatal cytokine network development. Th is work was partly supported by INRA (DRI) and grants no. 508/94/0153 and 524/97/0533 of the Grant Agency of the Czech Republic.",

Le travail presente ici a consiste arealiser sur des foetus de pores a differents stades de gestation une injection in utero (a) de VGET sauvage partiellement inactive par les UV, ou (b) de virus sauvage ou de mutant dm49-4 totalement inactives. La secretion d'IFNa par les cellules nucleees isolees, 10 ou 20 h apres injection, de la rate, du foie, de la moelle osseuse et du sang fcetaux a ete analysee ex vivo par technique ELISPOT et ELISA. L'injection de VGET a induit la presence de cellules secretrices d'IFNa dans les organes lyrnphohernatopoletiquesfoetaux ami-gestation. Une secretion d'IFNa plus faible, voice absente, a ete observee a la suite de l'injection du mutant viral dm49-4 caracterise par une mutation ponctuelle dans la sequence de la glycoproteine M.
