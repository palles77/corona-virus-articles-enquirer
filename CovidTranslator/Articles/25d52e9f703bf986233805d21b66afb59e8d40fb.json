However, there is no quantitative information about the effect of colds on the lung function of infants with RW. This study was undertaken to determine the effect of common cold on forced expiratory parameters measured from raised lung volume in infants with RW. Methods: Spirometric lung function (expiratory flows from raised lung volume) was randomly assessed in 28 infants with RW while they had a common cold and when asymptomatic. Results: It was found that during colds there was a significant decrease in all forced expiratory parameters and this was much more evident for flows (FEF 50% , FEF 75% and FEF 25-75% ) which were definitively abnormal (less than \u00c01.65 z-score) in the majority of infants. There was not association between family asthma, tobacco exposure, and other factors, with the extent of lung function decrease during colds. Tobacco during pregnancy but not a history of family asthma was significantly associated to lower expiratory flows; however, the association was significant only when infants were asymptomatic. Conclusion: This study shows that common colds cause a marked reduction of lung function in infants with RW.",

            "text": "Most wheezing episodes and asthma exacerbations in children and adults are caused by viruses responsible for upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) or common colds. [1] [2] [3] Of the several known viruses which cause the disease, the role of rhinoviruses is most prominent but several other common respiratory viruses are associated with respiratory illness and wheezing in infants and children. [4] [5] [6] [7] Experimental studies in adult asthmatics have demonstrated that rhinovirus, one of the most common causes of natural colds, can increase airway responsiveness, inflammation, and decrease lung function very early (in the first 2-4 days) after experimental inoculation, 8 whereas other authors have not found significant changes in FEV 1 in asthmatics after rhinovirus inhalation. 9 Under clinical conditions, it has been demonstrated that airway inflammation occurred during natural cold caused by different viruses (influenza A, rhinovirus, adenovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, and coronavirus) is significantly greater in asthmatics than in healthy subjects. 10 At present there is no information in infants with RW as to whether URTI caused by common respiratory viruses results in significant airway obstruction, regardless of the fact that some mechanisms involved in virus-induced airway obstruction may also be present in infancy. 11, 12 It has been found that viruses commonly causing URTI can induce an asthmatic clinical response in infants during the first year of life and later during childhood, [13] [14] [15] but the effect of URTI on their lung function is unknown.",

Lung inflation pressure was set at 30 cm H 2 O, and after delivering several sequential inflations rapid thoracic compression was from raised lung volume and maintained until residual volume was reached. Forced expiratory manoeuvres were repeated with increases of 10 cm H 2 O in jacket pressure until there was no further increase in flows with subsequent increase in jacket pressure. The best curve was selected from three reproducible curves, as the single best shaped curve with the highest product of forced vital capacity (FVC) and FEF between 25% and 75% of FVC (FEF 25-75% ).

In the same direction, we also found a clear association between tobacco exposure during pregnancy and lower expiratory flows, but only when infants were asymptomatic. A possible explanation for this finding may be that in our infants the marked reduction of forced expiratory flows during URTI may have obscured a potential effect of family asthma, perinatal tobacco and larger number of previous episodes of wheezing on the degree of decrease of lung function. Another explanation is that common respiratory viruses can directly induce important mucosal oedema by increasing vascular permeability, particularly during the initial stage of a URTI; 28 in infants with RW it may be that the degree of such a response is unrelated to familiar predisposition or environmental exposures. Recently, it has been found that both, decreased lung function and enhanced bronchial responsiveness, were associated to atopic sensitisation of the infant rather than to family history of asthma or allergies. 29 We did not evaluate the response to an inhaled bronchodilator in our infants; therefore it is unclear whether the lower baseline airway function during URTI reflects increased baseline airway tone, intraluminal airways obstruction due to mucosal oedema, or both. However, the significant increase of lung function achieving normal values when infants were asymptomatic, suggests that in this group of infants a pre-existing fixed smaller-sized airway calibre, as a determinant for the observed lung function decrease, could be ruled out.",
