The following year, such tour was extended to Macao and made available to citizens in other provinces who had relatives or friends in Hong Kong and Macao. However, outbound travel by Chinese really came into existence in 1990 when bilateral tourism agreements with Singapore, Malaysia and Thailand were signed. The agreements allowed Chinese leisure tourists to travel to these countries as members of the Chinese Travel Service (CTS) organised group tours.",

Another major breakthrough in outbound travel came in 1997 when Australia and New Zealand signed the ADSagreements with China, which became operational in 1999. Since then, Chinese people were able to travel outside Asia [25, 21] . Additionally, with the approval of the State Council, the Public Security Bureau (PSB) and CNTA announced in 1997 the \"Temporary rules on Mainland Chinese outbound travel on self-financed mode\", which signified that Chinese outbound travel had evolved from a trial to an official basis [20] . The ADS-agreement with the European Union was signed in February 2004 and became effective in September 2004. This agreement will facilitate Chinese group tourism to 26 member states of the European Union through simplified visa application procedures. By March 2006, 81 countries have been granted ADS by the CNTA, with some of the Caribbean economies (such as the Bahamas and Saint Lucia) being the most recent countries to join the ADS system.",

For instance, the China's Travel Abroad campaign was launched in 1991 to encourage more Chinese to travel overseas. The Chinese government had encouraged professionals and government officials to broaden and advance their knowledge and skill by engaging in more economic and cultural activities such as participating in international conferences and sporting events. As a result, there was enormous growth in overseas travel in 1992 and 1993, with most of the outbound travellers being government officials and employees of State-Owned companies. The government subsequently tightened the control of overseas business travels due to abuses of public funds for unnecessary trips abroad. In 1994, a decline was seen in outbound business travel along with an increase in private travel abroad [29] .",

Another economic phenomenon in China that cannot be overlooked is the geographic imbalance in economic development, and income disparity in different regions. The economic reforms were first implemented in China's coastal areas. According to Wang and Sheldon [22] , urban GDP per capita was 2.5 times of rural GDP per capita in 1993. The gap between the wealthy and poor areas has widened over time. In 2002, the average annual disposable income of city households was three times more than that of rural households [12] . In spite of the uneven distribution of wealth, a large proportion of the Chinese population has incomes which are sufficiently high to make international travel affordable [7] . According to [25] , three major urbanized coastal economic areas have generated most of the outbound tourists. They include the Beijing-Tianjin area, Yangtze River Delta economic area with Shanghai as its centre, and the Pearl River Delta economic area.",

In 1984, only 3000 Chinese visited Australia [7] . The number of tourists from China peaked at 190,100 in 2002, making China Australia's sixth largest international tourism source market (see Fig. 1 ). This market experienced a decline in 2003 by 7.4%, due to the outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). However, the market has quickly recovered in 2004 with a noticeable 43% increase compared to the year before. Apparently, Chinese visitors have the highest per tourist expenditure among all international visitors. An average Chinese traveller spent AU$6070 on their trip to Australia in 1999-2000 (ABS, 2002b, as cited in [13] ). It is estimated that the Chinese market would continue to grow at an average of 18.5% annually from 2003 to 2013. It is projected that China would become Australia's third largest source country for international tourism by 2013, with visitor numbers from China reaching 960,000 [17] . As mentioned earlier, Australia and New Zealand were granted ADS in April 1999 and became the first two Western countries the Chinese government allowed its citizens to visit. This was a milestone for Australia in developing the Chinese market. Under the ADS scheme, Australia first gained access to the markets of Beijing, Shanghai and Guangdong Province, which together have a population of 117 million people [3] . The ADS has allowed Australia to promote itself as a leisure holiday destination in China with a legal status and broadened Australia's market base in China by adding leisure tourism to the two existing markets, namely business, and visit friends and relatives (VFR) tourism.",

            "text": "The purpose of this section is to examine the monthly seasonal patterns of tourist arrivals from China, and to use the Box-Jenkins time series analysis [4] to determine the most appropriate autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model to describe the quarterly tourist arrival series from China to Australia for the period 1984(1)-2004(4). The EViews 5.1 econometric software package and the ratio-to-moving average technique have been used to generate the seasonal indices for the Chinese market. Table 3 shows that 5 out of 12 months are tourism or high seasons, which are defined as months for which the corresponding average indices exceed 100. December is the peak month and June is the lowest month for this period. The monthly seasonal patterns for tourist arrivals have obviously changed over time. According to Tourism Australia [16] , the peak month was mainly February during the period 2002-2005, which coincided with the national celebration of the Spring Festival (or the Chinese Lunar New Year) which tends to fall between January and February. As discussed in Section 2, the Chinese government has increased the holiday period for this occasion from 4 to 7 days, and many Chinese people use this occasion to undertake either domestic or international travel.",

As the reported ADF statistic of \u22122.31 (with a deterministic trend and intercept at lag length 4) is greater than the critical value of \u22123.47 at the 5% significance level, the null hypothesis of a unit root is not rejected. And this implies that the series are non-stationary. Using first differences, at the fourth lag, the null hypothesis of a unit root is clearly rejected at the 5% level, with an ADF statistic of \u22124.67 compared with a critical value of \u22122.90 at the 5% significance level. Thus, the logarithmic tourist arrivals from China to Australia is integrated of order 1, whereas the first difference of the logarithmic tourist arrival series is integrated of order 0, I(0), and hence is stationary. A sensible strategy for estimating reasonably simple autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA p,q) models with values for p and q from 0 to 4 is to start with small p and q and work upwards to larger values. Only models with statistically significant (at 5%) AR and MA coefficients are selected, ensuring that the estimated residuals do not have serial correlation at the 5% level. Twenty-four appropriate ARIMA models have been selected for the logarithms of tourist arrivals from China to Australia. The 'best' model selected is ARIMA(4,1,4) as it has the lowest Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) or ARIMA (4,1,1) with the lowest Schwarz Bayesian Criterion (SBC), namely (with absolute t-ratios in parentheses):",

The aim of this paper is to discuss the development of Chinese outbound tourism in general, and to Australia in particular.

Using Importance-Performance Analysis, the study has also identified Chinese visitors' travel characteristics, lifestyles, and travel benefits sought. Moreover, the perceived importance of, satisfaction with, and actual participation in leisure activities by Chinese travellers were also assessed. The findings of the study, such as most favourable leisure activities and key benefits sought by Chinese leisure tourists, provide some useful information for tourism marketing and management.",
