This review article describes how synthetic biology can deliver on this promise in the field of drug discovery by providing novel opportunities throughout the entire drug discovery process. Synthetic biology tools enable disease mechanisms and target identification to be elucidated and also provide avenues to discover small chemotherapeutic molecules or design novel biopharmaceuticals. Furthermore, synthetic biologists can design cost-effective microbial production processes for complex natural products, which could help overcome global drug shortages. These impressive advances have been achieved in only a few years, and are an indicator for the potential of synthetic biology.",

Since 2000, pioneering work in synthetic biology has led to the construction of living systems displaying complex dynamic behavior, such as synthetic epigenetic imprinting [2, 3] , time-delay functions [4] , oscillating expression patterns [5] [6] [7] [8] as well as synthetic ecosystems emulating the coexistence of different species in the same habitat [9, 10] (for reviews, see [11] [12] [13] ). Along with this 'fundamental synthetic biology,' whose aim is to elucidate and establish design principles for biologic parts, devices and systems, 'translational synthetic biology' [11] may provide solutions to pertinent challenges in biotechnology [14] , agriculture [15] or environmental sciences [16, 17] .",

The speed for rational design and implementation of synthetic devices has significantly increased in recent years because of a combination of advances in (i) gene synthesis technology providing large custom-made DNA sequences at moderate cost and within shorter timelines [23, 24] , (ii) viral and nonviral gene-transfer technologies, enabling straightforward installation of transgenes in different target cells [25, 26] and (iii) model-based evaluation of genetic assemblies, identifying crucial design parameters and simulating device dynamics before experimental implementation. Such progress holds the promise of streamlining and intensifying the drug discovery process chain, as exemplified by studies highlighted in this review article. Target identification can be facilitated by the synthetic reconstruction of signaling pathways, which enables identification of disease-causing elements. Once a target is identified, whole cell screening assays can be designed, using synthetic biology strategies, to allow for a streamlined and integrated drug discovery process. Beyond the discovery of small-molecule-based therapeutics, synthetic biology provides novel opportunities for the design of biologics, for example by constructing bacteriophages with superior anti-infective properties. Synthetic biology can further be used to produce complex plant-derived natural compounds in a microbial host, thereby providing an economic manufacturing processes.",

S2 cells were easily transfectable, with many different vectors enabling the reconstruction of multistep signaling pathways. The isolated investigation of the signaling components permitted novel insights into the signaling network topology, revealing a positive feedback loop resulting in strong amplification of the BCR signal. The allosteric tyrosine kinase Syk binds to and is activated by the phosphorylated BCR immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM). Activated Syk phosphorylates neighboring ITAM, resulting in the binding and activation of more Syk in a positive feedback loop, which thereby triggers the rapid amplification of the BCR signal [27] . In a follow-up study [28] , the same group applied the synthetic reconstruction of BCR signaling in S2 cells to elucidate the molecular basis of a rare form of agammaglobulinemia, a primary immunodeficiency characterized by the early blocking of B cell development. Inducible expression of the IgM BCR complex constituents in S2 cells revealed that a nonsense mutation in Igb prevented the correct association with Iga, thereby inhibiting functional BCR formation [28] .",

            "text": "The investigation of the natural zoonotic virus reservoir in bats was hampered by the fact that it was not possible to propagate bat coronaviruses in cell culture or laboratory animals [29] . Therefore, Becker et al. [29] exchanged the ectodomain of the Spike type I membrane glycoprotein from the bat coronavirus for a synthetic construct harboring mutations found in SARS coronaviruses. The synthetic viruses replicated in murine and primate cells as well as in infected mice, demonstrating that the insertion of the synthetic Spike protein efficiently promoted the cross-species shift in tropism. Moreover, they demonstrated that the chimeric viruses were able to bind to the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) as receptor required for cell entry. This synthetic infec-tious sequence might help predict and directly test pathways that could assist in rapidly recovering and testing newly identified pathogens, hence adapt intervention strategies for future epidemics [29] . Similar to the approach of reconstructing SARS coronaviruses, the sequencing of the 1918 Spanish influenza pandemic virus enabled the synthetic reconstruction of all eight gene segments of the pandemic virus which were fused to the noncoding gene sequences of a closely related H1N1 virus. In contrast to contemporary influenza viruses, the reconstructed virus was able to replicate in the absence of trypsin, was lethal to mice and embryonated chicken eggs and showed a high growth phenotype in human bronchial epithelial cells [31] . Correlating these deadly properties with the mutations observed in the 1918 influenza gene sequence might help to understand the evolution of the virus [32] as well as to characterize its virulence factors to ultimately design preventive vaccinations.",

Mycobacterium tuberculosis is inherently resistant to ethionamide, which must first be activated by M. tuberculosis's Baeyer-Villiger monooxygenase EthA. However, activation tends to be inefficient, because EthA production is repressed at the transcriptional level by the TetR/CamR-type repressor EthR [35] . Therefore, inactivation of EthR was expected to be correlated with increased EthA expression and higher sensitivity of this pathogen to ethionamide [36] . In an attempt to screen for compounds that inactivate EthR but that are not toxic to mammalian cells and can penetrate the mammalian cell membrane to reach the intracellular pathogens, an EthR-based synthetic genetic circuit was designed and engineered into human embryonic kidney cells [34] (Fig. 1) . A chimeric transcription factor was constructed, comprising EthR fused to the VP16 transactivator, which binds the EthR-specific operator O ethR and triggers activation of the downstream minimal promoter, resulting in the expression of the reporter gene SEAP (human placental secreted alkaline phosphatase). This configuration was used to screen a chemical library, and revealed several compounds which inhibit EthR, most of which were not followed up on as viability of the screening cell line was compromised. The small-molecule ester 2-phenylethyl-butyrate met all the above criteria and activated EthA expression in M. tuberculosis and to render this pathogen more sensitive to the antibiotic ethionamide, thereby providing novel therapeutic options for the treatment of tuberculosis [34] .",

Addition of the streptogramin antibiotic prinstinamycin I released PIP from its promoter, thereby de-repressing reporter activation. This system was used for screening a metabolic library of Streptomyces and identified bacterial strains producing compounds active against clinical pathogens, able to penetrate into mammalian cells and that do not show toxic side effects on mammalian cell physiology.

We recently described a synthetic gene network that emulated the emergence of proliferating cancer cells in a nondividing G1-phase cell population [41] . Chinese hamster ovary cells were engineered with a tetracycline-triggered gene network controlling the expression of the cycline-dependent kinase inhibitor p27 Kip1 . In the presence of tetracycline, the tetracycline-dependent transactivator tTA is inactive and p27 Kip1 expression is silent. However, upon tetracycline withdrawal, tTA binds its cognate promoter P TET and drives the transcription of the cycline-dependent kinase inhibitor, triggering a G1-phase-specific growth arrest. However, during conditions of sustained proliferation control individual cells emerged at a precise frequency which had escaped p27 Kip1mediated G1-phase arrest and resumed growth. Such a situation in which proliferation-competent cells appear within a growtharrested terminally differentiated tissue population is reminiscent of the development of cancer. The mixed population of growing and growth-arrested cells was subjected to different clinically licensed cancer therapeutics, followed by scoring the number of growing and growth-arrested cells. It could be shown that cancer therapeutics, including 5-fluorouracil, doxorubicin and etoposide, selectively killed growing cells but did not affect the G1-arrested population. This validates the growth-arrested engineered cells as a cancer model suitable for identifying novel compounds that can selectively kill neoplastic cells [41, 42] .",

In Mycobacterium tuberculosis, ethionamide is converted to a cytotoxic InhA-inhibiting compound by the Baeyer-Villiger monooxygenase EthA.

Screening for antituberculosis compounds is performed by fusing EthR to the transactivator VP16, which activates the minimal promoter P min upon binding of EthR-VP16 to the operator O ethR .

The released DspB loosens the biofilm structure by degrading EPS and the released phages attack neighboring cells, thereby re-initiating the antibacterial cycle. It was shown that the application of DspB-engineered phage reduced bacterial biofilm cell count by 4.5 orders of magnitude, about 2 orders of magnitude higher than that of the wild-type control phage. This indicates that engineered phages might become a viable option in biofilm control in environmental, industrial and clinical settings [45] . Aside from biofilm formation, the increased resistance to antibiotics is a major concern in combating bacterial infections. While previous efforts focused on eliminating drug resistance by using small molecules that inhibited the determinants of resistance [34, 47] , Lu and Collins pioneered the engineering of bacteriophages to target antibiotic resistance mechanisms in E. coli [46] . They constructed an M13-derived phage engineered for the production of LexA3, a repressor of the SOS response system. Upon LexA3-mediated SOS inhibition, bacteria were more susceptible to antibiotics and less prone to develop resistance to antibiotics [48] . Coadministration of the lexA3-engineered phage with the antibiotic ofloxacin resulted in a reduction of viable bacteria by 2.7 orders of magnitude compared with the unmodified phage. It was further demonstrated that lexA3 expression acted in synergy with b-lactam and aminoglycoside antibiotics to kill bacteria and increase the survival of E. coli-infected mice [46] .",

To control chemotaxis, the cheZ gene was fused to a theophylline-responsive aptamer, resulting in theophylline-induced cheZ expression. It could be shown that engineered E. coli follow a theophylline gradient, which opens up the possibility of engineering bacteria to follow gradients of pathologic messengers (e.g. tumor markers) to invade and kill the malignant cells [52] .",

            "text": "Treating a disease is good, preventing it from happening is even better. In recent studies, Luke Alphey's group has described strategies for controlling insects [53] that serve as hosts for human pathogens like Plasmodium falciparum, the causative agent of malaria [54] . With the aim of eradicating specific insect populations, the group developed synthetic gene switches to confer inducible, female-specific, dominant lethality in the Mediterranean fruit fly (Ceratitis capitata), an agricultural pest [15] . In this approach, male flies harboring the engineered transgenes would be released into the environment where they would mate with wild-type females, thereby competing with wild-type males for wild-type females. Female progeny is expected to die, compromising reproduction of this insect pest [55] . To enable efficient breeding of the engineered flies, female-specific lethality must be suppressed in the breeding phase. Therefore, the authors [15] disrupted an insect codon-usage adapted variant of the tetracycline-responsive repressor (tTAV) with an intron, exclusively spliced out in female organisms, to yield in translation-competent tTAV (Fig. 2) . The intron-encoding tTAV was placed under the control of a tTAV-inducible promoter, resulting in a positive feedback loop that triggered high levels of tTAV only in females. This was toxic in the developmental phase probably because of transcriptional squelching effects of the VP16 transactivation domain [56] contained in tTAV which resulted in the killing of all female progeny. In the presence of tetracycline in the insect food, the tTAV-amplifying positive feedback loop was interrupted, yielding female progeny for breeding purposes. Owing to the conservation of the sex-dependent splice mechanism [15] , the authors suggest this procedure might be of more general use in controlling mosquito-transmitted malaria [54] . In fact, the United States Department of Agriculture has decided on May 12, 2009 to include the use of genetically engineered insects in the agency's future plant pest control programs as this approach is considered to minimize potential impacts on human health, nontarget species and environmental quality compared to traditional chemical-based insect control strategies.",

Manufactured by a synthetic biology-based production process, this antimalaria compound is expected to enter the market in 2010 supported by an alliance of the Institute of OneWorld Health, Amyris Biotechnologies and Sanofi Aventis. Also, the use of genetically engineered insects has recently been validated in open field trials and has now obtained positive evaluation by the United States Department Synthetic metabolic pathway in E. coli for the production of artemisinic acid. Four expression units confer the 11 enzymatic steps required to produce artemisinic acid, starting from acetyl-CoA. In the upstream mevalonate pathway imported from S. cerevisiae 3 acetyl-CoA molecules are converted into mevalonate. Mevalonate is further processed to farnesyl pyrophosphate by the downstream part of the imported mevalonate pathway. Farnesyl pyrophosphate is circularized by amorphadiene synthase which is then oxidized to artemisinic acid by an N-terminally engineered and codon-optimized cytochrome P450 monooxygenase derived from Artemisia annua. Artemisinic acid can then further be converted to the pharmaceutically active substance artemisinin by chemical reduction, peroxidation, oxidation and ring closure.",

The clinical validation of synthetic biology-based biopharmaceuticals such as engineered phages or cancer-invading bacteria is imminent and will probably be successful because wildtype phages have already been used to treat bacterial infections [68] and the treatment of cancer patients with attenuated Salmonella was promising [69] . The rapid development of synthetic biology as exemplified by the identification, definition and characterization of biologic parts [18, 19] , the elaboration of computer-based modeling and design principles [21, 22] as well as advances in genome synthesis technology [23, 24, 70] will revolutionize the entire drug discovery process. Assembly of designer networks and reconstruction of synthetic signaling pathways will lead to the identification of novel targets and the development of tailored drugs. However, synthetic biology will impact clinical applications beyond drug discovery because components of synthetic designer circuits [71] were recently adapted for the construction of stimuli-sensing biomaterials that release an embedded therapeutic growth factor in response to a small-molecule drug [72] .",
