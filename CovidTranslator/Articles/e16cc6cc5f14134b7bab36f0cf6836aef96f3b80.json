            "text": "A series of 31 patients with probable SARS, diagnosed from WHO criteria, were treated according to a treatment protocol consisting of antibacterials and a combination of ribavirin and methylprednisolone. Through experience with the first 11 patients, we were able to finalise standard dose regimens, including pulsed methylprednisolone. One patient recovered on antibacterial treatment alone, 17 showed rapid and sustained responses, and 13 achieved improvement with step-up or pulsed methylprednisolone. Four patients required short periods of non-invasive ventilation. No patient required intubation or mechanical ventilation. There was no mortality or treatment morbidity in this series. Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is an emerging infectious disease associated with a novel coronavirus 1 and causing worldwide outbreaks. In two large series, the clinical, laboratory, radiological, and microbiological findings have been analysed. 1,2 Treatment strategies remain diverse and experimental without uniform effectiveness. We describe, from our continuing prospective study, the development of a standard treatment protocol and its preliminary outcome.",

Our case definitions were: fever 38\u040aC or higher at presentation or in the previous 2 days, with or without chills or rigor; influenza-like symptoms; new radiological infiltrates compatible with pneumonia; and contact history. Exclusions were preexisting infective lung disorders, aspiration, or hospitalacquired bacterial pneumonia. All cases fulfilled the WHO criteria for probable SARS cases current at that time. 3 Laboratory investigations included haematological (complete blood counts with differentials and clotting profile), biochemical (electrolytes, liver and renal function, creatine kinase, lactate dehydrogenase), and microbiological tests to exclude other causative pathogens (bacterial cultures of blood, sputum, and urine, serologies by microagglutination for mycoplasma and legionella, serologies by direct immunofluorescence for chlamydia, influenza, parainfluenza, and respiratory syncytial and adenoviruses, nasopharyngeal aspirates for viral cell cultures, and direct sputum smear for Pneumocystis carinii by silver stain). All chest radiographs were semiquantified by separating each lung into six sections (upper, middle, and lower zones and medial and lateral divisions) and scoring them on a four-point scale: 0 clear, 1 subtle haziness or mild infiltrates, 2 ground-glass appearance or prominent infiltrates, and 3 confluent or dense opacities. Three respirologists scored chest radiographs independently, with consensus decided between themselves in case of discordance.",

Two exhaust ventilation fans were installed in each cubicle to achieve negative-pressure airflow. Closed-system suction was used for mechanical ventilators, the tubes of which were fitted with high-efficiency particulate air or similar filters. All health-care workers wore surgical or N-95 masks, protective eye-wear, full-face shields, caps, gowns with full sleeve coverage, surgical gloves, and shoe covers.

Staff washed hands with antiseptic rubs after every contact with patients or contaminated objects and after taking off protective garments. Direct contact of eyes, nose, or mouth with hands before sanitisation was discouraged. Environmental or equipment surfaces were cleaned daily and immediately after use with domestic bleach (1000 ppm hypochlorite solution) for non-metallic items and 70% alcohol for metallic items.

In the later stage, when adaptive immune response is mounted, viral clearance can be accompanied by severe inflammatory damage, especially with high viral burden. 4 An immunomodulating agent, such as a corticosteroid, could reduce tissue damage.

The index case's fatal outcome suggested that late administration of combination treatment was probably ineffective. Patients with heavier bodyweights worsened despite intravenous 30 mg methylprednisolone every 12 h. Correction for bodyweight to 1 mg/kg daily resulted in lowering of fever and radiographic improvement in 1-2 days, but in most patients fever worsened again thereafter. We therefore increased the initial methylprednisolone dose to 3 mg/kg daily, but several severe cases continued to worsen and required pulsed methylprednisolone. Finally, since stepdown of methylprednisolone dose in 2-3 days resulted in rebound of SARS in some patients, each dose level was continued for 5 days.

K Y Yuen and R W H Yung provided microbiological and infection control advice, and L Y C Yam coordinated the whole study. Transient myeloid disorder is a unique self-regressing neoplasia specific to Down's syndrome. The transcription factor GATA1 is needed for normal growth and maturation of erythroid cells and megakaryocytes. Mutations in GATA1 have been reported in acute megakaryoblastic leukaemia in Down's syndrome. We aimed to investigate changes in GATA1 in patients with Down's syndrome and either transient myeloid disorder (n=10) or acute megakaryoblastic leukaemia (n=6). We recorded mutations eliminating exon 2 from GATA1 in all patients with transient myeloid disorder (age 0-24 days) and in all with acute megakaryoblastic leukaemia (age 14-38 months). The range of mutations did not differ between patients with each disorder. Patients with transient myeloid disorder with mutations in GATA1 can regress spontaneously to complete remission, and mutations do not necessarily predict later acute megakaryoblastic leukaemia.",

It could therefore provide valuable insights into cellular mechanisms that could be exploited to control proliferation outside conventional therapeutic approaches. 1, 2 Wechsler and colleagues 4 noted acquired mutations in the erythroid/megakaryocyte lineage-specific transcription factor GATA1 5 in genomic DNA samples from six of six patients with Down's syndrome and acute megakaryoblastic leukaemia, and in none of 92 controls. All mutations were acquired (DNA from remission samples did not have the GATA1 changes) and all resulted in a premature translation termination, eliminating the GATA1 activation domain (encoded by exon 2). 4 Without examination of patients with transient myeloid disorder, we cannot understand if the GATA1 dysfunction is a primary permissive event or a second hit, important for emergence of fully developed leukaemia. Thus, we aimed to investigate GATA1 mutations in tissue samples from patients with Down's syndrome and transient myeloid disorder.",
