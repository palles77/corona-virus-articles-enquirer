            "text": "The severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic continues to affect the world. SARS has been described as a highly contagious disease, and health care workers are the most vulnerable group. So far in Hong Kong, more than 1700 cases of SARS have been reported, with more than 22% of the total affected being health care workers. 1 To prevent cross-infection, 1 of the most effective strategies is the use of personal protective clothing (PPC). [2] [3] [4] PPC in this study refers specifically to gown. In Hong Kong, various PPC types are available (eg, Barrierman, Airmate, Tyvek, surgical gowns), but despite their use, health care workers have still been affected. It is interesting to note that hospitals using traditional PPC such as surgical and plastic aprons have a lower incidence of staff-contracted SARS. 5 Whether the available types of PPC provide full protection against the virus has not yet been determined. However, important in ensuring high PPC performance is the PPC's usability. PPC usability is defined as the level of comfort, ease of use, time taken to put on/take off, and risk of contamination. Optimal usability is crucial in providing protection for health care workers who are exposed to the virus day and night while taking care of SARS patients. No research study has yet tested PPC usability. To this end, a team of academic and clinical investigators designed a study to examine the usability of each PPC type available in Hong Kong.",

Subjects were asked to put on the allocated PPC, and the researcher recorded the time required for put-on. Subjects were then asked to go to laboratory 2 next door and stand in front of a perplex box that exposed the trunk while blocking the remaining parts of the body. The researcher sprayed the exposed part with either fluorescein or water with an atomizer (subjects were blindfolded during this process). Subjects then returned to the first laboratory and took off the PPC, while the researcher recorded the time required for take-off. Subjects were next asked to go to laboratory 3 for a UV scan and to have the stains photographed. Subjects were then asked to remove the stains, if any, by washing with alcohol; afterward, the researcher scanned subjects with UV light to ensure the stains had been removed. Subjects were then asked to repeat the above procedure twice. Upon completion of all 3 trials, subjects were asked to fill out the usability questionnaire.",

For protection, materials used in making PPC should be resistant to absorption and diffusion of liquids, thus preventing the penetration of droplets contaminated with viruses (characterized as water repellency). For comfort, the ideal PPC would be made of highly permeable clothing materials that allow excess body heat to be dispersed by means of air and moisture transfer (characterized as water vapor permeability, thermal resistance, and air permeability). In this paper, we focus on the protective performance and usability of PPC by carrying out a series of tests to characterize their physical properties, including water repellency and wettability, liquid penetration, and air permeability.",

These results show that the traditional surgical gown is wettable and absorbs liquid contaminated with viruses, whereas other PPC gowns can resist the absorption of liquid contaminated with viruses.

Though it had a middle-range usability score, Type A PPC had the shortest take-off time and comparatively minimal contamination overall (Tables  3 and 4 ). Twenty-two subjects participated in the viral load test. In this stage, each subject was asked to put on a Type A PPC, then received 2 splashes (ie, 2 strokes) of 3.68 mL of diluted stain, sprayed from the nozzle at the trunk from a distance of 18 inches. Subjects took off the PPC, and fluorescent stains were counted. The mean number of spots of contamination over the face, neck, trunk, dorsum, and palm were 0.6 (SD = 1.12), 0.47 (SD = 1.81), 0.4 (SD = 1.12), 0.4 (SD = 0.74), 0.6 (SD = 1.24), respectively.

This is a complicated procedure as compared with a conventional gown (ie, tie at the back, without hood and trousers). Contamination did not differ significantly for the face and neck. However, the trunk was more heavily contaminated in Type C PPC. This may be because of the fabrics used (ie, poor water repellency and poor water resistance). Type B PPC offers poor resistance; thus, with a splash of solution, the fluid actually goes from the outer layer of the fabric to the inner layer. As a result, stains were found on the trunk. However, the research team does not exclude the possibility of contamination, though minimal, during take-off. Both the dorsum and the palm were heavily contaminated as compared with the other regions. This can be explained by the fact that participants used their hands to take off the PPC. However, the significantly high contamination in Types B and D PPC may reflect the design and materials used. Undoubtedly, the results of this study also provide good evidence for the need to thoroughly wash hands, especially the palms, to prevent the spread of infection. [9] [10] [11] [12] The higher viral load did not demonstrate significantly different results in all aspects. This may be because of the feeling of weight over the front of the gown (the weight increased from 1.92 g [with 1 stroke] to 3.68 g [with 2 strokes]). Therefore, participants degowned with extra care. However, it is important to highlight that contamination of the trunk increases. Whether or not this is because of the high volume of splash with 2 strokes has yet to be determined.",

All PPC is similar with respect to face and neck contamination, except for Type D (for which there was no contamination at the neck). For the dorsum and palm contamination, Types B and D PPC were worse than Types A and C. Thus, either Type A or Type C would be preferable. However, when we examined contamination over the trunk, results showed that Type C PPC was much worse than Type A (Table 4 ). Data on air permeability (Table 1) suggest that Type A may be best if the PPC is to be disposable and is used for high-risk procedures. On the other hand, Type C may be the better choice for its cost-effectiveness (it can be disinfected and washed), but it is not recommended for procedures at high risk for splash.",

The cost is low, air permeability is fair, and the level of hand contamination is lowest among the 4 groups in the current study.
