            "text": "SARS-CoV resembles to members of the three previously known groups of coronavirus and was classified as a member of group 2b in the family Coronaviridae based on phylogenetic analysis of genome sequences [6, 7] . The SARS-CoV virion contains a singlestranded 29,700-nt RNA genome of positive polarity. The first two-thirds of the genome encode two overlapping polyproteins, ORF1a and ORF1b. Like other coronaviruses, these two polyproteins are processed into 16 mature replicase proteins by viral specific proteinases and most of them are believed to associate with a poorly characterized replication/transcription complex that mediates the synthesis of genome RNA (replication) and subgenomic mRNAs (transcription) [7] [8] [9] [10] . Recently, the functions of several non-structural proteins (nsps) have been determined, including a non-canonical RdRp (nsp8), a single-stranded RNA-binding protein (nsp9), a RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (nsp12), a superfamily 1-like helicase (nsp13), a 3 0 ? 5 0 exonuclease (nsp14), a uridylate-specific endoribonuclease (nsp15), and a 2 0 -O-ribose methyltransferase activities (nsp16) [11] [12] [13] [14] . The complicated interactions network among these nsps makes it difficult, if not impossible, to fully understand their functions [15, 16] . The rest of 3 0 end genome codes for four main structural proteins, the spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N) proteins. The S protein, which mediates both cell attachment and membrane fusion, is responsible for virus host range and tissue tropism. Proteins E, M, N can assemble into non-infectious virus like particles (VLPs) in the absence of S [17] . Besides the nsps and major structural proteins, SARS-CoV possesses several group-specific proteins and their functions during virus life cycle remain elusive and deletion of genes for those proteins seems to have no effect virus replication and/or transcription [18] . Recent studies on these group-specific proteins revealed that some of them may be associated with virus pathogenesis and virus-host interaction [19] [20] [21] [22] .",

            "text": "SARS-CoV resembles to members of the three previously known groups of coronavirus and was classified as a member of group 2b in the family Coronaviridae based on phylogenetic analysis of genome sequences [6, 7] . The SARS-CoV virion contains a singlestranded 29,700-nt RNA genome of positive polarity. The first two-thirds of the genome encode two overlapping polyproteins, ORF1a and ORF1b. Like other coronaviruses, these two polyproteins are processed into 16 mature replicase proteins by viral specific proteinases and most of them are believed to associate with a poorly characterized replication/transcription complex that mediates the synthesis of genome RNA (replication) and subgenomic mRNAs (transcription) [7] [8] [9] [10] . Recently, the functions of several non-structural proteins (nsps) have been determined, including a non-canonical RdRp (nsp8), a single-stranded RNA-binding protein (nsp9), a RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (nsp12), a superfamily 1-like helicase (nsp13), a 3 0 ? 5 0 exonuclease (nsp14), a uridylate-specific endoribonuclease (nsp15), and a 2 0 -O-ribose methyltransferase activities (nsp16) [11] [12] [13] [14] . The complicated interactions network among these nsps makes it difficult, if not impossible, to fully understand their functions [15, 16] . The rest of 3 0 end genome codes for four main structural proteins, the spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N) proteins. The S protein, which mediates both cell attachment and membrane fusion, is responsible for virus host range and tissue tropism. Proteins E, M, N can assemble into non-infectious virus like particles (VLPs) in the absence of S [17] . Besides the nsps and major structural proteins, SARS-CoV possesses several group-specific proteins and their functions during virus life cycle remain elusive and deletion of genes for those proteins seems to have no effect virus replication and/or transcription [18] . Recent studies on these group-specific proteins revealed that some of them may be associated with virus pathogenesis and virus-host interaction [19] [20] [21] [22] .",

For in-depth study of functions of different viral proteins and regulatory sequence elements by reverse genetics, full-length infectious cDNA clones have been established using various techniques including bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) vector [23] [24] [25] and SARS-CoV replicon cell lines [26] , which can also be used for antiviral drug screening. Among them, the SARS-CoV replicon cell lines which retain the genes necessary for replication and transcription represent the safest system available. However, these cell lines need to be continuously selected with antibiotics and is not readily amenable to introduction of mutations in different protein coding genes. Here, we report the construction of a plasmidbased replicon system which can be introduced into cells by transfection and can be easily manipulated for introduction of mutations. The usefulness of this replicon was demonstrated by its application in testing known antiviral drugs and in confirming the essential function of nsp16 in virus replication.",

SYBR Green Real-time PCR Master Mix (Toyobo) was mixed with forward and reverse primers (0.4 lM each) in a final PCR mixture of 25 ll. The thermal cycling conditions were as follows: 1 cycle at 95\u00b0C for 1 min, followed by 40 cycles of 95\u00b0C for 15 s, 55\u00b0C for 20 s, 72\u00b0C for 20 s, 80\u00b0C for 3 s. Fluorescence was measured after each cycle. A melting curve was generated after the last extension step from 55\u00b0C to 95\u00b0C. The experiment was repeated three times and the data represent the means of triplicates.",

The eGFP gene was cloned under the control of the S gene TRS, retained the sequence of S gene at 5 0 and 3 0 end (30 and 102 nt, respectively). It is expected that the replicon can express most SARS-CoV ORFs at the same level as the original infectious cDNA clone.

The results showed a significant reduction in fluorescence in the cells at 60 h after treatment with 0.4 mg/ml E-64D. (Fig. 2A,  right panel) . However, cells treated with ribavirin, a widely used broad-spectrum replicase inhibitor, did not have obvious effect on the fluorescence signal compared with those of the untreated cells ( Fig. 2A, middle panel) . It is worth noting that no obvious cytotoxic effect was observed for either ribavirin or E-64D at the concentrations used in this study. Quantitative real-time RT-PCR was used to evaluate the inhibition of SARS-CoV N gene messenger RNA production. The N gene copy number was reduced by more than 2 logarithmic units after treatment with 0.4 mg/ml E-64D (Fig. 2C) , indicating an efficient inhibition of SARS-CoV replication. In contrast, the mRNA level for the house keeping gene from both treated and untreated cells remained at a similar level. While the fluorescence intensity detected by microscope showed no significant difference between control and ribavirin treated cells, real-time RT-PCR revealed that ribavirin might have a small, but invisible, inhibitory effect on SARS-CoV replication.",

In previous studies, nsp16, but not nsp1 and nsp2, was reported to be required for virus replication [27, 28] . In this study, we constructed three recombinant variants to test whether the same conclusion could be obtained using this new replicon system, the first one with a deletion in the junction domain between nsp1 and nsp2 genes (pBAC-SARS-CoV-DEDSDnsp1-2J/eGFP), the second one with a deletion within nsp2 N-terminus (pBAC-SARS-CoV-DEDSDnsp2N/eGFP), and a third in which nsp16 was deleted (pBAC-SARS-CoV-DEDSDnsp16/eGFP) (see Materials and methods). The results presented in Fig. 3 indicate that fluorescence intensity did not change for the first two deletion constructs compared with the original replicon, but there was a sharp reduction for the third construct with the nsp16 deletion. This was further confirmed by real-time RT-PCR evaluation of the N gene transcript, which revealed a reduction of close to 3 logs (Fig. 3B) .",

The deletion of S gene allows the manipulation of the replicon in a conventional laboratory instead of using a BSL3 facility. Our results indicated that the replicon could transcribe and express heterogeneous genes in vitro and can be used for antiviral drug screening and analysis of viral protein functions. Moreover, our newly constructed replicon is a stable BAC system and can be easily amplified in E. coli and manipulated by reverse genetics. As indicated in the results, it will be possible to insert any mutation in this replicon for gene function analysis.",

Even though the pathogenesis of bat SL-CoVs in human is unknown, there is a high potential of other related CoVs of bat origin to infect and cause diseases in human.
