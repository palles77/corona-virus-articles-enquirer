In this retrospective study, we attempt to summarize and analyze the chest CT features of 2019-nCov infections, and to identify the typical features to improved the diagnostic accuracy of new coronavirus pneumonia (NCP). Methods:Chest CT scans and Clinical data of 21 patients confirmed NCP in our hospital were enrolled.These patients were divided into mild and sever group according to clinical manifestations described by the 6th clinical practice guideline of NCP in China. Main clinical and chest CT features were analyzed and identify. Results: Fever (85.7%) and cough (80.9%) were the two main symptoms of NCP patients.More significantly higher incidence (85.7%) of shortness of breath in the severe cases. Multiple lesions in both lungs and with incidence of GGO(100%),vascular enlargement (76.5%) and cobblestone/reticular pattern(70.6%) were the major feature.The incidence of consolidation, mixed pattern and vascular enlargement features were up to 100% in the severe group, significantly higher than that of patients in mild group. In addition, the incidence of air-bronchogram, dilated bronchi with thickened wall and fibrosis in the severe group was significantly higher than that in the mild group. Conclusions: Fever and cough are the typical clinical features of NCP patients, and chest CT mainly manifested as multiple lesions in both lungs, often accompanied by GGO, vascular enlargement and cobblestone/reticular pattern.Changes in these main CT features can indicate development of the disease Keywords: 2019-nCov; New coronavirus pneumonia; Chest CT; Ground glass opacification",

Initially confined to Wuhan, the infection has spread elsewhere, sporadic cases exported from Wuhan were reported in many foreign countries.On January 30, the WHO Director-General declared that the 2019-nCov outbreak constitutes a Public Health Emergency of International Concern [2] . So far, the outbreak is still on-going, the number of reported cases of 2019-nCov infection continue to increase.Several relevant literatures estimated the transmissibility of 2019-nCoV, the mean estimate of R0 for the new coronavirus pneumonia (NCP) ranges from 1.4 to 3.58 [3, 4] . As of 18 February 2020, NCP has caused 73400 confirmed cases including 1870 deaths, 6242 suspected cases, and 12734 cured cases in mainland released by the National Health Commission of China. Now Japan has become the second most affected country with 519 confirmed cases, and followed by Singapore with 77 confirmed cases. Person-to-person transmission of NCP has been confirmed and with several ways of transmission, moreover the asymptomatic individual is identified as a potential source of infection. Fever and cough were reported as main clinical manifestations of NCP patients [5] . Based on the clinical observations and summary, the main diagnostic criteria [6] of 2019-nCov infections are : 1) Contact history of the epidemic area and related patients; 2) Nucleic acid is positive; 3) Fever, cough, shortness of breath and other clinical symptoms; 4) Laboratory examination showed that white blood cells were normal or decreased and lymphocytes decreased; 5) Lung lesions. Especially,the 1th and 2th standards were the most important for 2019-nCov infected confirm. However, in the diagnosis and treatment process, it was found that the above diagnostic criteria could not fully meet the needs of clinical prevention and control, and some atypical clinical manifestations appeared [5, 7, 8] , which brought great difficulties and challenges to the prevention and control of the epidemic.",

In addition, some patients do not have typical symptoms of fever and cough, and there may be basic lesions or complex infections that lead to the lack of changes in the number of typical white blood cells and lymphocytes, which all increase the difficulty of clinical diagnosis. At present, nucleic acid detection was still as gold standard to confirmed NCP, but the sensitivity and specificity of NCP was not evaluated [10] .According to current clinical observation, the positive rate is only 30%-50%. It has been found that patients with high clinical suspicion still have negative viral nucleic acid test for 2 times, while chest CT has displayed obvious lesions [11] . Unlucky, at the beginning, these patients failed to timely and effectively prevent and control due to negative nucleic acid test, leading to the expansion of the infection. CT diagnosis specificity is not as good as nucleic acid, but its sensitivity is significantly higher than nucleic acid. Therefore, to fight the epidemic front in Wuhan, doctor Zhang urgently called for \" NPC diagnosis should not blindly believe in nucleic acid testing, chest CT findings should take as the main diagnostic basis\".

A new study revealed that the reproductive number of COVID-19 is up to 3.28 [3] . However, in this study, the patients did not be acquired a clear transmission route, because the virus may have multiple transmission modes [12, 13] . Previous study demonstrated that common symptoms at onset of the illness were fever, cough and shortness of breath and with less common symptoms were sputum production, headache and diarrhoea etc [4, 5, 7, 12, 13] . Our results revealed that main symptom of NCP patients manifested as fever (85.7%), cough (80.9%), followed by shortness of breath(42.9%)and fatigue(28.6%),diarrhea and muscle pain,which was consistent with previous studies.However,a large clinical cases(1099 cases) study by professor zhong et al [7] found that only 43.8% showed fever in the early stage, but up to 87.9% showed fever after hospitalization.It dmonstrated that fever is closely related to the development of the disease, therefore fever as a screening indicator may miss a large number of early patients. In addition,our study and all previous showed that diarrhea was rare, and we found that diarrhea only occurred in serve patients. Therefore, it is necessary to pay attention to the damage of digestive tract function in these patients and be alert to the risk of fecal-oral infection. 85.7% of severe cases manifested shortness of breath, were significant higher than that of mild cases. Shortness of breath would be a better indicators to reflect the disease's progression. A new study [12] base on 72314 patients revealed that middle-aged(30-79 years old) and elderly men (51.4%) were prone to the NCP,and looking at the sex ratio, men are more likely to die (2.8%) than women (1.7%). our results showed NCP patients with average 43.1 years old, and men are more likely to be worse(57.1%), showed similar characteristics.",

In addition, some scholars believe that virus particles are extremely small (2019-nCov is about 120nm), which can directly enter the distal alveoli with respiration. In this study, CT features of NCP patients mainly displayed GGO (100%), vascular enlargement sign (76.5%) and cobblestone/reticular pattern (70.6%), as followed by consolidation and mixed pattern (GGO and consolidation) with about 52.9%. While mediastinal lymph nodes and pleural effusion were rare, which was basically consistent with literature reports [14, 15] .In general, the lung characteristics of NCP patients were mainly associated with pulmonary interstitial inflammation, which was similar to Middle East respiratory syndrome(MERS) [18] and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome(SARS) [19] caused by coronavirus. In fact, the pathological characteristics of NCP were confirmed to be similar to SARS and MERS [20] Previous reports revealed that GGO as the key CT feature.It can exists for a long time throughout the course of the disease, and may be unique CT feature in some early patients [15, 16] . In the recent study, GGO feature was observed in all NCP patients. Pathological basis of GGO is mainly diffuse alveolar injury, accompanied by cell fibromyxoid exudate,and lung transparent membrane formation. GGO at the early stage could be completely absorbed and improved after effective treatment [21] . With the development of the disease, the interlobular septa thickened on the basis of GGO, and showed typical cobblestone/reticular pattern,and when increased exudation in the alveoli and alveolar collapse resulted in consolidation. Compared with the mild group patients, the incidence of consolidation, mixed pattern, air-bronchogram, dilated bronchi with thickened wall and fibrosis significantly increased in severe patients. In addition, cobblestone/reticular pattern and vascular enlargement sign were both common findings in severe patients without significant different. It is suggested that the changes of pulmonary imaging characteristics can effectively reflect the changes of lung tissue and functional injury.Vascular enlargement in or around the lesions were considered to be an important features for NCP diagnosis,76.5% patients in our study presented this features. This may be due to inflammatory vascular congestion, or to thickening or fluid buildup in the perivascular interstitium [20] . Additionally,all these findings suggest the presence of fibrosis, which also presented commonly in patients underwent SARS and MERS.In this study, consolidation and mixed manifestations were observed in 52.9% of NCP patients, and the incidence rate was up to 100% in severe patients. Combined with previous literature results, lung tissue appeared multiple consolidation with the aggravation of the disease. That's the main difference from MERS [18] . 6 patients (85.7%) in serve group displayed 4-5 lobes were involved simultaneously, which was significantly higher than that in the mild group (60% ).Our result demonstrated that almost all lobes involvement exists in severe patients, which well explains the pathologic basis for the high incidence of dyspepsia. It was found that CT can not only detect early and diagnose NCP accurately, All rights reserved.
