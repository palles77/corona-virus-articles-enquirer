We used comparable cross-national data sources to document mortality trends from 1990 to 2008 and to assess major causes of maternal and child deaths. We present inequalities in intervention coverage by two common measures of wealth quintiles and rural or urban status. Case studies of reduction in mortality in Thailand and Indonesia indicate the varying extents of success and point to some factors that accelerate progress. We developed a Lives Saved Tool analysis for the region and for country subgroups to estimate deaths averted by cause and intervention. We identifi ed three major patterns of maternal and child mortality reduction: early, rapid downward trends (Brunei, Singapore, Malaysia, and Thailand); initially high declines (sustained by Vietnam but faltering in the Philippines and Indonesia); and high initial rates with a downward trend (Laos, Cambodia, and Myanmar). Economic development seems to provide an important context that should be coupled with broader health-system interventions. Increasing coverage and consideration of the health-system context is needed, and regional support from the Association of Southeast Asian Nations can provide increased policy support to achieve maternal, neonatal, and child health goals.",

Of the ten countries in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), only three have infant and child mortality rates below ten per 1000 livebirths-Brunei, Singapore, and Malaysia. Infant and under-5 mortality in Thailand and Vietnam have declined substantially to below 15 per 1000 livebirths within the past two decades, but the Philippines and Indonesia have seen a levelling off in rates to between 30 and 50 per 1000 livebirths. Myanmar, Cambodia, and Laos still have mortality levels of 50-70 per 1000 livebirths in 2008, which are similar to the rates of their neighbours from more than two decades ago, and rank among the highest for Asia. 1 The UN estimates that every year about 350 000 women die as a result of pregnancy or childbirth, 2 as do nearly 9 million children younger than 5 years. 3 Worldwide, in 2008, about 18 000 maternal 2 and 400 000 child 3 deaths were in southeast Asia. Laos and Cambodia are among seven countries with the highest maternal mortality ratios outside of sub-Saharan Africa, and Indonesia is one of 11 countries that account for 65% of all maternal deaths worldwide. 2 Although southeast Asia as a region might achieve the reductions in child mortality set by the UN Millennium Development Goal 4 (MDG4), Cambodia and Myanmar have been rated as having insuffi cient progress. 4 Declines in mortality rates in Indonesia, Laos, and the Philippines are also faltering. Similarly, although all countries in the region are reporting declines in maternal deaths (towards MDG5), the rates of decline for Indonesia, the Philippines, and Myanmar have notably slowed.",

We fi rst report on patterns of mortality reduction within southeast Asia and major causes of maternal and child deaths in the context of MDG4 and MDG5. We investigate two country cases to highlight the notable variations in mortality reduction. Finally, we use an analysis of the deaths that could be averted through expanded coverage to identify more eff ective approaches for improving maternal, neonatal, and child health in southeast Asia.",

We also reviewed estimates from international data sources from UNICEF, WHO, and the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (webappendix pp 1-2). We present country-specifi c estimates on maternal, neonatal, and under-5 mortality rates from recent UN MDG reports, 2,3 as these estimates enable cross-country comparisons on trends in mortality using replicable estimation methods that reduce sources of non-sampling error. These estimates tend to be more conservative in the rate of decline than estimates from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation. On the basis of increasing awareness of the burden of neonatal mortality, we sought comparable estimates of trends that separated neonatal (death within the fi rst 28 days after birth) and postneonatal (death between 28 days and 1 year after birth) mortality. As UN models do not have neonatal time trends for all countries in the region, we report estimates from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation. 11 We report estimates on causes of neonatal and child deaths on the basis of standardised methods for estimating the distribution of causes of child deaths. 12 We compiled estimates of causes of maternal deaths from Countdown 2015 country reports 4 and WHO. 13 We evaluated data from the Demographic and Health Surveys 14 and Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys 15,16 to assess existing intervention coverage within the region, with these data sources providing the ability to disaggregate coverage estimates by wealth quintile and rural or urban status [17] [18] [19] [20] to establish the country average of coverage and to assess the programme coverage in disadvantaged populations by economic status and geography.

Values for the eff ectiveness of interventions were developed through a standardised review process using established criteria to identify which interventions to include on the basis of levels of evidence. 31 The analysis was done for all ten countries and then for three subgroups of countries on the basis of observed patterns of mortality reduction: subgroup 1 (Brunei, Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand); subgroup 2 (the Philippines, Indonesia, Vietnam); and subgroup 3 (Laos, Cambodia, Myanmar).

Although starting with comparably lower baseline mortality levels in 1990, rates of decline in the Philippines and Indonesia were not suffi ciently accelerated since the development of the MDGs. Reductions in infant mortality in Brunei and Singapore stem from larger proportions of decline in neonatal deaths, a pattern similar to other high-income countries. 34 Other than Brunei and Singapore, the slower rates of decline for neonatal mortality for the other eight of the ten ASEAN countries is a cause for concern. Interventions for reducing neonatal mortality are more closely linked to maternal interventions in terms of policy and programme implementation and might not be as noticeably tracked towards their eff ect on under-5 mortality.

Neonatal problems, such as preterm complications, contributed to about 40% of child mortality, accounting for the single largest proportion of preventable deaths, even as several ASEAN countries are successfully reducing their postneonatal and child mortality burdens.

In Cambodia, vaccination levels for the wealthiest quintile are similar to those of the other southeast Asia countries, matching those of Indonesia's highest quintile. However, the coverage in the poorest households in Cambodia is almost 40% lower than that for the wealthiest households, resulting in a large equity gap in immunisation levels. The countries shown in the fi gures in webappendix pp 13-15 indicate relatively low coverage of skilled birth attendance (except Thailand and Vietnam) with inequality particularly acute in the Philippines, Laos, and Cambodia. Diff erences in skilled birth attendance between urban and rural Laotian populations are the largest among the six countries included in this comparison. Skilled birth attendance could be viewed as one indicator of broader health-system development, and the generally low coverage coupled with a high extent of inequality highlights the need for more comprehensive and coordinated health system improvements in the region overall. 5 These patterns also point to the necessity of targeting the most vulnerable populations and maintaining attention to equity while increasing programme coverage. 35",

[36] [37] [38] At the time of Alma-Ata in 1978, Thailand's maternal mortality ratio was already below 200 and continued to drop even further in the 1980s as the economy improved and a health-care insurance programme for low-income populations was introduced along with specifi c safe motherhood interventions. Another round of health-system reforms and maternal, neonatal, and child health interventions were introduced in the early 2000s, including universal health coverage.",

The systematic deployment of community-based health personnel took place in Indonesia 41 about a decade later than in Thailand in the 1970s. Major, targeted, safe motherhood initiatives were introduced in the late 1980s, but by that time the maternal mortality ratio of Indonesia was about nine times higher than that of Thailand (webappendix pp 16-17). 14,22 A village midwife programme was implemented between 1989 and 1996, but the comparatively rapid training and deployment of 54 000 village midwives might have compromised quality of care. 41 Access to care in Indonesia varies by rural or urban geography, income, and level of education. Unlike in Thailand, where the provision of skilled birth attendants was followed by increased facility and referral level capacities, in Indonesia not all health centres can provide basic obstetric care. About 40% of district hospitals do not have an obstetrician, 41 indicating limited provision of the 24-h continuum of care necessary for dealing with emergency situations.

Improvements in the fi rst three countries seem to be attributable to socioeconomic progress and a consistent policy focus on maternal and child health programmes and coordinated health-system components, [49] [50] [51] notably a stable and strategically deployed health workforce coupled with supportive fi nance mechanisms in Malaysia and Thailand. The importance of favourable health systems is highlighted by the case study in Thailand, which indicates that mortality reductions have taken place at modest levels of economic growth and that no single factor or intervention could account for these reductions. The case study in Indonesia indicates how similar interventions used in a setting with diff erent system capacities and geopolitical features can result in diff erent outcomes. Thus, although the LiST analysis can estimate the potential eff ect of interventions given with maximum levels of coverage, the case studies caution us that improving health outcomes is not just about increasing the amount of money spent on health. Instead, targeted and sustained interventions to reduce the barriers that prevent the most vulnerable population groups from accessing the interventions they crucially need should be ensured in the long term. For example, the LiST analysis indicates that providing basic and comprehensive emergency obstetric care has the potential to avert half of all maternal deaths and about one in six neonatal deaths in Laos, Cambodia, and Myanmar. However, prevention of these deaths might be possible only if care coverage is rapidly expanded in low-income and rural populations, possibly through sustained donor investments, given the low levels of domestic health spending. In the Philippines and Indonesia, the two most populous countries in the region, regaining momentum in mortality reduction alongside substantial geographic and cultural access challenges might mean improving access to services through more equitable fi nancing schemes. 47 Despite the varying agendas that countries of the region might need to adopt to complete the unfi nished maternal, neonatal, and child health agenda, our fi ndings indicate important areas of common ground. Many key interventions to reduce child deaths have been implemented at the community level throughout southeast Asia, but necessary health-service investments that will enable the countries of the region to reduce maternal and neonatal deaths have yet to be fully considered. Access to safe abortion services and management of hypertensive disorders during pregnancy will prevent maternal deaths from these causes from Brunei to Myanmar. Similarly, all countries in the region recognise space for expanding coverage of crucial neonatal interventions to prevent preterm births and neonatal deaths from infection.",

We have used estimates of mortality reduction from UN agencies that might not match national estimates and that use diff erent methods; however, these estimates are preferred for cross-country analysis. These estimates for southeast Asia are still mainly derived from household surveys and subject to potential error from under-reporting and misclassifi cation of deaths. Only fi ve of the ten countries discussed have vital registration systems, and not all these systems have valid registration of causes of death. 2 There is an acute need for better data in Laos and Myanmar, particularly on maternal mortality, but the pioneering work in maternal death audits in Malaysia provides a potential model for the region. 52 The selection of data sources was mainly aff ected by the availability of comparable, reliable data across all the ASEAN countries. For example, although we used the more inclusive gross national income per capita for webappendix pp 9-11, this measurement was not consistently available for the case studies, hence the use of gross domestic product for Thailand and Indonesia.",

            "text": "Given the economic vigour of ASEAN, regional cooperation in health might be key to motivating lessdeveloped members to focus on maternal, neonatal, and child health. The pivotal role of ASEAN in stimulating and channelling international fi nancial aid to tsunami-devastated Indonesia in 2004 and cyclonestricken Myanmar in 2008 testifi es to the power of this promise-the goodwill and experience of working with each other in disaster situations can be harnessed for the health and wellbeing of mothers and children in the region. 54, 55 But how should this aid be used? The experience of the ASEAN, as discussed in this paper, suggests that eff ective interventions to curb maternal and child mortality need to be deployed to actively target the disadvantaged populations who are most aff ected by unsafe abortion, hypertensive diseases, postpartum haemorrhage, pneumonia, sepsis, and birth asphyxia. Far from expecting coverage of these programmes to passively diff use to the very poor, governments must innovatively combine health interventions with non-health programmes such as micro-fi nance schemes and conditional cash transfer mechanisms that have proven successful in other settings. 56, 57 Achievement of the MDGs worldwide will not happen without individual country eff orts. As the donor community focuses its attention on the burdens of Africa and south Asia, ASEAN countries must provide support to each other. Examples of such support mechanisms already in place include fi nancial cooperation through the ASEAN surveillance process, which is an early warning system to keep track of macroeconomic trends and to provide early detection of any adverse development. For public health, the ASEAN SARS Containment Information Network exemplifi es how member countries share essential information, best practices, and new fi ndings for severe acute respiratory syndrome. However, ASEAN has yet to develop initiatives for maternal, neonatal, and child health, which could be developed through sharing information and best practices (possibly starting by resolving the absence of comparable data across countries); fi nancial cooperation eff orts could be linked to outcomes, and the attainment of MDGs for member countries behind target could be made an ASEAN priority.",
