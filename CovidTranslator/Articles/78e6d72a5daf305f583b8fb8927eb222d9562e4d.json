Techniques for estimating R 0 , either from incidence data or in-host clinical measures, often rely on estimates of mean transition times, that is, the mean time before recovery, death or quarantine occurs. In many cases, however, either data or intuition may provide additional information about the dispersal of these transition times about the mean, even if the precise form of the underlying probability distribution remains unknown. For example, we may know that recovery typically occurs within a few days of the mean recovery time. In this paper we elucidate common situations in which R 0 is sensitive to the dispersal of transition times about their respective means. We then provide simple correction factors that may be applied to improve estimates of R 0 when not only the mean but also the standard deviation of transition times out of the infectious state can be estimated. r",

Defined as the number of secondary infections caused by a single infectious individual in a susceptible population, R 0 is used to gauge the magnitude of the risk associated with a novel pathogen, and to estimate the degree of control that will be necessary to contain an outbreak. For example, in the last several years R 0 has been a key factor in our understanding of emerging diseases such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) (Choi and Pak, 2003; Lipsitch et al., 2003; Lloyd-Smith et al., 2003; Riley et al., 2003) and avian influenza (Stegeman et al., 2004; Ferguson et al., 2005; Longini et al., 2005) , livestock diseases such as Bovine Spongiform Encephalitus (Woolhouse and Anderson, 1997; Ferguson et al., 1999; de Koeijer et al., 2004) and",

We thus consider a large number of processes such as natural death, death due to disease, recovery and removal to quarantine, or for in-host models, loss of infected cells due to natural death, lysis, immune-mediated cell death, etc. The probability distributions of other parameters, such as infectivity, are also critical to disease dynamics (Nelson et al., 2004; Lloyd, 2001c) and we hope to address such issues in future work.",

If neither competing process is distributed exponentially, simple approximations are only possible when the two processes have roughly the same shape, although their means may of course differ (second row). The bold entries in the table give even simpler results for the case when the two competing processes have similar means. In the limiting case when the processes have similar means and similar shapes, we see that the correction factor approaches 2 as the shapes of the distributions narrow.",

For an SEIR model, a slightly different correction factor can be easily derived for transitions into the infected state from the exposed state. Likewise for a virus or other types of in-host pathogens, the transition from one infected state to another may involve transitions both out of and into an infected state. For example, in the in-host model of HIV, the infection of a cell is a transition out of the infectious state for a virion, but it also represents a transition into the infected state for an infected cell. These situations suggest clear avenues for future work. In future we also hope to relax the assumption that the transmissibility of the disease is constant throughout the infectious period.",

(22)) when the distribution of cell lifetimes is exponential (dashed line) or approximately Gaussian (solid line). In both cases the area under the curve is the same, and thus R 0 does not change. When lifetimes are Gaussian-distributed, however, the infected cells bud the same number of virions in a shorter period of time, thus increasing the initial growth rate (Fig. 2(b) ). In this case, the conventional set of differential equations (1) allows us to obtain the correct value for the basic reproductive ratio, but does not model the initial growth rate or subsequent dynamics accurately. The area under each curve is the same i.e. R 0 is the same, but r 0 changes. Parameters values are the same as in Fig. 2. Like the infected equilibrium, r 0 can be determined from disease data for many infectious pathogens, and this value can be used to determine R 0 (see Hethcote and Tudor, 1980; Nowak and May, 2000; Lipsitch et al., 2003; Lloyd, 2001a-c for examples) .

(23) thus implies that new infections at time t are produced by new infections at time t \u00c0 s which are still infectious s time units later. The d\u00f0t\u00de term is a Dirac delta function, and is necessary because we wish to determine r 0 after the instantaneous input of one infectious individual at time 0. Conveniently, Eq. (23) is in the form of a convolution integral, which lends itself to solution by a Laplace transform. Taking the Laplace transform of both sides we obtain Y \u00f0o\u00de \u00bc Y \u00f0o\u00deF \u00f0o\u00de \u00fe 1, where F \u00f0o\u00de and Y \u00f0o\u00de denote the Laplace transforms of b\u00f0s\u00def \u00f0s\u00de and y\u00f0t\u00de, respectively. Isolating Y \u00f0o\u00de and taking the inverse Laplace transform we find that",
