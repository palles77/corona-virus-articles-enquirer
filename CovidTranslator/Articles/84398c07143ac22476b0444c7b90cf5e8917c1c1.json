These peaks are clearly related not only to the size of local populations but also to the disease reproduction number, which tells the mean number of secondary cases that are expected from an initial case in a susceptible population 2 . For public health stakeholders and their local surveillance teams to prepare mitigating strategies, an assessment of basic reproduction numbers can be quite helpful. Reproduction number estimates of COVID-19 have varied in different localities within ranges from 1.4 to 3.9 3-5 , with epidemic doubling time estimated at 6.4 days by Wu et al. 3 and 7.4 days by Li et al. 4 Clearly, peaks will also depend on eventual awareness of the local populations, prevention measures on surveillance and interventions taking place.",

Beyond this peak, the daily count of number of cases is expected to reduce, notwithstanding eventual adverse conditions causing ephemeral rebounds. Therefore, once an epidemic is already established, the first aim should be on reducing epidemic peaks. This will reduce the burden placed on health systems, which will permit proper treatment and care for the affected population.",

In fact, infectious disease outbreaks eventually start to slow down because the number of susceptible individuals decreases. Therefore, an option would be to implement interventions to more effectively protect susceptible individuals. Ideally, such efforts would involve vaccination, which is not yet a real possibility at this moment for controlling the spread of SARS-Cov-2.",

Hence, another possibility is to apply interventions that reduce the time for virus clearance in infected people, decreasing transmission risk and, as a consequence, also decreasing the number of infected people. Such interventions for COVID-19 would require treatment as usually done for severe acute respiratory illnesses but problems still remain. First, there is potential transmission during virus incubation period, i.e., transmission before onset of symptoms when people typically will not enter treatment regimen, and the mean incubation period has been estimated at 5.2 days (95% CI: 4.1 -7.0 days) 4 . Also, there is evidence of asymptomatic individuals capable of transmitting SARS-Cov-2, but the proportion of asymptomatic cases or how intense transmission could be from those cases remains an open question 6 . The fact is that transmission before symptoms or even in asymptomatic individuals makes control even harder. Second, targeted intervention would involve specific drug treatment regimens, which are not yet available due to the recent emergence of SARS-Cov-2. Furthermore, diagnostic tests, especially rapid ones, with appropriate levels of sensitivity and specificity will be quite helpful for implementing targeted interventions.",

At this moment, most recommendations for general population to avoid SARS-Cov-2 infection rely on altering social and individual routines, by implementing quarantine upon suspicion or detection of infection, by avoiding medium to large crowded events or gatherings, and also by applying regular hygiene practices or to establish norms for social interaction that avoid close contact. Also, discouraging travel reduces mobility and, as a consequence, the risk of importation and spreading of cases. Furthermore, upon detection of imported cases, personal isolation and contact tracing are also important to control new case bursts, but simulation results show that an effective control will require at least 70% of contacts to be traced, if the basic reproduction number equals 2.5 7 . Interestingly, Fraser et al. have shown that contact tracing also helps to determine the proportion of asymptomatic cases 8 .",

This happens for novel pathogens, such as SARS-Cov-2, since major portions of the population can be considered at risk or susceptible. These strict measures to avoid transmission reduce the peak of the epidemic, even if its duration takes longer, to daily or weekly levels which allows for health facilities to manage patient care and treatment. Therefore, reducing epidemic peaks avoids an overload on the health system to properly address the crisis.",
