            "text": "ECP (eosinophil cationic protein) is a major component of eosinophil granule proteins, and is used as a clinical biomarker for asthma and allergic inflammatory disease. ECP has been implicated in damage to the cell membrane of many tissue types, but the mechanism is not well known. In the present study, mECP-eGFP-6H, a recombinant fusion protein containing mature ECP (mECP), enhanced green fluorescence protein (eGFP) and a His 6 tag (6H), has been expressed, purified and added to GH3 neuroendocrine cells to study the internalization ability of ECP. We found that mECP-eGFP-6H entered into GH3 neuroendocrine cells and inhibited the growth of the cells with an IC 50 of 0.8 \u00b5M. By yeast two-hybrid screening and immunoprecipitation, we have identified a specific protein-protein interaction between mECP and CPE (carboxypeptidase E), a well characterized metal-loprotease. Further in vivo yeast two-hybrid screening has also revealed that residues 318-387 located in a region of unknown function in mature CPE are indispensable for association with mECP. In addition, the uptake of mECP-eGFP-6H is suppressed by dominant-negative expression of the recycling defect mutant pre-pro-HA-CPE S471A,E472A in GH3 cells, suggesting that the entry of mECP-eGFP-6H is associated with the recycling of CPE in GH3 cells. Taken together, we have demonstrated that CPE possesses a novel function to facilitate the entry of ECP to neuroendocrine cells, and such an endocytotic process allows the cytotoxic ECP to inhibit growth of the target cells.",

It is classified as a member of the RNase A superfamily and exhibits differential biological effects both in vivo and in vitro [1] . Among eight human RNases, ECP is most similar to EDN (eosinophilderived neurotoxin). ECP is bactericidal [2] and helminthotoxic [3, 4] , and is cytotoxic to tracheal epithelium [5, 6] . When intrathecally injected into rabbits, ECP or EDN elicit the Gordon phenomenon, a syndrome manifested by ataxia, muscular rigidity, paralysis and tremor that may lead to death, and, most of the time, the characteristic Purkinje cell toxicity occurs [7, 8] . Although the mechanism of its cytotoxicity is not completely understood, it is suggested that the pore-forming activity of ECP, but not the RNase activity, plays a key role in destabilizing lipid membranes of the target cells [9, 10] . This is consistent with data showing that the cytotoxicity of ECP is greater than that of EDN [11] .",

Despite the high degree of sequence similarity between ECP and other members of the RNase A superfamily, ECP exhibits weak, but definite, RNase activity. ECP is able to internalize the cytosol effectively and escape from proteolytic attack. It is accumulated in the cytosol to large excess over the concentration of RNase inhibitors, such that degradation of cytosolic RNA molecules occurs [13] . The cellular internalization of proteins often occurs via a specific energy-dependent endocytosis pathway, through either clathrin-coated or nonclathrin-coated endosomes. Maeda et al. [12] suggested that ECP may interact preferentially with a receptor or binding protein on the cell surface [12] . Hence ECP appears to enter cells via energydependent endocytosis. However, no ECP-interacting protein involved in this endocytotic process has ever been identified.",

The results show that mECP-eGFP-6H enters the cell, whereas RNase A does not. In addition, mECP-eGFP-6H inhibits growth of GH3 cells with an IC 50 of 0.8 \u00b5M. Using mECP as a bait to investigate its interacting proteins via a yeast two-hybrid system, we found that ECP interacted with the transmembrane, lipidraft-associated pro-hormone-sorting receptor, CPE (carboxypeptidase E). Blocking the maturation of CPE-associated secretory granules and the dominant-negative expression of CPE S473A,E474A , a recycling-defect mutant, in the GH3 cell line both interfered with the internalization of mECP-eGFP-6H, indicating that interaction between mECP and CPE plays a major role in internalization of mECP to the neuroendocrine cells. Our results provide the first demonstration of a non-surface-receptor-mediated mechanism responsible for the entry of cytotoxic RNase into the target cells. Preparation of recombinant mECP-eGFP-6H and eGFP-6H fusion proteins hECP (human ECP) cDNA was isolated and expressed in an Escherichia coli T7 expression system by a modified method as described previously [14] . The eGFP gene was cloned into pET23b(+) vector between the HindIII and XhoI sites to generate eGFP-pET23b(+). The mECP gene was subsequently introduced between the NdeI and HindIII sites to generate mECP-eGFP-pET23b(+). Both recombinant DNAs were transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3) cells for protein expression. Volumes of 1 ml of overnight culture of each transformant were inoculated in 1 litre of LB (Luria-Bertani) containing 200 \u00b5g/ml carbenicillin (Sigma), and grown overnight at 20 \u2022 C with shaking.

Briefly, two restriction enzyme sites, BamHI and SacI, were introduced at the 3 -end of CPE 154-476 DNA fragment on the CPE 154-476 -pGADT7 clone to generate CPE 154-476,BamHI,SacI -pGADT7. CPE 154-476,BamHI,SacI -pGADT7 was double digested by BamHI and SacI restriction enzymes, then treated with ExoIII nuclease at 25 \u2022 C, and samples were taken at 30 s intervals. After ExoIII digestion, DNAs were treated with S1 nuclease and Klenow enzyme for 15 min at 37 \u2022 C. Finally, the treated DNA products were ligated by T4 DNA ligase at room temperature for 1 h, before the self-ligated DNAs were transformed into Top10F' for screening.",

            "text": "The results of the present study show that mECP not only gets internalized into GH3 neuroendocrine cells, but also inhibits the growth of the cells. This phenomenon is consistent with previously reported growth-inhibitory effects of ECP on mammalian leukaemia, epidermoid carcinoma and breast carcinoma cell lines [12, 13] . We found that the growth of GH3 cells was inhibited completely by mECP-eGFP-6H at a concentration of 2. The entry of mECP-eGFP-6H into the GH3 cells has been shown to be associated with the secretion cycle of the regulated secretory granules, indicating that mECP may interact with the component proteins within the secretory granules. Yeast two-hybrid library screening and immunoprecipitation experiments provide two lines of evidence that mECP interacts specifically with CPE. CPE was first purified from bovine brain and is also called enkephalin convertase or CPH. It is a CPB-like metalloenzyme associated with the biosynthesis of many peptide neurotransmitters and hormones. The role of CPE in the removal of C-terminal basic residues exposed by the endoproteases is known to be necessary for the processing of a large number of the protein precursors [17] . Previous studies suggested that CPE expressed in breast cancer and small-cell carcinoma of the lung cells was necessary to process neuropeptides for autocrine loops [18, 19] . To investigate further the critical role that CPE plays in different cells, in terms of facilitating internalization of recombinant ECP, we have examined the expression of CPE in mammalian cell lines such as K562 and A431 by Western blot analysis. The results clearly reveal that CPE is expressed at different levels in these cell lines (results not shown), meaning that the expression of CPE in these cells may be associated with the ECP-uptake effect. Several metallocarboxypeptidases have now been demonstrated to be multifunctional. For example, duck gp180 (glycoprotein 180), which has CPD activity, binds to preS envelope protein of duck hepatitis B virus particles [20] , and human ACE2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2) is a receptor for SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) coronavirus [21] . The present study indicates that membrane-bound CPE facilitates the entry of recombinant ECP to cells. To our knowledge, this is the first report showing that a non-surface-receptor protein is directly responsible for the internalization of recombinant mECP.",

            "text": "Further analysis of CPE deletion clones employing the yeast two-hybrid system has revealed that residues 318-387 in mCPE are indispensable for association with mECP. This region is highly conserved in all regulatory carboxypeptidase members and is located in a domain of previously unknown function. Our results provide the first evidence for the biological function of this particular domain. Both CPE and CPD are major peptideprocessing enzymes that are present in the secretory pathway of neuroendocrine cells and can recycle from the cell surface. However, they are enriched in different parts of the pathway [22] . The subcellular localization of the former is in the regulated secretory vesicles, but the latter is in the trans-Golgi network [22, 23] . The mECP-interacting region on CPE is highly conserved with the second domain of CPD, indicating that specific proteinprotein interaction between mECP and CPE may also occur between mECP and CPD. Since CPD is a carboxypeptidase that is widely distributed in different tissues, and not only limited to neuroendocrine tissues, such an interaction may contribute to the broad role of CPD in processing proteins that transit the secretory pathway.",

In addition to simple RNase activity, some members of the RNase A superfamily have cytotoxic activity towards tumour cell lines. For example, BS (bovine seminal)-RNase, onconase, human EDN with four extra residues SLHV (Ser-Leu-His-Val) at the N-terminus and hECP all showed cytotoxicity to different mammalian cell lines [24] [25] [26] . hECP is one member of the human RNase A family, and the growth-suppression effect of several types of mammalian cell lines has been well studied. The growthinhibitory effect of ECP is cytostatic, but not cytotoxic, mainly due to its extraordinary stability among human RNases. Previous studies suggest that onconase, angiogenin and BS-RNase can bind to the specific receptor-like site in the plasma membrane, but no specific receptor protein has yet been identified [27] . In addition, the internalization mechanism of \u03b1-sarcin, onconase and toxic G88R RNase A has been demonstrated to be clathrin-independent and dynamin-independent [28, 29] . Hence researchers have suggested that ECP may be located in the vesicles or endosomes, and that there are cell-surface receptors for ECP [12, 13] .",

Previous studies have demonstrated that the C-terminal 25 amino acids of CPE are critical for the membrane binding and recycling of CPE [30, 31] . The S471A and E472A point mutations on CPE block the interaction between CPE and ARF6 (ADP-ribosylation factor 6) and abolish the recycling of CPE from plasma membrane to the trans-Golgi network in a clathrin-independent manner [31] . Although the primary structure of CPE shows high identity with the second domain of CPD, our results show that the uptake of mECP-eGFP-6H is suppressed by dominant-negative expression of the pre-pro-HA-CPE S471A,E472A recycling-defect mutant in GH3 cells, suggesting that uptake of mECP-eGFP-6H is mainly associated with the recycling of CPE in GH3 cells. Therefore it is expected that cells containing a sufficient amount of CPE can be potential target cells of mECP.",

The entry of mECP is associated with the recycling of CPE, and is consistent with the hypothesis that extracellular RNase uptake is via a clathrinindependent endocytosis pathway. Furthermore, this special cell-entry mechanism through CPE may provide clues for the loss of Purkinje cells in the cerebellum found with the Gordon phenomenon. Although CPE is identified to be a key player in the molecular mechanism of internalization and cytostatic effect of mECP, it still requires further investigation to search for other component proteins responsible for different cytotoxic RNases.",
