Highly efficient and accurate microbiological laboratory assay is essential to confirm the SARS-CoV-2 infection, rule out other pathogens that can cause CAP, and monitor secondary infections.

We also used multiplex PCR to detect 13 common respiratory tract pathogens in 96 non-NCP patients, and found that 30 patients (31.25%) were infected with at least one respiratory tract pathogen that may cause CAP. Further, we performed bacterial and fungal cultures as well as fungal serologic tests and found that there is no secondary bacterial/fungal infections in confirmed NCP patients. Our studies suggest that, during the epidemic of NCP in Anhui province, there was a certain proportion of infection and co-infection of other common pathogens of CAP, and the secondary bacterial and fungal infection is not detectable in NCP patients. In comparison with SARS-CoV-2 detection alone, this optimized strategy combining multiple pathogen detection for identification of NCP and other CAP patients as well as cultures and serologic tests for confirmed patients increases the diagnosis efficiency and facilitates the personalized medication.",

The virus was confirmed as the cause of the unexplained pneumonia and named as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which has resulted in a rapid outbreak throughout China and global spread, and posed a significant threat to public health [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] . According to a recent study, the transmission capacity of SARS-CoV-2 was higher than the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-cov) [7] . In the meantime, the infection by the virus could cause substantial critical conditions (14.8%~15.74%), as well as significant mortality (1.4%~14.6%) [8] [9] [10] . Therefore, early diagnosis, early isolation and early management are crucial to curb rapid spread of the virus and improve the prognosis of the patients [11] .",

In addition, about 70% of the 96 non-NCP patients in this study did not have any specific etiological diagnosis, which may be due to the specimens that we used for the detection being pharyngeal swabs but not alveolar lavage fluid. The positive rate of pharyngeal swab specimen in diagnosing CAP is usually low [20] . The SureX 13 respiratory pathogen multiplex kit used in this study did not include all common CAP pathogens such as Legionella and Chlamydia psittaci. It was reported that detection of alveolar lavage fluid with mNGS was able to detect more respiratory pathogens in CAP patients [21] .",

            "text": "Previous studies reported that secondary bacterial infection commonly occurs in influenza infection and is associated with an increased risk of death [22, 23] . In 2009 pandemic influenza A cases, 18% to 34% of patients admitted to the ICU also had bacterial infection [22] . At present, there are few reports about the incidence of secondary bacterial or fungal infection in NCP patients during treatment. Chen et al. found that none of 99 patients had co-infection of other respiratory viruses, but 4 patients had co-infection of bacteria and fungi. Common pathogens included A baumannii, K pneumoniae, A flavus, C glabrata, and C albicans. The authors believed that the infection probably occurred secondary to severe ARDS and/or high dose or prolonged use of glucocorticoid therapy [4] . In another study, Ai et al. found 6 cases with bacterial and fungal infection among 20 NCP patients [9] . In our study, we did not find any NCP patients with secondary bacterial or fungal infection during treatment. Although 6 patients' G test results were above the normal reference value, they were all in severe condition and were given large amounts of albumin and gamma globulin which possibly affected the test results. Moreover, all of the fungal cultures were negative, and the patients did not receive any anti-fungal treatment but still recovered. We suspect that the reason for the low occurrence of secondary infection in our NCP patients is possibly due to the non-invasive regimens, such as maintaining the oxygen saturation through High-flow nasal cannula oxygen therapy (HFNC), but not mechanical ventilation. The patients did not receive peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC), either. Another possible reason is that glucocorticoid was very carefully used to treat the patients even in severe conditions. Our results suggest that the abuse of antimicrobial agents should be avoided in the treatment of patients with SARS-CoV-2.",

Materials and Methods Patients We recruited 181 patients with suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection from Jan 21 to Feb 29, 2020 at the First Affiliated Hospital of University of Science and Technology(USTC) of China in Hefei, China. This hospital is designated to treat NCP patients in Anhui Province.

In brief, the extracted nucleic acid was mixed with primer pairs targeting the 13 tested RTPs and RT-PCR enzyme mix, and the PCR amplification was performed in Biosystems 7500 Real-Time PCR Systems, followed by capillary electrophoresis. PCR products were then separated by size on the Applied Biosystems 3500Dx Genetic Analyzer. The signals of the 15 labeled PCR products were finally measured by fluorescence and analyzed with GeneMapper 4.1 software (Termo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA).",

No bacteria or fungi were isolated from any of these tested samples (Figure 3). Fungal serologic tests GM test was done in 9 NCP patients, and the results were all negative. However, G test showed a nonspecific elevation in 6 out of 10 tested NCP patients (Figure 3). Treatment and outcome of patients NCP patients were treated based on the severity of the disease according to latest \"New Coronavirus Pneumonia Prevention and Control Program\". Non-NCP patients with a definite microbial diagnosis were treated according to the international community acquired pneumonia guidelines. By Mar 8 of 2020, 84 (98.82%) NCP patients was discharged from hospital (including 29 patients with severe NCP) and 1 (1.17%) patient died from the disease. The average hospitalization time of NCP patients was 16.79days. The dead case was a 55-year-old man and was transferred to our hospital after confirmed as SARS-CoV-2 infection.",
