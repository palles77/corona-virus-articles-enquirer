However, there is little research that has rigorously evaluated the association between domain swapping and protein folding/unfolding. Here, we examined a kinetic model in which domain swapping occurred via the denatured state produced by the complete unfolding of proteins. The relationships between swapping kinetics and folding/unfolding thermodynamics were established, which were further adopted as criteria to show that the proposed mechanism dominates in three representative proteins: Cyanovirin-N (CV-N), the C-terminal domain of SARS-CoV main protease (M pro -C), and a single mutant of oxidized thioredoxin (Trx_W28A ox ).",

            "text": "In comparison with conventional protein-protein interactions, 4 domain swapping has two distinct kinetic features. First, the interconversion between the monomer and the domain-swapped dimer is generally very slow. [5] [6] [7] The equilibrium process may take days or even months. Second, the interconversion rate is very sensitive to temperature. 5, 6, 8, 9 An increase in temperature by 3\u00c04 C is sufficient to produce an overall increase of the conversion rate by 10-fold. 8, 9 The extracted enthalpy component of the activation barrier is larger than 100 kcal/mol. These behaviors are closely related to the folding/unfolding process of proteins. In an extreme model (the unfolding mechanism for domain swapping), 6, 8, 10 it was proposed that domain swapping proceeds via complete unfolding, so the swapping kinetics can be explained in terms of the equilibrium folding/unfolding properties of proteins. Very recently, a study on Cyanovirin-N indeed verified that the energy barrier of domain swapping is very close to the equilibrium unfolding enthalpy of the protein. 8 However, there were also some doubts on the feasibility of the unfolding mechanism of domain swapping. 9, 11 The main concern is that the population of the fully unfolded state is too low to account for the observed swapping rate. 9, 11 In addition, careful examination with rigorous formalism is necessary to distinguish domain-swapping via fully unfolded states from domain-swapping via partially unfolded states. For example, the rigorous derivation of the unfolding mechanism for domain swapping predicts that the enthalpy barrier of domain swapping is two times that of the equilibrium unfolding enthalpy of the protein monomer (will be given below), and not onefold as that defined previously. 8 Here, we examined the kinetic properties of domain swapping under the unfolding mechanism and analyzed the experimental swapping data in combination with the folding/unfolding data of three proteins: Cyanovirin-N (CV-N), the C-terminal domain of SARS-CoV main protease (M pro -C), and a single mutant of oxidized thioredoxin (Trx_W28A ox ). The results showed that domain swapping in all three systems are well described by the unfolding mechanism when the heat capacity difference between the native and denatured states in protein folding/ unfolding is appropriately addressed.",

In the unfolding mechanism we discussed, U*U is assumed to be made of two completely unfolded monomers. If swapping proceeds via partial unfolding, then U*U should be composed of partially unfolded monomers and the derived swapping kinetics would relate to the thermodynamics of partial unfolding. Thus, there does not exist a tight correlation between the swapping kinetics and the global protein stability for swapping proceeds via partial unfolding.",

Its unfolding is not reversible, i.e., it spontaneously refolds to the monomer after thermal unfolding. (In Garcia-Pino et al., 21 the transition was written as S 2 !2I, which is synonymous to our notation of D!2M here. For the unfolding of monomer, the van't Hoff enthalpy instead of the calorimetric enthalpy was assigned to DH \u00f0M\u00de u since van't Hoff enthalpy better reflects the properties of denatured population.) In other words, the K d is very large in this system and the measured swapping kinetics is mainly determined by k off . Based on Table III value is very similar to the measured swapping kinetic barrier DH \u2021 (120 kcal/ mol), 21 suggesting the unfolding mechanism to be responsible for the domain swapping of Trx_W28A ox .

We are not suggesting that the unfolding mechanism is universal for all swapped proteins since each protein may behave in a distinct manner; however, the criteria presented were met in the examined proteins. Therefore, the unfolding mechanism probably dominates in these example systems.",
