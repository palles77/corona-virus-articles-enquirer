From a total of 74 lung tissue and 74 tracheal swab samples Staphylococcus aureus, 16.3%, Streptococcus equi subsp. equi, 13.0%, and Pasteurella multocida, 10.9%, were dominant isolates from pneumonic lungs; Escherichia coli, 12.7%, Proteus species, 10.9%, and Klebsiella pneumoniae, 9.1%, were the majority in the normal lungs. The majority of the isolates colonized both anatomical sites investigated. There was a statistically significant association between the health status of the camels as well as the anatomical site studied with the isolation rates of the major respiratory pathogens (p < 0.05). Furthermore, the isolates were susceptible to norfloxacin, streptomycin, and gentamicin but resistant to ampicillin and tetracycline on in vitro test. Further studies on the pathogenicity of the major isolates are recommended.",

The normal bacterial flora of a healthy individual can be altered by several factors such as changes in the hygienic condition, environmental and climatic conditions, and nutritional and immunological status of the animal. Such factors could lower the resistance of the lung tissue and the existing organism most probable would get the upper hand, leading to the presentation of a variety of pathologies (Bosch et al. 2013 ). The current study revealed that the majority of the isolated bacteria colonize both anatomical sites and a general increase in the isolation rate of the pathogenic bacteria as one goes down the respiratory tract (Fig. 2) . The normal bacterial flora was more prevalent in the respiratory passage ways of apparently healthy than the pneumonic camels. This is quite suggestive of the accepted idea that these organisms live as a commensal in the upper respiratory tract, invading the lung under conditions of stress. Stress factors have been reported to suppress the mucocilliary clearance mechanism and the overall respiratory defensive system which allows the proliferation of bacterial commensals in the respiratory tract and an abrupt shift from commensal to pathogen (Caswell 2014) . Similar trend of bacterial distribution was also observed by Azizollah et al. (2009) and Al-Tarazi (2001) during their bacteriological studies on the respiratory tracts of camels.",

On the other hand, Streptococcus species such as \u03b2-haemolytic Streptococci, S. viridans, S. pneumoniae, and S. pyogenes were described in active respiratory disease of camels elsewhere (Wareth et al. 2014; Ahmed and Musa 2015) . Yigezu et al. (1997) have reported the bacteria from camel lungs and suggested its role in the epizootic occurring in camels in Ethiopia. In the present work, S. equi subsp. equi was recovered from the lungs of camels, at a much higher rate in pneumonic lungs compared to healthy ones, but was not from the trachea. This could suggest low level occurrence of the organism as normal flora and involvement in camel pneumonia under optimum conditions. Therefore, the bacteria could be considered as one of the important players in camel respiratory infections. Streptococcus equi subsp. equi has been identified as the causative agent in equine strangles. The agent is directly transmissible via oral or nasal routes and by indirect means through contamination of the environment by excretions from sick horses. Regrouping of horses is usually a risk factor in a strangles outbreak (Yigezu et al. 1997) . Although the camel rearing areas of Asayita and Dubti are uninhabited by horses, they are inhabited by donkeys and used as pack animals; this could favor the transmission of the agent by contact.",

Despite the fact that Micrococcus, Enterococcus, Coagulase-negative staphylococcus species, Bacillus, Proteus, Corynebacterium, E. coli, P. aeruginosa, and Neisseria species are considered non-pathogenic, their isolation from pneumonic camel lungs by various workers (Al-Doughaym et al. 1999; Al-Tarazi 2001; Abubakar et al. 2008; Azizollah et al. 2009; Wareth et al. 2014 ) indicated that they could have a role in the development of respiratory infections. Hence, the possible role of these bacteria in camel respiratory disease complex under various conditions should not be overlooked though they have not been considered as major causative agents. Very recently, an emerging Middle-East respiratory syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) has been reported in camels of the Middle East and beyond (Funk et al. 2016; Ali et al. 2017) . We have also isolated a variety of viruses from respiratory tracts of Ethiopian camels (Ayelet et al. 2013) .

Accordingly, increased level of resistance among the respiratory pathogens against the commonly used antimicrobials in respiratory tract infections was observed ( Table 2 ). The majority of camel respiratory pathogens were found susceptible to norfloxacin, streptomycin, and gentamicin but resistant to the action of ampicillin and tetracycline. This is in agreement with the results of El-Mahmood et al. (2009) and Serin et al. (2010) . In addition, a similar resistance of S. equi subsp. equi and K. pneumoniae to tetracycline was recorded (Nkang et al. 2009 ). Fazlani et al. (2006) reported a high level of resistance of M. haemolytica and P. multocida to streptomycin. In this study, however, both organisms were found to be susceptible to streptomycin, while they were resistant to tetracycline and ampicillin. This represents a shift of resistance from streptomycin to tetracycline and ampicillin. This may be associated with the present lesser usage or misuse of streptomycin for animal diseases unlike tetracycline which is commonly used for most animal diseases today.",

The people in the study areas have easy access to purchase tetracycline and ampicillin from the private pharmacies and any open market without prescription. They have also the opportunity of getting many drugs from NGO's working in livestock production, but they have a strong desire to tetracycline. As a result, they provide health care by themselves. This probably means that the selective pressure of these commonly used antibiotics on the bacteria circulating in the community could have resulted in high frequency of resistance among the isolates. Apart from ease of accessibility, these drugs have been found to be adulterated and therefore used at a very low dosage. Therefore, there is a need for practitioners and researchers to be aware of the bacterial flora of the camels and of their antibiotic sensitivities so as to be informed of the appropriate antibiotics to be used in the course of respiratory infections and control programs.",

It is a multifactorial process among which a variety of bacterial species have been associated with respiratory problems. In the present investigation, S. equi subsp. equi, P. multocida, M. haemolytica, K. pneumoniae, S. aureus, and B. bronchiseptica have been isolated at much higher proportions from the lungs of pneumonic than the apparently healthy camels. Therefore, these bacterial spp. could be considered as candidate pathogens causing camel respiratory infections in the study area. Furthermore, the isolates have shown considerable resistance to commonly prescribed antimicrobials in the country calling for the need to conduct susceptibility testing for control of camel respiratory infections in the area. Therefore, we believe the data in this work contributes to diagnosis and control of respiratory problems in camels, which are important livestock spp. in arid and semi-arid regions in Ethiopia, in particular, and the tropics, in general.",
