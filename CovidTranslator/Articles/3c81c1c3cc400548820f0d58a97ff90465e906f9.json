            "text": "We read with interest a recent paper in this Journal by Luzatti and colleagues, 1 who explored the significance of the presence of Herpes simplex virus (HSV) DNA in lower respiratory tract (LRT) specimens for the diagnosis of HSV pneumonia in immunocompromised patients. The authors underlined the difficulty in gauging the clinical relevance of such a laboratory finding in the absence of histopathological data, as HSV shedding in the LRT may occur in the absence of disease. The interpretation of real-time PCR results for diagnosis of Pneumocystis jirovecii (PJ) pneumonia (PJP) faces an analogous challenge, since the presence of PJ DNA in LRT may reflect colonization (carriage) rather than infection. 2 There is limited information on the clinical value of PJ real-time PCR in diagnosing PJP in patients with hematological diseases; [3] [4] [5] [6] this is exceedingly challenging as the sensitivity of direct examination procedures is suboptimal due to low fungal burdens. 3 Here, we report on our experience on this matter. A total of 219 episodes of pneumonia occurring in 192 consecutive patients with hematological disorders in which PJP was considered in the differential etiological diagnosis were included. Of these, 127 episodes developed in patients undergoing either allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation-allo-HSCT-( n = 86) or autologous-HSCT ( n = 19), and 92 in non-transplant patients (acute leukemia, n = 61; lymphoma, n = 16; chronic leukemia, n = 8; others, n = 2). The patients were attended at the Hospital Cl\u00ednico Universitario-HCU-( n = 100) or at the Hospital Universitario Polit\u00e9cnico \"La Fe\" -HLF-( n = 92) between June 2014 and August 2019. No patients in the cohort tested positive for HIV. This study was approved by the respective hospital ethics committee and informed consent was obtained from all patients.",

            "text": "Strengths of the current study are the following: (i) clinical categorization of PJP was based upon stringent criteria defined by a multidisciplinary team; (ii) only hematological patients were included; (iii) a comprehensive routine investigation of microbial causes of pneumonia other than PJ was conducted; (iv) the experience of two centers was collected. In addition to its retrospective nature, our study also has some limitations: (i) we cannot completely rule out that some patients categorized as being PJ carriers The probability of Pneumocystis jirovecii (PJ) pneumonia (PJP) for each patient was retrospectively evaluated by an expert committee including infectious diseases and microbiology specialists at both centers, on the basis of (i) documented PJ presence in respiratory specimens by microscopy; (ii) compatibility of clinical signs and symptoms (at least 2 of the following: subtle onset of progressive dyspnea, pyrexia, nonproductive cough, hypoxaemia and chest pain), (iii) compatible (suggestive) radiological findings (chest radiograph and/or high-resolution computed tomographic scan detection of interstitial opacities and/or diffuse infiltration infiltrates); (iv) complete resolution of symptoms after a full course of anti-PJP treatment; (v) absence of alternative diagnosis. The efficacy of therapy was assessed on a daily basis. PJP was ruled out if real-time PCR for PJ tested negative, or if clinical recovery occurred in the absence of PJ-targeted antimicrobial therapy. PJ colonization (carriage) was the most likely possibility when patients did not meet the above criteria and an alternate diagnosis was made. b Frequencies were compared using the \u03c7 2 test (Fisher exact test) for categorical variables. Two-sided exact P values were reported and P values \u2264 0.05 were considered statistically significant. The data were analyzed with the SPSS (version 20.0) statistical package. c Respiratory tract specimens were obtained following conventional procedures. Specimens were examined for presence of ascus or trophic forms of PJ by microscopy following blue toluidine, calcofluor white or Grocott's methenamine silver staining. Cytospin preparations were prepared from BAL specimens for direct examination. Sputa and TA samples were mixed v/v with Sputasol (Oxoid, UK) and vortexed for 5 min. All samples were centrifuged at 30 0 0 g for 10 min, and the pellets were resuspended 1/10 in 0.9% NaCl for further processing. For real-time PCR, DNA was extracted from 200 \u03bcL of specimens using the QIAamp DNA Blood Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) on either QIA Symphony or EZ-1 platforms (Qiagen), following the manufacturer's instructions. At HCU, a commercially-available real-time PCR assay previously evaluated by others, the RealCycler PJIR kit R (Progenie Molecular, Spain), which targets the mitochondrial large sub-unit of ribosomal (mtLSU) RNA gene, was used according to the manufacturer's instructions ( http://www.progenie-molecular.com/PJIR-U-IN.pdf ). At HLF, the commercially-available Pneumocystis jirovecii Real Time PCR Detection. (CerTest Biotech; Zaragoza, Spain), which also targets the large sub-unit of ribosomal (mtLSU) RNA gene, was employed following the manufacturer instructions ( https://www.certest. es/wpontent/uploads/2019/02/VIASURE _ Real _ Time _ PCR _ Pneumocystis _ jirovecii _ sp1.pdf ). At both centers PCR were performed in the Applied Biosystems 7500 fast real-time PCR platform (Applied Biosystems, CA, USA). PCR results were reported as positive or negative. For positive samples, threshold cycle (C T ) values were also recorded. No standard curve was generated with a positive control for quantitative estimations. d Antimicrobial prophylaxis for PJP was performed with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX), one double-strength tablet (160 mg TMP/800 mg SMX) given 2 (in allogeneic HSCT patients) or 3 times a week with oral folic acid (15,16). Patients with suspicion of PJP according to the attending physician were treated with TMP/SMX 15-20 mg/kg (TMP) 75-100 mg/kg (SMX) per day for 2-3 weeks. e In all these cases, death was attributable to PJP. did in fact have PJP, as most of these patients received full courses of TMP/SMX in combination with antimicrobials targeting other microbial agents. The lack of standardized criteria for PJP diagnosis makes clinical misclassification of patients a potential drawback in studies such as ours, particularly when no positive microscopy or histopathology findings are available; (ii) although we evaluated over 200 patients, only 12 presumptively had PJP; (iii) two different commercially-available PCR assays were used across centers. Nevertheless, we found them to yield rather comparable C T s. In summary, we found that a positive PJ PCR result in respiratory specimens from transplant and non-transplant hematological patients with pneumonia frequently reflects colonization rather BAL, bronchoalveolar lavage; PJP, Pneumocysis jirovecii pneumonia; TA, tracheal aspirate. a As per our routine protocol, all specimens were examined by Gram and acid-fast bacilli stain. Samples were also examined for presence of respiratory viruses (RVs) using either the Luminex xTAG RVP Fast assay (Luminex Molecular Diagnostics, Austin, TX,USA) at HCU, or the CLART\u00ae PneumoVir assay (Genomica, Coslada, Spain) at both centers, as previously reported. 10 Semiquantitative (sputa) and quantitative (BAL and TA) cultures for bacteria were performed on conventional media: bacterial loads > 10 4 CFU/mL or > 10 5 CFU/ml were deemed to be clinically relevant on BAL fluids and TA samples, respectively. Specimens were cultured on BCYE-alpha agar, BD (Becton Dickinson) MGIT\u00ae ( Mycobacteria Growth Indicator Tube)/Lowenstein-Jensen agar slants and Sabouraud agar for recovery of Legionella pneumophila, Mycobacterium spp., and other fungal organisms, respectively. The Platelia TM Aspergillus Ag Kit (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) was used for quantitation of Aspergillus spp. galactomannan in BAL fluid and serum specimens. All BAL fluid specimens underwent cytomegalovirus (CMV) PCR testing using the RealTime CMV PCR assay (Abbott Molecular) at HCU or the CMV R-GENE\u00ae assay (Biomerieux) at HLF, as previously reported.
