Methods: All patients with the diagnosis of probable SARS admitted to a regional hospital in Hong Kong from March 9 to April 28, 2003, and who had SARS-related respiratory distress complications were recruited for NIPPV usage. The health status of all health-care workers working in the NIPPV wards was closely monitored, and consent was obtained to check serum for coronavirus serology. Patient outcomes and the risk of SARS transmission to health-care workers were assessed. Results: NIPPV was applied to 20 patients (11 male patients) with ARF secondary to SARS. Mean age was 51.4 years, and mean acute physiology and chronic health evaluation II score was 5.35. Coronavirus serology was positive in 95% (19 of 20 patients). NIPPV was started 9.6 days (mean) from symptom onset, and mean duration of NIPPV usage was 84.3 h. Endotracheal intubation was avoided in 14 patients (70%), in whom the length of ICU stay was shorter (3.1 days vs 21.3 days, p < 0.001) and the chest radiography score within 24 h of NIPPV was lower (15.1 vs 22.5, p \u202b\u060d\u202c 0.005) compared to intubated patients. Intubation avoidance was predicted by a marked reduction in respiratory rate (9.2 breaths/min) and supplemental oxygen requirement (3.1 L/min) within 24 h of NIPPV. Complications were few and reversible. There were no infections among the 105 health-care workers caring for the patients receiving NIPPV. Conclusions: NIPPV was effective in the treatment of ARF in the patients with SARS studied, and its use was safe for health-care workers.",

All were admitted to Pamela Youde Nethersole Eastern Hospital, Hong Kong, from March 9 to April 28, 2003, and subsequently had complications of SARS-related respiratory failure, to the extent that \u03fe 6 L/min of supplemental oxygen was required to maintain oxygen saturation at 93 to 96%. All patients were treated with our standard protocol of broadspectrum antibiotics, ribavirin, and corticosteroid. 9 Our 21-day steroid treatment protocol was as follows: IV methylprednisolone, 1 mg/kg tid for 5 days; then 1 mg/kg bid for 5 days; then oral prednisolone, 0.5 mg/kg bid for 5 days; then 0.5 mg/kg/d for 3 days; and finally 0.25 mg/kg/d for 3 more days. In case of rapid clinical and radiologic deterioration, a course of pulsed methylprednisolone, 500 mg bid for 2 days, was administered as rescue therapy. 9 Noninvasive Ventilation Settings NIPPV was delivered from a bilevel positive airway pressure system (BiPAP; Respironics; Murrysville, PA) with maximal positive pressures of 20 cm H 2 O or 30 cm H 2 O. The spontaneoustimed mode was used for all patients, with a back-up rate of 12 breaths/min. Inspiratory positive airway pressure (iPAP) was adjusted to achieve respiratory rates of \u03fd 25 breaths/min and exhaled tidal volumes of at least 6 mL/kg. Expiratory positive airway pressure (ePAP) was adjusted to achieve target oxygen-ation with minimum carbon dioxide rebreathing. In order to decrease production of droplets, the following three strategies were implemented: (1) a facial mask was preferred to a nasal mask to decrease the leakage of air from the mouth; (2) a Whisper-Swivel II (Respironics) was used as the exhalation device, because compared with the jet outflow of the Whisper-Swivel I, its round-the-tube outflow may reduce the chance of jets of expired air from the patients with SARS contaminating the environment; and (3) a viral-bacterial filter (Airlife; Allegiance Healthcare; McGaw Park, IL) was placed before the exhalation device from March 21, 2003, onwards to decrease the viral bacterial load to the environment. Oxygen was connected to the mask, and the fraction of inspired oxygen was estimated from the oxygen flow rate and minute volume. 12, 13 All patients were maintained continuously on NIPPV for at least 6 h after initiation. Thereafter, the mask could be removed for short periods of up to 30 min each for meals and sputum clearance. Respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, oxygen supplement requirement, and arterial blood gas results were closely monitored. Intubation was indicated if patients showed respiratory distress and/or when the supplemental oxygen requirement was \u03fe 12 L/min to maintain oxygen saturation of 93%. When improvement in respiratory rate and decrease in oxygen requirement were evident, gradual weaning in the daytime followed by sleeping hours was performed.",

Most patients with SARS and ARF were treated with endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation. 5, 6 In the present series, NIPPV was effective in preventing endotracheal intubation in 70% (14 of 20 patients). The efficacy of NIPPV may be attributed to early recruitment of the collapsed alveoli and resting of respiratory muscles while waiting for the action of pulsed corticosteroids to take effect. Since our patients who responded to NIPPV did so within 24 h, patients who would eventually need endotracheal intubation may thus be potentially identified early in the course of treatment. This finding is similar to the results of the use of NIPPV in other forms of ARF. 15 All three deaths in our series occurred in the elderly, with two patients having underlying comorbidities. This is similar to the higher mortality rates of SARS in such patients in Hong Kong (daily press briefing, May 8, 2003 ; Department of Health and Hospital Authority, Hong Kong). The overall intubation and mortality rates in our 90 patients with SARS were 10% and 4.4%, respectively. Our comparatively lower mortality rate 16 may partly be explained by the use of NIPPV, which may reduce the need for emergency intubation and intensive care admission when applied early to patients with SARS and severe acute hypoxemic respiratory failure.",

The subsequent successful sourcing and additional use of an expiratory viral and bacterial filter might also have contributed to prevention of staff infection. We hope that our experience could alleviate the anxiety of all health-care workers caring for patients with SARS, such that patients would not be deprived of NIPPV as an important modality of assisted ventilation.",

While nosocomial pneumonia can be explained by the use of high-dose corticosteroids, barotrauma may or may not be related to NIPPV since spontaneous pneumothorax or pneumomediastinum without ventilation were seen in six of our patients, as well as in 12% in another series from Hong Kong. 19 Our study is limited by the lack of a control group, and its retrospective nature. These problems were difficult to avoid in a rapid outbreak of an unknown disease. At the time of our planned randomized control study on NIPPV and endotracheal intubation in late April, SARS was already dying down in Hong Kong, and our last patient with SARS was clinically confirmed on April 28, 2003. To validate the effectiveness of NIPPV in SARS-related ARF, largerscale prospective randomized control studies can be considered in the next outbreak. Our study also suffers from the low availability of pre-NIPPV blood gas results, which in conjunction with lack of multiorgan failure led to low APACHE II scores. However, the progression of respiratory failure was so fast that treatment decisions took precedence over blood work in this very infectious condition. From the level of oxygen requirement and corresponding oxygen saturation, all patients without blood gas data could fulfil the criteria for type 1 respiratory failure. Our study is also limited by the incomplete coronavirus serology for the 105 health-care workers, as three of the health-care workers refused to give consent for blood taking.",
