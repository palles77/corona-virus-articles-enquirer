In the present work, a quantum chemical approach was followed to study the vibrational modes and the reactivity. Experimental techniques of FT-IR, FT-Raman were used to study the vibrational spectrum. A complete vibrational analysis was carried out and assignments of the fundamental modes were proposed. Molecular electrostatic potential, frontier molecular orbitals, electronic localization function and fukui functions were analyzed by using wavefunction analyser, Multiwfn 3.4.1 to study the chemical reactivity. Band gap energy of the title molecule is found to be 6.01 eV, as calculated from the HOMO-LUMO energies. The intermolecular charge transfer within the molecule was confirmed from the charge transfer interactions. Molecular docking studies were carried out to study the biological activity of the compound. Viral target proteins such as Dengue and Hepatitis C were chosen and the respective docking parameters were calculated.",

The presence of three nitrogens in triazole provides an interesting class of compounds. Triazole and its derivatives exhibit a broad spectrum of pharmacological properties such as antibacterial and antifungal activities [1] and also there are a lot of reports on the interaction between triazole and metal in preventing corrosion of metals [2] [3] [4] [5] . Although triazole and its derivatives show a wide spectrum of activity, the literature search revealed that not much has been reported about the structure/activity relationship of this class of compounds. An ab-initio method has been followed to study the derivatives of triazoles [6] [7] [8] . Since the first report of the broad spectrum antiviral activity and synthesis of ribavirin [9, 10] , the in vitro and in vivo antiviral activity has been confirmed in many independent laboratories [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] . Ribavirin has been proved clinically effective against hepatitis A virus [18] [19] [20] . Synthesis and determination of antiviral activity of the 2 (3 )-O-Methyl derivatives of Ribavirin [21] , of some phosphates of ribavirin [22] and amino acid esters of ribavirin were discussed in detail [23] .",

Using the Gaussian 09 W software the spectroscopic profiling of the title molecule was carried out in its optimised state. VEDA [26] program enabled percentage potential energy distribution (PED) analysis. In addition, the relative Raman intensities were attained from the scattering activities of the fundamental modes [27, 28] . Electrostatic potential (ESP) on molecular vdW (vander Waal) surface is a useful guide to the molecule's reactive behavior, especially in noncovalent interactions [29] . ELF and LOL are tools for performing covalent bonding analysis, as they reveal regions of molecular space where the probability of finding an electron pair is high [30, 31] . The Fukui functions are electron density-based local reactivity descriptors, proposed to explain the chemical selectivity or reactivity at a particular site of a chemical system [32] . The analyses such as ESP, Molecular orbitals, Fukui functions, ELF and LOL were finished by Multiwfn 3.4.1 [33] , which is a multifunctional wavefunction analysis program. The ESP map was rendered by VMD 1.9.1 program [34] based on the outputs of Multiwfn. Frontier molecular orbitals were plotted and the charge transfer interactions were studied. NBO analysis gives a clear evidence of stabilization originating from hyperconjugation of various intramolecular interactions. The reactive sites of the title compound were identified by calculating the Fukui functions for all the atomic sites. AutoDock Suite 4.2.1 [35] was used to find the minimum binding energy, inhibition constant and various parameters of the ligand-protein docking interactions [36] .",

Green and orange spheres represent surface local minima and maxima of ESP respectively. Global minimum on the surface was found to be \u221242.97 kcal/mol, its large negative value is owing to the lone pair of oxygen O7. The global maximum arising from the positively charged H29, the ESP at this point is much larger (55.32 kcal/mol) than that at other. This is because of the presence of oxygen, which attracted a great deal of electrons from H29. From the Fig. 5 , it can be seen that there is a large portion of the molecular surface having small ESP value, namely from \u221220 to 30 kcal/mol. The regions above and below the triazole ring have an abundant \u03c0 -electron cloud thus corresponding to the negative part; the positive part mainly arises from the positive charged C -H hydrogens; the near-neutral part represents the border area between the negative and positive parts.

The time dependent DFT (TD-DFT) calculations were made on the title compound using B3LYP/6-311 ++ G(d,p) as the basis set. The diagrams representing the electron-hole (green-blue) distribution and the electron-hole overlap for the 3 excited states are shown in Fig. 8 . Table 4 indicates the values of overlap of electron-hole distribution (S), charge transfer length (D), r and excitation energy (E) for different excitation modes. The distance between the centroid of hole and electron is a measure of charge transfer length (D); the larger the value, the longer length the charge transfers. Charge-transfer excitation (CT) occurs when the spatial separation of hole and electron is large which lead to movement of charge density from one place to another place. From the table, it can be seen that the charge transfer length of the second excitation mode is comparatively larger and r is also higher for the same mode indicating the fact that the second excitation mode corresponds to a strong charge transfer excitation. Even though the overlap integral of electron-hole distribution was found to be small in the first excited state, the charge transfer length is comparatively lesser.",

Fig. 9 gives a pictorial representation of fukui functions and dual descriptors, where blue regions correspond to negative regions prone to electrophilic attack and the green regions are positive areas prone to nucleophilic attack. From the table and the figure, it is evident that most of the atomic sites in the molecule are ready to undergo electrophilic attack rather than nucleophilic attack. f(r) value is negative for all the nitrogen and oxygen atoms indicating their favor for an electrophilic attack. All the carbon atoms except C11 and C13 are favorable for a nucleophilic attack.",

A Dengue RNA viral protein 1R6A [47] and a Hepatitis C viral protein 1HEI [48] were chosen to study the antiviral property of the ligand. The pdb structures of the target proteins are downloaded from RCSB (Research Collaboratory for Structural Bioinformatics) protein data bank ( http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/home/home.do ). Docked conformation which had the lowest binding energy was chosen to study the mode of binding. The molecular docking binding energies (kcal/mol) and inhibition constants (mM) were also obtained and listed in Table 6 ( Table 5 ) H27 was found to have the lowest value of s k ( \u22120.0 0 012), which indicates that this hydrogen atom acts as a nucleophile while binding to the target protein. Thus the topological analyses of the molecular structure complement the results obtained from the molecular docking studies. Docking results from previous studies [49] shows that the energy value obtained from the docking of Ribavirin with receptor Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 was zero, indicating very low binding affinity towards SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome). The antiviral action of ribavirin discussed above showed a better affinity towards viral proteins including dengue virus. Knowledge of Protein-Ligand interaction helps in designing new anti-viral drugs in the future.",

In general, a good agreement within experimental and theoretical normal modes of vibrations was found. Employing the DFT/B3LYP method with 6-311 ++ G(d,p) basis set, the optimized molecular geometry, vibrational frequencies along with infrared intensities and Raman activity of the molecule have been calculated. Frontier Molecular Orbitals analysis reveals the presence of ICT within the molecule, which is further confirmed by the charge transfer interactions due to excitation. The HOMO and LUMO energy values were calculated from which the band gap energy of the title compound was determined to be 6.0146 eV. The electron distribution and the reactive sites on the surface of the title compound were analysed using ESP, ELF and LOL. Fukui functions, local softness for all the atomic sites of the molecule were calculated. In addition, the molecular docking output shows that the title compound acts as a good antiviral agent against the Hepatitis C viral protein, with a low binding energy of \u22123.53 kcal/mol.",
