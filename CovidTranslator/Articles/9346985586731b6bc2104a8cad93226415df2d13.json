The prenatal form is divided into severe and mild subtypes, based on time of onset: before and after 35 weeks of gestation, respectively. The infantile form has an onset within the first 6 months of life and in the majority of cases resolves spontaneously by the age of 2 years.",

            "text": "The pathophysiology of ICH is not completely understood. It is assumed that inflammation plays a role, as demonstrated by leukocytosis and elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate. In addition, treatments with anti-inflammatory drugs such as glucocorticoids or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs have been proven to be helpful. 2 ICH is considered to be a genetic disease. In several reports, researchers investigated familial cases and hypothesized that the pattern of inheritance might be autosomal dominant with incomplete penetrance and variable expressivity. 3 In 2005, Gensure et al. 4 confirmed the autosomal-dominant trait of ICH by performing a genome-wide analysis of three unrelated families presenting the disease. The researchers found a novel missense mutation in the COL1A1 gene on chromosome 17q21. This mutation is a 3040C>T transition, resulting in the substitution of the amino acid Arginine by Cysteine at position 836 (R836C) within the helical domain of the a1 chain of type 1 collagen. This finding places ICH within the group of type 1 collagen-related conditions, such as osteogenesis imperfecta and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. 5 Following this report, patients with ICH expressing the COL1A1 mutation were reported worldwide, [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] and even one lethal prenatal genetic case of ICH was described. 12 Interestingly, in several ICH patients, this previously known mutation in COL1A1 was not identified nor were other novel mutations found for this gene. 4, 11 Some cases of ICH were suggested to be sporadic rather than genetic and were thought to differ from the familial form, as can sometimes be attributed to exposure to prostaglandin E1 and prostaglandin E2. 13, 14 It was also hypothesized that ICH might have an autosomal-recessive inheritance form [15] [16] [17] ; nevertheless, no specific mutation has so far been described.",

AHSG is a protein-coding gene located at chromosome 3q27. The protein encoded by this gene is fetuin-A/ alpha2-Heremans-Schmid-glycoprotein. Clinical diseases that are associated with genetic variants of AHSG include leanness, 18 Alopecia-Intellectual Disability Syndrome, 19 Epstein-Barr virus hepatitis, 20 and SARS coronavirus infection. 21 Fetuin-A is also correlated to the metabolic syndrome, 22 and its role as a cancer biomarker is investigated. 23, 24 Fetuin-A is thought to be a regulator of normal bone calcification and an inhibitor of pathological ectopic mineralization and calcification therefore was suggested to be important for physiologic osteogenesis and bone remodeling. 25 Fetuin-A is a negatively charged glycoprotein (molecular weight 52 kDa), produced mainly by hepatocytes, secreted by the liver into the circulation, and accumulated in mineralized bone. 26 It is assumed that fetuin-A is produced in osteocytes as well and, to a far lesser extent, in osteoblasts, modulated by the bone-derived hormone FGF-23. 27 The protein is processed from a single chain precursor into its mature circulating form, which is composed of two N-terminal cystatin protein domains and a third proline-rich C-terminal domain. The amino-terminal domain D1 enables high affinity to calcium phosphate, forming soluble protein-mineral complexes (\"mineral chaperones\"), thereby preventing pathological calcification at enriched mineral sites. 28 In addition, fetuin-A functions as an antagonist to the transforming growth factor beta (TGF-\u03b2) and bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) superfamily of cytokines and in this manner controls tissue remodeling and inflammation in osteoblastic cells. Fetuin-A structure shares homology with the extracellular domain of TGF-\u03b2 receptor type II, allowing fetuin-A to bind directly to TGF-\u03b21 and TGF-\u03b22 and with greater affinity to TGF-\u03b2-related BMPs (BMP-2, BMP-4, and BMP-6) and limit cytokine activity. 29 In vitro studies showed that, in cultures of rat bone marrow cells, fetuin-A binds to TGF-\u03b2 cytokines and suppresses dexamethasone osteogenesis. 29, 30 Since the model of AHSG knockout mice (Ahsg\u2212/\u2212) became available, researchers examined in vivo the role of fetuin-A in bone metabolism. In several studies, AHSG-deficient mice displayed severe extra-osseous calcifications of the kidney, Fig. 2 Validation to the AHSG mutation. Sanger sequencing chromatograms confirmed segregation of the identified AHSG sequence variants in the patient and his parents. The first ATG codon of the encoded fetuin-A protein and the resulted TAG termination codon are boxed in red. The mutated nucleotide is marked with a blue arrow Fetuin-A deficiency is associated with infantile cortical hyperostosis. . . R Merdler-Rabinowicz et al.",

Rittenberg et al. 34 implanted human native BMP into hindquarter muscles of mice and showed that the ratio of cortical to cancellous bone was more than two-fold higher in Ahsg\u2212/\u2212 mice compared to WT and also presented higher incidence of immature bone islands (\"satellite ossification\"). Szweras et al. 35 showed that mice lacking ASHG protein display growth plate defects, increased bone formation including cortical thickening, and enhanced cytokine-dependent osteogenesis. All these findings in mice highly point to a possible role of AHSG deficiency in the pathophysiology of Caffey disease, which is characterized by subperiosteal bone hyperplasia. Clinically, elevated serum levels of fetuin-A were found to be correlated with a mild form of osteogenesis imperfecta, 36 whereas depressed levels of fetuin-A were observed in increased bone turnover conditions, such as Paget's disease. 37 Interestingly, a novel homozygous stop codon mutation in AHSG gene was found in our presented case who had typical features of infantile Caffey disease. This resulted in no production of fetuin-A in the patient, as detected by ELISA test. Taking into consideration the importance of fetuin-A in bone metabolism, we highly suspect that this AHSG gene defect is the cause of the ICH phenotype in our patient. These findings also support the theory that ICH can be inherited in an autosomal-recessive manner. Our discovery raises the possibility of potential treatments for ICH. For instance, in patients with pseudoxanthoma elasticum, a hereditary disease of ectopic mineralization in soft connective tissues caused by a known mutation in ABCC6 gene, circulatory fetuin-A was found to be reduced. 38 Jiang et al. 39 suggested that normalization of serum fetuin-A, either through gene therapy or by direct protein delivery to the circulation, can be used to treat the disease. In this manner, based on our study, fetuin-A should also be considered as a treatment for ICH.",

However, as described above, previous studies that investigated AHSG knockout mice showed bone hyperplasia and cortical thickening resembling ICH manifestations. The novel stop codon mutation that we described causes zero production of fetuin-A. In other words, it is equivalent to knocking out the AHSG gene. Thus we consider this mutation to be the cause of ICH in our patient. We, therefore, propose that additional Caffey disease patients with non-COL1A1 defects will be assessed for fetuin-A deficiency. It can be argued that our patient might have a \"Caffey-like\" disease with manifestations imitating the classic infantile Caffey disease described in the literature. However, the classic presentation in our patient, including the laboratory and imaging findings, as well as the prompt resolution of the symptoms, are all consistent with ICH, therefore we highly recommend additional ICH patients with non-COL1A1 defects to be assessed for fetuin-A deficiency.",
