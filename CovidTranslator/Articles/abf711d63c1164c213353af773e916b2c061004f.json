Eight cold-temperature indices, average, maximum, and minimum temperatures, and the temperature humidity index, wind chill index, apparent temperature, effective temperature (ET), and net effective temperature and their standardized Z scores were applied to distributed lag non-linear models. Index-specific cumulative 26-day (lag 0-25) mortality risk, cumulative 8-day (lag 0-7) outpatient visit risk, and their 95% confidence intervals were estimated at 1 and 2 standardized deviations below the median temperature, comparing with the Z score of the lowest risks for mortality and outpatient visits. The average temperature was adequate to evaluate the mortality risk from all causes and circulatory diseases. Excess all-cause mortality increased for 17-24% when average temperature was at Z = \u2212 1, and for 27-41% at Z = \u22122 among study areas. The cold-temperature indices were inconsistent in estimating risk of outpatient visits. Average temperature and THI were appropriate indices for measuring risk for all-cause outpatient visits. Relative risk of all-cause outpatient visits increased slightly by 2-7% when average temperature was at Z = \u2212 1, but no significant risk at Z = \u2212 2. Minimum temperature estimated the strongest risk associated with outpatient visits of respiratory diseases. In conclusion, the relationships between cold temperatures and health varied among study areas, types of health event, and the cold-temperature indices applied. Mortality from all causes and circulatory diseases and outpatient visits of respiratory diseases has a strong association with cold temperatures in the subtropical island, Taiwan.",

However, other weather variables, such as relative humidity (RH), wind speed (WS), and water vapor pressure may also affect human perceptions of ambient temperature. The cold effect is most severe when accompanied by strong winds (Kunst et al., 1993) . Therefore, composite indices, including the temperature humidity index (THI), wind chill index (WCI) (Kunst et al., 1994; Woodall, 2004) , apparent temperature (AT) (Anderson and Bell, 2009; Chung et al., 2009) , effective temperature (ET) (Gomez-Acebo et al., 2010; Gonzalez et al., 1974) and net effective temperature (NET) (Gomez-Acebo et al., 2010; Li and Chan, 2000) , have been applied to evaluate health risks associated with cold spells or low temperatures.

(2011) reported that no significant association exists between maximum apparent temperature and hospital admissions for respiratory, cardiovascular, and cerebrovascular diseases in Denmark (Wichmann et al., 2011) . Multicity studies reported the cold effects were most significant in warm regions (1997; Langford and Bentham, 1995; Wang et al., 2012) or areas with moderate winter climates (Conlon et al., 2011) . Residents in warm regions have less physical, social, and behavioral adaptations to low temperatures. Residing in a subtropical area with high temperatures and high humidity, the population in Taiwan is more susceptible to low temperatures than to high temperatures (Chen et al., 1995; Lin et al., 2011; Wang et al., 2012; Wu et al., 2011; Yang et al., 2009 ). Therefore, this study aimed to identify cold-temperature indices appropriate to evaluate the association between temperature and health events in Taiwan.

Wind draws heat away from the exposed body, making exposed people feel cold (Siple and Passel, 1945) . To assess temperature exposure for humans, Taiwan Central Weather Bureau adopts the THI (Rosenberg et al., 1983) , which resembles the thermal discomfort index developed by the US Weather Bureau, and widely used in Europe (Pantavou et al., 2011) . The AT, which defines human thermal comfort, can be combined with temperature, atmospheric pressure and WS into one indicator (Steadman, 1984) . The ET encompasses air temperature and RH that has been applied as a biometeorological index of man's thermal discomfort (Gonzalez et al., 1974; Hentschel, 1987) .

Fig. 2 displays the associations between standardized values of cold-temperature index and cause-specific mortality and number of outpatient visits. Mortality from circulatory diseases and number of outpatient visits for respiratory diseases were negatively associated with temperatures in a linear trend. These patterns were similar to the association between temperatures and all-cause mortality. Conversely, this study observed a slightly increased death from respiratory diseases and outpatient visits for circulatory diseases under extremely cold temperatures (i.e., Z b \u22122). The associations between health outcomes and standardized cold-temperature indices were consistent among all study areas. Table 3 shows the relative risk of all-cause mortality associated with the 8 cold-temperature indices at \u2212 1 SD and \u2212 2 SD of the temperatures. Based on the selection criteria of lower AIC values, average temperature and ET were the two best cold-temperature indices for associating with all-cause mortality in the three areas (Table 3) . However, the AIC values measured in these models were similar. Supplementary Figs. 2-4 show cumulative 26-day relatively risk of all-cause mortality associated with the original measured coldtemperature indices and their standardized values by area. The lowest mortality risks were observed at Z = 1 (i.e., the 84.1th percentile of average temperature in the cold periods), which was set as baseline value in DLNMs for the study areas .

            "text": "Various temperature indices, including daily average temperature, minimum temperature, and other composite indices, have been used to assess the strength of the association between temperature and adverse health outcomes (Carder et al., 2005; Gomez-Acebo et al., 2010; Ye et al., 2012) . However, no methodology has been standardized for the best prediction of the temperature-related health loss. The general population may easily appreciate a single temperature measurement, such as an average temperature, which can be easily measured by the public (1997; Lin et al., 2011; Martin et al., 2012) . Europe's PHEWE project adopted maximum 3-hourly apparent temperature (Tappmax) in association with the risks of mortality and hospital admission because Tappmax combines temperature and humidity that consider the effects of evaporation and perspiration in warm environment (Michelozzi et al., 2007) . Two studies found that WCI has been concluded as a better marker than other temperature measurements for estimating cold-related health outcomes in two studies (Carder et al., 2005; Kunst et al., 1994) . Gomez-Acebo et al. (2010) ) found minimum temperature the most sensible measure among all single temperature measurements. However, they concluded that the risk patterns were very similar, regardless of which indicator was used (Gomez-Acebo et al., 2010) . A study in Seoul found minor differences in the mortality risks among assessments using average temperatures, minimum temperatures, and the changes of temperatures between days (Ha et al., 2009) . After adjusting for humidity, Anderson et al. failed to observe significant differences in temperature-mortality associations measured with metrics of average temperature, maximum temperature, and AT. Barnett et al. (2010) further suggested choosing a temperature indicator based on practical concerns for being able to use the integrated data. Our study suggests that average temperature and ET are two optimal cold-temperature indices for modeling the allcause mortality relationship with cold temperature. For mortality from cardiopulmonary diseases, average temperature is consistently the optimal cold-temperature index for modeling. However, the optimal cold-temperature index varies with cause-specific outpatient visits. The THI and average temperature are better than the other cold-temperature indices in associating low temperatures with allcause outpatient visits. For the relationship between cold temperature and respiratory outpatient visits, minimum temperature is the best index (Anderson and Bell, 2009; Barnett et al., 2010) .",
