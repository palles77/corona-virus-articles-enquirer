Challenge with a 10 2 50% cell culture infectious doses of YFV resulted in a 50-80% mortality rate in female hamsters. Virus was detected by QRT-PCR in liver, kidney, spleen, and serum with peak titers on 4-6 days post-viral challenge (dpi). Serum levels of alkaline phosphatase, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), bilirubin, blood urea nitrogen, potassium, and creatinine were significantly elevated, while serum levels of albumin, amylase, glucose, calcium, globulin, phosphorus, sodium, and total protein were significantly reduced. Packed cell volume and white blood cell count were significantly elevated during the course of the infection. Intraperitoneal treatment of hamsters with 0.5-5 \u03bcg/kg/d interferon (IFN) alfacon-1, 100 mg/kg/d viramidine, or 50 mg/kg/d ribavirin, initiated 4 h prior to YFV challenge, resulted in significant improvement in survival and serum ALT levels. Treatment with IFN alfacon-1 or ribavirin starting 2 dpi, also significantly improved survival and serum ALT levels in hamsters challenged with YFV. Pre-and post-virus exposure treatment with IFN alfacon-1 was efficacious in improving disease in YFVinfected hamsters.",

The virus is endemic in Africa and South America, but cases of YFV have been reported in nonendemic areas after travel (Bae et al., 2003; McFarland et al., 1997) . Viscerotropic infections have also occurred with vaccination, so there is also risk of infection with vaccine strains (Anon., 2002; Martin et al., 2001; Vasconcelos et al., 2001) . Therefore, the development of therapies for treatment of YFV disease is not only important for those in endemic areas, but also for those that may travel to endemic areas or those who may experience disease after vaccination.",

Treatment with IFN alfacon-1 appeared to be dose responsive with higher survival and greater improvement in other disease parameters at the highest dose, but with diminished effect at lower doses of this cytokine. These results were not surprising as IFN alfacon-1 has been shown to have efficacy against different flaviviruses, as well as other groups of viruses (Gowen et al., 2005; Loutfy et al., 2003; Morrey et al., 2004a; Morrey et al., 2004b; Sjogren et al., 2005) . IFN alfacon-1 treatment was effective when administered 2 dpi and further studies should be aimed at determining how late treatment may be initiated with this compound to reduce mortality and viral parameters. The relative biological potency of IFN alfacon-1 in hamsters compared to humans is approximately 40-fold less (Hu et al., 1995) . Therefore an estimate of the biological potency (IFN units) given to the hamsters in this study is 125,000 U/kg/day. The FDA approved human dose of IFN alfacon-1 for the treatment of chronic Hepatitis C in humans is 9 \u03bcg or 9 MU. On average, chronic Hepatitis C patients weigh approximately 75 kg resulting in the approved dose of IFN alfacon-1 as approximately 120,000 U/kg.
