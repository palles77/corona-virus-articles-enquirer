            "text": "The goal of this chapter is to provide a mechanistic overview of the key steps involved in understanding the pathogeneses of infectious diseases caused by microbes (i.e., bacteria, viruses, fungi, protozoa, and prions). Coverage is not intended to be encyclopedic; specific diseases have been selected either because they illustrate a basic mechanism or because they are of primary importance to the practice of veterinary medicine. Because the knowledge base for some veterinary diseases is limited, certain sections of this chapter are conditional and are based on (1) extrapolations from known experimental systems, (2) established mechanisms of injury covered in the basic pathology chapters of this book, and (3) assumptions anchored in the characteristics of macroscopic and microscopic lesions that arise with each disease. This chapter will also discuss and illustrate selected \"especially dangerous and contagious microbes\" because diseases caused by these pathogens can have catastrophic impact on livestock health and production and on the economies of affected countries. The locations in this textbook of coverage of these diseases considered by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)/Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) and the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) as \"Foreign Animal Diseases\" or \"OIE Reportable Diseases,\" respectively, are listed in E- ",

Colonize targets to sustain and/or amplify the encounter 3 or cross the barrier system formed by mucosae, mucocutaneous junctions, or skin to gain access to targets located locally in the lamina propria, submucosa, or dermis/subcutis Fig. 4-7) . 3a, Microbes encounter mucosa-associated cells (e.g., lymphocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells). 3b, Microbes encounter receptors of the nervous system embedded in barrier systems. 4, Microbes spread locally to lymphoid tissues (e.g., mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue [MALT] such as tonsils, Peyer's patches) in barrier system. 5, Microbes spread regionally in afferent lymphatic vessels. 6, Microbes encounter cells in regional lymph nodes. 7, Microbes spread systemically in efferent lymphatic vessels to the thoracic duct and anterior vena cava. Spread systemically to all organ systems Spread via thoracic duct to blood vascular system Spread via regional lymphatic vesels Essential Concept 4-1). Microbes gain access to these portals via ingestion (alimentary system), inhalation (respiratory system), ascending entry (urogenital system), penetration (integumentary system, eye) , and direct contact (integumentary system, ear, and eye). Following the initial entry, microbes may then gain access to (1) broader expanses of mucosa via normal physiologic processes such as ingestion (swallowing, peristalsis), inhalation (centrifugal forces, turbulence), ascension (reflux pressures, simple brownian movement [i.e., urogenital tract]), or direct contact (blink reflex, lacrimation) or to (2) deeper (and/or broader) expanses of skin and mucocutaneous junctions via traumatically induced abrasions or by penetration caused by insect bites or scratch and bite wound as examples.",

            "text": "A concept central to pathogeneses of infectious diseases is the ability of microbes to reach a site in the body that has \"target cells or substances\" suitable for their growth and replication. They will be discussed in a later section. Additionally, a second concept central to pathogeneses of infectious diseases is the phrase \"virulence factor.\" Because this phrase will be used extensively in subsequent sections, its meaning needs to be summarized here but will be discussed in greater detail in sections that follow. Virulence factors are molecules (and thus genes) of microbes that enable them to replicate and cause disease. They include glycoprotein, glycolipid, or other types of molecules that are present in the structure of microbes, as well as molecules derived from transcription and/or translation of the microbial genome. Some of these virulence factors are integral to the biologic structure of microbes; other factors are synthesized by microbes using the metabolic processes of the target cell as needed to replicate. These factors serve to do the following: \u2022 Colonize (e.g., adhesins) target substances, cells, and/or tissues at portals of entry \u2022 Invade (e.g., invasins) target substances, cells, and/or tissues at portals of entry \u2022 Evade (e.g., enzymes, toxic molecules) barrier systems and defense mechanisms \u2022 Suppress (e.g., enzymes, toxic molecules) innate and adaptive immune responses \u2022 Acquire (e.g., siderophores) nutrition from target substances, cells, and/or tissues. The ability of microbes to replicate and cause disease is the result of their interactions with substances, cells, and/or tissues at portals 4. Spread locally in the extracellular matrix (ECM) to encounter and colonize new populations of target cells, including lymphocytes, macrophages (monocytes), and dendritic cells, as well as blood and lymphatic vessels and their circulating cells 5. Enter blood and/or lymphatic vessels a. Travel inside lymphocytes, macrophages (monocytes), or dendritic cells within these vessels protected from the animal's defense mechanisms 4 b. Travel as \"cell-free\" microbes (i.e., not within or associated with a cell) within these vessels 6. Spread to regional lymph nodes and/or then systemically within the blood vascular system to encounter, colonize, and invade new populations of target cells that are unique to a specific organ system 7. Cause dysfunction and/or lysis of target cells and disease These steps and thus the ability of microbes to cause disease (pathogenicity) are controlled by \"virulence factors\" expressed by their genes. The acquisition of new and/or more \"virulent\" genes through recombination and/or natural selection of mutated genes allows microbes to (1) complete one or more of the listed steps more rapidly and/or efficiently, (2) evade or reduce the effects of an animal's defense mechanisms, and/or (3) develop resistance to specific antibiotics. These outcomes may result in greater cell and tissue injury (and thus disease) within a targeted organ system of an individual animal or greater pathogenicity of a disease within a herd.",

They are trapped in the mucus layer of mucosae of the oral pharynx and intestines and must penetrate this layer to reach targets such as epithelial cells, macrophages, and dendritic cells. M cells of the small intestinal mucosa lack a mucus covering and therefore offer a unique portal to enter the alimentary system (see later section on Target Cells). Mucus in the alimentary system is produced by goblet cells distributed among mucosal epithelial cells in the villi and crypts where it covers and protects microvilli. The mucus layer is a (1) physical and (2) biologic barrier protecting the intestine against microbes via (1) its thickness and viscosity, (2) binding to bacterial adhesins, (3) serving as a reservoir for immunoglobulin A (IgA) and lysozyme, and (4) acting as a free radical scavenger.

It is less prominent over absorptive enterocytes with microvilli when compared to crypt enterocytes.

As an example, the alimentary system has diseases that occur in the oral cavity, tonsils, esophagus, stomach, small intestine, cecum, and large intestine. Therefore some microbes must travel within the alimentary system, often for a great distance, to reach their \"initial encounter\" target cells. Swine dysentery (Brachyspira hyodysenteriae) is a bacterial disease that colonizes the mucus layer and goblet cells of the colon and cecum.

Groups of microbes ranked from smallest to largest include viruses (\u22485 to 300 nm [1 \u00d7 10 \u22129 m] in diameter), prions (\u224816 nm in diameter), bacteria (\u22480.5 to 5 \u00b5m [1 \u00d7 10 \u22126 m] in diameter), fungi (\u22485 to 60 \u00b5m in diameter), and protozoa (\u22481 to 300 \u00b5m in diameter). Although it is convenient to compare microbes based on size, rarely are they inhaled as free organisms. Most commonly they are enclosed in fomites (i.e., inanimate objects or substances capable of carrying microbes) such as dust particles, soil, septum, or body fluids. Thus the physical properties of infectious fomites (i.e., fomites containing microbes) determine where they are deposited on mucosal surfaces alimentary system as an example, submucosal lymphoid nodules located in the distal jejunum and ileum that surround groups of intestinal crypts are assigned a specific name, gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT), but are also commonly known as Peyer's patches ( Fig. 4-3) . These nodules are composed of lymphocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells. In GALT (Peyer's patches), nodules are covered by modified epithelial cells of intestinal crypts called follicle-associated epithelium (FAE) and its microfold cells (M cells) . M cells are the interface between materials in the lumen of intestinal crypts and the lymphoid nodules and function to transfer antigens in the lumen of the intestine across the mucosa to dendritic cells and immune cells like macrophages and lymphocytes in the nodule. Peyer's patches (GALT) have afferent lymphatic vessels that drain to regional mesenteric lymph nodes. Cells similar to M cells likely cover lymphoid nodules in most mucosae and perform a similar function at the luminal interface. (1). Bacterial proteins (virulence factors) act to allow them to penetrate the mucus layer and come into contact with the mucosal epithelium (2). Immunoglobulin (IgA) secreted by mature plasma cells in the lamina propria passes through mucosal epithelial cells into the lumen and can act as an \"opsonizing\" defense mechanism, thus preventing infection. Bacteria then interact with mucosal epithelial cells, dendritic cells, or microfold cells (M cells) (3). They then encounter lymphoid cells in the lamina propria or Peyer's patches (4) and spread in lymphocytes or as free virus in lymph from this location via afferent lymphatic vessels to regional lymph nodes (5). Note the absence of a mucus layer over M cells and follicle-associated epithelium. Also see Figure When infectious fomites are inhaled, they first encounter the nasal turbinates. The movement of air through the turbinates causes centrifugal turbulence that forces them against mucosae, where they are trapped in the overlying mucus layer for removal by the mucociliary apparatus. If the size of fomites allows them to pass through the turbinates and be carried to the pharynx, larynx, trachea, or bronchi, inertial turbulence forces fomites against airway mucosae, where they are trapped in the mucus layer for removal. Inertial turbulence occurs when a laminar stream of airflow is disrupted by a septum within the conductive portion of the respiratory system when airways branch. When the flow is split by a septum, the flow rotates centrifugally on either side of the septum and forces fomites against mucosae. Depending on the species, airways can branch 23 times en route from the trachea to the alveoli. The O 2 -CO 2 exchange portion of the respiratory system (the bronchioles, alveolar ducts, and alveoli) is not ciliated and has no protective mucus layer because of its gas exchange function. The outcome of these turbulence mechanisms is to trap infectious fomites in the mucus layer overlying ciliated mucosal epithelial cells. When infectious fomites are trapped in the mucus layer, they are (1) acted on by other components of the innate immune system, such as phagocytes like alveolar macrophages and neutrophils, and microbicidal molecules, such as lysozyme and immunoglobulins, and (2) removed by the mucociliary apparatus (see Chapter 9).",

The mucus layer, produced by goblet cells and submucosal glands, is biphasic and consists of a luminal viscoelastic or gel layer used to trap infectious fomites and a serous inner layer in which the cilia of ciliated mucosal epithelial cells beat. The tips of the cilia just slightly enter the gel layer and their beating moves the gel and fomites. In the nasal cavity and sinuses, cilia move mucus and debris downward toward the pharynx for swallowing; in the conductive portion of the respiratory system, cilia move mucus and debris upward toward the pharynx for swallowing. The directionality of mucous flow is determined by the rhythmic unidirectional beating pattern of the cilia. If the mucus layer and/or the mucociliary apparatus are dysfunctional, gravity of the respiratory system and cause disease. When inhaled, larger fomites, such as those containing bacteria and fungi, are deposited and trapped in the nasal turbinates, whereas in a gradient of descending size, smaller ones are able to reach the pharynx, larynx, trachea, and bronchi before they are deposited and trapped in mucosae. The nasal cavity and turbinates trap 70% to 80% of particulate matter approximately 3 to 5 \u00b5m or greater in diameter and 60% of particulate matter 2 \u00b5m or greater but cannot trap particles with sizes below 1 \u00b5m in diameter. In a normal functioning respiratory system, only fomites of approximately 1 \u00b5m or less in diameter, such as viruses and some bacteria, can be inhaled into bronchioles, alveolar ducts, and alveoli, which are the oxygen-carbon dioxide (O 2 -CO 2 ) exchange portion of the respiratory system.

Receptors expressed on target cells are usually those involved in normal function of cells and as examples may include receptors for complement, phospholipids, and carbohydrates. Once the proteins are bound to receptors, a sequence of steps facilitated by virulence factors is initiated that results in the colonization of the surface of these cells or invasion of the cells often through endocytosis/ phagocytosis. The microbe then establishes control of the normal metabolic systems of these cells and uses them or their resources to replicate in and/or spread to other cells and/or organ systems.

The skin is a (1) thick and tenacious physical (especially the epidermis) and (2) biologic barrier protecting the body against microbes via (1) its dryness and acidity, (2) sebum (oils), and (3) normal bacterial flora, which compete against microbes for resources and for receptors expressed on target cells. Microbes encounter the skin (also mucocutaneous junctions) via direct contact and the dermis and subcutaneous tissues (see Chapter 17) via penetration through abrasions, scratches, and bite wounds or through bites (proboscis) of insect vectors like mosquitoes that spread the agent into subcutaneous tissues such as muscle, blood and lymphatic vessels, and ECM and connective tissue. In these tissues, microbes encounter a limited range of target cells such as epithelial lymphocytes, dendritic cells, and/or neural cells. In some diseases, leukocyte trafficking ultimately returns the microbe back to mucosae, mucocutaneous junction, or skin initially encountered at the portal of entry.

An additional means of systemic spread for specific microbes is within the nervous system. Microbes can interact with nerve endings within mucosae, mucocutaneous junctions, or skin during the initial beachhead encounter, enter these nerve endings likely via endocytosis, acquire protection from the animal's defense mechanisms within the neuron, and then use retrograde and anterograde axonal transport mechanisms to be spread throughout the nervous system protected within neurons to reach their destination target cell (usually but not always located within the CNS or PNS).",

Microbes recognition of microbes to their phagocytosis and killing and are discussed in many chapters of this book. Examples of genetic disorders of the innate immune system that predispose animals to infectious disease, most commonly bacterial diseases, include leukocyte adhesion deficiencies and granulocytopathy syndromes. Leukocyte adhesion deficiency occurs in dogs and cattle and has an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance. It is characterized by alterations in the leukocyte adhesion cascade (see Chapter 3) involving deficiencies or dysfunction of integrins and selectins resulting in the inability of neutrophils to adhere to endothelial cells in the wall of blood vessels and migrate into sites of bacterial infection. Granulocytopathy syndrome occurs in dogs and cattle and has an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance. It is characterized by alterations in the ability of neutrophils to kill bacteria in phagosomes and is linked to reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) concentrations that may arise from a metabolic anomaly in the hexose monophosphate shunt. This deficiency may lead to reduced concentrations of hydrogen peroxide in phagosome-lysosome fusion and the bactericidal capability of the neutrophil. The process of phagocytosis is usually normal. Affected animals have shortened life span, long-term febrile disease, dermatitis, oral ulcers, lymphadenitis, and poor healing, attributable to irresolvable and repeated bacterial infections. Genetic disorders of the innate immune system can also be caused by failure of leukocytes to correctly develop and mature in the bone marrow. Cyclic hematopoiesis occurs in dogs and has an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance. It is caused by an abnormality of stem cells in the bone marrow resulting in periodic declines, every 10 to 12 days, in neutrophil concentrations followed by hyperplasia and a return to normal. Abnormal concentrations of purine and pyrimidine metabolites in affected stems cells suggest that a metabolic derangement in purine or pyrimidine metabolism may be the cause of this genetic disorder. This outcome increases susceptibility to bacterial infection, often leading to periodic fever, joint pain, or other signs of ocular, respiratory, or skin infections.

It is essentially acute inflammation and (1) the cellular and chemical mediators associated with the process, such as phagocytic cells like macrophages, neutrophils, and dendritic cells; (2) effector cells, such as T lymphocytes and mast cells; (3) chemical mediators of the complement system; and (4) the vascular system. The purpose of acute inflammation is to dilute and isolate microbes in edema fluid and fibrin, phagocytose and kill them, and process and present their antigens to effector cells of the adaptive immune response. When epithelial cells, endothelial cells, or mucosal or cutaneous macrophages of barrier systems are injured by or infected with microbes, they release large quantities of cytokines into the surrounding tissues. These cytokines recruit, via chemotaxis, inflammatory cells from capillaries in vascularized ECM tissues and cause vasodilation and increased permeability of these blood vessels (i.e., edema fluid and fibrin). Inflammatory cells also release cytokines and other chemical mediators that act to recruit additional inflammatory cells, activate the complement cascade to identify bacteria and kill microbes, promote phagocytosis of dead cells and microbes by phagocytic cells, and activate the adaptive immune system through antigen processing and presentation to immune cells such as T and B lymphocytes. Phagocytic and effector cells of the acute inflammatory response are recruited from capillaries and migrate along a chemoattractant gradient formed by chemical mediators and molecules released from microbes to the inflammatory focus. In inflammatory foci, these cells express TLRs, also known as pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), that recognize molecules on infectious agents called PAMPs (see Chapters 3 and 5). These cells also express IL-1 receptors that act in concert with PRRs to initiate and sustain the innate immune response through phagocytosis.",

Furthermore, they inhibit innate and adaptive immune responses, allowing the bacterium to evade defense mechanisms and also to proliferate in harsh environments. Bacterial virulence factors act as proteases, lipases, deoxyribonucleases (DNases), toxins, physiologic mediators (inhibitors or enhancers), lytic agents, adhesion factors, biofilms, bacterial capsules made of carbohydrates, and antiphagocytic factors (see Table 4 -1). Bacterial virulence is determined in part by the type and number of factors the bacterium expresses to successfully complete its life cycle in an animal. In general, virulence factors are coded for by more than one bacterial gene. Other things that can indirectly influence the success of these virulence factors include physical and environmental stressors, such as weather, access to food and water, and management (shipping) or housing conditions (ventilation, humidity, or overcrowding) .",

Once in the mucus layer, bacteria may be phagocytized by macrophages, lymphocytes, and/or dendritic cells as they migrate in, on, and through the mucus. As these phagocytes containing bacteria migrate, they interact with epithelial cells, phagocytotic and immune cells in the lamina propria and submucosa, ECM, and endothelial cells. These interactions allow bacteria, if they \"escape\" from phagocytes, to interact with all of these cell types and infect those required for them to complete their life cycles. However, in many diseases, it is unclear how bacteria ultimately invade or penetrate the mucus layer to gain access to mucosal epithelial cells (target cells). Several mechanisms, some regulated by virulence factors, are likely used to reach mucosal epithelial cells, including (1) motility, (2) digestion and consumption of the mucus layer, and (3) random discovery of mucosae lacking a mucus layer. As examples in the alimentary system, some bacteria, such as the spirochetes, are motile and can penetrate the mucus layer and reach target cells. Other bacteria, such as Clostridium septicum, digest the mucus layer with bacterial enzymes and then consume oligosaccharides such as N-acetylglucosamine, galactose, and N-acetylgalactosamine in the mucus layer as a carbon source during intense periods of replication. Finally, some bacteria use M cells to gain access to target cells; these cells are not covered by mucus, and their surface membranes and receptors are available to passing microbes.",

The outcome depends on the virulence (i.e., virulence factors) of the pathogen and the resistance or susceptibility (i.e., genes) of the animal. Resistance or susceptibility to disease in healthy animals is derived from (1) innate defenses such as cellular and mucous barrier systems, acute inflammation (including neutrophil phagocytosis), the monocyte-macrophage system (phagocytosis), and normal bacterial flora and (2) adaptive defenses provided by the immune system such as passive immunity via colostrum and active immunity via T and B lymphocytes. In general, bacterial pathogenicity is determined by two characteristics: (1) the bacterium's ability to colonize cells and (2) its ability to produce toxins and damage cells and their ECM tissues such as collagen. To colonize cells, bacteria use mechanisms such as adhesion, multiplication, colonization, tissue invasion, and circumvention of animal defense mechanisms. To damage cells via toxins, microbes use mechanisms such as cytolysis and invasion of vascularized ECM tissues (locally or systemically) incited by bacteria-derived exotoxins (Grampositive bacteria) and endotoxins (Gram-negative bacteria). Virulence factors determine the sum of the characteristics that allow bacteria to cause disease and thus provide a pathogenicity profile or fingerprint for each bacterium.",

            "text": "Bacterial virulence factors are molecules that influence interactions between bacteria and target cells and/or substances, including processes such as adherence to cell membranes; colonization and Ligand-receptor interactions are likely common to most bacterial diseases; however, in many veterinary diseases, specific bacterial ligands and their target cell receptors have not been identified. The attachment of sufficient numbers of bacteria at the appropriate portal of entry initiates an early stage of bacterial infection termed colonization. After colonization, bacteria produce another group of virulence factors called invasins, or spreading factors. These factors include hyaluronidase, collagenase, kinases, lecithinase, and phospholipase and act to break down barrier systems formed by mucosae (mucus layer) and skin, cell junctional complexes, and ECM molecules like collagen. Additionally, other virulence factors that injure and/or kill cells include proteases and lipases; DNases, which break down DNA; and hemolysins that destroy cells, such as red blood cells. Invasiveness and invasins allow bacteria to spread rapidly into and through intercellular spaces and protect themselves in safe areas such lamina propria isolated from unfavorable host environments or host-derived defensive molecules. As examples, Clostridium chauvoei, the bacterium that causes blackleg in cattle, produces sufficient lecithinases and phospholipases to punch holes in cell membranes of skeletal muscle and cause lysis of myocytes and endothelial cells. Listeria monocytogenes, the cause of listeriosis in the nervous system of cattle, produces invasins that induce endocytosis of the bacterium for colonization by acting on target cell actin filaments. Other proteins of bacteria, such as surface components and polysaccharide capsules, are virulence factors that allow bacteria to avoid phagocytosis and evade recognition by cells of the innate and/or adaptive immune systems. They disrupt or block one or more steps used by neutrophils, monocytes, or macrophages in the phagocytic process such as initial contact, engulfment, phagosome formation, phagosome-lysosome fusion, and killing and digestion. As examples, Streptococcus pyogenes, a cause of bovine mastitis, uses M protein and a hyaluronic acid capsule to inhibit phagocytosis and the same hyaluronic acid capsule to evade recognition of the immune system. Finally, some bacteria components, and other miscellaneous proteins of bacteria, assist them in adhering to, colonizing, and invading epithelia at portals of entry (toxigenesis will be discussed in the next section). However, because epithelial cells of skin and mucosae are replaced continually (\u224848-hour life span) and these systems have defensive mechanisms such as peristalsis, unidirectional mucociliary undulations, and micturition, bacteria must be able to adhere to, colonize (replicate), and/or invade into or between these epithelial cells in order to avoid being swept away. Attachment occurs when membrane proteins of bacteria called adhesins (a broad term) bind to receptors on cell membranes of mucosae and skin. Attachment is a typical ligandreceptor interaction; a protein on the bacterium binds to a receptor on a target cell. Some bacteria express adhesins, such as microbial surface cell recognition adhesion matrix molecules, that bind the bacterium to the surface of the cell. Other bacteria use extensions of their cell membranes called fimbriae or pili to bind to animal cells. Fimbriae and pili have adhesins, such as pilus-associated proteins, fimbrial antigens, or fimbrial adhesins that bind to receptors on microvilli of the glycocalyx or in the mucus layer ( Fig. 4-16 ). Fimbriae and pili may also act to inhibit phagocytosis. For example, uropathogenic and enterotoxic Escherichia coli, causes of urinary tract infections and diarrhea in animals, express fimbrial (type 1, P, and S/F1C) and pilus (K99) adhesins, respectively. In the urinary tract, P fimbria is an important attachment adhesin and allows the bacterium to attach to the transitional epithelium (mucosa) of the bladder and cause the disease known as acute necrohemorrhagic urocystitis. Other virulence factors, such as \u03b1-hemolysin and cytotoxic necrotizing factor type 1, cause necrosis and hemorrhage later in the disease process. In the small intestine, K99 pilus adhesin allows E. coli to adhere to enterocytes and reduces their loss in number via intestinal peristalsis. When large numbers of E. coli are attached to the small intestine, they produce other virulence factors, such as enterotoxin, that act directly on enterocytes, leading to diarrhea. diseases). Fungi also have virulence factors that produce toxins that cause tissue injury and lysis. Examples include mycotoxins/aflatoxins. Exotoxins and Lipoteichoic Acid. Exotoxins (usually from Gram-positive bacteria) are secreted from viable bacteria and are potent toxins. Some act directly on cells to cause cytolysis; others act via the A-B toxin system and bind to cell membranes with a receptor (B subunit) and deliver a second toxic molecule (A subunit) into the cytoplasm. As examples, A-B toxin systems are used in botulism (C. botulinum), tetanus (C. tetani), and diseases caused by Corynebacterium spp. Vacuolating toxin of Helicobacter pylori, E. coli hemolysin, and superantigens belonging to S. pyogenes and Staphylococcus aureus are surface-acting exotoxins. Surface-acting exotoxins bind to cell membranes and form pores through which cell lysis occurs. S. aureus also has pore-forming cytotoxins called \u03b1-toxin. Another virulence factor, lipoteichoic acid, binds to endothelial cells, interacts with circulating antibodies, activates the complement cascade, and triggers the release of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species, acid hydrolases, highly cationic proteinases, bactericidal cationic peptides, growth factors, and cytotoxic cytokines from neutrophils and macrophages. Lipoteichoic acid is also located in the cell wall of Gram-positive bacteria like S. aureus. It behaves as a Gram-positive endotoxin because its actions mimic LPS.",

They can be readily transferred horizontally between bacteria (e.g., virulence factors for antibiotic resistance) via pathogenicity islands (PAIs) and/or virulence plasmids. PAIs are clusters of genes that code for virulence factors found in bacterial chromosomes. Virulence plasmids are clusters of self-replicating extrachromosomal genes for virulence factors located in plasmids within the cytoplasm of the bacteria. Most bacteria have only one chromosome but may contain hundreds of copies of a specific virulence plasmid. Plasmids replicate independently of cell division, and when a bacterium containing plasmids divides, the plasmids distribute randomly between the two resulting bacteria. Chromosomal or plasmid genes express virulence factors such as bacterial adhesins, colonization factors, protein toxins like hemolysins, other types of toxins, and molecules that affect the innate and adaptive immune responses. Strains of bacteria lacking PAIs and/or virulence plasmids usually do not cause disease. The number and type of virulence factors in a given bacterial strain are constantly changing, usually through genomic selection of those factors that favor the survival of the bacterium in the animal host. Each bacterial genera and strains within genera have their own unique virulence factor profile; therefore the total number of determinates that have been identified in all bacteria genera combined are in the hundreds. As an example, strains of R. equi that cause disease have chromosomal virulence factors for capsular polysaccharide, cholesterol oxidase, phospholipase C, lecithinase, and cell wall mycolic acids and plasmid virulence factors for virulenceassociated protein (VAP).",

This means that one out of every 100 million to 1 trillion bacteria in an infection develops resistance through a mutation.

In summary, the mechanisms of injury in enteric colibacillosis are (1) nonstructural alterations in the function of cell membrane ion and fluid transport systems (ETEC) and (2) structural alterations of cell membranes characterized by acute coagulative necrosis caused by bacterial toxins and by acute inflammation and its mediators and degradative enzymes (EPEC and EHEC). Enterotoxigenic and enteropathogenic strains do not invade mucosal enterocytes, whereas enterohemorrhagic strains do invade mucosal enterocytes. Enterotoxigenic strains secrete toxins that functionally, but not structurally, affect enterocytes, causing alterations in electrolyte and fluid secretion that result in a secretory diarrhea. Enteropathogenic strains structurally affect the microvillus border of enterocytes, causing alterations in electrolyte and fluid secretion that result in an osmotic diarrhea (malabsorption) and a less significant secretory diarrhea. Enterohemorrhagic strains structurally affect the enterocytes of the colon, causing cell lysis (necrosis), inflammation, and hemorrhage that lead to reduced absorption of colonic fluids and a malabsorption diarrhea. Endotoxins (LPS) likely directly or indirectly play a role in diseases caused by these three strains. There are no gross lesions in enterotoxigenic colibacillosis, whereas in enteropathogenic and enterohemorrhagic colibacillosis, mucosae are rough and granular (enterocyte necrosis, villus atrophy) with areas of hemorrhage, acute inflammation, and fibrin exudation. are readily available for absorption. Endotoxin, especially when in the blood, can lead to inflammation, capillary damage, vasculitis, thrombosis, intravascular coagulation, tissue degradation and infarction, endotoxic shock, and lysis. These mechanisms likely underlie the occurrence of acute adrenal cortical hemorrhage and necrosis (see observed in endotoxemia with E. coli and other coliform infections.",

The mechanism of injury in salmonellosis is acute coagulative necrosis of cells caused by bacterial toxins and by acute inflammation and its mediators and degradative enzymes. Three forms of salmonellosis occur: peracute, acute, and chronic. Gross lesions in the peracute form include petechiation and a blue discoloration (cyanosis) of the skin, fibrinous polyserositis, and disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (see Fig. 7 -118). These lesions are rooted in injury of the vascular system with vasculitis and thrombosis caused by bacterial toxins. In the acute form, lesions affect mucosae of the small intestine, large intestine, and cecum (fibrinonecrotic ileotyphlocolitis) and are characterized by a rough and granular mucosal surface (necrosis) mixed with mucus, fibrin, and occasionally blood (see Fig. 7 -118). The content is malodorous (septic tank odor). This pattern of injury is caused by bacterial toxins, acute inflammation, and their effects on enterocytes and blood vessels within the lamina propria. Many of these processes are enabled by virulence factors encoded on \"Salmonella pathogenicity islands\" on its chromosome. Bacteria can spread via the portal vein to the liver, leading to the formation of foci of bacteria-and toxininduced necrosis and inflammation (paratyphoid nodules) (see . This spread likely occurs via leukocyte trafficking and infection of Kupffer cells, but bacteremia may also occur. Leukocyte trafficking also spreads the bacteria to mesenteric and systemic lymph nodes and the gallbladder (fibrinous cholecystitis). In the chronic form, injury is associated with discrete foci of necrosis and ulceration of mucosae (button ulcers). These lesions are rooted in injury of the vascular system with vasculitis and thrombosis caused by bacterial toxins diffusing within the submucosa of the intestine.",

The bacterium is swallowed and gains access via peristalsis to the mucus layer and mucosae of the intestines. Salmonella spp. appear to use two mechanisms to colonize mucosae and gain access to the lamina propria and its capillary beds. The first mechanism uses M cells in intestinal crypts. Because a mucus layer is absent over M cells, the bacteria have direct contact with apically positioned cell membranes of M cells. The second mechanism uses apically positioned cell membranes of enterocytes to gain access to these cells; however, these cells are covered with a mucus layer. Because Salmonella spp. are motile bacteria (flagella-virulence factor), they likely can penetrate through the mucus layer and gain access to these membranes. The Enteropathogenic Escherichia coli. EPEC colonizes mucosae in a manner similar to that used by ETEC. EPEC does not produce LT or ST enterotoxins but does express adhesins such as P and S fimbriae, EPEC adherence factor, and intimin (nonfimbrial outer membrane protein). Integrins may serve as target cell membrane receptors for intimin, and this interaction appears to produce a tight bond between the bacterium and the enterocyte. After colonization and growth, bacterial virulence factors injure the brush border, leading to the loss of microvilli at the site of colonization. Such virulence factors appear to involve processes that disrupt cytoskeletal functions of the microvilli through interference with actin filaments, actin polymerization, and other cytoskeletal components and by causing alterations in intracellular calcium concentrations. This type of change has been called attaching and effacing injury and has resulted in naming the bacterium attaching and effacing E. coli. Injury to and loss of microvilli leads to decreased digestive enzyme activity in the glycocalyx (osmotic diarrhea) and disruption of ion transport systems (secretory diarrhea). EPEC also secretes bacterial proteins and likely injects them into the cytoplasm of enterocytes through a type III secretion system. These proteins, EspA, EspB, and EspD, activate a number of signal transduction pathways in the target cell, which appear to be involved in the pathogenesis of microvillus disruption. Additionally, acute inflammation occurs at the site of binding between the bacterium and the microvillus, likely contributing to the attaching and effacing lesion. Some attaching and effacing strains also secrete a virulence factor called verotoxin, which kills enterocytes and cells of the lamina propria (vascularized ECM tissues), leading to mucosal erosions and ulcers, intestinal edema and hemorrhage, and increased denuded mucosal surfaces for the absorption of endotoxins (LPS).",

EHEC appears to colonize the mucus layer and mucosae in a manner similar to that used by the other two strains of the bacterium; however, enterocytes of the colon are the primary target cells. This specificity could be mediated through ligand-receptor interactions, and bacterial fimbriae have been shown to act as adhesins and attach to enterocyte cell membranes. Chemical gradients, such as the concentration of iron in target cells, could also provide the basis for colonic specificity. Once attached to colonic enterocytes, the bacterium replicates in large numbers and secretes a verotoxin that elicits an intense acute inflammatory response. It is also able to invade enterocytes, and verotoxin kills the cells. EHEC does not produce LT or ST enterotoxins, but Shiga toxins (Stxs) or Shiga-like toxins are virulence factors in some bacterial strains. Thus mucosal lesions (hemorrhagic colitis) characteristic of this strain of E. coli appear to result from a combination of inflammatory enzymes and mediators and toxins, all of which cause cell lysis and expose the underlying denuded lamina propria to a variety of harmful luminal molecules such as LPS that and other chemoattractants for neutrophils into surrounding vascularized ECM. It appears that the form of disease (peracute, acute, or chronic) that occurs depends on which steps used in the chronology (as described previously) are emphasized through the expression of virulence factors by different strains of Salmonella spp. The peracute form likely favors spread to regional lymph nodes and then systemically with the release of toxins leading to vascular injury, failure of the circulatory system, and lysis. The acute form likely favors mucosal adherence and colonization leading to mucosal necrosis mediated by bacterial toxins. Through this process and the acute inflammation that ensues, capillary beds in the lamina propria are permeable and likely bacteria, bacterial toxins, and bacteria-infected macrophages enter the venous circulatory system and spread via the portal vein to the liver. The chronic form likely favors invasion of the lamina propria and submucosa (motile bacteria) with direct effects on the vasculature that supplies the intestine with blood. However, it is possible that button ulcers observed in this form are a manifestation of septicemia with attachment of bacteria to vascular endothelium resulting in vasculitis, thrombosis, ischemia, and infarction. The lesions and clinical signs that occur in diseases caused by Salmonella spp. are in part attributable to (1) an enterotoxin (exotoxin) that produces a secretory diarrhea, (2) a cytotoxin that inhibits protein synthesis, and (3) endotoxins and LPSs that cause membrane injury and cell lysis. Acute inflammation and cell and tissue injury that ensue are also important causes of the lesions.",

The vegetative form of C. perfringens can be a normal inhabitant of the alimentary system of domestic animals. It appears that under the proper conditions in the intestine that are usually linked to changes in the diet or the ingestion of an energy source rich in carbohydrates, spores germinate into vegetative forms and proliferate or the ingested vegetative form proliferates. It has been shown experimentally that dietary trypsin can inactivate \u03b2toxin, thus it is thought that diets deficient in trypsin may increase the likelihood of disease. Additionally, sudden dietary change can also alter the composition of normal intestinal microflora, providing opportunities for the vegetative form of the bacterium to proliferate and produce toxins. Vegetative forms are nonmotile and gain access to mucosae via random motion from peristalsis. They colonize the mucus layer by using bacterial proteases to expose receptors in mucus and then use bacterial adhesins to bind to these receptors. Within bacterium must adhere to the apical surfaces of M cells and enterocytes to begin the process of colonizing the intestine, which is a process mediated through ligand-receptor interactions. Although unproved, it is probable that one or some of the fimbriae possessed by Salmonella spp. are involved in the initial adherence between the bacterium and these cells. It is thought, though unconfirmed, that fimbriae may determine susceptibility of the various strains of Salmonella spp. for animal species and for specific target cells within each species. Which fimbriae (virulence factor) are used to bind to target cells may vary depending on whether the target cell is an M cell or an enterocyte. Additionally, PAMP and PRRs (also known as TLRs [Toll-like receptors]) are probably involved. Once bound to target cell membrane, a type III secretion system is used to inject bacterial proteins into the target cell that stimulate phagocytosis through the mobilization of actin filaments in the cytoplasm. Colonization of mucosae only occurs if LPS is present in the bacterial cell wall, and it likely plays a role in adherence to target cells through its participation in cell wall stability and resistance to bile salts, cell surface hydrophobicity, and the correct insertion and folding of membrane proteins such as those that occur in fimbriae.",

Once in Peyer's patches, macrophages infected with bacteria die and release bacteria that will infect additional macrophages through ligand-receptor interactions.

These macrophages are often recruited as monocytes from the systemic circulation as a component of the acute inflammatory response. Once infected with the bacterium, macrophages migrate in efferent lymphatic vessels via leukocyte trafficking to regional mesenteric lymph nodes using mechanisms similar to those described in Peyer's patches and then systemically via the thoracic duct and circulatory system.

Animals can ingest endospores that subsequently germinate into vegetative forms in the alimentary tract. However, animals can also ingest vegetative forms as the result of environmental conditions that allow the vegetative form to persist for a limited period of time. Heavy rain after a drought can cause the germination of endospores in areas contaminated with endospores and the multiplication of vegetative forms.

The sequence of steps from ingestion of endospores or vegetative forms to the occurrence of lesions is largely unknown. It has been suggested that endospores can gain access to mucosae and lamina propria via ulcers, cuts, and puncture wounds of the alimentary system, geminate into vegetative forms, colonize the tissue, and secrete toxins causing disease. It is also likely that vegetative forms gain access to regional mesenteric lymph nodes via afferent lymphatic vessels as cell-free bacteria or within macrophages via phagocytosis that migrate via leukocyte trafficking in lymphatic vessels to these nodes. Vegetative forms probably use mechanisms discussed later to cause disease in the injured mucosae. Alternatively, the need for mucosal injury as an initiating step in the disease is conceivable. Hypothetically, three possible mechanisms could result in the production of vegetative forms, toxins, and lesions: 1. Endospores could be trapped in the mucus layer of the mucosa, endospores germinate to vegetative forms, vegetative forms use mucus to grow and replicate, and vegetative forms produce toxins that diffuse into the mucosa and submucosa, resulting in lesions. 2. Endospores could be trapped in the mucus layer of the mucosa, phagocytosed by macrophages or dendritic cells, and carried to Peyer's patches, where they germinate into vegetative forms, and vegetative forms produce toxins that diffuse into the mucosa and submucosa, resulting in lesions. 3. Endospores are phagocytosed by M cells and carried to Peyer's patches, where they germinate into vegetative forms, and vegetative forms produce toxins that diffuse into the mucosa and submucosa, resulting in lesions. 7 Primary virulence factors produced by B. anthracis are in plasmid genes and include those that form the capsule and anthrax toxins. The capsule is important in establishing the infection, whereas anthrax toxins cause the lesions, disease, and lysis. The capsule consists of poly-d-glutamic acid that is nontoxic, protects the bacterium from destructive antibodies and bactericidal components of the mucus layer, bacteria are protected from acids and enzymes in intestinal content. The bacterium also consumes mucus as an energy source for bacterial growth and replication, and this process is thought to activate bacterial genes that regulate the production of toxins. Once the mucus layer is colonized, bacteria then interact with microvilli of enterocytes by attachment and retraction of type IV pili (gliding motility) and eventually attach to the apical surfaces of enterocytes. Attachment is likely mediated by ligand-receptor interactions.",

At this phase of the disease, injury is primarily limited to enterocytes. Once mucosae are colonized, bacteria replicate in immense numbers, and the disease enters a second phase characterized by the production of abundant potent cytotoxins, which spread via diffusion as a wave into the mucosa, lamina propria, submucosa, and muscle layers. Some clinical forms of enterotoxemia remain in the first phase of the disease; others progress into the second phase. Discussion of these various clinical forms is outside the scope of this chapter. Potent cytotoxins produced by the bacteria include \u03b1-, \u03b2-, \u03b5-, and \u03b9-toxins (alpha [CPA], beta [CPB] , epsilon [ETX] , and iota [ITX]), which behave as enterocyte membrane toxins (\u03b1, \u03b2), such as phospholipases, lecithinases, and pore-forming toxins, as well as ECM toxins, such as collagenase, hyaluronidase, and sialidase. \u03b5-Toxin has the unique ability to increase enterocyte and endothelial cell permeability by acting on the cytoskeleton and probably altering the function of junctional complexes, thus affecting the absorption of toxins by the vascular system, resulting in systemic effects. \u03b9-Toxin disrupts the cytoskeleton, which leads to cell lysis. Because of the abundance of toxins produced in the second phase of enterotoxemia, toxins freely move in the intestinal lumen via peristalsis to interact with uncolonized normal enterocytes; thus the lesions are quickly spread to other areas within the intestine. Toxins cause lysis and sloughing of enterocytes of villi and crypts followed by further colonization by bacteria, additional proliferation and toxin production, and toxin-induced massive necrosis resulting in structural breakdown and hemorrhage of the entire intestinal wall. Because \u03b5-toxin is a permease that alters cell permeability, the vascular beds in affected intestinal tissues readily absorb toxins from the lumen of the intestine into the circulatory system. Toxins are then carried to the brain, kidney, and other tissues in which the increase in vascular permeability leads to the release of blood plasma containing toxins into the interstitium and body cavities, resulting in edema and effusions. In the brain and kidney these toxins cause focal symmetric encephalomalacia (see Fig. 14-96) and pulpy kidney disease (see Fig. 11 -49), respectively. However, it appears that the mechanisms leading to these two diseases occur in the first phase or early in the second phase of enterotoxemia before toxin-induced massive necrosis of the intestine occurs.",

Gross lesions include granulomatous enteritis and mesenteric granulomatous lymphadenitis, lymphangitis, and lymphangiectasia (see Fig. 7 -162). Granulomatous enteritis is characterized by a thickened intestinal wall, most commonly affecting the ileum and ileal-cecal junction with a yellowwhite exudate exemplified by infiltrating granulomatous inflammatory cells. Mesenteric granulomatous lymphadenitis is characterized by enlarged mesenteric lymph nodes that on cut surfaces have discrete and coalescing areas of yellow-white caseous exudate, occasionally mineralized, infiltrating, and compressing contiguous parenchyma.",

Anthrax toxins behave as an A-B toxin system and consist of three exotoxins that act together to cause cell lysis. One exotoxin, called protective antigen (PA), the B part of the A-B toxin, facilitates the entry of itself into cells via endocytosis and then creates a pore in the cell membrane through which the remaining two toxins, edema factor (EF) and lethal factor (LF), the A component of the A-B toxin, can enter the cell. Exotoxins must first bind to receptors on target cells. PA binds to two different cell surface receptors, tumor endothelial marker 8 (TEM8) and capillary morphogenesis protein 2 (CMG2). These receptors appear to explain the vascular orientation of the disease and the circulatory system collapse that results. In addition to vascular tissues, these receptors are also commonly expressed on cells in many other organ systems, likely accounting for the various forms (inhalation, cutaneous, and gastrointestinal) of anthrax. Once inside cells, PA combines with edema factor to form edema toxin, which disrupts cell membrane water and electrolyte transport systems, resulting in edema, and also blocks phagocytosis of vegetative forms by neutrophils and macrophages. Additionally, PA combines with lethal factor to form lethal toxin. This toxin stimulates the production of a variety of cytokines that act to cause cell lysis, especially affecting phagocytic cells such as macrophages and endothelial cells of capillaries. Because of injury to mucosae and lamina propria, capillary beds in the ECM can absorb edema and lethal toxins, as well as a variety of intestinal endotoxins. Cytokines, anthrax toxins, and endotoxins have profound systemic effects on the cardiovascular system, all of which contribute to cardiogenic and circulatory shock and lysis. Chromosomal genes of the vegetative form of the bacterium also express a capsule virulence factor, which makes it resistant to phagocytosis by mucosa-associated tissue macrophages. Additionally, the bacterium has several chromosomal virulence factors for hemolysins, phospholipases, and iron acquisition proteins that can contribute to or cause cell lysis.",

Bacteria probably bind to receptors on luminal surfaces of M cells and are then transported in endocytotic vesicles to the basal membranes of the cell and released into the Peyer's patches, where they can be phagocytosed by tissue macrophages or dendritic cells. Unlike most other regions of the intestine, the luminal surface of M cells lacks a covering of mucus. Therefore bacteria have direct access to M cells. It is likely that ligand-receptor mechanisms (as discussed in the section on the Respiratory System, Mediastinum, and Pleurae) are applicable to M cells and tissue macrophages in Peyer's patches. Once tissue macrophages are infected, the pathogenesis of the disease appears bind to the surface of macrophages and serve as a ligand to facilitate phagocytosis by macrophages.

When a phagolysosome forms, the fused lysosome releases an acidic cytosol, proteases, and antibacterial substances, such as defensins and toxic oxygen and nitrogen intermediates, into the phagosome, all of which can injure and kill the bacterium. In general, mycobacterial species can (1) inhibit acidification of the phagosome, phagosomelysosome fusion, and lysosomal enzyme activities; (2) block injury from toxic oxygen and nitrogen intermediates; and (3) suppress the ability of macrophages to be activated by cytokines such as INF-\u03b3. Although highly probable, it is not known which or if any of these mechanisms are used by M. avium ssp. paratuberculosis. Tissue macrophages, once infected with the bacterium, are activated and begin to secrete proinflammatory cytokines that act to recruit and activate additional macrophages.

Mycobacteria secrete iron-chelating proteins called exochelins, iron-reductases, and potentially siderophores (i.e., virulence factors) and use these enzymes to acquire iron from ferritin stored in macrophages. Additionally, as the severity of inflammation increases, there is a concurrent increase in the concentration of ferritin available for use by the bacterium in cells and tissues in the areas of inflammation.

During chewing the bacterium is carried through the mucosa into submucosal connective tissues via penetrating wounds such as those caused by sharp foreign bodies like sticks or wires.

Little is known about how virulence factors, ligand-receptor interactions, target cells, toxins, capsule antiphagocytic molecules, or other factors contribute to the pathogenicity of this bacterium.

The bacterium is swallowed and gains access via peristalsis to the intestine, especially the cecum and colon. Virulence factors that block its destruction, by bile and digestive enzymes as examples, during transit in the small intestine to the cecum and colon are unknown. Goblet cell mucus is important as a physical matrix and as a chemical substrate for colonization by the bacterium; thus goblet cells play a central role in the pathogenesis of lesions affecting mucosal epithelial cells and their junctional complexes. B. hyodysenteriae, an anaerobic motile spirochete, is able to actively move through the mucus layer to gain access to mucosal epithelial and goblet cells. It is unclear why the bacterium infects the cecum and colon, but it appears that it prefers to initially replicate in mucigen droplets within goblet cells. Mucigen droplets fill the apical cytoplasm of goblet cells, and the nucleus is displaced to the basal region of the cell. Because the relative number of such cells is much greater in the cecum and colon when compared to other segments of the alimentary system, this quantitative difference may account for the location of the lesions. Additionally, mucins (e.g., the fucose and l-serine components) are strong chemoattractants for spirochetes, and because there are significant biochemical and pH differences in mucins, such as those that are synthesized and released from goblet cells, it is plausible that the chemical composition of the mucins may account for the locations of the lesions. Once the bacterium infects mucigen droplets within goblet cells, it appears to be able to activate the goblet cell to increase the production of mucus. Thus there is a large increase in the volume of mucus secreted by these cells so that mucosal surfaces are covered with a thick grayish gelatinous layer. It is unclear how the bacterium activates the goblet cell to produce and release large quantities of mucus. It is plausible that one or more bacterial virulence factors influence the cellular processes of transcription, translation, assembly, and packaging of mucigen droplets, thereby producing abundant quantities of mucus to enhance its opportunity to colonize the mucosa. Concurrently with infecting goblet cells, the bacterium begins the process of colonizing the thickened mucus layer covering the mucosal epithelium. It appears that mucus and its mucins are central to both the colonization and replication processes and result in the accumulation of large numbers of bacteria in close proximity to cell membranes and junctional complexes of mucosal epithelial cells.",

Additionally, highly fermentable feeds favor colonization of the mucus layer by bacteria. Fermentation may provide the bacterium with an energy source or other molecules required for colonization and replication. Colonization is also enhanced by the presence of other anaerobic bacterial species in the mucus layer. The significance of this finding is unclear, but again could be related to these anaerobic species providing molecules required by B. hyodysenteriae for colonization and replication. Finally, because the bacterium is an anaerobe, it synthesizes high concentrations of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide hydrogen (NADH) oxidase (a virulence factor) that is used to protect itself 4-22). It appears that once crypt cells of the proliferative zone are infected with bacteria, the bacterium is able to inhibit the normal maturation of crypt cells, probably through disruption of the cell cycle.

Some strains of the bacterium have SzP, a surface M-like protein, which may through receptor-ligand phenomena determine which organ system is colonized and what types of cells in that organ system are colonized. Other strains of the bacterium may have putative virulence factors such as C5a peptidase, invasins, and fibronectin-binding protein that are thought to contribute to biofilm formation and cell adhesion. It has been shown that some of these virulence factors can be transferred between strains of the bacterium via PAIs through horizontal gene transfer. Once mucosae are colonized and epithelial cells are injured, acute inflammation ensues, leading to lysis of these cells and loss of the ciliated mucosal barrier. Injury to ciliated epithelial cells alters the function of the mucociliary apparatus, allowing the bacterium to gain access to terminal bronchioles and alveoli by dependent settling due to gravity. Herein, bacteria colonize mucosae of the terminal bronchioles and alveoli, spread into vascularized ECM tissues, interact with and injure blood vessels of the air-blood barrier, and leak fibrinogen into the alveoli (fibrinous pneumonia). This process accounts for a fibrinous pneumonia but may not satisfactorily account for the fibrinous polyserositis so characteristic of this disease.",

Additionally, neuraminidase virulence factors that appear to restrict tropism to specific types of phagocytic cells. After phagocytosis by alveolar macrophages, the bacterium is confined within phagosomes. Experimental results from studies on fusion of phagosomes with lysosomes to form phagolysosomes are contradictory. Some studies suggest that R. equi can block the fusion of lysosomes with phagosomes, which allows for the survival, persistence, and replication of bacteria intracellularly. Other studies suggest that R. equi is not able to block phagosomelysosome fusion; however, the bacterium is able to produce molecules that suppress acidification of phagolysosomes, resulting in their survival and replication in alveolar macrophages. The mechanism used to block fusion is unknown but appears to involve bacteriumdirected compartmentalization of the fusion process so that they are selectively isolated from lysosomal effector molecules, such as acid, reactive oxygen, NO compounds, and lysosomal hydrolases within phagosomes. Other proteins and molecules appear to contribute to persistence and replication in alveolar macrophages. For example, strains of R. equi that cause disease have chromosomal virulence factors for capsular polysaccharide, cholesterol oxidase, phospholipase C, lecithinase, and cell-wall mycolic acids and plasmid virulence factors (pathogenicity island) for VAP.

            "text": "The single most important virulence factor in bovine pneumonic mannheimiosis is leukotoxin. Mannheimia leukotoxin (LKT), a member of the RTX group of toxins, is a cytotoxin that causes lysis and apoptosis of alveolar macrophages and neutrophils. RTX toxins attach to cells through passive adsorption and cell surface \u03b2 2 integrin receptors, the latter being the transmembrane receptor CD18. At high concentrations, it causes necrosis by creating pores in cell membranes, leading to cell swelling and lysis (oncotic necrosis), whereas at lower concentrations, it causes apoptosis. Additionally, at lower concentrations, it activates neutrophils and induces the production of proinflammatory cytokines. When bacteria are phagocytosed by alveolar macrophages, leukotoxin is used to kill the macrophages and release the bacteria back into vascularized ECM tissue and alveolar spaces. Iron is also required for optimal growth of the bacterium and production of leukotoxin. LPS and leukotoxin also activate the complement system and the release of proinflammatory cytokines, resulting in vascular injury and severe acute inflammation. Vascular injury leads to permeability changes with edema and the release of fibrinogen that polymerizes to fibrin in alveolar spaces, interalveolar septa, interlobular and interlobar septa, and on pulmonary serosal surfaces (fibrinonecrotic pneumonia). Vascular injury can also lead to pulmonary hemorrhage. Acute inflammation is characterized by the recruitment of large numbers of neutrophils from the circulation into affected lung tissue followed by activation of these cells via a respiratory burst and the release of degradative enzymes. The bacterium has several mechanisms (see later) to minimize the effects of neutrophils, but innocent bystander lung tissue, such as terminal bronchioles and cells that form the air-blood barrier, are severely injured by the molecules and enzymes released from activated neutrophils. Capsular polysaccharides, outer membrane proteins, and LPS of the bacterium are also important in the pathogenesis of the disease, especially as related to acute inflammation and vascular injury. Polysaccharides are virulence factors that facilitate adherence, colonization, and likely invasion of respiratory mucosae; inhibit phagocytosis by neutrophils; and disrupt complement-mediated lysis of bacteria. Outer membrane Mycoplasma mycoides var. mycoides SC, could be involved in some of these processes. Highly virulent strains of the bacterium are known to produce and release large quantities of H 2 O 2 that are cytotoxic for all cells. H 2 O 2 release appears to be correlated with adhesion of the bacterium to target cell membranes. It also appears that macrophages may spread the bacterium via leukocyte trafficking systemically to lymph nodes and synovium and joint spaces such as the carpus where inflammation characteristic of the disease also occurs. As presumed virulence factors, outer surface proteins and/or plasma membrane proteins of Mycoplasma spp. contain lipoproteins, capsular polysaccharides (e.g., galactan), and carbohydrate biofilms that likely function to protect the microbe from defense mechanisms and to cause the acute fibrinoid inflammatory response so characteristic of the disease. Unique to Mycoplasma mycoides var. mycoides SC is the apparent lack of virulence factors that can be characterized as toxins or invasins. In fact, virulence factors appear to arise from metabolic or catabolic pathways within the bacterium or from intrinsic components of the bacterial outer surface and/or cell membrane such as capsular polysaccharides.",

Gross lesions include (1) enlarged lymph nodes that contain discrete and coalescing granulomas (tubercles) formed by dry and gritty (mineralized) yellow-white to green-white caseous exudate often encapsulated by fibrous connective tissue (see Fig. 1-18) and (2) lung parenchyma that contains similar granulomas distributed at random in some or all lung lobes (see Fig. 9 -80 and E- Fig. 9-14) .",

In tonsillar mucosae, macrophages cross the mucosal barrier, migrate to the tonsil, and spread the bacterium to infect na\u00efve macrophages in tonsillar tissues.

In fact, the bacterium can survive for more than 90 minutes in a phagosome of a macrophage, during which it grows, replicates, and synthesizes and releases Apx toxins, leading to the lysis of these macrophages and release of the bacterium. Additionally, during this time, infected macrophages can move into alveolar and lobular septa, alveolar lumina, and perivascular and peribronchiolar tissues. Thus, when an infected macrophage is killed, large numbers of bacteria are released into vascularized ECM, leading to more acute inflammation, recruitment of additional neutrophils and macrophages, and exacerbation of injury to surrounding tissues.",

The capsule, cell-wall molecules, and superoxide dismutase participate in removing oxygen free radicals. The bacterium produces ammonia within phagosomes through the release of a potent urease, which inhibits phagosome-lysosome fusion and disrupts acid hydrolase activity in lysosomes. Finally, Apx toxins, pore-forming exotoxins that lyse cells, are important virulence factors in the pathogenesis of the disease. At low concentrations and probably early in the disease process, Apx toxins (ApxI to ApxIII) produced by the bacterium also impair chemotaxis and phagocytosis by macrophages and neutrophils by likely acting to disrupt actin-myosin-directed movements of the cell or its organelles. At higher concentrations, such as those that occur after the bacteria has gone through several replication and kill cycles in macrophages, ApxI and ApxIII are highly toxic and ApxII is moderately toxic for macrophages and neutrophils. Additionally, ApxI to ApxIII are highly toxic to surrounding tissues, such as blood and lymphatic vessels, and ECM tissues, resulting in loss of barrier systems, increased vascular permeability with fibrin leakage and polymerization, hemorrhage, and vasculitis. In fact, it should be remembered that all of these infected cells and innocent bystander cells and tissues are within several hundred micrometers of one another and the vascular system. In particular, vascular injury appears to result from the activation and killing of intravascular macrophages and endothelial cells by Apx toxins and LPS. Activation results in the release of oxygen free radicals (superoxide anion, hydrogen peroxide, and hydroxyl radical) as well as proteolytic enzymes and various cytokines, all of which can injure endothelial cells of capillaries and postcapillary venules. Injury leads to activation of the coagulation, fibrinolysis, and kinin systems (see Chapters 2, 3, and 5) with concurrent hemorrhage, edema, effusions, platelet activation, and the formation of thrombi, ischemia, and subsequent coagulative necrosis of lung.",

Information about the mechanisms used by B. bronchiseptica and P. multocida to cause atrophic rhinitis in pigs is limited. Thus portions of this section are conditional and based on (1) what is known mechanistically about other diseases of the respiratory system caused by Pasteurella spp. and (2) a reasonable probability that inflammation, responses to injury, and lesions that have been described in atrophic rhinitis are the result of underlying and known pathobiologic mechanisms. The mechanism of injury is (1) lysis of ciliated epithelial and stromal cells of turbinate mucosae and (2) concurrent dorsal area of the caudal lung lobes. In fact, a large area of fibrinohemorrhagic pleuropneumonia involving the caudal lobe of a pig's lung is considered almost diagnostic for this disease.",

The characteristic distribution pattern (dorsal-diaphragmatic) of gross lesions may reflect the fact that droplet size and inertial turbulence results in the initial deposit being near branch points of conductive airways. The bacterium must first colonize mucosae by adhering and binding to the membranes of epithelial cells using ligand-receptor interactions mediated through type 4 fimbriae and likely adhesins (multiple-step binding process). The bacterium also binds to mucus, but the purpose of this act is unclear. Following colonization, A. pleuropneumoniae requires iron to grow and replicate and is capable of using porcine transferrin as a source of iron. However, it also appears that iron is obtained from lysis of red blood cells caused by bacterial hemolysins and proteases. After the lysis of red blood cells, LPS and outer membrane proteins of the bacterial cell wall can bind hemoglobin and assist in the transfer of the iron molecule required for growth and replication into the bacterium. In part, this requirement may explain the severe hemorrhage that occurs in this disease.

Initial colonization by B. bronchiseptica leads to disruption of the mucus layer and the mucosal barrier system and results in mucosae that are more suitable for colonization by P. multocida in the second phase of infection. Mucosal lesions begin as focal erosions and ulcerations accompanied by acute inflammation (neutrophils), which subsequently spread into underlying lamina propria, ECM tissues, and bone of the turbinates. These lesions result in altered clearance mechanisms of ciliated epithelial cells and exposure of its lamina propria, where P. multocida can adhere to and colonize vascularized ECM tissues. Once mucosae and lamina propria are colonized, the primary virulence factor expressed by the bacterium is P. multocida toxin (PMT), a DNT. The toxin, a typical A-B toxin, causes turbinate atrophy and snout deformation through chronic inflammation leading to bone remodeling and fibrous osteodystrophy of periosteal fibroblast origin. Mechanistically, the toxin initially acts to stimulate osteoblasts, which in turn act to increase the numbers (hyperplasia) and activity of osteoclasts. As toxin concentrations increase, it acts by blocking the function of osteoblasts, and cell degeneration and lysis may ensue. Overall, PMT causes turbinate atrophy by increasing osteoclast numbers and activities through osteolysis of existing turbinate bone, as well as by inhibiting osteoblastic activities and the formation of new bone, both resulting in turbinate atrophy.",

This section covers a variety of diseases in which the key component of the underlying pathogenesis is embolization through the blood vascular system, leading to vasculitis and potentially thrombosis and ischemia. Such embolic diseases most commonly begin in the skin/subcutis or mucosae but end in a wide variety of highly vascularized organ systems. Examples of embolic diseases include white spotted kidney disease (E. coli), embolic nephritis (foal shigellosis [Actinobacillus equuli]), milk spots in the liver (E. coli), bacterial endocarditis (E. coli), and bacterial hepatitis (Fusobacterium necrophorum). Embolization also occurs in diseases caused by angioinvasive fungi, and they are covered in the section on fungal diseases. The mechanism of injury in embolic vasculopathy/vasculitis is cell lysis, probably acute coagulative (fibrinous peritonitis) (see Fig. 7-17) . Body cavities may also contain a fibrinous exudate and edema fluid. Facing serosal surfaces are often loosely attached to each other by the fibrinous exudate, making normal physiologic processes like respiration and cardiac contraction more difficult. With chronicity and healing, these opposing surfaces may adhere to each by fibrosis and consequently restrict normal \"gliding\" movements of serosal surfaces of the thoracic and pericardial cavities, thus impeding normal respiratory or cardiac function. The serosa and cavities of meninges, joints, and testis can also be affected. Information about the mechanisms used by these bacteria to cause porcine polyserositis is limited. Thus portions of this section are conditional and based on (1) what is known mechanistically about other diseases of the respiratory system caused by the Pasteurellaceae family of bacteria and (2) a reasonable probability that inflammation, responses to injury, and lesions that have been described in porcine polyserositis are the result of underlying and known pathobiologic mechanisms.",

They appear to behave as commensal microbes of respiratory mucosae existing in biofilms in the nasopharynx and tonsil of healthy pigs. Environmental stressors, such as overcrowding, poor ventilation and humidity, or abrupt changes in ambient air temperature, alter the mucus layer and the commensal relationship, allowing bacteria to replicate in sufficient numbers to begin colonization of respiratory mucosae and to spread to other animals. Preceding or concurrent viral infections (i.e., PRRSV or SIV) could also damage the mucociliary apparatus, allowing bacteria to more extensively colonize the mucus layer or mucosae. In the respiratory system the bacteria are deposited on mucosae of the conductive component by centrifugal and inertial turbulence and are trapped in the mucus layer. These bacteria are nonmotile, and it has not been clearly shown how they penetrate the mucus layer; gain access to cilia of mucosal epithelial cells; express virulence factors such as adhesins, capsular molecules, fimbriae, and outer membrane proteins required for ligand-receptor interactions; and colonize mucosae. It has been suggested that receptors necessary for colonization may be exposed by a molecule that behaves like neuraminidase. Once the mucus layer and/or mucosae are colonized, nonciliated and ciliated epithelial cells are injured by LPS and possibly by a purported neuraminidase and bacterial toxin. Acute inflammation quickly ensues and is followed to a limited extent by lysis of these cells.",

The outcome of these processes is the loss of normal mucosal barriers, which provide the bacteria with direct access to the vascularized ECM of the lamina propria. It has not been determined how the bacteria actually cross these altered mucosal barriers, reach capillary beds in ECM, encounter and penetrate the endothelium, and spread within the blood vascular system. Mechanisms, such as a cell-free bacteremia or leukocyte trafficking via alveolar or intravascular macrophages, lymphocytes, or dendritic cells, are hypothetical mechanisms of spread. A study of Haemophilus suis has shown that mucosal macrophages contain structures resembling phagolysosomes that are indicative of phagocytic activity. Lesions suggest these bacteria may have a tropism for vascular endothelial cells of serosae. It is unclear why this occurs, but it is probably linked to the expression of bacterial virulence factors and ligand-receptor interactions with host endothelial cells. Additionally, it is thought that bacterial endotoxins (LPS) may contribute to vascular injury and permeability changes leading to the leakage of fibrinogen and its polymerization to fibrin on serosal surfaces and in some cases to microthrombus intravascular coagulation affecting all organ systems and serosal surfaces (see Fig. 2-18) .",

Ingestion may also serve as a portal of entry if water contaminated with leptospira is consumed and the bacteria encounter mucosae of the intestine. During chewing and swallowing, it is likely that mucosae of the oral pharynx trap the bacteria in its mucus layer. After swallowing and through intestinal peristalsis, the bacteria are moved into contact with villi and crypts, where they are probably trapped in the mucus layer and encounter enterocytes. In the conjunctiva, it is also likely that mucosae trap the bacteria in a mucus layer. For infection to occur, it has been suggested that the skin and mucosae must have small cuts or abrasions that allow the bacteria to penetrate into the vascularized lamina propria, dermis, submucosal, or subcutaneous connective tissues and gain access to capillaries and/or postcapillary venules. However, Leptospira spp. are motile bacteria and are probably able to penetrate mucus layers and move across mucosae by going directly through mucosal epithelial cells or between the cells through intracellular junctional complexes. In all of these portals of entry, the goal is for the bacteria to reach wellvascularized ECM tissues. As a group, these spirochetes are highly motile and invasive, and using their invasive motility (virulence factor), they are able to penetrate the vascular wall and endothelial cells of capillaries and postcapillary venules to gain access to the circulatory system. Leptospira spp. may also invade lymphatic vessels and through afferent and efferent branches and the thoracic duct eventually gain access to the circulatory system. Leptospira spp. are able to grow and replicate in the circulatory system, spread systemically, and attach to endothelial cell membranes in other organ systems via adhesins before invading these cells and underlying ECM. These encounters and the penetration of blood vessels result in systemic petechial and ecchymotic hemorrhages characteristic of vascular leptospirosis.",

The first category usually results from penetration of blood or lymphatic vessels from trauma, bite wounds, or lacerations; the second category from penetrating traumatic injury leading to local inflammation and abscess formation followed by vascular entry; whereas the last category results from endocytosis or phagocytosis of microbes by leukocytes. In the direct entry mechanism, access to the vascular system, embolization, and entrapment in capillary beds are likely physical interactions based on the anatomy of vascular distribution patterns (i.e., sharp angles [90-degree] of curvature), physiology of vascular flow and pressures, and probably the distribution and number of appropriate endothelial cell surface receptor molecules at final destinations. As an example in the cerebral cortices, lesions caused by bacterial emboli tend to be observed at the interface between gray and white matter. Anatomically, at this location, capillaries penetrate through the gray matter from the overlying meninges and as they run into the white matter, they make abrupt turns (90-degree), so capillaries can run parallel to fiber tracts in the white matter. This flow change causes vascular turbulence and endothelial cell surface perturbations, and under the proper conditions, activation of Virchow's triad can result in the formation of vascular endothelial surfaces that may be sticky or have receptors or attached fibrin that can bind or entrap bacteria, respectively. Many of the bacterial virulence factors discussed throughout this chapter, as well as ligand-receptor interactions, probably are involved to some extent in the origination and entrapment and growth of bacterial emboli in the direct entry mechanism.",

It appears that the skin must be penetrated and the bacterium carried by direct extension into the dermis and subcutis for pyogranulomatous lymphangitis to develop. Thus the bacterium enters and acts locally. In the respiratory system, the potential pathway(s) of spread are more complicated. Following inhalation, the bacterium encounters mucus and mucosae of the nasal cavity and of the conductive component of the lung. The outcome of these interactions is likely controlled by virulence factors, which determine whether the nasal mucosa and lungs, lymphatic vessels of the skin, of both types of tissues are final targets for infection. In the nasal mucosa and lungs, the bacterium appears to enter and act C that the colonization process at mucosae may involve the development of a biofilm; adhesins, such as pili, have also been identified (virulence factors). An interaction of the bacterium with cell membranes is a prerequisite for infection to occur. A type IV pilin-like protein may be involved in the adherence of the bacterium to target cells. Secondly, the bacterium may have different sets of virulence factors that allow it to enter phagocytic cells (macrophages, dendritic cells) or nonphagocytic cells (mucosal and skin epithelial cells) via phagocytosis and endocytosis, respectively, and cross these barrier systems to gain access to BALT/GALT (MALT), and then spread systemically to the skin (lymphatic vessels) via leukocyte trafficking. In both macrophages and mucosal epithelial cells, type III and IV secretion systems (virulence factors) appear to be involved in cell invasion, actin-based motility, and transfer across cell membranes from cell to cell. Unique to nonphagocytic cells (mucosal and skin epithelial cells) are virulence factors that allow the bacterium to enter target cells through endocytosis, escape from locally. Whereas spread to the skin from the nasal mucosa requires a complicated series of steps, such as endocytosis, phagocytosis, and leukocyte trafficking (or cell-free bacteriemia) as examples, to cross the mucosa, spread, and reach and colonize target cells in cutaneous lymphatic vessels. Lastly, in the alimentary system, following ingestion and passage to the small intestine via swallowing and peristalsis, the potential pathway(s) of spread back to cutaneous lymphatic vessels (if they occur) are more complicated and largely unknown. Mechanisms potentially include virulence factors that facilitate crossing the mucus layer, crossing mucosal barriers at mucosal epithelial cells or M cells (endocytosis, phagocytosis, mucosa-associated macrophages), and leukocyte trafficking (or cell-free bacteriemia), as examples, to spread, reach, and colonize target cells in cutaneous lymphatic vessels.",

The uroepithelium (urothelium), a mucosa formed by transitional epithelium, is a unique barrier system between urine and its components in the urinary space and the underlying well-vascularized lamina propria. The mucosal epithelium forms a barrier to ions, solutes, and water flux, as well as microbes. Transitional epithelium is composed of three layers, umbrella, intermediate, and basal cell layers. The outermost umbrella layer is a single layer of highly differentiated and polarized cells with distinct apical and basolateral domains demarcated by tight junctions. The intermediate and basal cell layers are connected to each other and the overlying umbrella cell layer by desmosomes and, likely, by gap junctions.

The lytic actions of hemolysins also increase the availability of iron and other nutrients for bacterial growth in colonized mucosa.

Some strains of UPEC have a virulence factor for the production of urease, which hydrolyzes ammonia in urine into urea, resulting in alkaline urine that causes additional injury to mucosa. Finally, these bacteria can readily exchange genetic information with less virulent bacterial strains by transduction and conjugation using drug resistance, toxin, and other virulence plasmids. These factors are a few of the reasons why it is often surfaces of epithelial cells lining the loop of Henle. It is plausible that Leptospira spp. infect epithelial cells of the loop of Henle via their apical surfaces projecting into the urinary lumen, using mechanisms similar to those previously described.

Once bacteria replicate in sufficient numbers, they spread by ascension to encounter and colonize mucosae of the urethra and bladder and then by vesicoureteral reflux to ascend to the ureters and renal pelvis. The development of a chronic insidious urocystitis is often an intervening stage in the disease that serves to produce large numbers of bacteria. After colonization of the renal pelvis, it is not known how bacteria cross mucosae to gain access to the medullary interstitium. Degradative enzymes and inflammatory mediators combined with bacterial virulence factors, such as Renalin, which is an extracellular cytolytic protein produced by C. renale, may facilitate spread across mucosal barriers and inflammation and cell lysis within the medulla.

Bacterial virulence factors that act as chemoattractants for neutrophils and that disrupt phagocytosis and killing by neutrophils appear to explain the abundance of exudate and viable bacteria, respectively. Early in the sequence of steps when bacteria encounter mucosal and tissue macrophages in local and regional lymphoid tissues and nodes, a bacterial cell wall protein, SeeH, interacts with these cells, resulting in the release of proinflammatory cytokines, increased vascular permeability, and edema. The occurrence of acute suppurative inflammation is also facilitated by several virulence factors. When peptidoglycan of the bacterial cell wall interacts with C3 of complement in edema fluid via the alternative complement pathway, it produces complement-derived chemotactic factors that attract large numbers of neutrophils from capillary beds into local vascularized connective tissues (ECM). Furthermore, bacterial streptokinase interacts with plasminogen in edema fluid to form active plasmin, which hydrolyzes fibrin. This process appears to increase the spread and dispersion of bacteria in tissue. Normally fibrin confines bacteria by isolating them within its polymerized fibrillar meshwork so they can be phagocytosed and killed by neutrophils and macrophages, but when fibrin is hydrolyzed, large numbers of bacteria can accumulate in the exudate of an abscess and be readily available for release into the environment (see later). The outcomes of these processes also contribute to the initiation of the cellular (leukocytic) phase of acute inflammation and the accumulation of suppurative exudate characteristic clinically of strangles.",

These bacteria elicit an acute inflammatory response that is quickly replaced by a pyogranulomatous inflammation because of LPS in the bacterial cell wall. LPS is not readily degradable, and macrophages (as monocytes) are recruited from the systemic circulation to phagocytose and degrade such material and kill the bacteria. Brucella spp. are able to evade the killing mechanisms when phagocytosed by neutrophils and macrophages. Additionally, they are able to grow and replicate in macrophages and dendritic cells. Once Brucella spp. encounter cell membranes of macrophages, they use ligand-receptor interactions to attach to and enter cells; however, the details remain unclear. Outer membrane protein of the bacterial cell wall and class A scavenger receptors on target cells are likely involved but not necessarily with each other. TLRs are also likely involved in attachment and entry into macrophages. Entry occurs via endocytosis through a phagosome, but phagosome-lysosome fusion does not occur because bacteria are able to block fusion through rapid acidification of the phagosome (see . LPS (a PAMP), a type IV secretion system, and a long list of other putative virulence factors such as cyclic \u03b2-1,2-glucan and heat shock proteins may also be involved in blocking phagosome-lysosome fusion and promoting bacterial growth and replication. The virulence of Brucella spp. strains appears related to the LPS composition of its capsule, with the encapsulated smooth phenotypes generally being more virulent.

It uses macrophages to spread to and through these tissues and then systemically to infect cells and tissues in the placenta, sex organs of males and females, and fetuses. Therefore brucellosis is initially and long term characterized by a chronic active pyogranulomatous lymphadenitis with sequelae that affect the reproductive systems. A, Boar, swollen testis. The testis in enlarged due to chronic active pyogranulomatous inflammation. Brucella spp. spread in macrophages via leukocyte trafficking from lymphoid tissues systemically to the testis.

Macrophages spread the bacterium to other visceral lymph nodes, especially the mediastinal and bronchial, and to tissues in a wide variety of organ systems, especially the lung. Because the bacterium is able to replicate in large numbers in macrophages and neutrophils, the lysis of these cells attributable to mycolic acid or cell aging results in the release of bacteria into vascularized ECM tissues. This process activates integrins and adhesins in vascular endothelium and causes massive recruitment of additional neutrophils and macrophages into the tissues as part of a chronic active inflammatory response, thus repeating the inflammatory process of forming pyogranulomas (abscesses). The mechanisms used by C. pseudotuberculosis to gain access to lymph nodes via the alimentary system and ingestion (if it occurs) are unknown. Two potential pathways could be used, and both focus on macrophages and leukocyte trafficking. First, bacteria could interact with the mucus layer and mucosae of the oral pharynx, be phagocytized by mucosa-associated macrophages and carried to the tonsils, then to regional lymph nodes, and then systemically. Second, bacteria could be swallowed and via alimentary peristalsis encounter M cells of small intestinal crypts, spread via M cells to macrophages in contiguous Peyer's patches, then to regional lymph nodes, and then systemically. It is likely that the mechanisms and responses to injury described for the penetrating wounds portal of entry would also apply to these two scenarios.",

The bacterium is a common contaminate of the environment usually from animals that have the cutaneous form of caseous lymphadenitis leading to fistulous tracts from draining cutaneous lymph nodes. Penetrating wounds most commonly involve the skin and mucous membranes of the oral cavity. Management practices, such as shearing, may cause skin abrasions, whereas objects like wire, sticks, and protruding barn or fence nails may puncture the skin. Similar types of injury may occur in the oral cavity by similar objects and mechanisms. Once the bacterium reaches the submucosa or dermis, it is phagocytosed by neutrophils and macrophages and spread via leukocyte trafficking to regional lymph nodes via afferent lymphatic vessels. The bacterium replicates in lymph nodes, and the inflammatory response results in multiple pyogranulomas (abscesses) that grow in size and with time, notably enlarge, and affect the entire lymph node. Macrophages infected with bacteria leave the lymph node via leukocyte trafficking and spread via efferent lymphatic vessels and probably the thoracic duct to the systemic circulation a common mechanism of injury, the disruption of neurotransmitter vesicle exocytosis by disrupting the synaptic fusion complex. The mechanisms are demonstrated in Figures 4-28 and 4-29 for botulinum toxin and tetanus toxin, respectively. Thus diseases (clinical signs) that occur are the direct result of disruption of the function of myoneural (flaccid paralysis) and neural-neural (spastic paralysis) junctions. Botulinum and tetanus toxins have heavy and light chains and behave as typical A-B toxins composed of two units: a binding B-domain (heavy chain) that mediates transport via endocytosis and exocytosis and an enzymatically active A-domain (light chain) that serves to cleave proteins within the target cell. The heavy chain binds to the neuronal membrane of myoneural junctions (botulinum toxin) and nerve endings (tetanus toxin), and the entire toxin molecule enters the neuron via receptor-mediated endocytosis. The A-domain is cleaved from the B-domain within the target cell endocytotic vesicle and then released into the cytoplasm where it is active. The A-domain (light chain), a zinccontaining endopeptidase, leaves the endocytotic vesicle and enters the cytoplasm of the neuron and acts to cleave proteins that form the synaptic fusion complex. This complex, formed by fusion of synaptic vesicle proteins with presynaptic plasma membrane proteins, serves to bring neurotransmitter vesicles into contact with the neuronal cell membrane at the myoneural (botulinum toxin) and neural-neural (tetanus toxin) junctions and facilitates membrane fusion and release of excitatory (acetylcholine) and inhibitory neurotransmitters (glycine and \u03b3-aminobutyric acid [GABA]), respectively.",

The oral cavity is primarily innervated by the trigeminal and other cranial nerves that terminate in the brainstem. Thus L. monocytogenes ultimately localizes to the brainstem (i.e., pons, medulla oblongata, and proximal cervical spinal cord). The mechanism of entry into nerve endings is unknown; however, it has exudate (perivascular microabscesses formed by neutrophils) mixed with active hyperemia and/or hemorrhage commonly arranged in a perivascular pattern that are uniquely localized to the brainstem (see Fig. 14-88) .",

In the cytoplasm the bacterium has a doubling time of approximately 1 been shown experimentally in cell culture systems that L. monocytogenes gains entry into typically nonphagocytic cells through endocytosis and endocytic vesicles. Bacterial internalization, the entry process, is mediated by internalins (type A and B) that use target cell receptor E-cadherin, a transmembrane glycoprotein. Because L. monocytogenes resides in endosomes intracellularly within cell bodies of neurons when it arrives in the brainstem, it initially does not disrupt the blood-brain barrier and thus does not activate defense mechanisms provided by the innate (inflammation) and adaptive Cattle encounter Histophilus somni (formerly Haemophilus somnus) via inhalation of fomites or water droplets contaminated with the bacterium. It likely exists in nasal or oral biofilms as a commensal bacterium of mucosae. Environmental stressors, such as overcrowding, combined with other factors, such as poor ventilation and humidity or abrupt changes in ambient air temperature, could alter the commensal relationship, allowing the bacteria to replicate in sufficient numbers to colonize mucosae and spread the bacterium to other animals. After colonization of the respiratory mucosae, the bacterium spreads to the lung (see section on Respiratory System, Mediastinum, and Pleurae; Disorders of Ruminants [Cattle, Sheep, and Goats]; Pulmonary Histophilosis) and then gains access to the vascular system in areas of pulmonary inflammation, embolizes to the CNS (septicemia), and colonizes and infects small arterioles likely via ligand-receptor interactions. The first encounter with endothelial cells of arterioles occurs at anatomic sites in the brain in which there are abrupt changes in the laminar flow of blood resulting in turbulence, such as occurs at the interface between gray and white matter in the cerebral cortex. Turbulence appears to make the luminal surface of endothelial cell membrane more adherent to the bacterium and platelets. Experimentally, H. somni and its membrane LOS (a truncated form of LPS) have been shown to activate bovine platelets and increase the expression of adhesion molecules, such as ICAM-1 and E-selectin and tissue factor (factor III) on endothelial cells (surface is procoagulant). Tissue factor is a protein necessary for activation of blood coagulation cascades. Thus, because strains of H. somni have virulence factors that enhance the adherence of the bacterium to endothelial cells, such areas are prone to endothelial injury, exposure of collagen, platelet aggregation and activation, activation of clotting cascades, arterial thrombosis and obstruction, and infarction (the lesion of thrombotic meningoencephalitis).",

The mechanism of injury is acute coagulative necrosis of cells and tissues caused by hour. When the number of bacterium in the cytoplasm reaches a level sufficient to facilitate infection of adjacent cells, bacteria move themselves, facilitated by a virulence factor in the cytoplasm, to the inner side of the cell membrane via polymerization and depolymerization of target cell actin filaments. Once near the cell membrane, aggregates of bacteria use a bacterial surface protein called surface protein actA to propel themselves via actin polymerization (listerial actin-based motility) and a pseudopod into cell membranes of adjacent cells, forming invaginations of the membrane that ultimately result in double-membrane endocytotic phagocytic vesicles ( Fig.  4-30) . This process is random, so it does not appear to target specific cells in the nervous system, only neighboring cells. These doublemembrane endocytotic phagocytic vesicles are lysed by listeriolysin O, phospholipase C, and lecithinase, and the bacteria are released into the cytoplasm of newly infected cells. Experimentally, L. monocytogenes has been shown to infect neutrophils, macrophages, fibroblasts, endothelial cells, and various types of nerve cells, including neurons and microglial cells. It appears that infection of and injury to endothelial cells of capillaries initiates the inflammatory process. Once initiated, the blood-brain barrier is disrupted, and activation of the entire inflammatory cascade ensues. Neutrophils are the primary effector cells used by animal defense mechanisms to kill the bacterium. Experimentally, L. monocytogenes-infected endothelial cells express exuberant endothelial adhesion molecules (P-and E-selectin, intercellular adhesion molecule 1 [ICAM-1], and vascular cell-adhesion molecule 1 [VCAM-1]) resulting in activation of the neutrophil adhesion cascade and neutrophil binding, both components of the acute inflammatory response.

The mechanism of injury in the nervous system is infarction (cell lysis) secondary to occlusive ischemia caused by bacterial-induced arteritis (vasculitis) and subsequent thrombosis caused by acute inflammation and its mediators and degradative enzymes. Gross lesions are red hemorrhagic infarcts of varied sizes distributed at random throughout nervous tissue, especially in the cerebral cortices (see Fig. 14-89) .

The enterotoxemia phase is discussed in the section on Bacterial Diseases of Organ Systems; Alimentary System and the Peritoneum, Omentum, Mesentery, and Peritoneal Cavity; Disorders of Domestic Animals. This disease is caused by a specific strain of hemolytic E. coli having virulence factors for a bacterial enterotoxin called Shiga toxin 2e (also known as verotoxin 2e). It was initially called edema disease principle. It is absorbed in the alimentary system, circulates systemically in the blood vascular system, and is carried in the circulatory system to the brain. The mechanism of injury is lysis of endothelial and smooth muscle cells of arterioles (fibrinoid arteriopathy/arteriolopathy); thus the toxin biologically behaves as an angiotoxin. In the brain, vascular lesions are followed by secondary ischemia and necrosis of neural cells, particularly neurons in brainstem nuclei. Gross lesions include symmetric (bilateral) areas of yellow-gray malacia involving specific nuclei of the brainstem (see E- Fig. 10-27) . It is unclear why lesions are symmetric; however, this observation suggests that ligand-receptor interactions or other targeting mechanisms are involved in cell specificity. Speculatively, receptors for Shiga toxin 2e could be expressed on specific populations of endothelial cells located within affected nuclei. Some endothelial and smooth muscle cells of arteritis and arterioles do express receptors for this toxin. This toxin causes vascular permeability changes and edema followed by endothelial injury and lysis leading to hemorrhage, intravascular coagulation, microthrombosis, and infarction (grossly malacia).

Spores are carried by swallowing and peristalsis through the oral pharynx, esophagus, abomasum, and rumen to their final destination, the small intestine. It appears that spores can remain dormant in the small intestine or germinate into vegetative forms and become normal inhabitants of the alimentary system. How spores interact with mucosae and gain access to epithelial cells and mucosal macrophages is unknown. Other similar pathogens use M cells to enter Peyer's patches, so it is plausible that spores may gain access to M cells and use endocytosis/transcytosis to reach and infect macrophages in Peyer's patches. Although suggested but unproved, spores are likely the form of the bacterium that spread via M cells entry and then systemically by leukocyte trafficking to muscle and lie dormant in endosomes (or cytoplasm) of macrophages and dendritic cells. However, it is possible that vegetative forms of the bacterium spread to muscle as described earlier to ultimately \"go dormant\" and produce spores in macrophages and dendritic cells. If one or more of these mechanisms occurs, tropism for macrophages and dendritic cells of muscle is probably mediated by ligand-receptor interactions. Blackleg often follows some form of traumatic injury to muscle. It is thought that injury creates an anaerobic microenvironment with bacterial toxins, especially \u03b5-toxin. Because \u03b5-toxin is a permease that alters cell permeability, the vascular beds in affected intestinal tissues readily absorb toxins into the circulatory system. The mechanism of injury is cell lysis caused by bacterial toxins that act directly on endothelial cell membranes and neurons causing acute coagulative necrosis of affected cells (angiotoxin). Gross lesions include bilaterally symmetric malacia (acute coagulative necrosis of neuron cell bodies) and liquefactive necrosis of the basal ganglia, internal capsule, thalamus, and substantia nigra with edema and hemorrhage.

Because microvascular beds of the alimentary system injured by enterotoxins are more permeable, they absorb large quantities of toxins that are carried to the brain via the blood vascular system. In the CNS they act to increase the permeability of capillary beds leading to release into the neuropil of blood plasma containing toxins, resulting in severe generalized vasogenic cerebral edema. Circulating \u03b5-toxin likely accumulates preferentially in the brain via ligand-receptor interactions. Receptors expressed on different populations of endothelial cells in the body and within the brain may determine in part the specificity for certain neurons and nuclear groups within the nervous system. The cell membrane of cerebral endothelial cells is the probable site of toxin binding, and it appears that toxin-induced injury of endothelial cells leads to the expression of more receptors for circulating \u03b5-toxin. Injury to the endothelium disrupts the integrity of the blood-brain barrier, leading to increased vascular permeability, vasogenic edema, and the diffusion of toxin into the neuropil, where it encounters neuron cell bodies. Acute coagulative necrosis of neuron cell bodies has been attributed to toxin-induced microthrombosis of capillaries, resulting in neuronal ischemia, and by direct cytotoxic action on neurons and other neural cells. The selective nature of neuronal lysis caused by \u03b5-toxin may be explained by ligand-receptor interactions, selective metabolic vulnerability of specific populations of neurons, and/or the concentration of \u03b5-toxin.",

Bacteria spread in macrophages via leukocyte trafficking from regional lymph nodes to the caruncular side of placentomas when they likely leave the vascular system to migrate into and through these tissues. Although it is unclear what additional cells in the placentoma are infected during transplacental spread to the fetus, trophoblasts are infected with bacteria. Other cell types may be involved. Bacteria then could spread in fetal macrophage-like cells within the fetal circulatory system to the fetus via the umbilical cord or within the allantoic and amniotic membranes and infect the fetus via contact with fetal mucosae of the respiratory or alimentary systems, but if this occurs or what cells facilitate this spread is unclear.",

This bacterium is likely a commensal organism that resides in a biofilm of mucosae of the pharynx and tonsillar epithelia of healthy pigs. Environmental stressors, such as overcrowding combined with other factors such as poor ventilation and humidity or abrupt changes in ambient air temperature, can alter the commensal relationship, allowing the bacteria to replicate in sufficient numbers to colonize mucosae and spread the bacterium to other animals. Infected droplets are deposited on pharyngeal mucosae, where bacteria encounter the mucus layer and mucosal epithelial cells. It is unclear how this nonmotile bacterium is able to penetrate the mucus layer and gain direct access to the luminal membrane of epithelial cells. Additionally, it is unclear if and how the bacterium colonizes the mucus layer and mucosae. It appears that neuraminidase may be a virulence factor for E. rhusiopathiae potentially involved in initial interactions with and invasion of the mucus layer of pharyngeal mucosae. Neuraminidase acts to remove sialic acid from glycoproteins, glycolipids, and oligosaccharides expressed on target cells, potentially exposing new receptors for the bacterium. Also, it is probably important in the disease when the bacterium attaches to, colonizes, and invades cutaneous endothelial cells leading to vasculitis, thrombosis, infarction, and disseminated intravascular coagulation.",

However, macrophages are used by the bacterium to isolate it from host innate and adaptive immune responses.

Receptors are often expressed in unique patterns on target cells, and these patterns may determine the routes used by viruses to infect target cells. For example, parvoviruses and herpesviruses use specific receptors with specific distribution patterns to attach to and enter target cells. Parvovirus (canine parvovirus enteritis) infects intestinal crypt epithelial cells through receptors expressed on the basolateral surface of the cells, thus using a circuitous route via leukocyte trafficking to Peyer's patches and M cells to gain access to this surface. Although this route is not likely the most direct route to crypt epithelial cells, it may be advantageous for survival of the virus to avoid contact with gastric acids, bile, and other potentially toxic molecules in the intestinal lumen. Bovine herpesvirus 1 (infectious bovine rhinotracheitis [IBR]) infects epithelial cells of the respiratory system through receptors expressed on the apical and lateral surfaces of the cells.

They commonly become commensal microbes that reside in biofilms of the mucous membranes of the teat canal and mammary duct and sinuses. Trauma to mucosae in the gland induced by pressure changes acting on the duct system caused by milking likely makes mucosae more suitable for colonization and alters the commensal relationship, allowing the bacteria to replicate in sufficient numbers to spread the bacterium within the gland and to other animals mechanically during milking. Mastitis is an ascending infection, and milk in canals and sinuses is a suitable culture media for initial growth of bacteria. This environment is not suitable in the long term for survival of bacteria; thus they attempt to colonize mucosae to sustain the infection. Ligandreceptor interactions are likely involved in the adherence of these bacteria to receptors on mucosal epithelial cells; however, specific bacterial adhesins and target cell receptors have not been clearly identified. Once mucosae are colonized, bacteria employ mechanisms to sustain the infection. For example, S. aureus produces toxins, such as superantigens, leukocidins, hemolysins, coagulase, and likely \u03b1-, \u03b2-, and \u03b4-toxins (virulence factors) that result in cell membrane injury and cell lysis and the activation of mucosal macrophages and inflammation. The severity of this lesion and its progression to gangrenous mastitis in the peracute and acute forms are dependent on the type and quantity of toxins secreted by the bacterium as determined by its virulence factors. Additionally, activated mucosal macrophages secrete proinflammatory cytokines resulting in the recruitment of neutrophils from the systemic circulation, through the mucosa, and ultimately into the milk, thus increasing the somatic cell count. With the focus of inflammation on the mucosa, epithelial cells and subjacent basement membrane are injured, killed, and sloughed, providing bacteria with access to vascularized ECM tissues of the gland. Using bacterial surface proteins, they are able to adhere to and colonize ECM tissues, likely using receptors expressed on molecules such as fibronectin, vitronectin, laminin, and collagen in the matrix. This process allows bacteria to evade many of the harmful actions of the innate and adaptive immune responses. Additionally, capsular polysaccharides block phagocytosis by neutrophils and macrophages. As a result, acute inflammation progresses with time to chronic inflammation with fibrosis (see Chapter 3), which is a common manifestation of mastitis caused by S. aureus.",

In mastitis caused by Streptococcus agalactiae and Streptococcus dysgalactiae, the bacteria use most of the mechanisms employed by S. aureus with one important exception. They lack virulence factors that injure the mucosa and allow the bacterium to invade vascularized ECM tissues and colonize this area. Thus the bacterium is limited to colonizing the mucosa and causing inflammation at the mucosal barrier. The outcome of this process is loss of mucosal epithelial cells lining glands, collapse of the glands, and replacement of the glands with fibrous connective tissue. In mastitis caused by E. coli and other coliforms, the bacterium uses most of the mechanisms discussed previously. However, in the initial phases of colonizing the mucosa, endotoxins (LPS) and other toxic molecules released from Gram-negative bacteria cause tissue injury and cell lysis, affecting the mucosa, lamina propria, submucosa, and capillary beds. The concurrent acute inflammatory response with neutrophils and their degradative enzymes exacerbate the severity of the injury. This outcome leads to tissue necrosis, edema, and hemorrhage. Endotoxin is also absorbed by the capillaries and can cause During viral replication the pathogenicity of a disease and the survival of target cells are determined by (1) how the virus uses and/ or alters the functions of cell organelles and the transcriptional and translational processes and (2) how it escapes from target cells such as by lysis.

Protein molecules, derived from viral genes and expressed in the protein capsid or envelope, are called attachment proteins. Attachment proteins are viral virulence factors that provided the basis for genomic diversity among viruses and play a central role in their replication and existence. However, the \"infectious\" advantages provided by attachment proteins for the virus are counterbalanced by specific disadvantages. Viral attachment proteins in the virus and present in infected target cells are recognized as foreign by the innate and adaptive immune systems via defense mechanisms provided by TLRs, NK cells, cytotoxic T lymphocytes, and acute inflammation, as examples. Once attachment occurs, viruses can enter target cells by one of two main mechanisms: (1) receptormediated endocytosis (phagocytosis) or (2) fusion. Once inside target cells, viruses initiate a variety of virus-specified processes to complete their replication cycles, such as replication of their genome, core proteins, and capsid and envelope proteins; assembly of new viruses; and release of new viruses from the cell. When a DNA virus enters a target cell and its components are released into the cytoplasm, the DNA genome is transferred into the nucleus, where it uses target cell nuclear organelles to transcribe viral messenger RNA (mRNA) and later replicate new viral DNA (see Fig. 4-32 ). Viral mRNA leaves the nucleus and in the cytoplasm is translated into structural and nonstructural proteins of the virus by target cell organelles.

Similar to bacteria, viral genes and their proteins behave as virulence factors; however, the number of viral virulence factors is nowhere near the number, complexity, and diversity of those expressed by bacteria. In viruses the actions of virulence factors focus on (1) attachment to, replication in, and shedding from target cells and (2) the processes of modulating and/ or evading host defense mechanisms.

During transcription and translation of viral genes and proteins, new viral envelope glycoproteins are inserted into target cell membranes of the ER and Golgi apparatus as examples (i.e., cytocavitary system) and then moved to specific locations in cell membrane within the cell. These are the sites where virus buds from target cell membrane and acquires envelope glycoproteins. Most viruses that bud from the cell membrane do not cause cell lysis except for those that bud from the Golgi complex or rough endoplasmic reticulum (flavivirus, coronavirus, arterivirus, and bunyavirus) or the nuclear membrane (herpesvirus).

The purpose of these factors is to improve a virus's ability to complete its replication cycle in the target cell, thus spreading and propagating the virus to na\u00efve animals. Virulence factors control the processes involved in (1) replication, including attachment to, entering, replication in, and release of virus from target cells, and (2) evading, modulating, or suppressing the host's innate and adaptive immune responses. For example, feline immunodeficiency virus hides within the immune system and replicates and spreads within macrophages and T lymphocytes. Other viruses have evolved mechanisms to evade cytotoxic T lymphocyte and NK cell lysis of virus-infected target cells, disrupt complement activation, synthesize cytokine homologues that interfere with normal immunologic functions, and synthesize molecules that inhibit interferon responses or block the induction of apoptosis in virus-infected cells. Other viral virulence factors include viral proteins, as well as by-products of virus replication, such as caspases and caspase-like molecules, that accumulate in the cell and have toxin-like activities on target cells (Fig. 4-34 ; Box 4-4). As an example of a viral toxin, attachment or replication cycle. Antibiotics have no effect on viruses; however, fortunately, viral infections (viral antigens) usually activate host innate and adaptive defense mechanisms and cause an immune response (cell-mediated), which can completely eliminate a virus or prevent an infection by a virus (vaccination). However, these defensive responses can also injure and lyse target cells, leading to disease. The list of structural and biochemical effects that viruses have on target cells is extensive. These effects are often called cytopathic effects, and as a general rule, many viral infections result in lysis of target cells. Depending on the virus and its replication cycle, injury to and lysis of target cells can occur at any point during counterbalanced by their slower replication speed, allowing host defense mechanisms to intervene in the replication process and kill the virus and/or virus-infected cell. Genomic variation is a broad term used to categorize a group of biologic processes that allow viruses to acquire new virulence factors (genetic diversity) that favor their survival through infective and replicative mechanisms in target cells. The most common form of genomic variation is called antigenic drift (genetic drift), a natural mutation in a viral genome over time. It is caused by a spontaneous point mutation of individual nucleic acid bases in viral DNA or RNA. These point mutations are usually silent and do not change the protein encoded by the affected gene; however, some mutations can result in a new protein (e.g., capsid or envelope proteins as examples), thus providing an opportunity for the virus to improve its chances of infectivity, replication, and spread during its replication cycle. As an example, a \"new strain\" of virus arising from antigenic drift may have a \"new\" attachment protein in its capsid or envelope. Because of the length of time it takes to develop an effective immune response to the new protein, the immune system is ineffective in defending the animal against viral attachment and entry into target cells. Similarly, mutations could occur in viral genes linked to biologic processes involved in spread, replication, or shedding, which could also make the virus more pathogenic.",

An example of antigenic shift occurs with influenza A viruses (RNA viruses) that cause influenza in horses, pigs, dogs, human beings, and other domesticated and wild animal species (see section on Viral Diseases of Organ Systems; Respiratory System, Mediastinum, and Pleurae; Disorders of Horses; Equine Influenza [Orthomyxovirus, Enveloped RNA Virus]). When target cells are infected concurrently with two different influenza viruses, each viral strain has genes that give it a competitive advantage to infect target cells and complete its life cycle. However, when the genes of both of these parental viruses intermix under genomic reassortment in a target cell, the newly emerging virus could acquire the most pathogenic genes from both parental strains. Thus, when the virus is reassembled, it may be significantly more pathogenic (virulence factors) than either parental strain (Fig. 4-35 ). This increased pathogenicity may provide, as an example, the new virus with attachment proteins (envelope glycoproteins) that are immunologically unique to the farm, region, or country. As a result, animals that are na\u00efve to this new virus and whose innate and adaptive immune systems have not interacted with these proteins have no immune memory of them. Therefore defensive immune mechanisms provide a limited effective response against the pathogenicity of this new viral strain. Similarly, reassortment could also affect genes linked to processes involved in viral entry, uncoating, spread, replication, or shedding. Depending on the virulence and effect of the reassorted genes, the new virus could be significantly more pathogenic than either of the parental strains.",

Segmented genomes confer evolutionary advantages to RNA viruses. Antigenic shift also occurs from a process called recombination. Recombination occurs in DNA viruses and results in rearrangements within the viral genome and deletion or duplication of viral genes, as well as the acquisition of unrelated genetic material. Genetic recombination comes about when a strand of DNA is broken and then rejoined to rotavirus-infected enterocytes secrete a viral-directed toxin called NSP4 into the intestinal lumen. Adjacent enterocytes not infected with virus absorb this toxin, and it acts on a cytoplasmic messenger system to cause a secretory diarrhea. This diarrhea occurs before there is lysis of virus-infected enterocytes.",

This approach to replication results in alteration of cell membranes that are now recognized as foreign by lymphocytes of the immune system. Virus replication and spread are abruptly stopped when virus-infected target cells are killed by cytotoxic NK cells and cytotoxic T lymphocytes. Interferons, a group of molecules that act on virus-infected cells to inhibit virus replication, function by inducing the synthesis of target cell proteins that inhibit translational activities of the virus (Fig. 4-36) . The synthesis of interferon is induced by virus infection of target cells and by the action of proinflammatory molecules on these cells. Viral infection of target cells can also activate complement cascades independent of an antibody response. Complement components can act as opsonins (e.g., phagocytosis of viruses) and can cause lysis of viruses or virus-infected cells. Many of the viruses discussed in this chapter are able to infect cells of the lymphoid and monocytemacrophage systems and dendritic cells. Under normal conditions such cells are migratory immunosurveillance cells, behaving as sentinel cells for the adaptive immune system and monitoring for the presence of foreign antigens expressed by microbes or microbeinfected target cells throughout the body. As part of their normal immunosurveillance functions, these cells migrate via lymphatic and blood vascular systems throughout all tissues and organs of the body, including the brain. It is through these normal migratory infections have both beneficial and harmful outcomes. Beneficial outcomes include the return to normal structure and function of infected target cells and tissues and an animal that is free of and fully protected (vaccinated) against the virus. Harmful outcomes include the failure to return to normal structure and function of infected target cells because the cells and tissues, their stem cells, supporting stroma, basement membrane, and vascularized ECM tissues have been degraded by enzymes from neutrophils of acute inflammation or by macrophages of chronic inflammation and replaced by fibrous connective tissue. The innate immune system and TLRs, in response to viral antigens, induce inflammatory responses, cause secretion of cytokines and interferon, and activate the adaptive immune system. Cell-mediated immunity (cytotoxic NK cells and cytotoxic T lymphocytes) and interferons are the most important adaptive defense mechanism against viral infections. The monocytemacrophage system, through phagocytosis (endocytosis), is active in containing the spread of viruses, whereas phagocytosis by neutrophils does not play an important role. Antibody deficiencies usually do not affect the outcome of viral infections, whereas antibodies are important in preventing reinfection (autoimmunization or vaccination). Although viruses are obligate intracellular parasites, they have evolved sophisticated mechanisms to take over target cell cavity, hoof coronary bands and interdigital skin, and teats. The pathogenesis has not been determined to an extent that results in an understanding of the chronologic sequence of steps leading to disease. The virus, an arbovirus, is spread to cattle, horses, and pigs primarily by sandflies and blackflies and rarely by instruments or equipment. Animals encounter the virus through the bite wounds of these insects, where the biting process injures blood vessels and capillaries, resulting in virus being deposited directly into plasma of blood vessels and/or into interstitial fluids (plasma leaked from vasopuncture) within vascularized submucosal and subcutaneous ECM (connective) tissues. It appears that vesicular lesions occur at or near the sites of insect bites, suggesting that the virus infects target cells locally and there is no systemic spread of virus to mucosae or skin through leukocyte trafficking or viremia. Squamous epithelial cells of mucosae and skin are the primary target cells for viral infection, but Langerhans cells (dendritic cells) and cells of the monocytemacrophage system, although likely target cells for infection with virus, have not been clearly identified as target cells. In addition, it is likely but unproved that local migration of dendritic cells and cells of the monocyte-macrophage system spread virus to additional local target cells as described later. Lesions suggest that epithelial cells of the stratum basale and/or spinosum must be targets for virus infection, replication, and escape (through cell lysis). Lysis of these cells results in the formation of intercellular spaces that fill with fluid and form vesicles. Trauma likely ruptures the vesicles and leads to erosion/ulceration of the overlying mucosa or skin; however, acute inflammation may also contribute to the process. Virus appears to use envelope glycoprotein G as an attachment protein to bind with low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors on epithelial cells, enter the cells via endocytosis, replicate in the cytoplasm, and escape from the cell by cytolysis.",

The noncytopathic form of the virus can be introduced into the herd in new stock, through commingling of cattle, semen, or other management practices that allow contact with carrier animals. When na\u00efve pregnant cows (normal immune responses, unvaccinated, no prior exposure) have contact with carrier animals, they may become infected with the noncytopathic form of the virus. These cows are asymptomatic, but they functionally serve as a means for the virus to infect the fetus and establish \"persistently infected (PI)\" calves. These PI calves, present in small numbers, usually die before a year of age but serve as farm reservoirs for noncytopathic virus as they constantly shed virus in body secretions (saliva, tears) and feces into the environment. The cytopathic form of the virus commonly arises from a noncytopathic form that pathways that viruses within these infected cells are able to spread to other tissues and organs. This process is termed leukocyte trafficking or cell-associated viremia. Viruses can also spread to other cells as a cell-free viremia in the blood vascular or lymphatic systems.",

The heading for each viral disease includes information on whether the virus is enveloped or nonenveloped (type of cell injury during viral shedding) and the type of nucleic acid (virulence factors, genomic diversity) it contains. This information is useful in understanding the mechanisms of injury in specific viral diseases. Viral diseases are identified by a primary mechanism of injury in E- Fig.  4 -39). Viral capsid attachment proteins, VP4 and VP7, appear to be involved in the attachment and entry of virus into villus enterocytes through a multistage receptor-mediated process by binding to target cell membrane proteins such as sialic acids, integrins, heat shock proteins, and gangliosides located on apical surfaces. The replication of rotavirus in villus enterocytes results in the production of NSP4, an enterotoxin that (1) induces a secretory diarrhea, (2) stimulates the enteric nervous system and causes intestinal hypermotility, and (3) increases the concentration of intracellular calcium, disrupting the cytoskeletal system and tight junctions, and results in increased mucosal permeability. NSP4 also appears to cause dysfunction of cell membrane systems modulating electrolyte and water movement such as calcium ion-dependent chloride secretion, sodium-glucose transport proteins, brush-border membrane disaccharidases, and calcium ion-dependent secretion reflexes. Subsequently, rotavirus completes its replication cycle in infected enterocytes and is shed from these cells via cell lysis resulting in atrophy of intestinal villi and hyperplasia of crypt epithelial cells. Both the absorptive capacity of villi and their disaccharidase activity are impaired. Undigested and/or unabsorbed dietary disaccharides accumulate in the lumen of the intestine, thereby creating an osmotic gradient that draws fluids from the intestine into the lumen, leading to malabsorption and an osmotic diarrhea (see Chapter 7). Antigenic shift via reassortment of RNA segments of the viral genome from two or more strains of virus may be an important underlying mechanism in the emergence of new more pathogenic strains of rotavirus.",

They also do not recognize antigens from cytopathic forms of the virus as foreign, and as a result they fail to develop an effective adaptive immune response. Therefore, when exposed to cytopathic virus, mucosal disease ensues in these calves. Mechanistically, the sequence of steps that ultimately leads to mucosal disease begins when these immunotolerant calves inhale or ingest cytopathic virus and it is deposited on mucosa of the oral, nasal, and pharyngeal cavities and tonsil. The mechanism of infection and spread of the virus from the mucus layer systemically to MALT of the alimentary system, especially Peyer's patches (MALT), is similar to that described earlier for the noncytopathic virus. The cytopathic virus infects follicular dendritic cells and B lymphocytes in MALT and then spreads probably via leukocyte trafficking to infect and kill overlying stratified squamous epithelial cells and/or crypt enterocytes, resulting in mucosal erosions, ulcerations, and hemorrhage. In the small intestine, because of the lysis of crypt enterocytes, there is a failure of replacement of sloughed villus enterocytes after normal enterocyte turnover at the villus tip. This outcome may in part explain the mucosal lesions and initiate the formation of ulcers. Hemorrhage occurring with the ulcers could be the result of exposure of capillary beds to endotoxins or other toxic molecules absorbed through an open intestinal barrier system (cell junctions). Diarrhea could also occur secondary to the absorption of large quantities of endotoxins into the lamina propria and deeper supporting stroma that contains the enteric nervous system, Similar to distemper virus, the rinderpest virus has envelope and hemagglutinin/fusion surface glycoproteins for attachment and fusion, respectively, to target cell membrane glycoprotein receptor CD150 (signaling lymphocyte activation molecule [SLAM] ).

Gross lesions include (1) macules, papules, vesicles, pustules, scabs, and scars and in cases having extensive injury resulting from vesicles and pustules (2) a reparative response with proliferation of mucosal squamous epithelial cells resulting in a thickened and granulation tissue-like appearance of affected mucosa (see Figs. 7-150 and Erosive lesions in the oral-pharyngeal-lingual mucosae begin in the malpighian layer (stratum basale [germinativum], stratum spinosum, and stratum granulosum). Langerhans cells (dendritic cells) are located in the malpighian layer and are sentinel cells that migrate in and out monitoring for foreign antigens. Although unproved, Langerhans cells are likely infected with rinderpest virus via encounters with virus-infected macrophages migrating through these mucosae. Infected oral Langerhans cells also spread virus to contiguous squamous epithelial cells. Here the virus replication cycle results in lysis of infected squamous epithelial cells (oral-pharyngeal-lingual mucosal ulceration) and release of virus into the alimentary system. Erosive lesions in intestinal mucosae likely occur via a similar mechanism facilitated by the infection and migration of macrophages, monocytes, and dendritic cells systemically and into and through Peyer's patches and then to contiguous enterocytes. The entry of rinderpest virus into mucosal enterocytes has a polarized pattern restricted to their basolateral areas, the areas nearest Peyer's patches and M cells. The virus replication cycle results in lysis of infected enterocytes (small intestine mucosal ulceration) and release of virus into the alimentary system. 7-166, 7-167, and 7-168) . Piglets encounter virus in fomites contaminated with feces through direct contact with virus-infected pigs. Virus is ingested, and swallowing and peristasis carry it through the oral pharynx, esophagus, and stomach to the small intestine, where it is trapped in the mucus layer. It is unclear how the virus is able to evade the actions of digestive enzymes, bile acids, and other microbial-lytic molecules. The mucus layer has mucins and mucin-like glycoproteins that contain sialic acid. The viral envelope contains S protein, an attachment protein, which binds to sialic acid in the mucus layer. It has not been determined how the virus penetrates the mucus layer to gain access to enterocytes. When in contact with cell membrane of enterocytes, S protein binds to a glycoprotein receptor, aminopeptidase N, which is expressed on apical surfaces of enterocytes located on the tips and sides of villi. E2 protein, also present in the envelope of the virus, is thought to facilitate entry of virus into the cytoplasm of the enterocyte. These interactions enable the attachment and entry of virus into the cytoplasm of villus enterocytes where the virus replicates. Virus then lyses enterocytes on the tips and sides of villi and escapes into the lumen of the small intestine to be passed in the feces. Injured and killed villus enterocytes are sloughed, resulting in collapse (atrophy) of the villus. Basement membranes are not injured, and crypt enterocytes divide and migrate up the denuded villus to cover exposed basement membrane (see .

Parvovirus enteritis is a general name used to group two closely related strains of parvovirus that cause canine parvovirus enteritis and feline panleukopenia (feline parvovirus enteritis). The mechanism of injury is lysis of crypt epithelial cells and lymphocytes, including lymphocytes in the bone marrow. Specificity for these mitotically active cells occurs because parvoviruses require a target cell-derived duplex transcription template, which is available only when cells divide during the S phase of the cell cycle. Parvoviruses are unable Fig. 4-39, A) . Early in the reparative process, these migrating cells are flattened squamous-like cells stretched over the basement membrane. As the cells increase in density and maturity, they regain a more columnar structure. Additionally, the loss of enterocytes and exposure of basement membrane allows endotoxins and other potentially harmful molecules in digesta to cross into the lamina propria, enter capillary and lymphatic vessels, and through absorption cause systemic cardiovascular and hemodynamic effects. Finally, a malabsorption osmotic diarrhea also occurs because of the loss of enterocytes and the failure to digest carbohydrates (impaired hydrolysis) and other molecules in the digesta. The glycocalyx of the microvillus border (see Chapter 7) formed by affected enterocytes contains enzymes that are used to digest sugars. This activity is lost when enterocytes are lysed and sloughed into the intestinal lumen and leads to fermentation of substrates like glucose by resident bacterial flora (maldigestion). By-products of fermentation create on osmotic gradient that draws fluids across intestinal mucosa into the lumen to dilute the fermentation by-products. This process results in an osmotic diarrhea. as examples, at the time of this writing were undetermined but estimated to be substantial (\u2248 $900 million to $1.8 billion dollars). Virus affects \"preweaning\" piglets most severely; death losses of 75% to 100% are commonly reported in infected herds. The pathogenesis and mechanism of injury are very similar to those of transmissible gastroenteritis discussed in the previous section. Lesions in porcine epidemic diarrhea and transmissible gastroenteritis are similar (see Fig. 4-39) ; however, death losses are much more severe with porcine epidemic diarrhea infections because all animals exposed to the virus are \"na\u00efve\" and have not acquired immune defense mechanisms via colostral antibodies (passive immunity) or through immunization (adaptive immunity) following natural exposure or vaccination (currently available only in South Korea, Japan, and China) as exist for transmissible gastroenteritis.",

It appears that canine transferrin receptor may need to present on target cells in canids. Parvoviruses also appear to use coreceptors for the attachment and entry processes. Attachment receptors may assist in aggregating virus near the cell membrane, and entry receptors may assist the virus in penetrating the cell membrane. In the dog this process requires capsid proteins to bind to transferrin receptors, whereas in the cat the process requires capsid proteins to bind to neuraminic acid and transferrin receptors. These receptors appear to determine which cells and which species of animal are infected by parvovirus strains. Parvoviruses are released from infected crypt enterocytes when the cell is lysed after the replication cycle is completed. Because of this outcome, parvovirus enteritis causes an osmotic malabsorption-maldigestion diarrhea. Diarrhea occurs because of the failure of replacement of absorptive enterocytes covering villi that are lost through normal turnover (\u224848-hour life span). As a result, affected villi collapse, are atrophic, and all Using either the inhalation or ingestion route of infection and spread, virus spreads either within virus-infected macrophages or as a cell-free viremia from regional lymph nodes, systemically to infect endothelial cells and their contiguous epithelial cells in many organ systems, including liver, kidneys, spleen, and lungs. Infection of, replication in, and release of virus from endothelial and epithelial cells cause their lysis and subsequent necrosis. The attachment of virus or virus-infected macrophages to endothelial cells is likely facilitated by molecules of the leukocyte adhesion cascade (see Chapter 3). Virus infects and replicates in endothelial cells, leading to endothelial cell injury and lysis (necrosis-vasculitis). Depending on the severity of endothelial cell injury, vasculitis can be followed by hemorrhage and edema (increased vascular permeability) and disseminated intravascular coagulation. Infection of epithelial cells of the liver and kidney are likely facilitated by ligand-receptor interactions, although none have been identified.

Virus is inhaled and deposited on and/or trapped in the mucus layer of mucosae of the nasal and pharyngeal cavities and of the conductive component of the respiratory system through centrifugal and inertial turbulence. Virus must penetrate the mucus layer to gain access to ciliated epithelial cells (mucociliary apparatus); however, mucus contains glycoprotein receptor molecules that bind to virus and prevent it from attaching to these cells. This defense mechanism allows virus to be removed via the mucociliary apparatus and phagocytosis and killing by mucosal macrophages. To counteract this defense mechanism, the virus has a neuraminidase (virulence factor) that destroys receptors that mimic viral glycoprotein receptors in the mucus. However, it has not been determined how virus penetrates the mucus layer to gain access to mucosal epithelial cells. When virus encounters these cells, hemagglutinin and neuraminidase glycoproteins in its viral envelope bind to target cell membrane receptors composed of sialyloligosaccharides. This ligand-receptor binding allows virus to attach to and enter ciliated epithelial cells. The overall structure of sialyloligosaccharide receptors, in part, determines the target specificity at the cellular and the species levels. Early in the encounter before lysis affects cell function, the mucociliary apparatus spreads virus to additional target cells. This mechanism of spread becomes less effective as virus lyses ciliated and nonciliated mucosal epithelial cells and the physiologic continuity of the mucociliary apparatus is disrupted. It also appears that virus can spread in lymphatic vessels to regional lymph nodes via cell-free viremia or leukocyte trafficking and infect lymphocytes and macrophages. It is likely that lysis of lymphoid cells (immunosuppression) and ciliated epithelial cells and disruption of the mucociliary apparatus makes horses more susceptible to secondary bacterial diseases of the respiratory system. Hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) are surface glycoproteins of the RNA virus that are very important in its pathogenesis in all animal species.

Additionally, because neurons express no MHC class II molecules and low concentrations of MHC class I molecules, they are less likely, even when infected with virus, to be recognized by and acted on by cytotoxic and helper T lymphocytes, macrophages trafficking through the nervous system, and by resident microglial cells. During latency, viral genomes are present in the nucleus of infected neurons, but no viral proteins (antigens) are synthesized.

Bovine herpesvirus produces proteins that (1) disrupt the synthesis of interferon, (2) block the recognition of virus-infected cells by cytotoxic T lymphocytes, and (3) block the homing of T lymphocytes to virus-infected cells. Virus can also infect and induce high levels of apoptosis in T helper lymphocytes, thus suppressing the adaptive immune response to the virus.

When tissue macrophages die from viral infection, virus and viral proteins are released into the ECM, initiate inflammation, and recruit additional macrophages into the site to phagocytize free virus. This cyclic process creates and sustains an extensive inflammatory response in affected tissues. As na\u00efve tissue macrophages are recruited into the ECM, new monocytes infected with virus arrive from bone marrow, differentiate into tissue macrophages, replicate virus, and release virus into the ECM to infect these na\u00efve tissue macrophages, consequently sustaining the virus and the inflammatory response against it that ensues. Additionally, virus within these newly arriving monocytes may have undergone genetic variation (antigenic drift/shift [reassortment]) in the bone marrow. Because affected animals have no or limited innate or adaptive immunity to this \"new\" strain of virus, the inflammatory process begins anew. Virus-infected monocytes travel throughout all tissues and organ systems of the body; however, chronic-active inflammation occurs only in specific tissues. It appears that selectivity and specificity of lung, brain, mammary gland, and synovia occur in tissues where tissue macrophages are permissive to genome integration. Kupffer cells in the liver are not permissive and do not allow transcription of viral RNA, and the liver does not develop lesions. Based on this mechanism, involvement of the lung (maedi) and brain (visna) should occur in the same sheep at the same time; however, this macrophages and/or dendritic cells are involved. Virus infects and replicates in all epithelial cells; however, ciliated cells are the primary target cells. When virus encounters ciliated cells, it attaches and binds to membrane glycosaminoglycan receptors via heparinbinding domains on envelope glycoprotein G (attachment protein) and enters via envelope glycoprotein F (fusion protein). Fusion protein also appears to induce the formation of syncytial cells, a means by which cells infected with virus are able to interact with noninfected cells and spread the virus between cells. It has also been shown that virus can infect and replicate in lung dendritic cells and alveolar macrophages and cause the synthesis of interferons and interleukins. Infection of all target cell types appears to induce a cascade of proinflammatory chemokines and cytokines that recruit neutrophils, lymphocytes, and macrophages to the site, resulting in cell and tissue injury (inflammation). Additionally, TLR3 and TLR4 may initiate this cascade. In tissue culture experiments, virus appears to cause little or no injury to ciliated epithelial cells, suggesting that lesions may result in part from host defense mechanisms such as those modulated by the innate and adaptive immune responses. Bovine respiratory syncytial virus is part of bovine respiratory disease complex (shipping fever) (see section on Bacterial Diseases of Organ Systems; Respiratory System, Mediastinum, and Pleurae; Disorders of Ruminants (Cattle, Sheep, and Goats); Bovine Respiratory Disease Complex). This complex is characterized chronologically by (1) environmental or management stressors that suppress protective mechanisms in the respiratory system such as the production of protective mucus, (2) a primary viral infection that injures structural protective mechanisms such as the mucociliary apparatus, and (3) a secondary bacterial infection that causes severe inflammation often with fibrin exudation. The mechanism of injury in ovine progressive pneumonia is dysfunction and lysis of cells of the respiratory system from infection with virus and from chronic-active granulomatous interstitial inflammation and its mediators and degradative enzymes. Ovine lentivirus persistently infects monocyte precursor cells, systemic monocytes, alveolar and tissue macrophages, and dendritic cells. Gross lesions include dense, rubbery, and enlarged lung lobes that are uniformly affected and grayish-yellow to grayish-blue (see Figs. 9-75 and 9-92).

They then migrate to local lymphoid tissues (BALT) occur and acute inflammation (acute interstitial pneumonia and alveolitis) ensues. In this context, virus appears to be able to escape being killed in these cells. Potential mechanisms are discussed later. Concurrently, virus-infected macrophages migrate via afferent lymphatic vessels to regional lymph nodes (tracheobronchial) and infect macrophages and lymphocytes. It has also been suggested, but unproved, that dendritic cells may be infected and spread the virus. Viral infection causes (1) hypertrophy and hyperplasia of macrophages and lymphocytes leading to enlarged lymph nodes; (2) production of proinflammatory cytokines resulting in lysis of infected cells, releasing virus into surrounding ECM to maintain the infection, acute inflammation, and edema; and (3) the initiation of an adaptive immune response. Spread to other systemic organ systems (potentially the reproductive system) occurs at this stage, but it is unclear if spread is cell-free or cell-associated in macrophages (the latter being the most likely). In these organ systems, virus also infects cells of the monocyte-macrophage system.",

As an enveloped virus, PRRSV escapes from cells without causing cell lysis, but infected alveolar macrophages release proinflammatory cytokines, leading to acute inflammation and the recruitment of additional inflammatory cells, followed by cell lysis attributable to mediators and degradative enzymes of the inflammatory response. As a result, alveoli become filled with neutrophils, necrotic cell debris arising from killing of cells by the degradative activities of inflammatory cell enzymes, and edema fluid.

Thus a small number of virus-infected alveolar macrophages, responding to molecules through specific cell-membrane receptors, use a cascade of membrane, cytoplasmic, and nuclear messenger systems to control and sustain a large inflammatory response. Additionally, several studies suggest that lesions in ovine progressive pneumonia are, in part, immune mediated and that cytotoxic T lymphocytes may be important effector cells. Virus-infected macrophages present viral antigens to T lymphocytes, and activated T lymphocytes in turn release cytokines that lead to differentiation of monocytes to macrophages and recruitment of additional inflammatory cells.

The pathogenesis, mechanisms of injury, and clinical outcomes of African swine fever are very similar to those of classic swine fever discussed in the previous section. In summary, the pathogenicity (virulence factors) of lesions and disease caused by African swine fever virus are much more severe (Fig. 4-42) . Additionally, African swine fever virus can also gain access to the blood vascular system and directly infect macrophages through bites of ticks. Virus envelope glycoproteins p12, p54, and p30 appear to be involved in attaching and binding to and entering target cells via cell receptors. Target cell receptors have not been clearly identified.

This mutation, which is thought to occur within mucosal macrophages and/or blood monocytes, seems to inhibit or block function(s) of the 3c gene, allowing the mutated virus to assume greater pathogenicity by enhancing cell tropism for and internalization and replication in macrophages.

Cats encounter feline enteric coronavirus by ingestion of viruscontaminated fomites through two routes: (1) contact with viruscontaminated feces in litter boxes and (2) contact with carrier cats, usually queens. Fomites from saliva or respiratory droplets probably serve as a source of the virus to infect na\u00efve cats via ingestion; therefore grooming behavior increases the likelihood that virus will enter the oral cavity. Feline enteric coronavirus is swallowed and moved via intestinal peristalsis to the alimentary system, where it gains access to mucosae. The replication of enteric coronavirus is primarily restricted to mature intestinal epithelial cells (terminally differentiated cells with a life span of 3 to 8 days); however, the virus can enter a carrier state and persist in unidentified cells of the intestinal mucosa. These cells are likely progenitor cells (i.e., crypt stem cells) with infinite life spans, so cell lysis through normal enterocyte turnover does not affect the carrier state of the virus.

Adsorbed viral proteins act as haptens that are recognized as foreign by cells of the monocyte-macrophage system and are phagocytosed. Additionally, the hapten is processed and presented to lymphocytes, leading to a humoral immune response and the generation of plasma cells that secrete antibody against the hapten and other antigens on the red blood cell membrane (type II hypersensitivity response). If the hapten-antibody complex fixes complement, red blood cells are lysed intravascularly. If complement is not fixed, red blood cells are phagocytosed by cells of the monocytemacrophage system and lysed extravascularly. Both of these mechanisms result in severe anemia. The cause of thrombocytopenia is less clear and is thought to occur because of activation of platelets and concurrent binding of fibrinogen to the surface of platelets during acute viremic phases of the disease. It is likely that activated platelets are quickly phagocytosed by the monocyte-macrophage system, leading to thrombocytopenia. Petechial hemorrhages may be attributable to vascular injury caused by direct infection of endothelial cells by virus or more likely by secondary responses to injury induced by innate and adaptive immune defense mechanisms.",

Cats with a weak cell-mediated response have the dry (noneffusive) form; cats with no cell-mediated response have the wet form (effusive). An effective humoral response appears to increase the severity of disease. Tissue macrophages provide a source of viral antigens in and around venules, and if adequate antibody is present, antigen-antibody complexes form and a type III hypersensitivity response ensues. Where immune complexes are formed (i.e., basement membrane of endothelial cells) or whether they are free or cell associated is not clearly understood. These complexes activate complement, resulting in chemotaxis and accumulation of neutrophils via the leukocyte adhesion cascade. Additionally, they also activate tissue macrophages, leading to the secretion of a variety of proinflammatory cytokines that act on endothelial cells to increase neutrophil and mononuclear cell chemotaxis into the area and open tight junctions of endothelial cells (increased permeability), thereby allowing leakage of plasma and fibrin into body cavities. These mechanisms result in the vasocentric pyogranulomas and pyogranulomatous inflammation, fibrinous effusions, and fibrinous polyserositis (feline coronaviral polyserositis) so characteristic of feline infectious peritonitis. A type IV hypersensitivity reaction may be involved in the pathogenesis of some pyogranulomas. It appears that the commonly used categories of wet and dry forms and type III and type IV hypersensitivities are based more on clinical characteristics and immunologic tests, respectively, than on any morphologic criteria.

When the genome of bovine leukemia virus (provirus) is integrated into the genome of a B lymphocyte, the provirus asserts control over the transcriptional and translational organelles and processes of the target cell. Genes of bovine leukemia provirus express a protein called bovine leukemia virus Tax protein (p34tax) that appears to stimulate the proliferation (increased mitoses) of B lymphocytes and increases viral replication in target cells. Tax protein also interacts with target cell genes and appears to transactivate genes that express proteins modulating target cell growth, such as cell division and differentiation, and are involved in regulatory steps of cell proliferation and longevity. Experimentally, Tax protein has been shown to be able to immortalize rat embryo fibroblasts in tissue culture and to cooperate with an oncogene to transform tissue culture cells that can then be grown as tumors in live animals. Collectively these findings suggest that transformation of B lymphocytes, leading to bovine lymphoma, is linked to the likely long-term actions of p34tax on target cell regulatory genes, but the chronologic stages of transformation are uncertain. Studies suggest that transformation may also result from Tax protein forming complexes with proteins expressed by tumor-suppressor genes such as p53, whereas other studies suggest that point mutations in the p53 gene may be one of the critical steps leading to lymphoma. The proteins translated from tumor-suppressor genes have an inhibitory effect on the regulation of the cell cycle and function to inhibit cell division, inhibit division of cells with damaged DNA, initiate apoptosis of cells with damaged DNA, and amplify cell adhesion (metastasis suppressors). When the activities of the p53 gene and its protein gene products are perturbed or inhibited, transformation of affected cells could occur.",

It also appears that expression of a specific target cell receptor, the total number of receptors expressed on the cell, and the use of soluble cofactors play roles in determining which target cells are infected by FeLVs. Additionally, persistent infection of bone marrow cells by FeLV-A provides many opportunities for mutations in the envelope gene that result in the expression of new viral subgroups through mutations in viral envelope glycoproteins that recognize new target cell membrane receptors. It is likely that the clinical syndromes and lesions caused by these virus subgroups are related to genomic variation through the expression of envelope surface glycoproteins that determine and restrict attachment, entry, infection, and replication in target cells.",

            "text": "Immunosuppression and lymphopenia coincide with systemic involvement of lymphoid tissues, specifically T lymphocytes. Cats persistently infected with FeLV-A commonly die of secondary bacterial and viral opportunistic infections. Immunosuppression, targeted primarily to the cell-mediated immune system, appears to result from (1) a reduction in the number of lymphocytes, especially cytotoxic and helper cell T lymphocytes, through virus-induced cell lysis; (2) suppression of lymphokines (interferon-\u03b4 and interleukin) secreted by activated T lymphocytes that could eliminate virus and virusinfected cells; (3) production of FeLV protein p15, which suppresses lymphocyte function (controversial); (4) dysfunction of lymphokineinduced activation of macrophages; and (5) dysfunction of neutrophil phagocytosis. Estimates suggest that approximately 50% of cats with certain bacterial infections and hemobartonellosis (Mycoplasma haemofelis) and 75% of cats with toxoplasmosis (Toxoplasma gondii) are infected with and have their immune systems suppressed cell-adhesion molecule receptors, neurotrophin receptors, or other types of gangliosides in cell membranes of unmyelinated axon terminals (nerve endings) of lower motor neurons of peripheral nerves. Similar processes are also used to spread and replicate virus in cranial nerves after bite wounds to the face. Once bound, virus enters the cytoplasm of nerve endings through pinocytosis via clathrin-coated pits and the formation of vesicles. Virus in vesicles spreads centripetally from myoneural junctions to the cell body of the nerve via retrograde fast axonal transport, likely using the dynein light chain microtubule-based transport system (see Chapter 14; see E- Fig.  14-3) . Virus replicates in the cell body of neurons and travels to dendrites via axonal transport where it buds from cell membrane of dendritic processes into synaptic clefts of neural-neural junctions. It randomly encounters receptors on motor nerve endings within the gray matter of the brain and ventral gray horns of the spinal cord. Mechanistically, viral replication and spread in motor neurons within the spinal cord and brain are identical to that in peripheral spinal nerves. The exact mechanism that facilitates transsynaptic spread of rabies virus is unknown. It may be linked in part to viral assembly where M protein encapsulates the virus and assists in moving the virus to cell membranes such as those in synapses that contain glycoproteins essential for formation of the viral envelope and viral budding. Envelope G protein is also required for attachment to cell membrane and transsynaptic spread of the virus to the next neuron in the neural pathway.",

In fact, the \"furious\" and \"dumb\" forms of rabies in domestic animals (see Chapter 14) are likely attributable to infection of specific neuronal populations and pathways such as those in the hippocampal formation or cerebellum, respectively. Virus spreads to salivary glands through axonal transport using parasympathetic nerves present in the facial (VII) and glossopharyngeal (IX) cranial nerves and sympathetic nerves in the thoracic segments of T1 to T3 spinal cord segments. In addition to spreading virus to the salivary glands, viral infection of parasympathetic and sympathetic nerves also results in increased salivary gland secretions: (1) directly through stimulating \u03b2-adrenergic receptors on the salivary acinar and ductal cells, leading to an increase in cAMP concentrations and the corresponding increase of saliva secretion, and (2) indirectly through stimulating nerves innervating blood vessels that supply the salivary glands. Virus buds from the cell membrane of these nerve terminals, infects salivary acinar epithelial cells through the envelope G protein-specific cell surface receptor mechanism, and replicates in and is amplified to large quantities in these cells. Virus then buds from apical (luminal) surfaces of salivary cell membranes, mixes with saliva, and can be transmitted in a bite wound. The apical specificity of viral budding is established during the assembly stage of viral replication. Viral genome and proteins form \"envelope\" complexes in the salivary epithelial cell cytoplasm that congregate at areas of the cell membrane that contain matching glycoprotein receptors and then bud from this membrane into the salivary gland lumen to eventually enter the duct system and saliva.",

Gross lesions include active hyperemia, vasculitis, hemorrhage, and yellow-white-gray areas of necrosis in gray matter of the nervous system, especially the spinal cord (see Fig. 14-79). Because neurons are the primary target cell, lesions are most commonly observed in gray matter (i.e., polio-), areas in which neuron cell bodies are located, and thus these diseases are classified as polioencephalitides or polioencephalomyelitides. Equine polioencephalitis-polioencephalomyelitis is used herein to group three closely related strains of alphaviruses that cause eastern equine encephalomyelitis, western equine encephalomyelitis, and Venezuelan equine encephalomyelitis. St. Louis encephalomyelitis is the human counterpart of these diseases in horses. Such diseases have also been called arbovirus polioencephalitis-polioencephalomyelitis. The term arbovirus is derived from the fact that these viruses are arthropod-borne; this term was shortened to arbo and is used as a disease acronym. Horses encounter viruses through skin-penetrating bite wounds from virus-infected mosquitoes. Mosquitoes are infected when they bite and consume infected blood from birds, the reservoir for the virus. Seasonal variations in temperature and precipitation greatly influence the population density of mosquitoes and thus the occurrence of disease. Following penetration of horse skin with their proboscis, virus-infected mosquitoes deposit virus directly into the circulatory system, where it infects blood monocytes, or into vascularized ECM (connective) tissue, where it infects dendritic cells (Langerhans cells) and tissue macrophages. In these cells, virus is spread via leukocyte trafficking to regional lymph nodes either by the circulatory system or afferent lymphatic vessels where it infects additional lymphocytes.

Receptors for E1 and E2 proteins occur on a variety of cell types and probably determine which cells, such as lymphocytes, are used for leukocyte trafficking and ultimately which organ systems, such as the nervous system, are targeted for infection by virus. Virus then spreads systemically via leukocyte trafficking in lymphocytes and macrophages through postcapillary venules or lymphatic vessels and the thoracic duct to the circulatory system to systemic lymph nodes, spleen, thymus, bone marrow, Peyer's patches, pancreas, and skeletal muscle. Infection results in necrosis of myeloid cells in bone marrow and lymphocytes in lymph nodes and spleen. Proinflammatory cytokines, such as IFN-\u03b3, and antiinflammatory cytokines, such IL-10 produced by infected lymphocytes, may cause cell lysis. Cytokines released into the blood vascular system may also act on the blood-brain barrier, making it more susceptible to viral infection via changes in its barrier functions and permeability. In eastern equine encephalomyelitis, osteoblasts appear to be the target cell used to amplify virus so it can spread to the nervous system. In this specific disease, dendritic cells, lymphoid cells, and cells of the monocyte-macrophage system are not as susceptible to infection, and thus systemic lymph nodes and spleen are infected to a limited degree with minimal injury and lysis.

Thus the likelihood of papillomavirus (1) activating growth-promoting genes (oncogenes) in target cell DNA, (2) inactivating suppressor genes that would inhibit cell proliferation, and (3) altering the functional expression of genes that regulate apoptosis is very low. Malignant transformation is most likely to occur in suprabasilar cells where virus integrates into target cell genes and viral genes and gene products, such as oncoproteins, are expressed in high numbers. Thus the likelihood of virus (1) activating growth-promoting genes (oncogenes) in target cell DNA, (2) inactivating suppressor genes that would inhibit cell proliferation, and (3) altering the functional expression of genes that regulate apoptosis is very high. A similar process probably occurs in infected mucosae of the alimentary system. The term pox is used herein to group diseases, such as bovine cowpox, sheeppox, goatpox, swinepox, and lumpy skin disease, that are caused by closely related strains of poxviruses. The mechanism of injury is dysfunction and lysis of dendritic and epithelial cells of the skin. Gross lesions include macules, papules, vesicles, pustules, scabs, and scars (see . Lesions are most easily observed on wool-free or hair-free areas (Fig. 4-43) . In general, sheeppox and goatpox are more virulent and cause systemic disease, whereas bovine cowpox and swinepox usually do not cause systemic disease. In these latter species, spread of virus is the result of animalto-animal contact or contact with clothing or tools/instruments A B C mechanism when hunting virus-infected rodents; however, infection, as previously described, via a direct mechanism (inhalation) and systemic spread in monocytes and macrophages has been reported.",

It is not clear how virus spreads from the uterus, to the placenta, and then to the fetus, but some form of a fetal macrophage-like cell probably intervenes in the placentome.

Macrophages of the lamina propria and submucosa are infected, and virus spreads in them via leukocyte trafficking and afferent lymphatic vessels to regional lymph nodes, such as the submandibular and pharyngeal. Here proinflammatory chemokines and cytokines are released from virus-infected macrophages, and they act to recruit na\u00efve lymphocytes and macrophages, which are infected with virus.

Langerhans cells (dendritic cells) are in close contact with endothelial cells in the malpighian layer of the skin. It appears that virus from capillary endothelial cells and trafficking leukocytes is able to infect Langerhans cells and then spread virus to contiguous skin epithelial cells of the stratum basale and spinosum. All of these cells allow virus to replicate; thus when epithelial cells of the stratum basale and spinosum are killed, the space formerly occupied by these cells coalesces and is filled with cell debris and intercellular edema, forming vesicles.

From the circulatory system, it is unclear how virus interacts with and spreads from the uterus, to the placenta, and then to the fetus; however, studies suggest the spread of virus to the fetus occurs via leukocyte trafficking by fetal macrophage-like cells. Although unidentified, porcine parvovirus probably has capsid attachment proteins that bind to glycosylated cell membrane receptors (likely sialic acid-bearing cell surface receptors) of target cells in the uterus, placenta, and fetus. Virus has been identified in placental and fetal endothelial cells and in most tissues of virus-infected fetuses. Parvoviruses only infect and replicate in dividing cells because they require a target cell-derived duplex transcription template, which is available when cells divide during S phase of the cell cycle (see E- Fig. 1-18 ). Parvoviruses are unable to turn on DNA synthesis in target cells, so they must wait for target cells to enter the S phase of the cell cycle before they can infect cells. It is likely that the high mitotic rate of developing and growing fetal tissues is conducive to infection by virus.

Switching appears to occur through inducible chromosomal rearrangements in the genome of the yeast in response to changes in the mucosal environment. Switching appears to be reversible. Under normal conditions the temperature of mucosa in the oral cavity is near room temperature (25\u00b0 C). This temperature favors the growth of yeast, whereas pseudohyphae and/or hyphae prefer to grow at 37\u00b0 C. The yeast form is able to switch this temperature dependence for growth via chromosomal rearrangements, so that its pseudohyphae and/or hyphae forms can grow at 25\u00b0 C. Switching is attributable to virulence factors selectively expressed under suitable predisposing conditions in the yeast (antigenic drift/shift) combined with the breakdown of mucosa, excessive use of broad-spectrum antibiotics and corticosteroids, hyperglycemia, tissue damage secondary to chemotherapy or radiation, or immunosuppression. Additionally, if innate (phagocytosis by neutrophils and macrophages) and adaptive (cell-mediated) immunity, important defense mechanisms in controlling candidiasis, are disrupted, switching is also favored. A large group of virulence factors are involved in the processes of switching and infection and invasion, but no single factor accounts for virulence, and not all expressed virulence factors may be necessary for a particular stage of infection. The yeast form appears to have its own group of virulence factors; as does the pseudohyphal and hyphal form. Yeast persists in the oropharyngeal cavity by adhering to and colonizing mucosa via ligand-receptor and/or hydrophobic interactions. Yeast and pseudohyphal and hyphal forms have ligands in their cell walls such as those in the agglutinin-like (AL) family and hyphal wall protein (Hwp) family that allow these forms to adhere to epithelial cells and invade mucosa. Mannose and mannoproteins may also act as adhesins. Receptors expressed on mucosal epithelial cells can include E-cadherin, fibrinogen, fibronectin, thrombin, collagen, laminin, vascular system into the site of inflammation. Because this process is repetitive with recurring cycles of replication in macrophages, death of macrophages and release of fungi and fungal debris and antigens, and phagocytosis of these materials by newly recruited and na\u00efve macrophages, a granulomatous inflammatory response characteristic of fungal diseases occurs in affected tissues.",

Animals encounter yeast through ingestion (and likely inhalation) where it persists as a commensal microbe that colonizes mucosa without causing injury or disease and becomes part of the normal microbial flora associated with mucosal surfaces (i.e., biofilm). The balance between commensalism and disease is tenuous, and perturbations of mucosae and/or changes in the physiologic status of the animal may shift this balance in favor of disease (i.e., the filamentous pseudohyphal and/or hyphal forms). Through a process called morphologic or phenotypic switching, the yeast form switches to the invasive and pathogenic filamentous The ligand-receptor interactions that determine location specificity have not been identified. The innate immune system identifies fungi, in part, by recognition of PAMPs (see Chapters 3 and 5) formed by \u03b1-and \u03b2-glucan surface polysaccharides in yeast cell walls. Macrophages recognize these patterns through TLRs and other PRRs expressed on macrophages and use the information to develop an appropriate immune response. Fungi have developed mechanisms to evade and/or neutralize detection by PRRs on macrophages, neutrophils, and dendritic cells such as those leading to modifications in surface polysaccharides through genomic variation. Additionally, an array of suspected virulence factors have been identified, and they include adhesins and invasins, molecules involved in iron homeostasis, and molecules that may disrupt phagosomelysosome fusion.",

Phagosomes attempt to kill the yeast by fusing with cellular lysosomes to form phagolysosomes. Lysosomes have an acidic pH and acid hydrolases that kill or restrict the growth of yeast. The yeast is able to prevent its lysis by synthesizing proteins that inhibit acidification of the phagolysosome and the activities of lysosomal proteases.

Furthermore, transformation into spherules leads to the expression of additional virulence factors that cause acute inflammation resulting in mucosal injury and colonization. Spherules, trapped in the mucus layer, grow to approximately 20 to 60 \u00b5m in diameter (occasionally up to 100 \u00b5m) and form a small number of intraspherular endospores (\u22481 to 5 \u00b5m in diameter) through a process called endosporulation. Spherules appear to escape phagocytosis because they are too large to be phagocytized by neutrophils, macrophages, and dendritic cells. When spherules are mature or are damaged by inflammatory cells, chemical mediators, and/or degradative enzymes, they release new endospores onto intact mucosa or into injured and denuded mucosa and its ECM. Endospores are approximately 1 to 5 \u00b5m in diameter and are capable of being phagocytosed by alveolar macrophages, mucosal macrophages, and dendritic cells. These endospores then grow into second-generation spherules protected within the cytoplasm of these cells. These spherules are now capable of producing an average of 200 to 300 endospores that are released onto and into mucosa when infected cells are lysed.

In healthy animals this process results in the release of proinflammatory cytokines, which, in part, recruit additional neutrophils that phagocytize and kill conidia and hyphae that are trapped in the mucus. If an animal's phagocytes are unable to phagocytize and kill conidia (i.e., defective neutrophil functions), conidia germinate in the mucus layer and mucosae and begin the processes of colonizing mucosae of the nasal cavities and sinuses. Conidia and hyphae secrete proteases, gliotoxin, fumagillin, verruculogen, and helvolic acid that slow the beat of cilia in the mucociliary apparatus and injure ciliated mucosal epithelial cells. These outcomes lead to detachment and loss of ciliated epithelial cells and exposure and damage of underlying basement membrane (laminin). Thus when conidia germinate into hyphae, a denuded and disrupted mucosa and basement membrane provide a favorable environment for hyphae to invade mucosae. Fibrinogen, fibronectin, and complement C3 fragments from inflammation that cover exposed basement membrane as a reparative response, as well as exposed laminin and collagen, can serve as receptors for sialic acid and other conidial and hyphal glycoproteins, thus contributing to fungal pathogenicity by enhancing adhesion to and colonization and invasion of injured mucosae and basement membrane. Through these mechanisms, fungus is able to invade and spread in affected tissue and extensively damage normal tissues. Dendritic cells are also able to phagocytize conidia and hyphae and process antigens for effective innate and adaptive immune responses via proinflammatory cytokines.

Capsule dilutes lysosomal hydrolases and other toxic contents and provides a physical separation between the yeast and the membrane of the phagosome in which microbicidal compounds are located. This process continues until macrophages are grossly distended with capsule (>30 \u00b5m in diameter) and is the underlying mechanism of the formation of expansile cysts filled with a gelatinous matrix observed grossly in the brain. The capsule is composed primarily of two polysaccharides, glucuronoxylomannan and galactoxylomannan, and a smaller quantity of mannoprotein. These molecules also suppress the immune response.",

Trophozoites move via flagella but do not invade epithelial cells. The anatomic segment of intestine (duodenum, jejunum, or ileum) used for attachment is species specific, suggesting that colonization is facilitated by unique ligand-receptor interactions, especially by ligands in the outer membrane of the parasite.

Additionally, trophozoites appear to be able to cause apoptosis of colonized epithelial cells covering tips and sides of small intestinal villi through membranes of microvilli to form parasitophorous vacuoles. Such vacuoles are retained in the microvillus layer and do not enter, but directly communicate with, the cytoplasm of the villus enterocyte through a feeding organelle. Once in parasitophorous vacuoles, sporozoites differentiate into trophozoites and then undergo asexual multiplication to form schizonts that contain six to eight merozoites. Schizonts rupture their vacuoles to release merozoites, and thus infected villus enterocytes are lysed, resulting in cell death, disruption of cell junctions, and loss of barrier functions. Merozoites spread distally via alimentary peristalsis in the small intestine to infect additional villus enterocytes through ligand-receptor interactions. It is likely that such ligand-receptor interactions determine which \"new\" populations of epithelial cells and what segment of the small intestine are infected. Once infected, new schizonts are formed in villus enterocytes through (1) asexual multiplication to form schizonts and (2) sexual reproduction (gametogony) by differentiating into male microgamonts or female macrogamonts. Microgamonts release microgametes that fertilize macrogametes inside macrogamonts, resulting in the formation of oocysts with sporozoites that can reinfect additional \"new\" villus enterocytes or are passed in the feces to spread the infection to other animals. These multiplicative and reproductive processes cause additional cell lysis and villus atrophy and consequently amplify the severity of mucosal injury. It has also been suggested that lysis of cells and villus atrophy may be caused by cell dysfunction and damage induced by cytokines and inflammatory molecules released from T lymphocytes and macrophages in inflammation. This latter mechanism causes increased intercellular permeability and may alter secretory functions and impair absorption of villus enterocytes. Infection, injury, and loss of villus enterocytes result in diarrhea likely caused by a combination of mechanisms, including osmotic diarrhea (malabsorption), secretory diarrhea, and increased intercellular permeability from inflammation. Enterotoxins may be involved in the secretory diarrhea, but none have been identified.",

Sporozoite-injured villus enterocytes are sloughed from the villi, resulting in collapse (atrophy) of the structure of the villus, whereas the basement membrane from under the sloughed villus enterocytes is usually unaffected and functionally normal. Because the basement membrane is not injured and remains structurally intact, villus enterocytes derived from regenerative crypt enterocytes can divide and replace sloughed cells. These regenerative cells migrate up the villus from the crypts to initially cover exposed basement membranes; thus they are recognized early in the reparative process as flattened squamous-like cells stretched over the basement membrane. As the cells increase in density and maturity, they regain a more normal columnar structure.

Cats are the definitive host; thus cat feces are the source of oocysts. Oocysts are resistant to degradation and may survive in the environment for years. Under the proper conditions (oxygen concentrations, humidity, and temperature), oocysts sporulate and become infective. Sporulated oocysts are ingested and carried by normal peristaltic activities through the oral pharynx, esophagus, and stomach to the small intestine, where they excyst and release sporozoites into the intestinal lumen in close proximity to intestinal mucosal villus enterocytes. Infections are characterized by the ability of the organism to cross barrier systems such as intestinal mucosae and the blood-brain barrier, blood-retina barrier, and placenta. This process appears to involve parasite motility (linear myosin, F-actin filaments, and gliding-associated proteins) and interactions between parasite adhesins and target cell receptors that facilitate transfer of the organism through mucosae. Mounting evidence also suggests that T. gondii uses migrating leukocytes to disseminate (leukocyte trafficking) throughout the animal while avoiding adaptive immune responses. Sporozoites infect villus enterocytes and complete an asexual replication in parasitophorous vacuoles forming tachyzoites. In parasitophorous vacuoles the protozoan initiates the production of the antiinflammatory cytokines IL-10 and transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2), which inhibit the production of proinflammatory cytokines IL-12 and TNF-\u03b1. Tachyzoites are released via cell lysis and infect and replicate in additional enterocytes and then invade subjacent lamina propria, infect cells of the monocyte-macrophage system, and enter lymphatic vessels. They spread locally to lymphoid tissues (likely Peyer's patches) and regionally to mesenteric lymph both the intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic pathways and thus contribute to the outcomes discussed in the initial paragraph.

Horses and other animals encounter sporocysts in feed, water, grass, or soil, and/or on floors or surfaces contaminated with feces from infected opossums. They are ingested and swallowed and through peristalsis gain access to mucosae of the intestines. Here sporozoites are released from sporocysts, which then must gain access to endothelial cells to mature to merozoites, the form that spreads to the CNS. Infection and involvement of endothelial cells appears to be a step central to the pathogenesis of the disease. However, little is known about the mechanism of interaction with mucosa or spread to the brain and spinal cord. Sporozoites could (1) be phagocytized by mucosa-associated macrophages (leukocyte trafficking) and subsequently spread locally to encounter endothelial cells within capillaries of the lamina propria supporting enterocytes or (2) interact with and penetrate the mucosa to gain direct access to endothelial cells in the lamina propria. It appears, but is unproven, that leukocyte trafficking via mucosa-associated macrophages is the mechanism most likely involved in spread to endothelial cells. Once in contact with endothelial cells, sporozoites enter them and mature to form schizonts containing merozoites, which eventually rupture and release merozoites into the blood and adjacent vascular ECM. They then infect adjacent endothelial cells and repeat the replicative process. Injury to endothelial cells likely causes focal vascular inflammation that recruits macrophages into the site of injury, where they may phagocytize merozoites.",

Because neurons have large concentrations of PrP C located in their cell membranes when compared to other cells of the body, PrP Sc aggregation and accumulation affects the nervous system to a much greater extent. This outcome results in degeneration of neurons and the neuropil. Translation follows a stepwise process of initiation, propagation, conversion, and aggregation to end with the accumulation of large quantities of insoluble amyloid and fibrous plaques in neurons and the neuropil. Additionally, PrP Sc that is not aggregated into the \u03b2-sheet-rich isoform is \"recycled\" to interact with PrP C in a self-amplifying process resulting in the accumulation of high concentrations of PrP Sc . The shapes of the prion proteins are used for illustrative purposes only and do not represent their molecular structure. ANS, prions. It is unclear if and how prions are trapped in the mucus layer and, if so, how they gain access to mucosal epithelial cells, macrophages, and/or dendritic cells in the mucus layer. It appears that prions are able to attach to apical surfaces of mucosal epithelial cells, M cells, and possibly dendritic cells in tonsillar, alimentary, and respiratory mucosae, respectively. Transcytosis or dendritic cell migration (also potentially via macrophage migration) is probably used by prions to pass through mucosal epithelial cells and M cells to their basolateral surfaces and to gain access to and infect B and T lymphocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells in Peyer's patches (GALT) or lymphoid nodules and aggregates like BALT. Prions are then probably spread systemically via leukocyte trafficking in lymphocytes, monocytes, and dendritic cells to other lymphoid organs such as the spleen and systemic lymph nodes. In lymphoid tissue, follicular dendritic cells and B lymphocytes are essential for prion replication, amplification, and accumulation in large numbers before spread to the nervous system. Although in TSEs the final targets are neurons and the neuropil, the mechanisms used by specific TSEs to colonize and spread prions to reach these targets may vary based on animal species. In cattle, BSE prions encounter and colonize cells of MALT in the palatine tonsils and Peyer's patches of the distal ileum. They replicate in numbers sufficient to enter nerve endings in MALT. They then spread via retrograde axonal transport to the CNS and brain mainly following the parasympathetic and sympathetic nerve fibers of the autonomic nervous system. BSE prions amplify in large numbers almost exclusively in the CNS and PNS. In contrast in sheep, scrapie prions appear to amplify in large numbers in cells of the lymphoid and monocyte-macrophage systems before entering nerve instead of prions in the pathogenesis of TSEs. These data are in dispute and will be sorted out over the next decade. Gross lesions are not observed except in chronic cases, in which atrophy of the brain may occur. Microscopic lesions characteristic of injury include intracytoplasmic vacuoles in neurons and neuropil (spongiform change), neuronal loss, gliosis, and an absence of leukocytic inflammation. These diseases in animals include scrapie (sheep and goats), bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), chronic wasting disease (CWD) in deer and elk, transmissible mink encephalopathy, feline spongiform encephalopathy, and ungulate spongiform encephalopathy.

Mucosae of the oral pharynx, especially the tonsil, small intestine, nasal pharynx, and conjunctiva, are thought to be the probable locations of initial encounters with Prions appear to use microfold cell (M cells) (also macrophages) to enter Peyer's patches and infect dendritic cells as well as macrophages and lymphocytes. Dendritic cells (and likely macrophages) then spread prions through leukocyte trafficking in lymphatic vessels to local, regional, and systemic lymphoid nodules, lymph nodes, and/or spleen where infection is sustained and amplified, especially in follicular dendritic cells (FDCs) of the spleen and B lymphocytes. Prions released from dendritic cells are able to enter nerve endings in lymphoid tissues, and by retrograde and anterograde nerve transport they spread throughout the central nervous system (CNS). It has been hypothesized that prions may also spread to the CNS hematogenously, but the existence of this route is uncertain.",

The function of PrP C is unknown, but its physiologic function may include immunoregulation, signal transduction, copper binding, synaptic transmission, induction of apoptosis, or protection against apoptotic stimuli. In neurons, PrP Sc serves as a translation template that converts (conformational change) normal PrP C to PrP Sc , a misfolded and aggregated \u03b2-sheet-rich isoform of PrP C . This folding pattern makes PrP Sc resistant to the action of proteases and causes it to aggregate and accumulate as an insoluble amyloid in neurons and neuropil in the form of large amyloid and fibrous plaques. It is not known how PrP Sc causes neuronal degeneration; however, reduced antioxidant protection, increased oxidative stress, loss of function of normal PrP C , or toxicity caused by PrP Sc , all related to the accumulation of amyloid plaque, have been proposed. The activation (hypertrophy and hyperplasia) of microglial cells may also suggest that their biologic activities and effector molecules are involved in neuronal degeneration. There are no specific virulence factors for prions.",

It is thought that prion-infected macrophages and dendritic cells deliver prions to these nerve endings; however, it is not known if endocytosis is involved in the entry of prions into nerve endings or in their spread between cell membranes in synapses. In macrophages and dendritic cells, prions are located in multivesicular endosomes (i.e., membrane-bound vesicles inside cells) and may be transferred between cells in exosomes (i.e., cellderived extracellular vesicles). Such a mechanism may be involved in interneuronal spread within the nervous system. Attachment proteins of prions or membrane receptors on target cells have not been identified. However, Toll-like PRRs may serve as receptors for prion entry into cells. Prions have tropisms for different animal species that are likely determined by the tertiary and quaternary structure of prions, resulting in their binding to or interaction with different molecules (receptors) and thus different target cells. Cellular tropism may also be restricted to those cells that express a cofactor compatible with the respective prion strain.",

They act as virulence factors (see Fig. 4-17) that damage target cells and their extracellular matrices such as collagen and thus are important in the pathogeneses of a wide variety of diseases. Gram-positive bacteria have a thick meshlike outer layer of peptidoglycan (also known as murein) that consists of sugars and amino acids. It provides structural strength in the formation of the cell wall. Gram-negative bacteria have a thin peptidoglycan layer and an outer membrane of LPS.

            "text": "cause disease. Fungi in this group include Aspergillus spp., Candida spp., Fusarium spp., Absidia spp., Rhizopus spp., and Mucor spp. The spores or conidia of these fungi are common microflora of the skin, body fluids, mucosal surfaces, and intestinal content. To gain access to the vascular system, the barrier provided by skin or mucosa must be injured. Processes that result in abrasions, penetrating wounds, and cell lysis are commonly involved. Injury results in the loss of epithelial cells and the exposure of basement membrane and subjacent vascularized ECM connective tissue. Similar to what occurs with Aspergillus fumigatus (see Fungal Diseases of Organ Systems; Respiratory System, Mediastinum, and Pleurae; Disorders of Domestic Animals; Aspergillosis [Aspergillus fumigatus]), hyphae invade vascularized tissues and gain access to the circulatory system by growing in and invading through vessel walls and endothelial cells, gain access to the circulatory system, break off into the bloodstream, circulate, and attach to and invade endothelium and ECM of other organ systems. Leukocyte trafficking may also be used to spread the fungus systemically. Ligand-receptor interactions are likely involved in this process, and these interactions probably determine in certain diseases which organ systems and tissue types are targeted by fungi. In affected organ systems, the mechanism of injury is cell lysis via chronic granulomatous to pyogranulomatous inflammation and its effector molecules and degradative enzymes.As an example, mycotic rumenitis (followed by mycotic hepatitis) of cattle is caused by several of the fungal species listed earlier. The disease is often initiated by farm management practices such as (1) diets high in grains such as corn or (2) the long-term use of antibiotics in feeds. In the first case, feedlot cattle are fed increasing quantities of corn that serve as a carbohydrate source for ruminal microflora, which convert it, in part, to lactic acid. Excessive grain in the diet (grain overload) increases the quantity of lactic acid (lactic acidosis) in the rumen, and if such animals are deprived of water, lactic acid can accumulate and result in a drop of the pH of fluids covering ruminal mucosa. This outcome results in acid burns followed by loss of the epithelium and exposure of the basement membrane and subjacent vascularized connective tissue of the lamina propria and ECM tissues. Additionally, the long-term use of antibiotics in feeds can disrupt the protective environment created by normal microbial flora and lead to colonization and invasion of the mucosa by these fungi. Angioinvasive fungi (i.e., fungal hyphae or other elements) are able to invade and colonize the injured mucosa (mycotic rumenitis and/or abomasitis) and invade the vasculature of the ECM, and then spread regionally to other organ systems such as the liver (granulomatous fungal hepatitis) (see Figs. 8-51 and 14-51). The biologic materials in cells walls of fungi characteristically elicit a granulomatous inflammatory response because they are difficult for phagocytes to degrade. Thus in this example, granulomatous fungal hepatitis ensues.",

            "text": "Cryptococcosis (Cryptococcus neoformans). The pathogenesis of cryptococcosis has many similarities to those of histoplasmosis, coccidioidomycosis, and blastomycosis discussed earlier. The mechanism of injury is cell lysis likely caused by atrophy secondary to tissue distortion and compression from expanding cryptococcal cysts in brain neuropil. There is little or no inflammation in this disease. C. neoformans has a dimorphic life cycle. The mycelial (basidiospores) phase occurs in extracellular environments (25\u00b0 C), whereas the yeast phase occurs intracellularly within cells of the monocytemacrophage system (37\u00b0 C). Gross lesions include the formation of expansile cystic spaces filled with a gelatinous matrix (the capsule) yellow-white granulomas of varied sizes distributed at random in the lungs (see Fig. 9 -103) and similar-appearing expansile granulomas in lymph nodes. In the disseminated form, lymph nodes, skin, subcutaneous tissues, eyes, brain, and bone may also become infected by spread of yeast-infected macrophages via leukocyte trafficking and develop a pyogranulomatous inflammatory response. A primary skin infection can also occur by direct infection of damaged skin, but rarely.Fungus is present in the soil and with suitable growing conditions, produces conidia (\u2248 2 to 10 \u00b5m in diameter) that are carried into the air by disruption of the soil. Animals inhale conidia, which are deposited on and trapped in the mucus layer of mucosa of airways through centrifugal and inertial turbulence. In the mucus layer, conidia bind to alveolar macrophages via surface adhesins, such as BAD1 (Blastomyces adhesion factor 1). Several concurrent events may now occur, including (1) phagocytosis and killing of conidia by mucosal macrophages and neutrophils initiated by surface binding, (2) spread of conidia via leukocyte trafficking into and through mucosae, and (3) acute inflammation with tissue damage facilitated by proinflammatory cytokines released from macrophages. Inflammation with degradation of mucosa and ECM assist the fungus in encountering cells and tissues throughout lung parenchyma and spreading into lamina propria, submucosa, and deeper ECM tissues.Because conidia are quickly killed by mucosal macrophages, they rapidly transition to the yeast form (\u224812 to 15 \u00b5m in diameter) because it is more resistant to phagocytosis and killing by macrophages and neutrophils. Yeast accomplish this outcome by shedding their surface adhesins and/or produce masking capsules that allow them to avoid recognition by macrophages and neutrophils and evade phagocytosis and killing. However, because macrophages have short life spans (6 to 16 days), yeast and yeast-derived debris such as polysaccharides are released from dead macrophages into lung tissues. These materials act as chemokines and cytokines and help recruit additional macrophages and neutrophils into affected lung tissues. This process is repetitive, and lesions characteristic of blastomycosis ensue as the volume of pyogranulomatous inflammatory exudate grows within the lamina propria, submucosa, and deeper ECM tissues.In the yeast phase the fungus has immune-modulating virulence factors (e.g., glucans) in its cell wall and other virulence factors (e.g., melanin) that provide resistance to phagocytosis and killing. Yeast evades the adaptive immune system by changing surface polysaccharides and by hiding in phagosomes. Additionally, yeast has the adhesion-promoting protein BAD1,which mediates adherence to CR3 and CD14 receptors on cell membranes of alveolar macrophages. ",
