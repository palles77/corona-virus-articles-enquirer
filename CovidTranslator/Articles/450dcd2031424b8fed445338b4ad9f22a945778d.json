Spreading beyond national boundaries, a shift in worldview to the \"global village\" 1 is bringing nations, races and ethnic groups together through economic activities, new media, cultural exchange, and easy travel. These unprecedented alliances are eroding physical and political barriers and opening up new opportunities for growth and change. 2 Widespread infections like HIV, H5N1 virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), and most recently H1N1, demonstrate the need to tackle health issues globally rather than locally. 3e6 In addition, initiatives like the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, United Nations Millennium Development Goals (MDG), the Global Fund and the United President's Emergency Fund for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) have in different ways dramatically increased awareness of the state of global health. The poor state of health care delivery in many parts of the world and widening global health disparities increasingly are considered national security priority issues in many high resource countries. 7, 8 Tackling the global burden of disease will require improvement in accessibility to health care and the reversal of the disequilibrium in global health research investment that allots over 90% of the available funds to health problems affecting only 10% of the world population. 9 Furthermore, there is urgent need to develop innovative therapies and expand access to current therapies against diseases like the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), multi-drug resistant tuberculosis (TB), and numerous emerging infectious diseases that pose major threats to the health of people in both resource-limited and resource-rich countries. 8 The discovery of these interventions and their accessibility will depend on the extension of clinical research studies to previously underrepresented populations across the world. 9, 10 The conduct of such clinical studies at these international sites, especially in developing countries obviously are fraught with numerous challenges that require patience, an understanding of the local culture, and a firm determination to do the right thing. Some of these challenges include lack of well-developed Institutional Review Boards (IRBs), weak local research infrastructures, inadequate research workforce, language barriers, and poor socioeconomic status of the participants.",

Despite increases in the life expectancy and living standards in low and medium income countries, there is a widening health disparity with rapid increases in the prevalence of chronic non-communicable diseases like hypertension, diabetes, and cancer. 13 Since 2008, CNCD have been the predominant cause of death worldwide. 14 The World Health Organization (WHO) has predicted that 75% of all the deaths worldwide by 2020 will be due to CNCD with the majority of these occurring in developing countries. 13 In order to alleviate the enormous global burden of communicable and non-communicable diseases, especially as it disproportionately impacts resource-limited countries, we must develop evidence-based interventions including better characterization of disease patterns and their associated socio-epidemiological factors. More efforts are needed to understand the pathogenesis of disease and the discovery of novel therapies targeted at neglected diseases that contribute to global heath disparities and inequities. 10 ",

            "text": "Many landmark discoveries having a significant impact on human health have emanated from clinical research conducted between investigators across geographical boundaries. Although some discoveries might be considered chance findings, many were achieved through transnational collaborations and meticulous execution. Epitomizing the role of international clinical scientist, in 1892 the exhaustive efforts of Sir Ronald Ross led him to the discovery that the mosquito bite is the channel through which malaria is passed to humans. 15 He later embarked on malaria control programs that spanned four continents with impact across and within various communities, including the construction of the Panama Canal. 16 Burkitt's lymphoma, first described by the English surgeon Denis Burkitt while working in Uganda, 17 was later associated with Epstein-Barr virus infection in the United Kingdom from tumor samples obtained from Africa. 18 The efficacy of oral rehydration therapy (ORT), which has completely revolutionized the treatment of diarrheal diseases, was established in studies done in Bangladesh. 19 The development of the yellow fever vaccine by Max Theiler also depended on findings extracted from different continents. 20 In 1968, Professor Familusi of the virology laboratory of the University of Ibadan in Nigeria identified Mokola virus as a cause of devastating aseptic meningitis. 21 The full exploration of genetic information is believed to be the last frontier in medicine that will lead to the identification of the causes of disease, and their cures. 22 Building on this is another sterling example of the immense potential of cross-border collaboration, the Hap Map project. 23 It contains genetic information obtained from people of different ethnic and racial backgrounds across the world (Chinese, Japanese, Europeans, Nigerians, etc.). The publicly accessible genetic information provides a valuable resource for investigators that hopefully will lead to not only the identification of genes associated with specific diseases but their treatment response.",

Moreover, rapid subject accrual is seen as an opportunity to bring new drugs to market more quickly. 28 While this shift by pharmaceutical companies is most welcome, there are significant moral and ethical challenges that must be addressed promptly and adequately by the scientific community at a time when health disparities continue to widen and life expectancies in some low resource countries continue to fall. 29 Expanded global research should encompass equity, reduce health disparities, and promote societal benefits while advancing scientific discoveries.

Second, ethical requirements of Institutional Review Boards for human studies vary between countries. 72 In some cases in the developing world, they are in conflict as to whether their requirements should mirror what is available in the west or be tailored to the local reality.

In a place like Costa Rica, health workers are revered with the population willing to participate in studies when approached. In contrast, rural residents in Kenya, Nigeria, and other parts of sub-Saharan Africa will not respond favorably to researchers (visitors) asking about their personal habits. Potential participants also are biased against public servants. Changing these attitudes will happen only when clinical studies are congruent with communities' perceived needs. 74 Studies on disease not considered a priority by the people may have difficulty in attracting and retaining participants. To find out the needs of a community, researchers must invest time in community engagement and education through information sessions first with community leaders and then with the community at large. Time should be allowed for a question-and-answer session where all ideas/concerns/ attitudes are explored and societal benefits are highlighted. 75, 76 Additionally, ethical issues should be addressed comprehensively while being sensitive to the local needs and cultures. 77, 78 Other issues should be considered carefully before embarking on studies in these developing countries. Of primary importance are the measures taken to protect the privacy of research participants, especially in studies involving stigmatized diseases such as HIV and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Behaviors associated with these diseases such as homosexuality can carry risk of physical attack, and in some cases death. Repeated home visits by research workers also may bring to the attention of the whole community the health problems of study subjects, again leading to stigmatization. 79 It is advisable to ensure that the consent process is written at a 6th grade level at least for increased understanding, 80 and it should be as informational as possible going beyond simply translating into local languages. Tests should be conducted in order to assess the level of understanding of the consent at the commencement of the study and also regularly throughout the study duration. 80 Where surveys are involved, methods of maintaining quality control over the interviews should include the use of tape recorders, repeating questions, repeating visits, monitoring by supervisory staff and rapid review of completed questionnaires to identify errors and inconsistencies in subject responses. Ownership of the data and authorships also should be discussed ahead especially with local collaborators in order to avoid future conflicts.",

Ideally, this should be developed prior to initiation of any clinical trial to define activities that need monitoring such as informed consent, integrity of data collection, processing, and review of plans for adverse events handling, protocol deviation and violations. In clinical trials where death or morbidity are potential end points, the DSMP should involve creation of a data safety monitoring board (DSMB) to make timely decisions about the need to stop a study prematurely or to modify informed consent forms if necessary to deal with emerging risks.",
