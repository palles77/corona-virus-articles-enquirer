The receptor-like protein was identified by exploiting the molecular mimicry potential of anti-idiotypic antibodies. A single-chain Fv molecule derived from the monoclonal antibody 7A (Mab-7A), which recognizes the CP of TuMV, was produced in Escherichia coli and the recombinant protein was used to raise rabbit antibodies. The immune serum reacted with Mab-7A but not with a monoclonal antibody of the same isotype, indicating that anti-idiotypic antibodies were produced. These anti-idiotypic antibodies recognized a 37 kDa protein from Lactuca sativa. Complex formation between the anti-idiotypic antibodies and the plant protein was inhibited by the CP of TuMV which indicates that the plant protein interacts with the viral protein. The 37 kDa protein was localized in chloroplasts and was detected in other plant species.",

            "text": "The infection of susceptible plant hosts by RNA viruses depends on the association of host and viral factors for the replication of the viral genome, the expression of viral genes and the movement of virus throughout the plant [44] . Consequently, plant and viral proteinprotein interactions are presumed to play a pivotal role in disease development. One viral protein believed to interact with host components is the capsid protein (CP). The CP has a structural role but is also necessary for virion translocation in the plant and aphid transmissibility [2, 9, 25, 37, 41] . Furthermore, in the case of alfalfa mosaic virus (AlMV), the CP participates in viral RNA replication [30] . In addition, the CP has been reported to be the interface in the defense response in Nicotiana sylvestris carrying the N 0 resistance gene against tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) [6] and in Solanum tuberosum carrying the Rx resisty In memoriam. ance gene against potato virus X [16, 33] . The plant proteins involved in the interaction with the CP are thought to be early components of a signal transduction pathway similar to that of the TMV resistance N gene of Nicotiana tabacum [42] . However, the identity of the plant components interacting with CPs has not been established. Protein-protein interactions, such as receptor-ligand complexes, have been studied using the idiotype-anti-idiotype network approach [23] . This approach involves the preparation of an anti-ligand monoclonal antibody (Mab) which is subsequently used as immunogen to obtain anti-anti-ligand or antiidiotypic antibodies (anti-ids). If the anti-ligand antibody and the receptor protein interact with the same region of the ligand, a sub-population of the anti-ids could potentially mimic the ligand epitope and bind to the receptor protein. Anti-ids have been used to identify cell surface receptors for hormones and animal viruses [16, 31] and in vaccination [27] . Likewise, Akimitsu et al. [1] used anti-ids for the detection of the plant cell surface receptor for victorin. The anti-idiotypic approach was used in this study to identify plant proteins interacting with the CP of turnip mosaic potyvirus (TuMV). The CP of potyviruses is a three-domain protein with the N-and C-terminal ends exposed on the surface of the virion and the central domain forming the core subunit structure [39] . The highly conserved central region is needed for encapsidation of the viral RNA while the highly variable, surface-exposed, Nterminal and C-terminal regions are involved in hostvector-virus interactions and/or transport functions [2, 9, 25] . Monoclonal antibodies (Mab) have previously been raised against the 33 kDa CP of TuMV [21] . Here, an antibody derivative of Mab TuMV-7A was synthesized. This derivative, known as a single-chain Fv (sc-Fv) molecule [24] , consisted of the heavy-and light-chain variable domains of the parent immunoglobulin joined together by a flexible peptide linker and was expressed in Escherichia coli. A polyclonal serum was raised against the recombinant protein which also reacted with a 37 kDa protein found in chloroplasts of Lactuca sativa. The interaction between the anti-scFv-7A serum and the chloroplast protein was inhibited by the presence of TuMV CP. These characteristics suggest that the chloroplast protein may interact with the CP of TuMV.",

Thermus aquaticus DNA polymerase (Bio/Can Scientific) was used for amplification and reaction conditions were as recommended by the manufacturer. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplifications of the V L V H coding regions were carried out independently. The cDNAs were amplified for 30 cycles and each cycle consisted of a 1 min denaturation (94 ae C), 1 min annealing (60 ae C) and a 2 min extension (72 ae C). Primers VH1FOR-2 (5 0 -TG-AGGAGCAGGTGACCGTGGTCCCTTGGCCCC-3 0 ) and VH1BACK (5 0 -AGGTSMARCTGCAGSAGTC-WGG-3 0 : where S = C or G; M = A or G; W = A or T) were used to amplify the V H region.

Gel-purified V H and V K amplified fragments (100 ng each) were mixed with 20 ng of the linker DNA fragment encoding the peptide (Gly4Ser)3 in a 50 \u090cl reaction mixture without primers and amplified for seven cycles (94 ae C for 1 min, 72 ae C for 2.5 min) with Vent DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs) to randomly join the fragments, then amplified for 23 cycles (94 ae C for 1 min, 60 ae C for 2 min, and 72 ae C for 2 min) using 25 pmol each of VH1BACK and VK4FOR, which contained NcoI and NotI restriction sites respectively.

This strategy was chosen to minimize production of anti-isotypic and anti-allotypic antibod-ies. The TuMV 7A monoclonal cell line was produced using purified TuMV nucleoprotein; for TuMV, the virion is composed of ca. 2000 copies of the CP, surrounding the RNA to which is attached one copy of the virus-encoded VPg protein [21] . The cDNA encoding the scFv molecule was obtained via RT-PCR using RNA extracted from the mouse hybridoma cell line; the amplified fragments coded for the variable domain of both the light and heavy chains. scFv molecules built using the RT-PCR approach used here have been shown to bind their respective antigen similar to that of their parent immunoglobulin molecules [22] . The assembled gene was sequenced and characterized as an IgG 2a-subclass immunoglobulin (data not shown). The Mab-7A had previously been identified as an IgG 2a by immunoanalysis using isotypic-specific antibodies (data not shown). The chimeric gene was cloned into expression vector pET22b for high-level expression in E. coli. A fusion protein of the predicted size (31 kDa) was found to accumulate in inclusion bodies as indicated by SDS-PAGE ( Figure 1A ). An anti-mouse Fab serum (ICN) reacted with the recombinant protein, confirming that an immunoglobulinderived molecule had been synthesized ( Figure 1B) . The recombinant protein was purified and injected into rabbits to raise antibodies. As expected, the resulting serum recognized the scFv-7A protein ( Figure 1C ). Because the scFv-7A molecule is made up exclusively of the variable domains of the parent immunoglobulin, it was expected that anti-ids were predominantly produced. An ELISA was performed to test for their presence in the serum. The wells were coated either with Mab-7A or the control Mab-7-10A of unrelated specificity but of the same isotype (IgG 2a) [7] and incubated with various dilutions of the anti-scFv-7A serum and a non-immune serum. The immune serum reacted preferentially with Mab-7A ( Figure 2 , filled squares), which indicates that scFv-7A was indeed a derivative of Mab-7A and that anti-ids were mainly produced since the rabbit serum did not react with the isotypic control antibody.",

The competition was first per- formed by immunoblotting: total plant proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred onto PVDF membrane and incubated with the anti-scFv-7A serum in the absence or presence of CP. As control, recombinant scFv-7A was also transferred. Although the signal for the scFv-7A-anti-scFv-7A complex decreased only slightly when CP was present during the incubation, the signal for the 37 kDa protein was only 40% of the original signal (Figure 4) . To confirm the displacement seen by immunoblotting, competition experiments in ELISA plates were performed in which wells were coated with plant proteins and incubated with the anti-scFv-7A serum and with increasing quantities of E. coli lysate containing CP [35] . The CP lysate competed with anti-scFv-7A antibodies for binding the 37 kDa protein, showing an average 35% decrease in signal strength with the addition of lysate containing 1.5 ng of CP, compared to that generated with the negative control lysate containing an equal amount of protein .",

Evidence for such a protein was first the observation that the anti-ids against Mab-7A recognized a 37 kDa plant protein. However, the antibodies involved could have detected a framework feature of Mab-7A found also on the plant protein. The operational criterion supporting the identification of an interacting protein was thus the inhibition of the anti-ids-plant protein complex formation by CP, the antigen used for the production of Mab-7A. This criterion of competitive inhibition between anti-ids and antigen for binding the cellular protein has been used in other studies as evidence that the identified cellular protein is a receptor for the antigen [18, 40, 43] .",

[20] showed that the selective inhibition of photosystem II (PS II) in spinach by TMV resulted from the association of the CP with the PS II complex. Recently, the YSI/1 mutant of the common strain (U1) of TMV was found to induce a severe yellow mosaic in N. tabacum instead of the light green/dark green mosaic of the parental strain. The CP accumulated several-fold in chloroplasts and the chlorosis was linked to a single amino acid substitution near the Nterminal end of the CP [3] , suggesting that this region of the viral protein was responsible for more severe symptoms. However, the relationship between CP and chloroplasts is not clear.",

Calmar, which is susceptible to infection by TuMV, were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to PVDF membrane and incubated (without renaturation) with the anti-scFv-7A serum. A protein of 37 kDa, which was not observed after incubation with the pre-immune serum (Figure 3, lane 1), reacted with the immune serum (Figure 3, lane 2). Incubation of the membrane with the anti-scFv-7A serum was also done in the presence of scFv-7A proteins in order to compete with the membrane-bound 37 kDa protein. That competition reduced the intensity of the band observed in the 37 kDa region of the gel(Figure 3, lane 3), indicating that the signal was the result of specific interaction of anti-scFv-7A antibodies with the 37 kDa plant protein. This set of experiments indicated that anti-scFv-7A antibodies specifically recognized a 37-kDa protein from L. sativa.",
