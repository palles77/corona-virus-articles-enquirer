            "text": "Background: Hospital-acquired pneumonia arising in non-ventilated patients (NVHAP) is traditionally thought to be caused by bacteria, and little is known about viral etiologies in this syndrome. We sought to describe the prevalence of viruses causing NVHAP and to determine factors independently associated with the isolation of a virus. Methods: We identified patients with NVHAP over one year and reviewed their cultures to determine etiologies. Patients with a viral process were compared to those with either negative cultures or a bacterial infection to determine variables independently associated with the recovery of a virus. Results: Among 174 cases, cultures were positive in 46.0%, with viruses identified in 22.4%. Bacterial pathogens arose 23.6% of subjects. The most common viruses included rhinovirus, influenza, and parainfluenza. We noted no seasonality in the isolation of viral organisms, and most cases of viral NVHAP developed after more than a week length of stay (LOS). Outcomes in viral NVHAP were similar to those with bacterial NVHAP. Patients with viral and bacterial NVHAP were generally similar. Two variables were independently associated with isolation of a virus: a history of coronary artery disease (adjusted odds ratio: 5.16, 95% CI: 1.14e22.44) and a LOS of greater than 10 days prior to NVHAP diagnosis (adjusted odds ratio: 2.97, 95% CI: 1.35e6.51). As a screening test for a virus, neither had a good sensitivity or specificity. Conclusions: Viruses represent a common cause of NVHAP. Clinicians should consider viral diagnostic testing in NVHAP, as this may represent a means to enhance antimicrobial stewardship.",

            "text": "Nosocomial pneumonia (NP) remains an important hospitalacquired complication resulting in substantial morbidity and mortality [1] . Comprising both ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) arising in the nonventilated subject, NP is the focus of multiple quality efforts in hospitals across the globe [1e3] . The majority of research into NP has dealt with VAP, mainly because patients at risk for VAP are easy to identify given their location in an intensive care unit (ICU). As such, less is known about HAP arising in non-ventilated patient (NVHAP). Thus, conclusions based on studies conducted in VAP are often generalized to NVHAP [1] . However, the pool of persons at risk for NVHAP is substantially larger than the cohort of those at risk for VAP. Only the relatively small proportion of hospitalized patients undergoing mechanical ventilation (MV) may develop VAP, while the vast majority of subjects in the hospital never require MV. Therefore, there is a need for more information regarding NVHAP, particularly as it relates to the microbiology and outcomes in NVHAP.",

For example, Jain and colleagues in a multicenter observational study of hospitalized CAP noted that viruses were a more prevalent cause of the infection than were bacteria [4] . Similarly, investigators have implicated viral organisms as a major cause of VAP. Hong et al. isolated viruses in more than 20% of VAP cases [5] .",

We included only adults (age 18 years) admitted to the hospital for at least 48 h. We excluded subjects transferred from other healthcare facilities and persons who required MV (and were subsequently extuabted) in the 48 h prior to the onset of their new pneumonia. In other words we excluded both VAP and processes that likely evolved while the patient was on MV. Subjects needing MV as support for their NVHAP were enrolled. If patients suffered multiple episodes of NVHAP, only the first instance was included. As this study was retrospective, the hospital's institutional review board waived any need for informed consent (IRB# 201409001).",

Subsequently, chest imaging for all identified potential cases was reviewed by one investigator (MHK) to ensure that 1) there was a new or progressive infiltrate and that 2) this infiltrate did, in fact, arise after 48 h of being hospitalized (eg, was not present on admission). In addition to radiographic results to ensure the presence of pneumonia, all cases were required to meet at least meet two of the following criteria: fever (greater than 38 C) or hypothermia, leukocytosis or leukopenia, and purulent respiratory secretions).",

We further determined the results from a variety of viral diagnostic techniques to include qualitative nucleic acid tests for respiratory viruses and select bacterial pathogens (FilmArray \u00ae Respiratory Panel, BioFire Diagnostics, Inc, Salt Lake City, Utah). It is standard practice at the study instittuion to obtain viral panels on all patients with suspected pneumonia, irrespective of whether they are ventilated.

Patients with viruses were more likely to have been cared for in an ICU in the week prior to NVHAP onset, but this difference only approached statistical significance. CAD was less prevalent in patients with viral infections. For other variables such as the Charlson score and the LOS prior to NVHAP there were no significant differences among subjects as a function of the results of their respiratory cultures. Table 2 shows the results of bivariate comparisons between those with positive viral findings and others with NVHAP. As with the general comparisons across the three strata of possible culture results, there were few differences. Again, CAD was less prevalent in those with a viral etiology for NVHAP. Neither the distribution of other co-morbidities nor the Charlson score varied based on culture findings. There also was no difference based on whether the patient had undergone surgery while hospitalized or had required ICU care prior to pneumonia diagnosis. Those with a virus identified as responsible for their infection were hospitalized longer than those without such an etiology (6.0 days vs 4.5 days), but this difference only approached statistical significance. However, persons with a viral NVHAP were twice as likely to have required a prolonged hospitalization (eg > 10 days) before NVHAP development (41.0% vs 20.7%, p \u00bc 0.020). There were no differences in outcomes (eg, hospital mortality, LOS after NVHAP, 30-day readmission) based on whether a virus was or was not recovered. Only two variables were independently associated with isolation of a virus based on logistic regression. Persons with a history of CAD were approximately 5 times more likely to have a viral etiology, (AOR 5.16, 95% CI: 1.14e22.44, p \u00bc 0.003). Although CAD occurred infrequently among those with viral pathogens, this variable remained associated with viral infection as many other variables entered into the model were co-linear with each other and so CAD became significant as part of the step-wise elimination process. Additionally, a LOS of greater than 10 days prior to NVHAP diagnosis correlated with the recovery of a virus (AOR 2.97, 95% CI: 1.35e6.51). The final model had a good fit based on a HL p value of 0.30. As a screening test for the isolation of a virus in NVHAP, neither of the above factors, nor their combination, had good sensitivity or specificity at predicting the eventual results of cultures.",

[9] These same investigators in a separate study confirmed that viral organisms could also be found in persons suffering from VAP. Among a cohort of persons with VAP, 22.5% had their infection caused by a virus [9] . The most common viruses in VAP were respiratory syncytial virus and parainfluenza virus.",

            "text": "Our study builds on these earlier reports by revealing that viruses are a major cause of another form of NP, in this case NVHAP. No prior work has expressly focused on the role of viruses in NVHAP. Furthermore, little information exists generally describing the microbiology of NVHAP. Therefore our findings are important in that they help to confirm that the etiologic agents of VAP are generally similar to those in NVHAP. Our results also indicate that a search for a viral etiology in NVHAP is prudent, especially if bacterial cultures are unrevealing. Although select clinical variable occur more commonly in persons with a viral cause of NVHAP, reliance on these factors to either reliably include or exclude the presence of a bacterial pathogen is imprudent. The characteristics we identified as being independently linked with isolation of virus still occur commonly in subjects with a bacterial infection. Additionally, some of the independent associations we noted between clinical features and isolation of a viral pathogen lack clear biologic plausibility to explain the potentian connection (eg the relationship between CAD and viral pathogens). Therefore these findings much be interpreted with caution. Thus, clinicians should continue to empirically treat those patients diagnosed with NVHAP with antibiotics pending the results of cultures that can guide antibiotic deescalation. On the other hand, adding a search for a viral organism to routine cultures might facilitate antibiotic discontinuation. If a virus is eventually identified and bacterial cultures remain negative then those antibiotics can likely be discontinued. Given the prevalence of virus in NVHAP that we note, the potential to limit antibiotic prescribing may be substantial. Similarly, the relatively high frequency of virus noted in NVHAP, along with the results of the studies noted above in CAP and VAP, suggest that efforts to develop rapid diagnostic microbiology testing for respiratory infections needs to include tests for viral etiologies. Failure to do so might result in subjects remaining on antibiotics when they no longer truly will benefit from them.",

            "text": "Our study has a number of limitations. First, it represents a retrospective effort and thus is prone to multiple forms of bias. Specifically, the fact that viral testing was not systematically undertaken in all cases suggests that viral infections were certainly missed. Hence, we may have actually underestimated the prevalence of viral organisms in this syndrome. Second, both bacterial and viral diagnostic tests and cultures are imperfect. Patients with actual infections with either types of pathogens might have been misclassified as culture negative when they did, in fact, have their infections arise from either a virus or bacterium. Third, although the ordering of viral panels is routine for suspected pneumonia at the study hospital, the quality of the specimens obtained certainly varied. Some patients were more able to expectorate sputum that could be analyzed. This may have led to our underestimating the prevalence of select pathogens. The use of nasopharyngeal swabs in patients unable to provide sputum, however, should mitigate, to some degree, the impact of this factor. Fourth, we failed to note any mixed viral and bacterial infections or any infections in with multiple viruses. This observation, along with the point above, reinforces concern that specimens may have been inadequate in some patients for diagnostic purposes, particularly bacterial culture. Our inability to review lower airway cultures on all patients is a necessary limitation of any effort to understand pneumonia in non-ventilated patients. Fifth, our findings derive from a single large academic hospital. Thus, the generalizability of our observations is certainly limited. Taken as a hole these multiple limitations demonstrate that our results need to be viewed as hypothesis generating and in need to confirmation.",
