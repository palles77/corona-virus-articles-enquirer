It has a diversity of ethnic groups and is now placing itself firmly in the areas of eco-tourism and sport tourism (Lew, Yu, Ap and Guangrui, 2003) . Importantly, China has a long history and is comparable to India, Egypt and ancient European civilisations making it rich in cultural and historic attractions (Zhang, Pine and Lam, 2005) . It has a civilisation that is more than 5,000 years old (Shen, 2003) . The Olympics, which is the foremost sporting event in the world, will be in Beijing and other lesser known cities such as Qingdao in 2008. The Olympics will be a vast showcase for China's tourism potential.",

Theme parks in particular are booming with the Splendid China, Window of the World and the Chinese Folk Culture Village in Shenzhen, Southern China (Wu, Zhu and Xu, 2000) . The popularity of theme/amusement parks is demonstrated in Table 4 .1, which indicates that theme/amusement parks account for almost one-third of all tourist attraction spend. The popularity of theme parks continues with new parks planned on the mainland and in Hong Kong and Macau. In 2005, Disney opened in Hong Kong, and there are plans for another Disney in Shanghai by 2010. In Macau, over 90% of the population is employed in tourism, and there are plans to recreate San Francisco's Pier 39 as a tourist attraction. As is indicated by Table 4 .1, aside from theme/amusement parks China's major tourism products are its cultural and historic attractions (Wang and Qu, 2004) . It is these attractions that are most popular with international tourists. Zhong, Pine and Zhong (2000) and Gu (2003) identified four stages of tourism development in the People's Republic of China (PRC) from 1949. These include the following:",

A country that had seen almost no tourists for 12 years was almost overnight open for business. The reasons for this were that after great and lengthy debate, the economic impact and benefits of tourism were recognised. Tourism was regarded as especially important for its potential as a foreign currency earner and as an important economic activity providing employment and income.",

The downturn in international tourism in 2003 was largely a consequence of the SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) outbreak, when pleasure tourists decided to stay at home or visit other, safer destinations. Table 4 .5 illustrates the number of arrivals by purpose of visit. The largest increase from 1999 to 2004 has been in business visits. This increase of over one-third shows the importance of China as a business centre and is an indicator of the economic opportunity that is available in China. It is also an indicator of the strength of the Chinese economy that is now greater than that of the United Kingdom and is set to overtake Germany by 2007. The rate of growth of business travel (33.5% between 1999 and 2004) also illustrates the phenomenal growth rate of the Chinese economy that is doubling in size approximately every eight years. Table 4 .6 gives an interesting perspective on tourism arrivals by country of origin. Almost 60% of tourism arrivals to China are from Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan. This indicates the ease of travel from these places The economic importance of international tourism to China As a major player in international tourism, China is reaping enormous economic benefits. Table 4 .7 shows the receipts from incoming tourism. The table shows two figures: the current growth rate and the constant growth rate. Of the two, the more important is probably the constant growth rate as this compares spending although prices have remained the same. The figures illustrate the erratic and demand elastic nature of tourism where the SARS epidemic caused a constant growth rate reduction of 17.6% in 2003.",

            "text": "India is one of the world's oldest civilisations and has diversity within both its religions and its peoples. India has a variety of tourist attractions that include wildlife parks, beaches such as Goa, ancient monuments of which the most famous is probably the Taj Mahal, sites of pilgrimage, music and festivals, palaces and forts and hill stations such as Ooty. Yet despite this wealth of offering, India is regarded as a sleeping giant of tourism. It does not, at present, receive the number of tourists that are commensurate with its size and offerings. As Abram et al. (1999) say, it should be a Mecca for tourism, instead it is a sleeping giant. It may, however, be a sleeping giant that is to be awoken. Table 4 .11 shows India's top tourism attractions by type and sales in 2004. Table 4 .11 clearly indicates that historic buildings and sites are by far the most popular tourist attractions in India. They account for well over half of all tourist expenditure on attractions. These attractions include the Taj Mahal (see Table 4 .12). The Indian government gave a boost to visits to historic monuments by overseas tourists when it dropped the policy of increased prices to such attractions to foreign visitors. Attractions gaining in popularity are amusement parks (Euromonitor, 2005b) . Table 4 .12 shows tourist attractions by visitors. The top five attractions each have visitors in excess of 1 million each year. The Taj Mahal, closely followed by other historic monuments that represent India's historic and cultural tradition, probably unsurprisingly, heads the table. Tourism development, planning and policy in India Gupta, Lal and Bhattacharyya (2002) state that tourism planning started in India in 1945, when it was recommended that a separate tourist organisation with regional offices should be established. By 1948, this had become an ad hoc committee, which included representatives from the hospitality, tourism and transport industries.",

Additionally, it provides market research (including providing statistical information) and administration.

Tourism is now regarded as a major driver of the Indian economy for the earnings and the employment that it brings. These figures came at a time when India received international accolades as a major tourism destination. The reasons for the turnaround in the fortune of the Indian tourist industry are mainly due to improvements to infrastructure and marketing and the alleviation of health fears. With regard to marketing, India has placed much time and effort into evolving the country as a major tourism destination and a global brand. Twenty-nine billion rupees have been allocated to improving the marketing effort of India's tourism. The government has given its support to publicity campaigns. Improvements have been made to the tourism infrastructure; this has been mostly manifested in improvements to a number of major airports. While these improvements are acknowledged, further improvements need to be made to the road and other transport networks. Table 4 .13 shows that arrivals to India have increased by 35.25% from 1999 to 2004, there have been increases in three of the categories of purpose of travel. The most impressive is in the business category in which travel has more than doubled in six years. These figures reflect the increasing importance of the Indian market on the world stage.

Over the period from 1999 to 2004 there has been a massive increase in outgoing tourism. The reasons for this growth are all connected to the economy. First, there have been general increases in disposable income that is a prerequisite of tourism. Second, the globalisation of the Indian economy has led to the need for Indian business people to travel abroad for work (Euromonitor, 2005b ). net exporter of tourism and as such tourism is an invisible export that is a major earner of foreign currency. Tourism contribution is such that it accounts for over 5% of all exports. Its contribution as an invisible export is much greater than this. Given the poor performance of the Indian tourism until recently, the figures indicate the potential of tourism as an earner of foreign currency for the Indian economy. Table 4 .18 shows the increase in domestic tourism in India from 1999 to 2004. Over that period, domestic tourism has increased by over 80% (Euromonitor, 2005b) . Domestic tourism has seen year on year increases each year from 1999 to 2004. Despite the huge increase, the number of trips remains low when the population is taken into consideration. Notwithstanding, this spending on domestic tourism in 2004 stood at over 538 billion rupees. It should be noted that statistics for Indian domestic tourism trips create a difficulty in that business trips are included within them and are not shown separately (Euromonitor, 2005b) . Euromonitor (2005b) and Mintel (2003) give five main reasons for the increase in domestic tourism. These may be summarised as improved facilities, price competition, better disposable incomes, government policy and improved marketing. First, there has been an improvement in tourist facilities, which could further improve with the budget hotels that have arrived in the Indian accommodation market. Second, competition on price between public and private carriers has resulted in prices being cut, and the first budget carrier -Air Deccan -has arrived in the air transport market.",
