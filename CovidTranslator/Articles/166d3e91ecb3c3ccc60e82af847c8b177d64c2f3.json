Forty seven field isolates were obtained from cats with acute oral/respiratory disease, chronic oral lesions, and from cats showing vaccine reactions, i.e. clinical signs of FCV infection shortly after vaccination. Eight reference strains including F9 and three vaccine strains based on F9 were also examined. All of the strains of F9, derived from various sources, reacted with all six of the monoclonal antibodies, whereas some of the field isolates did not react with any. In general, the field isolates showed a spectrum of reactivities and selected isolates could be distinguished. However, there were no clear cut differences between the clinical groups. Overall, the oral/respiratory group showed less reactivity with the monoclonals, suggesting they were less related to F9. Although the other groups appeared to be more closely related to F9, none of the isolates tested reacted with all six monoclonal antibodies.",

All six of the monoclonal antibodies were found to react specifically to FCV-F9 infected cells by indirect immunofluorescence and more specifically to the major capsid protein of FCV strain F9 by immunoprecipitation (unpublished data). However, only three (4E7, 4Ell and IG9) of the six monoclonal antibodies reacted with strain F9 in sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and western blotting (Dawson, 1991) . This suggests that monoclonal antibodies 4E7, 4Ell and IG9 may bind to linear epitopes in the major capsid protein, whereas the binding of the others may be conformationally dependent, as has been suggested by Shin et al. (1993) . Dawson (1991) has also demonstrated that only three of these monoclonal antibodies (IG9, 4E7, and 6E8) possess the ability to neutralise vaccine N virus in vitro.

Thus we attempted to use the more focused approach of monoclonal antibody analysis to show these differences more clearly. However, although this study was able to distinguish between selected strains, no clear cut differences between the clinical groups were seen. This would suggest that the epitopes analysed by these monoclonal antibodies were not indicators of FCV clinical origin, and it might be possible that monoclonal antibodies derived either from other epitopes within F9 or from other FCV strains would have enabled better separation. Also, comparison between polyclonal VN analysis of FCV isolates and monoclonal antibody binding patterns may not necessarily yield similar results. Tohya et al. (1990) have shown that there are at least seven neutralising epitopes present on the FCV major capsid protein. Complex interplay between these epitopes, that may not be represented by the monoclonal antibodies used in this study, may have produced the separation seen by Dawson et al. (1993b) .",
