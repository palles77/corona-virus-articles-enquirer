As well as in humans, corona viruses are widespread in other species worldwide, including birds, rabbits, reptiles, cats, dogs, pigs, monkeys, and bats. They can cause respiratory, enteric, hepatic, and neurological diseases of variable severity, and are sometimes fatal in humans. 5, 6 Two of the previously identified strains of coronaviruses-severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARSCoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERSCoV)-have caused widespread epidemics and are zoonotic in origin. 7, 8 2019nCoV is also likely to have a zoonotic origin. Early confirmed cases of the new coronavirus in Wuhan were closely linked to the Huanan seafood market (a wet market), 1,9,10 where a large variety of vertebrate and invertebrate animals, wild caught and farm raised, are sold. Right after the official confirmation of the close linkage between severe pneumonia and the game animals in the market, it was closed on Jan 1, 2020.",

However, through not being able to fully comprehend the essence of the philosophy, many Chinese people mistakenly extend the scope of the homology and simply think that one is made of the supplements they eat. For instance, kidney and penis of deer or tiger are believed to have aphrodisiac effect, and brain of fish or monkey are supposed to make people brighter.",

            "text": "Neisseria gonorrhoeae, the causative pathogen of gonorrhoea, has shown impressive agility in developing resistance to successive classes of antimicrobials used for therapy, leading to a progressive reduction in available treatment options. Ceftriaxone is the lastline treatment option for gonorrhoea, and many countries recommend dual therapy with ceftriaxone (250-1000 mg) in combination with azithromycin (1-2 g). However, since the introduction of dual therapy, the global prevalence of azithromycin resistance has increased. 1 Additionally, the extensively drugresistant N gonorrhoeae FC428 clone, which is associated with ceftriaxone resistance and intermediate resistance to azithromycin, has been reported to have spread internationally, with epidemiological links to the AsiaPacific region. 2 The first treatment failure to dual therapy was reported in the UK in 2016, a heterosexual man with urethral and pharyngeal gonococcal infections acquired in Japan (table) . 3 In 2018, the first strain that was resistant to ceftriaxone (minimum inhibitory concentration [MIC] 0\u00b75 mg/L) and showed a high level of resistance to azithromycin (MIC >256\u00b70 mg/L) was reported, again in the UK, in a heterosexual man with urethral and pharyngeal gonococcal infections acquired in Thailand (table). 4 The urethral infection was successfully treated with ceftriaxone, but the pharyngeal infection persisted and was eventually cleared after 3 days of treatment with intravenous ertapenem (1 g). Of particular concern was the identification of two patients infected with strains of N gonorrhoeae that were genetically identical to the UK",
