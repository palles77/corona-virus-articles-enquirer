There is some evidence that certain types of MG may be associated with increased risk of influenza transmission. MG may also ''seed'' new strains into an area, and may instigate community transmission in a pandemic. Restricting MGs, in combination with other social distancing interventions, may help reduce transmission, but it was not possible to identify conclusive evidence on the individual effect of MG restriction alone. Evidence suggests that event duration and crowdedness may be the key factors that determine the risk of influenza transmission, and possibly the type of venue (indoor/outdoor).",

A variety of non-pharmaceutical public health interventions to reduce close contact between infected and susceptible individuals, or the opportunities for the virus to be picked up by susceptible people such as self-isolation of patients, respiratory etiquette and hand washing have been advocated. Banning or restricting mass gatherings has been seen as a logical extension of this policy, however, it is a particular concern of policy makers that the scientific evidence upon which to base guidance for mass gatherings is lacking. This is particularly important given the need to weigh any potential benefits against the economic and social disruption that banning or restricting mass gatherings could have on society.",

The transmission of other respiratory viruses was also included because of the similarity of transmission and therefore the potential applicability of any results to influenza. An initial ''scoping'' search was followed by further discussions and consultation on the work plan and search strategy. The term mass gathering on its own proved inadequate as a search term as there is no clearly accepted definition of what constitutes a mass gathering. Therefore, a range of additional terms were used, such as public gatherings, social gatherings, large crowds, mass events, festivals, Olympics, Hajj, championship, and others listed in Table 1 . Transit settings such as long-distance flights and cruise ships were not included, as it was decided that these settings would fit better in a separate review of evidence for influenza transmission through transport.

Within this context, the work was carried out within a very tight three-month timeframe and with significantly limited resources. As a result, some of the most comprehensive steps required of a full systematic review could not be realistically accommodated. Therefore, a modified process was adopted in conducting this ''rapid evidence assessment'' rather than a full, formal systematic review. Rapid evidence assessments are well recognized as a pragmatic approach to include all the major elements of a full systematic review, ensuring an outcome that is as comprehensive as possible while accepting limited compromises in order to meet stipulated deadlines for feeding into the policy process [9] .",

However, to try to mitigate these limitations, full draft versions of the review were submitted to national experts at the UK Health Protection Agency and the Scientific Pandemic Influenza committee of the UK Department of Health, seeking their comments and advice on any papers or documents that may have been omitted. Some further work was carried out in May to June 2011 to update the literature.",

However, after completion of the literature search, it was clear that the types of studies and the study design types identified were not suitable for assessment by the CASP tools. Similarly for the outbreak reports included in the review, no suitable existing framework could be readily identified for quality assessment. The ORION tool was not strictly applicable as it is specific to outbreaks of nosocomial infection [13, 14] . Therefore, a modified approach was adopted, whereby each paper was categorized as having low risk, some risk, or high risk for bias with respect to the relevant review question addressed by that study. The grading was assessed based on the presence of significant methodological limitations. A high risk of bias was attributed to papers with at least three significant methodological issues as identified by the review authors, while papers with at least two issues were classified as having some risk. This approach was adapted from a system previously used by Jefferson et al. [7] . The quality of the review itself was tested against checklists based on the MOOSE [15] and PRISMA [16, 17] standards. Within the restrictions of the time constraints already described, key gaps and issues identified by the checklists were addressed as appropriate and/or acknowledged in Sections 2.5 (explaining the review context including time constraints) and 4.4 (recognizing the study limitations).",

The Hajj is an annual religious event that takes place over a number of days in a very small geographic area of Saudi Arabia usually involving 2 to 3 million pilgrims from all over the world. Accommodation is at a premium during this event and many pilgrims stay in tents specifically erected for the event and that are often over-crowded. Although primarily a vaccine efficacy study, the rates of influenza-like illness reported in vaccinated pilgrims were 36% compared with 62% in non-vaccinated pilgrims. However, these results were based on clinical endpoints without microbiologic confirmation; a non-randomized design was used, and the study was not designed to address the primary question of this review.",

In the 2006 Hajj, the same investigators [27] found comparable levels of laboratory confirmed influenza (10-11%) in both UK and Saudi pilgrims. These relatively low levels of infection contrasted with the findings in the cross-sectional study by Deris et al.

A significant proportion of pilgrims are affected by symptoms of either an influenza-like illness or an acute respiratory illness with the proportion affected reaching about 40% in some studies [19, 20] . The Hajj is, however, a unique event with almost 3 million people converging on a relatively small geographic area for a period of at least 5 days, extending up to 4 weeks. Crowd density is very high and overcrowding in the living accommodation is common. Given the unusual nature of this event, the applicability of these findings to other mass gatherings is therefore limited.

The apparently low or absent influenza transmission at such events may also reflect the contemporary fact that many people who attend major sports championships tend to have planned their visit a long time ahead, as ticket sales usually start months or even years in advance. Spectators as well as participants tend to stay in more conventional accommodations such as hotels rather than tents or other forms of portable or camp-style quarters with highly crowded conditions.

Other challenging issues include the problematic ethical and legal frameworks for implementing restrictions for public health purposes [52, 53] , as well as considerable logistical and economic implications. If longplanned events were to be cancelled, who would be liable for the huge personal, corporate and national costs that such cancellations might incur? In considering policy recommendations within a pandemic context, the most practical approach for all but the more severe pandemics may be a strategy of encouraging voluntary restrictions. This would involve giving the public the best available information and advising rather than legislating that organizations and individuals avoid non-essential events where there is at least some evidence of transmission risk. For such a strategy to have a chance of succeeding, it would be most important to have in place a carefully and sensitively prepared communication strategy, since recommendations to avoid public gatherings are likely to run against powerful social pressures to do otherwise [54] . The success of any public health strategy-and this must be particularly true in relation to a potential or imminent pandemic situation-requires the building of trust [55] and an intelligent and purposeful engagement of the public even prior to the event [56] .",

Some studies in this review reflected such an approach; for example, in the historical outbreak investigations where restrictions on mass gatherings were combined with other non-pharmaceutical measures [32, 36, 37] . It would be prudent to apply the best evidence relating to other social distancing interventions in conjunction with any specific policies on mass gatherings.",

It is tempting to speculate on the possibility of a reduction in disease burden; historically, some of the American cities that implemented mass gathering restrictions during the 1918-1919 pandemic seemed to achieve significant reductions in peak morbidity and mortality that may well have reduced the overall burden. However, pragmatically, countries like the United Kingdom aim to achieve a slower spread, to prolong the troughs and to flatten the peaks of the epidemic curves to buy time for countermeasures to take effect and to enable services to cope with a lower volume of activity.",

There is a need for well-designed studies to more accurately quantify the nature of the infections causing flu-like symptoms at mass gatherings, confirm the key parameters that influence the transmission of influenza in these settings, and to directly assess the impact of mass gathering restrictions. But as ''gold standard'' randomized comparison designs are extremely difficult to apply to this kind of intervention, attention needs to focus on optimal observational study options. From a UK perspective, British people travelling abroad for mass gatherings such as the Hajj or other large events could be approached for inclusion in prospective studies for comparison with appropriately matched, nontravelling controls, with care being taken to avoid drawbacks observed in existing studies. Within the UK, mass gatherings ranging from indoor events in theatres and cinemas, to outdoor events such as football matches and major musical events like the Glastonbury festival or Travellers\u00d5 horse fairs represent potential opportunities for carefully designed prospective cohort studies to be undertaken. The biggest issue is persuading funders that given the current paucity of good studies, such further research is still needed.",

Some of the included studies had significant design and quality issues as duly reflected in the individual paper summaries and the discussion, and highlighted in Tables 4 and 6. A common issue with a number of the studies included in the review is that they depended on clinical symptoms like cough or syndromes such as influenza-like illness, rather than laboratory diagnosis of influenza. In such studies it is not possible to isolate the impact of influenza as opposed to other respiratory viruses, and the risk of influenza could potentially be over-interpreted. In the studies where laboratory testing was undertaken, influenza was only confirmed in minority proportions of people with respiratory symptoms, ranging between 6% and 14% [23, 24, 27] , but possibly up to a roughly estimated 40% in one study [25] .",
