Viral and host-related risk factors for severe disease have also not been clearly established. Objective: To assess whether certain viral features of RSV and, or HRV are associated with severe ALRTI. Study design: RSV and HRV were studied in nasopharyngeal samples of infants by immunofluorescence, Luminex \u00ae and/or real-time RT-PCR assays. Quantitation and genotyping of RSV and HRV by PCR were done. Results: Of 124 virus positive specimens, 74 (59.7%) had RSV; 22 (17.7%) HRV and 28 (22.6%) RSV-HRV coinfection. Hospitalization was required in 57/74 RSV infants (77.0%); in 10/22 HRV cases (45.5%) (p = 0.006) and in 15/28 co-infected by both viruses (53.6%) (p = 0.003). Severe cases were 33/74 (44.6%) RSV infections, 2/22 HRV cases (9.1%), (p < 0.002) and 6/28 (21.4%) patients co-infected by RSV-HRV (p < 0.026). Three genotypes (NA1, B7, B9) of RSV circulated during the study. In 33 severe infants, NA1 was detected in 19 cases (57.6%); B7 in 13 (39.4%) and B9 in 1 (3.0%) (p < 0.01; OR = 10.0). RSV loads were similar between outpatients and hospitalized infants (p = 0.7) and among different severities (p = 0.7). NA1 loads were higher than other strains (p = 0.049). Three geno-groups of HRV circulated homogeneously. Conclusion: In very young infants, RSV cause more severe disease than HRV. Co-infection does not increase the severity of illness. NA1 RSV genotype was associated with major frequency of hospitalization, severe respiratory disease and higher viral load.",

No connection has been well established among circulating genotypes and the size of the epidemic, nor with their clinical impact, since results are contradictory [20, 32, 33] . In Chile, it has been detected more frequently epidemics with predominance of group A [34] . Previously, we found no differences between virus genogroup and clinical outcome. Until now, NA1 genotype had not been detected in Chile. This genotype was significantly more related to hospitalized infants and severe disease, especially during the winter season of 2010 and regardless of single RSV infection or a co-infection with HRV. NA1 genotype was previously described and we believe that its introduction in Chile occurred in recent years [35] [36] [37] . This would explain why most of NA1 strains were found during 2010: 14 of 19 strains (73.7%) which also were significantly associated with severe disease. In fact, during 2011, although there was also circulation of NA1, B7 strain was the most prevalent, reducing significantly the severity of disease. Additionally, from 5 infants infected with NA1 in 2011, only one had a severe disease. So, we hypothesized that the emergence of new RSV strains may be associated with severe disease in infants when the general population is still not immune to these new genotypes.",

In a prospective multicenter study, bronchiolitis in African American infants were more often associated with HRV than other children [6] . In our work, HRV infection was concentrated significantly in patients with mild disease, where strains were distributed homogeneously among the three known genogroups. The co-infection with both RSV and HRV viruses did not correlate with a more severe disease. The rate observed in HRV infection is similar to that reported by other authors. However, the clinical behavior of patients differs depending on the design of the studies.

In contrast, in very young infants infected by HRV, the relative immaturity of the immune system may avoid the induction of an intense inflammatory response, as it is seen in older infants or in atopic individuals throughout life. In the future, it will be necessary to compare meticulously the profile of the immune response on different cohorts with rhinovirus infection.",
