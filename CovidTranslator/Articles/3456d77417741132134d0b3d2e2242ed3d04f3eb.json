Unequivocal proofs for the stereostructure of some new arabinosyl pyrimidinone derivatives were obtained by X-ray structure analysis. These newly synthesized compounds were then evaluated for their cytostatic activity against murine leukemia (L1210), and human T-lymphocytes (Molt 4/C8 and CEM). Of all the compounds in the series, the protected silylated tricyclic fused pyrimidinone 10 showed the most significant antitumor activity against murine leukemia L1210 (IC 50 \u00bc 6 mM), and human T-lymphocytes cells Molt 4/C8 (IC 50 \u00bc 7.9 mM) and CEM/0 cell lines (IC 50 \u00bc 7.5 mM).

As part of our research program, we developed the synthesis of a new series of original 1-b-D-arabino furan[1 0 ,2 0 :4,5]oxazolo-and arabino-pyrimidinones via 2-amino-2oxazoline derivatives possessing a 1-b-D-arabinosyl parent. 2-Amino-2-oxazolines are heteroamidine synthons useful for the preparation of various bioactive pyrimidinones through ring annulation, by using the two nucleophilic sites of the amidine moiety. We already developed this approach for obtaining various bicyclic compounds [7] [8] [9] .",

            "text": "N,N-dimethylformamide dimethylacetal (DMFDMA) reacted with 2-amino-b-D-arabinofuran[1 0 ,2 0 :4,5]-2-oxazoline 1 to give the expected amidine 3 (Scheme 2). The N,N 0 -dimethyl-N 0 -alkylformamide 3 was engaged in an alkylation with diketene acetone adduct, followed by spontaneous elimination of dimethylamine, to give the fused b-D-arabinofuran[1 0 ,2 0 :4,5]oxazolopyrimidin-6-one 4. The oxazoline ring opening was then conducted in dilute aqueous ammonia [11, 12] to afford the surprising arabinofuranopyrimidinedione 5 bearing an enamine function. Structural elucidation of 5 was achieved either by 1 H and 13 C NMR, and by X-ray crystallography (Fig. 2) . Especially, 1 H NMR spectrum of 5 revealed two D 2 O exchangeable singlets at 9.93 and 10.84 ppm characteristics of the enamine group in position 5. Moreover, the 13 C NMR spectrum of 5 showed one signal around 98.4 ppm specific for the enamine alkene bond (]C(Me)NH 2 ). The X-ray crystallography data of 5 unambiguously showed the presence two hydrogen on the N(9), whereas the Csp 2 (8)-N(9) bond was found at 1.292(2) \u00c5, as typically observed for C]C-NH 2 bonds [15] . There is an intramolecular hydrogen bond between N(9)-H(9A) and O (7) where the N(9)-O(7) distance is 2.673(2) &angst. Moreover, N(9) is hydrogen bonded to O (11) of the molecule at (x \u00c0 1,\u00c0y \u00c0 1, \u00fez) with N(9)-H(9B)-O(11) \u00bc 2.814(3) \u00c5; other hydrogen bond are found between O (18) and N(5) of the molecule (x, y, z \u00c0 1) where the distance is 2.823(2) \u00c5, and O (20) and O (17) of the molecule (x\u00c01, y \u00fe 1, z) with O (20) .O(17) \u00bc 2.813(2) &angst. The most common type of pucker of sugar rings in nucleosides and nucleotides is with either atom C (14) or atom C(15) displaced from the plane of the other four atoms on the same side as atom C (19) , when the pucker is called C (14) or C(15) endo, respectively. In the structure of 5, the pucker is C(14) endo differing from that observed in previously described uracil-b-D-arabinofuranoside [16] where the pucker is C(14) endo making impossible an intramolecular hydrogen bond between O (20) and O (17) . Finally, spatial structure of 5 also confirmed that the oxazoline ring opening did not modify the C-1 and C-2 absolute configuration of arabinose. Based on the space group determined from crystallographic data (P1), the absolute configurations at C-1 and C-2 of this pure enantiomer were determined to be R and S, respectively. The formation of 5 was probably due to the action of ammonia on the acetyl substituent leading to an imine function which gave the stable enamine group after alkaline oxazoline ring opening.",
