While we would wish to see bigger and better reported studies of the effects of vaccines, we do not believe further public expenditure investigating the safety of aluminium used as adjuvant is justified.

While there was a steady supply of new antibiotics coming onto the market, antibiotic resistance was a problem that could be ignored. Yet the stream of new antibacterials has reduced to a trickle since the 1980s while levels of resistance among many common infectious bacteria have continued to rise. Despite these trends pointing to a future when some bacterial infections may be untreatable, politicians, the general public, and large sections of the medical profession seem unaware of the threat or are unwilling to take the actions necessary to ensure a sustainable future for antibiotics.",

            "text": "A seminar at the Dag Hammarskj\u00f6ld Foundation, Uppsala, Sweden, May 5-7, looked at ways of kick-starting concerted action on antibiotic resistance. Unlike, for example, AIDS or severe acute respiratory syndrome, which are disease entities that pose evident and acute threats, antibiotic resistance cuts across many diseases and poses a chronic threat. Resistance can therefore be a slippery concept to grasp for the non-specialist. In this sense, antibiotic resistance is similar to an environmental threat such as acid rain, depletion of the ozone layer, or global warming-there is evidence of current harm, but the real fear is what might happen in the future if the problem goes unchecked.",

            "text": "This notion prompted the suggestion at the seminar that to promote concerted action a campaigning \"movement\" was needed (eg, an antibiotic resistance Greenpeace). The movement would not be just another professional organisation; instead, it would seek involvement of the general public, politicians, and consumer groups-it would be the face of the socalled faceless threat of antibiotic resistance. Its mission would be to sustain antibiotics as an effective treatment for bacterial infections through raising awareness of the dangers of resistance, promoting access to effective antibiotics for all, rationalising antibiotic use to a necessary minimum, and exploring the need for new antibiotics and alternatives to antibiotics for treatment and prevention.",

            "text": "To generate action, the movement would need a simple, generic message, but it would also have to adapt its presentations of the message to different audiences and in different contexts. For example, politicians might respond to messages based on burden of disease or the costs incurred in dealing with outbreaks of antibioticresistant bacteria; for the public messages based on the possibility of childhood middle-ear infections or pneumonia becoming untreatable might be necessary; whereas for the medical profession, it could be the possibility of transplant surgery becoming a thing of the past.",
