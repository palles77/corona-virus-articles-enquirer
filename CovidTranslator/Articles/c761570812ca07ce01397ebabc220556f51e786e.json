Adoptive transfers of splenocytes from individual LCMV-immune donors resulted in nearly identical VV-induced responses in each of several recipients, but responses differed depending on the donor. This indicates that the specificities of T cell responses that are not shared between individuals may influence cross-reactivity with other antigens and play roles in heterologous immunity upon encounter with another pathogen. This variability in cross-reactive T cell expansion that is unique to the individual may underlie variation in the pathogenesis of infectious diseases.",

Recent work showing human T cell cross-reactivity between influenza virus and hepatitis C virus (5) , between influenza virus and Epstein-Barr virus (6) , between human papilloma virus and coronavirus (7) , and between different strains of dengue virus (8) argues that similar issues of heterologous immunity should be examined in human infections.",

            "text": "Mouse models have shown that a history of a heterologous virus infection can alter the kinetics and the hierarchy of T cells responding to peptide epitopes encoded by the infecting virus, and this skewing of T cell responsiveness may be either beneficial or harmful to the host (2, 6) . Any foreign protein is likely to have several amino acid epitope sequences with appro-priate motifs to engage a given MHC molecule, but the T cell response to a virus infection is usually focused against a narrow subset of these potential epitopes. This is a consequence of T cell immunodominance, which is a very fickle phenomenon. If immunodominant epitopes are experimentally deleted from a pathogen, other epitopes almost invariably emerge to dominate the response (9) . This is either because they become presented better at the MHC level or because they stimulate T cells whose initial frequencies were lower than the originally immunodominant ones (9) . T cell immunodominance can be dramatically affected by a prior infection with a pathogen that encodes an epitope that generates T cells that cross-react with a second pathogen (2) . For example, lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) and Pichinde virus (PV) each encode weak subdominant epitopes with six out of eight amino acids in common. Some T cells can cross-react between those epitopes, and when a host immune to one of those viruses is infected with the other, this weak epitope now dominates the T cell response, and the normally dominant epitopes generate much weaker responses. The higher frequencies of memory T cells specific to this cross-reactive epitope as compared with naive T cells specific to the normally dominant epitopes gives an advantage for proliferative expansion. Similarly, individuals immune to one dengue virus serotype on infection with a second serotype tend to generate T cell responses that better recognize the first serotype, presumably because they were expanded from the memory pool (8) . It is noteworthy that this deviation in T cell responses during dengue infections is associated with serious pathological complications.",

However, in other cases, patterns of heterologous immunity and T cell cross-reactivity may be variable, such as between LCMV and vaccinia virus (VV). A history of an LCMV infection protects mice against VV, reducing VV titers 10-100-fold by day 3 after infection, and dramatically changing the T cell-dependent immunopathology (1, 3) . Adoptive transfer studies indicated that LCMV-immune CD4 and CD8 T cells provided heterologous immunity in this system (1) . Ironically, a history of a VV infection has little effect on immunity to LCMV (1) . VV induces the proliferation of some LCMV-specific memory T cells, but LCMV does not induce detectable proliferation of VV-specific memory T cells (4) . A possible explanation to this enigma is that VV is a virus that encodes \u03fe 200 proteins and perhaps \u03fe 1,000 T cell epitopes with the capacity to trigger memory T cells present at sufficient frequencies. In contrast, LCMV encodes only four proteins. Thus, it seems that the many potential epitopes encoded by VV would more likely stimulate some T cells in an LCMV-specific memory pool than would the much more limited number of LCMV epitopes stimulating a VV-immune pool.",

First, the repertoire is highly diverse, with sometimes hundreds of distinct clones directed against a single epitope (10) (11) (12) . Second, epitope-specific responses between individuals are often dominated by distinct V \u2424 TCR usage and conserved amino acid motifs in the TCR CDR3 region, which recognizes the peptide-MHC (public specificities; references 11, 13, 14) . Third, genetically identical hosts nevertheless have distinct epitope-specific T cell populations with different amino acid sequences in the CDR3 regions (private specificities; refer-ences 10, 15, 16) . We questioned here whether \"private\" determinants, which may not be very important for the recognition of the epitope initially driving that particular T cell, may be important in a cross-reactive recognition of another epitope. This would mean that some individuals experiencing infections in sequence with two viruses may generate cross-reactive responses between the viruses, whereas other individuals with similar MHC would not. This variability could presumably influence viral clearance and immunopathology. Here, we show that the LCMV epitope-specific T cell responses elicited by VV infection are indeed a function of the unique T cell responses of an individual host. Some common patterns are seen, but the private specificities of LCMV-immune T cell populations drive this cross-reactive antigen recognition.",

The hierarchy of responses against different epitopes is very similar between immunologically naive mice ( Fig. 1 and reference 17 ), but the integrity of the LCMV epitope-specific memory CD8 T cell pool is often disrupted by heterologous viral infections, which preferentially expand cross-reactive T cells while deleting noncrossreactive ones (2, 19, 20) . We have elaborated the impacts of two heterologous viruses (PV and VV) on LCMV-immune mice and found that these two viruses generated characteristic and contrasting patterns of T cell responses to epitopes in LCMV-immune mice (2) (3) (4) . PV and LCMV share strongly cross-reactive subdominant epitopes (PV-NP205 and LCMV-NP205) that dominate the immune response when these viruses are infected in sequence ( Fig. 1 A and reference 2). In contrast, VV infection of LCMV-immune mice exhibits a much less predictable pattern, where the specificity of expanded T cells is not always the same between experiments ( Fig. 1 B and references 3, 4) .",

We questioned here whether individual mice could differ dramatically in the patterns of their cross-reactivities to heterologous viruses and sought to compare epitope-specific responses after a heterologous viral infection to the hierarchy of the T cell repertoire in the LCMV-immune mouse before the heterologous viral challenge. To address these issues of immune responses unique to the individual, we adopted a longitudinal analysis method to reiterate the impacts of heterologous PV or VV infections on LCMV-immune mice. First, we exam- ined the frequency and the hierarchy of LCMV-specific CD8 T cells in the peripheral blood of individual LCMV-immune mice before (day 0) PV or VV infection and then at late stages of the heterologous viral challenge (Fig. 1, A and B , day 12). A peptide epitope-induced intracellular IFN-\u2425 assay was used to identify and quantify epitope-specific T cells.",

We summarized the VV-induced changes in the hierarchies of LCMV-specific CD8 T cells in 26 examined mice in Table I . Several distinctive features of heterologous immunity during VV infection were noted. First, the increase in the number of putatively cross-reactive LCMV epitope-specific CD8 T cells was less dramatic and more subtle than the expansion observed during PV infection. In LCMV-immune mouse no. 11, although the frequencies of NP396-, GP33-, GP276-, and GP118-specific CD8 T cells were dramatically and somewhat comparably reduced, the frequency of NP205specific CD8 T cells remained about the same ( Fig. 1 B, 105% of LCMV-immune mice). This maintenance of frequency by the NP205-specific T cells actually represents an increase in number, considering an overall increase in the CD8 T cell percentage upon VV infection. In 26 LCMVimmune control mice, the percentage of CD8 in the PBLs was 10.1 \u03ee 2.3%, whereas the percentage of CD8 cells in the VV-challenged LCMV-immune mice was 20.5 \u03ee 4.5%. Furthermore, given the fact that the total numbers of leukocytes were also routinely increased in the spleen after VV infection (LCMV-immune \u03ed 6.4 \u03ee 2.4 \u03eb 10 7 vs. LCMVimmune \u03e9 VV day 12 \u03ed 15 \u03ee 10 7 ) and well reflected in peripheral blood, the increase in number is expected to be greater.",

As a technique to support the concept of a TCRmediated event, we examined the down-regulation of IL-7 receptors (IL-7R \u2423 ) on CD8 T cells. Virus-specific CD8 T cells in the memory phase express high levels of IL-7R \u2423 , but these become down-regulated on TCR cross-linking. The majority of LCMV-specific memory CD8 T cells are IL-7R \u2423 hi (Fig. 2) , but after secondary LCMV challenge in vivo, \u03fe 50% of the LCMV-specific CD8 T cells of various specificities uniformly down-regulated IL-7R \u2423 on their surface (Fig. 2, top left quadrant) . In contrast, LCMV-immune mice challenged with PV down-regulated IL-7R \u2423 only on the highly cross-reactive NP205-specific T cells (unpublished data). Interestingly, with a VV challenge, the pattern varied between mice. IL-7R \u2423 down-regulation was 23-42% in some mice (nos. 1 and 2) on GP33/34-specific T cells, on another mouse on GP118-specific T cells (no. 3), and on another on NP205-specific T cells (no. 2) (Fig. 2, no. 2). All other epitope-specific responses were \u0545 12%, suggesting very low, if any, TCR stimulation. VV-stimulated LCMV-specific T cells were examined for forward scatter, as an indicator of cell size with regard to IL-7R \u2423 . The cells low in IL-7R \u2423 expression were larger, as indicated by substantially increased forward scatter (e.g., GP33-specific CD8 T cells in no. 2 mouse, FSC of IL-7R low \u03ed 402 vs. high \u03ed 344). These data are consistent with the concept that the T cells are being stimulated through their TCR and, thus, probably proliferating even though the epitope specificity varies between mice.",

Sequencing of a total of 37 NP205-specific V \u2424 16 clones derived from three mice showed one V \u2424 clonotype common to all three mice, but all others were unique to the individual mouse, indicating significant mouse-to-mouse variation in TCRs specific for this epitope, as expected (unpublished data).",

We have identified several VV-encoded amino acid sequences harboring K b binding motifs and partial homology with NP205 (unpublished data).

It shows that these unique private specificities, rather than being meaningless immunological curiosities, impact the recognition of crossreactive antigens encoded by other pathogens and, as a consequence, have the potential to alter the pathogenesis of a viral infection in a manner that is unique to the individual. This work was initially based on the puzzling observation that, unlike LCMV-infected mice challenged with PV, where a clearly defined cross-reactive epitope-specific CD8 T cell response predictably dominates, VV infection of LCMV-immune mice elicits a more subtle and less predictable expansion of LCMV epitope-specific CD8 T cells (3, 4) . Here, we used sensitive measures to analyze these less predictable responses and have revealed new insights into the complexities of T cell dynamics during virus infections. Longitudinal analyses of LCMV-immune mice before and after VV infection revealed that, although many of the LCMVspecific memory cells were profoundly reduced in frequency, others, presumably cross-reactive T cells specific to distinct epitopes, were either maintained or increased in frequency (Fig. 1) . Attrition of noncross-reactive CD8 T cells after VV infection probably resulted from cytokine-induced bystander apoptosis of memory cells, shown to occur during viral infections (21) (22) (23) . Fig. 1 D shows that cells of all specificities decline at day 4 after infection and T cells specific to only some, presumably cross-reactive, peptides thereafter increase in number. Of note is that there was considerable variation between mice regarding what group of epitopespecific T cells was stimulated by VV. This mouse-to-mouse variation in epitope selectivity was also seen in measure-ments of the down-regulation of IL-7R\u2423, an indicator of recent TCR stimulation (Fig. 2 ) and in loss of CSFE label studies, an indicator of T cell proliferation (Fig. 3) .",

The T cell repertoire is generated via random rearrangements of separate V, (D), and J gene segments of TCR \u2423 and \u2424 chains, by imprecise joining and random addition of nucleotides during this process, and by the pairing of TCR \u2423 and \u2424 chains. The mathematically predicted potential T cell diversity (10 15 ) is far greater than the estimate of actual diversity (2 \u03eb 10 8 ) observed in mice, in part because of the limits on the total numbers of T cells (26, 27) . This gap between potential and actual diversity allows for different TCR repertoires in genetically identical hosts, and experiments have shown very little overlap of naive TCR repertoires between mice (14) . Upon immunization or infection, each host generates an antigen-specific T cell response with the best available T cell clones that randomly encounter epitope-expressing APCs. Even if each host appears to elicit comparable T cell responses with predictable immunodominance hierarchies and V\u2424 usage (public specificity), there lies considerable variation (private specificity) in clonal composition among the same epitope-specific T cells between individual mice (12) (13) (14) (15) .",

Because the NP205 response was frequently stimulated in VV-infected LCMV-immune mice, we analyzed the TCR repertoire of MHC-tetramer-sorted NP205specific T cells and, as expected, found considerable heterogeneity between mice. It might be anticipated that challenge with a cross-reactive heterologous virus might amplify only a subset of the T cells specific to a given epitope of a previously encountered virus, resulting in a less diverse T cell response. We have not clarified that in the LCMV plus VV system, where the cross-reactivity is unpredictable, but we have studied this in PV-immune mice challenged with LCMV, which invokes a strong cross-reactive NP205 response. Our analyses have shown greatly diminished receptor diversity of the responding T cells (unpublished data), suggesting that limited receptor TCR diversity may be an indicator of a cross-reactive response.",

It is not clear why certain epitope-specific CD8 T cells are more frequently cross-reactive than others, although here the NP205, GP118, and GP34-41 epitopes are K b restricted, whereas the weakly stimulating NP396 and GP276 epitopes are D b restricted. It is possible that VV encodes more K b -restricted peptides that are potentially crossreactive than D b -restricted ones. The VV-encoded A11R 198 epitope is an example of such a cross-reactive epitope, whose response differed greatly between one VV-challenged LCMV-immune mouse and another. Another possibility is that the three-dimensional structures of some peptides (such as GP34-41 and NP205) are better at selecting a wider variety of T cell clones than others and, therefore, these epitope-specific CD8 T cells could be more promiscuous in their interactions with other peptides.",

The replication of VV is reduced in LCMV-immune mice in comparison to naive mice, and T cell-dependent immunopathology is more dramatic. Adoptive transfer studies have shown that both the protective immunity and the immunopathology are dependent on T cells and on IFN-\u2425 production (1). It is noteworthy that IFN-\u2425 can be detected in vivo in different proportions of T cells of each tested LCMV epitope specificity (NP396, GP33, GP34, and NP205) by 3 d after infection, when viral titers are being controlled (3). It is not clear whether this IFN-\u2425 production is a consequence of T cell cross-reactivity or a nonspecific cytokine effect (28, 29) . As the infection progresses, T cells of distinct LCMV-epitope specificities expand. Given the pervasive nature of T cell cross-reactivity and the fact that it takes a stronger TCR signal to stimulate proliferation than IFN-\u2425 production (30) , all of these events could be determined by cross-reactivity, but this is in need of further study.",

We identified one VV-specific K b -restricted epitope from VV protein A11R 198-205 (AIVNYANL). Synthetic peptides listed here were purchased from American Peptide and were purified with reverse phase-HPLC to 90% purity. CDR3 length spectratyping analysis and sequencing. CDR3 length \"spectratype\" analysis was performed as described previously with modification (16, 40) . RNA samples were isolated from 5,000-60,000 MHC dimer-or MHC-tetramer-sorted epitope-specific CD8 T cells or from an NP205specific cell line derived from an LCMV-immune mouse. For NP396-404and GP33-41-specific cells, RNA samples were amplified with primers for C\u2424 and for V\u24248.1, using a GeneAmp RNA kit (PerkinElmer). The PCR products were subjected to five cycles of runoff reaction with six fluorophorelabeled J\u2424 primers (J\u2424 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5, and 2.1) . The runoff products were mixed with gel-loading buffer (five parts of 100% formamide and one part of 2.5% blue dextran/50 M EDTA), loaded onto a 4.75% acrylamide sequencing gel, and analyzed on an automated DNA sequencer using Gene-Scan software (Applied Biosystems). For NP205-specific T cells, TCR V\u2424 analysis was performed by a qualitative PCR with specific primers for V\u2424 1-18. The dominant V\u242416 PCR products were subcloned and sequenced across the CDR3 region according to the method of Naumov et al. (11) .",
