The Luminex bead microarray based Universal array platform delivers on these desirable characteristics for both genotyping and infectious disease based assays. The platform utilizes a validated array comprised of 100 spectrally distinct beads, each of which is coupled to a unique oligonucleotide primer sequence comprising the Luminex Universal array (Bortolin et al., 2004) . The use of this array for clinical genotyping has been well documented (Bortolin et al., 2004; Strom et al., 2005; Zhu et al., 2007) and most recently its utility for infectious disease testing has been exemplified (Mahony et al., 2007) . Generally genotyping assays require the amplification and interrogation of all alleles present in the test. Infectious disease testing on the other hand, as is the case for the Luminex xTAG TM RVP assay, generally detects the presence of one or more target sequences when present in a clinical sample.",

            "text": "The xTAG TM RVP assay provides clinicians with new tools with greater sensitivity and specificity and improved positive and negative predictive values in detecting respiratory viruses compared to current infectious disease diagnostic laboratory standards which rely upon culture and fluorescence techniques. By providing broader target coverage in the same assay, multiplexing methods obviate the diagnostic doubt that occurs when a symptomatic patient tests negative by less comprehensive methods. The Luminex Molecular Diagnostics (LMD) Respiratory Viral Panel (xTAG TM RVP) is a multiplexed nucleic acid assay covering almost all viruses and some subtypes associated with respiratory or influenza-like-illness. It is based on LMD's proprietary universal array platform and allows detection of 20 distinct respiratory viruses and subtypes for three of these viruses in a single reaction. The target analytes of the assay are shown in Table 1 . This is one of the first examples of how multiplexing technology can be applied to infectious disease diagnostics providing significantly improved clinical utility as well as potential savings in overall health costs. The etiology of respiratory infections has been attributed to a wide range of pathogens including viruses, bacteria and mycoplasmas (approximately 80% viral). Due to the similarity in presentation of respiratory illness, it is essentially impossible to identify a specific cause on the basis of symptoms alone. Since this information is essential for optimal patient treatment as well as resource management, e.g. identification of patients during outbreaks, multiplex tests such as xTAG TM RVP are likely to be increasingly adopted in the evolution of the diagnostic laboratory.",

A summary of this process is outlined in Fig. 1 . Viral nucleic acids are extracted from a nasopharyngeal sample and a multiplex RT-PCR reaction is carried out under optimized conditions in a single multiplex (16-plex) PCR resulting in amplicons for each of the viruses/subtypes present in the sample. The amplimer sizes range from 107 bp to 402 bp (Table 2) .

The MS2 phage, derived from a conserved region within the MS2 phage genome, is added to the sample and simultaneously extracted. MS2 was chosen as a suitable control because it most closely resembles viruses whose genomes are composed of RNA. The RNA based genome of MS2 serves as both a nucleic acid extraction control and as an internal control for all steps of the assay, particularly the reverse transcription/PCR. Specimens should be handled in an appropriate manner to maintain integral-infectious virus prior to the addition of the MS2. The lambda phage DNA specifically acts as a PCR external control since it is not subjected to extraction and is not reverse transcription dependent as is the MS2. In addition to the aforementioned controls it is recommended that a negative control be run with every batch of samples as well as external positive controls representing viruses probed by the xTAG TM RVP be included in routine laboratory control procedures in accordance with local regulations. The amplification products once generated are treated with Shrimp alkaline phosphatase (SAP) and Exonuclease 1 (Exo).

A portion of the extension products is then combined with the anti-tag-conjugated bead array to allow tag/anti-tag specific hybridization. The tag/anti-tag reaction is highly specific as they have been designed to be minimally cross-reacting among each other and to be maximally divergent from NCBI database sequences.

For the corona and RSV viruses, the targets are amplified with nonsubtype specific PCR primers. Subtyping occurs during the TSPE step through the use of appropriately discriminating subtype-specific target specific primers. Enterovirus and Rhinovirus are two separate targets that will generate signals on the same Luminex \u00ae microsphere population (single amplicon called Entero/Rhino). The discrimination of Parainfluenza subtypes occurs at both the PCR and TSPE step.",

While this method can be very sensitive, less labor intensive and relatively fast, it suffers from one critical setback. The multiplexing capability of this technology is limited by the number of fluors available (at most 6 dyes). This requires labs to run multiple assays on multiple instruments to obtain similar results to that obtained with RVP. In addition, data from the multiple runs have to be collated, compiled and analyzed in order to issue a clinical report.",

As can be seen, xTag RVP is comparable to real-time PCR. For samples with Ct values of 35 or less, xTAG TM RVP gave strong signals as well as high signal to noise ratios ( 50:1). Between Ct values of 36 and 40, xTAG TM RVP was able to detect most targets. Beyond Ct values of 40, in a few cases xTAG TM RVP gave low but clear signals above background. However the clinical relevance of such samples is unknown. ",
