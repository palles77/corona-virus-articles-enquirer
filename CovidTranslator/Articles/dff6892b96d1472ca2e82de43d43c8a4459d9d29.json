Creating models to identify individuals who are at the greatest risk for severe complications due to COVID-19 will be useful for outreach campaigns to help mitigate the disease's worst effects. While information specific to COVID-19 is limited, a model using complications due to other upper respiratory infections can be used as a proxy to help identify those individuals who are at the greatest risk. We present the results for three models predicting such complications, with each model increasing predictive effectiveness at the expense of ease of implementation.",

We start with these features as they give us an ability to quantify the portion of the at-risk population that are encapsulated by the high-level CDC recommendations.

As such, we allow full diagnosis histories to be leveraged within our simpler XGBoost model.

In particular, we visualize the performance of our model using a receiver operating characteristic graph, see Figure 1 . Additionally, the metrics quantifying the effectiveness of our models are presented in Table 3 . The performance of both gradient boosted tree models are very similar. The ROC curve demonstrates that as the decision threshold increases, the percentage of the potentially affected population increases at roughly the same rate.The logistic regression model has similar performance at low alert rates. We can see that at a 3% alert rate, the difference in sensitivity is only .02. The performance at higher alert rates experiences a significant performance disadvantage; however, for most interventions this would be at alert rates higher than is practical.",
