Clinical metritis was usually observed by day five postpartum and lasted for several weeks. There was only some vaginal outflow of a clear mucus with purulent flecks. Repeat-breeding was consistently observed. In some farms other signs, such as mastitis, peritonitis, nasal discharge, respiratory problems and sudden death of the neonates were observed. Studies of these cases suggested that BHV4 could also be the causal agent in peritonitis, infertility, respiratory problems and neonatal diarrhoeaoften in association with excretion of Cryptosporidium sp (Van Opdenbosch et al., 1983a; Wellemans et al., 1984) .",

Uterine lesions were not seen in experimentally induced metritis (Wellemans et al., 1986) . Nevertheless BHV4 was frequently isolated from the lochia of animals with metritis (fifteen isolations from twenty-six metritis cases). This is a very high rate if one takes into account that isolation of the virus is no easy matter due to its extreme lability and slow adaptation to cell cultures. We also observed that the sensitivity of the cell cultures varied from one week to another. The difficulty in isolation could explain the negative results from cows 19 and 32 at farm A and cow 12 at farm B, despite the clear seroconversion after metritis.

In cows 17, 30 and 32 at farm A, the antibody response was very rapid (one week), whereas in cow 12 on this farm the anti BHV4 antibodies only appeared after three months. A similar serological pattern was observed in another study (Wellemans et al., 1986) . The BHV4 antibodies in cow 21 on farm B remained at a low level and were not detectable even in the last blood sample. On the other hand, a clear seroconversion was noticed in cows 1, 10,ll and 30 on farm A and cow 12 on farm B without signs of clinical metritis. This could be due to the fact that viral multiplication is not always accompanied by clinical signs or that these signs were not evident enough to be detected by a clinical examination without intra-uterine sampling.",
