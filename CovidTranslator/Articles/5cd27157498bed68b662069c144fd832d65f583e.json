Rebound neutrophilia can occur following treatment of megaloblastic anaemia or after recovery from neutropenia induced by drugs.

Red cells can be lost from the body (e.g. gastrointestinal bleeding) or removed prematurely if they are abnormal or the spleen is enlarged (i.e. haemolysis). Kidney disease can result in decreased erythropoietin.

Cells in the marginal pool are not sampled when blood is taken for a full blood count. 1 Neutrophilia can therefore result from increased bone marrow synthesis and also from decreased margination which increases the circulating pool. There are many causes of neutrophilia (Box 65.1) but the commonest is bacterial infection in which there is increased bone marrow production of neutrophils and release of neutrophil precursors into the peripheral blood. This 'leukaemoid (0.5-1.0 \u00d7 10 9 /L) or mild (1.0-1.5 \u00d7 10 9 /L). The propensity to develop infections is related to the degree and duration of neutropenia, with higher risk associated with counts below 0.5 \u00d7 10 9 /L. Africans, African Americans, Yemenite Jews, Palestinians and Saudi Arabians generally have slightly lower neutrophil counts compared with other races. This is thought to be due to an increase in the bone marrow storage pool as ethnic neutropenia is associated with good neutrophil responses to infections. Neutropenia can be due to impaired or ineffective (intramedullary death of neutrophil precursors despite normal bone marrow production) synthesis by the bone marrow (e.g. myelodysplasia, megaloblastic anaemia, treatment with phenytoin or methotrexate); a shift from the circulating pool to marginated pool (pseudoneutropenia) and increased peripheral destruction (e.g. secondary to antibodies against the neutrophils or increased reticulo-endothelial activity in sepsis or haemophagocytic syndrome) (Box 65.2). Increased consumption of neutrophils can result from increased attachment of cells to endothelium or other leukocytes in inflammatory states. Neutropenia is often the result of a combination of several of these mechanisms.",

Moderate to severe neutropenia can also occur in newborn infants as a result of the transfer of maternal IgG anti-neutrophil antibodies in a manner similar to rhesus haemolytic disease of the newborn. 4 Although neutropenia has been described with typhoid fever, minimum neutrophil count seldom falls below 0.6 \u00d7 10 9 /L and the BOX neutropenia may not develop until after the first week of illness. Infectious hepatitis and yellow fever can both cause neutropenia. Overwhelming infections can lead to a failure of bone marrow production of neutrophils, especially in undernourished individuals and alcoholics. Individuals with severe neutropenia can develop lifethreatening septicaemia, often from endogenous flora (e.g. oral cavity), and stringent measures should be taken to avoid situations which may predispose these individuals to infections. They may need prophylactic antimicrobials and should have rapid access to medical care. Fungal infections are less common than bacterial infections in neutropenic individuals, and viral or parasitic infections rarely occur with isolated neutropenia. Granulocyte colony stimulating factor (GCSF) injections can be helpful in raising the neutrophil count in patients with complicating infections since it stimulates the release of neutrophils from the marrow, but GCSF is only useful if there is some bone marrow reserve. Patients with some congenital or immune forms of neutropenia can tolerate persistently low counts without any increase in the incidence of infections.",

Their number in the circulation is relatively small compared to other leukocytes because they predominantly reside in tissues such as the gut, skin and lungs which are entry points for allergens and infections. The commonest causes of eosinophilia are helminthic infections, atopy and allergic diseases, and adverse drug reactions. Less common causes are classified under the umbrella term of hypereosinophilic syndromes (Table 65 .1). Since parasitic infections are likely to be the commonest cause of eosinophilia in the tropics and in returning travellers, an extensive search for such infections should be undertaken in patients with persistent eosinophilia; initial investigations should be determined by the patient's history of geographical exposure (Figure 65.4) . [5] [6] [7] The absolute number of eosinophils in the peripheral blood may not correlate with their tissue distribution or with their potential to cause tissue damage from their granule release. This is because the degree of eosinophilia depends on the extent of tissue invasion and is therefore modest with tapeworms and roundworms resident in the bowel but much higher where invasion occurs, for example with, Toxocara canis or filaria. Schistosomiasis almost always causes eosinophilia. Strongyloides stercoralis has the capacity to remain in the host for decades after initial infection and causes varying degrees of eosinophilia, with or without other symptoms. Steroid treatment, which may be necessary in cases of eosinophilic tissue damage, can exacerbate clinical problems in patients with Strongyloides infection so this parasitic infestation should be excluded before starting steroids for hypereosinophilia.",

The biochemical evidence for iron deficiency occurs in several steps. 26 Initially, iron stores in the bone marrow are depleted as reflected by a decreased serum ferritin. The total iron-binding capacity then starts to rise, while the serum iron saturation begins to fall before microcytosis and a drop in haemoglobin ensue.

Heavy tea intake can interfere with iron absorption and should be avoided. Multivitamin or dietary supplements containing calcium, zinc or copper can also interfere with iron absorption.

Although some microorganisms can synthesize cobalamin, humans need to obtain this essential vitamin from foods, mainly meat, poultry and dairy products. Vitamin B 12 is an essential co-factor in DNA synthesis, serving as a co-factor in two key biochemical processes involving methylmalonic acid and homocysteine as precursors. Consequently vitamin B 12 deficiency can interfere with DNA synthesis. Clinical manifestations include haematological (megaloblastic anaemia and pancytopenia), and neuropsychiatric disorders (paraesthesia, peripheral neuropathy, psychosis and dementia) and an increased risk of cardiovascular disease because of hyperhomocystinaemia. [32] [33] [34] A systematic approach to the investigation of vitamin B 12 deficiency requires an understanding of the absorption cycle. 35 Ingested vitamin B 12 is broken down in the acidic environment of the stomach. It binds to R-binders in gastric secretions and saliva which stabilize the vitamin B 12 . In the alkaline environment of the small intestine, vitamin B 12 is released from R-binders to bind to intrinsic factor, synthesized in the gastric parietal cells. This vitamin B 12 -intrinsic factor complex is absorbed from the terminal ileum. Recently, an alternative absorption system independent of intrinsic factor and the terminal ileum has been postulated which provides a rationale for Mean cell volume Useful as a diagnostic clue but not confirmatory Can also be low in thalassaemia, sideroblastic anaemia and rarely lead poisoning Can be falsely normal in the presence of iron deficiency in older people or with coexistent megaloblastic anaemia Anaemia of chronic disease can occasionally cause microcytosis Serum ferritin",

A note of caution is that folic acid deficiency can cause falsely low serum vitamin B 12 levels. Diagnostic clues for vitamin B 12 deficiency include marked macrocytosis (often >130 fl), neutrophil nuclear hypersegmentation and oval macrocytes in the peripheral blood film. Blood tests may demonstrate increased lactate dehydrogenase and low haptoglobin levels due to haemolysis within the bone marrow. The cause of the macrocytosis can be confirmed by bone marrow examination which reveals a megaloblastic picture. Although macrocytic anaemia is a typical feature of vitamin B 12 deficiency, it can be absent in older individuals who may only have neuropsychiatric features. Measurements of methylmalonic acid and homocysteine levels, two markers which are very sensitive for detecting B 12 deficiency, have shown that vitamin B 12 deficiency can occur with normal haemoglobin levels and without macrocytosis. 36 Pernicious anaemia is probably the commonest cause of vitamin B 12 deficiency. The presence of parietal cell or intrinsic factor antibodies supports a diagnosis of pernicious anaemia. [33] [34] [35] [36] Schilling tests are rarely performed because of the unavailability of the radio-labelled vitamin B 12 and the difficulty in interpreting the results in the presence of renal insufficiency.

            "text": "The neglected tropical diseases are a group of infections which are endemic in developing countries. Several of these neglected tropical diseases cause anaemia and many can be managed using inexpensive interventions to treat the underlying parasitic infections. 14 The mechanisms of anaemia in these conditions are predominantly blood loss from the gastrointestinal or genitourinary tracts but also poor nutrition, bone marrow suppression, inflammation, hypersplenism and haemolysis. 58 Anaemia is a common consequence of infections with soiltransmitted helminths or schistosoma with a strong correlation between haemoglobin level and worm load or faecal egg count. Even mild infections can lead to anaemia. 59 Polyparasitism (i.e. infection with several parasites simultaneously) can be responsible for unresponsiveness of the anaemia to eradication of one organism. 60 Treatment of communities at high risk of soiltransmitted helminths improves growth and iron stores in children and reduces anaemia in pregnant women. 61 The treatment of anaemia due to neglected tropical diseases depends on eradication of the parasite with drugs such as albendazole and praziquantel though anaemia resolution may be less successful if it is due to trichuriasis. 62-64 The addition of iron to anthelmintic treatment has met with variable success rates probably because there is associated anaemia related to inflammation. However it is still generally recommended that iron supplementation should be included with anthelmintic therapy in treatment programmes for neglected tropical diseases. [65] [66] [67] INTRODUCTION Haemoglobin S (HbS) has a prevalence of 25-30% in many parts of Africa and also some areas in the Middle East ( Figure  65 .6). HbS tends to be common among ethnic groups that have traditionally had high exposure to Plasmodium falciparum malaria. In sub-Saharan Africa approximately 230 000 infants are born with sickle cell disease each year, mostly with HbSS. Sickle cell disease (SCD) is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by production of an abnormal haemoglobin, sickle haemoglobin. Sickle haemoglobin (HbS) arises from a mutation in codon 6 of the \u03b2-globin gene resulting in replacement of the normal glutamic acid residue by a valine. 68 SCD is most commonly caused by the co-inheritance of two sickle cell genes (homozygous Hb SS disease) but patients who are heterozygous for HbS and for another haemoglobin mutation such as HbC (haemoglobin SC disease) or \u03b2-thalassaemia (S\u03b2 0 and S\u03b2 + ) can also present with features of SCD. 69 SS disease and S\u03b2 0 disease are more severe than SC disease and S\u03b2 + disease (Box 65.6). 70 SCD can affect multiple organs and its clinical course is punctuated by episodes of acute illness on a background of progressive organ damage, especially of the central nervous system and the lungs. 70 ",

These crises are the result of vaso-occlusion of the bone marrow causing bone infarction and release of mediators that activate pain receptors. 82 The number, severity and frequency of painful episodes vary widely in individuals. Half may never have any episodes whereas about 3% may need hospital admission up to 6 times a year. 89 More than three pain episodes requiring hospitalization per year is associated with increased mortality among patients over 20 years old. In under-resourced settings, hospital visits underestimate the frequency of pain BOX manifestations such as fever, cough, sputum production, tachypnoea, dyspnoea or new-onset hypoxia. 94 ACS is the most common cause of death in SCD patients and a frequent cause of hospitalization, second only to painful crisis. Mortality in patients with ACS in a wealthy country setting is 1% in children and 4.3% in adults. 95 The peak incidence for ACS is 2-4 years of age and gradually declines to 8.8 per 100 patient-years in subjects older than 20 years. 96, 97 Fever and cough are more common in children with ACS and chest pain and dyspnoea are more common in adults. 96 ACS is often preceded by febrile pulmonary infection in children and by vaso-occlusive pain crisis and lung infarction in adults. It is important to note that although tachypnoea, wheezing and features of chest infection may be identified, a third of the patients may have a normal physical examination. More than one-third of patients with ACS are hypoxaemic (oxygen saturation <90%). 98 Chest radiography is essential although infiltrates may lag behind clinical symptoms by up to 3 days. Repeat chest X-rays are recommended if there is a strong clinical suspicion of ACS. Bilateral infiltrates or involvement of multiple lobes may predict a poorer prognosis.",

High serum phospholipase A2, and the surrogate marker C-reactive protein, have been noted in patients admitted with vaso-occlusive crisis 24-48 hours before the development of ACS. 100, 101 Stroke Neurological complications occur in at least 25% of patients with SCD and SCD is one of the most common causes of stroke in children. 102, 103 In SCD, the risk of having a first stroke is 11% by the age of 20, 15% by age 30 years and 24% by age 45 years. Both thrombotic and haemorrhagic strokes occur, although the former is more common in children and those over 30 years of age, whereas the latter is more common between the ages of 20 and 30 years. 108 This age-specific pattern may be related to the higher cerebral flow rates in early childhood. Although the prevalence of clinically overt stroke is of the order of 11%, clinically silent infarction, detectable by magnetic resonance scans, affect nearly double this number by the age of 20. Silent infarcts are associated with cognitive impairment and the majority of these children require lifelong specialist care. 104 Cerebral thrombosis, which accounts for 70-80% of all strokes in SCD, results from large-vessel occlusion whereas silent infarcts are the result of microvascular occlusion or thrombosis or hypoxia secondary to large-vessel disease. In a third of SCD patients, major-vessel stenosis is accompanied by collateral vessels that appear as 'puffs of smoke' (moyamoya) on angiography. Risk factors for ischaemic strokes in SCD include increased cerebral blood flow velocity, previous silent infarcts, nocturnal hypoxaemia, severe anaemia, acute chest syndrome and elevated systolic blood pressure. An elevated leukocyte count is a risk factor for haemorrhagic stroke. [105] [106] [107] [108] DIAGNOSIS Often the family history and clinical findings clearly point towards a diagnosis of SCD and during an acute crisis, abundant sickled red cells can be seen on a blood film. White cell counts are higher than normal in SCD disease, particularly in patients under age 10 years. The presence of sickle haemoglobin in different sickle syndromes (e.g. HbAS, HbSS, HbSC) ( Table  65 .5) can be confirmed by a simple sickle slide or solubility test. Haemoglobin electrophoresis will distinguish between many of these variants but high-performance liquid chromatography and iso-electric focusing are preferred for a definitive diagnosis. ",

Antenatal screening is available to women in some countries to help to identify couples who are at risk of having a baby with SCD. Community acceptance of reproductive genetic services however depends on the effectiveness of education and counselling. The use of prophylactic penicillin and the provision of comprehensive medical care during the first 5 years of life have reduced mortality related to SCD from 25% to less than 3%. 109 MANAGEMENT (Box 65.10) Individuals with SCD are best managed by a multidisciplinary team as they may require a variety of specialist inputs including haematology, ophthalmology, nephrology, obstetrics, orthopaedics and physiotherapy. The cornerstones of SCD therapy are disease modification and prompt and effective management of crises. Severe pain crises generally require intravenous fluids and adequate, often opiate, analgesia (Box 65.11), while disease modification is based on interventions to increase HbF levels.

Clinical manifestations of thalassaemia major depend on whether adequate blood transfusions are available and the stringency with which iron chelation is undertaken.

Anaemia from defective erythropoeisis, decreased red cell survival and increased haemolysis in thalassaemia major leads to cardiac decompensation, failure to thrive and growth retardation in children. Splenomegaly, from the increased work load of culling red cells with inclusion bodies, can cause dilutional anaemia and a further drop in haemoglobin. Compensatory extra-medullary haematopoiesis can lead to hepatomegaly and occasionally vertebral compression and neurological defects. Haemolysis from increased red cell destruction is associated with gall stones in up to 20% of individuals with \u03b2-thalassaemia. 140 Another consequence of accelerated haemolysis is the increased incidence of thromboembolism (4% in thalassaemia major and 10% with intermedia) from the exposure of negatively charged phospholipids on the red cell membrane and the generation of red cell and platelet microparticles. 141 Splenectomy with postoperative thrombocytosis is a risk factor for thrombosis especially if combined with endothelial oxidative stress from iron overload, or procoagulant co-morbid conditions such as diabetes mellitus, hormone therapy, thrombophilic mutations and atrial fibrillation. 142 Folate deficiency, hyperuricaemia and occasionally gout have been observed in thalassaemia major due to the high turnover of red cells.",

An infant with Hb Bart's hydrops fetalis syndrome has pallor and gross oedema with signs of cardiac failure, marked hepatosplenomegaly and skeletal and cardiovascular deformities. There is often gross hypertrophy of the placenta. Many of the clinical manifestations of this condition can be explained by the characteristic bossing of the skull and overgrowth of maxillary region, radiologically noted as 'hair on end' or 'sun-ray' appearance. Metatarsal and metacarpal bones are the first to expand so measurement of the metacarpal bones has been considered a good indicator for initiation of transfusion therapy. 143 Other skeletal deformities include shortening of long bones due to early epiphyseal fusion and overgrowth of the maxilla causing dental malocclusion. The marrow expansion can also lead to pathological fractures, early bone thinning and osteoporosis 144, 145 while ineffective drainage of the sinuses and middle ear from skull bone overgrowth can cause chronic sinus and ear infections. Growth retardation is primarily the result of anaemia with contributions from iron overload, hypersplenism, deficiencies of thyroid and growth hormone, hypogonadism, zinc deficiency, chronic liver disease, malnutrition and psychosocial stress. 146 Patients with \u03b2-thalassaemia have increased iron absorption mediated by reduced hepcidin and those who receive regular transfusions may also develop transfusion siderosis if they are inadequately chelated.

Ineffective erythropoiesis with resultant chronic anaemia and hypoxia can suppress hepcidin, the regulator of iron metabolism, leading to increased iron absorption. 158 The excess iron tends to accumulate in the liver rather than the heart. 159 Other clinical complications in thalassaemia intermedia include gallstones, extramedullary haemopoiesis leg ulcers, thromboembolic events and pulmonary hypertension, which is the major cause of heart failure in these individuals. 160 Although individuals with thalassaemia intermedia do not usually need regular blood transfusions, there is some evidence that complications, particularly later in life, may be less common in regularly transfused patients. 159 \u03b1-Thalassaemias 130, 134 Carriers of \u03b1-thalassaemia (traits, with loss of 1 or 2 \u03b1 genes) are usually asymptomatic and may only be detected through a routine blood count which shows mild to moderate microcytic, hypochromic anaemia.

Rarely, silent \u03b2-thalassaemia mutation may present with an MCV over 27 pg and should be considered in those with a positive family history. At-risk couples should be referred for detailed counselling on the options for prenatal diagnosis. These include chorionic villous sampling or amniocentesis, which are used to obtain fetal DNA samples for genetic analysis. Polymerase chain reactions and precise hybridization assays to detect single point mutations using very small DNA samples have also been developed. A less invasive and less risky option is to isolate fetal DNA circulating in the maternal blood for genetic analysis. Pre-implantation genetic diagnosis is a newer technique where DNA from the blastomere is used for genetic diagnosis. Ultrasound can be used from the 2nd trimester for fetuses suspected of having \u03b1-thalassaemia to detect signs of hydrops fetalis and enlarged placenta (Figure 65.9) . 175 ",

Definitive diagnosis of G6PD deficiency is by quantitative spectrophotometric analysis of the rate of NADPH production. Point of care tests for G6PD deficiency are being developed but have not yet been validated for routine use. Measuring enzyme activity during an episode of acute haemolysis is not helpful since reticulocytosis, which is a feature of acute haemolysis, produces a false-negative result because of the high enzyme levels in younger erythrocytes. 179, 186 MANAGEMENT The most effective management strategy for G6PD deficiency is to prevent haemolysis by avoiding triggering agents like infections, drugs and fava beans. For the milder variants (e.g. Class III and IV), drugs known to trigger haemolysis may be given to individuals with G6PD deficiency if the benefits outweigh the risks and the blood count is closely monitored (e.g. use of low-dose primaquine for individuals with G6PD Avariant).

            "text": "Haemolysis is more common in non-immune individuals with acute malaria, whereas dyserythropoiesis is the predominant mechanism for anaemia in recurrent falciparum malaria. 207, 194 Haemolysis is the result of red cell phagocytosis by the reticuloendothelial system and is triggered by damage to the red cell membranes and exposure of abnormal surface antigens on their surface. [195] [196] [197] [198] Ten uninfected red cells are removed from the circulation for each infected red cell destroyed, 199 possibly related to loss of red cell complement regulatory proteins and increased levels of circulating immune complexes. 200 This may partly explain the persistent or worsening anaemia following parasite clearance and the poor correlation between parasitaemia and the severity of anaemia noted in some studies. 207 An increased incidence of anaemia has been noted in malaria vaccine trials possibly due to enhanced clearance of uninfected red blood cells. 201 Decreased erythropoeisis with abnormalities in red cell precursors and reticulocytopenia is found consistently on examination of bone marrow from malaria-infected patients. 202 The decreased erythropoiesis is due to many factors including low levels of TNF-\u03b1, high levels of interleukin-10, abnormalities of erythropoietin, a decrease in burst colony forming units, cytokine-induced suppression of red cell production and the inhibitory effect of the malarial pigment haemozoin. [203] [204] [205] [206] Epidemiology Malaria-related anaemia is most commonly seen in children and pregnant women. The prevalence of malarial anaemia in sub-Saharan Africa in children is 30-90% and in pregnant women it is 60-80%. 207 The highest prevalence is in infants and children less than 3 years of age. Infants may acquire malaria through the placenta. 208, 209 Individuals living in malarious areas may have multiple reasons for anaemia such as bacteraemia, hookworm infections and vitamin A deficiency 208 making it difficult to assign anaemia solely to malaria. However, animal studies and the fact that anaemia improves with anti-malarial treatment suggest a direct relationship between malaria infection and anaemia. 210, 211 For example, in Tanzanian children about 60% of anaemic episodes were thought to be caused by malaria. 212 WHO defines severe anaemia attributable to malaria as: (i) haemoglobin concentration <50 g/L or haematocrit <15%; (ii) parasitaemia with >10 000 parasites/\u00b5L of blood and (iii) normocytic blood film (to exclude other common causes of anaemia). 213 However, aspects of this definition have been criticized because blood films are not examined routinely and parasite density varies with endemicity and age. 207 Although traditionally it is P. falciparum that has been associated with the most severe malaria-related anaemia, P. vivax is also a major risk factor for severe anaemia especially in young children or those with chronic and recurrent infections. P. vivax anaemia is associated with recurrent bouts of haemolysis of predominantly uninfected erythrocytes with increased fragility. 214 ",

Parasitized red cells induce expression of tissue factor on endothelial cells and monocytes, release of microparticles, cytokine release and platelet clumping, all of which initiate blood coagulation and tilt the balance towards the pro-coagulant state ( Figure  65.12) . 234, [237] [238] [239] [240] [241] [242] Anticoagulant factors are severely depleted in malaria. Protein C and antithrombin levels are inversely correlated with severity of falciparum malaria and return to normal with treatment of the malaria. 245 have been some concerns about a possible increased risk of infection associated with iron supplementation for children in malarious areas 218, 219 but current recommendations advocate that where iron deficiency and malaria are common, iron supplements should not be withheld and appropriate anti-malarial treatment or prevention should also be offered. 220 The best way to prevent malarial anaemia is to prevent malaria infection by avoiding mosquito bites (e.g. through the use of bed nets) or through chemoprophylaxis. Malaria chemoprophylaxis during infancy can reduce both malaria and anaemia. 221 Children who have been hospitalized with severe malarial anaemia may benefit from intermittent preventive malarial therapy after discharge to prevent recurrence of anaemia. 222 Daily co-trimoxazole prophylaxis which is used for HIV-infected individuals has been shown to reduce malaria parasitaemia and anaemia. 223 ",

Erythropoietin is particularly useful in individuals whose erythropoietin levels are less than 500 IU/L 255 because in addition to increasing the haemoglobin it can also improve the quality of life. 256 Erythropoietin may take several weeks to achieve full effect and patients should be replete in haematinics.

            "text": "Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) was noted to be associated with HIV infection early in the epidemic and is an AIDSdefining illness. 270 The incidence of NHL is up to 200 times greater in HIV-infected adults than in those who are not infected, and it is responsible for nearly one-sixth of the deaths attributable to AIDS. Since the introduction of HAART, the incidence of all types of NHL has decreased by approximately 30-50% 271, 272 and the outcome of HIV-infected patients with lymphoma has improved. In the setting of clinical trials, the 60% 1-year survival rate is comparable to those without HIV infection. 273 The incidence of Hodgkin's lymphoma has increased in the post-HAART era, possibly due to immune reconstitution and increased CD4 cells. 274, 275 Evidence of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection can be found in virtually all cases of Hodgkin's disease. 276 HIV-related lymphomas (Box 65.18) 277 (see also Lymphomas, below), are broadly divided into systemic lymphomas (80%) and primary central nervous system lymphomas. 278 The incidence of highly aggressive lymphomas, either Burkitt's lymphoma (approx. 25%) or diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (approx. 75%), is much higher in HIV-infected patients than in those without infection. 279 Although T-cell lymphomas are uncommon in HIV disease (1%), there has been an increase in recent years. The incidence of primary central nervous system lymphoma in HIV-affected individuals is 2-6% and it is 1000 times more common than in the general population. 280 The pathogenesis of NHL in HIV infection is related to the inadequate host immune responses to viruses with oncogenic potential, predominantly EBV and human herpesvirus 8 (HHV8)/Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus. This allows unregulated lymphoid growth and an accumulation of genetic abnormalities in B cells. 272 Markers of B-cell activation such as serum immunoglobulins and free light chains, and CD4 cell count have been suggested as predictive markers for the development of NHL in HIV infection. 281, 282 Extranodal and leptomeningeal involvement, and B-symptoms occur in the majority of HIV-infected patients with NHL and the bone marrow is commonly involved. The most common extranodal site to be involved is the incidence of moderate thrombocytopenia (<50 \u00d7 10 9 /L) is 3.7%, though this is higher in those with clinical AIDS (8.7%). 257, 258 Thrombocytopenia is more common in those who abuse drugs, have opportunistic infections and malignant disorders of the bone marrow (e.g. lymphoma), and it may also be a side-effect of therapeutic drugs. 259 The most common cause of thrombocytopenia in HIV infection is immune thrombocytopenia which may be associated with hepatitis C co-infection, and produces decreased platelet survival, particularly at CD4 counts below 200/\u00b5L. The anti-platelet antibodies, immune complexes and cross-reacting antibodies to HIV envelope proteins and platelets, which occur in HIV-associated thrombocytopenia 259, 260 may also contribute to generation of reactive oxygen species. 261 Platelet production can also be affected in HIV infection and may explain the high levels of thrombopoietin that have been documented in HIVrelated thrombocytopenia. 262 Some cases of HIV-related thrombocytopenia may undergo spontaneous remission so treatment of thrombocytopenia is usually only initiated if it is associated with bleeding, which is unusual. 259 The first line of treatment involves antiretroviral therapy with the aim of achieving undetectable plasma HIV viraemia. 263, 264 Any drugs that may be associated with causing thrombocytopenia should be withdrawn and opportunistic infections or secondary malignancies treated. The treatment of immune thrombocytopenia is the same as in non-HIV cases and options include a short course of steroids, intravenous immunoglobulin (short-lived response), anti-D, interferon-\u03b1 or splenectomy.",

            "text": "Although there are multiple causes of thrombocytopenia in HIV-positive individuals, one of the most devastating is the thrombotic microangiopathy of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP). This is because the combination of haemolytic anaemia and microthrombi has a very poor prognosis. Symptoms are nonspecific and may include fever, headache, bleeding and changes in consciousness. If TTP is suspected, an urgent blood film should be requested and the combination of thrombocytopenia with red cell fragmentation is highly suggestive of TTP. TTP associated with HIV infection was more frequent before the introduction of ART and is more common if adherence to treatment is poor or resistance to therapy has developed. 265 TTP is thought to be due to endothelial damage, but unlike the situation in non-HIV-infected individuals, low levels of ADAMTS-13 are not a useful predictor of outcome. 266 Treatment of TTP involves plasma exchange, and although refractoriness may occur, this can be corrected by ART in some cases. 266 If ART is administered in these cases it is important to maintain adherence throughout the period of plasma exchange. If apheresis facilities are limited, plasma infusions alone (30 mL/ kg per day) may also produce a response. 267 ART should also be administered immediately after plasma exchange to minimize drug removal. Patients with a viral load of less than 500 000 copies/mL generally require fewer plasma exchanges for remission than those with a higher load. 265 Survival of patients with HIV-associated TTP in the pre-ART era was rarely longer than 2 years, even with plasma exchange and steroid treatment, but for patients who are compliant with ART the mortality is around 4%. 268 which immediately limits the amount of blood loss. Exposure of the subendothelial space releases factors such as von Willebrand factor multimers which bind to platelets and initiate platelet adhesion to the endothelium. The adherent platelets release their granules and attract more platelets, which in combination with fibrinogen, form an aggregate. The activated platelets also attract coagulation factors thereby promoting the clotting process. The critical parts of clot formation are the conversion of prothrombin to thrombin and the thrombinfacilitated conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin (Figure 65.13) . Haemostatic control mechanisms operate throughout the clotting process to prevent excessive clot formation and involve proteins C and S, and anti-thrombin and antifibrinolytic systems. Any alteration in these regulatory pathways can lead to either bleeding or thrombotic complications.",

The initial laboratory tests in a patient with excessive bleeding should therefore include a platelet count, clotting screen (prothrombin time (PT) and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT)), and gastrointestinal tract, often the stomach or the perianal region. 283 Hepatic involvement, seen in a quarter of cases, is associated with a particularly poor prognosis. CNS disease may be asymptomatic so diagnostic lumbar puncture may be required. 284 HIV-related lymphomas frequently present with poor prognostic features such as elevated serum lactate dehydrogenase levels. 285, 286 Older age, lowest nadir CD4 cell counts prior to NHL diagnosis, developing NHL while on ART, and cumulative HIV viraemia are also poor prognostic features. 282 A formal prognostic scoring system has been developed which takes into account the CD4 count (<100 cells/\u00b5L). 287 Some types of HIV-related lymphoma are associated with characteristic clinical and laboratory features. Primary effusion lymphoma is an aggressive lymphoma characterized by effusions in serosal cavities in the absence of any other tumour masses. 288, 289 It is strongly associated with HHV8 infection and the virus can be identified in the nuclei of the malignant cells. Plasmablastic lymphoma mainly affects the oral cavity and the mucosa of the jaw and is typically associated with Epstein-Barr virus. 290 Histological examination of biopsied tissue is necessary to confirm the diagnosis and type of lymphoma. Diagnostic difficulties may arise because HIV-related hyperplasia in lymph node biopsies may be confused with lymphoma, the histological appearance of HIV-related lymphomas may be different from those of non-infected individuals 291 and many opportunistic pathogens may mimic the appearances of NHL, or co-exist with it, and will need to be identified or excluded before making a diagnosis of lymphoma.",

The PT and aPTT are not necessarily good predictors of the bleeding risk because some clotting disorders associated with thrombosis (e.g. anti-phospholipid antibodies) can prolong the aPTT. A shortened aPTT can be associated with marked elevation of factor VIII levels (e.g. pregnancy) and may be a predictor of deep vein thrombosis.

Asian populations 306-308 seem to have a lower prevalence of symptomatic venous thrombosis compared to African Americans. 304 Very little is known about the prevalence of prothrombotic factors such as mutations of the prothrombin gene or deficiencies of antithrombin, protein C and protein S in tropical countries, although high rates of factor V Leiden, a risk factor for venous thrombosis, have been described in Tunisia. 309, 310 Lupus anticoagulant and anti-phospholipid syndrome, which are associated with increased thrombosis risk, are increased in Afro-Caribbean populations, especially in the presence of HIV, and have also been described in Nigerian women with pre-eclampsia. 311, 312 The management of venous thrombosis is initially with heparin and then with warfarin for 3-6 months. Compliance may be difficult in low-resource settings because of the requirement for regular monitoring of warfarin. It is therefore important to try to prevent thromboses by removing any underlying risk factors and by treating individuals at risk of thrombosis with a short course of prophylactic heparin to cover procedures known to be associated with thrombosis risk.",

More studies on the efficacy and cost of combinations of interventions including insecticide-treated bed nets, nutritional supplements and anthelmintic drugs to prevent anaemia are needed. When resources are very limited, governments may need to make some difficult decisions in order to achieve an equitable balance between investing in a transfusion service and public health measures to reduce anaemia. Whether a patient needs a blood transfusion or not is ultimately a clinical decision. Emergency transfusions can be lifesaving for patients in whom anaemia has developed too quickly to allow physiological compensation, as in severe malariarelated anaemia in children, and sudden, severe obstetric bleeding. In contrast, if the anaemia has developed slowly, for example due to hookworm infestation or nutritional deficiency, patients can generally be managed conservatively by treating the cause of the anaemia and prescribing haematinic replacements. Iron supplements should be continued for at least 3 months after the haemoglobin has returned to normal, so that body stores can be replenished. Clinical Guidelines. It is possible to avoid unnecessary transfusions by adhering to clinical transfusion guidelines. Most institutions have developed guidelines to help clinicians make rational decisions about the use of blood transfusions (Box 65.23) 344, 350 and strict enforcement of transfusion protocols can significantly reduce avoidable transfusions. 351 The principles underlying most transfusion guidelines are similar and combine a clinical assessment of oxygenation, with haemoglobin measurement being used as a surrogate measure for intracellular oxygen concentration. Increasingly, transfusion guidelines are making use of evidence which shows that adequate oxygen delivery to the tissues can be achieved at haemoglobin levels that are significantly lower than the normal range. 352 Implementation of transfusion guidelines is particularly difficult if clinicians do not have access to reliable haemoglobin High-risk donors, such as commercial sex workers and their contacts, intravenous drug abusers, or those with an itinerant lifestyle such as traders, drivers and military personnel, should be deterred from donating. 338 Even in areas where HIV infection rates in the general population are high, donor deferral can be effective in excluding HIV-infected donors. 339 The whole donation process, including tests for HIV and other infections, should be explained to the donor before blood is collected and donors should have the option of knowing the results and receiving counselling. It is imperative that complete confidentiality is maintained throughout all procedures.",
