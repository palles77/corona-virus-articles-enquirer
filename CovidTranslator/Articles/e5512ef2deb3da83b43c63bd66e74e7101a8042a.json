A provincial analysis of its urbanisation trends shows shifting and accelerating rural-to-urban migration across the country and accompanying rapid increases in city size and population. The growing disease burden in urban areas attributable to nutrition and lifestyle choices is a major public health challenge, as are troubling disparities in health-care access, vaccination coverage, and accidents and injuries in China's rural-to-urban migrant population. Urban environmental quality, including air and water pollution, contributes to disease both in urban and in rural areas, and traffi c-related accidents pose a major public health threat as the country becomes increasingly motorised. To address the health challenges and maximise the benefi ts that accompany this rapid urbanisation, innovative health policies focused on the needs of migrants and research that could close knowledge gaps on urban population exposures are needed.",

Health benefi ts will probably continue to accrue to urban populations, who have better access to health services and education and higher incomes than do their rural counterparts. However, urbanisation will continue to increase population exposure to major risk factors for disease, especially those that relate to the challenging environmental and social conditions (eg, environmental pollution and physical inactivity) that dominate China's large cities. As the country urbanises, the degree of transition to westernstyle diets and sedentary lifestyles, the trend in outdoor air pollution, and progress in prevention of accidents are important factors that will aff ect the future health of China's population.",

The speed and scale of China's urban growth has been driven by many important factors such as economic reforms in the late 1970s, within-country migration policies, increasing urban-rural income disparities, surplus agricultural labourers, and conversion of farmland for urban use. 9 The drivers of migration are often described as push or pull factors (panel) on the basis of theoretical work. 10 This framework has been used to examine the determinants of rural-to-urban migration in China, 11 and several especially important factors have been identifi ed-eg, surplus rural labour force (push factor), environmental stress (push factor), and peer relations (pull factor). High quality health care as a pull factor driving migration to urban areas has not been addressed, but is unlikely to be a strong driver in view of the challenges that rural migrants have faced over the past two decades with access to health insurance and aff ordable care in urban areas.",

An important economic eff ect of migration is to provide a large labour pool for productive activities in urban areas (appendix). Despite the speed and scale of Chinese urbanisation, the process has been distinguished by the absence of widespread proliferation of urban slums seen commonly in expanding urban areas in other developing country settings. This success is partly due to China's governmental commitment to the expansion of housing and basic infrastructure in urban areas. 13 Since the 1950s, the government has invested heavily in the construction of housing for urban workers, a practice that has been adopted by private enterprises including large factories and construction companies that draw migrant popu lations. 14, 15 Additionally, as urban boundaries expand, rural villages are subsumed and their rural-turned-urban populations often turn to renting property as an alter native source of income, providing additional housing options for migrant populations. 16 Although these activities have restricted the growth of large-scale urban and periurban slums, substandard housing is a major issue, particularly for rural-to-urban migrants without urban hukou, many of whom live in crowded, substandard conditions.",

First, the urban environment itself poses chemical, biological, and physical hazards, which can lead to injury and illness in urban residents. Second, urbanisation triggers changes in occupational activities, socioeconomic status, and social structures that can promote illnesses such as neuropsychiatric disorders, cardiovascular disease, and other non-communicable chronic diseases in both urban and rural populations. Third, the massive rural-to-urban migration that accompanies urbanisation has created particular challenges for health-care delivery in highly mobile and often undocumented populations in China.

            "text": "Urbanisation has long been a major force driving health-care policy in China. Concern about the health of rural-to-urban migrants in the early stages of the country's mass urbanisation was restricted to perceived threats posed by migrants, such as the possibility that this so-called fl oating population would evade the onechild policy 17 and contribute to the introduction of traditional rural infectious diseases to cities. 18 Migrant workers consistently underuse health services both in their origin communities and in their destination cities, creating potential short-term and long-term health problems. A large study in Shenzhen-one of the top destinations for migrant workers in China (appendix)-showed that 55% of migrant workers were uninsured, and 62% of migrant workers who reported illness did not visit a doctor. 19 China's development strategy shifted to accept and promote migration to urban areas as important for stimulation of economic growth, and several major cities have initiated policies to address the major health issues facing migrants. In the 1990s, Beijing introduced policies intended to regulate the migrant population by, among other things, requiring that migrant workers had certifi cation that they were in good health before they could legally work. 20 This policy was tested during the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2003, when management of migrant workers became crucial for containment of the epidemic in the city. 20 In 2006, Beijing changed its approach, dropped the requirement for health certifi cation, and off ered basic health-care services through community health-service centres, along with free diagnosis and treatment for tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS. 20 Children of migrant workers were off ered health-care services equal to those of registered urban citizens. 20 Progress has been slow, however, in the improvement of urban health-care access elsewhere. In 2006, only 28% of the urban population were covered by the Basic Health Insurance Scheme, which is the main urban health-care insurance scheme. 21, 22 The main reason for this low coverage was that the scheme did not cover informal sector workers and migrant workers. 21, 22 Positively, the Ministry of Health announced a pilot project in 2010, modelled on the Beijing programme, that aims to provide health-care services and health education to migrant workers in 65 major cities and counties in 29 provinces. 23 The challenges of health-care delivery to rural-tourban migrants are made especially clear by China's childhood immunisation programmes, which have been substantially complicated by urbanisation. Since the early 1970s, the Planned Immunisation Programme has provided basic vaccines for tuberculosis, diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus, poliomyelitis, and measles; hepatitis B was added in 1992. Since 2005, the programme has off ered nine vaccines free of charge to all neonates and infants nationwide, and coverage has increased strikingly in both urban and rural areas. Much progress has been made towards closing the urban-rural gap in coverage. For instance, in 1993, hepatitis B vaccination coverage was less than 50% in nearly all rural communities, whereas it was over 90% in urban areas. 24 By contrast, in 2006, hepatitis B vaccination coverage reached 95% in urban neonates and exceeded 80% in most rural areas. 25 Despite this progress, the mass rural-to-urban migration over the past two decades has resulted in a troubling trend whereby immunisation coverage in the children of migrants is less extensive than in both their urban and rural counterparts. [26] [27] [28] [29] For example, in the Pearl River Delta region of Guangdong Province-which is a major destination for migrant workers (appendix)-average full-dose coverage for tuberculosis, diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus, poliomyelitis, measles, and hepatitis B in the children of migrant workers was estimated to be less than 60%. 26 In less developed migrant destinations, such as Guigang City in Guangxi, the full-dose coverage was less than 20%, except for tuberculosis (36%). 27 China has addressed these troubling trends by establishing community health-service centres in urban areas to provide basic post-birth immunisation, among other services, but they have been underused by migrant workers. Little awareness of immunisation among migrant parents, the costs associated with inoculation, 26,27 frequent job-related changes of residence, 28 and births that violate the onechild policy have been cited as important factors driving low immunisation coverage in their children. To strengthen immunisation programmes to reach this population is now a high priority for China's health policy makers. The absence of continuous health-care coverage of rural-to-urban migrants puts many at risk of a dual infectious disease burden. Migrants can be exposed to pathogens associated with rural poverty (eg, soiltransmitted helminths) and diseases associated with crowded, urban environments (eg, tuberculosis). For example, parasitic diseases such as schistosomiasis and helminth infections are common in poor rural areas of southwestern and central China, home to more than half of the country's migrant workers. Rural residents are examined and treated regularly by local specialist health agencies (eg, anti-schistosomiasis stations), but infected migrant workers often go undiagnosed and untreated in their urban homes, leading to morbidity and raising the risk of reintroduction of diseases into previously controlled rural areas when workers return home to visit. 30 Furthermore, a study in Beijing show ed that the crowded working and living conditions of migrant workers might put them at higher risk of tuberculosis infection than permanent residents. 31 Urban environments might be associated with an increased risk of sexually transmitted infections, because high-risk sexual behav iours are more common and the prevalence of sexually transmitted infections is higher in rural-to-urban migrants than in their rural counterparts. 32",

            "text": "As urbanisation continues in China, chronic diseases could become less concentrated in urban areas. Worldwide, the urban-rural gap in the distribution of overweight and hypertension diminishes with increasing country-level wealth and development. 47, 48 Similarly, obesity, hypertension, physical inactivity, and high intake of dietary fat are more prevalent in towns and cities in China, but the diff erence in their prevalence between urban and rural areas has declined as the economy has expanded. 8 The drivers of these trends are not well understood. Possibly, the rise in these risk factors in rural areas is an indirect result of urbanisation. For example, increased socioeconomic status in rural residents resulting from fi nancial support from family members in urban areas, could aff ect a rural family's agricultural activities and ability to purchase processed foods. Rural areas can become increasingly urbanised over time and can acquire characteristics of urban environments that promote chronic disease. Longitudinal examination of an area's urbanicity in relation to risk factors for chronic disease could potentially identify specifi c characteristics of urban environments that promote non-communicable diseases. Eff orts to reduce overweight and hypertension and their health sequelae should address the dietary changes and reductions in physical activity that have occurred in both urban and rural populations. The success of behavioural interventions to reduce obesity and hypertension-related chronic disease have been restricted, and structural interventions are necessary-eg, urban planning to promote active lifestyles and agricultural policies that promote healthy diets. 49 Urbanisation can also promote neuropsychiatric disorders, which are a leading cause of disease burden in China-an estimated 17% of the adult population has one or more mental disorders. 50 Urban environments present psychological stressors such as noise and social isolation, 51 and Chinese migrant populations could be especially vulnerable to their eff ects. Generally, migrant populations have better physical health than their non-migrant peers, but rural-to-urban and urban-tourban migrants in China report higher psychological distress than do non-migrating populations, a trend that lessens as the length of residence in the urban destination increases. 52 Migrant populations could be vulnerable to discrimination and stigmatisation, and also might become stressed by fi nding work, housing, schools for their children, and health care without the protections and benefi ts aff orded by hukou registration. 53 Shifts in family structure as working-age adults leave rural areas have mental health consequences for those left behind, as has been noted in children left in rural villages by rural-to-urban migrant parents. 54 Notably, the prevalence of mental illness is similar in rural and urban China, and depressive disorders and alcohol dependency are more prevalent in rural than in urban areas, which is not explained by diff erential access to treatment. 50, 55 Whether rural depression and substance abuse are secondary eff ects of urbanisation, or urban environments have mental health protective eff ects remains unclear and warrants investigation. Mental health services that target migrant populations and other highrisk groups are urgently needed; only 5% of Chinese adults with a mental disorder have seen a mental health professional. 50",

            "text": "Despite the massive increase in China's urban population, access to piped drinking water increased from 48% of the urban population in 1990, to nearly 94% in 2007. 1 Provision of piped water, however, has not guaranteed access to safe urban water supplies and the burgeoning urban population is putting immense strain on municipal water suppliers. A 2006 survey 56 of several thousand suppliers revealed that more than a quarter of municipal drinking water plants and more than half of private plants were not complying with monitoring requirements for water quality. Urbanisation is proceeding rapidly even though nearly half of China's major cities do not comply with health-based standards for drinking water. 57 Water scarcity is a big challenge for China's urbanisation trajectory. Urban domestic water use per head has risen only slightly, despite the substantial rise in urban incomes, and the total urban water supply has remained somewhat constant. 58 This consistency has largely been maintained by policies designed to reduce industrial urban water demand (eg, by moving indus trial enterprises out of cities). 58 Future growth, espe cially in areas where water is scarce, might push muni ci pal suppliers to contaminated sources with worrying consequences for public health. 59 Meanwhile, urban areas encroaching on rural communities will put pressure on nearby rural water supplies, which are less developed. To secure safe, reliable water supplies in line with future urban growth is one of the most pressing challenges for China's planners. In a country with one of the lowest per-head water supplies (less than 2156 m\u00b3 per head per year 59 ), further investments in source protection, effi ciency, and conservation are urgently needed.",

            "text": "The burning of coal indoors in urban areas remains common despite attempts to reduce household use. 59 This reliance on coal is partly because electricity and liquefi ed petroleum gas supplies can be erratic in rapidly urbanising areas with strained energy systems. By decreasing the number of households relying on coal and other solid fuels, indoor air pollution in China's rapidly growing cities could be greatly reduced. 62 Clean household fuels and stringent vehicle emission standards would be important steps forward, 63 especially since lung cancer incidence is higher in urban areas than in rural settings, despite higher rates of smoking in rural populations, a trend that could be explained partly by exposures to air pollutants. 64, 65 Injury-related deaths (800 000 annually) are recognised as a substantial public health challenge in China. 66 Over the past three decades, changes in transport modes, housing, and lifestyles have contributed to new patterns of accidents and injuries, and rapid urbanisation has had a key role in driving these trends, particularly traffi c-related and occupational accidents and injuries. 67 In urban areas, increasingly crowded roadways are shared by a mix of pedestrians and motorised and non-motorised vehicles that compete for road space. In the absence of separate rights of way, pedestrians and cyclists are put at heightened risk of accidents and injuries, especially at intersections. 68 Slowing of traffi c because of rising congestion in urban areas could have played a part in stabilisation or even reduction of traffi c death rates, 67 but traffi c-related accidents and injuries remain the country's leading cause of injuryrelated deaths. 66 Cyclists and pedestrians are especially at risk, and make up 60% of traffi c-related deaths. 66, 68 Such non-motorised transport is still used for as many as 40-55% of total trips taken in Beijing and Shanghai and a much higher proportion of journeys than that in smaller cities. 68 Urban poor people-especially migrants-are most reliant on these non-motorised transport modes. 68 Occupational accidents and injuries are a big concern, especially for migrants who have dangerous work environments, such as those in construction or heavy industry. 69 In 2004, nearly all the 39 million construction workers in China were migrants. 69 Migrant workers work nearly 50% longer hours, are less educated, and have less experience than non-migrant urban workers-all of which lead to increased risks of injuries. 70 Although reliable data for occupational accident rates are unavailable, reports of work-related injuries (eg, pneumoconiosis, poisoning, and noise deafness) in migrant workers are common. 71 A 2004 survey by the Ministry of Health recorded that 83% of township-based and villagebased enterprises had unsafe working conditions and 16% of surveyed workers had occupational disease. 72 An important corollary is that the children left behind when migrants move could also be at greater risk of accidents and injuries, partly because households with only one parent can have reduced capacity to supervise young children who are accident prone; 73 more than 20 million such so-called left-behind children are estimated to exist in China. 74",

Urbanisation delays child bearing of urban migrants, and urbanites are likely to adhere more strictly to the one-child policy than rural dwellers. 79 Thus, urban populations usually have low fertility rates, 79 which, combined with longer life expectancy in urban areas, tend to yield rapidly ageing urban populations. However, both the push and pull factors driving urbanisation (panel) attract millions of young rural migrants into urban areas (more than 85% of migrants are younger than 40 years 9 ), which greatly reduces the proportion of older urbanites. Because of the migration of young people to urban centres, people in rural areas are ageing rapidly. One study examining this eff ect showed that, in the absence of rural-to-urban migration, the proportion of the population older than 65 years would reach 25% in urban areas and 16% in rural areas by 2050. With migration included, the population older than 65 years would reach 21% in urban areas and 23% in rural areas in 2050, a substantially younger urban and older rural popu lation, respectively. 79 The rapid pace of ageing poses serious challenges for China, both now and in the future. In urban areas, data from 2000 show that 71% of the urban population older than 60 years reported pension benefi ts, and 12% had relied on social security. 80 By contrast, in rural areas only 5% reported pension benefi ts, and 1\u00b75% depended on social security, with most (about 85%) of the elderly population dependent on family support. 80 The one-child policy has greatly reduced the number of children available to support ageing parents, and urbanisation has increased the geographical separation between adult children and their parents, restricting familial social support. 76, 81 However, adult children who migrate and fi nd work could provide increased economic support to their parents. 82 The interaction between urbanisation and population ageing must be considered as China takes measures to reform its social security system. In particular, urgent attention is needed to strengthen rural social security-such as health-care and pension systems-and to develop innovative ways to increase support networks for rural elders in the absence of familial ties.",

A framework that recognises an urban-rural overlap rather than an urbanrural dichotomy could help to identify key aspects of urbanisation that are protective of or detrimental to health. Furthermore, to account for the eff ects of urbanisation in rural areas is important. The pull of young adults to urban areas has profound eff ects on rural social structure, and increased connections between formerly isolated rural villages and cities can speed up the spread of infectious disease. Urban air and water pollution can extend to rural areas through environmental transport, whereas rural environmental pollution can reach urban areas-eg, when fresh produce contaminated by unsafe pesticides reaches urban markets. These pathways are complex and defy simple solutions, but need to be rigorously investigated to understand and respond to the health eff ects of urbanisation in China.",

These monitoring activities should extend to periurban, suburban, and rural areas to assess the reach of typically urban environmental pollutants in rural areas.

The provision of aff ordable health care to rural-to-urban migrants in urban areas irrespective of hukou status is urgently needed, and healthcare providers must be aware of the dual urban-rural disease risks faced by these populations. Electronic medical record keeping, already common in many community hospitals in urban settings, 85 could improve health-care continuity. The mobility of migrants has relevance for infectious diseases, which can potentially be transported long distances. Because migrants' use of health care is increasing, a key opportunity exists to reduce long-distance transmission by raising vaccination coverage and improving infectious-disease surveillance. Hospitals undertake real-time surveillance of reportable ill nesses through China's internet-based Infectious Disease Reporting Information System-a powerful and robust system, provided that individuals with disease have suffi cient access to health care.",

Urban area in each province was estimated as the sum of the areas of the individual cities in that province. The large map depicts the size of urban areas in 2010, whereas the two smaller maps are for 1990 and 2000. The pillar in each province represents the ratio of the growth of urban area in that province between 1990 and 2000, to growth between 2000 and 2010. The height of the scale bar is equivalent to a 1\u00b75-times change in area within that period. Data from Wang and colleagues, 2011. 12",
