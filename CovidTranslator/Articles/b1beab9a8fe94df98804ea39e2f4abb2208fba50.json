Kazatchkine The dramatic increase in both the number of novel infectious agents and resistance to antimicrobial drugs has incited the need for adjunct therapies in the war against infectious diseases. Exciting recent studies have demonstrated the use of antibodies in the form of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) against infections. By virtue of the diverse repertoire of immunoglobulins that possess a wide spectrum of antibacterial and antiviral specificities, IVIg provides antimicrobial efficacy independently of pathogen resistance and represents a promising alternative strategy for the treatment of diseases for which a specific therapy is not yet available.",

Humoral immunity is mediated by B cells, which produce antibodies that contribute towards neutralization of pathogens and their clearance. Vaccination is aimed at stimulating adaptive immune response in the long term in an antigen-specific manner, using modified or inactivated pathogens or components derived from pathogens. Instant and short-term protection against infection can be achieved through administration of specific antibodies in a passive manner [1] . Before antibiotics and antimicrobial drugs were available for clinical use, antibodies through passive serotherapy were used for the treatment of certain infections.",

            "text": "The 20th century witnessed remarkable discoveries, including antimicrobial agents, that changed the face of medical practice. The use of antibiotics and preventive vaccines led to a decline in major endemics in industrialized countries and, to a lesser extent, in developing countries. However, pathogens developed resistance to antimicrobial agents in both developing and developed countries ( Figure 1 ). The emergence of an alarmingly significant resistance to antimicrobial agents in pathogens, together with the recognition of an increasing range of novel infectious agents and the potential threat of biological warfare, have rekindled interest in antibody-based therapies as potential adjuncts in the battle against infectious diseases. The immunity conferred by vaccines depends on the condition of the host and demands a certain time-frame for a response whereas passive antibody, in principle, can deliver instant protection regardless of the immune status of the host. Several reports have recently re-emphasized the potential use of antibodies in the form of intravenous Figure 1 . Evolution of infectious diseases and microbial resistance. The optimism generated by the dawn of the antimicrobial era in the mid-1940s was soon quenched by the emergence of penicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. The evolution of increasingly antimicrobial-resistant pathogens in both developing (a) and developed countries (b) stems from a multitude of factors that include: the widespread and sometimes inappropriate use of antimicrobials, the extensive use of these agents as growth enhancers in animal feed, the relative ease with which antimicrobial-resistant bacteria cross geographic barriers and widespread industrial and agricultural use. Indiscriminate use of antimicrobials and failed treatments with 'old and simple' drugs because of economic reasons in developing countries has also led to more severe disease or to the spread of infection, along with its contingent selection pressure, leading to the emergence of variants. immunoglobulin (IVIg) as an anti-infectious agent in several viral and bacterial infections. IVIg is a therapeutic preparation of normal human IgG obtained from pools of plasma from thousands of healthy blood donors [2] . Exposure of such donors to their unique environment (e.g. geography, endemics of infections, vaccination and type offood antigens) gives rise to IVIg that consists of a diverse repertoire of immunoglobulin molecules that possess a wide spectrum of antibacterial and antiviral specificities. Although specific hyperimmune gammaglobulins are available, their application is limited to specific pathogens [3] , whereas the advantage of IVIg for the treatment of infectious diseases lies in its polyclonality: that is, its ability to interact with a broad range of antigens and pathogens.",

Attempts to enhance the half-life of IVIg by the intranasal route using a liposomal formulation have been unsuccessful [31] .

However, there are enough encouraging experimental and clinical data to maintain continuing interest in the IVIg field and demand further studies in infectious conditions for which IVIg has been found to be beneficial in uncontrolled studies (i.e. those that lack placebo-controlled clinical trials). Controlled trials, particularly with viral diseases and certain defined septic subgroups where IVIg represents a promising but unproven treatment, are imperative. It is evident, however, that IVIg preparations must contain the functionally active and optimal amounts of antigen-specific antibodies to be effective. IVIg preparations have not been compared thoroughly for efficiency and adverse events. According to regulatory guidelines, IVIg products are tested for sterility, purity, pyrogenicity and safety. However, no strict requirements exist concerning concentrations of specific antibodies. Further research is required to understand the mechanisms of action of IVIg in infectious diseases and the relative role of functional antibodies within IVIg. ",
