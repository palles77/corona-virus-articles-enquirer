Greece authorizes and regulates communicable disease control commensurate with public health risks, and integrates the principles of equality, objectivity, and respect for human rights. Despite strength at the level of principles, Greek law lacks coherence, clarity, and systematization. An inadequate body of regulations means legislation falls short of adequate implementing authority and guidelines; public health authorities often cannot find or understand the laws, nor are they certain about allocation of jurisdictional authority. We identified areas for improvement.",

These interventions are intrusive, may clash with individual rights, have social and economic consequences, 4 and are often applied in emergencies under media and political pressure 5 -even though none has been proven effective conclusively. 6 To support effective interventions without encouraging disproportionate or discriminatory restrictions, public health authorities need clear authority and limits. 7, 8 Globalization of disease highlights the importance of balance; countries benefit from transnational cooperation based on commonly accepted rules. 9 The World Health Organization (WHO) revised International Health Regulations (IHR), adopted and enacted them in 2005 (known as 'IHR2005') and 2007, respectively.",

Legal and regulatory action shifted focus to regulation of health care in Greece as it did elsewhere in the western world. Regulations appeared sporadically, notably in response to tuberculosis and sexually transmitted diseases. Only in 2003, in anticipation of the 2004 Athens Olympic Games, did the government seriously attempt to regain capacity to control infectious diseases effectively. This reform effort did not include a well-conceptualized revision of preexisting statutes and public health officers pointed to shortcomings, lack of clarity about jurisdictional boundaries, lines of command, and procedural requirements. 11 To facilitate achievement of a more effective legal framework for controlling communicable diseases, we conducted a qualitative review of pertinent Greek legislation to map the legal terrain, evaluate the adequacy of the laws in light of the new international legal norms, and to identify weaknesses to address in content or structure.",

We tracked amendments to legal texts through the Legal Database of the Athens Bar Association. A more complete review would also encompass administrative regulations, governmental policy statements, and other regulating instruments. We reviewed legislation conferring powers to implement restrictive measures and mandatory clinical interventions. Because coding and analysis of Greek environmental public health legislation has already been published we excluded environmental laws (for vector control, water sanitation and so on). 12,13",

Older forms of law such as Royal Decrees also remain enforceable and form the basis of more recent regulatory documents. Numerous laws fell into disuse for decades, and have neither been reformed nor revoked since, whereas others have never been implemented. The legal validity of these is questionable. 14 Medical advances and epidemiologic changes have rendered several laws obsolete, such as a requirement for annual radiography screening of public employees for tuberculosis control purposes (1960) ( Table 1) .",

Mandatory treatment and confinement as the first line of containment reappeared in laws on sexually transmitted diseases (1939, 1960) and leprosy (1969), but eventually the government revoked these (1981). HIV/AIDS specific statutes strengthened preexisting confidentiality provisions (1986). Broader personal data protection law (1997) included strict exceptions for (2003, 2005, 2007) with establishment of two more administrative levels, and an emergency response service to meet IHR (2005) and European 'early response and notification' requirements.

Consistent with IHR (2005), Greek reform reintroduced the communitarian foundations of control strategies, mandating restrictions of individual liberties when necessary for protecting public health. Disease control is consistently treated as public health protection and crafted to avoid undue impact on individuals. Thus Greek law aligns with public health provisions in the revised IHR, and in laws of France, Sweden, and other countries. [24] [25] [26] Disease control is not treated as a national security issue that would be reminiscent of the older policing approach. 27 Thus, Greek law embodies current understanding of effective public health practice with emphasis on public education and transparent procedures, not on punitive, coercive or stigmatizing ones that may drive epidemics 'underground'. 28, 29 Along with these amendments to align Greek law conceptually with EU and international legislation, the Ministry of Health drafted a national public health plan (2008) incorporating policies for meeting EU and IHR (2005) disease control objectives. However, Greek implementation has lagged; the pressing economic situation raises questions about whether the country will fully meet its obligations by the IHR (2005) deadline in 2012. Major legislative weaknesses stem from failing to follow up core infectious disease control law with supplementary legal and administrational regulations needed to guide implementation. Inconsistent and uncoordinated law making contributed to incomplete establishment of structures and procedures. Governmental change or emergence of new diseases exposed legal and administrative inadequacies, whereas consecutive reforms remade structures, policies, and procedures. Reforms have not thoughtfully integrated preexisting legislation, nor have obsolete or conflicting provisions regularly been removed. Thus, the existing body of pertinent law consists of fragmented requirements from numerous legal texts and different eras; these vary in content, applicability, and, possibly, legal validity.",
