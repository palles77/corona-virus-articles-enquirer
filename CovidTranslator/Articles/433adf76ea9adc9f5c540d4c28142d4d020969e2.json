However, since shifts in infection susceptibility after commensal bacteria eradication have primarily been probed using viruses, the broader applicability to other pathogen types remains undefined. In sharp contrast to diminished antiviral immunity, we show commensal bacteria eradication bolsters protection against disseminated Candida albicans fungal infection. Enhanced antifungal immunity reflects more robust systemic expansion of Ly6G hi Ly6C int neutrophils, and their mobilization into infected tissues among antibiotic treated compared with commensal bacteria replete control mice. Reciprocally, depletion of neutrophils from expanded levels or intestinal LPS reconstitution overrides the antifungal protective benefits conferred by commensal bacteria eradication. This discordance in antifungal compared with antiviral immunity highlights intrinsic differences in how commensal bacteria control responsiveness for specific immune cell subsets because pathogen-specific CD8 + T cells that protect against viruses were suppressed similarly after C. albicans and influenza A virus infection. Thus, positive calibration of antiviral immunity by commensal bacteria is counterbalanced by restrained activation of other immune components that confer antifungal immunity.",

Since the greatest density of commensal bacteria reside within the intestinal tract with an estimated 100 trillion organisms comprising over 1000 individual species, 1 the symbiotic relationship between commensal microbes and the mammalian host have appropriately been most extensively characterized in this tissue. Accumulating evidence shows enteric commensal bacteria play important roles in maintaining local immune homeostasis, along with digestion and nutrient absorption. 1 In turn, disrupting the composition of intestinal bacteria represents an important iatrogenic cause of diarrhea from antibiotics used for infection treatment or prevention. 2 Although the microbial culprits in most cases are unidentified, a classic example is toxin-induced intestinal inflammation from Clostridium difficile overgrowth among antibiotic exposed individuals. 2 Disruptions in intestinal microbiota composition similarly occur among individuals with ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease, 3 and the communicability of aberrant intestinal inflammation to genetically non-susceptible hosts reinforces the immune regulatory properties of enteric commensal microbes. 4 Thus among healthy individuals, commensal intestinal microbes and immune cells sustain a delicate crosstalk that silences pathological inflammation while simultaneously preserving host defense against enteric pathogens.",

            "text": "Commensal bacteria have been shown to play equally pivotal roles with regards to susceptibility against more pathogenic microbes. During systemic or extra-intestinal infection caused by viruses, commensal bacteria appear uniformly protective in augmenting host defense. Studies using viral infections to probe immune shifts following antibiotic induced eradication of commensal bacteria consistently show blunted expansion of protective virus specific CD8 + T cells, along with impaired clearance of influenza A in the respiratory tract and viremia caused by lymphocytic-choriomeningitis virus. 11, 12 These findings may explain the clinical observations of antibiotic associated susceptibility to viral respiratory infection, 13 and alleviation of viral gastroenteritis by probiotics. 14 Importantly however, since viruses, naturally resistant to antibiotics used to eradicate commensal bacteria, have been widely utilized for probing shifts in host defense following commensal bacteria elimination, the extension of these protective benefits to other pathogen types remains undefined. Nonetheless, this represents a critically important question considering the immune components bolstered by commensal microbes that protect against viruses are either dispensable (e.g., CD8 + T cells, IFN-\u03b3) 11, 12, [16] [17] [18] or play inconsistent roles (e.g., IFN\u03b1/\u03b2) 11, 19, 20 in antifungal immunity. Accordingly, to investigate how commensal bacteria controls responsiveness of immune components that protect against systemic fungal infection, the impacts of commensal bacteria eradication on susceptibility to intravenous Candida albicans infection were evaluated. Surprisingly, we show eradication of commensal bacteria bolsters antifungal immunity with enhanced systemic neutrophil expansion and enriched accumulation in infected tissues that is in sharp contrast to diminished resistance against viral pathogens. Thus, our findings establish fundamentally discordant roles for commensal bacteria in regulating antifungal compared with antiviral immunity.",

Moreover, these antibiotics collectively had no impact on C. albicans growth in cell free broth media (Figure  1b) , illustrating potential differences in host susceptibility following antibiotic administration reflect shifts in antifungal immunity. Consistent with the restricted pathogen distribution described after intravenous C. albicans inoculation, 21,22 recoverable fungi were found almost exclusively within the kidneys with only sporadic colonies recovered from other tissues including the brain, liver, and spleen regardless of antibiotic treatment (Figure  1c and d) . Interestingly, while progressively increasing fungal pathogen burden was found for commensal bacteria replete control mice maintained on autoclaved drinking water through the first 20 days after infection, recoverable C. albicans declined among antibiotic treated mice beginning day 10, and fungal pathogen burden was reduced by >100-fold compared with control mice by day 20 post-infection (Figure 1c) . Significantly improved overall survival paralleled these reductions in C. albicans pathogen burden in commensal bacteria eradicated mice (77% survival among antibiotic treated compared with 47% survival among control mice, P < 0.05) (Figure 1e) . Thus, antibiotic induced eradication of commensal bacteria augments protection against disseminated C. albicans infection.",

Starting at comparable levels of prior to infection, expansion of CD11b + Ly6G hi Ly6C int neutrophils in the blood and accumulation within the kidneys were both significantly increased beginning 5 days after infection in commensal bacteria eradicated mice (Figure  2a and b) . Higher neutrophil levels were found in the blood and kidneys of antibiotic treated compared with control mice despite >100-fold reduced C. albicans pathogen burden 20 days post-infection (Figure 2a, b and 1c) .

Enumerating absolute cell numbers further verified Ly6G hi Ly6C int neutrophil expansion was most pronounced compared with other immune cell subsets after intravenous C. albicans infection regardless of commensal bacteria depletion (Figure 2c) .

Despite more accelerated C. albicans clearance among antibiotic treated mice after infection in vivo (Figure 1c) , neutrophils isolated from commensal bacteria depleted and control mice had comparable fungicidal activity on a per cell basis at each post-infection time point (Figure 3b ). In turn, expression of molecules associated with neutrophil activation including autocrine IL-17A production, expression of the upstream transcriptional regulator ROR\u03b3T and oxidative burst potential 25-27 each did not shift significantly among Ly6G hi Ly6C int neutrophils in commensal bacteria depleted compared with control mice (Supplementary Figure S2) . Similarly, expression of elastase and myeloperoxidase each associated with extracellular trap formation and neutrophil antifungal activity 28, 29 was comparable among neutrophils regardless of antibiotic treatment (Figure 3c and d) , whereas production of the extracellular trap effector, calprotectin, 30 was slightly increased among Ly6G hi Ly6C int cells from commensal bacteria depleted mice (Figure 3e) .

Since reduced pathogen recovery and improved survival among commensal bacteria eradicated mice becomes apparent beginning 10 days after infection, with more exaggerated differences in pathogen recovery by day 20 post-infection (Figure 1c and d) , neutrophil depletion was initiated 10 days after infection and the impacts on pathogen burden enumerated 10 days thereafter. These studies utilized the 1A8 clone of the anti-mouse Ly6G antibody that spares Ly6G lo Ly6C hi inflammatory monocytes, allowing the contribution of Ly6G hi Ly6C int neutrophils to be evaluated in isolation. 31 Despite somewhat reduced efficiency of cell depletion compared with that reported after infection with pathogens that cause more acute infection, 31 the consistent ~50% depletion of neutrophils from expanded levels in antibiotic treated mice was still sufficient to override reductions in fungal burden conferred by commensal bacteria eradication (Figure 4a and b) . In particular, 20-fold more C. albicans was recovered from antibiotic treated mice administered anti-Ly6G compared with isotype control antibody (Figure 4b) . Comparatively, no significant differences in recoverable fungal pathogen burden were found with anti-Ly6G antibody among commensal bacteria replete mice with dampened neutrophil expansion (Figure 4a and b) . Interestingly, increased C. albicans pathogen burden after neutrophil depletion among antibiotic treated mice was not associated with significant differences in overall survival likely because a substantial proportion of both anti-Ly6G and isotype antibody treated mice had already begun to succumb by day 10 post infection when neutrophil depletion was initiated (Figure 4c ). To circumvent this limitation, related experiments tracked survival for separate groups of mice administered anti-Ly6G compared with isotype control antibody 5 days after intravenous C. albicans infection, before any mice became moribund or succumbed to infection. This analysis showed neutrophil depletion initiated earlier after infection eliminated protection conferred by commensal bacteria eradication as antibiotic treated and control mice each succumbed more rapidly and with similar accelerated kinetics (Figure 4d) . Thus, enhanced protection against disseminated C. albicans infection unleashed by eradication of intestinal commensal bacteria requires enriched Ly6G hi Ly6C int neutrophil expansion.",

Since C. albicans can establish colonization in the intestinal lumen following systemic infection, 32 we first evaluated whether enteric bacteria were retained among mice without antibiotic treatment after C. albicans infection. To discriminate bacteria from C. albicans, microbial growth from the fecal pellet after plating on media without antibiotic supplementation was compared to media supplemented with the same cocktail of antibiotics (ampicillin, gentamicin, metronidazole, neomycin, vancomycin) added to the drinking water. This combination of antibiotics prevents growth of commensal bacteria, and accordingly microbial recovery on antibiotic supplemented media represent enteric C. albicans, while growth on nonsupplemented media reflects the cumulative bacterial plus fungal commensal burden. As expected, the feces of mice maintained on drinking water without antibiotic supplementation contained exclusively commensal bacteria, and no fecal organisms could be recovered from antibiotic treated mice prior to C. albicans infection (Figure 5a) . Comparatively after C. albicans intravenous infection, antibiotic treated mice devoid of commensal bacteria became densely colonized by fungi as comparably high fecal CFUs were recovered regardless of antibiotic supplementation in the culture media (Figure 5a) . By contrast, 97% of the commensal burden in C. albicans infected mice without antibiotic supplementation in the drinking water was bacterial as the ~10 6.5 CFUs/g recovered on media without antibiotic supplementation became reduced to only ~10 5 CFUs/g on antibiotic supplemented media (Figure 5a) .

After infection with a sub-lethal dose of recombinant influenza A H1N1, PR8-OVA, that stably expresses the immune-dominant H-2K b ovalbumin (OVA) 257-264 peptide, 34 significantly more weight loss and recovery of viral plaque forming units in the lung homogenate were found for antibiotic treated compared with commensal bacteria replete control mice (Figure  6a and b) . This enhanced susceptibility to influenza A among commensal bacteria depleted mice paralleled sharp reductions in expansion of OVA-specific CD8 + T cells with surrogate viral specificity (Figure 6c) . Thus, the protective benefits of commensal bacteria on antiviral immunity previously reported using other influenza strains for infection and mice housed at other research facilities are recapitulated. 11, 12 Considering protection against C. albicans from enhanced accumulation of neutrophils after eradication of commensal bacteria (Figure 1 and 2) , these results suggest the discordance in antifungal compared with antiviral immunity conferred by commensal intestinal bacteria more likely reflects fundamental differences in how commensal microbes control activation of unique immune components that protect against infection with viral rather than fungal pathogens. To further investigate this hypothesis, the role of commensal intestinal bacteria on expansion of CD8 + T cells after infection with recombinant C. albicans engineered to express the same H-2K b OVA 257-264 peptide was evaluated. 35 Remarkably, a near identical reduction in expansion of OVA-specific CD8 + T cells among commensal bacteria depleted mice was observed after infection with recombinant C. albicans compared with influenza A (Figure 6c and d) . Thus, commensal bacteria uniformly promote antigen-specific CD8 + T cell expansion regardless of inciting pathogen type, while simultaneously restricting optimal accumulation of Ly6G hi Ly6C int neutrophils. Taken together, these results demonstrate commensal bacteria differentially regulate activation of unique immune cell subsets that, in turn, cause discordant impacts on antifungal compared with antiviral immunity.",

            "text": "Commensal microbes are increasingly recognized to influence responsiveness of immune cells that dictates susceptibility to autoimmunity and infection. Since viruses are inherently resistant to antibiotics, shifts in host defense following commensal bacteria elimination have primarily been probed with viral pathogens. Here, commensal bacteria have been shown to play important, but somewhat discordant roles with regards to infection susceptibility. For example, antibiotic induced eradication of commensal intestinal bacteria consistently impairs host clearance of influenza A virus within the respiratory tract and prolongs viremia after systemic lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus infection. 11, 12 Diminished viral clearance in these instances parallel reduced priming and expansion of protective virus-specific CD8 + T cells in commensal bacteria eradicated mice. 11, 12 On the other hand, the presence of commensal intestinal bacteria also promotes susceptibility to numerous enteric viruses including poliovirus, retrovirus, and mouse mammary tumor virus that exploit bacterial LPS to improve transmissibility and infectivity. 36, 37 This latter enhanced capacity for intestinal invasion and replication conferred by commensal bacteria reflects direct viral modulation for enteric viruses, as opposed to systemic shifts in inflammasome or macrophage cell activation that occurs after infection with influenza A or lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus, respectively. 11, 12 Accordingly, to extend the applicability of these findings to systemic immunity against other pathogens that are equally ubiquitous, clinically important and resistant to antibiotics, the impacts of commensal bacteria eradication on antifungal immunity was investigated using an established murine model of disseminated C. albicans infection. 22 Surprisingly and in striking contrast to the protective benefits on systemic antiviral immunity, we show commensal bacteria collectively confer detrimental impacts on antifungal host defense. Among antibiotic treated mice depleted of intestinal commensal bacteria, significantly reduced C. albicans fungal burden and increased overall survival were observed when compared with commensal bacteria replete control mice. Importantly, these findings cannot be explained by differences in commensal bacteria composition for mice across institutions considering the antiviral protective benefits of commensal intestinal bacteria previously reported 11, 12 are reproduced after influenza A infection for mice maintained in our facility. Thus, commensal microbes differentially regulate unique immune cell subsets that control antifungal compared with antiviral immunity.",

For example, CD8 + T cells that confer protection against influenza virus and other pathogens that primarily reside within the intracellular compartment of infected host cells play only negligible roles in protection against C. albicans that mainly resides in extracellular compartments. 17, 18 A non-essential role for pathogen-specific CD8 + T cells in host defense against fungi like C. albicans is consistent with our results illustrating accelerated fungal clearance despite blunted expansion of CD8 + T cells with surrogate C. albicans OVA 257-264 specificity among commensal bacteria depleted mice. Instead, we show enhanced antifungal immunity after antibiotic induced commensal bacteria eradication reflects more robust neutrophil expansion and mobilization, whereas even partial neutrophil depletion with anti-Ly6G antibody (clone 1A8) overrides these protective benefits. Comparatively among commensal bacteria replete mice, the detrimental impacts of neutrophil depletion are moderated and potentially reversed since initiating neutrophil depletion 10 days after infection improved survival by ~30% (although this difference did not reach statistical significance, P = 0.08). These results parallel somewhat paradoxical detrimental roles for neutrophils shown using other loss-of-function approaches for these cells when disseminated candidiasis has already been established. For example, the initiation of neutrophil, together with monocyte and eosinophil, depletion using anti-Gr1 antibody (clone RB6-8C5) 7 days after intravenous C. albicans infection significantly improves overall survival. 24, 31 Similarly, Ccr1-deficient mice with impaired neutrophil accumulation in the kidneys beginning 9 days post-infection have improved overall survival after intravenous C. albicans infection compared with wild-type control mice. 43 Thus, while neutrophils are clearly important for protection early after disseminated candidiasis, 23,24 their accumulation later after fungal infection likely causes immune pathology similar to increased mortality with more robust neutrophil expansion after influenza A infection. 44 Taken together, these data suggest commensal bacteria not only control expansion of specific immune cell subsets that dictates whether increased susceptibility or resistance ensues, but shifts in their composition or density may influence the tempo of persistent infection as well.",

In particular, the use of antibiotics in most clinical settings almost certainly does not eliminate intestinal bacteria to near completion. Therefore, although our findings attribute impaired antifungal immunity to the presence of bacterial LPS in commensal microbe replete mice, shifts in the composition of commensal intestinal bacteria likely also play critical roles in modulating susceptibility to fungemia. This notion is supported by the observation that some commensal bacterial species such as segmented filamentous bacteria drive systemic Th17 CD4 + T cell differentiation 33 that, in turn, stimulates optimal neutrophil mobilization and immunity against extracellular pathogens including C. albicans. 46 Reciprocally, this may explain why widely used antibiotics including cephalosporins, penicillins and vancomycin that each have potent activity against segmented filamentous bacteria are each independently associated with increased risk for candidemia. 33, 47, 48 Based on these results and the increasing use of antibiotics in clinical medicine, identifying the most essential commensal microbiome subset(s) represent important next steps for dissecting how antifungal compared with antiviral immunity is discordantly regulated.",
