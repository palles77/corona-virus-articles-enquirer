            "text": "The global importance of tackling infectious pathogens has been emphasised recently with the rapid international spread of emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome, West Nile virus, and avian influenza, and the threat of bioterrorism. 1 The prevention and management of infectious diseases in refugees, internally displaced people, and disaster situations is an ever increasing problem. One essential arm of defence is experienced and competent personnel who have received training in the management of infectious diseases and can work together effectively. National and international capabilities for handling infectious diseases are wholly dependent on communication, collaboration, and a solid bedrock of appropriate training. An understanding of the training provided across the international community would help to facilitate better collaboration and communication. In addition, increasing awareness of the training and skills of colleagues overseas may provide other benefits, such as highlighting training and research opportunities, 2 developing clinical and public-health networks, and sharing educational goals and expertise. Combating emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases cannot be achieved by national initiatives alone, or even scattered international activities, but requires a cohesive international programme that includes collaborative training and research opportunities to prepare scientists and physicians. 3 Training in the management of infectious diseases encompasses many specialties, including adult infectious diseases, clinical/medical microbiology, virology, paediatric infectious diseases, HIV medicine, public health, interventional epidemiology, infection control, tropical medicine, vaccinology, travel medicine, and genitourinary medicine. These specialties undoubtedly overlap, and many training schemes include exposure to the \"subsidiary specialties\" to varying degrees. The above list is not all inclusive, and there is considerable overlap with other branches of medicine and surgery.",

            "text": "This paper seeks to set the ball rolling and begin to establish a knowledge base of training programmes within the infectious disease specialties. Features of programmes that already exist will be described, and changes that are taking place in training in different countries will be examined. Although we focus on postgraduate training programmes for medically qualified individuals, we acknowledge the vast contribution from non-medical experts in terms of personal experience and training-eg, nurses and paramedical personnel, basic scientists, microbiology laboratory workers, infection control practitioners, pharmacists, and epidemiologists. The short-term training courses that focus on more specific topics will be discussed. Our overall aim is to promote international understanding between different infectious disease specialists (panel 1). Furthermore, training directors could learn from the different models of programmes already established or being developed in other countries. Increased international appreciation may present new opportunities to develop productive exchange programmes, joint research programmes, supportive links, shared learning objectives, pooled web-based learning programmes, mutual recognition of training, skill sharing, and surveillance networks. To begin to disseminate information about training opportunities available, two of the authors (FJC, AHH) researched and directed the compilation of the UK manual Training in infection, which is currently being developed as a website (http://www.trainingininfection.org.uk) in collaboration International collaboration and understanding is becoming increasingly important as we face a soaring number of emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases. Management of these conditions calls for a cohesive international effort, with contributions from many infectious disease specialists. To optimise collaborative efforts, an international understanding of training, capabilities, and skills would be valuable. An investigation of postgraduate training programmes in the infectious disease specialties around the world was done. 33 countries contributed information. 26 of these countries had established training programmes-one of which was changing its duration and research component; three were in the process of setting up programmes, two provided specialist training that had no official recognition, and two had no specialist training. In addition to promoting international understanding and collaboration, this article should catalyse a global assessment of postgraduate training programmes within the field of infectious diseases.",

In most countries, the trainee's actual experience is likely to differ from place to place, depending on local expertise, resources, and opportunity. For example, the trainee may work at a single institute throughout, or rotate between centres for different aspects of their programme Entry requirements also varied. Most specified a period of general training, usually expecting a postgraduate qualification equivalent to membership of one of the UK royal colleges. In Sweden, an internship in internal medicine, surgery, general practice, and psychiatry is required. 4 A 6-month period in general practice is required in Norway. 5 Hungary and Slovenia mentioned a specific entrance examination.

In some places the specialty has assumed a strong and structured clinical base, being largely teaching hospital centred, whereas elsewhere it has not particularly developed as an independent specialty. This difference may be partly due to the false perception in the 1960s that infectious diseases had been controlled, and partly because in some countries infectious diseases are so common they form the bulk of general medicine. Where specific postgraduate training programmes exist, there is considerable variation in training opportunities. Currently, little is known about the overall picture and the international skill mix in infectious diseases-eg, in some countries microbiologists have a presence on the hospital wards and advise on specific patient management issues, whereas elsewhere they are solely laboratory based. Knowledge of national training programmes and an understanding of international training resources are vital in the management of current and emerging diseases and will undoubtedly contribute to the growth of effective networks and collaborations.",

The consolidated European Community Directive 93/16-known as the \"Doctors Directive\"aims \"to facilitate the free movement of doctors and the mutual recognition of their diplomas, certificates and other evidence of formal qualification\". To facilitate the movement of clinicians between countries, there have been efforts to standardise training programmes within Europe. In 1958, the European Union of Medical Specialists (UEMS; http://www.uems.net) was established to \"harmonise and improve the quality of medical specialist practice in the European Union\". The UEMS aims to provide a training framework so countries can compare training programmes, and to help countries establish new written training programmes and log books. In most European countries, the training content is similar to that of the UEMS. Initially, not enough national authorities recognised infectious diseases as a specialty for it to be a separate \"section\". Despite a growing recognition that infectious diseases still present considerable challenges, it was not until the mid-1990s that enough national authorities recognised infectious diseases as a specialty to apply for a new section. Approval was granted in 1996, and in the following year a section for infectious diseases was established as a sub-section within general internal medicine (http://www.uemsinfect.org). The Board for Infectious Diseases was established in 1998, and in 1999 the section approved a European training programme at the annual meeting in Geneva. The board proposed that there should be a 2-year minimum common trunk of general internal medicine and a 4-year minimum of specialty training. Microbiology is not yet an independent section but a subsection within the UEMS specialist section for medical biopathology. 11",

ACGME provides detailed, rigorous standards for infectious diseases training that all programmes must comply with. Each infectious diseases training programme has a specific programme director, who must spend 50% of their time in the educational programme of the fellowship, and must be certified by both infectious disease and general internal medicine boards. There are strict policy guidelines on supervision by all infectious diseases faculty members at each training base, and on clinical and research career development activities for all faculty members involved in fellowship training. Each infectious diseases fellow must complete 2 years of clinics, at least 1 year of clinical training, and 1 year of research; however, most fellows do at least 3 years of research. Fellows must receive specific training in infection control, HIV/AIDS, microbiology (including labora-tory work), sexually transmitted diseases, care of immunocompromised patients, and other subjects listed in the guidelines. However, there is still room for improvement-eg, a survey of infectious disease fellows who had recently graduated found that only half thought that training in infection control was adequate. 13 The tradition in the USA was for hospital microbiology laboratories to be led by scientists rather than clinicians. Thus a completely different pattern emerged, and infectious diseases became the larger and stronger specialty, firmly entrenched in general hospitals. 14 Over recent years, this situation has started to change, as clinically trained microbiologists, some of whom are also trained in public health and outbreak investigation, are heading for laboratories. According to Daniel Shapiro, director of microbiology at the Lahey Clinic, Massachusetts, USA, \"the training of microbiology laboratory directors takes place in formalised post-doctoral fellowship programmes in clinical microbiology for both PhDs and MDs. Unfortunately there are not many of these programmes\".",

Van Eldere suggests that \"the situation may be improved by recognising medical microbiology as a specific competence with a defined core curriculum, and striving to achieve a careful balance between the development of laboratory and clinical skills, through sufficient contact with infectious disease clinics\". Two countries, Malawi and India, have no specialist training programme in infectious diseases (table 5) . These countries are both developing countries, where training in general internal medicine involves wide exposure to infectious diseases. However, like other countries, medical politics and the protection of practice may dissuade the formation of new programmes. In India, T Jacob John, former professor and head of the department of virology at the Christian Medical College in Vellore says that \"all my career, physicians resisted such a subspecialisation, partly due to apathy, partly due to fear of loss of business, and most importantly because of lack of understanding of the issues involved\".",

However, within each country, research opportunities vary between local areas, depending on expertise and priorities. Different specialties also place different weight on whether an individual has undertaken a formal period of research, and this practice may have important implications for an individual's career progression. For example, until recently the postgraduate examination for microbiologists in the UK (Membership of the Royal College of Pathologists) required submission of a research project or dissertation. However, the impression is that more infectious disease trainees undertake research for a higher degree, compared with microbiology trainees, as this practice is favoured for career progression in infectious diseases. Funding may come from specific junior and senior research training fellowships, administered by charities, governmental, and research organisations that enable some trainees to pursue clinical or laboratory-based research.",

Jon S Friedland (professor of infectious diseases at the Hammersmith Hospital, Imperial College, London, and chair of the education and training committee at the Royal Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene) feels this lack of programmes is mainly due to \"conservatism within the profession\". Certainly the length of the training scheme-particularly with an additional 2-3 years research for a higher degree-may be off-putting to some. It remains to be seen what career paths will be taken or positions created for these individuals. One disadvantage is that joint infectious diseases/microbiology training excludes general internal medicine, which many infectious disease physicians regard as essential for infectious diseases practice. A report from the UK Academy of Medical Sciences-Academic bacteriology in the 21st century 17 -emphasised the importance of joint training in microbiology and infectious diseases. Many agree that it is no longer tenable to justify these two disciplines as separate specialties, since both are dependent on each other and should therefore be integrated. 18 This report named joint specialty training as one of its key areas for action, and emphasised the need to keep training requirements as flexible as possible. 19 Other potential joint training programmes Respondents to our questionnaire suggested exploring the following disciplines as future joint training schemes, in combination with infectious diseases or microbiology: public health, genitourinary/HIV medicine, clinical epidemiology, hospital epidemiology, travel medicine, and clinical pharmacology.",

The current entry requirement is for full training in internal medicine (minimum 3 years).

Since then, L Blumberg of the Infectious Diseases Society of South Africa informed us that it was recognised by the Health Professions Council of South Africa in the latter half of 2004. The programme is likely to consist of 2 years of specialisation after training as a general physician, paediatrician, or microbiologist. Microbiologists will require 3 years of clinical training. The exit examination will be likely to operate through the College of Medicine of South Africa and overall supervision will be by the university medical schools.

The report proposed that infection centres would develop collaborative working, create a critical mass of expertise, and provide a setting for high-quality research and training. The UK Academy of Medical Sciences also recommended establishing a small number of \"centres of excellence in microbiology and infection\", with multidisciplinary teams comprising basic research and clinical bacteriology working with cell biologists, immunologists, epidemiologists, and infectious disease clinicians. 19 At a local level this practice may improve working relations between clinicians, laboratory-based staff, and public health. Julius Weinberg, specialist advisor to the House of Lords' Select Committee on Science and Technology subcommittee which conducted the inquiry resulting in the Fighting infection report points out that \"there is plenty for microbiologists, virologists, infectious disease physicians, infection control nurses, environmental health officers, and epidemiologists to do, but as much energy seems to be expended on protecting areas of professional expertise and influence as on developing multidisciplinary teams essential for a modern infection service\". 19 Goebel agrees that \"infectious disease specialists should form a team together with clinical microbiologists, hospital hygienists, and clinical pharmacologists, the latter not being discussed at all!\" It is likely to be more difficult to establish such departments or networks in smaller hospitals, although equally important.",
