            "text": "Sedimentation velocity analytical ultracentrifugation has become a very popular technique to study size distributions and interactions of macromolecules. Recently, a method termed two-dimensional spectrum analysis (2DSA) for the determination of size-and-shape distributions was described by Demeler and colleagues (Eur Biophys J 2009). It is based on novel ideas conceived for fitting the integral equations of the size-andshape distribution to experimental data, illustrated with an example but provided without proof of the principle of the algorithm. In the present work, we examine the 2DSA algorithm by comparison with the mathematical reference frame and simple well-known numerical concepts for solving Fredholm integral equations, and test the key assumptions underlying the 2DSA method in an example application. While the 2DSA appears computationally excessively wasteful, key elements also appear to be in conflict with mathematical results. This raises doubts about the correctness of the results from 2DSA analysis.",

            "text": "The use of sedimentation velocity analytical ultracentrifugation (SV) has significantly expanded in the last decade (Howlett et al. 2006; Scott and Schuck 2006; Cole et al. 2008) , and new computational methods for SV analysis are being actively developed by several groups (Balbo et al. 2005; Philo 2006; Brown et al. 2007 Brown et al. , 2009 Behlke and Ristau 2009; Brookes et al. 2009; Correia and Stafford 2009) . In particular, diffusion-deconvoluted sedimentation coefficient distributions calculated from direct boundary modeling of experimental data (Schuck 2000; Schuck et al. 2002) have proven to be very useful tools in many biophysical applications (for a list of references see Schuck 2007) . They can achieve relatively high hydrodynamic resolution of pauci-and polydisperse macromolecular mixtures, exhibit exquisite sensitivity for trace components (Berkowitz 2006; Liu et al. 2006; Brown et al. 2008a, b; Gabrielson et al. 2009 ), and can be related to sedimentation coefficient isotherms and Gilbert-Jenkins theory for the analysis of slowly or rapidly interacting systems (Dam and Schuck 2005; . The extension of sedimentation coefficient distributions to two-dimensional sizeand-shape distributions was introduced (Schuck 2002 ; Brown and Schuck 2006) and applied in numerous studies (Markossian et al. 2006; Chang et al. 2007; Deng et al. 2007; Race et al. 2007; Broomell et al. 2008; Brown et al. 2008; Chebotareva et al. 2008; Iseli et al. 2008; Moncrieffe et al. 2008; Paz et al. 2008; Sivakolundu et al. 2008; Wang et al. 2008; Eronina et al. 2009; Mortuza et al. 2009 ). More recently, the Demeler laboratory has described the concept of a novel algorithm (''2DSA'') for determining size-and-shape distributions, as implemented in the software ULTRASCAN (Brookes et al. 2006 , 2009 Demeler et al. 2009 ). In the present work, we critically compare the background of the different algorithms and assess their performance.",

Let us consider as an example the experimental data from a preparation of IgG molecules sedimenting at 45,000 rpm, as shown in Fig. 1a . It is useful to start the analysis with a one-dimensional sedimentation coefficient distribution analysis c(s), since the sedimentation coefficients are the experimentally best determined quantities. c(s) eliminates the shape dimension by using hydrodynamic scaling laws such as the traditional s * M 2/3 law for globular particles (Schuck 2000) , theoretical models for wormlike chains (Yamakawa and Fujii 1973) or any user-defined exponential scaling laws for polymers (Pavlov et al. 2009 ). For the given data we can determine from the c(s) analysis (not shown) that s-values from 0.1 to 15 S will be sufficient to describe all sedimenting species. Equidistant discretizations with S = 100 or S = 200 lead to statistically indistinguishable quality of fit, as measured by F-statistics (Bevington and Robinson 1992; Straume and Johnson 1992) , and therefore we preliminarily conclude that S = 100 will be a reasonable choice.",

Therefore, a discretization providing F = 10 values between 1.0 and 2.5 (ranging from extremely compact to very extended protein structures) should be a sufficiently flexible basis to describe the actual frictional ratio for each species (knowing that we have inserted folded proteins into the sample solution, and keeping in mind the average frictional ratio of 1.68 estimated from the c(s) analysis). The resulting 10 9 100 grid with a total of K = 1,000 species was fitted with the standard algorithm to the data in Fig. 1a , leading to virtually random distribution of residuals (1b), with a root-mean-square deviation (rmsd) of 0.00672, consistent with the noise in the data acquisition. The resulting distribution is shown with and without regularization in Fig. 1d and c, respectively. As expected, while the s-values of the species are well defined, the shape dimension is highly underdetermined, resulting in the Fig. 1 Illustration of the standard algorithm for size-and-shape distributions applied to the experimental data of an immunoglobulin G sample, sedimenting at 45,000 rpm. a Experimental data acquired with the absorbance optical system (solid lines). The color temperature indicates the temporal order of the scans, with blue for the early and red for the late scans. The dotted lines, virtually overlapping the experimental data, are the best-fit distribution from modeling with Eq. (3) for a grid of K = 10 9 100 (f r , s)-values ranging from f r -values of 1.0 to 2.5 in 10 equidistant steps, and from s-values of 0.1 to 15.0 S in 100 equidistant steps. b Residuals of the fit, presented as a bitmap (Dam and Schuck 2004) and as an overlay plot for all traces. The root-mean-square deviation is 0.00672 OD. c Raw size-and-shape distribution without regularization. As in (Brown and Schuck 2006) , the 2D grid of (f r , s)-values is indicated by solid lines, combined with a color temperature contour map in the plane below. The solution is a series of spikes in f r -dimension, with a comparatively well-defined s-value of *5.8 S for the main species. An observation familiar in the study of IgG (and many other protein) samples is the low-level population of dimeric species at *9 S, as well as trimeric traces at *11-12 S. d Tikhonov-Phillips regularization applied to produce the most parsimonious size-and-shape distribution of all that fit the data statistically indistinguishably well at a P = 0.95 confidence level (i.e., that produce a rmsd value of 0.00677 OD or better) c typical series of peaks in 1c, and in a smooth relatively uniform distribution after regularization in 1d.

Specifically, the authors (Brookes et al. 2009 ) estimate the memory needs for modeling a set of M = 50-100 sedimentation velocity scans with typically N = 500-800 data points each by only a low-resolution 10 9 10 (S 9 F) grid.

In typical high-speed SV experiments with eight-hole rotors, we can acquire usually only 50 scans or fewer before depletion occurs and/or migration and backdiffusion approach steady state, even with small solutes. This is sufficient for a highly detailed analysis of multicomponent systems, as discussed by Balbo et al. (2005) . Predicted values v(s i , f r, j , r n , t m ) need to be calculated for each species (s i , f r, j ) with arrays of the same size as the data a(r n , t m ). Since the experimental data have a precision not better than four decimal places, their representation as a standard 32-bit floating-point data type with eight significant figures is already wasteful. Nevertheless, calculating conservatively with 32-bit floats we arrive at a memory requirement of only *4.8 MB for storage of model data, rather than 0.5 GB [250 9 50 9 10 9 10 9 4 bytes 9 (1,048,576 bytes/MB) -1 = 4.76 MB]. With interference optical (IF) data, the native radial density of points is higher (*1,500 per scan). Since the radial density of points of interference scans is not exploited experimentally, it could be safely reduced to the level of absorbance data by preaveraging, which reduces the statistical noise approximately by a factor of 2. However, again calculating conservatively and using the native resolution of IF data, this would lead to *28 MB storage space, or *57 MB if 100 scans were used to represent the evolution in a SV experiment.",

Figure 3 shows the results of fitting the same data as shown in Fig. 1 with a 10 9 10 grid under otherwise identical conditions. The deviations are \u00b110% of the maximum signal, and clearly this model does not even qualitatively describe the data well. As a consequence, we cannot assume that the distribution obtained from this model reflects in any way the species present in the experiment. (It is grossly different, for example, from the distribution shown in Fig. 1c, d. ) Brookes et al. (2009) recognize that such a fit is insufficient and consistently attribute the idea of using 10 9 10 grids to Brown and Schuck. For example, the authors state ''\u2026a 10 9 10 grid as proposed by Brown and Schuck a Experimental data, with the color temperature blue to red indicating the temporal evolution of the sedimentation, as in Fig. 1 . Shown as black lines are the best-fit distributions with the 10 9 10 grid distribution model, ranging from f r -values of 1.0 to 2.5 in ten equidistant steps, and from s-values of 0.1 to 15.0 S in ten equidistant steps. b Residuals bitmap and overlay.

Whenever using linear elements for the finite-element solution, an obligatory error is the approximation of the true boundary shape by piecewise linear segments. This is illustrated here for a system chosen as model system by Cao and Demeler (2005, compare Fig. 8b) , with s = 10 S and D = 2 9 10 -7 cm 2 /s, for which very accurate Lamm equation solutions were calculated with a very fine discretization (black thin line). If the radial range from meniscus to bottom is divided evenly in a set of only 100 radial points and the boundary shape is approximated by piecewise linear segments (red line, residuals shown in enhanced scale in the graph below), very large deviations occur, even if at these points the correct Lamm equation solutions were calculated. For an even division with 200 radial points (blue) the obligatory errors are smaller but still approximately ten times the experimental noise. Grids with 100 radial points were proposed by Cao and Demeler (2005) , leading for samples at unit concentration to maximum errors far exceeding the experimental noise. As shown by Brown and Schuck (2008) , the minimum number of radial points that for this system allow for this obligate error to be \\0.001 is *300, based on an optimized nonequidistant spacing of radial points (using high density where boundaries are steep) (2006) is insufficient to reliably describe the experimental parameter space. If the actual solute is not aligned with a grid point, false positives are produced,'' and even declare the second major point in their results as ''A 10 9 10 grid suggested by Brown and Schuck (2006) is clearly insuffi-cient\u2026,'' and state in the summary ''We have shown that low resolution grids as proposed by Brown and Schuck (2006) are insufficient to obtain reliable information.'' This attribution is not based on reality. Unmistakably, we have used in the referenced work (Brown and Schuck 2006) exclusively high-resolution grids (11 9 100 in Fig. 1 and 2, 12 9 60 in Fig. 3, 15 9 50 in Fig. 4, 13 9 100 in Fig. 5, 11 9 100 in Fig. 6 , and finally 13 9 50 in Fig. 7) , all of which are shown to describe the data well to within the noise of data acquisition (Brown and Schuck 2006) , and similar is true for other published applications of the method by other laboratories and by us. Thus, the idea of using 10 9 10 grids is entirely a product of the Demeler laboratory, and, to our knowledge, first described in the Brookes et al. (2009) paper.",

The details are not entirely clear, but there are two key ideas: (I) The coarse grids are translated relative to each other multiple times by increments D 2 s and D 2 f r , and their results are joined. (II) The joined set of grid points with inactive nonnegativity constraints from (I) is used to form a new, second-stage irregular grid of similarly low number of grid points as the initial grid. 4 The Demeler scheme of repeat application of different coarse subgrids, storage, and combination of their results, is termed a ''divide-and-conquer'' strategy. Divide-and-conquer algorithms are well-known tools in numerical mathematics that facilitate the use of parallel computation to solve problems, such as singular value decomposition (Arbenz and Golub 1988; Gu and Eisenstat 1995; Xu and Qiao 2008) .

Following the idea of the Demeler laboratory that low-resolution subgrids can be ''refined into a grid of any desired resolution'' through their combination scheme, let us consider that putative final regular high-resolution grid, which would have mesh size Ds = D 2 s and Df r = D 2 f r . As shown above, one can actually solve the size-and-shape distribution problem directly using the standard algorithm with this full-sized high-resolution grid with even mesh size, via the normal equation (5) with the K 9 K matrix P and K 9 1 vector d, where K is the total number of species of the two-dimensional grid. In our example of Fig. 1 , K = 1,000 for the 10 9 100 grid that is of sufficient resolution to describe all aspects of the experiment. Now going backwards, one may consider our high-resolution grid to be represented by a total of C different equal-sized subgrids, each referenced with index c (e.g., ten grids of 10 9 10 resolution), such that merging all grid points of the subgrids produces the high-resolution grid. For each subgrid, one can solve the distribution with the normal matrix method, and it is easy to show that the relevant matrix equations are P \u00f0c\u00de c \u00f0c\u00de \u00bc d \u00f0c\u00de ; where P \u00f0c\u00de are square submatrices of P of size (K/C) 9 (K/C) and d \u00f0c\u00de are subvectors of d of size 1 9 (K/C). One can use a nomenclature for the elements of the high-resolution grid such that the points are ordered in sequence of the low-resolution subgrids.",

Demeler and colleagues construct from the points with nonzero concentration values in the concatenated partial solutions (or a subset thereof) a new grid, conceived to be equal in size to the original low-resolution grids, but now with uneven spacing of the grid points. Again, we can analyze this approach best by comparison with the full, high-resolution grid with the full matrix P, where the unambiguous best-fit nonnegative solution is found exactly with the proven NNLS algorithm (Lawson and Hanson 1974) . The ad hoc exclusion of grid points that did not produce positive concentration values in any of the subgrids is in direct conflict with NNLS. Nothing guarantees that the (s, f r )-values populated in the exact solution will be correctly recognized as populated species (be assigned nonzero values) in the fit with the low-resolution grid of which they are a part. The points populated in the exact solution may therefore simply not be part of the second-stage grid.",

All the dots (red and blue) are the positive solution components of the exact high-resolution solution. They are colored blue if they coincide with a cross, i.e., have been correctly identified in the first stage as being part of the solution, and they are colored red if they were never part of any low-resolution fit and were therefore excluded from the second-stage grid. If the analysis proceeds with the second-stage grid (i.e., preconstraining the analysis to the values indicated by crosses in Fig. 5d) , we arrive at the solution shown in Fig. 5c . This is very different from the true high-resolution solution shown in Fig. 5a . Thus, the second stage cannot correct for the errors that occur from a na\u00efve subdivision of grids in (I).

P is symmetrical and has 1,000 9 1,000 values, plotted here by row and column numbers as indicated in the abscissa and ordinate of the picture, and the values P kl j j are plotted using the color scale. In principle, the nomenclature indexing the 10 9 100 grid points for the f r 9 s grid to form the vector of 1,000 parameters is arbitrary. a Here, all grid points are sorted by increasing s-value, i.e., (s 1 , f r,1 ), (s 1 , f r,2 ),\u2026(s 1 , f r,10 ), (s 2 , f r,1 ),\u2026(s 2 , f r,10 ),\u2026(s 100 , f r,10 ). As can be discerned from the smooth appearance, the matrix elements are not strongly dependent on the f r -value. b The same matrix can be reordered to reflect subdivision along ten regular subgrids c, each of the form (s 10(c-1)?1 , f r,1 ), (s 10(c-1)?1 , f r,2 ),\u2026(s 10(c-1)?1 , f r,10 ), (s 10(c-1)?2 , f r,1 ), (s 10(c-1)?2 , f r,2 ),\u2026(s 10(c-1)?2 , f r,10 ),\u2026(s 10(c-1)?10 , f r,1 ), (s 10(c-1)?10 , f r,2 ),\u2026 (s 10(c-1)?10 , f r,10 ) with c = 1\u202610. Each of the subgrids represents an evenly spaced 10 9 10 grid with origin shifted by D 2 s = 0.1505 S. c The idea that one could determine a high-resolution size-and-shape distribution from merging the results obtained separately in fits with subgrids corresponds to the assumption that there be no correlation between points from the different grids, i.e., that P can be subdivided into the ten submatrices P (c) . For the present data, this corresponds to the solution of the problem with a normal matrix as shown in c. Clearly, this is very different from the true matrix shown in b b Eur Biophys J (2010) 39: 1261-1275 1269 Brookes mentions multiple stages of the sequence (I) and (II) with different mesh sizes D 2 s and D 2 f r , and an ''iterative refinement'' of the procedure that utilizes in stage (I) the coarse starting grids that have been extended with populated points from the results of stage (II) of the previous iteration (Brookes et al. 2009 ). The same fundamental concerns apply to this iteration. To the extent that the results from (II) may not contain the grid points of the exact solution, it is unclear how the inclusion of these additional grid points would aid in the recognition of the correct solution. Even if the added grid points in (I) do represent part of the correct solution, it is not certain that they would be correctly maintained as part of the solution after (II). Empirically, the Demeler laboratory reports convergence of this iteration series in the absence, but not in the presence, of systematic noise corrections to the data (Brookes et al. 2006) . Even if the iteration does converge, it is unclear whether it is convergent to the correct solution.",

In fact, Brookes et al. (2009) express the view that the fit of c(s, f r ) with a high-resolution grid in conjunction with regularization suffers from ''lack of resolution,'' and ''produces unnecessarily broad molecular weight distributions.''

One example for the low-resolution grid analysis is shown in Fig. 3 . All low-resolution grids are chosen such that they are evenly spaced subgrids of the high-resolution grid, and such that, by joining the grid points of (f r , s)-values of all the low-resolution grids, the high-resolution grid of a is obtained. c A new grid is defined in stage (II) by joining all grid points from the entire sequence of lowresolution grids that yielded positive contributions to the fit. This is the set of grid points for which b displays nonzero populations of the distribution. In a secondary analysis, a fit to this irregular grid is performed, and the results are shown as a contour plot. Although the smallest differences Ds and Df r in this secondary grid are the same as those of the high-resolution grid, it considers only a small subset of the points from the high-resolution grid. This causes the deviations from the exact results in a and those in c. d Illustration of the grid points used in c, showing as black crosses all points that yielded positive contributions in any of the first-stage low-resolution fits. For comparison, solid circles are the grid points that make positive contributions in the exact direct high-resolution analysis of a. Blue circles indicate those that coincide with grid points in the Demeler scheme, and red circles indicate those that are populated in the exact solution but not found in the grid of the Demeler scheme knowledge about the sharpness of the expected c(s, f r ) peaks is available, this can be inserted with a Bayesian refinement of the Tikhonov regularization as we have reported for SV analysis (Brown et al. 2007 ) and implemented in SEDFIT.",

Fifty iterations were performed by the Demeler laboratory in order to determine 95% confidence intervals. This seems to be an unusually low number of iterations, in particular since the high confidence limits require estimating the quantiles of rare events, in this case the 2.5 and 97.5 percentiles. With 50 iterations, they are determined by the extreme 1.25 occurrences of parameter values, which makes these estimates of the confidence intervals quite variable statistical quantities themselves. As is well known, usually the number of Monte Carlo iterations required to produce meaningful results is typically on the order of 1,000-10,000. However, it seems this would lead to excessive computational effort, several orders of magnitude more costly than the Tikhonov regularization in the standard approach with the full high-resolution grid, which requires for our standard example only a few seconds on our PC.",

The concept of a statistical distribution of parameter values should be confused neither with the real population distribution of coexisting species in the sample mixture nor the estimate of the latter in the form of a calculated sizeand-shape distribution. Nevertheless, one could ask to what extent one can rely on the statistical nature of the noise in the data, in combination with noise amplification, to produce a parsimonious two-dimensional histogram of (s, f r )species populations. As an example, we compare in Fig. 6 the standard analysis of our model data with the 10 9 100 grid and Tikhonov regularization (6a) with the histogram of all distributions from 50 Monte Carlo iterations (each based on an exact standard fit with the 10 9 100 grid; 6b). After 50 iterations the histogram clearly shows multimodal and spiky behavior suggesting the presence of multiple species, in contrast to the single broad peak representing the smoothest solution of all that fit the originally measured data. Thus, the 50 Monte Carlo iterations do not provide an effective means to correctly identify the information content of the data. If, on the other hand, we are independently knowledgeable about the monodisperse nature of the sample, we can use the Bayesian approach (Brown et al. 2007 ) to calculate the size-and-shape distribution that is closest to a single peak, and these results are shown, for comparison, in Fig. 6c .",

We have compared this with the standard approach that is well established for solving illposed integral equations problems in many fields, which rests on well-established linear algebra and related numerical tools of linear least-squares analysis. Contrary to the assertion of Brookes, Cao, and Demeler, the application of the standard approach to the size-and-shape distribution problem is quite feasible on ordinary laboratory computers within only a few minutes of computation time, even when using high-resolution grids suitable to fully extract the experimental information content. As implemented in SEDFIT, this approach is being applied in many laboratories (Markossian et al. 2006; Chang et al. 2007; Deng et al. 2007; Race et al. 2007; Broomell et al. 2008; Brown et al. 2008; Chebotareva et al. 2008; Iseli et al. 2008; Moncrieffe et al. 2008; Paz et al. 2008; Sivakolundu et al. 2008; Wang et al. 2008; Eronina et al. 2009; Mortuza et al. 2009 ). Since this can supply exact (up to numerical precision) best-fit solutions, we have applied it to a data analysis example to serve as a reference solution in a study of the performance of different computational strategies on which 2DSA relies. This illustrates the consequences of the deviations from the established mathematical reference frame that should be expected to arise in Demeler's 2DSA approach.",

In the simplest form, this argument would be incompatible with basic matrix algebra, because it neglects cross-correlation between points from different grids. Discarding the magnitude of species' populations in this concatenated distribution, and using only the pattern of b Fig. 6 Comparison of strategies to compute parsimonious distributions that display the information content of the IgG data shown in Fig. 1 . a Contour plot of the size-and-shape distribution obtained with the high-resolution grid of 10 9 100 (f r , s)-values, after application of Tikhonov regularization, as shown in Fig. 1d . b The sum of 50 sizeand-shape distributions calculated with the exact standard method using the same high-resolution grid, but each based on synthetic data sets generated from the best-fit distribution of Fig. 1 with added normally distributed noise at the same magnitude as exhibited by the experimental data. c Integration of the main 6 S peak of the size-andshape distribution as calculated in Fig. 1 allows to determine the weighted-average s-value and f r -value, which can be used in the Bayesian framework to calculate the size-and-shape distribution c d (s, f r ) (Brown et al. 2007 ) that is closest to that of a single species, within the limits imposed by the requirement to produce a fit of statistically indistinguishable quality to that shown in a. As can be discerned from the secondary peak at *6 S with low frictional ratio, a strictly monodisperse interpretation of the main peak is contradicted by the experimental data. (Note the different scales on the color bar) nonnegativity constraints from such an analysis, is in conflict with the established Lawson and Hanson algorithm NNLS. The effect of the empirical extension to multiple stages is uncertain, and may not converge. Although one could construe cases where it will certainly work (such as distributions consisting of a single species), the Demeler scheme for generating nonequidistant small grids in multiple stages appears fundamentally flawed for the general case. The strategy of sequentially applying different, equally coarse, grids is in contrast to established multigrid methods for integral equations, which provide successfully finer parameter discretization (Kress 1999) . The division of the full problem into separate subproblems to be solved in parallel, followed by merging their partial solutions, has been used successfully in some image restoration problems (Bevilacqua and Piccolomini 2000) where the image regions are known to be uncorrelated with each other due to a localized point-spread function. However, this condition is not fulfilled in the present case. In SV analysis, the cross-correlation of signals from different species can be very large. This is reflected by the fact that (1) is ill posed, and illustrated by the fact that the matrices in Fig. 4b and c are different. For a correct solution of the SV problem, the regular high-resolution grid should be considered fully and unbiased by any scheme of preselection of excluded parameter regions. The latter is quite feasible with standard algorithms and commonly available computational resources, and we note that the problem is fairly small compared with many image analysis problems of similar structure.",

An example of the lack of regularization in the 2DSA method resulting in artificial detail can be found in the data shown by Planken et al. (2008) , where a standard c(s) analysis of SV data with maximum-entropy regularization exhibits only a single broad skewed distribution [ Fig. 3c in Planken et al. (2008) ], consistent with the expected continuous size distribution of the material studied, yet the 2DSA analysis of the same data suggests the presence of more than 14 discrete peaks (at different s-values and all at similar frictional ratio) [ Fig. 4 in Planken et al. (2008) ]. The Monte Carlo approach is certainly an extremely computationally costly step, in particular if one would carry it out with statistically meaningful iteration numbers. In contrast, application of the standard Tikhonov regularization to the full highresolution problem, with or without Bayesian modulation, takes a small fraction of the computational effort of the original problem, i.e., on the order of seconds on a PC.",

The authors do qualify their algorithm to be empirical, and that ''the results are not generally in exact correspondence with the original problem'' (Brookes et al. 2006) . They argue that ''[the results] can be made sufficiently close through careful use of the given heuristics'' (Brookes et al. 2006) . We are uncertain of the process referred to here, and how closeness to the exact solution would possibly be assessed without explicitly calculating the exact best-fit solution. So far Demeler and colleagues have not brought forward any proof that the distributions returned by the 2DSA method are at least close in the major attributes to the correct solution. We believe that the question of correctness of the algorithm is critical, especially since the authors invite the general application of this method, as implemented in the ULTRASCAN software, to address data analysis problems in novel biophysical and biochemical studies, rather than simple model problems with known solutions.",
