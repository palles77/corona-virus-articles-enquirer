[1] [2] [3] During laryngoscopy, although the laryngoscope handle does not come into direct contact with the patient's oral mucosa, it may become contaminated by the tip of the blade, which often touches the handle when the blade is folded. The handle can also be contaminated by the clinician's gloves. 4 Microorganisms can then be transmitted to subsequent patients when the anesthesia provider's gloves touch a contaminated handle before intubation. Studies have shown that contamination of laryngoscope handles with blood and microorganisms is common. [5] [6] [7] For example, Simmons 8 found drug-resistant organisms on 45% of the laryngoscope handles that were cultured. Despite these findings, the American Society of Anesthesiologists offers no guidelines for disinfection or sterilization of laryngoscope handles. However, the Australian and New Zealand College of Anesthetists' policy on infection control in anesthesia specifically states that laryngoscope handles should be decontaminated between uses. * Furthermore, a recent article in Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology called for standardization of inconsistent guidelines for cleaning laryngoscope handles and recommended high-level disinfection of both laryngoscope handles and blades. 9 Although our institution has no specific guidelines for the decontamination of laryngoscope handles, our anesthesia technicians are instructed to wipe handles between uses. These technicians use either 3M HB Quat Disinfectant Cleaner (3M, St. Paul, MN), which is a rinse-free hospital germicide registered with the Environmental Protection Agency for disinfecting and cleaning noncritical items, or Caviwipes \u2122 , which are disposable towels that come pretreated with diisobutyl-phenoxy-ethoxy-ethyl-dimethyl-benzyl ammonium chloride (0.29%) and isopropanol (17.2%) (Metrex Research Corporation, Romulus, MI). Both of these cleaning methods are considered to provide low-level disinfection.",

Also of interest, the first 12 handles cultured showed a median bacterial growth quantity of 2+ (few), whereas the remaining 28 handles showed a median bacterial growth quantity of 1+ (rare) on agar media. On the basis of these observations, we speculated that anesthesia technicians responsible for room turnover quickly improved their cleaning techniques as they discovered the intent of our study.

            "text": "Our study was limited by the fact that we did not sample other surfaces that the anesthesiologist may routinely touch shortly after performing laryngoscopy. Loftus et al. 10 have recently published such a study examining bacterial contamination of the anesthesia work area, including the agent flowmeter dial and the adjustable pressure-limiting valve complex. These authors reported that bacterial contamination of these sites increased significantly between the beginning and the conclusion of the case. Furthermore, transmission of bacterial organisms to IV stopcock sets occurred in 32% of cases, and such contamination was associated with a trend toward increased nosocomial infection rates and increased risk of mortality. 10 Other limitations include the fact that we did not purchase new laryngoscope handles nor did we pre-sterilize our handles before beginning the study period. However, our study does provide \"real-world\" data suggesting that low-level disinfection of laryngoscope handles is effective in eliminating drug-resistant nosocomial aerobic bacteria and common respiratory viruses. Nevertheless, we did note a high incidence of handle contamination with organisms consistent with skin or oral flora. It is unknown whether diligent attention to more thorough application of the germicidal solution (greater attention to covering the entire surface area or longer duration of cleaning time) would affect colony counts. Furthermore, it is unknown whether high-level disinfection (i.e., sterilization) would eliminate these bacteria. Another limitation of this study was the failure to use specific procedures for the detection of mycobacteria, slow-growing molds, and mycoplasmas. Therefore, further studies comparing the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of low-level versus high-level disinfection of these devices may be warranted. Some experts advocate high-level disinfection (sterilization) of the laryngoscope handle, as well as the blade, whether or not a protective barrier or a sheath was used during the procedure. 9 Our data support, at a minimum, standard guidelines that include thorough lowlevel disinfection of laryngoscope handles. Arguably, professional organizations such as the American Society of Anesthesiologists should develop a consensus statement about the disinfection of laryngoscope handles between uses. 9, 11, 12 ",
