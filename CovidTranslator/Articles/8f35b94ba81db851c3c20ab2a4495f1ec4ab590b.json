Here we demonstrate a novel organelle source of replication membranes for human rhinovirus 1A (HRV-1A). HRV-1A infection induces fragmentation of the Golgi apparatus, and Golgi membranes are rearranged into vesicles of approximately 250-500 nm diameter. The newly distributed Golgi membranes co-localize with viral RNA replication templates, strongly suggesting that the observed vesicles are the sites of viral RNA replication. Expression of the HRV-1A 3A protein induces alterations in the Golgi staining pattern similar to those seen during viral infection, and expressed 3A localizes to the Golgiderived membranes. Taken together, these data show that in HRV-1A infection, the 3A protein plays a role in fragmenting the Golgi complex and generating vesicles that are used as the site of viral RNA replication.",

SARS virus, a coronavirus, replicates on a reticulovesicular network derived from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (Knoops et al., 2008) . The flavivirus Hepatitis C Virus performs RNA replication on a \"membranous web\" thought to be derived from ER membranes and lipid droplets (Tang and Grise, 2009 ). Semliki Forest Virus, an alphavirus, replicates on cytopathic vesicles thought to be derived from endosomes and lysosomes (Salonen et al., 2003; Spuul et al., 2007) .

Previously, we demonstrated that poliovirus induces autophagosome-like double-membraned vesicles, and that these vesicles are the sites of RNA replication (Jackson et al., 2005) . Other viruses use the autophagic machinery to enhance viral replication, including Dengue Fever Virus, Hepatitis C Virus, Coxsackie B3 Virus, and the rhinoviruses HRV-2 and HRV-14 (Ait-Goughoulte et al., 2008; Dreux et al., 2009; Jackson et al., 2005; Khakpoor et al., 2009; Lee et al., 2008; Sir et al., 2008; Wong et al., 2008) . Not all viruses use the autophagy machinery in the same way. For example, Hepatitis C virus replication membranes do not look like conventional autophagosomes, although the autophagosomal machinery is important for initiating viral replication (Dreux et al., 2009; Moradpour et al., 2003) .",

Markers for COPII co-localize with the viral replication protein 2B on vesicles that appear to bud from the ER. However, several lines of evidence argue against the COPII hypothesis, including the sensitivity of poliovirus to Brefeldin A, which inhibits COPI but not COPII vesicle formation (Gazina et al., 2002; Maynell et al., 1992) . In addition, poliovirus replication is not inhibited by expression of a dominant-negative allele of the COPII protein Sar1, which blocks anterograde transport (Taylor, 2007) . Nonetheless, the COPII hypothesis may be compatible with the autophagy hypothesis, as COPII components have been shown to be important for autophagy in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Hamasaki et al., 2003; Ishihara et al., 2001) .",

We show that, unlike poliovirus, HRV-1A does not induce or respond to the autophagic pathway. In addition, we provide evidence that during HRV-1A infection, the Golgi is fragmented into vesicles that appear to be used as a substrate for viral RNA replication. Finally, we show that expression of the HRV-1A 3A protein induces changes in Golgi staining reminiscent of the changes during HRV-1A infection, and that the 3A protein co-localizes with the fragmented Golgi signal. These data, taken together, indicate that HRV-1A uses the Golgi apparatus as a source of RNA replication vesicles.",

Here we extend our studies on viruses and autophagy to another cloned rhinovirus strain, HRV-1A. Background levels of autophagy vary from cell line to cell line, so for these assays we used 293T human embryonic kidney cells, which have a low background level of autophagy (Tanida et al., 2005) . The best marker for autophagosome formation is the microtubuleassociated light chain 3 (MAP-LC3, also known as hATG8 or LC3) protein, which is required for generating nascent autophagic membranes (Klionsky et al., 2008) . As autophagic signaling is induced, cellular pools of LC3 become lipidated and associated with autophagosome membranes. Cytoplasmic GFP-LC3 indicates low levels of autophagy, while punctate LC3 signal indicates increased membrane association of LC3 on autophagosomes (Klionsky et al., 2008) .",

For each condition, three replicate samples of at least 100 transfected cells each were counted under double-blinded conditions. LC3 signal was scored as punctate or non-punctate. Some representative images are depicted in Fig. 1A . Double-blinded quantitation of these images, in which cells were scored as punctate or non-punctate, is shown in Fig. 1B . The mock-infected cells demonstrated low, intrinsic levels of LC3 puncta, and HRV-1A-infected cells have equivalent levels. However, in PV-infected and rapamycintreated cells, approximately half of the population displayed LC3 puncta, an increase in puncta formation similar to that seen previously for PV (Taylor et al., 2009 ).

Instead, the Giantin staining in these cells is disjointed and fragmented, with puncta and small oval-shaped structures spread throughout the cell. To confirm that this effect was related to infection, we co-stained for Giantin (red) and an antibody to detect the HRV-1A capsid (green).

Mock-infected cells did not stain with capsid antibody, and the Golgi appeared normal (Fig. 2 , bottom row). All cells in the infected population stained with capsid antibody, and in these cells Giantin signal was abnormal, often appearing as punctae throughout the cytoplasm.

At 24 h.p.i., we observed a redistribution of both Golgi markers.

The ultrastructure of cells infected with HRV-1A for 24 h is distinct from that of uninfected cells. Elongated stacks of membranes are rarely seen, and when they are, they are disorganized (open white arrowheads). In HRV-1A infected cells, these stacks are not ordered, while similar stacks visible in mock-infected cells are regularly spaced and ordered. HRV-1A-infected cells also displayed larger, darkstaining, ovoid vesicles of approximately 250-500 nM in diameter. These vesicles, whose contents appear more electron dense than the surrounding cytoplasm, can be seen throughout the cytoplasm of infected cells. We do not observe structures in HRV-1A-infected cells that have the size or characteristics of autophagosomes or autolysosomes.

We were interested in determining the effect of HRV-1A 3A protein expression as well as its localization within cells. Lentivirus-based constructs, which express both the protein of interest and GFP, were generated with two versions of HRV-1A 3A. One has an HA antigenic tag on the C-terminus, and the other is untagged. WI-38 cells were infected and observed until GFP expression was visible (A,E,I) then fixed and stained for Giantin (B,F,J) and HA (C,G,K). Production of 3Aexpressing lentivirus was not robust; in order to detect expression, we needed to concentrate lentivirus by centrifugation. Even after concentration, not every cell in our target cultures received lentivirus. We presume that the low production of lentivirus is due to the known toxicity of the 3A protein, since we did not have this problem with lentiviruses that did not express 3A (Lama et al., 1992) . However, this allows for internal controls in each experiment. We have provided fields that contain cells with and without lentivirus expression for direct comparison (Fig. 8) .",

The novel finding about HRV-1A genomic RNA replication is the source of the replication membranes. A redistribution of the Golgi marker Giantin takes place during infection, resulting in a condensation of the signal into a perinuclear region, followed by puncta scattered throughout the cell. Negative- stranded viral RNA, an intermediate in viral replication, also colocalizes with a Golgi marker, indicating that viral RNA replication occurs in association with fragmented Golgi membranes. Our electron microscopy images (Fig. 6 ) of HRV-1A infected cells reveals the presence of electron-dense vesicles of approximately 250-500 nm in diameter. These vesicles, which appear to be multilamellar, are not visible in mock-infected WI-38 cells. In our observations of at least 100 cells, there is a correlation between the appearance of the electron-dense vesicles and the disorganization of Golgi-like stacks in infected cells, although it is difficult to identify a \"Golgi-like stack\" given the disorganized nature of membranes in HRV-1A infected cells (Fig. 5) . Our immunostained EM images (Fig. 7) show Giantin staining on vesicles of approximately 500 nm as well. Although the Giantin-stained vesicles are not electron dense, we believe that extraction of vesicle contents may be the result of preparation for immunostaining. Therefore, they are likely the same 500-nm vesicles seen in conventional EM.",

Since a Golgi marker also co-localizes with negative-strand viral RNA (Fig. 5) we believe that the electron-dense vesicles in Fig. 6 likely represent the sites of viral replication. Our model, unique to HRV-1A of viruses studied, is that the Golgi fragments into vesicles that serve as substrates for viral replication. It has been reported that poliovirus causes fragmentation of the Golgi during late infection, but that these membranes are not the sites of viral replication. (Beske et al., 2007) . At 24 h of a PV infection of WI-38 cells, we do not observe Golgi fragmentation. Foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) forms replication sites near the Golgi apparatus, but Golgi markers are specifically excluded from the replication membranes (Knox et al., 2005) . Therefore, this study marks the first demonstration, to our knowledge, that the Golgi provides replication membranes to a positive-strand RNA virus.",

            "text": "For insight into the possible mechanisms by which HRV-1A hijacks Golgi membranes for replication, we have considered some known pathways of Golgi fragmentation. For example, Brefeldin A, which targets the ARF1 GTPase, can induce Golgi fragmentation. The effect of Brefeldin A on the Golgi is morphologically similar to that of HRV-1A infection (Hidalgo et al., 1992; Radulescu et al., 2007) . PV replication is extremely sensitive to Brefeldin A treatment, suggesting that ARF1 function is important to the virus (Kirkegaard, 1992) . Other picornaviruses vary in their sensitivity to Brefeldin A (Gazina et al., 2002) . ARF1 plays key roles in membrane trafficking and has been implicated in Golgi fragmentation during both mitosis and nocodazole treatment (Bui et al., 2009; Tang et al., 2008) . Guanine exchange factors (GEFs) for ARF1 are recruited to poliovirus membranes by two different poliovirus proteins (Belov et al., 2007) . GBF1, an ARF1 GEF recruited by poliovirus 3A, is also recruited by the 3A protein of another picornavirus, Coxsackievirus B3 (Wessels et al., 2006) . However, the 3A proteins from HRV-2 and HRV-14 do not recruit GBF1 to replication membranes, indicating that this is not universal among picornaviruses (Wessels et al., 2006) . We have found that HRV-1A replication is extremely sensitive to Brefeldin A1. (Data not shown). These data indicate that the importance of ARF1 in picornavirus replication is independent of the organelle source of the viral replication membrane. The picornavirus 3A transmembrane protein is involved in organelle rearrangements to generate replication membranes. In this study we show that HRV-1A 3A can be expressed in isolation to induce rearrangements of a Golgi marker within cells. In addition, an epitope-tagged version co-localizes with the Golgi signal. These data, along with our FISH data (Fig. 5) , lead us to the model that HRV-1A replicates its RNA in association with Golgi-derived vesicles, and that the 3A protein plays a role in generating these replication membranes. The effect of picornavirus 3A proteins on the Golgi is distinct depending on the viral origin of the protein. When expressed in isolation, poliovirus 3A localizes to the ER and induces swelling and distension of that organelle, but no effects on the Golgi complex were reported (Doedens et al., 1997; Suhy et al., 2000) . Another group demonstrated that expression of poliovirus 3A is capable of dispersing the Golgi. The same study showed that myc-tagged 3A proteins from Coxsackievirus B3, HRV-2, and HRV-14 localize to the Golgi complex when expressed in cells (Wessels et al., 2006) . Coxsackievirus B3 3A protein can fragment the Golgi as well (Cornell et al., 2006) .",

Viral stocks were produced in H1-HeLa cells by transfection of in vitro transcribed RNAs as described previously (Maynell et al., 1992; Racaniello, 1984) . Virus was diluted in PBS with 0.01% CaCl 2 , 0.01% MgCl 2 and cell absorption was carried out for 30-45 min at 37\u00b0C before addition of media. Stocks were titered by plaque assay on H1-HeLa cells or TCID 50 assay on 293T and WI-38 cells. 293T cells were transfected using Effectene (Invitrogen) according to manufacturer's instructions. Plasmid was first diluted 1:5 with empty vector to reduce expression levels. The GFP-LC3 plasmid has been described previously and is available from AddGene (www.addgene.org, plasmid 11546) (Jackson et al., 2005) . Lentivirus plasmids were provided by Dr. Richard Mulligan (Mostoslavsky et al., 2006) . Tamoxifen (Sigma) and rapamycin (LC Labs) were dissolved in a 1:1 solution of DMSO:EtOH. 3-methyladenine (Sigma) was dissolved directly into media.",
