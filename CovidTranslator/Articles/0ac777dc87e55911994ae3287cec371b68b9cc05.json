A novel autoregulatory mechanism enables modulation of frameshiffing according to the cellular concentration of polyamines. Antizyme binds to, and destabilizes, ornithine decarboxylase, a key enzyme in polyamine synthesis. Rapid degradation ensues, thus completing a regulatory circuit. In vitro experiments with a fusion construct using reticu-Iocyte lysates demonstrate polyamine-dependent expression with a frameshift efficiency of 19% at the optimal concentration of spermidine. The frameshift is +1 and occurs at the codon just preceding the terminator of the initiating frame. Both the termination codon of the initiating frame and a pseudoknot downstream in the mRNA have a stimulatory effect. The shift site sequence, UCC-UGA-U, is not similar to other known frameshift sites. The mechanism does not seem to involve re-pairing of peptidyl-tRNA in the new frame but rather reading or occlusion of a fourth base.",

This programmed ribosomal frameshifting constitutes an important part of recoding or reprogrammed genetic decoding (Gesteland et al., 1992) . Programmed frameshifting is well known in the decoding of compact genomes such as retrotransposons and bacterial, yeast, plant, and animal viruses (especially retroviruses), but only a few cases are known in cellular genes. The classic case of the latter is the autoregulatory frameshifting involved in decoding the Escherichia coli release factor 2 (RF2) gene (Craigen and Caskey, 1986; Weiss et al., 1987; Curran and Yarus, 1988) . Until now, programmed frameshifting was unknown in decoding animal genes. We describe the autoregulatory involvement of frameshifting in decoding mammalian antizyme and show that not only is the frameshifting different from that used by mammalian viruses, it is distinct from all other known types of frameshifting.",

            "text": "Antizyme is a polyamine-inducible protein that binds to, and inhibits, ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) (reviewed by Hayashi and Canellakis, 1989) . ODC is a key enzyme for polyamine biosynthesis in animal cells (reviewed by Pegg, 1986) . It converts ornithine to a diamine, putrescine, which in turn leads to spermidine and spermine. ODC has the fastest turnover rate of any mammalian enzyme, with a half-life of 10-60 min (Russell and Snyder, 1969) . Elevation of cellular polyamine levels accelerates degradation of ODC (Hayashi, 1989) , and early results suggested that antizyme is essential in this process . This was confirmed by using antizyme expressed from a cDNA clone (Murakami et al., 1992a (Murakami et al., , 1992b , and the degradation was shown to be catalyzed by 26S proteasome without ubiquitination (Murakami et al., 1992c; Tokunaga et al., 1994) . The C-terminal half of antizyme binds to ODC, inducing a conformational change (Li and Coffino, 1993) , allowing an additional internal sequence in antizyme to promote destabilization of ODC (Li and Coffino, 1994; Ichiba et al., 1994) . Consequently, ODC is not only short-lived like other proteins that control important cellular processes (Goldberg and St. John, 1976) , but its turnover is also regulated. Though mechanistically distinct, the induced destabilization by antizyme is analogous to that of human papillomavirus oncoprotein E6 action on the tumor suppressor p53 (Scheffner et al., 1990) . Antizyme has a second function: it also represses polyamine uptake, thereby enabling sharper shutdown of polyamine accumulation in cells (Mitchell et al., 1994; Suzuki et al., 1994) .",

This preparation of reticulocyte lysate endogenously contained 0.36 mM spermidine and 0.03 mM spermine as final concentrations for translation.

In contrast, translation of the in-frame mRNA was efficient even at low spermidine concentrations and was somewhat suppressed by increasing concentrations of spermidine. This inhibition is nonspecific, as translation of albumin mRNA shows the same effect. Spermine and putrescine also stimulated synthesis of antizyme from wild-type mRNA, with optimal concentrations of 0.12 mM and 4 mM, respectively, whereas magnesium (1-4 mM) did not show the effect (data not shown).

Ribosomes initiate at the BMV AUG and terminate at the ORF1 UGA to make a protein of 257 amino acid residues and a mass of 27,832 Da. If they switch to the +1 frame ORF2, they will make a full-length product of 416 amino acids with an approximate mass of 46 kDa (the exact mass will depend on where the shift in frame occurs, since this will change the amino acid composition). As shown in Figure  2E (WT, no immunoprecipitation), two products of the anticipated sizes were synthesized from mRNA of this fusion construct. The larger protein was the same size as the main product of the in-frame control ( Figure 2E, IN) . Both products in the wild-type fusion construct were immuno- precipitated with anti-BMV antiserum, and only the larger product reacted with the antibody specific to ORF2 of antizyme ( Figure 2E , center). These results ensure that the full-length product of the wild-type fusion is translated from two different reading frames and strongly suggest frameshifting into the +1 frame. The efficiency of the shift can be determined from the ratio of radioactivity of the terminated and full-length products after calibrating the numbers of amino acid residues labeled in the two products. Spermidine has a nonspecific inhibitory effect on translation, so it is necessary to normalize the results to the total translation observed. The absolute amount of the frameshift product did not increase significantly and even decreased with higher concentrations of spermidine. After normalization, the shift efficiencies were 5.4% without polyamine addition and 19.0% with addition of 0.6 mM spermidine. (There is variability in the quantitative polyamine stimulation, probably reflecting differences in reticulocyte lysates and the nature of the 5' sequences in the mRNA. More experiments are needed to clarify these issues.)",

RNA was made in vitro from a construct with the last four codons of ORF1 (to nucleotide 268, which includes the presumed shift site and all the downstream sequence necessary for the efficient frameshifting as shown below) flanked by two cassettes specifying recognition sites for the factor Xa protease, which cleaves on the C-terminal side of Ile-Glu-Gly-Arg, The 5' factor Xa site was positioned such that three amino acids remain from ORF1 after cleavage (Figure 3A) . The 3' cleavage site was positioned to reduce the size of peptide to be sequenced, thereby minimizing the background during Edman degradation. The mRNA was translated in a reticulocyte lysate in the presence of both [35S]cysteine and [3H]proline and, in a separate experiment, [3H]serine. The frameshift products together with the termination product were purified by glutathione-Sepharose column chromatography and digested with factor Xa. The transframe peptides were then isolated with reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography and subjected to automated Edman degradation ( Figure  3B ). Cysteine was found in cycle 2, serine at cycle 3, and proline in cycles 6, 8, 9, and 13, to give the sequence X-Cys-Ser-X-X-Pro-X-Pro-Pro-X-X-X-Pro. Factor Xa cleavage at arginine is predicted to leave cysteine as the second amino acid and serine as the third in the zero frame as found. The prolines at 6, 8, 9, and 13 are all predicted by the +1 reading frame, and therefore the frameshifting must be +1 but not -2 or +4, and so forth. Readthrough of the UGA terminator is ruled out, since cysteine (specified by UGU at the next position to the terminator in the zero frame) is not found in cycle 5. The reading frame must have changed either at the serine codon before the terminator or at the terminator: the later case could be achieved only if the terminator is decoded as a sense codon followed by immediate frameshifting, but this seems unlikely, as it requires two nonstandard events. We conclude that the last codon of ORF1, UCC, is the site of the +1 change in reading frame. While the results all point to ribosomal frameshifting, editing out of one base in the mRNA at this The wild-type (WT) sequence, separated as codons, is shown in the bottom boxes. Each nucleotide or the termination codon was mutated to ones indicated above. Translation was carried out in the reticulocyte lysate supplemented with 0.6 mM spermidine. Frameshift efficiencies relative to the wild type were calculated from data obtained by phosphorimaging, normalizing to the sum of the termination and frameshift products, taking into account the number of methionine residues. The values are averages from at least two clones. The frameshift efficiency of the wild-type construct was 17.7% -1.4o.",

The tertiary structure of a pseudoknot has a stem-loop with nucleotides of the loop region paired to nucleotides downstream of the stern to form a second stem (Pleij et al., 1985) . Antizyme mRNA sequence reveals a potential pseudoknot just 3' to the termination codon of ORF1 ( Figure 5A ), even though so far no examples of +1 frameshifting are known to be accompanied by downstream RNA structure. The downstream stimulator(s) for frameshifting was delimited by deletion of the sequence 3' of the pseudoknot with retention of full frameshift activity (Figu re 5B, A269-682). If the deletion was limited to the potential pseudoknot region (A209-268), frameshifting decreased by 60%, suggesting the presence of a stimulator in this sequence. These results combined with the 5' deletions circumscribed the essential stimutatory signals as being located within the region of nucleotides 205-268.

For the 3' side stem ($2), only two nucleotides in the stem were replaced, since chang!ng six nucleotides creates an in-frame terminator.

Fusion clones were devised to see whether this region is sufficient for specific +1 frameshifting in a foreign context. These constructs, and rearrangements of them, also test the ability of this region to promote specific -1 frameshifting and stop codon readthrough. A fragment spanning the last five codons of ORF1 and the pseudoknot (nucleotides 190-268) was cloned into a vector, pGB01 (see Experimental Procedures), between an upstream reporter, glutathione S-transferase (GST), and a downstream reporter, rabbit ~-globin ( Figure 6A ). In this construct, pGB-103, the I~-globin gene was fused to this fragment of antizyme mRNA so that shifting into the +1 frame was required for its expression. This fusion gene was transcribed with T7 RNA polymerase and translated in a reticulocyte lysate ( Figure 6B ). The 45 kDa protein that migrated with the product of an in-frame construct results from +1 frameshifting. The 27 kDa termination product corresponds to GST plus the fragment of ORF1. The 31 kDa product is of the expected size for readthrough of the ORF1 UGA terminator. However, -1 frameshifting would give an intermediate-sized protein of 28 kDa. The clone was rearranged in order to focus on -1 frameshifting and readthrough. The ~-globin gene was placed in either the zero (pG B-R01) or -1 (pG B-T01) frame with respect to the GST gene ( Figure 6B ). pGB-R01 encoded two products, a 33 kDa protein predicted from +1 frameshifting and a 45 kDa product from readthrough, pGB-T01 encoded a 31 kDa +1 product and a 33 kDa readthrough product. Neither revealed the predicted -1 frameshift product. The addition of spermidine increased the relative amounts of the frameshift and readthrough products, but with different optimal spermidine concentrations ( Figure 6B ). At 0.8 mM of added spermidine, +1 frameshifting was 9.9%, compared with 1.0% without added spermidine. For readthrough, maximal efficiency was 8.3% with 0.6 mM of added spermidine compared with 2.6% without. The 79 nt fragment of antizyme is sufficient to promote polyaminedependent, specific +1 frameshifting when transplanted to a new context, but not -1 f.-ameshifting. The fragment does, however, promote readthrough of its UGA stop codon, but this is unlikely to be of biological importance. (In the BMV coat-antizyme fusion, where the context is more similar to the natural gene, a product with the expected 30 kDa size of that derived from UGA readthrough was not detected.)",

The mechanism for regulation seems to be general: recent results indicate that the antizyme mRNAs from human and Xenopus laevis also require frameshifting for their expression (unpub- lished data). The role of this recoding is to provide an elegant autoregulatory circuit. Less is known about an additional regulatory system(s) where antizyme somehow represses a polyamine transporter (Mitchell et al., 1994; Suzuki et al., 1994) . The frameshifting stimulated by polyamines results in an increase in the amount of antizyme, which lowers intracellular polyamine levels by promoting turnover of a key enzyme in polyamine synthesis, ODC. Functional antizyme is encoded in ORF2 alone, and the role of ORF1 seems not to be for its protein product per se, but rather to provide for recoding regulation by polyamines. Cells stably transfected with ORF2 supplied with an in-frame initiator codon showed antizyme activity that was not stimulated by exogenous polyamines (Murakami et al., 1992a) . However, the relatively large size of ORF1 (depending on which AUG is used for initiation, 68 or 35 codons) makes it likely that ORF1 is doing more than just providing a ribosome start site in a different frame. In the only other case of autoregulatory frameshifting, E. coil RF2, the ORF1 is only 25 codons.",

In the antizyme case, re-pairing would require serine tRNA first to pair with UCC, then to move ahead one to CCU, where it could pair with only the last two bases. Imperfect pairs at a re-pairing position are seen in several frameshifting cases (reviewed by Atkins and Gesteland, 1995) . However, with antizyme, in vitro mutational analysis shows that re-pairing is not obligatory and with some of the mutants cannot occur. When the UCC is changed to UCG, a significant level of frameshifting (30%) was still observed ( Figure  4 ). This UCG-serine codon is decoded by other serine isoacceptors with anticodons of 3'-AGU-5' (with or without a modification of the U) or 3'-AGC-5'. Neither of these tRNAs can pair in any of their anticodon positions to the +1 frame, CGU, making re-pairing unlikely, This is further supported by results of changing UCC to ACG, where again no base pairing is possible, yet the reduction in frameshifting efficiency is only 50%. Several possible mechanisms that do not involve re-pairing are compatible with the present data and cannot yet be distinguished (of. Farabaugh et al., 1993) .",

A stop codon at the end of ORF1 is crucial, but its identity (UAA, UGA, or UAG) is less important. The preliminary evidence here supports the participation of the downstream pseudoknot shown in Figure 5A . While downstream structures have been shown to be stimulatory for -1 frameshifting and stop codon readthrough, this is the first example of involvement in +1 frameshifting, though the 2.5-fold effect is considerably less than is seen in the -1 cases. The spacing between the shift site and the pseudoknot is 5 nt. However, since the UGA codon occupies the A site when the shifting occurs, the relative spacing between the shift site and the pseudoknot is 2 nt. It is much less than the 6-9 nt usually found in -1 frameshifting and readthrough (except prokaryotic selenocysteine [Heider et al., 1992] ). However, the existence of the UA pair at the base of $1 may not be concluded from the present data. In addition, two alternative pseudoknots with different $1 can be drawn that would have spacing of 12 nt. One does not have the bottom half of $1. The other has an $1 of seven CG pairs composed of nucleotides 217-224 and 239-247, allowing three bulged-out nucleotides. However, the available data support the model shown ( Figure 5A) , with short spacing. The results of the compensatory experiments suggest that the primary sequence of the stems of the pseudoknot region may not be important, similar to the other cases of frameshifting.",

Whether the polyamine effect is specific for antizyme mRNA or perhaps for all +1 frameshifting is not known. It may be specific for +1 frameshifting, since at least with mouse mammary tumor virus gagpro -1 frameshift, no stimulation is seen (unpublished data).

Can a polyamine-specific effector sequence be delimited in the mRNA? One candidate might be the downstream pseudoknot. But constructs without the downstream region are still stimulated by spermidine. Spermidine did not have its effect through the termination codon or upstream sequences, either. This points toward polyamines having their effect through distortion of the decoding site, including perhaps the tRNA, to allow frameshifting. Whatever the detailed mechanism, it does seem remarkable that the sequences in an mRNA can set up a ribosome to respond to the concentration of small, ubiquitous molecules and alter its mode of reading the genetic code.",

The in-frame mutant lacking T205 (AT205) was produced by PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis (Higuchi et al., 1988) . A plasmid with the BMV coat protein-antizyme fusion, C3NE, was prepared as follows. The HindllI-BamHI fragment of NE was first replaced by a duplex of synthetic oligonucleotides 5'-AGCTAGATCTGAGAAGCTTGGTGAA-ATCCTCCCTGCAGCG and 5'-GATCCGCTGCAGGGAGGATTTCA-CCAAGCTTCTCAGATCT.

To introduce various mutations at the shift site or the pseudoknot region, nucleotides 191 and 257 of C3NE (numbered as in Figure 1 ) were changed by PCR mutagenesis to C and T, respectively, creating Apal and Bcll sites.

In brief, a PCR fragment containing 5' to 3', a Bglll site, T7 promoter, the GST coding region (including the downstream thrombin recognition site from pGEX-2T [Pharmacia]), and a BstEII-XhoI-KpnI-BamHI polylinker was digested with Bglll and BamHI and inserted into the BamHI site of the yeast expression vector pG-1 (Schena et al., 1991) . In this construct, pGG75, GST is transcribed from either the GPD or T7 promoter. pGB01 ( Figure 6A ) was constructed by introducing the rabbit J~-globin gene into the unique BamHI site of pGG75. The fragment was prepared by PCR on pOGl~17 (G6rlach et al., 1989 , provided by Dr. J. Schickinger via Dr. M. F. Tuite) and contained the sequence from the second codon of ~-globin through the Bglll site 3 nt downstream to the end of the ORF, with a BamHI site introduced immediately 5' of the second codon. Sequences of the antizyme frameshift window, corresponding to nucleotides 190-268, were amplified with PCR and inserted into the BstEII and Kpnl sites of pGB01 ( Figure 6A ). The antizyme sequence was flanked by two As at 5' and either GG (pGB-103, for monitoring +1/-2 frameshifting), CGG (pGB-T01, for-1 frameshifting) or G (pGS-R01, for readthrough) at 3' between the restriction sites to adjust the reading frame. For monitoring -1 frameshifting, the nucleotide corresponding to A227 (Figure 1) was also replaced by a G. This changed the in-frame UGA codon to UGG and did not affect the pseudoknot formation. The construct used for amino acid sequencing in Figure 3 , pGB-F01, is similar to pGB-103 and has an insert consisting of antizyme sequence 193-268 flanked by two oligonucleotides specifying factor Xa sites, 5'-AAATCGAAGGT at 5'and 5'-ATTGA-AGGTAGAATCGG at 3'.",
