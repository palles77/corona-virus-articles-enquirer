            "text": "Background: Acute respiratory tract infections (ARI) present a significant morbidity and pose a global health burden. Patients are frequently treated with antibiotics although ARI are most commonly caused by virus, strengthening the need for improved diagnostic methods. Objectives: Detect viral and bacterial RNA in nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPA) from children aged 6-23 months with ARI using nCounter. Study design: A custom-designed nCounter probeset containing viral and bacterial targets was tested in NPA of ARI patients. Results: Initially, spiked control viral RNAs were detectable in \u22656.25 ng input RNA, indicating absence of inhibitors in NPA. nCounter applied to a larger NPA sample (n = 61) enabled the multiplex detection of different pathogens: RNA viruses Parainfluenza virus (PIV 1-3) and RSV A-B in 21%, Human metapneumovirus (hMPV) in 5%, Bocavirus (BoV), CoV, Influenza virus (IV) A in 3% and, Rhinovirus (RV) in 2% of samples, respectively. RSV A-B was confirmed by Real Time PCR (86.2-96.9% agreement). DNA virus (AV) was detected at RNA level, reflecting viral replication, in 10% of samples. Bacterial transcripts from Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Chlamydophila pneumoniae were detected in 77, 69, 26, 8, 3 and 2% of samples, respectively. Conclusion: nCounter is robust and sensitive for the simultaneous detection of viral (both RNA and DNA) and bacterial transcripts in NPA with low RNA input (<10 ng). This medium-throughput technique will increase our understanding of ARI pathogenesis and may provide an evidence-based approach for the targeted and rational use of antibiotics in pediatric ARI.",

Preprocessing sequentially corrects for three factors: technical variation, background and sample content. First, using a set of exogenous positive control RNAs present in each sample (see also Fig. 1 ), technical variation is accounted for by adjusting the counts in each sample to the geometric mean of counts for positive control counts in all samples. Subsequently, a background correction is performed by subtracting the maximum count value of the negative control probes in a sample from each probe output within the sample. Transcripts counts that are negative after background correction are set to 1. Each sample is then normalized for RNA content by adjusting the counts to the geometric mean of 15 housekeeping genes (Supplementary Table 2 ). Finally, the data were log 2 transformed. Full details of each step can be found in the supplementary information of Waggott et al. [8] . Network data were designed by association matrix and the graph file was created using Gephi. Nodes were aligned by Force Atlas algorithm and the centrality was calculated by the betweenness. Statistical analyses were performed using Graphpad Prism version 5.0.",

            "text": "The digital nCounter profiling technology captures and counts specific nucleic acid molecules in a complex mixture [5] . Briefly, unique pairs of capture and detection probes are designed against each gene of interest. The capture probe consists of a sequence complimentary to a target pathogen mRNA and a short common sequence coupled to an affinity tag (biotin). The reporter probe also contains the complementary sequence but is coupled to a colorcoded tag, providing the detection signal. The color code in each tag is unique, allowing the accurate discrimination of the different targets, in a complex mixture. Capture and reporter probes are mixed with total RNA in a single hybridization reaction, resulting in the formation of tripartite structures (target bound to the specific reporter and capture probes). Unhybridized probes are washed away and remaining complexes are exposed to streptavidin. Tar-gets bound to the specific probes are immobilized on a solid surface that is scanned; the unique reporter probe then identifies each target and the level of expression is measured by the digital readout of transcript counts. The reaction occurs in the absence of nucleic acid amplification and/or enzymatic reactions. To estimate target concentration, nCounter uses a series of positive controls covering a range of known concentrations (0.1-100 fM, comparable to 0.2-200 copies per cell). Based on the counts obtained for these known concentrations, the concentration of mRNA transcripts can be estimated. This estimate is done by plotting the counts obtained for the positive controls versus the concentrations tested and by fitting a regression line through the average (Fig. 1) . The regression line allows the quantification of mRNA transcript concentration. The correlation between the counts for positive controls and the concentration was 0.99 and 0.98 for the lower concentration range.",

To our knowledge, this is the first description of detection of a pathogenic DNA virus (Adenovirus type 2 and 5) at the RNA level in clinical samples. In contrast to a standard DNA PCR, which quantifies DNA in (mostly extracellular) viral particles, nCounter enables demonstration of ongoing (intracellular) viral replication, which we hypothesize to be more relevant to ARI pathogenesis.

We observed a good agreement between Real-Time PCR and nCounter for RSV (A and B) detection, reinforcing the possibility of using the latter as an alternative method for pathogen detection.

There is evidence that viral respiratory infections can stimulate an increase in bacterial load and this association can lead to secondary complications [14] . Preterm infants with RSV and bacterial co-infection were hospitalized for longer periods and more frequently admitted to the intensive care unit, compared to children infected with RSV alone [15] . In our samples, the majority of ARI patients presented H. influenzae and S. aureus, which, together with S. pneumoniae and M. catarrhalis are the usual opportunistic pathogens co-detected with RSV [16] [17] [18] . Indeed, transcripts for all these agents were detected in our NPA samples from children with ARI. Network analysis showed strong links between PIV 1 and H. influenzae and between RSV B and S. pneumoniae, for example. Both S. pneumoniae [19] and RSV activate the inflammasome [20] ; S. pneumoniae triggers NF-kB activation leading to an inflammatory response whereas, RSV infection results in a strong interferon response. The possible overlap between the signaling pathways triggered by each pathogen may synergize and amplify the inflammatory signal during co-infection. This exacerbated immune response could accentuate damage in situ and increase morbidity. Given this scenario, knowing the effective pathogen load, as shown here by nCounter, can contribute towards understanding the contribution of each pathogen to disease severity. As a proof-of-principle, our group has already used nCounter to simultaneously quantify both human and retroviral transcriptomes; thus, revealing intact IFN signaling in HTLV-1 infection [21] .",

This approach, combined with long-term clinical follow-up, will increase our understanding of ARI pathogenesis, disease progression (wheez- ing, asthma) and, more importantly, provide an evidence-based approach for the targeted and rational use of antibiotics in pediatric ARI.",
