This heterogeneity is thought to be due to dissimilarity in susceptibility and exposure among hosts. As such, it has been proposed that many host-pathogen systems follow the general pattern whereby a small fraction of the population accounts for a large fraction of the pathogen transmission. This disparity in transmission dynamics is often referred to as '20/80 Rule', i.e. approximately 20 per cent of the hosts are responsible for 80 per cent of pathogen transmission. We investigated the role of heterogeneity in contact rates among potential hosts of a directly transmitted pathogen by examining Sin Nombre virus (SNV ) in deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus). Using foraging arenas and powder marking, we documented contacts between wild deer mice in Great Basin Desert, central Utah. Our findings demonstrated heterogeneity among deer mice, both in frequency and in duration of contacts with other deer mice. Contact dynamics appear to follow the general pattern that a minority of the population accounts for a majority of the contacts. We found that 20 per cent of individuals in the population were responsible for roughly 80 per cent of the contacts observed. Larger-bodied individuals appear to be the functional group with the greatest SNV transmission potential. Contrary to our predictions, transmission potential was not influenced by breeding condition or sex.",

This heterogeneity is thought to be due to dissimilarity in susceptibility and exposure among hosts ( Woolhouse et al. 1997; Dye & Gay 2003) . A study of HIV/AIDS found that more than 90 per cent of virus transmission was derived from the most infectious 20 per cent of the population ( Johnson et al. 1994) . Similar heterogeneities have been reported for other human diseases such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), measles, monkeypox and smallpox (Lloyd-Smith et al. 2005) . Woolhouse et al. (1997) proposed that many host-pathogen systems followed the 20/80 Rule, which proposes that approximately 20 per cent of the most infectious hosts are responsible for 80 per cent of transmission within a disease system. While this concept is often referred to as the 20/80 Rule, the precise ratios are not as important as the general concept that a minority of the population is responsible for the majority of the transmission in many host-pathogen systems.",

Studies have examined heterogeneity in vector-borne zoonoses, such as West Nile fever (Kilpatrick et al. 2006 ) and tick-borne encephalitis (Perkins et al. 2003) ; however, very little is known about patterns of heterogeneity in directly transmitted pathogens, in part, because of the difficulty in measuring contacts between hosts. There are few techniques available to measure contacts, and those that are available can be costly or potentially interfere with the natural behaviour of the host, particularly for small-bodied species such as rodents (Mikesic & Drickamer 1992; McQuillen & Brewer 2000) .",

Males have higher rates of infection than females, most likely because they more frequently engage in aggressive behaviours thought to transmit the virus (Childs et al. 1994; Mills et al. 1997; Douglass et al. 2007) . SNV infection in deer mice is chronic and, following infection, deer mice produce virus-specific antibodies for life (Botten et al. 2003) . SNV can be transmitted to humans and can develop into hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome, a disease with high mortality (Hjelle et al. 1994; Kilpatrick et al. 2004 ). As such, SNV is a zoonotic agent of concern to human health.",

We documented contacts between wild deer mice in Great Basin Desert of central Utah using two distinct methods, one that measures contacts directly and one that approximates contacts between individuals. We examined contacts among deer mice to determine if individuals differed in contact frequency or duration; from this, we also assessed whether such disparities resulted in a differential probability of SNV infection. Additionally, we sought to characterize the functional group within the deer mouse population that was associated with the greatest proportion of contacts, and to determine if SNV dynamics could be explained in general by the 20/80 Rule, i.e. a minority of deer mice have a majority of the contacts. Since males exhibit a greater degree of scarring , and are often found to have a greater proportion of the SNV infections, we predicted that males would have a greater number and/ or longer contacts than female deer mice, and thereby higher potential of SNV transmission. Additionally, we predicted that deer mice in breeding condition would have a greater SNV transmission potential because reproductive condition can influence intraspecific interactions between deer mice (King 1957; Healey 1967) and SNV infection (Douglass et al. 2007) . We also predicted that larger bodied individuals would have greater SNV transmission potential, since body mass has been correlated with wounding and aggressive interactions in other hantaviruses ( Hinson et al. 2004 ) and with SNV prevalence in previous studies (Mills et al. 1997; Douglass et al. 2001; Calisher et al. 2007 ).",

For three nights at each site, animals were live-trapped using 148 traps (H.B. Sherman Traps, Inc.) distributed in a 'web' configuration over 3.1 ha, following the methods of Mills et al. (1999) . Upon capture, animals were identified to species and we documented sex, weight and breeding condition of each individual. Male deer mice were considered to be in breeding condition, if their testes were descended; females were considered to be in breeding condition if their vaginas were perforate, or if they were pregnant or lactating (Calisher et al. 2002) . Deer mice were also marked with uniquely numbered ear tags (1005-1, National Band and Tag, Co., Newport, KY) and Passive Integrated Transponder tags (PIT; TX1400ST, BioMark, Inc., Boise, ID) injected subcutaneously between the scapulas. Approximately 0.2 ml of blood was drawn via the retro-orbital sinus from all deer mice at the time of initial capture for each season. Blood was stored immediately on dry ice until transferred to a K808C freezer. After blood collection, all animals were released at the point of capture. All workers implemented precautions for handling animals potentially infected with hantavirus (Mills et al. 1995) and all techniques for capturing and handling animals were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Utah ( IACUC nos. 0203011, 0503011).",

Deer mice were selected on the first morning after processing and maintained in traps with food and bedding until 1-2 hours before sunset. Immediately prior to their release, the mice were marked with a fluorescent powder by applying a unique powder colour to each mouse (Radiant Color Co., Richmond, CA) using a stiff toothbrush. The powder was combed backwards through the fur from tail to head over the entire animal. Although we could not standardize the amount of powder per gram of animal, each powdered animal was thoroughly covered with powder by the end of this procedure. Our preliminary investigations under both laboratory and field scenarios indicated that the powder needed to cover the entire animal in order for successful transfer during a brief encounter such as a fight. After being marked with powder, deer mice were released at the point of capture. We were limited to marking a total of five animals with powder per site because we could only distinguish 5 out of the 10 colours available for fluorescent powders, and we could not distinguish mixtures of powders from the original colours. Powder marking does not significantly alter animal behaviour (Stapp et al. 1994 , Ebensperger & Tamarin 1997 Kalcounis-Ruppell et al. 2001) .",

We checked for powder by brushing the fur backward over the entire body, paying careful attention to the head, ears, mouth, feet and tail, as we predicted those to be most likely areas of contact during aggressive interactions. The powder colour and location on the body were recorded for each deer mouse. If a deer mouse appeared to have a powder mark, but we were unable to distinguish between natural pelage colours and a powder mark, we rubbed a cotton swab over the coloured area. The swab was then examined under the UV light; if no colour appeared on the cotton swab, it was assumed to be natural colour of mouse pelage.",

Time constraints and limited equipment meant that sites were sampled consecutively, not simultaneously, over the course of one month. Within one week after mark-recapture sampling, 12 foraging arenas were placed at a site for three nights. Arenas were placed throughout the site in locations where deer mice had been captured during the mark-recapture study. At sunset each night, foraging arenas (30 cm diameter) were filled with 2 L of sand plus 6 g of millet as an attractant to rodents. As millet comprises less than 1 per cent of the volume of the arena, the animals had to actively forage for the seed reward. PIT antennae were placed below the arenas with data loggers to continuously record the identity and time of each visiting individual. Foraging arenas were closed and leftover millet was sifted out at sunrise each morning. After recording rodent visits for three consecutive nights, data from loggers were downloaded onto a laptop computer. From these data, we determined which individuals visited arenas. Apparent contacts between individuals were defined as the presence of two individuals at a foraging arena within 15 s of one another. This length of time was appropriate given the 5 s lag in the readers coupled with our preliminary video analysis of deer mice at the foraging arenas. We also determined the duration of each apparent contact at each arena.",

We also estimated heterogeneity in the frequency distribution of the duration of contacts (in intervals of 5 s) measured by PIT tags only. We used the mean duration of contact per individual to estimate the typical length of a contact per individual and to account for differences in the number of encounters among individuals. We could not evaluate the distribution of the data for each individual because of limited data for some individuals (i.e. individuals with three to four observations). However, examination of the data indicated that individuals with long average durations tended to have multiple interactions of long duration and that the average was not driven by a single extreme value. Aggregation was quantified by the parameter k, the corrected moment estimate (Elliot 1977) . When k is large (more than 20) the distribution is said to be random; when k approaches zero, the distribution is highly skewed and said to be aggregated, following a negative binomial distribution ( Fisher et al. 1943; Elliot 1977; Wilson et al. 2001 ). If heterogeneity existed in the deer mouse population, as measured by the number of unique contacts or the average duration of contact per individual, we expected k to approach zero for one or both of these measures.",

When SNV serostatus was modelled as a function of the number of unique contacts alone, estimated by the powder marking method or the PIT tag method, we found that it was not a significant predictor of SNV infection. The average duration of contacts was also not a statistically significant predictor of SNV serostatus at aZ0.05; however, the p-value for this variable (0.08) suggests that duration should not be completely discounted as a predictor of transmission. The relationship of transmission potential and duration of contacts between hosts is a novel finding that has been previously overlooked in pathogen dynamics, as few studies document the duration of contact between infected hosts. In the laboratory, SNV was transmitted less frequently and less efficiently than other hantaviruses (Botten et al. 2002) ; perhaps the quality of interactions (i.e. contact-byduration) between hosts plays an important role in successful transmission. These results suggest that understanding the nature of interactions, including frequency and especially duration, between hosts may be a critical component in understanding host-pathogen dynamics, particularly for directly transmitted diseases.",

Given that body mass increases with age, this result suggests that older individuals are more likely to be connected than younger deer mice and, thereby, have greater SNV transmission potential. Older or heavier animals may have greater home range to meet their energetic demands, creating more frequent opportunities for contact as they travel. Alternatively, owing to prior experience older animals may be more likely to engage in interactions with other deer mice as they defend territory, nest sites or food resources. Our study corroborates the findings of previous studies that have found a positive relationship between SNV antibody presence and body mass (Mills et al. 1997; Douglass et al. 2001; Calisher et al. 2007) .

This finding contrasts with that of other hantavirus studies that have found a positive and time-lagged relationship between breeding condition and SNV seroconversion (Douglass et al. 2007 ). This pattern is assumed to be due to increased contact between deer mice during breeding. Our results suggest that, while there may be a correlation between breeding condition and increased incidence of SNV infection in deer mice, it is not necessarily due to increased contact. It has been proposed that differences in host infectiousness may also play role in host heterogeneity ( Woolhouse et al. 1997; Dye & Gay 2003) . Our previous work revealed that, when presented with artificial immune challenges, male deer mice in breeding condition exhibit a reduced inflammatory response compared with females, suggestive of depressed immunocompetence (Lehmer et al. 2007 ).

Furthermore, that 20 per cent comprised large, male mice in breeding condition (Perkins et al. 2003) . In a study of West Nile virus (WNV ) in the Eastern US, American robins (Turdus migratorius) comprised 3.7 per cent of total avian abundance, yet they accounted for 43 per cent of mosquito feedings that potentially transmit WNV (Kilpatrick et al. 2006 ).

Previous studies have employed radio-telemetry (Ramsey et al. 2002; Gompper & Wright 2005) , viewpoint scanning (Richomme et al. 2006) and proximity data loggers ( Ji et al. 2005) to document interactions. However, it is unlikely that these techniques would be successful in monitoring rodent behaviour, since equipment can alter behaviour due to its weight (as in the case of radio telemetry and proximity loggers). Moreover, the presence of fieldworkers may alter rodent behaviour (as in the case of view scanning and radio telemetry). For this study, we employed two techniques to estimate contacts between deer mice; powder marking, which tracks contacts between individuals directly, and PIT tags, which approximates contacts between deer mice. While both methods have limitations, they are unlikely to alter natural rodent behaviour and their limitations may be reduced when used in conjunction with each other. Foraging arenas equipped with PIT antennae allow PIT tagged animals to be observed while they are moving freely. PIT tags are lightweight (0.06 g) and are unlikely to limit or alter animal movement. However, this technique may underestimate contacts, as it only records contacts between individuals if they come to the foraging arenas. Alternatively, it may exaggerate contacts because animals may have confrontations over the seed resource available at the arenas. However, foraging arenas were designed to be only slightly better resources that the background environment. Often more than half of the seeds remained in the trays by morning, suggesting that the availability of resources was higher outside of the arena and that the arenas were not likely to create additional confrontations.",

            "text": "Powder marking offers an alternative means to monitor contacts, which does not involve food resources. Studies have shown that it is an effective method to document social interactions such as mate choice and nesting behaviour, with minimal effects on animal health or behaviour (Stapp et al. 1994; Ebensperger & Tamarin 1997; Kalcounis-Ruppell et al. 2001 ). However, because there are a limited number of powder colours that can be distinguished from one another, few animals can be monitored simultaneously. Also, because animals have to be trapped for contacts to be observed, it probably underestimates contacts between individuals; once a powder-marked animal is trapped it can no longer have additional contacts.",

In particular, SNV transmission may follow the 20/80 Rule in that a small portion of the population is responsible for a large fraction of the SNV transmission potential, as measured by the frequency and duration of contacts. Males and females neither differ in SNV transmission potential, nor did animals in and out of breeding condition. However, large-bodied, and probably older individuals appear to be an important functional group that has high SNV transmission potential within the deer mouse population.",
