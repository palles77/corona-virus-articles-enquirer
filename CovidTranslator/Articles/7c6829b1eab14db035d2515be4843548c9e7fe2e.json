However, current antiviral strategies cannot provide highly effective protection. In this study, three theoretically effective interference target sites (71-91, 144-164, 218-238) targeting the nucleocapsid (N) gene of PRRSV were designed and selected, and then three siRNA-expressing plasmids were constructed, respectively named p2.1-N71, p2.1-N144, and p2.1-N218. The recombinant siRNA-expressing plasmids were transfected into Marc-145 cells; then the cells were infected with PRRSV (JL07SW strain); finally, after incubation for 48 h, the antiviral activity of those siRNA-expressing plasmids in Marc-145 cells was assessed by cytopathic effects, virus titers, indirect immunofluorescence, and quantitative real-time PCR. Experimental results demonstrated that these three siRNA-expressing plasmids could effectively and significantly inhibit the replication of PRRSV by 93.2%, 83.6%, and 89.2% in Marc-145 cells, respectively. Among these three siRNA-expressing plasmids, p2.1-N71 was found to be most effective, while p2.1-N144 and p2.1-N218 displayed relatively weak inhibition of virus replication. The results indicated that siRNA-expressing plasmids targeting the N gene of PRRSV could significantly inhibit PRRSV replication in Marc-145 cells. Based on our experimental results and previous reports, the 71-91, 179-197, and 234-252 sites of the N gene are good choices to effectively inhibit the replication of PRRSV, and this RNA interference technique can be a potential anti-PRRSV strategy.",

            "text": "Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) is an important viral disease that was first described in North America in 1987 and subsequently in Europe in 1990 and has since become a problem to the swine industry worldwide (Wensvoort et al., 1991; Sagong and Lee, 2011) . It is characterized as respiratory disorders in young pigs and can cause reproductive failure in sows. The causative agent, PRRS virus (PRRSV), is a small, enveloped single-stranded, positive-sense RNA virus, which is classified as a member of the order of Nidovirales, family Arteriviridae, genus Arterivirus (Meulenberg et al., 1993; He et al., 2007) . PRRSV can be divided into two major genotypes: the North American strains (e.g., VR-2332) , and the European strains (e.g., Lelystad virus, LV). The PRRSV genome with a size of approximately 15 kb in length comprises at least 9 open reading frames (ORF1a, ORF1b, ORF2a, ORF2b, ORF3-7) (Lee and Yoo, 2005) . The ORF1a and ORF1b encode the non-structural proteins, replicase and polymerase, which are believed to be involved in viral replication (Brockmeier et al., 2012) . The ORFs 2-7 are postulated to encode for structural proteins (Cao et al., 2010; Zhang et al., 2013) . ORFs 2-4 encode three membrane-associated minor glycoproteins (Sun et al., 2012) . ORF5 encodes the major envelope glycoprotein (GP5) in virions, ORF6 encodes M protein which is the unglycosylated membrane protein (Lee and Yoo, 2005; Lu et al., 2012) , and ORF7 encodes the nucleocapsid (N) protein which constitutes about 20-40% of the total protein content of the virion and is essential to the assembly and disassembly of the virion (Li and Ren, 2011) . As previously described, the N protein was highly antigenic (Dea et al., 2000) , which therefore made it a suitable candidate for the detection of virus-specific antibodies and for diagnosis of the disease (Dea et al., 2000; Bao et al., 2012) . Meanwhile, as originally reported, it may be the most immunogenic protein of the virus (Meulenberg et al., 1995) , but recent findings disclosed that anti-N antibodies were non-neutralizing and non-protective (Murtaugh et al., 2002; Terje, 2010) . However, when compared to the other major structural proteins of PRRSV, the N protein displays a high degree of conservation. RNA interference (RNAi) or RNA silencing is a revolution in biology (Siomi and Siomi, 2009) . It is the process whereby double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) induces the sequencespecific degradation of homologous messenger RNA (mRNA) . A long dsRNA which enters into the cell is cleaved to small interfering RNA (siRNA) duplexes (21-25 nucleotides in length) by a member of the Dicer family Table 1 . List of the siRNA target sequences. For each target site, we designed complementary 55-60 mer oligonucleotides. For the forward 5' single-stranded oligonucleotides, the first five lowercase nucleotides represent a BamHI site (gatcc) for ligation into the pSilencer vectors; the subsequent uppercase oligonucleotides represent the 19 nt sense and antisense sequences specific to the mRNA target; the italics section represents a 9 nt loop sequence common to all of the hairpins, and polythymidine tracts involved in the termination of transcription are underlined (TTTTTT).",

These duplexes are unwound and one strand is loaded into the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), which effectively searches the transcriptome and finds potential target RNAs. The loaded single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) directs an endonuclease to cleave mRNA that contains sequence homologous to the ssRNA. In this way, the guide strand determines the sequence specificity of the RNA interference response (Siomi and Siomi, 2009) . So when RNA interference was first found, it was considered to be one of the most promising methods to combat viral infection (Ullu et al., 2004) . So far, RNA interference has been applied to combat several serious viral diseases, such as Newcastle disease (Yin et al., 2010) , influenza (Ge et al., 2003) , foot and mouth disease (Chen et al., 2004) , porcine transmissible gastroenteritis , classical swine fever (Porntrakulpipat et al., 2010) , porcine circovirus disease (Sun et al., 2007) , avian metapneumo virus (Ferreira et al., 2007) , and SARS (Wu et al., 2005) . Therefore, based on previous research on the application of RNAi technique on viral diseases, and because of the high conservation of the two major genotypes of the PRRSV N gene, we explored the application of the RNAi technique to inhibit the replication of PRRSV.",

            "text": "RNAi was first discovered in Trypanosoma brucei, a species of the family Trypanosomatidae, and it rapidly became the method of choice to downregulate gene expression in the organisms (Fire et al., 1998; Ullu et al., 2004) . For example, Ge et al. (2003) has demonstrated that siRNA specific for nucleocapsid or a component of the RNA transcriptase could potently inhibit influenza virus production in both cell lines and embryonated chicken eggs. Chen et al. (2004) has shown that the transfection of siRNA-expressing plasmids gave an 80% to 90% reduction in the expression of foot-and-mouth disease virus VP1 gene in BHK-21 cells. Zhou et al. (2007) constructed two siRNA-expressing plasmids targeting the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase gene of porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus, and experimental results demonstrated that the amounts of viral RNAs in cell cultures pretransfected with the two plasmids were reduced by 95.2% and 100%, respectively. Porntrakulpipat et al. (2010) has demonstrated that siRNA targeting the nucleocapsid protein of the classical swine fever virus (CSFV) effectively inhibited CSFV replication. Therefore, siRNA can play an important role in the inhibition of viral replication. Likewise, siRNA technique is also applied to fight against PRRSV. Guo et al. (2013) has shown that delivered microRNA-181 mimics could strongly inhibit PRRSV replication in vitro through specifically binding to a highly conserved region (over 96%) in the downstream of GP4 of the viral genomic RNA, but the inhibition of PRRSV replication was dose dependent. Moreover, Bao et al. (2012) has constructed four siRNAs targeting ORF1b and ORF6, and verified that RNAi could effectively inhibit PRRSV replication in cultured cells in vitro. The N gene is directly involved in the virus replication. As previously described in a report, the N gene could affect PRRSV function involved in the recognition of viral RNA, sub-cellular localization and interactions with other viral and cellular proteins (Stefanie et al., 2012) , and virus assembly. Therefore, the N gene plays a vital role during the life cycle of PRRSV. Based on these characteristics of the N protein, this study utilizes the RNAi technique to target the N gene to inhibit the replication of PRRSV. We selected the N gene as a target gene, and then three siRNAs were designed at 71-91, 144-164, 218-238 sites (as shown in Fig. 1 ) for RNA interference. Through the assessments of CPE observation, virus titers, indirect immunofluorescence and quantitative real-time PCR, the experimental results showed that these three siRNA plasmids could effectively inhibit the replication of PRRSV. They were able to prevent Marc-145 cells from forming CPE, and could make 874-fold, 151-fold, and 592-fold decreases of virus titers detected by TCID50. Furthermore, the results of quantitative real-time PCR showed that three siRNA-expressing plasmids could effectively inhibit the replication of PRRSV by 93.2%, 83.6%, and 89.2% respectively in Marc-145 cells. Among these three siRNAexpressing plasmids, p2.1-N71 was found to be most effective, while p2.1-N144 and p2.1-N218 displayed relatively weak inhibition of virus replication. A potential explanation for the most effective inhibition by p2.1-N71 is that an A/U rich region plays a crucial role for the antisense terminal duplex regions of highly effective siRNAs. The A/U rich region at the 5 antisense end of the sequence may be required for target recognition and contribute to the unwinding of siRNAs (Ui-Tei et al., 2004) . According to this guideline, after analysis on the three siRNA sequences (p2.1-N71, p2.1-N144, and p2.1-N218), we find out that p2.1-N71 has more A/U at the 5 antisense end than p2.1-N144 and p2.1-N218 (namely, siRNA sequences of p2.1-N71 in A/U rich terminal region is up to 53%, while p2.1-N144 and p2.1-N218 are 42% and 47% respectively). Therefore, p2.1-N71 shows the most effective inhibition rather than p2.1-N144 or p2.1-N218. Similar reports have been seen in He's and Huang's studies (Huang et al., 2006) . He et al. (2007) constructed four U6 promoter-encoded siRNA sequences directing against a well-conserved region of PRRSV N gene. Among these four targets, N179 was found to be highly effective, with an inhibition rate of 96%, while N95, N218, and N294 displayed weak activity (the inhibition rates were 49%, 42%, and 51%, respectively). Huang et al. (2006) constructed four siRNA-expressing plasmids targeting the coding region of the N protein of PRRSV. The experimental results demonstrated that the siRNA could effectively induce a potent repression of gene expression in Marc-145 cells, and cells transfected with plasmids pSUPER-N3 siRNA targeting the 234-252 sites of the N gene showed a significant decrease in virus yield when compared to the 13-31, 100-118, and 294-312 sites of the N gene. Coincidentally, N179 and pSUPER-N3 both basically meet the A/U rich guideline.",
