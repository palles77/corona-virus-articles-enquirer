As transmission intensifies in other countries, the interplay between age, contact patterns, social distancing, susceptibility to infection and disease, and COVID-19 dynamics remains unclear. To answer these questions, we analyze contact surveys data for Wuhan and Shanghai before and during the outbreak and contact tracing information from Hunan Province. Daily contacts were reduced 7-9 fold during the COVID-19 social distancing period, with most interactions restricted to the household. Children 0-14 years were 59% (95% CI 7-82%) less susceptible than individuals 65 years and over. A transmission model calibrated against these data indicates that social distancing alone, as implemented in China during the outbreak, is sufficient to control COVID-19. While proactive school closures cannot interrupt transmission on their own, they reduce peak incidence by half and delay the epidemic. These findings can help guide global intervention policies.",

The surveys were conducted from February 1, 2020 to February 10, 2020, as transmission of COVID-19 peaked across China and stringent interventions were in place. Participants in Wuhan were asked to complete a questionnaire describing their contact behavior (4, 5) on two different days: i) a regular weekday between December 24, 2020 and December 30, 2020, before the COVID-19 outbreak was officially recognized by the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission (used as baseline); and ii) the day before the interview (outbreak period). A similar survey was conducted in Shanghai to obtain information on contacts during the COVID-19 outbreak period; contacts for the baseline period were based on a survey using the same design conducted in the same city in 2017-2018 (6) .

The reduction in contacts was significant for all stratifications by sex, age group, type of profession, and household size, except for pre-school children aged 0-6 years old (Tab. 1).

These features can be illustrated in the form of age-stratified contact matrices (provided as ready-to-use tables in the Supplementary Materials), where each cell represents the average number of contacts that an individual has with other individuals, stratified by age groups. The bottom left corner of the matrix, corresponding to contacts between school age children, is where the largest number of contacts is recorded. The contribution of contacts in the workplace is visible in the central part of the matrix, while the three diagonals (from bottom left to top right) represent contacts between household members. In contrast, for the outbreak period where strict social distancing was in place, much of the above-mentioned features disappears, essentially leaving the sole contribution of household mixing ( Fig. 1B and 1E ). In particular, contacts between school-age individuals are fully removed, as highlighted by differencing baseline and outbreak matrices ( Fig. 1C and  1F ). Overall, contacts during the outbreak mostly occurred at home with household members (94.1% in Wuhan and 78.5% in Shanghai), thus the outbreak contact matrix nearly coincides with the within-household contact matrix in both study sites and the assortativity by age feature observed for regular days almost entirely disappear (see Supplementary Materials).",

This is currently a topic of debate, as little information on the age profile of asymptomatic cases is available (7, 8) . To this aim, we analyzed contact tracing information from detailed epidemiological field investigations conducted by the Hunan CDC (Supplement). We calculated the age-specific relative risk of infection for close contacts of confirmed COVID-19 index cases. Briefly, all close contacts of COVID-19 cases reported in Hunan province were placed under medical observation for 14 days and were tested using real-time RT-PCR. Those who developed symptoms and tested positive were considered as symptomatic confirmed cases, while contacts who tested positive without exhibiting symptoms were considered as asymptomatic infections. The total of symptomatic and asymptomatic infections was used to estimate the relative susceptibility to infection by age. The ratio of symptomatic cases to total infections was used to estimate the relative probability of developing symptoms (see Supplementary Material). We found age differences in susceptibility to SARS-CoV2 infection, where young individuals (aged 0-14 years) had a lower risk of infection than individual ages 65 years and over (OR=0.41 (95%CI: 0.18-0.93), p-value=0.026). There was a weak non-significant trend towards lower susceptibility in middle-aged adults, relative to seniors (OR=0.76, 95%CI: 0.46-1.24, Tab. 2). These findings are in contrast with a previous study in Shenzhen, where susceptibility to infection did not change with age (7). Moreover, we found that the relative probability of developing symptoms also increased with age, however the difference was not statistically significant (Tab. 2).",

Susceptible individuals can become infectious after contact with an infectious individual according to the estimated age-specific susceptibility to infection.

When we consider contact matrices representing the outbreak period, keeping the same baseline disease transmissibility as the pre-intervention period, the reproductive number drops well below the epidemic threshold both in Wuhan and Shanghai ( Fig. 2A) . In an uncontrolled epidemic (without intervention measure, travel restriction, or spontaneous behavioral response of the population), we estimate the mean infection attack rate to be in the range 64%-92% after a year of SARS-CoV-2 circulation, with slight variation between Wuhan and Shanghai (variations of about 5%-12%, Fig. 2B ).",

We used the same estimates of relative susceptibility to infection by age as in our main analysis (see Supplementary Material for a sensitivity analysis assuming equal susceptibility to infection). We considered two different contact pattern scenarios, based on data from Shanghai: contacts estimated during vacations period (6) and contacts estimated during regular weekdays, after all contacts occurring in school settings have been removed (6) . Either one of these scenarios represent a simplification of a school closure strategy as during vacations children can still attend additional education, while removing all contacts in the school setting does not take into account that, for instance, parents may need to leave work to take care of children. We estimated that limiting contact patterns to those observed during vacations would interrupt transmission for baseline R0 up to 1.5 (Fig. 2C) . Removing all school contacts would do the same for baseline R0 up to 1.2. If we apply these interventions to a COVID-19 scenario, assuming a baseline R0 of 2 -3.5, we can achieve a noticeable decrease in infection attack rate and peak incidence, and a delay in the epidemic, but transmission is not interrupted (Fig. 2D ). For instance, for baseline R0=2.5 and assuming a vacation mixing pattern, the peak daily incidence is reduced by about 57%. In the corresponding scenario where school contacts are removed, we estimate a reduction of about 20%. Overall, school-based policies are not sufficient to entirely prevent a COVID-19 outbreak but they can have a significant impact on disease dynamics, and hence on hospital surge capacity.",

            "text": "This study suffers from several limitations. First, the estimated mixing patterns for a regular weekday in Wuhan may be affected by recall bias since contacts were assessed retrospectively. For Shanghai, we relied on a survey conducted in December 2017 -May 2018, using the same design as the one conducted during the outbreak period, thus avoiding recall bias. It is also important to note that changes in contact patterns were measured in a context where social distancing was applied together with rapid isolation of infected individuals (including suspected cases) and quarantine of close contacts for 14 days. Only a small portion of the population in the two study sites was affected by contact tracing and quarantine, thus having little to no effect on the average contact patterns of the general population. However, in reconstructing the observed epidemics in Wuhan and Shanghai, it is not possible to separate the effects of case-based strategies from population wide social distancing. In our simulation model, we estimated the effect of social distancing alone; combining social distancing and case-based interventions would have a synergistic effect to further reduce transmission. Further, our estimates of age differences in susceptibility to infection and probability of developing symptoms are based on active testing of contacts of 57 primary confirmed cases. These data suffer from the usual difficulties inherent to identifying epidemiological links and index cases. Seroepidemiology studies are currently lacking but will be essential to fully resolve the population susceptibility profile of COVID-19.",

Modeling results may possibly be underestimating the effect of social distancing interventions as our results account for a decreased number of contacts but ignore the impact of increased awareness of the population, which may have also affected the type of social interactions (e.g., increased distance between individuals while in contact, or use of face mask (16, 17) ). Finally, our school closure simulations are not meant to formulate a full intervention strategy, which would require identification of epidemic triggers to initiate closures and evaluation of different durations of intervention (5) . Nonetheless, our modeling exercise provides an indication of the possible impact of a nation-wide preemptive strategy on the infection attack rate and peak incidence. To generalize these findings to other contexts, location-specific age-mixing patterns and population structures should be considered.",
