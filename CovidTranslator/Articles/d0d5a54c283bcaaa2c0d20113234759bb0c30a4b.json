Some commentators have gone as far as to suggest that it is leisure time -how we use it and its meaning to individuals and familiesthat defines our lives, as a focus for non-work activity. This reflects a growing interest in what people consume in these non-work periods, particularly those times that are dedicated to travel and holidays which are more concentrated periods of leisure time. This interest is becoming an international phenomenon known as 'tourism': the use of this leisure time to visit different places, destinations and localities which often (but not exclusively) feature in the holidays and trips people take part in. The World Travel and Tourism Council (WTTC) estimate that travel and tourism as economic activities generates around US$6 billion, which is expected to grow to US$10 billion by 2015. At a global scale, travel and Tourism today: Why is it a global phenomenon embracing all our lives? 1 tourism supports around 235 million jobs: this is equivalent to 8 per cent of world employment and 9 per cent of world GDP. Therefore, the growing international significance of tourism can be explained in many ways. In an introductory text such as this, it is important to stress at the outset the following types of factors and processes in order to illustrate the reasons why tourism assumes an important role not only in our lives but also globally:",

This is potentially replicating the demand in the 1960s and 1970s for new popular forms of mass tourism. Much of that earlier growth was fuelled by access to cheap transport (i.e. the car and air travel) and this provided new leisure opportunities in the Western world and more recently in the developing world and newly industrializing countries \u2022 consumer spending on discretionary items such as travel and tourism is being perceived as a less costly item in household budgets. It is also much easier to finance tourism with the rapid rise in credit card spending in developed countries, increasing access to travel opportunities and participation in tourism \u2022 technology such as the internet has made booking travel-related products easy and placed it within the reach of a new generation of computer-literate consumers who are willing to get rid of much of the traditional ritual of going to a travel agent to book the annual holiday.

It is not only embraced by various people as a new trend, a characteristic or defining feature of people's lives, but is also an activity in which the masses can now partake (subject to their access to discretionary forms of spending). This discretionary activity is part of wider post-war changes in the Western society with the rise in disposable income and spending on consumer goods and services. Yet tourism is not just a post-war phenomenon as it can be traced back through time as shown in Chapter 2. This highlights how important tourism was in past societies as well as the historical processes of continuity and change which help us to understand tourism development throughout the book. The first major wave of growth in consumer spending was in home ownership, then in car ownership and, then, in accessing tourism and international travel. In fact international travel (and domestic travel, i.e. within a country) is a defining feature of the consumer society. Whilst the car has given more people access to tourism and leisure opportunities within their own country, reductions in the price of aeroplane tickets have made international travel and tourism products and services more widely available. For example, the number of air travellers in the UK is expected to rise to 475 million by 2030. This is not without its environmental cost.",

Whilst scientists have pointed to these concerns since the 1960s, these environmental issues have only really begun to permeate government and people's thinking since the rise of global concerns over climate change and the international Kyoto Treaty seeking to address greenhouse gas emissions. Tourism is the centre stage in these concerns because travel for leisure purposes is not a fundamental necessity, and it contributes to CO 2 emissions through the consumption of fossil fuels used to transport people on holiday, at the destination and in the accommodation they use. Transportation causes around 75 per cent of the CO 2 emissions generated by tourism, with aviation responsible for around 40 per cent of these emissions. Improving energy efficiency in transportation may be expected to generate a reduction of 32 per cent in the emissions per passenger kilometre between 2005 and 2035. However, the quantity of emissions varies depending on the mode of transport used, with long-haul travel the greatest contributor to highly emissionintense trips.",

Many people openly admit to being supportive of 'green' and 'sustainable' principles but are unwilling to sacrifice their annual or additional holiday to reduce carbon emissions: likewise, few are willing to sacrifice an overseas destination for a less carbon consumptive and polluting domestic holiday. This assumes a more interesting dimension when one sees some sections of the tourism industry responding to consumer interest in green issues, by offering more 'green' and 'sustainable' holidays, recognizing a business opportunity. Critics have labelled this harnessing of green issues as one way of gaining a competitive edge without a complete commitment to implementing sustainability principles in their business practices as 'greenwash' (see Table 1 .1).",

This has become a major problem for governments when the scale of sea level change is set against natural changes in the land level, which is sinking at a rate of around less than a centimetre per year. However, this means that in less than 100 years some island states such as the Maldives may be flooded and therefore uninhabitable. The Maldives is a collection of 1200 small islands (198 of which are inhabited) and it is dependent upon tourism as its main source of external earnings, accounting for over 28 per cent of GDP and almost 60 per cent of foreign earnings' receipts. The dependence upon tourism has meant that the country's 600 000 international visitors each year are a key source of revenue for the country's economy and should climate change combine with sea level rises to accelerate the pace of change, the country's tourism industry could be completely eradicated. Therefore in spite of the country's natural beauty and 80 tourist resorts located across 80 different atolls (i.e. small islands that are just above sea level) its competitiveness as a destination may well be threatened by natural environmental changes. To address these threats, the capital Male has built a 3 m sea wall for just one island and other islands in the Maldives suffer periodic flooding. Despite these major challenges, the country's government is seeking to try and mitigate the worst impacts of climate change, as its resources are very limited and the scale of the problem is huge. It is a story that can be repeated across many similar island archipelagos across the South Pacific where climate change may accelerate the pace of sea level rises putting the livelihoods and entire destination in peril for the future. embrace sustainability ideals (e.g. recycling, reuse and minimizing the use of natural resources) to their holiday-taking behaviour.

Tourism appeals to the human imagination. As an activity it knows no bounds: it is global and it affects the environment it occurs in, the people who host it, the economies it seeks to benefit and the tourists who consume it as an experience, product and an element of their lives. With tourism having this all-embracing role, it is no surprise that many commentators, researchers and governments have agreed on the need to manage it as a process and activity, especially since it has the potential to snowball and grow out of proportion if it is not managed. Therein lies the basic proposition of this book -tourism needs managing if it is to be successful and beneficial rather than a modern-day scourge. Tourism and its ability to be sustainable as an activity have been major growth areas of research since the 1990s. The guiding principles of sustainable tourism are based on the management of resources, the environment and economy and society/its culture for the long-term so they are not compromised or damaged by tourism development.

These types of questions are what this book seeks to address. It will also look at why tourism as a consumer activity is built on dreams, images and what people like to do; this is notoriously difficult to understand as it involves entering the realms of psychology and the mind of the individual tourist. Furthermore, these psychological elements are bound up in notions of enjoyment, feelings, emotions and seemingly intangible and unseen characteristics. The issue is further complicated by the way in which an individual's tastes and interests change throughout their life. In other words, being a tourist is based on the principle of non-work and enjoyment of one's free time in a different locality, and results in an experience, a treasured memory and something personal which develops through our life course. Tourism is a dynamic phenomenon and a highly trend-driven activity in a post-modern society where travellers constantly seek new and diverse experiences. This has led the tourism sector to harness marketing techniques to create different products and experiences to very specific market segments based on consumers' interests and values.

The importance of this technology is that it allows consumers to communicate about social themes such as holidays and travel. So the increasing use of the internet to make bookings and reservations for travel online has been combined with consumer ratings and reviews online through travel sites such as TripAdvisor.com. Therefore, many of the previous principles of travel planning, where the advice and knowledge of travel agents was seen as a key determinant of holiday decision-making have now been replaced by the technological power of the internet.",

There have also been attempts to clarify what is meant by the term 'visitor' as opposed to 'tourist' and the distinction between tourists who travel within their own country (domestic tourists) and those who travel to other countries (international tourists). What the debates on defining tourism at a technical level show is that it is far from an easy task in agreeing what constitutes a 'tourist'. For example, should we include someone who is a visitor staying in a second home?: they are technically away from their home, but are staying in another form of property they own. Similarly, how far away from your home area must you travel before your activity is deemed tourism? A further problem is associated with the category of cruise ship passengers who dock at a port and visit briefly, not staying overnight, or cross-Channel trippers who may cross an international boundary but then return within a day and do not stay overnight.",

This is illustrated in Figure 1 .2 and shows that transport forms an integral part of the tourism system, connecting the tourist-generating and destination regions together. Thus, a 'tourism system' is a framework which enables one to understand the overall process of tourist travel from both the supplier and purchaser's perspective (known respectively as 'supply' and 'demand') while identifying the organizations which influence and regulate tourism. It also allows one to understand where the links exist between different elements of tourism, from where the tourist interacts with the travel organizer (travel agent or retailer), the travel provider (airline, or mode of transport), the destination area and tourism sector within the destination. This approach is also helpful for understanding how many elements are assembled by 1 the tourism sector to create an experience of tourism.

The tour is an underpinning feature of tourism, a prerequisite for tourism to occur -the consumer has to be brought to the product or experience, and has to travel, and it is a reciprocal event -the traveller travels out and back. Transport and single or multiple locations are involved. The conventional definition of touring inevitably implies travel to one or more places, called 'destinations'. A destination typically comprises attractions (e.g. natural and man-made), need to be accessible, have available packages to attract visitors, provide ancillary services such as tour guides and have amenities such as accommodation and retailing. This notion of a destination is increasingly being used as a framework for tourism management by public sector organizations to understand how the visitor experience of a place can be developed and enhanced as well as how the synergies between businesses can be developed and the competitiveness of the destination can be improved.",

Conversely, the excursion element may be something that the tourist undertakes at the destination on a day-trip basis or in the form of a more sustained trip, with a planned or unplanned itinerary. Whilst the holiday is something which encompasses the entire experience or use of leisure time for a holiday, the tour is a distinct element of the holiday and has distinct travel patterns. These patterns contribute to the development of places as destinations which develop and grow through time. Some researchers have attempted to explain the growth, stagnation and decline of tourist resorts such as spas in terms of a resort life cycle. The work of Butler, published in 1980, suggested that resorts follow a specific cycle Page, 1995 ; based on and modified from Leiper, 1990) of growth. The initial exploration by tourists is followed by a period of involvement, often with patronage by a royal figure who started a trend towards visitation (e.g. King George III visiting Weymouth in England) or by its wider popularization as a resort for the elite to visit. This set the stage and created tourism tastes and fashions emulated by the visitors. The next stage of Butler's model is development, followed by consolidation and then stagnation. At this point, the resort may decline or action may be taken by agents of development (i.e. an entrepreneur, the public sector or a combination of both) to rejuvenate the resort, and this rejuvenation is the last stage of the model. Figure 1 .3 illustrates this pattern through time and shows the creation (i.e. birth) and decline (i.e. death) of resorts. Although such models are highly generalized and simplify the reality of resort development, they are a starting point for the analyses of resorts such as spas through history. The model has also been used in recent years as a basis to try and understand what point specific destinations are in their life cycle, since the model follows the marketing concept of the product life cycle, where products may have definite or indefinite life courses. The same applies to tourist destinations which can decline when tourist tastes and patterns change and so fall out of favour and require a new focus or attraction to bring the visitors back.",

At the simplest level, this is shown in Figure 1 .4, which demonstrates the trends in global tourism since 1950 and forecasts to 2020. Part of this turbulence, as Glae\u00dfer (2006) notes, is the impact of natural catastrophes on tourism. For example, in the twentieth century there have been 50 000 natural disasters but between 1990 and 2005 there have been 500-700 such catastrophes each year. These events have periodically interrupted or at worst devastated the tourism industry (e.g. the earthquake that devastated Haiti in 2009), contributing to the notion of turbulence in tourism activity. In other words, a range of factors impact upon visitor arrivals at an international level, because tourism is a very fickle activity (i.e. it is very vulnerable to the external factors mentioned above which act as deterrents to travel) and adverse events can act as shock waves which send ripples across the world and impact upon people's willingness to travel for pleasure reasons. This is because tourism needs relative stability for such activity to occur and the vulnerability to shock effects has been described as volatility in tourism demand which reacts very quickly to these crises or shock events such as wars, currency fluctuations and political instability. Tourism also responds to very positive factors such as hosting the Olympic Games which may lead to a sudden change in the volume of visitors. One of the most recent shock events that have impacted on global tourism is the global credit crunch. Whilst this has had different types of impacts on various tourism markets (the most substantial on business travel), its continued existence has led to a global decline in visitor arrivals internationally. In addition, in 2008, the effect of the credit crunch was compounded by the outbreak of a global pandemic associated with swine flu (see Figure 1 .5) which initially developed in Mexico and spread by travellers returning to their home areas or by visiting new areas so that a number of fatalities occurred in the affected countries as shown in Figure 1 1,800,000 1 9 5 0 1 9 6 0 1 9 6 5 1 9 7 0 1 9 7 5 1 9 8 0 1 9 8 5 1 9 9 0 1 9 9 5 2 0 0 0 2 0 0 1 2 0 0 2 2 0 0 3 2 0 0 4 2 0 0 5 2 0 0 6 2 0 0 7 2 0 0 8 2 0 0 9 2 0 1 0 2 0 1 5 2 0 2 0 France, Spain, the USA, China, Italy, UK and Germany \u2022 more established destinations in north-western Europe and the USA have seen slower growth compared to emerging regions such as Africa, N.

This is because many published tourism statistics are derived from sample surveys with the results being weighted or statistically manipulated to derive a measure which is supposedly representative of the real-world situation. Hence, many tourism statistics at a country or regional level often state they are estimates of tourism for this reason.

In some cases, the tourists are travelling to developing countries where the standard of living often means the majority of the population lives at subsistence level or at a much lower standard than the visitor. The contrast in wealth between visitor and host is often very large and it highlights a clear inequality between those who have the disposable income to enjoy the luxury of international and domestic travel and the tourism employees who are working at low wage rates and in low-paid, unskilled jobs.

Tourism is no exception to this: large multinational hotel chains and tour operators use developing countries and destinations as the basis for their tourist product. In these situations, the economic linkages with the local community are limited, so that low-skill jobs and low economic benefits are traded off against the profits and economic benefits of tourism development being expropriated (i.e. returned) to the country of origin of the multinational firm. In many cases, the weakly developed nature of local economic linkages in developing countries' tourism economies means they are often trapped into such exploitative relationships because they do not have the indigenous capital or entrepreneurs to set up tourism businesses. A lack of education, know-how and power to negotiate with multinationals to New forces affecting tourism maximize the benefits for local people means that tourism can develop as a form of exploitation for such communities.

Their spending power could be harnessed for the benefit of the local economy. A growing problem in many tourism destinations worldwide is that the growth of tourism and expropriation of its profits mean that the environmental resource base which is used to attract tourists (e.g. attractive beaches, wildlife and the cultural and built environment) is not invested in and may be spoilt. More and more, attention is turning to the extent to which tourism is a sustainable economic, social and environmentally based activity. That we should use the environment without conserving it for future generations is one of the central arguments in the sustainable tourism debate. This also raises the issue of inequalities related to tourism; for example, tourist use of local resources required by residents can destroy those resources and environmental quality. This means that local people, governments and international agencies have a responsibility to lobby and take action to ensure that tourism development which occurs in different countries and locations is not only sustainable but seeks to minimize negative impacts as far as possible. It should not marginalize vulnerable groups such as children and the local workforce: the International Labour Organization (ILO) has estimated that between 10 and 15 per cent of the tourism workforce worldwide comprised children who do not enjoy appropriate standards of labour and employment conditions (see the work of Tourism Concern at tourismconern.org.uk). Among the common human rights abuses which Tourism Concern have highlighted are: the forced eviction of people to make way for tourism development; environmental damage resulting from tourism which impacts upon the resources people depend upon for their livelihoods; exploitation of tribal people as tourist attractions and poor levels of pay and poor working conditions for employees in the tourism sectors.",

The tourism industry needs to work with communities, local bodies and people to ensure that tourism is a win-win activity for everyone and is integrated into the local community rather than just exploiting its local assets.

Tourism has to operate as a profitable activity, but for its long-term future, mutually beneficial relationships and links between the industry, people and the environment must exist to bring financial and sustainable benefits for all and enhance the reputation and image of tourism as a global phenomenon. This is the underlying basis of the pro-poor tourism lobby. In this way the welfare and benefits of tourism to tourists can also be extended to the host population and help to address many of the global inequalities which exist in the growing globalization of tourism activity as multinational enterprises seek to exercise greater control of the choice and nature of tourism being offered to consumers.

At the same time, many of these countries have seen their tourism economies expand as tourists seek new destinations and governments embrace the expansion of this activity to generate foreign revenue. A considerable body of research from consultants and academics has arisen on how this expansion of tourism may be harnessed to address the development problems associated with poverty (see Scheyvens, 2007 Scheyvens, , 2011 Mitchell and Ashley, 2009 ). This new thinking has been described as pro-poor tourism which is designed to develop ways to maximize the benefits from tourism to raise local people out of poverty. This involves measures that will: encourage the employment of local people (as opposed to expatriate labour), to provide opportunities for local people to supply goods to tourists and tourism businesses and the creation of micro-enterprises so people can develop their own businesses. However, many obstacles have been identified in implementing pro-poor tourism strategies in less developed countries which include: a lack of awareness and understanding in poorer communities which limits their understanding of the opportunities available; a lack of skills and entrepreneurial talent to capitalize on the opportunities and access to finance to create new businesses focused on tourism as well as cultural concerns over how tourism may affect their way of life. Where success stories of pro-poor tourism exist, these examples of best practice need to be shared so that tourism can be harnessed to address abject poverty through case studies of best practice which outline the principles and success factors associated with implementation of such an approach. This is vital if the benefits of tourism development are to be harnessed in the future to address poverty.",

There is a school of management thought which argues that management only occurs when chaos occurs and that the function of management is to impose order and structure on that chaos.

Aggressive marketing and a limited number of loss-leaders have characterized the low-cost airlines and privatized railways in the UK in an attempt by their owners to capture price-sensitive leisure travellers. In other words, is there scope for price discrimination in the market to differentiate a whole range of products?",

This also highlights what Mintzberg (1973) identified as the nature of managerial work in organizations -short-term coping, disparate activities and more concerned with brevity, variety and increasing fragmentation. Tourism managers and businesses are no exception to this and Mintzberg's research has an important bearing on how managers performed certain roles (see Table 1 .4) labelled as interpersonal, informational and decisional roles. The ten managerial work roles which Mintzberg identified illustrate the scope of activities 1 which operating and managing a tourism business require, as well as some of the complexities of how the individual business interacts with the wider body of interests conveniently labelled the 'tourism industry'. It also suggests how important prevailing market conditions are when they impact upon how a business operates, manages and responds to opportunities, threats and shortcomings in its own organization. Yet to do this, a business needs also to understand its relationship to other tourism businesses. A convenient way to explain this is by using the tourism supply chain concept.",

The supply chain concept originates in economics and has been used to explain how different businesses enter into contractual relationships to supply services, products and goods, and how these goods are assembled into products at different points in the supply chain. Tourism is well suited to the concept of the supply chain because the product, service or experience that is consumed is assembled and comprises a wide range of suppliers. All too often our knowledge of the supply chain is quite restrictive, since a wide range of components are consumed in tourism including the use of bars, restaurants, handicrafts, food, infrastructure and related services. A schematic diagram of a typical tourism supply chain is shown in Figure 1 .6. This shows that once the consumer has chosen a destination and product, the decision to purchase involves contacting a tourism retailer (e.g. a retail agent, a direct selling company or an internet-based seller such as www.expedia.co.uk). Having chosen a booking medium and selected a package from a tour operator, the package is then assembled. The tour operator enters into contractual relationships with tourism suppliers such as airlines (although larger tour operators may also own their own charter or schedule airline), hotel operators and suppliers of associated services such as airport transfers. These suppliers, in turn, contract suppliers who service their business needs: in-flight caterers, airline leasing companies, airport terminal services (i.e. check-in services, baggage handling, flight controllers, customer service agents for visitors and those with special needs, such as the disabled).",

One way is to view the managerial process of tourism as a multilayered process, in which the various organizations and stakeholders involved in tourism engage at different levels through time. Figure 1 .11 demonstrates this. The focus begins with the individual business and the management processes (controlling, planning, leading and organizing) are continuous through the interconnected stakeholder groups from the individual business through to the various interests known as the tourism industry. These interests and the connections between management at different levels and between groups mean that, in reality, these groups also have to be aware of external factors that will impact upon management such as the visitor, the business environment, consumer trends, the growth of the leisure society and political processes affecting tourism at government level. The book is organized in such a way that these issues are explained in a manner where the links between different elements of the tourism sector are addressed through examples and case studies. Each chapter builds upon the one preceding to develop the knowledge and understanding of what the tourism industry is, the management challenges facing each sector and how tourism affects changes in different contexts. Accommodating, anticipating and responding to that level of change is among the major challenges for tourism management in the new millennium. ",
