The community transmission of this highly infectious virus has severely affected various parts of China, Italy, Spain and USA among others. The prophylactic solution against SARS-CoV-2 infection is challenging due to the high mutation rate of its RNA genome. Herein, we exploited a next generation vaccinology approach to construct a multi-epitope vaccine candidate against SARS-CoV-2 with high antigenicity, safety and efficacy to combat this deadly infectious agent. The whole proteome was scrutinized for the screening of highly conserved, antigenic, non-allergen and non-toxic epitopes having high population coverage that can elicit both humoral and cellular mediated immune response against COVID-19 infection. These epitopes along with four different adjuvants were utilized to construct a multi-epitope vaccine candidate that can generate strong immunological memory response having high efficacy in humans. Various physiochemical analyses revealed the formation of a stable vaccine product having a high propensity to form a protective solution against the detrimental SARS-CoV-2 strain with high efficacy. The vaccine candidate interacted with immunological receptor TLR3 with high affinity depicting the generation of innate immunity. Further, the codon optimization and in silico expression show the plausibility of the high expression and easy purification of the vaccine product. Thus, this present study provides an initial platform of the rapid generation of an efficacious protective vaccine for combating COVID-19.",

The antibody generation by B-cell activation as well as acute viral clearance by T-cells along with virus-specific memory generation by CD8+ Tcells are equally important to develop immunity against the coronavirus [11] . In case of respiratory virus like coronaviruses, the mucosal immunity plays an essential role and therefore route of administration of the vaccine is also important in the context of vaccine development. Vaccines designed against previously reported SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV majorly focuses on the Spike protein of virus which consists of S1 and S2 subunits bearing the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the virus and cell fusion machinery respectively.",

The S protein is considered most antigenic and thereby can evoke immune responses and generate neutralizing antibodies that can block the virus attachment to the host cells [13] . Other viral proteins which were explored for vaccine development include N protein, E protein and the NSP16 proteins [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] . Almost all the platforms for vaccine development for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have been investigated including the lifeattenuated ones, recombinant viruses, sub-unit protein vaccines, DNA vaccines, Viral vectorbased vaccines, nanoparticle-based vaccines, etc. which may form the base for the vaccine designing against the newly emerged SARS-CoV-2 [10, 19] . Here we have designed a multiepitope-based vaccine for the SARS-CoV-2 using next generation vaccinology approach where the recently available genome and proteome of the SARS-CoV-2 were maneuvered and a potential vaccine candidate was conceived. Similar strategy was employed previously for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] as well as certain findings are reported for the newly emerged SARS-CoV-2 [26] [27] [28] . While immunoinformatics techniques was utilized by groups to predict the B-cell and cytotoxic T-cell epitopes in the SARS-CoV-2 surface glycoprotein, N protein [27] [28] [29] , others have utilized the information to design epitope-based vaccine based on the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein [26] . Along with the structural proteins, utilizing the non-structural and accessory proteins for the vaccine development can aid in better development of an efficacious vaccine for long term by neutralizing the mutation rate of this RNA virus. In this study, we explored the whole proteome of SARS-CoV-2 to scrutinize the highly conserved antigenic epitopes for the construction of a multi-epitope vaccine candidate that can effectively elicit both humoral and cellular mediated immune response against COVID-19. The constructed vaccine product has high population coverage and along with adaptive immunity, can as well lead to initiation of innate immune response further enhancing the generation of memory immunity.",

All the sequences were analyzed for their antigenic nature by using VaxiJen server which is based upon auto cross covariance (ACC) transformation. VaxiJen classifies the proteins into antigens and non-antigens solely based on the physiochemical properties and is sequence alignment independent. The ACC score threshold for the virus model is kept 0.4 that increases the prediction accuracy. All the SARS-CoV-2 proteins except NSP16 (2'-O-ribose methyltransferase) resulted in the ACC score higher than 0.4 depicting the antigenic nature of the viral proteome (Table 1 ). All the antigenic proteins were further screened for the presence of HTL, CTL and B-cell epitopes by using various tools and databases ( Figure 1 ). HTLs act as the central mediators of immune response and coordinates with B lymphocytes, T C cells and macrophages via signaling through interleukins and cytokines synthesis. HTLs recognize the epitopes presented on MHCII biding cleft. Herein, NetMHCPanII server was utilized for predicting 15 mer HTL epitopes having high binding affinity to the selected 20 MHC II alleles. Only the strong binders for the respective HLA alleles were selected with a percentile rank of \u22641. The selected epitopes were further analyzed using another MHC II prediction tool available at IEDB server and filtered on the basis of percentile rank. The resultant epitopes were checked for their antigenicity, allergenicity and toxicity. Finally, the best HLA-epitope pairs with the highest antigenicity and were non-allergen and non-toxic were used for multi-epitope vaccine construct. On analysis, we received, 2 best HLA-epitope pairs each for Helicase and RdRp. Three best HLA-epitope pairs were obtained for non-structural protein 2 (NSP2) and Spike glycoprotein (S) and one pair each for membrane glycoprotein (M), ORF3a and ORF8 proteins. In summary, non-toxic, non-allergenic epitopes with high binding affinity and antigenicity were obtained for 15 MHC class II alleles and their respective epitopes were used for multi-epitope vaccine construct. Best binding epitopes for the remaining 5 MHC II alleles were either nonantigenic, or were allergens and thus were excluded (Supplementary Table S1 ).",

Upon The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.26.009209 doi: bioRxiv preprint analysis, 3 HLA-epitope pairs were obtained for ORF3a protein, 2 pairs for membrane protein, nucleo-capsid protein, and spike glycoprotein each while one HLA-epitope pair each for NSP2, NSP4, Envelope protein, and ORF8 (Supplementary Table S2 ). Overlapping sequences were merged into one or both MHC class I and class II binding epitopes Apart from cellular mediated immunity, the humoral immune response mediates pathogen clearance in the antibody dependent manner. Hence the proteome of SARC-CoV-2 was further scanned for linear B-cell epitopes by using ABCPred server. For higher selectivity and sensitivity, the threshold of ABCPred was kept 0.9. The predicted epitopes were checked for their antigenicity, allergenicity and toxicity and the best epitopes were taken for further consideration. On the basis of above criteria, we received one B-cell epitope each for Nucleocapsid, Guanine-N7 methyltransferase (ExoN), ORF3a, ORF7a, and Surface glycoprotein (Supplementary Table S3 ). The locations of the selected epitopes in the respective protein structures are represented by Figure 2 . Overall, the antigenic 13 HTL and 12 CTL epitopes having highest affinity for the respective HLA alleles and 5 B-cell epitopes that are non-allergenic, non-toxic and can generate a potential immune response were selected for incorporation into the multi-epitope vaccine construct.",

The SARS-CoV-2 is highly contagious virus with a high mortality rate especially in immunocompromised and elderly persons. Vaccines are the utmost need of the time to succumb the rising infections due to COVID-19 and represent the best way to combat infectious diseases in the community. Conventional vaccine development methods are time-consuming, laborious and expensive and in this regard, the in-silico immuno-informatics approach have proved to a boon [59] . Moreover, the availability of large number of efficient tools to predict the immuno-determinants, and large database of information facilitate and accelerate this whole process of vaccine designing [60] . Multiepitope vaccines are designed by using the most antigenic conserved part of the pathogen's proteins that makes them more effective and can help in combating the high mutation rate in RNA viruses. These epitope-based vaccines have added advantages of being safe, stable, highly specific, cost-curtailing, easy to produce in bulk, and provides option to manipulate the epitopes for designing of a better vaccine candidate [61] . This method of vaccine development has proved to be promising enough for different microbial diseases including both bacterial and viral [25, [62] [63] [64] [65] [66] [67] .",

Various immune receptors like Toll-like receptors (TLRs) act as sensor proteins that help in recognizing and differentiating self and non-self molecules and cells. They help in recognizing molecular patterns on the surface of foreign particles like viruses, bacteria and fungi and elicit immune response against these infectious agents. TLR3 acts as a nucleic acid sensor and helps in recognizing RNA and DNA viruses inside the human body and establishes a protective role against this infectious agents [68] . In SARS-CoV infection, TLR3 signaling contributes to the innate immune response against the viral infection [69] . Thus agonist of TLR3, \u03b2-defensin that also acts as an adjuvant was added to the vaccine construct. Also, the molecular interaction analysis of the vaccine construct with the TLR3 resulted into a stable complex formation that was energetically favorable. RSMD analysis of the vaccine construct and the vaccine construct-TLR3 complex depicted the stable nature of both the systems in the real environment.",

As well they are the sole players in generating immunological memory that provides long lasting immune response. Thus, the vaccinology approach revolves around the screening of proteome for the high affinity Helper T Lymphocytes (HTL) and Cytotoxic T Lymphocytes (CTLs) epitopes that can activate T H and T C cells. The epitopes for the activation of HTLs and CTLs are processed and presented by various human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I and class II molecules. The HLA-epitope binding steps are crucial and have high specificity and are thus considered as one of the main focus for vaccine designing. HLA shares large diversity due to the presence of several alleles in the human genome but their occurrence is not uniform world-wide. Few of the alleles are present throughout the world while some are restricted to only specific regions. Recent reports and literature survey lead us to identify the massively affected regions by COVID-19 , namely China, Italy, Spain, Germany, USA, Iran, France, South Korea, Switzerland, UK, Netherlands, Austria, Belgium, Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Canada, Malaysia, Australia, Japan. The presence of various epitopes with different HLA-binding specificities leads to greater population coverage as the frequency of HLA allele's expression varies with the varying ethnicities worldwide. Henceforth, fourteen HLA class I and Twenty class II alleles were selected on the basis of their occurrence in these countries.

Population coverage analysis shows the broad range spectrum of the constructed vaccine Population coverage of the vaccines depends upon the interaction of the epitopes with the number of HLA alleles that are then represented to T C and T H cells that elicit the immune response. Depending upon the ethnicity, the expression of HLA alleles varies throughout the world. Thus to check the population coverage of the vaccine construct, presence of selected HLA alleles were analyzed in the 26 severely affected countries by COVID-19 around the world. Individually, MHC class I alleles covered on an average 91.22 % of world population while MHC class II alleles covered 99.70 % (Figure 3A & B). As our vaccine construct harbors HTL epitopes for 15 MHC class II and CTL epitopes for 14 MHC class I alleles, the occurrence of these HLA alleles depicted the population coverage of >99% throughout the world.

CD 4+ T cells are the key regulators of humoral immunity as they assist B-cells in effective antibody class switching and their affinity maturation. Universal memory T helper cell peptide (TpD) is a chimeric peptide derived from tetanus and diphtheria toxoids and has a high promiscuity to interact with wide range of MHC class II alleles. Presence of a TpD in the vaccine construct leads to an effective T h cell activation and enhances the immunogenicity of the vaccine. Similarly, a universal Pan DR epitope (PADRE) has been reported to enhance potency of long multiepitope by activating CD4+ T helper cells and helps in generating high titer IgG antibodies.[57] Another small peptide CTGKSC act as an M cell ligand ad enhances the adsorption of oral vaccines from the intestinal membrane barrier.[58] Hence for enhanced immune response and transportation, these four adjuvants were added to the multi-epitope vaccine construct. The adjuvants and epitopes were arranges in the following order: \u03b2defensins -HTLs -TpD -CTLs -PADRE -BCL -CTGKSC. To preserve independent immunogenic activities, various linkers were used for combining the adjuvants and epitopes.EAAAK was used to join the adjuvants, HTL, CTL and BCL epitopes with each other as they effectively separate various domains in multi-domain proteins. GPGPG linkers were used to join HTL epitopes, while AAY linkers were used for combining CTLs. GPGPG and AAY linkers enhances the recognition of the vaccine constructs by MHC I and MHC II machineries. Similarly, KK linkers were utilized for combining B-cell epitopes. KK linker acts as target for Cathepsin-B that separates the epitopes before MHC class II mediated antigen presentation to the Th0 cells.

Coronaviruses are the viruses containing one of the largest RNA genomes encoding several accessory proteins, non-structural proteins and the structural proteins. Generation of humoral and cellular mediated memory immunity leads to fast and long lasting immune response in case of viral infection. In our vaccine development process against the SARS-CoV-2, the antigenic viral proteins were screened for the most immunogenic and antigenic B-cell and T-cell epitopes that could efficiently evoke the immune response. For the generation of most efficacies vaccine, successful recognition of epitopes by various HLA alleles is a preliminary requisite. Therefore, 14 HLA I and 20 HLA II alleles were selected that covers the maximum population in the severely affected countries throughout the world. The screened epitopes were further checked for allergenicity and toxicity inside the host. This screened epitopes covered fifteen various antigenic proteins of SARS-CoV-2 including various non-structural [nsp2, nsp4, nsp-6, Guanine-N7 methyltransferase (ExoN), etc.], structural (E, M, N and S) and accessory proteins (ORF3a, ORF7a and ORF8). Inclusion of all these proteins makes it a potent and effective vaccine candidate against the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The proteinpeptide docking of the HLA alleles epitopes showed the efficient binding in the epitope binding cleft of HLA structure. The population coverage analysis of the vaccine based on the presence of epitopes for the HLA alleles showed the broad range of the vaccine construct covering >99% of world population. Adjuvants are the small peptides that when added along with the antigenic vaccine enhances the immunogenic response. Considering this fact, four different adjuvants were added to the multi-epitope vaccine construct that enhanced the innate and adaptive immune response and helped in better transportation through the intestinal membrane barrier. Vaccine construct was observed to be antigenic, non-allergenic and non-toxic making it a potent vaccine candidate against SARS-CoV-2. The physiochemical analysis of the construct revealed the stable nature of the vaccine product and is at par with the standards required for the formulation of an effective vaccine. The solubility analysis of the multi-epitope vaccine construct revealed ~70 % of solubility in an overexpressed state which is in admissible limits and is required for purification and other functional analysis.",

Finally, in-silico analysis was performed so as to easily express and purify the multi-epitope vaccine construct in a bacterial host. Thus, the present study scrutinizes the antigenic proteins of SARS-CoV-2 for designing and highly efficacious protective vaccine candidate that can elicit both humoral and cellular mediated memory response and provides a starting platform for in-vitro and in-vivo analysis for the development of protective and prophylactic solution against COVID-19.
