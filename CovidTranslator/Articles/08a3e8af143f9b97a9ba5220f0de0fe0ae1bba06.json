Viruses must control host gene expression and the localization of viral RNAs to be successful parasites. RNA granules such as stress granules and P-bodies contain translationally silenced messenger ribonucleoproteins (mRNPs) and serve as extensions of translation regulation in cells, storing transiently repressed mRNAs. New reports show a growing number of virus families modulate RNA granule function to maximize replication efficiency. This review summarizes recent advances in understanding the relationship between viruses and mRNA stress granules in animal cells and will discuss important questions that remain in this emerging field.",

PBs and exosome granules are foci that are constitutively present in cells and contain components involved in mRNA decay [3, 8] . Neuronal granules are also constitutively present in neurons but are instead associated with the concentration and transport of translationally silenced messenger ribonucleoproteins (mRNPs) moving along the axons to dendrites [5] . SGs are not constitutively present in cells, but similar to neuronal granules, SGs are concentrations of stable, translationally silent mRNA [9] that are thought to be sites of mRNA storage and triage [10] . SGs and PBs are found in the widest number of cells types. Although PBs are known to be modulated by some viruses, this review will focus on the many more publications describing viral modulation of stress granules.",

            "text": "Based on immunofluorescent microscopic analysis of SG constituents, SGs are defined as macromolecular aggregates of stalled 48S initiation complexes that form in response to stress conditions [11] . The best described pathway of SG formation initiates with phosphorylation of eukaryotic translation initiation factor (eIF) 2\u03b1 (eIF2\u03b1) by the eIF2 kinases PKR, PERK, GCN2 or HRI [12] [13] [14] , although alternative pathways exist such as inhibition of eIF4A RNA helicase [15] [16] [17] or viral infection [15] . PKR, a component of the interferon response, is commonly activated by RNA viruses producing double-stranded RNA as replication intermediates and PERK is activated by endoplasmic reticulum stress associated with a smaller group of viruses, many that express membrane glycoproteins (e.g. herpes viruses and others). HRI, activated by heme deprivation and oxidative stress and GCN2, which is activated by nutrient starvation, are not commonly linked to virus infection, though GCN2 binding to Sindbis virus RNA induces its activation [18] . SG are foci of concentrated 48S translation preinitiation complexes, thus SGs are defined by the presence of translation initiation machinery including 40S ribosome subunits, eIF2, eIF3, eIF4A, eIF4B, eIF4E, eIF4G, and eIF5 [13, 15, 19, 20] . SGs are also defined by certain key marker RNA binding proteins (RBPs) such as T-cell restricted intracellular antigen 1 (TIA-1), TIA-1-related protein (TIAR) and RasGAP SH3-domain binding protein 1 (G3BP1) [14, 21] , however, SGs contain many other RBPs (Figure 1 ). Since SGs contain stable, inert mRNA, they represent an intermediate step in the equilibrium between active translation that occurs on free polysomes and mRNA decay, which takes place in PBs. As such, they dynamically release contents for active translation [22] [23] [24] [25] as well as interact with PBs in a process that is thought to result in the exchange of mRNA 'cargos' [23] . The movement of RBPs between compartments is rapid, with a full replacement of some SG contents occurring in well under a minute [22, 23] . Other evidence suggests that association of mRNA with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) renders the mRNA resistant to inclusion in SGs [26] . Frequent interaction of SGs with PBs is observed in cells that are actively forming SGs and live cell imaging shows that this process is dynamic and transient [23] . Little is known about the mechanism or purpose of this interaction other than the proposed mRNP cargo exchanges (Figure 1 ), but the overexpression of tristetraprolin (TTP) and related protein BRF1 is known to promote and stabilize the association of SGs and PBs [23] .",

            "text": "The molecular mechanism(s) [27] by which SGs form is undefined, but appears complex and involves several steps that include the self-oligomerization of certain constituent RNAbinding proteins, post-translational modifications of proteins and mRNP transport on microtubles (Table 1, Figure 1 ). Theoretically, viral inhibition of any of these important steps may block or modulate SG formation in cells. Self-oligomerization of TIA-1 or TIAR and G3BP may play a crucial early role in the SG aggregation process and overexpression of these proteins induces spontaneous SG formation [21, 28] . Expression of the C-terminal glutamine-rich prion related domain (PRD) of TIA-1 inhibits the formation of SGs and overexpression of TIA-1 lacking the PRD does not spontaneously induce SGs [28] . Additionally, murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) that are null for TIA-1 or TIAR display deficient SG formation in response to various stressors [28] . G3BP can self-oligomerize in a phosphorylation-dependent manner and overexpression of the central domain of G3BP containing the arginine-rich and PxxP domains inhibits SG formation [21] . As is the case with TIA-1, cells with G3BP repressed by siRNA treatment [29] and G3BP \u2212/\u2212 MEFs are also deficient in the formation of SGs [21] . Additionally, G3BP sequestration by the inactive kinase MK-STYX inhibits the formation of SGs in response to arsenite and G3BP overexpression [30] , further confirming the importance of G3BP in SG formation. The ability of G3BP to mediate the formation of SGs is regulated by the phosphorylation of serine 149 by an unknown kinase. Overexpression of a phosphomimetic mutant, G3BP S149E , inhibits the formation of SGs whereas an exogenously expressed non-phosphorylatable mutant, G3BP S149A , localizes to SGs similarly to wild type [21] . Viral interference with G3BP and TIA-1 will be discussed below.",

Disassembly of microtubules by pharmacological treatment abolishes the formation and dissolution of SGs, resulting in the formation of small, dispersed SGs at the onset of stress and prolonging their presence in cells recovering from stress [32, 33] . However, MTs do not affect their maintenance once formed [31, 32] . Inhibition of the motor proteins dynein/dynactin and kinesin similarly resulted in small dispersed puncta and extended SGs maintenance during stress recovery [34, 35] . Taken together, the mechanism of SG formation appears to be multifactorial and may involve multiple types of protein modifications on key targets and RBP interactions with the cellular cytoskeleton. Many of these steps may be modulated by viruses.",

In general, most viruses appear to antagonize SG formation during infection, although some induce and may exploit portions of SG responses as part of the infectious cycle.

Formation of SGs containing G3BP and eIF4GI peaked between 2-3 hours post-infection (hpi) [15, 29] and then declined as infection matured [29] by a mechanism that requires viral replication. Similar to MRV and SFV, PV inhibits the formation of canonical SGs in response to exogenous stressors such as arsenite. In a report thought to be contrary to previously described PV-induced inhibition of SG, TIA-1-containing foci were observed late in virus infection and correlated with stable SGs [41] . However, it was later shown that TIA-1-positive foci persisting in PV-infected cells are actually devoid of other SG defining components such as initiation factors and most mRNA and thus do not represent canonical SGs [42] . Thus, PV gene products are able to unlink the process of TIA-1 aggregation from sequestration of stalled translation initiation complexes, thereby releasing sequestered translation apparatus to support viral translation. PV inhibition of SG is primarily mediated by the viral 3C pro -mediated cleavage of the SG component G3BP, which separates the G3BP RNA-binding and protein-interaction domains ( Figure 1 , 2). Rescue of formation of bonafide SG containing initiation factors and mRNA via the expression of cleavage-resistant G3BP Q326E led to a ~7-fold decrease in viral replication, indicating a potential antiviral role for SGs [29] , [42] .",

In the case of RSV, infection induces SGs in ~30% of infected cells at 24 hpi and this may promote RSV replication since cells with SGs contained larger viral inclusion bodies than cells not forming SGs. Further, the inhibition of SG formation via the stable knockdown of G3BP resulted in a 10-fold decrease in replication [27] . A followup report showed SG induction by RSV was mediated by PKR-dependent eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation and a PKR knockout had a decreased ability to induce SGs in response to RSV infection. However, unlike the initial findings, the lack of SG formation was not correlated with a decrease in viral replication [59] . In contrast, Hanley et al. used the same cell line and RSV strain and found that only RSV viruses containing mutations or truncations in the 5\u2032-trailer region induce SGs during infection [60] . The trailer is a region of extragenic RNA that is required for genomic RNA transcription. The cause of these contrasting results is yet to be determined and due to the opposing nature of these results, the question of the role of SGs in the RSV lifecycle is unanswered.",

MHV induces the formation of SGs and PBs at 6 hpi; this is coincident with partial eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation, shutoff of host translation, but robust virus translation. However, although SG coexist with high virus translation rate, it was not reported if MHV antagonized or inhibited SG at later timepoints in infection. In contrast to RSV, MHV replication was enhanced in cells deficient in eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation or SG formation [47] , indicating that although the virus triggers eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation to inhibit host translation, its own translation is also susceptible to this inhibition but to a lesser degree. TGEV induces SGs that increase and persist at least 16 hr, through much of the infection cycle. These SGs contained TIA-1, TIAR and the nuclear protein PTB and it was shown that formation of these structures correlated with inhibition of viral RNA accumulation. PTB was shown to bind virus RNA by mass spectroscopy and viral guide RNA (gRNA) and subgenomic mRNA (sgmRNA) was included in precipitable complexes with TIA-1 and PTB, but SG structures with PTB were distinct from other foci containing (virus) dsRNA or replication complexes. In light of this, the authors suggest that SG induction and manipulation of PTB localization may play a role in regulating viral RNA replication, translation or packaging [58] . The effects of SG inhibition on TGEV mRNA expression were not analyzed and an antiviral role of the PTB-positive SGs cannot be ruled out.",

Even though VV can suppress eIF2a phosphorylation, during replication SG-like structures form within and adjacent to its cytoplasmic replication factories (RFs) [61, 62] . These aggregates contained colocalized G3BP and cytoplasmic activation/proliferation-associated protein-1 (p137 or Caprin1) plus initiation factors eIF4G, eIF4E and VV RNA. G3BP is an integral protein to the SG formation process [21] and G3BP:Caprin-1 heterodimer localizes to SGs [63] . G3BP and translation initiation factors become highly concentrated within aggregates, and are deficient elsewhere in the cytoplasm, a situation which occurs in uninfected cells only when SGs form. G3BP or Caprin1, may stimulate VV intermediate gene expression either individually or as a heterodimer through unknown mechanisms [64] . It was proposed that these sites were centers of viral translation [62] , which is contrary to typical SGs containing the same proteins that are sites of stable, non-translating mRNA. Walsh et al. showed that viral RFs contained aggregates of eIF4E and eIF4G but not PABP or TIA-1, indicating an incomplete SG structure assembly [65] . Part of the VV mechanism of subversion of normal SG response may result from degradation of host mRNA, freeing aggregating SG components for alternate tasks.",

Since the formation of these SG were linked to PKR activation and reduced viral replication, the authors termed them antiviral granules (AVGs) [61] . It is likely that PKR activation triggers more complete activation of functional SGs.

G3BP is also concentrated and utilized by HCV near replication complexes [43] . Translation initiation factors are required for any virus to replicate efficiently, so sequestration of 40S subunits and eIF4G, eIF4A, eIF4B and eIF3 can have negative consequences for virus replication. Further, internal ribosome entry site (IRES) transactivating factors such as PTB, PCBP2 and UNR that stimulate picornavirus translation are sequestered in SGs [42] .

Major questions currently remaining center around mechanisms of interference with SGs. Viral sequestration or cleavage of the SG components G3BP, TIA-1, Staufen, HDAC6 provide initial clues, but the function of all these proteins in SG formation and regulation is poorly defined. Other viruses such as cardioviruses and Junin virus have identified viral products that mediate SG inhibition, but the targets and molecular details remain incomplete. Similarly, in most cases where SGs are inhibited during infection, the question remains open whether SG loss is due to inhibition of formation of SGs or stimulation of SG disassembly. Stimulation of SG dissolution as opposed to inhibition of SG formation would constitute a novel mechanism of SG modulation during infection and its investigation would provide crucial details into a largely unresearched stage of the SG process. Still other steps in SG assembly have not been evaluated during viral infection, notably microtubule transport or post-translational modifications. Viral interference in any of these processes could potentially restrict SG formation and function. Finally, PV, CrPV and HCV infection also disrupts PBs along with SGs [43, 45, 71] . It will be important to determine which viruses block both types of RNA granules and whether integrated mechanisms are involved.",

            "text": "Further work is also necessary to determine the nature of antiviral effects mediated by SGs and the nature of the balancing act between virus induction of SG versus apoptosis. While sequestration of cellular factors into SG is suggested for some systems, there has been no definitive test of this concept and it is clearly not antiviral in some cases where SG induction increases viral replication. An attractive hypothesis is that SG formation signals downstream stress signals that activate innate antiviral mechanisms as part of an integrated stress response. Mechanistic details of SG inhibition in other viral systems would potentially allow for suppression of inhibition, allowing for further characterization of the antiviral effects of SGs. Viruses are excellent probes of cellular function. As further investigation uncovers the mechanisms behind viral inhibition of SG formation, we will learn a great deal about the cell biology and biochemistry that supports RNA granule function. Inhibition of translation initiation leads to the disassembly of polysomes and the formation of stalled 48S initiation complexes. These mRNP complexes are recognized via an unknown mechanism and are remodeled, marking them for inclusion in SGs despite continued association with pro-translation initiation factors. SG components such as G3BP, FMRP and others are post-translationally modified and small dispersed aggregates of remodeled mRNP complexes are transported by microtubule-associated motor proteins into larger SGs. The brackets around this central step indicate that it is not currently known which process is initially undertaken. SGs are thought to be sites of storage of stabilized mRNA, although it is known that mRNA can be released for translation or transported to PBs for active decay by an unknown mechanism. Multiple virus systems (in red) have been found to interfere with the process of SG and PB formation and the points of interaction with the process are indicated. Stress granules also dock with P-bodies where mRNP modification and cargo exchange takes place. Initiation factors are lost except eIF4E and deadenylase complexes (Pan2/3, Caf1/Ccr4) decapping complexes (Dcp1a/2) and exonucleases (Xrn1) become associated. Some viruses inhibit P-body formation as indicated and PV antagonizes specific P-body components [43, 45, 71] . Inhibition of SG formation by several viral systems has been characterized in more detail and two types of mechanisms are illustrated: cleavage or sequestration of SG components. Cleavage of G3BP1 by poliovirus (PV) 3C proteinase inhibits the inclusion of translation initiation factors, mRNA binding proteins and mRNA in SGs without modulating the ability of TIA-1 and TIAR to aggregate. Human T-cell leukemia virus type-1 (HTLV-1) Tax protein interacts with HDAC6 to inhibit SG formation, whereas the HIV Gag protein binds to Staufen1. The 3\u2032 stem loop present in flavivirus negative sense RNA binds and sequesters TIA-1 and TIAR, leading to the inhibition of SGs. Through unknown mechanisms, CrPV prevents accumulation of Drosophila homologs of TIA1 (Rox8) and G3BP (Rin) in SGs. Table 1 Stress granule mechanistic processes viruses can potentially modulate a",
