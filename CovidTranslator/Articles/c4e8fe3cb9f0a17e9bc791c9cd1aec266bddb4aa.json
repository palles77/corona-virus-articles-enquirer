Throughout their lives, patients with inherited (primary) antibody deficiencies are treated with relatively high doses of IVIg. Patients who develop secondary antibody deficiencies because of disease or disease-related therapy may also receive high-dose IVIg for prolonged periods of time. With the observation of platelet count rise in the circulation after treatment of immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) with highdose IVIg in the early 1980s (1), the door was opened to explore the potential of high-dose IVIgs in several other nonimmunodefi-ciency diseases. Single or multiple courses of highdose IVIg were successfully used to treat a wide variety of other autoimmune disorders (for review, see refs. 2 and 3). The mechanisms of action of IVIg in such a wide variety of diseases were recently reviewed (4) (5) (6) (7) . Because regular exposure to large quantities of a human plasma protein carries the risk of infection with bloodborne pathogens, increasing the pathogen safety of IVIg, without diminishing its clinical efficacy, is a high priority.",

Yellow fever vaccines stabilized with human serum produced 23,000 cases of hepatitis in American military personnel. Most epidemiological investigations strongly suggested that pooled human plasma presented a higher risk of hepatitis transmission than whole blood. This was attributed to the increased probability that pooled plasma would be contaminated by one or several donors. Because plasma pools from 250 to 2000 blood donations were being used to produce albumin, efforts were initiated to inactivate hepatitis viruses in human serum albumin solutions (8) .",

This procedure was possible because of the discovery that 40 mM acetyltryptophan and 20 mM sodium caprylate increased the heat resistance of albumin. Unfortunately, other plasma proteins in solution are inactivated by heat and early attempts to inactivate viruses in high-risk products were unsuccessful. Immunoglobulins produced by cold ethanol fractionation were found to have low risk of virus transmission, similar to heated albumin solution (9) . The reason for this was unknown. This perception changed in 1983, when Lane reported that an IVIg produced by cold ethanol fractionation transmitted non-A, non-B hepatitis (10) . At this time, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) was isolated and proven as transmissible by blood and blood products (11, 12) , although there was no confirmed HIV transmission by IVIg. The emergence of HIV and reports of non-A, non-B hepatitis transmission by some IVIg products (13, 14) but not others caused manufacturers and regulatory agencies to examine existing IVIg manufacturing processes for their capacity to eliminate viruses (15) (16) (17) (18) (19) (20) (21) (22) (23) (24) . Development of dedicated virus inactivation procedures for IVIg production was also initiated (25, 26) .",

As demonstrated by experimental validation studies almost all the virus in Cohn Fraction II+III is removed during precipitation of Fraction III (Kistler-Nitschmann Precipitate B), a waste fraction that contains IgA, IgM, plasminogen, and other proteins (Fig. 2) .

The noncovalent bonds involved in virus assembly are the same as those that main-tain proteins in their native, biologically active, three-dimensional structures (conformation). Consequently, processes that inactivate viruses may also denature proteins. Some proteins can withstand small changes in conformation without losing their biological activity or may renature spontaneously. Other proteins lose biological activity from minor changes in conformation. The denaturation temperature of a protein is sharply defined and is different for each protein (30) . Heating for a definite time to a temperature just below the denaturing temperature of a particular protein is used in some protein purification procedures to inactivate viruses. In the presence of substrate, enzymes can be heated to temperatures 10\u00b0C higher than in the absence of substrate (30) . Pasteurization is used to inactivate predominantly enveloped viruses in a wide variety of plasma derivatives (31) (32) (33) . However, it is also effective against some nonenveloped viruses (e.g., B19 virus; refs. 34 and 35).",

This process has been so effective that the development of filters with pore sizes small enough to remove viruses was a logical consequence. Development of virus-removal filters for therapeutic protein solutions was handicapped by the need to process large volumes at reasonable flow rates. Initial problems were resolved in the early 1990s, and the viral safety of plasma products was improved by implementing virus filtration at the process scale. Virus filtration is a simple, robust, nondestructive process that adds size exclusion, a new mechanism, to conventional virus inactivation and partitioning. Because it does not discriminate between enveloped and nonenveloped viruses, virus filtration has the potential to remove the broadest range of pathogens (60-64) (Fig. 4) .",

Globalization increases long-distance trade and travel, urbanization (often in dense, impoverished settlements), pressure on land reserves, and migration into these lands. Climate change also influences the environment, the host, and the microbes. Therefore, we expect new and resurging pathogens in the future.

In November 2002, the first known case of atypical pneumonia occurred in Foshan City (Guangdong Province, China). Until March 2003, the \"severe atypical pneumonia\" spread over three continents (13 countries). Then, the World Health Organization (WHO) set up global networks to expedite detection of the causative agent; develop a robust and reliable diagnostic test; pool clinical knowledge on symptoms, diagnosis, and management; and study SARS epidemiology. Schools were closed, thousands of people were put under quarantine in affected areas, travel recommendations were issued, and airlines started screening their passengers for symptoms. Exactly 1 mo after its establishment, the WHO laboratory network announced conclusive identification of the SARS causative agent: an entirely new coronavirus, unlike any other human or animal member of the family Coronaviridae. In July 2003, the last known chain of transmission was interrupted in Taiwan. The coordinated control measures recommended by WHO, which included early identification and isolation of patients, vigorous contact tracing, management of close contacts, and public information and education to encourage prompt reporting of symptomscertainly together with a portion of luck-were effective to overcome the SARS epidemic. An example of a reemerging virus is West Nile virus (WNV) in the United States. Within 4 yr WNV spread from the East Coast to the West Coast. Birds are the primary amplifying hosts, and the virus is maintained in a birdmosquito-bird cycle. Infection of mammals is a dead-end infection. The reason for the rapid dynamics of the WNV epidemics in North America is that the virus found a favorable environment with the appropriate vectors and na\u00efve hosts.",

To date, we are not aware that emergent human pathogens with these characteristics have been described. However, these have occurred in animals. A classical example of an emerging virus of this type is canine parvovirus (CPV) type 2, a member of the family of Parvoviridae. Parvoviruses infect different vertebrate hosts and tissues with the constriction that cells must be in a dividing state to allow virus replication. A shift in species tropism of feline panleukopenia virus (FPV) was recently observed (for review see ref. 71) . This resulted in the emergence of CPV as a new pathogen in dogs in mid-1978 with a subsequent rapid global spread (72) . The event occurred through a limited number of amino-acid changes involving the transferrin receptor (TfR) binding surrounding the three-fold spike (73) . The virus evolved over the following years from CPV-2, which does not replicate in cats, to CPV-2a and b, which replicate efficiently in cats and cause an infection as FPV. The substitution rate in the capsid protein was calculated to be 2 \u00d7 10 -4 nucleotides/ year, just about 10 times less than for RNA viruses (74) .",

This mutation frequency is very close to the one reported for retroviruses (76) . In the presence of the monoclonal antibody, which bound to the highly antigenic, threefold spike, viruses that escaped antibody neutralization were selected and enriched to 100% within three passages. In in vivo experiments in severe combined immunodeficient mice treated with the same antibody from day 25 postinfection, such escape mutants were also selected. Virus stocks used in these experiments were cultivated from single MMV clones. The presence of viruses resistant to the neutralizing antibody already in stock preparations shows the considerable diversity in clonal populations of parvoviruses. This phenomenon is generally called \"viral quasispecies\" and is well-known in the retrovirus field (77) . A high genomic variability was also described for B19V in isolates of persistently infected patients (78) .

First, although parvovirus DNA replication is strictly dependent on host replication factors in the S-phase of the cell cycle, the mechanism for the unidirectional leading strand DNA synthesis differs from cellular semiconservative DNA replication with leading and lagging strands. It was also observed that parvovirus DNA replication uses distinct replication bodies not identical with nuclear DNA replication bodies (83) . This may be the reason why parvovirus DNA replication is less accurate than cellular DNA replication. Second, this highly antigenic structure (threefold spike) must be under a high selective pressure from the host defense. Third, the low pressure from negative selection may be an additional reason for the observed mutation frequency. Apparently parvoviral capsids may tolerate certain variability without negative impact on infectivity or capsid stability. Figure 6 shows the high degree of variability for amino acids in two stretches (301-313, 389-406) making up the threefold spike of the erythrovirus capsids. The mentioned sequences have all been deposited in the Uniprot database and were retrieved by a low stringency WU-BLAST search (search matrix: PAM10). This quasispecies behavior of parvoviruses provides a pool of genetic variance, which can rapidly adapt to selective pressures.",

We already know that circulating, small, nonenveloped viruses harboring the capacity to switch host and tissue tropism exist. Although today's Igs are safer than ever, the plasma processing indus- try is highly vigilant to be prepared for the future. The very sensitive techniques available for the study and diagnosis of viruses must be applied proactively, even on viruses that are not considered human pathogens. These viruses need to be studied on the cellular and molecular levels to identify their vulnerabilities and to generate the basis for the development of appropriate removal or inactivation methods.",
