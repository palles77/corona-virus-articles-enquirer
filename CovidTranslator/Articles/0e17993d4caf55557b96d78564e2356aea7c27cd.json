We analyzed relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU) and phylogenetic relationship between geographical regions, and calculated the genetic substitution patterns between Korean isolate and those from other countries. We calculated the ratios of synonymously substituted codons (SSC) to all observed substitutions and developed a new analytical parameter, EMC (the ratio of exact matching codons within each synonymous substitution group) to investigate more detailed substitution patterns within each synonymous codon group. We observed that FMDVs showed distinct RSCU patterns according to phylogenetic relationships in the same serotype (serotype O). Moreover, while the SSC and EMC values of FMDVs decreased ac-cording to phylogenetic distance, G + C composition at the third codon position was strictly conserved. Although there was little variation among the SSC values of 18 amino acids, more dynamic differences were observed in EMC values. The EMC values of 4-and 6-fold degenerate amino acids showed significantly lower values while most 2-fold degenerate amino acids showed no significant difference. Our findings suggest that different EMC patterns among the 18 amino acids might be an important factor in determining the direction of evolution in FMDV.",

The Korean isolate in 2000 was thought to have originated in the Indian subcontinent in the early 1990s, but the reason why FMD had re-emerged after 66 yr was not clear (Kanno et al., 2002) . Additionally, there was a further FMD outbreak on January 8 2010, identified as a serotype A (FAO World Reference Laboratory, 2010). Since April 2010, however, most of the FMD cases in Korea have changed from serotype A to O (FAO World Reference Laboratory, 2011), and over 3.5 million animals have been slaughtered.",

Seven serotypes of FMDV have been identified: A, O, C, Asia 1, and South African Territories 1, 2, and 3. Outbreaks have occurred in every livestock-containing region of the world except New Zealand, and the disease is currently enzootic in all continents except Australia and North America, which have not had an outbreak since 1870 and 1952, respectively Domingo et al., 2002; Grubaman and Baxt, 2004) . FMDV comprises four capsid proteins: VP1, VP2, VP3, and VP4. VP1-VP3 genes encode proteins exposed on the capsid surface. VP1 contains the major antigenic determinants for infection, resulting in seven distinct genetic lineages that correlate with serotype (Fox et al., 1989; Samuel and Knowles, 2001) .",

ENC is a codon-usage parameter that can take values from 20, in the case of extreme bias where one codon is exclusively used for each amino acid, to 61 where the use of alternative synonymous codons is equally likely (Wright, 1990 ). An ENC value can be calculated for each target nucleotide sequence, showing the average pattern of codon-usage bias regardless of the characteristics of each amino acid group. RSCU is the observed frequency of a codon in a target sequence divided by the frequency expected, minimizing the bias from amino acid composition. In this study, we analyzed RSCU values and phylogenetic relationships between regional isolates, and calculated genetic substitution patterns between those from Korea and those isolated from other countries. We also developed a new analytical parameter to compare the codon substitution patterns in more depth.",

SSC values ranged from 89.7% (serine) to 100.0% (phenylalanine), suggesting that most codon substitutions of FMDVs occurred within the synonymous codon groups. To examine statistical differences in the SSCs among the 18 synonymous codon groups, we performed one-way ANOVA test using Tukey's studentized range test method. Using the SSC value of phenylalanine (SSC = 100.0%) as a baseline, alanine, glycine, threonine, shown. All the regional information is presented in Table S1 .

CUB is the absolute deviation between calculated and unbiased RSCU values. Using CUB values, they compared absolute deviation patterns of RSCU values among the seven serotypes of FMDVs; serotype SAT3 had the highest bias while serotype C had the lowest. Serotype O gave intermediate values between serotype A and SAT3 along with other serotypes (Asia 1, A, SAT1) . The authors suggested that these results might indicate that differences in evolutionary bias may exist among the seven serotypes, and be primarily determined by codon usage bias in each serotype. In the present study, we computed the RSCU values of 204 VP1 genes of serotype O FMDVs according to the countries from which they were isolated, and observed that FMDVs isolated in each geographical region also had their own RSCU patterns within serotype O (Figure 2 ). FMDVs were separated into 5 different groups, and these corresponded to the phylogenetic groups in Figure 1 . Our findings also indicate that FMDVs in each geographical region have evolved by maintaining their synonymous codon usage patterns. In 2000, Levin and Whittome also reported that there was significant variation in codon usage of genes within the same virus genome, and codon usage bias between viruses was closely related phylogenetically in nucleopolyhedroviruses (Levin and Whittome, 2000) . Our research showed a similar trend in FMDVs.",

Regarding the GC-end pattern of codon in FMDV, Zhong et al.

Lewis-Rogers et al. (2008) also analyzed the capsid proteins of FMDVs and concluded that most amino acids were under purifying selection at the genotypic level as their evidence suggested that less than 29% of residues were identified as being under either selection category. In our study, we also observed that there was less variation among amino acids when we calculate SSC values between Korean isolate and those from 33 other countries. Using the EMC parameter, we investigated substitution patterns within each synonymous codon group in more details, and found that there were dynamic differences among synonymous codon groups as well as isolated regions (Figure 4 ). Our results indicate that 2-fold degenerate amino acids might have stricter substitution conditions within the synonymous codon group, versus codons encoding 4and 6-fold degenerate amino acids. Our finding also suggests that different EMC patterns among amino acids might be a key factor in determining the evolutionary direction in FMDV in the long term. In fact, the SSC values of the 4-and 6-fold degenerate amino acids were relatively low compared with those of the other amino acids, indicating that non-synonymous codon substitutions preferentially occurred in those codon groups. Regarding nucleotide substitution rates in FMDV, Haydon et al. (2001) reported that the rates in capsid genes were in the range 0.5-1.5 \u00d7 10 -2 nucleotide substitutions per site per year, and the ratio of synonymous to non-synonymous changes was variable across data sets, and is sensitive to the interval of time. They mentioned that complete sequences of capsid genes VP1-VP3 for serotypes O, A, and C indicate ratios of synonymous to non-synonymous substitutions of approximately 3:1. We observed that there were differences in the substitution patterns within each synonymous codon group as well as the ratio of synonymous to non-synonymous substitutions, and these differences of EMC pattern among amino acids might have an important role in FMDV evolution.",

Correspondence analysis using RSCU values showed that there was unique synonymous codon usage bias in FMDVs isolated in a specific region, and this corresponded with the phylogenetic distance between them. For more in-depth comparisons, we identified codon substitution patterns by calculating SSC and EMC values, and generated the CTMs between Korean isolate and those from other countries (Figure 3 ). In general, the abundance of nonsynonymous (d N ) and synonymous (d S ) pairwise variability in nucleotide sequence and their ratio (d S /d N ) have been used to determine the selection power, such as mutation pressure or a natural selection (Bonhoeffer et al., 1995; Nielsen, 1999) . If the d N exceeds the natural expectation ratio, this is evidence for positive selection (Kimura, 1983) . In this paper, we introduced a new parameter, EMC, to facilitate the comparison of codons within synonymous substitutions to showed more detailed selection patterns within synonymous codon groups. Here, we found that G + C composition of FMDVs in the third codon position was strictly conserved while SSC and EMC values decreased, and those values in 4and 6-fold degenerate amino acids decreased significantly. Moreover, we observed that the EMC values were inversely proportional to phylogenetic distances, and each amino acid showed a unique EMC pattern, indicating that viral evolution caused by gradual codon substitution might be influenced",

After alignment, the FASTA-format aligned results were divided into country of isolation with their gap information. The second step was to count all the possible codon substitutions between Korean sequence and those from other countries at each codon position along the VP1 gene. This generated 33 codon substitution matrices (CSMs) for each pair of countries of isolation, where each cell represents each codon in the Korean isolate or those from other countries (Table S2) . Three stop codons, 2 sole codons for methionine and tryptophan, and codons that included one or more gaps in any codon position were excluded from this analysis. In the third and final step, we computed 2 types of codon substitution patterns from CSMs using C ++ codes. We calculated the ratio of synonymously substituted codons (SSC) to all observed substitutions from each synonymous codon group of Korean isolate, and developed a new codon substitution parameter, \"EMC\", the proportion of exact matching codons within each synonymous codon group, to investigate synonymous codon substitutions in more detail. Equations for the two analytical parameters can be defined as:",
