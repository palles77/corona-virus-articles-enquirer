            "text": "Since May 2013, outbreaks of porcine epidemic diarrhea have devastated the U.S. swine industry, causing immense economic losses. Two different swine enteric coronaviruses (porcine epidemic diarrhea virus and Delta coronavirus) have been isolated from the affected swine population. The disease has been reported from at least 32 states of the United States and other countries, including Mexico, Peru, Dominican Republic, Canada, Columbia, Ecuador, and Ukraine, with repeated outbreaks in previously infected herds. Here we report the isolation and characterization of a novel mammalian orthoreovirus 3 (MRV3) from diarrheic feces of piglets from these outbreaks in three states and ring-dried swine blood meal from multiple sources. MRV3 could not be isolated from healthy or pigs that had recovered from epidemic diarrhea from four states. Several MRV3 isolates were obtained from chloroform-extracted pig feces or blood meal in cell cultures or developing chicken embryos. Biological characterization of two representative isolates revealed trypsin resistance and thermostability at 90\u00b0C. NextGen sequencing of ultrapurified viruses indicated a strong homology of the S1 segment to mammalian and bat MRV3. Neonatal piglets experimentally infected with these viruses or a chloroform extract of swine blood meal developed severe diarrhea and acute gastroenteritis with 100% mortality within 3 days postinfection. Therefore, the novel porcine MRV3 may contribute to enteric disease along with other swine enteric viruses. The role of MRV3 in the current outbreaks of porcine epidemic diarrhea in the United States remains to be determined, but the pathogenic nature of the virus warrants further investigations on its epidemiology and prevalence.",

Most orthoreoviruses are recognized to cause respiratory infections, gastroenteritis, hepatitis, myocarditis, and central nervous system disease in humans, animals, and birds (11) ; orthoreovirus genomes are prone to genetic reassortment and intragenic rearrangement (11, 12) . The exchange of RNA segments between viruses could lead to molecular diversity and evolution of viruses with increased virulence and host range (13, 14) . MRV serotypes 1 to 3 were associated with enteritis, pneumonia, or encephalitis in swine around the world, including China and South Korea (15) (16) (17) (18) . The zoonotic potential of MRV3 has been reported recently (19) (20) (21) . However, porcine orthoreovirus infection of pigs was unknown previously in the United States.",

Nine out of 11 ring-dried swine blood meal (RDSB) samples from different manufacturing sources (82%) and 18 out of 48 fecal samples (37%) from neonatal pigs from farms with epidemic diarrhea outbreaks in North Carolina, Minnesota, and Iowa amplified a 326-bp S1 fragment with orthoreovirus group-specific primers. Among the 18 orthoreoviruspositive fecal samples, 11 samples were further sequence verified using MRV3-S1 gene-specific primers amplifying a 424-bp fragment. Characteristic cytopathic effects (CPE), including syncytium formation and rounding of individual cells, were evident at 48 h postinfection (hpi) in BHK-21 cells inoculated with chloroform-extracted samples of feces and blood meal ( Fig. 1A to C). The infected cell monolayers were completely detached by 72 to 96 hpi. Developing chicken embryos died 2 to 5 days postinoc-ulation (dpi) after inoculation by the chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) route. Infected chicken embryos showed hemorrhages (\"cherry red appearance\") on the body and/or stunted growth (\"dwarfing\") ( Fig. 1D ). MRV3 antigen was detected in infected BHK-21 cells using monoclonal antibody clone 2Q2048 against 1 protein (Fig. 1E to G). The virus isolates from infected BHK-21 cells or chicken embryos were further confirmed as MRV3 by reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) and sequencing. Eight virus isolates were obtained, and two representative isolates (T3/Swine/ FS03/USA/2014 and T3/Swine/BM100/USA/2014) were used for further studies.",

            "text": "The ongoing outbreaks of epidemic piglet diarrhea have devastated the swine industry in the United States, with significant economic losses. Since a federal mandate to report the SECD cases on 5 June 2014, a total of 731 swine premises had been confirmed positive until 22 January 2015 in the United States (22) . Strict and intensive biosecurity measures have been adopted on many farms to control SECD, but the disease spread is unabated, and at least 32 states are now affected. Repeated outbreaks in previously infected herds were also reported, suggesting that the SECoVs may not be the sole agents responsible for this unprecedented epidemic diarrhea outbreak in the United States and other countries, including Mexico, Japan, Canada, Colombia, Dominican Republic, Ecuador (6) , and Ukraine (7). Here, we report the isolation and characterization of a novel MRV3 from SECD fecal samples and swine blood meal, which is a by-product of the slaughtering industry and is used as a protein source in the diets of livestock. We also provide evidence that these novel MRV3 strains are pathogenic to neonatal pigs, leading to lethal enteric disease. More than 80% of ring-dried blood meal feed supplements and 37.5% of the fecal samples from epidemic diarrheic pigs tested in this study were found positive for the novel MRV3. It remains to be determined whether porcine MRV3 is responsible, either primarily or in combination with SECoV, for the current uncontrollable epidemic piglet diarrhea. There have been conflicting reports on the presence of live pathogenic SECoVs in porcine blood products (23, 24) . The World Organization for Animal Health Office International des Epizooties (OIE) ad hoc group on PEDV recently concluded that contaminated pig blood products, including spray-dried plasma are not a likely source of infectious PEDV (2, 25) as spray-drying typically inactivates enveloped coronaviruses. Therefore, the presence of chloroform-resistant, infectious MRV3 in RDSB as identified in this study is of great significance considering the current difficulties in arresting the spread of this economically important disease in the U.S. and Canadian swine industries.",

Fusogenic MRVs carry a FAST protein (26) , but the U.S. porcine MRV3 strains lack this protein but produce syncytium in infected BHK-21 cells or intestinal epithelium. Additional studies are needed to understand this feature. The virions were double layered with a mean diameter of 82 nm, in concordance with the reported size for MRVs (11) but larger than the reported sizes of 70 to 72 nm for bat orthoreoviruses (20, 27) . Size differences in MRV particle forms, such as virions, intermediate subvirion particles (ISVPs), and core particles, have been reported (11) . Viral factories with paracrystalline arrays of virions in infected Vero cells are an important characteristic of these strains, unlike the tubular viral factories seen in T3D type strains (11) . Interestingly, in infected intestinal villous epithelial cells of young pigs, the virions fuse cells and egress by lysis or by using microvilli. Reovirus egress from infected cells is not completely understood (11) . Our results suggest that MRV3 may use intestinal microvilli to release complete virions as arrays in addition to cell lysis. Deep sequencing analysis of the purified cell culture or developing chicken embryo isolates revealed novel MRV3 sequence. The sequencing data from two selected porcine MRV3 isolates (one each from feces and blood meal) revealed a high sequence homology, thus strongly suggesting that blood meal could be a possible mode of transmission along with other undetermined modes. The thermostability of these MRV3 strains at 56, 80, and 90\u00b0C for 1 h lends further credence to this notion. Ring drying of blood meal entails coagulation of blood by heating to 90\u00b0C, which may not be sufficient to inactivate these heat-resistant MRV3 strains. The current European Union regulation for pig blood products for use in pig feeds (EU 483/2014)-that they must have been treated at 80\u00b0C and kept in storage for 2 weeks at room temperature to inactivate PEDV-may not be sufficient to inactivate porcine MRV3. The genome sequences of the 10 segments of these strains revealed interesting features in combination like never before, making them unique and novel. For example, they carry specific mutations in 1 protein that would impart trypsin resistance (28) and neurotropism (29, 30) , in 2 protein for interferon antagonism (31) , and possessed multiple basic residues in 1s protein for hematogenous dissemination (11) . The observed nine unique amino acid substitutions on the 1 protein may have a role in conferring thermostability to these strains as specific amino acid residues in 1 have been associated with thermostability in T3-type strains (32) .",

The reproducibility of severe diarrhea and clinical disease with mortality in experimentally infected piglets with isolated MRV3 confirms the pathogenic nature of these strains. Villous blunting is a consistent feature of piglets affected by neonatal diarrhea syndrome (3, 38) . The observed protein casts in the renal tubules and mild hepatic lipidosis could be attributed to the metabolic disorder. The presence of isoleucine at position 249 probably prevented the cleavage of 1 protein by intestinal luminal proteases, enabling efficient viral growth and migration to other tissues (10) compared to the trypsin-sensitive 1 protein (threonine at 249) in endemic T3D type strains with attenuated virulence (39) .

However, with the limited number of bat MRV3 and porcine orthoreovirus sequences available to compare, the epidemiological link remains to be identified. Similarly, a large-scale epidemiological study on the prevalence of this virus in U.S. swine farms with or without diarrhea is warranted to definitively incriminate MRV3 as either the primary causative agent or coagent of the current porcine epidemic diarrhea outbreaks. Continued surveillance and development of preventive and control measures against MRV3 would ease the eco- nomic burden of diarrheal disease in the swine industry.
