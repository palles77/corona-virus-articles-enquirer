A simulation for 2018-2021 demonstrates the sustained impact of this policy. The results show that the number of tourists to Taiwan from China reached its peak in 2015 at 41% and will decrease to 9% by 2021. The corresponding tourism revenue will decrease from 49% to 11% over the same period. The results also show that if the number of tourists from China remains above 836,772, the number of tourists from Japan, Hong Kong, Australasia, North America, and Europe will still increase. However, the number of tourists from South Korea and South and Southeast Asia will increase continuously regardless of tourists from China, even far below 836,772.",

Thus, travel and tourism play important roles in the economic development of some nations, such as Fiji (Aresh, Umar, & Aryan, 2004; Eilat & Einav, 2004) . Fiji, one of the nations in the Pacific region, is a typical tourism nation for tourists from Australia, New Zealand, the US, Canada, the UK, and Japan. The national income for Fiji is not as large as that of other nations. Thus, revenue from tourism is relatively more important than it is for other nations. The tourism revenue for Fiji reached 22% of its GDP in 1998 (Eilat & Einav, 2004) . Similarly, tourism revenue accounted for approximately 32% of total government revenue in 2017 for the Maldives (Statistics & Research Section, Ministry of Tourism, Maldives, 2018) . In 2008, the World Tourism Organization of the United Nations (henceforth UNWTO) predicted that the total number of tourists will reach 1.561 billion by 2020 and that tourism will be one of the major sources of revenue for developing nations (UNWTO (2017) ). Data by UNWTO (2018a) also indicate that tourism in Asia and the Pacific region contributes 25% of the total tourism revenues of all nations.",

            "text": "To determine the relative advantage of each nation's tourism attraction, the Travel & Tourism Competitiveness Index (TTCI) was constructed by the World Economic Forum (WEF, 2007 (WEF, , 2008 (WEF, , 2009 (WEF, , 2010 (WEF, , 2011 (WEF, , 2012 (WEF, , 2013 (WEF, , 2014 . The TTCI is a comprehensive index to calculate each nation's travel and tourism competitiveness. Because the TTCI is a composite index, it is difficult to identify the performance of any specific factor of a sub-index or certain category of the index for a specific nation (Hanafiah & Hemdi, 2016; Joshi, Poudyal, & Larson, 2017; Weaver, Kwek, & Wang, 2017) . Thus, if a certain factor is prominent or important, it must be calculated individually. Studies by Song and Li (2008) have determined the influence of the relative commodity price level on travel and tourism. Other studies have indicated that factors such as the security of the travelling spot, gourmet food, and scenic views are crucial for tourism decisions (C\u00eerstea, 2014; Enright &  Table 1 Total number of tourists from the major nations to Taiwan, 2001 Taiwan, -2017 Year The other four inbound nations are India, Thailand, the Philippines, and Vietnam. We were unable to obtain data on the daily expenditures of these four nations. To be consistent with the presentation for the total daily expenditures in the follow-up analyses, the presentation for the total number of tourists combines these four nations into one group. Newton, 2004) . Marti and Puertas (2016) noted that in Europe, the tourism industry is important for reducing poverty and regional differences. Tourism increases revenues for destination nations. Durbarry and Sinclair (2003) studied tourism demand in France and concluded that Italy, Spain, and Great Britain (henceforth GB) accounted for 60% of outbound tourists to France. Their study further indicated that from 1996 to 2000, the number of tourists to GB decreased by 16%, and tourism revenue for the nation decreased by 9%. In contrast, the number of tourists to Italy and Spain increased by 26% and 19%, respectively, and their tourism revenue increased by 14% and 22%, respectively. This evidence not only shows the consistent change between the number of inbound tourists and the amount of tourism revenue but also demonstrates tourism competition among nations. Thus, each nation uses different ways to attract tourists (Harb & Bassil, 2018; Kozak, Kim, & Chon, 2017; Mar\ufffd akov\ufffd a, Dyr, & Tuzimek, 2016; UNWTO, 2017) .",

Previously, Japan had the largest share of inbound tourists in Taiwan. Tourists from the United States (henceforth the US) were ranked second. However, this situation changed in 2009. The number of inbound tourists from Japan decreased, as did the share of total inbound tourists. A similar situation was observed for inbound tourists from the US. The UNWTO began recording data on tourists from China to Taiwan in 2008. In 2008, there were only 329,000 tourists to Taiwan. Before 2008, only Chinese living overseas, studying abroad, with permanent residency in other nations, or transferring to other nations for business purposes were allowed to travel to Taiwan. There was clearly a change in 2009.",

This number exceeds the number of tourists from many other nations, including Japan and the US, in terms of both the number and the share. This situation reversed in 2016, when the number of tourists from China decreased dramatically from its highest level of 4.2 million in 2015 to 3.5 million in 2016 and further decreased to 2.7 million in 2017. The reason for this significant variation was the implementation of China's Open-door Tourism Policy to Taiwan (hereafter Open-door Policy) in 2008. In 2008, the number of tourists allowed to visit Taiwan was relaxed, but it was tightened in 2016 when the ruling party of the central government in Taiwan changed. Thus, this policy has highly political connotations. It is quite different from regular tourism policies that are designed to limit or attract tourists based on tourists' personal qualifications.",

It is generally believed that an increase in the number of tourists will create more employment opportunities in the travel industry, generate more revenue from the tourism sector, and provide frequent cultural exchanges among nations (Ap & Crompton, 1998; Kwek & Lee; Omkar, Poudyal, & Larson, 2017) . However, these positive impacts may not occur if the number of inbound tourists is less than that stipulated by policies implemented by other nations. That is, if there is a tremendous increase in the number of inbound tourists or a large number of tourists pour into Taiwan and tourism revenue increases due to the Open-door Policy, a decline could occur in the number of tourists and tourism revenues. The changes in the number of Chinese tourists to Taiwan stated above from 2008 to 2015 and to 2017 are obvious evidence.",

However, when the implementation of such a policy is imposed by other nations, it affects the nature of tourism as an action of free movement. For tourists, the selection of destinations is not a free choice but should be approved by home nations. For destination nations, this causes the potential number of inbound tourists and potential tourism revenue to become highly uncertain. As such, improvement in any facility or other factor might not be useful for engaging inbound tourists. This uncertainty could make tourism either change or remain the same for destination nations. For instance, tourists and the associated tourism revenues from other nations might decline due to an increase in the number of tourists from China. Specifically, if the number of inbound tourists declines, this will reduce travel expenditures, and the overall tourism revenue in Taiwan will decrease. However, this pessimistic situation may not occur. An increase in the number of tourists from China might attract more tourists from other nations.",

To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to analyse the change in the number of tourists to Taiwan and tourism revenue under the Open-door Policy. The innovation of this study is that a policy factor imposed by a nation other than Taiwan is included in the EGM. This factor means that the number of tourists to Taiwan is basically controlled by other nations. The analysis in this study not only empirically allows us to identify the impact of a particular factor in the EGM but also scientifically provides deeper insight into tourism management in the EGM.

However, only a few tourists came from many of these nations, and there was no variation over the years. Tourists mainly come from 20 nations, which are the nations used in our analyses: Australia, Canada, China, France, Germany, GB, Hong Kong, Indonesia, India, Italy, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore, Thailand, the Netherlands, the US, the Philippines, and Vietnam. 1 The UNWTO began recording the number of tourists visiting Taiwan from China in 2008. There are no data available from the UNWTO in the number of tourists from China visiting Taiwan before the Open-door Policy (i.e., before 2008). As a result, data on the number of inbound tourists from China during 2001-2007 must be obtained from other sources. The data obtained from the Mainland Affairs Council, Republic of China, Taiwan (2019) and from the Ministry of the Interior National Immigration Agency, Republic of China, Taiwan (2019) are the data used in this study. Table 1 provides the number of inbound tourists to Taiwan for the abovementioned 16 nations and a group of 4 other nations in 2001-2017. Table 1 shows that the number of tourists from China constituted approximately 5.18% of the total tourists visiting Taiwan in 2001 and slightly increased to 7.27% in 2007. In the same period, tourists from Japan constituted 33.28% of tourists in 2001 and 31.62% in 2007. Before China's Open-door Policy, the highest share of tourists visiting Taiwan were from Japan. The share of tourists from Japan and China was basically stable. However, the implementation of the Opendoor Policy in 2008 significantly increased the number of tourists from China, which represented the largest share of inbound tourists in 2010 at 29.29%, the second year after the implementation of the policy. In 2015, the total number of tourists from China reached 4.2 million and constituted 40.54% of tourists. In contrast, the share of tourists from Japan significantly dropped to 17.97%. This policy has completely changed the composition of inbound tourists in Taiwan.",

The estimation of the EGM can determine factors that influence international trade, and the model can be applied to tourism. Park and Jang (2014) used the EGM to analyse 30 nations from 1995 to 2009 and found that the major factors were not only the GDP, population, and distance but also natural and cultural resources, infrastructure for tourism, price competitiveness, and political and policy factors (e.g., the process of applying for a visa). Certain types of infrastructure, such as public transportation, have been included in the gravity model (e.g., Khadaroo and Seetanah's study, 2008) to study their effect on tourists. Moreover, both economic and non-economic factors affect tourism. Vietze (2012) noted that a common culture, such as the same or a similar language, was a decisive factor for the selection of visiting nations.

A similar comparison can be conducted for tourism revenue and its corresponding share to total tourism revenue in the same year for the nations and regions. We find that the actual total number of tourists from China decreases rapidly from its highest point in 2015-2017 (the year for which the most recent data are available) by approximately 35%. If the number of tourists from China continues to decline (as the simulated results indicate it will), the share of tourists from China will decrease to 9% by 2021. The corresponding tourism revenue will then drop from 49% of total tourism revenue in Taiwan in 2015 to 11% in 2021. However, this decline will decrease the number of tourists travelling to Taiwan from some nations and regions but will increase the number of tourists from South Korea and many nations from South and Southeast Asia. That is, the negative effect of suppressing both the number of tourists and tourism revenue from some nations and regions is offset by the positive effect of promoting tourists and tourism revenue from other nations.",

In 2015, the number of tourists from China reached its highest level and its largest share, 41%, of all tourists to Taiwan. However, this policy factor, which has highly political connotations, switched its direction when the ruling party in Taiwan changed in 2016. This policy promoted a large number of tourists to Taiwan. It is important to identify the impact of this policy when operated in opposite directions by China. The impact will reveal not only the number of inbound tourists through competitiveness or complementarity between China and the other 19 major nations visiting Taiwan but also the amount of tourism revenue.",

The results show that if the number of tourists from China is above 836,772, then the number of tourists from the other 19 individual nations or groups of nations will increase. It seems optimistic to have a larger number of tourists from the other nations when there are more tourists from China under its Open-door Policy to Taiwan. However, Taiwan will inevitably be faced with fewer tourists from all other nations (i.e., Japan, Hong Kong, Australasia (New Zealand and Australia), North America (Canada and the US), and Europe (France, Germany, GB, Italy, and the Netherlands)) as China reduces its number of tourists. Among the 19 major nations visiting Taiwan, only tourists from South Korea and from South and Southeast Asia will consistently increase regardless of whether the number of tourists from China is more or less than 836,772. Similar results are found for the change pattern of tourism revenue.",

The results clearly indicate that Taiwan must identify the reason for the increase in tourists from all other nations. To minimize the impact of China's Open-door Policy on the number of tourists from all other nations (regions), the best strategy for Taiwan is to promote different factors to attract tourists from nations other than China. If the current preparation and arrangement of travel and tourism facilities is specifically designed or developed for China due to its large number of inbound tourists, then other nations have the opportunity to use them only incidentally. This makes other nations a spillover beneficiary of travel to Taiwan. This is not an effective way of developing the tourism industry for Taiwan in the long term. Because inbound tourists from different nations have different preferences and tastes for tourism facilities and installations, such as hotels, motels, and public transportation, the preparation of different types of hardware and software facilities suitable for tourists from different nations around the world is essential. Relying on a policy imposed by other nations to bring Taiwan an abundant number of tourists is an unwise and passive decision. The development and improvement of travel and tourism facilities for tourists from different nations is a constructive way to produce a competitive relationship for the number of tourists and tourism revenue between China and other nations.",

First, the distance between the capital of Taiwan and that of a specific country is a proxy variable of travel cost and is constant over time; thus, the model used here, like most other gravity model applications, cannot take into account the effect of travel cost variation for travel and tourism to different destinations. If data for flight routes to different destinations are available, the travel costs from the gasoline use of aircrafts travelling at different times to different nations might replace the current constant distance variable between the capitals of nations. If this is possible, the creation of this variable requires high demands for data. Second, the estimated coefficients of variables in the conventional gravity model only present the mean effects for tourist numbers and fail to capture out-of-average differentiations. An advanced method, such as quantile regression, is a possible solution to this problem and could be used in future research.",
