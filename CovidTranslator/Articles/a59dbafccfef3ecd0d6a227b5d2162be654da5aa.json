Results IBV virus-like particles (VLPs) were generated through the co-infection with three recombinant baculoviruses separately encoding M, E or the recombinant S genes. The recombinant S protein was sufficiently flexible to retain the ability to selfassemble into VLPs. The size and morphology of the VLPs were similar to authentic IBV particles. In addition, the immunogenicity of IBV VLPs had been investigated. The results demonstrated that the efficiency of the newly generated VLPs was comparable to that of the inactivated M41 viruses in eliciting IBVspecific antibodies and neutralizing antibodies in chickens via subcutaneous inoculation.",

Not surprisingly most new vaccine candidates against IBV are S1-targeted (Chen et al. 2010; Shil et al. 2011; Lin et al. 2012) . Both M and E proteins are critical factors in virion assembly and budding and interactions between the two seem to be the minimum requirements for coronavirus VLP (virus-like particles) formation (Vennema et al. 1996; Masters 2006; Masters et al. 2006 ). The S protein, however, is was not essential but is incorporated into VLP by interactions with the M protein when present (Ho et al. 2004; Bosch et al. 2005) .",

            "text": "IBV is responsible for an acute and contagious upper-respiratory tract disease in commercial chickens and is a severe economic burden on the poultry industry worldwide. Vaccination with live attenuated or inactivated vaccines is still the most effective way to control IBV. Unfortunately, current vaccines are unable to provide chickens with sufficient protection because of the limitations of traditional vaccines and multiple serotypes of epidemic IBV strains. Consequently, it is essential to find a feasible way for developing a more safe and effective vaccine strategy. Compared with either whole-virus vaccines or recombinant subunit vaccines, VLPs have some prominent advantages to become promising vaccine candidates. As they lack viral genetic material, VLPs are noninfective and thus are safe. Furthermore, VLPs are highly immunogenic due to their structure being similar to authentic viruses with highly repetitive antigenic epitopes (Kushnir et al. 2012) . Although there has been some research on coronavirus VLPs, few studies have focused on IBV. Therefore, in this work novel IBV VLPs have been constructed through the co-infection with three recombinant baculoviruses separately expressing M, E and the recombinant S protein containing the S1 subunit fused to the transmembrane domain and the cytoplasmic tail (TM/CT) of S2 subunit. Additionally, as a vaccine to inoculate specific-pathogen-free chickens, the humoral immunity was evaluated.",

While the S protein is dispensable, it can be incorporated when present. However, there are still some controversies concerning the mechanism of coronavirus VLPs Fig. 4 Characterization of IBV VLPs. a Electron microscopy analysis of VLPs. The formation of IBV VLPs from Sf9 cells coinfected with rBV-rS, rBV-M and rBV-E was examined by an electron microscope after the VLPs-included culture media were purified by ultra-centrifugation with a discontinuous sucrose density gradient. The visible VLPs were similar to authentic IBV particles in size and spherical morphology. Bar = 100 nm. b Western blot analysis of VLPs. Lane 1: purified VLPs samples. Lane 2: purified culture media from cells co-infected by rBV-M and rBV-E with the only difference that rBV-rS was absent. Lane 3: negative control samples from cells infected with wBV. Chicken-derived anti-IBV hyperimmune serum was used to detect the viral proteins. The results demonstrate that when rS and E proteins are co-expressed with M protein, all the three viral proteins can be detected in culture media by the formation of VLPs. In addition, the total protein concentration of purified VLPs samples was determined by a modified Bradford protein assay kit; and the amount of rS protein presented in the VLPs samples was estimated by densitometry of Coomassie Blue-stained SDS-PAGE gel with BSA as standard (data not shown). The percent of rS protein in the VLPs was calculated as 28.4 % (w/w) formation although it widely accepted that the existence of the major antigen is critical for the successful design of a genetic-engineered vaccine. In view of these considerations, IBV VLPs were assembled through co-infection with three recombinant baculoviruses separately encoding M, E or the recombinant S genes.",

            "text": "A recombinant S protein was used in current research rather than the traditional whole S protein, as a consequence of the following considerations. The S1 protein is sufficient to elicit good protective immunity against IBV (Cavanagh 2007; Lin et al. 2012) . The incorporation of coronavirus S protein into VLPs is closely related to the interactions between the TM/CT domain of S protein and the CT domain of M protein, (de Haan et al. 1999; Bosch et al. 2005) . In addition, the heterologous expression of the fulllength S protein is difficult as it is a large protein (180 kDa) with intensive hydrophobicity and is highly glycosylated. Accordingly, a recombinant S protein was constructed with a flexible peptide inserted between the two elements to keep their own structures and functions. Moreover, it would be convenient to replace the S1 subunit with other foreign epitopes or target molecules when exploiting this newly establised VLP as an universal platform.",

However, the former was the more accepted strategy in the current study because co-infection is flexible for further comprehensive studies on the molecular and dynamic mechanism of VLP formation. In addition, the present study demonstrated that IBV VLPs could elicit robust humoral immune responses in specific-pathogen-free chickens that were comparable to the inactivated M41 viruses. More importantly, after booster vaccination, the VLPs even induced slightly higher neutralizing antibody titers than the inactivated M41 viruses (p [ 0.05). This was mainly due to the S1 subunit that was carrying most of the neutralizing epitopes, and part of S proteins in M41, had lost their native structures during inactivation. This result further confirmed the incorporation of the modified S protein in VLPs.",

Some higher but not statistically different levels of IBV-specific antibody titers were detected both in VLPs and the inactivated M41 groups after the initial vaccination (day 14) as compared to the control group (p [ 0.05). The antibody titers of the two experimental groups increased notably after the booster vaccination (day 28) and were very significantly higher than that of the control group (p \\ 0.01). In addition, the levels of antibody titers in chickens that after the booster vaccinated with VLPs and inactivated M41 viruses were significantly higher in contrast to that after the initial vaccination (p \\ 0.05). Data represent the mean antibody titer \u00b1 SD for 20 chickens. b IBVneutralizing antibody titers detected in sera. After booster vaccination (day 28), the neutralizing antibody titers in each group of chickens were detected by a virus neutralization test performed on chicken embryos. IBV VLPs were competent to elicit considerable neutralizing antibodies comparable to that of the inactivated M41 viruses, and the antibody titers of the both groups were significantly higher in contrast with that of the negative control group (p \\ 0.01). Neutralizing antibody titer was calculated as the reciprocal of the highest serum dilution that neutralized 50 % of 10 2 EID50 of viruses in SPF chicken embryos humoral immune responses in chicken have been investigated. The findings demonstrate that the modified S protein is sufficiently flexible to retain the ability to self-assemble into VLPs. The VLPs may serve as a promising strategy to control IBV. This work provides basic information for the mechanism of IBV VLP formation and develops a platform for further design of IBV VLP-based vaccines against IBV or other viruses.",
