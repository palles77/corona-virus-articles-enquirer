            "text": "The constant evolution of the influenza virus favors genetic variability and transmission to other species. Interspecies transmission of influenza viruses is a difficult process because there are barriers that hinder infection; however, diverse factors such as population growth and consumption habits have reduced these barriers by increasing contact among species. 1 Antigenic drift and antigenic shift generate structural changes in the virus and allow evolution and variability, 2 thereby encouraging infection and adaptation in different animal species. 3 The clinical disease associated with the influenza virus in dogs has only been recently observed. In 2004, an equine-origin subtype H3N8 influenza A virus was isolated from dogs with respiratory disease, 4 and, in 2008, an avian-origin subtype (H3N2) was also isolated. 5 Subsequently, the circulation of these subtypes has been documented in the canine population in diverse countries. [6] [7] [8] [9] The influenza virus in these animals can lead to health problems related to respiratory syndromes and complications due to bacteria, and although horizontal transmission among dogs has been demonstrated, the rate of infection does not appear to be altered by age, breed, or sex. 10, 11 In their respiratory tract, dogs possess specific receptors for infection with human and avian influenza viruses, 12 thereby suggesting that dogs could play an important role in interspecies transmission of different subtypes of influenza A virus. Although no transmission of the virus from dogs to humans has been reported, dogs could represent a new bridging species for the infection. 13 There is serological evidence of the presence of subtypes H1N1 and H3N2 of human influenza virus in dogs; a virus similar to subtype H1N1pdm09 of humans has also been isolated from dogs. 14, 15 In 2012, a new subtype H3N1 was identified as a result of reassortment in the canine genes of human H1N1pdm09 and canine H3N2 influenza viruses. 16 The possible transmission of influenza A virus between dogs and humans is important, as in Mexico City there are approximately 1\u00c12 million dogs, of which 1 million live in close contact with humans and other animals. 17 The objective of this study was to identify the presence of antibodies against influenza A virus in dogs and their owners, as well as the presence of RNA of influenza A virus in nasal exudates of dogs and, thereby, assess the possible transmission of the virus between humans and dogs.",

Between July and November 2012, 113 blood samples were collected from household dogs in Mexico City, as well as a blood sample from each owner. We used the Cannon and Roe 18 formula to calculate the sample size and taking as reference the seroprevalence reported in previous studies for canine influenza in other countries 10, 19 and human influenza virus in dogs. 15 Age, breed, and sex of the dog were not considered as exclusion or inclusion criteria. Seventeen nasal exudate samples were also collected from dogs with suggestive signs of respiratory disease. A sterile cotton swab was used to collect the sample from each animal, and the swabs were immediately placed in 1 ml of transport medium at 4\u00b0C after sampling. ",

Double serial dilutions were made from 1:10 to 1:1240; the titer of the antibodies inhibiting hemagglutination was expressed as the maximal dilution at which the serum inhibited the hemagglutination activity of the virus. Sera were considered positive starting at the 1:40 dilution.

In addition, we gathered information specific to the owners that included age, gender, and vaccination status in the last 6 months against human influenza virus. The collected information was analyzed using contingency tables. An independent test was performed to determine the association between seropositivity to the equine subtypes in dogs and predisposing factors, such as age (>2 years, <2 years), sex (male, female), and whether the dog constantly remains in the home (yes, no). We also evaluated the seropositivity against human subtypes in the dogs (positive, negative) and compared this to the seropositivity of their respective owners (positive, negative), to analyze the role of cohabitation of dogs and humans as a possible factor for infection.",

In Mexico, the presence of antibodies in horses against different isolates of the subtype H3N8 equine influenza virus has been reported 24 ; comparatively, variation in the hemagglutinin gene of this virus has been reported in isolations performed before 1992. 6 It can be assumed that, in Mexico, something similar occurred in the equine influenza virus and, therefore, dog sera do not present antibodies against old isolates of this subtype due to antigenic drift. Seropositivity in dogs against subtype H3N8 A/equine/ Kentucky/97 was 4%. Anderson et al. 20 discussed that contemporary subtypes of equine and canine influenza viruses are phylogenetically close and therefore can be used as diagnostic antigens. The positive results in dogs suggest that interspecies transmission of the equine influenza virus has occurred. Seroprevalence of the equine influenza virus was low, but similar to that in studies with pet dogs from other countries 10, 25, 26 where canine and equine influenza subtypes were used. The low seropositivity could be explained by the fact that we analyzed pet dogs, because prevalence of canine influenza in dogs held in canine control shelters has been reported to be up to 42%, and the only associated factor was the number of permanent days in the shelter. 27 Seroprevalence in these dogs against the three subtypes of human influenza (H1N1pdm09, H1N1, and H3N2) was 0\u00c19%. This is similar to that reported by Dundon et al., 15 who found a 0\u00c17% seroprevalence in dog sera that were collected during the circulation time of the H1N1pdm09 human influenza virus. Damiani et al. 28 also found a 0\u00c113% seroprevalence against the H1N1pdm09 human influenza virus. Our results differ from prevalence data found in Brazil, 9 which was 15\u00c127%, but this study was against an isolate of an old human influenza virus, and not the 2009 variant, which could explain the difference in the proportion of positive results. The percentage of seropositivity against the H1N1pdm09 human influenza virus detected in the owners is similar to other reports (39% and 33%) from previous studies performed in Mexico. 29, 30 Circulation of subtype H1N1 among dog owners was not associated with their vaccination status, thereby suggesting that dogs were in contact with the human influenza virus and that there is interspecies transmission.",

Therefore, we can assume that the observed seropositivity in dog owners does not pose a risk for seropositivity against human influenza in their dogs. However, subtypes H1N1pdm09 and H1N1 of human influenza are infecting dogs and their owners. There may be factors directly associated with the infection, but these have not yet been studied. We did not find any nasal exudates positive to RNA of human influenza A virus. In previous studies 4, 6, 16, 31 performed in other countries, isolates were obtained from samples of dogs with severe respiratory clinical signs. The disease is probably not frequently presented by dogs in Mexico or the number of dogs that are infected is low, and consequently, the number of dogs that develop the disease is also low.
