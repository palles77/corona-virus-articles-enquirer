Sixty-three fecal samples from diarrheic calves were collected from November 1999 to May 2000 and screened by LAT, the Rotazyme II enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and virus isolation (VI) followed by an anti-rotavirus fluorescent-antibody (FA) test to detect the presence of group A rotavirus antigen. Of the 63 samples screened by VI-FA, 33 (58%) tested positive for rotavirus antigen. When the results from the LAT were compared to those from VI-FA, the \"gold standard\" for detection of bovine rotavirus in fecal samples, the sensitivity and specificity were found to be 87.8 and 73.3%, respectively. Latex agglutination compared with ELISA (the reference method) showed 100% sensitivity and 96.3% specificity, and when ELISA was compared with VI, the sensitivity was 84.8% and the specificity was 73.3%. Latex agglutination is easy to perform in a short time and does not require expensive equipment or skilled personnel, and the reagents have long shelf lives. These factors make the LAT suitable and highly efficient for use in a clinical laboratory as a rapid screening test for bovine rotavirus.",

The classification of rotaviruses into serotypes is based on the identification of two outer proteins, VP4 and VP7 (16, 19) . Both VP4 and VP7 elicit the production of neutralizing antibodies shown to be protective against bovine rotavirus (BRV) infection in vivo and in vitro (4, 7, 9) . VP7 serotypes (G types) can now be identified by enzyme immunoassay incorporating VP7-specific neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (16, 18) .",

Commercial ELISAs, such as the Rotazyme II kit, are available for the routine diagnostic screening of large numbers of specimens. This kit is sensitive for the detection of rotavirus from several mammalian species, many of which possess the group A antigen, which is detected by Rotazyme II capture antibody. Most of the kits available on the market are designed primarily for humans and are not approved for veterinary diagnostic applications. We limited this evaluation of antigen detection to the use of ELISA and the LAT. The LAT is ideal for the number of specimens we receive daily to test for RNA viruses. ELISA is also good for laboratories handling large numbers of specimens on a daily basis; however, it is less sensitive than latex agglutination.",

Because low numbers of viruses can be amplified with repeated passages, VI is more sensitive than latex agglutination and ELISA. VI is routinely performed in most veterinary diagnostic laboratories, but some have difficulty growing BRV in tissue culture. The virus can be propagated in primary EBK cells; however, this is time-consuming, as it takes from 3 to 8 days for a cytopathic effect to develop for each passage.",

We found that the sensitivity and specificity of the kit were dependent on which test it was compared with. For example, the Virogen Rotavirus kit showed higher sensitivity than ELISA (87.8 versus 84.8%) and specificity equal to that of ELISA (73.3%) when both commercial kits were compared with VI-FA. We expected the commercial kits to show higher sensitivity and specificity, since both are used for the detection of BRV. This may have been due to the low affinities of detecting antibodies or a low number of virus particles present in the specimen. One specimen was positive by the LAT and VI but negative by ELISA. This suggests the presence of nonspecific factors interfering with ELISA. The higher sensitivity of the LAT may have also been a factor. Four specimens were negative by both ELISA and latex agglutination but positive by VI. This may be due to a low number of virus particles, which is not easy to detect by the LAT or ELISA. Eight specimens were positive by both the LAT and ELISA but negative by VI. The failure of VI may be due to inactivation of virus caused by contamination with bacteria and fungi and exposure to the physical and the chemical environment after specimen collection and during transport to the laboratory.",

Both the LAT and ELISA are more sensitive than EM, and these assays take less time than VI (3, 6) . The LAT showed higher sensitivity (87.8%) than ELISA (84.8%), while the specificity of the LAT correlates with that of ELISA. In addition, the LAT has the advantage that it can be read with the naked eye, making it easy to perform in every laboratory. Management of diarrheal diseases demands rapid, accurate diagnosis; therefore, the use of the LAT to detect viral antigen from diluted fecal samples is a good alternative to both VI and ELISA.",
