Objectives: The purpose of this paper is to propose a PPE calculation system to help hospitals to decide their PPE stockpile. Methods: We searched influenza guidelines from a number of countries and research papers on protective devices and infectious diseases. The PPE calculation system included factors such as the influenza pandemic period, risk classification by health care workers (HCW) type, and the type and number of PPE for a HCW per day. Results: We concluded that 4 sets of PPE (N95 respirators, double gloves, gowns, and goggles) per day should be prepared for HCWs in a high-risk group. Similarly, 2 sets of appropriate PPE, depending on the risk level, are required for medium-and low-risk groups. In addition, 2 surgical masks are required for every worker and inpatient and 1 for each outpatient. The PPE stockpile should be prepared to cover at least an 8-week pandemic. Conclusion: Purchasing a PPE stockpile requires a sizable budget. The PPE calculation system in this paper will hopefully support hospitals in deciding their PPE stockpile.",

Above all, the Spanish flu, which suddenly broke out in Western Europe during World War I, caused the worst damage: 40 million deaths and 600 million infected people all over the world and 380 thousand deaths and 23 million infected people in Japan. 1 No major influenza pandemic has occurred since the beginning of the 21st Century; however, a pandemic might be imminent because it is known that influenza pandemics usually repeat within 10 to 40 years, and 40 years have already passed since the last pandemic: ''Hong Kong flu.'' In addition, development of transportation such as commercial flights in recent years makes it easy for infections to spread over seas. Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003 was a good example of this.",

The purpose of this paper is to establish a calculation system to decide the appropriate PPE stockpile in each hospital setting based on factors such as the influenza pandemic period, risk classification by the HCW type, and the type and number of PPE required for HCWs per day. In addition, we investigated the average number for each HCW in hospital settings in Japan classified by the location and scale of hospitals so that PPE can be calculated from only the location and scale of hospitals. Finally, as an example, the stockpile of PPE needed for a sample hospital with 300 beds in Tokyo is shown using this system. ",

We suppose that 20 pairs of gloves/doctor (high risk)/day will be required because 1 SARS report showed that 1 doctor can treat 5 to 10 patients per day from the view of infection control. 21 Furthermore, the use of masks by patients is also important to block virus transmission. The US Department of Labor indicates that 1 surgical mask per day is necessary for outpatients and 2 for inpatients. 5 All medical and nonmedical workers in the hospital, such as doctors, nurses, medical technologists, pharmacists, caregivers who provide critical care or spiritual care, respiratory therapists, reprocessors of reusable medical devices, and cafeteria workers, in addition to the family members and visitors, also require at least 2 surgical masks per day.
