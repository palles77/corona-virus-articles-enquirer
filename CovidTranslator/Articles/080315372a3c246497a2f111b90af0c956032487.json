Alternatively, they arise from a known disease expressed atypically through unusual clinical signs, atypical region or species, or increased severity. An atypical case can also result from the detection of a rare or inadequately documented sporadic disease.

First, the activity and number of participating veterinarians can be evaluated by quantifying indicators such as number of entries submitted, number of atypical cases entered, and participants' levels of accessing posted results. Moreover, all systems include reference diseases or symptoms for which descriptive statistics are available, which can serve to check quality recording (e.g., babesiosis in the \"\u00e9mergences\" pilot study). In addition, the likelihood of detecting an emerging event is high. Many rare diseases are not defined in cattle, so a dedicated information system should detect >1 unexpected event over the test period. For example, the initial \"\u00e9mergences\" pilot found 3 sets of clinical signs not linked to a known disease (persistent, ultimately fatal paraplegia, without general clinical signs [ Figure] ; weight loss, depilation at the extremities leading to death; and congenital cataract neither linked to bovine virus diarrhea nor familial history) and 1 rare known syndrome (facial eczema). Finally, the decision to extend a detection system will depend largely on the interest veterinarians hold and on the inclusion of new diseases as a national surveillance objective (6, 34) .",

For pets and zoo animals, tools similar to the ones proposed can be adapted because these animals are regularly seen by veterinarians. Wildlife can be a source of new farm animal or human diseases and is affected by many farm animal diseases (Table 1) . Thus, all observations of health problems in wildlife can potentially contribute relevant information for human or domestic animal populations (37) . However, the ability to closely monitor clinical signs is lacking. Death rate is the most feasible way to monitor wildlife health and has indeed been the detection trigger of many emerging diseases (38) . Testing sampled healthy animals for a set of diseases is another strategy, but few disease surveillance programs not targeted at specific diseases are in place (e.g., \"marine mammal strandings\" project in United Kingdom [39] ). One of the key challenges remains to bring professional and amateur outdoorsmen to report wildlife health observations through an information system flexible enough to encompass all species and situations. New forms dedicated to wildlife with appropriate location (instead of client or farm) could be added to the information systems already adapted to several species (VetPAD and \"\u00e9mergences\"). Alternatives such as monitoring risk factors for emergence (e.g., encroachment of habitats), as well as minimizing contact between domestic and wild species by good, onfarm biosecurity, could reduce the likelihood of new domestic animal or human diseases emerging from wildlife reservoirs. In all cases, approaches must seek to increase collaboration among wildlife and domestic animals health workers to break down traditional boundaries between fields.",

If successful, this effort will also define the \"normal\" clinical baseline for syndromes and rare diseases, allowing statistical confirmation that an atypical syndrome is emerging. In addition to building new information technologies, early disease identification with timely responses requires synergy across a group of partners, including those who traditionally interact in animal health management as well as in public health (40) and across geopolitical boundaries. Although human and animal worlds remain fairly separated, initiatives are narrowing this separation. For instance, integration of emerging animal disease surveillance systems with those in the human arena is proposed in the UK's \"RADAR\" veterinary surveillance information management system (41) . Furthermore, during the \"\u00e9mergences\" test phase, the Health National Institute agreed to cooperate in the event an animal issue with potential public health implications was identified. Finally, the most relevant challenge is to promote joint human-animal projects concerning potentially common emerging diseases, such as the avianporcine-human influenza complex. Effective combination of such emerging disease surveillance systems would result in earlier identification of potential issues, providing opportunity for quicker response. ",

Sandia National Laboratories designed and developed the original RSVP surveillance system, a system with applications in both human and animal disease surveillance. Sandia National Laboratories and New Mexico State University/New Mexico Department of Agriculture are primary collaborators, along with Kansas State University, on the RSVP-A project that has been jointly pursued since 2003. The opinions on RSVP-A in this article do not necessary reflect all of the project's collaborating parties. Dr Vourc'h obtained her veterinary degree from the National Veterinary School of Alfort (ENVA) and her PhD in ecology and evolutionary biology in Montpellier (France). Her current research interests include detection and analyses of emerging animal diseases and the epidemiology and ecology of tickborne diseases.",
