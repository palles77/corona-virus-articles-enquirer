            "text": "The uptake of L-ascorbic acid (vitamin C) by astrocytes was studied using primary cultures prepared from the neopallium of newborn Swiss CD-1 mice or Sprague-Dawley rats. Initial uptake rates were significantly greater in mouse than in rat astrocytes. Exposure of cultures to 0.25 mM dibutyryl cyclic AMP for 2 weeks changed cell morphology from polygonal to stellate and stimulated ascorbate uptake, with the greatest stimulation occurring in mouse astrocytes. Uptake was specific for the vitamin since it was not diminished by the presence of other organic anions including acetate, formate, lactate, malonate, oxalate, p-aminohippurate, pyruvate and succinate. Ascorbate uptake was Na*-dependent but did not have a specific requirement for external CI-(Cl-o). Substitution of CI-o by Br-or NO3-decreased ascorbate uptake rates by 20-31%; whereas substitution by gluconate or isethionate increased uptake by 20-31%. Ascorbate transport by astroglial cultures from both animal species was rapidly (-<1 min) and reversibly inhibited by the anion transport inhibitors furosemide, 4-acetamido-4'-isothiocyanostilbene-2,2'-disulfonic acid (SITS) and 4,4'diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2'-disulfonic acid (DIDS). The rapid and reversible effects of the impermeant inhibitors (SITS and DIDS) are consistent with direct inhibition of ascorbate transporters Iocated in the astroglial plasma membrane.",

            "text": "Ascorbic acid (vitamin C) is absorbed by the intestine or synthesized by the liver and then delivered through the bloodstream to the brain (1, 2) . The vitamin is essential for brain function because it is a cofactor in catecholamine biosynthesis (3) , facilitiates release of transmitters (4) (5) (6) , modulates binding of ligands to neural receptors (7) (8) (9) , and slows rates of transmitter clearance (10) (11) (12) . There is evidence that ascorbate is actively transported in rat cerebral cortex (13) and that brain cells regulate the extracellular concentration of vitamin C (14) . Ascorbate accumulation in cerebral astrocytes is saturable, stereoselective and Na+-dependent (15) . Rose (2) i Department of Physiology and 2Division of Oral Biology, University\" of Western Ontario, London, Ontario, Canada, N6A 5C1 1169 has argued, however, that saturation kinetics may not arise necessarily from uptake of ascorbate by a plasma membrane transport system. Instead, substrate may simply diffuse across the plasma membrane, followed by rate-limiting enzymatic conversion to an impermeant species or carrier-mediated uptake into a subcellular compartment. Thus, it is not yet clear if a saturable ascorbate transport system exists in the plasma membrane of astrocytes.",

Na+-dependent ascorbate transport has been observed in several tissues (2) , including astrocytes (15) , and is thought to represent Na+-anion cotransport. In bovine pigmented ciliary epithelium the contransporter is electrogenic and appears to carry two Na + with each ascorbate molecule (17) . There also is evidence of Cl--ascorbate exchange across corneal membranes in an amphibian species (18) . In astrocytes it is not known if ascorbate competes with other anions for a common transport site. Direct inhibitors of ascorbate transport, which would be useful for studying the location and mechanism of the vitamin C carrier, have never been identified previously.",
