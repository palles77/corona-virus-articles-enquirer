Microarray techniques show promise in this regard, as their high throughput nature can potentially detect a range of viruses using a single test. In this paper we present an array that can detect a wide spectrum of 169 plant virus species from 13 different genera. The array was constructed using an automated probe design protocol which generated a minimal number of probes to detect viruses at the genus level. The designed arrays showed a high specificity and sensitivity when tested with a set of standard virus samples. Field samples collected from a severe disease outbreak of Panax notoginseng farms in Yunnan, China, in 2001 were screened, where a potyvirus infection was identified associated with the disease.",

Choices were made based on these standards: (i) the official quarantine viruses in China, (ii) viruses infecting a wide range of plants with high economic value and whose infections cause significant economic losses, (iii) viruses not detected previously by microarray. For example, Bean pod mottle virus (BPMV) is a member of the genus Comovirus in the family Comoviridae. It is one of the most damaging pathogen of Fabacaeae plants and responsible for severe loss to soybean, kidney bean and cowpea. BPMV may cause up to 85% loss in mixed infection with Soybean mosaic virus (SBMV) (Giesler et al., 2002) . BPMV is an important official quarantine virus in China and can be detected by ELISA and RT-PCR (Gu et al., 2002; Joisson et al., 1993) , but no microarray-based method has been reported for its detection. Thus Comovirus was studied in this investigation.",

Six of the virus genera have multipartite genomes; the other 7, monopartite genomes. Since the positive strand RNA of ssRNA negative strand viruses exist in the host total RNA, the positive strand sequences of these viruses were used to design probes. The fulllength genome sequences were used to design conserved probes for all genera except the genus Capillovirus. As the number of fulllength genomic sequences for this genus was less than 5 in the database, partial genomic nucleotide sequences were included to determine the conserved probes. A total of 286 viral sequences representing 169 virus species of 13 viral genera were used to design the conserved probes. Additionally 148,537 viral genome sequences and 57,512 plant mRNA sequences were used to identify off-target hybridizations.",

Seventy nucleotide segments offset by 5 nt were selected from the highest conserved regions. The 70mers were filtered by (i) GC content between 40% and 60%, (ii) <5 continuous mononucleotides (PolyX), and (iii) <8 nt inner hairpin. The 70mers were then aligned to the viral sequences in the virus genus, and the off-target database by pair-wise BLASTN. It has been reported previously that 70mers with \u226585% similarity and \u226515 nt continuous base pairing with the target sequence are sufficient to generate a detectable signal (He et al., 2005) . Thus these cutoffs were set as the threshold in the probe-viral sequence pairing. The off-target probe pairing was set as \u226425 nt base pairing with the other viruses or plant mRNA sequences. Probes identified with offtarget probe pairing were removed from the dataset.",

One probe was added to the seed each time to maximize the coverage of the genus. The search was finished when all the viral sequences in the genus were covered by the probes, or the size of the set reached 15. The seed searching was repeated three times so that most viruses in the genus were detected by three probes. If less than three probes were selected in the current conserved region, the probe selection was repeated using the lower ranked conserved regions. The whole probe design protocol is implemented in Perl, and can be provided upon request. After the probes were selected, a pair-wise BLASTN alignment was performed among the probes and the viral sequences in the genus.

None of the closest viruses, e.g. the unclassified viruses identified in P. notoginseng, Angelica virus Y, and Carrot virus Y, had published genomic sequences. Thus no sequence from these viruses was used to design the conserved probes for the genus Potyvirus in the microarray. It suggests that the detection microarray system does not need prior knowledge of newly emerged viruses, thus it will not be limited by selection of specific primer sequences (i.e. PCR) or antibodies (i.e. ELISA). This test highlights the potential use of the microarray in detecting newly emerging plant viruses.

            "text": "In conclusion, we have developed a 70mer oligonucleotide microarray for detection and identification of 13 genera of plant viruses. This microarray detected the largest number of plant virus genera reported so far. We also aimed to use a minimal number of probes, thus minimizing the cost and probe redundancy of the microarray. The microarray platform developed in this study illustrated the feasibility of detecting a wide range of plant viruses at the genus level, and can be used to detect unknown emerging viruses. This technology can be applied to other plant and vertebrate virus genera. This diagnostic tool will certainly have an important use for discovery and identification of plant viruses.",
