In this study, we developed biodegradable PLGA [poly(D,L-lactide-co-glycolide)] nanoparticle-entrapped killed PRRSV vaccine (Nano-KAg), and administered intranasally to pigs once and evaluated the immune correlates. In Nano-KAg vaccinated homologous virus challenged pigs, complete clearance of viremia was observed in 2 weeks, associated with a significant increase in virus neutralizing titers only in the lungs, compared to both unvaccinated and killed vaccine vaccinated pigs. The lung homogenate and sera of Nano-KAg vaccinated pigs had higher levels of IFN-g and lower levels of TGF-b than control groups. Restimulation of mononuclear cells isolated from the lungs, blood, BAL, and TBLN of Nano-KAg vaccinated pigs' secreted significantly increased levels of Th1 cytokines, IFN-g and IL-12. In addition, higher frequencies of CD3 + CD8 + , CD4 + CD8 + , and gd T cells, and reduced frequency of Foxp3 + T-regulatory cells were observed in Nano-KAg vaccinated pigs. Thus, intranasal delivery of Nano-KAg vaccine may be a suitable strategy to elicit anti-PRRSV immune response required to better clear viremia in pigs.",

            "text": "PRRSV modulates the pig immune system as early as two-days, and continues several weeks post-infection (Dwivedi et al., 2012; Mateu and Diaz, 2008) . In PRRSV infected pigs production of an important Th1 cytokine IFNg is delayed and in reduced amounts. The immune modulation caused by PRRSV is attributed to virusmediated suppression of host IFN-a production (Albina et al., 1998) . In addition, the virus helps in induction of Veterinary Microbiology 166 (2013) [47] [48] [49] [50] [51] [52] [53] [54] [55] [56] [57] [58] secretion of interleukin (IL)-10 and transforming growth factor-b (TGF-b), and upregulation of Foxp3 + T-regulatory cells (Tregs) (Silva-Campa et al., 2012) . Virus neutralizing (VN) antibody is important for viral clearance, but the role of VN antibodies in clearing the PRRSV in infected pigs is unclear (Diaz et al., 2005) . However, passive transfer of VN antibodies has shown to provide protection against PRRSV challenge (Osorio et al., 2002) . To control PRRS outbreaks modified live PRRSV vaccine (PRRS-MLV) is widely used and it confers protection against homologous virus, but incomplete protection against reinfections and heterologous viruses (Mengeling et al., 2003) . There are limitations of PRRS-MLV, as there are reports of appearance of revertant vaccine virus in certain pigs (Li et al., 2009; Mengeling et al., 2002; Nielsen et al., 2001) . Available killed vaccines are safe, but their efficacy is poor (Bassaganya-Riera et al., 2004; Charerntantanakul, 2009; Piras et al., 2005) . Stimulating the immune system systemically results mainly in systemic protection with low mucosal immune responses. In contrast, optimum stimulation of the mucosal immune system provides both mucosal and systemic immunity, resulting in inhibition of entry of pathogens into the body (Holmgren et al., 1992) . Nanotechnology based vaccine delivery system is an innovation of the 21st century (Panyam and Labhasetwar, 2003) . Nanoparticles offer the advantage of increasing the efficiency of drug and vaccine delivery, and also possess adjuvant properties (Gupta et al., 1998) . Poly(D,Llactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) nanoparticle-mediated delivery of vaccines has shown to be effective in eliciting protective immune response, administered by either mucosal and systemic routes (Eldridge et al., 1989; Spiers et al., 2000) . PLGA is biocompatible, biodegradable, and protects the entrapped vaccine from proteases mediated degradation at mucosal surfaces; and it is a FDA approved agent (Lu et al., 2009) . PLGA helps in sustained release of entrapped vaccine, and thus limits the need of booster doses (Thomasin et al., 1996) . Therefore, the goal of this study was to develop PLGA nanoparticleencapsulated PRRSV killed vaccine and investigate its efficacy in pigs vaccinated by intranasal route. Our results suggest that our strategy has the potential to generate anti-PRRSV immune response and in better clearance of viremia.",

Briefly, single cell suspensions (PBMC, LMNC, BAL, TBLN and ILN) were resuspended in fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) buffer and plated (1 \u00c2 10 6 ) in U-bottom 96-well plates and treated with 2% pig serum to block the Fc receptors. Cells were treated with fluorochrome tagged, purified, or biotin labeled pig specific mAbs, CD3e, CD172 (Southern Biotech), CD4a, CD8a/b, CD11c (BD Biosciences), CD25, TcR1N4 (VMRD), SLAII (Serotech), Foxp3 (eBioscience) or their respective isotype control mAb. Cells were washed and treated with streptavidin-conjugated fluorochrome or respective anti-species isotype specific secondary antibody conjugated with fluorochrome. Finally, cells were fixed and washed in FACS buffer. For intracellular Foxp3 staining, the cells were stained first for cell surface CD4 and CD25, and then treated with permeabilization buffer (PBS containing 0.1% Saponin and 3% Formaldehyde) and stained with fluorochrome-conjugated pig Foxp3 cross-reactive anti-rat Foxp3 mAb. Immunostained cells were acquired using a FACS Aria II (BD Biosciences) flow cytometer. The analysis was done to determine different immune cell populations based on the phenotypes: T-helper cells (CD3 + CD4 + CD8 \u00c0 ); CD8 + T cells (CD3 + CD4 \u00c0 CD8 + ); T-helper/memory cells (CD3 + CD4 + CD8 + ); gd T cells (CD8a + TcR1N4 + ); T-regulatory cells (CD4 + CD25 + Foxp3 + ); CD172 + (myeloid cells); and CD172 + CD11 C + SLAII + (dendritic cells rich fraction), analyzed using FlowJo software (Tree Star Inc., OR, USA). Frequencies of individual immune cells were analyzed from a total 50,000 events.",

We used the VR2332 strain which was passaged several times ($50) in vitro, and the lack of obvious clinical disease may have been due to attenuation. Macroscopically, typical PRRS lung lesions were not very distinct; therefore, in this paper we did not make any comparative lung lesion analyses, but reported the comprehensive immunological data in relation to viremia. PRRSV neutralizing antibodies protect pigs against viremia, virus replication in the lungs, and transplacental spread of the virus (Lopez et al., 2007; Lopez and Osorio, 2004) , but the commercial killed vaccines induce negligible VN antibody response (Bassaganya-Riera et al., 2004; Vanhee et al., 2009) . A study demonstrated that it is possible to elicit increased VN titers to a killed PRRSV vaccine by inactivating the virus using UV or binary ethylenimine and by coadministering the vaccine with a potent adjuvant (Vanhee et al., 2009) . In that study amount of inactivated PRRSV in each vaccine dose was 1 \u00c2 10 8 TCID 50 (Vanhee et al., 2009) . In our study, each vaccine dose had approximately 5 \u00c2 10 6 TCID 50 of UV-treated virus, suggesting PLGA nanoparticle-based intranasal delivery of killed PRRSV vaccine needs significantly reduced virus amount to elicit anti-PRRSV immune response. Recently, it was shown that PLGA nanoparticle-based tumor antigenic Fig. 4 . Analysis of PRRSV specific recall cytokine response. Indicated mononuclear cells were restimulated and the harvested culture supernatant was analyzed for cytokines by ELISA: (a-d) IFN-g; (e-h) IL-12; (i and j) IL-6; and (k and l) TGF-b. Cytokines secreted by immune cells cultured in the absence of PRRSV antigens was subtracted from the test values. Each bar in the graph represents geometric mean cytokine amount from three pigs AE SEM. Alphabet 'a', 'b' and 'c' represents the statistical significant difference (p < 0.05) between unvaccinated vs K-Ag, unvaccinated vs Nano-KAg, and K-Ag vs Nano-KAg pigs, respectively.",

Although porcine lung Ig is primarily IgG, generation of protective IgA response is essential to reduce the entry of pathogens whose principle port of entry is through mucosal surfaces (McGhee et al., 1992) . Mucosal immunization elicits production of IgA antibodies (Ogra and Karzon, 1969) , and the IgA antibody is protective in clearing the virus infection by their virus neutralization activity (Liew et al., 1984) . But, we lack convincing studies about the role of lung IgA in PRRSV clearance in infected or vaccinated pigs. In this study the levels of PRRSV specific IgA antibody in the lungs of both Nano-KAg and K-Ag vaccinated pigs was found to be high and comparable; but, significant increase in lung VN titers was detected only in Nano-KAg received pigs. Further, in Nano-KAg immunized pigs increased levels of IFN-g response was observed both in the lungs and blood. In the serum of pigs unvaccinated or vaccinated with K-Ag and virus challenged, detectable VN titers were absent. But, Nano-KAg vaccine induced low levels of VN titers (1:2 and 1:4) in serum, and it might be due to nonspecific effects, as such low titers did not boost upon the viral challenge. This suggests the need of a potent adjuvant and/or a booster dose of the Nano-KAg vaccine to induce high PRRS VN titers in the serum. Further analysis in the lymphoid tissues and lungs is necessary to confirm the effect of Nano-KAg vaccine in viral clearance in challenged animals.",

In our study, PLGA nanoparticles did not induce any toxic symptoms in vaccinated pigs. Further, due to particulate nature of nanoparticles and the inherent ability of professional antigen presenting cells (APCs) to passively phagocytoze particulate antigens (Inaba et al., 1993) , nanoparticlebased delivery of vaccines to mucosal sites is advantageous. To note, abundant populations of APCs are present at mucosal tissues and lymphoid organs; and in BAL fluid of mice, humans, and pigs greater than 90% of cells are macrophages, suggesting that intranasally administered Nano-KAg was probably phagocytozed by alveolar macrophages. Earlier studies with killed influenza virus vaccine entrapped in nanoparticles administered with an adjuvant intranasally to mice, rabbits, and pigs elicited protective immune response and the response induced in pigs was significantly better than by intramuscular vaccination (Singh et al., 2001) . Therefore, innovative nanotechnology based intranasal vaccine delivery is an attractive alternative approach to deliver killed PRRSV vaccine to pigs.",

Alphabet 'a', 'b' and 'c' represents the statistical significant difference (p < 0.05) between unvaccinated vs K-Ag, unvaccinated vs Nano-KAg, and K-Ag vs Nano-KAg pigs, respectively. (Jaganathan and Vyas, 2006) . In addition, we also observed significantly increased myeloid and dendritic cell rich population in LMNC and PBMC of Nano-KAg compared to K-Ag vaccinated pigs. Unlike other nonlymphoid tissues the lung contains a large fraction of effector and central memory CD8 + T lymphocytes (Anderson et al., 2012; Unsoeld and Pircher, 2005) ; in fact, even na\u00efve lymphocytes are present in the perfused lung (Cose et al., 2006) . Since we included LMNC to analyze phenotypic analysis of immune cells our study represented the mucosal immune responses in the pig lungs against PRRSV.",

In pigs, the cytokine IL-10 inhibits IFN-g production by T cells (Waters et al., 1999) , and its immunosuppressive function with reduced IFN-g production was reported in PRRSV infected pigs (Charerntantanakul et al., 2006) . Earlier studies by others (Barbe et al., 2011) and us (Renukaradhya et al., 2010) have confirmed that pig lung homogenate provides reproducible and comparable data obtained by BAL fluid. Unlike the lung homogenate, the method of collection and the dilution factor in the BAL fluid may significantly alter the data from lab to lab, and thus lung homogenate may be a suitable sample for lung immune analysis with minimal variations. At this point due to absence of data from BAL fluid we could not conclude which sample is better in PRRSV vaccinated and/or challenged animals.",

In Nano-KAg (but not K-Ag) vaccinated pigs reduction in Tregs population in LMNC, PBMC, and TBLN was observed, signifying that our vaccination strategy dampened the Tregs response and favored the PRRSV specific Th1 and Th2 responses. We performed the immune cell analyses at a single time point and our data although supported the viral clearance, considering the nature of macrophage, neutrophil and lymphocyte trafficking and recruiting, it is difficult to precisely document the direct correlation of our immune cell phenotypic data with the observed response.",

In Nano-KAg vaccinated pigs there was an increased frequency of gd T cells in the lungs, blood, and TBLN, suggesting the possible protective role played by gd T cells in PRRSV immunity. In conclusion, our study for the first time demonstrated the efficacy of PLGA nanoparticleencapsulated PRRSV killed vaccine in inducing anti-PRRSV specific humoral and cell-mediated immune responses, which concertedly contributed in better clearance of viremia compared to control killed vaccine. Further studies are required to evaluate anti-PRRSV cross-protective immunity in vaccinated pigs. In summary, intranasal delivery of Nano-KAg vaccine has a promise, but needs further investigation and improvement.",
