We used a microarray-based system that warrants high throughput and easy handling. Seven immunogenic candidates were selected after screening. Comparative analyses by ELISA and microarrays manifested their immunodominant character. The large repetitive protein (SEN4030) that plays a role as a putative adhesin in initial cell surface interaction and is highly specific to Salmonella is considered to be the most suitable protein for a diagnostic approach. The results further demonstrate that the strategy applied herein is convenient for specifically identifying immunogenic proteins of pathogenic microorganisms. Consequently, it enables a sound assessment of promising candidates for diagnostic applications and vaccine development. Moreover, the elucidation of immunogenic proteins may assist in unveiling unknown virulence-associated factors, thus furthering the understanding of the underlying pathogenicity of Salmonella in general, and of S. Enteritidis, one of the most frequently detected serovars of this pathogen, in particular.",

            "text": "Salmonella are Gram-negative, facultative anaerobe, motile and rod-shaped bacteria comprised of three species, S. enterica, S. bongori and S. subterranean. However, many different serovars have been described for S. enterica including the major contributors to salmonella infections in humans, S. Enteritidis, S. Typhi, S. Typhimurium, S. Paratyphi, and S. Choleraesuis. While S. Typhi and S. Paratyphi cause typhoid fever, S. Enteritidis and S. Typhimurium lead to gastrointestinal infections termed salmonellosis [1] . In the European Union alone, approximately 100.000 human cases of salmonellosis are reported annually, with S. Enteritidis and S. Typhimurium the most frequently detected serotypes (EFSA, 2013). These non-typhoidal salmonella (NTS) cause a localized infection manifesting as nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramps, diarrhea and fever. The infection dose is approximately 10 5 bacteria and the disease is mainly self-limiting with mild symptoms [2] . However, in immunocompromised people and young children the severity of the disease may be more pronounced including typhoid-like infections potentially leading to systemic infections and sepsis [3] . While several in vivo animal infection models have been used to study the pathogenicity of S. Typhimurium [4] [5] [6] , S. Enteritidis has been insufficiently studied. Additionally, evidence suggests that S. Enteritidis requires genes missing in S. Typhimurium [7] .",

The bacteria are cultured from food or fecal samples and detection comprises preenrichment, enrichment, identification of the pathogen and confirmation as mandatory steps, which usually take several days [8] . Although standard cultivation tests are dependable and well-established, the demand for more rapid diagnostic tools is high. Especially during the containment of epidemics, isolation of patients in hospitals, and monitoring of contaminations in food-processing plants time is critical. Therefore, immunoassay-based tests, e.g. ELISA or lateral flow tests deserve consideration. Whereas ELISA is a laboratoryintensive method that takes roughly 4-6 h, lateral flow test strips are designed with easy handling and read-out in mind. In fact, immunochromogenic strips (ICS) based on lateral flow have been successfully introduced in the developing countries to detect Treponema pallidum, the cause for the sexually transmitted infection syphilis, among others [9] . Commonly used ELISA systems are based on a sandwich assay format using Anti-O-H antibodies [10] , which detect both the O-antigen (polysaccharide) and the H-antigen (flagella) of salmonella. However, in order to improve sensitivity and specificity for future tests, a deeper understanding of specific salmonella antigens is required.",

            "text": "cDNA library construction and screening Screening of 1536 different samples led to 192 clones being sequenced due to their fluorescence intensity. Within this group nine genes encoding proteins with immunogenic potential were revealed. In spite of that, numerous sequenced clones displayed only gene fragments ranging from 45 to 444 bp resulting in poor and ambiguous identification after BLAST analysis. This might have been caused by the excessive degradation of RNA prior to cDNA synthesis as attributed by a RNA integrity number (RIN) of 2.6. Although comparative studies have shown the RNA isolation method used to be reliable [20] , it may have been a source for degradation. Still, this has been a proven method in revealing immunogenic proteins from pathogens and extracting RNA with high quality [11] . Although, cDNA synthesis and PCR amplification may have assisted in creating short fragments, the approach presented herein was specifically selected due to its ability to generate full-length [21] and high quality cDNA [22] . Nevertheless, normalization of cDNA prior to cloning was successful. Duplex-specific nuclease digests solely double-stranded DNA and has been used for normalization of cDNA prior to RNAseq [23] . This is a mandatory step to reduce the highly abundant rRNA, which encompasses more than 95 % of a total RNA extraction. As no distinct band of 3,000 bp, representing cDNA derived from 23S rRNA, is visible after gel electrophoresis, the cDNA was effectively normalized. Rather, a homogeneous smear, representing cDNA molecules of different sizes, was detected. Contrary to eukaryotic mRNA harboring a poly(A) tail, prokaryotic mRNA lacks this feature and thus cannot be directly reverse transcribed using oligo(dT) primers. However, as the applied cDNA synthesis demanded the presence of a poly(A) tail, the total RNA had to be polyadenylated prior to first-strand synthesis. After normalization, cloning commenced by introducing the inserts into linearized vector using ligation-independent-cloning (LIC) [24] . The LIC is a powerful tool in contrast to original cloning methods based upon ligase and restriction endonucleases, which often suffer from low efficiencies [25] caused mainly by short overhangs leading to nonspecific interactions and advocating religation of the vector. In contrast, LIC guarantees directional cloning at any desired site with high efficiency. Furthermore, the proteins of interest were expressed as fusion constructs harboring an N-terminal HaloTag\u00ae. This enabled covalent, irreversible binding to the microarray surface in a highly specific manner. Thus, purification was obsolete and cross-reactivity reduced to a minimum [14] . Commonly, microarray-based immunoscreenings offer high throughput of samples as Zhu, et al., 2006 [26] have shown. However, most methods incorporate time-consuming and costly purification steps prior to spotting purified target protein to nitrocellulose microarrays. The combination of highthroughput microarray-based immunoscreenings and the easy handling of the HaloTag\u00ae system warrants a fast identification of immunogenic proteins [14] . Consequently, the immunoscreenings of 1536 proteins are completed within a few hours. Table 1 summarizes the nine protein candidates identified via microarray screening. The proteins encompass a highly conserved DNA primase that shows homology in all bacteria. Moreover, two hypothetical proteins (SEN1186 and SEN2464) were detected with no known function rendering these candidates highly attractive for further investigations. SEN2464 is additionally described as a methionine tRNA cytidine acetyltransferase providing precise recognition of the AUG codon for elongation-specific methionine tRNA [27] . For SEN4030, a large repetitive protein with 5559 amino acid residues, no function is known; however, it shows high similarity to SiiE of S. Typhimurium. SiiE is a giant nonfimbrial adhesin that facilitates initial interaction to the intestinal epithelium [28] . SEN4030 and the putative isomerase (SEN1504) are conserved in Salmonella [27] . Membraneassociation is another intriguing feature as it enhances the protein's accessibility in a diagnostic assay. This is true for the ais protein (SEN2278), the multidrug resistance protein A (SEN2659) and the membrane-bound lytic murein transglycosylase A precursor (SEN2832). The ais protein is a lipopolysaccharide core heptose(II)-phosphate phosphatase catalyzing the dephosphorylation of heptose(II) of the outer membrane lipopolysaccharide core. On top of that, it has just recently been identified as a virulence factor contributing to enteric infection [29] . Last but not least, SEN1186 is a DNA mismatch endonuclease located in the cytoplasm.",

However, after initial identification, clones expressing full-length proteins were obtained for all genes except SEN4030. SEN4030 comprises approximately 17,000 bp, so cloning of the full-length gene was not achieved. Consequently, two sequence segments, one in the central region of the gene (6,600-8,100 bp = SEN4030a) and another at the C-terminal end (13,500-15,500 bp = SEN4030b) of the gene were chosen. The 444 bp segment identified during initial immunoscreening is located within SEN4030b. Both parts contain bacterial immunoglobulin-like domains that are mainly found in bacterial surface proteins involved in pathogenicity [30] . The proteins primase and membrane-bound lytic murein transglycosylase A were excluded from further analyses due to their high homology among bacteria (>30 genera). Identity of the full-length genes was ascertained by sequencing. The expression of correct fusion constructs was determined via SDS-PAGE, see Fig. 1 . All proteins were successfully expressed as fusion constructs showing the correct size including the protein of interest and the 34 kDa HaloTag\u2122. In contrast to the other proteins, SEN2278 and SEN2659 show lower intensities in PAGE. Nevertheless, this was expected as membrane proteins tend to agglomerate more easily due to the presence of extensive hydrophobic regions. Agglomeration leads to the formation of inclusion bodies, which remain inaccessible after lysis without special treatment.",

Comparing both ELISA and microarray analyses, the normalized intensities differ in the two methods applied.

Despite these differences, both methods show similar tendencies regarding protein candidates with immunodominant character. Additionally, microarray analysis combined results from two different antibodies reactive to S. enterica, while ELISA measurements were performed with one antibody only. Moreover, ELISA measurements represent only one fourth of the data in comparison to microarray analysis. This might have caused the observable variance in the results.
