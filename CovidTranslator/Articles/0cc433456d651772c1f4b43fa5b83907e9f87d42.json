Posture -posture of the patient may indicate evidence of abdominal pain, for instance, abdominal distension, arching of back, treading of hind feet, or lying down. Rectal temperature -enteritis is an inflammatory condition, which may cause pyrexia. Oral examination -checking for evidence of oral ulceration and hypersalivation (ptyalism). This is important because some viral causes of enteritis also cause oral lesions. Assessment of hydration status and mucous membrane color -hydration status and color of mucous membranes (ocular, oral, and or vulva), including capillary refill time should be assessed. Abdominal palpation, auscultation, percussion, and succussion -abdominal palpation is practical in adult sheep and goats but unrewarding in adult cattle. Abdominal palpation may help identify evidence of pain or allow palpation of abdominal viscera. Simultaneous auscultation and percussion on the left and right abdominal wall help identify viscera filled with air, including the intestine. Succussion of the abdomen confirms the presence of excessive fluid in abdominal viscera, including the small intestine. Rectal examination -rectal examination is practical in cattle but may be delayed in cases of presence of a rectal prolapse (secondary to diarrhea). Rectal examination aids in identifying distended abdominal viscera, including small intestine, rumen, colon, or cecum. If not performed already, characteristics of the diarrhea (eg, color, Chigerwe & Heller odor, and volume of feces and presence of tenesmus, blood, mucus, or gravel) should be evaluated during the rectal examination and by evaluating feces on the rectal sleeve.",

Clinical signs associated with salmonellosis in adult ruminants include pyrexia and diarrhea. 2 The diarrheic feces may vary from watery to mucoid and may contain fibrin and blood. 3 Due to the presence of significant concentrations of proteins, the diarrheic feces have a putrid, foul odor. 3 Endotoxemia may occur in part due to the damaged intestinal mucosa, leading to pyrexia, depressed attitude, and shock. Bacteremia is also possible secondary to the enteritis. The enteritis causes an acute protein-losing enteropathy. Some Salmonella serotypes are potentially zoonotic (eg, Salmonella Typhimurium and Salmonella Newport) 4 whereas Salmonella Dublin is host-adapted (serotypes found in the host species and long-term carriers exist) in cattle. 3 Paratuberculosis Paratuberculosis (Johne disease) is a chronic enteric disease of ruminants caused by the bacterium, Mycobacterium avium subsp paratuberculosis.",

To make a saturated float solution, mix 400 g of sodium chloride, or 400 g of magnesium sulfate, with 1 L of warm tap water. For the sucrose solution, mix 454 g of granulated sugar with 355 mL of warm of tap water. 17 3. The saturated solution of sodium chloride, sugar, or magnesium sulfate is sufficient to float common helminths eggs and coccidia oocysts in ruminants. 4. Mix 1 g of feces with 10 mL to 12 mL of the saturated float solution. Mixing of the fecal sample is easy in cases of diarrhea. 5. Pour the mixture through a strainer or gauze into a 15-mL centrifuge tube. Add the float solution into the centrifuge tube so that the liquid is level with the top of the tube (forms a meniscus).",
