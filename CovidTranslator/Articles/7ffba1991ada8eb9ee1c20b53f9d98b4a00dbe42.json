The disease, as of September 2016, is known to have occurred in 1800 cases with 643 deaths worldwide. 1 The camels (dromedaries with single hump) are the principal reservoir but South American camelids (Llamas), alpacas and pigs also get infected as evidenced by various serological and experimental animal studies.",

The causative agents MERS-CoV binds to a receptor binding site dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4) which is distributed in the respiratory passages of susceptible animals and humans. Horses have a high expression and wide distribution of the virus receptor DPP4 but do not get infected due to innate immunity. Epidemiologic studies show an evidence of endemic MERS-CoV infection in Africa and Saudi Arabia since as far back as 1983 and 1992 respectively. There is no known antiviral agent or vaccine as yet for the treatment or control of the spread. An outbreak of the disease was reported in South Korea (May 2015-July 2015) with a total of 186 infected cases with 36 deaths and a high political and economic fallout. 2 The role of hospital infection control policies in containment of the spread of disease is critical. The author of the article in this issue (Kumar A) 3 has discussed this very ably from his personal experience in one of the hospitals in Saudi Arabia.",

Furthermore, Pakistan has a very high population of dromedary camels, exceeding 1 million. A study of sera of 565 animals in Pakistan during 2012-15 showed ELISA positivity (55.8%) and 39.5% were confirmed by microneutralisation (MN). The rate of MN positivity ranged in different districts of Punjab, Pakistan; being highest in Rahim Yar Khan (82.9%) which shares a border with Rajasthan, India. 4 There is thus a risk of human exposure in India both from Middle East countries and shared border with Pakistan.",
