Jaworski, MD a,b, *, Valerie Rygiel, DO c Acute illnesses contracted by athletes typically mirror the type and timing of those seen in the general population; however, in athletes they can present as a significant health burden. When caring for acutely ill athletes, sports medicine providers need to consider how the illness can affect the athlete's training, performance, and competition schedule; the risk of transmission of the illness to other team members; and the necessary precautions and contraindications related to treatment of the athletes and their return to participation. In addition, it is necessary to recognize that athletes training at an elite level, or for more prolonged periods of time, may be more susceptible to illness as a facet of an overtraining syndrome. This article focuses on the impact of acute illness on athletes as well as highlighting special considerations of specific acute illnesses as they relate to athletes.",

[5] [6] [7] The reasons for this are unclear, but are thought to be related to self-selection, whereby this group of athletes possess immune systems able to withstand the highest levels of physiologic and psychological stressors, which results in what is referred to as an S-curve phenomenon 8 (Fig. 1) .",

            "text": "Acute illnesses in athletes stand to affect performance through a variety of mechanisms. Infections occurring during the peak of an athlete's season can impair the athlete's competitive performance because of being limited by symptoms, such as with a persistent cough, as well as via deconditioning from lost training time. In contrast, an infection early in the season is less likely to impart significant consequences because any decline in performance can typically be regained quickly once the illness resolves. Respiratory symptoms such as cough and bronchospasm can directly affect ventilation and aerobic capacity as well as incite anxiety in the athlete because of either a real A B or perceived inability to oxygenate properly. Fever impairs the ability to regulate body temperature, which increases fluid losses and can affect both stroke volume and cardiac output, affecting maximal oxygen uptake (VO 2max ). Muscle wasting, impaired coordination, and decreased strength that results from an acute illness can also affect performance as well as increase risk of injury. Studies have also shown that deconditioning of the cardiorespiratory, musculoskeletal, and metabolic systems can occur in athletes with less than 4 weeks off from training. 10 The effects are greatest, and occur most quickly, in the most highly trained athletes, sometimes beginning after only 4 to 5 days. 11 VO 2max can decline between 6% and 20% with deconditioning in highly trained athletes, affecting ventilatory efficiency and endurance. 12 Such decreases in exercise performance can last for 2 to 4 days beyond the complete resolution of an upper respiratory illness in athletes. 13 Research has shown that maintenance of low-level activity, when appropriate, can be used to fend off some of the physiologic changes associated with complete cessation of activity and should be considered in select cases. 12 Overtraining and Risk of Illness",

Training philosophy centers on the idea of functional overreaching, whereby athletes push beyond normal limits in order to adapt to these higher loads and achieve gains in their sports. In order for this overreaching to benefit the athlete, adequate recovery needs to be factored into the equation. In situations in which there is not enough recovery, the athletes fail to improve and may see detrimental effects on their performance either in the form of nonfunctional overreaching or, in more extreme cases, overtraining syndrome.

With proper recognition of this disruption of the athlete's homeostasis, usually caused by having to stop for an illness or injury, rest can be initiated, resulting in recovery and return to homeostasis.

Athletes may be more at risk if they frequently travel for their sports, compete indoors, or have close contact with teammates and/or opponents. Rates of URTIs in athletes increase in the winter months, most likely because of crowding indoors, seasonal variations in pathogens, and physiologic changes that occur because of the cold.

Classic pertussis infection is described as having 3 phases of illness: catarrhal, paroxysmal, and convalescent. The catarrhal phase lasts 1 to 2 weeks and is characterized by a mild, intermittent cough, low-grade fevers, and coryza. In the paroxysmal phase, infected individuals experience a spasmodic cough, posttussive emesis, and an inspiratory whoop. This phase can range from 1 to 6 weeks in duration. The convalescent phase is when the symptoms begin to subside, typically over 7 to 10 days, but they can last for months. 24 The classic symptoms of posttussive emesis and whoop are rarely seen in clinical practice and, although their presence increases the specificity of pertussis, it is not enough to definitively diagnose pertussis. 25 Confirmatory testing for pertussis is via a nasopharyngeal swab, which can be sent for either culture or polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Results from culture have poor sensitivity and specificity and can take several days to obtain. PCR is costlier, but much quicker, with results available in 1 to 2 days. Because of such limitations, most suspected cases are treated based on patient presentation and ideally include known recent exposure to a confirmed index case. 25, 26 Treatment",

In confirmed cases of pertussis, teammates and coaches should receive postexposure prophylaxis with the same macrolide treatment course. The American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) states that once treatment of pertussis is initiated, the individual needs to be isolated for the first 5 days of antibiotic treatment. Therefore, athletes with pertussis need to be removed from contact with teammates and staff. Health care providers are mandated to report any confirmed cases. 25, 27 Prophylaxis There continue to be high rates of pertussis cases among teens and young adults despite improved immunization rates. These high rates are thought to be in part caused by a change from a live pertussis vaccine to an acellular version of the vaccine in the 1990s. 24 Based on these continued high rates of infection, the Advisory Council on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommends a booster vaccine for adolescents and adults. 27,28 ACIP recommends a single Tdap dose for persons aged 11 to 18 years who have completed the primary series and for adults 19 to 64 years regardless of their last vaccine tetanus or diphtheria toxoid. In addition, pregnant women should receive a booster with each pregnancy, preferably between 27 and 36 weeks' gestation. 28 In the athletic setting, providers should be educating their athletes and staff about the importance of this vaccination.",

Self-treatment with antibiotics for milder cases has been shown to increase microbial resistance. 39 In general, fluoroquinolones are avoided for treatment of TD in the athletic setting, because of potential effects on the musculoskeletal system, including the rare but worrisome risk of tendon rupture in athletes. Azithromycin has been shown to be as effective for TD as fluoroquinolones and is now the preferred agent. 40 Azithromycin is given as a 1000-mg single dose or as 500 mg daily for 3 days. In TD caused by E coli, rifaximin has been shown to be effective; however, it is not for use with any febrile diarrhea or dysentery. 41 If a parasitic cause is suspected, metronidazole 500 mg 3 times daily for 5 days is the preferred regimen. The use of antimotility agents such as loperamide and diphenoxylate has been considered controversial in the past, but it is now generally accepted as safe when taken with an antibiotic. 9 More conservative recommendations for use in athletes suggest reserving it for use only preceding a competition or during a long trip. 42 A summary of the recommendations for TD treatment can be found in Table 2 .",

If prophylaxis is needed for an athlete, rifaximin is the antibiotic currently recommended at either 200 mg daily, twice daily, or 3 times daily because of a much lower side effect profile than the fluoroquinolones. 43 Before travel to high-risk regions, athletes should be educated on prudent selection of food and drinks. Selecting only bottled water or carbonated canned drinks, both consumed from the bottle with a straw rather than from a glass, as well as only eating fully cooked hot food and fruit that is peeled by the eater can minimize risk. Avoidance of buffets, condiments, ice, and food provided on international return flights are additional measures that should be taken while athletes are traveling. Of course, proper handwashing and avoidance of sharing utensils or glassware are also necessary to minimize risk.",
