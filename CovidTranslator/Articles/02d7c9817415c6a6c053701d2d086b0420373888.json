            "text": "Pesticides play an important role in food production by controlling insects, weeds, organisms responsible for plant diseases, and other pests. In protecting food plants, pesticides assist in ensuring substantial yield and providing consumers with a wide variety of foods at inexpensive prices. Pests are living organisms that occur where they are not wanted or that cause damage to crops, humans, or other animals. Most pesticides create some degree of risk of harm to humans, animals, or the environment because they are inherently designed to kill or otherwise adversely affect living organisms but be selective with regard to target species (Albert, 1979) . At the same time, pesticides are useful to society, destroying potential disease-causing organisms and control insects, weeds, and other pests. Understanding the modes of action of pesticides is important to the food toxicologist both for the design of compounds to be specific for the targeted species and for understanding potential adverse human health effects. Pesticides have several modes of action. They may physically alter the organism in a mechanical way which blocks their cellular processes. Examples include oil (petroleum products) that are used as sprays, which clog the respiratory mechanism of insects, or compounds like bypyridylium herbicides, which act by destroying the cell membranes of plants causing desiccation. Petroleum oils can also deter feeding or egg laying in some insects. Some pesticides are metabolic system inhibitors and restrict the transfer of energy within the target organisms. Inhibitory pesticides in this category are many, such as rotenone and cyanide, which disrupt respiratory functions in animals, or herbicides that inhibit seed germination or plant growth, and various fungicides that inhibit germination of spores. Some pesticides require metabolic activation into the toxic form before they become toxic to the target pest. For example, sodium monofluoroacetate is converted to fluorocitrate before it becomes toxic to vertebrates.",

Proteins, as the basic building blocks of all cell components, are crucial and substances made up of proteins, such as enzymes, control many important cell functions. Pesticides can disrupt enzyme processes or denature proteins. Examples include inorganic copper compounds, dithiocarbamate fungicides, phosphoro amino acid herbicides, such as glyphosate and organophosphate insecticides. Other pesticides alter hormone actions that control many of the biological functions of organisms, including growth and reproductive cycles. Several pesticides simulate or otherwise interfere with hormones to disrupt these cycles, for example phenoxy herbicides that interfere with plant growth hormones, and insect growth regulators that interfere with cuticle formation in insects during molting. Nervous system disruptor pesticides affect mainly animal groups such as insects, nematodes, and rodents. Some pesticides, such as some fumigant pesticides, are narcotics. Others disrupt the movement of nerve impulses, such as the organophosphate, carbamate, and pyrethroid pesticides. Some pesticides affect photosynthesis, the process of using sunlight energy to create carbohydrates from carbon dioxide and water. Pesticides that disrupt photosynthesis prevent the plant from producing or storing energy and ultimately kill the plant, for example triazine, substituted urea and uracil herbicides. Finally, some pesticides work in more than one way and fall into more than one of these categories. The modes of action of many pesticides are not fully understood. Some pesticides are residual in action and continue to be effective for days, weeks, or months after their application. Examples are the triazine herbicides that persist in the soil and kill emerging weeds over the lifetime of a crop, or insecticides that remain active for several years as a barrier to termites entering buildings.",

The mode of action of lead is related to the metal's high affinity for proteins, such as hemoglobin, plasma proteins, and the subsequent inhibition of protein-mediated processes. Lead ingestion leads to inhibition of the synthesis of red blood cells, which in turn compromises oxygen transport. When the binding capacity of blood proteins are exceeded, lead affects other organs, such as bone-marrow, liver, nervous system, reproductive tissues, and kidney. Organic lead compounds are particularly troublesome and likely lead to injuries to mental development with reduction in intelligence, growth, and cognitive function.",

Since the Industrial Revolution, industrial and mining operations have been accompanied by industrial waste, which may be toxic, ignitable, corrosive, or reactive. Obviously, proper management is the key and improperly managed waste can pose dangerous health and environmental risks. It is estimated that, in the United States, the amount of hazardous waste generated by manufacturing industries has increased from 4.5 million tons annually after World War II to some 265 million tons by 1990 (Council on Environmental Quality, 1981) Waste is generated at every stage in the production process, use, and disposal of manufactured products. The introduction of many new technologies for the home and office (computers, drugs, textiles, paints and dyes, plastics) in recent times has introduced more hazardous waste, including toxic chemicals, into the environment. The EPA estimated in 1980 that more than 70,000 different chemicals were being manufactured in the United States, with some 1,000 new chemicals being added each year (Petulla, 1988) . The human health and environmental impacts of many of these chemicals are largely unknown. Industrial waste may be solid, liquid, or gaseous and is divided into hazardous and non-hazardous waste. Hazardous waste may result from manufacturing or other industrial processes. Certain commercial products such as cleaning fluids, paints, or pesticides discarded by commercial establishments or individuals can also be defined as hazardous waste. The definition of hazardous waste has been further refined through regulations. Non-hazardous industrial waste is that which does not meet the EPA's definition of hazardous waste and is not municipal waste.",

As will become apparent, whether to classify these as true animal toxins is debatable since they seem to be more microbial in their origin. Ciguatera is a form of poisoning caused by the consumption of finfish (barracudas, snappers, jacks, mackerel, and triggerfish) which have accumulated naturally-occurring toxins that originate from several dinoflagellate (algae) species that are common to ciguatera. Manifestations of ciguatera usually involves a combination of gastrointestinal, neurological, and cardiovascular disorders. Shellfish poisoning is caused by a group of toxins elaborated by planktonic algae, dinoflagellates, upon which the shellfish feed. The toxins are accumulated and metabolized by the shellfish. The 20 toxins responsible for paralytic shellfish poisonings (PSP) are all derivatives of saxitoxin. The effects are predominantly neurological and include tingling, burning, numbness, drowsiness, incoherent speech, and respiratory paralysis. Scombroid poisoning is caused by the ingestion of fish that contain high levels of histamine and other vasoactive amines and compounds. Histamine and other amines are formed by the growth of certain bacteria in the fish or any food that contains the appropriate amino acids. Fish poisoning can also occur by consumption of members of the pufferfish family. Tetrodotoxin has also been isolated from widely differing animal species, including the California newt, parrotfish, frogs of the genus Atelopus, the blueringed octopus, starfish, angelfish, and xanthid crabs. Recent reports of the production of tetrodotoxin/anhydrotetrodotoxin by several bacterial species, including strains of the family Vibrionaceae, Pseudomonas sp., and Photobacterium phosphoreum, point toward a bacterial origin of this family of toxins.",

Several adverse weather related DON contamination episodes in the United States motivated the FDA to issue advisory levels for food (wheat) and feed in 1982 and updated levels in 1993.

It is mainly a contaminant of cereals (corn, barley, wheat, and oats) and has been found in edible animal tissues as well as in human blood sera and milk. Studies indicate that this toxin is carcinogenic in mice and rats. It is not completely destroyed during the processing and cooking of food, therefore the implication for risk to human health and safety must be considered. \u00b7 Patulin is a mycotoxin produced by several species of mold fungi including Penicillium expansum, the causal organism of apple rot.

The United Kingdom's Food Advisory Committee announced recently its intention to establish control measures on patulin. FDA identified patulin as a potential hazard in fruit juice in its juice HACCP proposal.

Approximately 300 of these compounds have been tested and 90% of them have been found to be carcinogenic in a wide variety of experimental animals. Dimethylnitrosamine (DMNA) (also called Nnitrosodimethylamine or NDMA) is a member of a group of chemicals known as nitrosamines which are recognized as cancer-causing substances. DMNA is a volatile liquid, which dissolves easily in water and in oil. It can be broken down by light or microorganisms but, in their absence, DMNA can persist in water for a very long time. Even in a sewage treatment plant, DMNA degrades only very slowly. Nitrosamines (including DMNA) are also formed in tobacco smoke. An interesting observation is that the concentration of nitrosamines in side-stream smoke from a cigarette has 20\u00b1200 times more nitrosamines than the mainstream smoke. Exposure to very smoky rooms can result in as much DMNA exposure as smoking. Most nitrosamines are mutagens and a number are transplacental carcinogens. Most are organspecific. For instance, DMNA causes liver cancer in experimental animals, whereas some of the tobacco-specific nitrosamines cause lung cancer. Since nitrosamines are metabolized the same in human and animal tissues, it seems highly likely that humans are susceptible to the carcinogenic properties of nitrosamines.",

The very high cooking temperatures used to fry bacon are conducive to nitrosamine formation. In the late 1970s, extensive attention was focused on the issue of nitrosamines in cured meats and the removal of sodium nitrite as a food additive was considered. However, the prospect of sodium nitrite removal presented a formidable dilemma for the regulatory agencies. Removal of sodium nitrite would prevent nitrosamine formation, but it might also increase the risk of botulism poisoning. Sodium nitrite and sodium chloride together are particularly effective against Clostridium botulinum. The solution to the dilemma was to limit the addition of sodium nitrite to 120 ppm, the lowest level found to be effective in controlling growth and toxin production by Clostridium botulinum.",

CDC estimates that 23 million cases of acute gastroenteritis are due to norovirus infection, and it is now thought that at least 50% of all foodborne outbreaks of gastroenteritis can be attributed to noroviruses.",

It has been suggested that epoxide hydrolase polymorphisms may alter the risk of aflatoxin-associated liver cancer (Eaton et al., 1995; Seidegard and Ekstrom, 1997; McGlynn et al., 1995) .",

            "text": "Because of natural selection, different alleles on our genes are more likely to confer a survival advantage in different environments. Cycles of infectious disease prevalence and virulence often reflect natural selection. If natural selection eliminates individuals with detrimental phenotypes from a population, then it seems ironic that harmful mutant alleles persist in a gene pool. A disease can remain prevalent when heterozygotes have some other advantage over individuals who have two copies of the wild type allele. When carriers have advantages that allow a detrimental allele to persist in a population, balanced polymorphism is at work. This form of polymorphism often entails heterozygosity for an inherited illness that protects against an infectious illness. Sickle cell disease is one example of an autosomal recessive disorder that causes anemia, joint pain, swollen spleen, and frequent, severe infections. It illustrates balanced polymorphism because carriers are resistant to malaria, an infection by the parasite Plasmodium falciparum that causes cycles of chills and fever. The parasite spends the first stage of its life cycle in the salivary glands of the mosquito Anopheles gambiae. When an infected mosquito bites a human, the malaria parasite enters the red blood cells, which transport it to the liver. The red blood cells burst, releasing the parasite throughout the body. The frequency of sickle cell carriers in tropical Africa was found to be higher in regions where malaria raged for many years. It was found through blood tests from children hospitalized with malaria, that nearly all were homozygous for the wild type of sickle cell allele. The few sickle cell carriers among them had the mildest cases of malaria. Thus, it is likely that the presence of malaria somehow selected for the sickle cell allele by toppling people who did not inherit it. The fact that sickle cell disease is far less common in the United States, where malaria is rare, supports the idea that sickle cell heterozygosity provides a protective effect.",

Antibiotics used as growth promotion agents in the livestock and poultry industries likely contribute significantly to the problem of antibiotic resistance (Hamer and Gill, 2002) . It is estimated that more than 11 million kg of antimicrobial agents is sold for nontherapeutic purposes in animals compared to 900,000 kg used for treatment of infections, annually (Hamer and Gill, 2002) . Both in Europe and the United States, studies have shown that the transfer of multidrug-resistant pathogens from food animals to humans occurs. A recent survey of meats taken from Washington, DC found Salmonella with alarming frequency (White et al., 2001; Fey et al., 2000) . When the isolates were tested for resistance to antibiotics, most were resistant to at least one antibiotic and over 50% were resistant to at least three antibiotics, including many common compounds, for example tetracycline, streptomycin, sulfamethoxozole, and ampicillin. Some were resistant to cephalosporins and ceftriaxone, or third-generation antibiotics, which are important analogs of human antibiotics. Avoparcin is a growth promoter used for years in European food animals. Avoparcin-resistant organisms are also cross-resistant to vancomycin and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium in humans has recently been associated with increased hospital stays, costs of care, and patient mortality (Levison and Mallela, 2000) . Thus, the European Union banned the use of avoparcin in 1997.",

The functional food market has likely doubled in the past ten years to over $10 billion and many food companies are taking full advantage of the public's growing awareness of food in health. Thus, a natural extension of the functional food area is modifying or cultivating food plants and animals to maximize their ability to produce the desirable compounds that are important to health, for example more vitamin E, vitamin A. Genetic modification (GM) of plants or animals for the purpose of producing more functional foods, is at the cutting edge of food science (Reilly, 2000; Harlander, 2002) . Some have claimed that this is a new`second generation' of GM crops, being developed to be genetically modified to express traits for delivering apparent benefits to the consumer and unlike the`first generation,' developed for delivering only producer benefits. Others will contend that because the density of nutritive and health-beneficial functional chemicals can vary dramatically among plants and animals, with levels often being quite low or non-existent, there is a need to develop strategies that would improve the composition of such chemicals in certain foods. Conventional breeding techniques can be used to achieve this goal, but GM is an attractive alternative that would enable investigators to overcome the genetic diversity within existing germplasm that limit the extent of improvement that can be achieved through conventional techniques. Examples include the engineering of beta-carotene in rice grains, elevating iron content in rice, enhancing vitamin C content in lettuce, increasing flavonols in tomato. The research is complex because often there is a need not only to understand the biochemical pathway for producing such metabolites, but also a need to appreciate the complexity of the metabolites trafficking through the organism, which likely require the identification of several genes for use in a transgenic improvement strategy.",

Alterations introduced into the genome are very specific and minor, altering one or a few genes and their gene products. The overall safety evaluation of a GM functional food will be conducted under the concept known as`substantial equivalence' where GM products with one or a few new introduced traits remain substantially equivalent to their traditional counterparts (Cockburn, 2002; Kuiper et al., 2002) . A detailed profile on each step in the GM transformation process from parent to new product can be done to assess whether any differences can be detected, which might affect safety. Over 50 GM crops have undergone such evaluation and been judged safe, via World Health Organization and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO/WHO, 2000) . Overall, the safety assessment is focused on those genes and their products that are introduced into the new variety. Typically, the emphasis is placed on proteins expressed by the introduced atypical gene. Consumption of DNA, regardless of the source, is considered highly digestible and safe (Beever and Kemp, 2000; Jonas, et al., 2001) . For novel organisms not judged substantially equivalent to the traditional counterpart, which might be the situation when a large number of genes are introduced or the nutritional content has been altered substantially, a more thorough safety evaluation will be needed. If the parent plant is known to have antinutrient properties, natural toxicants, or allergenic substances, the novel organism will be tested to determine the concentration of such compounds. Currently, the safety assessment approach for such products is voluntary in the United States; however, a mandatory system is likely to be imposed by the FDA in the near future.",

Fortunately for humans, this chemical diversity also includes many compounds that are beneficial to health: nutrients, antioxidants, anticarcinogens, and many compounds with medicinal value. Most plant species in the world are not edible, many because of the toxins they produce. Plant domestication has gradually reduced the levels of these compounds so that the plant foods we eat today are far less toxic than their wild parents. However, such domestication has resulted in modern food plants being much more susceptible to disease. Toxins range from known carcinogens to skin irritants. A few lipid-soluble plant toxins are capable of bioaccumulation, for example, solanine from potatoes. Toxin concentrations in a plant can vary tremendously and the concentration can be dictated dramatically by environmental stress on the plant (drought, heat/cold, mineral deficiencies, etc.), and disease. Also, different varieties of plant species can differ in the levels of toxins and nutritional value.",

For example, phytate, a common component of most seeds and cereals, forms a complex with many important minerals, making less of the minerals available or making an antimineral substance. Antinutritives can have important health implications particularly with populations facing malnutrition or in marginal nutritional states (Janssen, 1997) .",

In addition to inducing mitosis, lectins are known for their ability to agglutinate many mammalian red blood cell types, alter cell membrane transport systems, alter cell permeability to proteins, and generally interfere with cellular metabolism. Lectins originate from plants, particularly legumes. Bean lectins, extracted from raw beans, bind to intestinal mucosal cells and interfere with absorption of amino acids, thyroxine, and various lipophilic compounds. Ricin, found in the castor bean, is toxic and causes intestinal cell necrosis.",

Foods rich in oxalic acid exhibiting an oxalic acid to calcium ratio higher than 1 may decrease calcium availability. Foods rich in glucosinolates such as cabbage, legumes, rutabaga, and turnips may compromise iodine absorption promoting goiter. Gossypol is found in the cotton plant and forms insoluble chelates with many essential metals, such as iron. However, processing of cotton seed removes up to 99% of the gossypol.

The synthesis of new proteins into foods may present concerns about safety, particularly allergenicity (Hefle et al., 1996; Taylor, 1997; Wal, 1999) . Although all allergens are not proteins, most are and, fortunately, only a few of the many diverse proteins found in foods are allergenic when ingested. It is important that the potential allergenicity of an introduced protein be evaluated because the incidence of food allergies can be traumatic and life-threatening. A task force of the International Food Biotechnology Council (IFBC) and the Allergy and Immunology Institute of the International Life Sciences Institute (ILSI) developed a decision tree approach for the assessment of potential allergenicity of plants produced by GM in 1996. The decision tree approach was modified by the FAO/WHO and focuses on evaluating the source of the gene, the sequence homology of the newly introduced protein to known allergens, the immunoreactivity of the novel protein with serum IgE from individuals with known allergies to the source of the transferred genetic material (Taylor and Hefle, 2001) . It is useful to have information regarding various physical and chemical properties of the novel protein, for example heat and digestive stability. It is likely that application of such criteria to GM foods will provide assurance that the novel protein in question will be assessed adequately for safety. However, some consumers and interest groups who are opposed to agricultural biotechnology have repeatedly called for mandatory labeling of such foods. Labeling would be generic and of limited value to consumers with respect to information regarding specific food allergies.",

Whether it be a concern regarding emerging foodborne illnesses, testing the safety of new foods derived from genetically manipulated organisms or their processed products to the sensitivity of subpopulations to specific chemicals found in foods, food toxicology is at the forefront. Food scientists and technologists can support the responsible introduction of GM techniques provided that issues of product safety, environmental concerns, information, and ethics are satisfactorily addressed. Many consider that they are being addressed by the food toxicologist and need intensively to continue to be addressed. Only in this way may the benefits that this technology can provide become available to help feed the world's escalating population in the coming decades. The study of food toxicology includes an appreciation of contamination of the food chain from drinking water, raw materials, via preservation and processing, and those chemicals that might result from genetic modification. Novel foods and the use of functional ingredients (functional foods) represent other areas where a knowledge of food toxicology would be beneficial. Food toxicology is also concerned with natural toxins in food plants and animals, cancer modulating substances, mycotoxins, and all groups of contaminants such as pesticides, persistent organic pollutants, metals, packaging materials, hormones, and animal drug residues. Also, the role of genetic polymorphisms, gender, and lifestyle factors on the sensitivity of humans for toxic compounds, and biomarkers to assess these effects should be included in future research goals of food toxicology.",
