Method A retrospective observational study was conducted in a partially vaccinated sample of healthcare workers in a medical centre in the southern part of Taiwan. A convenience sample of 500 employees received a questionnaire. Main outcome measure Incidence of influenza like-illness (ILI), rates of absenteeism and costs savings. Results A final number of 407 returned questionnaires could be evaluated. Forty respondents were not vaccinated. The incidence of ILI was lower in the vaccinated group than the nonvaccinated group (13.6 vs. 15%). Fever was the most frequently occurring ILI. Rate of absenteeism because of ILI in the non-vaccinated employees was higher than in the group of vaccinated employees. The costs per saved lost working day was US $ 36. Conclusion Free influenza vaccination may cause reduc-tions in incidence, absenteeism, and costs associated with ILI in healthcare workers in Taiwan.",

It is the first country in Asia to implement an influenza vaccination program by the health authority for all hospital health care at no charge since the outbreak of SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome). The influenza vaccine is also available for the general public not included in the above groups, but with a charge. Almost all hospital employees are reported to receive the vaccine. Overall, about 68.4% of people in high-risk groups and about 10% of the general population receive the vaccine each year [1]. This high vaccination rate can be attributed to the fact that risk-groups receive it free of charge, and also to the promotion of vaccination in the mass media. In November 2005 about 60% of the high-risk groups received the vaccine because of the fear for the outbreak of the bird-flu.",

The main reasons given for not being vaccinated were: do not think it was needed, not aware of the vaccine and concerned about side-effects as well as low effectiveness of the vaccine. But the vaccination rates in our country are almost 100%, because our health authority provides the influenza vaccination program to all healthcare workers at no charge. This mass vaccination program is expensive, and there are only very few studies that evaluate the cost-effectiveness of an implemented vaccination program, except some studies conducted nearly two decades ago. Therefore, we conducted this pilot study to assess whether the mass vaccination program for all healthcare workers was cost-effective.",

The bias may result from the fact that the number of non-vaccinated subjects was much lower than the number of vaccinated subjects. This big difference in the number of employees in the two groups was due to the provision of free vaccination and the requirement that all employees should be vaccinated. The average experience of employees in non-vaccinated subjects was less than in the vaccinated subjects (Table 1) . The incidence of post-vaccination adverse effects was 32.7% in the vaccinated subjects. This is a low figure compared to published data (63.8%) of the western country for general healthy workers [9] . The high incidence of vaccine-related adverse events in this study could be the result of over-reporting by health care staff ( Table 2) .",
