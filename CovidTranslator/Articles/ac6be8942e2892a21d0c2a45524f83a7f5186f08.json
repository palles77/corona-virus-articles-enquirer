We aimed to evaluate the relation between vitamin D levels, viral infections and severity of attacks in children with recurrent wheezing. Materials and methods: A total of 52 patients who applied with wheezing, at the ages of 12---60 months with a history of three or more wheezing attacks in the last year and 54 healthy children were included. Sociodemographic data, risk factors for recurrent wheezing, and the severity of the wheezing attacks were recorded. 25(OH)D3, calcium, phosphor, alkaline phosphatase and parathormone levels of all children were measured. Nasopharyngeal samples of the patients for viruses were studied by multiplex polymerase chain reaction. Results: For the patient group, being breastfed for six months or less, history of cesarean section, cigarette exposure, humid home environment, and family history of allergic disease were significantly higher compared with the control group. Serum vitamin D levels in the patient group were significantly lower compared to the control group. There was no significant relationship between vitamin D levels and hospitalization, oxygen or steroid therapy.",

In some studies, vitamin D inadequacy was held responsible for the increase in asthma. 1 In one study, low vitamin D intake during pregnancy has been shown to increase recurrent wheezing around five years of age. 2 In another study, patients who received daily 2000 IU vitamin D regularly in their first year were found to have a higher risk of developing asthma compared to the group without vitamin D when they were 31 years of age. 3 As seen in different studies, different results were found between the intake of vitamin D and the development of asthma. Larger and randomized studies are needed to clarify this issue.",

            "text": "It has been recently determined that rhinovirus is a significant contributor to wheezing illnesses in young children and in the context of asthma. 4 Birth cohort studies have shown that atopic children have an increased tendency to develop asthma after rinovirus induced bronchiolitis. 5, 6 Some authors also speculated that pre-existing airway inflammation in children susceptible to asthma predisposes to rhinovirus infection. 7 Lukkarinen et al. 8 found that the first wheezing episode with rhinovirus predicted atopic asthma at school age. In a recent meta-analysis rhinovirus induced wheezing in the first three years of life was found to be related with subsequent development of wheezing/asthma. 9 Although there are studies about vitamin D levels in children and adults with asthma, the number of studies in children with recurrent wheezing before the age of five is quite low. 10 There are some studies investigating the relationship between wheezing and vitamin D, 11 wheezing and viral infections, 12 and viral infections and vitamin D. 13 There are also a few studies evaluating viral infections, vitamin D and acute wheezing, 14 but no study evaluating the three altogether was found in recurrent wheezing.",

Similarly, in many studies it has been reported that low levels of vitamin D may be a risk factor for recurrent wheezing. 10, 28 We found significantly lower vitamin D levels in children with recurrent wheezing compared to the control group. Vitamin D deficiency increased the risk of recurrent wheezing by 23.57 times. In a study by Turkeli et al., 29 102 patients with asthma and 102 healthy control group aged between one and four years were compared by means of asthma control, asthma severity and vitamin D levels. It was determined that asthma severity was higher and asthma control was more difficult in patients with asthma with low vitamin D levels. It is stated that while there is strong evidence that high vitamin D levels reduce the risk of asthma exacerbation, there is weaker evidence of asthma incidence, prevalence and severity of asthma. 30 In another study, no relation was found between the severity of asthma and vitamin D levels. 31 In our study, due to the low number of patients with a severe attack, no statistical data could be studied between the severity of attack and vitamin D.

More than one virus was found in 112 (39%) patients and of the viral coinfections, 51% involved rhinovirus and 35% involved HRSV. In our study, viral infection was detected in 38 (73%) of 52 children applying with recurrent wheezing attack. The most common viral agents were rhinovirus in 24 (63.2%) and HRSV in nine (23.7%). Coinfection was found in 14 (36.8%) of them. The data we obtained were consistent with the literature. Jarti et al. 14 found that the child's serum 25(OH)D3 level was inversely associated with HRSV, rhinovirus and multiple viral cause. They concluded that vitamin D might play a role in antiviral defense and might be important in infants exposed to RSV and in high asthma risk children exposed to rhinovirus. We found no significant difference between vitamin D levels and the presence of a virus in our study. The low number of subjects in the study groups, small sample size of the patients with severe attacks and the lack of data about vitamin D supplementations of the children were the limitations of the study.",
