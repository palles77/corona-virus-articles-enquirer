Each peptide was synthesized in a discrete well (455 peptides/card). The two miniPEPSCAN libraries were screened with three different monoclonal antibodies (Mabs). Two other random peptide libraries, expressed on the wall of bacteria (recombinant libraries) and composed of 107 hexa-and octapeptides, were screened with the same three Mabs. The aim of this study was to compare the amino acid sequence of peptides selected from small and large pools of random peptides and, in this way, investigate the potential of small random peptide libraries. The screening of the two miniPEPSCAN libraries resulted in the identification of a surprisingly large number of antibody-binding peptides, while the screening of the large recombinant libraries, using the same Mabs, resulted in the identification of only a small number of peptides. The large number of peptides derived from the small random peptide libraries allowed the determination of consensus sequences. These consensus sequences could be related to small linear and nonlinear parts of the respective epitopes. The small number of peptides derived from the large random peptide libraries could only be related to linear epitopes that were previously mapped using small libraries of overlapping peptides covering the antigenic protein. Thus, with respect to the cost and speed of identifying peptides that resemble linear and nonlinear parts of epitopes, small diversity libraries based on synthetic peptides appear to be superior to large diversity libraries based on expression systems.",

For the peptides containing glutamates, aspartates and/or arginines (Fig. 2) , the latter possibility seems not to be the case since these peptides, although this is not directly obvious, appear to mimic a nonlinear part of the epitope. The high turn propensity of PPNS in SRLPPNSDVVLG suggests that the Arg and the Asp are located spatially next to each other.

In the model of LDTSNPVKT, the Asp and the Lys are located spatially next to each other (Fig. 5 ). This suggests that the amino acids Asp and Lys in the peptides containing DK or KD mimic this spatial feature of LDT-SNPVKT or FDDTDPIKK. This suggestion is supported by a replacement analysis of LDTSNPVKT, showing that Asp and Lys cannot be replaced by any other residue [17] . Furthermore, since the Leu, Asp, Thr and Ser in LDTS cannot be replaced by lysine, and Pro, Val, Lys and Thr in PVKT cannot be replaced by aspartate [15] , the dipeptides DK or KD probably mimic a spatial arrangement of Asp near Lys.",

It has been shown that the concentration of peptide/surface area in a microtiter plate strongly affects antibody binding [20] . If the peptide concentration is low, antibodies bind only to sequences that represent a large part of the epitope. If the peptide concentration is very high, antibodies can bind to sequences that represent a relatively small part of the epitope. Thus, a relatively high concentration of peptides synthesized on PEPSCAN support and a relatively low concentration of peptides expressed on the wall of bacteria could also explain why much more peptides were derived from the miniPEPSCAN libraries in comparison to the recombinant libraries.",

            "text": "A question that remains is how useful are short consensus sequences such as SD, found with Mab 6A.A6, to understand antibody-antigen interactions. Do these sequences contribute significantly to the total binding energy? For various antigen Mab interactions it has been shown that within an epitope a 'hot spot' of only two to five residues contributes significantly to the total binding energy [11, 21] . Functional hot spots have also been found in hormone receptor binding interlaces. Recently, it has been shown that a hot spot containing a relatively small set of approximately eight residues dominates binding between growth hormone and its receptor [22, 23] . Thus, dipeptide sequences such as SD, found with Mab 6A.A6, IR, found with Mab 57.9 and DK, found with Mab 32F-81, may constitute such functional hot spots.",
