He may well have a key to the solution. If, in fact, he ''stopped doing it'' and a study was conducted on the waste being generated, beginning with the outside supply vendor all the way to the final disposal location, the results would serve to illustrate graphically the magnitude of the issue. The analysis of the issue does not start with the waste collector; it begins at the point of product purchase [1] . Waste minimization starts with reducing or eliminating it at the source. The most effective solutions can found by analyzing the multiple non-value-added processes, steps, and wasted personnel efforts that are significantly contributing to the problem throughout the facility. Begin with a careful analysis of surgically related products that enter the facility and then an inventory of all the purchased items that leave as a form of waste. Analyze the numbers of personnel required to order, manage an order, load materials, transfer and unload, stock in a warehouse, break down to the unit of issue, and discard cardboard containers. Calculate the number of times and the number of personnel required to transport these items to the point of use and the volumes of waste in the form of wrappers and containers collected.",

Between 2 and 4 million tons of hospital waste are generated and discarded annually from health care facilities alone [2] . Clearly, there have been advances in technology and surgical practices. New threats have been introduced that were not known or present in the days of complete nondisposable equipment, including HIV, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE), Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease (CJD), Acinetobacter, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), and other viruses that threaten to inflict disease on health care personnel and patients [3] . Reactions to these new threats appeared in the form of universal precaution standards and the Medical Waste Tracking Act (1988) [4] . By this time, disposable use was the norm and the natural tendency was to treat everything as infectious waste and send it to the incinerator. Economic and environmental variables soon joined the equation. The requirement to do it faster, better, less costly, and environmentally safe became the expectation.",

The remainder of the waste generated in the operating room in the form of solid waste or regular trash should comprise the remainder. From a typical cost perspective, red bag waste costs a facility 10 to 25 times the cost of solid waste [5] . The amount of waste generated daily in every business and organization in the United Sates is staggering compared with European nations. We have disposable containers, boxes, and paper and plastic bags for everything imaginable. A food court in a typical shopping mall requires one or more fulltime personnel to manage waste containers. Health care facilities are no exception, with the added problem of the confusion as to what might be potentially infectious. Up to 85% of waste that should be disposed as solid waste is instead placed in infectious waste containers [5, 6] .",

It is important to note that the requirements of some states for the management of RMW exceed those of other states. Maintain constant vigilance and an education process covering the range of personnel from the purchasing agent to the landfill contractor regarding the risks associated with hazardous and infectious waste. Establish flawless administrative and engineering controls to create, sustain, and maintain safe work practices [13] .",

The contents are subject to leaking if the lids or ports dislodge, potentially exposing waste management workers as the liquid waste is transferred and transported to the final destination. The liquid contents in a 3-L canister weigh 7.5 lb. Estimates per pound vary by state and location. Costs range from $0.60 to greater than $1.00 per canister. Transport the filled canisters to a soiled utility area, and pour the contents in a hopper utility sink into the normal waste water system. No formal research data are published indicating the prevalence of this practice; however, industry estimates are that from 30% to greater than 65% of facilities discard liquid surgical waste in this manner. This is the most economic practice for health care facilities and the one with the highest potential risks to staff and patients. Full personal protective equipment (PPE) is required while pouring the contents of liquid surgical waste. Normal practice suggests that gowns and gloves be removed before leaving the operating room by scrubbed personnel. This would require donning a new gown, gloves, and mask if the operating room staff is responsible for discarding waste at the completion of a procedure. This sets up discretionary PPE use negating safety, engineering controls, and compliance during operating room turnover. A 2006 survey of 340 members of the Association of Occupational Health Professionals (AOHP) in health care revealed the three most significant concerns for health care workers to be safe patient handling, blood-borne pathogen exposure, Fig. 3 . Surgical liquid waste disposal options. and respiratory protection. A total of 73.5% of those surveyed were specifically concerned about the exposure to blood and liquid waste [16] . The next alternative method involves adding a solidifying agent to the container to create a solid gelatinous mass. This eliminates the potential for fluid leakage but does not reduce the weight of the canister as RMW. A supplemental practice is the addition of sanitizing agents, including chlorine or glutaraldehyde. In some locations, states tolerate this as ''treated'' medical waste and allow the canister and contents to be disposed as solid waste (white bag). There are limited data supporting the safety and efficacy of this practice. Recently introduced are closed disposal systems. These are self-contained units that collect fluid waste at the surgical field and allow for disposition directly into the waste water system using hands-free and no-exposure methods. The primary advantages of these systems include the following: Minimize risk to staff by minimizing the number of times and the number of personnel required to handle the liquid waste. Reduce RMW and RMW transportation. Eliminate bulk weight and volume leaving the facility. It should be noted that all states, with the exception of the District of Columbia, allow this practice.",

Many debates and discussions were conducted in Association of periOperative Registered Nurses (AORN) forums with respect to the number of allowable patches per item, thread counts in cotton muslin products, and other issues related to suitability for use in surgical settings. Light tables, folding tables, and lint became history with the introduction of disposable packs. Manufacturers soon learned the art of marketing custom packs with every conceivable item being ''built'' into a single bundle, with the promise of cost savings in time, effort, and efficiency.

Most operating room supervisors, cognizant of muslin gowns and drapes, were not the least bit interested in revisiting those issues. The introduction of the disposable custom packs was a more than satisfactory solution. For a time AMSCO Sterilizer Company (STERIS, Mentor, Ohio) initiated plants throughout the country to provide nondisposable solutions in the way of sterile reprocessed drapes, gowns, and table and Mayo stand covers without winning the hearts and minds of those remembering the not so ''good old days'' of muslin. Ultimately, the AMSCO Sterilizer Company product and services were acquired by Sterile Recovery, Inc. (SRI, Elkridge, Maryland). SRI has the largest US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)approved reprocessing centers in the United States. The American Hospital Association reports 5747 registered hospitals in the United States [19] . SRI reports having 275 hospitals that use sterile nondisposable packs consisting of gowns, towels, back table covers, Mayo stand covers, and drapes. The company also reports 371 hospitals that use sterile nondisposable basin sets. Individual items currently being supplied in disposable custom packs, such as surgical sponges, Ascepto syringes, and suction tubing, are supplied by SRI with the nondisposable gown and drape pack. The disposable products are custom selected by individual customers and sterilized as a single unit, eliminating the need to open each item. Changes to the content of these disposable items can be easily altered without having to exhaust a 6-month supply of custom surgical drape packs currently provided by other vendors. Hospitals that use reprocessible surgical gowns and drapes, for example, do so under a service rather than a purchase contract. The service includes the supply of the sterile product from an FDA-regulated facility; the retrieval of the used product; and the return transport, laundering, inspecting, folding, and sterilizing of the items for reuse. This service is becoming available as an addition to primary vendor contracts for those facilities wishing to change to nondisposable use items but not wanting to lose the benefit of existing economic purchasing agreements.",

The relatively inexpensive costs of incineration of all waste provided an economic incentive for facilities to downsize personnel required to manage durable goods. That philosophy was sustainable and encouraged by the manufacturers of disposable sterile products. This past decade of these practices has resulted in dioxin and mercury emissions into the environment that are unacceptable. Incinerators are closing or being fined heavily for safety violations. Alternative and more expensive methods of waste disposal, specifically infectious and hazardous waste disposal, are driving cost upward at a rapid rate.",

It seems to be the time to reconsider the benefits and liabilities of our practice habits. In many instances, handling infectious materials less or not at all may have tremendous advantages that outweigh the simple economics involved. There may be a better balance in our practice. If a concept seems promising, it should be pursued with real research. In the absence of definitive, conclusive, and compelling unbiased scientific evidence, we are directed by industry rather than by our own profession.",
