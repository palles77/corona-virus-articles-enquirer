Indeed, there is evidence that history has been characterized by the constant interplay of humans and pathogens (McNeill, 1977) . However, it is impossible to say when the terms 'emerging infection' or 'emerging infectious diseases' were first used to describe new infectious diseases, or diseases that meet the criteria that are described in this article. The belief in the 1960s that the threat of infectious diseases had been eliminated in developed countries was unfounded. A broader view of history would have demonstrated this. One possible reason for the optimism is that the 1960s was a decade of optimism in general. In the United States, social programs were instituted to address inequities; humankind had not only orbited the Earth, but landed on the moon; the gains of science and technology were impressive; economic expansion was equally impressive; poliomyelitis had been all but eliminated in the United States; and the sense of 'control' was widespread.",

An infection does not necessarily represent a state of disease. 'Infection' suggests that an agent (usually a microbe) has become resident in the host. Usually that agent is replicating in the host. However, the host need not show any sign of disease, in the sense that it can conduct its normal activities without hindrance. 'Disease' is a state in which the normal functioning of the host is impaired, and both signs and symptoms are present -indeed, they are what limit normal function. An infectious disease is therefore a disease that is due to a pathogen. appeared de novo, or are being experienced in a region with greater intensity, or for the first time.",

Usually eradication is due to deliberate efforts on the parts of government and public health agencies. For example, malaria control programs following the end of World War II were instrumental in the elimination of malaria from some areas of the world, such as Italy and Spain. Sometimes, malaria eradication was eliminated as part of multisector development programs. For example, the Tennessee Valley Authority, created during the 1930s primarily for flood control, hydroelectric power, and economic development, also had an explicit aim of malaria control. This resulted in the drainage of most swamps, and the elimination of malaria from this part of the United States.",

Malaria, then, is a re-emerging disease. Another is tuberculosis. In many societies, TB had been nearly eliminated, but with the appearance of HIV/AIDS, immunocompromised individuals were much more susceptible to TB reactivation.

One was the meeting of the Pennsylvania Chapter of the American Legion. The events surrounding this meeting were the first to bring the attention of both the population and the broad scientific and medical communities to the argument that infectious diseases in the United States had been 'conquered,' and both alarmed the public and aroused the curiosity of the scientific and medical communities because this appeared to be a new disease. Indeed, before legionellosis was identified and antimicrobial treatment identified, legionellosis was called a 'monster disease. ' Over 220 members of the American Legion who had attended the meeting developed an unusual respiratory illness, and it became clear that it was of bacterial etiology, although it was initially thought to be viral, due to its close clinical resemblance to influenza. Approximately 34 people died as a result of this outbreak. However, two things remained unclear. First, the pathogen could not be identified with conventional methods, and second, no common source of exposure could be identified initially, although the fact that the number of incident cases followed a typical epidemic curve suggested very strongly that there was some sort of common exposure to the pathogen. The news media seized upon this medical 'mystery,' and the public knew that they were dealing with an unknown infectious disease. This constituted a historical moment in contemporary American history, because it had been decades since something like this had happened. Six months later, the bacterium was finally identified.",

Stored samples from outbreaks as early as 1943 tested positive for Legionella spp. However, the bacterium had not been identified in these outbreaks because it had not yet been described and characterized. In retrospect, most renowned is an outbreak that occurred in Pontiac, Michigan in 1968, although the symptoms were milder than in the Legionella outbreak in Philadelphia. In fact, mild legionellosis with a nonpneumonic form is often called 'Pontiac fever.' This is not the place to review the epidemiology, pathophysiology, and clinical aspects of legionellosis in depth. Briefly, though, it usually has an acute onset, and is usually caused by Legionella pneumophila, although other species are also pathogenic. In fact, there are 40 species of the genus, and numerous serotypes. Epidemiologically, L. pneumophila is by far the dominant species in human disease. The major reservoirs are bodies of freshwater, and the main mode of transmission is through small droplets that are inhaled from the environment. In the Philadelphia outbreak, the source was finally traced to the air conditioning system in the hotel in which most attendees were lodged; the attendees were inhaling small particles in certain parts of the building. Dozens of subsequent outbreaks have been traced to similar mechanisms. These have been not only air conditioners but also shower heads, aerosolizers in sinks, and whirlpools. Virtually anything that aerosolizes fresh water is a potential mechanism by which legionellosis may be transmitted.",

In late 1979 and 1980, a number of women in the United States became seriously ill with a syndrome characterized by high fever, shock, rash, hypotension, and capillary leak. This syndrome had been first described as such 2 years earlier, although in retrospect it had been noted in the medical literature in the 1920s. The 1978 paper identified toxic shock syndrome in males, females, and children -and the females were both menstruating and not menstruating. The 1980 outbreak was associated with menstruating women, many of whom were using superabsorbent tampons. Although this was a major risk factor in the 1979-80 outbreak, much of the public and many physicians were under the erroneous impression that toxic shock syndrome (TSS) was necessarily associated with menstruating women who were using superabsorbent tampons.

Amplification takes place as a result of media coverage, and as a result of intrapsychic processes that tend to amplify the threat of novel threats when the locus of control over the event is external to the individual. During the outbreak of toxic shock syndrome, newspapers were full of stories about TSS and the sometimes deadly consequences of developing the syndrome.

Now, in 2007, 29 years after it was first described, this label is more questionable. What was most significant about toxic shock syndrome, however, was its historical significance. It followed the outbreak of legionnaires disease so closely that it turned the public's attention, once again, to infectious diseases, and to infectious diseases that had been unknown. It also reminded the biomedical community that infectious diseases had not been conquered. The issue at the time was whether legionnaires disease and toxic shock syndrome were anomalies, whether the assumption of the conquest of infectious diseases had clearly been erroneous, or whether these two outbreaks were harbingers of a new stage in 'epidemiologic history'a historical period during which emerging infections would become common and would catch the attention of the public, the public health community, the medical community, and government agencies. The public health and medical communities were divided on this. It would soon become clear, however, that the latter would hold true -that emerging infectious diseases would come to the forefront of public health, epidemiology, and the medical community. In the cases of legionnaires disease and TSS, the social amplification of risk exaggerated perceived threats. Nonetheless, the public became more attentive to infection. Two other phenomena would solidify this attention. One was the appearance of HIV/AIDS in the United States, and the other was public attention that was drawn to hemorrhagic fevers, mostly in Africa.",

It was not called 'AIDS' until 1982, when the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) gave the syndrome that label. In the same year, researchers at CDC also linked one of the pathways of transmission to blood and blood products, causing a great deal of public concernif it was possible to contract AIDS through a frequently used medical practice, it had the potential of affecting millions of people. Until then, AIDS was thought to be restricted to the gay community. In 1983, blood banks were warned by the CDC that blood and blood products could definitely transmit AIDS, and surgeons and other medical personnel began rethinking the criteria necessary for transfusion. By 1983, it was clear that the exponential increase in the number of incident cases was a definite trend. In 1983 and 1984, two teams discovered that the pathogen causing AIDS was viral, and although it had a different nomenclature at first, there was a great deal of relief that the causal agent had been discovered. It is an interesting study in the sociology of science to analyze the competing claims by Luc Montagnier at the Institut Pasteur and Robert Gallo in the United States concerning their respective claims that they discovered HIV.

A minority of authorities argue that the probability is low. Thus, in assessing the overall threat of avian influenza, the crucial question is whether the virus will spread readily from human to human. At this point (mid-2007) , it is unknown whether this will occur. However, it is prudent public health policy to bolster surveillance systems, and governments are stockpiling neuraminidase inhibitors, which are medications that can moderate the course of influenza if taken early in the course of clinical disease, or sometimes prevent the onset of symptoms if taken prophylactically.

Accordingly, the Institute of Medicine of the National Research Council of the United States took a proactive role and sought funding for a major study of emerging infections. The study was funded by a number of government units, and in early 1991, a high-powered committee met in Washington for the first time to: identify significant emergent infectious diseases, determine what might be done to deal with them, and recommend how similar future threats might be confronted to lessen their impact on public health.

It is notable that five of these six factors are social factors that are consequences of changes in society. Even microbial adaptation and change, such as the development of antimicrobial resistance as a response to selective pressure, has a large behavioral dimension. This is partly a response to a technical innovation -the development of antimicrobials -and partly a response to a behaviorthe prescribing of those antimicrobials. Of course, one dimension of this factor is the nonselective and improper prescribing of antimicrobials. This has several dimensions: The prescription of antibiotics when none are needed, the prescription of broad-spectrum antibiotics when narrowspectrum antibiotics are sufficient, the free availability of antibiotics in many developing countries on the street and in pharmacies where no prescription is needed, and the free use of late-generation antibiotics in the food industry to promote the growth of cattle, chickens, and other animals intended for human consumption. So, in fact, all of the six factors of emergence are social and behavioral in nature.",

The main point is that the overwhelming understanding of emerging infections has been 'biomedical.' This is not a criticism of either the journal or of any field in public health or medicine.

What is novel about the past few decades is greater interconnection between places, allowing diseases, and news of diseases, to spread; better methods of detection; and changing settlement geographies that have brought people into different forms of contact with animal reservoirs. The root cause of the infectious disease emergence is human action, both intentional and unintentional. Most of this action is the result of cumulative individual acts on a mass scale. For example, the mass urbanization of society in poorer countries is the sum of millions of individuals who move from rural to urban areas. This is largely the result of the perceived economic opportunities in urban areas, and the 'push' factor of lack of opportunity in rural areas. Yet, taken together, millions of individual moves result in urbanization, and this urbanization facilitates the spread of diseases by the respiratory route, the fecal-oral route, and many other modes of transmission.",

Three of these were E. coli 0157:H7, cryptosporidiosis, and hantavirus. The report was prescient, because within a few years there were serious outbreaks of all of these. In 1993, which was the year after the IOM report was issued, there was a major outbreak of cryptosporidiosis on the south side of Milwaukee, Wisconsin. It caused diarrhea, ranging from mild to severe, in over 400 000 people. Cryptosporidium parvum is a protozoan parasite; evidence in animal models is that ingestion of even one oocyst can result in severe gastrointestinal symptoms. In humans, as few as 12 oocysts can produce these effects (King and Monis, 2007) . It is impervious to usual methods of water treatment, and only recently has an effective medication become available. The Milwaukee outbreak was probably due to groundwater absorption of cattle feces, subsequent runoff due to both heavy rains and snow melting, transport of the oocysts to river tributaries, and movement of the oocysts into Lake Michigan, which serves as the water supply for the south side of Milwaukee. The filtration plant for that water was ineffective in eliminating the oocysts. Many of these events are putative, but together they constitute a logical chain. Meanwhile, research is still proceeding on the ecology of cryptosporidiosis. Understanding is progressing, but it is still incomplete.",

First, because meat inspection in the United States was inadequate, one theory is that E. coli 0157:H7 from the bowels of cattle had gotten into meat that was sent to market when cattle were slaughtered, and the bowel was probably nicked or severed. Another is that under stress, cattle defecate over one another, and fecal matter from one cow can contaminate the hides of other cattle. Second, when this meat was ground into hamburger, it increased the surface area of the meat by several orders of magnitude, thereby allowing the pathogen a great deal of exposure. Third, once this hamburger meat was shipped to Jack in the Box restaurants, it appears that hamburgers were being systematically undercooked, below industry standards. This allowed the E. coli to survive and enter the hosts' systems. The consequences of such infection can be severe, and were in 1993, with those who were symptomatic frequently suffering from bloody diarrhea, fever, cramps, and, in the worst case, hemolytic uremic syndrome. The pathogenesis of this disease was only partially understood in 1993, but understanding is more complete in 2007.",

In May 1993, in the Four Corners area of Arizona, New Mexico, California, and Utah, several males who were otherwise in good health developed a sudden serious respiratory disease that was thought to be a rapidly progressing acute respiratory distress syndrome, since this was the immediate cause of death. However, it was noted that these cases had formed a cluster, and investigators tried to find some sort of common source to explain a possible environmental exposure to explain this serious and sometimes fatal syndrome. Though hantavirus had never been described in the United States, serologic tests in patients showed a surprising seropositivity to hantavirus. It was apparent that this was the pathogen that had caused the dozen deaths associated with the outbreak. The chain of events that led up to the outbreak is now fairly clear. Winter 1993 was unusually warm in the Four Corners area as a result of El Nino, and the spring was also unusually rainy. These two conditions led to the rapid and plentiful growth of pinon trees, which provided food for a number of rodents. There is consensus that the deer mouse (Peromyscus maniculatus) population increased by an order of magnitude. Testing demonstrated that about 30% of the mice that were trapped after this epidemic were infected with hantavirus, and studies demonstrate that households from which infected individuals came were far more likely to have heavy rodent infestations than were households of controls. More rigorous studies eventually showed that transmission occurred from rats to humans, and that many of the cases, in this instance, were associated with crawling under houses and other places in which rodent exposure was likely to occur.",
