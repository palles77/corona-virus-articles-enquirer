The entire genome has a GC content of 41.81 %. The genomic organization of SHQP/ YM/2013, which is typical of all previously characterized PEDV strains, is summarized as follows: (Table 1 ). UTRs were found at both ends: the 5 0 UTR was 292 nt long with a relatively high GC content of 44.86 % when compared with the whole genome. The 3 0 UTR of 334 nt was present immediately downstream of the N gene of the genome and had Two open reading frames, ORFs 1a and 1b, reside in the first two thirds of the SHQP/YM/2013 genome and are translated into non-structural proteins 1a and 1b. Replicase 1a was predicted to encode a protein of 4103 aa, while replicase 1b was predicted to encode a protein of 2678 aa. Nucleotide sequence analysis revealed that there were no deletions or insertions in the replicase gene of any of the PEDV strains. Both the replicase 1a and the replicase 1b proteins were highly conserved, while the replicase 1b protein exhibited the highest amino acid sequence similarity among strains (99.0 %-99.9 %) ( Table 2 ). The frameshift ''slippery sequence'' UUUAAAC [4] in ORF1b was identified in SHQP/YM/2013, as shown in Fig. 1 . The sequences downstream of UUUAAAC were predicted to form a pseudoknot to support the translational frameshift [4, 10, 12] . Based on analysis of the nucleotide sequences of the PEDV ORF1a and ORF1b, all of the PEDV strains could be divided into three groups ( Fig. 2A and B) . Group 1 comprised one Chinese strain (LZC), one Korean strain (SM98) and one European strain (CV777). Group 2 consisted of vaccine strains (attenuated DR13) and two Chinese PEDV field strains (SD-M and JS2008). Group 3 was made up of virulent DR13, 10 USA strains isolated in 2013 and 16 Chinese strains (except CH/S), which were isolated from China during PED outbreaks in 2011-2013.",

Group 2 comprised two vaccine strains (the attenuated strains DR13 and CV777 vs), two Europe strains (CV777 and Br1/87), two Korean field strain (SM98 and virulent DR13), three strains from Japan (parent 83p-5, 100th-passaged 83p-5 and MK) and 12 strains from China, including six field strains from 2011.

The M gene had a conserved ATAAAC sequence 11 nucleotides upstream of the initiator ATG, as previously recognized in Br1/87 [9] . There was a highly conserved domain of 12 amino acids (SWWSFNPETDAL) located at aa 108 to 119. These residues are almost completely conserved across the entire family Coronaviridae [1] . Sequence analysis of the complete M gene showed that the PEDVs fell into three groups (Fig. 2D) .

Based on phylogenetic analysis of ORF3, all of the PEDV strains could be divided into three groups (Fig. 2F) . One group had two subgroups (1-1 and 1-2). Seven Chinese field isolates from 2011-2012 formed one subgroup (1-1), and three Chinese field isolates (CH/GSJIII/07, JS2008 and SD-M) formed the second subgroup (1-2), together with vaccine strains (the attenuated DR13 and CV777 vs) and the DBI865 Korean field isolate. The second group included the CV777, Br1/87, SM98 and LZC strains. The third group, containing six Korean field isolates, 10 USA field isolates from 2013 and 19 Chinese isolates, had two subgroups (3-1 and 3-2). Two Korean strains (virulent DR13 and Chinju99) and the Chinese field isolate formed one subgroup (G3-1), and 18 Chinese field strains, including SHQP/YM/2013, formed the second subgroup (G3-2) with 10 USA field isolates from 2013 and four Korean field isolates from 2007.",

According to the investigation of the pig farm during the outbreak, about 90 % of piglets presented typical clinical signs of PED, and most of them died, whereas none of the sows immunized with CV777 showed any clinical signs. However, we also detected PEDV in sows' milk, which suggests vertical transmission of the virus, as reported previously [20] .",

As in other coronaviruses, the S and ORF3 genes have been hypothesized to be important in the virulence and pathogenesis of PEDV infections [3, 8, 19, 22] . The S protein is known to play pivotal roles in interacting with cellular receptors to mediate viral entry and in inducing neutralizing antibodies in the natural host [2, 5, 11] . The same amino acid insertions and deletion of the S gene were observed among prevailing PEDV strains The complete ORF3 gene sequence and phylogenetic analysis showed that all of the Chinese PEDV strains fell into three groups, and again the recent prevalent Chinese PEDV field isolates were divided into two different groups (group 1 and group 3). Eighteen Chinese field strains, including SHQP/YM/2013, formed the second subgroup (G3-2) with 10 USA field isolates from 2013 and four Korean field isolates from 2007. These strains are genetically different from the CV777 and attenuated DR13 vaccine strains (G1-2), which have been used for prevention of PEDV infection in China. Therefore, recent prevalent Chinese PEDV field isolates represent a new genotype that differs from the genotype that includes the vaccine strains. Based on phylogenetic analysis of the M gene, S gene and ORF3 gene, our study has demonstrated that the prevalent PEDV isolates in China may have originated from Korean strains.",

Although the bi-combined commercial vaccines (inactivated transmissible gastroenteritis [TGEV H] and porcine epidemic diarrhea [CV777]) against TGEV and PEDV infection are used on swine farms, PED still occurs in immunized pig herds in China. This shows that these vaccines are no longer able to confer protection. Therefore, it is necessary to investigate further the molecular biology, as well as the mechanisms of immunogenicity and pathogenesis, of PEDV. There is an urgent need to develop more effective vaccines to prevent outbreaks of PEDVinduced diarrhea.",

The putative slippery sites are represented by the dotted-line box, the stems are boxed, the loops are indicated by thick dark lines, and the 144 nucleotides (N144) are boxed in gray 46.41 % GC content. Seven coding regions, respectively, encode four structural proteins (S [nt 20,634 to 24,794], E [nt 25,449 to 25,679], M [nt 25,687 to 26,367], and N [nt 26,379 to 27,704]), two nonstructural proteins (replicase 1a [nt 293 to 12,601] and replicase 1b [nt 12,601 to 20,637]), and the single accessory protein, ORF3 (nt 24,794 to 25,468). The nucleotide and amino acid (aa) sequence identities of different regions of the SHQP/YM/2013 genome were compared with another 32 PEDV strains (Table 2). The SHQP/YM/2013 genome exhibited identities ranging from 96.6 % to 99.8 % to other strains; the highest level of similarity, with JS-HZ2012, was 99.8 %. The 5 0 UTR of SHQP/YM/2013 shared 96.6 %-99.3 % identity with other PEDV strains. The 3 0 UTR of SH/YM/2013 showed greater genetic conservation than the 5 0 UTR and displayed 97.3 %-99.8 % homology to other PEDV stains.",

Our study showed that all of the PEDV strains fell into three groups. Recent prevalent Chinese PEDV field isolates were divided into two different groups (group 2 and group 3), which shows that two different genotypes are prevalent in China. The prevalent PEDV isolates in China, including SHQP/YM/2013, are most closely related to 10 USA strains from 2013 and four Korean field strains from 2008-2009.",
