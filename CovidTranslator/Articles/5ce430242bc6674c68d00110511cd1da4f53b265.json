Sixty-two patients started oseltamivir therapy within a median of 5 (IQR, 4-6) days from the onset of illness, and 31 received IV corticosteroids. ARDS developed in 33 patients, and 24 were treated initially with noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV). In this group, NPPV was successful in 13 patients (54.2%). Nine patients died at a median of 16 (IQR, 10-24) days after onset of illness. Multivariate Cox regression identifi ed two independent risk factors for death: progressive dyspnea after resolution of fever (relative risk, 5.852; 95% CI, 1.395-24.541; P 5 .016) and a higher APACHE (Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation) II score on presentation (relative risk for each point, 1.312; 95% CI, 1.140-1.511; P , .001). At 3-month follow-up of survivors with A(H1N1), ground-glass opacities were still present, although diminished, in 85.7%, and diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide was mildly reduced in 61.5%.",

As of March 7, 2010, \u0546 16,713 laboratoryconfi rmed cases of death have been reported by the six world regions. 5 In mainland China, there were . 127,000 confi rmed cases up to February 28, 2010, including 793 deaths. 6 Many studies have been published on the clinical manifestations of A(H1N1) pneumonia during the acute phase of illness, [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] but no information has been reported on symptoms and radiographic and lung function changes in convalescence. We studied clinical manifestations during the acute phase, antiviral and corticosteroid therapy, noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV), and the histopathologic changes of a fatal case. Survivors were followed up after discharge for a period of 3 months. We believe Patient follow-up and further investigation at follow-up were carried out according to clinical need, so written informed consent was not sought. High-resolution CT (HRCT) scanning was ordered only in those with persisting symptoms, chest signs, or radiologic fi ndings on discharge or on last visit. No contrast was given with CT scan, and the possible radiation harm was also explained to patients. Lung function tests (LFTs) were ordered in those patients still attending at 3 months. The ethics board committee at Beijing Chao-Yang Hospital approved the study design.",

However, in our study, community-acquired bacterial infection (defi ned as sputum collected within 48 h of hospitalization) was detected in only one of 50 patients ( K pneumoniae ). The low yield of gram-positive bacteria before or within 48 h of hospitalization may be due to the widespread use of prophylactic antibiotic therapy. In contrast, nosocomial infection was common in the patients (12/50 [24.0%]), and gram-negative bacilli were the predominant causative pathogens. Aspergillus spp was also seen. Progressive A(H1N1) infection, intubation, a prolonged hospital stay, IV antibiotic use, and use of oral or IV corticosteroids may be risk factors for nosocomial infection caused by gram-negative bacilli and Aspergillus spp.",

Nonetheless, GGOs were still found at 3 months, although no fi brotic changes were seen. In survivors of A(H5N1) virus infection, persistent radiologic abnormalities including GGOs, often with a reticular pattern, have been seen as long as 1 year after illness onset. 19 In survivors of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) followed for 1 year, marked improvements in pulmonary fi brosis have been seen, but some patients still had residual changes. 20 Because this kind of fi brosis was reversible, it has been suggested that these fi ndings were partially caused by postinflammatory atelectasis rather than by genuine fi brosis alone. 21 The resolution of lung abnormalities in patients with A(H1N1) viral pneumonia seemed better than that seen in patients with SARS and infl uenza A(H5N1) infection. Impairment of D lco was the most common (8/13 [61.5%]) abnormality in lung function testing 3 months after the onset of illness, followed by restrictive defects (2/13 [15.4%] ). The D lco fi ndings were similar to the fi ndings of one study of patients with SARS at 3-month follow-up visits. 22 The impairment of D lco in survivors of SARS persisted for 1 year in 23.7% of patients reported by other investigators. 23 Although the number of cases with LFTs in our series is limited (only 13 cases, of whom eight had a reduction of D lco ), it seemed that patients who had bilateral GGOs on HRCT scan were more likely to have an impaired D lco . During the convalescent period of ARDS, GGOs may consist of intralobular fi brosis that is below the limits of resolution of HRCT scanning. 24 A longer follow-up study is needed to determine whether lung function abnormalities in patients infected with A(H1N1) are irreversible and radiologic changes persist over time.",
