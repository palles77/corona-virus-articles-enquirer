For prokaryotic expression of recombinant SARS-CoV N protein and a fragment of the S protein (amino acid positions 318-510), we followed the instructions of the Champion pET Directional TOPO Expression kit (Invitrogen, Karlsruhe, Germany) using plasmids pET101-N and pET102-Saa318-510. Purifi cation and refolding of the protein on column were done as described previously (12) .

The IF test is known to be less sensitive than ELISA but still provided confi rmation in one third of the serum specimens tested. The negative results in the viral neutralization tests are not unexpected because this assay detects only antibodies that interfere with the specifi c entry mechanism of SARS-CoV, and putative group 4 CoVs from African bats may not use it. Moreover, deletions and mutations found in Asian bat SARS-like-CoV isolates lie in the S protein region essential for binding of SARS-CoV to the cellular receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, and thus are likely to affect cross-neutralization, as emphasized by confl icting results obtained in Asia (6, 7, 15) . The negative fi ndings obtained in RT-PCR can be explained by the unlikelihood of fi nding virus nucleic acid in serum. Studies in Asia used rectal swabs instead of serum samples, and the virus likely persists in the enteric tract but may not be found in serum at all.",
