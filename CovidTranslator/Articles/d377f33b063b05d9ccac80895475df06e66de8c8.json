Methods: Patients hospitalized with ILI were included in this prospective, multicentre study carried out in six French hospitals during three consecutive influenza seasons (2012e2015). RSV and other respiratory viruses were detected by multiplex PCR in nasopharyngeal swabs. Risk factors for RSV infection were identified by backward stepwise logistic regression analysis. Results: A total of 1452 patients hospitalized with ILI were included, of whom 59% (861/1452) were >65 years and 83% (1211/1452) had underlying chronic illnesses. RSV was detected in 4% (59/1452), and influenza virus in 39% (566/1452). Risk factors for RSV infection were cancer (adjusted OR 2.1, 95% CI 1.1 e4.1, p 0.04), and immunosuppressive treatment (adjusted OR 2.0, 95% CI 1.1e3.8, p 0.03). Patients with RSV had a median length of stay of 9 days (6e25), and 57% of them (30/53) had complications, including pneumonia (23/53, 44%) and respiratory failure (15/53, 28%) . Fifteen per cent (8/53) were admitted to an intensive care unit, and the in-hospital mortality rate was 8% (4/53). Pneumonia was more likely to occur in patients with RSV than in patients with RSV-negative ILI (44% (23/53) versus 26% (362/1393), p 0.006) or with influenza virus infection (44% versus 28% (157/560), p 0.02).",

However, for reasons of cost and the lack of RSV-specific antiviral drugs, adult inpatients with influenza-like illness (ILI) are frequently not tested for RSV but rather only tested for influenza virus. Influenza surveillance systems based on ILI and acute respiratory illness definitions are unsuitable for capturing cases of RSV in children and adults [9e11] . More studies are needed to determine the burden of RSV infection, and to characterize at-risk populations that could be targeted by vaccination and antiviral treatment. The aims of this study were to describe (a) the prevalence, (b) the clinical features, and (c) the outcome of RSV infection in adults hospitalized with ILI.",

FLUVAC is a French prospective observational study of influenza vaccine efficacy conducted in six university hospitals (Cochin Hospital, Paris; Bichat Hospital, Paris; Pontchaillou Hospital, Rennes; Limoges Hospital; University Hospital, Montpellier; Edouard Herriot Hospital, Lyon). The FLUVAC study design is further described in Rondy et al. and Loubet et al. [12, 13] . Each season, enrolments take place during periods of influenza circulation (from November to March). Data on adults hospitalized for at least 24 h for ILI, with symptom onset <7 days before sampling, were collected. ILI was defined as a combination of the following: (a) at least one of the following systemic symptoms: fever (38 C), headache, myalgia or malaise, and (b) at least one of the following respiratory symptoms: cough, sore throat or dyspnoea [14] . Each participant was interviewed, and nasopharyngeal samples were obtained at enrolment.",

In another study, Falsey et al. reported a 10% (142/1388) prevalence of RSV among adults aged 65 years or with underlying cardiopulmonary diseases who were admitted with acute respiratory symptoms during four consecutive winters in Rochester, NY [1] . Several reasons may explain the broad range of reported RSV detection rates. For example, our study was restricted to periods of influenza virus circulation, which may not have included the peak of RSV circulation, although enrolments in the two studies by Falsey et al. started in mid-November. Another factor is age: we included all adults >18 years, whereas Sundaram et al. and Falsey et al. included only older subjects, in whom RSV infection may be more frequent. Furthermore, the laboratory methods used in the Rochester study included viral culture and serological tests, and RT-PCR was the only positive test in only two-thirds of cases.

These findings are consistent with the literature [1, 20] . Similar percentages were noted in the influenza group of our study. Patients with RSV were significantly more likely than patients with influenza or without RSV to develop pneumonia (44% versus 28% and 26%, respectively). Falsey et al. and Lee et al. also found a high rate of pneumonia among 159 RSV-infected patients >65 years admitted for ILI in the USA (70/159, 44%) and among 607 RSV-infected adults admitted to three hospitals in Hong Kong (261/603, 43%) [20, 21] . Jain et al. [22] found at least one respiratory virus in 23% of 2259 American adults with communityacquired pneumonia requiring admission to one of five participating hospitals between 2010 and 2012. RSV was found in 3% (67/ 2259) of all patients.",

Several limitations must, however, be acknowledged. First, as all the participating centres were teaching hospitals, the proportion of patients with underlying diseases may have been higher than in the general ILI population, owing to a referral bias. Second, although the sample was large, the study was probably underpowered to identify a possible impact of RSV on morbidity and mortality in multivariate analysis. Third, the ILI definition used here captures only a subset of RSV infections [10] . Our study does not reflect the real burden of severe RSV infection, which may include other clinical manifestations. Fourth, we report post hoc results of the FLUVAC study, which was not designed to answer this research question. Indeed, as the FLUVAC study was designed to assess influenza vaccine efficacy, patients were enrolled during periods of influenza virus circulation, which differ slightly from periods of RSV circulation. This means that our data reflect the prevalence of RSV among patients hospitalized for ILI during periods of influenza virus circulation and not during peak RSV circulation, which usually occurs earlier, owing to epidemiological interference [23] . However, French surveillance data (RENAL system) show that the peak of the RSV epidemic overlapped with the beginning of influenza virus circulation during the three seasons of interest, and that the two viruses co-circulated for at least 2e3 weeks (Fig. 3) .",
