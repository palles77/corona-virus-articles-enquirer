It is the same in the two DOAS that outdoor air must remove the whole humidity load and part of the sensible load, and the indoor sensible cooling unit handles the other part of the sensible load. But the means of dehumidification is different. In the hybrid DOAS, outdoor air, the process air, is dehumidified when passing through the desiccant wheel. In this process, its temperature increases, which is the result of the dehumidification effect and the heat transfer from the regeneration airstream via the desiccant wheel. As the process air flows through the heat recovery wheel, the heating effect is partially offset by transferring heat from the process air to the cooler incoming regeneration air. The process air is further cooled to the required temperature in the chiller 1, and then enters the room. The whole psychrometric process is shown in Fig. 3(b) , and it can be seen that there is truly no limitation on the dew-point temperature in the suggested hybrid DOAS.",

Energy consumption of chiller1 in the hybrid DOAS is always smaller than that in the conventional DOAS, because chiller1 in the hybrid DOAS only handles part of the sensible load, while chiller1 in the conventional DOAS handles the entire humidity load and part of the sensible load, which are larger, and COP of chiller1 in the hybrid DOAS can be higher than that in the conventional DOAS. In the two DOAS, chiller2 handles the same sensible load and has the same COP, so energy consumptions of chiller2 are equal. Compared with the conventional DOAS, energy consumption of the heater in the hybrid DOAS is higher when electricity or natural gas is used. If solar energy is used for heating the regeneration air, it can be simply considered that no energy consumed for the heater, so the total energy consumption for the hybrid DOAS is lowest. But, if electricity is used, the total energy consumption for the hybrid DOAS is highest. These results agree with the findings based on the experiments in Ref. [6] . When natural gas is used, the result will vary with mass flow rates of ventilation air. For example, when the mass flow rates of ventilation air takes 0.833 kg/s, the total energy consumption for the hybrid DOAS is 6.6% less than that of the conventional DOAS, while it takes a larger value, 6.667 kg/s, 22.5% more energy is consumed for the hybrid DOAS. Fig. 7 depicts COP of the two DOAS. In the hybrid DOAS, COP of chiller1 and chiller2 will not change, no matter what kind of energy is used for regeneration, but COP of the whole air conditioning system (ACS) is not the same that it is highest if solar energy is used, while lowest with electricity used.",

According to Fig. 8 , it is certain that the total energy consumption rises as ventilation air flow rate increases, because of more ventilation air flow rate, more humidity load and sensible load. In the total energy consumption, based on the same reason, energy consumption for chiller1 and heater also goes up. However, energy consumption for chiller2 reduces, the reason for which is that since the total indoor sensible load is invariable, increase in the part of this sensible load handled by chiller1 leads to reduction in the part handled by chiller2 that, in turn, reduces the energy consumption for chiller2.",

When temperature or humidity of outdoor air rises, chiller1 has to handle more sensible heat load due to the dehumidification, so its energy consumption increases too. As to chiller2, humidity of outdoor air exerts no effect on the indoor sensible load handled by it, as well as its energy consumption. However, higher outdoor air temperature leads to greater indoor sensible load, as inferred from Table 6 . So, chiller2 is required to handle more sensible load, with energy consumption increasing. According to Fig. 10(c) , energy consumption for DDS goes up greatly as outdoor air humidity rises, while temperature of outdoor air only has slight effect on that, which is determined by the change of regeneration temperature of the DDS. Consequently, based on the energy consumptions of the components, the total energy consumption increases with the increasing temperature or humidity of outdoor air.",

As solar energy is used, the energy consumption for the suggested DOAS is lowest. (However, depending on the application, the initial cost of the solar equipment may neglect the saving achieved in the cooling and dehumidification process.) Natural gas is also a better choice for regeneration. But, if electricity is used to heat the regeneration airstream, the suggested DOAS will have the largest energy consumption and poorer COP. (2) More ventilation air flow rate, more energy consumption and lower COP for the suggested DOAS. Therefore, a smaller ventilation air flow rate is appropriate. (3) Temperature and humidity of outdoor air have great effects on energy consumption and COP for the suggested DOAS. The energy consumption increases with the rising of the temperature or humidity of outdoor air, and the COP goes up when the outdoor air temperature rises or the humidity decreases. Considering these effects, in order to keep steady indoor conditions, it is important to adjust the chillers and the DDS, respectively, in response to the change of outdoor conditions. Consequently, an optimal control module for that is required. (4) There is an optimum regeneration to process flow ratio leading to the lowest energy consumption for dehumidification. Accordingly, it is significant to determine this ratio.",
