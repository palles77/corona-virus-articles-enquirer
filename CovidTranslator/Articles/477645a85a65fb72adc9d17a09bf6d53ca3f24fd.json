During the development of the guidelines, other veterinary recommendations on antimicrobial treatment [1] [2] [3] [4] and corresponding guidelines for human medicine were evaluated, with consideration of the differences among species. 5, 6 The committee unanimously believes that there are limitations in objective, published information relevant to the treatment of bacterial respiratory diseases in dogs and cats. Thus, the Working Group used a modification of the Delhi method for consensus building in the development of these guidelines. 7 The Working Group reviewed the literature and met in person to develop the initial draft of the guidelines. This was followed by a number of revisions completed electronically in an attempt to build consensus with the wording of each recommendation within the Working Group. The Working Group recommendations were then provided to all guidelines committee members who were asked to independently select whether they agreed, were neutral, or disagreed with a recommendation. A updated draft of the document was then completed and provided to 6 experts in the field that were not members of the Working Group who were asked to rate each recommendation by means of the same system. For those recommendations that received any \"disagree\" votes from the 17 total reviewers (Working Group and outside reviewers), the percentage distribution of all reviewers and appropriate comments are presented.",

Rather, they should be considered the basis of decision-making, with the potential that different or additional approaches might be required in some cases.

The Working Group recommends empirical administration of doxycycline (Tables 1 and 2) for 7-10 days to cats with suspected acute bacterial URI as the first-line antimicrobial option. 27, 28 The Working Group believes that doxycycline is a good first choice because it is well tolerated by cats; most B. bronchiseptica isolates from cats are susceptible to doxycycline in vitro (by unapproved standards for testing), despite resistance to other agents such as beta-lactams and sulfonamides, [29] [30] [31] and doxycycline is effective in vivo for the treatment of cats with C. felis infections, 27, [32] [33] [34] and Mycoplasma spp. infections. 35 Doxycycline is also effective for the treatment of a variety of chlamydial and mycoplasma infections in cats and other Minocycline has been substituted in some situations when doxycycline is unavailable or of greater expense. See Table 2 for dose recommendations. b Culture and antimicrobial susceptibility testing = C&S. c For animals with clinical findings of life-threatening disease, the consensus of the Working Group was to administer dual agent treatment parenterally with the potential for de-escalation of treatment and switch to oral drugs based on clinical responses and culture and antimicrobial susceptibility testing. See Table 2 for dose differences by route and the text for further recommendations for oral or parenteral administration. d Enrofloxacin is often chosen as there is a veterinary product for parenteral administration and the drug has a wide spectrum against Gram-negative organisms and Mycoplasma spp. There are other drugs with a wide spectrum against Gram-negative bacteria that can be substituted based on antimicrobial susceptibility testing or clinician preference. See Table 2 for a discussion of how to administer enrofloxacin and for other drug choices. Enrofloxacin should be administered at \u22645 mg/kg/24 h in cats to lessen risk of retinal degeneration. One reviewer noted that IV ciprofloxacin could also be used; however, the other reviewers (94%) believed that enrofloxacin should be used as labeled for veterinary use. e When enrofloxacin or other drugs with Gram-negative activity are administered parenterally to animals with life-threatening disease, concurrent administration of other parenteral drugs with activity against anaerobes and Gram-positive bacteria is recommended. Common choices include ampicillin or clindamycin. Which of these drugs to choose will depend on the most likely infectious agent suspected and historical antimicrobial resistance in the geographical region. For example, Enterococcus spp. and Streptococcus spp. are more likely to be susceptible to a penicillin, and Toxoplasma gondii and Neospora caninum are more likely to be susceptible to clindamycin. Cephalosporins are generally not recommended for the treatment of anaerobic infections because of unpredictable activity and lack of evidence for their efficacy. Please see the text for further discussion of other potential drug choices or combinations. mammalian host species. It also has activity against many opportunistic bacterial pathogens that are components of the normal microbiota of the respiratory tract.",

Due to delayed esophageal transit time for capsules and tablets, cats are prone to drug-induced esophagitis and resultant esophageal strictures. 36, 37 Although any table or capsule could cause this problem, doxycycline hyclate tablets and clindamycin hydrochloride capsules have been reported most frequently to cause problems. [38] [39] [40] Thus, tablets and capsules should be given coated with a lubricating substance, followed by water, administered in a pill treat, concurrently with at least 2 mL of a liquid, or followed by a small amount of food. 37 Doxycycline formulated and approved for use in cats is available in some countries and should be used if available. The use of compounded suspensions of doxycycline should be avoided because marketing of such formulations is in violation with regulations in some countries, including the USA. In addition, compounded aqueous-based formulations of doxycycline are associated with a variable loss of activity beyond 7 days. 41 Minocycline pharmacokinetics are now available for cats and this tetracycline should be evaluated further for efficacy against infectious disease agents in cats. 42 The Working Group considers amoxicillin to be an acceptable alternate first-line option for the treatment of acute bacterial URI when C. felis and Mycoplasma are not highly suspected. This is based on evidence that cats administered amoxicillin for the treatment of suspected secondary bacterial infections in shelter cats with acute bacterial URI often have apparent clinical responses. 20, 43 Cats administered amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium (amoxicillin-clavulanate) had apparent clinical responses in 1 study of shelter cats with acute bacterial URI and so this drug also could be considered as an alternative to doxycycline in regions where a high prevalence of beta-lactamase-producing organisms has been identified (eg, based on regional antibiograms). 44 In 1 study of shelter cats with suspected bacterial URI, the injectable cephalosporin, cefovecin was inferior to doxycycline or amoxicillin-clavulanate. 44 One limitation of this study was the lack of a negative control group. 44 Thus, it is the opinion of the Working Group that more evidence is needed before cefovecin can be recommended for the treatment of bacterial URI in cats (Table 2) .",

For example, multidrug-resistant bacteria can colonize and be grown from the nasal passages in the absence of infection. The purpose of culture and susceptibility testing in cats with chronic bacterial URI is usually to identify the antimicrobial susceptibility of severe secondary bacterial infections that occur secondary to an untreatable underlying cause (eg, idiopathic inflammatory rhinitis). Antimicrobial treatment of these cats might provide relief from severe clinical signs, but it should be recognized that these cats will continue to be predisposed to opportunistic infections, often with antimicrobial-resistant bacteria.

However, some cats with suspected chronic bacterial URI require such an approach to lessen clinical signs of disease even though clinical cure is never achieved.

Evidence from the human infectious disease literature shows organisms cultured from patients within 3 months of primary treatment had a higher likelihood of resistance to the treatment drug or class used. As such, some respiratory treatment guidelines in human medicine recommend a different drug (or drug class) if used within 3 months of the initial treatment. 52 Until further data are available, the Working Group recommends use of the previously effective antimicrobial drug with switch to a different drug class or a more active drug within the class if treatment is ineffective after a minimum of 48 hours.

Because of its significance to the health of other dogs and for prognosis, the possibility of underlying distemper virus infection should always be considered in young dogs with mucopurulent ocular and nasal discharges, even when other signs of distemper are absent. Infection with S. equi subspecies zooepidemicus should be suspected if cases of acute hemorrhagic pneumonia or sudden death are reported. 64 Co-infections with multiple respiratory pathogens are common in dogs with CIRDC and each of the agents can be harbored by dogs with no clinical signs. Vaccines are available for some of the causes of CIRDC in some countries and include canine parainfluenza virus, canine adenovirus 2, canine distemper virus, H3N8 canine influenza virus, H3N2 influenza virus, and B. bronchiseptica.

Aerobic bacterial culture and antimicrobial susceptibility testing, Mycoplasma spp. culture (or PCR assay), and molecular diagnostic procedures for canine parainfluenza virus, canine adenovirus 2, canine distemper virus, canine respiratory coronavirus, canine influenza viruses, canine herpesvirus, pneumovirus, B. bronchiseptica, and Mycoplasma spp. (or M. cynos alone) can be performed. However, each of these organisms can be grown or detected by molecular methods from healthy and diseased dogs and vaccine strains of the organisms can be amplified by molecular diagnostic assays. 65 Molecular assays might also be of limited sensitivity by the time dogs are presented for examination because viral shedding rates tend to peak very early in disease. Thus, these tests are generally not recommended by the Working Group for single cases with typical clinical presentations, no evidence of pneumonia, and when high-risk populations (eg, breeding kennels) are not involved.",

In general, the clinical manifestations, diagnostic plan, and treatment plan are as described in those sections. However, some dogs and cats infected with the primary bacterial pathogens B. bronchiseptica and Mycoplasma spp. can develop chronic bronchitis or bronchopneumonia. 68 In addition, dogs and cats with other inflammatory diseases of the bronchi or anatomic defects of the larynx and trachea (eg, laryngeal paralysis, collapsing airways) might develop secondary bacterial bronchitis. The source of those bacteria is thought to be the natural oral microbiota. Thus, the same bacteria described for secondary bacterial URI in cats and secondary bacterial CIRDC in dogs might be associated with bronchitis.

However, as not all clients can afford the diagnostic procedures and pneumonia can be a lifethreatening disease, the consensus opinion was to provide empirical antimicrobial treatment while waiting for test results with potential for de-escalation of treatment based on antimicrobial susceptibility testing. While hospitalized, parenteral antimicrobial treatment is generally recommended by the Working Group for the treatment of animals with pneumonia, regardless of the severity of disease. Once the animal is discharged, treatment can be continued by means of the oral route. It is the opinion of the Working Group that doxycycline is a reasonable empiric choice for dogs or cats with mild pneumonia that is suspected to be from infection with B. bronchiseptica or Mycoplasma spp. (eg, the animal is from a shelter or boarding environment) and no other systemic signs of disease like fever, dehydration, lethargy, or respiratory distress are present. This is based on the known susceptibility of these organisms to doxycycline (see Section on Canine Infectious Respiratory Disease Complex) and published case reports of successful treatment with doxycycline (Table 2) . 74, 75, 78 Fifteen reviewers (88%) agreed and 2 (12%) disagreed with this Working Group recommendation. One reviewer stated that they doubted that pneumonia would be present without fever and if pneumonia exists, it should be treated with bactericidal drugs. The other dissenting reviewer commented on the lack of breakpoint data for doxycycline and the bacteria from dogs and cats as well as the concern that doxycycline might not penetrate into the extracellular fluids of the lungs.",

Wounds resulting from cat fights and URI are risk factors for pyothorax in cats. 97 Bacteria isolated from dogs with pyothorax are most commonly mixed anaerobes (Prevotella spp., Peptostreptococcus spp., Propionibacterium acnes, Clostridium spp., Bacteroides spp., Fusobacterium spp.) and Enterobacteriaceae, especially E. coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae. 94,98-100 Streptococcus canis, Staphylococcus spp, Enterococcus spp., Corynebacterium spp., Bacillus spp., Trueperella (formerly Arcanobacterium) pyogenes, Pasteurella, Acinetobacter, Capnocytophaga spp., Enterobacter spp., Stenotrophomonas maltophila, Aeromonas hydrophila, Achromobacter xylosoxidans, Serratia marcescens and Pseudomonas spp. Actinomyces spp. and to a lesser extent Nocardia spp. and Streptomyces spp. have been implicated in canine pyothorax. 99 Pyothorax in dogs commonly results from migrating plant foreign bodies or trauma but can also result from bite wound inoculation. 94, [98] [99] [100] [101] [102] [103] ",

Used for life-threatening pneumonia or pyothorax for the treatment of Gram-negative (including some ESBL), Gram-positive and anaerobic bacteria. Ineffective for Mycoplasma, T. gondii, and N. caninum Generally avoided in respiratory tract infections that might involve anaerobic bacteria (particularly pyothorax). Might be less effective that other first-line choices for some primary bacterial pathogens other than Streptococcus spp. Concerns regarding adverse effects exist (KCS, folate deficiency anemia, blood dyscrasias) in some dogs, especially with prolonged treatment. If prolonged (>7 day) treatment is anticipated, baseline Schirmer's tear testing is recommended, with periodic re-evaluation and owner monitoring for ocular discharge. Avoid in dogs that might be sensitive to potential adverse effects such as KCS, hepatopathy, hypersensitivity, and skin eruptions, and owners of treated dogs should be informed of the clinical findings to be monitored.
