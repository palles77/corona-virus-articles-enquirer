ERGIC-53 is a nonglycosylated, type I transmembrane protein that forms homohexamers and consists of an ER-lumenal domain, a transmembrane domain, and a cytoplasmic domain (for review see (Hauri et al., 2000) ). The ERlumenal portion of the protein contains a carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD) that selectively binds high mannose glycans in a Ca 2+ -and pH-dependent manner (Appenzeller-Herzog et al., 2004; Appenzeller et al., 1999; Itin et al., 1996) . Lectin binding can be disrupted by deletion of the entire CRD (\u2206CRD) (residues 44 -269) or specific \u03b2-strands within the CRD (e.g. strands 1 & 2 (\u2206\u03b22) (residues 43-72), 1 through 3 (\u2206\u03b23) (residues 43 -76), or 1 through 4 (\u2206\u03b24) (residues 43-83)) (Zheng et al., 2010) , or through mutation of individual amino acids (N156A or D181A) (Itin et al., 1996; Velloso et al., 2003; Zheng et al., 2010) within the CRD that are critically required for coordinating Ca 2+ -binding. The ER-lumenal region of ERGIC-53 also encodes an alpha helical domain and two cysteine residues (C466 & C475) that are all required for the formation of ERGIC-53 homohexamers. Deletion of the helical domain (\u2206Helix) (residues 271 -457) (Neve et al., 2005) or mutation of the cysteine residues to alanine ",

Deletion of the helical domain combined with mutation of C466 and C475 to alanine (\u2206helix monomer (\u2206HM)) (Zheng et al., 2010) completely abolishes ERGIC-53 oligomerization and yields monomeric ERGIC-53, which, like the DN mutant (KKAA) (Kappeler et al., 1997) , cannot traffic beyond the ER. Additionally, several of these constructs (\u2206CRD, \u2206\u03b21, \u2206\u03b22, \u2206\u03b23, \u2206\u03b24, and \u2206HM) abolish ERGIC-53's ability to interact with MCFD2 (Zheng et al., 2010) .

JUNV C#1, which is an attenuated vaccine strain, was originally derived from WT JUNV strain XJ and differs by 12 amino acids (Chosewood et al., 2009; Goni et al., 2006) . Working stocks of infectious JUNV C#1 and DANV were generated in Vero E6 cells. Infectious titers of these viruses were determined via plaque assay on Vero E6 cells. VSV\u0394G encoding a GFP reporter has been described elsewhere (Takada et al., 1997) and was provided by M. Whitt (The University of Tennessee Health Science Center, Memphis, TN). An infectious stock of VSV\u0394G pseudotyped with VSV G was generated by first transfecting HEK 293T cells with a pCAGGS plasmid encoding VSV G and then 24 hr later inoculating these cells with infectious VSV\u0394G (which had previously been pseudotyped with VSV G) at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 3. Supernatants were collected 24 hr following inoculation and infectious titer was determined by enumerating green foci via focus assay in Vero E6 cells.",

This vector expresses each GP as a fusion protein containing 3 C-terminal elements: a hemaglutinin (HA) epitope tag (YPYDVPDYA) followed by the tobacco etch virus (TEV) cleavage site (ENLYFQG) followed by a 23 amino acid biotin acceptor peptide (BAP) (MASSLRQILDSQKMEWRSNAGGS). When co-transfected with a second plasmid that encodes the bacterial biotin ligase BirA, the BAP can be biotinylated for affinity purification with streptavidin beads. GPs were subcloned into this vector using Gateway Technology (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, each GP was first amplified via PCR using forward and reverse primers containing attB1 and attB2 sequences, respectively. In each case, the stop codon was excluded. PCR products were subcloned into pDONR221 via a BP recombination reaction. GP genes were then subcloned from pDONR221 into the modified pCAGGS vector via an LR recombination reaction. The nucleotide sequence of each GP clone was verified by DNA sequencing. GPs were subcloned from the following viral strains (for each GP, an NCBI Gene Identifier number and a Protein Locus number are listed to provide a link to the actual nucleotide sequence cloned for that particular GP and the corresponding translated amino acid sequence, respectively): ANDV strain CHI-7913 (30313864, AAO86638), SNV NMR11 (999407 (note that there are two silent mutations in our clone: G changed to T and A changed to C at positions 60 and 843, respectively, of referenced sequence), AAC42202), LASV strain Josiah (23343509, NP_694870), LCMV strain Armstrong 53b (61655715, AAX49341), JUNV strain XJ (also referred to as Parodi) (see (Reignier et al., 2006) for description of the nucleotide sequence; the amino acid sequence of the cloned gene matches JVU70799), JUNV strain C#1 (52222815, AAU34180), MACV strain Carvallo (see (Reignier et al., 2006) for description of nucleotide sequence, the amino acid sequence of the cloned gene matches ",

Raw data were searched against the human IPI forward and reverse concatenated databases using SEQUEST software requiring tryptic peptide matches with a 2 Da mass tolerance. Cysteine residues were required to have a static increase in 71.0 Da for acrylamide adduction, and differential modification of 16.0 Da on methionine residues was permitted. Host proteins were considered legitimate GP protein partners if 2 or more unique tryptic peptides were detected from a host protein in samples transfected with a given GP plasmid but not the empty vector or, alternatively, if there was a 5-fold higher quantity of total tryptic peptides detectable from a given human protein in a GP sample compared to the empty vector sample.

Each of these GPs, with the exception of LCMV GP, JUNV XJ GP, MACV GP, SARS CoV S, influenza virus A/WSN/33 HA, EBOV GP, and MARV GP was synthesized by Bio Basic Inc. (Markhamm, ON). The LCMV strain Armstrong GP gene was provided by J. C. de la Torre (The Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla) while the JUNV strain XJ GP and MACV strain Carvallo GP were provided by P.

For the VSV pseudotyping experiments in Figures 3 and S3, we utilized standard pCAGGS vectors encoding VSV G (provided by J. C. de la Torre (Lee et al., 2002)) or EBOV GP (NR-19814, BEI Resources), our modified pCAGGS vector encoding SARS CoV S, and a pSA90 vector encoding JUNV XJ GP provided by P.

For the viral challenges (Figures 2, 3, S2, and S3), GP interaction (Figures 3G-3J), GP trafficking (Figures 4A and 4B), hTfR1 trafficking (Figure S4), and VLP experiments (Figure 4C) we utilized pCDNA3 GM (which encodes WT ERGIC-53 with an N-terminal c-Myc tag) and/or pECE KKAA (which encodes the DN ERGIC-53 with an N-terminal c-Myc tag; the 2 C-terminal phenylalanines of this ERGIC-53 gene have been replaced with alanines) plasmids that were provided by H.

At each time point examined in the various assays, supernatants and cells were collected (from each replicate well) to measure infectious virus or protein expression levels, respectively. Supernatants were clarified via centrifugation at 2000 RPM for 5 minutes and then screened for infectious virus via plaque assay (JUNV C#1 and DANV) or focus forming assay (pseudotyped VSV\u2206G). To generate protein lysates, cells were scraped into PBS, combined with any cells that pelleted while clarifying the supernatants, pelleted by centrifugation at 2000 RPM, and then lysed on ice in 25 mM Tris-HCL, pH 7.6 containing 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% Nonidet P-40 IGEPAL CA-630, 140 mM NaCl, and a Complete Mini EDTA-Free Protease Inhibitor Cocktail tablet. Lysates were clarified of insoluble material by centrifugation at 10,000 rpm at 4\u00b0C and run on Novex 4-20% Tris-Glycine polyacrylamide gels for Western blot analysis. For selected challenge assays described below, we utilized the unpaired Student's t test to determine whether statistically significant differences existed between the quantities of infectious virus released from control versus experimental groups as indicated in the Figure legends. For the siRNA challenge experiments shown in Figures 2A and S2A, HEK 293T cells were plated in 6-well plates, reverse transfected with 25 nM of either an ERGIC-53-specific siRNA (5'-GGACAGAAUCGUAUUCAUCdTdT-3' as sense and 5'-AUGAAUACGAUUCUGUCCdTdT-3' as antisense) (Nyfeler et al., 2006) or a scrambled, negative control siRNA (Allstars Negative Control siRNA, 1027280, Qiagen, Valencia, CA) using HiPerFect Transfection Reagent (301705, Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions.

Supernatants and cell protein lysates were collected at 24, 48, and 72 hr post-inoculation (96, 120, and 144 hr post-transfection with siRNA, respectively) and screened for JUNV C#1 plaque forming units (PFU) via plaque assay or ERGIC-53 and CRT (loading control) expression via Western blot. Prior to carrying out the viral challenge, we determined, using the ERGIC-53-specific siRNA, the timeframe post-transfection that would yield optimal ERGIC-53 knock-down. Using Western blot as a read out, we observed silencing of ERGIC-53 in HEK 293T cells from 48 to 144 hr post-transfection (data not shown). For the overexpression challenge experiments shown in Figures 2B and S2B, HEK 293T cells were plated in 6-well plates, transfected the next day with a plasmid encoding Myc-tagged, WT ERGIC-53 or an empty vector, and challenged 1 day later with JUNV C#1 at an MOI of 0.1. Supernatants and cell protein lysates were collected at 24, 48, and 72 hr post-inoculation and screened for JUNV C#1 PFU via plaque assay or Myc-WT ERGIC-53 and CRT (loading control) expression via Western blot.

Supernatants and cell protein lysates were collected at 48 and 72 hr post-inoculation for JUNV C#1 or 48 hr post-inoculation for DANV and screened for PFU via plaque assay or Myc-DN ERGIC-53 and CRT (loading control) JUNV C#1 at an MOI of 1. Supernatants and cell protein lysates were collected 72 hr post-inoculation and screened for PFU via plaque assay or ERGIC-53 and actin (loading control) expression via Western blot.

After 3 washes in PBS with 0.1% BSA, cells were incubated with a 1:800 dilution of both the Alexa Fluor 488conjugated Goat Anti-Mouse IgG (H+L) (A-11029, Invitrogen) and Alexa Fluor 647-conjugated Goat Anti-Rabbit IgG (H+L) (A-21245, Invitrogen) antibodies. For the live-cell surface staining, cells were incubated with a 1:50 dilution of the GB03-BE08 mouse anti-JUNV GP1/GPC antibody and a 1:50 dilution of the sc-66880 rabbit anti-ERGIC-53 antibody in PBS with 3% FBS and 10% normal goat serum for 20 minutes at 4 o C. After 3 washes in PBS with 3% FBS, cells were incubated with a 1:200 dilution of both the Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated Goat Anti-Mouse IgG (H+L) and Alexa Fluor 647-conjugated Goat Anti-Rabbit IgG (H+L) antibodies, washed 3 times with PBS, and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde. In both staining protocols, cells were stained with DAPI, washed 3 times with PBS, and then mounted onto glass slides using ProLong Gold Antifade Reagent. As a control, cells were surface stained for JUNV C#1 GP and CRT using a 1:50 dilution of the SPA-600 rabbit anti-CRT antibody (Figure 5C). The protocol was the same with the exception of replacing the ERGIC-53-specific antibody with the CRTspecific antibody. The surface staining of JUNV C#1 GP and intracellular staining of either Myc-tagged WT or DN ERGIC-53 shown in Figure 4A was accomplished by seeding HEK 293T cells in T-75 flasks, transfecting them with plasmids encoding either Myc-tagged WT or DN ERGIC-53, then 1 day later inoculating them with JUNV C#1 at an MOI of 0.1. Cells were trypsinized 2 days later (at 48 hr post-inoculation) and reseeded onto 22 mm glass cover slips within 6-well dishes. At 72 hr post-inoculation cells were washed in PBS and then surface stained for JUNV GP1/GPC via incubation with a 1:50 dilution of the GB03-BE08 mouse anti-JUNV GP1/GPC antibody directly conjugated to Alexa Fluor 488 in PBS containing 3% FBS for 20 minutes at 4 o C. Cells were then washed 3 times in PBS and fixed using Z-FIX. Following fixation, cells were washed 2 times with PBS, permeabilized via incubation with PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and 1% BSA for 10 minutes, washed 3 times with PBS containing 0.1% BSA, blocked for 30 minutes at room temperature with PBS containing 1% BSA and 10% normal goat serum, then stained for Myc-tagged WT or DN ERGIC-53 via overnight incubation at 4 o C with a 1:200 dilution of the 71D10 rabbit anti-Myc antibody in PBS containing 0.1% BSA. Cells were washed 3 times in PBS containing 0.1% BSA, then incubated with a 1:800 dilution of the Alexa Fluor 647-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody in PBS containing 0.1% BSA for 2 hr, washed 3 times in PBS, stained with DAPI, washed 3 times in PBS, then mounted on glass slides using ProLong Gold Antifade Reagent. Detection of ERGIC-53 in JUNV C#1 particles shown in Figure S5 was accomplished by incubating clarified media from either mock-or JUNV C#1-infected cells for 2 hr at 37\u00b0C in 35 mm glass bottom culture dishes (P356-1.5-10-C, MatTek Corporation, Ashland, MA) that had been coated with 0.01% Poly-L-Lysine (3438-100-01, Trevigen, Gaithersburg, MD). The JUNV C#1-containing media had a titer of ~1 x 10 7 PFU/ml. Viral particles were subsequently fixed by incubation in 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 minutes at room temperature, washed three times with 1X PBS, permeabilized in PBS containing 1% BSA and 0.1% Triton X-100 for 10 minutes at room temperature, and then blocked in PBS containing 1% BSA and 10% normal goat serum for 30 minutes at room temperature. Staining for JUNV NP and ERGIC-53 was done via incubation with a 1:200 dilution of the mouse anti-JUNV NP antibody NA05-AG12 (NR-2582, BEI Resources) and a 1:100 dilution of a rabbit anti-ERGIC-53 antibody (raised by B.Z.) in PBS containing 1% BSA for 2 hours at room temperature. Following 3 washes in PBS with 0.1% BSA, the dishes were incubated with a 1:200 dilution of both the Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated Goat Anti-Mouse IgG (H+L) and Alexa Fluor 647-conjugated Goat Anti-Rabbit IgG (H+L) antibodies. The stained dishes were then washed 3 times in PBS and stored at 4\u00b0C prior to imaging in PBS.",

At 72 hr post-inoculation the media was aspirated and cells detached from the plates by incubating them with Versene (2 mM EDTA in PBS) for 15 minutes at 37 o C. Cell pellets were washed 2 times with PBS and then surface stained for JUNV GP1/GPC via incubation with a 1:100 dilution of the GB03-BE08 mouse anti-JUNV GP1/GPC antibody directly conjugated to Alexa Fluor 488 in FACS buffer (PBS containing 2% fetal bovine serum and 0.2% sodium azide) for 20 minutes at 4 o C. Cells were then washed 3 times in FACS buffer, fixed/permeabilized in BD Cytofix/Cytoperm solution (554722, BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) for 20 minutes at room temperature, washed 2 times in BD Perm/Wash buffer (554723, BD Biosciences), then stained for Myc-tagged WT or DN ERGIC-53 via a 20 minute incubation at 4 o C with a mouse anti-Myc antibody directly conjugated to Alexa Fluor 647 (2233, Cell Signaling) diluted 1:100 in Perm/Wash buffer.
