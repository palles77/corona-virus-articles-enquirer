These diseases are diagnosed on symptomatology, and treatments are mainly symptomatic, yet our understanding of the mechanisms that generate the familiar symptoms is poor compared with the amount of knowledge available on the molecular biology of the viruses involved. New knowledge of the effects of cytokines in human beings now helps to explain some of the symptoms of colds and flu that were previously in the realm of folklore rather than medicineeg, fever, anorexia, malaise, chilliness, headache, and muscle aches and pains. The mechanisms of symptoms of sore throat, rhinorrhoea, sneezing, nasal congestion, cough, watery eyes, and sinus pain are discussed, since these mechanisms are not dealt with in any detail in standard medical textbooks.",

            "text": "Acute upper respiratory tract viral infections (URTIs) are the most common diseases of human beings, with adults having two to five common colds each year and school children having from seven to ten colds per year. 1 The symptoms of URTIs are so common that selfdiagnosis of common cold or influenza (flu) is normal among the general public and clinical diagnosis is usually the only diagnosis used by the physician. Over 200 serologically different viral types are responsible for human URTIs, with the rhinoviruses being the most common cause. 1 There is a large amount of information available about the molecular biology of the viruses associated with URTIs but relatively little information on the origins of the symptoms associated with them. An understanding of the pathophysiology of symptoms of URTIs is important, as most treatments for URTIs are symptomatic and clinical trials on the efficacy of new treatments usually focus on changes in symptom scores as the main parameter of efficacy rather than changes in viral titres in the airway or viral shedding. Clinical trials on any new antiviral treatment for URTIs aimed at the general population will need to demonstrate changes in symptom severity or duration of symptoms, since these parameters are the key benefits for most patients. Differences in clinical presentation are not so useful in identifying the causative agent of an URTI but there has been increasing interest in improving the accuracy of symptomatic diagnosis of emerging viral infections such as pandemic influenza 2 and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) 3 because early diagnosis is essential for any antiviral therapy and for the initiation of publichealth measures in the community (eg, isolation of infected cases). Here, I discuss the mechanisms that generate symptoms associated with URTIs, especially common cold and flu, but will not review virology in any detail except as regards relevance to symptoms.",

The best predictors for influenza are cough and fever, since this combination of symptoms has been shown to have a positive predictive value of around 80% in differentiating influenza from a population suffering from flu-like symptoms. 2",

The sneeze response may be mediated via histamine receptors on the trigeminal nerves, since intranasal administration of histamine causes sneezing. 23 The trigeminal nerves relay information to the sneeze centre in the brainstem and cause reflex activation of motor and parasympathetic branches of the facial nerve and activate respiratory muscles. A model of the sneeze reflex is illustrated in figure 1 . The sneeze centre coordinates the inspiratory and expiratory actions of sneezing via respiratory muscles, and lacrimation and nasal congestion via parasympathetic branches of the facial nerve. The eyes are always closed during sneezing by activation of facial muscles, indicating a close relation between the protective reflexes of the nose and eyes. A common phenomenon is the \"photic sneeze\", caused by a sudden increase in light intensity, again highlighting the overlap of protective nasal and eye reflexes. 24 Sneezing activates parasympathetic pathways to nasal glands and there appears to be some cholinergic control of sneezing, since anticholinergics such as ipratropium and first generation antihistamines have been shown to inhibit sneezing. 25, 26 ",

These studies have demonstrated that nasal secretions in the first 4 days of a common cold are inhibited by intranasal administration of ipratropium. 25 The nasal discharge also consists of a protein-rich plasma exudate derived from subepithelial capillaries, 28 which may explain why anticholinergics only partly inhibit nasal discharge associated with URTIs. 27 The colour of nasal discharge and sputum is often used as a clinical marker to determine whether or not to prescribe antibiotics but there is no evidence from the literature that supports this concept, 29 since colour changes in nasal discharge or sputum reflect the severity of the inflammatory response 30 rather than the nature of the infection. Much of the literature relates to colour changes in sputum and the lower airways but the same concepts apply to the upper airways and nasal discharge. The colour of nasal discharge may change from clear to yellow to green during the course of an URTI. This colour change is related to the recruitment of leucocytes into the airway lumen and is a hallmark of airway disease. 30 Neutrophils and proinflammatroy monocytes have azurophil granules that are green because of the green protein myeloperoxidase. Nasal discharge with few leucocytes is white or clear, with increasing numbers of leucocytes the nasal discharge appears yellow (pale green), and with large numbers of leucocytes the colour becomes green. 30",

Nasal stimulation and inflammation causes sneezing and not cough, indicating that the airway inflammation associated with rhinitis must reach the level of the larynx to trigger cough. The vagus nerve also supplies the external ear, oesophagus, and abdominal organs and cough can be elicited from these areas as with cough associated with gastroesophageal reflux. 44 Cough is normally a protective reflex that prevents the aspiration of food and fluid into the airway and also aids in the expulsion of mucus and foreign objects from the lower airway. The first days of an URTI are often associated with a dry, unproductive cough that serves no useful function and may cause loss of sleep and exhaustion. The unproductive cough may be caused by the inflammatory response in the upper airways spreading to the larynx. Cough associated with URTIs is believed to be caused by a hyper-reactivity of the cough reflex that may be due to the effects of inflammatory mediators on airway sensory nerve endings. 46, 47 In health, cough is readily induced by mechanical stimulation of the larynx, but when the larynx is inflamed and hyper-reactive, cough may occur spontaneously or in response to stimuli that would not normally cause cough-eg, the mildly irritating effects of cold air. Cough occurs spontaneously with an URTI, and some cough may be voluntary rather than reflex; this voluntary cough may be related to a sensation of airway irritation. 48 Productive cough usually occurs later in the course of URTI and may be related to the inflammation spreading to the lower airways and triggering mucus production. Common cold viruses usually do not cause any substantial damage to the airway epithelium, 11 whereas influenza may cause substantial cellular damage to the respiratory epithelium; this difference may be why influenza infection is usually associated with cough 2 whereas common cold often occurs as a \"head cold\" with little, if any, symptom of cough.",

Common cold in the adult is rarely accompanied by fever and some subjects have a transient fall in body temperature during the early stages of common cold. In a study of 272 patients with sore throat associated with URTIs, the mean aural temperature was 36\u00b78\u00baC and around 35% of these patients said they were suffering from \"chills\" and \"feverish discomfort\". 49 The sensation of chilliness may be unrelated to any change in skin or body temperature. In a study of human volunteers, a sensation of chill still develops on administration of exogenous pyrogen even though the volunteers are immersed in a water bath that maintains a neutral skin temperature (34\u00b75\u00baC). 53 The sensation of chilliness occurred after visible signs of shivering in the volunteers. Chilliness and shivering occurred even though there was no change in skin temperature and body temperature was actually rising in response to skin vasoconstriction. This finding indicates that the sensation of chilliness may be a central sensation closely linked to control of shivering. Chilliness and shivering are most likely induced by the effects of cytokines on the temperature regulating centres of the hypothalamus and perceived at the level of the cerebral cortex. Fever in response to infection is found in a wide range of animals and is believed to be beneficial as regards the host response to infection. 54 Fever is usually associated with novel or severe viral infections, especially emerging viral infections where the virus is novel to the host, as in influenza epidemics and SARS. 2, 3 As discussed, fever is uncommon in adult cases of common cold, but is common in infant cases, presumably because the adult has been exposed to numerous common cold viruses and subsequent infections do not trigger a strong immune response, whereas the viruses are novel to the infant.",
