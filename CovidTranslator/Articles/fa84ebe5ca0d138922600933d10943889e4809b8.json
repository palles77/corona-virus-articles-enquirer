When studied in a systematic and prospective fashion, the only consistent risk factors appear to be birth weight and prematurity (6) . The association between NEC and prematurity suggests that the structural integrity of the immature gastrointestinal tract may play an important role in the pathogenesis of the disease. This hypothesis is supported by the observation of Bauer et al (7) (in the Collaborative Study on Antenatal Steroid Therapy) of a decreased incidence of NEC in premature infants receiving antenatal maternal steroids. Costicosteroids are known to accelerate the maturation of fetal tissues and stabilize epithelial and endothelial barriers (8) , and they may augment the structural integrity of the gut.",

On gross inspection, the affected bowel segments appear distended, hemorrhagic, and poorly perfused. Involvement can be focal or diffuse. The histologic appearance of the lesions is dependent on the stage and severity of disease at the time of examination. Early lesions are characterized by superficial mucosal ulcerations and hemorrhage, with microthrombi in submucosal vessels (16) . An inflammatory cell response is not a prominent feature of early lesions. With more advanced disease, mucosal ulcerations deepen and become covered with pseudomembranes consisting of fibrin, necrotic epithelium, and inflammatory cells. Scattered areas of transmural necrosis can be appreciated and pneumatosis is commonly noted in the submucosal area.

The theory of primary mucosal damage followed by secondary bacterial invasion is generally regarded as an oversimplification of a complex sequence of events that results in the clinical and pathological manifestations of NEC. Mucosal injury appears to be a prerequisite for the development of NEC, but the mechanisms by which the injury can be sustained are numerous and poorly understood. Intraluminal factors, such as formula feedings, structural immaturity of the bowel wall, and direct colonization and invasion by enteropathogenic bacteria, as well as extraluminal (vascular) factors, such as ischemia, thrombosis, and hyperviscosity have been implicated in the genesis of mucosal injury.

In !972, Touloukian et al developed an animal model for ischemic gastroenteritis in asphyxiated neonatal piglets (17) . During periods of asphyxia, redistribution of cardiac output occurred, with diminished perfusion to the intestinal mucosa, particularly in the distal ileum and proximal colon. Although a rebound in perfusion occurred with resuscitation, blood flow remained diminished in the ileocecal area--the area most frequently affected in NEC. Histologic findings in the affected intestine included mucosal edema and hemorrhage, consistent with histologic changes in the early stages of human NEC.",

Lloyd (18) has suggested that the selective redistribution of cardiac output and diminished intestinal mucosal perfusion plays a major role in the pathogenesis of gastrointestinal perforations in neonates.

The mechanism whereby excessive feeding may initiate events leading t O NEC remains speculative. Excessive intake has been associated with intestinal distension and altered peristalsis (46) , which may result bacterial overgrowth favoring the development of NEC. Feeding results in increased blood flow and tissue 02 extraction in healthy neonatal piglets (47) . It is possible that in sick infants unable to increase blood flow to the gut because of no cardiac reserve, feeding results in a relative ischemia in which increased tissue demands for oxygen are not met. In addition, the absorptive capacity of the preterm intestine may be surpassed in the presence of excessive substrate, allowing for the passage of undigested nutrients to colonic bacteria for fermentation. Fermentation of undigested carbohydrates by colonic bacteria results in the production of hydrogen gas, a major component of pneumatosis intestinalis (48) , a diagnostic hallmark of NEC. Despite these findings, prospective StUdie s (49) have failed to document a causative effect of enteral feedings, it has been common practice in the majority of neonatal intensive care units to delay initiation of enteral feedings in preterm asphyxiated infants. The rationale for delayed feeding is to allow sufficient time for healing of intestinal mucosa subjected to hypoxic-ischemic stress. However, a recent prospective study by LaGamma et al (50) failed to demonstrate a protective effect of delayed feedings. Instead, there was an increased incidence of NEC in infants in whom enteral feeding was withheld for two weeks. There is evidence that enteral feedings may participate in the stimulation of postnatal gastrointestinal maturation through the re-lease of trophic hormones (51) and that prolonged periods without enteral feeding may cause mucosal atrophy. Therefore, delayed feedings may place the preterm infant at increased risk for NEC.",

Mean TxB2 was established for healthy term and preterm infants, stressed neonates without NEC, and infants with NEC. TxB2 was significantly elevated in neonates with NEC when compared to all other groups studied. Stressed neonates without NEC had TxB2 intermediate between healthy neonates and infants with NEC. Serial urine samples were obtained for measurement of TxB2 from a group of preterm infants considered at high risk for the development of NEC, In the four infants who subsequently developed NEC, TxB2 became elevated after the onset of gastrointestinal symptoms, and values paralleled the course of illness, recovery, and recurrence, Although TXBE did not allow for earlier identification of infants who develop NEC, the results suggested that elevated TxB2 correlated with the severity of gastrointestinal inflammation in neonates. Beta-thromboglobulin, another product of platelet activation, was increased in the urine of infants with NEC. In addition, there was an inverse correlation between TxB2 and platelet counts. These findings were consistent with the concept that platelet consumption was the source of enhanced thromboxane excretion. These preliminary results lend support to the possibility that platelet thrombosis and release of vasoconstrictor thromboxanes play an important role in the potentiation of the ischemic injury in neonates who subsequently develop NEC (Figure 1) .",

Ischemic necrosis of the bowel was induced in adult rats by infusing synthetic platelet activating factor (PAF) with or without endotoxin directly into the abdominal aorta (53) (54) (55) . The histology of the injury was similar to that in adults with ischemic bowel disease, but thromboemboli were not found. An inhibitor of leukoriene synthesis, a leukotriene receptor antagonist, and verapamil, a calcium-channel blocker, all inhibited the ischemic injury induced by PAF (54 collected from the experimental animals was tested in a bioassay cascade (55) . Following PAF, leukotriene C4 was released in large amounts. Direct infusion of leukotriene C4 into rat aorta resulted in bowel necrosis, suggesting an important role for the vasoconstrictor leukotriene C4 in bowel ischemia following treatment with PAF. Prostaglandins, predominantly PGE1, were also detected in the venous effluent of PAF-stimulated perfused intestines. PGEI is a vasodilator whose potential role in the pathogenesis of ischemic bowel necrosis remains undefined. Continuous systemic infusion of PGE1 resulted in improved intestinal perfusion and prevented bowel necrosis in PAFtreated rat intestines. Pretreatment of the same animals with indomethacin, a cyclooxygenase inhibitor, resulted in increased vascular resistance in mesenteric vessels and acceleration of the development of ischemic changes. It is likely that pretreatment with indomethacin resulted in a decreased production of vasodilating PGE1 and in an increase in the relative concentration of leukotrienes via preferential metabolism of arachidonic acid through the lipooxygenase pathway.",

A great deal of further investigation will be required before the roles of the eicosanoids in NEC can be clarified. The long-term goals of such research will be to discover specific interventions that might prove useful for the prevention or treatment of NEC in human infants.",
