Engineering simulation, which employs computational fluid dynamics, provides a convenient means of investigating airflow behaviour in isolation rooms for various ventilation arrangements. A cough model was constructed to permit the numerical simulation of virus diffusion inside an isolation room for different ventilation system configurations. An analysis of the region of droplet fallout and the dilution time of virus diffusion of coughed gas in the isolation room was also performed for each ventilation arrangement. The numerical results presented in this paper indicate that the paralleldirectional airflow pattern is the most effective means of controlling flows containing virus droplets. Additionally, staggering the positions of the supply vents at the door end of the room relative to the exhaust vents on the wall behind the bed head provides effective infection control and containment. These results suggest that this particular ventilation arrangement enhances the safety of staff when performing medical treatments within isolation rooms.",

            "text": "Fundamental guidelines for infection control in hospital environments were posted on the World Health Organization's (WHO) website on 24 April 2003 during the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak which was ongoing at that time. These guidelines advised that all individuals showing potential SARS-related symptoms should be promptly quarantined in an isolation room. According to SARS statistics published later in 2003 by the WHO, 1 this action was instrumental in minimizing the spread of the disease within hospitals caring for SARS victims. For effective infection control, it is essential to maintain a negative pressure between the isolation room and the outside environment. However, a review of the international standards [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] shows that the specified minimum pressure differentials between the isolated field and the non-isolated field vary considerably, i.e. from 2.5 Pa to 30 Pa, and are not even specified in some cases. The tracer containment testing of isolation rooms performed by Rydock and Eian 8 showed that even when the isolation room was established at a high pressure differential of 15 Pa and a high ventilation rate of 15-21 air changes/ h was maintained, leaked gases from the isolation room could still be detected in the anteroom for up to 3 min following the opening of the interconnecting door.",

In model VC-03, the two air-supply vents on the ceiling are positioned away from the corners of the room, towards the middle of the wall running parallel to the bed. Meanwhile, the two exhaust vents are located in the wall behind the patient and in the wall opposite the patient, and are positioned in the corners furthest away from the air-supply vents.

Furthermore, the results of model VC-05 show that positioning the air-supply and exhaust vents in diametrically opposite corners changes both the direction and location of the region of droplet fallout and virus diffusion of coughed gas. Therefore, this section of the paper investigates the effect on the parallel-directional airflow pattern of staggering the positions of the air-supply and exhaust vents (models VC-06 and VC-07). Comparing the two models, the exhaust vents in the vertical direction are identical and the air-supply vents are located at different positions (Figures 7  and 8) .",

Hence, as shown in Figure 7 (a), airflow circulations are established near the foot of the bed. Meanwhile, Figure 7 (b) shows the presence of a major horizontal circulation in the region of the room In model VC-07, the positions of the inlet and exhaust vents are partially overlapped and partially staggered (as opposed to completely staggered, as in the example presented above). In this arrangement, the air inlets are located in the middle of the end wall opposite the patient, and the exhaust vents located in the facing wall are offset towards the corner of the room. Figure 8(a) shows that circulations are located behind the patient. Additionally, the velocity magnitude distribution is more uniform. As shown in Figure 8 (b), in contrast to the previous case, less horizontal circulation is generated in the region of the room bounded by the upper and lower vents. Consequently, less coughed gas is diffused towards the door end of the room. Figure 8 (c) shows that the coughed gas with infectious droplets is contained near the patient and around the exhaust vents. Significantly, model VC-07 demonstrates the smallest region of droplet fallout and virus diffusion of coughed gas. Therefore, this particular ventilation arrangement provides good results for infection control, and enhances staff safety when performing medical treatments inside the isolation room.",

However, as shown by the simulation results presented in the sections above, different airflow patterns lead to different airflow behaviours inside the room, and hence have different containment effects. Therefore, the airflow patterns are an important and significant parameter when designing ventilation systems to enhance the efficiency of infection control within isolation rooms.",

For this reason, the case of a patient with frequent coughing must be considered for the practical operation of an isolation system. A few simulations have been performed in order to consider the effect of frequent coughing on the design of ventilation configuration. Simulated results showed that the droplet fallout region is not broadened in the case of frequent coughing, and dispersion of infective droplets is not significantly influenced by the gravity effect in the isolation room when air flow within the room is in the steady state. However, for a patient with frequent coughing, the concentration of coughed gas will increase inside the isolation room.

The present study has used an engineering computational technique to develop an understanding of containment in an isolation room when the door is kept closed, such that virus diffusion is influenced by ventilation airflow patterns alone. The current simulation results yield a number of significant findings and recommendations for the operation of isolation rooms. The diluting efficiency depends on the airchanging rate, and is nearly independent of the airflow patterns. However, the airflow pattern is a significant parameter influencing the region of droplet fallout and virus diffusion within the isolation room when the door is kept closed. The present results have shown that positioning the airsupply inlets in the ceiling and the exhaust vents at floor level results in an up-draft effect and poor infection control efficiency. The parallel-directional airflow pattern results in a uniform flow path with a stable direction of flow. This arrangement achieves the best containment efficiency of the various ventilation systems considered in the present study.",
