            "text": "In late December 2019, a case of unidentified pneumonia was reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, People's Republic of China (PRC). Its clinical characteristics are very similar to those of viral pneumonia. After analysis on respiratory samples, PRC Centers for Disease Control (CDC) experts declared that the pneumonia, later known as novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP), was caused by novel coronavirus [1] . WHO infectivity, despite of low mortality rate [2] . Genome analysis of novel coronavirus sequences revealed that the complete genome sequence recognition rates of SARS-CoV and bat SARS coronavirus (SARSr-CoV-RaTG13) were 79.5% and 96% respectively [3] . It implies that the coronavirus might originate from bat. On 29 February 2020, data published by World Health Organization showed that, since 12 December 2019 when the first case was reported, 79,394 cases were confirmed to be infected by novel coronavirus and 2,838 individuals were died in total [4] . In the meantime, 6009 cases were confirmed and 86 were died in 53 countries and regions outside of China ( Figure 1 ) [4] . It posed a great threat to global public health. This report reviews the genetic structure, infection source, transmission route, pathogenesis, clinical characteristics, and treatment and prevention of the SARS-CoV-2, so that it can provide references for follow-up research, prevention and treatment, and may help readers to have the latest understanding of this new infectious disease.",

            "text": "Coronavirus (COV) is a single strand RNA virus with a diameter of 80-120nm. It is divided into four types: \u03b1-coronavirus (\u03b1-COV), \u03b2-coronavirus (\u03b2-COV), \u03b4-coronavirus (\u03b4-COV) and \u03b3coronavirus (\u03b3-COV) [5] . Six coronaviruses were previously known to cause disease in humans, SARS-CoV-2 is the seventh member of the coronavirus family that infects human beings after SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV [6] . SARS-CoV-2, like SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, belongs to \u03b2-coronavirus. The genome sequence homology of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS is about 79%, the 2019-nCoV is closer to the SARS-like bat CoVs (MG772933) than the SARS-CoV [7] , which is descended from SARS-like bat CoVs. Interestingly, for high similarity of receptor-binding domain (RBD) in Spike-protein, several analyses reveal that SARS-CoV-2 uses angiotension-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as receptor, just like as SARS-CoV [8] . Coronavirus mainly recognizes the corresponding receptor on the target cell through the S protein on its surface and enters into the cell, then causing the occurrence of infection. A structure model analysis shows that SARS-CoV-2 binds ACE2 with above 10 folds higher affinity than SARS-CoV, but higher than the threshold required for virus infection [9] . The detailed mechanism about whether the SARS-CoV-2 would infect humans via binding of S-protein to ACE2, how strong the interaction is for risk of human transmission, and how SARS-CoV-2 causes pathological mechanisms of organs damage remains unknown, which need more studies to elaborate. These results further explains the more rapid transmission capability of the SARS-CoV-2 in humans than SARS-CoV, and the number of confirmed COVID-19 much higher than people with SARS-CoV infection. Considering the higher affinity of SARS-CoV-2 binds ACE2, soluble ACE2 might be a potential candidate for COVID-19 treatment.",

            "text": "Basic Reproduction Number (R 0 ) refers to the average amount of secondary infection that patients may produce in completely susceptible population without intervention[10]. The estimation of R 0 varies among different research teams and is updated as more information is exposed. Wu, JT, Leung et al. of York University estimated the R 0 of novel coronavirus to be 2.47-2.86 [11] using the SEIR model. Majumder of Boston Children's Hospital and his colleagues adjusted R 0 to be 2.0-3.3 using the IDEA model [12] . The R 0 value of other viruses of \u03b2 -coronavirus, such as SARS-CoV, is estimated to be 2.2-3.6 [13] . The R 0 value of MERS-CoV is estimated to be 2.0-6.7 [14] . These indicate that SARS-CoV-2 has relatively high transmissibility. Population is generally susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, the median age was 47.0 years (IQR, 35.0 to 58.0), 87% case patients were 30 to 79 years of age, and 3% were age 80 years or older, and the number of female patients was 41.9%. [15, 16] . Most cases were diagnosed in Hubei Province, China (75%). 81% cases were classified as mild, 14% cases were severe, and 5% were critical. The overall case-fatality rate (CFR) was 2.3%, but cases in those aged 70 to 79 years had an 8.0% CFR and cases in those aged 80 years and older had a 14.8% CFR [16] . This implies that elderly male citizens are more susceptible to this coronavirus as compared with other groups, and this virus is more likely to affect elderly male citizens with chronic underlying diseases (diabetes, hypertension, heart disease, etc.) [17] .",

However, later studies [20] found that no evidence showed that snakes are the hosts of SARS-CoV-2. Study from wuhan institute of virology showed that the similarity of gene sequence between SARS-CoV-2 and bat coronavirus is as high as 96.2% by sequencing technology [21] This also implied that bats are the possible source of SARS-CoV-2. Apart from those, Xu. et al. [22] showed that the similarity of SARS-CoV-2 isolated from pangolin and the virus strains currently infecting humans is as high as 99% using macrogenomic sequencing, molecular biological detection and electron microscopic analysis. The team also observed the typical novel coronavirus granules and revealed that pangolin is the potential intermediate host of the SARS-CoV-2.",

Zhong. et al. found that, based on clinical features of 1,099 COVID-19 patients, the median incubation period was 3.0 days (range, 0 to 24.0), the median time from the first symptom to death was 14 days [15, 27] . For SARS, the median latency of SARS is 4 days, the average duration of first symptoms to hospital admission was 3.8 days, and admission to death was 17.4 days for casualties [28] , and the median latency of MERS is 7 days [29] . From the median incubation period, COVID-19 is shorter than SARS and MERS. However, the maximum latency of SARS-CoV-2 currently observed is as high as 24 days, which may increase the risk of virus transmission. Moreover, it also found that people 70 years or older had shorter median days (11.5 days) from the first symptom to death than those with ages below 70 years (20 days), demonstrating that elderly people have faster disease progression than younger people [27] . From the above, the public should pay more attention to elderly people who might be more vulnerable to the SARS-CoV-2.",

Although the clinical verification has not been carried out yet, this technology, once proved, might be conducive to rapid diagnosis of the disease [43] .

In a retrospective analysis, convalescent plasma therapy is more effective than severe doses of hormonal shock in patients with severe SARS, reducing mortality and shortening hospital stays [60] . A prospective cohort study by Hung and colleagues showed that for patients with pandemic H1N1 influenza virus infection in 2009, the relative risk of death was significantly lower in patients treated with convalescent plasma [61] . Moreover, from the perspective of immunology, most of the patients recovered from COVID-19 would produce specific antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2, and their serum could be used to prevent reinfection. At the same time, antibodies can limit the virus reproduction in the acute phase of infection and help clear the virus, which is conducive to the rapid recovery of the disease [62] . Theoretically, viremia peaks during the first week of most viral infections, and it should be more effective to give recovery plasma early in the disease [63] . Therefore, the plasma of some patients recovered from COVID-19 could be collected to prepare plasma globulin specific to SARS-CoV-2. However, the safety of plasma globulin products specific to SARS-CoV-2 deserves further consideration.",

The present principles on prevention of COVID-19 are to tonify body energy to protect outside body, dispel wind, dissipate heat, and dissipate dampness with aromatic agent. The six most commonly used Chinese herbal medicines are astragalus, liquorice, fangfeng, baizhu and honeysuckle. However, the decoction is not suitable for long-term use, and the best period is one week only [68] . Studies have shown that vitamin C may prevent the susceptibility of lower respiratory tract infection under certain conditions [69] , while COVID-19 may cause lower respiratory tract infection. Therefore, a moderate amount of vitamin C supplementation may be a way to prevent COVID-19. In addition, the decrease in vitamin D and vitamin E levels in cattle could lead to the infection of bovine coronavirus [70] . This suggests that proper supplementation of vitamin D and vitamin E may enhance our resistance to SARS-CoV-2. Patients with primary basic diseases, especially those with chronic diseases such as hypertension, diabetes, coronary heart disease and tumor, are more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 and their risk of poor prognosis will increase significantly after infection, because they have low systemic immunity as a result of the disease itself and treatments [71] . Therefore, it is particularly important to enhance self-resistance. The main way to boost personal immunity is to maintain personal hygiene, a healthy lifestyle and adequate nutritional intake [72, 73] . For individuals, taking protective measures can effectively prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection, including improving personal hygiene, wearing medical masks, adequate rest and good ventilation [15] .",
