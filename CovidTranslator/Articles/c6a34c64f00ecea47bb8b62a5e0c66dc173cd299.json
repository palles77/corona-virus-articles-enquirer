Concerns about a newly mutated strain of avian influenza virus, with the capacity to become a pandemic organism with high morbidity and mortality, has spurred pandemic influenza plans at all levels of the public and private sectors across the globe. The World Health Organization is playing a central role in coordinating the development of plans and in urging member states to coordinate pandemic planning. Attendant to this rush to create pandemic plans is intense public scrutiny, including anxiety and fear. Media attention has been intense and has increased public worries about the avail-ability of antiviral medications with individuals rushing to secure their own stock of antiviral medication. Nation states are taking actions to protect themselves and secure their borders from the incursion of avian influenza transmitted through bird species.",

However, when one takes the \"dem\" out of pandemic (which represents the Greek word of \"demos\" or \"people\"), it becomes important that we try to re-insert some of the better aspects of human nature such as reason and reflection in our preparation. If there is any reason to include ethics in pandemic planning, it would be for the following considerations: How we respond to a pandemic strain of influenza virus, how we martial our social resources, how we work collaboratively, and how we treat people who are infected or pose a risk of infection to others is a reflection of our own humanity. The measure by which we can say our response to pandemic influenza is a humane and ethical one will be judged and interpreted in light of the policies, prescriptions, and management plans that are put in place. We can be certain that all actions will be evaluated in light of our response.",

The impact on the health care system was also unprecedented, resulting in the virtual closure of many large tertiary-care hospitals, the foregoing of services to non-SARS patients, the implementation of stringent infection control measures within hospitals, and the marked alteration of the usual practice and operation of health care facilities [1] .",

Many of those who were infected are still on disability or not at full health, even two years after the outbreak. Hundreds of health care workers were put in work quarantine. The psychological and psychosocial impact of SARS on health care workers was substantial. In a survey conducted by our unit, 45 percent of nurses scored above the General Health Questionnaire 12 cut-off point for psychological stress. Sixty-five percent of respondents reported SARS-related concerns for personal or family health. Many respon-dents found the infection control measures were intrusive and detracted from the quality of their work. In the aftermath of SARS, many health care providers recognized that the amount of risk imposed by the SARS outbreak was greater than they were willing to countenance and subsequently pursued alternative employment [3] .",

It was believed necessary to serve disease control, as she had contacted many people while ill, died from what was believed to be cardiac disease, and many had been at her funeral and in contact with family members who by that time were sympto-matic.

For the Canadian public, it was recognized that the interests of protecting the public health overrode some individual rights such as the freedom of movement. However, it was also recognized that when society imposes a duty on individuals to restrict their actions for the benefit of others, particularly for the benefit of public health, public health officials and society have a general duty to inform the individuals of the situation and to explain the reasons for the limitations of their freedoms. However, there is an important reciprocal duty to do as much as much as possible to assist the people whose rights are being infringed. This placed an onus on public health authorities to ensure that those quarantined had access to food, medication, and were psychologically and financially supported. The government of Ontario ensured workplace accommodation and income protection for those quar-antined.

One hospital invited its ethicist to participate in the local pandemic planning process. It was recognized that resource allocation issues featured prominently in pandemic planning, specifically access to scarce technology such as respirators and intensive care units. There was also a need to have equitable and fair human resource planning. After an ethics component was added to a draft hospital pandemic plan, the Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care of the Province of Ontario invited the Joint Centre for Bioethics working group to join its pandemic planning process around issues of how to allocate vaccines and antiviral medications. As a consequence, the ethical framework that the group developed was adopted and included in the provincial plan [10] .",

We recognize the pre-eminent need of the public health system to protect the public from harm, but actions taken should be proportional to the threat and risk. Privacy should be respected but may be overridden to protect the public from harm. Equity is an important value in that all patients have an equal claim to receive the health care they need under normal circumstances.

Reciprocity also requires that society ensure that those affected receive adequate care and do not suffer unfair economic penalties. If leaders expect people exposed to or suffering from communicable diseases to act in a manner that does not put others at risk, it is important that they create a social environment that does not leave people without supports. Measures to protect the public good are likely to impose a disproportionate burden on health care workers, patients, and their families.
