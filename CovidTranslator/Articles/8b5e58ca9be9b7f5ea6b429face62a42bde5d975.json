Donnelly et al. estimated that each year there are 43 million emergency department (ED) visits for patients < 5 years of age with a diagnosis of ARTI (rate: 354 per 1000 ED visits). [3] . Antimicrobials are not indicated for the common cold, bronchitis/bronchiolitis and the vast majority of pharyngitis cases, and specific criteria exists to target appropriate antibiotic use for otitis media, sinusitis and streptococcal pharyngitis. Yet, antibiotic prescribing is very common among children with ARTI, for bronchitis (71%), sinusitis (89%), and acute otitis media (86%) [4] . A study evaluating bronchiolitis management before and after the 2006 AAP guidelines found a significant reduction in RSV testing (p < .001) and decreased corticosteroids and bronchodilators use (p < .001) [5] . However, the trend in antibiotic use did not change (p = .07) in the post-AAP guideline period further highlighting the significant problem of overuse of antibiotics for ARTI.",

Molecular respiratory panel (MRP) assays are becoming increasingly popular due to their ability to detect multiple pathogens with high sensitivity and specificity and documented cost savings [6] [7] [8] . While research has demonstrated that MRPs may have a positive impact on patient outcomes such as decreasing empiric antibiotic exposures, length of hospital stay (LOS), and improving timely oseltamivir treatment for influenza patients [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] , there is a dearth of information on whether this clinical impact is conditional on the turn-around-time (TAT) of the MRP assay.",

The prevalence of narrow-and broad-spectrum empiric antibiotic treatment was also calculated, including the duration of empiric therapy, which was defined as the time difference, in hours, between the first and last antibiotic administration. We considered penicillin, ampicillin and clindamycin as narrow-spectrum antibiotics; all other antibiotics were considered broad-spectrum. We also evaluated use of chest radiographs within the first 48 h of admission and LOS (in hours) as secondary outcomes.

Kronman et al. found that antibiotics were frequently prescribed for bronchitis, sinusitis, and acute otitis media patients. [4] Byington et al. examined patients who received a direct fluorescent assay for respiratory pathogens and found that only 12.8% of patients who also received bacterial cultures tested positive for a bacterial infections [16] . We propose that use of MRP assays significantly improves diagnostic yield and accurately identifies viral etiology in majority of patients (\u223c60%; internal data monitoring over past 5 years), providing clinicians added confidence in antibiotic treatment decisions. Our findings provide much needed data to federal programs and insurance agencies that question the value of MRP assays in management of ARTI patients [17] . We feel our study contributes to existing evidence [18] on how rapid molecular diagnostics may further optimize appropriate care and management of ARTI patients.",

We hypothesized that having a shorter TAT may influence the clinician's decision making to delay empiric antibiotic therapy knowing that assay results would be available within a few hours. A study among patients who tested positive using a rapid influenza test found that when the clinician was aware of the results they were significantly less likely to prescribe antibiotics (7.3% vs. 24.5%) and more likely to give an antiviral [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] prescription (18.8% vs. 6.7%) relative to when the clinician was unaware the patient was positive for influenza. [13] In our study, patients with RP test results available approximately 26 h faster than RVP were less likely to have empiric antibiotic therapy (32.0% vs. 51.1%) as well as a significantly shorter duration of empiric broad-spectrum (6.4 vs. 32.9 h) and narrow-spectrum therapy (9.1 vs. 31.4 h). According to CDC guidelines, anti-influenza therapy is recommended for patients < 2 years with signs and symptoms of flu-like illness. [19] In addition, multiple observational studies have demonstrated that receipt of oseltamivir significantly improves patient outcomes for patients with influenza [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] , although clinical improvement is more likely if oseltamivir is initiated shortly after symptom onset [22, [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] . A prospective study of ICU influenza patients compared early treatment vs. late treatment oseltamivir administration and found that early treatment had shorter ICU LOS (18.4 vs. 22.7 days), shorter hospital LOS (27.2 vs. 34.0 days), and decreased likelihood of mortality (21.5% vs. 34.3%) [24] . In our study, nearly 80% of RP influenza patients received oseltamivir within 48 h of result availability, compared with 19.3% for RVP influenza patients. Utilization of tests with shorter TAT may ensure that optimal treatment for influenza infections is given.",

However, we purposely excluded these patients in an attempt to have a sample of otherwise healthy children. Second, this was a single-center study at a freestanding pediatric hospital, therefore our results may not generalize to all centers that provide care for ARTI. Third, we did not examine concurrent bacterial infections, which could partly explain empiric antibiotic treatment. Since the prevalence of concurrent bacterial infection is unlikely to be influenced by the assay type (i.e., RVP/RP), we would argue the potential of this biasing our results is minimal. We observed less human metapneumovirus and influenza cases during the RP phase which may have influenced treatment strategies, especially oseltamivir use. Patients tested but never admitted were excluded, thus our inpatient sample may represent patients with more severe ARTI symptoms. Lastly, we did exclude patients who tested negative, thus our study does not provide a complete representation of ARTI patients but rather addresses the importance of rapid respiratory pathogen detection on management of hospitalized patients. We intend to conduct future research on MRP assays that includes both negative and positive patients. This study demonstrates that adopting MRP assays with a shorter TAT can have a significant improvement for pediatric inpatients with viral ARTI, including decreased exposure to empirical antibiotics, decreased exposure to chest x-rays, increased optimization of timely oseltamivir administration, and shorter LOS. By providing respiratory pathogen results in a timely manner, rapid diagnostics have the ability to help guide clinicians on judicious antibiotic use for ARTI patients.",

Patients who were tested with RP were significantly less likely to receive any empiric antibiotic therapy prior to results from the MRP assay reported in the laboratory information system when compared to RVP patients (32.0% vs. 51.1%; p < .001 [Table 2]). After adjusting for patient age, organism, location, and seasonality, RP patients continued to be less likely to have empiric therapy (odds ratio [OR]: 0.45; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.39, 0.52). When considering just those patients who had > 1 empiric antibiotic administration, RP patients had a significantly shorter median duration of broad-spectrum (6.4 h vs. 32.9 h; p < .001) and narrow-spectrum therapy (9.1 h vs. 31.4 h; p < .001) compared to RVP patients. RP influenza patients were more likely to receive oseltamivir during the 48 h after result availability when compared to RVP influenza patients (79.0% vs. 19.3%; p < .001). After adjusting for patient age, order location, and calendar quarter, RP patients were more likely to receive post-MRP oseltamivir (OR: 13.56; 95% CI: 7.29, 25.20) when compared to RVP patients. Nearly 50% of RP influenza patients received oseltamivir within 6 h following the results (Fig. 3), whereas less than 10% of RVP patients received a dose during that same time period. The median LOS for RP patients (49.0 h) was significantly shorter when compared with RVP patients (54.3 h; p < .001). In addition, the median TAT for patients tested with the RP assay (1.4 h) was significantly shorter compared to the RVP (27.1 h; p < .001).",
