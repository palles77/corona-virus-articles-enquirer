Of these three substantive project components, the first, relating to habitat degradation and loss, was the largest and divided into four sub-components. The fourth component of the project dealt with regional co-ordination including facilitation of national level execution and securing intercountry agreement on project related matters. The financial appropriations approved by the GEF Council are presented in Table 1 , where it can be seen that the allocations from all sources for the priority habitats (mangroves, coral reefs, seagrass and wetlands) total just over 21 million US dollars or 63% of total project costs.

The estimated regional co-ordination costs included the costs of convening some 16 regional meetings per year for the first two years and around 10 per year thereafter, together with the costs associated with the activities of the Project Coordinating Unit. This criticism is examined in greater detail in the section on cost effectiveness below. 5 2. The management framework 2.1. Rationale for the design of the management framework At the time of project development, a number of factors influenced the design of the management framework, including inter alia: the geopolitical context of the South China Sea; the need to have a sound scientific basis for intended actions; and the desire to create a mechanism that was operationally effective and, at the same time, cost-effective. The latter concerns led to a recognition of the need for separate bodies of specialists to guide the implementation of the individual components and subcomponents whilst, at the same time, providing a framework (the Regional Scientific and Technical Committee) within which individual specialists could interact to determine overall regional priorities from a scientific and technical standpoint. The geopolitical context, with the ongoing territorial disputes and arguments regarding sovereignty, dictated the need to exclude non-involved countries from participating in decisions regarding project management and dictated the limitations on membership of the Project Steering Committee. Similarly, the desire of China not to \"internationalise\" the South China Sea resulted in limitation of the extent to which other international and regional organisations could be involved in the project.",

Each working group comprised the national focal points for the component or sub-component from each of the seven countries, together with up to four internationally recognised experts from the region (i.e., a maximum of 11 members) and one member of the Project Coordinating Unit.

In February 2004, therefore, the Project Steering Committee agreed to extend the duration of the project to June 2007. At its fifth meeting in December 2005, the Project Steering Committee took note of delays in the implementation of the demonstration sites and agreed to further extend the project's operational activities to June 2008 and operation of the Project Co-ordinating Unit to the end of that year to permit closure of financial documents and cleanup of any outstanding activities. Both these decisions involved no increase in the amount of the GEF grant funds, merely a reallocation of existing funds (Table 4 ). However, government in-kind and in cash co-financing was increased on both occasions to take account of additional costs, both financial and in terms of involvement of individuals from the countries in project activities.",

Table 4 shows that although the total project costs rose from the estimated 34.05 million to 36.17 million, reflecting the overall extension of duration of the project activities from 69 months to 80 months the actual cost to the GEF was less than the original estimate by 454,828 (2.7%). In contrast, the government cofinancing increased from an estimated 30% to 53.6% of total project costs. The estimate of personal cofinancing from PCU staff (403,809 US$) reflects unpaid overtime, holidays worked and weekends spent on travel. This illustrates the point made earlier that during project planning, personnel requirements are frequently underestimated by fund sources. Table 5 compares the original project estimates against final expenditures of the GEF grant. A number or notable points are illustrated by these data. First, although the total number of regional meetings convened under the auspices of the project rose from an originally planned 54 to 92 and, of these, the scientific conferences and mayor's round table meetings involved considerable numbers of participants the total costs of all meetings was 7% less than originally budgeted. The reasons for this reflect the decision of the Project Steering Committee to convene all regional meetings at the demonstration sites. This meant that the unit costs per person were considerably lower than the unit costs of convening the same meeting in a capital city or tourist destination. It is worth noting in this context that the unit costs per man day of the regional meetings actually declined over the life of the project, despite the fact that airfares increased.",

For example, in many regional and multi-lateral projects and programmes, emphasis is placed on a hierarchical structure such that a single country node or focal point is engaged by the co-ordinating agency or lead organization in dialogue with counterparts from other participating countries. In general terms, a multi-country project or programme Steering Committee is frequently constituted of high level, policy oriented, representatives from each country, who delegate operational level responsibility for the execution of activities to individuals or institutions within each country. Very often, the operational level individuals or institutions are neither provided with a regional forum within which to raise concerns reflecting operational difficulties within each country nor, indeed, have any contact with their operational counterparts in the other countries. More importantly, in these types of structure, the focus of attention remains at the national 96,000 100,000 4.2 level and regional and global considerations are frequently not considered in a national context at all. Such hierarchical structures suffer from the problem that whilst the vertical lines of communication are emphasized nationally, horizontal communication across the region is often weak or absent. The structure of the South China Sea Project provides an opportunity for the operational level personnel from each country to meet and share individual experiences regarding difficulties and solutions to the resolution of national level difficulties or impediments to successful completion of regionally agreed activities. This system was enhanced though the direct engagement of the national operational institutions (the Specialised Executing Agencies) and the focal ministries with a neutral third party, i.e., (UNEP, through Memoranda of Understanding MoUs). These MoUs commit the operational institution (and the named individual concerned) to complete tasks according to an agreed work plan and timetable, while those with the Focal Ministry commit the Ministries of Environment to undertake a national co-ordination role.",

As the focal points for each component in each country were members of their respective regional working group, direct communications between UNEP, represented by the PCU, and the component focal points were possible, enabling direct problemsolving between the two parties concerned. In cases, however, where such communication was unsuccessful in resolving difficulties, the PCU could (and in two instances did) approach the National Focal Point and National Technical Focal Points in the Focal Ministries to intervene.

By creating a more specialised lower-level forum, the opportunity existed to consolidate a wider body of highly specialised knowledge and experience before sharing it with specialists having other, often very divergent, interests and concerns. Thus, not only were the mangrove scientists networked together but they were also linked to, and networked both nationally and regionally with, other habitat specialists, pollution experts, fisheries specialists, lawyers and economists.
