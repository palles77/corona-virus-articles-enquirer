Treatment regimens for RSV-associated LRTI include aerosolized ribavirin, often in combination with palivizumab or intravenous immunoglobulin; supplemental oxygen; and respiratory support [4] [5] [6] . However, antiviral therapies are expensive, difficult to administer, and have not reliably prevented progression to LRTI [7, 8] .

The molecular epidemiology of RSV is characterized by sequencing a hypervariable region of the attachment (G) glycoprotein gene [11, 12] . Evidence of acquisition of the same viral strain in inpatient cancer care settings has demonstrated the importance of specific infection control policies to prevent nosocomial RSV transmission, although data describing this in the outpatient setting are not available [13] .

Previous studies in inpatient settings have shown that the number of RSV-positive cases decreased after implementation of these infection control interventions [17] . However, most cancer care is now delivered in the outpatient setting. The routine use of antibiotic prophylaxis and hematopoietic growth factors has reduced many risks associated with prolonged neutropenia and prolonged hospital stays [18] . It has been assumed that outpatients generally acquire their respiratory infections in the community through routine daily activities, such as work and exposure to children, and not through contact within the health care setting. Few data are currently available on transmission of RSV infection in the outpatient cancer care setting. In this study molecular virologic methods were used to demonstrate nosocomial transmission of RSV during 2 RSV outbreaks at a large outpatient cancer care center.",

However, many of these patients are seen routinely in outpatient clinics such as ours, where they continue to interact with health care providers and other patients on a regular basis. Few prior studies have examined nosocomial transmission of respiratory viral infections in the outpatient setting. A study by Nichols et al.

            "text": "In response to the RSV outbreak in 2007-2008, we implemented intervention strategies based on Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines for inpatient infection control settings, with interventions including staff cohorting, employee screening, and hand hygiene [28] [29] [30] . In an inpatient study by Lavergne et al. [17] , measures that included restriction of visitors with respiratory symptoms, droplet isolation precautions, and use of gowns, gloves, and masks by all patients, staff, and visitors were associated with a .09 relative risk of RSV as compared with a more traditional infection control policy. The interventions we implemented in an outpatient setting including heightened symptom surveillance of employees, visitors, and patients at every entry point to the clinic and the strict restriction from access to the clinic based on a positive symptom screen, use of gowns and gloves, and droplet isolation precautions of all clinic patients with respiratory symptoms. We observed that the number of new cases decreased after the intervention in 2008 despite continued high levels of community RSV . Phylogenetic trees were constructed using sequenced samples from the 2 outbreaks. The outbreak strains are identified by year followed by provider team. The reference and community strains are labeled with year followed by reference strain (RS) or community strain (CS). The numbers at the nodes are the bootstrap values. This phylogenetic tree shows the sequenced samples from the 2012 outbreak. Of the 10 outbreak strains, 9 were subtype A and 1 was subtype B. The tree with the highest log likelihood (e905.54) outbreak is shown. Community samples were collected during RSV season in the Seattle region from November to April from inpatients at Seattle Children's Hospital and the University of Washington, as well as community childcare attendees. activity as well as steady numbers of patient visits at the SCCA, suggesting that implementation of our strategy was effective in reducing the magnitude of the outbreak. In 2012, the magnitude of the outbreak was limited due to strict reinforcement of Level 2 precautions rather than escalation to Level 3 precautions. It is possible that Level 3 precautions would not have been necessary in 2008 if heightened enforcement of Level 2 precautions had been strictly enforced at that time as well.",

Detection of respiratory viruses in symptomatic staff, including high-risk pathogens such as RSV, influenza, parainfluenza, and metapneumovirus, indicates multiple opportunities for staff to introduce community respiratory viruses into an outpatient clinic. All these respiratory viruses have been associated with inpatient nosocomial outbreaks and have the potential to cause severe disease in immunocompromised patients [31] [32] [33] . Strict policies restricting symptomatic staff from working may mitigate the potential impact of provider transmission as the source of nosocomial outbreaks.",

            "text": "A study limitation is that we were unable to sequence most samples from the 2 outbreaks. Many samples were inadvertently discarded at the end of the RSV season and were not available for sequencing, including all employee samples. Possibilities for the inability to sequence the remainder of the samples include low viral loads and sample degradation. In the 2007-2008 outbreak in particular, only samples early in the outbreak were sequenced. It is therefore not possible to know whether the cases later in the season were due to continued transmission of the outbreak strain or to sporadic community cases. Additionally, no samples were collected from visitors or family members. These data may have provided additional information regarding the degree of clonal transmission by health care providers and family members in the outbreaks. We also acknowledge no clear epidemiologic data linking outbreak cases. However, in our center, there are multiple sites of potential interaction between patients and care providers, including radiology, phlebotomy, and waiting areas for clinics. Although not documented, we believe these interactions may provide potential exposures of patients to sick employees, and vice versa. It is also possible that the clustering of the RSV strains during the 2 outbreaks was a reflection of the dominant strain circulating during the season in the region. The molecular epidemiology of RSV usually involves 1 dominant strain that circulates over the course of a season [34, 35] . However, we found clustering of samples from both outbreaks distinct from co-circulating community strains collected during the same period, making this less likely. Increased sampling and detection during periods of the RSV outbreak may have been partially due to heightened awareness among providers, leading to potential sampling bias. Further, although we observed decreases in numbers of new cases after implementation of our infection control plan, we were unable to document efficacy of the intervention due to the retrospective observational nature of the study.",
