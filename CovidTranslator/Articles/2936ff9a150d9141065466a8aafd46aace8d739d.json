However, immunocompromised conditions induced by IS exacerbate the risk of opportunistic infections. 1\u00c03 Communityacquired respiratory viruses (CA-RVs), as well as multidrug-resistant bacteria and molds, have increasingly become of great importance, comprising a large burden on posttransplant infection. 2\u00c04 CA-RVs can cause lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI), resulting in mortality and lifethreatening morbidities in transplant recipients. 5\u00c08 SOT and HSCT recipients face different hurdles, such as susceptibility to CA-RV infection (CA-RVI) within posttransplant timeframe. 1\u00c04,9 HSCT recipients are mainly susceptible to severe CA-RVI in the early posttransplant period, including pre-engraftment with prolonged neutropenia. SOT recipients could be at risk of CA-RVI from the community at any time during the posttransplant period. 1, 2, 10 Non-transplant critically ill patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) are another group vulnerable to invasive CA-RVI. 11\u00c015 Among patients with severe rhinovirus pneumonia diagnosed using reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), transplantation did not comprise the majority of underlying conditions (To et al., 78%; Choi et al., 95.4%). 14, 15 Most patients with acute respiratory failure by respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) were also not transplant recipients. 16 Respiratory infections caused by CA-RVs apart from seasonal influenza A/B may have been under-diagnosed before the introduction of multiplex RT-PCR methods. 17, 18 As the diagnosis of the precise species of CA-RVI became possible, CA-RVs have had great clinical significance in severely immunocompromised patients. 19 The epidemiology and clinical outcome of adenovirus (AdV), human metapneumovirus (hMPV), parainfluenza (PIV), and RSV in SOT and HSCT recipients have been reported during the past few decades. 4, 19 However, there are few reports of unique features and impact on outcome or mortality of CA-RVI in non-transplant critically ill patients in ICU compared to transplant recipients, even though many reports have focused on the comparison of specific CA-RVI, particularly seasonal influenza virus, between SOT and HSCT recipients. 19 The clinical information of CA-RVI between these susceptible groups will be helpful to clinicians if they need to consider the different strategies or practices for treating CA-RV, especially in severe LRTI cases, among transplant recipients or non-transplant critically ill patients in ICU. This study aimed to evaluate the characteristics and outcome of symptomatic respiratory infection resulting from CA-RVs besides seasonal influenza A/B, between nontransplant critically ill patients admitted to the ICU and transplant recipients.",

We did not include seasonal influenza A/B, which could have been diagnosed using rapid antigen test beside RT-PCR or culture in this study. The CA-RVs tests were performed for patients with a suspicion of symptomatic CA-RVI based on the respective clinician's judgement. We excluded 3426 CA-RVs tests that were performed during the pretransplant period or in recipients who received both SOT and HSCT or re-transplantation. Thereafter, 10,616 and 3794 CA-RVs test results from SOT and HSCT recipients, respectively, were finally included. The non-transplant critically ill patients in ICU had undergone 23,367 CA-RVs tests (Fig. 1) . Repeated identical CA-RV isolation in one patient within 30 days were considered as the same infection. Therefore, the cohort included 85 (29.7%) and 61 (21.3%) CA-RVI cases in SOT and HSCT recipients, respectively, and 140 (49.0%) CA-RVI cases in non-transplant critically ill patients in ICU ( Fig. 1 and Table 1 ). This study was approved by Gangnam Severance Hospital Institutional Review Board, and the need for informed consent was waived due to the retrospective nature of the study.",

One of our major findings was that AdV caused significantly higher rates of respiratory infection in adult HSCT recipients, as compared to other non-immunocompetent groups.

Of 432 non-transplant patients with suspected sepsis in the previous study, 12 (2.8%) had RSV A/B and 23 (5.3%) had hMPV. 33 Gr\u00e9ve et al. reported 7 (0.5%) with hMPV and 21 (1.5%) with RSV among 1407 non-transplant patients admitted to the ICU on MV therapy in a prospective multicenter study in 2018. 11 Recent reports support our findings and indicate that hMPV and RSV should not be regarded as negligible pathogens and could be under-diagnosed in non-transplant critically ill patients, in particular on ventilated and ICU care. 11\u00c013,16,34 However, we do not have any consensus that these CA-RVs are directly related to poor outcome and attributable mortality in this population. 11, 12, 34 In addition, there is no standard guideline for prevention or treatment of CA-RVs among transplant recipients and non-transplant critically ill patients in ICU. Therefore, the guideline for indication of surveillance or diagnostic tests as well as treatment of specific CA-RVs in unique high-risk subpopulation through further prospective studies needs to be standardized to implement practices effectively.",

This could have resulted in overprescriptions leading to the lower positive rate, as well as under-prescriptions as no suspicion of CA-RVI, (2) retrospective data collection precluded us from obtaining precise incidence rates according to year or season. Nevertheless, comprehensive data with nearly total 40,000 exclusively multiplex RT-PCR tests in our study can be seen as a strength. In addition, the data demonstrated that recipients of SOT or HSCT have different frequencies for CA-RVI compared to non-transplant critically ill patients in ICU, and these three high-risk groups with positive rates of each CA-RV in RT-PCR tests were detected on a large scale at one hospital. The data from one hospital might ensure the homogeneity of severity and consistency of laboratory tests in the study population.",
