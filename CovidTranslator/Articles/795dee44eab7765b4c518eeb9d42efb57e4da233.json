            "text": "Abstract Background: In December 2007, the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine established a Task Force to develop standard operating procedures (SOPs) for operating intensive care units (ICU) during an influenza epidemic or mass disaster. Purpose: To provide direction for health care professionals in the preparation and management of emergency ICU situations during an influenza epidemic or mass disaster, standardize activities, and promote coordination and communication among the medical teams. Methods: Based on a literature review and contributions of content experts, a list of essential categories for managing emergency situations in the ICU were identified. Based on three cycles of a modified Delphi process, consensus was achieved regarding the categories. A primary author along with an expert group drafted SOPs for each category. Results: Based on the Delphi cycles, the following key topics were found to be important for emergency preparedness: triage, infrastructure, essential equipment, manpower, protection of staff and patients, medical procedures, hospital policy, coordination and collaboration with interface units, registration and reporting, administrative policies and education. Conclusions: The draft SOPs serve as benchmarks for emergency preparedness and response of ICUs to emergencies or outbreak of pandemics.",

At this time worldwide intensive care, infectious disease/microbiology, pulmonary and nursing societies were contacted to send representatives to participate. Society representatives Microbiology and Infectious Diseases, Infectious Diseases Society of America, British Infection Society and the French Infectious Disease Society) and pulmonary disease (French Respiratory Society) have been involved in the project from its initiation. The Task Force consists of experts in intensive care medicine, microbiology/ infectious diseases, nursing, epidemiology, public health, medical engineering and ethics. The initial idea was that the recommendations and standard operating procedures (SOPs) would be relevant for any disaster that would create an increased demand for hospital beds, a demand that would be difficult to meet. A procedure described below was developed to provide consensus for the final recommendations and SOPs. Although the procedure has not ended, the potential for a severe H1N1 pandemic outbreak in the upcoming winter months in the Northern hemisphere and the demands such an outbreak will create for ICU resources led the Task Force to immediately publish the recommendations and SOPs in their present state. The following chapters present the recommendations and SOPs of the key topics identified and developed by the Task Force, stressing points relevant to H1N1. A summary of these recommendations has been published as a review [1] . The information should also be helpful for other hospital areas and other types of emergency scenarios including mass casualty events. Search terms used for the literature review are shown in Appendix 1. The author's first-hand experience with emergency responses is found in Appendix 2.",

Based on a literature review and contribution of content experts, a listing of essential categories and subcategories for which SOPs would be developed were identified. A modified Delphi process was S5 used by the Task Force members to obtain consensus regarding the categories and subcategories and rate their importance. Task Force members voted for the major categories by agreeing, disagreeing or modifying them and rating their level of importance as essential, important or not important for inclusion. They were also requested to add categories that might impact on the emergency preparedness and that they believed were missing. Categories for which 80% or more of the raters agreed on the level of importance were defined as having achieved ''consensus'' and warranted inclusion in the study. Categories that did not receive this level of consensus were returned to the Task Force members with a request that they modify them in such a way that would be rated as important or that they be discarded as a category. A total of three Delphi cycles were conducted. Following the completion of the third Delphi cycle, agreement was reached that the following categories are important for emergency preparedness: triage, infrastructure, essential equipment, manpower, protection of staff and patients, medical procedures, hospital policy, coordination and collaboration with interface units, registration and reporting, administrative policies and education. Following the consensus for determining the categories and subcategories to be included in the SOPs, each category was assigned a primary author and expert group to draft the SOPs for that category. The drafted materials were then sent for review and comments to task members in order to map consensus and determine which elements were not agreed upon. To date, an organized poll of the entire task force for each chapter has not yet been implemented. Similar modified Delphi cycles will be conducted in order to approve each specific part of the chapters. As chapters for hospital policy, registration and reporting and administrative policies have not yet been written, important factors for those chapters have been incorporated in the present chapters. The chapters are presented in the order one might prepare their hospital for a disaster or H1N1 pandemic outbreak.",

This guidance should be used as a framework to guide the development of detailed systems and processes at local facilities. The detailed guidelines for frontline use should therefore be a product of the SOP, local situational awareness and the specific threat faced. Even in the setting of H1N1, assumptions based on previous H1N1 data may change based on the present deployment of effective vaccines, viral mutations and resistance to antiviral drugs such as neuraminidase inhibitors for which the H1N1 virus is presently sensitive [6] . Known data are evolving rapidly and should result in appropriate responses and changes in frontline guidelines. Such changes will be necessary because preparations must occur as soon as possible. ''Any deaths from 2009 influenza A (H1N1) will be regrettable, but those that result from insufficient planning and inadequate preparation will be especially tragic [19] .''
