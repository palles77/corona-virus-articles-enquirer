With the growth of knowledge and sophistication in the medical, radiographic, and orthopedic specialties, our focus in small animal arthrology and orthopedics expanded from fracture and cruciate repair to include the evaluation of degenerative, immune-mediated, infectious, and noninflammatory joint diseases. In the laboratory, methods for small animal specimens were modified to accommodate the smaller sample volumes. Concurrently, there has been a rapid increase in the number of serologic tests for the detection of infectious agents and immune disorders. From these beginnings, veterinarians can now recognize and treat an expanding list of joint diseases.",

The technique of arthrocentesis to acquire synovial fluid for analysis is no more difficult or imbued with risk than pleurocentesis or abdominocentesis. Synovial fluid analysis is also recommended in disorders characterized by persistent or fluctuating fever of unknown origin, shifting leg lameness, or generalized malaise in which arthralgia is suspected. In general, joints that contain excessive fluid should be sampled; however, if none exist, at least two to three joints should be Vet Clin Small Anim 33 (2003) sampled, especially the carpal and tarsal joints [1] . All cases of lingering lameness and those unresponsive to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs should have synovial fluid analyzed to rule out a chronic infectious process [2] . Arthrocentesis and examination of the synovial fluid can confirm the presence of arthritis, characterize the response as inflammatory or noninflammatory, and, in some circumstances, reveal the etiologic agent.",

Joints are made up of two opposing cartilage surfaces surrounded and supported by a multilayer capsule and bathed in synovial fluid. The proteoglycan matrix and collagen of articular cartilage are synthesized and maintained by chondrocytes located in lacunar spaces embedded within the cartilage. Proteoglycan consists of a polypeptide core with one or more negatively charged glycosaminoglycan (GAG) side chains. The GAGs of articular cartilage include keratin sulfate (KS), chondroitin sulfate (CS), and heparan sulfate. The major proteoglycan of articular cartilage is aggrecan, a large polymer consisting of numerous proteoglycan moieties noncovalently bound to a nonsulfated GAG, hyaluronan. Type II collagen predominates in articular cartilage, with smaller amounts of types VI, IX, X, and V/XI. The rigid collagen framework restricts the expansion of hydrophilic proteoglycans, providing articular cartilage with its unique ability to withstand compressive forces. As a result of normal cartilage maintenance, degradative enzymes, such as stromelysin (MMP-3), and proteoglycan fragments can be detected in synovial fluid. Assays for these enzymes are not readily available for diagnostic purposes.",

The inner synovial lining consists of two cell types: type A synoviocytes, macrophage-like cells with phagocytic function, and type B synoviocytes, fibroblast-like cells that produce hyaluronic acid.

In response to an insult, chondrocytes and synoviocytes release cytokines, which causes vasodilation of the subsynovial capillaries, leading to increased vascular permeability and extravasation of fluid, protein, and inflammatory cells into the joint space. The newly arrived leukocytes promote further inflammatory changes and cause the release of degradative enzymes from multiple cell types. The type and number of leukocytes that infiltrate the synovium and migrate into synovial fluid define the cellular components of the joint effusion and the clinical features of the arthritis [3, 4] .

Fluid samples for cell counts and cytologic assessment can be stored for 24 hours in the refrigerator, but it is best to make slides immediately [9] .

The viscosity and hyaluronic acid content of synovial fluid can adversely affect both methods [34] . The usual diluting fluid used for white blood cell (WBC) counts in blood cannot be used for synovial fluid because it causes acid precipitation of hyaluronic acid. The viscous nature of many synovial fluid samples causes inaccuracies in the pipetting and diluting of samples in either method. WBC counts generated by electronic counters are usually higher than those counted by manual methods, but the difference is not enough to alter interpretation [34, 46] . Several studies have indicated that the addition of hyaluronidase to the fluid before counting improves the consistency of TNCC counts and improves the quality of smears [9, 34] . This enzyme markedly reduces the viscosity, decreases the entrapment of cells, and produces a more random distribution of cells in the fluid. One or two drops of a 150-U/mL solution of hyaluronidase are added to a small aliquot of the synovial fluid. Within a few minutes, the fluid viscosity diminishes and the cells can be counted. It is important to realize that reducing the viscosity allows for rapid sedimentation of the nucleated cells. Samples treated with the enzyme must be mixed to resuspend cells before TNCC enumeration or preparation of smears. The addition of hyaluronidase also interferes with the mucin clot test.",

These cells are seen in fluids from normal as well as diseased joints. With some experience, the density of the nucleated cells on stained slides can be used to categorize the TNCC as normal, increased, or markedly increased. In a recent study, smears of normal synovial fluid revealed one to three nucleated cells per high-power field (HPF) (100\u00b7 oil-immersion objective). Each nucleated cell per HPF was equivalent to 1000 cells per milliliter [35] . Less than 10% of the nucleated cells in normal synovial fluid are neutrophils [6, 19] . These neutrophils are identical to those seen in blood and other body fluids. Neutrophils have a segmented nucleus in a pale pink or light blue cytoplasm (Fig. 6 ). Neutrophil morphology is examined for evidence of degenerative changes such as vacuolation and basophilia, which are frequently associated with the presence of infectious agents (Fig. 7) . Neutrophil cytoplasms should be examined for the presence of microorganisms. The remaining cells (90%) in normal joint fluid consist of small lymphocytes, monocytes, and macrophages (see Fig. 6 ). A few synovial membrane cells can be seen. Lymphocytes are smaller than neutrophils and have a thin rim of light blue cytoplasm and a smooth, dark purple, round nucleus (see Fig. 6 ). Monocytes have an abundant blue-gray cytoplasm surrounding a nucleus that can vary in shape and appear as indented, multilobulated, or band shaped (Fig. 8) . Macrophages are larger than neutrophils and have a blue-gray vacuolated cytoplasm and an oval or indented nucleus. Phagocytosed cell debris is noted occasionally in the cytoplasm (Fig. 9 ) and is especially prominent in degenerative joint disease and resolving or chronic inflammation. Infectious agents, especially fungi and protozoa, are sometimes found within macrophage cytoplasms.",

False increases in total protein can be caused by excessive EDTA relative to the amount of sample (short-filled EDTA tube) or by intra-articular injection of drugs.

Synovial fluid collected in a plain tube or heparin tube is preferred, because the test is inhibited by the presence of EDTA. One part of synovial fluid is added to four parts of 2.5% glacial acetic acid in a test tube (Fig. 14) . The precipitate formed is graded according to the following scale: good is indicated by a tight ropy clot in a clear solution, fair is indicated by a soft clot with a turbid solution, poor is indicated by a friable clot in a cloudy solution, and very poor is indicated by flocculent material in a cloudy solution [9] . If a small volume of fluid is collected, hyaluronic acid content can also be assessed by the viscosity of the fluid noted during collection and the density of the background staining observed microscopically. Synovial fluid pH can be measured with narrow-range pH paper. Measurement of pH must be done immediately after collection and cannot be done on EDTA samples. The reference range for synovial pH is 7.2 to 7.4. The pH decreases to values less than 6.9 within 12 to 24 hours after the initiation of joint sepsis in horses [43] .

By the time these changes are seen, however, the condition is well established and cartilage damage is irreversible. Earlier recognition of a degenerative process can enhance our ability to treat, monitor, and assess the effect of therapy in these patients [41] . Potential markers of early osteoarthritis in synovial fluid may be related to the mechanism of cartilage damage or to the increased metabolism of cartilage components. Markers may be unique to the disorder or may be detected in greater quantities in the presence of disease [42] . MMP-3, a matrix metalloproteinase, is released from chondrocytes in association with osteoarthritis. It can digest several components of articular cartilage and is likely responsible for much of the damage seen in degenerative joint disease. An increase in the concentration of MMP-3 in synovial fluid has been well documented by several investigators and holds promise as an early marker of osteoarthritis [42] . Some investigators have found an increase in KS concentrations in the synovial fluid of dogs in models of osteoarthritis and believe it is caused by increased proteoglycan catabolism associated with this condition [42] . In contrast, others detected a decrease in KS in naturally occurring osteoarthritis and cranial cruciate ligament rupture [42] . They concluded that the release of immature proteoglycan from cartilage undergoing catabolism was deficient in KS. An altered form of CS was identified in the synovial fluid of dogs that underwent experimental cranial cruciate transection [42] . The authors concluded that this altered CS might be an indicator of early cartilage degradation. Studies using models of osteoarthritis that did not involve arthrotomies did not find significant elevations in synovial CS [42] . These and other markers have been characterized, but their clinical applicability is limited at this time. Some of these marker assays may become available commercially if their clinical value can be established.",

Vascular leakage secondary to the effect of inflammatory mediators causes an increase in the volume of synovial fluid with capsular distention. Elevations in total protein and the presence of fibrin and coagulation proteins may cause the fluid to clot if it is not placed into an anticoagulant tube [6] . The color of the synovial fluid may be yellow to orange and often appears cloudy because of an increased number of nucleated cells (see Fig. 2 ). In cases of severe sepsis, the fluid may be opaque and appear yellowish green because of large numbers of degenerate neutrophils. Viscosity is often decreased as a result of enzymatic breakdown of hyaluronic acid by degradative enzymes derived from inflammatory cells or bacteria. Results of the mucin clot test are poor to very poor for similar reasons (see Fig. 14) . Decreased polymerization of hyaluronic acid also contributes to decreased mucin quality, especially in immunemediated disorders. Mucin clots graded as fair can be seen with less severe disease.",

Additionally, chronic infectious processes may have less dramatic elevations in cell counts [2] .

The distribution of joint involvement may provide valuable information. Septic arthritis is usually monoarticular and most often affects the proximal joints (hip, shoulder, and stifle). Immune-mediated disorders are often pauciarticular (two to five joints) to polyarticular (more than five joints), with more severe disease in the distal joints (carpi and tarsi) [31] . Multiple joints may need to be sampled to demonstrate the polyarticular nature of the disorder. Monoarthritic immunemediated disease occasionally affects only the elbow joint. Systemic infections with joint involvement usually present as polyarthritis, and the pathogenesis often has both an infectious and immune-mediated component. In addition, antigenic bacterial fragments may perpetuate inflammation initiated by a septic process in the absence of viable organisms [2] . Serologic tests for immune-mediated disorders (antinuclear antibody and rheumatoid factor) and infectious agents (Ehrlichia sp and B. burgdorferi) may assist in identification of the etiology.",

This information is supported by the cell counts, protein content, mucin clot test, bacterial culture, and serologic tests for infectious or immune-mediated disease. These results are integrated with the clinical history, physical examination, radiographic findings, and ancillary test results to arrive at a diagnosis and treatment plan. Fig. 19 . Canine joint fluid. This joint was hot, painful, and swollen, with radiographic evidence of osteolysis. The fluid is hemorrhagic and contains neutrophils and mononuclear cells. A second population of cells exhibiting marked variation in cell size and shape, variable nuclearto-cytoplasmic ratios, variation in nuclear size, and extremely variable nucleolar size and shape is visible. These cells are consistent with a malignancy of connective tissue origin. The histologic diagnosis was synovial cell sarcoma (Wright stain, original magnification \u00b7 1000).",
