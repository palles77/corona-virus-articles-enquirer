            "text": "This study tested the hypothesis that a set of predominantly myeloid restricted receptors (F4/80, CD36, Dectin-1, CD200 receptor and mannan binding lectins) and the broadly expressed CD200 played a role in a key function of plasmacytoid DC (pDC), virally induced type I interferon (IFN) production. The Dectin-1 ligands zymosan, glucan phosphate and the anti-Dectin-1 monoclonal antibody (mAb) 2A11 had no effect on influenza virus induced IFN\u03b1/\u03b2 production by murine splenic pDC. However, mannan, a broad blocking reagent against mannose specific receptors, inhibited IFN\u03b1/\u03b2 production by pDC in response to inactivated influenza virus. Moreover, viral glycoproteins (influenza virus haemagglutinin and HIV-1 gp120) stimulated IFN\u03b1/\u03b2 production by splenocytes in a mannan-inhibitable manner, implicating the function of a lectin in glycoprotein induced IFN production. Lastly, the effect of CD200 on IFN induction was investigated. CD200 knock-out macrophages produced more IFN\u03b1 than wild-type macrophages in response to polyI:C, a MyD88independent stimulus, consistent with CD200's known inhibitory effect on myeloid cells. In contrast, blocking CD200 with an anti-CD200 mAb resulted in reduced IFN\u03b1 production by pDC-containing splenocytes in response to CpG and influenza virus (MyD88-dependent stimuli). This suggests there could be a differential effect of CD200 on MyD88 dependent and independent IFN induction pathways in pDC and macrophages. This study supports the hypothesis that a mannan-inhibitable lectin and CD200 are involved in virally induced type I IFN induction.",

Although the original identification of pDC was complicated by their apparent lack of expression of surface markers associated with lymphoid and myeloid lineages e.g. CD19, CD3, CD11b, CD11c (in humans), CD13, CD33 and CD14 [2] , pDC have subsequently been found to possess both lymphoid and myeloid characteristics. Murine pDC are CD11c + B220 + CD11b \u2212 Ly6C + cells [1] , and can also be defined using single mAbs, for example 120G8 [3] and anti-Siglec-H [4, 5] .",

            "text": "Innate immune cells express many pattern recognition receptors (PRR) that allow sensing of foreign moieties, such as TLR, C-type lectins, scavenger receptors, retinoic acid inducible gene (RIG)-I-like and Nod-like receptors. Generally, these recognize microbe-associated molecular patterns (MAMP) that are not present on host molecules, allowing discrimination between self and non-self. As viruses replicate in host cells they are composed of nucleic acids, lipids and glycoproteins derived from self molecules which makes the mechanisms of viral detection more subtle. pDCs detect viruses through TLR7 and TLR9 recognition of viral genomes (e.g. single stranded RNA and CpG containing DNA). However, viruses contain additional potential MAMP, such as glycoproteins, which may be distinguished from self through the virally encoded amino acid composition of the glycoproteins or host derived modifications. For example viral glycoproteins are presented in a repetitive array on the virus particle, the glycosylation may differ due to the cellular stress during viral infection and the properties of the glycoproteins themselves may lend themselves to different glycosylation patterns compared to host proteins. Several TLR, C-type lectins (e.g. mannose receptor, DC-SIGN, DC-SIGNR and SIGNR1), scavenger receptors and collectins bind to glycoproteins from a range of DNA and RNA viruses (reviewed in [6] ). Therefore, we investigated whether the PRR on pDC were involved in viral particle and glycoprotein recognition leading to type I IFN production.",

This virus is referred to here as inactivated influenza virus and was non infectious (b100 plaque forming units/ml) by plaque assay (data not shown). Insect expressed glycoproteins were purified from the supernatant of baculovirus infected Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) insect cells. H5 haemagglutinin (HA) is from an H5N1 influenza virus (A/Vietnam/1194/04). H1 HA is from H1 influenza virus (A/New York/04). These were expressed with a human IgG1 Fc tag and purified as described previously [13] . The soluble outer domain (residues 251-481) of gp120 from HIV-1 CN54 was fused to a human IgG1 Fc tag. Alternatively, the gp120 CN54 was fused to a human IgG1 Fc tag mutated at leucine 234 and leucine 235 to valine and alanine respectively to prevent Fc receptor binding and is referred to here as gp120 CN54 (VA) [14, 15] . The spike protein from the Hong Kong isolate of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus was expressed with a tandem affinity purification (TAP) tag [16] .

To assess the effectiveness of the depletion, these samples were separated on a 10% gel by SDS-PAGE and proteins were detected by silver staining using standard protocols. The beads were enriched for protein (data not shown), while the supernatants were depleted of protein (assessed by silver staining in Fig. 1E ). As a control, the same volume and concentrations of proteins were incubated with PBS alone for 23 h. The \"depleted\" supernatants or mock treated protein samples were used in subsequent experiments.

Here, we investigated whether these receptors were involved in a key function of pDC, virally induced IFN\u03b1/\u03b2 production. To investigate a role for a lectin in sensing influenza virus, we used mannan, a polymer of mannose, which blocks several lectins including Dectin-2, mannose receptor and SIGNR1. Treatment of spleen cells with mannan inhibited influenza virus stimulated IFN\u03b1 and IFN\u03b2 production by pDC (Fig. 1A) . The inhibitory effect of mannan on inactivated influenza virus-induced IFN\u03b1/\u03b2 production by pDC was dose-dependent (Fig. 1B) . In addition, treatment of spleen cells with mannan had little effect on cell viability (data not shown). Furthermore, mannan treatment reduced the production of functional IFN (measured by bioassay) by spleen cells following inactivated influenza virus stimulation (Fig. 1C) . This led us to hypothesize that influenza virus may induce IFN\u03b1/\u03b2 production through the direct recognition of mannosylated ligands on the influenza virus particle, for example envelope glycoproteins, through a lectin.",

The influenza virus HA and gp120 CN54 used in Fig. 1D were Fc tagged, however the Fc tag was not required for IFN induction as gp120 bearing an Fc tag mutated in residues critical for Fc receptor binding (gp120 CN54 (VA)) ( Fig. 1F ) as well as glycoproteins lacking an Fc tag altogether such polyhistidine tagged gp120 (data not shown) and SARS spike (Fig. 1D ) all induced IFN production by spleen cells. To confirm that the IFN induction was specifically due to the HA or gp120 glycoproteins, and not a potential contaminant within the samples, these Fc tagged proteins were depleted from the preparations by incubation with protein G coated sepharose beads (GammaBind Plus Sepharose). The mock PBS treated and GammaBind Plus Sepharose treated \"depleted\" glycoprotein samples were separated by SDS-PAGE and proteins visualized by silver staining to demonstrate the effectiveness of the depletion by the loss of a protein band at the expected molecular weight for the glycoproteins (Fig. 1E, inset) . Depletion of the HA or gp120 CN54 abrogated IFN induction (Fig. 1E) . Samples were treated with polymyxin B to further confirm that the IFN induction by HA was not due to LPS.

CD200 is known to have inhibitory effects on myeloid cells, and consistent with this we found that CD200 KO macrophages produced more IFN\u03b1 than the C57BL/6J control macrophages following polyI:C stimulation (Fig. 5A) . To test the effect of CD200 on pDC function, spleen cells were incubated with the OX90 mAb against CD200, which blocks CD200 interaction with CD200R (unpublished observation, N. Barclay), or an isotype control mAb or no Ab and then stimulated with either of the MyD88dependent stimuli CpG ODN or inactivated influenza virus. OX90 treatment significantly inhibited IFN\u03b1 production by spleen cells at 23 h in response to CpG ODN stimulation (Fig. 5B) . The same level of blocking was observed with OX90 concentrations as low as 10 \u03bcg/ml (data not shown). In addition, OX90 also slightly reduced IFN\u03b1 production by spleen cells in response to inactivated influenza virus, however, the effect was not significant by paired ANOVA (Fig. 5C) . Intriguingly, OX90 did not affect IFN\u03b1/\u03b2 production by pDC following 9 or 12 h stimulation with CpG ODN (data not shown), suggesting the effects of OX90 develop over time. OX90 was not toxic as treatment of spleen cells for 23 h with 10 or 100 \u03bcg/ml OX90 or an isotype control mAb, in the presence or absence of CpG ODN, had no effect on the percentage of dead cells (data not shown). As a further control, a nonblocking mAb against CD200R OX110, was tested. This mAb, binds to CD200R, but does not disrupt its interaction with CD200 (unpublished observation, N. Barclay). OX110 had no effect on IFN\u03b1 production in response to influenza virus or CpG ODN, compared to the isotype control mAb (Fig. 5D) , showing that a blocking Ab against the CD200-CD200R interaction is required to inhibit the response. IFN production by CpG ODN or inactivated influenza virus stimulated C57BL/6J or CD200 KO splenocytes was also measured by bioassay, however due to a large variation in the levels of IFN produced, this assay was not powerful enough to enable meaningful interpretation. These data suggest that CD200 promotes MyD88-dependent IFN\u03b1 production, in contrast to the known inhibitory effect of CD200 on myeloid cells and the observation that CD200 deficient macrophages produced higher levels of IFN\u03b1 in response to a MyD88-independent stimulus.",

Although pDC expressed low levels of Dectin-1, no evidence was found for a Dectin-1 function in induction of IFN\u03b1/\u03b2 in response to inactivated influenza virus. However, mannan, which blocks receptors recognizing mannosylated ligands including the mannose receptor, SIGNR1 and Dectin-2, inhibited IFN\u03b1/\u03b2 production by pDC following influenza virus stimulation, suggesting a function for such lectins in viral recognition. Studies designed to identify a function for a specific mannose binding receptor, utilizing mannose receptor KO spleen cells or the blocking anti-SIGNR1 mAb ERTR9, were inconclusive (data not shown) due to large ranges in IFN production from C57BL/6J splenocytes and highly variable affects of ERTR9. Others have shown that several monosaccharides, mannan and anti-mannose receptor antiserum reduced IFN\u03b1 production by human peripheral blood mononuclear cells in response to herpes simplex virus-1 [29] . Furthermore, mannan inhibited influenza virus stimulated IFN\u03b1/\u03b2 production by spleen cells [30] . Together these studies implicate a mannose specific receptor and mannose receptor in particular as being involved in IFN\u03b1 induction in response to several viruses either as an uptake receptor or a signaling pattern recognition receptor. As mannan blocks receptors which recognize certain mannosecontaining carbohydrates, we hypothesized that viral glycoproteins were the stimulus for the mannan inhibitable component of IFN induction. We found that highly mannosylated viral glycoproteins produced in insect cells could stimulate IFN production by spleen cells in a mannan-inhibited manner, suggesting a lectin could recognize glycosylation of the viral proteins. Further evidence for viral glycoproteins inducing IFN production is reviewed in [6] . Whether this ability to induce interferon is a property of the viral glycoprotein per se, or a result of protein expression in insect cells is currently unclear. However, recognition of glycans synthesized in insect cells is also relevant for the understanding of immune responses to insect vector-borne viruses and vaccines which use recombinant proteins expressed in insect cells.",

It may be interesting in future to test the requirement of CD36 in CpG induced IFN\u03b1/\u03b2 production by pDC as some scavenger receptors, which are endocytic, can enable the uptake of CpG ODN which signals through TLR9 in the endosomes of pDC to induce IFN\u03b1/\u03b2 production [31] .",

CD200 and CD200R are an immunomodulatory receptor-ligand pair which inhibit a range of myeloid cell functions including cytokine secretion by macrophages. MyD88dependent TLRs recognize viruses and induce IFN in pDC, but IFN production in macrophages is dependent primarily on a TRIFdependent pathway (TLR-3). Because these two cell types use either MyD88-or TRIF-dependent IFN production we compared them to investigate the influence of CD200 on both MyD88 and TRIF mediated signaling pathways. CD200 KO macrophages produced more IFN\u03b1 than the C57BL/6J macrophages, consistent with an inhibitory effect of CD200 in these cells. Intriguingly, the OX90 blocking mAb against CD200, significantly inhibited CpG ODN (TLR9-and MyD88-dependent) IFN\u03b1 production by splenocytes and reduced inactivated influenza virus (TLR7-and MyD88-dependent) induced IFN\u03b1, suggesting that CD200 normally enhances IFN\u03b1 production via MyD88-dependent pathways in these cells. It has been reported that treatment of pDC with soluble CD200 can either induce IFN\u03b1 production or enhance CpG induced IFN\u03b1 production [32, 33] , supporting the hypothesis that CD200 has positive regulatory functions. The effects of CD200 on pDC are likely to be through its receptor CD200R as CD200 itself has no known signaling capacity. It has been suggested that CD200 may also engage CD200Rlike molecules [34] , however in extensive studies by Wright et al. and Hatherley et al. no evidence was found that CD200 could interact with CD200R2, CD200R3, CD200R4 or CD200RLe [35, 36] . Intriguingly, there are several viral homologues of CD200 which, in the limited assays tested so far, behave similarly to the endogenous CD200. The fact that several viruses possess CD200 homologues suggests that this molecule is important in the virus lifecycle and may play a role in anti-viral immunity.",

Our results suggest that CD200 inhibits MyD88-idependent IFN\u03b1 induction in macrophages, while in contrast, CD200 is a positive regulator of TLR9 (CpG ODN) and possibly of TLR7 (inactivated influenza) MyD88-dependent IFN\u03b1 inducing pathways. . Spleen cells were incubated with no Ab or 100 \u03bcg/ml rat IgG2a isotype control or OX90 (anti-CD200 blocking mAb) and then stimulated for 23 h with 1 \u03bcM CpG (B) or 530 HAU/ml inactivated influenza virus (C) (n = 3). (D) As a control, spleen cells were incubated with no Ab, rat IgG1 isotype control or OX110 (a non-blocking anti-CD200R mAb) and then stimulated for 23 h with 530 HAU/ml inactivated influenza virus or 1 \u03bcM CpG (n = 1). INF\u03b1 production was measured by ELISA.",
