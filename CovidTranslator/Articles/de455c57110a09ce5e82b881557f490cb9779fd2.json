This article critically examines the underlying assumption that conscientious objection is incompatible with a physician's professional obligations (the ''incompatibility thesis''). Several accounts of the professional obligations of physicians are explored: general ethical theories (consequentialism, contractarianism, and rights-based theories), internal morality (essentialist and non-essentialist conceptions), reciprocal justice, social contract, and promising. It is argued that none of these accounts of a physician's professional obligations unequivocally supports the incompatibility thesis.",

Suppose outcomes are assessed on the basis of well-being and an outcome with more overall well-being is better than one with less overall wellbeing. Supporters of the incompatibility thesis might claim that more overall wellbeing will result if physicians are not allowed to refuse to provide medical services for reasons of conscience. However, those who reject the incompatibility thesis might advance the opposite claim. It is doubtful that empirical evidence is available to confirm decisively or disconfirm either claim. Moreover, it is overly simplistic to talk about comparing a conception of professional obligations that permits conscientious objection with one that does not, for there are a variety of conditions that might be placed on conscientious objection, such as requirements to notify in advance and refer. In addition, the calculation can become even more complex if an ideal or pluralistic conception of well-being is adopted, and intrinsic value is ascribed to moral integrity, the primary value underlying claims of conscience [3] .",

There are some differences in the derivation and characterization of the internal morality of medicine in their numerous books and articles. However, these are all more or less variations on the same theme, which specifies the end of medicine as healing and which characterizes the physicianpatient relationship as one between a professional committed to healing and a vulnerable patient who is ill and seeks help from the professional [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] . According to this account, insofar as the end or goal of medicine is healing, entering the profession requires a commitment to that end (i.e., healing patients). If an individual is not willing and able to make such a commitment, she should not become a doctor, and anyone with a medical license who does not make and consistently honor that commitment is not a virtuous physician. Although it might be questioned whether healing is the only end of medicine, it is plausible to maintain that healing is associated with the concept of medicine (or any credible conception of it), and it is arguable that an individual who is not committed to that end fails to qualify as a physician, let alone a virtuous one. For example, suppose Dr. Brickstone becomes a Christian Scientist after completing his residency in obstetrics/gynecology. He now refuses to provide any medical intervention and promotes prayer as the only acceptable means of healing and pain control. We justifiably would be reluctant to say that he is promoting the goals of medicine or even engaged in its practice. But, what if, due to conscience-based objections, another ob/gyn physician, Dr. Morrison, refuses only to prescribe emergency contraception, perform abortions, and administer terminal or palliative sedation? Does it follow that she is failing to honor a commitment to promote healing? There are at least two reasons for a negative answer.",

Healing can be interpreted narrowly, such that it is limited to curing and/or treating diseases, or, as Pellegrino proposes, it can be interpreted broadly: ''To care, comfort, be present, help with coping, and to alleviate pain and suffering are healing acts as well as cure. In this sense, healing can occur when the patient is dying even when cure is impossible'' [6, p. 568 ]. As laudable as this more expansive conception of the end of medicine may be, the claim that it is derived from the concept of medicine as a profession is implausible. Until fairly recently, it was not generally accepted within the medical profession that physicians have a legitimate role in providing care and comfort to dying patients. Palliative care advocates could not rely on a timeless concept of medicine and its end(s). Instead, it was necessary to promote a more expansive conception of the goal(s) of medicine. Insofar as it is debatable whether ''healing'' does or should include palliative care, it is a contested concept, and conceptual analysis alone cannot conclusively resolve the debate.",

But, what if Dr. Morrison also refuses to perform therapeutic abortions-i.e., abortions to prevent morbidity or mortality? Don't abortions to protect a pregnant woman's health or life clearly fall within the scope of the physician's professional obligation to promote healing? Dr. Morrison might defend a negative answer by claiming: (1) since the result is the death of the fetus, even a therapeutic abortion cannot be characterized as an act of healing, or (2) performing therapeutic abortions falls outside the scope of legitimate means for physicians to promote healing. The former claim cannot be refuted by appealing to the plain meaning of ''healing.'' To be sure, the latter claim is contrary to current professional norms. However, they are norms, and it is implausible to claim that they derive from a timeless and uncontestable conception of the end(s) of medicine.",

This feature is the alleged nature of the physician-patient relationship and the corresponding professional obligation of physicians to give priority to patients' interests over their own. As Pellegrino puts it: a ''suppression of self-interest'' is mandatory ''when the welfare of [patients] requires it'' [5, p. 378 ]. This obligation is said to derive from the physician's commitment to healing combined with the vulnerability of patients, which is due to illness and the power and knowledge differential between them and physicians. The reasoning is as follows: In order to promote healing, physicians must not allow their own interests to interfere with their clinical judgment and recommendations. Moreover, if physicians did not demonstrate a willingness to suppress their self-interest and, when healing requires it, place the interests of patients above their own, patients would not trust physicians. Maintaining trust, however, is essential because it is a precondition of an effective and enduring physician-patient relationship (i.e., a relationship that enables the physician to practice her profession and pursue the goal of healing).",

Rhodes claims that a physician who refuses to provide a service for reasons of conscience imposes ''burdens of time, inconvenience, [and] financial costs'' on patients [11, p. 78 ]. However, if ''medicine's standard of altruism'' required physicians to put patients' financial interests or interest in convenience above their own, let alone their arguably more significant interest in moral integrity, it would be a violation of a physician's professional obligations to charge patients with financial problems, take vacations, limit time spent with patients, or refuse to make house calls or schedule night-time and weekend appointments for patients with day jobs. 3 More to the point in the context of an analysis of the essentialist conception of the internal morality of medicine, insofar as the end of medicine is said to be healing, the interests of patients that a physician would be required to put above his own would be limited to those related to healing, and there is no apparent connection between the interests identified by Rhodes and healing-related interests.",

As this statement indicates, they reject the implausible absolutist view that the healing-related interests of patients always trump physician interests. They do not provide a criterion for striking an appropriate balance, but any reasonable criterion would have to distinguish among interests according to their importance or significance and moral weight; and a physician's interest in moral integrity is a very important interest that has substantial moral weight. 4 In any event, the admission that a balancing of interests is required to determine a physician's obligations suggests that it is mistaken to believe that a general duty to treat despite conscience-based objections is derivable from an essentialist conception of the internal morality of medicine. 5 Accordingly, that conception does not unequivocally support the incompatibility thesis.",

However, there does not appear to be such a tradition within Western medicine.

On the contrary, as evidenced by numerous professional codes and guidelines enacted in ensuing years permitting physicians to refuse to provide services that violate their personal moral and/or religious beliefs, it seems that the medical profession tended to embrace conscientious objection (see, e.g., [20, 21] ).",

Hence, it is not sufficient to argue that there was an anticonscientious objection moral tradition within medicine.

Physicians enjoy certain rights, privileges, and benefits as professionals. These include a monopoly to provide certain services, self-regulation, subsidized education and training, and government support for research. Some of these rights and privileges (for example, a monopoly to provide certain services and self-regulation) belong collectively to the profession, and others (for example, permission to provide certain services, subsidized education and training, relatively high income) belong to individual physicians. According to the reciprocal justice model, such rights, privileges, and benefits generate corresponding professional obligations, such as an obligation to make recommendations based on considerations of patient welfare rather than financial self interest and an obligation to treat patients with infectious diseases. Individuals incur these obligations when they (voluntarily) enter the medical profession.",

For even if reciprocal justice is the basis of professional obligations, reciprocitybased obligations are too general to provide grounds for a blanket rejection of conscientious objection. Assuming physicians have an obligation to promote the health and well being of patients that may require some self-sacrifices, it remains to specify how much is required. From the general principle that some self-sacrifice is required, it may follow that physicians are required to incur increased risks from exposure to infectious diseases or bioterrorism agents. However, that principle fails to specify the level of risk that is required. Generally, it might be said that only a ''reasonable'' risk is required, but it is then necessary to specify a criterion of reasonableness. Similarly, in the case of conscientious objection, the key question is: what is a ''reasonable'' reciprocity-based requirement? It is arguable that a requirement to provide services even when a professional has a conscience-based objection to doing so is no more reasonable than a requirement that physicians treat patients no matter how high the risk of death due to epidemics or bioterrorism. It is also arguable that more reasonable reciprocity-based requirements would set limits to risks and would permit conscientious objection with procedural requirements to protect patients, such as advance notification and referral.

It is not readily apparent that conscience-based refusals to provide medical services are incompatible with a profession's pledge ''to be trustworthy in its competence and use of its special knowledge, privileges and powers to help society and the individuals in it.'' Moreover, the protection afforded to conscientious objection by physicians in laws, professional codes, and institutional policies appears to undermine the claim that the outcome of the social negotiation between society and the medical profession bars conscience-based refusals to provide legal and professionally approved services.

To cite two additional examples, performing colonoscopies is a ''normal'' or standard procedure within gastroenterology, but not all gastroenterologists perform colonoscopies; and delivering babies is a ''normal'' or standard practice within obstetrics/gynecology, but not all obstetrician/gynecologists deliver babies. In neither case does a physician's failure to provide the service at issue constitute the breaking of a promise made upon entering her respective subspecialty. This is not to deny, as acknowledged earlier, that there may be certain ''core'' services associated with a particular specialty or subspecialty that set limits to such specialization and division of labor.
