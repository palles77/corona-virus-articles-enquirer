Bronchitis peaks during winter months, when respiratory viruses are prevalent in the community. A recent stratification of bronchitis into four distinct categories has been suggested.*\" The first category is acute tracheobronchitis usually of viral origin and not requiring antibiotic therapy; second is simple chronic bronchitis with forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV,) greater than 50% of normal, increased sputum volume, and purulence. Third is complicated chronic bronchitis with increased sputum volume and purulence plus at least one of the following: FEV, greater than 5070, more than four exacerbations per year, advanced age and comorbid conditions like congestive heart failure (CHF). Categories 2 and 3 are usually caused by Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and/or Moraxella catarrhalis. Fourth is chronic bronchial infection similar to category 3 with continuous sputum production throughout the year, often associated with enteric gram-negative pathogens including Pseudomonas aeruginosa.",

B. pertussis should be considered in any adult with a cough illness lasting more than 2 to 3 weeks.19 Acute bronchitis typically begins as an acute viral infection and manifests with cough and occasionally sputum production in the absence of tachycardia, tachypnea, significant fever (> 350 C), or an abnormal chest exam. Productive sputum is not predictive of viral, bacterial, or noninfectious causes of cough such as asthma, postnasal discharge, or gastroesophageal reflux disease.38, 39 Causative roles of S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae in acute bronchitis have not been demonstrated. Such roles are difficult to establish, because these organisms may colonize the normal respiratory tract.21, 38, 39 Acute bronchitis is a clinical diagnosis, and antimicrobial therapy in the uncomplicated host is not indicated. Bacterial cultures, sputum gram smears, and viral studies on respiratory secretions are not normally helpful and may be misleading.38, 39 A major exception is the adult patient with suspected pertussis in whom documentation of B. pertussis should be attempted. Culture, serology, and more sensitive and specific amplification methods (e.g., polymerase chain reaction [PCR] ) are available in reference laboratories. Consensus recommendations for diagnosis of B. pertussis by PCR have been proposed and may become the \"gold standard\" for diagnosis of pertussis syndrome.12 Presently, however, there is no single, standardized PCR method available. Many laboratories also have the expertise and resources to provide culture and detection of organisms with direct fluorescent antibody (DFA) stains. DFA smears suffer inter-observer variability and lack sensitivity and specificity compared with culture. Calcium-alginate nasopharyngeal swabs or aspirates should be submitted in appropriate transport media. The swabs should never be transported dry. The choice of transport medium depends on the time required for delivery of the specimen to the laboratory. Individual laboratories should be contacted for appropriate transport media and instructions. B. pertussis becomes progressively more difficult to culture over the course of the infection. In adults in whom the course may be protracted, supplemental studies may increase the diagnostic yield. If available, the combination of serology and/or PCR in conjunction with culture may be warranted.\", 23",

The role of comorbid conditions like underlying heart disease, chronic lung disease, or immunosuppression is important. Viruses, including influenza virus, parainfluenza virus, RSV, rhinovirus, and coronavirus, contribute to AECB.ls s. pneurnoniae and H. infuenzae are found in at least half of the patients with AECB, but they may colonize patients with and without AECB. Their isolation rate does not increase during symptomatic episodes. B. pertussis is recognized as a potential contributor to exacerbation. Anaerobes and M . pneurnoniae are not commonly found in AECB, while C. pneurnoniae is associated with a mild form of disease characterized by cough lasting for weeks. Other bacteria such as beta-hemolytic streptococci, staphylococci, as well as the gram-negative enteric bacilli, rarely contribute to exacerbations and are found in only 10% to 15% of sputum cultures from patients with AECB. Because most of these organisms are commonly present in respiratory secretions in patients with bronchitis, bacterial cultures of sputum are of little value, and the isolation of potential pathogens does not confirm their role in AECB. Smears may delineate the presence of a predominant organism, but microbiological work-up of respiratory secretions rarely contributes to therapeutic decisions. Thus, when required, initial therapy should be directed empirically and should normally cover pneumococci, Haemophilus, and Moraxella. In certain clinical settings (such as the patient with protracted cough lasting more than 3 weeks), B. pertussis should be con~idered.~~ There will be patients who need more microbiologic evaluation than usual, so clinical judgment is needed. Compromised hosts such as patients with multiple myeloma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and patients on long-term corticosteroid therapy are in this category. Recurrent AECB and pneumonia should raise the specter of underlying immunoglobulin deficiency as in acquired hypogammaglobulinemia.",

The noncommensal organisms are best termed \"professional pathogens,\" because they rarely colonize without infecting. These pathogens include Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB), Legionella species, Pneumocystis carinii, some other fungi, and specific respiratory viruses such as influenza. These noncommensal organisms are often considered in certain hosts, and specialized, selective methods are required to identify them. Their isolation in patients with clinical pneumonia often establishes the specific cause of the pneumonia. The commensal organisms are much more common causes of pneumonia and require the clinician to ask if these organisms are truly causing the infection or merely colonizing respiratory surfaces.44 S. pneurnoniae is the most common cause of CAP and is especially prevalent in patients requiring hospitali~ation.~~, 38, 39, 44 Published incidence studies of CAP underestimate the true frequency of S. pneumoniae, because diagnosis of the specific etiology is rarely attempted.27 Specific etiology identification often requires detection in a normally sterile site such as the blood, pleural fluid, or lung. A Gram's stain of well-collected sputum showing many white blood cells (WBC), few squamous epithelial cells, and a predominance of gram-positive lancet-shaped diplococci with S. pneumoniae on culture is supportive of this diagnosis. Pneumococci still account for two thirds of the identified pathogens in hospitalized patients with CAP and in patients dying from CAP.14 Community-acquired pneumonias can be caused by other pyogenic bacteria such as H. influenzae, S. aureus, and enteric bacilli.

An estimated 100,000 new cases of C. immitis infection occur annually.

Guidelines from both the American Thoracic Society (ATS) and the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) disagree on the extent of diagnostic testing needed in patients with CAP.l, ATS guidelines recommend empiric therapy without routine microbiological work-up, whereas IDSA guidelines support work-up whenever possible and especially in patients requiring hospitalization. Microbiological diagnosis of CAP may fail in over 50% of patients. Increased success in microbiological diagnosis usually occurs in patients who produce sputum, have not been treated with antibiotics, and require hospitalization. A specific microbial diagnosis allows appropriate antimicrobial selection and detection of resistant organisms. Increasing worldwide microbial resistance may force more specific diagnosis of CAP. Likewise, the potential for less common but possibly more serious causes of CAP such as Legionella, TB, nocardiosis, pneumocystosis, and other local fungal etiologies needs to be considered. Clinical acumen is important, because blood and/or pleural fluid cultures are rarely positive, sputum Gram's stain and culture are difficult to interpret, and the clinical manifestations of pneumonia are rarely specific for a single pathogen.

Although the specificity of EIA is normally high (>90%), false-positive serum results can occur. To avoid erroneous interpretation, serum and urine specimens should be submitted for concurrent evaluations. Antigenemia without antigenuria is rare, and such a finding should raise suspicion of a false-positive result.52 Antigen EIA studies are available only from the Histoplasmosis Reference Laboratory at Indiana University (1001 W.

The abnormal host requires a different approach and, in general, the more compromised the host, the more aggressive the laboratory evaluation. A renal transplant patient with respiratory symptoms often follows the dictum that \"common things happen commonly;\" however, the clinician needs that extra level of assurance in this case. Some transplant patients may have respiratory illness caused by strongyloidiasis. Cystic fibrosis is another example of the need for a more comprehensive laboratory evaluation. Specialized selective media and additional susceptibility studies may be needed to evaluate isolates associated with exacerbation of symptoms in these patients. The clinical laboratory should be forewarned of any materials coming from invasive diagnostic techniques, so they can prepare and offer useful advice regarding specimens, transport, and follow-up. Microbiological laboratories are often most knowledgeable regarding what type of testing is appropriate. Direct communication with the laboratory is essential to assure the best patient care.",
