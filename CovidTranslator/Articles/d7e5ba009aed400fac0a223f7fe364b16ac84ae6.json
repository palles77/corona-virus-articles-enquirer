Here, we combine these two approaches toprofile RNA recombination within the encapsidated genome of a eukaryotic RNA virus, Flock House Virus. We detect hundreds of thousands of recombination events, with single-nucleotide resolution, which result indiversity in the encapsidated genome rivaling that due to mismatch mutation. We detect previously identified Defective-RNAs as well as many other abundant and novel Defective-RNAs. Our approach is exceptionally sensitive, unbiased, and requires no prior knowledge beyond the virus genome sequence. RNA recombination is a powerful driving force behind the evolution and adaptation of RNA viruses. The strategy implemented here is widely applicable and provides a highly detailed description of the complex mutational landscape of the transmissible viral genome.",

Breakage rejoining mechanisms are similar to that occurring during mRNA splicing and involve a catalytic ligation of two RNA molecules. During copy-choice recombination, RNA replication is halted mid-flow and the template RNA dissociates. The nascent RNA remains associated with its polymerase,however, andis able to re-prime replication either at a new position on the original template or on a new template strand. Copy-choice recombination is thought to be the most common mechanism for RNA recombination in many RNA viruses and is thought to primarily occur during the synthesis of the negative-sense RNA strand from the positivesense RNA genome.",

Additionally, Defective-RNAs are often packaged into viral particles and so may contain the necessary motifs required for encapsidation. If a Defective-RNA is able to attenuate the replication of the full-length RNA genome through competition for access to the RdRp, then they are known as Defective-Interfering (DI) RNAs. 13 DI-RNAs arise during both persistent and acute infections most commonly in cell culturebut also occur during wild infections.",

It is the prototypic member of the Nodaviridae family and provides an important model for the study of many pathogenic human viruses includingpoliovirus, human rhinovirus and hepatitis C virus (reviewed in). FHV naturally infects insects including Drosophila melanogaster as well as medically important insects such as mosquitoes (including Anopheles gambiae) and thetsetse fly. 20 The FHV genome consists oftwo positive-sense, single-stranded RNAs. RNA 1 (3.1 kb) encodes the RNAdependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) which can autonomously replicate the FHV genome. RNA 2 (1.4 kb) encodes the capsid precursor protein, \u03b1, 180 copies of which form the viral capsid.FHV packages one copy each of RNA 1 and RNA 2, but on average, nearly 2% of the packaged RNA is derived from transcripts of the host genome. 21 Additionally, virus-like particles (VLPs) of FHV can be made in cell culture by expressing the single capsid protein from a baculoviral vector in Sf21 cells. 22 VLPs spontaneously assemble into particles that are closely similarto native FHV, except that they package ribosomal RNAs, transcripts derived from the baculoviral expression vector and other cellular RNAs. 21 Next-Generation sequencing (NGS) has been used in multiple investigations to assess the polymorphism and mutation frequency within a viral genome, for example, in HIV, 23 human rhinovirus, 24 and foot-and-mouth disease virus. 25 With NGS technology it is possible to detect fusion events that may occur during RNA/DNA recombination and has been used to characterize mRNA splicing events 26 and to identify oncogenic chromosomal rearrangements.Here, we use NGS to investigate the sequence variation as a result of RNA recombination within the genome encapsidated by FHV. We profile with single nucleotide resolution hundreds of thousands of recombination events that have occurred during FHV genome replication and which have subsequently been encapsidated into virus particles.",

Note that the FHV RdRp would not be able to replicate the FHV RNA 2 derived from the baculovirus vector as this is cloned without the appropriate 5' and 3' UTRs required for viral replication. 6 To illustrate the detection of recombination, we mapped the reads to two specific Defective-RNAs(R2D675 and R1D1626) that are known to arise during passaging of FHV in cell culture.These Defective-RNAs are formed by recombination events that occur between different portions of the FHV genome as illustrated in Figure 1 . Many of these result in large deletions of the RNA genome while others result in insertions or duplications (e.g. in R2D675, nucleotides 102-154 are duplicated and re-inserted near the 3' terminus). When these recombination events occur, a junction is generated with a novel nucleic acid sequence. From the FHV-RNAseq dataset, 15 single reads mapped to R1D1626, and 101 mapped to R2D675, all of whichmapped to junction sites that characterize the respective Defective-RNA. The locations of the mapped reads are illustrated in Figure 1 . As expected, no reads aligned to the portions of the Defective-RNAs that maintain a wild-type sequence as these reads were already aligned to the fully intact FHV Genome. However, not all junction events were detected, indicating that the precise character of the Defective-RNAs generated in our sample was different to that previously identified. The mapping of reads over junctions present in known Defective-RNAs is important to illustrate how individual RNA recombination events within the FHV genome can be detected.",

Interestingly, the locations of the striations are maintained regardless of the identity of the recombination partner; for example, the horizontal striation occurring between nt 710-730 in RNA 2 is present regardless of whether RNA 2 or RNA 1 provides the 3' strands. These striations may therefore indicate a sequence-dependent preference in the selection of recombination sites. It is interesting to note that some of these striations pass through locations of previously characterized Defective-RNAs as well as locations of high-frequency events detected here. The positions of the horizontal and vertical striations do not correlate (Pearson Coefficients are -0.0035 and -0.0019 for RNA 1 and RNA 2 recombinations respectively). This indicates that the sequence-dependent selection of 5' strands differs from that of 3' strands. However, no apparent nucleotide preference at either strand could be detected, other than a weak under-representation of guanines at the junction sites ( Figure  S1 ). Additionally, there was no average sequence identity detected between nucleotides upstream of the junction site in the 5' strand and nucleotides upstream of 3' strand, as has been reported for Defective-RNAs, for example, in dengue virus 16 . The selection of recombination sites may therefore have a more complex origin, for example, in the character of the local RNA secondary structure. 6 The positions in the heat map that correspond to mapping to the Defective-RNAillustrated in Figure 1 are shown in Figure 2B and C. The precise sites of the junctions corresponding to the previously identified Defective-RNAs are marked with blue cross-hairsand are relatively poorly represented (the reads indicated under the cross-hairs in the heat map are the same reads illustrated in Figure 1 ). However, we detected twohigh frequency junctions nearby that join nt 249-517, and nt 730-1,229 (8,544 and 1,080 mapped reads respectively -these can be seen in Figure 2B insetsf and g respectively) and are two highest frequency events detected within RNA 2.

This indicates that there is an over representation of a small number of unique recombination events. Heavy-tailed distributions can arise when events are initially randomly generated, but some selected events are favorably duplicated, 36 as has been observed for a number of replicable components of eukaryotic and prokaryotic genomes. 37 Such a scenario is what we would expect during the generation of Defective RNAs, which are initially generated by stochastic RNA recombination but are subsequently highly (sometimes competitively) replicated by viral RdRps. 12",

To address this, we designed a second pseudo-library of reference sequences that contained combinations of twopreviously detected recombination events that occurred within close proximity. As before, we designed this library to enforce the single reads to map with at least 20 nt on the 5' and 3' sides of the recombination events. Consequently, the maximum distance allowed between junction sites was 55 nt (95 nt from a single read minus two 20 nt 'seeds') and we allowed a minimum of 5 nt. This second pseudo-library contained 19'379'090 reference sequences ranging from 95 to 145 nt in length.From the 1,990,779 reads that remained unaligned ( Table 1) , we mapped an additional 80,374 reads to RNA 1 recombinations and 58 reads to RNA 2 recombinations.

The VLPs were generated by expressing the capsid protein (FHV RNA 2) from a baculoviral expression vector.In the absence of viral RNA replication, VLPs package host RNA and RNA transcripts from the baculoviral expression vector ( Table 1) ,which are transcribedby the host DNA-dependent RNA polymerases. We would not therefore expect any junctions to be present in the VLP-RNAseq dataset as a result of recombination during viral RNA replication. The VLP-RNAseq dataset was generated using the same procedure as for the FHV-RNAseq dataset.Consequently, by searching for junctions within the VLP-RNAseq dataset we can estimate the amount ofrecombinationthat has occurredduringPCR steps in the cDNA library preparationused for RNAseq, as is a recognized artifact. 38 From the VLP-RNAseq dataset, 82 reads mapped to RNA1-RNA1 junctions(note that RNA 1 was present in very small quantities due to a potential low-level persistent infection of Sf21 cells with FHV) and 2,168 reads mapped to RNA2 to RNA2 junctions (Figure 4 and Table 1 ). A prominent diagonal striation is visiblespanning theheatmap of RNA 2 to RNA 2 junctions.These events correspond to very short insertions and deletions. A histogram of the lengths of insertions and deletions that occurs due toeach recombination event ( Figure 5) shows that insertions and deletions 5 nucleotides or shorter (known as MicroInDels) areabundant in the VLP-RNAseq dataset as well as in the FHV-RNAseq dataset. This indicates that their formation was not unique to the FHV viral polymerase, but was most likely to have arisen during the amplification of the cDNA library used for sequencing. DNA polymerases are known to accrue MicroInDels and have been reported to be abundant in other NGS datasets Consequently, we exclude all MicroInDels when counting and comparing recombination events between the FHV-RNAseq and VLP-RNAseq datasets, as indicated in Table 1 . Excluding these MicroInDels, only 356 reads from VLP-RNAseq dataset mapped to recombination events in FHV RNA 2 (none were detected in FHV RNA 1).

They thus provide a suitable control against which to compare the FHV-RNAseq dataset. We detected 1,220 reads that mapped to recombination events occurring within these genes and between these genes (Table S1) thus giving a total of 1,576 artifactual recombination events per 4.19M mapped reads.

From this we can make an estimate of the average recombination frequency across the FHV genome ( Table 2) . Thiswill reflect both the frequency of individually generated recombination events as well as the replication of junctions that are found in the Defective-RNAs. However, the observed frequencies provided a metric with which to evaluate the amount of genetic variety in thevirus sample.As these frequencies are likely to be inflated at the extremities of each gene due to the low coverage of wild type reads in these regions (in particular at the 3' terminus) (Figure S2) , we also show the rates over just the ORFs of each gene.These values indicate that RNA recombination is an abundant source of mutagenesis and is comparable in magnitude to that of mismatch mutation ( Table 2) .",

The frequency of RNA recombination is known to vary widely between viral species, even among different positive-sense RNA virus, and could be assessed using NGS. The frequency of RNA recombination could also be compared between different preparations of the same virus, e.g. during the course of an infection, or when amplified in different host cells for viruses that have a broad host-range (e.g. dengue virus) or when viruses are exposed to antiviral therapies (e.g. ribavirin treatment for HCV). Additionally, it would also be possible to search for recombination between different viral species during co-infections. This would be important for understanding the role of RNA recombination in the evolution of new viruses.",

Finally, therapeutic applications could be envisioned as discovering the identity of DI-RNAs may allowfor their exploitation for treatment or prevention of acute viral infections. Such applications have been demonstrated, for example, in the form of deliverable vaccines 47 or through the transgenic expression of DI-RNA-like molecules. 48",
