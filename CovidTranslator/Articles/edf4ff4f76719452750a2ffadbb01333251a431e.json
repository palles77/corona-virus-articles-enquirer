While our regional health authority asked us to do our homework, a and while there were several lessons learned from the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) crisis, we were well aware that we had to test our own procedures for dealing with a pandemic. When we underwent the agreement procedure with Accreditation Canada in the spring of 2008, we became increasingly aware of the importance of preparing for a pandemic. The requisite organizational practices that enhance both patient safety and quality monitoring and improvement led us to re-appraise our emergency procedures. It also increased our ability to promote worker safety although our responsibilities to staff are clearly dictated by law.",

It was a real test for the Plan local de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 civile sociosanitaire -Mission sant\u00e9. Basic practices and additional precautions were stringently applied, particularly in waiting rooms. In the event of a suspected case of severe respiratory illness, we would institute additional precautions to prevent airborne transmission. Amazingly, nearly 200 employees agreed to do the fit test during the ensuing weekend. During this first weekend, we had two suspicious cases, one at each of our emergency rooms. Fortunately, the tests were negative. The following Monday, we decided to add another team in our local procedure in order to evaluate the process during the onset. So we examined the path of all the clinical and administrative process to gather evidence about our organization's quality and safety of care and services.",

At the same time, the WHO was aware that the virus was of low virulence. From that moment, we were instructed what to do and when.",

We provided all employees with specific training through e-learning and meetings. The most current information was available through the hospital's intranet web site 3 with a link to the provincial government's web site. 4 On the eve of the third weekend, we had our first confirmed case of H1N1, a teenager. A few days later, his best friend was also confirmed to have H1N1. However, this youngster had been a frequent visitor to a close relative who was an inpatient at our hospital. We were aware that \"contact follow-up should be intensified during the alert period and, if possible, at the onset of the pandemic while it can still be done\u2026it has not been recognized that quarantining contacts is an effective measure for preventing the spread of influenza once the outbreak is entrenched.\" 5 Again, we contacted staff and physicians during the weekend to provide them with post-exposure prophylactic antiviral medication. We also had to deal with anxiety of the staff who had been caring for that patient. Again, in order to respond adequately to psychosocial needs, communication is the key to success.
