Most of the time, the best-known cure for viruses is the innate immunological defense system of the host; otherwise, the initial prevention of viral infection is the only alternative. Therefore, diagnosis is the primary strategy toward the overarching goal of virus control and elimination. The introduction of a new class of nanoscale materials with multiple unique properties and functions has sparked a series of breakthrough applications. Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) are widely reported to guide an impressive resurgence in biomedical and diagnostic applications. Here, we review the applications of AuNPs in virus testing and detection. The developed AuNP-based detection techniques are reported for various groups of clinically relevant viruses with a special focus on the applied types of bio-AuNP hybrid structures, virus detection targets, and assay modalities and formats. We pay particular attention to highlighting the functional role and activity of each core Au nanostructure and the resultant detection improvements in terms of sensitivity, detection range, and time. In addition, we provide a general summary of the contributions of AuNPs to the mainstream methods of virus detection, technical measures, and recommendations required in guidance toward commercial in-field applications.",

            "text": "Viruses are remarkable pathogens that are causing prominently increasing morbidity and mortality worldwide. Their highly contagious nature and the absence of immediate and efficient control systems are the main reasons behind their potential health impacts. Currently, viral infections and associated diseases are major causes of death in mankind, and under the present context of industrialization and immigration, they continue to emerge at a rapid pace, causing significant human, social, and financial costs [1] . Additionally, gaps in currently applied detection systems potentially contribute to increasing the likelihood of international incidences and outbreak of viral infections [2] [3] [4] [5] . The implementation of highly sensitive and specific diagnostic tools has the potential to rapidly identify viral infections, initiate and guide judicious controls, and subsequently curtail their dissemination. Toward this endeavor and beyond the pitfalls of current immunological and molecular techniques commonly applied to virus detection, several new approaches based on nanoparticles (NPs) have recently been developed. AuNPs are widely described to be suitable for numerous biosensing functions and applications. Their unique photonic, electric, and catalytic properties, coupled with the molecular interaction specificity of various biomolecules (e.g., antibodies, single-stranded (ss) DNA, and RNA aptamers, among others), represent the design principles of a wide range of virus detection systems [6] [7] [8] . The advantages of being simple, rapid, and sensitive and facilitating quantitative detection with excellent multiplexing capabilities have greatly promoted these systems to be envisioned as state-of-the-art technologies for virus Ivyspring International Publisher detection [9, 10] . However, there are no available reviews of the applications of bio-AuNP hybrid structures for sensing and detecting viruses. In this article, we provide a current review of AuNP-based virus detection at the level of virus type, including the types and structures of the applied AuNPs. We highlight their role in enhancing sensory and detection performance in comparison with current techniques in terms of analytical sensitivity, detection range, and time. Furthermore, this review specifically summarizes detection designs, formats, functions, and contributions, which are of special importance to both scientific and applied research.",

The viral proteins are usually arranged in a surface layer called the capsid and sometimes in an outer envelope surrounding an inner core of nucleic acids. This core of viral nucleic acids can be single-or double-stranded (ds), DNA or RNA, one or several molecules, linear or circular in shape, and a few thousands of nucleotides to one million base pairs in size.",

            "text": "The nanoscale size and the relatively simple structure of viruses tend to impose technical difficulties in establishing wide-use and long-term systems for virus detection. The small size of viruses increases the difficulty of their isolation and visualization compared with other microbes, such as bacteria and fungi that can be readily examined using ordinary light microscopes. Only electron microscopy (EM) with a high-magnification power of ~100,000\u00d7 can allow the direct visualization of viruses and the study of their structures [14, 15] . Therefore, EM remains crucial for many purposes in virus research. However, EM is certainly inappropriate for routine clinical diagnosis because of the required time and cost, as well as many safety concerns. Furthermore, although the simple structure of virus particles allows the features of diagnostic relevance to be easily defined and tested, it presents limitations on the use of their characteristics for practical applications, especially with the increasing number of discovered viruses and recorded viral infections [14, 16, 17] . In addition, this structural simplicity confers viruses with rapid rates of spontaneous adaptation and evolution that may occur through direct genetic mutation, genetic substitution, or recombination. In this way, viruses not only outpace our attempts to develop sustainable control strategies but also raise more questions about the appropriateness and validity of current diagnostic techniques for long-term use [18, 19] .",

In the past, many outbreaks of viruses, such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), influenza virus (H5N1 and H1N1) and Zika virus, started as local events and then expanded to have global consequences. HIV was discovered in Central Africa as a new virus causing acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) three decades ago, and it now represents one of the most significant public health threats worldwide [20, 21] . The highly contagious respiratory virus SARS has fueled global fears of pandemics since its first appearance in China [22, 23] . In late 2012, the World Health Organization (WHO) raised a global alert for a new SARS-like respiratory coronavirus, which is now called Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) coronavirus. MERS is now classified as one of the most prominent viral threats to the Middle East and has caused hundreds of deaths and thousands of infections in a short time. Moreover, in the past few years, the world witnessed the worst Ebola outbreak ever that started to hit West Africa in early 2014 and the pandemic reemergence of Zika virus in 2016 [11, 12, 24] . With these evident possibilities of massive outbreaks and implications, the situation is rapidly growing more serious, and the demand for the development of rapid diagnostics and effective control strategies is becoming more urgent.",

For decades, these techniques represented the main tools for studying and investigating the biochemical and morphological properties of viruses that remain the main foundation of all known classification and detection systems. However, their practical use in virus detection has remained greatly debated due to several considerations, including laboratory equipment expenses and time and safety concerns [27, 28] . In the early 1980s, the field of diagnostic virology was boosted with two other major developments: 1) the birth of various immunoassays; and 2) the invention of polymerase chain reaction (PCR). This was followed by the development of a very wide range of serological and molecular detection techniques, which rapidly evolved to constitute the mainstream approaches of both laboratory research and the clinical diagnosis of viruses ( Fig. 1) [24, 29] .",

The main working principle of these techniques is the use of specific antibodies in conjugation with different signal reporting systems, such as red blood cells, enzymes, and radioactive or fluorescent materials [30, 31] .

The discovery of the genetic enzyme systems involved in the cellular machinery of nucleic acid replication and the stunning invention of an in vitro nucleic acid amplification system, commonly called PCR, by Mullis in the early 1980s, opened new frontiers in nucleic acid-based detection [33] . In addition, the known high specificity of nucleic acid hybridization and the absolute availability of its synthesis and modification guided the development of many Figure 1 . The onset of nanotechnology in virus detection applications compared with the development of the most common virus detection techniques. Cell culture and electron microscopy techniques that are now commonly applied in the direct testing for and detection of viruses were discovered in the mid-20th century [25] . Then, different serological and molecular techniques were developed. The serological detection of viruses with immunoassays was first reported in 1970: a radioimmunoassay was applied for the detection of the Australia antigen, later called hepatitis B virus surface antigen [218] . PCR was discovered in the 1980s and first reported in virus detection in 1988 for acquired immune deficiency syndrome detection [219] . Later, many molecular techniques, including amplification-and nonamplification-based techniques, were reported in virus detection. The concept of nanotechnology was envisioned as early as 1959 by the renowned physicist Richard Feynman [36] . However, nanotechnology was only applied to virus detection in 1997, when gold nanoparticles were employed for the detection of single-copy human papillomavirus [39] . Nanotechnology has recently come to represent one of the most outstanding trends in virus detection and diagnosis via the wide variety of assays described in this review. detection and genotyping techniques known for the rapid and specific detection of viruses. These techniques can be classified as amplification-or nonamplification-based molecular detection techniques. Amplification-based molecular techniques usually employ one or more forms of nucleic acid amplification to allow the indirect detection of the target virus. These techniques represent the majority of molecular techniques applied in virus detection and include various types of target amplification techniques (e.g., PCR, loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP), transcription-mediated amplification, and nucleic acid sequence-based amplification), signal amplification techniques (e.g., branched DNA and hybrid capture), and probe amplification techniques (e.g., ligase chain reaction and strand-displacement amplification). Nonamplification-based techniques are mainly applied to the direct testing for the presence of a specific virus in clinical samples (e.g., in situ hybridization, southern blot hybridization, and dot blot hybridization).",

In addition, these systems have eliminated the biosafety and time concerns usually associated with the clinical and academic study of viruses.

Subsequently, nanotechnology was realized via various types of new materials that rapidly emerged as promising tools for biological and chemical analyses. Nanomaterials are known to possess multiple unique optical, electronic, magnetic, and mechanical properties enabling very attractive applications, especially in the fields of biomedical imaging and clinical diagnosis [37, 38] . The first reported application of nanomaterials in the detection of viruses was attempted in the late 1990s: AuNPs were coupled with silver staining and applied for the detection of human papillomavirus in cervical carcinoma cells (Fig. l) [39] . Currently, there is a very wide range of nanomaterials, including metal NPs, carbon nanotubes, silica NPs, quantum dots (QDs), upconversion NPs, and polymeric NPs, that are being heavily investigated for virus detection [37, 38, 40] . One of the most common approaches for exploiting these nanostructures in virus detection is the development of nanobio hybrid systems that contain one or more biomolecules derived from viruses (e.g., DNA, RNA, antibody, pentabody, antigen, or peptide) conjugated to the surface of different NP forms. These systems leverage the significant labeling properties and signal transduction functions of NPs and the specific activity of the conjugated biomolecules to act as multivalent-NP probes [37, 38, 41] . Such virus-specific NP probes have surprisingly been used to build up various optical, fluorometric, electrochemical, and electrical assays that have been extensively reported for single and multiple detection modes ( Table 1 ). The results of most of these studies clearly demonstrate the inherent potential of these probes, along with numerous advantages over traditional approaches, in terms of size, performance, specificity, signal sensitivity, and stability. Additionally, these studies have extensively described their application to allow simple, rapid, highly sensitive and label-free detection.",

AuNPs can range from 1 to 800 nm in size and have different morphological shapes, including spheres, rods, prisms, tetrapods, dog bones, cubes, shells and several hollow structures [42, 43] . The synthesis of AuNPs can be performed using different methods such as chemical reduction of salts, ultraviolet irradiation, lithography, aerosol technologies, laser ablation, ultrasonic fields, photochemical reduction of Au, and biological synthesis [9, 32] . AuNPs possess a high surface density of free electrons that results in inherent optical, electrical, and catalytic properties. The excitation of AuNPs with light can cause these free surface electrons, i.e., \"plasmons,\" to oscillate to one side away from the atomic core, which remains as a positive charge on the other side, thereby creating a dipole or plasmon polariton [44, 45] . This dipole plasmon can change its direction in accordance with the frequency of incident light, and the resonance condition is reached when their frequency is approximately the same. This condition has been referred to as surface plasmon resonance (SPR). The most widely used AuNPs exhibit intense SPR bands that usually exist between 510-1100 nm and are known to be weakly dependent on the size of the AuNPs and the refractive index of the surrounding media but very sensitive to both the shape of the NPs and the interparticle distance [46] . The SPR of AuNPs has been observed to cause intense enhancing or quenching effects upon interactions with nearby photon emitters. These distance-dependent coupling effects are dipole-dipole interactions that usually include surface plasmon-mediated energy nanotransfer processes similar to fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) and may be either destructive (resulting in quenched emission) or constructive (resulting in enhanced emission). Compared to other types of nanomaterials, metal nanoparticles, particularly AuNPs, constitute ideal tools in virus detection for numerous reasons, including the ease of synthesis, characterization, and surface modification, outstanding stability, biocompatibility, and exceptionally high absorption coefficients [47, 48] . Furthermore, as labeling agents, AuNPs are easily visualized due to their intense colors and are known to form stable and highly active bioconjugates with common targeting biomolecules, such as DNA and proteins, thereby enabling highly sensitive and specific sensing and detection applications [48] .",

Resonance light-scattering-based detections usually involve measuring the amount of light scattered by different light spectroscopy techniques, including localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) [52] , Raman spectroscopy [49, 50] and dynamic light scattering (DLS) [51, 53] . The colorimetric detection of viruses using AuNPs usually relies on two main techniques: 1) a color amplification technique in which AuNPs are applied to act as direct coloring labels with their characteristic, intense red color [55, 58, 59, 66] ; and 2) color change technique in which a color change from red to purple occurs in response to particle aggregation. AuNP aggregation can be noncrosslinked aggregation caused by the target-triggered removal of stabilizing ligands from the surfaces of AuNPs [54, 56] or interparticle-crosslinked aggregation caused by the binding of ligands on modified AuNPs with target analytes [57, 67] . Analogous to FRET, AuNP-based fluorescence quenching is a distance-dependent process in which AuNPs act to reduce the radiative rate of fluorophores in their proximity. Thus, as efficient acceptors, AuNPs have been paired with dyeand QD-based fluorophores in different analyte-induced donor-acceptor crosslinking and coupling protocols [60-62, 64, 65] .",

AuNPs can indirectly perform electrochemical transduction functions based on their catalytic activity toward some chemical reduction reactions of metal ions (e.g., silver and copper) [72, 74, 75] or other species, such as H2O2 [76] [77] [78] . This potential to catalyze metal deposition is preferentially called NP-metal enhancement amplification, and it represents the basic function of multiple scanometric [50, 70, [79] [80] [81] [82] [83] [84] [85] [86] [87] [88] , photoelectric [89] , light-scattering [90] , and colorimetric schemes [91] for virus detection.

By coupling these bioimmobilization and signal transduction functions, AuNPs can achieve virus detection with highly improved analytical sensitivity and specificity. Furthermore, the direct increase in loading efficiency allows new possibilities of controlled multifunctionalization with different biomolecules. Based on this principle, developed AuNP tags are characterized by enhanced reactivity and stability. Increased loading efficiency also allows the design of new probes modified with multiple structures for biotargeting (e.g., antibodies and DNA), together with other signal amplification structures (e.g., enzymes and DNA oligonucleotides) [69, 76, 77, [96] [97] [98] , both types of which are stridently included in the development of new diagnostic schemes and designs. For example, the AuNP- Figure 2 . A generalized scheme for the basic characteristics and functions of AuNPs applied in virus detection. The size and metal nature of AuNPs are the key characteristics that enable them to directly transduce multiple types of signals, including optical, catalytic and electrical signals that can be detected by dynamic light scattering (DLS), localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR), surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS), ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) spectroscopy, fluorometry and other electrochemical analysis techniques. In addition, AuNPs act as nanoparticulate tags to enhance the signal detection of several analytical techniques, such as quartz crystal microbalance (QCM), atomic force microscopy (AFM), and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). Their large surface area-to-volume ratio is known to permit them to function as an excellent scaffold for bioimmobilization and target-probe interactions with highly enhanced specificity and sensitivity.",

Their genome is composed of three segments of negative-sense, ssRNA: a large segment (L, 6.3-12 kb) that encodes RNA polymerase, a medium segment (M, 3.5-6 kb) that encodes viral glycoprotein, and a small segment (S, 1-2.2 kb) that encodes nucleocapsid protein [100] .

Upon addition, the target DNA specifically forms dsDNA with the adsorbed ssDNA probes, which then easily detach, leaving the AuNPs to aggregate due to the salt. The particle aggregation causes the red color of the solution to change to blue, indicating the presence of target SARS nucleic acids; this change can be directly assessed by the naked eye or precisely quantified by ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) spectroscopy in correlation to the target DNA concentration (Fig. 5A ). In the electrochemical assay, AuNPs are applied to enhance the electrode conductivity and increase the surface area available for detection probe immobilization [72] . SARS-specific DNA-capturing probes are first immobilized on the surface of an electrode structured with AuNPs; then, they are allowed to hybridize with the biotinylated targets. Then, streptavidin-labeled alkaline phosphatase is applied to catalyze the indirect reduction and deposition of silver ions, which are eventually measured by anodic stripping voltammetry in correlation with the target DNA concentration (Fig.  5B) .",

This technique can allow the detection of target SARS nucleic acids with a sensitivity limit down to 100 fM; thus, it can be very beneficial for the early diagnosis of the SARS virus, which is critical for such a contagious pathogen. In addition, the simplicity and very high sensitivity of AuNP-based colorimetric assays for nucleic acids have promoted the application of AuNPs for the detection of other viruses either using slightly modified procedures or in combination with other sensing characteristics of AuNPs [56] .",

In the presence of the target DNA sequence, double-stranded (ds)DNA is formed and desorbs from the surface of citrate-reduced AuNPs, leaving them to aggregate.

The AuNP-modified electrode is modified with capture DNA probes that are allowed to hybridize with biotinylated targets.

Because a very large number of probes can be designed based on using different Raman tags, this assay can be readily adapted for multiplex detection, allowing the simultaneous detection of different diagnostic targets of the same virus or even completely different viruses. Furthermore, it does not require DNA amplification and eliminates the need for specific thermal cyclic equipment. In addition, the capability for bimodal detection simplifies evaluation of the results, as the output can be positive/negative either by traditional scanner systems or by SERS when the probes are labeled with Raman dyes. Such simplicity based on bimodal detection without the need for complicated thermal amplification equipment, multiplexing, and high sensitivity supports the application of this technique for EBOV, which is very contagious and usually necessitates the detection of several targets. It is a chip-based detection scheme in which the target DNA is captured by immobilized, specific DNA oligonucleotides and then directly labeled by AuNP-DNA probes, followed by silver enhancement. The AuNPs enhance the surface area available for silver deposition and DNA immobilization to achieve highly sensitive scanometric detection signals. Modification of the AuNP probes with Cy3 allows the additional SERS-based detection of target DNA. This scheme has been reported for the detection of a wide range of viral nucleic acids, including those of HCV, HBV, and HAV, which belong to different virus groups [50] . Furthermore, the scanometric detection reported in this scheme has been considered a universal step in other detection schemes described for other viruses, such as HEV [82] and HIV [81, 84] .",

In the AuNP-based QCM assay, the presence of target DNA initiates a layer-by-layer hybridization of the target DNA and several specific multivalent AuNP-DNA probes, resulting in significant mass changes detected by QCM [93] (Fig. 8A) . Whereas, in the ICP-MS-based assay, two types of probes prepared from specific AuNP-DNA and MNP-DNA conjugates are applied to specifically recognize and sandwich the target virus DNA sequences. The MNP probes then help to magnetically separate the formed sandwich complexes, and the target DNA concentration is indirectly estimated by detection of the Au concentration existing in the sample [94] (Fig. 8B) .",

The implementation of AuNPs extends the ability of QCM and ICP-MS to detect DNA. Moreover, AuNP-based ICP-MS is among the most sensitive molecular DNA assays applied for virus detection, with a detection limit down to 80 zmol, which can greatly help to control DENV and other viruses [94] . The bio-barcode ssDNA is released and employed to establish multilayered AuNPs over the electrodes to enhance the produced electric current [72] . (B) Dry-reagent strip-based DNA assay using AuNP-oligo (dT) reporters. AuNPs with poly (dT) are applied to label biotinylated target DNA modified with a poly (dA)-tail pre-captured by immobilized streptavidin in the test zone of the strip and generate characteristic red bands [55] . (C) Single-particle fluorometric detection of HCV using Cy3-tagged ssRNA that is electrostatically adsorbed or covalently coupled through thiol (SH) chemistry to the surface of AuNPs. The coupling of AuNPs and ssRNA probes brings Cy3 in the vicinity of the AuNP surface and eventually results in emission quenching; upon hybridization with the target RNA, the quenched emission is released [55] .

Currently, there are 170 million chronic carriers, and more than three million new infections occur globally each year [135, 136] . Chronic HCV infection is frequently associated with marked hepatic injuries, including cirrhosis, liver failure or hepatocellular carcinoma. These types of injuries can be very severe and often end in death or liver transplantation [135, 137] . HCV infection is generally resilient and usually requires treatment that combines numerous medications. The most popular treatment regimen for HCV is a combination of PEGylated interferon alfa (PEG-IFN\u03b1) and ribavirin (RBV) [138] . Other three-drug regimens based on the addition of the serine protease inhibitor telaprevir (TVR) or boceprevir (BEC) to the standard PEG-IFN\u03b1/RBV treatment have also been described [139] . In addition, several recently developed oral drugs, such as simeprevir and sofosbuvir, have been approved by the FDA for more effective care and shorter treatment duration [140] [141] [142] [143] . Despite these numerous drugs and due to the lack of efficient vaccines against HCV, reliable and sensitive detection methods are essential for viral infection prevention and therapeutic responses.",

            "text": "Numerous AuNP-based scanometric, fluorometric, electrochemical, and colorimetric assays have been reported for the molecular detection of HCV (Table 1 ). In these assays, AuNPs are utilized for different sensing functions: 1) AuNPs have been modified with poly(dT)-tailed DNA and directly applied to label target DNA sequences terminally modified with a poly(dA)-tail in a LFA assay to allow the colorimetric detection of HCV (Fig. 7B) [55] . 2) AuNPs electrostatically or covalently modified with Cy3-tagged ssRNA sequences have been applied for the fluorometric detection of target HCV sequences, in which the fluorophores are quenched in a process analogous to FRET. The presence of Cy3 in the vicinity of the surface of AuNPs eventually results in Cy3-emission quenching. Upon hybridization with target viral RNA, the electrostatically adsorbed probes labeled with Cy3 are detached from the surface of the particles, releasing the quenched fluorescence. The covalently bound probes form rigid dsRNA with a linear configuration, causing Cy3 to move away from the particle surface and release the quenched emission [60] (Fig. 7C) . 3) AuNPs have also been applied to enhance electrical conduction and catalyze a reduction reaction on the surface of detection electrodes. A specifically designed hairpin DNA probe terminally modified with AuNPs and bound to the surface of a glassy carbon electrode is utilized to detect the amplified viral RNA. The presence of target DNA results in the formation of rigid dsDNA, and the hairpin conformation consequently changes, moving the AuNPs away from the electrode surface, which eventually appears as a detectable decline in the current value in proportion to the target DNA concentration [78] . 4) AuNPs decorated with a specific nucleic acid probe were used for colorimetric detection of HCV. The assay is based on using cationic AuNPs to induce the aggregation of AuNPs probes. In the absence of HCV, the cationic AuNPs electrostatically bind to negatively charged AuNPs-DNA probes causing their aggregation and change of the solution color to blue. The presence of HCV nucleic acid protects the probes and prevents their aggregation by cationic AuNPs and the solution color remains red. This assay was specific and showed a sensitivity of 93.3% and a detection limit of 4.57 IU/\u03bcL [13] .",

The formation of such barcode DNA-guided AuNP multilayers significantly increases the detected electrical current and is utilized to quantitatively measure the target HCV antigen concentration in applied solutions. The results of this immunoassay indicate a detection limit of 1 pg/\u00b5L [69] . In a similar protocol, the barcoding DNA was further applied to HCV core antigen detection based on an enzyme to release the barcode DNAs to be quantified with RT-PCR.

The genus Orthohepadnavirus includes 4 species (HBV, woodchuck hepatitis virus, ground squirrel hepatitis virus, and woolly monkey HBV) that infect mammals, while the genus Avihepadnavirusincludes2 species (duck HBV and heron HBV) infect birds [144] . Hepadnaviruses are spherical, enveloped DNA viruses 40-48 nm in size. They possess a unique gapped genome of 3.2-kb circular dsDNA, which contains 4 partly overlapping ORFs encoding the different viral proteins: the core protein (C), e antigen, polymerase protein (Pol), envelope proteins, and transcriptional transactivator protein [144, 145] . The prototype member of the family Hepadnaviridae, HBV, is a health threat to ~88% of the global population [145, 146] . HBV is the etiological agent of hepatitis type B in humans. It is estimated that nearly 2 billion people around the world have been exposed to HBV infection, and there are more than 360 million chronic carriers suffering from the serious risk of developing liver cirrhosis and cancer [146, 147] . The availability of an effective protective vaccine against HBV has greatly reduced the number of new infections. In addition, there have been significant advances in the available treatments for chronic HBV infection. Viral DNA polymerase inhibitors and PEG-IFN\u03b1 are now well known to significantly control HBV infection and prevent its progression to chronic hepatitis B-associated liver failure and hepatocellular carcinoma [148, 149] . However, chronic HBV infections remain highly contagious, and the virus can easily be transmitted to other persons through any close contact allowing the transfer of infected bodily fluids. The highly contagious nature of HBV and its ability to spread among people are the main reasons why this pathogen continues to threaten the public. Therefore, diagnostic methods that are highly sensitive to low concentrations of virus are needed to curtail this virus and prevent its dissemination.",

Two enzyme-amplified electrochemical assays have been reported for the detection HBV surface antigen (HBsAg) using conjugates of AuNPs and horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-labeled antibodies against HBV surface antigen (HBsAbs) [76, 77] . The target HBsAg is captured and labeled with AuNP-HBsAb/HRP as secondary antibody conjugates. Then the reduction of H2O2 catalyzed by the bound HRP is measured either by using an AuNP/thionin/DNA-modified Au electrode coupled with a cyclic voltammeter [76] or through using a nanoporous Au electrode coupled with differential pulse voltammeter [77] (Fig. 9A) . Alizadeh et al. reported AuNPs modified with horseradish peroxidase mimicking DNAzyme to label HBsAg magnetically captured and concentrated on the surface of a Au sheet-like electrode. Due to the efficient catalytic activity of HRP-mimicking DNAzyme, the proposed immunoassay allowed quantitative detection of HBsAg with a linear concentration range of 0.3-1000 pg/mL and detection limit of 0.19 pg/mL [15] . Other studies described the electrochemical detection of HBV based on AuNP-metal enhancement amplification, including copper and silver metal enhancement [74, 75] . Using copper metal enhancement, HBsAg is sandwiched by MNP-HBsAb conjugates and AuNP-HBsAb probes to form a 3-component immunocomplex, which is magnetically separated and stained through a copper enhancement step (Fig. 9B ). After copper acidic dissolution, the resulting ions are measured by anodic stripping voltammetry (ASV) [75] . Using silver enhancement, HBV DNA is detected using probes prepared of streptavidin-modified AuNPs. Biotinylated HBsAg gene sequences are magnetically pre-separated and concentrated using magnetic bead-DNA conjugates. The deposited silver ions are then analyzed by an electrochemical stripping technique to detect the target HBV DNA quantitatively [74] .",

Following this protocol, AuNPs modified with staphylococcal protein A (SPA) [88] or specific DNA probes [50, 80] have been utilized in multiple chip-based assays to permit the detection of different HBV antibodies and DNA (Fig. 6 ). In addition, Wang et al. combined this AuNP-promoted silver-staining protocol integrated with a bio-barcode-amplification (BCA) technique to allow an enhanced scanometric detection of HBV DNA [85] . This BCA-based scanometric assay employs two different sets of DNA conjugates to capture and detect a specific HBV sequence. The first set is a group of AuNPs modified with the short dsDNA of a signal amplification DNA strand (barcode DNA) partially complemented with a detection probe strand, while the second set is a group of magnetic microparticles (MMPs) modified with ssDNA specific to the target HBV DNA. The presence of the complementary target sequences of DNA guides the assembly of AuNP/DNA/MMP sandwich hybrids. Subsequently, the sandwiched hybrids are magnetically isolated and washed, and the barcode DNA is eventually released from the AuNPs. The barcode DNA is then added to the surface of a chip modified with specific DNA-capturing probes and directly labeled with AuNP-DNA conjugates, followed by silver staining to further amplify the detection signal (Fig. 10) .",

Zheng et al. developed a multiplex detection system based on applying gold nanorods (AuNRs) as acceptors and QDs of different colors as donors to simultaneously detect HBsAg and HBV e antigen [62] . This assay follows the direct sandwich immunoassay format, and the presence of target antigens is manifested by the FRET-induced quenching of QD fluorescence in the formed sandwich nanostructure of AuNR-Ab1/Ag/QD-Ab2 (Fig. 9C ). Draz et al. further coupled multiple AuNP-peptide conjugateacceptors with single-core QD-antibody Fab conjugate-donors, forming a preassembled hybrid nanocluster plasmonic resonator complex for HBsAg and HBV particle detection (Fig. 9C) . This scheme follows a competitive assay format, and the addition of HBV target surface antigen or particles to the preassembled nanocluster releases the quenched fluorescence signal of the QDs in proportion to the In this assay, the target HBsAg is captured and labeled with AuNP-Ab/HRP, and the detection signal is measured by using an Ab-modified Au electrode to assess the reduction of H2O2 catalyzed by the bound HRP using differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) technique [76] . (B) Copper (Cu)-enhanced electrochemical immunoassay. AuNPs serve as a scaffold for a horseradish peroxidase (HRP) enzyme that catalyzes a redox reaction in the first scheme or enhances metal deposition in the second scheme [75] . (C) Fluorometric detection by the FRET-induced quenching of fluorophores on the surface of AuNPs. AuNPs and gold nanorods (AuNRs) are applied to quench the fluorescence of fluorophores, such as (i and ii) quantum dots (QDs) [62, 65] and (iii) fluorescein amidite (FAM) [61] , through a FRET-based interaction in the presence of the target virus. A similar AuNP FRET-based scheme has been reported for the detection of H1N1, which belongs to the family Orthomyxoviridae [63] . (D) Light-scattering assays using AuNP-antibody probes. (i) Light-scattering immunoassay of virus antigen based on using AuNPs with different sizes (10 nm and 50 nm) conjugated with antibodies (Abs) to sandwich target antigens and enhance the dynamic light scattering [51] . Additionally, this scheme has been reported with the use of AuNPs of the same size for H1N1 detection [53] .

The formation of these complex results in the FRET-based quenching of FAM fluorescence, and when complementary target DNA is present in the system, a FAM-ssDNA/cDNA duplex is formed. This DNA duplex is comparatively more negative than the FAM-ssDNA and can mediate stronger electrostatic interactions with AuNRs, leading to increased FRET efficiency, which manifests as a further decline in the fluorescence intensity of FAM.

HSV-1 is estimated to infect up to one-third of the world population, while HSV-2 infects nearly 500 million people around the globe, with more than 20 million new cases occurring every year [157] [158] [159] . Both HSV types are renowned for infecting epithelial cells of the skin or mucosal surfaces and then infecting the central nervous system, causing lifelong, incurable infections in humans. These infections are primarily asymptomatic but can progressively result in serious health complications. For example, HSV-1 infection is the main cause of infectious blindness in the world and has emerged as an important cause of genital disease in the developed world, and HSV-2 infection is the leading cause of genital ulcers worldwide [159, 160] . Nevertheless, these viruses are involved in many other clinical conditions, such as encephalitis, conjunctivitis, zosteriform skin lesions, pneumonia, and systemic infections that compromise vital organs in the body [161] . Therefore, desperate efforts have been directed toward developing an effective vaccine against HSVs. However, there are no protective vaccines against HSVs, and only a few anti-herpes drugs, such as acyclovir, valacyclovir, and famciclovir, are commercially available [162] [163] [164] . These drugs are only helpful to control symptoms and signs of infection and do not eradicate the virus or even decrease the frequency or severity of infection recurrence and due to the drug resistance rapidly developed by HSVs during treatment, the efficacy of anti-herpes drugs is increasingly hampered over time. Thus, the definitive diagnosis of HSV virus infection is essential for effectively controlling its severity and applying treatment regimens.",

HCMV can infect a broad range of cells, including endothelial cells, epithelial cells, smooth muscle cells, fibroblasts, neuronal cells, hepatocytes, and many types of immune cells [165, 166] . Nearly all HCMV infections are asymptomatic, except in immunocompromised individuals and neonates, and can lead to severe symptoms. HCMV infection is the leading cause of congenital malformations in live births worldwide, while in immunocompromised individuals HCMV is usually opportunistic, causing very serious clinical manifestations, such as pneumonia, hepatitis, encephalitis, colitis, and retinitis [167, 168] . Moreover, HCMV has been described to be associated with several human malignancies, especially in the brain, breast, prostate, skin and colon [169] . Numerous HCMV vaccine candidates have been developed and tested, but a vaccine has yet to be licensed. Antiviral therapy with several anti-HCMV drugs, such as ganciclovir, valganciclovir, foscarnet, and cidofovir, which target the viral DNA polymerase, is currently the main strategy for controlling HCMV infection [166, 170, 171] . Unfortunately, these drugs result in substantial hematotoxicity and nephrotoxicity in patients, and HCMV remains a considerable public health threat without an efficient treatment or control strategy. In such conditions, the need for new diagnostic methods that can help to control the dissemination of this pathogen is very important.",

Owing to the dramatically increasing rates of immunocompromised patients over the past two decades, the clinical significance of KSHV is clearly increasing; additionally, KSHV has a prevalence of 3-40% in this class of patients worldwide [173, 174] . While KSHV is a relatively newly discovered virus, there are no standard diagnostic approaches, and the detection of this virus through traditional serological and molecular methods remains challenging. This difficulty is mainly due to the inconsistency observed among serological assays targeting different antigens, and the low levels of viral DNA that are usually present in the peripheral blood of infected individuals [175, 176] .

Influenza is reported to affect up to 5% of adults and 20% of children of the global population each year [181, 182] . Over the past decade, the world witnessed two major influenza outbreaks caused by newly emerging InfluenzavirusA strains: H5N1 in 2003 (avian influenza), and H1N1 in 2009 (swine influenza). Both were severe enough to incite the WHO to issue a pandemic warning alert, which reached the highest level, i.e., \"phase 6,\" for H1N1 in 2009 [21, 183] . The severity of influenza infection depends on both the virus strain and the age of the infected person. In elderly persons, influenza can result in hospitalization or death, while in younger adults, influenza-associated morbidity usually results in restricted activity, impaired work performance, and increased health care use [184, 185] . Most people with the flu recover within one to two weeks without treatment. However, serious complications usually require medications to reduce the severity and duration of infection. Some antiviral drugs, such as oseltamivir and zanamivir, can effectively treat or prevent influenza [186] . On the other hand, immunization with vaccine preparations of the most-circulating virus strains (trivalent or quadrivalent vaccines) remains the key strategy for preventing both influenza and its serious complications [187, 188] . In fact, both the treatment and management of influenza infection, either by antivirals or vaccination, depend on the influenza virus strains and the timing and severity of the infection. Therefore, the rapid and accurate testing and typing of influenza is critical for treating infection and plays an important role in public health measures.",

In this assay, the virus is first captured on a lateral-flow test strip by pre-immobilized antibodies; then, AuNP-antibody conjugates are applied to label the captured virus particles. After washing, the AuNPs are collected and dissolved to release gold ions that are eventually utilized to quench the fluorescence of QDs in an additional, separate step [58] . In addition, Ganbold et al. have developed a bimodal assay for the fluorometric and SERS detection of viral RNA using AuNPs modified with ssDNA-dye probes [64] . The surface ssDNA-dye probes are weakly adsorbed to the surface of AuNPs by electrostatic interactions, and with the addition of the complementary target DNA, perfectly matched dsDNA forms and desorbs from the surface of AuNPs, resulting in measurable changes in the conjugated dye fluorescence and Raman fingerprint that are more substantial than those resulting from either mismatched dsDNA or ssDNA (Fig. 12A) .",

In the presence of virus particles, an immunocomplex forms and is separated by a magnetic field; after washing, AuNPs in the separated complex act to catalyze the oxidation of hydroquinone, which is detected optically in correlation with the AIV sample concentration [92] . 4) The fourth scheme relies on the peroxidase-like catalytic activity of Au NP films and colloidal AuNPs toward TMB-H2O2 mixtures. The virus is captured on a 96-well plate modified with AuNP film biofunctionalized with HA antibody. Then it is labeled with AuNPs modified with NA antibody for signal generation. TMB-H 2 O 2 is added, and rapid color changes are observed because of the oxidation of peroxidase substrate TMB. Using H1N1, the response of the developed assay was linear in the range from 10 pg/mL to 10 \u03bcg/mL and the limit of detection was 50.5 pg/mL, while with H3N2, the optical density of the developed color was dependent on the virus concentration in the range of 10-50,000 PFU/mL and the limit of detection was 24.3 PFU/mL [22] .",

Following this labeling step with AuNP probes, the presence of the target nucleic acids is visually determined with an additional silver-or gold-staining step. Specific DNA aptamers immobilized on a gold electrode (GE) modified with a layer of multiwall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs), polypyrrole nanowires (PPNWs) and AuNPs are collectively applied as an electrochemical platform for the detection of DNA hybridization using DPV [71] .

            "text": "Papillomaviridae is a widely diverse virus family that includes hundreds of recognized viruses classified into 16 taxonomically distinct genera designated with specific Greek alphabet letters, from alpha to pi. The first five genera (Alphapapillomavirus, Betapapillomavirus, Gammapapillomavirus, Mupapillomavirus and Nupapillomavirus) include the human papillomaviruses, while the remaining genera specifically include other mammalian and avian papillomaviruses [189, 190] . Papillomaviruses are spherical, nonenveloped DNA viruses 40-55 nm in size. Their genome consists of a single molecule of circular, supercoiled, dsDNA 5.3-8 kbp in size and encodes 6 early expressed (E) and 2 late (L) expressed proteins, in addition to a noncoding long control region [189, 191] . HPV infections are the most epidemic sexually transmitted viral infections worldwide [192, 193] . HPVs are highly epitheliotropic pathogens that usually infect the deepest layer of the skin or the genital surfaces. Most HPV infections cause no symptoms and usually self-clear without causing clinical problems, but persistent infections lead to serious clinical complications [194] . This persistence typically depends on the type of HPV causing the infection. Among more than 100 types of HPVs, approximately 40 types infect the mucous membranes and can be either high-or low-risk HPVs. High-risk types, such as HPVs 16, 18, 31, 51 and 52, are usually associated with many cancers of the cervix, vagina, vulva, penis, anus, neck, and head, as well as oropharyngeal cancer, while low-risk types, such as HPVs 6 and 11, are mainly related to anogenital warts and recurrent respiratory papillomatosis [195, 196] . Currently, HPV is considered the most important cancer-causing virus, as it is associated with ~4.8% of all human cancers [197] . Despite this high clinical significance of HPV, there are no available treatments, and vaccination using the bivalent vaccine against HPVs 16 and 18 or the quadrivalent vaccine against HPVs 6, 11, 16, and 18 remains the first and only choice for controlling the global HPV disease burden [198] [199] [200] . In fact, these vaccines are relatively expensive, and their efficacy is very restricted to specific HPV types. Therefore, the development of accurate diagnostic techniques for HPV detection and typing is essential for acquiring surveillance data and initiating appropriate vaccination programs.",

            "text": "AuNP-based assays have been developed for the molecular detection of HPV through different photoelectric, fluorometric, electric and colorimetric schemes [89, 98] . The photoelectric assay essentially leverages AuNPs to enhance the deposition of silver metal on their surfaces, as previously described for several other assays. However, the enhanced precipitation of silver metal in this assay is used to block the light generated from a photodiode array (PDA), and the target DNA concentration is measured in proportion to the decrease in light intensity as electrically detected using a bipolar integrated circuit PDA chip [89] . Specifically, PCR-amplified biotinylated target DNA is captured on the surface of the PDA chip, and then labeled with AuNP-biotin antibody conjugates; subsequently, a silver enhancement step decreases the light intensity, which is quantitatively translated into an electrical signal depending on the amount of target DNA (Fig. 13A) . On the other hand, a fluorometric assay integrating AuNPs and a microfluidic bead-based array has been developed as a rapid and controlled HPV DNA detection system [98] . In this assay, AuNPs dually functionalized with HRP enzyme and capture DNA strands are applied to label the target DNA captured on the surface of microbeads (Fig. 4A) , causing HRP to be in proximity to biotin-tyramine loaded on the surface of the microbeads and catalyze their oxidation by hydrogen peroxide. This process eventually increases the deposition of biotin moieties on the surface of the beads, subsequently increasing the labeling efficiency with QD-streptavidin conjugates and yielding an enhanced fluorescence signal that varies significantly based on the target DNA concentration (Fig. 13B) .",

Picornaviruses are spherical, relatively small (22-30 nm) , nonenveloped RNA viruses. Their genome is positive-sense ssRNA that is 7.0-9.5 kb in size and terminally bonded to a noncapsid viral protein (VPg) at its 5' end and to a polyadenylated tail at its 3' end. The expression of this genome produces a single large polyprotein that undergoes a cascade of cleavage and processing reactions to form 10-12 final structural (VP1-4) and nonstructural (2A-C and 3A-D) proteins [203] . Picornaviruses can infect a broad spectrum of hosts, including birds, humans, and other mammals [202, 204] . The genera Enterovirus, Hepatovirus, Parechovirus, Kobuvirus, and Cardiovirus include several important species that affect humans. Particularly, the genus Hepatovirus encompasses HAV, which is the most likely causal agent of acute viral hepatitis in humans. HAV infection is usually asymptomatic and self-limiting, and the related symptoms can be mild or sporadically progress to fulminant hepatic failure [205, 206] . The availability of an effective vaccine against HAV has substantially reduced the number of people who become infected with HAV [207, 208] . However, the ability of this virus to survive harsh environmental conditions and remain in seawater, fresh water, wastewater, and soil for extended periods increases the possibility of outbreaks, especially in developing countries where sanitation is not typically available [205] . The transmission of the virus usually occurs through the consumption of contaminated materials. As such, the virus does not replicate in the environment, water, or foods, and traces of viral contamination are difficult to identify, which remains a challenge for controlling HAV. The need for sensitive assays for HAV remains an urgent public health demand.",

Both assays rely on the extensively described virtue of AuNPs to enhance silver staining, thereby allowing the molecular detection of HAV DNA in a microarray chip format (Table 1 and Fig. 6 ). In the scanometric AuNPs modified with anti-biotin IgG are applied to label biotinylated target DNA captured on the PDA chip. After a silver enhancement step, the precipitated silver metal at the surfaces of the AuNPs blocks the light irradiated from above by light-emitting diodes (LEDs) and decreases the resulting photocurrent [89] . (B) Microfluidic bead-based enzyme-AuNP amplification method for the fluorometric detection of HPV. Streptavidin-coated beads are dually functionalized with biotin-electron-rich protein and biotin-DNA capture probes. The captured target DNA first reacts with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-functionalized AuNP-DNA labels, bringing HRP close to the surface of the microbeads. The oxidation of tyramine-biotin by hydrogen peroxide results in the deposition of multiple biotin moieties onto the surface of the beads. This deposition is markedly increased in the presence of immobilized electron-rich proteins. Streptavidin-labeled quantum dots (QDs) are then allowed to bind to the deposited biotin moieties and display amplified fluorescence signals in relation to the target DNA concentration [98] . detection scheme, AuNP-DNA conjugates are applied as specific detection probes to label target HAV RNA captured by specific VP1 probes on the surface of a microarray chip. A silver metal enhancement step is subsequently used for signal amplification, followed by the visual detection of nucleic acids [79] . In the SERS detection, the captured HAV DNA is labeled by AuNP-DNA probes loaded with the Raman reporter dye Cy3; this approach has been applied as previously described for EBOV and depicted in Fig. 6 of this review [50] . These assays are very simple and can detect target concentrations ranging from 3.37\u00d710 -7 -3.37\u00d710 -8 M, with 100 fM as a limit of detection, which can be superior to the relatively expensive PCR-based approaches currently used for HAV detection and management.",

Retroviruses are spherical, small (80-100 nm), enveloped RNA viruses. Their viral genome is typically bipartite and composed of two positive-sense ssRNA molecules (10 kb in total length). They comprise 4 major genes that encode the different structural and nonstructural proteins of the virus: gag encodes the large protein form matrix, capsid, and nucleocapsid; pro encodes the protease enzyme; pol encodes the reverse transcriptase and integrase enzymes; and env encodes the envelope glycoproteins and transmembrane proteins [209] [210] [211] . Retroviruses infect a wide variety of vertebrates, including humans. Their infection in humans is usually very serious and can potentially cause oncogenesis and variable hematopoietic and neurological conditions. Among retroviruses, HIV is a well-known, formidable human pathogen responsible for the most devastating viral pandemic that has ever occurred in human history [212] . HIV infection is usually correlated with the progression of what is clinically called AIDS, in which the immune system is harshly destroyed, and the entire body becomes vulnerable to terrible, life-threatening opportunistic infections and cancers. People with AIDS also suffer from other systemic symptoms, such as fevers, sweats, swollen glands, chills, weakness, and weight loss [213] . Currently, there is no effective vaccine against HIV, and most of the treatment strategies rely on using antiretroviral drugs, which in most cases maintain the viral load at low levels to prevent the formation of acute HIV infection rather than cure the virus [214] . Therefore, the accurate detection of HIV is a key determinant for monitoring HIV treatment and reducing its transmission and dissemination.",

            "text": "Currently, AuNPs have been extensively tested for the immunological and molecular detection of HIV through various scanometric, colorimetric, electrochemical, IPCR, and AFM assays ( Table 1) . The scanometric assays target the detection of the HIV p24 antigen and HIV nucleic acid using the silver metal enhancement protocol. For HIV p24, the target antigen is precaptured by magnetic particles [81] or isolated in a microplate [84] , followed by a silver enhancement step for the quantitative visual immunological detection of HIV (Fig. 4A, B and Fig.  6 ). For HIV nucleic acid detection, AuNP-DNA probes specific to the HIV pol gene are applied to detect HIV nucleic acids precaptured and isolated by magnetic particles, followed by a silver metal enhancement step (Fig. 14A) . The deposition of silver on the AuNP surface increases the NP size and scattering efficiency and additionally allows the target detection via DLS [90] . In AuNP-based colorimetric detection of HIV, the large surface area of AuNPs was exploited to amplify the detection signal by enhancing the gold metal staining on their surfaces, allowing naked-eye detection of HIV nucleic acids (HIV gag gene) in a lateral-flow format, similar to the scheme presented in Fig. 11A [91] . On the other hand, the ability of AuNPs to enhance electron transfer has been applied to develop an electrochemical assay for HIV detection (Fig. 14B) . In this electrochemical assay, the target HIV genome is detected in correlation with the change in electrical impedance of graphene sheets decorated with spherical AuNP-DNA probes specific to the HIV pol gene [73] . The developed AuNP-based RNA detection of HIV using the AuNP-LFA technique has a sensitivity limit of ~11 log10 copies/mL, while the best DNA detection can be achieved through the light-scattering scheme with a sensitivity limit of 10 fM. Furthermore, AFM coupled with AuNPs as nanoparticulate labels has been applied for the detection of HIV p24 as follows: the target antigen is precaptured on the surface of a nanoarray specifically coated with anti-p24 and labeled with AuNP-antibody conjugates that significantly changes the surface topography of the array, allowing the detection of p24 (Fig. 14C) [95] .",

            "text": "AuNPs have made a tremendous impact in the detection of viruses, as demonstrated by the numerous assays for most of the clinically relevant groups of human viruses (Fig. 3) . Coupled with different biomolecules, AuNPs have enabled the development of a completely new class of probes that are specifically composed of a AuNP core (spherical or rod-like in shape) for signal readout and a surface layer of one or multiple types of biomolecules for target recognition and interaction. These probes have mostly been incorporated as a new set of functional and highly interactive components in different traditional techniques (e.g., EIAs and PCR) and have derived substantial improvements in design, detection performance, sensitivity, specificity and stability. This created a new trend in applying AuNPs to overcome the limitations of traditional techniques. AuNP-based immunological and serological detection methods are the most common and have been accomplished through multiple scanometric, colorimetric, DLS, immuno-PCR, electrochemical, electrical, SERS, LSPR, fluorometric, and AFM-based approaches (Table 1) . AuNP-based DLS and LSPR assays are especially novel, simple and among the most sensitive reported assays for the immunodetection of viruses with a detection limit that is hundreds of times lower than that of the standard ELISA technique [51, 52] . In contrast, the developed AuNP-based molecular assays are not as sensitive as the conventional PCR technique or other PCR-based molecular techniques. However, the addition of AuNPs greatly simplifies the detection procedures of viral nucleic acids, and largely eliminates the need for complex procedures and expensive thermal cycling machines, which greatly reduces the detection time and total cost. In particular, colorimetric assays based on the intense red color of AuNPs represent an interesting qualitative shift in nucleic acid detection due to the complete elimination Magnetic NP (MNP)-DNA probes scavenge target HIV sequences, which are then magnetically collected and labeled with AuNP-DNA probes. After repetitive washing, AuNPs are released into solution by a dehybridization step and subjected to silver metal enhancement, resulting in particle growth and increased scattering [90] . (B) Electrochemical impedance assay of HIV RNA. Graphene oxide sheets decorated with AuNPs are applied for the immobilization of DNA detection probes. Hybridization with specific DNA sequence results in increased impedance [73] . (C) Atomic force microscopy (AFM)-based immunoassay of HIV. AuNP-antibody probes form a three-component sandwich immunocomplex with the target virus antigen captured on the surface of a specific antibody nanoarray; eventually, the increase in the surface height of the array is detected by AFM [95] .",

For bioanalytic and diagnostic applications, AuNPs exhibiting homogeneous morphological and fine structural characteristics are important specifically for effective and accurate response to target detection. Therefore, many pre-analytical factors related to NP synthesis and surface modification are critical to the development of an efficient virus detection assay.",

Although these techniques are generally simple and fast and can support the large-scale production of AuNPs, the synthesis of uniform AuNPs with a discrete size and shape remains challenging [215] . Recently, some approaches have been reported for the controlled synthesis and modification of AuNPs. However, these methods remain unsuitable either due to the protocol complexity or difficulty of particle separation, which might require additional steps or specific surface modifications. Therefore, the development of more stringent and advanced methods for the facile and controlled synthesis of uniform AuNPs with the option of performing multiple surface modifications is strongly recommended.",

For instance, small AuNPs are preferred in colorimetric and light scattering-based assays due to their SPR band sensitivity. In contrast, large AuNPs are preferentially employed in assays such as BCA, immuno-PCR, and enzymatic-based electrochemical detection techniques, which rely on the surface functionalization of AuNPs with targeting or signaling biomolecules. Additionally, a large NP size is highly desirable in assays that depend on AuNPs as metal labels, such as electrochemical stripping, QCM, and ICP-MS detection methods. In addition, spherical AuNPs are more commonly applied than rod-shaped NPs. However, the latter exclusively enable a very interesting class of LSPR-based detection methods that have shown an unprecedented detection sensitivity range.",

Unfortunately, most biomolecules have been reported to be very sensitive to harsh chemical modifications that can adversely affect their reactivity and specificity. Thus, the type of targeting biomolecule and the surface conjugation reaction method applied are crucial and require optimization. Short oligonucleotides and other DNA sequences are physically rigid and more stable than protein biotargeting structures, including antibodies, which usually have several secondary and tertiary conformations that are important for their full, specific interaction with a target molecule. Furthermore, the full reactivity of surface biomolecules via a suitable conjugation reaction is critical and should be retained and confirmed with additional assessment steps before use in virus detection. While the application of traditional conjugation techniques, such as electrostatic adsorption, is still widely reported, it is strongly recommended to be avoided due to the incident loss of conjugated biomolecule activity and large inequality in loading efficiency, which directly result in decreased assay sensitivity and reproducibility [216] . In this regard, AuNPs have an enhanced surface area-to-volume ratio that greatly improves the efficacy of current conjugation techniques, and several directional and controlled conjugation methods based on covalent and noncovalent interactions have been thoroughly described in the literature [9, 32, 35] .",

The long-term stability of AuNPs is reported and well investigated in numerous studies. However, their conjugates to different biomolecules (i.e., DNA, RNA, antibody, enzymes) are sensitive to storage time and conditions and the reusability of these conjugates is usually hampered by the loss of activity of surface molecules and irreversible aggregations. It was demonstrated that exposure to elevated temperatures, high salt concentrations, and reducing agents such as dithiothreitol (DTT), mercaptoethanol, and glutathione (commonly existing in biological fluids) results in the loss of stability and activity of AuNP-conjugates [9, 41, 43] . Thus, the development of new chemistries and novel conjugation strategies for the synthesis of stable AuNP-conjugates becomes very crucial for practical use of AuNPs in virus detection.",

The clinical significance, prevalence, and infectivity of viruses are important factors affecting the number of specific detection schemes developed. For instance, HBV is the most reported and investigated virus among studies focusing on the utilization of AuNPs for virus detection, which might be in part due to its highly contagious nature and global prevalence[65]. HIV, IAV and HPV are also among the most widely reported viruses. The data analysis is based on a related-terms search of www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed.DENV: dengue virus; EBOV: Ebola virus; HAV: hepatitis A virus; HBV: hepatitis B virus; HCMV: human cytomegalovirus; HCV: hepatitis C virus; HEV: hepatitis E virus; HIV: human immunodeficiency virus; HPV: human papilloma virus; HSV: herpes simplex virus; HTNV: Hantaan virus; KSHV: Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus; RVFV: Rift Valley fever virus; SARS: severe acute respiratory syndrome; WNV: West Nile virus.",

(A) Immuno-PCR assay for HTNV detection using AuNP probes dually functionalized with antibody (Ab) and double-stranded (ds)DNA. Au-nanoprobes are directly applied to label virus antigens precaptured on a microplate. The AuNPs are carrying dsDNA that includes barcode single-stranded (ss) DNA for signal amplification. The barcode DNA is separated, amplified and detected by gel electrophoresis [96]. Additionally, this assay can be modified in a more complex detection scheme that has been reported for human immunodeficiency virus detection [81]. (B) Surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS)-based assay for detection of RVFV using Raman reporter dye-coated AuNPs and magnetic NPs (MNPs). AuNPs and MNPs are conjugated with a polyclonal Ab specific for the target virus antigen forming AuNP/virus antigen/MNP complexes; then, a 785 nm laser excites the magnetically concentrated AuNP/virus antigen/MNP complexes. The presence of the target antigen yields a reduction in the intensification of Raman dye signature spectrum peaks, thereby providing an estimation of its concentration [49]. This assay has been applied for the detection of WNV infection [49].",
