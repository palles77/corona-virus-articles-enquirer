Emerging data indicate that phase II antioxidant enzyme pathways could play a role in virusassociated inflammation and immune clearance. While Nrf2-dependent gene expression is known to modify inflammation, a mechanistic role in viral susceptibility and clearance has yet to be elucidated. Therefore, we utilized differentiated human nasal epithelial cells (NEC) and an enzymatic virus-like particle entry assay, to examine the role Nrf2-dependent gene expression has on viral entry and replication. Herein, lentiviral vectors that express Nrf2-specific short hairpin (sh)-RNA effectively decreased both Nrf2 mRNA and Nrf2 protein expression in transduced human NEC from healthy volunteers. Nrf2 knockdown correlated with a significant increase in influenza virus entry and replication. Conversely, supplementation with the potent Nrf2 activators sulforaphane (SFN) and epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) significantly decreased viral entry and replication. The suppressive effects of EGCG on viral replication were abolished in cells with knocked-down Nrf2 expression, suggesting a causal relationship between the EGCG-induced activation of Nrf2 and the ability to protect against viral infection. Interestingly, the induction of Nrf2 via nutritional supplements SFN and EGCG increased antiviral mediators/responses: RIG-I, IFN-\u03b2, and MxA at baseline in the absence of infection. Our data indicate that there is an inverse relationship between the levels of Nrf2 expression and the viral entry/ replication. We also demonstrate that supplementation with Nrf2-activating antioxidants inhibits viral replication in human NEC, which may prove to be an attractive therapeutic intervention. Taken together, these data indicate potential mechanisms by which Nrf2-dependent gene expression regulates susceptibility to influenza in human epithelial cells.",

In the United States alone, over 20,000 people die and over 100,000 individuals are hospitalized every year due to influenza virus-related diseases [1] [2] [3] . Influenza viruses cause annual epidemics and recurring pandemics with potentially severe consequences for global public health. Despite large-scale efforts in vaccination and antiviral therapies, the morbidity and mortality associated with influenza infections have not significantly changed in recent years [2] [3] [4] .The latest influenza pandemic was caused by the 2009 H1N1 virus and has thus far resulted in 42-86 million cases worldwide [5] . Epidemiologic studies show that high-risk groups including infants, elderly, and immune compromised individuals are more susceptible to influenza virus infections [6, 7] . In the context of potentially pandemic respiratory viral infections, it is important to identify and protect susceptible subpopulations through identification of molecular targets/pathways for therapeutic intervention. Despite the large volumes of published data implicating age [1, 7] , preexisting diseases [8] , nutritional deficiencies [9] [10] [11] , and an impaired innate immune response [12] [13] [14] in influencing susceptibility to infection, the mechanism(s) for viral susceptibility are very complex and have yet to be elucidated.",

Oxidative stress is caused by an imbalance between the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the body's ability to readily detoxify the reactive intermediates. Enzymes including phase II antioxidants, such as hemeoxygenase 1 (HO-1), are regulated by the transcription factor NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2). The induction of these antioxidant enzymes can prevent or slow oxidative damage to cells. Emerging data indicate that Nrf2 plays an important role in the development of cancer, chronic lung diseases, and defense against oxidants, as well as host defense against respiratory viral infections [20] [21] [22] . Although it has been shown that oxidative stress increases the severity of viral infections, the exact mechanism as to how and why this happens and the role of Nrf2 in these responses are not fully understood.",

            "text": "Since airway epithelial cells are a major source of antioxidant enzyme production and the primary targets for influenza virus infection and replication, it is important to determine the role of cellular antioxidants in viral pathogenesis. On infection, epithelial cells respond by producing numerous cytokines, immunoregulatory molecules, and antiviral mediators, all components of the host innate immune response. One of the principal mediators of this response is type I interferons (IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b2), which are secreted from virusinfected cells [23, 24] and are required to induce the synthesis and/or activity of mediators involved in turning off viral replication within the host cell. Although IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 act in an autocrine fashion to inhibit viral replication within the infected cell, it primarily functions in a paracrine mode by protecting neighboring cells that are not yet infected. The most potent stimuli for type I IFN synthesis are signals derived from a viral infection, specifically the recognition of doublestranded RNA that is produced by viruses during their replication process [25] . Another hallmark of influenza virus, is its sensitivity to the inhibitory effects of IFN-inducible MxGTPases (MxA), which significantly abrogates viral replication [26] . However, the role of Nrf2-dependent antioxidants in the modulation of the interferon/ antiviral response in epithelial cells has not been studied.",

We show that Nrf2-specific shRNA effectively decreased both Nrf2 mRNA and Nrf2 protein expression in these cells, which correlated with significantly increased viral entry and replication in transduced human NECs. Importantly, we directly show an inverse relationship between levels of Nrf2 expression and susceptibility to viral infection. Interestingly, we demonstrate that enhancing Nrf2 expression via supplementation with sulforaphane (SFN) and epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) increased antiviral mediators in the absence of viral infection and also abrogated viral entry. Taken together, our data are consistent with the conclusion that Nrf2-dependent gene expression is an important modifier of susceptibility to influenza.",

To determine the role Nrf2 plays in susceptibility to influenza, we utilized a lentiviral vector that expressed Nrf2-specific shRNA (LV-Nrf2) to effectively decrease both Nrf2 mRNA and Nrf2 protein expression in transduced human differentiated NECs from healthy volunteers, while a separate vector expressing a scrambled nonspecific sequence was used as a negative control. To determine the ability of the lentivirus to transduce differentiated NECs, we infected at a multiplicity of infection of 10 and analyzed the cells for the presence of GFP expression (encoded by the same transcript as the shRNA) 48 h postinfection (Fig. 1A) . Efficiency of the lentivirus to knock down Nrf2 gene expression was measured by isolating total RNA from transduced cells and utilizing real-time RT-PCR to quantitate Nrf2 mRNA transcripts normalized to cellular \u03b2-actin expression. Nrf2 mRNA expression was significantly knocked down by lentivirus LV-Nrf2 as compared to the control lentivirus (LV-scramble) (Fig. 1B) . Western blot analysis further confirmed that the expression of Nrf2 protein as well as HO-1, an Nrf2-dependent gene, was reduced, which correlated with the Nrf2 mRNA suppression (Fig. 1C) .",

Both compounds have the ability to induce Nrf2 gene expression. Based on initial dosing studies, we determined that a concentration of 1 and 10 \u03bcM is sufficient to detect effects of SFN and EGCG on Nrf2dependent gene expression in NECs in vitro with 10 \u03bcM causing cytotoxicity (data not shown). Therefore, NECs were treated with 1 \u03bcM of either SFN or EGCG 3 h prior to infection with influenza virus. To explore the effects of these antioxidant compounds on viral replication, total RNA was isolated and resulting cDNAs were quantified by RT-PCR to measure the levels of influenza HA transcripts present. As shown in Fig. 3A , both SFN and EGCG inhibit viral replication as marked by decreased HA gene expression. We again collected apical washes to perform viral titer assays. Our results show that EGCG significantly reduced viral replication, while SFN had minimal affects (Fig. 3B) .Western blots revealed that the addition of SFN and EGCG did increase the protein levels of Nrf2 and HO-1, with EGCG enhancing Nrf2 expression (approximately 3fold) as compared to the vehicle (Fig. 3C) . Taken together, these results indicate that induction of Nrf2 via antioxidant supplementation suppresses influenza virus replication in NECs. To determine whether the effects of EGCG on replication are indeed mediated by Nrf2, we performed experiments whereby NECs were transduced with either LV-Nrf2 or LV-scramble prior to treatment with EGCG. Fig. 4 shows that there is an Nrf2-dependent effect. The suppressive effects of EGCG on viral replication were eliminated in cells with knocked-down Nrf2 expression, suggesting a causal relationship between the EGCG-induced activation of Nrf2 and the ability to protect against viral replication.

Numerous host-cell-dependent factors can affect and control influenza virus attachment and uptake by: (i) proteolytic cleavage of viral HA by host cell-derived serine proteases, (ii) host cell-derived innate immune defense molecules aimed at binding and neutralizing the infectious virions, and (iii) antiviral mediators limiting viral replication and shedding of virus particles. Modification of any or several of these factors by altering expression of Nrf2 could affect susceptibility to infection. Our results demonstrate that increased Nrf2 activity significantly reduces the expression of the viral HA gene as well as influenza virus titers (Fig. 3) . To dissect specific points in the virus life cycle that could determine the role Nrf2 gene expression plays in viral susceptibility and/or viral replication, which ultimately dictates viral pathogenesis and outcome, we developed an enzymatic virus-like particle assay that was adapted from previous studies using VLPs to study HIV and Ebola virus entry [39, 44, 45] . Our data demonstrate that both genetic and pharmacological manipulation of Nrf2 expression significantly affects influenza virus entry (Fig. 6 ).

Based on previous reports, we hypothesize that increased viral entry and subsequent replication seen in cells with reduced Nrf2 expression/ activity are mediated through the activation of host cellular transmembrane proteases. As indicated above, regulated proteolysis is required for the spread/propagation of many human viruses, including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), Nipah, Ebola, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), metapneumoviruses, and influenza [46] [47] [48] [49] [50] . Previous studies have demonstrated the importance of protease-specific cellular proteases/antiproteases involved in influenza infection, which include transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2), human airway trypsin-like protease (HAT), and secretory leukocyte proteinase inhibitor (SLIP) [51, 52] . The expression of these proteases in the lung is necessary for cleavage of the viral HA surface protein, thus allowing viral fusion and entry into the host cell. Studies have shown a correlation between inflammation and oxidative stress which leads to altered expression of these proteases/antiproteases. Specifically, HAT has been shown to be released into the airway fluids under inflammatory conditions, particularly in asthmatics [53, 54] , and a murine study showed that SLPI gene expression was increased in Nrf2-deficient mice which led to increased inflammation and demonstrated a balance between oxidative stress and protease expression [52] . These studies combined with our data presented here lead us to hypothesize that oxidative stress, which is propagated via decreased Nrf2 gene expression, causes an increase in serine protease activity, culminating in increased efficiency of HA cleavage and thus increased viron entry, which we demonstrated in Fig. 6 .",

            "text": "Interestingly, our results demonstrate that supplementation with SFN and to a greater extent EGCG not only increased Nrf2 protein levels but also induced the expression of three well-characterized antiviral response genes which include RIG-I, IFN-\u03b2, and MxA (Fig. 5) . It is noteworthy that the increased expression of these antiviral genes was induced via supplementation with EGCG in the absence of a viral infection. It is known that infection and replication of viruses result in the accumulation of intracellular ssRNA and dsRNA in the host cell, which triggers multiple host response mechanisms, including the expression of type I INFs, MxA, and RIG-I. Viral infections normally induce the production of type I IFNs, which in turn activate the synthesis of numerous interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs). ISGs collectively induce an \"antiviral state\" in the host cell itself as well as the neighboring cells, thus limiting viral replication in these cells. One of these ISGs is MxA, which belongs to a small family of GTPases that have been shown to inhibit viral replication. MxA has also displayed antiviral activity toward influenza A virus [55] . Another IFN-inducible gene is RIG-I, which is a cytosolic DExD/H boxcontaining RNA helicase that interacts with dsRNA and augments interferon production in response to a viral infection [56, 57] . We demonstrate that treatment with EGCG, in the absence of a viral infection, increased the mRNA expression levels of RIG-I, which appear to be in contrast to a recent study which showed that EGCG suppresses Rig-I signaling [58] . This study identified, in a small molecule screen, that EGCG binds to RIG-I and reported that at certain concentrations EGCG efficiently binds to RIG-I and, while not interfering with RIG-I's ability to bind RNA, does suppresses RIG-I signaling. However, these studies were performed in the HEK293T cell line, which could contribute to the somewhat conflicting results. Based on our observations, we hypothesize that EGCG up-regulates the expression of these antiviral genes which proactively protects the cells prior to viral infection by inducing and \"antiviral protective state.\" It is possible that IFN-\u03b2, RIG-I, and MxA genes may contain an Nrf2 binding site in their promoter regions, and the induction of Nrf2 would thus increase the transcription of these antiviral genes. However, at least to our knowledge, essential Nrf2 binding sites have not been identified in promoters of any of the genes listed above and studies examining gene expression profiling of Nrf2 in mice did not report differences in the antiviral or interferon responsive genes [40, 59] . It is conceivable that the effects of SFN and EGCG on IFN-\u03b2, RIG-I, and MxA expression are Nrf2 independent or that the effects are species and/or cell-type specific. SFN and EGCG have been shown to have potent antioxidant capacities, in part by inducing the expression of a number of antioxidant enzymes [60] . In vitro and in vivo studies have shown that these supplements potently induce the expression of phase II antioxidant genes, which was associated with Nrf2-electrophile response element (EpRE) signaling [37, [61] [62] [63] . The mechanism of activation for Nrf2 induction involves serine/threonine phosphorylation, leading to increased nuclear accumulation and binding to the EpRE [64] . Whether and how activation of Nrf2-dependent gene expression is involved in its potential antiviral effects are not known. Our data show that EGCG and to a lesser extent SFN modifies influenza replication in human respiratory epithelial cells at 1 \u03bcM concentration and that the effects of EGCG on viral replication are abolished in cells with knocked-down Nrf2 expression (Fig. 2) . It is likely that higher concentrations of SFN would yield significant effects on viral replication. These observations are similar to previous mouse in vivo studies showing that supplementation with SFN only reduced RSV infection in Nrf2 +/+ mice but not Nrf2 \u2212/\u2212 mice [17] . Previous studies have indicated that EGCG directly binds influenza virus and therefore prevents attachment and entry into host cells [65, 66] . However, these studies were conducted in MDCK cells, which are not a natural host cell for influenza and require addition of exogenous proteases to achieve viral entry [65] . Our data demonstrate that supplementation of differentiated NECs with either SFN or EGCG from the basolateral side (to eliminate direct interaction with the virus during infection) significantly decreases influenza virus entry and replication and that these effects were dependent on Nrf2 (Fig. 4) .",

It has been reported that Nrf2 protects the lung against oxidative stress [20, 40] , and recent data describe functional polymorphisms within the Nrf2 gene in humans [67] . Nrf2 has been identified as a susceptibility gene that increases the risk of acute lung injury, and other reports have also identified a role for Nrf2 in pulmonary diseases associated with oxidative stress, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and asthma [68, 69] . Viral infections have been shown to exacerbate these diseases. Understanding how Nrf2 orchestrates cellular defense mechanisms may provide insight to the development of novel interventions and preventative strategies targeted against oxidative airway diseases. Investigating antioxidant supplementation treatment along with potential inhibitors of influenza-activating type II transmembrane serine proteases (TTSPs) could be important additions to the current antiviral therapy which includes targeting neuraminidase and the ion channel M2. Influenza infection remains a major global public health concern, and understanding the mechanisms that modulate susceptibility to influenza infection can have vast impacts on morbidity, mortality, and ultimately infection outcome.",

Our work demonstrates that activation of the Nrf2-dependent gene expression prior to influenza abrogates viral entry and replication. We also found that the transcription factor Nrf2 plays a critical role in dictating susceptibility to viral infection at the level of the epithelium. We have shown that nutritional supplementation, with SFN or EGCG, not only increases Nrf2 levels but also increases the expression of multiple antiviral mediators in the absence of a viral infection. We hypothesize that induction of these antiviral mediators in turn initiates an \"antiviral state\" priming the cells against a viral infection, thus limiting virus entry and replication. Previous studies have demonstrated that in humans orally administered SFN at doses of 200 \u03bcmol yields peak plasma levels reaching about 2 \u03bcmol/L [70] . Similarly, previous studies determining the pharmacokinetics of EGCG in humans reported that a single dose of 1.5 mmol orally administered EGCG achieved peak plasma concentrations averaging 1.3 \u03bcmol/L [71] . Thus, levels of SFN and EGCG shown here to have antiviral effects are clinically feasible. Further studies aimed at using orally administered SFN or EGCG may provide greater insights into potential novel antiviral therapeutic interventions.",
