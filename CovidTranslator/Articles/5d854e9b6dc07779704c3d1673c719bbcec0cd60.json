The North-South Economic Corridor is currently in its second phase of development, with investment opportunities to be laid out in the NSEC Strategy and Action Plan (SAP). It targets the ecologically and culturally sensitive border area between PR China's Yunnan Province, Northern Lao PDR, and Thailand. A trans-boundary, cross-sectoral Strategic Environmental Assessment was conducted to support the respective governments in assessing potential environmental and social impacts, developing alternatives and mitigation options, and feeding the findings back into the SAP writing process. Given the spatial dimension of corridor development-both with regard to opportunities and risks-particular emphasis was put in the application of spatial modelling tools to help geographically locate and quantify impacts as a means to guide interventions and set priorities.",

Land use type specific conversion tables were developed for each individual land cover dataset in consultation with national stakeholders and international experts. Each land demand scenario was run once with protected areas as spatial restrictions (no conversion allowed in these areas), and once without simulating a lack of law enforcement which remains a challenge in some remote areas of the NSEC. Present land use distribution was tested for correlation with a set of underlying \"explaining\" factors: elevation, slope, aspect, distance to stream, distance to main road, distance to minor road, population density, and distance to settlement.

Without Fig. 2 . Estimating land conversion in Xishuangbanna, Yunnan/PRC based on a \"business as usual\" (economically optimized) scenario (focus on conversion to rubber at the same rate as observed over the past 10 years). Present land cover on the left side and land cover in 2023 on the right side. Modelled without protected areas as restrictions to simulate impacts of lack of proper law enforcement. appropriate law enforcement, land conversion will also encroach into protected areas, particularly if close to infrastructure developments (e.g. Nabanhe and Mangao in Xishuangbanna; Mae Paem, Doi Luang and Tham Pathai in Thailand). Besides environmental concerns, emphasis on commercial plantations such as rubber in Xishuangbanna (particularly around Mengla, Fig. 2 ) threatens food security (agricultural land conversion) and economic vulnerability (market price fluctuations). The Lao section of the NSEC might face the same threat as Chinese investors are increasingly \"outsourcing\" rubber plantations into Northern Laos. Compared to the \"business as usual\" scenarios, the more benign \"environmentally sound\" scenario puts considerably less conversion pressure on high value ecosystems, mostly by combining the potential of agricultural intensification (lower land demand) with focus on conversion of secondary forests over pristine forests. In Thailand, the pressure on pristine forests is reduced so significantly that even in case of lack of efficient law enforcement, land conversion in protected areas, remains minimal (Fig. 3) . The impact assessments' land conversion maps were used to identify areas that will undergo particularly heavy land cover changes (both in area size and intensity) in the coming 20 years, which is an important geographic input in the SEA teams broader analysis on conflicts emerging from increased investment pressure. Together with the outcomes of the baseline assessment, a complete set of recommendations on safeguarding both present-day as well as projected future vulnerable areas was put forward to the SAP team during the drafting process.",
