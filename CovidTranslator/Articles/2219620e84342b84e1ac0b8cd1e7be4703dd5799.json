Although there have been other longitudinal investigations of rhinovirus infection, the Tecumseh study was unique in several respects. First, it observed the occurrence of respiratory illnesses in a defined 10% sample of a single American community. Second, it identified all illnesses prospectively on a weekly basis, mainly by telephone, so that the reporting can be considered essentially complete and representative. Third, it identified causative agents by collecting nasal and throat swabs from patients reporting a respiratory illness within 2 days of onset. It supplemented these results by monitoring antibody titers in blood specimens collected on a biannual schedule. Details of the study methods have been reported elsewhere. 21 The occurrence per 1000 respiratory infections was reported weekly for >4 years.

Later in the winter, outbreaks of influenza (predominantly influenza B) in some years resulted in a high overall incidence of total respiratory illnesses; influenza A (H1N1) also occurred during this period. 24 Winter was the period in which rhinoviruses, although present, constituted a less important proportion of all respiratory viruses. In spring, however, while the frequency of all respiratory illnesses declined somewhat, the proportion caused by rhinoviruses increased.

            "text": "Interest in the frequency and characteristics of what is now termed the \"common cold\" began early in the 20th century, in large part because of the recognition that these were the most common infections in individuals of all ages. 2,3 This interest led to identification of the major causative agents, principally the rhinoviruses, at a time when identification was often followed by development of a preventive vaccine. 8 However, unlike rubella and measles, for which vaccines quickly became available, rhinoviruses were found to be present in large numbers of serotypes, and protection was type specific. 14 Thus, vaccines were not feasible, and other methods of control, such as the use of antiviral agents, became the primary focus. One such compound, pleconaril, is now in development for both the treatment and prevention of common colds. 12,t3 Given that this syndrome can have nonpicornaviral causes, the question arises under what circumstances this drug should be used. The seasonal pattern of rhinovirus isolation can help determine whether rhinovirus is likely to be the cause of an acute respiratory illness. Rhinoviruses represent by far the largest proportion of respiratory viruses circulating in autumn. In some years, and perhaps in various geographic areas, spring is an even more important time for rhinoviral transmission. 7,3L35 Although overall illness rates are lower in summer, rhinoviruses and often enteroviruses make the picornaviruses the single major viral pathogen at this time of year. It is only in winter that other infective agents predominate--influenza viruses and RSV, particularly along with parainfluenza virus. Thus, for most of the year, rhinoviruses are the most prominent single cause of acute viral respiratory infections, although other viruses are circulating. Reanalysis of data from the Tecumseh study has allowed quantification of the proportion of illnesses each year that are rhinoviral. As indicated above, more recent studies have confirmed the im-portance of rhinoviruses in the autumn, 12'13'20'32-34 indicating a consistent seasonal pattern.",

            "text": "Another method of distinguishing between potential viral causes of respiratory infections is the use of clinical predictors. This method is often applied informally in clinical trials through the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Using this approach, clinical trials conducted in the autumn, including September, have reported an increased proportion of respiratory illnesses caused by rhinoviruses (-65%). 12,13 Predictors have also been successfully developed for influenza, resulting in correct identification of influenza in up to 87% of selected episodes of respiratory illness during a defined influenza season. 36,37 In combination with an understanding of the seasonal pattern of occurrence, application of similar methods to picornaviruses may facilitate the appropriate use of antirhinoviral drugs.",
