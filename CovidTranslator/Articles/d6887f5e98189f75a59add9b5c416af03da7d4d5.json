Whether they be wars, political crises, terrorist activities (real or imagined), natural disasters, health emergencies, or other extreme events, they all have swift and usually negative repercussions for those involved in tourism. Of course, this is nothing new. What is novel is that, fueled by the speed and reach of communications, information, in both words and pictures, is disseminated almost instantaneously throughout the world. As a result, the rapidity of the onset of the consequences of even distant events is virtually immediate, leaving little time to put effective damage-control initiatives in place, and the magnitude of the repercussions of the events is exaggerated. Fortunately, there is evidence that tourism can rebound fairly quickly once the threatening situation has passed. However, in the meantime, a great deal of damage occurs, economic dislocation of destinations and businesses takes place, costs of responding to the crisis increase at a time when income is curtailed, the market is soured, misinformation and incomplete information abound, uncertainty prevails, and recriminations occur at a time when calm and measured responses are called for and a cohesive set of responses is required.",

In fact the grouping of natural disasters, wars, terrorist events, chemical spills, epidemics, and other such undesirable phenomena into a class of catastrophic events requiring forethought, planning, and management, while not new, is now widely recognized as being appropriate. While differing in detail, such phenomena have in common the destruction of lives and property, to different degrees and at different speeds, but often on a massive scale. Recognition of the similarities and differences between such damaging occurrences is at the root of an important new research and policy direction for it changes the focus from discrete, unique events that are unmanageable, to a recognition that these are rare but recurring phenomena that may be planned for and whose adverse consequences, if not avoided, may be mitigated.",

It is also concerned with the management of information. The event of concern is the SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) outbreak and, though global in its repercussions, the perspective is primarily from Toronto, Canada. Tourism is an important activity in Toronto. The Greater Toronto Hotel Association alone represents establishments employing more than 30,000 people and its hotels bring in approximately $Can 2 billion Tourism Security and Safety: From Theory to Practice annually in revenues (all $ figures in this chapter are in Canadian dollars). Of course, this does not include tourism activity in many attractions, transportation, shops, and other tourism-related businesses. Altogether, Toronto receives about 16 million visitors annually who generate about $7.2 billion in revenue (other sources indicate half this expenditure). The volume of tourism economic activity that is at risk is substantial.",

In the case of SARS, globally, not many people died compared with many other disasters, the recognition of the challenge posed by SARS was fairly slow, the disaster event lasted a relatively long time (allowing for management strategies to be implemented during the event), but millions of people were affected. Nevertheless, the accumulation of many small dislocations and the costs of response measures were massive. SARS was a new disease but, aided by advanced communication systems, it was not the first to have a global reach, and, from that perspective, it was not without precedent.

Thus, the author has personal experiences of the consequences (but not the disease) that he can draw upon. However, the main sources of information for this chapter come from elsewhere. This contribution is based primarily upon a systematic analysis of the contents of two Canadian newspapers from April 2003 to the present (September 2004). The two newspapers are the Globe and Mail (GM) that is published daily in Toronto but has broad national and international coverage; many regard it as Canada's national newspaper.

The press attention to tourism in Toronto came with the headline: \"Major conference cancelled due to outbreak\" (GM, April 3, 2004) . This referred to the decision of the American Association for Cancer Research to cancel its annual meeting in Toronto. This event was expected to bring 28,000 delegates to the city.

On the same day, Ontario pledged to put in place a 5-month tourism tax holiday, a $118 million worldwide advertising campaign, and a $10 billion business recovery strategy (GM, April 30, 2004).",

            "text": "On about May 14, a proposal to hold a blockbuster event in the form of an outdoor concert headlining the Rolling Stones came to prominence. The concert was a key component of a strategy endorsed by a broad-based recovery group called the Toronto Tourism Recovery Coalition. This would be the anchor event, which would potentially attract hundreds of thousands of fans, of a strategy to fill hotels, restaurants, and other Toronto attractions. There is some irony in this as some years before the group had been less welcome in the city and members had been charged for possession of narcotics! The debate over this event and the planning for and occurrence of the concert make up a complex story. Suffice it to say that the concert eventually took place on July 30, 2004, amid much fanfare and considerable controversy. A study of credit card expenditures between July 27 and August 2 found significant increases of approximately $75.2 million in expenditures compared to the previous week. Restaurants enjoyed the largest (59.2%) increase in business, followed by travel and entertainment (20.6%), photography and supply stores (18.5%), drug stores and pharmacies (14.1%), hotels (7.1%), car-rental agencies (5.1%), and retail (5.1%). However, the retail sector received $39.6 million of the increased revenue, followed by restaurants ($20.9 million) with hotels only receiving $1.9 million. The relatively small injection of expenditures into hotels suggests that the event attracted primarily a day-trip local and regional market rather than overnight visitors. Regardless, a rough calculation suggests that the federal and provincial governments would have recouped about $12 million in taxes from the extra spending, more than doubling the $5 million that the two governments laid out in funds to bring the Rolling Stones and other acts to Toronto (GM, August 7, 2004) .",

Less than desired performance is often attributed to the challenging economic environment that has been experienced, including SARS. However, the bird flu is now receiving more attention than SARS and warnings against overreaction, referring to the implications of SARS to public health, can be found. For example, a former Ontario public health official said, \"Creating panic over things like bird flu is counterproductive-and distracts us from the problems that kill more people than SARS ever did\" (GM, February 2, 2004, A11).",

The Greater Toronto Hotel Association, in a voluntary agreement among its members signed in January 2004, imposed a 3% hotel-room tax to be paid by visitors. Approximately 30,000 of 33,000 hotel rooms are covered by the levy. Also, on February 11, the Ontario Provincial Government, a new government that was not in power during the SARS crisis, announced an investment of $30 million to promote tourism in Ontario. Of this sum, $2.8 million was earmarked for northern Ontario. Toronto may be expected to be a major beneficiary of this outlay, even more than northern Ontario itself, since for some international tourists Toronto may be viewed as being a gateway to the Canadian north. This will be used to finance a new \"branding exercise\" as a tool for \"genuine renewal\" of tourism in the region. As a result, Tourism Toronto will be able to spend about $20 million in 2004 compared with $8 million in 2003. However, the pent-up demand and the rapidly increasing value of the Canadian dollar are encouraging some Canadians to look farther afield (GM, January 10, 2004, T2) .",

A risk-reduction strategy can be served by ensuring that more reliable local and regional markets are not neglected in the pursuit of more fickle distant markets.

Sometimes collaboration may occur between similar stakeholders, such as two hotels, or it may be between partners with very different characteristics, such as a government department, a local tourism authority, and a number of tourism attractions. Recovery strategies (short-term and long-term) Recovery strategies are steps that are taken to minimize the adverse consequences of an event and to restore functions to former levels as quickly as possible. They consist of immediate actions taken following the event as well as initiatives that are taken on a longer time frame. Risk management Risk management comprises strategies that are put in place ideally in advance of but sometimes during adverse circumstances in order to reduce the negative consequences of such events and to speed recovery. SARS Severe acute respiratory syndrome is a form of pneumonia that was initially observed in southern China in February 2003 and spread rapidly to other parts of the world, killing hundreds of people (although not as many as the flu and many other diseases), and greatly disrupting tourism, especially in locations where infected individuals were identified. Travel advisory A travel advisory is an announcement, usually by governmental authorities, warning potential travelers of situations that may have implications for the ability to travel safely.
