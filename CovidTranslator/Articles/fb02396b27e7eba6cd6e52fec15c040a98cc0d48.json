[13] [14] [15] [16] Along with these measures, vigilance and enhanced surveillance is needed to forecast any clusters or outbreaks. 13, [17] [18] [19] Since initially reported in Saudi Arabia in mid-2012, 13 MERS has been reported in other Middle Eastern countries and on other continents. 13 The origin of the virus is reflected in the naming of the virus as Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). 20 In the Makkah region of Saudi Arabia, the majority of confirmed cases have been reported in Jeddah (203 cases), followed by Makkah (39 cases), Taif (13 cases), and Kunfudah (6 cases). To assist in the development of strategies for the reporting, diagnosis, control, and treatment of the virus, we investigated the epidemiology and characteristics of confirmed MERS-CoV infection cases in the Makkah Region of Saudi Arabia from March to June 2014.",

In Jeddah, where the bulk of MERS cases have been reported, males appear more susceptible to infection than females probably because most males must work outside of the home, either in a healthcare setting or in the community. In contrast, females appear more susceptible to infection in Taif despite remaining indoors probably due to close contact with or exposure to confirmed cases. In Makkah and Kunfudah, both sexes appear equally susceptible. Further, review of the data appears to indicate that non-HCWs (177 or 68%) are at higher risk of infection than HCWs. However, review of the difference between the MERS incidence rate for non-HCWs and HCWs revealed that the risk ratio (RR) was statistically significant (RR 0.005, 95% CI 0.003-0.006, P<.001),",

Among non-Saudis, nurses from the Philippines (n=26,23%) appear to be at highest risk, as the majority of nurses working in Saudi Arabia are from that country. Among non-HCWs, domestic workers and homemakers comprised a large proportion of cases (137 cases, 52%), likely due to their care for and close contact with confirmed cases. 23 Among HCWs, nurses, physicians, and technicians appear at highest risk due to their direct contact with patients. In contrast, hospital administrative clerks and health-related cleaners are indirectly exposed in the workplace. Among private healthcare facilities, those in Jeddah are most actively engaged in reporting of confirmed cases. Therefore, it is unsurprising that no confirmed cases were reported by private healthcare facilities in Makah, Taif, and Kunfudah. The actual number of suspected cases remains unknown in these cities, and the burden may thus be underestimated. In Makkah, 56% of confirmed cases had hospital-acquired infection from a prior visit to an HCF and 41% had community-acquired infection due to close contact or unknown exposure. In Taif, 23% of cases had some history of domestic travel and 23% had exposure to domestic pets but not to camels or other known animal sources. In Kunfudah, all cases had been exposed to patients with respiratory illness, vomiting, diarrhea, or community-acquired infections. In Jeddah, 29% of cases had prior exposure to an HCF. The King Fahad General Hospital Jeddah, the largest facility with over 600 beds and to which the majority of cases were admitted, reported the highest number (n=82, 31%) of cases in the region.",

In accordance with other regional studies, 6,24 cough (170 or 65%), fever >38\u00b0C (165 or 63%), radiological evidence of pneumonia (146 or 60%), and shortness of breath (136 or 52%) were common in confirmed cases, thereby validating their inclusion as symptoms in the revised case definition for MERS. 21 ",

Regarding nationality, Saudis and non-Saudis appear to have almost the same risk of exposure. Among all nationalities, Filipinos appear to be at highest risk, as the majority of nurses in Saudi Arabia are Filipino. Regarding occupation, healthcare workers are at higher risk of acquiring MERS than non-HCWs. Regarding sex, males in Jeddah appear more susceptible, probably due to their participation in outdoor activities, while females in Taif appear more susceptible, probably due to their exposure to confirmed cases in the home. Regarding symptomatology, the frequent finding of cough (65%), fever >38\u00b0C (63%), radiological evidence of pneumonia (60%), and shortness of breath (52%) among symptomatic cases validates the current MERS case definition and the findings of other regional studies. A particularly important finding was that despite strict MoH requirements that public and private healthcare facilities report cases of any notifiable diseases, including MERS, 21 and the establishment of hotlines throughout the country, the reporting of all MERS cases remains challenging. As the regular reporting of cases to higher authorities is essential for key decision making, 21 this challenge must be overcome.",

Central to this effort is establishing private-public healthcare partnerships for both effective response and collaborative research. Further regional studies performed collaboratively by experts from universities, the private sector, regional health directorates, the WHO, and the CDC are required to gain knowledge of the true epidemiology and burden of MERS.",
