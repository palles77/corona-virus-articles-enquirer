            "text": "Sialic acids commonly presented as the terminal residues on mammalian oligosaccharides or glycoconjugates are key recognition components of bacterial adhesins, viral surface proteins, selectins, Siglecs, and other sialic acid-binding proteins involved in infection, inflammation, cancer metastasis, and immunoregulation. 1-4 Sialic acids present tremendous structural diversity in nature and more than 50 members have been identified so far. These include Nacetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac), the non-human sialic acid N-glycolylneuraminic acid 5 Neu4,5Ac 2 (1) has been found in horse, 6 donkey, 7 Australian monotreme Echidna, 5, 8 Japanese dace, 9 South American pit viper, 10 rabbit, 11 guineapig. 6 Neu4,5Ac 2 -containing oligosaccharides have been found to be the dominant components of the acidic milk oligosaccharides (MOSs) of monotremes echidnas and platypus. [12] [13] [14] Both Neu4,5Ac 2 and Neu4Ac5Gc have been found in horse glycoproteins. 5 The presence of Neu4Ac5Gc-GM3 ganglioside in human colon cancer tissues was detected using purified antibodies. 15 Neu4Ac5Gc (2) has also been found in \u03b12-8-linked polysialic acids of glycoproteins from unfertilized kokanee salmon egg 16 and in the serum of guinea pig in trace amounts. 17 4-O-Acetylation of sialic acids provides resistance or decreased sensitivity of sialosides to various sialidases. 6, 18, 19 This property is believed to contribute to the inhibitory activity of Neu4,5Ac 2 -rich horse and guinea pig \u03b1 2 -macroglobulins against hemagglutination and infectivity of several human influenza viruses. 6, 18, 19 On the other hand, Neu4,5Ac 2 is selectively recognized by the hemagglutinin-esterase (HE) 20, 21 of mouse hepatitis virus strain S (MHV-S), a type of murine coronavirus, and infectious salmon anemia virus (ISAV). 22 Nevertheless, the significance of naturally existing 4-O-acetylated sialic acids is not well understood partly due to the lack of access to sufficient amounts of the corresponding sialosides.",

As shown in Scheme 1, Neu4,5Ac 2 (1) was synthesized from N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac, 3) by esterification of the C1-carboxyl group with benzyl bromide to provide benzyl ester 4 with a 90% yield.

Final deprotection of the O-isopropylidene group in 6 by treating with 80% acetic acid and removal of the benzyl ester group by catalytic hydrogenolysis with H 2 in the presence of Pd/C in methanol resulted in Neu4,5Ac 2 (1) in a 82% yield.

PmST3 was previously characterized as a monofunctional \u03b12-3-sialyltransferase encoded by Pm1174 gene in Pasteurella multocida strain Pm70. It had broad acceptor substrate specificity and could use oligosaccharides, glycolipids, and glycopeptides as acceptors. 31, 37 PmST3 could use oligosaccharides containing a terminal \u03b21-4-or \u03b21-3-llinked galactose as acceptors, but had poor activity on using galactosides containing a monosaccharide unit as acceptors. It could not use fucosylated oligosaccharides, such as Le x , as acceptor substrates.
