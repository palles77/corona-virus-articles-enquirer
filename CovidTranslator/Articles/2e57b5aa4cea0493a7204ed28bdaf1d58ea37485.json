            "text": "Background: The emergence of the Middle East respiratory syndrome-coronavirus (MERS-CoV) resulted in multiple healthcare associated outbreaks. In response, we developed a nurse-led program to screen and triage patients with MERS-CoV infection. Methods: A formal educational program was implemented to ensure a standardized approach to care planning and delivery. The essential skills that were included were the use of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) including gown, gloves, head cover and N95 mask, hand hygiene, the practice of donning and doffing and the collection of MERS-CoV nasopharyngeal specimens. Results: A core group of nurses were identified from high-risk units. The education program consisted of four skill-days. Nurses were assigned a pre-course work from Mosby's Nursing Skills, an online skill module, donning and doffing of PPE, and the process for obtaining a nasopharyngeal swab. The skill lab incorporated multiple methods such group discussion, watching an on-line video, and a simulated demonstration and practice on a mannequin. In total, 450 nurses attended the Nasopharyngeal Skills Day and 1000 nurses received training. Donning and doffing PPE and N95 mask fit testing has become an annual mandatory competency requirement for staff in nursing and clinical services. Conclusion: The application of specified protocols minimizes the risks of cross infection, placing emphasis on patient and staff safety as well as expediting the patient to definitive treatment. Nurse educators have an instrumental role in training nurses and other healthcare providers on the specifics needed to identify, contain and manage patient presenting with MERS-CoV.",

A coordinated response is necessary to minimize the risks to healthcare providers and other patients. It was found that close contact, such as providing unprotected care to a patient can result in person to person transmission. Simple infection control measures result of the first outbreak in Al-Hasa, KSA [2] . MERS-CoV as other emerging infec- tious diseases had been associated with fears and anxiety of taking care of patients [10, 11] . Thus, we developed a nurse-led program to stream line the screening process and to establish a cohort of healthcare workers to obtain nasopharyngeal swabs for MERS-CoV testing. In this report, we describe the program and highlight its salient components.",

Screening and subsequent isolation of patients presenting to the Emergency Department or Primary Care with symptoms suggestive of MERS-CoV would reduce the risks of transmission. Alerting staff to the signs and symptoms aimed to increase early recognition of the virus in patients presenting to the hospital. The next stage required a formal educational strategy to ensure a standardized approach to care planning and delivery. Following local and international guidelines [12] [13] [14] , the Clinical Practice, Education, Research and Education Division (CPERD) commenced the education and training of all nursing staff to ensure competency in caring for patients with actual or suspected MERS-CoV. It was recognized the hospital response would need to include more advanced infection control measures in order to ensure the protection of heath care providers. Recommendations from the CDC included employing standard, contact and airborne precautions which was used to devise the education and training program [12] [13] [14] [15] . The essential skills that were included in the program included: the use of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) including gown, gloves, head cover and N95 mask, hand hygiene, the practice of donning and doffing and the collection of MERS-CoV nasopharyngeal specimens.",

            "text": "One of the prime importances in situations of outbreaks and emerging infectious diseases is the prevention of the spread of these agents within healthcare settings. This is even more important in the case of MERS-CoV as there were multiple healthcare associated outbreaks and healthcare workers were at an increased risk of infection [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] . Thus, we developed this activity to train specific healthcare workers in the process of triaging and obtaining nasopharyngeal swabs from suspected patients. The process provides a venue to limit the exposure of healthcare workers and to optimize the skills of selected group to obtain nasopharyngeal swabs. The implemented strategy helps in minimizing the risk of transmission of the MERS virus and serves as an early detec-tion method. Early detection was facilitated by effective triage at entrances, cohorting of patients with upper or lower respiratory tract infections, and awareness of the MERS-CoV case definition. The case definition was distributed in a pocket size card to facilitate a quick reference. Adequate triage, isolating all suspected cases and managing them with appropriate infection control precautions aid in the prevention of nosocomial spread of MERS-CoV. The initial targeted groups were healthcare workers at the first patients encounter. Multiple outbreaks had occurred in emergency rooms [6, [19] [20] [21] [22] highlighting the importance of having healthcare workers working in these areas as the primary focus of education and training. Having a dedicated staff who were trained and well informed about the virus, its transmission and techniques and processes of infection control had a great positive impact on alleviating anxiety and fear. It was shown that adherence to infection control measures reduced MERS-CoV transmission [23] . During the SARS outbreak, intensive training of staff for the use of personal protective equipment and infection-control procedures were important components of the control strategies [24] . We believe that such a program of education and training would alleviate negative attitudes of staff towards providing care for patients with MERS-CoV or SARS [25] . We specifically designed the described program to train healthcare workers as it was noted that staff who had <2 h of infection control training had a higher risk of SARS [26] .",

However, working towards a common goal and a shared vision, and respecting all opinions were important tolls that we used to establish a dedicated team for MERS-CoV competency. In addition, commitment from the executive team was an enabler of the process. An organizational response to emerging infectious diseases must be based on an interdisciplinary perspective and includes recommendations from national and international health authorities. Nurses are the frontline providers and they are the foundation of any response activities. They need to be alerted to the signs and symptoms of emerging diseases such as MERS-CoV. Emergency departments and primary care units must ensure the application of specified protocols incorporated into triage and screening processes to ensure early identification and management of MERS-CoV. The application of specified protocols minimizes the risks of cross infection, placing emphasis on patient and staff safety as well as expediting the patient to receive appropriate treatment. Nurse educators have an instrumental role in training nurses and other healthcare providers on the specifics needed to identify, contain and manage patient presenting with MERSCoV. Using national and international recommendations, organizational responses can be tailored to provide safe and effective practice guidelines to protect staff and patients alike. The emergence of MERS-CoV in Saudi Arabia required a rapid, coordinated response to identify the virus and organize a national approach for containment and management. Health policy focuses on healthcare goals for a society as a whole and, in this case, the Saudi Arabian Ministry of Health identified the potential risk to the population and acted in accordance with public health aims.",
