We compared information on asking 12 prices and what species were traded using two comparative approaches to analyze how species 13 composition may have changed over time (physical markets and online platforms; pre-Internet and 14 Internet era). In comparison to the five previous market surveys, we did not find a statistically 15 significant difference between species and availability of species offered for sale when comparing 16 physical birds market and online markets. In all datasets biological factors such as wingspan were 17 significant factors in explaining price variation. We conclude that sustained monitoring is needed to 18 make direct comparisons between the trade platforms. With a continued increase of wildlife trade on 19 online platforms, we recommend increased regulation and enforcement of wildlife trade laws. 20 21 42 challenges in making direct comparisons between physical markets and online platforms range from 43 disjointed time periods, nuanced social differences in consumer buying behaviour, as well as 44 differences in survey methods and efforts. Nijman et al (2019) directly compared open animal 45 markets and online markets in trade of wild cats and revealed that there is indeed a directional shift of 46 trade towards online platforms but this differs generally between countries. An increased presence of 47 enforcement agencies in many traditional markets may have also contributed to the shift, however, the 48 rate of change occurs at varying degrees dependent on factors such as geographic location and 49 infrastructure limitations. 65 This poses a threat to wild populations.

For market data, we conducted a literature review of previous surveys using 85 two comparative approaches to analyze how species on offer may have changed over time. For recent 86 online data, we report our findings on online trade in raptor over a two-year data monitoring period, 87 collecting information on species on offer and asking prices. First, we made a comparison based on 88 trade platform, i.e. market (data from physical brick-and-mortar markets) and online (e-commerce and 89 social media platforms) surveys. Secondly, we made a temporal comparison, using the 'Internet era' 90 as a defining marker: pre-Internet (before 1995) and post-Internet (after 1995). We defined the start of 91 the Internet Era as the year 1995 as in that year for the first time computers outsold TV sets (Newell 92 2001). We created models to explain the variability in the number and composition of the species in 93 trade, using predictor variables such as body size (wingspan), clutch size, migratory status, and 94 conservation status. Using data on asking prices from our two-year study, we explored the above 95 listed variable to explain variation in price and to analyse temporal trends and seasonality. Based on 96 our findings, we recommend increased monitoring, and improved legal protection and enforcement 97 for species. English.

Unregulated 26 commercial trade and unsustainable harvesting from wild populations lead to increased extinction 27 risks for many taxa around the world (Tingley et al 2017). Traditionally, the platforms of trade have 28 strictly been limited to physical trading areas ranging from city markets, border markets, trading hubs 29 at ports, and stores (Zhang et al 2008). Using data of live animals sold in local markets throughout 30 East and Southeast Asia, Karesh et al (2005) conservatively estimated that tens of millions of wild 31 animals are shipped across the region each year for food and medicine. 32 As observed with the trade of many wildlife species, there has been a clear shift in wildlife trade 33 platforms from traditional brick-and-mortar markets towards online platforms (Lavorgna 2015). As 34 part of increased globalisation, trade of wildlife on online platforms has become increasingly popular 35 and for several taxa now has overtaken the trade in physical markets (Rodr\u00edguez et al 2007; transport and increased interconnectivity has eased the way online purchases 38 can be made, and as a result, enabled the trade of millions of wild animals to be more accessible and 39 quicker (Karesh et al 2005). Theoretically, the complex interactions of markets, both physical and 40 online as well as legal and illegal have been explored to a limited extent (Fischer 2004). To date, there 41 have only been a number of studies that examined this market place transition quantitatively. The Of all the wildlife that is traded globally, the trade in wild birds is one that is well documented. 51 Birds are arguably one of the most popularly traded taxa, contributing as the most species rich and 52 abundant class of wildlife traded legally based on records from 2006 to 2012 (Bush et al 2013). 53 Traditionally, birds are kept as pets in many societies around the world, but probably no where more 54 so than in Southeast Asia (Lin 2005; Nijman et al 2018). However, not all of this trade is regulated 55 and sustainable; over a third of bird species are impacted by overexploitation (Harris et al 2017; 56 Reuter et al 2019). Trade has also been cited as the second most significant threat to of live diurnal birds of prey (Falconiformes and Accipitriformes), commonly referred 59 to as raptors, contribute to a significant proportion of the avian trade (Panter et al 2019). Raptors are 60 legally and illegally traded for recreational hunting or falconry, especially in the Middle East and 61 USA, or for them to be kept as pets (Nijman et al 2009; Wyatt 2009; Roldan-Clara 2014; MaMing 62 2014). Although not common, in some cultures raptors are also hunted and consumed as medicine or 63 bushmeat (Zhang 2008; Buij et al 2013). With the challenges involved in captive breeding of many 64 species, raptors observed in trade are often caught from the wild (MaMing 2014; Nijman et al 2009).",

Only 131 one post could not be identified to species level due to a lack of description and the bird chicks in the 132 photo was too young; this was removed from further analysis. We followed the taxonomy ofEaton et 133 al (2016). Price data were collected in Thai Baht and presented here in US$ based on a conversion rate of THB 33.01 = US$ 1 (exchange rate ranged from 31.21 to 35.and legal considerations of online surveys 138 Traditionally researchers interested in the live bird trade would visit open animal markets, 139 wholesalers or pet shops, observed the trade, identified and counted the number of individuals for 140 sale, recorded prices and husbandry practises, as indeed done by McClure and Chaiyaphum (1971), 141 Round (1990), Nash (1993), Round and Jukmongkkol (2003), and Chng and Eaton (2015) in 142 Chatuchak market. They may or may not have interviewed the traders and the customers to obtain 143 more detailed information. In many cases the trade in live raptors occurs in the open, as animals can 144 only be sold if a potential customer has the opportunity to see what is on offer. There where the trade 145 does happen in the open in public, all those involved can have a reasonable expectation that they can 146 be observed by others, just like when visiting any other public space. A small percentage of the trade 147 does occur out of sight, in back alleys or at traders' premises, and can only be observed when one is 148 accepted as part of the group; researching this type of trade is much more complex and, to the best of 149 our knowledge, with respect to the trade in raptors, has been rarely reported. 150 In practise, a large part of the online trade in raptors is not all that different from the trade in an 151 open, public space. It is in the best interest of the sellers to ensure that as many potential customers 152 have to opportunity to see and buy whatever they have on offer. While a small proportion of wildlife 153 trade occurs out of sight, in the 'back alleys of the Internet', or even on the dark web (Harrison et al 154 2016), this is very small and in case of the global trade in raptors as pets or to be used in falconry, 155 largely irrelevant. The online trade in raptors as pets occurs in the open. For instance, many of the 156 Facebook groups where birds of prey are offered for sale are classified as 'open' or 'public' and have 157 their privacy settings set at a level where it is very easy to observe or join a group. Once joined, posts 158 and comments can be seen by all those that are part of that group as well as everyone else who wishes 159 to do so. The number of members that have joined groups is often in the 10,000s -in our study group 160 member volume ranged from 7,763 to 31,557, with a mean of 18,042 members per group at the last more so than when entering a public space such as a town square or an animal market. Indeed Burkell 163 et al (2014) concluded \"\u2026the online social spaces are indeed loci of public display rather than private 164 revelation: online profiles are structured with the view that 'everyone' can see them, even if the 165 explicitly intended audience is more limited. These social norms are inconsistent with the claim that 166 social media are private spaces; instead, it appears that participants view and treat online social 167 networks as public venues.\" 168 We followed a typical economic market approach and used market survey protocols in each 169 monitoring session to observe what was being traded (see Nekaris et al 2010, Barber-Meyer 2010).170 There are several approaches possible in conducting Facebook market surveys. For instance, Hinsley 171 et al (2016) conducted a questionnaire survey to gain insight into the online orchid trade. The 172 approach taken by Hinsley et al (2016) was to publicly state the status of 'researcher' and declare the 173 intentions to collect data on orchid trade. Thereby, the researchers used the acknowledgement as a 174 form of consent to access closed groups (Hinsley et al 2016). While other studies do not specify 175 methods carried out for data collection but choose not to disclose specifics of forum name such as site 176 name and address (Sung and Fong 2018). Machine learning techniques are also becoming 177 incorporated to investigate illegal wildlife trade on social media using the three-step idea of mining, 178 filtering, and identifying data. However, this approach is still in its early stages and frameworks still 179 needs to be explored particularly related to data security and privacy requirements where researchers 180 are based (Di Minin et al 2018). 181 We utilised a manual observation in our market survey to record, filter, classify and assess legal 182 and illegal trade (Eid and Handal 2018). Due to the potentially sensitive and illegal activity on the 183 groups, we abided by ethical guidelines from Roulet et al (2017) to conduct covert observations. We 184 did not interact with any participants or access any personal profile pages and only collected 185 information that was publicly displayed. Data was also anonymized after cross-checking for 186 duplicates, and no information after the monitoring session can be attributed to one person (cf. 187 Kosinski et al 2015; Martin et al 2018). Only photographs that were uploaded on to the Facebook In the analysis using the online survey results, we explore the relationship between price and 193 availability by testing for an anthropogenic Allee effect (Courchamp et al 2006, Holden and seasonality, we accumulated availability per month, and used a chi-square test to assess the 196 correlation of availability per month. 197 We also created an Generalised Linear Model (GLM) in SPSS (IBM Corp 2018) to model for 198 factors which may explain price data using the variables which describe species characteristics 199 including wingspan, clutch size, IUCN trend, and migratory status (Table 1), with an additional 200 availability (number of individuals) as an additional weighted variable. Continuous variables were 201 log-transformed if not normalized. We used GLMs and chose the most parsimonious model with the 202 lowest positive Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) score.

Two surveys were conducted List, with the exception of Wallace's Hawk Eagle (Nisaetus nanus) which is currently 222 listed as Vulnerable. All birds of prey found traded are found in Thailand and protected under 223 Thailand's wildlife laws. Based on 84 posts where geographic information was available, posts 224 originated from 23 provinces in Thailand and 4 posts were from Indonesia. Within Thailand, most 225 posts originated from the southern region of Thailand with most from Yala province (n = 13), 226 followed by Bangkok (n = 12); (Figure 1a). Two posts based in Thailand advertised that the listed bird 227 (both crested serpent eagle, Spilornis cheela) were from Malaysia. At the individual level analysis, we 228 found a statistically significant correlation between number of individuals offered per post and the 229 offer price (R 2 = 0.040; F(1, 135) = 5.698, P = 0.018; Figure 1b), i.e. when more birds were offered 230 per post, the average prices on offer decreasedspecies distribution of raptors traded in the time period of pre-internet (surveys A 238 and B) and post-internet era (surveys C and D) (Table 2).

A comparison was also made for the physical 240 market (A-D) and online surveys (E-F) which also was not a statistically significant difference (t = 241 1.94, df = 26, P = 0.063).

            "text": "online survey, we did not find an equal distribution of species across the months (\u03c7 2 = 261 100.32, df = 11, P < 0.0001), where during months March to May, the number of raptors offered for 262 sale was significantly higher than the rest of the year (\u03c7 2 = 37.76, df = 1, P < 0.0001). We conducted 263 comparisons of temporal analyses for trends in seasonality using the study byMcClure and    264Chaiyaphun (1971)  as it was the only study with detailed monthly accounts, in raptors is reported from 1960s until present time in Thailand, though the volume of269 species traded and means of trade have changed over time. Though the number of raptors observed 270 has clearly reduced since the surveys conducted by McClure and Chaiyaphun (1971) compared to 271 subsequent studies which report very few individuals and species, we now have an equal variety of 272 species and large numbers offered online. In both our models, wingspan (which is the proxy indicator 273 for body mass), is consistently the factor which explains availability and even price, where smaller birds were offered more frequently, and also at lower prices. Though the numbers of raptors offered online are comparatively low, the sustained trade potentially poses a conservation threat to species if 276 illegal trapping and harvesting of owls from natural populations remain unregulated. 277 Globally, raptor trade is increasing in volume, where 44% of the species reported for trade 278 associated with a decreasing trend in the IUCN Red List (Panter et al 2019). The purpose for trade has 279 now extends beyond traditional functions, such as falconry (Roldan-Clara 2014; Wyatt 2009; 280 MaMing 2014), but appears to be traded for general exotic pet purposes as evident in this study. At 281 the international scale, past records of irregular or illegitimate import-export trade documents have 282 previously been an issue (Shepherd et al 2012; Panter et al 2019). Domestically, there still needs to be 283 increased studies on the impact of harvest on wild raptor populations as Thailand has been recognized 284 as an important raptor migration site (Decandido et al 2004). Furthermore, it has been noted that 285 domestic markets are often overlooked and underreported (Phelps et al 2010). The domestic trade of 286 raptors recorded here are illegal under Thailand's wildlife laws, only a few studies that have directly compared the shift in wildlife market platforms. 291 Bird markets in Indonesia is one of the places that has been thoroughly studied over time, from 292 traditional markets (Nijman and Nekaris unpubl. data) to modern contemporary markets (Iqbal 2016, 293 Gunawan et al 2017; Table 5). Iqbal (2016) monitored five specialised birds of prey Facebook groups 294 for, on average, 8 months over 2015. Three of the five Facebook groups were based in Java (but of 295 course people from outside this island are able to join and participate) and these were responsible for 296 about two third of the birds of prey that were offered for sale. Gunawan et al (2017) monitored 38 297 general wildlife trade and specialized birds of prey Facebook groups for 11 months over 2015, with 298 about 90 percent of the offers originating from Facebook groups that were based in Java. Nijman and 299 Nekaris (unpublished) monitored 15 bird markets in eight cities in Java from April 2014 to July 2019 300 (for details see Nijman and Nekaris 2017; Nijman et al 2018), and recorded all birds of prey that were 301 openly offered for sale. Despite differences in methodologies and survey efforts, we find similar links in species offered for sale, specially the migrant species which also fly over Thailand and mainland 303 Southeast Asia such as the Japanese sparrowhawk Accipiter gularis and Chinese goshawk A. 304 soloensis, as well as sales of non-migratory species such as mountain hawk-eagles N. nipalensis 305 which must have been imported from the mainland and Thailand is one of the closed source countries. 306 The shift of wildlife sold in physical markets to online markets goes beyond wildlife sold for the 307 purposes of exotic pets. A key reason is the increased desire for the closure of wet wildlife markets 308 for a variety of reasons. There is evidence that physical markets are used as platforms to trade both 309 legal and illegal wildlife (Fischer 2004; Moyle 2017). The drive for the sale of high-value derivative 310 wildlife products such as ivory to close markets is a high profile example aimed to reduce the 311 poaching of African elephants. Another example is the push for closures of physical wildlife markets 312 due to its potential source as a zoonotic disease hotspot (Karesh et al 2005). In 2002, the outbreak of 313 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) coronavirus (CoV) in humans, was linked to Himalayan 314 palm civets (Paguna larvata) in wet markets in Shenzen, China (Webster 2004; Bell et al 2004). In 315 2019, an outbreak of a novel coronavirus (COVID-19), which causes respiratory illness, was linked to 316 Huanan wet market in Wuhan, China (Yee et al 2020). This consequence of the outbreak to the 317 domestic and global economy has led the Chinese government to impose a comprehensive ban on the 318 trade and consumption of wild animals, with the exception of for medicinal purposes (Xinhua 2020). 319 The examples mentioned indicate that the move towards online platforms is not only driven by 320 choice and changes in consumer behaviour, but it may also be the only option for some traders. The 321 challenge to properly obtain data on what wildlife is being sold, the volumes and turnover rates and 322 market dynamics are even harder to estimate when the trade goes underground. The important thing 323 needed to identify a shift is thorough monitoring of both platforms, in order to closely track it. 324 Moreover, the same issues that follow physical markets of illegal items being laundered through legal 325 trade platforms are still evident even among online market platforms (Gao and Clark 2014). However, 326 law enforcement actions are not the same on both platforms. Traditional markets may require 327 authorities going to shops that illegally sell such as city markets, border markets, trading hubs at 328 ports, and stores. Online traders, on the other hand are more flexible and traders do not necessarily 329 need to have a pet shop. Conservative wildlife trade legislation in many places do not currently include the online trade. The potential threat remains that if further bans of trade are extended onto 331 online platforms may potentially even drive traders to go underground into the dark web, and role of social media platforms for trade also needs to be addressed. The link 334 between the growth of social media and exploitation of threatened species for pet purposes is 335 somewhat subjective, but highlighted for the trade of raptors and owls (Kitson and Nekaris 2017; 336 Panter et al 2019). Recently, more research is being dedicated to investigate the role and impact of 337 social media on legal and illegal trade of birds (Iqbal 2016; Siriwat et al 2020), and other species 338 (Martin et al 2018, Di Minin et al 2018). The combination of increased monitoring trade on these 339 novel platforms, with continued surveying of traditional markets to ensure no increase in numbers are 340 offered for sale will be essential in helping inform wildlife regulations and policies, not only of 341 raptors but of all wildlife species targeted for trade. 342 There is a growing body of literature that addresses the need for monitoring online platforms for 343 wildlife trade. Multifaceted approach in monitoring, capacity development and encouraging change in 344 consumer behavior are key starting points (Aloysius et al 2019). Through tracking of trade volumes 345 and prices, online trade data can also be used to develop a better understanding of markets, which can 346 in turn be used to predict trends and set priorities for conservation (Harris et al 2015). Furthermore, 347 illegal activity online can also provide the opportunity with accessible data to assess consumer 348 behaviour, which can ultimately be integrated into conservation management strategies (declare that there is no conflict of interest.
