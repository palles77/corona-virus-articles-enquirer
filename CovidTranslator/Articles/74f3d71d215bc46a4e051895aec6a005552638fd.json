To counteract infections with viruses, bats have evolved enhanced mechanisms to limit virus replication and immunopathology. However, molecular and cellular drivers of antiviral responses in bats largely remain an enigma. In this study, we demonstrate that a serine residue in IRF3 is positively selected for in multiple bat species. IRF3 is a central regulator of innate antiviral responses in mammals. Replacing the serine residue in bat IRF3 with the human leucine residue decreased antiviral protection in bat cells, whereas the addition of this serine residue in human IRF3 significantly enhanced antiviral protection in human cells. Our study provides genetic and functional evidence for enhanced IRF3-mediated antiviral responses in bats and adds support to speculations that bats have positively selected for multiple adaptations in their antiviral immune responses.",

More recently, SARS-CoV-2, which is causing the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak, was determined to be 96% similar at the genomic level to a bat CoV (Bat_CoV_RaTG13) that was detected in Rhinolophus affinis (Zhou et al., 2020) . However, bats that are naturally or experimentally infected with these viruses do not demonstrate overt signs of disease (Munster et al., 2016; Hayman, 2016) .

            "text": "IRF3 is a central transcription factor, and multiple antiviral signaling pathways converge on this molecule (Honda and Taniguchi, 2006; Honda et al., 2006) . On sensing viral nucleic acids, pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) activate downstream signaling mediators, such as cellular kinases TANK binding kinase 1 (TBK1) and inhibitor of nuclear factor kappa-B kinase subunit epsilon (IKKe). Activated kinases phosphorylate serine residues in human IRF3 at positions 385, 386, 396, 398, and 402 to activate IRF3 (Panne et al., 2007) . Activated IRF3 dimerizes and localizes to the nucleus of the cell to induce the expression of type I IFNs and downstream ISGs that induce an antiviral state in infected (autocrine) and neighboring (paracrine) cells (Kawai and Akira, 2006) . A recent study in Eptesicus fuscus (big brown bat) cells demonstrated that IRF3 is essential for double-stranded (ds) RNA (polyI:C) and MERS-CoV infection-mediated stimulation of antiviral signaling pathways . However, residues important for IRF3 activation in bats have not been characterized. Considering the apparent asymptomatic co-existence of RNA viruses and bats (Maxmen, 2017; Wong et al., 2019) , it is important to study the evolution of RNA virus detection and subsequent antiviral signaling in this mammalian order. Bats evolved/diverged from land mammals over 80 million years ago (Teeling et al., 2005; Simmons et al., 2008) , and the prolonged arms race with some of these viruses, coupled with the unique ability to fly, have likely shaped their antiviral responses (O'shea et al., 2014; . Considering the important role of IRF3 in mediating downstream antiviral signaling events and the ability of multiple bat-borne RNA viruses to inhibit IRF3 activation in human cells (Lui et al., 2016; Ding et al., 2014; Chen et al., 2014) , bats have likely evolved sophisticated mechanisms of IRF3 activation to mount a robust antiviral response to low levels of infection.",

Since IRF3 is a key transcription factor in several virus-sensing pathways, we conducted computational and functional analyses of bat IRF3 across both suborders of bats, Yinpterochiroptera and Yangochiroptera. Sequence alignment of representative mammalian IRF3 sequences showed that serine (S) residues in the C-terminal serine-rich region are highly conserved (Figure 1 ). On performing further in silico analysis of IRF3 amino acid sequences, we identified that the amino acid residue at the 185 th position was positively selected for in multiple bat IRF3 sequences ( Figure 1 ). Since serine residues play a major role in IRF3 activation (Panne et al., 2007) , we studied the functional importance of the serine residue at the 185 th position (S185) in 7 of 11 bat IRF3 sequences.",

We generated E. fuscus and P. alecto wild-type (Ef IRF3-WT and Pa IRF3-WT) and altered (Ef IRF3-L185 and Pa IRF3-L185) IRF3 expression plasmids. We also generated wild-type (hu IRF3-WT) and altered (hu IRF3-S185) human IRF3 expression plasmids to determine if introducing S185 would enhance antiviral protection in human cells. To quantify the antiviral response in cells expressing wild-type or altered forms of IRF3, we performed bioassays using vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) that was genetically engineered to express green fluorescent protein (VSV-GFP). VSV is known to infect cells from multiple species of mammals (Johannsdottir et al., 2009) and is very sensitive to IFN signaling, making it ideal for antiviral studies in cells from diverse mammalian species. In this study, we used IRF3 deleted human fibroblast cells (THF-IRF3 KO cells) (Sali et al., 2015) and IRF3 deleted kidney cells from two distantly related bat species, E. fuscus (Yangochiroptera; cr3-8 cells) and Pteropus alecto (Yinpterochiroptera; PakiT03-4G cells). The use of IRF3-null cells allowed us to ectopically express wild-type and altered forms of IRF3 in a dosedependent manner ( Figure 2A ).",

We next determined if the role of S185 in enhancing IRF3-mediated antiviral protection was dependent on phosphorylation. Since anti-phospho antibodies to S185 are not available, we substituted the serine residue at the 185 th position with aspartate (S185D mutation) in human and bat IRF3. Aspartate mimics the charge on a phosphorylated serine residue and has been used to study cellular functions that are modulated by phosphorylated serine residues in proteins (Leger et al., 1997) . We repeated our bioassays and compared antiviral responses in cells expressing L185, S185 and D185 forms of IRF3. Indeed, human and bat IRF3-D185 conferred enhanced antiviral protection in human and bat cells, respectively, relative to IRF3-L185, suggesting that the activity of S185 is dependent on a charge that is similar to a phosphorylated serine residue ( Figures 3A-3C ). Interestingly, IRF3-D185 conferred enhanced protection in PakiT03-4G cells, relative to IRF3-S185-expressing cells that were stimulated with poly(I:C) ( Figure 3B ). Similarly, IRF3-D185 expressing THF-IRF3 KO cells were better protected from VSV-GFP, relative to IRF3-S185-expressing cells ( Figure 3C ; mock). Transfecting 50 ng of IRF3-D185-expressing plasmid also conferred better protection in THF-IRF3 KO cells than IRF3-S185 in the presence of poly(I:C) stimulation ( Figure 3C ). However, in the presence of poly(I:C), 100 ng of plasmid transfection of D185 and S185 forms of human IRF3 conferred comparable and significant protection in THF-IRF3 KO cells, relative to IRF3-L185 ( Figure 3C ). There were no significant differences in antiviral protection between S185 and D185 forms of IRF3 in cr3-8 cells ( Figure 3A ).",

We treated Efk3B and PakiT03 cells with varying concentrations of the inhibitor and stimulated the cells with poly(I:C) for 3 h.

Ef and Pa IRF3-S185-expressing bat cells (cr3-8 and PakiT03-4G cells, respectively) that were treated with the inhibitor and stimulated with poly(I:C) had significantly higher levels of virus replication, relative to mock inhibitortreated and poly(I:C)-induced IRF3-S185-expressing cells ( Figures 3D and 3E ). For cr3-8 cells expressing IRF3-S185, treating the cells with the inhibitor reduced basal levels of antiviral protection even in the absence of poly(I:C) ( Figure 3D ; mock).

We and others have also shown that IRF3-mediated signaling can induce ISG expression independent of IFN production (Ashley et al., 2019; Noyce et al., 2011) . To determine if antiviral protection observed in cells expressing S185 or L185 forms of IRF3 was dependent on type I IFN signaling, we repeated our bioassays (Figure 2A ) in IRF3 and IFNAR1 double knockout (dKO) human cells (THF-IRF3-IFNAR1 dKO) and IRF3 and IFNAR2 dKO P. alecto (PakiT03-IFNAR2-IRF3-G6) cells. Expressing hu IRF3-WT (L185) or hu IRF3-S185 in THF dKO cells ( Figure 4B ) did not induce antiviral protection upon poly(I:C) stimulation ( Figure 4A ). Similarly, expressing Pa IRF3-WT (S185) or Pa IRF3-L185 in PakiT03-IFNAR2-IRF3-G6 dKO cells ( Figure 4D ) did not induce antiviral protection in response to poly(I:C) ( Figure 4C ). These data demonstrate that IRF3-L185 and S185-mediated antiviral responses to doublestranded RNA in human and bat cells are dependent on canonical IFN signaling via the IFNAR complex. The lack of antiviral protection in IRF3 and IFNAR deleted human and bat cells demonstrate that antiviral protection in our bioassays are mediated through type I IFNs (Uz\u00e9 et al., 1990) .",

Multiple studies have demonstrated the ability of bat cells to produce antiviral IFNs and downstream ISGs; however, the role of key transcription factors, such as IRF3 in the antiviral signaling cascade has not been studied. In this study, we provide genetic and functional evidence that multiple bat IRF3 sequences have positively selected for a serine residue that confers enhanced antiviral protection in both bat and human cells. Interestingly, we also observed that Desmodus rotundus IRF3 sequence contained a phenylalanine residue at the 185 th position and a glycine residue at the 398 th position (Figure 1) and Hipposideros armiger IRF3 sequence contained a proline residue at the 185 th position and a threonine residue at the 402 nd position ( Figure 1 ). As high-quality sequences and cell lines from these bats become available, it will be interesting to test the functional relevance of these mutations in bat IRF3 at the 185 th position and the serine-rich region.",

We also show for the first time that blocking bat TBK1 and IKKe using an inhibitor reduces phosphorylation of the 396 th serine residue in bat IRF3 (see Figures S1B and S1C) and subsequently dampens IRF3-S185-mediated antiviral protection against replicating VSV in bat cells (Figures 3D and 3E ). It has been demonstrated that phosphorylation of S396 in human IRF3 alleviates autoinhibition and facilitates the phosphorylation of S385 and S386, thus amplifying the antiviral response (Panne et al., 2007) . Similarly, phosphorylation of IRF3-S185 likely enhances phosphorylation of other serine residues in the serine-rich region that amplifies IRF3-mediated antiviral responses in bat and human cells. We also noted that treating bat cells with TBK1 and IKKe inhibitor did not restore VSV-GFP replication to levels observed in control cells (Figures 3D and 3E) . It is possible that the kinase inhibitor is not as efficient in bat cells. Alternatively, we cannot rule out the presence of other kinases in bat cells that are capable of phosphorylating IRF3 in the absence of TBK1 and IKKe. Similarly, we observed that treating human cells with the kinase inhibitor did not restore virus replication to levels observed in control cells ( Figure 3F ). Since THF IRF3-KO cells were transfected with IRF3-S185 expressing plasmid prior to treatment with the inhibitor, the partial protection is likely due to plasmid-mediated upregulation of antiviral responses, which was observed in mock treated cells as well ( Figure 3F ). Further studies are required to identify the role of S185 in enhancing phosphorylation of additional serine residues in the serine-rich region of IRF3, along with any conformational changes that may be induced by the phosphorylation of S185 to facilitate additional phosphorylation events.",

Bats display an exceptionally long lifespan (Foley et al., 2018; Huang et al., 2019; Wilkinson and Adams, 2019) and have evolved mechanisms that may mitigate tumor formation (Brook and Dobson, 2015) . The role of IRF3 in aging and mitigation of tumorigenesis in bats is still speculative, but our data clearly demonstrate that IRF3 with S185 is a more potent inducer of antiviral responses in both bat and human cells. Future studies will elucidate on the possibility of leveraging knowledge from studies in bats to develop therapeutic strategies or enhanced therapeutic molecules for alternate mammalian species, such as humans.",

The lack of cell lines and reagents from additional bat species did not allow us to explore the role of S185 and other mutations in the serine-rich region of IRF3 in other species of bats. As IRF3 deleted cell lines from other bat species become available, it will be interesting to identify species-specific adaptations and the role of S185 in antiviral responses against emerging bat-borne RNA viruses, such as filoviruses, paramyxoviruses, and coronaviruses, including the recently emerged SARS-CoV-2. Another limitation of this study is the use of one non-bat cell line from humans. As more IRF3 knockout cell lines from additional mammalian species are generated, it will be interesting to observe the effect of S185 on IRF3-mediated antiviral responses.",

A group of diverse species of mammals were selected to serve as outgroups. These included primates (Homo sapiens, Macaca mulatta, Macaca fascicularis and Pongo abelli), rodents (Mus musculus, and Cricetulus griseus), Equus ferus, Bos taurus and Sus scrofa. The alignments were carried out using MAFFT (version 7 with the G-INS-i (globalpair -maxiterate 1000) option) (Katoh et al., 2002) . The alignment was manually checked using NCBI's multiple sequence alignment (MSA) viewer and checked to ensure that all codons were correctly aligned. RAxML HPC (version 8.2) was used to generate phylogenetic trees using amino acid sequences (Stamatakis, 2014) . Phylogenetic trees were generated using the WAG matrix (GAMMA model).For each tree, 1000 bootstraps were generated. A majority consensus (>50%) tree was then calculated from the bootstrap trees. PAML CodeML v4.5 was automated by ETE3 package under Python 2.7 environment (Yang, 2007 , Yang, 1997 . Branch lengths were calculated by CodeML. Site selection models (M1a, M2a, M7, M8) and branch-site model as specified by CodeML were tested. For the branch-site model, each branch, which consists of a single species was tested for positive selection. A likelihood ratio test was used to test the difference between the alternate and null hypothesis. M1 is the nearly neutral model, and was the null hypothesis that was tested against M2, which incorporates positive selection. Model M7 incorporates a beta distributed selection values while M8 adds a class of sites with positive selection. Model M8 was tested against the null hypothesis M7. Since the likelihood ratios were significant (see supplementary figure S1E ; left panel), posterior probabilities were used to identify sites under positive selection. The differences, M7/M8, via Bayes Empirical Bayes (BEB) analysis (Yang et al., 2005) identified positively selected residues (see supplementary figure S1E; right panel).",

Efk3B (wildtype cells) and cr3-8 (E. fuscus IRF3KO kidney) cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented with GlutaMax (Gibco), 10% FBS and penicillin/streptomycin. PakiT03, PakiT03-4G (IRF3 KO), PakiT03-IFNAR2-4A and PakiT03-IFNAR2-IRF3-G6 dKO cells (P. alecto kidney cells) were maintained in DMEM supplemented with GlutaMax (Gibco), 10% FBS and penicillin/streptomycin. All cells were incubated at 37\u00b0C in humidified, 5% CO2 incubators. Cell lines were periodically tested for mycoplasma contamination. Stocks of genetically engineered vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV-GFP) carrying a GFP expression cassette (Noyce et al., 2011) were stored at -80\u00b0C. Virus stocks were thawed once and used for an experiment. A fresh vial was used for each experiment to avoid repeated freeze-thaws. , and packaging plasmids psPAX2 (Addgene) and pMD2.G (Addgene) were transfected into HEK 293T cells using Lipofectamine 3000 (Invitrogen) (see Table S1 for gRNA sequence). 6 h post transfection, the transfection mixture was replaced with complete media containing 1% BSA. 60 h post transfection, the supernatant was harvested and virus was concentrated by ultracentrifugation. THF-IRF3 KO cells were infected with the lentivirus in complete media containing 0.1% polybrene. The following day, cells were passaged and seeded in 10 cm dishes in complete media containing hygromycin. 10 days later, single cell clones were selected and cultured over time. To characterize THF-IRF3-IFNAR1 dKO cells, we were unable to validate the knockout of IFNAR1 by immunoblots since commercially available antibodies did not crossreact with human IFNAR1. To overcome this limitation, we performed immunoblots to demonstrate the loss of IFNAR1-mediated downstream IFNa signalling and ISG56 expression in these cells (see supplementary figure S1D ). Briefly, THF-WT, THF-IFNAR1 KO and THF-IRF3-IFNAR1 dKO cells were treated with interferon from human leukocytes (Sigma) for 1 h and cell lysates were harvested for immunoblots. 25 \u00b5g of total protein per sample was analyzed by immunoblot for ISG56 and IRF3 protein expression. THF IRF3-IFNAR1 dKO clone 2D8 was used for subsequent studies.",

Similarly, previously published P. alecto IFNAR2 knockout (PakiT03-IFNAR2-4A) cells were used to generate IFNAR2 and IRF3 double knockout cells (PakiT03-IFNAR2-IRF3-G6 dKO). To generate guide RNA targeting IRF3, exon sequence of IRF3 was submitted to an online software (http://tools.genomeengineering.org) to obtain potential gRNA targets (see Table S1 for gRNA sequences). The top hits were further subjected to BLAST (NCBI) analysis against P.alecto genome to exclude offtarget effects. Two gRNA sequences with high score and specificity were chosen for plasmid construction. The pSpCas9 (BB)-2A-GFP plasmid was used as a vector as previously published (Ran et al., 2013) . P. alecto immortalized kidney (PaKiT03) cell lines (Crameri et al., 2009) were seeded in 6-well plates at a concentration of 8\u00d710 5 cells/well and transfected with 1.5 \u03bcg of plasmid using Lipofectamine 3000 (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA) as per manufacturer's recommendation. Two days after transfection, cells were sorted using FACSAria III (BD Biosciences). GFP-positive clones were collected and seeded in 96-well plates at a concentration of approximately 2 cells/well.
