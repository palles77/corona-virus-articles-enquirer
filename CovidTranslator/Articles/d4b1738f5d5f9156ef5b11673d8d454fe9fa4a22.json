            "text": "The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) still carries the potential for reemergence, therefore efforts are being made to create a vaccine as a prophylactic strategy for control and prevention. Antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) is a mechanism through which dengue viruses, feline coronaviruses, and HIV viruses take advantage of anti-viral humoral immune responses to infect host target cells. Here we describe our observations of SARS-CoV using ADE to enhance the infectivity of a HL-CZ human promonocyte cell line. Quantitative-PCR and immunofluorescence staining results indicate that SARS-CoV is capable of replication in HL-CZ cells, and of displaying virus-induced cytopathic effects and increased levels of TNF-a, IL-4 and IL-6 two days post-infection. According to flow cytometry data, the HL-CZ cells also expressed angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2, a SARS-CoV receptor) and higher levels of the FccRII receptor. We found that higher concentrations of anti-sera against SARS-CoV neutralized SARS-CoV infection, while highly diluted anti-sera significantly increased SARS-CoV infection and induced higher levels of apoptosis. Results from infectivity assays indicate that SARS-CoV ADE is primarily mediated by diluted antibodies against envelope spike proteins rather than nucleocapsid proteins. We also generated monoclonal antibodies against SARS-CoV spike proteins and observed that most of them promoted SARS-CoV infection. Combined, our results suggest that antibodies against SARS-CoV spike proteins may trigger ADE effects. The data raise new questions regarding a potential SARS-CoV vaccine, while shedding light on mechanisms involved in SARS pathogenesis.",

In 2003, a new severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) was discovered during an outbreak of that disease [1] , which infected more than 8000 individuals and killed more than 700, with most identified cases occurring in Asia [2] .

ORF1a account for approximately two-thirds of the genome, both encode large polyproteins. The genome encodes four major structural proteins: spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N) [2] . Viral surface spike glycoproteins initiate SARS-CoV entry into cells by binding to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors, followed by conformational changes resulting in membrane fusion and genome delivery to the cytoplasm [4] . SARS-CoV S protein is a type I transmembrane protein consisting of distinct N-terminal (S1) and C-terminal (S2) domains that respectively mediate receptor binding and virus-cell fusion. S proteins are key targets for generating protective neutralizing antibodies against coronaviruses [2, 5] . Minor alterations in the S protein can affect tissue, species tropism, and coronavirus virulence. The primary function of a nucleocapsid protein is to form helical ribonucleoprotein complexes with viral RNA (vRNA) [6] . In addition to comprising the core structure of the SARS-CoV virion, such complexes are involved in multiple functions such as transcription, replication, and virus packaging [2, 6] .",

However, a significant concern is that vaccinations against different kinds of coronaviruses have markedly different outcomes [7] -for example, anti-spike antibodies offer protection against mouse hepatitis and transmissible gastroenteritis, but boost feline-coronavirus (FCoV) infections [8] . An alternative virus entry process known as antibody dependent enhancement (ADE) has been observed in viruses such as dengue, yellow fever, HIV, and FCoV, among others [7] . Although the ADE mechanism is not completely understood, it is generally assumed that increased virus yields are due to infections of large numbers of susceptible cells. Such increases are mediated by immunoglobulin receptors such as Fc (FcRs) or complement receptors that facilitate the uptake of virus-antibody complexes into phagocytes, resulting in enhanced target cell infections [7] . However, it remains unclear whether SARS-CoV uses ADE to enhance infectivity.",

Our experiments involved a human promonocyte cell line, HL-CZ, that has not yet been reported for SARS-CoV infections. According to our data, HL-CZ cells express ACE2 and FcRII receptors, and can be infected by SARS-CoV. We also noted that diluted anti-sera against SARS-CoV promotes SARS-CoV infection, and that this phenomenon is significantly mediated by anti-S antibodies. Finally, only one of several monoclonal antibodies against S proteins generated for this project expressed neutralizing action; the others displayed mild-to-moderate ADE effects on HL-CZ cells.",

Cell infection via antibody-dependent enhancement has been observed for several viral diseases, including dengue virus, HIV-1, and feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) [7, 13] . In the present study we identified the susceptibility of an alternative cell line, HL-CZ, to SARS-CoV infection (Fig. 1) . Specifically, we found that HL-CZ cells express ACE2 receptors and display a cytopathic effect induced by SARS-CoV. Two research teams have reported that ACE2 serves as a functional receptor for SARS-CoV infection, and that human peripheral monocytes and macrophages can be infected by SARS-CoV [19, 20] . Our results suggest that HL-CZ can serve as an alternative cell line for SARS-CoV research-specifically, SARS-CoV-infected HL-CZ cells showed increased TNF-a, IL-4, and IL-6 secretions (Fig. 1B) , but only trace amounts of IL-3 and IL-1b. According to the same two studies, human peripheral monocytes and macrophages can be infected by SARS-CoV. Another research group observed the up-regulation of IL-6 and TNF-a induced by the SARS-CoV spike protein in murine macrophages, and identified IL-6 and IL-8 as key SARS-CoV-induced epithelial cytokines [21] . Combined, these data suggest that SARS-CoV-induced IL-6 and TNF-a play roles in SARS pathogenesis, especially in terms of inflammation and high fever.",

For animals, vaccines have been generated against several, including the transmissible gastroenteritis virus [22] . However, attempts to develop a feline coronavirus vaccine have failed due to ADE [8] , which is mediated by receptors-most notably the Fc gamma receptor (FccR), which facilitates antigenantibody complex uptake by target cells. Our data indicate that HL-CZ cells express high levels of FccRII. According to one report, FccRII (CD32) plays a predominant role in mediating of SARS-CoV by using antibodies against different types of FccRs on immune cells [17] . In that study, THP-1, Raji, and Daudi cells displayed ADE during SARS-CoV infection [17] . We found that FcyRII and ACE2 receptors were expressed in THP-1, Raji, and HL-CZ cells (Supplemental Fig. 4) . Combined, these findings suggest that FcyRII is important for ADE mediation in some types of immune cells during SARS-CoV infection. Some antibodies are capable of increasing virus replication efficiency by either boosting the uptake of infectious antibody-virus complexes, or by increasing the synthesis of viral proteins and nucleic acid [23] . There has been at least one report indicating that compared to untreated viruses, HIV-1 replication speeds up when viruses are pretreated with HIV-1 antibodies [24] . According to another report, a higher FIPV infection rate in macrophages occurred when anti-FIPV antibodies were present [25] .",

We found that this phenomenon occurred via ADE and was mediated by anti-S antibodies, but not by anti-N antibodies. At least two studies have shown that SARS-CoV infection induces abundant amounts of antibodies against S and N proteins [2, 6] . Spike proteins, especially those in the ACE-2 binding region (318-510 aa), are capable of producing SARS-CoV-neutralizing antibodies; nucleocapsid proteins induce cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) immune responses that are specifically SARS-CoV-protective [26] . However, another research team has suggested that SARS-CoV subunit vaccines may induce neutralization and/or partial ADE effects via B lineage cells [16] . In a separate report describing similar results, the researchers suggested that vaccine-induced anti-spike antibodies against trimeric S proteins may mediate the ADE of SARS-CoV-pseudotyped virus entry into FcR-expressing cells [27] . Our anti-spike monoclonal antibody data indicate that most of those against SIa regions (1-460 aa) displayed the ADE effect on both SARS-CoV-pseudotyped (Fig. 4B ) and real viruses (Fig. 4C) , and that only one monoclonal antibody against Slb regions (416-486 aa) showed viral neutralizing capability. The associated mechanisms require further investigation.",
