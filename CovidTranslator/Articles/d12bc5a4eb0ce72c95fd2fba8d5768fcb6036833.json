We demonstrated that better discrimination between normal and inflammatory networks by network entropy than by other topological metrics. Moreover, we identified different dynamical interactions among TLR2, IL-1b, IL10 and NFkB between normal and inflammatory networks using optimization algorithm. In particular, good robustness and multistability of inflammatory sub-networks were discovered. Furthermore, we identified a complex, TNFSF10/HDAC4/HDAC5, which may play important roles in controlling inflammation, and demonstrated that changes in network entropy of this complex negatively correlated to those of three proteins: TNFa, NFkB and COX-2.

Numerous studies have demonstrated that IAV infections can trigger severe inflammatory diseases [6] [7] [8] . Therefore, investigating molecular mechanisms of the inflammatory responses resulting from an IAV infection is of great significance in controlling the appearance of complications and reducing the associated tissue damage 7, 9 . However, many biological experiments have shown that IAV infection-induced inflammatory responses are extremely complex and regulated by a complicated network [10] [11] [12] .

To elucidate the molecular mechanisms of inflammatory responses during IAV infection and the pathogenesis to prevent influenza A and pandemics, characterizing and quantifying the inflammatory network permit one to understand the hallmark of inflammatory responses. In this study, we investigated and compared the IAV-induced inflammatory regulatory networks and normal cellular networks by integrating the data from the highly pathogenic avian H5N1 virus A/ Vietnam/1203/2004 (VN1203) and the pandemic H1N1 virus A/CA/04/2009 with protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks. The aim of this study is to provide new knowledge of both normal and inflammatory states and identify key proteins by integrating high-throughput data and computational techniques from systems-biology approaches. The workflow for our study is presented in Figure 1 . Through network construction, quantitative measures and dynamical analysis, we focused on characterizing the inflammation and normal networks from network structures and dynamics and identifying key protein complex that was important for controlling the inflammation. Our studies will provide a multidimensional view for underlying molecular mechanisms of inflammatory response, which contribute to the development of targeted interventions for the prevention and control of IAV infections.",

            "text": "Construction of IAV infection-induced cell-specific normal and inflammatory networks. Constructing regulatory and biochemical networks from multidimensional data is a key step in systems biology for analyzing network properties. In the present study, we developed a model-based framework for constructing networks by integrating gene expression profiles with a prior knowledge of PPI network (Step #1 in Fig. 1 and Supplementary Figure S1 ). First, the rough PPI network containing 90 nodes and 412 edges was constructed using PPI databases (see Methods). Next, based on the rough PPI network and the H5N1 and H1N1 datasets, the Pearson correlation coefficients (PCCs) that measured the dependence between paired nodes were applied to filter the highly noise-induced interactions. We thus obtained the refined normal and inflammatory networks induced by H5N1 and H1N1. To construct cell-specific regulatory networks and further remove the redundant (indirect) regulations in the refined networks, we then built the ordinary differential equation (ODE) models for the refined networks and used an improved conjugate gradient method (ICG) to identify the parameters in the models (see Methods). Finally, Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) was employed to determine whether the interactions between two proteins were significant or just false positives (see Methods). The constructed normal and inflammatory networks during H5N1 and H1N1 infection are displayed in Supplementary Figure S4 . For both H5N1 and H1N1 infections, the average relative errors (AREs) of the 99% nodes are less than 0.1 and those of the 1% nodes are within the interval [0.1, 0.2] in normal networks. In inflammatory networks, AREs of all nodes are less than 0.1 ( Figure 2 ). The results showed the accuracy and reliability of the constructed networks.",

Previous studies have shown that increased entropy is a hallmark of cancer systems 21, 22 , thus we here attempt to determine whether the network entropy can also discriminate the inflammatory network from the normal network. To test this hypothesis, we proposed a definition of network entropy (see Methods). Through calculation and comparison, we found that the local entropies in the inflammatory networks exhibited significantly higher values than those in the normal networks for H5N1 and H1N1 infections ( Figure 3 ). The global network entropies of inflammatory networks are also higher than those of normal networks (For H5N1 infection, 8.5891 vs. 7.7276; for H1N1 infection, 8.2584 vs. 7.6487). By performing a significance test for the difference in global network entropy of inflammatory and normal networks (see Methods), we found the global network entropy of inflammatory networks is also significantly higher than that of normal networks (Bootstrap 1000 times, P-value 5 0). Moreover, the number of increased differential entropies is significantly greater than that of decreased differential entropies (Supplementary Figure S5) . These results indicated that the network entropy provided good discrimination between normal and inflammatory networks.",

Detailed comparisons of these two networks are displayed in Supplementary Table S1. We found that network diameter in the inflammatory networks is the same as that in the normal networks and that the average path-length in the inflammatory networks is smaller than that in normal networks. In contrast, four other metrics in the inflammatory networks were slightly larger than those in the normal networks. Furthermore, we performed a significance test for the differences in eight local metrics (degree, betweenness centrality, bottleneck centrality, closeness centrality, clustering coefficients, Maximum Neighborhood Component (MNC), Density of Maximum Neighborhood Component (DMNC) and Eccentricity (Ecc)) for describing the topological properties of networks. Supplementary Fig. S6 shows that there are not significant differences in these common network metrics between the normal and inflammatory networks.

Although we have observed the increased entropy in the inflammatory network, it www.nature.com/scientificreports is important to further elaborate the real biological mechanisms associated with such changes. We would expect that proteins exhibiting the increases in entropy may (1) show more disorder in protein expression, and (2) be enriched among signaling pathways that are critical to the inflammatory response. To address the first point, we calculated the variances in the protein expression levels of the two networks (Supplementary Figure S7) . The results indicated that the inflammatory networks exhibited significantly higher variances than those in the normal networks. Therefore, we interpret the increased network entropy as increased uncertainty or variability of protein expression from the viewpoint of information theory. In other words, the disorder expression of proteins may drive the changes in entropy.",

Among them, the Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and NOD-like receptors (NLRs) are the main pattern-recognition receptors (PRR), which can trigger the intracellular signaling cascades regulating inflammatory mediators against invading pathogens 25 . Recent studies have highlighted the importance of cytosolic DNA in the innate immune host defence by the production of type I interferon and inflammatory cytokines, which is a powerful pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP) arising from intracellular bacterial or viral infections 26, 27 . T cells are key effectors of the adaptive immune response.

The cytokine-cytokine receptor (CCR) interaction and Chemokine signalling pathways are also well known inflammatory related pathways.

Identifying protein complexes and modules from PPI networks is of great importance for uncovering the biological functions of proteins in networks 40, 41 . In this study, we first used an algorithm that was introduced in a previous study 42 , namely, TSN-PCD, to identify protein complexes. For H5N1 and H1N1 infections, 33 different protein complexes were detected, but 97% of these protein complexes appeared only once. Only one protein complex, TNFSF10(tumor necrosis factor superfamily, member 10)and its partner proteins HDAC4 and HDAC5, denoted as TNFSF10/HDAC4/HDAC5, was discovered to appear in both the normal and inflammatory networks at the early stage of IAV infections. More interestingly, the TNFSF10/HDAC4/HDAC5 complex also appeared at the late stage in normal networks. However, this complex disappeared in the inflammatory networks after 7 h with H5N1 and H1N1 infections. The statistical results for this protein complex are listed in Table 3 . The results suggested that dysregulation of the TNFSF10/HDAC4/HDAC5 complex and the subsequent imbalance may be involved in inflammatory diseases. In other words, the TNFSF10/HDAC4/HDAC5 complex may play important roles in controlling inflammation. The disappearance of the TNFSF10/HDAC4/HDAC5 complex in the inflammatory network strongly correlated with sharp increase in the entropy of TNFa, NFkB and COX-2. To investigate the mechanisms for the disappearance of the protein complex TNFSF10/ HDAC4/HDAC5 in the inflammatory network, we selected 11 proteins including 7 differential proteins (TNFa, IL-1b, TLR2, NFkB, CXCL10, IFN-c, IL10), 3 complex proteins (TNFSF10, HDAC4 and HDAC5) and an important protein, COX-2, which was shown to play a critical role in the H5N1-induced inflammatory response 5, 12 . We noticed that the local network entropies of three proteins, TNFSF10, HDAC4 and HDAC5, in the complex were reduced in the inflammatory networks but those of TNFa, IL-1b, TLR2, NFkB, IL10 and COX-2 were increased (Supplementary Figure S15) . Furthermore, we calculated the local network entropies of these proteins at each time point in the inflammatory network that was induced by the H5N1 infection. Interestingly, the evolution processes of TNFa, IL-1b, TLR2, NFkB, CXCL10, IFN-c, IL10 and COX-2 are very similar but are exactly opposite to the evolution process of HDAC4 (Figure 9a ). The local network entropy of HDAC4 reached the smallest value at 12 h, while that of all other proteins reached the largest value at 12 h. Moreover, the fastest changes in the local network entropy occurred for all the proteins that varied from 7 h to 12 h. Noticed that the protein complex disappeared after 7 h, therefore, we may guess that the disappearing protein complex is possibly correlated with the change in other proteins' entropies. To further evaluate the effect of the entropy changes of these proteins on HDAC4, we calculated the Spearman correlation for paired proteins at the i-th (i 5 3, 4, 5, 6) time point by using the first i experiment data. Table 4 showed that strong negative correlations exist in the local network entropies between HDAC4 and other proteins. There are also specific correlations between local network entropies of HDAC5 and TNFSF10 and that of NFkB.",

In addition, their linear regressions were depicted in Fig. 9b , which further verified these negative correlations. Taken together, these data suggested a potential mechanism in which the disappearance of protein complex TNFSF10/HDAC4/HDAC5 in inflammatory networks is likely associated with coordinate interactions among TNFa, NFkB and COX-2.

Therefore, characterization and better knowledge of virus-induced inflammatory responses are of great importance for understanding the mechanisms that contribute to pathogenesis and controlling the appearance of complications associated with IAV from a systems-level 43 . Combining ODEs-based optimization with AIC, in this study, we constructed the normal and inflammatory networks for H5N1 and H1N1 infections. We demonstrated that increased network entropy and lower free energy in the network, both of which are related to the network complexity, are significant features of an inflammatory network, but other topological metrics did not provide good discrimination between the inflammatory and normal networks. Moreover, the dynamical interactions and multistability among TLR2, IL-1b, IL10 and NFkB showed the obvious differences between the normal and inflammatory networks. These important differences in inflammatory networks may likely contribute to the severity and lethality of diseases associated with the highly pathogenic influenza infection. Subsequently, we discovered a protein complex TNFSF10/HDAC4/ HDAC5 in maintaining the normal cellular state. Finally, we demonstrated that the drastic reductions in the network entropy of this protein complex during an H5N1 infection after 7 h strongly correlated with those of three proteins TNFa, NFkB and COX-2.",
