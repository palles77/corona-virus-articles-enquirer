At the host level, distributions of contact rates are often skewed [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] and index cases in SSEs are often noted to have high numbers of occupational or social contacts 7, 10, 14 . Increased transmission is correlated with host activities that facilitate pathogen dispersion, such as food handling 15 and singing 16, 17 . Transmission rates can exhibit strong agedependence 10, 18 , and previously vaccinated hosts often are less infectious 19, 20 . A recent experimental study documented substantial variation among human hosts in the amount of 'exhaled bioaerosols' (small droplets of airway-lining fluid) generated during normal breathing, suggesting a mechanism for variation in infectiousness for droplet-or aerosol-transmitted pathogens 21 . (This study also demonstrated a potential means to reduce infectiousness by altering airway surface properties using inhaled saline solution.) Other relevant host factors may include hygiene habits, immunocompetence, norms regarding bodily contact, and tendency to seek treatment or comply with control measures.",

Severe coughing, due either to pulmonary involvement of the disease in question 22, 23 or to coinfections with other respiratory pathogens 20, 24 , is often linked to SSEs with suspected airborne transmission. A series of observational and experimental studies has documented the potential for upper respiratory tract infections (with a respiratory virus, e.g. rhinovirus or adenovirus) to convert nasal carriers of Staphylococcus aureus into highly infectious 'cloud' patients, so-called because they are surrounded by clouds of aerosolized bacteria [25] [26] [27] [28] . This mechanism has been proposed to underlie some SARS SSEs 29 -a proposal that is untested, although generation of viral aerosols by a patient with SARS has been demonstrated so the potential for airborne spread exists 30, 31 .",

Other important environmental factors are the susceptibility of an individual's contacts, due to age, illness 10 , or lack of (successful) vaccination 19, 20, 39 , and the state of medical knowledge, particularly for a novel disease such as SARS for which misguided procedures and missed diagnoses are inevitable 40 . The delay before an infectious patient is isolated is an important determinant of individual infectiousness 41 , and is influenced by accuracy of diagnostic criteria, public health resources, severity of symptoms, and comorbid conditions 10, 38, 40 . Imperfect disease control measures can increase variation in \u03bd, if transmission is concentrated in a few missed cases or pockets of unvaccinated individuals 10, 20, 34, 37, 42 . We emphasize that all of these host, pathogen and environmental factors join to comprise a case's infectious history, which in turn dictates the individual reproductive number \u03bd.

We approach this task using two parallel techniques. In one approach, we apply maximum likelihood methods to estimate model parameters, then use information-theoretic model selection to determine which model is preferred. In a second approach, we conduct a test for extra-Poisson variability (using the Potthoff-Whittinghill statistic 48 , related to the variance-to-mean ratio); if the Poisson model is deemed unlikely then we estimate the negative binomial dispersion parameter k for the dataset. Because the Poisson and geometric models correspond to special values of k, then by estimating confidence intervals on our estimate of k we gain insight into the likelihood that the Poisson or geometric model is supported by the data. Summarized results are given in Supplementary Table  1, and full results are shown in Supplementary Table 2 .",

This body of work shows that it is better to estimate k indirectly via its reciprocal \u03b1=1/k, as this avoids discontinuities for homogeneous datasets (i.e. increasing homogeneity yields \u03b1\u00d80 instead of k\u00d8 \u00b6) 51, 52, 54, 55 . Furthermore the sampling distribution for \u03b1 tends to be nearly symmetric 52 , allowing a more rapid approach to asymptotic normality (see Fig.  SI-1 ). Many studies have employed simulation methods to assess the bias and efficiency of various statistical estimators for the dispersion parameter for finite sample sizes, though regrettably most studies investigating ML estimates have focused on k\u00a51 instead of the parameter range of greatest interest here (k<1). Early work concluded that ML estimation has preferable small-sample bias and efficiency properties, and is generally superior (save for its computational expense, which is no longer a concern) compared to the method of moments and other methods of estimating k 50, 53 . Recent work shows that ML estimates of k have only minor bias (1-3%) for sample sizes N\u00a520 and k<2 (values of k<1 were not tested but the bias appears quite stable for decreasing values; see Fig. 1b of Saha & Paul 51 ). In all cases where ML estimates of k have been tested by simulation, the bias of small-sample estimates has been to overestimate the true value of k 51,53,55 . Gregory & Woolhouse 56 conducted an extensive simulation study of estimating k by the method of moments, including applicable parameter ranges (k<1), and found a consistent, larger positive bias in k estimates for small sample size . As they noted, the positive bias in k (i.e. underestimation of heterogeneity) arises because smaller samples are less likely to include the rare extreme values through which the negative binomial distribution manifests its heterogeneity.",

Because of the recognized difficulty of establishing accurate confidence intervals for k, we adopted the conservative approach of applying multiple independent methods, from fully non-parametric to fully parametric, and evaluating their results in aggregate. Because the intervals obtained using this suite of methods are very similar, we have confidence in the reported intervals as approximate ranges of uncertainty 63 .

Once the threshold number of cases Z (99) has been defined for a 99 th -percentile SSE under effective reproductive number R, then for any k one can calculate from Z~NegB(R,k) the proportion of individuals \u03a8 R,k expected to generate Z>Z (99) . (Because this requires estimates of R and k, 'real-time' estimation of \u03a8 for an outbreak in progress is subject to any biases in the available data. It is possible that SSEs will be over-represented in available datasets precisely because of their important role in early survival of disease invasions when significant individual variation exists.) In a homogeneous population (k\u2192\u221e), \u03a8 R,\u221e \u22640.01 by definition (where the lessthan arises because the Poisson distribution is discrete; see below). When heterogeneity is accounted for, \u03a8 R,k >\u03a8 R,\u221e and varies strongly with both R and k, peaking between k=0.1 and k=1 for the low R values of interest for emerging diseases. Because the variance-to-mean ratio is fixed at 1 for the Poisson distribution but increases linearly with R for the NB model, for moderate k values \u03a8 R,k increases strongly with R as the relative density of Z>Z (99) increases. Note that the proportion of 99 th -percentile SSEs, \u03a8 Poisson , is often less than 1%, because Poisson(R) is a discrete distribution and for arbitrary R there is unlikely to be an integer Z (99) such that F Poisson(R) (Z (99) ) equals 0.99 exactly. As a result, the proportion of cases causing SSEs under the negative binomial model, \u03a8 R,k , may approach some value less than 0.01 as k\u00d8 \u00b6. In plotting Supplementary Fig. 1 ",

Cases (or their next of kin) were asked to identify persons from whom they had probably acquired the disease, who were in turn asked to identify who had infected them. Primary cases were defined as those whose sources of infection could not be identified. Prospective contact tracing was conducted to the extent that lists of contacts of identified cases (information that was \"routinely collected\") were matched with a list of reported cases. This data collection technique may bias the dataset toward surviving chains of transmission, since these are the ones that led to the later-generation cases from which contact tracing began.

He imported rubella, and proceeded to infect \"every identified susceptible contact he had during the 72-hour period of his prodromal illness\" 24 . His extreme infectiousness may have been linked to a persistent nonproductive cough linked to an earlier (separate) respiratory illness. The great majority of secondary cases did not cause further transmission; there was only one other infection event reported in the outbreak. Several cases were not epidemiologically linked to any source of transmission, and were omitted from the analysis. This outbreak is almost certainly exceptional in the extreme infectiousness of the index case, and the small number of transmitting individuals (i.e. only two cases had Z > 0) prevented reliable estimation of model parameters. As a consequence, we do not include results from this dataset in the main text or Supplementary Table 1, but show them in Supplementary Table 2 because of the interesting discussion surrounding this outbreak.",

In particular, they posit that \"During an uncomplicated rubella infection the average individual may have minimal contagious potential\", while \"Other persons may have a substantially greater potential for spread\". Proposed factors influencing the potential for spread by individuals were age, sex, and coexisting or previous respiratory infections (the latter factor supported by unpublished evidence from military camps). \"Spreader to spreader\" contact is proposed to be necessary for sustained rubella transmission in a population, explaining why extended rubella outbreaks are most often observed in large, crowded population groups. The authors conclude that the proposed individual variation in infectiousness, combined with the sparse population distribution of Hawaii in the 1960s, could explain \"why the highly susceptible population of Hawaii can encounter dozens and perhaps hundreds of rubella introductions each year without resulting in a full-scale epidemic\". This qualitative hypothesis is highly similar to the model-based conclusions reached in our study.",

This list is not intended to be comprehensive, but rather is a survey of the epidemiological literature on directlytransmitted infections. This list was the basis for Fig. 1d in the main text. Also required for Fig.  1d were estimates of reproductive numbers for the directly-transmitted diseases shown. These were drawn from detailed studies where available, or else estimated from published ranges of values. For some diseases, various levels of population immunity (due to previous natural spread or vaccination) may have been present for the different SSEs depicted; because these levels varied among settings and often were unknown, we adopted the most conservative approach of using estimates of basic reproductive numbers in Figure 1d . R 0 estimates and source references are as follows: monkeypox, R 0 =0.32 (Supplementary Table 1) ; Ebola hemorrhagic fever, R 0 =1.83 81 ; SARS, R 0 =3 82 ; smallpox, R 0 =5.5 83 ; rubella, R 0~9 1 ; influenza, R 0~1 4 84 ; measles, R 0~1 6 1 . Note that estimates for rubella, influenza and measles were drawn from published ranges of values, and are intended to be illustrative only. ",

The variance-to-mean ratio of pop c Z is 1+(1\u2212c)R/k, and decreases monotonically as control effort increases.Under individual-specific control, each infected individual is controlled perfectly (such that they cause zero secondary infections) with probability c. Imposition of individual-specific control influences transmission only for the fraction 1\u2212p 0 of individuals whose natural Z value is greater than zero-of these a fraction c have ind c Z =0, while the remaining fraction 1\u2212=j)=(1\u2212c)Pr(Z=j) for all j>0, i.e. the distribution of ind c Z has an expanded zero class relative to Z, while for non-zero values its density is simply reduced by a factor (1\u2212c) from Z~NegB(R 0 ,k). Hence, the offspring distribution under individual-specific control has pgf: 0 , which increases monotonically as c increases.For direct comparison with other offspring distributions in our analysis, this composite distribution under individual-specific control can be approximated by a new negative monotonically as control effort c increases (Fig. SI-2a).

Note that this effect of the discreteness of the Poisson distribution, while a nuisance in making plots, has little practical impact in this context because most diseases have k<5 (Supplementary Table 1).",
