            "text": "Exogenous pharmacological inhibition of the classic renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) has resulted in important clinical progress in the treatment of heart failure, and has highlighted the detrimental effect this pathway plays in heart failure physiology. 1 A failure to adequately inhibit the RAAS is associated with increased morbidity and mortality in patients with heart failure. 2 As a result, effort has been put forth to further understand the regulation of the RAAS. It was therefore with great interest that a new member of this pathway was recently discovered. Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is an ACE homologue that acts as a novel endogenous inhibitor of the RAAS, and is thereby protective in heart failure pathogenesis. 3 The deleterious effects of the RAAS are primarily related to increased production of angiotensin II (Ang II), which results in numerous pathophysiological sequelae that include promoting hypertension, cardiac hypertrophy and adrenergic activity (as reviewed in 4 ). ACE2 counteracts the effects of Ang II through two related mechanisms. ACE2 is an integral membrane carboxypeptidase that removes the terminal amino-acid from Ang II, 5 the net effect being similar to the combination of ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) therapy. Interestingly, the degradation product itself is a biologically active peptide [Ang (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) ] that binds to the Mas receptor, inducing vasodilation through the actions of nitric oxide. [6] [7] [8] Infusion of Ang (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) or Ang(1-7) analogues into post-infarct animals prevents the development of heart failure, indicating activation of a cardioprotective ACE2/ Ang(1-7)/Mas axis may possess therapeutic utility. [9] [10] [11] Clinical studies were initially hampered by the requirement to obtain invasive cardiac tissue samples to measure ACE2. Our group has recently demonstrated that membrane ACE2 can be cleaved into a soluble form (sACE2), and sACE2 activity can be measured in human plasma and can be elevated in patients with heart failure. 12 The primary objective of this study is to extend our previous work in demonstrating the clinical significance of plasma sACE2 activity in the failing human heart. In particular, we aim to determine the precise relationship between plasma sACE2 activity and cardiac structure, systolic and diastolic performance, and overall prognosis in patients with chronic systolic heart failure. We hypothesized that elevated sACE2 activity would be observed in patients with worsening cardiac function and may be predictive of long-term clinical outcomes.",

Diastolic indexes (including pulse-wave Doppler, color M-mode, and tissue Doppler imaging) were acquired over 10 consecutive beats using sweep speeds of 50 cm/s and 100 cm/s using previously described techniques. Classification of diastolic stage was determined as follows: Stage I (impaired relaxation) consists of mitral E/A < 1, deceleration time > 220 ms, pulmonary vein S/D < 1, atrial reversal (AR) > 35 cm/s; Stage II (pseudonormal) shows mitral E/A = 1 to 2, pulmonary vein S/D < 1, deceleration time < 220 ms, AR > 35 cm/s; Stage III (restrictive) gives mitral E/A > 2, pulmonary vein S/D < 1, deceleration time < 150 ms, AR > 35 cm/s. Estimates for left atrial pressure were determined from pulmonary vein S/D, E/ septal Ea and mitral E/Vp ratios. The LVEF and cardiac volumes were measured using the Simpson biplane method. Measurements were averaged over 3 cycles (5 cycles for atrial fibrillation), and 2 experienced individuals who were blinded from the neurohormonal data made all measurements.",

Targeted inhibition at nearly every level has resulted in important clinical progress in the treatment of heart failure, in particular, blockade of Ang II activity. As is common in other essential biological systems, ACE2 likely evolved as a natural counter-regulatory mechanism to limit Ang II over-activation. Our mechanistic demonstration of the potential role of sACE2 in patients with chronic systolic heart failure has three major findings. 1) Increased sACE2 activity is associated with worsening LV and RV systolic function; 2) sACE2 activity has no direct relationship with markers of systemic inflammation; and 3) increased sACE2 activity is an independent predictor of the combined endpoint of death, cardiac transplant, and heart failure hospitalizations. Taken together, our data directly linked the severity of heart failure and impairment of cardiac performance to levels of sACE2 enzymatic activity, reinforcing the potential importance of this counter-regulatory pathway in the development and progression of heart failure.",

Increased ACE2 activity can be found in the RV, and not in the LV of patients with primary pulmonary hypertension, suggesting compartmentalization of ACE2 production in response to stress. 20 Pulmonary hypertension-related RV systolic dysfunction is dependent on pressure overload. 21 ACE2 has been shown to be an important cardioprotective factor in response to cardiac dysfunction precipitated by pressureoverload, 22 as illustrated by the association between sACE2 activity and estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure in our study.",

Infusion of Ang II produces similar biochemical changes, and delivery of either ACE2 or Ang(1-7) can prevent both hypertrophy and collagen deposition. 8, 24 Deletion of the Mas receptor results in the development of cardiac hypertrophy, suggesting a direct involvement of ACE2 diastolic function. 25 As with systolic heart failure, the ACE2/Ang(1-7)/Mas axis may be the primary regulatory step that limits Ang II-induced diastolic dysfunction.

The elevation in sACE2 activity we see in patients with poor outcomes would then be related to an ongoing counter-regulatory response, albeit insufficient, to elevated Ang II levels and heart failure progression. This would be analogous to increased BNP levels seen in patients with worsening HF. sACE2 is ubiquitously present in virtually every sample we have tested, whether patient or healthy control, 12 indicating the presence of plasma sACE2 is part of normal physiology. Alternatively, the presence of increased plasma sACE2 activity may be related to the upregulation of a protease, which cleaves ACE2 from the membrane, and therefore, decreases membrane ACE2 levels within the myocardium. As a result, there would be a further worsening in the myocardial Ang II/Ang(1-7) balance, which is itself associated with cardiac dysfunction. 8 It is likely that multiple enzymes cleave ACE2 from the membrane, indicating multiple levels of regulation. The enzyme responsible for basal cleavage has yet to be identified, and ADAM17 is only partially responsible for the inducible cleavage of ACE2. 27 Up-regulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines and activation of proteases during heart failure development has long been implicated as a pathologic mechanism of cardiac remodeling. 28, 29 Increased oxidative stress and neutrophil infiltration are seen in ACE2deficient mice, identifying a possible link between inflammation and ACE2 cleavage. 30 However, we did not find any association between plasma sACE2 activity and markers of systemic inflammation such as hsCRP or MPO, suggesting that if inflammation is involved in the cleavage of ACE2, then its mechanisms differ than those that promote C-reactive protein or MPO secretion.",

Similarly with systemic inflammatory biomarkers, their lack of relationship with sACE2 activity does not imply a lack of regional or local inflammatory or oxidative stress mechanism that results from cleavage of sACE2 from the cell membrane. In fact, we cannot identify the source or the mechanisms responsible for the cleavage of ACE2 from the cell membranes in this study. As mentioned, our outcomes data were limited by small event rate. Nevertheless, as approaches of pharmacological ACE2 modulators are currently in development, our data provide promising support in targeting ACE2 for the management of human heart failure. However, mechanistic studies will determine the pathophysiological implication of ACE2 shedding, and whether to focus future therapies on strategies that promote increased ACE2 production or that prevent ACE2 cleavage.",
