In this paper we extend the method for prospective estimation to account for repeated importations and reporting delays.

            "text": "Following the World Health Organization global alert on 27April 2009, Hong Kong implemented \"containment phase\" protocols that included entry screening at airports, ports, and border crossings, and enhanced surveillance of outpatients and inpatients with influenza-like illness. Laboratory-confirmed pandemic H1N1 cases were medically isolated and ususally prescribed oseltamivir treatment. Their close contacts were quarantined for 7 days and usually prescribed oseltamivir chemoprophylaxis. Imported pandemic H1N1 cases were sporadically identified from late April to June. On 11 June 2009, following identification of the first untraceable local pandemic H1N1 case, the Hong Kong government initiated a \"mitigation phase\" and announced immediate class dismissal in primary schools, kindergartens and childcare centers for 14 days starting from 12 June 2009. The school closures were subsequently extended to summer vacation in early July. Some containment phase policies, such as medical isolation of confirmed cases and contact tracing of airplane passengers, continued through June. On 13 June 2009, 8 public outpatient clinics were converted to designated flu clinics across the territory to provide low-cost highthroughput outpatient medical consultation, free laboratory testing for pandemic H1N1, and antiviral treatment. These public outpatient clinics resumed some chronic disease services in mid-August. Figure 1A shows the epidemic curve of notified pandemic H1N1 cases and associated hospitalizations from May through October 2009. Under containment-phase protocols, all laboratory-confirmed cases until 28 June were medically isolated in hospitals, and recorded as hospitalizations in the e-flu database. We therefore analyzed only the 5279 hospital admissions from 29 June to 31 October. The cumulative proportion of laboratory-confirmed cases that were hospitalized fluctuated around 15% during the early stages of the epidemic ( Figure 1B) . After the designated flu clinics resumed chronic disease services and laboratory testing was focused on more severe cases, the cumulative proportion of cases hospitalized gradually increased to around 18% by the end of the study period. Figure 1C shows the estimated R t based on pandemic H1N1 notifications from late May through October. The estimated R t reached an initial peak of 1.5 on June 12 and fell below 1 between June 20 and July 3. Subsequently R t fluctuated between 0.8 and 1.3 through the school vacations in July and August. R t briefly increased to around 1.2-1.3 after schools reopened in September until the epidemic peaked in late September, and subsequently fluctuated below 1 as the epidemic declined. The trends in R t based on H1N1-associated hospitalizations were broadly consistent with the estimates based on case notifications, with wider confidence intervals ( Figure 1D ).",

Much early attention focused on counts of laboratory-confirmed cases, but in affected regions laboratory capacity was typically focused on more severe cases, and changes in laboratory testing and notification rates meant that case counts did not necessarily reflect the underlying epidemic. 9 An example of this in our data is the apparent peak in cases in mid-June and the subsequent decline through to the end of June. This pattern was probably an artefact of changes in testing priorities (as Hong Kong switched from containment to mitigation phase) rather than a real decline in epidemic growth. 10 Substantial declines have been seen previously in R t during SARS outbreaks, in response to implementation of government control measures. 1, 11 In contrast, there were no apparent substantial changes in R t through the first wave of H1N1pdm in Hong Kong, other than the suppression of R t during school holidays.",

For example, other studies estimated that R was around 1.5-2.0 in the initial phases of epidemics in the US, 12 Peru, 13 Australia 14 and New Zealand. 15 Lower transmissibility may be associated with the summer vacations from July through August 16 or interventions during the mitigation phase such as widespread use of antiviral treatment. Seasonality may also be a factor, because influenza virus does not usually circulate in Hong Kong after July or August. 17 Finally, Hong Kong has an ageing population and some older people may have pre-existing immunity to pandemic H1N1. 18 Around 18% of notified cases were admitted to hospital during the mitigation phase in Hong Kong. This is a higher hospitalization rate than observed in other countries such as Australia (13%) 19 and Canada (10%). 20 However among the cases hospitalized in Hong Kong between July and October, only 1.6% were admitted to ICU and only 0.8% died. These rates among hospitalized cases are much lower than in other countries such as Australia (13% admitted to ICU and 4% died), 19 Canada (18% admitted to ICU and 4% died) 20 and California (31% admitted to ICU and 11% died), 21 suggesting that the clinical threshold for hospitalization may have been lower in Hong Kong. The admission rate would also have been higher due to broader admission criteria, with young children and pregnant women routinely admitted for testing and investigation.",

First, R t was estimated based on aggregate data and did not take into account variation in transmissibility, for example due to age. Our estimates of transmissibility provide information about the overall trends in the epidemic, and local data on within-and between-age group contact patterns are limited. Second, while we allowed for imported cases to be infectors but not infectees, we did not allow for cases infected in Hong Kong and exported to other countries; this may have underestimated the total R t . However, the number of exported cases should be fewer than imported cases during the early stage of the epidemic, and exported cases are less relevant to the local epidemic growth rate. Third, interventions are not the only factors associated with decrease in the effective reproduction number. Particular care must be taken when interpreting estimates of effective reproduction numbers through time since depletion of susceptibles can lead to a decline in the effective reproduction number. 22",
