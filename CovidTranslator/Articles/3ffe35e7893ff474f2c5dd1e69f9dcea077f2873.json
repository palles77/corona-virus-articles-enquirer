            "text": "In this study, we attenuated a Chinese LX4-type nephropathogenic infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) strain, CK/CH/LHLJ/04V, by serial passage in embryonated chicken eggs. Based on sequence analysis of the 3 -7 kb region, the CK/CH/LHLJ/04V virus population contained subpopulations with a mixture of genetic mutants. The titers of the virus increased gradually during serial passage, but the replication capacity decreased in chickens. The virus was partially attenuated at passage 40 (P40) and P70, and was fully attenuated at P110. It lost immunogenicity and kidney tropism at P110 and P70, respectively. Amino acid substitutions were found in the 3 -7 kb region, primarily in the spike (S) protein. Substitutions in the S1 subunit occurred between P3 and P40 and all subpopulations in a virus passage showed the same substitutions. Other substitutions that occurred between P70 and P110, however, were found only in some subpopulations of the virus passages. A 109-bp deletion in the 3 -UTR was observed in most subpopulations of P70 and P110, and might be related to virus replication, transcription and pathogenicity. The changes described in the 3 -7 kb region of the virus are possibly responsible for virus attenuation, immunogenicity decrease and tissue tropism changes; however, we cannot exclude the possibility that other parts of the genome may also be involved in those changes.",

They are known to cause upper and lower respiratory diseases, gastroenteritis, and central nervous system infection in a number of avian and mammalian hosts, including humans [3] . The infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) belongs to the group 3 coronaviruses. It primarily causes respiratory disease in domestic fowl, although it also replicates on epithelial surfaces of the alimentary tract, oviduct, and kidney, and is one of the most economically important pathogens in the poultry industry [4] . IBV has four essential structural proteins: the phosphorylated nucleocapsid (N) protein, and the three membrane proteins spike (S), integral membrane (M), and small envelope (E). Although the S1 subunit of the S protein carries virus-neutralizing and serotype-specific deter-embryonated eggs, recombination between virus subpopulations, and accumulation of mutations in the S1 region can lead to the formation of attenuated viruses [19] .",

In the case of IBV, the S1 subunit of the S protein determines the serotype of IBV and is responsible for viral attachment to cells. Furthermore, it has been shown that S1 is a major determinant of cell tropism in culture [32] , and the majority of changes accumulated during the adaptation of IBV to Vero cells are in the S gene [13] . However, differences in one or more other genes are responsible for the highly attenuated phenotype of the Beaudette IBV laboratory strain [13] , and the roles of these gene products in the attenuation process have yet to be determined.",

LX4-type has been the predominant IBV type in China in recent years [34] [35] [36] , and appears to have become widespread in several countries in Europe, causing severe losses to both the layer and broiler industries [6] . In addition, this type of IBV has increased in recent years in both China and European countries; thus, the development of an efficacious live-attenuated vaccine against LX4-type IBV is important. We are developing an IB vaccine by serial passage of the IBV strain CK/CH/LHLJ/04V, which represents the LX4-type, in embryonated eggs. Evaluating the attenuation, the growth of viruses in embryos, the efficacy in poultry populations, and the changes in molecular characteristics after serial passage were the primary focus and objectives of the present study. In a future study, practical considerations regarding the development of such a vaccine will be examined.",

Clinical signs and lesions observed during the outbreak included nephritis and mortality. The virus was isolated from the kidney of a dead broiler using 9-dayold embryonated specific pathogen-free (SPF) chicken eggs. The IBV strain was identified by means electron microscope examination, reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and sequencing of the entire S1 protein gene, as described previously [34] . An analysis of the molecular characteristics showed that this virus exhibited limited homology (not more than 83% of amino acids) to genotypes representing the vaccine strains H120 and W93 [34] . Phylogenetic analysis showed that this virus was an LX4-type [34] . The virus stock for this study was produced by inoculating the virus into embryonated SPF chicken eggs via the allantoic cavity and collecting the infectious allantoic fluid 72 h post-inoculation. The allantoic fluid was clarified by centrifugation at 3000 \u00d7 g for 10 min and filtered with a Teflon membrane. In addition, three IBV strains, CK/CH/LDL/04II, CK/CH/LXJ/02I and CK/CH/LSHH/03I, were used as references for the pathogenicity study; their backgrounds and types were reported previously [34] .",

Clinical signs were observed from day 3 or 4, to day 15 post-inoculation. Eight chicks inoculated with P3 and two chicks inoculated with P40 died during the experiment. Gross lesions of dead chicks were mainly confined to the kidneys, and were similar to those in the birds in the pathogenicity study. In addition, mucous exudate was observed at 5 days post-challenge in the tracheas of all 5 birds inoculated with P3 and P40, while only one of the chickens in the P40-inoculated group exhibited a respiratory lesion. Chickens in both the P110-inoculated and negative control groups showed no clinical signs, death or gross lesions. Based on the clinical response, mortality and gross lesions, we can conclude that IBV CK/CH/LHLJ/04V P40 and P70 were partly attenuated, but P110 was fully attenuated by serial passages in embryos.",

First, serum IgG antibodies specific for IBV CK/CH/LHLJ/04V were measured with an indirect ELISA test. As shown in Table 2 and Fig. 2 , none of Fig. 2 . Humoral immune responses in SPF chickens inoculated with IBV CK/CH/LHLJ/04V passages evaluated by indirect ELISA. Ten chickens were tested in each inoculated group at 4, 8, 12 and 16 days after inoculation. Dashes show the S/P ratios, calculated as described in Section 2. Serum samples with S/P ratios equal or above the dashes were considered positive, and those below were considered negative. The serum sample S/P ratios of chickens in the negative control group were all below the dashes and are not indicated in figures. the chickens inoculated with the four selected CK/CH/LHLJ/04V passages showed seroconversion at 4 days post-inoculation. At 8 days post-inoculation, 80%, 30% and 40% of the P3-, P40and P70-inoculated chickens showed seroconversion, respectively. However, none of the P110-inoculated chickens showed seroconversion at that time. All chickens inoculated with P3 and P40 showed seroconversion from 12 days on, and only 70% and 40% of the P70-and P110-inoculated chickens, respectively, showed seroconversion at 12 days post-inoculation. Fewer than 40% of the P110-inoculated chickens showed seroconversion at 16 days postinoculation. However, almost all chickens inoculated with P3, P40 and P70 showed seroconversion at that time point. Second, the vaccination-challenge test was used to evaluate the immunogenicity of IBV CK/CH/LHLJ/04V after serial passage in SPF embryonated eggs. As summarized in Table 3 , none of chickens inoculated with P40 or P70 showed clinical signs or death after challenge with the virulent P3 level strain, indicating good clinical protection provided by vaccination with P40 or P70. However, 30% of the P110vaccinated chickens showed clinical signs, and 2 of 10 vaccinated chickens died after P3 challenge. Parallel to the clinical protection results, vaccination with P40 and P70 also offered good trachea and kidney protection against virulent P3 challenge, although one of the P70-vaccinated chickens was positive for virus recovery in the trachea after P30 challenge. In contrast, more than 50% of the P110vaccinated chickens were positive for virus recovery from both tracheas and kidneys after challenge with the virulent P3 strain, indicating poor trachea and kidney protection after P110 vaccination. Based on these results, the partly attenuated P40 and P70 viruses were considered capable of stimulating systemic immunity in chicks; however, immunogenicity against the fully attenuated P110 decreased as expected.",

LX4-type IBV has been one of the major types of IBV circulating both in China and European countries in recent years [34, [41] [42] [43] [44] . However, both experimental infections and field results have shown that available commercial vaccines provide poor protection against the LX4-type IBV [39] . Hence, we selected the LX4-type IBV CK/CH/LHLJ/04V strain for attenuation by serial passage in SPF chicken embryonated eggs. Coronaviruses, including IBV, have been shown to exist as a mixture of genetic mutants within an isolate [45] [46] [47] . This is also the case for the IBV isolate CK/CH/LHLJ/04V. Based on sequence data from cloned RT-PCR products, 50% of the sequences in the low-level virus populations (P3) showed a 9-bp deletion upstream of hypervariable region 1 (HVR1) of the S1 gene compared to the other sequences in the same population. However, this deletion was not observed in all of the S1 sequences in the high-level virus populations (P40, P70 and P110). We cannot determine if this reversion of the S1 gene sequence was due to a recombination event or the selection of a subpopulation in the process of serial passage in chicken eggs. In addition, a stop codon was observed in 50% of the S protein sequences of P3 at residue 1157 due to a mutation changing a Glu codon to a stop codon, resulting in an S protein with 9 amino acids missing at its carboxy-terminal end. All sequences in P40, P70 and P110 showed this mutation. This indicates that this region is not necessary for virus formation. The above mentioned S gene sequence heterogeneity indicated the presence of different proportions of subpopulations in CK/CH/LHLJ/04V. Most genetic changes occur in the S1 gene during adaption to the host [19, 47, 48] . However, until now, it was not clear if mutations or the selection of a fit subpopulation was responsible for the changes observed when coronaviruses were attenuated or adapted to a particular host system [48] .",

            "text": "Routinely, IB attenuated vaccines are developed by multiple passages (generally 52 or more) of a field isolate, in embryonated domestic fowl eggs, until the desired blend of non-pathogenicity and immunizing capacity has been achieved. The mutations that cause the attenuation of pathogenicity are not known. We found 13 amino acid substitutions between pathogenic CK/CH/LHLJ/04V P3 and its embryo-passaged, attenuated derivative P110. Of these substitutions, 10 were in the S protein (5 substitutions each in the S1 and S2 regions). Importantly, a common substitution at residue 132 in the S1 protein (His to Tyr), found in the D207 and TW2296/95 IBV strain and related to antibody attachment [49] , was also found in the S1 protein of CK/CH/LHLJ/04V after 40 passages. This substitution was maintained for P70 and P110, indicating that this residue was likely to be important for virus pathogenicity. However, other amino acid substitutions in the S1 protein were not observed between the M41 vaccine strain and M41 challenge strain [50] , the 4/91 pathogenic and 4/91 attenuated strains [9, 51] , the TW1171/92 pathogenic and TW1171/92 attenuated strains, the TW2296/95 pathogenic and TW2296/95 attenuated strains, the TW2575/98 pathogenic or TW2575/98 attenuated strains [48] , or the ArkDPI strain [52] . Investigations with other coronaviruses have shown that the S protein is a determinant of pathogenicity; however, the replacement of the S protein gene of the apathogenic Beaudette strain with that of the pathogenic M41 strain resulted in a recombinant virus that was still not pathogenic [53] . Thus proteins other than, or in addition to, the S protein must affect pathogenicity. Our findings were consistent with this result. We found that nearly all of the amino acid substitutions in the S1 subunit were between P3 and P40, and other substitutions were between P70 and P110. The virus was still pathogenic to chickens after 40 passages and it was fully attenuated after 110 passages in embryonated eggs. The structural E gene in SARS-CoV is a virulence factor, and a SARS-CoV that lacks the E gene is attenuated in vitro and in vivo [54] . In this study, a synonymous mutation in the E gene was found between P3 and P40, and three substitutions in the 3a, M and N proteins were also observed between P70 and P110. Nonetheless, the relationship between those substitutions and virus pathogenicity is unknown. A single mutation, Tyr6398His, in mouse hepatitis virus MHV-A59 nsp14 resulted in attenuated virus pathogenesis in mice [55] . Sequence changes in the 5 -two-thirds of the genome, which contains two overlapping replicase genes, were not investigated in this study and should be further studied.",

            "text": "An additional ORF, detected within the 3 -UTR of several IBV isolates, and with the potential to encode hydrophobic proteins is referred to as ORF7 [48] . It was also observed in the IBV CK/CH/LHLJ/04V strain. In other coronaviruses, such as porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) and FCoVs, a relationship between gene 7 and virus virulence has been observed [49] , although it is difficult to compare the hydrophobic proteins of these coronaviruses directly with that of IBV. Until now, the corresponding protein and its IBV function have not been clear. However, it is hypothesized that the sequences in the IBV 3 -UTR are involved in regulating viral RNA replication and transcription [56] . In addition, Sapats et al. [57] reported that shorter forms of the 3 -UTR in the Australian N1/88, Q3/88, and V18/91 strains are associated with a decrease in virulence. Huang and Wang [48] found a 49-bp deletion in the 3 -UTR immediately downstream from the N protein at passage 76 of strain TW2296/95, that is not present in the pathogenic parent. In this study, we observed a longer (109-bp) deletion at the same position in the 3 -UTR in most subpopulations of P70 and P110 (70% and 85%, respectively), indicating that not only this deletion, but also the size of the deletion may be correlated with IBV attenuation. In addition, both the deleted and non-deleted sequences in the 3 -UTR of the offspring viruses were detected in the respiratory tracts of chickens inoculated with P110 at 5 days postinoculation, implicating that this deleted region is not necessary for viral replication in the chicken respiratory tract.",

            "text": "Although multiple passage of a field isolate in embryonated domestic fowl eggs is the usual method for development of IB attenuated vaccines, not all IBV strains stimulate the immunity after serial passages. The Beaudette strain is apathogenic in chickens after many serial passages in embryonated chicken eggs [58] . In addition, this embryo-passaged virus is considered to be poorly immunogenic [58] , and consequently, has never been used as a vaccine strain. This is also the case with the IBV CK/CH/LHLJ/04V strain. The immunogenicity of the virus has been gradually decreased by serial passage in embryonated eggs. The CK/CH/LHLJ/04V P110 did not confer immunity to SPF chickens when compared to P3, P40, P70 and the negative control. The reduced immunogenicity of the attenuated virus may correlate with its reduced replication efficiency and infectivity in chickens. The S glycoprotein induces protection against virulent challenge, and several epitopes that induce virusneutralizing antibodies have been mapped within the S protein [59] [60] [61] [62] [63] [64] . These epitopes showed the importance of inducing the CTL response in primary infections and neutralizing the antibody response against secondary exposure to the same virus [65, 66] . In this study, 3 amino acid substitutions were observed in the abovementioned epitopes of S1 protein, and no substitutions were found in the epitopes residues of the S2 protein. In addition, N is another important protein that induces protection in IBV. In this study, a substitution (Tyr \u2192 The) was observed in the N protein between P70 and P110 viruses. This substitution was located in an identified epitope in the IBV N protein that induces a T-cell response and protection [67, 68] . The amino acid substitution at residue 188 (Thr to Ile/Ala) in the M protein, which was observed to be related to antigenicity and/or virulence of IBV strains H52/H120, TW2296/95 and Arkansas [48, 69] , was not observed in our CK/CH/LHLJ/04V strain.",

Isolates differ in their extent of replication in non-respiratory tissues, and some produce clinical disease in non-respiratory tissues, most notably the kidney and proventriculus. CK/CH/LHLJ/04V is a nephropathogenic strain; however, it lost kidney tropism after 70 serial passages in embryonated eggs. Using a reverse genetics system, the S glycoproteins for a group 2 coronavirus (MHV), a group 1 coronavirus (TGEV) and a group 3 coronavirus (IBV) were demonstrated to be involved in the tropism of these coronaviruses [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] 68, 70] . For the TGEV, several amino acid changes at the Nterminus of the S protein resulted in the loss of enteric tropism [29, 30] . In this study, an amino acid substitution was found at residue 581 (Leu \u2192 Phe) between P70 and P110; however, loss of kidney tropism of CK/CH/LHLJ/04V occurred between P40 and P70. The only amino acid difference between P40 and P70 was at residue 58; however, this residue is not likely to be a determinant of tissue tropism of CK/CH/LHLJ/04V, because some viral subpopulations in P70 and P110 showed this change. Several other substitutions were found in S and other proteins in this study. Further investigation by reverse genetics and animal studies is needed to verify the exact function of substitutions.",

The N, M and E proteins of IBV play a role in viral replication and assembly [2] . It is difficult to conclude that the decreased replication of the virus in vitro in this study was due to substitutions in M and N proteins. A point mutation in the coronavirus HCoV-229E and the arterivirus EAV NendoU (nsp15) resulted in a lack of viral genome replication and transcription, indi-cating that this RNase mostly affected viral production [71] [72] [73] .

Although it is reasonable to conclude that some of the few sequence changes described in this study in the 3 -7 kb region are responsible for virus attenuation, decrease in immunogenicity and tissue tropism changes, we cannot conclude that they are the only predictors for these changes. We also cannot completely exclude the possibility that other parts of the genome are responsible for the observed changes, because IB coronavirus has a large genome (27.6 kb) . In addition, similar to other reports [19, 47, 48, 59] , we found that none of the sequence changes were shared by all pathogenic IBV strains and their attenuated derivatives, indicating that there may be many factors and pathways that affect virus replication, pathogenicity, antigenicity, immunogenicity and tissue tropism.",
