Fire trucks had difficulty reaching the building due to narrow fire lanes, and the height of the building further hindered the rescue attempt. On August 8, 2010, a mudslide hit the densely populated town of Zhouqu County, Gansu Province in Northwest China (about 50,000 people in an area of 1.47 km 2 ), and took more than 1400 lives.

One such case is the disparity between urban and rural areas. Cities are quickly developing, while rural areas are developing more slowly, causing a gap in income. This income gap keeps increasing, leading to a vast migration from rural to urban areas. Such migration has caused loss of labor, lower domestic demands, and a weak market in the large rural areas (Sha et al., 2006) . Additionally, owing to the longstanding household registration system of \"Hukou,\" which classifies citizens into urban and rural residents, rural migrants to cities have reduced access to education, health care, and social security resources. On the other hand, urban residents are routinely relocated, despite their unwillingness to move, to allow for redevelopment in the center city, often without being well compensated (Tu and Shi, 2006) .",

However, the predominant emphasis on gross domestic product (GDP) growth (Sha et al., 2006) has contributed to a development pattern that focuses on short-term economic gains at the detriment of social equity and the environment. For instance, the legally required environmental impact assessments (EIAs) of many development projects are perfunctorily performed, or even bypassed, to ensure tangible GDP growth (Tu and Shi, 2006) .

Under this approach, experts from different disciplines work together with stakeholders and government officials to fuse their ideas and explore creative new solutions to these complex issues.

Today, with its unprecedented urbanization and rapid economic growth, China is leading its people toward a more prosperous future.

In this essay, we advocate a holistic and pragmatic approach to the research and practice of urban sustainability in China. It focuses on relationships among the human communities and their natural and built environments in urban areas; pursues a harmony among these components in dealing with the three issues of public safety, health, and social equity; embraces regional differences; and encourages collaboration and participation. SHUES will adopt this approach to explore pathways toward urban sustainability, and with a program of research, education, and outreach, to contribute to the current efforts the country is making toward its goals. With one-fifth of the global population, a sustainable China will not only benefit its own people, but will also contribute to the general well-being of the world.",
