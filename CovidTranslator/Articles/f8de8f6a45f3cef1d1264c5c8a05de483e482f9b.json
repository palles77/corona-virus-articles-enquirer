            "text": "The objectives of this study were to estimate the incidence of salmonellosis among a large sample of dairy herds in the northeastern United States (both at the animal level and the herd level), to describe the serotypes and antimicrobial resistance profiles of the positive samples, and to determine whether various herd-level factors were important predictors of incidence. Participating veterinarians enrolled 831 dairy herds and submitted fecal samples from 2,565 female dairy cattle for Salmonella culture because of suspicion of clinical disease. Estimates of animal-level incidence rates were calculated for each age group as the number of cases per animal time at risk, and an estimate of herd-level incidence rate was calculated as the number of positive herds per herd time at risk. Descriptive analysis of serotype data and level of antimicrobial resistance was performed, and Poisson regression analysis was used to study associations between the withinherd incidence of salmonellosis and certain predictor variables (herd size, housing type, vaccination status, and prior history of Salmonella infection). Salmonella was isolated from 576 (22.5%) samples representing 93 herds. The animal-level incidence rates for preweaned female calves, heifers, and adult cows were 8.1, 0.04, and 1.8 cases per 1,000 animal-years, respectively. The herd-level incidence rate was 8.6 positive herds per 100 herd-years. Salmonella Newport was the predominant serotype, accounting for 41% of the cases, followed by Salmonella Typhimurium. Over 68% of all isolates were resistant to 5 or more antimicrobial agents. Herd size was the only significant predictor of the incidence of salmonellosis in a multivariable model; herds with at least 400 female dairy cattle had a higher incidence rate than smaller herds. Our results shed light on the impact of salmonellosis on the dairy industry in the northeastern United States, and they help clarify the role of dairy cattle as a source of Salmonella serotypes that are also important human pathogens.",

Clinical signs of bovine salmonellosis may include diarrhea, fever, anorexia, dehydration, decreased milk production, abortion, and evidence of endotoxemia, although many infections remain subclinical (Divers and Peek, 2008) . It can be a costly disease for dairy producers because of treatment expenses, mortality, reduced milk yield, and weight loss/decreased weight gain within the herd (Peters, 1985; Huston et al., 2002) . Salmonella also poses a considerable threat to public health, resulting in approximately 1.4 million illnesses, 16,000 hospitalizations, and between 400 and 600 deaths annually in the United States alone (Mead et al., 1999; Voetsch et al., 2004) .",

Widespread environmental contamination can result from Salmonella shedding, and the organism can survive for prolonged periods in suitable conditions outside a host (Wray and Wray, 2000) . Fecal Salmonella shedding can also augment the risk of within-herd transmission and inadvertent spread to other herds. In addition to having implications for the health and productivity of dairy cattle, these factors lead to an increased risk of zoonotic transmission. Foodborne exposure may occur when there is fecal contamination of beef carcasses at slaughter, contamination of crops by manure fertilizer, and contamination of water by manure run-off (Wells et al., 2001; Islam et al., 2004; Sivapalasingam et al., 2004) . People can also become infected via direct contact; those who work or otherwise interact with livestock are at particular risk when cattle are shedding Salmonella. Fecal shedding often persists well beyond the clinical outbreak in the herd (Clegg et al., 1983; Giles et al., 1989; Gay and Hunsaker, 1993) , underscoring the difficulty in recognizing high-risk herds.",

Therefore, the presence of Salmonella on a farm is not an unexpected finding. In fact, one study involving 110 dairy farms in 4 states found that over 90% of the farms had at least one Salmonella-positive culture obtained (fecal or environmental) during the course of 5 sampling visits over a 1-yr period (Fossler et al., 2004) . The USDA National Animal Health Monitoring System (NAHMS) Dairy 2002 study, based on a single sampling visit to 5 herds in each of 21 states, found that 31% of herds yielded at least one Salmonellapositive fecal culture (Blau et al., 2005) .",

Knowledge of the distribution and frequency of salmonellosis, both among herds and among age groups within a herd, would be important for producers and veterinarians alike. An understanding of the full impact of Salmonella on the health of dairy cattle could lead to more focused strategies for preventing the introduction and spread of this pathogen on the farm, with obvious public health benefits as well. Furthermore, information regarding which serotypes are typically associated with clinical disease in cattle would shed light on the risk posed by certain types of Salmonella on the dairy farm; this would also add to our collective knowledge of the role played by dairy cattle as a potential source of Salmonella infection for people. It would be especially helpful to gain information on whether clinically affected cattle are shedding the serotypes that are also important human pathogens, such as Newport and Typhimurium, as this could facilitate the recognition of herds that present the greatest threat to public health. Thus, the objectives of this study were to estimate the animal-and herd-level incidence of salmonellosis among a large sample of dairy herds in the northeastern United States, to describe the serotypes and antimicrobial resistance profiles of the positive samples, and to ascertain whether certain herd-level factors (herd size, housing type, vaccination status, and prior history of Salmonella infection) were important predictors of incidence.",

Participating veterinarians were asked to enroll all of their dairy herd clients with at least 30 dairy cattle for whom they provided routine clinical service. Veterinarians were instructed to educate their clients regarding the clinical signs of salmonellosis in cattle, including diarrhea with blood, mucus, or a foul odor; fever of at least 103\u00b0F (39.4\u00b0C); depression; and decreased appetite; as well as sudden death in the absence of specific clinical signs. Herd owners were asked to contact their veterinarian if any of their cattle displayed these signs or if unusually high mortality among cattle with diarrhea was noted. At enrollment, veterinarians collected information on herd size, type of housing, and vaccination protocols. Throughout the duration of the study, project personnel would obtain updated information on numbers of cattle within each herd; the targeted interval between herd updates was 3 mo.",

For each time interval between updates, the number of cattle at risk in each age group was calculated as the average of the number of animals reported at the start and at the end of the interval. In doing this, we accounted for changes in the size of the population at risk due to death, sale, or purchase. Animal time at risk for each age group was calculated by multiplying each herd's number of animals at risk by the time interval between updates, then summing these across all herds; cases were not excluded from the animal time at risk calculations following diagnosis because of their negligible contribution to the total time at risk. Herd time at risk was calculated by summing the total enrollment times for all negative herds and the time between enrollment and onset of the first case for each positive herd. Incident cases were defined as clinically ill cattle that were identified as having signs consistent with salmonellosis and that tested positive for Salmonella via bacteriologic culture. Repeated positive samples from the same animal were excluded from incidence calculations. A herd was considered Salmonella-positive if at least one animal with compatible clinical signs tested positive via bacteriologic culture; such an animal had to have been diagnosed at least 2 wk beyond herd enrollment in order for it to be viewed as an incident case. Estimates of animal-level incidence rates (incidence densities) were calculated for each age group as the number of cases per animal time at risk, and an estimate of herd-level incidence rate was calculated as the number of positive herds per herd time at risk.",

            "text": "Several studies have described the prevalence of fecal Salmonella shedding among dairy cattle, using either cross-sectional or longitudinal designs. To our knowledge, however, no studies have investigated the incidence of clinical disease associated with Salmonella infections in cattle. This study had the particular advantage of involving a very large number of female cattle (over 327,000) from numerous dairy herds (831) throughout the northeastern United States. These herds were characterized by a wide range of sizes and management types representative of the dairy industry in this region of the country. Although our goal was for participating veterinarians to enroll all of their dairy herd clients with at least 30 dairy cattle for whom they provided routine clinical service, not all such herds were enrolled. However, our comparable animal-level incidence rates for herds within high-enrollment and low-enrollment practices would suggest that selection bias related to herd enrollment was not present in this study. In fact, the incidence rates for all animal age groups were actu- ally lower among practices that were apparently more selective in enrolling herds. It is conceivable that the incidence of salmonellosis among dairy herds was underestimated if clinically affected cattle went undetected by herd owners. Furthermore, fecal culture does not have perfect sensitivity for detecting the presence of Salmonella, and we recognize that some positive cattle were presumably missed by culturing. On the other hand, it is also plausible that some animals with a positive Salmonella culture result and compatible clinical signs were actually symptomatic because of another primary disease process; this would lead to an overestimation of the incidence of salmonellosis. Alternatively, it is possible that some cases assumed to be incident were in fact ongoing at the start of the study, also leading to an overestimation of incidence rates. However, we believe that we eliminated this possibility by requiring that only cases diagnosed at least 2 wk beyond herd enrollment be considered for incidence calculations.",

The median within-herd incidence rate among positive herds was approximately 5 cases per 1,000 animal-years, with a maximum of almost 120 cases per 1,000 animal-years. These results suggest a wide disparity in the incidence of salmonellosis among dairy herds in the northeastern United States. Although most farms did not experience any clinical disease due to Salmonella infection during the study period, a subset of the positive farms had a very high incidence of salmonellosis. Clustering of disease among herds is consistent with the prevalence study that found that 25% of the enrolled dairy farms accounted for over 75% of the Salmonella-positive fecal and environmental samples (Fossler et al., 2004) . It seems likely that the most efficient approach to controlling Salmonella at the farm level would be to focus our efforts on addressing biosecurity and hygiene practices among the relatively few herds with a high frequency of disease, as well as preventing pathogen spread from such herds to those that remain uninfected.",

            "text": "Over 22% (576/2,565) of the fecal samples from clinical suspect animals were positive for Salmonella. The animal-level incidence rate for preweaned female calves was 8.1 cases per 1,000 animal-years, whereas that for adult cows was 1.8 cases per 1,000 animal-years. Heifers in this study rarely developed salmonellosis. Both humoral and cellular immune mechanisms play a role in resistance to Salmonella (Lindberg and Robertsson, 1983) , and calves may be at a greater risk of infection than adults because of their more na\u00efve immune systems. In addition, concurrent infection with multiple enteric pathogens (Escherichia coli, Rotavirus, Coronavirus, or Cryptosporidium) is a common scenario in calves (Divers and Peek, 2008) , further compromising their immune status. It is also possible that a relative lack of intestinal microflora in young calves contributes to their susceptibility; such microflora is believed to offer a degree of protection against colonization by (Warnick et al., 2003) or cows (Fossler et al., 2005b) have a higher prevalence of fecal Salmonella shedding. Calf isolates in this study were also more likely to be MDR than isolates from cows, a trend that has been observed with E. coli as well (Sato et al., 2005; Cho et al., 2007) . Newport was certainly the major serotype in this study, accounting for over 40% of the isolates, followed by Typhimurium at nearly 20%; both were widespread among farms. Dairy cattle represent an important source of Salmonella serotypes that are a threat to human health. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) FoodNet data from 2007 show that Newport and Typhimurium were 2 of the 3 most common Salmonella serotypes isolated from people with laboratory-confirmed foodborne infection, accounting for over 26% of the human cases (CDC, 2008b) . The predominance of Salmonella Newport in this study is particularly noteworthy because it is generally MDR in cattle and is becoming an increasingly important human pathogen. According to the CDC, the annual incidence of Salmonella Newport infections among people in the United States has increased by more than 40% over the last decade (CDC, 2007) . Multidrug resistance is also on the rise; the prevalence of the most common MDR Salmonella Newport phenotype (Newport-MDRAmpC, resistant to at least 9 antimicrobial agents) increased from 1% of human Newport isolates tested by the National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System in 1998 to 21% of isolates tested in 2003. Reported risk factors for Newport-MDRAmpC infection in people include direct exposure to a dairy farm (Gupta et al., 2003) , consumption of uncooked ground beef (Varma et al., 2006) , and consumption of unpasteurized dairy products (CDC, 2008a) ; these examples illustrate the key role that dairy cattle play as a source of MDR Salmonella Newport.",

According to the 1996 NAHMS report, Salmonella Montevideo (21%) was the most prevalent serotype isolated from healthy lactating cows, and neither Newport nor Typhimurium was among the 10 most common serotypes isolated (Wells et al., 2001) . The 2002 NAHMS study found Salmonella Meleagridis (24%) to be the most prevalent serotype, whereas Newport and Typhimurium accounted for only 3 and 10% of all isolates, respectively (Blau et al., 2005) . Clearly, there is a great diversity in Salmonella serotypes shed by dairy cattle. Although many serotypes may be shed by apparently healthy cattle, our results suggest that Newport and Typhimurium are two that pose a higher risk to the health and welfare of cattle. Furthermore, this study supports the view that clinically affected cattle present the greatest threat to public health, as they are often shedding serotypes that are also important human pathogens. This would be in contrast with other foodborne zoonotic pathogens, such as Campylobacter jejuni and E. coli O157:H7, which occur widely in adult cattle without accompanying clinical disease (Cho et al., 2006; Kwan et al., 2008) .",

The predominant clinical sign among cattle infected with Dublin is respiratory disease rather than diarrhea (Divers and Peek, 2008) , and we may have missed such cases as a result.

The association between large herd size and fecal Salmonella shedding has been reported in numerous studies (Kabagambe et al., 2000; Warnick et al., 2001; Wells et al., 2001; Huston et al., 2002; Fossler et al., 2004; Blau et al., 2005; Fossler et al., 2005b; Davison et al., 2006 1.0 --purchasing cattle from outside sources, with the accompanying risk of introducing Salmonella via a subclinical shedder that has been stressed by transport. High cattle density may also be a feature of larger herds and could promote Salmonella transmission; animal crowding not only enhances contact among cattle but may also encourage stressful group dynamics. Alternatively, large herd size may simply equate to a higher number of susceptible animals within the herd. Finally, larger herds may be characterized by management practices that somehow play a role in increasing the incidence of salmonellosis. Herd size is a risk factor that does not easily lend itself to practical intervention because of the management trends and economic constraints that prevail in the modern dairy industry. However, it is possible that certain attributes of larger herds that contribute to their higher Salmonella incidence could in fact be modified to reduce the effect of this disease. The use of free-stall housing was not a significant predictor of Salmonella incidence in this study, after adjusting for herd size. One study found free-stall housing to be associated with increased odds of fecal Salmonella shedding in a multivariable model that adjusted for herd size (Fossler et al., 2005a) , whereas another found a similar association in a univariable analysis but not in a model that controlled for the size of the herd (Huston et al., 2002) . Free-stall housing, associated primarily with large herds, presents considerable challenges when combating manure-transmitted pathogens. Freedom of movement in free-stall barns allows cattle to have direct contact with manure from other members of the herd, and it facilitates fecal contamination of common feed and water sources. It is conceivable that this form of housing promotes fecal shedding of Salmonella among dairy cattle in general, including those that are clinically normal, but has a reduced effect on the incidence of salmonellosis.",

A previous history of salmonellosis was unassociated with fecal Salmonella shedding in another study as well (Vanselow et al., 2007) .
