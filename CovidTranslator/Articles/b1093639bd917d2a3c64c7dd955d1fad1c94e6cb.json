Based on pharmacokinetic studies, 6 dogs received a single intravenous injection of 5 mg/kg anti-CD154 antibody (on day \u060a5), followed 1 day later by donor PBMCs. On day 0, the dogs were given 1 Gy of TBI and underwent DLA-identical marrow grafts. Postgraft immunosuppression consisted of MMF and CSP. All 6 dogs demonstrated initial engraftment; 3 dogs sustained the engraftment for >26 weeks, whereas 3 dogs rejected their grafts, after 9, 22, and 24 weeks, and survived with autologous recovery. Graft survival was significantly improved over that in 11 historical controls conditioned with 1-Gy TBI and given either MMF or rapamycin with CSP after HCT, all of which rejected their grafts between 3 and 12 weeks (P \u202b\u060d\u202c .03). Preceding donor PBMC infusion and CD154 blockade improved survival of DLA-identical marrow grafts after 1-Gy TBI.",

However, uniform graft rejections were seen when TBI conditioning was decreased to 1 Gy. In contrast, most dogs showed sustained engraftment when 1-Gy TBI was preceded by intravenous injections of both peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from the marrow donor and T-cell costimulatory blocker CTLA4-Ig [3] . Here we used 1-Gy TBI conditioning to evaluate whether blockade of another costimulatory pathway-the interaction between CD40 and CD154 -was equally effective in enhancing marrow engraftment. Blockade of this pathway has been successful in murine models of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and different animal models of solid organ transplantation [4] [5] [6] .",

The MLR studies used cells from DLAmismatched dogs after addition of irrelevant antibody 31A, anti-CD154 mAb 5c8, or CTLA4-Ig at concentrations of 10 g/mL medium each (Figure 2 ). Anti-CD154 mAb 5c8 reduced the 3 H-thymidine uptake to 35% compared with medium alone (P \u03fd .0001). CTLA4-Ig reduced the MLR response to 20% (P \u03fd .0001).

In both studies, the suppression of T-cell-dependent Bcell responses against soluble antigens (tetanus toxoid [17] or ovalbumin [17, 18] ) were used to determine the in vivo efficacy of the antibodies. In both studies, single 5-mg/kg doses of anti-CD154 mAb effectively suppressed the antibody responses against the foreign antigens, although the humanized mAb 5c8 did not result in complete suppression, even at a mAb dose of 20 mg/kg. In the present study, complete MLR suppression was not observed even with high doses of mAb 5c8. We chose the smallest antibody dose for in vivo studies that achieved serum antibody levels \u03fe10 g/mL for at least 5 days. This was realizable with a single mAb dose of 5 mg/kg IV, because the serum concentration of mAb 5c8 was 39 g/mL even 5 days after injection.",

The emerging canine antibodies likely determined the tempo of clearance of mAb 5c8 from the circulation. The development of IgG responses without preceding IgM responses was surprising, because the dogs had no known previous exposure to mouse immunoglobulin. In 2 of the 3 dogs analyzed, anti-idiotype or idiotype-like antibodies were found. Unlike the mice, the dogs were not maintained in pathogen-free conditions, which might have resulted in more educated immune systems [19, 20] .",

Given the increasing number of newly discovered T-cell regulatory and costimulatory molecules [21] , it seems likely that the blockade of only one system might not have been sufficient to overcome host resistance after a low-intensity or verylow-intensity conditioning regimen. Perhaps combining anti-CD154 mAb and CTLA4-Ig might be synergistic or additive and lead to more uniform sustained engraftment, as has been described in murine models of marrow and islet transplantation [22] [23] [24] .",
