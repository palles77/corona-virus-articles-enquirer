            "text": "The spread of infectious microorganisms within aerosols is recognized as a signifi cant health risk in many vocations, including construction workers, farmers, bioscience researchers and health care workers. Many individuals working in these positions suffer from higher incidences of bioaerosolassociated infection when compared with the general population. [1] [2] [3] Not surprisingly, dental healthcare workers and their patients Background Bioaerosols are defi ned as airborne particles of liquid or volatile compounds that contain living organisms or have been released from living organisms. The creation of bioaerosols is a recognized consequence of certain types of dental treatment and represents a potential mechanism for the spread of infection. Objectives The aims of the present study were to assess the bioaerosols generated by certain dental procedures and to evaluate the effi ciency of a commercially available Air Cleaning System (ACS) designed to reduce bioaerosol levels. Methods Bioaerosol sampling was undertaken in the absence of clinical activity (baseline) and also during treatment procedures (cavity preparation using an air rotor, history and oral examination, ultrasonic scaling and tooth extraction under local anaesthesia). For each treatment, bioaerosols were measured for two patient episodes (with and without ACS operation) and between fi ve and nine bioaerosol samples were collected. For baseline measurements, 15 bioaerosol samples were obtained. For bioaerosol sampling, environmental air was drawn on to blood agar plates using a bioaerosol sampling pump placed in a standard position 20 cm from the dental chair. Plates were incubated aerobically at 37\u00b0C for 48 hours and resulting growth quantifi ed as colony forming units (cfu/m 3 ). Distinct colony types were identifi ed using standard methods. Results were analysed statistically using SPSS 12 and Wilcoxon signed rank tests. Results The ACS resulted in a signifi cant reduction (p = 0.001) in the mean bioaerosols (cfu/m 3 ) of all three clinics compared with baseline measurements. The mean level of bioaerosols recorded during the procedures, with or without the ACS activated respectively, was 23.9 cfu/m 3 and 105.1 cfu/m 3 (p = 0.02) for cavity preparation, 23.9 cfu/m 3 and 62.2 cfu/m 3 (p = 0.04) for history and oral examination; 41.9 cfu/m 3 and 70.9 cfu/m 3 (p = 0.01) for ultrasonic scaling and 9.1 cfu/m 3 and 66.1 cfu/m 3 (p = 0.01) for extraction. The predominant microorganisms isolated were Staphylococcus species and Micrococcus species. Conclusion These fi ndings indicate potentially hazardous bioaerosols created during dental procedures can be signifi cantly reduced using an air cleaning system. precautions should aim to minimise any potential risk.",

Microorganisms within the mouth and respiratory tract of patients can be mobilised in the form of bioaerosols during dental procedures and this represents a potential infection risk within the clinic. Specifi c concern has been raised in relation to the possible transmission of microorganisms responsible for tuberculosis, pneumonia and infl uenza, especially if immunocompromised patients are being treated. 9 High-speed dental handpieces and ultrasonic scalers are known to produce airborne particles with microbial components originating from a number of sources within the mouth. 5 In addition to microorganisms from the patient, the water cooling system used in conjunction with these instruments can be a source of bioaerosol infection. One caveat when interpreting the fi ndings from the present study is therefore the possible infl uence of differing levels of microbial contamination within the DUWLs of the dental chairs used. Previous investigation has shown that the age of dental chairs within the same hospital and employing the same water supply is not an infl uencing factor for water contamination levels, 16 although the model of the chair could have an effect. 17 In this present study the make and models of the chairs were the same. The resultant bioaerosol will also be infl uenced by the temperature, humidity and level of ventilation in the surgery. Finally, the potential risk that the bioaerosol presents to an individual will depend on their immune status. 5 It is not surprising that a range of approaches and practices have been developed in an effort to reduce the impact of bioaerosols in the dental setting. The use of high-volume wide-bore aspiration and pre-procedural antiseptic mouth rinse have both been demonstrated to reduce the risk of airborne spread of infection. 9 Aspiration can reduce airborne bacterial contamination by more than 90% 7 while rinsing using 0.01% chlorhexidine mouthwash for one minute has also been shown to signifi cantly reduce the bacterial count in the air. 9 A mask, eye protection and gloves protect against contamination caused by splatter droplets or direct contact from the operative site. However, even the best quality masks only fi lter between 60-95% of airborne microorganisms and are subject to leakage, if not well-fi tting. 9 In addition, any protection from airborne elements ceases when the mask is removed post-procedure. 7 This is of concern since bioaerosols can persist in the air for up to 30 minutes after the procedure has been completed. 18 The use of a rubber dam during dental procedure has been shown to eliminate virtually all microorganisms in the air arising from blood or saliva within the mouth. 9 When using rubber dam the Table 1 Level of bioaerosol at baseline and during four dental procedures with and without an air cleaning system (ACS) activated primary source of airborne contamination is the water supply from the dental instruments. The Centre for Disease Control (CDC) currently advocates the use of a rubber dam, where possible, together with the routine use of a high volume aspiration. However, since dental procedures may be performed without the help of an assistant, the use and effi cacy of aspiration can be variable.",

            "text": "The fi ndings of the present study have confirmed that bioaerosol levels were increased during dental procedures. The fact that bioaerosol sampling was undertaken for each treatment procedure on separate days ensured that residual bioaerosol from the control (without ACS in operation) and test (with ACS operation) sampling would not infl uence measurements. The size of increase in bioaerosol level was dependent on the type of procedure being performed. A signifi cant increase in bioaerosol level was encountered during cavity preparation, ultrasonic scaling and tooth extraction. All these procedures are invasive and therefore generation of bioaerosol was not unexpected. In the present study, the highest level of bioaerosol occurred during cavity preparation, which contrasts with the fi ndings of Harrel and Molinari, 9 who found that use of an ultrasonic scaler produced the highest levels of airborne contamination. Micik et al. 11 found that air-turbine hand pieces, when used with air-water spray coolant, generated 20 times greater number of bacteria than air spray alone. With regard to scaling, Harrel et al. 19 stated that ultrasonic scaling produced higher aerosols when compared to hand scaling. The design of the relative clinics might have been an infl uencing factor on bioaerosol levels, as it could be hypothesised that large open-plan multi-chair clinics (Clinics 1 and 2 in the present study) would provide greater bioaerosol levels than a single chair clinic (Clinic 3) due to more air disturbance and potentially greater levels of bioaerosols from other locally performed procedures in the open-plan clinics. This was not however apparent given the higher recorded bioaerosol obtained from the extraction procedure (Clinic 3) compared with the history and oral examination procedure undertaken in Clinic 1. A further potential additional variable that needs to be considered is the possible variation in the levels of DUWL contamination which could adversely affect the loading of dental aerosols from the different dental units.",

Regardless of this, it can be concluded here that the IQ Air Flex Vac\u2122 ACS was effi cient at reducing the mean bacterial aerosols within a dental clinic. While the use of an ACS and such a reduction in bioaerosol may not be required in every setting, such equipment has been shown here, as a general principle, to provide a safer working environment. In this respect some clinics may wish to adopt such a standard of healthcare delivery.
