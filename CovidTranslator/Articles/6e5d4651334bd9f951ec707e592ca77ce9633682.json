However, their overuse has led to an increasing incidence of infections due to antibiotic-resistant microorganisms. Quantitative figures on the current economic and health impact of antimicrobial resistance are scant, but it is clearly a growing challenge that requires timely action. That action should be at the educational, ethical, economic and political level. An important first step would be to increase public awareness and willingness to take the necessary measures to curb resistance. Hence, studies are needed that would provide solid, quantitative data on the societal impact of antibiotic resistance. This review discusses the complexity of resistance, identifies its main drivers and proposes measures to contain it on a European scale. (W.T.M. Jansen).",

One of the greatest concerns with regard to antibiotic resistance is MRSA. The first MRSA emerged shortly after the introduction of \u2424-lactamase-stable penicillins, such as methicillin, in the early 1960s. However, it was in the late 1970s that series of epidemic MRSA strains evolved and have since spread throughout hospitals in the world. In the 1990s, community-associated (CA) MRSA emerged, which has now rapidly spread both in the hospitals and the community as documented by molecular epidemiological studies involving pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) (Kollef and Micek, 2006; Zetola et al., 2005) . PFGE is a suitable tool to investigate MRSA outbreaks because of its high discriminatory power (Robinson and Enright, 2004) . CA MRSA strains are a threat to healthy individuals too as they typically carry the Panton-Valentine leukocidine toxin, which is associated with necrotising pneumonia (Genestier et al., 2005) . The complete genome sequence of an epidemic CA MRSA clone, USA300, which is a major source of community-acquired infections in the USA, Canada, and Europe, revealed the presence of an additional virulence element, named arginine catabolic mobile element that encodes an arginine deiminase pathway and an oligopeptide permease system that could contribute to the fitness of that clone (Diep et al., 2006) .",

Five types of SCCmec have been described. SCCmec I, II and III are associated with HA MRSA, whereas SCCmec type IV and V are mainly found in CA MRSA. Since SCCmec IV and V do not contain any resistance genes except for mecA, CA MRSA are less multi-resistant than HA MRSA (Hanssen and Ericson Sollid, 2006) . Remarkably, in the US strains USA 400 (Sequence Type 1) and USA 300 (Sequence Type 8) are the most predominant CA MRSA, whereas in Australia and Europe mainly Sequence Type 30 and Type 80 are found, respectively (Chambers, 2005; Vandenesch et al., 2003) .",

These pathogens, although hardly virulent, are an increasing health concern given their intrinsic resistance to many antibiotics, including cephalosporins, and their ability to acquire resistance against the remaining antibiotics. Enterococci have readily gained resistance to a wide range of antibiotics, including fluoroquinolones, ampicillin, tetracyclins, macrolides, chloramphenicol, trimethoprim, quinopristin/dalfopristin and vancomycin, leaving very few treatment options (Bonten et al., 2001) . Recently, resistance against daptomycin was reported (Long et al., 2005) . Increasing numbers of severely ill patients in combination with increased use of these agents may fuel the clinical importance of multi-resistant enterococci. Enterococcus faecium is considered less pathogenic and is less frequently isolated than Enterococcus faecalis, but is nevertheless a growing clinical problem because of its potential to develop resistance against multiple antibiotics including linezolid (Bonora et al., 2006) . Daptomycin in combination with rifampicin may be a new effective therapy against multi-resistant enterococci (Pankey et al., 2005) .",

AR is a function of the relative risk (RR) and is defined as AR = (RR \u2212 1)/RR. Excess mortality (M) due to MRSA bacteremia can thus be formulated as: M = NI \u00d7 PM \u00d7 AR (Formula 1).

Despite many difficulties, much can be gained by combining efforts to institute broad surveillance networks. However, initiating new surveillance programs is costly. An alternative is to start with a central analysis of quality-assured, local surveillance data that are obtained anyway to guide antimicrobial therapy of individual patients.

Ideally, the veterinary sector should follow the DANMAP/VETSTAT approach. The environment may also function as a resistance reservoir. Costa et al. describe the presence of an \"antibiotic resistome\" among Actinomycetes (D'Costa et al., 2006) . These soil-dwelling bacteria are naturally resistant against a wide range of antibiotic in clinical use, by producing enzymes that inactivate at least 6 antibiotics, including rifampicin, synercid and daptomycin. The genes encoding these resistance elements may be horizontally transmitted to human pathogens. Such an event may have occurred for the vancomycin resistance determinants in VRE.",

Consequently, the modification of antibiotic consumption may be an important way to influence the incidence and prevalence of resistant bacteria. Since the emergence of resistance is intrinsically linked to the use of antibiotics, complete prevention of resistance is impossible. As defined by the Interagency Task Force on Antimicrobial Resistance, 'prudent use of antibiotics encourages maximal therapeutic impact while minimizing toxicity and the development of resistance' (2001). Prudent use, therefore, does not simply imply reduction in antibiotic consumption, but prevention of misuse and overuse. In this way, the life span of a single antibiotic can be extended, allowing more time for the development of new antibiotics and the implementation of other approaches to combat antimicrobial resistance. Prudent use of antibiotics may be especially important when resistance levels are still low, as the decline in resistance after treatment cessation is much slower than its emergence. The persistence of resistance may depend on the fitness cost of resistance and on the linkage of multiple resistance genes on mobile elements (Andersson, 2003) .",

The general public and farmers, who are often large-scale users of antimicrobial agents, politicians and healthcare workers, often have limited knowledge about the extent of the antibiotic-resistance problem and are generally not fully aware of the problems associated with antibiotic use. Medical microbiologists and infectious disease specialists play a central role in this education. However, even though the Union of European Medical Specialists has drawn up a Training Record & Training Program for candidates to be trained in medical microbiology and the European Society for Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (ESCMID) organizes courses for trainees from all over Europe, the training of these specialists is not harmonized within the EU (Grundmann and Goossens, 2005) . This lack of harmonization has led to dif-ferent opinions about the problem of antibiotic resistance. Harmonization can be achieved by providing scientific evidence. Therefore, monitoring of antibiotic consumption in combination with surveillance is necessary to acquire more insight into the complex interaction between antibiotic use and resistance. The data obtained should also be used for feedback to the prescribers to influence behaviour and to increase public awareness. Computer-assisted decision support programs for antimicrobial prescription may aid the physician in accurate antibiotic prescription. In combination with local surveillance data on antimicrobial susceptibility, programs can be tailor made to advice on empiric drug use on a local level. Promising results have been reported on stabilizing or reducing antibiotic resistance with such decision support programs (Burke and Pestotnik, 1999; Sintchenko et al., 2005) .",

This means that the societal cost is not a criterion in the manufacturing and consumption of antibiotics (Coast et al., 1998) . The level of willingness to balance current, individual benefits -perceived or realagainst future, societal costs is crucial in attempts to curb antimicrobial resistance. An economic concept that deals with future societal costs of antibiotic use, is the \"per dose annual loss\". This loss can be regarded as a virtual price tag, expressing the future societal costs for each single antibiotic prescription. The cost for society is due to increased antimicrobial resistance, which may lead to the use of more expensive antibiotics, increased hospitalisation, morbidity and mortality. This virtual price tag depends on the relation between antibiotic use and resistance, and the annual impact of resistance (Phelps, 1989 ). An antibiotic price tag may provide an indication for the magnitude of the resistance problem in relation to antibiotic use, and provides a handle to measure the cost-effectiveness of measures to promote prudent use of antibiotics.",

Countries that use this policy, The Netherlands and Scandinavia, have a low MRSA prevalence, which is an indication for the success of this approach (Wertheim et al., 2004) . But this policy is costly and there is little evidence about the necessity and efficacy of its individual components. Mathematical models suggest that a subset of measures may suffice to control MRSA prevalence in low-endemic settings. The models indicate that in a high-endemic setting appropriate measures can reduce MRSA levels (Bootsma et al., 2006; Pan et al., 2005) . A serious threat to the feasibility of this policy is the emergence of MRSA in the community, as this may have huge consequences for the capacity of a hospital to screen and isolate patients in order to maintain the search and destroy strategy.

The dearth of new antibiotics will form an important health threat in Europe in the next 20 years. Large pharmaceutical companies are moving away from the field of antibiotic development (Shlaes, 2003) . There are several reasons for this worrisome phenomenon. The development of a new antibiotic costs about D 500 mil-lion, takes 10-15 years and yields a product that is used for brief periods against targets that are prone to develop resistance. In addition, new drugs face restricting policies towards their use. How can incentives be improved for companies to reinvest in antibiotic development? Several measures can be considered, such as a faster registration process for new \"lastresort antibiotics\" (Abraham, 2002) , patent extension, joined non-profit research platforms (Nathan, 2004) , subsidies and tax-incentives (Nathan and Goldberg, 2005) .

Simplified scheme of different routes to develop new classes of antibiotics. The 'target-based' approach implies the development of new antibacterials starting from a unique bacterial target. This target may comprise essential or accessory (e.g. virulence) genes. Only a very limited number of (broad-spectrum) targets may exist. A 'compound-based' approach aims at identifying new lead compounds by means of screening compound libraries or human, bacterial or phage peptides with functional in vitro assays. In principle, small molecules are better drug candidates than, for example peptides. Thus, the resulting targets, small molecules and peptides have to be translated into (non-protein) lead compounds. This involves complex technology like structural biology, computer-assisted drug design and (combinatorial) chemistry. During the next cycles, lead compounds are optimised for functionality, minimal side effects and undesirable pharmacokinetic and dynamic properties. essential genes, for which loss of function is lethal for the bacterium, and accessory genes, such as virulence genes. Using structural biology and combinatorial chemistry, libraries of lead compounds can be generated and examined on their interaction with the bacterial target. In theory, this genomicsbased approach allows the rational design of antibiotics against novel, broad-spectrum targets to reduce the probability of emerging resistance (Chalker and Lunsford, 2002) . In practice, however, translating lead compounds into novel drugs has had limited success so far. The technology is still at its infancy and to date not a single marketed antibacterial agent has been discovered by this approach. Major bottlenecks are generating sufficient variants of a lead compound and predicting and improving efficacy and toxicity (Hughes, 2003) . Another limitation of the genomics-based approach is that it yields protein targets only, whereas some of the most important classes of antibiotics such as glycopeptides act on non-protein targets.",

Surveillance actions are to strengthen surveillance networks at the European level for both antimicrobial resistance and antibiotic consumption data. Prevention actions include educational campaigns, infection prevention programs (in particular vaccination) and reduction of antibiotic self-medication. The research actions should encourage the development of new antimicrobial agents, alternative treatments (vaccines) and rapid and reliable diagnostic tests. Finally, the EU seeks international co-operation, especially with the WHO, to promote rational use of antibiotics (Bronzwaer et al., 2004) . Another important step towards a unified approach against antimicrobial resistance is the recent foundation of the ECDC, which also has powers in the field of antimicrobial resistance.",

            "text": "Clearly, the EU and health care specialists recognize the threat of antimicrobial resistance. However, the public awareness remains low, as is the European budget to address this complex issue. The 'guestimates' on the surplus economic costs of MRSA bacteremia suggest that these annual costs alone already exceed the total European Union budget for antimicrobial resistance research for -2002 (European Commission, 2003 . Sufficient political resolve to implement effective counter-measures is crucial to tackle the resistance problem. An important prerequisite is to increase the public awareness of the resistance problem and to put it higher on European and national political agendas. This is hampered by the lack of quantitative data on the impact of resistance on public health. Hence, the first priority is to obtain these data (Fig. 3) . Although new classes of antibiotics are definitely needed, economic and scientific obstacles may hamper their development for the next 15 years. Thus, the focus should be on measures that prolong the life of current (and new) antibi- Fig. 3 . Intervention measures, their effect on resistance levels, and the most important relations with relevant outcome parameters. The colour scale from yellow to red indicates the need for low-to high-priority research, respectively. Infection prevention measures include hygiene-control and isolation policies in hospitals and vaccination programs in the community and veterinary sector. Antibiotic development implies the need for better technologies in order to develop new antibiotics and alternative strategies. Antibiotic use refers to prudent use in the hospitals, restricted use in the community (i.e. better compliance with the prohibition of over-the-counter sales of antibiotics), and therapeutic use only in the veterinary sector. Standardized evidencebased guidelines and education programs for healthcare professionals and the public are needed to implement intervention measures. Well-designed standardized surveillance programs are needed to study the cost-effectiveness of intervention measures in the hospital, the community, and other resistance reservoirs such as the veterinary sector. Resistance levels, in turn, should be linked to relevant outcome parameters like mortality, morbidity, economic costs of resistance, and cost-effectiveness of intervention measures. Finally, resistance dynamics should be analysed in relation to intervention measures using mathematical modelling, and the spread and mechanisms of resistance should be addressed by coupling resistance data to the genetic background of the strains. otics. For these intervention strategies, research is needed that can be translated into evidence-based guidelines to be implemented by the EU. Finally, much more fundamental knowledge is required to understand the spread and fitness of resistant bacteria at a genetic level. Based on these arguments, the essential areas of research can be prioritized as follows:",

Whereas medical experts seem willing to tackle the problem (Verhoef et al., 2004) , political willingness to provide the incentives and necessary legislation is crucial to curb resistance. A more thorough understanding on the societal impact of antibiotic resistance, both in clinical and economic terms, is essential to set the priorities.
