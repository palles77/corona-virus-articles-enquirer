However, nucleic acid detection is affected by factors such as insufficient kits, patients' immune status, disease course, and slow test reports, which complicate the diagnostic process. Chest high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) is an important method for detecting lung abnormalities. It plays an irreplaceable role in the screening of suspected patients, the diagnosis and differential J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f diagnosis of diseases, clinical classification, assessment of disease progression, detection of pulmonary complications, and follow-up after discharge [6] .",

Similar manifestations were also present in severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) infections, as shown in previous studies [8] [9] . In this study, the lesions of patients were mainly located in the lower lobe of the right lung. This finding may be related to the thick and short physiological structure of the right lower lobe bronchus, which may have allowed the virus to enter this area more easily. In addition, whether the air bronchogram is associated with the central representation needs further study. The lesions of patients were mostly distributed in peripheral zone of the lung (80.7%), probably because the virus mainly affects the terminal bronchioles and lung parenchyma around the respiratory bronchioles in the early stage [10] . In patients, GGO with a crazy paving pattern or interlobular septum thickening was the most common sign (48.8%), with PGGO (33.2%) the J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f second-most common. The lesions were mostly 1-3 cm patchy or nodular opacity (49.4%), and 56.2% of the lesions were accompanied with signs of air bronchogram.",

The lesions showed varying age-related differences in distributions of the lung lobe and lung field. With increase in age, the lesions appeared to be mostly GGO with interlobular septum thickening or a crazy paving pattern, and the possibility of the appearance of 5-10 cm large patchy opacity and \u226510 cm larger patchy opacity was likely to increase. Our study findings showed that middle-aged and older patients had more severe lung involvement and lobe involvement and, at the same time, the lesions were accompanied more often by air bronchograms. Possible reasons for these findings are as follows: 1) adolescent cases are mostly third-generation infection cases, which may involve mainly family cluster cases. Furthermore, COVID-19 has weak virulence, resulting in lighter imaging signs in these patients [7] ; 2) minors have immature lung structure development, resulting in atypical HRCT signs, and; 3) a COVID-19 attack on the immune system is more likely to cause diffuse alveolar damage and a large number of inflammatory exudations in middle-aged and older patients with more baseline diseases. In one patient, bilateral pleural effusion was found, which may be due to the adjacent inflammation stimulating the pleura.",

In this study, the key finding is that the middle-aged and elderly patients have the most severe representation of J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f parenchymal findings, and follow with the morphological appearance that seems to be particularly limited in youngest group, which provides certain support for clinical individualized treatment of patients of different ages. Chest HRCT scans are helpful for screening, treatment management, and follow-up evaluation of suspected patients with COVID-19 infections, and they are complementary to clinical symptoms (fever), epidemiological history (direct or indirect exposure to people from Wuhan), and laboratory indicators. Therefore, it is essential to make full use of chest HRCT scans to achieve a comprehensive diagnosis and guide treatment for patients with COVID-19 infection. It is worth noting that the epidemiological pre-test risk drives the diagnosis towards COVID-19, which otherwise does not have a specific pattern compared to any other infectious interstitial infiltrate with further diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) or organizing pneumonia (OP).",

Lesions of the right upper lobe were less common in patients in groups A and B than in patients in groups C (P=0.014, P=0.011) and D (P=0.006, P=0.003). Concerning involvement of the right middle lobe, lesions were more common in patients in group D than in those in groups A (P=0.039) and B (P=0.028). The number of lesions in the right lower lobe in different age groups was statistically significantly different (F=2.830, P=0.043), with patients in group A having fewer lesions in the right lower lobe than patients in groups B (P=0.009), C (P=0.008), and D (P=0.009). Furthermore, the distribution of lesions in the left upper (F=5.666, P=0.001) and left lower lobes (F=3.403, P=0.021) in different age groups was statistically significant. Among them, patients in group A and B showed less often lies in the left upper lobe compared to group C (P=0.004, P=0.002) and D (P=0.011, P=0.013). The involvement of lesions in the left lower lobe of patients in groups A (P=0.003) lower than that of patients in group C. In general, younger patients (especially group A) have fewer lung lesions than older patients (group C or D), which is reflected in any lobe (right upper lobe, right middle lobe, right lower lobe, left upper lobe, and left lower lobe) of the entire lung. But, the number of lesions in the left upper and lower lobes of infected patients was not statistically significant between groups A and B and groups C and D (P>0.05).Overall, 566 (80.7%) of 701 lesions were located in the peripheral zone. The involvement of peripheral lung lesions in group A was less than that in groups C (P=0.001) and D (P=0.005) (Table 4). The number of lesions distributed within this area in patients in group B were also less than those in patients in group C (P=0.009). There was no significant difference in the distribution of lesions in the central zone between patients of different ages (P>0.05). In addition, lesions involving both the peripheral and central zones were more common in patients in group D than in those in group B (P=0.049).",
