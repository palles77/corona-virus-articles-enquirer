The method uses cumulative reported case fatalities up to present time as input data. It is also described how the introduction of preventive measures of a given magnitude \u03c1 will affect the two incidence predictions, using basic theory of epidemic models. This methodology is then reversed, thus enabling estimation of the preventive magnitude \u03c1, and of the resulting effective reproduction number R E . However, the effects of preventive measures only start affecting case fatalities some 3-4 weeks later, so estimates are only available after this time has elapsed. The methodology is applicable in the early stage of an outbreak, before, say, 10% of the community have been infected.",

On the other hand, the methods presented here are much simpler and hence more transparent, thus allowing any reader to apply the methods to quickly obtain ball-park estimates for the most important parameters/quantities.

As our last cumulative death number we pick t 1 = March 24 and assume that the country of interest (with N = 30million) then had experienced 50 case fatalities (\u039b D (t 1 ) = 50). A prediction for the cumulative number of deaths by t = April 3 ( 10 days later) hence equals\u039b I (t) = \u039b D (t 1 )2 (t\u2212t 1 )/d = 50 * 2 10/3 = 500. We assume that s d , the typical time from getting infected to dying (assuming the individual dies from covid-19), equals 21 days, and that the infection fatality risk equals f = 0.3%. With these assumptions, the estimate of how many people that had been infected by t = March 3 (3 weeks earlier) equals\u039b I (t \u2212 s d ) = \u039b D (t)/f = 16 700. If we want to estimate how infected there are at t 1 = March 24, this number has to scaled up using the doubling times: \u039b I (t 1 ) = \u039b D (t 1 ) * 2 s d /3 /f = 2.1 million, thus approaching the limit of 10% where predictions should stop. Nedless to say, there is of course quite a lot of uncertainty in such 5 .

Then preventive measures are put in place, resulting in a prolonged doubling time of case fatalities starting (around) s d = 21 days later. Suppose that the new observed doubling time equals d E = 5 days. These two doubling times correspond to the exponential rates r = 0.23 and r E = ln(2)/5 = 0.14. If we first assume relation (1) to hold, this reduced exponential rate gives a lower bound the magnitude \u03c1 given by \u03c1 1 = (r \u2212 r E )g 1 /R 0 = 0.27. If we instead consider relation (2) we obtain the upper bound of the magnitude as \u03c1 2 = 1 \u2212 e (r\u2212r E )g 2 = 0.35. It hence follows that the magnitude \u03c1 of the preventive measure giving rise to an increased doubling time from d = 3 to d E = 5 days is estimated to lie somewhere in the interval (0.27, 0.35). The effective reproduction R E is hence estimated to lie between R 0 (1 \u2212 0.35) = 1.93 and R 0 (1 \u2212 0.27) = 2.19, so a substantial reduction.",

If preventive measures with magnitude \u03c1 = 1/3 are put in place during the early stage and kept all trough the outbreak, then the predicted final size instead equals \u03c4 E = 78% In the more likely case of a heterogeneous community the fractions should be deflated by about 20%. Similarly, the predicted total number of case fatalities is N f \u03c4 = and N f \u03c4 E respectively.

Without accurate knowledge of f , the prediction of the total case fatality once the epidemic outbreak is over, is equipped with a similar multiplicative uncertainty. It is hence of utmost importance to obtain more accurate estimates of f . The best way to obtain such estimates, now that seroprevalence tests are becoming available, is to conduct tests on a random sample of a community in which the outbreak is (close to) over. f is then simply estimated as the ratio of the total number of case fatalities and the estimated population number of people testing positive.",

A problem with this data is that there is a delay of about 3 weeks from getting infected to dying (for those who die). As a consequence, there is a more than 3 week delay before effects of interventions may be estimated. The same methodology can be used for data on cumulative number of patients having received intensive care (IC) treatment. The time from getting infected to the start of IC treatment (for those who need it) is around 2 weeks, thus making the delay shorter. This must be weighted against the often lower quality data for IC treatment as compared to reported deaths.",
