Reported are the S1 gene nucleotide and predicted amino acid sequences for the Florida 18288 strain and isolates GA-92, CV-56b, CV-9437, CV-1686, and 1013. These sequences were compared with previously published gene sequences of IBV strains, and phylogenetic relationships are reported. The S1 amino acid sequence of Florida 18288 was 94.9% similar to the Connecticut strain, and GA-92 was 92.8% similar to the Arkansas 99 strain. S1 amino acid sequences of the California variants, CV-56b, CV-9437, and CV-1686, were 97.6\u00b199.3% similar to one another and only 76.6%\u00b176.8% similar to the Arkansas-type strains. Isolate 1013, also from California, was 84.0% similar to Ark DPI and 77.9% similar to CV-56b. When comparing 19 viruses isolated from the United States, sequence variations were observed between amino acids 55\u00b196, 115\u00b1149, 255\u00b1309, and 378\u00b1395. Similar regions are reported to be involved in virusneutralizing and/or serotype-speci\u00aec epitopes. These data demonstrate that variant IBV strains continue to emerge, and unique variants may circulate among poultry in geographically isolated areas.",

These are the small membrane protein, the integral membrane glycoprotein, the phosphorylated nucleocapsid protein, and the spike (S) glycoprotein (4, 5) . The S glycoprotein is cleaved posttranslationally by cellular proteases into the S1 and S2 subunits (6) . The globular S1 subunit forms the tip of the spike, extending outwardly, whereas S2 anchors S1 to the viral membrane (7) . The S1 subunit is involved with infectivity and contains virus-neutralizing epitopes, serotype-speci\u00aec sequences, and hemagglutinin activity (7\u00b111). Different serotypes and subtypes of IBV are thought to be generated by nucleotide insertions, deletions, or point mutations in the S1 subunit made by the viral polymerase (12) . Another mechanism for variability in the S1 subunit may be RNA recombination (13\u00b116). Consequently, changes in the S1 subunit The nucleotide sequence data reported in this paper have been submitted to the GenBank nucleotide sequence database and have been assigned the accession numbers 1013 AF027508, CV-9437 AF027510, CV-1686 AF027511, CV56-b AF027509, FL18288 AF027512.",

The S1 gene nucleotide and predicted amino acid sequences of FL-18288 strain, GA-92, CV-56b, CV-9437, CV-1686, 1013 were determined, and compared with other IBV sequences. Although GA-92 has a unique RFLP pattern, it is serologically related to the Arkansas serotype (23) . Consistent with serologic data, we determined that the S1 glycoprotein sequence was 92.8% similar to the Ark 99 strain. Initial characterization of isolates from California obtained from poultry between 1984 and 1993 (including CV-56b) indicated these variant strains (designated California variants) were serologically distinct from other IBV serotypes (23, 24) . The epidemiology of California variants is unknown. It is unlikely that these California variants originated directly from a live vaccine virus because the S1 glycoprotein sequences are not closely related to other IBV strains. Recombination of genomic RNA also is unlikely because no crossover sites were observed in the S1 gene. We observed a genetic drift from CV-56b (1991) to CV-9437 (1995) and CV-1686 (1995) with 98.0% and 97.6% similarity, respectively. Based on RFLP patterns and sequence analysis, we predict that CV-9437 and CV-1686 are serologically similar to other California variants represented by CV-56b. Another isolate from California, 1013, has a unique RFLP pattern, and the S1 glycoprotein sequence was more similar to Ark DPI (84.0%) than CV-56b (77.9%).

Amino acid variation between residues 255\u00b1 309 and 378\u00b1395 are similar to region III (274\u00b1387) associated with one virus-neutralizing epitope in European strains using monoclonal antibody resistant (MAR) mutants (20) .

Amino acid variation in all three serotypes were observed at amino acids 91, 125, and 392. Amino acids 91 and 125 are within regions of variation, I and II, respectively. These regions are associated with two separate virus-neutralizing, conformationally dependent epitopes (20) . Amino acid 392 is within region III that is associated with one virus-neutralizing, serotype-speci\u00aec epitope.",

In addition, the S1 subunit may vary by 8% and remain the same serotype, whereas, a variation of only 4.2% may also change the serotype because of critical amino acid substitutions in the S1 glycoprotein. These data also demonstrate that variant IBV strains can circulate among poultry in geographically isolated areas.",
