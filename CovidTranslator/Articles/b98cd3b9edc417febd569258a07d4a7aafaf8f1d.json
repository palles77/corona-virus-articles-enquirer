            "text": "The past two decades have witnessed the emergence of several new and old respiratory tract infectious diseases, which threaten global health security due to their epidemic potential. 1,2 These include multi-drug resistant TB, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), avian and swine influenza and more recently the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS). MERS is a new zoonotic disease of humans caused by a coronavirus (MERS-CoV) which was first isolated in September, 2012 from a patient who died from a severe respiratory disease in Jeddah Saudi Arabia. 3 Since then MERS has attracted global media attention because it is associated with a high mortality (44%) in individuals who have co-morbidities such as diabetes, chronic renal, liver or lung illnesses or in those who are immunocompromised. 4, 5 The recent unprecedented outbreak of the MERS 6, 7 in South Korea which arose consequential to the importation of MERS-CoV by a South Korean traveler to the Middle East, alarmed global public health authorities and highlights the potential of MERS-CoV to spread across the globe and cause local outbreaks. The WHO Director general convened the ninth meeting of the Emergency Committee (EC) under the International Health Regulations regarding MERS-CoV on 16 June 2015 to discuss the Korean outbreak. 8 As of 23 rd June the total number of MERS cases reported from the Republic of South Korea now stands at 175 (94 currently receiving treatment, 54 recovered, 27 deaths. 6, 8 Of 175 cases, 80 patients and 33 hospital staff had contracted the virus nosocomially, 62 friends, colleagues and relatives had come in contact within healthcare facilities while visiting family members with MERS.",

A likely explanation may be that this may simply reflect the lack of clinical awareness of exposure risk, diagnosis and treatment of respiratory tract infections largely remains clinically based and empiric in most SSA countries coupled with absence of surveillance. 14 Every year an estimated 10 million pilgrims from over 182 countries travel to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to participate in Hajj pilgrimage, the mini-pilgrimage Umrah (which is performed at any time of the year), or for the month of Ramadaan. 16 Of these, an estimated 1 million pilgrims come from sub-Saharan African countries. There were no cases of MERS reported during the 2012, 2013 and 2014 Hajj pilgrimages or the Ramadaan period. [17] [18] [19] However, the risk of MERS-CoV spreading globally remains due to the continuous influx of pilgrims and the persistent low levels of endemic MERS-CoV transmission to humans in Saudi Arabia. There is also the possibility that MERS-CoV may mutate into a form more adaptable for human to human transmission over time.",

Their estimates based on the most likely scenario using recent pilgrim numbers for sub-Saharan Africa are that there will be at most ten returning pilgrims each year with MERS-CoV infections. National surveillance systems should be on alert for the low but long-lasting risk of MERS-CoV infected pilgrims returning from the Umrah throughout the year, and also for the large numbers of refugees at several conflict zones in the Middle East (those migrating from Syria to Turkey and from the Yemen border into Saudi Arabia and beyond). The recent MERS outbreak in the Republic of Korea was associated with secondary, tertiary, quarternary and quinary cases of MERS-CoV transmission, though fortunately there has been no sustained community transmission. 6, 8 The Republic of Korea MERS-CoV outbreak has many similarities with that of previously reported MERS-CoV outbreaks which occurred at healthcare facilities in several cities in Saudi Arabia and from Jordan 21-24 which were all associated with breaches and gaps in infection prevention and control protocols.",

All healthcare workers and travellers from Africa to the Middle East should be aware of the threat to global health security posed by MERS-CoV. Considering a diagnosis of MERS at first presentation may be difficult due to non-specific symptoms at clinical presentation. However it is important that prevention and control measures are instituted at first consideration of MERS as a diagnosis to prevent spread of MERS-CoV. Hospitals and clinics providing care for patients infected with suspected or confirmed MERS-CoV infection should take appropriate measures to decrease the risk of MERS-CoV transmission from the infected patient to other patients, doctors, nurses, allied health-care workers, relatives and visitors. Health-care workers should be educated and trained in infection prevention and control and should have continuing professional development on these issues.",

More effective national, regional, and international surveillance systems are required to enable rapid identification of emerging respiratory epidemics, diseases with epidemic potential, their specific microbial cause, origin, mode of acquisition, and transmission dynamics.",
