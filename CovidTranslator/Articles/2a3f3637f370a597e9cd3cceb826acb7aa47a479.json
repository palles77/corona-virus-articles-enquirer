Recombinant baculovirus did not differ From wild-type baculovirus in any fusion experiment (Figs. 1F-H and 2B) . Syncytia formation was preceded by both a commitment step and a membrane fusion step. Exposure of cells to pH 5.1 for only 10 s resulted in significant syncytia formation at one hour (Fig. 2C) . Transfer of the lipophilic dyes R-18 and Di-l, as well as rhodamine-labeled phosphatidyi ethanolamine, could be detected well before the morphological changes seen as syncytia in any given pair of cells (Fig. lI,J) . Many pairs of ceils could be seen with dye transfer but lacking syncytia. Using cell capacitance to measure surface area, cell-cell fusion was detected by the doubling of surface area for pairs of cells, tripling for three cells fusing together, etc. (Fig. 3A) . This quantal capacitance increase which occurred prior to the morphological changes seen as syncytia formation, has the complex admittance characteristic of a true syncytia (Fig, 3B ). [4, 6] . Vialard and colleagues report fewer syncytia with wild type than measles-recombinant proteins, testing 72 h after infection [5] . Since they use pH 5.8 to trigger fusion, it is likely that the exogenous fusion protein plays a role. However, using the baculovirus system to study the mechanism or identity of exogenous recombinant Relationship between whole.cell capacitan~, measured 15 min after lowering pH, and number ore.ells in the cell aggregate which included the patch-clamped c\u00a211. Linear regression (shown as a solid line with 95% confidence bands) yields an average value of 21 pF for single cell capacitance, which compares well to that measured for single c\u00a2l/s (19 _+ 0, 9) . We used the cell medium as external aolution and a KCI buffer as internal solution (150 mM KCI, ? ,'riM MgCh, 10 mM HEPES, 1 mM EGTA, pH 7.2), B. The imaginary part of whole.cell admittance, normalized with respect to the angular velocity, is given for a number ofcells in mutual contact, The whole-cell recording technique was used on one cell [91, Zero frequency intercepts estimate different capacitance values before and after lowering pH, P~udo-random binary voltage signals (0-10 mY), having a quasiwhite spectral density (5 kHz bandwidth), were used to determine the complex admittance of the cell membrane [13] , The measured admittance was consistent with the simple equivalent circuit of a series resistance of the pipette and a parallel capacitor/resistor of a single syncytial membrane (inset, showing prediction of this circuit). viral fusion proteins may be problematic, For exa.mple, exogenous fusion proteins may form cooperative units with the endogenous baculoviral fusion protein, or binding may shift pH dependence. As in influenza HA-mediated cell-cell fusion, constant acidification is not longer needed for subsequent fusion [10] . Cell capacitance changes are seen prior to morphological changes, as in membrane fusion in exocytosis [11] . The fusion demonstrated here may be an extremely convenient system for studying enveloped viral mediated cell--cell fusion.",

Probably a baculovirus-encoded, pH-dependent fusion protein is expressed in the plasma membrane of infected cells, to be incorporated in the viral envelope after capsid budding for subsequent viral infectivity. Volkman and colleagues have implicated a 64K envelope glycoprotein as fusion protein, and the shift in baculoviral life cycle from budding to polyhedra is accompanied by a loss of a 64K glycoprotein from the viral envelope [8]. Different stage of viral life cycle, cell density, or innoculum may explain the lack of cell-cell fusion seen in other reports"
