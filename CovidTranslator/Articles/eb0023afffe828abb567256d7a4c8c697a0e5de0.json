To elucidate the epidemiological characteristics of bat HVs in southern China, 520 fecal samples from eight bat species were collected in four geographic regions of southern China. Of these samples, 73 (14.0 %) tested positive for HVs using nested polymerase chain reaction assay. Phylogenetic analysis revealed a high degree of molecular diversity of HVs in bats of different species from different geographic regions. Our study provides evidence for co-evolution of bats and HVs.",

In 2007, Wibbelt and co-workers first confirmed the presence of HVs in bats [7] . Recently, several studies have documented the high prevalence of HVs with diverse genetic characteristics in bats originating from the Philippines, Madagascar, Cambodia, Indonesia, Japan, Germany, and Hungary [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] . In 2012, four new HVs, two betaherpesviruses and two gammaherpesviruses, were identified in bats in China, using sequence-independent PCR amplification and next-generation sequencing technology, targeting the concatenated glycoprotein B (gB) and DNA-directed DNA polymerase (DPOL) genes of HVs [13] . However, there is a paucity of knowledge regarding the prevalence and phylogenetic characteristics of bat-derived HVs in mainland China. Furthermore, little is known about the tissue distribution and the route of viral shedding of bat herpesviruses.",

[11] and Razafindratsimandresy et al. [9] . When compared with viruses of the same subfamily with previously reported sequences, only 39.2-71.3 % and 50.3-81.0 % sequence identity was observed in the DPOL and gB gene region, respectively. This indicated that although the HVs identified in our study could be classified in the same genus with other published bat HVs, their relationship might be phylogenetically distinct. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that 73 isolates of bat HVs, based on DPOL amino acid analysis, belonged to the subfamilies Betaherpesvirinae or Gammaherpesvirinae. No viruses of the subfamily Alphaherpesvirinae were found in our study. This might be due to low prevalence or viral loads of Alphaherpesvirinae members in fecal samples of bats. Further studies are needed to clarify this issue.",
