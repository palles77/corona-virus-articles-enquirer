In general, circulating T cells exceed B cells by a ratio of approximately four to one, with that ratio increasing slightly with age (Table 49 .1). Natural killer (NK) cells are grouped with lymphocytes but comprise only about 10% of the lymphocyte population. Infants have total lymphocyte counts between 5500/\u00b5L and 7000/\u00b5L, but this number declines beginning at about 1 year of age to reach 2000/\u00b5L to 2400/\u00b5L in adults. At birth, the total number of circulating B cells is approximately 1000/\u00b5L but decreases over the first 10 years of life to approximately 200/\u00b5L to 300/\u00b5L by the age of 18 years. A slow decline in circulating B cells continues throughout adulthood and is primarily accounted for by a decline in transitional and naive B cells with a stable or mild increase in circulating memory B-cell numbers with age. Circulating naive B cells represent about two-thirds of the entire naive B-cell pool, and circulating memory B cells represent only about one third of the entire memory B-cell pool. 1 T cells dominate the circulating lymphocyte population with approximately 3500/\u00b5L in infancy, declining to 1500/\u00b5L on average in young adults, with even lower numbers (approximately 1200/\u00b5L) in elderly adults. In both children and adults, CD4 cells outnumber CD8 cells. Naive CD4 and CD8 T cells decline with age by twofold to fourfold. In one large study, CD4 memory T cells significantly increased with age, but no such trend was seen for CD8 memory T cells. 2 Against this background, lymphocytosis is defined as a lymphocyte count greater than 8000/\u00b5L in young children and greater than 4000/\u00b5L in teenagers and adults. Lymphocytopenia has been defined as a total lymphocyte count of less than 1000/\u00b5L. Given the composition of the circulating lymphocyte pool, it is critically important to define which lymphocyte subsets are over-or underrepresented when there is a quantitative disorder. 2",

One recently identified inherited lymphocytosis is BENTA disease (B-cell expansion with nuclear factor kappa-B [NF\u03baB] and T-cell anergy). Germline gain of function mutations in caspase-activating recruitment domain 11 (CARD11) drive this disorder, which is characterized by polyclonal lymphocytosis and splenomegaly beginning in infancy. In most cases of lymphocytosis, however, the issue is to determine whether a lymphocyte disorder is clonal/ malignant or benign and related to infection, drugs, or physiologic stress. Rarely, neither a malignancy nor an underlying condition can be identified, in which case the lymphocytosis is termed persistent polyclonal B-cell lymphocytosis. When an excess of B cells exists, clonality can usually be defined by examining cell surface expression of \u03baand \u03bb-light chains using antibody techniques; with T-cell proliferation, it may be important to define clonality by examining T-cell receptor gene rearrangement using molecular procedures. In the case of NK cell disorders, clonality can be quite difficult to determine.",

Data demonstrate that up to 10% to 15% of patients with lymphocytosis have MBL. Three major subtypes of MBL exist: the CLL immunophenotype (CD5 + , CD23 + ), which is by far the most common; the atypical CLL type (CD5 + , CD23 \u2212 ); and non-CLL lymphoproliferative disorder (CD5 \u2212 ). In a systematic study of blood donors more than 45 years of age, 7.1% had detectable MBL. Of these, the majority had the CLL immunophenotype and more than 93% were low-count MBL (B-cell clonal count less than 500 cells/\u00b5l). Similar to the relationship between monoclonal gammopathy of uncertain significance and multiple myeloma, only a small proportion of patients with CLL-type MBL (1% to 4% per year) go on to develop progressive disease requiring treatment. Epidemiologic studies of MBL patients have demonstrated strong familial risk for CLL, and the first reports of MBL came from studies of \"unaffected\" CLL family members. Studies of CLL families suggest that there is an inherited abnormality that increases the risk of developing CLL, and some families exhibit anticipation, with the disease occurring earlier in successive generations. The supposition that MBL is a progenitor lesion for CLL is strengthened by the observation that both low-count and high-count MBL carry the same cytogenetic aberrations observed in good-prognosis CLL. MBL has been identified in up to 30% of individuals infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV), and up to 50% of the HCV-associated cases demonstrate the atypical CLL immunophenotype. The presence of MBL correlates with more advanced liver disease, suggesting that the persistence of viral infection is crucial to development of the B-cell clone. Follow-up for MBL patients is not clearly defined, although it is probably reasonable to evaluate lymphocyte counts with complete blood counts and follow the clone with flow cytometry at periodic",

After strenuous physical exercise, subjects develop lymphocytosis, which returns to preexercise levels within 15 minutes to 1 hour of ceasing the activity. The exercise-induced rise is thought to be attributable to catecholamine and steroid hormones, and their effect on expression of cell adhesion molecules and on cardiac output and shear stress. 5 Exposure to catecholamines increases the expression of \u03b2 2 -adrenergic receptors on lymphocytes influencing cell trafficking. Reports suggest that a number of other physiologic stresses increase lymphocyte counts, including surgery, trauma, cardiac conditions, sickle cell crises, abdominal pain, and obstetric emergencies. In these cases, all lymphocyte subsets appear to increase, but the increase is most profound for CD4 and CD8 memory T cells. Neutrophil counts also rise in these patients, but in most cases, the lymphocytosis resolves before the peak of the neutrophil count. 6 ",

            "text": "The most common infections causing lymphocytosis are Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and cytomegalovirus (CMV). In young children, EBV infection frequently presents as an upper respiratory infection, but in adolescents and young adults, it can result in acute glandular fever with pharyngitis, splenomegaly, lymphadenitis, and profound reactive lymphocytosis. Lymphocytosis is less prominent in older adults. Although the B cells are targeted by EBV, the lymphocytosis consists of CD8 + lymphocytes reacting to neoantigens expressed on the surface of infected B cells. The massive T-cell response usually clears the infection in a matter of days to 1 week, and the lymphocytosis resolves. CMV infection can produce a similar lymphocytosis. In the case of CMV, however, the macrophages are the target of infection, and the T-cell lymphocytosis results from a response to the macrophage neoantigen. CMV infection and lymphocytosis are more common in older adults. In both viral infections, lymphocytosis can be profound, with 50% or more of the circulating white blood cells (WBCs) identified as lymphocytes. Examination of the peripheral smear reveals that up to 10% of the circulating lymphocytes are atypical and larger than normal lymphocytes with open chromatin and increased cytoplasm. It is particularly important to recognize lymphocytosis caused by these two viruses in pregnant women because congenital infection can cause fetal death and birth defects. In addition to EBV and CMV, primary infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) can cause lymphocytosis and should be suspected in the presence of a viral syndrome in the appropriate clinical circumstance. In children, infection with Coxsackie A and B6 viruses, echovirus, and adenovirus can cause a brief but profound lymphocytosis. Infections with other viruses, including human herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6) and human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8) as well as rubella virus, varicella, human T-lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1), and hepatitis viruses, can cause a lymphocytosis, although much less frequently than CMV and EBV. Important nonviral infections causing lymphocytosis include Toxoplasma gondii and Bordetella pertussis. In an immune-competent host, Toxoplasma infection is often asymptomatic, but patients can have fever, chills, and lymphadenopathy. Mild lymphocytosis with atypical lymphocytes can be observed. As in the case of EBV and CMV, infections during pregnancy can lead to adverse effects on the fetus. In children and adults, infection with B. pertussis can lead to lymphocytosis, with the absolute lymphocyte count frequently greater than 10,000/\u00b5L. In more severe cases, lymphocytosis is more pronounced. 4 Unlike viral infections and Toxoplasma infection, the lymphocytosis observed in B. pertussis infection is caused by increases in all lymphocyte subsets, and it appears that the pertussis toxin blocks migration of the lymphocytes from the bloodstream into lymph nodes. 4 Tuberculosis, rickettsial infection, brucellosis, and shigellosis may also cause lymphocytosis. of patients with ataxia telangiectasia, with mutations leading to absent expression of ATM kinase activity. 11 Heterozygous germline mutations in GATA2 lead to a spectrum of clinical syndromes characterized by dendritic cell, monocyte, B cell, and NK lymphoid deficiency (DCML deficiency) with elevated 3 ligand (Flt3L). Mononuclear cytopenia appears to evolve in diverse clinical groups of GATA2 mutation including monoMAC syndrome (monocytopenia, B-cell and NK-cell lymphopenia, mycobacterial, fungal, and viral infections and alveolar proteinosis), Emberger syndrome (lymphedema, deafness, and myelodysplastic syndrome [MDS]) and familial (MDS)/acute myeloid leukemia (AML) 12 . GATA2 mutation appears to cause loss of progenitor cells, clonal hematopoiesis and elevation of Flt3L, but the molecular mechanisms of marrow failure and transformation to MDS or AML are as yet unclear.",

The target of HIV is the CD4 receptor, and the virus selectively targets and infects activated expanding CD4 T cells. Large studies in HIVinfected patients have shown that peripheral blood CD4 T-cell counts fall most rapidly in the year after seroconversion (from approximately 1000/\u00b5L before seroconversion to 670/\u00b5L at 1 year after infection) and then decline more slowly by about 50/\u00b5L per year. 13 In a subset of untreated patients, viremia is absent or well controlled, and lymphocytopenia develops very slowly if at all; particular HLA class I alleles are overrepresented in this group. Lymphopenia is an early and reliable laboratory observation in adult influenza infection and is also detected in infections caused by swine influenza (H1N1) and the highly pathogenic avian influenza (H5N1). 14 Lymphopenia has been reported in patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) caused by the SARS-coronavirus. In children, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection is associated with a reduction in lymphocyte count, which is most extreme in the sickest patients; similar effects on lymphocyte counts are seen in measles infections (also a paramyxovirus). In West Nile virus encephalitis, lymphopenia is profound and prolonged, and the initial degree of lymphopenia is predictive of outcome. A variety of other viruses can also cause lymphopenia, including herpes viruses (herpes simplex, HHV-6, HHV-8), parvovirus B19, and Dengue virus. In many viral infections, the degree of lymphopenia is correlated with the severity of the disease. 14 A variety of nonviral infections cause lymphopenia. Infections with Ehrlichia (a tick-borne obligate intracellular gram-negative bacteria), Salmonella typhi, and Leptospira have all been reported to cause lymphocytopenia during the acute illness. CD4 + T-cell depletion has been described in a subset of HIV-negative patients with tuberculosis and low albumin levels, low body weight, and more extensive disease. Recovery of CD4 count after treatment of tuberculosis suggests that the lymphopenia is caused by the tuberculosis infection. 15 Lymphocytopenia is often observed in sepsis and is thought to occur as a result of cytokine-mediated apoptosis of B cells, CD4 and CD8 T cells, and follicular dendritic cells. In autopsy series, most deaths from sepsis occur during the prolonged hypoimmune state, and the more prolonged the sepsis, the more profound the loss of splenic lymphocytes. In one large retrospective study, severe persistent lymphopenia (defined as an absolute lymphocyte count of less than 600 cells/\u00b5L) on the fourth day following a diagnosis of sepsis was predictive of development of secondary infections, as well as short-and long-term survival. 16 ",

This suggests that PPBL may arise from deregulation of the microenvironmment or from a defect in a different B-cell activation pathway resulting in extensive proliferation.

Chief among these disorders is severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID), which is characterized by the absence of functional T lymphocytes. T lymphocytes, B lymphocytes, and NK cells share progenitors, signaling pathways in development and function, and metabolic pathways; thus B lymphocytes, NK cells, or both are often severely affected in SCID. Moreover, in the absence of functional CD4 + T-helper lymphocytes, B lymphocytes cannot function properly, and hypo-or agammaglobulinemia is observed. In most cases of SCID, the absence of T lymphocytes leads to an extremely low absolute lymphocyte count. As detailed in Chapter 49, SCID can be grouped based on the cellular pathway that is affected. In general, whereas SCID is characterized by complete loss of function of the affected gene, hypomorphic mutations of the same genes lead to quite different phenotypes (Omenn syndrome and atypical SCID). Defects in more than 30 genes are known to lead to SCID. Inheritance is primarily X-linked or autosomal recessive, but in a few cases, such as the DiGeorge anomaly and some cases of Hoyeraal-Hreidarsson syndrome (defects in telomerase), inheritance is autosomal dominant.

Defects that lead to increased lymphocyte apoptosis (AK2, ADA gene mutations) lead to T \u2212 B \u2212 NK \u2212 SCID and are often associated with anomalies outside of the immune system. Defects in thymic embryogenesis and calcium flux, as well as a collection of other abnormalities, including defects in telomerase activity, can also lead to SCID and are usually associated with abnormalities of other organ systems. 9 In addition to SCID, other inherited disorders can also perturb T-and B-cell numbers. Patients with Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome, caused by mutations in WASP (which encodes a cytoplasmic protein responsible for transducing cell surface signals to the actin cytoskeleton), can present with low T-cell counts early in life and become profoundly lymphopenic over time. Abnormalities in immunoglobulins are also noted in this syndrome, with low levels of IgM and high levels of IgA and IgE. 10 Immunodeficiency affects more than half of all patients with ataxia telangiectasia. Patients with ataxia telangiectasia have homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations in the ataxia-telangiectasia-mutated (ATM) gene, which encodes a protein kinase with functions in the cellular response to DNA damage. Lymphopenia, especially of naive CD4 cells, is observed in about half",

Glucocorticoids inhibit production of a number of cytokines and rapidly deplete circulating T cells by enhancing emigration from the circulation, inducing apoptosis, interfering with growth signaling, and inhibiting release from lymphoid tissues. B cells are less affected acutely by glucocorticoid administration, but prolonged administration may result in decreased IgG levels. In clinical trials for multiple sclerosis, delayed release dimethyl fumarate resulted in a decrease in mean lymphocyte count of about 30% in the first year, but about 2% of patients had lymphocyte counts less than 500 cells/\u00b5L which persisted for 6 months or longer. Antimetabolite chemotherapeutic agents such as methotrexate, azathioprine, and 6-mercaptopurine lower lymphocyte as well as neutrophil counts, and alkylating agents such as cyclophosphamide have more profound effects on lymphocytes. Purine nucleoside analogs, including cladribine, fludarabine, pentostatin, nelarabine, clofarabine, and others, inhibit DNA synthesis and repair, and cause accumulation of DNA strand breaks. All of these agents are associated with profound lymphopenia, which may persist for several years after completion of treatment. In general, T cells are more affected than B cells. Nelarabine in particular is a prodrug of ara-G and is converted to ara-GTP, which accumulates at higher levels in T cells. 21 Monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies directed against lymphocytes are useful in clinical practice and can induce profound and long-lasting lymphopenia. Whereas antithymocyte globulin and alemtuzumab produce depletion of both T and B cells, the monoclonal antibodies OKT3, daclizumab, and basiliximab produce a more pronounced decrease in T cells. The drugs rituximab and ofatumumab are monoclonal antibodies directed against distinct epitopes on B cells. These drugs deplete peripheral B cells but do not routinely produce lymphopenia.",

Malnutrition, malabsorption, and any disease state in which large amounts of protein are lost, such as nephrotic range proteinuria, severe burns, lymphangiectasia, or protein-losing enteropathy, can overwhelm the capacity of the B cells to provide adequate immunoglobulin to patients at diagnosis, with the cumulative incidence over the course of the disease reaching over 90%. Lymphopenia in SLE seems to be more frequent in patients of African descent, and in one study more than half of patients with lymphopenia demonstrated antilymphocyte antibodies. Antigalectin 8 antibodies have been described in patients with SLE, rheumatoid arthritis, and sepsis. In SLE, these autoantibodies are associated with lymphopenia. Apoptosis may also play a role in lymphopenia in SLE, possibly by upregulation of fas antigen on naive peripheral T cells. 17 CD4 T cells may also be decreased in rheumatoid arthritis, and increasing evidence suggests that deficiencies in DNA repair enzymes such as ATM render rheumatoid arthritis T cells sensitive to apoptosis. 18 Apoptotic loss of naive T cells results in lymphopenia-induced proliferation to preserve T-cell homeostasis; this proliferation is now thought to lead to both premature immune aging and an autoimmune-biased T-cell repertoire. In Sj\u00f6gren syndrome, a minority of patients has been noted to have deficient CD4 counts, and this has been correlated with the presence of anti-CD4 antibodies. Similarly, low lymphocyte counts have been observed in patients with primary vasculitides, type 1 diabetes, and Crohn disease. 17 ",

Lymphopenia occurs in more than 50% of sarcoidosis patients and is associated with chronic disease.

Female carriers of a Btk mutation are generally asymptomatic, but most boys with XLA come to clinical attention by the age of 1 year.

            "text": "The differential diagnosis of monoclonal gammopathy includes monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS), multiple myeloma, solitary plasmacytoma of bone or extramedullary plasmacytoma, Waldenstr\u00f6m macroglobulinemia, lymphoma, CLL, and primary systemic amyloidosis. These individual disorders are described elsewhere in this text; however, there are a few points to be made about the M protein itself and MGUS. These disorders can produce intact immunoglobulins (IgG, IgM, IgD, or IgE), \u03ba-, or \u03bb-light chains alone or in combination with intact immunoglobulins and rarely heavy chains only. The monoclonal protein is usually detected as a discrete band in the \u03b3 or \u03b2 region in serum or urine recurrent bacterial infection, as well as opportunistic infections with organisms similar to those observed in acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). Defects in the activation-induced cytidine deaminase gene (AID) produce hypogammaglobulinemia with recurrent bacterial infections and diarrhea, as well as enlarged lymphoid organs filled with proliferating B cells. A similar clinical picture is produced by homozygous defects in uracil-DNA glycosylase (UNG). AID is thought to deaminate cytosine to uracil, and UNG subsequently deglycosylates and removes the uracil residue, creating an abasic site, which allows for creation of single-stranded DNA breaks. Deficiencies in these enzymes result in defective class switching and somatic hypermutation. Patients with similar phenotypes but without defects in AID or UNG have been described and probably have mutations in other essential genes involved in class switching. 26 Additional groups of antibody deficiencies exist in which overall antibody levels are normal, but there are defects in specific isotypes, light chains, or specific antibodies with normal numbers of B cells; the majority of patients with these deficiencies are healthy. The most common member of these groups is selective IgA deficiency, which occurs in about 1 in 500 white individuals. The molecular mechanisms underlying this deficiency are unknown, but there is an association with CVID. Finally, an entity termed transient hypogammaglobulinemia of infancy has been described in which the normal decline in immunoglobulins after maternal transfer is prolonged. This entity is poorly understood and usually affects boys, who have mild infections and diarrhea. Recovery usually, but not always, occurs by 3 years of age. 27",

The distinction between polyclonal and monoclonal disorders is made by inspection of the serum protein electrophoretic pattern. Detection of one or several monoclonal bands within a polyclonal background is not unusual, and the literature suggests that small bands frequently disappear and do not become clinically relevant. No data are available to suggest that polyclonal gammopathy drives development of monoclonal gammopathy; however, if a clonal plasmaproliferative disorder is suspected, immunofixation or immunoelectrophoresis should be performed.",

In general, treatment is directed at the underlying disease, but there are reports of polyclonal gammopathy leading to symptomatic hyperviscosity. In these cases, plasmapheresis and/or corticosteroids seem to be effective. It should also be noted that polyclonal elevations in serum immunoglobulins can sometimes interfere with the direct Coombs test, possibly via nonspecific antibody binding to red blood cells. The degree of gamma globulin elevation does not seem to be helpful in defining the underlying disease state.",
