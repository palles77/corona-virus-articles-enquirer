Most coronaviruses show a strong species specificity, although the SARS-Coronavirus crossed species from palm civet cats to infect humans. Similarly, HCoV-OC43, likely a member of the same coronavirus group as SARS-CoV, readily crossed the species barrier as evidenced by its rapid adaptation to the murine brain [McIntosh, K., Becker, W.B., Chanock, R.M., 1967. Growth in suckling-mouse brain of ''IBV-like'' viruses from patients with upper respiratory tract disease. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 58, 2268 -73]. Herein, we investigated two consequences of this plasticity in species tropism. First, we showed that HCoV-OC43 was able to infect cells from a large number of mammalian species. Second, we showed that virus that was passed exclusively in suckling mouse brains was highly virulent and caused a uniformly fatal encephalitis in adult mice. The surface glycoprotein is a major virulence factor in most coronavirus infections. We identified three changes in the HCoV-OC43 surface glycoprotein that correlated with enhanced neurovirulence in mice; these were located in the domain of the protein responsible for binding to host cells. These data suggest that some coronaviruses, including HCoV-OC43 and SARS-CoV, readily adapt to growth in cells from heterologous species. This adaptability has facilitated the isolation of HCoV-OC43 viral variants with markedly differing abilities to infect animals and tissue culture cells.",

Since then, two additional coronaviruses, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1, have been identified; these agents cause upper and lower respiratory tract diseases that are much less severe than SARS (van der Hoek et al., 2004; Woo et al., 2005) .",

All rights reserved. doi:10.1016/j.virol.2005.11.044 tissue culture cells. For example, Talbot and co-workers showed, using the mouse-adapted virus after passage in tissue culture cells (termed HCoV-OC43 QUE herein;) that mice infected intranasally with 10 4 -10 5 TCID 50 developed encephalitis if inoculated 8 days but not 21 days postnatally (Jacomy and Talbot, 2003) . HCoV-OC43 QUE was passaged 5-6 times in tissue culture prior to use in mice (personal communication, Dr. Pierre Talbot, INRS-Institut Armand-Frappier, Laval, Quebec) and consequently may be less virulent than virus isolated directly from infected suckling mouse brains. Consistent with this possibility, we observed, in preliminary experiments, that virus directly harvested from suckling mouse brains caused a lethal infection after intranasal inoculation of 5-to 8-week-old mice. Mice died 9 -11 days after inoculation, a time when the adaptive immune response to another coronavirus, mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), is maximal (Bergmann et al., 1999) . To begin to understand these differences in virulence, we initiated a more complete study of the disease caused by the neurovirulent strain of HCoV-OC43.",

            "text": "This ability of HCoV-OC43 to cross species barriers to infect mice and to gain virulence in the new host contrasts with the strict species specificity exhibited by most coronaviruses. For example, the group I coronavirus HCoV-229E does not readily infect mice, even transgenic mice expressing human aminopeptidase N, the virus receptor for HCoV-229E (Wentworth et al., 2005) . However, the ability of the group II coronavirus HCoV-OC43 to adapt easily to replication within the murine brain suggests that it may be more lax in its species specificity than other coronaviruses. In that sense, it resembles another group II coronavirus, SARS-CoV, which likely crossed the species barrier from animals such as palm civet cats to infect humans (CSMEC, 2004; Guan et al., 2003; Song et al., 2005) . Unlike other coronaviruses, HCoV-OC43 and the closely related bovine coronavirus (BCoV) appear to bind to cells via N-acetyl-neuraminic acid (Schultze and Herrler, 1992; Vlasak et al., 1988) , although there are data to suggest that HCoV-OC43 can also employ MHC class I antigen as a host cell receptor (Collins, 1993) . This use of a sugar moiety for entry would also be consistent with the ability to infect a broader range of species than most coronaviruses. This possibility was investigated by infecting tissue culture cells from several different animal species with HCoV-OC43, using both the mouse-adapted and the tissue culture-adapted strains.",

Passage of neurovirulent variants of MHV, in tissue culture, selects for viruses that are attenuated in vivo but enhanced for replication in vitro. These changes map to the surface (S) glycoprotein (Gallagher and Buchmeier, 2001; Tsai et al., 2003) . In addition, infection of rats with uncloned stocks of MHV resulted in the selection of virulent strains of virus; again, virulence correlated with changes in the S protein (Taguchi et al., 1985) . Also, replacement of the S gene in the moderately virulent A59 strain of MHV with the gene encoding the S protein of the virulent JHM strain resulted in a gain in virulence in mice (Phillips et al., 1999) . In other studies, several groups showed that the adaptation of the SARS-CoV to humans during the 2003 epidemic included several mutations in the S protein. These mutations were shown to enhance binding to human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE 2), the host cell receptor for SARS-CoV (Kan et al., 2005; Li et al., 2005) . Therefore, to investigate the role of the S protein in HCoV-OC43 pathogenesis, we sequenced the S genes of HCoV-OC43 TC and HCoV-OC43 NV and compared the results to published sequences of the S genes of several other HCoV-OC43 isolates.",

Mice developed signs of acute encephalitis, including hunched posture, lethargy and wasting by days 6-7. Mortality was associated with a 30 -35% loss of body mass (Fig. 1B) . Severe clinical encephalitis was associated with widespread mononuclear cell infiltration including perivascular cuffing and with loss of CNS architecture (data not shown). In contrast, intranasal inoculation of 5week-old C57BL/6 mice with HCoV-OC43 TC did not cause any clinical disease, including any weight loss (Fig. 1) . Consistent with the uniformly lethal outcome observed in Fig. 1 . HCoV-OC43 NV is uniformly lethal to wild type C57BL/6 mice. 5-weekold mice were inoculated intranasally with 30 LD 50 HCoV-OC43 NV or 10 6 TCID 50 HCoV-OC43 TC as described in Materials and methods. Mice were monitored daily for survival (A) and weight loss (B). (*Indicates P < 0.0002). mice infected with HCoV-OC43 NV , we detected high titers of virus in the CNS of infected mice. HCoV-OC43 NV grew poorly in tissue culture cells and we could only reliably titer infectious virus using suckling mice, as described in Materials and methods. Virus titers increased from days 5 to 7 (Fig. 2) . To confirm these results, we also measured viral loads using a realtime RT-PCR assay. As shown in Figs. 2A and B , there was a strong positive correlation between recovery of infectious virus and the detection of OC43 nucleocapsid RNA in the brains of mice. Also, and in agreement with the results of Jacomy et al. (Jacomy and Talbot, 2003) , HCoV-OC43 infected other organs to a small extent, such as the lungs and intestines, when viral RNA was assayed by real-time RT-PCR (Fig. 2C) . Notably, the results also suggested that virus was in the process of clearance at the time of death since virus titers/RNA levels declined between days 7 and 9 p.i. (Fig. 2C) .",

Jacomy et al. reported that HCoV-OC43 QUE infection was primarily restricted to neurons in vivo (Jacomy and Talbot, 2003) . Thus, one possible explanation for the enhanced neurovirulence of HCoV-OC43 NV , relative to HCoV-OC43 QUE , is an expanded cell tropism. To more directly assess this possibility, we used combined in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry to identify cell types harboring viral RNA and antigen. We found that viral product was restricted to cells with morphologies consistent with neurons (Figs. 3C, D). Moreover, in some animals evaluated at late times postinfection (day 9), we could clearly identify Purkinje cells that harbored virus antigen (Fig. 3E ). When we evaluated whether astrocytes were infected by HCoV-OC43 NV in vivo, we found no evidence of colocalization of HCoV-OC43 RNA and the astrocyte-specific marker, GFAP antigen (Figs. 3F-H). We also performed a series of colocalization experiments for viral RNA and F4/80, a macrophage/microglia-specific cell marker, but could not identify F4/80 + cells that were positive for viral product. To confirm these results, we sorted F4/80 + CD45 hi (macrophages) and F4/80 + CD45 int (microglia) cells from the CNS of infected mice at 7 days postinfection, collected them onto glass slides and stained them for virus antigen. Neither macrophages nor microglia stained positive for viral antigen, while infected tissue culture cells processed in parallel stained positively (data not shown). These data suggest that unlike MHV, HCoV-OC43 does not infect astrocytes or macrophages/ microglia. Based on the morphology of the infected cells as well as the lack of virus staining in the white matter or in GFAP + or F4/80 + cells, we conclude that the predominant, if not sole, targets for HCoV-OC43 NV are neurons.",

HCoV-OC43 QUE was reported to cause less severe disease than we observed in mice infected with HCoV-OC43 NV . These differences in neurovirulence prompted us to determine the sequence of the S glycoproteins of HCoV-OC43 NV and HCoV-OC43 TC and compare them to the published HCoV-OC43 QUE sequence, since the coronavirus S protein is often associated with virulence (Thorp and Gallagher, 2004) . Included in this comparison are all available sequences submitted for a number of HCoV-OC43 isolates. These additional isolates represent strains that were reported as having been minimally or extensively passaged in tissue culture cells, as well as several primary clinical isolates that were never passaged in tissue culture cells (Supplementary Fig.  1 ). The sequence alignment revealed substantial divergence in the primary amino acid sequence of these HCoV-OC43 isolates. Of note, there were three amino acid substitutions wholly unique to HCoV-OC43 NV (Table 1) . Multiple other differences between the HCoV-OC43 TC and HCoV-OC43 QUE or HCoV-OC43 NV strains are also present in both the S1 and S2 domains ( Supplementary Fig. 1) . The large number of differences will make it difficult to determine which substitutions are critical for tissue culture cell adaptation. Of note, sequencing of the 3Vterminal end of HCoV-OC43 NV , including genes encoding non-structural 12.9 kDa, the small envelope (E), the nucleocapsid (N) and the transmembrane (M) proteins and the 3V untranslated region, revealed no nucleotide differences between HCoV-OC43 NV and HCoV-OC43 QUE .",

This observation raised that possibility that HCoV-OC43, unlike most other coronaviruses, is able to infect a wide variety of species without substantial adaptation. To gain insight into this possibility, we infected a variety of tissue culture cells from a wide range of species (hamster, pig, human, mouse, rat, monkey and cat) with HCoV-OC43 NV or HCoV-OC43 TC . As shown in Fig. 5 , immunocytochemical staining for viral antigen revealed that the tissue culture-adapted virus infected hamster, pig, human, mouse, monkey and cat cells, but not FRT rat epithelium cells. The neurovirulent strain also exhibited a wide host range specificity, infecting hamster, pig, human, monkey, cat and mouse cells. For some cells lines, such as murine 17CL-1, and human KB and HT1080 cells, we detected infection only by the tissue culture-adapted variant. Thus, both HCoV-OC43 NV and HCoV-OC43 TC showed broad species specificity, and not surprisingly, HCoV-OC43 TC showed enhanced ability to infect all types of tissue culture cells. Whether animals from these various species are also infectable by HCoV-OC43 remains to be determined, although data suggesting a close relationship between HCoV-OC43 and BCoV (Vijgen et al., 2005b) make it likely that the virus would be able to infect other species after minimal adaptation.",

BCoV, which is closely related to HCoV-OC43, also infects mice (Akashi et al., 1981; Barthold et al., 1990) ; phylogenetic analyses suggest that the two viruses diverged as recently as 1891 (Vijgen et al., 2005b) . These results suggest that HCoV-OC43 or BCoV crossed species from either humans or bovine to infect the other species, although the direction of spread is not known. This ability to cross species is also shared by SARS-CoV. SARS-CoV spread from exotic animals, most likely palm civet cats, to humans during contacts in ''wet markets'' in China (Peiris et al., 2004) . Also, as part of efforts to study the pathogenesis of this virus and to develop vaccines, several animal species, including mice, cats, ferrets and monkeys were shown to be susceptible to infection with the virus (Peiris et al., 2004) . SARS-CoV did not cause reproducible disease in any of these species, suggesting that further adaptation was required for optimal virus replication in these heterologous species. HCoV-OC43 and SARS-CoV differ from many coronaviruses, exemplified by HCoV-229E, in their ability to cross species. Fig. 1.  Fig. 5 . Broad tissue and cell type tropism of HCoV-OC43.

After 3 days, virus-infected cells were detected with immunocytochemistry as described in Materials and methods.

However, infection occurs, albeit with mild clinical disease if virus is adapted for growth in murine cells expressing hAPN and if mice are deficient in type I interferon responses (Lassnig et al., 2005) . SARS-CoV and HCoV-OC43, while both able to cross species, differ in regard to host cell receptor usage. The primary receptor for SARS-CoV is angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and other molecules such as DC-SIGN serve to enhance binding to target cells (Jeffers et al., 2004; Li et al., 2003; Marzi et al., 2004) . Adaptation to growth in foreign species involves mutations that enhance binding to heterologous ACE2 . No proteinaceous receptor for HCoV-OC43 has been conclusively identified; rather, Oacetylated sialic acid or a closely related compound appears to serve as the host cell receptor (Schultze and Herrler, 1992; Vlasak et al., 1988) . While little is known about the changes required for efficient replication of HCoV-OC43 in the murine CNS, it is likely that this process includes mutations that affect binding to host cell sugar moieties. Infection with the prototypic alphavirus, Sindbis virus (SINV), or with a picornavirus, Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV), is initiated by binding to a polyanionic polysaccharide, heparin sulfate (Byrnes and Griffin, 1998; Klimstra et al., 1998; Reddi and Lipton, 2002) . SINV with enhanced binding to heparin sulfate is selected after passage in tissue culture cells. HCoV-OC43 may undergo a similar set of changes during the course of adaptation to growth in tissue culture cells. The S protein of HCoV-OC43 TC differs from that of HCoV-OC43 NV at 20 positions ( Supplementary Fig. 1 ), making it difficult to determine which ones might contribute to enhanced ability to replicate in tissue culture cells.",

For example, disruption of the S1 -S2 cleavage site in MHV resulted in a viable virus that was attenuated for growth in tissue culture cells and mice (Stauber et al., 1993; Taguchi, 1993) . On the other hand, studies in BCoV revealed no correlation between the presence of the furin cleavage motif and virulence (Zhang et al., 1991) . Of the several laboratory isolates of HCoV-OC43 that have been sequenced, most contain the sequence RRSRG at the putative furin cleavage site. Kunkel and Herrler showed that S proteins containing this motif are not cleaved in infected cells, whereas two strains (designated OC43-CU and OC43-VA, Supplementary  Fig. 1 ) in which the S gene encoded a prototypic cleavage site (RRSRR) were cleaved (Kunkel and Herrler, 1993a) . The sequences of seven recently described primary clinical isolates also share the RRSRR motif (Supplemental Fig. 1) (Vijgen et al., 2005a) . Whether or not these primary isolates are cleaved and whether this motif contributes to clinical disease in humans are not known. As reported herein, the S protein of HCoV-OC43 NV contains the sequence RRSHG and presumably is not cleaved to a significant extent because it contains a glycine at position 5; it is even less likely that HCoV-OC43 TC , in which the sequence at this site is IRSRG, is cleaved. Although the R759H substitution is unlikely to affect cleavability of HCoV-OC43 NV S, as this is a conserved (charged-basic to charged-basic) change, it is formally possible that this unique substitution could alter cleavage and contribute to the enhanced virulence of HCoV-OC43 NV .",

Direct virus destruction of infected neurons is clearly important for much of the disease observed in mice infected with HCoV-OC43 NV or HCoV-OC43 QUE ; even though death is delayed in infected RAG1 \u00c0/\u00c0 mice compared to wild type mice, all mice still die by 16 days p.i. (Fig. 4) . However, the delayed death of infected RAG1 \u00c0/\u00c0 mice suggests that HCoV-OC43-induced encephalitis is in part mediated by the antiviral T cell response. Of note, Jacomy et al. previously concluded that the adaptive immune response did not contribute to pathology associated with HCoV-OC43 infection, based on the observation that treatment of mice with cyclosporin (CsA) prior to infection resulted in more rapid onset of disease and an increase in the percentage of mice that succumbed to the virus (Jacomy and Talbot, 2003) . These contrasting results may result from the different mechanisms of immunosuppression observed in RAG1 \u00c0/\u00c0 and CsA-treated mice.",

However, electrically silent or damaged neurons do express MHC class I antigen (Medana et al., 2000; Neumann et al., 1995 Neumann et al., , 1997 and it is possible that infection with HCoV-OC43 makes neurons into suitable targets for CD8 T cells. Of note, even damaged neurons have never been reported to express MHC class II antigen, making a direct effect of CD4 T cells on infected neurons unlikely. However, CD4 T cells are required for optimal function of CD8 T cells in the MHVinfected CNS (Stohlman et al., 1998) . Sindbis virus (SINV), a prototypic alphavirus, also primarily affects neurons. While virus clearance is largely mediated by antiviral antibodies, T cells, by secreting IFN-g, are critical for clearance from spinal cord neurons (Binder and Griffin, 2001) . Similar mechanisms may be involved in virus clearance from HCoV-OC43 neurons, with subsequent immunopathology. Future studies, directed at determining whether antiviral CD4 and CD8 T cell responses contribute to both virus clearance and to severe disease in HCoV-OC43-infected mice, may also be relevant to understanding disease outcome in patients with SARS, since neurons are infected in some patients (Gu et al., 2005) .",
