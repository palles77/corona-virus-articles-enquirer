Rhabdomyolysis, skin rash, and initial laboratory results suspicious of disseminated intravascular coagulopathy were also observed in this patient. M. pneumoniae infection was identified by a 4-fold increase in immunoglobulin G antibodies to M. pneumoniae between acute and convalescent sera by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.

Hence, the consequence of M. pneumoniae infection is mainly pneumonia, known to account for up to 40% of cases of community-acquired pneumonia in children [4] . Although pneumonia is well known as the hallmark of M. pneumoniae infection, cases of extrapulmonary manifestations presenting in the absence of pneumonia have been rarely reported in both children and adults [2, 3, [5] [6] [7] . The pathomechanism of how extrapulmonary manifestations are capable of occurring in the absence of pneumonia remains unknown. However it seems that extrapulmonary manifestations due to M. pneumoniae infection occur according to one of the following mechanisms; 1) a direct type in which local inflammatory cytokines plays an important role induced by M. pneumoniae at the site of inflammation, 2) an indirect type in which autoimmunity or the formation of immune complexes plays an important role in the absence of M. pneumoniae at the site of inflammation, and 3) a vascular occlusion type in which obstruction of blood flow plays an important role, induced either directly or indirectly by M. pneumoniae infection [7, 8] .",

According to previous studies, 8-30% of children presenting with serologically confirmed M. pneumoniae infection had an evidence of liver involvement [9, 10] . Based on the duration from the onset of fever and liver enzyme elevation, it seems that hepatic involvement of M. pneumoniae is bimodal [7] . While liver dysfunction is observed at the first hospital visit in early-onset hepatitis, it becomes evident later in the course, usually 7-10 days after the onset of fever, in late-onset hepatitis [7] . Narita et al. [3] reported that bacteremia with M. pneumoniae might be required for early-onset hepatitis, implying that early-onset hepatitis, which sometimes develops in the absence of pneumonia, may be related with a direct-type extrapulmonary manifestation [3, [5] [6] [7] . Meanwhile, late-onset hepatitis may be related with an indirect-type mechanism, in which cross-reactive antibodies induced by M. pneumoniae interact with sialo-oligosaccharides on hepatic cells [8, 11] .",

Thus, there is a possibility that primary infection with M. pneumonia may have started 10 days prior to admission. The self-limiting course of mild cough and body temperature elevation within a 2 days period may explain the mild course of pulmonary involvement and the absence of pneumonia in our case. Meanwhile, fever over 38 o C developed concurrently with abdominal pain in the right upper quadrant, 4 days after the resolution of the initial body temperature elevation. This clinical course of a 4 day symptom-free window period implies that the acute cholestatic hepatitis in our case may have been related with an indirect-type mechanism rather than a direct type mechanism.",

Association between M. pneumonia infection and dermatologic manifestations such as erythematous maculopapular eruptions and erythema multiforme are well known [12] , and the molecular mimicry between Mycoplasma P1-adhesin molecule and keratinocyte antigen leading to the generation of cross-reacting antibodies, immune-complex formation, and complement activation have been reported to attribute to the development of Mycoplasma induced rash and mucositis (MIRM) [13] . Rhabdomyolysis is often accompanied by multiple extrapulmonary manifestations in M. pneumoniae infection as in our case [7, 14] , although the exact underlying pathomechanism has not been revealed. Recently, it has been suggested that tumor necrosis factor-alpha may play a role in the pathogenesis of rhabdomyolysis associated with M. pneumoniae infection [15] . The development of DIC in M. pneumoniae infection is related with the vascular occlusion type mechanism in the presence of a systemic hypercoagulable state [7] . Abnormal immune regulation in M. pneumoniae infection has been suggested to activate complements or induce procoagulant mediators attributing to the development of DIC [16] [17] [18] . Therefore, our case may have been related with an indirect-type plus a vascular occlusion type mechanism.",

Antibiotics such as macrolides should be administered to reduce the amount of M. pneumoniae infected cells in the respiratory tract, which leads to the reduction of excessive antigenic stimuli [8] . The emergence and increasing incidence of macrolide resistant M. pneumoniae strains, especially in East Asian countries, has aroused attention in the treatment of M. pneumoniae infection [19, 20] . A recent review suggested the introduction of other potentially effective antibiotics in cases of clinical deterioration of symptoms or signs despite treatment with first line macrolides, in which the choice of the replaced antibiotic should be decided according to their in vitro activity and potential adverse events [20] . Corticosteroids or immunoglobulins are suggested to be beneficial in severe cases, and anticoagulation therapy is considered highly promising for cases of vascular occlusion type manifestations [8] . In our case, early suspicion of M. pneumoniae infection based on the patient's history of mild cough, and the admin-istration of clarithromycin could have played a crucial role in the early improvement of the disease course, despite the fact that respiratory involvement M. pneumoniae seemed to be mild in our case.",
