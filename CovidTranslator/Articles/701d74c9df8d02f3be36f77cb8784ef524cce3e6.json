            "text": "Human coxsackievirus (CV) belongs to the picornavirus family, which consists of over 200 medically relevant viruses. In picornavirus, a chymotrypsin-like protease (3C pro ) is required for viral replication by processing the polyproteins, and thus it is regarded as an antiviral drug target. A 3C-like protease (3CL pro ) also exists in human coronaviruses (CoV) such as 229E and the one causing severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). To combat SARS, we previously had developed peptidomimetic and zinc-coordinating inhibitors of 3CL pro . As shown in the present study, some of these compounds were also found to be active against 3C pro of CV strain B3 (CVB3). Several crystal structures of 3C pro from CVB3 and 3CL pro from CoV-229E and SARS-CoV in complex with the inhibitors were solved. The zinc-coordinating inhibitor is tetrahedrally coordinated to the His 40 -Cys 147 catalytic dyad of CVB3 3C pro . The presence of specific binding pockets for the residues of peptidomimetic inhibitors explains the binding specificity. Our results provide a structural basis for inhibitor optimization and development of potential drugs for antiviral therapies.",

Using the sitting-drop vapor diffusion method, the enzyme solution was mixed with inhibitor solutions at a molar ratio of 1:5 for 20 min before being combined with equal amounts of reservoir. 3CL pro -EPDTC crystal of CoV-229E was obtained using a reservoir of 18% PEG 6000, 10% DMSO, 14% methyl-2,4-pentanediol (MPD), and 0.12 M Tris-HCl, pH 8.5. The crystals were flash-frozen with 20 -25% ethylene glycol (v/v) as a cryoprotectant. For CVB3 3C pro and 3C pro -EPDTC crystals, a solution of 24% PEG 4000 and 0.1 M Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, was used as the reservoir. Native CVB3 3C pro was crystallized using 25% PEG 4000, 0.2 M MgCl 2 , and 0.1 M Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, to give two monoclinic forms with space groups P2 1 (form I) and C2 (form II). The second crystal form was obtained when the enzyme solution was mixed with the reservoir at a volume ratio of 3:2. The other two CVB3 3C pro crystals, the TG-0204998 complex and the inactive C147A mutant, were obtained using a reservoir solution of 24 -30% PEG 4000, 0.2 M MgCl 2 , and 0.1 M Tris-HCl, pH 7.5-8.5. These crystals were rinsed with 26% glycerol as a cryoprotectant prior to data collection. Crystals of SARS 3CL pro complexed with TG-0204998 and TG-0205486 were obtained using a reservoir solution of 3-6% PEG 6000, 4 -6% DMSO or MPD, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 0.1 M MES, pH 6.5, and a cryoprotectant of 25-30% glycerol or ethylene glycol.

The root-mean-square deviation between CVB3 3C pro and RV 3C pro is 0.73 \u00c5 for 166 C\u2423 atoms.

In these structures, the inhibitors were well defined in the Fourier maps. CoV-229E 3CL pro -EPDTC complex crystallized in a P2 1 unit cell with a dimer as its asymmetric unit (Fig. 2B) . As reported previously, both CoV-229E and SARS-CoV 3CL pro are homodimers with three domains in each monomer. The catalytic dyad of His-Cys is located in the active site in the cleft between domains I and II, whereas domain III participates in the protease dimerization (26, 31) . In contrast, CVB3 3C pro is a monomer, and it does not contain the dimerization domain III. By employing the program O (32), CVB3 3C pro monomer can be superimposed onto SARS 3CL pro with a root-mean-square deviation of 2.11 \u00c5 for 121 matched C\u2423 atoms or 1.06 \u00c5 for 48 C\u2423 if more stringent criteria were used. His 40 and Cys 147 in the catalytic triad of CVB3 3C pro coincide almost perfectly with the His-Cys dyads of the CoV proteases (Fig. 2C) . Although the two types of proteases share very little sequence homology, structure-based sequence comparison reveals some similarity in the regions of domains I and II (Fig. 2D) , which explains the similar substrate specificity and catalytic mechanism. However, the different affinities of the protein for the inhibitors encouraged further analysis of their interactions. Interactions of 3C pro and 3CL pro with the Inhibitors-The structure of EPDTC is shown in Fig. 3A , and those of the peptide inhibitors are shown in Table 1 . The local structures of CVB3 3C pro and CoV-229E 3CL pro in complex with EPDTC are shown in Fig. 3 , B and C, and the previously determined structure of SARS-CoV 3CL pro in complex with EPDTC is shown in Fig. 3D for comparison.

In this study, we found that CVB3 3C pro actually prefers the substrate of SARS-CoV 3CL pro derived from its N-terminal processing site. However, the inhibitors could not inhibit both proteases equally (Table 2) , suggesting some structural differences in the active site. To understand the structural basis of the specificity, we solved the structures of 3C pro from CVB3 and 3CL pro from CoV-229E and SARS-CoV with the same inhibitors to compare their binding modes.

The binding is facilitated by the suitable distances from the nitrogen atom of His and the S anion of Cys to the zinc center in both 3C and 3CL proteases. However, the EPDTC inhibition of CVB3 3C pro is 4.4-fold weaker (Fig. S1 ); this is probably because the side chain of Glu 71 is hydrogen-bonded to the N\u24261 atom of His 40 to favor the protonation of N\u24402. Therefore the N\u24402 atom must be deprotonated before EPDTC binding takes place. The lack of electron density for the bulky substituent groups might suggest that they are disordered. According to a computer model of the inhibitor with SARS-CoV 3CL pro (21) , the entire EPDTC could be accommodated in the active site with sufficient room for the bulky side groups to rotate about. On the other hand, a molecule of DMSO (SARS-CoV) or MPD (CoV-229E) is bound in the S1 site of 3CL pro . Although the DMSO molecule forms a hydrogen bond with Ser 144 of the former enzyme, the smaller side chain of Ala 143 in the latter case provides hydrophobic interaction and larger space for MPD bonding (Fig. 3, C and D) . No such solvent molecule was seen in the complex structure of CVB3 3C pro with EPDTC, because its more open S1 pocket fails to trap small molecules.",

On the other hand, our CVB3 3C pro structure is analogous to that of RV 3C pro , and a P2 phenyl side chain may be preferred by CVB3 3C pro as evidenced by the tight binding of AG7088 to RV 3C pro (4) . Moreover, the t-butyl group of P3 is favored for tight binding to the S3 site of SARS-CoV 3CL pro , which enhances the inhibition by more than 10-fold (20) . Conversely, the P3 Val in AG7088 fits RV 3C pro very well, but the additional t-butyl group makes our compounds weaker inhibitors of CVB3 3C pro . With the t-butyl group, the bulky P3 residue is actually relocated to the hydrophobic environment in the S4 site formed by the B2-C2 loop of CVB3 3C pro , leaving the unbound P4 benzoxy group facing the bulk solvent ( Figs. 2A  and 4B ). This may also contribute to the higher K i . Removal of the P3 t-butyl group or the entire P4 residue may improve the inhibitors against CVB3 3C pro .",

The strong binding of the lactam ring to the proteases is evidenced by the multiple hydrogen bond formations in the crystal structures (Fig. 4) . The addition of a cyclopropyl group to the P1\u0408 residue of TG-0205486 enhances the inhibition against CVB3 3C pro by almost 4-fold as compared with TG-0203770, but it becomes weaker against SARS-CoV 3CL pro ( Table 2) . As shown in Fig. 4D , the triangular group tends to clash with the protein atoms because of the more limited space of the S1\u0408 site adjacent to loop C1-D1. In CVB3 3C pro , the S1\u0408 site is more open, yet still flanked by the hydrophobic side chain of Phe 25 .",

If the water model is superimposed on the bound TG-0204998 molecules, W3 and W4 are equivalent to two carbon atoms in the P1\u0408 and P1 residues of TG-0204998. W5 and W6 are located in the S1 pocket, forming hydrogen bonds to the protein including His 161 . These are to be displaced by the P1 lactam ring with a similar bonding pattern. W7 is located in the S2 pocket with a distance of about 1.85 \u00c5 to the side chain carbon of P2 Leu and is hydrogen-bonded to the side chain of Glu 71 at a distance of 2.98 \u00c5. Based on these observations, a new drug can have the W4-equivalent carbon atom replaced by a nitrogen or sulfur, but the W3-equivalent carbon cannot be changed because it is part of the \u2423,\u2424-unsaturated aldehyde for the Michael addition. The P2 Leu may be replaced by an Arg or a Lys residue, which can interact with Glu 71 .",
