Once this receptor binds acetylcholine, it undergoes an extensive change in conformation that affects all subunits and leads to opening of an ion-conducting channel across the plasma membrane [1] . This gene is located in a region identified as a major susceptibility locus for juvenile cyclonic epilepsy and a chromosomal location involved in the genetic transmission of schizophrenia. An evolutionarily recent partial duplication event in this region results in a hybrid containing sequence from this gene and a novel FAM7A gene. After binding to acetylcholine, the AChR responds by an extensive change in conformation that affects all subunits and leads to the opening of an ion-conducting channel across the plasma membrane. The channel is blocked by alphabungarotoxin. Gene expression studies shows that CHRNA7 gene is primarily expressed in the posterior amygdalar nucleus and the field CA3 of Ammon's horn in the mouse, and in the mammillary body in humans [2] . Three-dimensional (3D) structure is the most competent requirement for any advance proteomic analysis or drug designing. In extension to this, the current paper deals with detailed structure modeling along with active site predivction of this potential protein that can act as cumulative target for different neurological anomalies.",
