The pandemic has mainly located in Northern Italy (Figure 1 ), partially saving for the moment the South. Italy was not prepared for Covid 19, today a planetary health emergency with 549474 cases and 24883 deaths worldwide (2). The Italian crisis provoked by Covid 19, is the most serious event in the Italian History after the Second World War, is a national human, health and economic tragedy. Covid 19 mortality in Italy has been 9%, higher than in China. The reasons for this high mortality are still unclear. It is realistic to believe that in Italy the infected people are much more (tests are carried out mainly in clearly symptomatic patients) and therefore the real mortality from Covid 19 may be lower. Furthermore, the oldest population in Italy may have increased mortality. In fact, In Italy, the median age of dead patients was around 80 years What has happened in Italy? Social containment, early and rapid throughout the nation is the most effective measure for the contrast and spread of Covid-19 which perhaps was delayed in Italy. Italy was the first nation in Europe affected by Covid 19 and was therefore caught unprepared. The rapid spread of Covid 19 and the dangerousness of the disease, very different from the normal seasonal influenza, was perhaps initially underestimated.",

It has been recently suggested that other health care systems should prepare for a massive increase in ICU demand during an uncontained outbreak of COVID-19 (3). The epidemic in Italy has also found territorial medicine unprepared which has not been able to intercept the problems of individual people, of people positive for tests, so during the days of national quarantine, it is extremely difficult for the population to have relations with territorial institutions for all disease-related problems.",

We are learning that hospitals might be the main Covid-19 carriers, as they are rapidly populated by infected patients, facilitating transmission to uninfected patients. Patients are transported by our regional system, which also contributes to spreading the disease as its ambulances and personnel rapidly become vectors. Finally, Italy does not produce containment systems, the masks and ventilation systems, for example, are not produced in Italy and this has caused a supply vulnerability when other nations have substantially reduced international relations. The universal Italian health system. It has been previously reported that the quality of the universal Italian health system and healthy behaviors have contributed in the past to favorable overall health. In a race against time in an unprecedented health national health emergence, with an organizational effort never seen before in Italy hundreds of doctors and nurses (many then SARS-CoV-2 positive) are fighting this horrible disease. The advantage of the Italian health system is that all citizens may have access to medical therapies. However, in recent years health policy has profoundly changed in Italy. The number of beds has been reduced; regional autonomy has accentuated an inequality in the quality of services on the national territory. It is now evident that Covid 19 patients have cardiac involvement, in some cases, independent to the lung disease. An increase in Troponin levels has been documented in a percentage of Covid-19 patients linked to a \"non-coronary\" myocardial damage frequent in many respiratory diseases. Furthermore, we often encounter type I or type II myocardial infarction triggered by the inflammatory response of the virus. Important for all of us in the front lines, according to the ACC statement (3) as clinicians, we are advised to measure troponin only if the diagnosis of acute MI is being considered on clinical grounds. It is very difficult when we see so many patients each day, to point out the care and necessary tests balancing the benefit and clinical needs. 6 The other reason why cardiologists are deeply concerned is immediately related to resources : the rapid reorganization of hospitals in Italy, the busy emergency system together with the patients suffering from cardiovascular diseases. In many hospitals, especially in northern Italy, with a high percentage of Covid patients, cardiac care units (CCU) were the first to be transformed into Importantly, a novel finding was documented by a recent ongoing survey by the Italian Society of Cardiology that found a 50% reduction in hospitalizations for acute coronary syndromes in this week of the pandemic, compared to the same period of the last year, even in the regions not heavily affected by Covid 19. Of note, the survey also showed that some STEMI patients were admitted to the Cath Lab with a great delay (far away from the 120 minutes), even in low infection density regions where CCU beds are available. The reduction is very strong for NSTEMI patients but a reduction of 30% has also been observed for STEMI patients.",
