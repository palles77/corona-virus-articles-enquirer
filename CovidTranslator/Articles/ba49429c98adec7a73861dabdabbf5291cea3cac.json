The results of crossvirus-neutralization tests and phylogenetic analysis of the S1 subunit of spike gene of these vaccine strains and other reference strains showed that strain LJL/110302 was of GI-19 lineage, whereas LLN/111169 was of the GI-1 lineage of the Conn serotype. Further comparative genomic analysis revealed that LLN/111169, an IBV strain with novel traits, originated from multiple recombination events (at least 3 recombination sites) between GI-19 and the Conn and 4/91 vaccine strains. LLN/111169 was pathogenic to specific pathogen-free (SPF) chickens. This is of prime importance because while IBV prevention measures worldwide are mainly dependent on modified live vaccine strains, our results showed that recombination between field and vaccine strains has produced a novel pathogenic IBV strain. In addition, LLN/111169 showed relatively broad tissue tropism (trachea, lungs, kidneys, and cecal tonsils) in infected SPF chickens. These results emphasize the importance of IBV surveillance in chicken flocks.",

            "text": "Avian infectious bronchitis virus, a gammacoronavirus belonging to the family Coronaviridae, is a large, enveloped, positive-strand-RNA virus, approximately 27.6 kb in size (Boursnell et al., 1987) . The IBV genome encodes 4 structural proteins: the spike (S) and membrane (M) glycoproteins, nucleocapsid (N) phosphoprotein, and envelop (E) protein. It also encodes at least 4 accessory genes-3a, 3b, 5a, and 5b-which occupy one-third of the genome at the 3 0 end. The S glycoprotein, an integral membrane protein, is posttranslationally cleaved into the N-terminal S1 and C-terminal S2 subunits (Cavanagh, 2007) . The S1 subunit is responsible for selection of the host, induction of protective immunity, and neutralization of most neutralizing serotypespecific antibodies (Kant et al., 1992; Wickramasinghe et al., 2011) . Because the S1 subunit of spike protein shows greater sequence diversity than other regions of IBV genome, it is most commonly used for molecular characterization, genetic classification, and genotyping of IBV. Such efforts have recently helped differentiate IBV strains worldwide into 7 IBV genotypes, 35 lineages, and a number of interlineage recombinants (Valastro et al., 2016; Chen et al., 2017; Jiang et al., 2017; Ma et al., 2019) . However, new IBV genotypes and variants are frequently emerging in different parts of the world, and many factors are contributing to this emergence and evolution (Sjaak de Wit et al., 2011; Jackwood, 2012) . In addition, the IBV genome contains 2 overlapping open reading frames (ORF), which occupy two-thirds of the genome and encode polyproteins 1a (pp1a) and 1 ab (pp1ab). These polyproteins undergo autoproteolytic cleavage to produce 15 nonstructural proteins (nsp2-nsp16).",

Regions of the genome predicted to have a stable secondary structure have been reported to be recombination \"hot spots\" in coronaviruses (Nagy and Simon, 1997) . Recombination events in the coronavirus genome are believed to have promoted the emergence of viruses with novel traits such as altered tissue tropism, antigenicity, and pathogenicity. Some of these novel viruses are even able to adapt to new hosts and ecological niches, sometimes causing zoonotic events. This has been observed in the case of a turkey coronavirus which was proved to have evolved after simultaneous infection of a host with a known IBV strain and an uncharacterized coronavirus, resulting in recombination in the S1 subunit of spike gene and a subsequent shift in host tropism from chickens to turkeys (Jackwood et al., 2010) . In case of IBV, many recombinants isolated in different parts of the world have shown novel traits relative to those of their predicted parental viruses (Sjaak de Wit et al., 2011; Jackwood, 2012) .",

Both commercial chicken flocks were derived from the same layer breeders and contained at least 15,000 layers each. The birds in both flocks were vaccinated under the same vaccination program: first vaccination with the Massachusetts-Connecticut (Mass-Conn) bivalent vaccine at 1 D of age, followed by booster vaccination with H120 and 4/91 vaccines at 14 D of age. The chickens of both flocks displayed clinical signs at approximately 20 D of age. The morbidity and mortality rates were about 65 and 10% among chickens from Jilin and 7.5 and 3% among chickens from Liaoning, respectively. Some of the dead chickens showed moderate to severe tracheitis, marked airsacculitis, and proventriculitis, and most of them showed severe nephritis, including renal swelling and accumulation of urates in renal tubules. For virus isolation, kidney and proventriculus samples from each flock were pooled and homogenized separately. The homogenates were diluted in phosphate-buffered saline (1:10 dilution), clarified by centrifugation at 300 ! g for 5 min, and filtered through 0.22-mm membranes before inoculation into the allantoic cavity of 9-day-old SPF chicken embryos. The inoculated eggs were incubated at 37 C and candled daily. Characteristic embryonic changes (dwarfing, stunting, curling, or death) were observed between days 3 and 7, when the viruses were passaged 3 times.",

Similarly, antigen-positive cells were more intensely labeled in the trachea and kidneys of LJL/110302infected chickens than in those of LLN/111169-infected chickens (Figure 7) . In contrast, the replication efficiency of isolate LLN/111169 in chicken tissues was higher than that of LJL/110302 at 8 dpi. However, both isolates showed a somewhat high affinity for the trachea at this timepoint, as reflected in the high numbers of viral genome copies detected by real-time RT-PCR. In particular, both isolates showed a strong affinity to the kidney at 8 dpi. No IBV-derived RNA was detected in the tissues of control chickens (data not shown).",

The chicken flocks in these 2 farms were from the same layer breeders and had been vaccinated under similar IB vaccination programs. Chicken in both farms showed signs of the disease at approximately 20 D of age. It was, therefore, speculated that these 2 disease outbreaks were caused by similar agents and that IB vaccine strains were likely involved in the disease, although morbidity and mortality rates varied between the 2 farms. In this study, IBVs were isolated from both chicken flocks. However, isolate LLN/ 111169 was found to be genetically and antigenically identical to the Conn vaccine-like strain, and isolate LJL/110302 was genetically and antigenically different from isolate LLN/111169, and the 3 vaccine strains H120, Conn, and 4/91, which implied that different IBV lineages/serotypes were involved in the 2 farms.",

This virus lineage was involved again in the latest disease outbreak. In the present report, it was demonstrated that isolate LLN/111169 is a chimeric virus possessing an LJL/110302-like (GI-19) genome sequence, but with a unique S gene sequence which showed high similarity to that of the Conn vaccine strain and a 4/ 91-like (GI-13) fragment containing about a half-length of the N gene sequence at the 3 0 end and a complete 3 0 UTR. This chimeric virus was probably generated by multiple recombination events between the Conn and 4/91 vaccine strains and the circulating LJL/110302-like field strain. It is believed that recombination events can occur and can sometimes be observed in cases where birds have been Figure 6 . Viral RNA copy numbers in the tissues of chickens inoculated with isolates LJL/110302 and LLN/111169. Viral RNA copy numbers in the same amount of tissues (0.2 mg) of 5 chickens at 4 and 8 dpi were measured by real-time RT-PCR. Then, the concentrations of the viral RNA were calculated to express as \"viral genomic RNA copy number/mg of tissue\" from the each tissue.

In the present case, infection of GI-19-lineage IBVs in Conn-vaccinated and/or 4/91-vaccinated birds was possible because vaccination with the 2 vaccine strains could not provide complete protection against the GI-19 lineage (Liu et al., 2014; Han et al., 2017) . Thus, mixed infection of vaccine and virulent strains might occur under such conditions, which is the premise for the occurrence of recombination events. On the basis of this phenomenon-as observed in other IBV strains previously isolated in China-the Conn-like and 4/91-like sequences found in the genome of isolate LLN/111169 can be assumed to have been derived from the Conn and 4/91 vaccine strains (Liu et al., 2014; Han et al., 2017) .",

It has been found to be responsible for the emergence of SARS-CoV (Ge et al., 2013; Hu et al., 2015; Lau et al., 2015) as well as new strains of other coronaviruses, including human CoV HKU1, human CoV OC43, feline CoV type II strains (Herrewegh et al., 1998; Woo et al., 2006; Lau et al., 2011) , and deltacoronaviruses (Lau et al., 2018) . Recombination involving the S protein is believed to be a common phenomenon that might generate new genotypes and facilitate interspecies transmission and adaptation to new animal hosts. In avian coronaviruses, recombination events involving the S protein are believed to have promoted the emergence of turkey (Jackwood et al., 2010; Mardani et al., 2010) and guineafowl (Brown et al., 2016) coronaviruses; in this case, the turkey coronavirus was proved to have evolved after simultaneous infection of a host with a known IBV strain and an uncharacterized coronavirus, resulting in recombination in the S1 subunit of spike gene and a subsequent shift in host tropism from chickens to turkeys (Jackwood et al., 2010) . Infectious bronchitis virus is among the most important coronaviruses responsible for heavy economic losses worldwide. Recombination events in the S protein of IBV can not only result in the emergence of novel genotypes/serotypes and variants but also potentially result in the loss of vaccine efficacy, because the S protein plays an important role in antigenicity, tissue tropism, and virulence (Wickramasinghe et al., 2014) . Vaccine efficacy could also be reduced by antigenic differences among vaccine and field strains due to mutations in the S protein and incorrect vaccine choice. In the present study, although the recombinant LLN/111169 strain had the backbone of a GI-19-like virus, it was highly similar in its S protein sequence to the Conn vaccine strain and was antigenically related to the Conn vaccine strain. However, the LLN/111169 was isolated from a commercial layer flock that were vaccinated the Mass-Conn bivalent vaccine. It was possibly that other factors such as the improper use of vaccine were involved in the loss of vaccine efficacy although it was required to be confirmed by vaccinationchallenge test in the further investigation. However, isolate LLN/111169 was less pathogenic to SPF chickens than isolate LJL/110302, although both isolates showed broader tissue tropism. Interestingly, LJL/110302 and LLN/111169 showed different replication patterns in the tissues of SPF chickens, with the more virulent LJL/110302 isolate showing a greater replication capacity than the LLN/111169 isolate in the earlier stages of infection and lower replication capacity at 8 dpi. This difference in replication patterns might be associated with the recombination events in the N gene and 3 0 UTR of isolate LLN/111169 (Tsai et al., 2018; Lo et al., 2019) .",

However, strain LLN/111169 have emerged from multiple recombination events of the vaccines used, including Conn and 4/91 and another G1-19 field strain. It seems unlikely that all those recombination events have occurred simultaneously during a production cycle. It is more possible that those multiple recombination events have occurred over multiple flocks, and strain LLN/111169 emerged after the recombination of previous intermedial recombinants; the exact recombination schemes between the predicted parental viruses that produced the recombinant LLN/111169 strain remain unknown. Therefore, the present results should be interpreted with caution, and further investigations are necessary to advance our understanding of the mechanisms involved in recombination events in IBVs. Currently, IBV prevention is mainly dependent on vaccination with modified live vaccines. The identification of recombination events between field and vaccines strains, resulting in novel IBV strains with altered features, raises significant concerns over the use of IB vaccines in chicken flocks. In addition, the findings of this study highlight the significance of constant epidemiologic and molecular surveillance for IBV.",
