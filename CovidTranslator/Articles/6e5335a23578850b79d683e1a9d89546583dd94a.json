Control of these organisms has largely focused within individual hospitals. We examine the extent to which transfers of critically ill patients could be a vector for the wide spread of highly resistant organisms, and compare the efficiency of different approaches to targeting infection control resources. Methods: We analyzed the network of interhospital transfers of intensive care unit patients in 2005 US Medicare data and 2004-2006 Pennsylvania allpayer data. We simulated the spread of highly resistant hospital-acquired infections by randomly choosing a single hospital to develop a highly resistant organism and following the spread of infection or colonization throughout the network under varying strategies of infection control and varying levels of infectivity. Results: Critical care transfers could spread a highly resistant organism between any two US hospitals in a median of 3 years.",

Targeting resources to a small subset of hospitals on the basis of their position in the transfer network was 16 times more efficient than distributing infection control resources uniformly. Within any set of targeted hospitals, the best strategy for infection control heavily concentrated resources at a few particularly important hospitals, regardless of level of infectivity. Conclusions: Critical care transfers provide a plausible vector for widespread dissemination of highly resistant hospital-acquired microorganisms. Infection control efforts can be made more efficient by selectively targeting hospitals most important for transmission.",

However, highly resistant organisms can also spread between hospitals via interhospital patient transfers. The most notable recent example was the iatrogenic spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in Toronto [11] . Several other examples have been documented [12] [13] [14] . Patients may act as vectors if they are colonized by highly resistant organisms even when not actively infected [15, 16] . In contrast to these cases of documented spread across hospitals, most theoretical work on the spread of highly resistant organisms has focused on spread within a single hospital or population [17] [18] [19] [20] , although some account for local community interactions [21, 22] . The interactions between multiple hospitals change not only transmission dynamics but also perversely weaken incentives for infection control within hospitals [23] .",

We simulated two different levels of infectivity. In the maximal infectivity condition, the probability of transmission at any given transfer was 1 in the absence of infection control. In the moderate infectivity condition, the probability of transmission at any given transfer was 0.1 in the absence of infection control.

If resources were allocated using the degree-centrality approach, 2,099 beds (SD 2,048) were exposed. Allocating resources using the betweenness-centrality approach yielded 2,023 exposed beds (SD 2,056). The greedy approach limited spread to 944 beds (SD 836) within 1 year. (All differences P \\ 0.001.) Further, the greedy algorithm resulted in more robust infection control regimes (Fig. 1) ; the most widespread diffusion of the highly resistant microorganisms under the greedy algorithm was much lower than the worst-case scenarios for other approaches. Very similar patterns were obtained after 5 years of spread under the moderate infectivity condition. Any network-aware algorithm for resource allocation was more effective than An iterative algorithm identifies the hospital where placement of an infection control resource would most reduce the number of beds overall exposed to a highly resistant microorganism. It then repeats this process for each additional resource random allocation, and the greedy algorithm significantly outperformed degree-and betweenness-based allocations. The greedy algorithm identified a small number of hospitals as key to preventing wide dissemination of highly resistant microorganisms (Fig. 3) under both the maximal and moderate infectivity conditions. For example, the greedy algorithm allocated all 500 resources to only 96 hospitals under the maximal infectivity condition; the geographic distribution of these hospitals is shown in Fig. 4 . Eighteen resources were allocated to the most central hospital-equivalent to reducing transmission through that hospital 177-fold.",

Indeed, concentrating intensive infection control resources at a small number of hospitals can be 16 times more effective than distributing the same resources uniformly across all hospitals with regard to stopping interhospital spread.

Our simulation data further suggest that the time course of spread via transfers might be of the same order of magnitude as the widespread development of resistance due to antibiotic overuse.

Further, many hospitals may be as likely to acquire highly resistant organisms from transfers as they are to evolve highly resistant infections from their own antibiotic use.

Third, although we have examined several credible approaches to allocating infection control resources, we have not proven that the greedy algorithm is theoretically optimal-we have only demonstrated its superiority to other tested algorithms [42, 43] . Fourth, this exploration has focused on allocation when coordination is possible-it is not clear which approach is most robust if other hospitals can be expected to deviate from the allocation plan. Fifth, a full model-of substantially greater complexity-might account for transmission via brief community stays and non-ICU transfers; others have begun this important work at the scale of one county, rather than examining nationwide interdependence [3] . Finally, we have made simplifying assumptions about the nature of infection control allocation in the setting of scarce health-care resources, and the ability to add additional resources for similar marginal cost; further, the high degree of transmission spread suggested by the model at the most central hospitals may not be achievable in the real world. Translating these necessary model assumptions into direct policy recommendations must be done with care.",

            "text": "Highly resistant HAIs are likely to grow in importance over the coming years. New and virulent strains of bacteria and viruses, including the recent H1N1 influenza pandemic, make this problem particularly important [44] . We demonstrate that interhospital transfers of critically ill patients might form a vector for national-scale transmission of highly resistant microorganisms. Furthermore, we suggest that coordination between hospitals in allocating infection control resources could result in substantially decreased interhospital transmissibility with substantially lower total cost. The frequent transfer of patients between our ICUs results in substantial nationwide interdependence, and acknowledging and managing that interdependence may be important to public health and security.",
