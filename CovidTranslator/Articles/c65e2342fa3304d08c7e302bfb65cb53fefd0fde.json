When this mRNA was microinjected into the cytoplasm of BHK cells, mouse IgG was seen to accumulate in the Golgi complex after 5-6 hr of incubation. No accumulation was seen in 3T3 cells which lack the epitope recognized by 53FC3.

            "text": "The Golgi complex in eucaryotic cells plays a pivotal role in the intracellular transport and concomittant processing of newly synthesized secretory, lysosomal, and plasma membrane proteins (Palade, 1975; Rothman, 1981) . Functions which have thus far been localized to this organelle include trimming and terminal glycosylation of asparaginelinked oligosaccharides (reviewed by Hubbard and Ivatt, 1981) fatty acylation of membrane proteins (Schmidt et al., 1979) and phosphorylation of mannose residues on lysosomal enzymes (von Figura and Klein, 1979; Hasilik and Neufeld, 1980; Reitman and Kornfeld, 1981) . Much attention is now focused on the localization of these different functions to distinct compartments or cisternae within the Golgi stacks. One recent approach to this problem has been based on the use of drugs which may specifically block intracellular transport within the Golgi complex but not the synthesis of proteins to be transported. The rationale behind such an approach is that partially processed proteins should then accumulate immediately prior to the block. Thus by examination of these immature proteins, using biochemical and immunocytochemical techniques, one may be able to determine the positions of the various processing enzymes relative to the drug-induced transport block. The only drug that has been used so far with any degree of success is monensin Vassalli, 1977, 1978; Griffiths et al., 1983; Quinn et al., 1983) . This drug, however, is far from ideal since it severely perturbs the normal morphology of the Golgi complex and may well have further undesirable effects. In addition to these problems it is still far from clear how monensin exerts its effects.",

This might, for example, be reflected in the inhibition of surface expression of plasma membrane proteins To investigate this, BHK cells were injected with 53FC3 mRNA and allowed to accumulate antibody intracellularly for 5 hr. At this point the cells were infected with a temperature-sensitive mutant of vesicular stomatitis virus, tsO45, the G protein of which is synthesized but unable to leave the ER at the nonpermissive temperature of 39.5\"C (Bergman et al., 1981) . The cells were infected for 1 hr at 37'C and incubated for a further 1.5 hr at 39.5'C to allow accumulation of viral G protein in the ER. The cells were then transferred to the permissive temperature of 31 \"C for 30 min, which is sufficient time for the G protein to appear on the cell surface (Bergman et al., 1981) . At the end of this incubation period the cells were fixed and labeled with rabbit anti-VSV-G protein without prior permeabilization so that only G protein on the cell surface was labeled. The cells were then treated with Triton X-100 and labeled with both rhodamine-conjugated sheep anti-rabbit IgG (to reveal surface G protein) and fluorescein-conjugated sheep antimouse IgG (to reveal 53FC3 in the Golgi complex). The results of this experiment are shown in Figure 6 . Microinjetted cells had considerably less surface G protein when compared with their neighbors. This lack of surface labeling was not due to inability of the VSV tsO45 to infect the microinjected cells since Triton X-l 00 treatment prior to G protein labeling resulted in strong internal staining in at least 95% of the cells expressing 53FC3 (Figure 7) approximately the same percentage as the noninjected cells. These data clearly indicate that 53FC3 in the Golgi complex can inhibit the surface expression of VSV-G protein.",

We show that after microinjection of the appropriate mRNA, BHK ceils are able to synthesize the IgG which is transported to the Golgi complex where it can recognize its specific antigen and accumulate. If these microinjected cells are subsequently infected with VSV, surface expression of the viral G protein is greatly inhibited despite the fact that viral infection appears to have occurred normally. How this inhibition of surface expression takes place is not clear. There are, however, two rather different although not mutually exclusive possibilities. The first is that binding of the antibody may inhibit some specific function of the 135K protein which is essential for intracellular transport. At present, we have no idea what the function of this protein might be. The second possibility is that by cross-linking proteins within the Golgi membranes the organelle may simply be unable to function efficiently. This explanation would, of course, require that the 135K protein exists as an oligomer in vivo. Furthermore, one would have to argue that crosslinked proteins within Golgi membranes are not dealt with in the same manner as those on the cell surface despite the fact that the luminal face of Golgi membranes and the external surface of the cell are topologically equivalent. Plasma membrane proteins cross-linked with antibodies are rapidly internalized and directed to lysosomes (Silverstein et al.,1977) . Our results indicated, however, that the bulk of 53FC3 remains in the Golgi complex for at least 2.5 hr.",

First, and most important, our data strongly support the view (Rothman, 1981) that plasma membrane and secretory proteins must share a common pathway through at least that part of the Golgi complex prior to the one or two cisternae in each Golgi stack in which the 135K protein is located (Burke et al., 1982) . Second, since after microinjection we could never find any evidence for the 135K protein appearing on the plasma Cells were treated exactly as described in Figure 6 except that the cells were permeabilized with Triton X-100 prior to labeling with rabbit anti-VSV-G so that internal G protein was also labeled. BHK cells growing within a marked area on a glass coverslip were all microinjected with 417Ml mRNA, incubated for 5 hr and infected with VSV-tsO45 as described in the text. The cells were fixed and labeled with antibodies exactly as described in Figure 6 . Only labeling of G protein on the cell surface is shown since there is no appreciable intracellular accumulation of 417Ml IgG. (A) All the cells within this field (part of a group of 60) were microinjected with 417Ml mRNA. (B) Noninjected cells. Clearly microinjection with 417Ml mRNA has little or no effect on the surface expression of VSV-G protein. Bar = 20 pm. membrane, it would appear that simply attaching a secretory protein, an immunoglobulin, to an integral, Golgi membrane protein is insufficient to make it move from its normal location to the exterior of the cell. Our observations also explain the rather restricted species specificity of the monoclonal antibody. As described previously (Burke et al., 1982) the hybridoma was obtained from a fusion involving spleen cells from a mouse immunized with rat liver Golgi membranes. Clearly, it would create problems for a hybridoma (or any cell) to secrete antibody directed against a component found on the luminal side of its own Golgi membranes. It is not surprising then that although the antibody recognizes the 135K pro-tein in most rodent cells tested, it does not recognize the protein in mouse cells.",

Thus we utilized the cells' own secretory machinery to deliver the antibody to the correct location. Although we have not thus far attempted to extend our results to the biochemical level, there is no reason to believe that this cannot be done. Cleveland et al.
