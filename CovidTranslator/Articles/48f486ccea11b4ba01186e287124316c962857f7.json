The number of infected patients is continuously increasing and the need for Intensive Care Unit admission ranges from 5 to 26%. The mortality is reported to be around 3.4% with higher values for the elderly and in patients with comorbidities. Moreover, this condition is challenging the healthcare system where the outbreak reached its highest value. To date there is still no available treatment for SARS-CoV-2. Clinical and preclinical evidence suggests that nitric oxide (NO) has a beneficial effect on the coronavirusmediated acute respiratory syndrome, and this can be related to its viricidal effect. The time from the symptoms' onset to the development of severe respiratory distress is relatively long. We hypothesize that high concentrations of inhaled NO administered during early phases of COVID-19 infection can prevent the progression of the disease.",

SARS-CoV-2 is a positive single-stranded RNA virus belonging to the family Coronaviridae. The current outbreak would result from the acquired ability of the virus to undergo human to human transmission [3] , after the jump from the original animal reservoir (most likely a bat).",

In early case series, the risk of critical care admission ranges between 5 and 26%, with higher values for the elderly and in patients with comorbidities or chronic diseases [4, 5] . The time from symptoms onset to development of severe respiratory distress is relatively long, with a median time of 8 days in which the patient remains in a state of mild disease characterized by dry cough, fever and mild hypoxia requiring oxygen supplementation. Once severe disease with the necessity of ICU develops, the outcome worsens decisively, with mortality raising from 3.4% to 61% [4, 6] . Moreover, ICU staying poses a serious strain on resource-limited hospitals. Thus, preventing disease progression during the mild phase would be highly desirable both in terms of morbidity and mortality improvement and healthcare resource-sparing. At the present time, there are no proven etiological treatments for COVID-19 but some ongoing clinical trials are testing the effects of anti-viral drugs (NCT04252664 on ClinicalTrials.gov).",

The dynamic trend of this ongoing outbreak also prevents us to determine the rate of enrollment that we can achieve. As such, in Table 2 we are displaying the sample size calculation for our primary outcome, for an alpha level of 0.05 and a power level of 0.8, under different scenario. We will perform a first analysis based on 240 patients, evaluating the actual incidence of the primary outcome, effect of the treatment and the actual rate of enrollment. The PI will decide, together with the DSMB, whether to continue enrollment to 340 patients, if a sufficient rate of enrollment and power had not been achieved with the original sample size. Based on results reported in Table 2 , the same step could then be repeated increasing sample size from 340 to 500 patients, from 500 patients to 760 and from 760 patients to 1260.",

Once admitted to the hospital with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 (obtained by RT-PCR for SARS-COVID-2 virus, or positive in COVID-19 IgM/IgG antibodies) the patients will be screened. Eligible patients randomized to the treatment group will receive iNO to target an average inspiratory concentration between 140 to 180 ppm. The administration of iNO will be performed through a non-invasive ventilation circuit with a range between 2 and 10 cmH2O of positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) or a nonrebreathing mask without positive end expiratory pressure depending on the clinical needs of the patient and availability of respiratory equipment. The patients will undergo 2 sessions per day with the duration between 20 and 30 minutes. A representation of the administration setting in shown in Figure 1. The NO gas therapy will continue for 14 days or until the primary outcome event is reached (i.e., clinical deterioration with indication for intubation and mechanical ventilation).
