Unlike the majority of reported coronavirus 3CLpro inhibitors that act via covalent modification of the enzyme, 16-(R) is a non-covalent SARS-CoV 3CLpro inhibitor with moderate MW and good enzyme and antiviral inhibitory activity. A multi-component Ugi reaction was utilized to rapidly explore structure activity relationships within S 1\u2032 , S 1 , and S 2 enzyme binding pockets. The X-ray structure of SARS-CoV 3CLpro bound with 16-(R) was",

With the cooperation of leading nations, a rigorous public healthcare campaign was fortunately successful in controlling the outbreak. However, a reemergence of the SARS-CoV is still considered a potential pandemic risk and potentially new strains of SARS could be more severe than that found from the 2003 outbreak. Since 2003, two additional human coronaviruses, NL63 and HKU1, have been identified in patients around the world and the viruses have been characterized and found to be significantly less lethal than SARS-CoV. [6] [7] [8] Most recently, a new SARS-like virus, called HCoV-EMC, has been identified in at least two individuals, one of whom died. 9 Sequence analysis of HCoV-EMC indicates that this virus is more closely related to bat coronaviruses than to SARS-CoV. Therefore, the possibility of a future SARS-like pandemic remains possible and to date, there are still no vaccines or antiviral agents available to prevent or treat SARS-like infections.",

            "text": "The SARS-CoV 3CLpro has three domains: I (residues 8-101), II (residues 102-184), and III (residues 201-301). Domains I and II, which contain the active site region, are \u03b2-barrel domains, and domain III is an \u03b1-helical domain. The active site contains a catalytic dyad consisting of a cysteine residue (Cys-145) that acts as a nucleophile and a histidine residue (His-41) that acts as the general acid-base. Optimized octapeptide-based inhibitors using mutational and CoMFA models have been reported, 14 and more recently, a systematic saturation mutagenesis study was conducted at the P5 through P3\u2032 positions of the substrate. 15 These results demonstrate a strong structure-activity relationship between 3CLpro and its substrate and have provided a basis for peptidomimetic inhibitor design. Xray structures of the SARS-CoV 3CLpro enzyme bound to hexapeptidyl chloromethyl ketone inhibitors were first reported [16] [17] [18] and numerous peptidic structures now exist in the context of targeted anti-viral drug design. [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] These first generation protease inhibitors maintain a peptidic nature, often five residues in length, and bear a reactive warhead group at the terminus which forms a covalent interaction with Cys-145 ( Figure 1, 1-7) . Reactive \"warhead\" groups for 3CLpro have included aldehydes, epoxy-ketones, halo-methyl ketones, trifluoromethyl ketones, and a number of examples of Michael acceptors. [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] These inhibitors often first form a noncovalent interaction complex with the enzyme, positioning the warhead in close proximity to the catalytic cysteine. Attack of the thiolate anion of the catalytic cysteine onto the reactive atom of the warhead leads to formation of the covalent adduct, inactivating the enzyme. One of these compounds, TG-0205221 (5), reacts with SARS 3CLpro with a reported Ki value of ~60 nM. 22 These first generation inhibitors achieved sub-micromolar activity and provided valuable insights into further structure-based inhibitor design, quickly leading to non-peptidic, warhead-based small molecule inhibitors (Figure 2, 8-11) . 19, [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] Efforts utilizing virtual screening approaches also proved successful leading to non-peptidic inhibitors (e.g. 12-13). [32] [33] One of the early compounds disclosed bearing a cinnamyl amide, cinanserin ( Figure 2, 8) , has a reported IC 50 value of ~ 5 \u03bcM. 26 Low molecular weight non-peptide inhibitors bearing reactive esters (9-10b) [27] [28] [29] and ketones moieties (11a-b) [30] [31] have demonstrated moderate to good micromolar inhibition and in the case of pyridyl ester 10b 29 achieved inhibition in a cell-based assay below 10 \u03bcM.",

Legitimate non-covalent inhibitors described to date have been limited to high molecular weight peptidomimetics (MW > 800 amu), with low ligand efficiency, [38] [39] and have included known protease drugs originally developed for HIV protease. 40 In an effort to identify small molecule inhibitors of the SARS 3CLpro that inhibit via a non-covalent mechanism and possess low micromolar potency and good cell permeability, a screen was conducted in 2009 against the NIH molecular libraries sample collection (~293K compounds) in collaboration with the Mesecar laboratory and the Scripps Research Institute Molecular Screening Center (SRIMSC) through the molecular libraries program center network (MLPCN). 41 Herein we describe the results of this screening campaign and the prosecution of an optimization effort at the Vanderbilt Specialized Chemistry Center (VSCC) around a class of 2-(N-arylamido)-2-(pyridin-3-yl) acetamide inhibitors of moderate molecular weight. In addition, from these collaborative efforts and with the aid of X-ray crystallography, we report the details of the molecular interaction of 3CLpro inhibitor 16-(R) with the active site of 3CLpro and further describe the physicochemical and ancillary properties of 16-(R).",

Upon closer examination of the reported methods used to determine the IC 50 values for cinanserin, we found that the 3CLpro expression construct utilized by Chen and coworkers incorporated a (His) 6 -affinity tag at the N-terminus that extended it by an additional 14 residues. 44 The N-terminal affinity tag was never removed from the purified 3CLpro enzymes prior to their kinetic studies. As described above, the addition of N-terminal or C-terminal residues to SARS 3CLpro is known to have a dramatic effect in increasing the dissociation constant for dimerization of the enzyme as well as decreasing the enzymatic activity of the enzyme. 43 Therefore, cinanserin may be inhibiting a non-dimeric form of the enzyme. Another possible explanation is that Triton X-100 was not included in the assay buffer to remove potential promiscuous inhibition caused by non-specific aggregation of the protein by the compounds. 45 We tested cinanserin for inhibition of SARS-CoV, HKU1 and MHV 3CLpro at a concentration of 100 \u03bcM cinanserin both in the presence and absence of 0.01% Triton X-100 and found no inhibition of the enzymes in either case. Ultimately, we were unable to use cinanserin as a control inhibitor since no inhibition of SARS-CoV, HKU1 or MHV 3CL proteases was observed.

As discussed above, our version of the enzyme does not contain tags or excess amino acids that are known to drastically reduce catalytic activity of the enzyme. 43 Second, we maintained a high concentration of fresh reducing agent in the primary assays which helped to minimize, but did not eliminate, covalent compounds as primary leads. Finally, we utilized a highly fluorescent FRET-based 3CLpro peptide substrate composed of a HiLyte fluor \u2122 488 fluorescent label attached at the N-terminus and a QXL\u2122520 quencher dye attached to the C-terminus. This substrate allows for excitation in the spectral region of 488 nm that helps to eliminate spectral overlap with the compounds in the screen.

A similar hydrogen-bond interaction with His-163 engaged is retained in other 3CLpro crystal structures. 21 The furan ring oxygen and the amide carbonyl oxygen have a bi-furcated interaction with the backbone NH of Gly-143. Although the distance to the amide carbonyl is 0.5 \u00c5 closer to Gly-143 and appears to be a hydrogen bond, based upon distance (C=O to NH = 2.9 \u00c5), the geometry is not ideal. In fact, the NH of Gly-143 is nearly coplanar with both oxygen atoms. On the floor of the S 1\u2032 pocket, the catalytic Cys-145 is positioned beneath both the amide carbonyl carbon and the furan oxygen at a distance of 3.5 \u00c5. With this rather unique furyl amide interaction within the context of the catalytic residues and backbone Gly-143 interaction, we set out to understand this interaction further by preparing a second chemical library focusing exclusively on the P 1\u2032 group holding the P 1 -P 3 groups constant.

            "text": "In summary, we have described the optimization and molecular interaction details for a potent, non-covalent inhibitor of SARS-CoV 3CLpro identified through the MLPCN initiative. A four component Ugi reaction was utilized to rapidly generate SAR and optimize potency focusing on the S 1' , S 1 , and S 2 binding pockets. X-ray analysis of the 3CLpro-16-(R) complex reveals several key interactions crucial for activity; in particular a hydrogen bonding interaction between the inhibitor 3-pyridyl ring nitrogen and the active site His-163 side-chain located within the S 1 -subpocket. Probe 16-(R) (ML188) is a modest molecular weight SARS-CoV 3CLpro inhibitor with demonstrated antiviral activity and a non-covalent mechanism of action, and thus provides the opportunity to facilitate further structure-based design and inhibitor refinement in the quest for potential novel anti-SARS CoV therapies. Collaborative efforts in these laboratories continue towards the identification of submicromolar 3CLpro inhibitors with optimal properties for anti-viral activity and potential testing in animal models. ML188 is an MLPCN probe and is freely available upon request.",
