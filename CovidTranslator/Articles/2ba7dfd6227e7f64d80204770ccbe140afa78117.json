However, our nucleotide diversity analysis of the 149 entire S gene showed that the RBD domain is as diverse as the other regions of the S protein ( Fig.  150 2). The peak signals for diversity distribute in the entire S protein, and the peak in the RBD also 151 reached the Pi value of ~0.01, higher than more than 90% of the peaks outside of RBD. Since the 152 RBD function is essential for the virus, we hypothesize that the mutation-prone RBD should be 153 selected to maintain or even improve the binding affinity against human ACE2. To further test this hypothesis, we investigated the selective pressures of the S gene by calculating 160 nonsynonymous/synonymous rate ratio (dN/dS ratios) for various segments of the S gene in the 244 161 SARS-CoV-2 strains. In accordance to our hypothesis, the entire S gene exhibited a dN/dS of 162 1.9336, remarkably greater than 1, showing that the S gene is under positive selective pressure 163 (Table 1) . Surprisingly, the S1 subunit showed a much higher dN/dS value of 7.4971. More 164 strikingly, inside the S1 subunit, no synonymous substitutions were observed in RBD, resulting in a 165 practical infinite dN/dS ratio in this domain. Therefore, RBD is the major contributor of positive 166 selective pressure to the S gene. The extremely high dN/dS value of RBD indicates that very high 167 selective pressure is applied to this functionally essential domain. Therefore, the functional 168 relevance of these mutations can be postulated. 169 170 Table. 1",
