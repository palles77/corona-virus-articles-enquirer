The WHO has declared the new coronavirus (CoV) infection as a global public health emergency and named the coronavirus infected disease-19 . The genome analysis showed that the SARS-CoV-2 is a SARS-CoV like \u03b2-lineage coronavirus [2] and likely originates from bats [3] . SARS-CoV-2 uses human ACE2 protein as their receptors [4] , which explains its similarly high transmissibility. The clinical data indicated that the COVID-19 varied from asymptomatic to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), similar as SARS-CoV infection [5] [6] [7] . Although researchers are racing against time to develop vaccines and test anti-viral drugs in clinical trials [8] , there is no effective prophylactic and clinical treatment for COVID-19 yet.",

It reveals that compared to the lung immune microenvironment of mild symptom patients, monocyte-derived FCN1 + macrophages replacing the FABP4 + alveolar macrophages predominate macrophage lineage compostions in the severely damaged lung, which are highly inflammatory and potent chemokine producers.

Here, we took advantages of single-cell TCR-seq to assess the status of clonal expansions in the BALF of patients. As expected, CCR7 + T cells as naive or central memory cells, showed little clonal expansion, while CD8 + effector T cells showed the highest expansion levels among different T cell subsets ( Figure 4A and S5). Proliferating T cells and Treg cells also showed some expansion, but were less pervasive. Next, we examined the proportions of expanded clones between COVID-19 patients with mild and severe diseases. We found that the expansion levels in both total T and CD8 + T cells were significantly higher in mild disease group than the severe patients ( Figure 4B and 4C, S5). In average, more than 50% CD8 + T cells in mild group were expanded clones, which likely represented the SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells. They also showed higher amplification index than those from severe patients ( Figure 4C ). At the individual levels, we also found the higher T cell clonality was consistently remained in the 3 mild patients as compared to the 3 severe patients ( Figure 4D ), supporting that highly expanded CD8 + T cell participated in resolving the SARS-CoV-2 infection. To confirm the functional status of expanded T cell clones, we performed GEX analysis between expanded CD8 + T cells versus non-expanded cells.

The increased infiltrating macrophages into the lung are identified in the autopsy and animal models, and are thought to be responsible for fueling the inflammation [17] [18] [19] . Macrophages are well known to contain heterogeneous subsets, including tissue resident and monocyte derived populations, covering a broad spectrum from M1 to M2 like phenotype [20] . However, little is known regarding the macrophage subsets and their molecular features in SARS-CoV-2-infected human lungs. Here, we identified 4 groups of lung macrophages which can be classified by FCN1, SPP1 and FABP4 markers according to recent reports [13] . Group 1 & 2 macrophages are FCN1 + and highly inflammatory. They express higher levels of interferon stimulated genes and multiple chemokines, CCL2, CCL3, CCL5, IL-8, CXCL9, CXCL10 and CXCL11, thus identifying the FCN1 + macrophages as the culprit for the deranged hyper-inflammation. We identified the group 3, SPP1 + macrophages likely represented a repaired but also a pro-fibrotic subset [12] . They may counteract the FCN1 + macrophages to dampen the inflammation. Their roles and associations with patient outcomes should be further investigated. The group 4 macrophages are FABP4 + AMs showing higher PPAR\u03b3 activity which play important physiological roles in metabolizing lipid surfactant [20] . Here, we found that AMs consisted the principle lung macrophages in both controls and mildly infected patients, but was almost completely lost in severely infected lungs. The loss of AMs likely contributed to the failed lung functions. Together, these data improved our understanding of tissue macrophage heterogeneity in the immunopathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 infection.
