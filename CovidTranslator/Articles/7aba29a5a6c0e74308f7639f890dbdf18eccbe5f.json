            "text": "Treatment of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is experimental, and the effectiveness of ribavirin-steroid therapy is unclear. Forty SARS patients with progressive disease after ribavirin treatment and 1.5 g of pulsed methylprednisolone were given either convalescent plasma (n = 19) or further pulsed methylprednisolone (n = 21) in a retrospective non-randomised study. Good clinical outcome was defined as discharge by day 22 following the onset of symptoms. Convalescent plasma was obtained from recovered patients after informed consent. Patients in the plasma group had a shorter hospital stay (p 0.001) and lower mortality (p 0.049) than the comparator group. No immediate adverse effects were observed following plasma infusion. [1] . This highly infectious respiratory illness was caused by a novel coronavirus [2, 3] . Treatment was mainly empirical and, in the Prince of Wales Hospital, ribavirin and steroids were used as firstline treatment to suppress viral replication and minimise autoimmune pneumonitis. In c. 74% of the patients, the ribavirin-steroid combination was associated with recovery [4] . However, there was great debate as to whether ribavirin was effective against coronavirus, as well as concern about the side effects of high-dose steroids. Patients with persistent fever, radiographic progression and hypoxaemia, despite receiving 1.5 g of methylprednisolone, responded poorly to further courses of high-dose steroids, and an alternative therapy was needed. It was postulated that convalescent plasma from recovered SARS patients would carry antibodies against the coronavirus and might suppress viraemia.",

Patients who had received intravenous immunoglobulin, pentaglobulin, protease inhibitors or fewer than three doses of methylprednisolone were excluded. The patients studied were given either convalescent plasma (plasma group) or further pulses of methylprednisolone (steroid group) at the discretion of the attending clinicians and according to the availability of convalescent plasma. The potential benefits and side effects of convalescent plasma were explained carefully to the patients and their families. Patients in the plasma group could receive pulsed steroids if their condition worsened after plasma therapy, and were then classed as plasma therapy failures. Similarly, if patients in the steroid arm deteriorated after further pulses of methylprednisolone, they could receive convalescent plasma, but were then classed as steroid therapy failures.",

Nine patients in the steroid group (n = 21) were given convalescent plasma subsequently after four to eight doses of pulsed methylprednisolone. Age, sex and lactate dehydrogenase levels on admission were comparable between the two groups (Table 1 ). In the plasma group, 74% of patients were discharged by day 22, compared with 19% in the steroid group (p 0.001; Table 2 ). Five people died in the steroid group, all of whom were patients who received steroids only, compared with no deaths in the plasma group (p 0.049). Nine patients in the steroid group who received In most viral illnesses, viraemia peaks in the first week of infection. The patient then develops a primary immune response by day 10-14, followed by virus clearance. Therefore, convalescent plasma should be more effective when given early in the course of the disease. In SARS, viral load also peaks in the first week [5] , and this might explain the lack of clinical effectiveness of convalescent plasma when given after day 16. There were several limitations to this study. First, it was not a randomised study and the steroid group had more co-existing morbidities. However, when the analysis was repeated after excluding patients with co-morbid illness in each group, the difference in clinical outcome remained statistically significant (p 0.004). Second, the amount of antibodies given to each patient was not standardised, which could contribute to the variable clinical outcome in patients receiving convalescent plasma. Finally, it is arguable whether the ribavirin-steroid combination was effective at all in SARS patients, and the poorer outcome in the continuing high-dose methylprednisolone group might be caused sim-ply by the deleterious effects of steroids. However, no fungal or opportunistic infections were observed in these patients.",
