Cathepsins are divided into three groups, i.e., cysteine protease, serine protease, and aspartic protease. Cathepsin D and cathepsin L, which are aspartic protease and cysteine protease respectively, have been identified in a number of teleosts; however, the immunological relevance of fish cathepsins is largely unknown. In this study, we cloned and analyzed the expression profiles of a cathepsin D (CsCatD) and a cathepsin L (CsCatL) homologs from half-smooth tongue sole (Cynoglossus semilaevis). CsCatD is composed of 396 amino acid residues and shares 67.6e88.4% overall sequence identities with fish and human cathepsin D. Structurally CsCatD possesses an aspartic endopeptidase domain, which contains two conserved aspartic acid residues that form the catalytic site. CsCatL is 336 residues in length and shares 64.7e90.2% overall sequence identities with fish and human cathepsin L. CsCatL has an N-terminal cathepsin propeptide inhibitor domain followed by a Papain family cysteine protease domain, the latter containing four conserved catalytic residues: Gln-133, Cys-139, His-279, and Asn-303. Recombinant CsCatL purified from Escherichia coli exhibited apparent protease activity. Quantitative real time RT-PCR analysis detected constitutive expression of CsCatD and CsCatL in multiple tissues, with the lowest level found in heart and the highest level found in liver. Experimental challenge of tongue sole with the bacterial pathogen Vibrio anguillarum and megalocytivirus caused significant inductions of both CsCatD and CsCatL expression in kidney and spleen in time-dependent manners. Immunization of the fish with a subunit vaccine also enhanced CsCatD and CsCatL expression in the first week post-vaccination. These results suggest involvement of CsCatD and CsCatL in host immune reactions to bacterial and viral infections and in the process of antigen-induced immune response.",

            "text": "Cathepsins are a family of lysosomal proteases that can be classified into three groups based on the amino acid residues in their active sites: (i) cysteine protease, which include cathepsins B, C, F, H, K, L, O, S, T, U, V, W, and X; (ii) serine protease, which include cathepsins A and G; (iii) aspartic protease, which include cathepsins D and E [1] . Human cathepsin D is composed of 412 amino acid residues that contain a 20-residue prepeptide and a 44-residue propeptide [2] . Cathepsin D is synthesized in rough endoplasmic reticulum as a preproenzyme, which is converted to the 52 kDa procathepsin D after removal of the prepeptide. Procathepsin D is glycosylated at two N-linked glycosylation sites and modified with mannose 6-phosphate (M6P) at two asparagine residues [3] . The modified procathepsin D is targeted to lysosome by binding to M6P-receptors in trans-Golgi network that directs lysosomal segregation [4] . In the lysosomal compartment, the 44-residue propeptide was cleaved, resulting in a 48 kDa single chain intermediate active enzyme [5] . Like other aspartic proteases, cathepsin D has in the catalytic site two aspartate residues that are essential to enzyme activity. The physiological function of cathepsin D is to cleave intracellular proteins, including hormones and growth factors, and activate proenzymes and cellular factors involved in various cellular processes such as innate immune response and apoptosis [6e8] . In mice, cathepsin D is an essential enzyme, and cathepsin D deficiency results in death in the fourth week after birth [9] .",

In mammals, cathepsin L functions mainly to degrade proteins in the lysosome and is known to be involved in antigen processing and Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling [11] .

However, except in a few cases, the potential immunological relevance of piscine cathepsins D and L remain unknown. In this study, we report the identification and expressional analysis of cathepsin D (CsCatD) and cathepsin L (CsCatL) from half-smooth tongue sole (Cynoglossus semilaevis), an important economic fish species cultured widely in China. We found that the expressions of both CsCatD and CsCatL were regulated at transcription level by bacterial and viral infection. In addition, we also observed strong inductions of CsCatD and CsCatL expression by vaccination with a subunit vaccine. Our results suggest an immunological role for CsCatD and CsCatL in pathogen infection and vaccination.",

Conserved domain search identified in CsCatL a Papain family cysteine protease domain (residues 115e335) and a cathepsin propeptide inhibitor domain (residues 28e87). Within the cysteine protease domain are four conserved catalytic residues: Gln-133, Cys-139, His-279, and Asn-303, of which, the Cys and His residues are known to form in part a catalytic dyad in mammalian cathepsin L, while the Gln and Asn residues play an accessory role in catalysis [30] .

Recent studies showed that mammalian cathepsin L is involved in the infection of some viruses. For example, in one case, cathepsin L inhibitors blocked the entry of human coronavirus 229E, and in another case, cathepsin L is required for proteolytically processing of the Ebola virus glycoprotein during infection [36e39]. In our study, following challenge with the megalocytivirus RBIV-C1, CsCatD and CsCatL expressions in kidney and spleen were significantly (P < 0.05) upregulated, with peak inductions occurring at 12 h post-challenge in kidney and at 24 h post-challenge in spleen (Fig. 5) .

            "text": "It is known that in mammals, cathepsin L and, to a lesser extent, cathepsin D are involved in MHC II-associated Ag presentation and regulation of CD4 \u00fe T lymphocyte selection [12] . Mice defective in cathepsin L exhibit reduced number of CD4 \u00fe T cells and were affected in the ability to degrade invariant chain, a critical step in MHC II-restricted antigen presentation, in cortical thymic epithelial cells, which are antigen presenting cells for positive selection of T lymphocytes in the thymus [12, 40] . In our study, when tongue sole were vaccinated with a V. harveyi subunit vaccine DegQ, which is known to confer immunoprotection against V. harveyi infection [29] , CsCatD and CsCatL expression in kidney was significantly (P < 0.05) upregulated from 2 h to 7 d and from 2 h to 14 d postvaccination respectively (Fig. 6) . However, for both CsCatD and CsCatL, dramatic inductions (including peak inductions) occurred at the early hours following vaccination, which favors the suggestion that CsCatL and CsCatD may, like what has been observed with mammalian cathepsins L and D, possibly participate in antigen presentation and processing. In conclusion, the results of this study indicate that CsCatD and CsCatL expression was detectable in a wide range of tissues under normal physiological conditions and was significantly upregulated in kidney and spleen by bacterial and viral infections and by vaccination. These results support an immunological role for CsCatD and CsCatL in microbial infection and in vaccine-induced immune response.",
