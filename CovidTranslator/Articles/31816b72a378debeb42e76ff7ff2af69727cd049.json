In clinical practice, the detection methods have been rapidly updated due to the deepening understanding of COVID-19. Nucleic acid testing, chest CT, confirmation of epidemiological history and clinical manifestations are important bases for the diagnosis of novel coronavirus pneumonia [7] [8] [9] [10] . However, nucleic acid testing has operator restrictions, time-consuming, easy to pollution and the high cost. In comparison, the coronavirus antigen detection method has the advantages of rapid, convenient and the SARS-CoV antigen can be detected up to 1 day before appearance of clinical symptoms [11] .",

Nucleic acid test of SARS-CoV-2 Nasopharyngeal swab specimen were collected from all participants. Extraction of nucleic acids from those samples performed with a High Pure Viral Nucleic Acid Kit, as described by the manufacturer (Da An Gene Co., Ltd). Extracted nucleic acid samples were tested for viruses and bacteria by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), using the ABI Prism 7500 and the Light Cycler 480 real-time PCR system, in accordance with manufacturer instructions. A real-time reverse transcription PCR (RTPCR) assay was used to detect viral RNA by targeting SARS-CoV-2 ORF1ab and N gene region of SARS-CoV-2.",
