Ensuring that animals are free of infectious agents that might interfere with research can reduce the number of animals required for study. This contributes substantially to animal welfare. An effective health monitoring program is crucial for the assessment of the health status of research subjects and for validation of infection control measures. Numerous publications provide guidance for the establishment of health monitoring programs that are tailored to rodents 4,7 -12 . The Federation of European Laboratory Animal Science Associations has published detailed recommendations that constitute common standards for health monitoring and reporting procedures in Europe 10 .",

Many institutions have sent rodent serum samples to our laboratory for testing. Here we present a survey of data regarding the prevalence of antibodies against 24 viruses and M . pulmonis in sera of mice and rats from western European institutions. Data were collected from serological tests that were carried out in our laboratory during an 18-month period. To evaluate current prevalence rates of 24 viruses and of the bacterium Mycoplasma pulmonis , the authors retrospectively surveyed serological data obtained from laboratory mice and rats housed in more than 100 western European institutions. Serum samples were submitted to the authors ' institution for testing between January 2007 and June 2008. The prevalence of an infection was defined as the percentage of tested samples that yielded positive results for a specific agent. In mice, the most commonly detected infectious agents were murine norovirus (prevalence of 31.8 % ), mouse hepatitis virus (5.5 % ), mouse rotavirus (1.7 % ) and parvoviruses (1.0 % ). In rats, parvoviruses (12.1 % ) and M . pulmonis (3.6 % ) were the most prevalent infectious agents. Most rodent parvovirus infections could be attributed to mouse parvovirus in mice and to rat minute virus or to Kilham rat virus in rats. These data suggest the importance of up-to-date animal health monitoring programs and should stimulate the scientific community to further improve the microbiological quality of laboratory rodents.",

We carried out in-house assays according to published protocols 13 ; commercial ELISAs (Charles River Laboratories, Wilmington, MA) were carried out according to the manufacturer ' s standard protocol. Parvovirus infections in mice and rats were diagnosed using IFAs in which minute virus of mice or Kilham rat virus (respectively) were used as antigens. The IFA measures cross-reacting antibodies to various parvoviruses (by targeting highly conserved nonstructural viral proteins); therefore, if an IFA yielded a positive result, further testing was carried out to differentiate among serotypes. This was done by HAI assays (for minute virus of mice, Kilham rat virus, Toolan ' s H-1 virus and rat parvovirus) or by recombinant viral protein-2 ELISAs (for all known serotypes). These assays target viral capsid proteins that are serotype-specific.",

Commonly used assays include IFAs, ELISAs, HAI assays, immunoblot assays and, more recently, multiplex fluorescent immunoassays 14 . The methods used must be selected carefully, as the methods may differ in sensitivity and specificity, and unexpected results should always be confirmed by a second method, by a second laboratory or by monitoring additional animals. In the present survey, IFAs were generally used as a primary test method, and an HAI assay was used as a primary test method for detection of the K virus in mice. ELISAs were used for confirmatory testing, and ELISAs and HAI assays were used as secondary tests to distinguish between serotypes of parvoviruses ( Table 1 ). IFAs are highly sensitive and are more likely than ELISAs and HAI assays to detect cross-reacting antibodies to closely related viruses. Thus, IFAs are useful for primary screening. This broader reactivity can be attributed to the use of virus-infected cells as antigen (containing both nonstructural and structural viral proteins). IFAs are subject to both specific and nonspecific reactivity; the morphology and location of fluorescence can be evaluated to differentiate between specific and non specific reactions. The main disadvantage of IFAs is that interpretation of their results is subjective and dependent on the experience of the observer.",

However, nonspecific crossreactivity between irrelevant antibodies in the test sera and the antigen used can cause these assays to produce false positive results. This cross-reactivity can be reduced by using highly purified antigens prepared by recombinant technology. HAI assays are restricted to viruses that have hemagglutinins (proteins that bind red blood cells) on their surfaces. HAI tests lack sensitivity but are highly specific and can be used to differentiate between closely related viruses (such as rodent parvoviruses).

In mice, the most prevalent infections we detected were those with MNV, mouse hepatitis virus, mouse rotavirus and parvo viruses. In rats, parvoviruses and M . pulmonis were most prevalent. Most rodent parvovirus infections could be attributed to mouse parvovirus in mice and to rat minute virus or to Kilham rat virus in rats. Several parvovirus infections in mice and rats could not be attributed to a single serotype by means of HAI assays or recombinant ELISAs; this might have resulted from a lack of specificity of these assays, from simultaneous infection with two (or more) parvoviruses or from infection with a yet unknown parvovirus. We note that the prevalence of rat parvoviruses, in particular that of rat minute virus, might be overestimated in this survey, because a large number of positive serum samples ( n = 236) came from a single rat colony that was infected with the virus. On the other hand, we speculate that many serum samples submitted for testing were taken from colonies that were presumed to be ' clean ' , and that testing was aimed at confirming the seronegative status of these colonies. In our experience, monitoring for agents that are known to be endemic in a population is usually done infrequently or not at all. Therefore, the true prevalence rates of more commonly occurring agents (except rat parvoviruses) may be higher than those reported here.",

Natural infections with other Mycoplasma species in mice and rats are rarely reported, however, and most samples that tested positive by IFA using M . pulmonis as an antigen yielded strong fluorescence signals in our analyses.

Nevertheless, all studies show similar findings with regard to the ranking of prevalence of viral infections. Currently, mouse hepatitis virus, parvoviruses (in particular, mouse parvovirus) and mouse rotavirus are among the most prevalent viral infections in mice, and parvoviruses, cardioviruses, pneumonia virus of mice and coronaviruses are most prevalent in rats. The occurrence of MNV in mice was not addressed in the above-mentioned surveys, as this agent has only recently been identified 20 . Our study indicates that the prevalence of MNV is greater than the prevalence of other viruses in mice. Notably, our finding of a prevalence rate of 31.8 % is almost identical to that of a recent survey that found antibodies against MNV in 32.4 % of more than 42,000 mouse sera tested 21 .",

Prevalence data should be considered in current health monitoring programs. They are an indicator of the risk of infection and can be used to aid in developing lists of agents for which to test and to help determine the necessary frequency of testing in laboratory animal colonies. A cost-conscious and reasonable approach would be to monitor frequently (quarterly, for example) for the most prevalent (high-risk) agents, such as MNV, mouse hepatitis virus, parvoviruses and mouse rotavirus in mice, and less frequently (annually or semiannually, for example) for rare (lower-risk) agents, while also considering the effect that each of these agents would have on the ongoing research or research staff.

Antibodies against adenoviruses, Theiler ' s murine encephalomyelitis virus, M . pulmonis or reovirus type 3 were detected in fewer than 1 % of serum samples. No other infectious agents were detected during the period of investigation. Regarding parvovirus infections in mice, 64.91 % of infections (185 of 285 positive samples) could be attributed to mouse parvovirus, and 2.81 % of infections (8 of 285 positive samples) could be attributed to minute virus of mice. For 32.28 % of the positive samples (92 of 285), differentiation was not carried out, or results were ambiguous owing to positive findings for both minute virus of mice and mouse parvovirus.In rats, the most prevalent infectious agents were parvoviruses (prevalence of 12.1 % ; 482 of 3,997 tested samples) followed by M . pulmonis (prevalence of 3.56 % ; 105 of 2,949 samples;Fig. 2). Antibodies against pneumonia virus of mice, coronaviruses and cardioviruses were detected in fewer than 1 % of serum samples. Antibodies against other agents were not found. Regarding parvovirus infections in rats, the majority of detected infections could be attributed to rat minute virus (54.15 % ; 261 of 482 positive samples), followed by Kilham rat virus (12.45 % ; 60 of 482 positive samples) and rat parvovirus (0.83 % ; 4 of 482 positive samples). Antibodies against Toolan ' s H-1 virus were not detected. For 32.57 % of positive sera (157 of 482 positive samples), differentiation was not carried out, or results were ambiguous owing to positive findings for more than one parvovirus.",
