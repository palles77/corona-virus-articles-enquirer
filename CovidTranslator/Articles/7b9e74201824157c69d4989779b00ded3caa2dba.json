As of 23 rd March 2020, more than 340,000 people are reported to be infected, with ~4-5% mortalities (https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html). The SARS-CoV-2 is a single-stranded RNA virus belonging to the Coronaviridae family of zoonotic viruses that infect mammals and birds (Andersen et al., 2020) . The novel SARS-CoV-2 was first isolated from lung airway epithelial cells of patient with pneumonia . Since then it has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 employ receptor angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) for entry into human cells and utilise Transmembrane Serine Protease 2 (TMPRSS2) for Spike (S) Protein priming (Hoffmann et al., 2020) . SARS-CoV-2 shares ~80% sequence similarity with SARS-CoV and ~50% with Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), all of which cause severe respiratory symptoms (Hoffmann et al., 2020) .",

Moreover, these symptoms were elevated in intensive care unit (ICU) patients compared to patients who did not require ICU (Huang et al., 2020) .

In addition, concerns have been raised on effect of SARS-CoV-2 infection on pre-existing liver condition Mao et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2020) . Since SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2 and require TMPRSS2 for activation, we surveyed the human liver (from tumor and adjacent normal regions of hepatocellular carcinoma patients) by sc-RNA-seq to identify which cell type co-express these two genes.",

Since this progenitor cluster demonstrated bias for cholangiocyte fate we further investigated the expression of TROP2 gene.

Notably, we observed that only the EPCAM + progenitor cluster expressed all three genes ( Figure 2E ). Next we sub-divided this cluster into TROP2 low, intermediate and high cells and investigated the expression of ACE2, TMPRSS2 and other cell fate markers. Remarkably, we observed that TROP2 high cells expressed the highest levels of ACE2 and TMPRSS2, followed by TROP2 Int and TROP2 low cells ( Figure 2F ). Our analysis revealed that TROP2 Int (bipotent) cells also express MUC6 and SOX9, whereas TROP2 high (cholangiocyte fate bias) cells express makers such as CFTR, CXCL8, HES1 and KRT19. Taken together, our results suggest that SARS-CoV-2 can infect TROP2 high cells via ACE2 and TMPRSS2, thereby contributing to liver dysfunction by compromising the ability of the human liver to regenerate cholangiocytes.",

SARS-CoV-2 can reach the liver either through the general circulation once patient has become viraemic or through transmigration through the GI tract. We surveyed human liver scRNA-seq data to understand the expression pattern of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 gene which are essential for SARS-CoV-2 entry into human cells. Our analysis reveals that in human liver only EPCAM + progenitors co-express genes for viral entry (ACE2) and S-protein priming (TMPRSS2). Further analyses revealed the specific expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in TROP2 high cells. These results indicate that ACE2 and TMPRSS2 are specifically present in liver progenitors with a cholangiocyte fate bias, suggesting SARS-CoV-2 may be affecting cholangiocyte precursors, thereby potentially impeding the homeostasis of the cholangiocyte pool. Recent studies have reported the expression of ACE2 in cholangiocytes, however, did not reflect over the heterogeneity of ACE2 + population (Chai et al., 2020) . In this study we explored the heterogeneity of ACE2 + cells and systematically characterised ACE2 and TMPRSS2 co-expression as hallmarks of TROP2 + epithelial progenitors.",

In the future it will be important to survey other GI tract tissues at single-cell level for the expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 and their associated transcriptomes. Given the GI tract infection and multi-organ failure in COVID-19, it is important to understand whether other progenitor-like cells are also susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Moreover, TROP2 expression has been associated with amplifying progenitor cells in partial hepatectomy mouse model (Okabe et al., 2009) indicating the important role of TROP2 + cells in liver regeneration.

Scanpy implements numerous functions from preprocessing to visualization, clustering, differential gene expression, and trajectory inference analysis on Jupyter Notebooks. Parameters used in each function are manually curated to portray the best clustering of cells. In preprocessing, cells are filtered based on the criteria of expressing a minimum of 200 genes and a gene which is expressed by a minimum of 30 cells. Dying cells with a mitochondrial percentage of more than 5% are excluded. Cell count was normalized using scanpy.api.pp.normalize_per_cell with a scaling factor of 10,000 whereas gene expression was scaled to unit variance and mean value of 0 using scanpy.api.pp.scale. Dimension reduction starts with PCA using scanpy.api.tl.pca; the number of PCs used in each clustering exercise varies depending on the importance of embeddings to be included. In the interest of crisp clustering, we first calculated neighborhood graph (scanpy.api.pp.neighbors) of cells. Best matched k-Nearest Neighbor is automatically weighted by the algorithm to compute the best UMAP topology (scanpy.api.tl.umap, minimum distance between 0.3 to 0.5) which is consistently used throughout this paper. Louvain method (scanpy.api.tl.louvain) is then used to detect a community of similar cells. By default, Louvain's resolution parameter is set to the maximum value of 1.0, this in theory finds more and smaller . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license author/funder.

In our experiments, the value is set between 0.6 to 1. Genes are then ranked using scanpy.api.tl.rank_genes_groups (Benjamini Hochberg, t-test overestimated variance with adjusted p-value). Cell types was manually and iteratively assigned based on overlaps of literature curated and statistically ranked genes. To leverage the heterogeneity of this dataset, we used partition-based graph abstraction (PAGA, scanpy.api.tl.paga) to reconstruct lineage between cell types. This lineage trajectory provides a continuous cell type transition from the assigned discrete cell types. The thickness of the edges represents connectivity scores, an entropy-based measure provided by PAGA indicating relatedness between clusters; spurious connections are discarded while tuning thresholds.",
