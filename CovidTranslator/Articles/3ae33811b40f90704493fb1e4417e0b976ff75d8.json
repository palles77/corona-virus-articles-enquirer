            "text": "The emergence of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) led to a rapid response not only to contain the outbreak but also to identify possible therapeutic interventions, including the generation of human monoclonal antibodies (hmAbs). Human mAbs may be used therapeutically without the drawbacks of chimeric or animal Abs. Several different methods have been used to generate SARS-CoV specific neutralizing hmAbs including the immunization of transgenic mice, cloning of small chain variable regions from na\u00efve and convalescent patients, and the immortalization of convalescent B cells. Irrespective of the techniques used, the majority of hmAbs specifically reacted with the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the spike (S) protein and likely prevented receptor binding. However, several hmAbs that can bind to epitopes either within the RBD, located N terminal of the RBD or in the S2 domain and neutralize the virus with or without inhibiting receptor binding have been identified. Therapeutic utility of hmAbs has been further elucidated through the identification of potential combinations of hmAbs that could neutralize viral variants including escape mutants selected using hmAbs. These results suggest that a cocktail of hmAbs which can bind to unique epitopes and have different mechanisms of action might be of clinical utility against SARS-CoV infection, and indicate that a similar approach may be applied to treat other viral infections.",

Following several super-spreading events, by the end of the outbreak in July of 2003, SARS-CoV infection was responsible for 774 deaths and 8096 cases worldwide involving 29 countries [1] . Virus isolates recovered from individuals in 2003-2004 represented a second zoonotic event indicating a continued threat of SARS-CoV reentry into humans [3, 4] . Molecular analysis of SARS-CoV from the outbreak grouped viruses into early, middle, and late isolates. Early isolates exhibited greater sequence diversity suggesting that molecular evolution was occurring during the outbreak [4] .",

Approximately 20% of the patients developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and roughly half of the individuals with ARDS died [1, 14] .

The alteration of either of the two basic residues, R441A and R453A within this domain, abolished pseudovirus entry [31] . However, the effect of the R441A mutation may be due to decreased protein expression [30] . Interestingly, none of the eight basic residues within the RBM, including R441 and R453, were altered in 96 clinical isolates ( Figure 2 ) [31] . Two residues, R426 and N473, were identified as critical for ACE2 binding [30] . Changes in the RBM, namely N479K and T487S (Figure 2) , might have allowed more efficient binding to human ACE2 [3, 17, 27, 32] .",

These two regions are connected by a long (170 amino acid) inter-domain loop likely allowing flexibility to facilitate fusion [25] . The HR1 domain forms the inner helical coiled coil region onto which the HR2 domain associates in an anti-parallel manner to form the fusion core [25, 34, 35, 37] . This brings the putative fusion peptide (770-788) in close proximity to the transmembrane domain and facilitates juxtaposition of the cellular and viral membranes required for fusion [37, 38] . Therapies that disrupt interactions of the HR1 and HR2 domains would likely confer protection, and synthetic HR2 peptides have been demonstrated to block SARS-CoV infection, however HR1 peptides have not been found to inhibit entry [37] . Abs targeted to S2 can disrupt viral entry (discussed below).",

Infectivity mediated by L-SIGN, albeit at a significantly lower efficiency than ACE2, has been demonstrated in non-permissive cells [39, 40] . Residues important for S interaction with L-SIGN vary from the defined RBD, with several residues mapping N-terminal to the RBD. Neutralizing Abs that interrupt the association of S and ACE2 fail to prevent L-SIGN mediated entry [40] . The interaction of S protein with dendritic cell-specific ICAM-3 grabbing non-integrin (DC-SIGN) can facilitate the entry of SARS-CoV via ACE2. This interaction domain of S protein is between amino acids 324 and 386 within the minimum RBD, but N-terminal to the RBM [41] . DC-SIGN has also been implicated in the ability of dendritic cells (DCs) to transfer SARS-CoV to target cells in vitro without productively infecting the DCs, similar to HIV [42] .",

The difference between these strains of mice is that the mouse L chain genes are still functional in the Medarex HuMAb-Mouse \u00ae and therefore these mice can produce chimeric mAbs. The XenoMouse \u00ae from Amgen has all the mouse L chain genes deleted and B cells produce only human Abs. Immunization of the XenoMouse \u00ae with recombinant S protein ectodomain resulted in identification of 27 SARS-CoV neutralizing hmAbs [66] . These S1 specific hmAbs fell into one of eight groups determined by differences in binding to S protein fragments and immunoglobulin gene sequences [66] . The majority of the S1 specific neutralizing Abs reacted with the RBD; however, one mAb, 4D4, reacted N-terminal of the RBD between amino acids 12 and 261 (Figure 1 and Table2) [66] . Immunization of HuMAb \u00ae mice resulted in the production of 36 hybridomas from which two neutralizing mAbs were further evaluated. Monoclonal Ab 201 mapped to the RBD, recognizing an epitope containing amino acids 490-510 ( Figure 1 and Table 2 ). Monoclonal Ab 68, a chimeric mAb expressing a mouse light chain, mapped to amino acids 130-150 N-terminal of the RBD ( Figure 1 and Table 2 ) [67] . Monoclonal Ab 201, when given prophylactically, reduced viral titers in the lungs of mice below the limit of detection, and reduced viral titers and pathology in the lungs of Golden Syrian hamsters when given 24hrs post infection (Table 2 ) [67, 77] .",

The presence of these neutralizing epitopes demonstrated an important, yet undefined role of this region in SARS-CoV entry. The hmAbs 4D4 and 68 do not prevent association of the S protein with the cellular receptor (Table 2) [67, 74] . Deletions within the first 300 amino acids of S1 eliminated fusion ability of S protein in a cell-to-cell fusion assay while maintaining receptor binding function [83] . The N-terminal region of S protein also seems to play a role in the trimerization of the S protein, a structure that may be required for fusion [83] . Therefore, binding of hmAbs 4D4 or 68 to this region may interfere with virus fusion. Another potential role for this region is that it may interact with an unidentified co-receptor required for entry, or it may disrupt the interaction of S protein with L-SIGN [40] . Comparison of mAb 4D4 with 12-261 specific non-neutralizing Abs identified in the same screening could further elucidate the role of this region in viral entry [66] .",

This is an important discovery, because the inclusion of these hmAbs in a therapeutic cocktail allows targeting of more than one entry step. Non-S1 reactive hmAbs also play an important role in the inhibition of viral entry. Screening of full-length S reactive, but S1 non-reactive, hmAbs produced in the XenoMouse \u00ae resulted in the identification of 56 neutralizing Abs. These Abs may recognize an epitope within the S2 domain, and may neutralize by inhibiting fusion [74] . The S2 domain is more conserved than the S1 domain, and therefore, S2 region reactive hmAbs when combined with distinct S1 reactive hmAbs may be more effective against a wide range of clinical isolates [2, 49, 74, 76] . Furthermore, it would be interesting to test the S2 specific hmAbs against zoonotic SARS-CoV isolates and bat SARS-like-CoV isolates to determine possible cross-reactivity. There appears to be little cross-reactivity between human SARS-CoV and bat SARS-like-CoV isolates, likely due to large differences in the RBD, however, neutralization of human/ bat S chimera pseudotyped virus demonstrated some cross-neutralization potential outside the RBD [84] .",

Minor alterations in the RBD structure could result in the loss of conformational epitopes, allowing neutralization escape by cognate hmAbs. Examination of the sequences of clinical isolates demonstrated that changes within the RBD of S protein are tolerated ( Figure 2) . Interestingly, the majority of changes in RBD (through alanine scanning) did not result in significant loss of receptor binding, demonstrating the flexibility of S protein to escape immunological pressure without losing infectivity [30] . Furthermore, single amino acid changes within the S protein can abolish neutralization by a given mAb [78, 81] . Monoclonal Abs generated against late isolates may not be effective against early zoonotic isolates and may lead to enhanced infection. This was demonstrated by the increased entry mediated by pseudovirus bearing the S protein of the palm civet isolate by hmAbs S3.1, S127 and S111 [85] . Therefore, neutralizing hmAbs that can bind to conserved epitopes expressed on a wide range of isolates are the best candidates for passive immunotherapy.",

Several escape mutants of SARS-CoV were selected in early passages in the presence of neutralizing quantities of XenoMouse \u00ae hmAbs (3C7, 3H12 and 4D4). Escape mutants also appeared in later passages in the presence of sub-neutralizing amounts of hmAbs. No escape mutants were found when the virus was grown to 9 passages in the presence of hmAbs 6C1 and 6C2 [74] . Escape mutants, with single amino acid changes, arose in the presence of hmAbs S109.8 and S230.15, but hmAb S227 produced escape mutants only against a zoonotic isolate [81, 86] . Virus grown in the presence of the hmAb developed from a nonimmune scFv library CR3014 also yielded escape mutants with a single amino acid change P462L [82] . Virus grown in the presence of a hmAb generated from an immune scFv library CR3022 did not yield escape mutants [82] . Inability to generate escape mutants in the presence of certain hmAbs would suggest that these regions are critical for virus infectivity. However, as demonstrated for the hmAbs 6C1, 6C2, S228.11, S111.7 and S224.1, variants can also escape neutralization by hmAbs other than those used for their selection [74, 81, 86] . However, escape variants generated in the presence one Ab could be neutralized by a different hmAb or a combination of hmAbs. These findings highlight the importance of using a mixture of hmAbs that may neutralize a wide range of variants through different mechanisms by targeting different epitopes for passive immunotherapy [74, 81, 82, 86] .",

This increased efficacy was confirmed in a neutralization assay with SARS-CoV [74] . Similarly, the hmAbs CR3014 and CR3022 demonstrated synergy when used in combination to neutralize SARS-CoV. Interestingly, the combination of CR3014 and CR3022 was more effective against CR3014 escape virus than CR3022 alone [82] . However, certain combinations, such as hmAbs 4D4 and 1B5, did not yield increased efficacy [74] .

The mAb 80R was modified to broaden the neutralizing capability using two methods, light chain shuffling and focused mutagenesis. The D480A/G mutation within S protein was found to render mAb 80R ineffective. The crystal structure of 80R when bound to SARS-CoV RBD revealed a key residue (R162) in the CDR1 region of the 80R \u03ba light chain which likely plays a role in the loss of neutralization when amino acid 480 is mutated. This region was identified as a \"hot spot\" for activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) and was targeted to generate hmAbs of broader reactivity. Both methods identified several hmAbs capable of broader neutralization demonstrated by their ability to neutralize a late 2002/2003 isolate, a 2003/2004 isolate and isolates with D480A/G change [79] . The examination of the differences in relative binding affinities and neutralizing efficiencies of hmAb 80R allowed the engineering of a higher affinity hmAb; an approach that may be applied to other promising hmAbs.",

Despite the unusually large RNA genome of CoVs (27kb to nearly 32kb), they have an error frequency similar to that noted in other RNA viruses and can be predicted to incorporate 3 changes per genome per replication cycle [17, 87] . Interestingly, CoVs tend to have a restricted host tropism; however, they have a propensity to acquire mutations that can facilitate host \"jumping\", or alteration in tissue tropism as seen in the emergence of porcine respiratory virus (PRCoV), the respiratory variant of TGEV [87] . Another genetic tool of CoVs is the ability to recombine, which has been demonstrated by the ability of infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) isolates to recombine with vaccine strains in the field [87] . Therefore, therapies targeted to RNA viruses must consider the quasispecies nature of the viral population, the ability of the virus to recombine, as well as the rapid ability of RNA viruses to mutate in response to environmental pressure. As the sequence analyses, escape mutant generation and combination testing demonstrate, careful examination of how hmAbs will work together is an important aspect of rational therapeutic cocktail design.",

Enhanced hepatitis was found in ferrets previously vaccinated with modified vaccinia Ankara expressing the S protein upon SARS-CoV challenge [88] . In addition, previous studies using mouse immune sera as well as several neutralizing hmAbs demonstrated that these hmAbs enhanced infection of pseudotyped virus expressing palm civet S protein in vitro [85] . Interestingly, vaccination with a cDNA that encoded only the ectodomain of SARS-CoV S protein eliminated enhancement of infection of the palm civet pseudotyped virus [85] . It is important to note that the XenoMouse \u00ae and the HuMAb-Mouse \u00ae were immunized with the ectodomain of S protein [66, 67] . Unlike the other hmAbs produced, those generated from XenoMouse \u00ae are IgG2 isotype [66] . Advantages of the IgG2 isotype include failure to activate the classical complement pathway and low affinity for FcR on macrophages and other phagocytes. Therefore, IgG2 hmAbs are less likely to facilitate ADE [55] .",

A limited retrospective study of 40 SARS-CoV patients reported that administration of convalescent patient serum protected against infection, with no adverse events, indicating that passive therapy could be a safe and effective treatment [1, 94] . Abs that neutralize in vitro usually can also confer in vivo protection resulting in reduced viral titer [24, 44, 85, 92, 93, 95] .
