Due, in part, to high rates of subclinical infections and overlapping symptoms with infections from dengue and chikungunya viruses (Mitchell et al., 2019) , Zika virus was circulating for more than a year and a half before it was first detected in Brazil (Faria et al., 2017) . By the time Zika virus was discovered in May of 2015 (Zanluca et al., 2015) and recognized for its ability to cause severe congenital disease (Fran\u00e7 a et al., 2016; Mlakar et al., 2016) , the virus had already spread from Brazil to more than 40 countries (Faria et al., 2017; Grubaugh et al., 2017; Metsky et al., 2017; Th\u00e9 z\u00e9 et al., 2018) . By mid-2017, reports from the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) (PAHO, 2017a (PAHO, , 2017b revealed Zika virus activity throughout the Americas was waning, prompting predictions for the end of the epidemic (e.g., O'Reilly et al., 2018) and the removal of the World Health Organization's (WHO's) ''Public Health Emergency of International Concern'' status (WHO, 2016a (WHO, , 2016b . More recently, however, new Zika outbreaks have been described across the world (CDC, 2018) , including from Angola, India, Cabo Verde, Vietnam, and Thailand, with some of these resulting from Zika virus introductions from the epidemic in the Americas (e.g., Hill et al., 2019; Louren\u00e7 o et al., 2018; Meltzer et al., 2016; Phumee et al., 2019; Ruchusatsawat et al., 2019; Yadav et al., 2019) . These observations would suggest that significant transmission of Zika virus in the Americas could still be ongoing, despite case reporting having come close to zero.",

For Zika virus and other Aedes aegypti mosquito-borne virusesincluding dengue and chikungunya viruses-that are primarily transmitted in urban settings and disproportionately impact those with limited resources (Braga et al., 2010; Gardner et al., 2018; Netto et al., 2017; Weaver et al., 2018) , accurate local reporting is especially problematic. Not only are people in poor living conditions more likely to be exposed to infected mosquitoes, but such communities often have less access to adequate healthcare, resulting in more cases going undetected (Hotez, 2016; LaBeaud, 2008) . Pockets of virus transmission that occur in countries with inadequate reporting can therefore facilitate ''hidden'' outbreaks, increasing the risk of infected travelers causing outbreaks in new regions of the world. Thus, underreported or unrecognized local outbreaks may prolong epidemics and hinder global efforts aimed at halting virus spread.",

In contrast to local case reporting, travel surveillance relies on diagnosing patients that have acquired infections while traveling outside the country of diagnosis. More recently, approaches of ''genomic epidemiology'' using pathogen sequencing of infected patients have also been used to reconstruct the timing, scale, and dynamics of infectious disease outbreaks (Grubaugh et al., 2019a; Ladner et al., 2019) . As many regions in the Americas affected by the Zika epidemic attract large volumes of international visitors from countries with stronger surveillance systems (Wilder-Smith et al., 2018) , we hypothesized that, by creating a framework integrating local case reporting and travel surveillance with genomic epidemiology, we would be able to uncover potentially still-ongoing Zika outbreaks.",

We discovered a large Zika outbreak in Cuba that was not reported to PAHO (PAHO, 2017c) or other public health agencies and thus went undetected to the international community. We show that the outbreak in Cuba peaked in 2017, when the epidemic in the rest of the Americas was waning (PAHO, 2017a (PAHO, , 2017b , and estimate that it was at least as large as those in neighboring countries. By recalibrating the dynamics of recent Zika, dengue, and chikungunya outbreaks across the Caribbean, we show that, surprisingly, the Zika outbreak in Cuba was delayed by a full year, which could have been caused by a country-wide vector control campaign. By sequencing Zika virus directly from infected travelers, we show that the establishment of the virus in Cuba itself was delayed, with multiple introductions of Zika virus from other Caribbean islands later fueling the outbreak. Overall, our study creates a combined framework for how travel surveillance and genomic epidemiology can be used as a future surveillance network for detecting hidden outbreaks of worldwide emerging infections and reconstructing transmission dynamics when local reporting is absent, withheld, or otherwise insufficient.",

However, we observed a spike in Zika cases from travelers returning from this region during the summer of 2017 that were not captured by local reports (Figure 1A) , and Zika-virus-infected travelers from the Caribbean were reported until the end of our reporting period from the ECDC (December 2017) and FL-DOH (October 2018; Figure 1A ). By examining potential source locations for the travel-associated Zika cases in 2017, we found that, between June 2017 and October 2018, more than 98% of them came from Cuba (90 Local and travel-associated Zika cases were used to determine whether outbreaks were still occurring during 2017. (A) Monthly local Zika cases (left y axis) reported by the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) and monthly travel-associated Zika cases (right y axis) reported by the Florida Department of Health (FL-DOH) and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) were sorted by origin of exposure. The vertical lines represent the months the last local and travel cases were reported per region and the month that the World Health Organization (WHO) Public Health Emergency of International Concern status was lifted for the Zika epidemic (November 2017). In each region, travel cases and local cases were correlated (Pearson r range = 0.542-0.976; each comparison can be found in Data S1). (B) The total number of Zika cases reported by the FL-DOH and the ECDC associated with travel originating in the Caribbean are shown (black line) and are shaded by the top 5 origin locations (all other placed in the ''other Caribbean'' category). (C) Zika cases associated with travel from Cuba, diagnosed by the GeoSentinel Surveillance Network, were sorted by month of clinic visit. Travel cases diagnosed by the GeoSentinel Surveillance Network originating from other parts of the Americas are not shown. See also Figure S1 . The data used for this figure can be found in Data S1. Figure 1B ). To further confirm the timing of a Zika outbreak in Cuba, we obtained global travel surveillance data from the US CDC GeoSentinel Surveillance Network (Hamer et al., 2017; Leder et al., 2017) and found that 76% of the Zika cases associated with travel from Cuba were diagnosed in 2017 (22 of 29; Figure 1C) . By analyzing the total air travel volumes from Cuba to Florida and European countries, we found that the increase in passengers from 2016 to 2017 (1.2-1.53; Figure S1 ) does not account for the increase in travel Zika cases from Cuba reported by those countries (5.3-7.23; Figure S1 ). Although our travel surveillance shows that a Zika outbreak peaked in Cuba in 2017 with waning transmission continuing into 2018, during this time period, no local Zika cases were reported by Cuba to PAHO or other international public health agencies (PAHO, 2017c).",

These reports are inconsistent with the outbreak dynamics that we detected using travel surveillance ( Figures 1B and 2A) . To estimate the number of cases that likely went unreported in Cuba in 2016 and 2017, we first investigated whether travel surveillance accurately reflected the dynamics of known local Zika outbreaks for individual countries and territories outside Cuba. For this purpose, we estimated travel incidence by the number of diagnosed travel Zika cases by the air travel volume between all locations and compared that to the local incidence reported by PAHO (2017a, 2017b; Figure 2A ). We found that, in places with at least 20 travel-associated Zika cases reported ( Figure S2 ), epi curves constructed from travel surveillance were in agreement with epi curves generated from local data reporting (mean Pearson r = 0.769; range = 0.121-0.984; Data S1).

Taking the population size of Cuba into account, we estimated that 5,707 Zika cases (interquartile range: 1,071 to 22,611) likely went unreported in this country ( Figure 2B) , with the majority of these cases (>99%) having occurred in 2017. Our results therefore suggest that the 2017 Zika outbreak in Cuba was comparable in size to the known 2016 outbreaks in countries with similar population sizes, such as Haiti (3,103 reported cases), Dominican Republic (5,305 reported cases), and Jamaica (7,165 reported cases; Figure 2C) .",

To reconstruct recent outbreaks of chikungunya in the Caribbean, we used the same framework as we did for Zika (Figures 2 and 3A ) and analyzed travel surveillance cases reported by the FL-DOH to create chikungunya epi curves ( Figure 3B ). We found that the chikungunya outbreak in Cuba occurred at the same time (2014) as elsewhere in the Caribbean ( Figure 3B ). This synchrony of chikungunya outbreaks in the Caribbean is in contrast to the 2017 Zika outbreak in Cuba, which was delayed only in this country and not on any of the other Caribbean islands, as they all experienced outbreaks in 2016 ( Figure 3A ). These findings suggest that the delay of the Zika outbreak in Cuba could have been caused by events that were specific to this country during the 2015-2016 Zika epidemic.",

These findings suggest that the outbreak in Cuba was primarily fueled by introductions of the virus from other Caribbean islands, which is similar to our observations from the 2016 Zika outbreak in Florida . We next investigated the timing of the establishment of Zika virus in Cuba by estimating the time to the most recent common ancestor (tMRCA) using our time-resolved phylogenetic trees (Figures 4A and 4B) . The tMRCAs indicate the coalescence points for each clade and thus estimate the earliest times of establishment of the sequenced virus lineages in Ae. aegypti mosquitoes in Cuba that later gave rise to human cases. We found that all our tMRCA estimates for the Cuban Zika virus clades were between July and September 2016 ( Figure 4B ), corresponding to the peak of the Zika outbreaks in other Caribbean islands ( Figures 1A and 4C ).",

We then compared our tMRCAs to epi curves created from our travel surveillance and found that the peak of the 2017 Zika outbreak in Cuba occurred 11-13 months after the virus became locally established, which was in agreement to what we found for the 2016 Zika outbreaks in the Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico, and the Caribbean as a whole (excluding Cuba; Figure 4C ). Combined, these findings show that Zika outbreaks across the Caribbean peaked a year after successful establishment of the virus in each location and that the delay in the outbreak in Cuba was likely caused by a delay in the establishment of the virus itself.",

To investigate the likelihood of each hypothesis, we examined international travel patterns, yearly transmission of dengue virus (also vectored by Ae. aegypti), local temperature conditions, and news reports. Comparing all three hypotheses, we found that travel patterns and environmental conditions in Cuba could likely have supported a large Zika outbreak in 2016 but that virus establishment, and hence the outbreak, may have been delayed by a countrywide Ae. aegypti control campaign ( Figure 5) .",

Using monthly airline passenger arrivals coming from all 48 countries and territories in the Americas known to have local Zika virus transmission from 2014 to 2017, we did not detect any large deviations in air traffic to Cuba during 2015 when Zika virus was becoming established elsewhere in the Caribbean ( Figure 5A ). Moreover, air travel volumes were higher into Cuba than neighboring islands with large outbreaks in 2016, including Puerto Rico and Jamaica ( Figure 5A ). These findings suggest that the delayed outbreak in Cuba was not the result of the country having fewer opportunities for Zika virus introductions than other Caribbean islands early in the epidemic.",

Monthly dengue and Zika virus travel incidence rates (travel cases/100,000 travelers), as reported by the FL-DOH, and relative Ae. aegypti-borne virus transmission potential (mean and 95% confidence interval), determined by a temperature-sensitive model and monthly temperature from Havana, Cuba, were used to judge the impact of the aggressive Ae. aegypti mosquito control program that was reported to have begun in Cuba during February 2016.

To investigate whether mosquito control may have played a role in delaying the Zika outbreak in Cuba, we compared the reported start of the mosquito control campaign to the Zika and dengue outbreaks in Cuba ( Figure 5B ). We found that immediately following the reported implementation of mosquito control in February 2016, our travel surveillance showed minimal transmission of both dengue and Zika viruses throughout the year (Figures 5B and 5C ). By searching news articles for Zika and dengue in Cuba from 2015 to 2018, we found that Cuban officials reported that the mosquito control program was successful (Data S4), although we were unable to obtain empirical data to support this claim. The timing of the mosquito control campaign, followed by a decrease in both dengue and Zika cases ( Figures 5B and 5C )-despite high transmission potential ( Figure 5C )-suggests that mosquito control efforts may have been responsible for delaying the establishment of Zika virus in Cuba, thereby leading to a postponement of the outbreak.",

We then used this time period to assess where local mosquito-borne Zika virus transmission could have been established from Cuba using global air travel data from Cuba and previously estimated worldwide Ae. aegypti suitability (Kraemer et al., 2015;  Figure 6B ). Out of a total of $4 million air travelers departing Cuba between June and December of 2017, we found 18 countries and US states that received >20,000 travelers, with >100,000 arriving in Florida, Canada, Mexico, and Spain ( Figure 6B ). Based on environmental suitability for Ae. aegypti of the 18 areas with >20,000 travelers from Cuba, we estimated that Florida, Mexico, Panama, Venezuela, and Colombia were most at risk of Zika virus having been introduced from Cuba during June-December 2017 ( Figure 6B ). Indeed, four local Zika cases were reported in Florida during 2017, linked to their partners having recently returned from Cuba (FL DOH, 2017a , 2017b . Despite these findings, however, beyond a few cases, no Zika outbreaks were reported in these 18 regions in 2017, perhaps due to existing herd immunity (Netto et al., 2017; Zambrana et al., 2018) . These results show the global connectedness of Zika endemic areas, and with Zika cases associated with travel from the Americas ongoing as of October 2018 (Figure 1) , continued surveillance is required to detect potential further spread.",

To overcome some of these limitations, studies based on the detection of infected travelers have been used to fill knowledge gaps about ongoing outbreaks from places that are difficult to sample, as has been previously reported for Zika (Leder et al., 2017; Wilder-Smith et al., 2018) . In this study, we built on this framework to not just detect unreported outbreaks ( Figure 1 ) but to include travel patterns, comparisons to local reports from other locations, and virus genomics to reconstruct outbreaks in the absence of local data.",

Our analyses utilize the relationships between local cases and travel surveillance from non-Cuba countries, in combination with travel volumes and travel associated cases from Cuba. Other studies have used travelers to estimate local case numbers from influenza (Fraser et al., 2009 ) and Middle East respiratory syndrome outbreaks (Cauchemez et al., 2014a) by assuming that locals and travelers were equally likely to get infected. Although that assumption may have been correct for those outbreaks, for Zika, we found that epi curves generated based on local or travel data were correlated, but the incidence rates were different by orders of magnitude (Figure 2A ). This suggests that public health systems differ in their ability to detect Zika cases and/or locals and travelers have different risks for Zika infections. For example, because of differences in public health infrastructure and resources, Zika case reporting in Haiti (where our travel incidence is higher than local reporting; Figure 2A) may be less accurate than Puerto Rico (where our travel incidence is lower than local reporting; Figure 2A ; Braga et al., 2017; Dowell et al., 2011) . Additionally, location-dependent factors, such as common tourist behaviors and lengths of stay, could also alter the risks for traveler infection (Cauchemez et al., 2014a; Fraser et al., 2009 ). Thus, our approach of using the relationship between local and travel incidence data from locations with local reporting as a calibration might be a more accurate method for reconstructing Zika outbreaks than using travel incidence alone.",

            "text": "There are limitations to our approaches that may influence our ability to estimate the size of the Zika outbreak in Cuba. First, accurate travel data are necessary to calculate travel incidence rates of Zika cases. This is challenging for Cuba, as travel policies from the United States have repeatedly changed during the past few years (Robles, 2016) , and we found that travel volumes between Cuba and Florida increased in 2017 compared to 2016 ( Figure S1A ). To minimize this issue, we included air travel from both scheduled commercial flights from the International Air Transportation Association (IATA, 2018) and chartered flights from the US Department of Transportation (US DOT, 2018). We also obtained travel surveillance data from Europe, where the travel policies to Cuba have not recently changed, with travel volumes remaining relatively stable ( Figure S1A ). As we previously showed that cruise ship traffic greatly outnumbered airline traffic during the 2016 Zika outbreak in Florida , we also investigated cruise ships to Cuba; however, we found their travel volume to be much smaller than airlines for this country ( Figure S3 ). Second, our size estimates are based on averaging across all regions, some of which may be more, or less, representative of the Zika outbreak in Cuba. Although we found a strong correlation between epi curves generated from travelassociated Zika cases and local reporting, variability in the ratio between local and travel incidence among countries resulted in a wide interquartile range (1,071 to 22,611) on our mean estimate of 5,707 unreported Zika cases in Cuba. Our mean estimate, however, is consistent with the only two public reports from the outbreak in Cuba of 187 cases in 2016 reported by PAHO (PAHO, 2017c) and 1,847 cases in 2017 reported by the news agency Reuters (Reuters, 2017) . Zika outbreaks from other locations in the Americas with comparable population sizes to Cuba were also reported to be similar in size, which would still be true even at the lower end of our interquartile range ( Figure 2C ).",

            "text": "By sequencing Zika virus genomes from travelers infected in Cuba, we demonstrate that the 2017 outbreak peaked 11-13 months after the virus was established, a time frame that was consistent for other Zika outbreaks in the Caribbean (Figure 4C ). Other studies from Brazil, Central America, and Mexico have found similar patterns (Faria et al., 2017; Th\u00e9 z\u00e9 et al., 2018) . This suggests that the amount of time necessary for newly established Zika virus lineages to intensify in transmission to reach peak outbreak size will often require maintenance of the virus during seasons when mosquito abundance is low (e.g., by vertical transmission; Thangamani et al., 2016) . Although the factors supporting virus maintenance are still unclear, it is plausible that Zika virus may survive low mosquito abundance through a combination of low-level mosquito-to-human transmission, vertical transmission in mosquitoes (da Costa et al., 2018; Thangamani et al., 2016) , and, to a lesser extent, human sexual transmission (Althaus and Low, 2016) . Considering that all known large Zika outbreaks in the Americas, including Cuba, may have involved prolonged virus maintenance, a better understanding of how Zika virus is maintained during low mosquito abundance could lead to novel vector control and outbreak mitigation strategies.",

            "text": "By reconstructing other Ae. aegypti vectored outbreaks, analyzing climatic conditions, investigating news reports, and modeling mosquito abundance, our study suggests that the establishment of Zika virus in Cuba may have been delayed by an Ae. aegypti control campaign ( Figure 5C ). This accomplishment highlights the value of mosquito control for limiting transmission , as Cuba may have been able to reduce the local burden of both dengue and Zika, despite otherwise conducive environmental conditions to support transmission of the viruses ( Figure 5B ). Publicly available reports indicate that the response to Zika by Cuban authorities intensified in early 2016 and included active and passive surveillance, training of health professionals, communication and mobilization, and the application of adulticides and larvicides for mosquito control (Castell-Florit Serrate and M\u00e1 s-Bermejo, Castro et al., 2017; Gorry, 2016; Reardon, 2016) . This strategy was built upon years of effective dengue control through capacity building and research (Guzm\u00e1 n, 2005; Guzm\u00e1 n and Kour\u00ed, 2009). Although our observation of the suppression of both dengue virus transmission and Zika virus establishment during periods that we found were otherwise suitable for Ae. aegypti-borne transmission ( Figure 5C ) suggests that the mosquito control campaign was successful, we were unable to obtain empirical data to confirm these findings. Competition between dengue and Zika viruses-as previous exposure to dengue virus may protect against Zika virus infections in humans (Gordon et al., 2019; Rodriguez-Barraquer et al., 2019 )-may also have played a role in delaying the establishment of Zika virus in Cuba. However, how cross-protection, or other epidemiological interactions (Vogels et al., 2019) , between these two flaviviruses may impact outbreaks is not currently clear, and such potential virus ''competition'' would likely not be unique to Cuba. For future studies, accurate data on Zika virus seroprevalence in Cuba and other Caribbean islands would be helpful to address these questions. In addition, the availability of empirical mosquito abundance data would allow for an assessment of yearto-year differences in transmission potential and to specifically test whether Ae. aegypti populations were reduced during the control campaign in Cuba, as we previously observed in Florida . Importantly, vector abundance studies, including making such data publicly available, should be prioritized and more fully supported for future mosquito-borne virus outbreaks (Rund and Martinez, 2018) .",

Extracted case numbers were recorded in .csv files and aggregated per month for this analysis. Yearly human population numbers were retrieved from the United Nations Population Division (https://population.un.org/wpp/) and were used to calculate monthly local Zika virus incidence rates (suspected and confirmed Zika cases/100,000 population) per country and territory.

First, there were very few infections linked to cruise travel in our dataset, which may be because these cases would more likely be tourists diagnosed elsewhere (and just visiting Florida for the cruise departure). Second, many of the reported cruiserelated Zika infections were associated with more than one site for potential exposure, making it difficult to estimate local incidence rates (we removed all travel cases with multiple locations of potential exposure from our analyses). Third, scheduled cruise ship passengers arriving in Florida that stopped in Cuba are predicted to be substantially fewer (11,675/month scheduled for 2019; crawled from CruiseMapper: https://www.cruisemapper.com/) than air travel passengers from Cuba to Florida (80,366/month in 2017) ( Figure S3 ). Cruise travel between Cuba and Florida only began in 2016 (Vora, 2016) , and thus there would have been even fewer passengers during our primary study period between [2016] [2017] .",

We limited our analysis of countries besides Cuba to those with a correlation between monthly local and travel cases > 0.25 (n = 27), which appeared to be a natural breakpoint in the distribution of correlations. For each, we used the fda (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/fda/index.html) package in R to model per capita local incidence of Zika over time with univariate cubic B-spline functions with four knots per year for two years (2016) (2017) described by parameters q. We assumed that incidence among travelers from each country followed the same temporal pattern as local incidence but the two differed in magnitude by a factor m, which could be due to differences in exposure or healthseeking behavior between international travelers and the general population. To estimate q and m for each of the 27 countries, we modeled local and travel incidence for each month as independent binomial random variables, with incidence as the number of ''successes'' and country population and number of travelers, respectively, as the number of ''trials.'' Logit-transformed values of the spline functions informed the probability of success in each trial. Based on this likelihood formulation and with non-informative priors, we estimated q and m for each country using a Metropolis-Hastings implementation of Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). We assessed convergence by calculating Gelman-Rubin statistics on five replicate chains, and we performed posterior predictive checks on cumulative local incidence ( Figure S4 ) and travel incidence ( Figure S5 ) (Thompson Hobbs and Hooten, 2015) . On the basis of Bayesian p-values < 0.05 on these posterior predictive checks, we removed four countries from subsequent analyses (leaving n = 23 countries). To estimate per capita local incidence in Cuba, we first estimated q for Cuba in a similar manner, but based on travel data only. We then took 10 4 values of m drawn randomly from the posteriors of m pooled across 23 countries and multiplied them by random samples from the posterior of per capita travel incidence curves from Cuba to obtain a set of 10 4 predictions of per capita local incidence curves for Cuba.

Increase in Travel Zika Cases from Cuba Is Not Due to an Increase in Travel, Related to Figure 1 To assess if the 2016 to 2017 increase in Zika cases reported from travelers who recently visited Cuba were due to a Zika outbreak in Cuba or an increase in air travel passengers leaving Cuba, we compared the yearly travel volumes from Cuba to Florida, Spain, and Italy to the travel Zika cases from Cuba reported by the same countries during 2016 and 2017. The greater increase from 2016 to 2017 of travel cases compared to travel volume suggests that a Zika outbreak in Cuba was the cause. To determine the number of travel-associated infections needed to infer the shape of a local outbreak, we compared the total travel-associated Zika cases from each exposure-reporting country/territory combination (x axis) with Pearson correlation between the local and travel incidence rates corresponding to the combination (y axis). The travel-associated Zika cases were totaled from 2016-2017. For the Pearson correlations between local-travel incidence rates, monthly incidence values from 2016-2017 were compared. When there were > 20 travel-associated cases, the local-travel Pearson r was > 0.5, indicating a strong positive correlation and that the travel cases can help determine the shape of the local outbreak. The lone exception to that finding was from travelers from Barbados diagnosed in the United Kingdom (UK) because the travel cases miss the locally reported Zika virus peak during January-February, 2016, but they correlate with the second local peak during July-October, 2016 ( Figure 2A ). In our dataset, there were 25 Zika virus infections diagnosed in Italy with recent travel to Cuba, 30 diagnosed in Spain, and 98 diagnosed in Florida. These totals are all within the range of strong positive correlations between local and travel incidence, justifying their use to infer the local Zika outbreak dynamics in Cuba ( Figure 2B ).",
