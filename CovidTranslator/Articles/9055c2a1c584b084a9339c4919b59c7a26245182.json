Following extensive consultation, they were \u00c0 rst published in January 2001 1 and updated in 2007. 2 A cardinal feature of evidence-based guidelines is that they are subject to timely review in order that new research evidence and technological advances can be identi\u00c0 ed, appraised and, if shown to be effective for the prevention of HCAI, incorporated into amended guidelines. Periodically updating the evidence base and guideline recommendations is essential in order to maintain their validity and authority.",

These have been clearly identi\u00c0 ed in the text. In addition, the synopses of evidence underpinning the guideline recommendations have been updated.",

Clinically effective infection prevention and control practice is an essential feature of patient protection. By incorporating these guidelines into routine daily clinical practice, patient safety can be enhanced and the risk of patients acquiring an infection during episodes of health care in NHS hospitals in England can be minimised.",

A prospective randomised crossover study provided evidence for the effectiveness of daily cleaning of high-touch surfaces with micro\u00c0 bre/copper-impregnated cloths on the reduction of MRSA, as discussed above. 25 An RCT demonstrated the ef\u00c0 cacy of daily high-touch surface cleaning with peracetic acid on MRSA and C. dif\u00c0 cile contamination of the environment, with a signi\u00c0 cant reduction in MRSA and C. dif\u00c0 cile isolated from samples taken from surfaces with gloved hands (p<0.001) and the hands of healthcare workers (3/27 in peractic acid group vs 15/38 in standard cleaning group, p=0.13). 28 A nonrandomised controlled trial (NRCT) in two wards at a single hospital provided evidence that an additional cleaner was associated with a 32.5% reduction in environmental microbial contamination of hand-touch sites (95% CI 20.2-42.9, p<0.0001) and 26.6% reduction in acquisition of MRSA infection (95% CI 7.7-92.3, p=0.032), although the infection types were not speci\u00c0 ed. 29 Hydrogen peroxide has been used as a method of decontamination of the environment in situations where wards/ beds can be closed or left unused for the required period of time [30] [31] [32] We identi\u00c0 ed a prospective, randomised beforeafter study that compared the ef\u00c0 cacy of hypochlorite and a hydrogen peroxide decontamination system for terminal cleaning of rooms used by a patient with C. dif\u00c0 cile infection in reducing environmental contamination with C. dif\u00c0 cile. Although both methods reduced environmental contamination signi\u00c0 cantly compared with cleaning alone, hydrogen peroxide achieved a signi\u00c0 cantly greater reduction (91% vs 30% decrease in proportion of samples with C. dif\u00c0 cile, p<0.005). 33 A prospective cohort study provided evidence for the ef\u00c0 cacy of hydrogen peroxide when used for terminal decontamination after standard cleaning in signi\u00c0 cantly reducing the acquisition of multi-drug-resistant organisms in patients subsequently admitted to the rooms (adjusted incidence rate ratio 0.36, 95% CI 0.19-0.7). However, the effect was mainly driven by reduction in acquisition of VRE, and the results could have been confounded by the concurrent implementation of chlorhexidine baths, incomplete surveillance data and nonrandom assignment of rooms to the intervention. 34 The ef\u00c0 cacy of antimicrobial surfaces in the clinical environment in reducing surface contamination and HCAI is an area of emerging research. Four non-randomised, experimental studies, conducted in clinical environments, demonstrated signi\u00c0 cant reductions in microbial burden of between 80% and 90% on high-touch surfaces coated with metallic copper and/or its alloys compared with similar noncopper surfaces. [35] [36] [37] [38] One RCT conducted in three ICUs reported a signi\u00c0 cantly lower acquisition of HCAI in patients allocated to rooms with six high-touch copper-coated surfaces (3.4% vs 8.1%, p=0.013). A multi-variate analysis suggested that both severity of underlying illness and room assignment were independently associated with the acquisition of HCAI or colonisation. However, these \u00c0 ndings may have been biased by poor discrimination of patients colonised on admission because of limited surveillance cultures, poor agreement in de\u00c0 ning cases of HCAI, and incomplete adjustment for confounders in the multi-variate analysis. 39 Evidence of the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of these technologies and their contribution to reductions in HCAI is therefore not currently available.",

[42] [43] [44] We identi\u00c0 ed a number of uncontrolled before-after studies that used ATP in various forms to highlight the extent of contamination of the healthcare environment. In addition, some studies described the use of ATP monitoring as an intervention to improve cleaning, but the lack of a control group in the study design precluded their inclusion in this review. As cleaning will only have a transient effect on the numbers of microorganisms, regular cleaning or disinfection of hospital surfaces will not guarantee a pathogenfree environment. Preventing the transfer of pathogens from the environment to patients therefore still depends on ensuring that hands are decontaminated prior to patient contact. ",

The \u00c0 nding of the review is reinforced by a later observational study, which noted that lapses in adherence to the cleaning protocol were linked with an increase in environmental contamination with isolates of A. baumannii. 15 A second systematic review of four cohort studies that compared the use of detergents and disinfectants on microbial-contaminated hospital environmental surfaces suggested that a lack of effectiveness was, in many instances, due to inadequate strengths of disinfectants, probably resulting from a lack of knowledge. 26 We identi\u00c0 ed no new, robust research studies of education or system interventions for this review.

The resident \u00c1 ora are found on the surface, just below the uppermost layer of skin, are adapted to survive in the local conditions and are generally of low pathogenicity, although some, such as Stapylococcus epidermidis, may cause infection if transferred on to a susceptible site such as an invasive device. The transient \u00c1 ora are made up of microorganisms acquired by touching contaminated surfaces such as the environment, patients or other people, and are readily transferred to the next person or object touched. They may include a range of antimicrobial-resistant pathogens such as MRSA, Acinetobacter or other multi-resistant Gram-negative bacteria. 1 If transferred into susceptible sites such as invasive devices or wounds, these microorganisms can cause life-threatening infections.

Decontamination refers to a process for the physical removal of dirt, blood and body \u00c1 uids, and the removal or destruction of microorganisms from the hands. 45 The World Health Organization's (WHO) 'Five Moments for Hand Hygiene' 53 provides a framework for training healthcare workers, audit and feedback of hand hygiene practice, and has been adopted without modi\u00c0 cation in many countries and adapted in others (e.g. Canada). 54 Hands must be decontaminated at critical points before, during and after patient care activity to prevent crosstransmission of microorganisms. 1, 2, 45, 55 Evidence considered by the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) 56 indicated increases in hand decontamination compliance before and after patient contact associated with implementation of the WHO 'Five Moments' and US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2002 guidelines, but no difference in compliance after contact with patient surroundings. The following recommendations are derived from the WHO framework and NICE guidelines, 56 and include additional points of emphasis.",

Overall, there is no compelling evidence to favour the general use of antiseptic handwashing agents over liquid soap or one antiseptic agent over another. 2, 45, 53, 57 All hand hygiene products for use in clinical care must comply with current British Standards. 58 Many studies have been conducted during the past 15 years to compare hand hygiene preparations, including ABHR and gels, antiseptic handwash and liquid soap. 45 RCTs and other quasiexperimental studies have generally demonstrated alcoholbased preparations to be more effective hand hygiene agents than non-medicated soap and antiseptic handwashing agents, although a small number of studies reported no statistically signi\u00c0 cant difference. [59] [60] [61] [62] [63] [64] [65] [66] [67] [68] [69] [70] [71] [72] [73] [74] [75] [76] Many of these studies involved the use of ABHR as part of a number of interventions, or multimodal campaigns, to improve hand hygiene practice, and had methodological \u00c1 aws that weaken the causal relationship between the introduction of ABHR and reductions in HCAI. 77 We identi\u00c0 ed one multi-variate, interrupted time series which suggested that the amount of ABHR used per patientday was the only factor associated with a reduction in MRSA incidence density (p=0.011) in a neonatal ICU in Japan. 78 Incidence density fell over a 4-year period from an average of 15 per 1000 patient-days, with a peak of 20 per 1000 patientdays in August 2006, to 0 per 1000 patient-days in October 2008 and was sustained to July 2009 (average incidence density 7.5 per 1000 patient-days). The supporting evidence from laboratory studies of the ef\u00c0 cacy of ABHR indicates that these products are highly effective at reducing hand carriage, whilst overcoming some of the recognised barriers to handwashing; most importantly, the ease of use at the point of patient care.",

The effective use of ABHR will also substantially reduce resident microorganisms. This level of decontamination is suf\u00c0 cient for general social contact and most clinical care activities. 2, 45, 53 Liquid soap preparations that contain an antiseptic affect both transient microorganisms and resident \u00c1 ora, and some exert a residual effect. The use of preparations containing an antiseptic is required in situations where prolonged reduction in microbial \u00c1 ora on the skin is necessary (e.g. surgery, some invasive procedures or in outbreak situations). 2, 45, 53 ABHR is not effective against all microorganisms (e.g. some viruses such as Norovirus and spore-forming microorganisms such as C. dif\u00c0 cile). It will not remove dirt and organic material, and may not be effective in some outbreak situations. 52, 79 We identi\u00c0 ed two laboratory studies which demonstrated that ABHR was not effective in removing C. dif\u00c0 cile spores from hands. 80, 81 In the \u00c0 rst study, a comparison of liquid soap and water, chlorhexidine gluconate (CHG) soap and water, antiseptic hand wipes and ABHR resulted in all the soap and water protocols yielding greater mean colony-forming unit (cfu) reductions, followed by the antiseptic hand wipes, than ABHR. ABHR was equivalent to no intervention (0.06 log 10 cfu/mL, 95% CI -0.34 to 0.45 log 10 cfu/mL). 80 In the second study, three ABHR preparations with a minimum 60% alcohol S19 concentration were compared with antiseptic (CHG) soap and water. Antiseptic soap and water reduced spore counts signi\u00c0 cantly compared with each of the ABHRs (CHG vs Isagel, p=0.005; CHG vs Endure, p=0.010; CHG vs Purell, p=0.005). In addition, 30% of the residual spores were readily transferred by handshake following the use of ABHR. 81 Recent evidence from a laboratory study that compared the ef\u00c0 cacy of liquid soap and water and ABHR with and without CHG against H1N1 in\u00c1 uenza virus demonstrated that all the hand hygiene protocols were effective in reducing virus copies. 82 A further study that compared the use of liquid soap and water and 65% ethanol hand sanitisers for the removal of Rhinovirus indicated that the hand sanitisers were more effective than soap and water. 83 Two economic evaluations from the USA, included in recent NICE primary care guidelines, suggest that non-compliance with hand hygiene guidelines results in increased infection-related costs. 56 Although compliance increases procurement costs of hand hygiene products, even a small increase in compliance is likely to result in reduced infection costs. We identi\u00c0 ed a further economic analysis of a hand hygiene programme based on the introduction of point-of-use ABHR and associated implementation materials. This demonstrated a reduction in episodes of HCAI and a saving of $23.7 for every $1 spent on the programme when future costs were considered. Sensitivity analyses showed that the programme remained cost saving in all alternative scenarios. 84 ABHR is likely to be less costly and result in greater compliance.",

Hand hygiene technique involves both the preparation and the physical process of decontamination. 2, 45, 53 Hands and wrists need to be fully exposed to the hand hygiene product and therefore should be free from jewellery and long-sleeved clothing. A number of small-scale observational studies have demonstrated that wearing rings and false nails is associated with increased carriage of microorganisms and, in some cases, linked to the carriage of outbreak strains. Department of Health guidance on uniforms and work wear and NICE guidelines indicate that healthcare workers should remove rings and wrist jewellery, and wear short-sleeved clothing whilst delivering patient care. 56, 85 Evidence for the duration of hand decontamination has been considered in previous systematic reviews underpinning guidelines, and suggests that different durations of handwashing and hand rubbing do not signi\u00c0 cantly affect the reduction of bacteria. 59, 76 The WHO guidelines indicate that decontamination using ABHR should take 20-30 s for a seven-step process, and that handwashing should take 40-60 s for a nine-step process. 45 We identi\u00c0 ed one recent RCT in a single hospital which demonstrated that allowing staff to decontaminate their hands 'in no particular order' took less time and was as effective as using the WHO seven-step technique using ABHR or liquid antimicrobial soap and water (p=0.04 and p<0.001, respectively). All three of the protocols tested in this study were effective in reducing hand bacterial load (p<0.01). 86 A similar result was reported by authors of a laboratory study that tested the EN1500 six-step technique against a range of other protocols. They reported that allowing volunteers to use their own 'responsible application' or a new \u00c0 ve-step technique resulted in better coverage of the hands during hand decontamination. 87 A number of laboratory-based studies that investigated methods of hand drying suggested that there is no signi\u00c0 cant difference in the ef\u00c0 cacy of different methods of drying hands, but that good-quality paper towels dry hands ef\u00c0 ciently and remove bacteria effectively. 88, 89 Current guidance on infection control in the built environment suggests that air and jet driers are not appropriate for use in clinical areas. 90 We identi\u00c0 ed one systematic review of studies on hand drying that failed to meet the quality criteria for inclusion. 91 Due to the methodological limitations of studies, evidence recommendations are based on national and international guidelines which state that the duration of hand decontamination, the exposure of all aspects of the hands and wrists to the preparation being used, the use of vigorous rubbing to create friction, thorough rinsing in the case of handwashing, and ensuring that hands are completely dry are key factors in effective hand hygiene and the maintenance of skin integrity.

These studies found that ABHR was associated with less skin irritation than liquid soap and water. 60, 61, 64, 67, [93] [94] [95] In addition, a longitudinal study of the introduction and subsequent use of ABHR over a 7-year period observed no reports of irritant and contact dermatitis associated with the use of ABHR. 51 We identi\u00c0 ed a recent study which suggested that two ABHR preparations containing a glycerol emollient were more acceptable to staff (p<0.001). 96 Hand moisturisers/ emollients that are for shared use are more likely to become contaminated, and have been associated with an outbreak of infection in a neonatal unit. 97 Current national and international guidance suggests that skin care, through the appropriate use of hand lotion or moisturisers added to hand hygiene preparations, is an important factor in maintaining skin integrity, encouraging adherence to hand decontamination practices and assuring the health and safety of healthcare practitioners. 2, 45, 53 ",

Observational studies have consistently reported an association between multi-modal interventions involving the introduction of near-patient ABHR, audit and feedback, reminders and education, and greater compliance by healthcare staff. 51, [98] [99] [100] [101] [102] [103] [104] [105] [106] [107] [108] [109] An early systematic review of 21 studies involving interventions to improve hand hygiene compliance concludes that: \u2022 single interventions have a short-term in\u00c1 uence on hand hygiene; \u2022 reminders have a modest but sustained effect; \u2022 feedback increases rates of hand hygiene but must be regular; \u2022 near-patient alcohol-based preparations improve the frequency with which healthcare workers clean their hands; and \u2022 multi-faceted approaches have a more marked effect on hand hygiene and rates of HCAI. 110 H.

In a cluster RCT that also included a process evaluation, the authors tested a set of core elements in a 'state-of-the-art strategy' (SAS) against a team-leader-directed strategy (TDS) at baseline (T1), immediately following the intervention (T2) and 6 months later (T3) to ascertain the additional bene\u00c0 ts of leadership and staff engagement components. 117, 118 In the intention-to-treat analysis (ITT), an OR of 1.64 (95% CI 1.33-2.02, p<0.001) in favour of the TDS between T2 and T3 suggested that engaging ward leadership and the involvement of teams in setting norms and targets resulted in greater compliance with hand hygiene. However, there was no signi\u00c0 cant difference between the groups' compliance at T3 in the ITT (p=0.187), with the SAS also having a sustained effect. 117 The process evaluation examined the extent to which the content, dosage and coverage of the intervention had been delivered. 118 An as-treated analysis demonstrated a greater effect size for the TDS at T3 with a signi\u00c0 cant difference in hand hygiene compliance (p<0.01). The process evaluation also suggested that feedback about individual hand hygiene performance at T2 and T3 (p<0.05 and p<0.01, respectively), challenging colleagues on undesirable hand hygiene practice (p<0.01), and support from colleagues in performing hand hygiene (p<0.01) were positively correlated with changes in nurses' hand hygiene compliance. 118 The second cluster RCT used a step-wedge design to assess a behavioural feedback intervention in intensive therapy units (ITUs) and acute care of the elderly (ACE) wards at sites participating in the 'Cleanyourhands Campaign'. 119 The primary and secondary outcome measures were hand hygiene compliance measured by covert direct observation for 1 h every 6 weeks, and soap and ABHR procurement, respectively. Sixty wards were recruited, of which 33 implemented the intervention. The ITT analysis (60 wards) showed a signi\u00c0 cant effect of the intervention in the ITUs but not the ACE wards, equating to a 7-9% increase in compliance, with estimated OR of 1.44 (95% CI 1.018-1.76, p=<0.001) in ITUs and estimated OR of 1.06 (95% CI 0.87-1.25, p=0.5) in ACE wards. The perprotocol analysis (33 wards) showed a signi\u00c0 cant increase in compliance in both ACE wards and ITUs of 10-13% and 13-18%, respectively, with estimated OR of 1.67 (95% CI 1.26-2.22, p0.001) in ACE wards and estimated OR of 2.09 (95% CI 1.55-2.81, p0.001) in ITUs. The authors concluded that individual feedback and team action planning resulted in moderate but sustained improvements in hand hygiene adherence.

Despite being highlighted as an important gap in research, the role of patients' hands in the cross-transmission of microorganisms has not been investigated systematically, other than in ecologic studies that describe hand or skin contamination [124] [125] [126] or observations of non-use of hand hygiene products. 127 Studies of effective interventions to enable patients to clean their hands remain small scale and descriptive in nature. [128] [129] [130] [131] We identi\u00c0 ed three studies that described interventions to improve patient hand hygiene: one in an outbreak situation, one uncontrolled before-after study of parent education in a single paediatric ICU, and one as part of a prospective observational study in a community hospital. None of these studies met the quality criteria for inclusion in this systematic review. [132] [133] [134] However, all of these studies suggested that improving patient/carer hand hygiene had some effect on crosstransmission of microorganisms and hand hygiene technique. National guidelines indicate that it is important to educate patients and carers about the importance of hand hygiene, and inform them about the availability of hand hygiene facilities and their role in maintaining standards of healthcare workers' hand hygiene. 56 ",

The two main indications for the use of gloves in the prevention of HCAI 1 are: \u2022 to protect hands from contamination with organic matter and microorganisms; and \u2022 to reduce the risk of cross-transmission of microorganisms to staff and patients. Gloves should be selected on the basis of a risk assessment, and should be suitable for the proposed task and the materials being handled. [138] [139] [140] Gloves are categorised as medical gloves (examination and surgical) and protective gloves. 145 Examination gloves are available as sterile or non-sterile for use by healthcare workers during clinical care to prevent contamination with microorganisms, blood and body \u00c1 uids. Surgical gloves are available as sterile for use by healthcare workers during surgical and other invasive procedures. Protective gloves are used to protect healthcare workers from chemical hazards. 145 Gloves should not be worn as a substitute for hand hygiene. Their prolonged and unnecessary use may cause adverse reactions and skin sensitivity, and may lead to crosscontamination of the patient environment. 1, 2 The need to wear gloves and the selection of appropriate glove materials requires careful assessment of the task to be performed and its related risks to patients and healthcare workers. 1, 2, 135, 146, 147 Risk assessment should include consideration of: \u2022 who is at risk (patient or healthcare worker) and whether sterile or non-sterile gloves are required; \u2022 potential for exposure to blood, body \u00c1 uids, secretions and excretions; \u2022 contact with non-intact skin or mucous membranes during care and invasive procedures; and \u2022 healthcare worker and patient sensitivity to glove materials. We identi\u00c0 ed four observational studies which suggested that clinical gloves are not used in line with current guidance, and that glove use impacts negatively on hand hygiene. [148] [149] [150] [151] In addition, a cluster RCT of screening and enhanced contact precautions for patients colonised with MRSA or VRE found no reduction in transmission, but also found that adherence to contact precautions was less than ideal. 152 Gloves must be removed immediately following each care activity for which they have been worn, and hands must be decontaminated in order to prevent the cross-transmission of microorganisms to other susceptible sites in that individual or to other patients. Gloves should not be washed or decontaminated with ABHR as a substitute for changing gloves between care activities. 45",

Healthcare organisations must provide gloves that conform to European standards (EN455-1, 455-2, 455-3), and which are acceptable to healthcare practitioners. [153] [154] [155] Medical gloves are available in a range of materials, the most common being NRL, which remains the material of choice due to its ef\u00c0 cacy in protecting against bloodborne viruses and properties that enable the wearer to maintain dexterity. 1, 158 Patient or healthcare practitioner sensitivity to NRL proteins must also be taken into account when deciding on glove materials. 146 Synthetic gloves are generally more expensive than NRL gloves and may not be suitable for all purposes. 1 Nitrile gloves have the same chemical range as NRL gloves and may also lead to sensitivity problems in healthcare workers and patients. Polythene gloves are not suitable for clinical use due to their permeability and tendency to damage easily. 1 A study that compared the performance of nitrile, latex, copolymer and vinyl gloves under stressed and unstressed conditions found that nitrile gloves had the lowest failure rate, suggesting that nitrile gloves are a suitable alternative to NRL gloves, provided that there are no sensitivity issues. Importantly, the study noted variation in performance of the same type of glove produced by different manufacturers. 158 The Health and Safety Executive (HSE) also provide a guide-to-glove selection for employers. 147",

            "text": "Healthcare workers (and sometimes patients) may use standard, \u00c1 uid-repellent surgical face masks to prevent respiratory droplets from the mouth and nose being expelled into the environment. Face masks are also used, often in conjunction with eye protection, to protect the mucous membranes of the wearer from exposure to blood and/or body \u00c1 uids when splashing may occur. Our previous systematic reviews failed to reveal any robust experimental studies that demonstrated that healthcare workers wearing surgical face masks protected patients from HCAI during routine ward procedures, such as wound dressing or invasive medical procedures. 1, 2 Face masks are also used to protect the wearer from inhaling aerosolised droplet nuclei expelled from the respiratory tract. As surgical face masks are not effective at \u00c0 ltering out such particles, specialised respiratory protective equipment (respirators) may be recommended for the care of patients with certain respiratory diseases [e.g. active multiple drugresistant pulmonary tuberculosis, 174 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and pandemic in\u00c1 uenza]. 175 The \u00c0 ltration ef\u00c0 ciency of these respirators will protect the wearer from inhaling small respiratory particles, but to be effective, they must \u00c0 t closely to the face to minimise leakage around the mask. 1, 2, 176 The selection of the most appropriate respiratory protective equipment (RPE) should be based on a suitable risk assessment that includes the task being undertaken, the characteristics of the biological agent to which there is a risk of exposure, as well as the duration of the task and the local environment. Where the activity involves procedures likely to generate aerosols of biological agents transmitted by an airborne route (e.g. intubation), RPE with an assigned protection factor (APF) of 20 (equivalent to FFP3) should be used. In other circumstances, such as where the agent is transmitted via droplet rather than aerosol or where the level of aerosol exposure is low, the risk assessment may conclude that other forms of RPE (e.g. APF10/ FFP2) or a physical barrier (e.g. surgical face mask) may be appropriate, such as when caring for patients with in\u00c1 uenza. Where RPE is required, it must \u00c0 t the user properly and the user must be fully trained in how to wear and adjust it. 177 We identi\u00c0 ed four systematic reviews of the use of facial protection, all of which had been undertaken in the aftermath of the SARS outbreak and in response to the H1N1 in\u00c1 uenza pandemic. A range of study designs were considered in each of the reviews, including cluster RCTs, RCTs, cohort studies and descriptive before-after studies. Overall, many studies were poorly controlled, with no accounting for confounders, such as poor compliance in the weaker studies. The authors of each of the reviews concluded that there was no strong evidence that masks/respirators alone are effective for the prevention of respiratory viral infections. Masks/respirators should be used together with other protective measures to reduce transmission. [178] [179] [180] [181] Our previous systematic review indicated that different protective eyewear offered protection against physical splashing of infected substances into the eyes (although not on all occasions), but that compliance was poor. 1 Expert opinion recommends that face and eye protection reduce the risk of occupational exposure of healthcare workers to splashes of blood or body \u00c1 uids. 1, 2, 159, 182 SP29",

The safe handling and disposal of needles and other sharp instruments forms part of an overall strategy of clinical waste disposal to protect staff, patients and visitors from exposure to bloodborne pathogens. 159 The National Audit Of\u00c0 ce identi\u00c0 ed that needlestick and sharps injuries ranked alongside moving and handling, falls, trips and exposure to hazardous substances as the main types of accidents experienced by NHS staff. 189 A later Royal College of Nursing survey of 4407 nurses found that almost half (48%) had, at some point in their career, sustained a sharps injury from a device that had previously been used on a patient. A similar number (52%) reported fearing sharps injuries, and nearly half (45%) reported that they had not received training from their employer on safe needle use. 190 The 2012 'Eye of the Needle' report from the Health Protection Agency con\u00c0 rms that healthcare workers continue to be exposed to bloodborne virus infections, even though such exposures are largely preventable. 191 The average risk of transmission of bloodborne viruses following a single percutaneous exposure from an infected person, in the absence of appropriate post-exposure prophylaxis, has been estimated to be: 135, 191, 192 \u2022 hepatitis B virus, one in three; \u2022 hepatitis C virus, one in 30; and \u2022 human immunode\u00c0 ciency virus, one in 300.",

            "text": "The lack of well-designed, controlled intervention studies means that evidence to show whether or not safety devices are effective in reducing rates of infection is limited. However, a small number of studies have shown signi\u00c0 cant reductions in injuries associated with the use of safety devices 2 in cannulation, 206,207 phlebotomy 208-210 and injections. 211 It is logical that where needle-free or other safety devices are used, there is a resulting reduction in sharps injuries. A review of needlestick injuries in Scotland suggested that 56% of injuries would 'probably' or 'de\u00c0 nitely' have been prevented if a safety device had been used. 212 However, some studies have identi\u00c0 ed a range of barriers to the expected reduction in injuries, including staff resistance to using new devices, complexity of device operation or improper use, and poor training. 2 A comprehensive report and product review S29 conducted in the USA provides background information and guidance on the need for and use of needlestick-prevention devices, but also gives advice on establishing and evaluating a sharps injury prevention programme. 205 It reported that all devices have limitations in relation to cost, applicability and/or effectiveness. Some of the devices available are more expensive than standard devices, may not be compatible with existing equipment, and may be associated with an increase in bloodstream infection rates if used incorrectly. 213 NICE identi\u00c0 ed three RCTs that compared safety cannulae with standard cannulae. The studies were all in hospital settings and of low/very-low quality. The quality of evidence for safety needle devices was low, with no RCTs identi\u00c0 ed and the \u00c0 ve before-after implementation studies being of very-low quality. The quality of evidence for training was similarly low, with the type of training varying across the \u00c0 ve observational studies identi\u00c0 ed. 56 We identi\u00c0 ed a systematic review undertaken by the HSE which reviewed 41 studies that provided evidence for reductions in the incidence of occupational sharps injuries associated with use of sharps safety devices, education and training, and the acceptability of sharps safety devices. 197 Thirteen studies, predominantly with observational designs, demonstrated that safer sharps devices were associated with a signi\u00c0 cant reduction in the incidence of healthcare worker needlestick injury. 199, 201, [208] [209] [210] [214] [215] [216] [217] [218] [219] [220] [221] However, safety devices were not the total solution to reducing occupational injury. The bene\u00c0 cial outcome of consulting with end-users of safer sharps devices before they are introduced was demonstrated in \u00c0 ve studies identi\u00c0 ed in this review. 208, 211, [222] [223] [224] [225] In the USA, the Occupational Safety Health Administration and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health suggest that a thorough evaluation of any device is essential before purchasing decisions are made. 195, 226 Similarly, the HSE suggests that the end-users of any safer sharps device should be involved in the assessment of user acceptability and clinical applicability of any needle safety devices. 184 The evaluation should ensure that the safety feature works effectively and reliably, that the device is acceptable to healthcare practitioners and that it does not have an adverse effect on patient care.",

Medical asepsis aims to minimise the risk of contamination by microorganisms, and prevent their transmission by applying standard principles of infection prevention, including decontaminating hands, use of PPE, maintaining an aseptic area, and not touching susceptible sites or the surface of invasive devices. 56 Surgical asepsis is a more complex process, including procedures to eliminate microorganisms from an area (thus creating an aseptic environment), and is practised in operating theatres and for invasive procedures, such as the insertion of a central venous catheter (CVC). 56 'Aseptic technique' is a term applied to a set of specifi c practices and procedures used to assure asepsis and prevent the transfer of potentially pathogenic microorganisms to a susceptible site on the body (e.g. an open wound or insertion site for an invasive medical device) or to sterile equipment/devices. It involves ensuring that susceptible body sites and the sterile parts of devices in contact with a susceptible site are not contaminated during the procedure.",

Extraluminal contamination may occur as the catheter is inserted, by contamination of the catheter from healthcare workers' hands or from the patient's own perineal \u00c1 ora. Extraluminal contamination is also thought to occur from microorganisms ascending from the perineum. Intraluminal contamination occurs by re\u00c1 ux of microorganisms from a contaminated urine drainage bag. 234 The bladder is normally sterile; in the non-catheterised patient, a UTI is usually identi\u00c0 ed from the symptoms of dysuria and frequency of urination. Patients who develop a UTI with a short-term indwelling urethral catheter in place may not experience these symptoms, and diagnosis may be based on other signs, such as fever or suprapubic or loin tenderness. 235 After a few days of catheterisation, microorganisms may be isolated from urine and, in the absence of any symptoms of UTI, this is called 'bacteriuria'. 236 The duration of catheterisation is the dominant risk factor for CAUTI, and virtually all catheterised patients develop bacteriuria within 1 month. 230 For the purpose of these guidelines, a duration of catheterisation of 28 days is considered to be a short-term catheterisation. 234 ",

            "text": "Several factors contribute to the potential development of CAUTI, including the formation of bio\u00c0 lms and encrustation of the catheter. Bacteria on the catheter surface and drainage bag multiply rapidly, adhering to the surface by excreting extracellular polysaccharides and forming a layer known as a 'bio\u00c0 lm'. Bacteria within the bio\u00c0 lm are morphologically and physiologically different from free-living planktonic bacteria in the urine, and have considerable survival advantages as they are protected from the action of antibiotic therapy. 234 Whilst bio\u00c0 lms commonly form on devices inserted into the body, they can cause additional problems on urethral catheters if the bacteria produce the enzyme urease, such as Proteus mirabilis. 234 This enzyme causes the urine to become alkaline, inducing crystallisation of calcium and magnesium phosphate within the urine. These crystals are incorporated into the bio\u00c0 lm and, over time, result in encrustation of the catheter. Encrustation is generally associated with long-term catheterisation, as it has a direct relationship with the length of catheterisation. 234 Urinary catheterisation is a frequent intervention during clinical care in hospital, affecting a signi\u00c0 cant number of patients. It has been estimated that 15-25% of hospitalised patients have a urinary catheter inserted during their stay. [237] [238] [239] [240] This number is much higher in ICUs. 241 The risk of infection is associated with the method and duration of catheterisation, the quality of catheter care and patient susceptibility. 242 Bacteriuria develops in approximately 30% of catheterised patients after 2-10 days, and 24% (95% CI 23-29%) of these will develop symptoms of CAUTI. 242 Approximately 3.6% (95% CI 3.4-3.8%) of those with CAUTI develop life-threatening secondary infections, such as bacteraemia or sepsis, where mortality rates range from 10% to 33%. 243, 244 CAUTI is associated with prolonged hospitalisation, re-admission and increased mortality. 245 Patients at particular risk are those who are immunocompromised, the elderly and patients with diabetes. 246 Physical and psychological discomfort associated with insertion, removal and the catheter in situ are common. 247 Complications such as in\u00c1 ammation, urethral strictures, mechanical trauma, bladder calculi and other infections of the renal system also occur. 237, [248] [249] [250] Urine retention after catheter removal is also a frequent occurrence. 251 In some instances, especially in older people, CAUTI may contribute to falls and delirium. 252 The treatment of both CAUTI and other infection sequelae contribute to the emerging problem of antibiotic resistance in hospitals, and uropathogens are a major source of infections caused by antimicrobial-resistant organisms. 253 CAUTI also increases the cost of health care due to delayed discharge from hospital, antimicrobial treatment and staff resources. The \u00c0 nancial burden of CAUTI on the NHS has been estimated as \u00a399 million per year, with an estimated cost per episode of \u00a31968. 254, 255 However, there are no robust economic assessments of the cost of CAUTI.",

This preference is often based on clinical experience, patient assessment and materials that induce the least allergic response. Smaller gauge catheters with a 10-mL balloon minimise urethral trauma, mucosal irritation and residual urine in the bladder; all factors that predispose to CAUTI. 270, 271 There is also a risk of urethral trauma associated with using a female length catheter in a male patient, and systems should be in place to ensure that this does not occur. 272 However, in adults that have recently undergone urological surgery, larger gauge catheters may be indicated to allow for the passage of blood clots. Our previous evidence-based guidelines 1 identi\u00c0 ed three experimental studies that compared the use of latex with silicone catheters, which found no signi\u00c0 cant difference in the incidence of bacteriuria. 249, 273, 274 We identi\u00c0 ed one new systematic review which included three trials that compared different types of standard (nonantiseptic-/non-antimicrobial-impregnated) catheters. These studies did not provide suf\u00c0 cient evidence to suggest that one type of catheter may be more effective than another for the prevention of bacteriuria. [274] [275] [276] [277] In our previous systematic review, 278 we found evidence related to the ef\u00c0 cacy of using short-term indwelling urethral catheters coated or impregnated with antiseptic or antimicrobial agents from four systematic reviews and one meta-analysis. In general, all of these \u00c0 ve studies suggested that antiseptic-impregnated or antimicrobial-coated shortterm indwelling urethral catheters can signi\u00c0 cantly prevent or delay the onset of CAUTI compared with standard untreated urinary catheters. 235, [279] [280] [281] [282] The consensus in these \u00c0 ve reviews of evidence, however, is that the individual studies reviewed are generally of poor quality; for instance, in one case, only eight studies out of 117 met the inclusion criteria, 280 and in another, of the six reports describing seven trials included, only one scored \u00c0 ve in the quality assessment. The other \u00c0 ve reports only scored one. 282 The studies included in these reviews investigated a wide range of coated or impregnated catheters, including catheters coated or impregnated with: silver alloy, 279, 280, [282] [283] [284] [285] [286] [287] [288] [289] silver oxide, 280 gendine, 290 gentamicin, 291 silverhydrogel, 292-294 minocycline, 294 rifampicin, 295 chlorhexidinesilver-sulfadiazine, 294 chlorhexideine-sulfadiazine-triclosan, 294 nitrofurazone 294 and nitrofuroxone. 296 Four studies compared the use of silver-coated (silver alloy or silver oxide) catheters with silicone, hydrogel or Te\u00c1 on \u00ae latex. 297-300 A systematic review and meta-analysis of these and other studies found that silver-alloy-coated (but not silver-oxide-coated) catheters were associated with a lower incidence of bacteriuria. 256, 280 Despite their unit cost, these devices may provide a costeffective option if overall numbers of infections are reduced signi\u00c0 cantly through their use. However, the few studies that have explored the cost-bene\u00c0 t/cost-effectiveness of using these devices have been inconclusive. 285, 287, 289, 291 We identi\u00c0 ed two new systematic reviews of the ef\u00c0 cacy of silver-coated or antimicrobial-impregnated catheters for the prevention of CAUTI. 235, 275 The \u00c0 rst systematic review included 22 RCTs, as well as one NRCT, and concluded that silver-coated (alloy or oxide) short-term indwelling urethral catheters reduced the risk of bacteriuria but did not demonstrate an effect on CAUTI. 275 Catheters impregnated with antimicrobial agents (minocycline, rifampicin or nitrofurazone) were found to reduce the rate of bacteriuria during the \u00c0 rst week of catheterisation, but not for catheter durations exceeding 1 week. Although antimicrobial-impregnated catheters reduced the risk of CAUTI, the number of cases was too small to demonstrate a signi\u00c0 cant effect. The second systematic review, which included nine RCTs and three quasi-experimental studies, concluded that, compared with standard catheters, both nitrofurazone-impregnated and silver-alloy-coated catheters can prevent and delay the onset of bacteriuria during short-term use. However, there were no data on the risk of CAUTI. 235 We identi\u00c0 ed one multi-centre RCT that compared silveralloy-coated and nitrofurazone-impregnated catheters with standard Te\u00c1 on-coated latex for short-term catheterisation. 301 Although the nitrofurazone-impregnated and silver-alloycoated catheters were associated with a reduced risk of CAUTI compared with the Te\u00c1 on-coated latex, the effect was not considered to be clinically effective (adjusted OR 0.81, 95% CI 0.66-1.01 and adjusted OR 0.96, 95% CI 0.78-1.19, respectively). The nitrofurazone-impregnated catheter, but not the silver-alloy-coated catheter, was associated with a signi\u00c0 cantly lower incidence of bacteriuria (OR 0.68, 95% CI 0.48-0.99, p=0.017). However, the nitrofurazone-impregnated catheter was associated with increased discomfort during the period the catheter was in place. A major limitation of this study was that the median duration of catheterisation was 2 S34 H. P. Loveday et al. / Journal of Hospital Infection 86S1 (2014) S1-S70 days (range 1-3 days) and the risk of CAUTI associated with this short period is correspondingly low. Also, UTIs developing up to 6 weeks post randomisation were included in the outcome measurement, even though they may not have been directly associated with catheterisation. The economic analysis suggested that nitrofurazone-impregnated catheters, but not silver-alloy-coated catheters, may be cost-effective, but the measures of cost were associated with a large amount of uncertainty.",

A systematic review has suggested that sealed (e.g. taped, pre-sealed) drainage systems contribute to preventing bacteriuria. 281 However, there is limited evidence regarding how often catheter bags should be changed. One study showed that higher rates of symptomatic and asymptomatic CAUTI were associated with a 3-day urinary drainage bag change regimen compared with no routine change regimen. 312 Best practice suggests that drainage bags should only be changed when necessary (i.e. according either to the manufacturer's recommendations or the patient's clinical need). 258, 302 Re\u00c1 ux of urine is associated with infection and, consequently, drainage bags should be positioned in a way that ensures the free \u00c1 ow of urine and prevents back-\u00c1 ow. 270, 302 It is also recommended that urinary drainage bags should be hung on an appropriate stand that prevents contact with the \u00c1 oor. 269 A number of studies have investigated the addition of disinfectants and antimicrobials to drainage bags as a way of preventing CAUTI. 256 Three acceptable studies 313-315 from our original systematic review 1 demonstrated no reduction in the incidence of bacteriuria following the addition of hydrogen peroxide or chlorhexidine to urinary drainage bags. These \u00c0 ndings are supported by a further systematic review, which suggested that adding bacterial solutions to drainage bags had no effect on catheter-associated infection. 281",

It included 14 studies (one RCT, one NRCT, three controlled before-after studies and nine uncontrolled before-after studies). 261 Interventions included prewritten or computer-generated stop orders, nurse-generated daily bedside reminders to remove catheters, and daily use of a checklist or protocol to review need for the catheter. Some studies also implemented catheter placement restrictions and education. The meta-analysis suggested that the use of reminder or stop order systems reduced the rate of CAUTI by 52% (p<0.001) and the mean duration of catheterisation by 37%, with 2.61 fewer days of catheterisation in the intervention group compared with the control group, and no difference in re-catheterisation rates.",

Coagulase-negative staphylococci, particularly Staphylococcus epidermidis, are the microorganisms most frequently implicated in CR-BSI. Other microorganisms commonly involved include S. aureus, Candida species and enterococci. [341] [342] [343] CR-BSI is generally caused either by skin microorganisms at the insertion site, which contaminate the catheter during insertion and migrate along the cutaneous catheter track after insertion, [344] [345] [346] or microorganisms from the hands of healthcare workers that contaminate and colonise the catheter hub during care interventions. 347 Less commonly, infusate contamination or seeding from a different site of infection in the body via the bloodstream is identi\u00c0 ed as a cause of CR-BSI. 348,349",

Clinical practices are addressed by a wide variety of educational strategies that do not draw upon pedagogic, theoretical or conceptual frameworks and consequently do not provide generalisable conclusions about the most effective approaches to education to improve practice. 358 The second systematic review concluded \u00c0 rst that educational interventions appear to have the most prolonged and profound effect when used in conjunction with audit and feedback, and when availability of clinical equipment is consistent with the content of the education provided. Second, that educational interventions will have a greater impact if baseline compliance with best practice is low. Third, that repeated educational sessions, fed into daily practice, using practical participation, appear to have a small, additional effect on practice change compared with education alone. 228 Healthcare workers should be aware of the manufacturers' advice relating to the compatibility of individual devices with antiseptic solutions, dwell time and connections to ensure safe use.",

One RCT demonstrated that subcutaneous tunnelling of short-term CVCs inserted into the internal jugular vein reduced the risk for CR-BSI. 396 In a later RCT, the same investigators failed to show a statistically signi\u00c0 cant difference in the risk for CR-BSI for subcutaneously tunnelled femoral vein catheters. 397 An additional meta-analysis of RCTs was focused on the ef\u00c0 cacy of tunnelling short-term CVCs to prevent catheterrelated infections. 398 Data synthesis demonstrated that tunnelling decreased catheter colonisation by 39% and decreased CR-BSI by 44% in comparison with non-tunnelled placement. The majority of the bene\u00c0 t in the decreased rate of catheter sepsis came from one trial of CVCs inserted at the internal jugular site. The reduction in risk was not signi\u00c0 cant when pooled with data from \u00c0 ve subclavian catheter trials. Tunnelling was not associated with increased risk of mechanical complications from placement or technical dif\u00c0 culties during placement. This meta-analysis concluded that tunnelling decreased catheterrelated infections; however, a synthesis of the evidence in this meta-analysis does not support routine subcutaneous tunnelling of short-term subclavian venous catheters, and this cannot be recommended unless ef\u00c0 cacy is evaluated at different placement sites and relative to other interventions.",

[399] [400] [401] [402] [403] [404] However, there is little recent robust evidence regarding comparison of rates of CR-BSI in PICCs vs other long-term central venous access devices. A prospective study 405 that compared the use of inpatient PICCs indicated a similar rate of CR-BSI to non-tunnelled catheters placed in the internal jugular or subclavian veins and a higher rate than cuffed and tunnelled (CT) catheters (PICC 3.5 CR-BSI per 1000 catheter-days vs nontunnelled 2.7 CR-BSI per 1000 catheter-days vs cuffed and tunnelled 1.6 CR-BSI per 1000 catheter-days). A systematic review of 200 studies indicated that when used in inpatients, PICCs pose a slightly lower risk of CR-BSI than standard noncuffed and non-medicated CVCs placed in the subclavian or internal jugular vein (2.1 CR-BSI per 1000 catheter-days vs 2.7 CR-BSI per 1000 catheter-days). 340 Neither we nor HICPAC identi\u00c0 ed any additional evidence of acceptable quality whilst updating our systematic review. 334 IVAD8 Use a tunnelled or implanted central venous access device with a subcutaneous port for patients in whom long-term vascular access is required.",

Evidence reviewed by HICPAC [406] [407] [408] [409] [410] [411] [412] [413] [414] [415] [416] indicated that the use of antimicrobial or antisepticimpregnated CVC in adults whose catheter is expected to remain in place for more than \u00c0 ve days could decrease the risk for CR-BSI. This may be cost-effective in high-risk patients (intensive care, burn and neutropenic patients) and in other patient populations in whom the rate of CR-BSI exceeds 3.3 per 1,000 catheter days even when there is a comprehensive strategy to reduce rates of CR-BSI. 406 A meta-analysis of 23 RCTs published between 1988-1999 included data on 4,660 catheters (2,319 anti-infective and 2,341 control). 417 Eleven of the trials in this meta-analysis were conducted in intensive care unit (ICU) settings; four among oncology patients, two among surgical patients; two among patients receiving total parenteral nutrition (TPN) and four among other patient populations. Study authors concluded that antibiotic and chlorhexidine-silver sulfadiazine coatings are anti-infective for short (approximately one week) insertion time. For longer insertion times, there was no data on antibiotic coating, and there is evidence of lack of effect for \u00c0 rst generation chlorhexidine-silver sulfadiazine coating. For silver-impregnated collagen cuffs, there is evidence of lack of effect for both short-and long-term insertion.",

The external surface of these catheters have three times the amount of chlorhexidine and extended release of the surface bound antiseptics than that in the \u00c0 rst generation catheters (which are coated with chlorhexidine/silver sulfadiazine only on the external luminal surface). Early studies indicated that the prolonged anti-infective activity associated with the second generation catheters improved ef\u00c0 cacy in preventing infections. 418 A systematic review and economic evaluation in 2006 concluded that rates of CR-BSI were statistically signi\u00c0 cantly reduced when an antimicrobial CVC was used. Studies in this review report the best effect when catheters were treated with minocycline/rifampin, or internally and externally treated with silver or chlorhexidine/silver sulfadiazine. A trend to statistical signi\u00c0 cance was seen in catheters only extraluminally coated. Investigation of other antibiotic treated catheters is limited to single studies with non-signi\u00c0 cant results. 419 We identi\u00c0 ed two additional systematic reviews and one RCT in our updated search. A recent Cochrane review of studies using impregnation, coating or bonding for reducing central venous catheter-related infections in adults included 56, predominantly unblinded studies, with low or unclear risk of bias. Patients with impregnated catheters had lower rates of CR-BSI (actual risk reduction of 2% (95% CI, 3% to 1%)), and catheter colonisation (actual risk reduction 10% (95% CI, 13% to 7%)). In terms of catheter colonisation sub-group analysis showed that impregnated catheters were more bene\u00c0 cial in studies conducted in intensive care units (RR 0.68 (95% CI, 0.59 to 0.78)) than in studies conducted in haemo-oncology (RR 0.75 (95% CI, 0.51 to 1.11)) or in patients requiring long-term parenteral nutrition RR 0.99 (95% CI, 0.74 to 1.34)). However, sub-group analysis did not identify the same bene\u00c0 t in terms of CR-BSI. There were no statistically signi\u00c0 cant differences in the overall rates of bloodstream infections or mortality, although these outcomes were less often assessed than CR-BSI and catheter colonisation. 420 A collaborative network metaanalysis of CVC use in adults indicated that rifampicin-based impregnated CVC was the only type of impregnated/coated CVC that reduced catheter colonisation and CR-BSI compared with standard CVC. 421 In a single blind non-inferiority trial, authors concluded that CVC coated with 5-\u00c1 uorouracil were non-inferior to chlorhexidine and silver sulfadiazine coated CVCs with respect to the incidence of catheter colonisation (2.9% vs. 5.3%, respectively). 422",

Consequently, the use of ultrasound may indirectly reduce the risk of infection by facilitating mechanically uncomplicated subclavian placement.

Their search identi\u00c0 ed 95 papers discussing the prevention of CR-BSI. The majority of these were narrative reviews or consensus statements. Three primary research studies, differing in design, patient population and clinical settings, that compared infection outcomes using MSB precautions with less stringent barrier techniques, concluded that the use of MSB precautions resulted in a reduction in catheter-related infections. The authors concluded that using MSB precautions appears to decrease transmission of microorganisms, delay colonisation and reduce the rate of HCAI. They also suggested that biological plausibility and the available evidence support using MSB precautions during routine insertion of a CVC to minimise the risk of infection. They recommended that, given the lack of adverse patient reactions, the relatively low cost of MSB precautions and the high cost of CR-BSI, it is probable that MSB precautions will prove to be a cost-effective, or even a cost-saving, intervention. 445 Neither we nor HICPAC identi\u00c0 ed any additional evidence of acceptable quality whilst updating our systematic review. 334 IVAD13 Use maximal sterile barrier precautions for the insertion of central venous access devices.

In this analysis, several types of CHG solution were used in the individual trials, including 0.5% or 1% CHG alcohol solution and 0.5% or 2% CHG aqueous solution. All of these solutions provided a concentration of CHG that is higher than the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) for most nosocomial bacteria and yeasts. Subset analysis of aqueous and non-aqueous solutions showed similar effect sizes, but only the subset analysis of the \u00c0 ve studies that used alcoholic CHG solution produced a signi\u00c0 cant reduction in CR-BSI. As few studies used CHG aqueous solution, the lack of a signi\u00c0 cant difference seen for this solution compared with PVI solution may be a result of inadequate statistical power. Additionally, an economic decision analysis based on available evidence from the same authors suggested that the use of CHG, rather than PVI, for skin care would result in a 1.6% decrease in the incidence of CR-BSI, a 0.23% decrease in mortality, and \u00c0 nancial savings per catheter used. 451 Several studies were examined that focused on the application of antimicrobial ointments to the catheter site at the time of catheter insertion, or during routine dressing changes, to reduce microbial contamination of catheter insertion sites. 448 Reported ef\u00c0 cacy of this practice for the prevention of catheter-related infections yielded contradictory \u00c0 ndings. [449] [450] [451] [452] [453] [454] [455] [456] [457] There was also concern that the use of polyantibiotic ointments that were not fungicidal could signi\u00c0 cantly increase the rate of colonisation of the catheter by Candida species. 458, 459 NICE 56 identi\u00c0 ed three RCTs that compared the effectiveness of different antiseptic solutions for the insertion of PVCs in hospitalised patients. The evidence from these studies was considered to be of very low quality, and no conclusion could be drawn about the bene\u00c0 ts of one particular antiseptic solution over another. However, while there is no evidence comparing different concentrations of CHG, the reviewers indicated that the trend in the evidence suggests that CHG in alcohol may be more effective than PVI in alcohol.",

Results suggested that the use of needleless connectors may reduce the microbial contamination rate of CVC luers compared with standard caps. Furthermore, disinfection of needleless connectors with either chlorhexidine/alcohol or PVI signi\u00c0 cantly reduced external microbial contamination. Both these strategies may reduce the risk of catheter-related infections acquired via the intraluminal route. 484 We found no RCT evidence comparing the ef\u00c0 cacy of different methods for the decontamination of ports and hubs prior to access. Expert opinion, based on consensus and evidence extrapolated from experimental studies of hub decontamination, 56, 485, 486 and studies of skin decontamination prior to insertion and during dressing changes, suggests that injection ports or catheter hubs should be decontaminated for a minimum of 15 s using CHG in 70% alcohol before and after accessing the system. Although most intravascular catheters and catheter hub materials are now chemically compatible with alcohol or iodine, some may be incompatible and therefore the manufacturer's recommendations should be followed. IVAD30 A single-use application of 2% chlorhexidine gluconate in 70% isopropyl alcohol (or povidone iodine in alcohol for patients with sensitivity to chlorhexidine) should be used to decontaminate the access port or catheter hub.

In addition, system changes that prompted the clinician to 'do the right thing' included placing all the equipment needed in a cart for ease of access; the use of a checklist; authorising staff to halt procedures if best practice was not being followed; daily rounds to ensure the timely removal of CVCs; feedback of CR-BSI cases to clinical staff; and organisational support to purchase essential equipment and solutions prior to the start of the study.",
