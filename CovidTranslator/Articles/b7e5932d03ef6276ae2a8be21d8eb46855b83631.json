The dynamic trafficking of positive strand RNA virus nucleocapsid proteins and PRRSV N protein in particular between the cytoplasm and nucleolus is unknown. In this study live imaging of permissive and non-permissive cell lines, in conjunction with photo-bleaching (FRAP and FLIP), was used to investigate the trafficking of fluorescent labeled (EGFP) PRRSV-N protein. The data indicated that EGFP-PRRSV-N protein was not permanently sequestered to the nucleolus and had equivalent mobility to cellular nucleolar proteins. Further the nuclear import of N protein appeared to occur faster than nuclear export, which may account for the observed relative distribution of N protein between the cytoplasm and the nucleolus.",

This property is common with related viruses including the equine arterivirus (EAV) N protein (Tijms et al., 2002) and the coronavirus N proteins Wurm et al., 2001) with the possible exception of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) N protein (Li et al., 2005; Rowland et al., 2005; Timani et al., 2005; You et al., 2005; You et al., 2007) .

Solution of the nucleolar proteome (Andersen et al., 2002) has indicated that the nucleolus has a number of functions ranging from ribosome subunit biogenesis to non-classical functions such as the stress response (Mayer and Grummt, 2005; Rubbi and Milner, 2003) and regulation of cell growth (Hernandez-Verdun and Roussel, 2003) . Virology 378 (2008) There are over 700 proteins associated with the nucleolar proteome (Leung et al., 2006) and these include nucleolin, fibrillarin and B23.1. Localisation of positive strand RNA virus capsid proteins and replication proteins (and in one case partial RNA synthesis) in the nucleus and/or nucleolus appears to be an emerging feature of positive strand RNA viruses. The reason why positive strand RNA virus capsid proteins localise to the nucleolus is unknown, and several hypotheses have been proposed including; as part of a cellular defense mechanism to sequester viral proteins away from sites of virus replication and assembly, to recruit nucleolar proteins to facilitate virus replication, to usurp cellular processes by disrupting the nucleolar proteome or because the viral protein contains motifs which mimic nucleolar localisation signals (NoLSs) (Hiscox, 2002 (Hiscox, , 2003 (Hiscox, , 2007 Uchil et al., 2006; Weidman et al., 2003) .",

Assembly also occurs in the cytoplasm; therefore capsid proteins are required in this cellular compartment to facilitate these processes. This would infer the need for appropriate trafficking signals to ensure import and export from the nucleus and several such motifs have been identified. Mutational analysis and abrogation of nuclear/nucleolar localisation of viral proteins for the PRRSV N protein (Lee et al., 2006; Pei et al., 2008) and the positive strand RNA plant RNA virus groundnut rosette virus ORF3 (Kim et al., 2007a,b) have elegantly demonstrated the importance of nucleolar localisation in the biology of these viruses.",

Two different localisation patterns of EGFP-PRRSV-N protein were observed: In 3D4/31 cells which expressed lower amounts of EGFP-PRRSV-N protein, localisation was predominately nucleolar with some nuclear signal (Fig. 1A, panel A) . In 3D4/31 cells which expressed higher amounts of protein localisation was predominately either cytoplasmic and nucleolar (Fig. 1A , panel C) or predominately nucleolar with some cytoplasmic and nuclear signal (Fig. 1A, panel D) . This difference in expression was evident in that the fluorescent signal from EGFP-PRRSV-N protein in Fig. 1A , panel A was captured in the linear range. However, using the same setting led to over-saturated pixels in cells expressing higher amounts of EGFP-PRRSV-N protein e.g. Fig. 1A , panel B (red indicates that the image range is not linear). Gain adjustment to ensure pixels were captured in the linear range restored image clarity (Fig. 1A , panel C). Nucleolar localisation of EGFP-PRRSV-N protein was confirmed due to colocalisation with the nucleolar marker protein DsRed-B23.1 (yellow signal).

N protein could diffuse and/or be actively transported into the nucleus through the nuclear pore complex (NPC), diffuse through the nucleoplasm and be permanently sequestered in the nucleolus. As the nucleolar concentration of N protein becomes saturating so excess protein could either diffuse or be actively transported through the NPC to the cytoplasm. Alternatively, N protein could be continuously exchanged between the nucleolus and the nucleus and the cytoplasm, with localisation being driven by possible differential relative trafficking rates between nuclear import and export. To investigate and discriminate between these possibilities dynamic live cell imaging using fluorescence loss in photobleaching (FLIP) and fluorescence recovery after photo-bleaching (FRAP) was used to study movement of EGFP-PRRSV-N protein.",

Loss of fluorescence is then a result of the EGFP-tagged fusion protein trafficking into and out of the photo-bleached area with time. The data indicated that by 180s, loss of fluorescence from cells expressing EGFP-nucleolin and EGFP-fibrillarin was greater than EGFP-B23.1. In cells expressing lower amounts of EGFP-PRRSV-N protein, fluorescence was completely photo-bleached by 120s and in higher expressing cells EGFP-PRRSV-N protein fluorescence was completely photo-bleached in the nucleus and reduced in the cytoplasm by 180s (Fig. 1B) .

The data indicated that EGFP-PRRSV-N protein had the lowest t 1/2 value and therefore had a slightly faster mobility than the three cellular nucleolar marker proteins used in this study. Cellular nucleolar proteins can have different mobility rates and nucleolar localisation patterns depending on their functions (Andersen et al., 2005) and can show a continuous rapid turn over between the nucleus and the nucleolusyet the overall structure of the nucleolus is maintained (Misteli, 2001) . The diffusion coefficient (D) value of EGFP-PRRSV-N protein and EGFP-nucleolin, EGFP-B23.1 and EFP-fibrillarin was calculated from the recovery curves (Phair and Misteli, 2000) . This value is the rate at which a protein repopulates a photo-bleached area. This confirmed that EGFP-PRRSV-N protein had an equivalent (or slightly higher) mobility (D = 0.839 \u03bcm 2 /s) than EGFP-nucleolin (D = 0.156\u03bcm 2 /s), EGFP-fibrillarin (D = 0.278\u03bcm 2 /s) or EGFP-B23.1 (D = 0.166\u03bcm 2 /s). In a previous study the half time of EGFP-fibrillarin in BHK cells was reported to be approximately 3s with a D value of 0.53\u03bcm 2 /s (Phair and Misteli, 2000) , which is in similar agreement to this study. Phair and Misteli (2000) noted that the D values of EGFP-fibrillarin and other fluorescent tagged nuclear/nucleolar proteins were 100 times lower than that reported for free solutes in the nucleus and suggested that this was due to interactions with other nuclear components. Therefore, similar to the cellular nucleolar proteins the mobility of EGFP-PRRSV-N protein indicated that N protein probably localised to the nucleolus by diffusing through the nucleoplasm until it located an appropriate binding site, possibly a nucleolar protein or ribosomal RNA, and thus appeared to accumulate in this compartment. PRRSV N protein has been shown to interact with fibrillarin .",

For example, the nucleolin binding activity of hepatitis delta antigen is associated with nucleolar localisation (Ning and Shih, 2004) . PRRSV N protein has also been shown to interact with importin-\u03b1 and importin-\u03b2 and is sensitive to leptomycin B (LMB), an inhibitor of CRM1-dependent export . Several different nuclear-cytoplasmic trafficking pathways are utilized by viruses (Whittaker et al., 2000) and have been described for a number of different virus nucleocapsids and nucleocapsid proteins. For example, in vesicular stomatitis virus nucleocapsids are trafficked via a microtubule mediated process (Das et al., 2006) , as are the Hantaan virus nucleocapsid protein (Ramanathan et al., 2007) and the West Nile virus capsid protein (Chu and Ng, 2002) . To investigate whether the trafficking of N protein between the cytoplasm and the nucleus/nucleolus was associated with microtubules or energy dependent, the mobility of EGFP-PRRSV-N protein was compared in 3D4/31 cells incubated at 37\u00b0C in the presence and absence of nocodazole (60ng/ml nocodazole (Sigma) for 16h), a microtubule inhibitor, or incubated at 10\u00b0C. In preparations of fixed cells, in the absence of nocodazole (Fig. 3A ) microtubules were visualized (observed as filaments) using an anti-tubulin antibody. As before EGFP-PRRSV-N protein localised predominately to the nucleolus. In preparations of fixed cells in the presence of nocodazole (Fig. 3B ) microtubule polymerization was inhibited (diffuse staining of tubulin), although similar to untreated cells, EGFP-PRRSV-N protein remained predominately localised in the nucleolus. The activity of nocodazole was also confirmed by analyzing the cell cycle stage of treated cells (using flow cytometry as described previously Harrison et al., 2007) ), which demonstrated enrichment in the G2/M stage (Fig. 3B ) compared to untreated cells (Fig. 3A) , and is a result of the inhibition of spindle formation in metaphase. To investigate the trafficking of EGFP-PRRSV-N protein in live cells, a nucleolus in 3D4/31 cells expressing EGFP-PRRSV-N protein was continuously photo-bleached (FLIP) in the presence of nocodazole at 37\u00b0C (Fig. 3C ) and in the absence of nocodazole in cells that had been pre-cooled to 10\u00b0C (Fig. 3D) . In both cases, photo-bleaching resulted in the loss of fluorescent signal in both the cytoplasm (where appropriate) and nucleus and the non photo-bleached nucleolus, indicating that cytoplasmic to nuclear trafficking occurred, and was not inhibited by either the presence of nocodazole or cooling to 10\u00b0C. This suggested that the trafficking of N protein from the cytoplasm to the nucleus was not microtubule or energy dependent. To investigate trafficking within the nucleolus a defined portion of the nucleolus was photobleached (FRAP) in cells incubated at either 37\u00b0C, 10\u00b0C or 37\u00b0C in the presence of nocodazole (Fig. 4A ) and the time taken to refill the photobleached area was measured (Fig. 4B) . The data indicated that EGFP-PRRSV-N protein at 37\u00b0C had a t 1/2 value of 0.74 \u00b1 0.07 which was similar to the t 1/2 value (0.75 \u00b1 0.18) at 4\u00b0C and at 37\u00b0C in the presence of nocodazole (t 1/2 value of 1.37 \u00b1 0.55).",

PRRSV N protein is approximately 15kDa (and with the addition of EGFP approximately 42kDa) and although the fusion protein has the potential to freely diffuse through the NPC (which has a size exclusion limit for passive transport of approximately 50kDa (Macara, 2001; Terry et al., 2007) ), clearly EGFP-PRRSV-N protein has a discrete localisation pattern being cytoplasmic and nucleolar (with some nuclear signal) (Rowland et al., 1999) .

This takes into account the reduction in fluorescence during photo-bleaching due to ongoing trafficking into and out of the bleach area. In EGFP-expressing 3D4/31 cells the pre-bleach level of EGFP in the nucleus to that of the cytoplasm was 0.56 \u00b1 0.05 to 0.44 \u00b1 0.03, respectively.

In comparison, little fluorescence (approximately~5% of total fluorescence) of EGFP-PRRSV-N protein was observed in the cytoplasm in both MARC-145 and HeLa cells and photobleaching in the nucleus resulted in loss of fluorescence from the nucleoplasm and then the nucleolus (Figs. 7C and 8C upper panels, respectively) . In approximately 10% of cells expressing EGFP-PRRSV-N protein fluorescence was observed in the cytoplasm, but only if imaging was adjusted so that the fluorescent signal in the nucleus/nucleolus was above the linear range (for example Fig. 8C, lower panels) . In this case photo-bleaching in the nucleus resulted in loss of fluorescence from the cytoplasm which could be accounted by faster trafficking into the nucleus of non-photo-bleached protein which was then photo-bleached than the export of photo-bleached protein into the cytoplasm. Photobleaching in the cytoplasm of either MARC-145 cells or HeLa cells expressing EGFP resulted in loss of signal from both the nucleus and the cytoplasm (Figs. 7D and 8D, respectively) . In comparison, photobleaching in the cytoplasm of either MARC-145 cells or HeLa cells expressing EGFP-PRRSV-N protein resulted in less loss of fluorescence when compared to EGFP (Figs. 7E and 8E) . The photo-bleaching analysis for EGFP-PRRSV-N protein also indicated that when the nucleus was photo-bleached loss of fluorescence in the cytoplasm was due to the trafficking of non photo-bleached protein into the nucleus rather than the rapid export of photo-bleached protein from the nucleus into the cytoplasm.

            "text": "Thus we propose a model of N protein trafficking in which the nuclear import of N protein is faster than the nuclear export and N protein is apparently localised in greater amounts in the nucleolus (Fig. 9) . The deficiency of the model is that the analysis was conducted in the absence of other viral proteins or RNA (i.e. infected cells) which may associate with N protein and alter its relative trafficking rates. This may be certainly true for the cytoplasm, where N protein will complex with viral RNA and possibly components of the replicase complex. Although there is currently no published data that other PRRSV macromolecules localise in the nucleus/nucleolus, the EAV non-structural protein 1 (nsp1) has also been observed in the nucleus (Tijms et al., 2002) , and therefore PRRSV nsp1 may have similar properties. PRRSV N protein does not accumulate or is sequestered in the nucleus/nucleolus per se and in common with other cellular nuclear/nucleolar proteins is continuously being exchanged between the nucleolus and the nucleoplasm and indeed is as mobile as the cellular nucleolar proteins examined. The implication of this study is that all de novo synthesized N protein (when over-expressed) traffics to the nucleolus. Together with molecular genetic analysis showing that virus replication is reduced when N protein nucleolar localisation is abolished (Lee et al., 2006; Pei et al., 2008) , suggests that the nucleolar trafficking of N protein is playing a crucial role in virus biology. What this role is remains to be elucidated.",
