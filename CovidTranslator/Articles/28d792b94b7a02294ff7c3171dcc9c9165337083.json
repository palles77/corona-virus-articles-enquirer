EBOV outbreaks are sporadic and unpredictable in nature; therefore, a vaccine that is able to provide durable immunity is needed to protect those who are at risk of exposure to the virus. This study assesses the long-term efficacy of the vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV)-based vaccine (VSV G/EBOVGP) in two rodent models of EBOV infection. Mice and guinea pigs were first immunized with 2 \u00d7 10 4 or 2 \u00d7 10 5 plaque forming units (PFU) of VSV G/EBOVGP, respectively. Challenge of mice with a lethal dose of mouse-adapted EBOV (MA-EBOV) at 6.5 and 9 months after vaccination provided complete protection, and 80% (12 of 15 survivors) protection at 12 months after vaccination. Challenge of guinea pigs with a lethal dose of guinea pig-adapted EBOV (GA-EBOV) at 7, 12 and 18 months after vaccination resulted in 83% (5 of 6 survivors) at 7 months after vaccination, and 100% survival at 12 and 18 months after vaccination. No weight loss or clinical signs were observed in the surviving animals. Antibody responses were analyzed using sera from individual rodents. Levels of EBOV glycoprotein-specific IgG antibody measured immediately before challenge appeared to correlate with protection. These studies confirm that vaccination with VSV G/EBOVGP is able to confer long-term protection against Ebola infection in mice and guinea pigs, and support follow-up studies in non-human primates.",

Past EBOV outbreaks have been sporadic in nature and confined to central Africa, in which the aggregate number of infections up to early 2014 have caused 1093 deaths from 1393 total cases, for a 78.5% case fatality rate [1] . The EBOV outbreak in the West African countries of Guinea and Liberia in 2014, as well as confirmed imported cases in Sierra Leone and several suspected cases in the surrounding countries, indicates that EBOV is geographically more widespread than previously thought. The identity of the EBOV reservoir remains elusive despite efforts, although it has been suggested that fruit bats are one of the potential reservoir species [2] . This complicates the strategy of eradicating EBOV and preventing its transmission to humans by targeting the reservoir for vaccination. As a result, there is a need for a preventive vaccination program tailored for humans at high risk of exposure to EBOV, such as residents of areas considered endemic for EBOV, primary health care providers in these endemic areas, as well as biosafety level (BSL)-4 laboratory researchers.",

            "text": "There are several factors to consider before the potential implementation of an EBOV vaccination program, which include cross-protection against other Ebola species, pre-existing immunity of the recipient population to the vaccine vector, ease of implementing the vaccine regimen and sustained vaccine-induced protection. Several experimental vaccine platforms, most of which express the EBOV glycoprotein (GP) as the viral antigen of choice for immunizations, have demonstrated protection in nonhuman primates (NHPs) against lethal EBOV challenge. These vaccine platforms include a DNA prime with a human adenovirus serotype 5 (Ad5) boost [3] , Ad5 alone [4] , virus-like particles [5] , human parainfluenza virus type 3 [6] , rabies virus [7] as well as vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) [8] . http From the candidates listed above, the live-attenuated VSVbased vaccine (VSV G/EBOVGP) is unique in that it has demonstrated both prophylactic and post-exposure efficacy [8, 9] , suggesting that the vaccine is able to rapidly establish protective immunity in the recipient after immunization. Mucosal vaccination with VSV G/EBOVGP via the intranasal (IN) or oral (OR) routes still protects NHPs [10] , easing the difficulty of administration by eliminating the use of needles. VSV-based vaccines expressing GP from either Marburg virus (MARV) or Sudan virus (SUDV) (known as VSV G/MARVGP or VSV /SUDVGP, respectively) are able to protect against a homologous virus challenge [11, 12] . A blended vaccine consisting of equal parts VSV G/EBOVGP, VSV G/MARVGP and VSV G/SUDVGP conferred complete protection against EBOV, MARV or SUDV challenge [13] . Complete protection was also achieved in these NHPs after challenge with Tai Forest virus (TAFV), suggesting evidence of cross-protection [13] . VSV G/EBOVGP has been previously administered as an emergency treatment to a researcher on compassionate grounds after a suspected EBOV exposure in the laboratory. Aside from a fever detected 12 h after vaccination, the recipient remained healthy [14] . While clinical trials will be needed, this is a positive sign for the safety of VSV-based vaccines. Pre-existing immunity to VSV is not prevalent in humans [15] [16] [17] , and therefore it is not expected to be a significant factor in a potential vaccination campaign with VSV-based vaccines.",

Additionally, mice vaccinated with recombinant VSV encoding the hemagglutinin antigen of H5N1 influenza virus were still completely protected 1 year after vaccination [19] , and VSV expressing the Andes virus glycoproteins was still efficacious after 6 months in Syrian hamsters [20] . Protection from Andes virus challenge was still observed in Syrian hamsters 1 year after VSV immunization; however, it was not possible to distinguish vaccine efficacy from an increased resistance to infection with age in the control animals [20] . Recently, the VSV G/MARVGP vaccine was shown to provide full protection in cynomolgus macaques challenged 14 months after immunization [21] , demonstrating that the VSV platform has the potential to provide durable immunity.",

After the initial immunization, groups of five animals for each treatment were challenged IP with 1000 \u00d7 LD 50 of mouse-adapted EBOV (MA-EBOV) at 6.5 or 9 months after vaccination. Weight change and clinical symptoms were monitored daily for 15 days, and survival was monitored until 28 days postinfection (dpi). Of note, a larger number of animals (10 for DMEM and 15 for VSV G/EBOVGP) were challenged at 12 months postvaccination, because some previously vaccinated and unchallenged mice housed in BSL-2 containment unexpectedly died due to old age [24] . A decision was made to challenge the remaining mice, as longer intervals between immunization and challenge could not be reliably assessed beyond 12 months in this animal model. Mocktreated animals rapidly lost weight after MA-EBOV challenge and succumbed to disease by 7 dpi. The mean time to death (MTD) of all control mice was 5.4 \u00b1 1.0 days. In contrast, mice immunized with VSV G/EBOVGP were completely protected against MA-EBOV when challenged at 6.5 and 9 months after vaccination, and did not display observable weight loss ( Fig. 1A-D) . When challenge was performed 12 months after vaccination, 12 of 15 (80%) animals were protected from MA-EBOV.

Space limitations in high bio-containment laboratories and the prohibitive costs of maintaining NHPs over a longer period of time are also reasons behind why there are very few studies investigating the long-term protection of EBOV vaccines. The data presented in this study show that a single injection of VSV G/EBOVGP provides durable protection in rodents. Similar to a previous study [25] , VSV G/EBOVGP viremia was not detected in the immunized animals when RT-qPCR was performed on sera at 3 months after vaccination (data not shown), and there were no clinical signs after immunization. As highlighted by the 100% survival in guinea pigs challenged 18 months after immunization, the VSV-based vaccine is a promising long-term vaccine candidate. However, it was unknown whether sterile immunity was observed in these animals, as EBOV viremia was not measured after challenge. Specific IgG responses decreased at 12 months after vaccination in mice. This could be due to the old age of the animals, and may indicate the need for booster vaccinations later in life. Additionally, a primeboost regimen may also be necessary to elicit a protective immune response in older animals.",

A standard ELISA and several microliters of sera were, in hindsight, sufficient to predict survival outcome in each rodent. Decreased levels of circulating specific IgG may be indicative of declining immunity, as observed in the non-surviving mice, or a poor vaccine response, as observed in the non-surviving guinea pig. Follow-up studies will be necessary to confirm these trends. It should be noted that since IgG antibody levels did not decrease in guinea pigs at the time of latest challenge, the antibody data suggest that protection may be possible beyond 18 months after immunization. Furthermore, these studies warrant further investigation in NHPs, which allows for full characterization of the immune response. This was not possible in the current experiments either due to small blood volumes from individual mice or the lack of available reagents to more thoroughly study the immune responses in guinea pigs.",

Four of six animals were protected against a subsequent re-challenge that took place 13 weeks after the original exposure. Comparison of the immune responses between surviving and non-surviving animals showed that a non-protective immune response was generated after the first challenge, as indicated by the absence of memory IFN-\u2425 secreting EBOV GP-specific CD4+ T-cells, coupled with 10-fold lower IgG levels [26] . Immune responses were also characterized in human survivor after several outbreaks. For EBOV infections, analysis of 14 survivors from the Kikwit outbreak in 1995 showed that EBOV-specific IgG antibodies were still detectable up to 2 years after the onset of symptoms [27] , whereas two survivors from the Yambuku outbreak in 1976 had persistent IgG responses when sampled 10 years after infection [28] . When survivors of the 1996 and 2001 Gabon outbreaks were sampled, a decrease in the levels of EBOV-specific IgG was observed in 5 of 9 surviving patients, however circulating IgG was still readily detectable [29] .",

Neutralizing antibodies were detected in only 4 of the 6 survivors [30] . The prevalence of SUDV-specific IgG antibodies amongst the survivors was also found to decline over time, as 61% of survivors (33 individuals/54 total) initially tested positive for SUDV-specific antibodies during the original outbreak, but this changed to 73% (29/40), 66% (32/48), and 41% (13/32) when re-tested after 6 months, 2 and 10 years [31] . In summary, a specific IgG response can be detected in human survivors of Ebola infections. However, conclusions and trends cannot be drawn based on these results, as samples from non-survivors would not be available for direct comparison. A laboratory-based approach using animals will be required to determine whether these sustained immune responses are sufficient for protection from disease in case of potential re-exposure.

However, in order to mount an effective immunization campaign, the vaccine must also demonstrate sustained and durable protection over a reasonable period of time. Therefore, these results will be of particular relevance for those who are at a constant risk of EBOV infection. The development of an efficacious vaccine capable of sustained protection, in addition to establishing a simple but dependable measure to test for the strength of long-term vaccine-induced immunity, will provide more options in the control of future EBOV outbreaks.",

After washing, the substrate (ABTS + H 2 O 2 , KPL) was added for 30 min at 37 \u2022 C, before reading on a Versamax Microplate reader (Molecular Devices) at 405 nm. The data were analyzed with the SoftMaxPro 6.1 software. The resulting data are expressed as endpoint dilutions and a sample was deemed positive when the absorbance was greater than five standard deviations from the pre-vaccination control sample for each animal. The titers were plotted using GraphPad Prism 5 and the limit of detection for this assay was 100 reciprocal dilutions. Samples were assayed in triplicate and the average titer was reported.",
