A novel coronavirus termed SARS-CoV was identified as the etiological agent (Drosten et al., 2003a; Drosten et al., 2003b) . The World Health Organization (WHO) reported 8098 SARS cases from November 2002 to July 2003, and approximately 10% of the patients died (http://who. int/csr/sars/country/table2003_09_23/en/). Subsequent outbreaks including two laboratory events occurred, but they were rapidly contained. These outbreaks demonstrated the need for strategies to treat sporadic cases of SARS disease, including economical lethal rodent models that would simulate human SARS disease.",

Hyaline membrane formation is a hallmark of SARS-CoV lung damage in humans (Hsiao et al., 2005) . In addition to the hyaline membrane formation in severe SARS cases, findings could include serous, fibrinous, and hemorrhagic inflammation in pulmonary alveoli with capillary engorgement, including micro-thrombosis in some of these capillaries (Lang et al., 2003) . Pulmonary alveoli are thickened with interstitial mononuclear inflammatory infiltrates. Desquamation of pneumocytes can be detected along with fibrinoid materials, and erythrocytes in alveolar spaces (Lang et al., 2003) . Cell types in the respiratory tract in which SARS-CoV antigen has been detected include the following: alveolar epithelial cells (primarily type II pneumocytes), bronchial epithelial cells, and alveolar macrophages (Ding et al., 2004; Ye et al., 2007) . These cell types all have the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which has been identified as one of the receptors to which SARS-CoV binds in order to be taken up into host cells (Li et al., 2005a; .",

The utility of various animal models has been extensively reviewed by . Briefly, the non-primate models do not exactly model the lung pathology found in humans. For example, hyaline membrane formation is not seen at all or rarely detected. In the rodent models, fever is also not detected. Nevertheless rodent models may be the most utile of the models because of low expense, ease of handling, defined genetics, and the possibility of doing large-scale statistically significant studies. Because of these advantages, a lethal rodent model would be extremely valuable in antiviral drug testing where the amounts of experimental compound available for evaluation in animals are often limited.",

To date, there is no approved agent for treating SARS-CoV and no agent has reached human clinical trials (Wong and Yuen, 2008) . This is due to lack of animal model testing among other reasons. Ribavirin had been used to treat SARS infections in 2003 and 2004, but its efficacy is questionable and it may exacerbate disease in mice (Barnard et al., 2006b) and humans (Stockman, Bellamy, and Garner, 2006) . Wu and others have recently reviewed the state of drug discovery for SARS-CoV antiviral agents (Pyrc, Berkhout, and van der Hoek, 2007; Stockman, Bellamy, and Garner, 2006; Tong, 2009b; Wu et al., 2006; Yeung and Meanwell, 2007) . In the current study, we report on the pathogenesis and genetic changes of a SARS-CoV strain, called v2163, which was adapted from SARS-CoV Urbani by 25 serial passages to cause a lethal pulmonary syndrome in 5-to 6-week-old mice. Using multiple drugs with purported antiviral activity, the utility of the new strain as a model virus for evaluating drugs in cell culture and in mice is shown.",

The v2163 virus caused severe signs of illness in 5-to 6-week-old BALB/c mice including ruffled fur and lethargy within 3-4 days and death by day 6. Another lethal mouse-adapted strain designated as MA15 (Roberts et al., 2007) was tested in parallel for comparison. Both mouse-adapted strains caused substantial weight loss and produced high virus titers in the lungs of infected mice (Table 1 ). In contrast, SARS-CoV strain Urbani-infected mice had no significant weight loss compared with uninfected controls, although they had moderate virus titers in the lungs 3 days post-virus exposure as shown previously by Barnard et al. (2006a,b) . Lung virus titers at 3 days post-virus inoculation (d.p.i.) were higher in v2163-infected mice than in MA15-infected mice. Lung titers did not appear dependent on the level of virus inoculum, but did differ depending on the virus strain.

Levels of IL-1\u03b2, IL-2, IL-3, IL-4, IL-5, IL-9, IL-10, TNF-\u03b1, and GM-CSF were below the minimum detection level for all test groups (\u226438 pg/mL of lung homogenate). Low levels of IFN-\u03b3 were observed with both mouse-adapted strains but not detected with the Urbani strain. Two out of 10 v2163-inoculated mice showed low cytokine response, and were excluded from cytokine analysis because they also had little or no virus detected in their lungs. The MA15 virus stimulated significantly more MIP-1\u03b1 and RANTES compared with Urbani (P b 0.05), and the v2163 virus caused significantly greater MCP-1 response than Urbani (P b 0.01). A significantly higher IL-6 response compared with the wild-type Urbani strain was observed from both v2163 and MA15 mouseadapted strains (P b 0.001 and P b 0.05, respectively). The v2163infected mice expressed 6-fold more IL-6 than the MA15-infected mice. At the infection level used in this experiment, 100% of v2163infected mice died and no MA15-infected mice died, showing a correlation between IL-6 concentrations in the lungs and mortality.",

All three MA15-infected lungs showed small numbers of foamy macrophages and small numbers of neutrophils. Alveolar septae were seen in two of the three MA15-infected lungs. One MA15-infected lung had rare individual bronchiolar lining cells that were swollen and hypereosinophilic and degenerate. Pathological changes were observed in two of the three v2163-infected lungs; one had moderate numbers of neutrophils, edema fluid surrounding several large vessels, and rare granulomas containing refractile central fragments of foreign material replacing groups of alveoli. Another v2163-infected lung showed small numbers of alveolar macrophages throughout airspaces. In general, lungs infected with MA15 or v2163 showed acute to subacute alveolitis with some perivascular edema in some sections (Fig. 4) . Differences between the two mouse-adapted strains were minimal. Hyaline membrane formation, as occurs in human SARS patients (Roberts et al., 2005) , was not observed.",

We also evaluated the novel drugs EP128533, a dipeptidyl glutaminyl fluoromethylketone protease inhibitor (Zhang et al., 2006) , and UDA, a lectin that impedes viral fusion and egress (Keyaerts et al., 2007) . Ampligen\u2122 (10 mg/kg/day) afforded mice complete protection against death, reduced virus titers in the lungs, and significantly reduced lung scores and weight loss (Table 3) . UDA treatment of 5 mg/kg/day resulted in 50% protection from death up to 10 days after infection (Table 3) , but no reduction in lung virus titer. A replicate 21-day study showed 40% protection and no measurable (Table 3) . Virus lung titers from mice treated with ribavirin were no different than those detected from control mice on 3 d.p.i., but at 6 d.p.i. the titers in ribavirin-treated mice were higher than those detected in the control group, suggesting that ribavirin prolonged lung infection, although this difference was not statistically significant (Table 3) . Gross pathology (lung scores) at day 6 revealed substantial lung discoloration in ribavirin-treated mice. The MDD in mice treated with ribavirin was reduced (Table 3) , but the survivor curve was statistically similar to that of PSS controls (Fig. 5 ). In the second experiment, virus titers were lower than controls in ribavirintreated mice on day 6 ( Table 4 ), but 50% of that group also died by 6 d. p.i. (data not shown).",

Strain v2163 was derived from the Urbani strain of SARS-CoV by serial passage in BALB/c mice. Mice infected with the v2163 strain were less likely to survive SARS-CoV infection than Urbani-infected or MA15-infected mice. The MA15 strain appeared less lethal in the current study than shown by Roberts et al. (2007) . However, in the study previously reported, death was based on 20% weight loss. When 20% weight loss was equated to mortality in the current work, the results for MA15 were closely similar to previous reports (Table 1) . Further, the prior finding that an inoculum of 10 3.9 CCID 50 of MA15 per mouse was sublethal (Roberts et al., 2007) was confirmed in the current work. The reduced lethality of strain MA15 in the current experiments may also be attributed to the use of 5-to 6-week-old mice rather than 6-to 8-week-old mice. In the current study, 5-to 6-week-old mice were much less susceptible to MA15 than were 10-to 11-week-old mice (Table 2) . SARS-CoV is known to be more fatal in aged patients than in younger patients (Chen and Subbarao, 2007) . Age-related susceptibility to SARS-CoV in mice has been shown previously with 4-week-old versus 6-monthold mice (Nagata et al., 2008) , with 12-to 14-month-old mice (Roberts et al., 2005) , and between 10-week-old and 1-year-old mice (Rockx et al., 2007) . The lethality of the v2163 virus in younger mice is an advantage for its use as a convenient model for evaluation of potential antiviral treatments.",

Although the v2163 strain was developed independently, its genome shared mutations with the previously created mouse-adapted MA15 strain (Fig. 2) . The spike mutation Y436H was common to both lethal strains, and is within the receptor-binding motif (Roberts et al., 2007) . The Y436H mutation has been shown to enhance infectivity of recombinant viruses in mice (Becker et al., 2008) , presumably by providing a more favorable interaction with the mACE2 receptor for docking and entry. The v2163 strain had three mutations in the S (spike) region that were not present in MA15, suggesting that the increased virulence observed with v2163 potentially may be due to binding properties. Moreover, Y442F is a contact interface residue site that engages the ACE2 receptor, and passage of civet strain SZ16 K479N in human airway epithelial cells selected for a similar change at this position, shown to enhance SZ16 S interaction with the hACE2 receptor . Further, in separate work, a Y442L mutation was seen on a third mouse-adapted strain (MA20) in the same amino acid residue as the Y442F mutation of v2163 (Frieman et al., publication in preparation) . Interestingly, the T1181L and N1169D alterations are in the heptad repeat elements in S2 where they could promote fusion and entry or host range expansion (McRoy and Baric, 2008) .",

The mutation in the M glycoprotein gene (S6L) is near the MA15 E11K mutation that has been associated with increased production of virus particles from infected cells, presumably by promoting more efficient assembly and release, although the exact mechanism is unknown (Pacciarini et al., 2008) . The nsp9 E4185D mutation is located near the nsp9 T4184A mutation of MA15, and likely confers a similar phenotypic difference, presumably increasing virulence. Both lethal strains had an nsp13 mutation, although it is not known if they confer similar changes to the protein structure. The fact that independent selections resulted in similar mutation profiles in target genes supports their role in increased replication and/or pathogenesis. Elucidation of the effects of these specific mutations may be key to understanding the genotypic variations that lead to more lethal phenotypes of SARS-CoV and coronaviruses in general. Such knowledge could allow rapid synthesis of chimeric viruses for use in evaluating and developing effective antiviral treatments.",

IL-6 and MCP-1 were more strongly expressed in v2163-infected mice than in MA15-infected mice. IL-6 and MCP-1 have been observed in human SARS patients (Chen and Subbarao, 2007) , and one human study determined that IL-6, IL-8, and MCP-1 indicated a high risk of death (Jiang et al., 2005) . Therefore, MCP-1 and IL-6 are likely good early indicators of disease outcome in mice. In contrast, cytokines MIP-1\u03b1 and RANTES were more elevated in MA15-infected groups than v2163-infected groups. Since MA15-infected mice had lower mortality than v2163-infected mice, MIP-1\u03b1 and RANTES may not be good indicators of disease outcome. When comparing the mouse cytokine profile to that detected in human SARS patients, the majority of human studies showed the same profile as seen in mice for IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, IFN\u03b3, TNF-\u03b1, IP-10, and MCP-1 Chen and Subbarao, 2007; Hsueh et al., 2004; Zhu, 2004) (Table 6 ). In contrast, IL-1\u03b2 was not elevated in mouse lungs or in human lungs, but with serum three of five studies reviewed showed elevated IL-1\u03b2 in human patients. RANTES was elevated in mouse lungs but not in the human sera. However, uninfected controls had elevated RANTES levels in mice as well, so the response was not considered important. IFN-\u03b3 was detected in lethally infected mouse lungs but not in human lungs. Nevertheless, the IFN-\u03b3 findings were considered consistent with human data since the IFN-\u03b3 level in mice was low, and IFN-\u03b3 has been found in human serum in some studies but not others. The two mouse-adapted SARS-CoV strains in this study both resulted in similar cytokine profiles (Fig. 3) .",

Mice infected with the wild-type Urbani strain showed no signs of disease or death, and they had no IL-6 detected in the lungs, while v2163-infected mice expressed high levels of IL-6. In one replicate study, 100% of v2163-infected mice died, and the average IL-6 level for lung homogenates in that group was 2750 pg/ mL with only one mouse lower than 2700 pg/mL. The corresponding MA15-infected group in the same study had 100% recovery after severe illness, and those mice had an average IL-6 concentration of only 520 pg/mL with no sample higher than 900 pg/mL. Similarly, one clinical study found that patients with the poorest outcomes also had high levels of IL-6 secreting cells . In the current work, infected mice receiving PSS, cremaphor, and EP128533 groups showed higher IL-6 concentrations than the ribavirin, Ampligen\u2122, and UDA groups ( Table 4 ). The lower IL-6 concentration on 3 d.p.i. coincided with treatments that afforded at least some protection against death in the survival study (Table 3 ). The role of IL-6 in SARS-CoV infection merits further investigation. IL-6 is critical in B-cell maturation and acute-phase responses (Kopf et al., 1994) , and it is critical in coordination of immune response (Gowen et al., 2006) . Conversely, a study reported by Hegde, Pahne, and Smola-Hess (2004) suggests that IL-6 also has immunosuppressive properties. However, high expression of IL-6 may exacerbate disease. In SARS patients, damage to the lung seems to be primarily by viral destruction of alveolar and bronchial epithelial cells and macrophages (Chen and Subbarao, 2007) . However, elevated IL-6 levels and concomitant lung damage continued even after peak virus production, which suggests that IL-6 contributes to disease progression . Furthermore, a SARS patient study showed altered liver function, leucopenia, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and subsequent respiratory distress syndrome, suggesting that there was inflammatory damage resulting from SARS-CoV infection (Peiris et al., 2003a) . Studies with other viruses also suggest that excess production of IL-6 may exacerbate disease. For example, a study of herpes simplex virus (HSV) suggested that exuberant production of IL-6 in neonates may explain why sepsis syndrome is more common with HSV infection in neonates than in adults (Kurt- Jones et al., 2005) . A study of phlebovirus infection also proposed that IL-6 contributes to pathogenesis (Gowen et al., 2006) . Regardless of the cause-effect relationship, we found that IL-6 is strongly expressed in the lungs during infection with mouse-adapted SARS-CoV virus and may be an effective predictor of disease outcome.",

            "text": "The histopathology of SARS is difficult to distinguish because most lesions observed with SARS can be found with many infections. The main distinguishing histopathological factors in human SARS disease are consolidation, edema, and hyaline membrane formation (Guo et al., 2008) . Also, inflammatory infiltrates, usually composed of mostly macrophages and lymphocytes, are disproportionately low in number with respect to the alveolar damage, and sometimes absent (Chen and Subbarao, 2007; Cheung et al., 2004; Guo et al., 2008 ). In the current study, lungs infected with mouse-adapted strains of SARS-CoV showed acute to subacute alveolitis with some perivascular edema in some sections. Mice lungs had slight to moderate neutrophil and macrophage infiltration, but lymphocytes were not observed. Erythrocyte infiltration and some fibrinous material were observed with v2163 in some experiments not shown. No hyaline membrane was formed in the mouse lungs. Since lung pathology differed from human disease, and since mice groups that died from infection had similar pathology to that of treated mice that survived infection (Tables 3 and  4 ), we submit that histopathology will not be an important marker in this SARS model. SARS infects multiple tissues in humans, including spleen, intestines, kidneys, liver, adrenal, parathyroid, pituitary, cerebrum, and pancreas and neurons of CNS (Chen and Subbarao, 2007; Guo et al., 2008) . With v2163, infectious virus was consistently found in the lung and snout of v2163 inoculated mice on days 3 and 6 postinoculation, but was only rarely seen in serum. Virus was not recovered from kidney, brain, spleen, intestine, liver, or heart of v2163-infected mice with limits of detection of 2.1 log CCID 50 for kidney; 1.1 log CCID 50 for brain, spleen, and heart; and 4.1 log CCID 50 for liver and intestine (data not shown). With MA15, Roberts et al. (2007) reported low titers of infectious virus found in lung, brain, spleen, and liver of mice infected with MA15.",

We had previously found in a mouse virus lung replication model of SARS-CoV that ribavirin extended the time that virus could be detected in the lungs of mice (Barnard et al., 2006b) , and this was also observed in one trial of the current study (Table 3 ). The prolonged high lung titers observed suggested that ribavirin may contribute to the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV by prolonging and/or enhancing viral replication in the lungs, allowing continual stimulation of the inflammatory response, which may contribute to pathogenesis (Perlman and Dandekar, 2005) . Also, ribavirin is known to be somewhat toxic, causing hemolytic anemia and other adverse side effects (Wong and Yuen, 2008) , so ribavirin would presumably exacerbate disease if there were no concomitant antiviral effect. Interestingly, exacerbation of viral disease by ribavirin has also been shown with West Nile virus, resulting in increased mortality in hamsters and possibly in human patients (Chowers et al., 2001) . In contrast, the second experiment in the current work showed significantly decreased IL-6 concentrations on 3 d.p.i. and somewhat decreased virus titers in ribavirin-treated animals on 6 d.p.i., suggesting some effect of ribavirin in mice (Table 4 ). The IL-6 reduction with ribavirin was interesting in light of previous reports that ribavirin inhibited IL-6 production in respiratory epithelia cells infected with RSV virus (Jiang, Kunimoto, and Patel, 1998) and endothelial cells infected with dengue virus (Huang et al., 2000) . However, IL-6 was not reduced by ribavirin in activated T-cells (Hultgren et al., 1998) , and ribavirin treatment did not reduce SARS-CoV viral load or IL-6 in human SARS patients . Ribavirin has not been shown to be effective against SARS in humans. In 2006, systematic review and comprehensive summary of treatments used for SARS patients found that 26 studies with ribavirin were inconclusive and that four showed possible harm (Stockman, Bellamy, and Garner, 2006) . However, a 2008 review stated that ribavirin treatment combined with protease inhibitors could be useful clinically, although randomized controlled trials were still needed (Wong and Yuen, 2008) . Another study showed synergy with ribavirin in combination with IFN-\u03b2 in vitro (Morgenstern et al., 2005) . Additional research is required to draw more certain conclusions about ribavirin in mice, including age-related studies and drug combination experiments using the lethal v2163 virus as a model.",

Ampligen\u2122 has been shown to be effective in vivo against multiple viruses, including Coxsackie virus (Padalko et al., 2004) , Venezuelan equine encephalitis (VEE) virus (Julander et al., 2008) , punta toro virus (Sidwell et al., 1994) , Modoc virus (Leyssen et al., 2003) , duck hepatitis B virus (Niu et al., 1993) , Banzi virus (Pinto, Morahan, and Brinton, 1988) , herpes simplex type 2 (HSV-2) virus (Pinto, Morahan, and Brinton, 1988) , and Pichinde virus (Smee et al., 1993) . In a virus replication model, Ampligen\u2122 at 10 mg/kg was previously found to afford protection against SARS-CoV replication in the lungs (Barnard et al., 2006a) . SARS-CoV is known to be sensitive to type I interferons, IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 (Cinatl et al., 2003; Stroher et al., 2004) . Normally, in the presence of double-stranded RNA or 5\u2032-triphosphorylated ssRNA such as in viral infection, IFNs are synthesized and secreted by infected cells and stimulate expression of potent antiviral proteins (Sadler and Williams, 2008; Samuel, 2001) . However, IFN pathways are blocked in cells infected with SARS-CoV (Frieman, Heise, and Baric, 2008) , thus making the host more susceptible to infection. We believe that exogenous stimulation of IFN pathways with Ampligen\u2122 overcomes the evasion of virus sensing and signaling pathways. Furthermore, Kuri et al. (2009) suggested that \"priming\" with small amounts of IFN helps the cells themselves restore their normal IFN response to SARS-CoV. In the current study, Ampligen\u2122 appeared not to affect virus replication initially, but led to more rapid decline of virus in the lungs compared with untreated animals by 6 d.p.i. (Table 3 ). The study showed that Ampligen\u2122 protected against death and gross damage to the lungs in the presence of lethal SARS-CoV.",

The reduction of IL-6 in lungs at 3 d.p.i. along with 50% survival of mice in this study provide evidence to support further investigation of UDA treatment regimens as potential antiviral therapies. Zhang et al. (2006) reported the design and synthesis of a SARS-CoV protease inhibitor EP128533, 4-(Z-Val-amido)-6-fluoro-5-oxohexanoic acid dimethylamide, chemical formula C 21 H 30 FN 3 O 5 and molecular weight 423. It was shown to inhibit replication of SARS-CoV strains FFM1 and 6109 in Vero and CaCo 2 cells. In the current study, EP128533 was active in cell culture against the Urbani and v2163 strains of SARS-CoV (Table 5 ), but it was not efficacious in preventing death or reducing the disease signs measured in BALB/c mice (Tables  3 and 4 ). Since EP128533 is relatively insoluble, the lack of activity is likely because it is not bioavailable in the animal. EP128533 in uninfected mice was not toxic, and replicate trials using DMSO as the solvent yielded similar results as with cremaphor (data not shown). Nevertheless, based on in vitro results, this compound may be a foundation for an effective antiviral protease if a prodrug is developed to make it more soluble and bioavailable.",

In vitro data confirmed recent findings by Barnard et al. (2006b Barnard et al. ( , 2008 ) that promazine, an antipsychotic drug, and ribavirin, a nucleoside analog, were not effective against SARS-CoV in vitro. Findings with v2163 supported prior findings that Infergen\u2122 was active in vitro against SARS-CoV Urbani (Kumaki et al., 2008) . Protease inhibitor EP128533 was active in vitro, as shown previously (Zhang et al., 2006) . The current in vitro results showed no marked activity with a calpain inhibitor VI, and slight to moderate activity with calpain inhibitor IV. A previous report showed greater antiviral activity with calpain inhibitor VI than with calpain inhibitor IV (Barnard et al., 2004) , and the differences were attributed to greater cell sensitivity to drug toxicity in the previous work, inoculum variation between studies, and stronger virus replication in mammalian cell culture during the current study. UDA was found to be moderately active with antiviral selectivity (SI = 19-22), as with previous work (Keyaerts et al., 2007) . Therefore, the v2163 strain was shown to be effective for evaluating antiviral compounds in vitro using microscopic cytopathic effect, neutral red assays, and virus yield reduction tests. Using the v2163 strain in various in vitro assays allowed detection of a highly active compound and various inactive compounds. This will facilitate future analysis of antiviral compounds, since they can be screened in vitro with the v2163 strain and tested in vivo with the same strain.",

Infection with v2163 caused signs of disease, a strong immunological response, and lung pathology. The v2163 infection largely simulated human disease, except that hyaline membrane formation was not detected in the lungs, and infectious virus was not found in tissues outside of the respiratory tract, as is characteristic in human infection (Chen and Subbarao, 2007) . Mutations in the virus were consistent with those seen in another mouse-adapted strain, and these may be useful in identifying genotypic markers for lethality. The v2163 strain propagated well in cell culture and was shown to be suitable for in vitro screening of potential antiviral compounds against SARS-CoV. Strain v2163 was used effectively as an in vivo model to evaluate SARS-CoV therapies, showing that Ampligen\u2122 pretreatment was active against lethal SARS-CoV infection, and that UDA may have antiviral effects as well. This new model will facilitate identification of valuable antiviral compounds against SARS-CoV and against future emerging pathogens related to SARS-CoV.",

Groups of mice were administered 100 \u03bcL of the following drugs by the intraperitoneal (i.p.) route: ribavirin at 37.5 mg/kg twice a day 8 h apart for 4 days beginning 4 h prior to exposure to virus; Ampligen\u2122 at 5 mg/kg for four treatments 12-16 h apart beginning 16 h before virus exposure; and physiological saline solution (PSS) as a placebo using the dosing regimen described for ribavirin. In separate studies, 16-to 18-g mice were treated with UDA at 5 mg/kg/day using the treatment regimen described above for ribavirin, and 18-to 20-g mice were treated with 30 mg/kg/day of EP128533 protease suspended in 10% cremaphor administered b.i.d. as above for 5 days beginning at time of infection. Mice for toxicity controls were treated with PSS or cremaphor diluent using the treatment regimens described above but without virus exposure. Mice were observed daily, and group weights were taken periodically throughout the test period. The average weight loss was calculated on 3 d.p.i., and significance between treatments was evaluated by one-way analysis of variance followed by Newman-Keuls multiple comparison test. Compound toxicity in uninfected mice was evaluated in terms of weight change and adverse events, and no drug toxicity was observed in this study.",

Samples size was three per treatment group for histopathology and four or five for IL-6 and virus titer depending on number of survivors remaining. Values in pg/g of lung were converted to pg/mL corresponding with the 1:20 dilution used in the initial untreated mice (Fig. 3) . A low outlier in saline day 3 (655 pg/mL) was included in results but excluded from statistical analysis. IL-6 levels in treated groups were compared to untreated controls by ANOVA with Newman-Keuls pairwise comparisons. Individual tissues were harvested with separate sterile instruments to ensure that each tissue was isolated from the lung during necropsy. Tissues were homogenized and titers were performed as described for lungs above.",

Antiviral activity was measured by inhibition of virus-induced cytopathic effect (CPE) (Sidwell and Huffman, 1971) , neutral red (NR) dye uptake (McManus, 1976) , and also by virus yield reduction assays. Vero-76 (ATCC CRL 1587) cells grown in MEM with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) were seeded into 96-well plates at a concentration of 2 \u00d7 10 4 cells per well and grown overnight at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO 2 . Test compounds were dissolved in DMSO or water, then serially diluted in MEM by half-log dilutions in triplicate wells. Test wells were infected with a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of less than 0.007 CCID 50 per cell, sufficient to cause near complete cytopathic effect (CPE) in 3 days, which was 1.6-2.1 log CCID 50 per well for Urbani, and 1.0-2.4 log CCID 50 per well for v2163. The test medium was MEM with 2% FBS and 50 \u03bcg/mL gentamicin. Toxicity of compounds was assayed in duplicate wells without virus. Plates were incubated as above for 3 days, then each well was read microscopically for CPE. Cells were incubated with 0.011% NR dye for 2 h at 37\u00b0C. Free dye was removed from the wells, then the uptaken dye was eluted with 50% ethanol in Sorensen citrate buffer for N30 min. Absorbance was then measured as described by Finter (1969) , with an Opsys MR microplate reader (Dynex, Chantilly, VA) at 540 and 405 nm. Absorbance values and visual CPE were expressed as percentages of cell controls and untreated virus controls, adjusted for toxicity. The 50% effective concentration (EC 50 ) and 50% inhibitory concentration (cytotoxic, IC 50 ) values were calculated by regression analysis.",

Comparisons not otherwise detailed were performed by the Student's two-tailed t test assuming normal distribution and equal variance, and more sophisticated analyses were performed if differences were observed. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test (KS test) for normal distribution and Bartlett's test for equal variance were performed as applicable. MDD, cytokine values, and gross lung score data were analyzed by Mann-Whitney pairwise comparisons or the Kruskal-Wallis test followed by Dunn's multiple comparison test as applicable. Surviving animals were not included in MDD calculations. Raw survival numbers were compared by the Fisher exact test. Survivor curve analysis (as in Fig. 1 ) was done using the Kaplan-Meier method and a log rank test. When that analysis revealed significant differences among the treatment groups, pairwise comparisons of survivor curves were analyzed by the Gehan-Breslow-Wilcoxon test, and the relative significance was adjusted to a Bonferroni-corrected significance threshold for the number of treatment comparisons made. Differences in percent weight loss were tested by one-way ANOVA with Newman-Keuls multiple comparison test, assuming equal variance and normal distribution. For lung titer data, we performed a KS test for normality, on logtransformed values, then used non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis test with Dunn's multiple comparison test for groups that were not normally distributed, and a one-way ANOVA with Newman-Keuls multiple comparison test for groups that were normally distributed. LD 50 was calculated using Probit analysis (StatPlus: MAC 2009).",
