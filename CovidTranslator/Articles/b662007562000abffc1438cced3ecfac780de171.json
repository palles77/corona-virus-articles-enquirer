In this report, a bacterial expression system was developed for the expression and purification of the full-length PCV 2 capsid (Cap) protein from a codon-optimized cap gene. Replacement of rare arginine codons located at the 5 end of the cap reading frame with codons optimal for E. coli was found to overcome the poor expression of the viral protein in the prokaryotic system. The Cap protein was purified to greater than 95% homogeneity by using a single cation-exchange chromatography at a yield of 10 mg per litre of bacterial culture. Despite the failure of the E. coli-expressed Cap protein to self-assemble into virus-like particles (VLPs), the immunization of mice with recombinant Cap yielded antibodies with the same specificity as those raised against native PCV 2 virions. In addition, the antigenic properties of the purified Cap protein were employed in a subunit-based indirect ELISA to monitor the levels of PCV 2 specific antibodies in piglets originating from a herd which was experiencing PCV 2 infection. These results pave the way for a straightforward large-scale production of the recombinant PCV 2 capsid protein and its use as a diagnostic antigen or a PCV 2 subunit vaccine.",

The capsid protein is a unique structural protein of the viral coat (Nawagitgul et al., 2000) that is formed by 60 protein subunits in an icosahedral T = 1 capsid structure (Crowther et al., 2003) . The N-terminus of the capsid protein is rich in basic amino acid residues and displays a nuclear localization signal (NLS) which is important for capsid assembly (Liu et al., 2001a) . The capsid protein is highly immunogenic and reacts strongly with serum from PCV 2-infected pigs (Mahe et al., 2000; Fenaux et al., 2003) , and thus, it is the preferred antigen in a variety of serological tests (Nawagitgul et al., 2002; Blanchard et al., 2003; Liu et al., 2004; Shang et al., 2008) .",

VLPs represent non-infectious structures which completely lack the DNA or RNA genome of the virus. Therefore, vaccines based on VLPs trigger an immune response to the host immune cells by mimicking native virus morphology (Ludwig and Wagner, 2007) . However, the production of VLPs for vaccination in eukaryotic systems is costly for veterinary applications. On the other hand, heterologous protein expression in E. coli offers an alternative to the production of large amounts of protein. The expression of full-length capsid protein in a standard bacterial expression system, such as E. coli BL21 (DE3), has not been reported. Only certain regions of the Cap protein (Wu et al., 2008) or a fusion protein with maltose-binding protein (Liu et al., 2001b) or truncated variant of Cap lacking the NLS (Zhou et al., 2005; Trundova and Celer, 2007) have been expressed in E. coli.",

The virus stock was prepared from the supernatant of organ homogenate from a pig which fulfilled the diagnostic criteria for PMWS (Sorden, 2000) . Samples of enlarged lymph nodes were pooled and homogenised in a fivefold volume of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.2). Two volumes of chloroform were added to 10 volumes of the homogenate and the mixture was shaken at 20 \u2022 C for 10 min and centrifuged at 3000 \u00d7 g for 15 min. The supernatant was subjected to a cushion of CsCl density gradient (1.3 g/ml) and centrifuged at 60,000 \u00d7 g for 4 h in a Beckman SW 60Ti rotor (Beckman Coul-ter, Fullerton, USA). The purified PCV 2 virions were resuspended in PBS and subsequently used to infect the circovirus-free PK15 cells which were maintained in a D-MEM medium (PAA Laboratories, Pasching, Austria) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (Gibco, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, USA) at 37 \u2022 C with 5% CO 2 . The viral DNA was purified from PK15-infected cells using a DNAzol Genomic DNA Isolation Reagent (Molecular Research Center, Cincinnati, USA) according to manufacturer's instructions. The genomic DNA of PCV 2 isolate was sequenced by ABI Prism 3130XL analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, USA) using BigDye Terminator 3.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, USA). The nucleotide sequence encoding the Cap protein was 99.9% identical with that of ORF2 of PCV 2 strain Fd4 (Genbank accession no. AY321986) (de Boiss\u00e9son et al., 2004) .",

This suggested that the removal of the first 16 codons from the 5 end of the cap gene allowed the production of Cap protein in E. coli. In previous report, the expression of the truncated variant of Cap protein lacking the nuclear localization signal (NLS) has been reported (Zhou et al., 2005; Trundova and Celer, 2007) . The NLS consists of 41 amino acid residues at the N-terminus of Cap and the NLS-defective constructs have been expressed also as fusion proteins with Glutathione S-transferase (Zhou et al., 2005) or maltose-binding protein (Liu et al., 2001b) . Based on these results, the authors concluded that the expression of the capsid protein in E. coli was inhibited by the nucleotide sequence encoding the NLS domain. However, the expression of the truncated Cap protein, which lacks the first 16 amino acids, was achieved which suggested that the production of the full-length capsid protein in E. coli was hindered only by the occurrence of rare arginine codons near the 5 end of the cap gene.",

Ten codons, rare in E. coli, were replaced by the most frequent ones, including six arginine, two proline, and single leucine and threonine codon substitutions. The codon-optimized sequence was introduced into pET28b-cap-His using NcoI and MscI restriction sites to obtain pET28b-O-cap-His (Fig. 1B) .

These approaches were used to design a synthetic cap gene with nucleotide sequence optimized for prokaryotic expression in E. coli (Genbank accession no. EU376523). The synthetic gene with introduced NcoI and XhoI restriction sites was cloned into pET28b vector carrying the C-terminal polyhistidine tag and the expression of this construct was analyzed by SDS-PAGE. However, no protein product was detected in Coomasie-stained gel (data not shown). To force the expression of the capsid protein from the synthetic gene, additional codons encoding the polyhistidine tag were added at the 5 end of the gene. The expression of this construct (pET42b-S-Cap) in E. coli BL21 (DE3) yielded the S-Cap protein with a molecular mass of 28 kDa, which was a slightly higher (+1 kDa) than the O-Cap-His protein due to the presence of the additional polyhistidine tag at the N-terminus of the protein (Fig. 2A) . The levels of the S-Cap protein expression were comparable to those of the O-Cap-His protein which indicated that codon optimization of the entire sequence of the cap gene did not enhance significantly the heterologous expression of the capsid protein in E. coli.",

To enable purification of Cap proteins, denaturating conditions in the presence of 8 M urea were utilised.

However, some apparent differences between the S-Cap protein and the remaining capsid proteins were observed during purification procedures. While the S-Cap protein was recovered in a high purity in the distinct peak eluting at 40 min (Fig. 3B, fraction 17) , both the O-Cap-His and Cap-His proteins were eluted from the column in a shorter time (about 38-39 min).

The VLPs were of similar morphology as the intact PCV 2 virions and appeared to be empty capsids with a less ordered structure (Nawagitgul et al., 2000) . However, the question why the PCV 2 capsid protein does form VLPs in insect cells and not in E. coli remains to be addressed. Sequence analysis of the PCV 2 capsid protein revealed amino acid residues with consensus patterns for potential posttranslational modifications (N-glycosylation, phosphorylation) (Liu et al., 2001b) , which are known to occur in eukaryotic but not in prokaryotic expression systems. Another explanation could be a specific need for chaperones, scaffolding proteins, or ssDNA, which might play important roles in a proper PCV 2 assembly (Ludwig and Wagner, 2007) . A plausible hypothesis is that the N-terminal portion of the PCV 2 capsid protein is enriched with basic amino acids that could bind preferentially to the bacterial genomic DNA, and therefore, prevent a regular arrangement of the capsid subunits into VLPs. This hypothesis would be supported by the observation that the E. coli cells expressing Cap protein produced large amounts of outer membrane vesicles (Fig. 4D ) compared to the non-induced cells or the cells expressing the capsid protein of Mason-Pfizer monkey virus. Indeed, the release of outer membrane vesicles has been attributed to a novel envelope stress response (McBroom and Kuehn, 2006) , which might result from the binding of the Cap protein to genomic DNA.",

Using a chequer-board titration of PCV 2-positive serum (IPMA titre of 5120), optimal antigen concentrations and serum dilutions were selected to be 10 g/ml and 1:100, respectively. When the positive/negative cut-off value was set to 0.2 (see Section 2), all the PCV 2-positive sera tested were 100% specific (data not shown). Cap-ELISA showed a low background, and significant differences between PCV 2-negative and PCV 2-positive pig sera were detected (Fig. 5) . Cap-ELISA did not exhibit any cross-reactivity with pig sera obtained from SPF pigs which were infected experimentally with coronavirus causing a transmissible gastroenteritis (TGE) or a porcine epidemic diarrhoea (PED), respectively. Moreover, no significant differences in specificity and sensitivity of Cap-ELISA were observed between the S-Cap and Cap-His proteins when used as coating antigens, indicating that the N-terminus of the capsid protein is not specifically recognised by antibodies in the PCV 2positive sera (Wu et al., 2008) . This showed that the recombinant full-length Cap protein could be used as coating antigen to develop the indirect Cap-ELISA for specific and sensitive detection of PCV 2 antibodies.",

However, while both the indirect immunofluorescence and IPMA assays are highly demanding and not suitable for large-scale survey of PCV 2 infection, the Cap-His proteins (10 g/ml) was analyzed by a colorimetric reaction at the optical density at 450 nm (OD450nm). OD450nm of 0.2 represents a cut-off value for seropositivity of the samples. TGE-specific and PED-specific pig sera were obtained from SPF pigs which were experimentally infected with the coronavirus causing transmissible gastroenteritis (TGE) and porcine epidemic diarrhoea (PED), respectively. Data represent the means \u00b1 S.D. for the three independent experiments. current ELISA formats are less specific and display antigenic crossreactivity to non-pathogenic PCV 1 (Magar et al., 2000) . Recently, an indirect ELISA based on the recombinant NLS-truncated PCV 2 capsid protein expressed in E. coli has been established by Shang et al. (2008) . Although a direct comparison in the sensitivity and specificity of the full-length (this study) and the NLS-truncated (Shang et al., 2008) proteins as antigens would be interesting, it is very likely that both ELISA formats are comparable in the detection of PCV 2 antibodies. Considering these data, the Cap-ELISA based on the recombinant full-length Cap protein as coating antigen would provide a simple and reliable tool for standard serodiagnosis of PCV 2 infection.",

            "text": "To further analyze the capacity of Cap-ELISA to detect the PCV 2specific antibodies, a limited serological and genomic load survey of PCV 2 infection was monitored in piglets during the first 20 weeks of age. The piglet's antibody response along with total amounts of PCV 2 DNA per 1 ml of serum was determined by Cap-ELISA and quantitative PCR, respectively. As shown in Fig. 6A , the levels of PCV 2-specific antibodies showed an initial drop within the first 12 weeks of age, from then on the levels increased gradually until 20th week. In contrast, the DNA copy numbers of PCV 2 increased gradually during the 1st weeks of age to reach the maximum level in the 12th week, after which they decreased slightly until the 20th week (Fig. 6B) . These results are in good agreement with the time course dynamics of PCV 2 infection in newborn piglets (McKeown et al., 2005) . A dramatic decrease of the PCV 2-specific antibodies in the 12th week of age corresponds to the period in which the passive intake of maternal antibodies from breast milk during the weaning period (weeks 1-8) is discontinued. This results in the onset of PCV 2 infection after the 8th week of age prior to the active production of the intrinsic PCV 2-specific antibodies (weeks 12-20). Taken The final values were expressed as a signal-to-positive (S/P) ratio. S/P value was determined according to the following formula: (OD450nm of sample \u2212 OD450nm of negative control)/(OD450nm of positive control \u2212 OD450nm of negative control). S/P value of 0.3 represents the cut-off signal for seropositivity of the samples. (B) Time course analysis of the PCV2 DNA copy numbers per 1 ml of serum as detected by the quantitative PCR. Total genomic DNA was extracted from 200 l of each serum sample and quantified by the PCR amplification of 100 bp DNA segment within the nucleotide sequence of the PCV 2 cap gene using a TaqMan format. Results of statistical analysis using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) between serum samples obtained at given time intervals from 22 piglets are represented by the box plots. The median value for each dataset is indicated by the black center line. The vertical height of each box indicates the 25-75% data range. The upper and lower bars denote the largest and smallest data values. The marker ( ) denotes the extreme value of the individual serum sample that is >1.5 times the inter-quartile range from the upper and lower quartile. The marker (\u1b79) denotes the extreme value of the individual serum sample that is >3 times the inter-quartile range from the upper quartile. Data represent the means \u00b1 S.D. for the three independent experiments. together, these data confirmed that Cap-ELISA was developed with a high specificity and sensitivity for detection of PCV 2 antibodies in pig sera and could be used for large-scale surveys of PCV 2 infection at low cost.",
