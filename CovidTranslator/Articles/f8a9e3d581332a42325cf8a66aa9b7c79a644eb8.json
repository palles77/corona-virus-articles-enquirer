We describe the clinical course in eight HSCT recipients suffering from hMPV infection. Methods We prospectively included all patients with hMPV-associated LRTI after allogeneic HSCT during a period of 1 year. hMPV was diagnosed by multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). Results Eight patients with hMPV-associated LRTI were identified from 93 BAL samples. Three of the eight patients had co-infections with other pathogens. The median age of the patients was 45 years [interquartile range (IQR) 36.8-53.5], the median time posttransplant was 473 days (IQR 251-1,165), 5/8 patients had chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGvHD), and 6/8 patients received immunosuppression. Chest computed tomography (CT) scanning showed a ground-glass pattern in 7/8 patients. Seven of eight patients required hospitalization due to severe symptoms and hypoxemia. All were treated with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), which was combined with oral ribavirin in six patients. The mortality rate was 12.5 % (1/8).",

We, therefore, recommend bronchoscopy for patients suffering from LRTI and showing a groundglass pattern in the CT scan.

            "text": "Short interval from transplant to infection, intensive immunosuppression, as well as preexisting pulmonary Median 67 % 10 % 20 % 0 % 0/HPF alterations like bronchiolitis obliterans may affect the clinical course of hMPV, as well as other viral infections [8, 21] . Hence, the importance of single or combinations of risk factors needs to be examined in larger studies. The outcome of our patients was favorable, except for one patient who suffered from hMPV infection shortly after transplantation (overall survival 87.5 %). A significantly lower mortality rate was observed in our patients compared to the literature, where mortality rates of up to 50 % are reported. However, most of these patients with a poor outcome suffered from hMPV infection which occurred within the first month posttransplant ( Table 3 ). The lack of reports of infections in the later posttransplant period clearly indicates a potential underreporting or underdiagnosis, as only a few centers perform BAL in patients with lower respiratory symptoms. The remarkable better survival in our patients might be due to early diagnosis and the improved ''net state of immunity''. Most of our patients had persistent immunosuppressive treatment because of cGvHD or-like in patient 6-immunosuppressive treatment has been stopped only a few weeks before infection and had to be restarted later due to the clinical relapse of cGvHD. We, therefore, speculate that cGvHD and immunosuppressive treatment is a risk factor for clinically relevant hMPV infection. We cannot clarify if the treatment with IVIG and ribavirin was responsible for the therapeutic effect and the good outcome due to the lack of a control group. However, case reports and small case series have described favorable outcomes upon treatment with ribavirin and IVIG [11, 22] . IVIG treatment was given in all our cases, but the amount of hMPV-neutralizing antibodies in IVIG formulations remains unclear. Randomized studies on the hMPV treatment are still missing and will be difficult to perform due to the relatively small case number in single centers. Recommended treatment with ribavirin is based on expert opinion [3, 23] , which is supported by data from in vitro cell cultures and mouse models [24] . In our center, we use oral ribavirin in severely immunocompromised patients with hMPV infection. This was well tolerated, except for hemolysis with the need for repetitive RBC transfusions. This needs to be considered as a severe side effect. Hence, a careful analysis of the potential risks and benefits is recommended before making the decision to start ribavirin treatment in selected patients with severe infection. Several other treatment strategies were described in the literature. Patients treated with corticosteroids, aerosolized ribavirin, or oseltamivir did not survive [13, [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] .",
