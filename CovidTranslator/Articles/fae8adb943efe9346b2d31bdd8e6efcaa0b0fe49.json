Isolating PEDV neutralizing antibodies from porcine B cells is critical to elucidate the development of PEDV neutralizing antibodies and the protective mechanism of PEDV infection. Here, we described the isolation of a PEDV-neutralizing antibody from the B cell of a vaccinated pig. The antibody, named PC10, was demonstrated to target the conformational epitope of PEDV spike protein, specifically bind to the infected cells of PEDV genogroup 1 and 2 strains, and potently neutralize PEDV infection. PC10 neutralized PEDV infection through interfering with the viral life stages after cellular attachment instead of blocking the attachment of PEDV to cells. These results suggest that PC10 could be a promising candidate for passive protection and inform PEDV vaccine design because of its specificity and substantial neutralization potency.",

PEDV infection is characterized by vomiting, anorexia, watery diarrhea, dehydration, and weight loss, and causes high morbidity and mortality in suckling piglets less than 2 weeks of age, although it affects pigs of all ages (Madson et al., 2014; Song and Park, 2012) . PEDV was first identified in 1978 in Europe and was designated PEDV CV777 strain (Choudhury et al., 2016) . PEDV has now spread widely to multiple continents and PED is recognized as a global swine disease (Choudhury et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2016a; Chung et al., 2016) . Based on the sequence analysis of the whole PEDV genome, the current PEDV strains are classified into two genogroups, G1 (classical) and G2 (variant) (Wang et al., 2016a; Chung et al., 2016) . The prevalent strains causing the recent pandemic outbreaks in Asia and North America primarily belong to the G2 genogroup, although the G1 genogroup, represented by the prototype classical strain CV777, is still circulating in China and other Asian counties (Wang et al., 2016a; Chung et al., 2016) . Comparisons of the gene sequences of PEDV strains revealed that the greatest variation occurs in the PEDV spike (S) gene (Chung et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2016a) . Although PEDV G1-positive serum has limited cross-neutralizing activity against the G2 isolate (Wang et al., 2016b) , the antibodies generated by the G1 PED vaccine inefficiently conferred complete protection against the pandemic G2 isolates (Wang et al., 2016a) .",

Three spike (S) glycoproteins of PEDV form a clubshaped functional spike trimer on the virion surface and are responsible for the attachment and entry of PEDV to target cells (Liu et al., 2015; Park et al., 2011) . PEDV S protein is the main determinant of viral cellular tropism and contains the targets recognized by most neutralizing antibodies (Liu et al., 2015; Park et al., 2011) . Protection against PEDV infection is primarily mediated through antibodies, especially neutralizing antibodies (Langel et al., 2016; Song et al., 2016; Lee et al., 2015) . Isolating PEDV neutralizing antibodies from memory B cells from PEDV infected or vaccinated pigs can be very useful for understanding the neutralizing antibody development in vivo and could facilitate the design of new subunit vaccines. Furthermore, the isolated whole porcine potent neutralizing antibodies against PEDV could be developed as candidates for passive immunotherapy treatment. Egg yolk IgY antibodies against PEDV S protein provides partial protection against the acute PEDV infection of neonatal piglets (Lee et al., 2015) .",

Paired VH and VL sequences from the sorted single B cells were amplified and sequenced. Once the amplified VH and VL PCR products were confirmed by sequencing, the full-length heavy and light chains were obtained through overlapping PCR with the constant region fragment of porcine IgG1 as described previously (Liao et al., 2013) . The PCR fragments of the full-length heavy and light chains, with a CMV promoter and polyA tail, were co-transfected into 293T cells to generate whole-porcine mAbs. The secretion of the mAb in the cell supernatant was monitored by ELISA and viral inhibition assay. Once the function of the mAb was confirmed, the mAb full-length heavy chain or light chain was separately cloned into the pcDNA3.1 expression vector. The mAb plasmids were co-transfected into 293T cells for the antibody production. The whole-porcine IgG1 was expressed in 293T cells by transient transfection, purified by affinity chromatography using protein A agarose (GeneScript, China), and titrated using a BCA Protein Assay Kit (Thermo Scientific).

The inhibition of PEDV infection by the supernatant secreted PC10 were further confirmed by IFA using an anti-PEDV N protein antibody. As shown in Fig. 1C , incubation with the secreted PC10 IgG evidently reduced the infection of the cells by PEDV G1 CV777. PEDV G2 Lnct2 is a new PEDV field-isolated strain stocked in our laboratory (Li et al., 2017) . PC10 also curtailed the infection of G2 Lnct2 PEDV though less efficiency comparing to CV777 (Fig. 1C) .

To measure the neutralizing activity of PC10, we quantified the PC10 neutralization activity by an ELISA-based F. Fu et al. Veterinary Microbiology 205 (2017) 99-105 neutralization assay. Consistent with the results of the microplate IFA neutralization, 3.125 \u03bcg/ml PC10 almost completely neutralized CV777 infection; the IC50 of PC10 was 0.103 \u03bcg/ml (Fig. 3B) .

We first incubated antibodies with PEDV at 37\u00b0C for 1 h before adding the PEDV-antibody mixture to Vero E6 cells. We measured the cell-associated PEDV following a 2-h infection incubation at 37\u00b0C after washing unbound viruses. Unlike the #241 purified polyclonal IgG, the presence of PC10 did not reduce the cellassociated PEDV, although both PC10 and #241 IgG neutralized PEDV infection (Fig. 5A) , indicating that PC10 neutralization is not mediated through blocking the viral attachment to cells. To further confirm this result, we next added PC10 and PEDV to target Vero E6 cells at separate time points. We added PEDV to Vero E6 cells and incubated them at 4\u00b0C for 1 h, which allowed the virus to attach to Vero E6 cells but prevented PEDV entry into the cells because the fusion of the viral envelope and cellular membrane does not occur at 4\u00b0C. Then, PC10 was added to the PEDV-cell complexes and the temperature was raised to 37\u00b0C immediately to initiate the viral fusion. If PC10 inhibits viral attachment to cells, there would be no reduction in cell-associated PEDV or neutralization under these conditions. The addition of PC10 following PEDV attachment to cells did not reduce the cell-associated PEDV. Consistent with the results that PC10 did not block the PEDV attachment to cells, PC10 still almost completely neutralized PEDV infection when PC10 was only present in the 2-h infection incubation at 37\u00b0C after PEDV had attaching to cells, just as the neutralization observed when PC10 and PEDV were pre-incubated at 37\u00b0C for 1 h (Fig. 5B) before infection absorbance. These results indicate that PC10 does not block PEDV from attaching to E6 cells and potentially act on the PEDV entry steps following the viral attachment to cells.",

This indicates the epitope targeting by PC10 is conserved between G1 CV777 and G2 Lnct2. Sites like the epitope recognized by PC10 that induce potent neutralizing activity should be the focus of future rational PEDV vaccine design. The PEDV S is the target of neutralizing antibodies (Lin et al., 2016; Liu et al., 2015) . We found that PC10 only bound to the cellular expressed native S protein of PEDV infected or pcDNA3.1-S transfected cells not the denatured S protein in western blot (Fig. 2) . These indicate that PC10 specifically recognize native PEDV S protein via a conformationdependent epitope. Furthermore, binding of PC10 to PEDV S protein displayed on the surfaces of infected cells could potentially result in the clearance of PEDV infected cells in vivo by antibody-dependent cellmediated cytotoxicity (ADCC). These multiple protective mechanisms exhibited by PC10 presumably make PC10 to a promising therapeutic antibody against PEDV infection in neonatal piglets.",

            "text": "Neutralization of coronaviruses by antibodies is generally attributed to antibody occupancy of the spike trimers and interference with viral attachment to target cells or entry. Here, we found PC10 efficiently bound PEDV in solution, which is consistent with the potent neutralizing activity of PC10 because the capture of infectious virions is a prerequirement of many antiviral activities of antibodies (Liu et al., 2014) . But the binding of PC10 to spike proteins did not interfere with the viral attachment to the target cells (Fig. 5A ). This conclusion was drawn from the observation that PC10 did not reduce the cell-associated PEDV after a 1-h pre-incubation of PEDV and PC10 at 37\u00b0C and that PC10 still neutralized PEDV infection even after PEDV had attached to the target cells (Fig. 5) . It was previously reported that PEDV enters Vero cells through an initial endocytic uptake, followed by the viral fusion between the PEDV S and host endosomal membrane (Park et al., 2014; Liu et al., 2016) . This is consistent with the results that the cellassociated PEDV was significantly higher at 37\u00b0C than 4\u00b0C regardless of the presence of PC10, PEDV-negative IgG, or DMEM alone, indicating that PEDV is taken up by cells through endocytosis more efficiently at 37\u00b0C than at 4\u00b0C. The virus uptake through endocytosis more Fig. 4 . PC10 captured infectious PEDV. The same amount of PEDV was added to a coated plate with 10 \u03bcg/ml antibodies. The captured infectious PEDV was measured by the infection of Vero E6 cells and quantified by PEDV RNA RT-qPCR at 48 hpi. The results are presented as the mean \u00b1 SEM (n = 3). **P < 0.01 by unpaired t-test. efficiently at 37\u00b0C than at 4\u00b0C is observed in Herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV1) infection (Sayers and Elliott, 2016) . In conclusion, PC10 isolated from porcine B cells recognizes the native PEDV S protein and robustly neutralizes PEDV G1 and G2 strains. These results provide insight about the natural induction of the PEDV neutralizing antibodies following PEDV vaccination in pigs and may contribute to PEDV vaccine design.",
