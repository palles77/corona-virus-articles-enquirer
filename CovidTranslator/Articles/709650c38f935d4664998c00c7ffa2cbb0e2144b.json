The hemagglutinin thus adsorbed could be eluted from the erythrocytes by incubating in phosphate buffered saline at 37 \u00b0C. The receptor on chicken erythrocytes for the hemagglutinin was inactivated by neuraminidase and potassium periodate, but not by trypsin, 2-mercaptoethanol and formalin. The hemagglutinin was inactivated by trypsin, papain, pepsin, a-amylase, phospholipase C, neuraminidase, formalin, 2-mercaptoethanol, potassium periodate, ethylether, chloroform, Tween-80 and ~-propiolactone, but not by sodium deoxycholate and trichlorotrifluoroethane, suggesting that the active component of the hemagglutinin involved glycoproteins. The hemagglutinin was stable at 37 \u00b0C or lower temperatures but not at 60 \u00b0C or higher temperatures. The hemagglutinin activity was resistant to ultraviolet irradiation, while the infectivity was very susceptible. The hemagglutinin and the infectivity were readily sedimented by ultracentrifugation at 45,000 x g for 60 minutes. In rate zonal centrifugation of the hemagglutinin preparation on a sucrose density gradient, the hemagglutinin activity showed a sharp peak at 1.19 g/ml coinciding with the peak of infectivity. The activity in the peak fraction seemed to be structually associated with virus particles.",

The fact that the receptor was destroyed by neuraminidase, together with the results of elution of hte hemagglutinin from erythrocytes, suggests the presence of a neuraminidase-like enzyme in the hemagglutinin of both TGE virus as well as IBV [2] , although no neuraminidase activity was detectable. On the other hand, the elution of the hemagglutinin of HCV and MECV is not neuraminidase mediated as erythrocyte receptors are not lost and neuraminidase assays have remained negative [11, 19, 27] . Sentsui and his associates reported that neuraminidase rendered horse, cat, and guinea pig erythrocytes more susceptible to agglutination by equine infectious anemia virus [22] and mouse erythrocytes more susceptible to agglutination by bovine leukemia virus [23] . Further orthomyxoviruses are well known to elute from erythrocytes at 37 \u00b0C by neuraminidase activity possessed by the virus particle [6, 10] . The TGE viius used in this study did not show any cross reaction with the swine influenza virus A (Wisconsin strain), HEV, BCV, and porcine parvovirus by hemagglutination inhibition and neutralization tests in our laboratory (data not shown).",

Second, both infectivity and HA activity had a buoyant density of 1.19 g/ml in a linea sucrose gradient. A virion density of 1.19 g/ml is in agreement with the previous results obtained with Minnesota and Illinois strains of TGE virus [26] . Several coronaviruses, HCV, HEV, BCV, MECV, and IBV, have been demonstrated to possess a virion associated hemagglutinin [3, 7, 12, 20, 24, 27] . Mengeling et al. [16] observed by electron microscopy that when HEV attached to chicken erythrocytes, the main body of the virus was located 10 to 15 nm from the erythrocyte membrane suggesting that the hemagglutinin was associated with the virus surface projections. Likewise HA with IBV has been confined to the strains which have projections, and treatment of HCV, HEV, MECV, and IBV with bromelain removes the hemagglutinating activity together with the projection [2, 3, 8, 20, 27] . Moreover, subunits removed from HEV virions by detergent treatment probably represent surface projections and also exhibit hemagglutinating activity [20] . In HCV, it has been suggested that the hemagglutinating activity is carried by one or both the glycopeptides of the projections [8] , and the glycopeptide of TGE virus has been demonstrated as the major structural component of the projection [5] .",
