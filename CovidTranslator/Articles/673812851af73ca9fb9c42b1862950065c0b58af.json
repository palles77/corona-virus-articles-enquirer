In the absence of an animal model of the disease, it is going to be extremely difficult to actually prove that any agent isolated from brain or other tissue in patients with multiple sclerosis is the causative agent.

That experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE) may indeed be such a model appears to have received considerable support from the work of Wisniewsky and Keith,49 who reported having produced a spontaneously remitting and recurrent disease in guinea pigs with histologic lesions which are quite reminiscent of multiple sclerosis. The presence of bizarre, multinucleated glial cells, however, should raise the possibility of a relationship with another demyelinizing condition, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy. Furthermore, recurrent episodes of the human equivalent of experimental allergic encephalomyelitis, disseminated vasculomyelinopathy, though rare, are not unknown. 37 At the present time, in spite of much evidence to the contrary,35 the experimental allergic encephalomyelitis model is still being pursued with enthusiasm and vigore Whitaker 47 made an important contribution to the study of this problem when he examined the distribution of myelin basic protein in central nervous system lesions of both multiple sclerosis and experimental allergic encephalomyelitis. Marked diminution of reactivity with anti-myelin basic protein occurred in early lesions of multiple sclerosis and extended far beyond MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS 731 accuracy in diagnosis. Unfortunately, they did not perform similar tests on the siblings of their patients with multiple sclerosis.

In the absence of an animal model of the disease, it is going to be extremely difficult to actually prove that any agent isolated from brain or other tissue in patients with multiple sclerosis is the causative agent. Immunologic studies to date have yet not established if multiple sclerosis is the result of a hyperimmune state or a cellular immunodeficiency although the latter possibility, when coupled with the fragmentary genetic data, appears to be more promising.",

That experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE) may indeed be such a model appears to have received considerable support from the work of Wisniewsky and Keith,49 who reported having produced a spontaneously remitting and recurrent disease in guinea pigs with histologic lesions which are quite reminiscent of multiple sclerosis. The presence of bizarre, multinucleated glial cells, however, should raise the possibility of a relationship with another demyelinizing condition, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy. Furthermore, recurrent episodes of the human equivalent of experimental allergic encephalomyelitis, disseminated vasculomyelinopathy, though rare, are not unknown. 37 At the present time, in spite of much evidence to the contrary,35 the experimental allergic encephalomyelitis model is still being pursued with enthusiasm and vigor. Whitaker4 7 made an important contribution to the study of this problem when he examined the distribution of myelin basic protein in central nervous system lesions of both multiple sclerosis and experimental allergic encephalomyelitis. Marked diminution of reactivity with anti-myelin basic protein occurred in early lesions of multiple sclerosis and extended far beyond any identifiable inflammatory elements; in both parenchymal and perivascular areas, lipid laden macrophages in plaques of multiple sclerosis frequently contained myelin basic protein. In experimental allergic encephalomyelitis, however, myelin basic protein was relatively well preserved in the brains of guinea pigs. Normal appearing patterns of myelin basic protein existed adjacent to the perivascular cellular infiltrates and macrophages containing myelin basic protein were rare. Whatever mechanism or mechanisms in multiple sclerosis promote loss of myelin basic protein, the loss is marked once the process is initiated. Reactivity of anti-myelin basic protein with normal white matter in brain tissue from patients with multiple sclerosis could not be distinguished from that of normal brain.",

            "text": "The classical clinical notion that the course of multiple sclerosis characterized by remissions and exacerbations closely reflects the underlying pathological changes needs closer examination. While it has usually been assumed that new plaques have developed in the patient who suddenly experiences symptoms, physiological, radiological, and pathological studies reveal that asymptomatic lesions may have been present for quite some time. Symptoms and signs of multiple sclerosis may indeed result from the formation of plaques, but it is now clearly understood that they may also result from physiologic alterations (e.g., heat, calcium concentration) affecting previously existing plaques. 35 In addition, other mechanisms must be considered: since symptoms and signs may be the result of swelling rather than destruction of myelin, it is conceivable that when the edema subsides, the myelin does not revert to its normal state, and thus may be more vulnerable to these physiological alterations. Recurrence of edema in the same location is still another possibility, as is enlargement of a previously existing plaque. The occurrence of a new lesion at another level of one of the long tracts may also mimic a previously experienced symptom. Furthermore, while the exact pathogenetic relationship between emotional stress and physical trauma is poorly understood, the association of these events with acute exacerbations or appearance of new symptoms is well documented. It is not farfetched to suggest that some still not understood physiological~lteration affects conductivity in a manner similar to changes in temperature or calcium concentration: the phenomenon of such psychologically induced recall needs further study. Thygesen 46 in his review of 105 attacks of the disease in 60 patients pointed out that a new symptom suggestive of a new plaque occurred in only 19 per cent of these attacks.

            "text": "The classical clinical notion that the course of multiple sclerosis characterized by remissions and exacerbations closely reflects the underlying pathological changes needs closer examination. While it has usually been assumed that new plaques have developed in the patient who suddenly experiences symptoms, physiological, radiological, and pathological studies reveal that asymptomatic lesions may have been present for quite some time. Symptoms and signs of multiple sclerosis may indeed result from the formation of plaques, but it is now clearly understood that they may also result from physiologic alterations (e.g., heat, calcium concentration) affecting previously existing plaques. 35 In addition, other mechanisms must be considered: since symptoms and signs may be the result of swelling rather than destruction of myelin, it is conceivable that when the edema subsides, the myelin does not revert to its normal state, and thus may be more vulnerable to these physiological alterations. Recurrence of edema in the same location is still another possibility, as is enlargement of a previously existing plaque. The occurrence of a new lesion at another level of one of the long tracts may also mimic a previously experienced symptom. Furthermore, while the exact pathogenetic relationship between emotional stress and physical trauma is poorly understood, the association of these events with acute exacerbations or appearance of new symptoms is well documented. It is not farfetched to suggest that some still not understood physiological alteration affects conductivity in a manner similar to changes in temperature or calcium concentration: the phenomenon of such psychologically induced recall needs further study. Thygesen 46 in his review of 105 attacks of the disease in 60 patients pointed out that a new symptom suggestive of a new plaque occurred in only 19 per cent of these attacks. An attack often affects precisely one previously damaged site of the central nervous system and is a true copy of previously remitted symptoms. It would seem that clinical exacerbations can with equal probability represent either physiologic alterations or evidence of the production of new plaques, or expansion or reactivation of old ones. Many patients with multiple sclerosis have admitted, upon close questioning, that certain symptoms never actually disappear, but they get accustomed to them so that they are ignored until some external event brings them to mind. 36 In other words, this suggests that clinical observation provides only a very incomplete and inaccurate reflection of the progression of the disease in terms of formation of new plaques. Clinical evaluation of degree of activity of the underlying demyelinizing process is totally in-adequate and particularly burdensome when trying to evaluate the results of therapeutic regimens. Measurements of evoked responses and to a lesser extent radionuclide and contrast-enhanced eT studies will prove to be of considerable help in this regard.",
