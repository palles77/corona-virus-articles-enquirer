Future efforts remain in targeting the sustainability of improved outcomes beyond 6 months. Risk factors identified can help target vulnerable populations for proper interventions, which may include efforts to maximize insurance coverage for asthma medications and strategies to improve asthma self-management through patient and provider education. A sthma is the most common chronic disease in children. In Canada, according to the National Longitudinal Survey of Children and Youth, the prevalence of asthma in children under 12 years old was 11.2%. 1 To and colleagues, 2 using the health administrative databases in Ontario, reported a prevalence of 19.6% in children aged under 10 years.",

            "text": "Children with asthma suffer from significant morbidity, including visits to emergency departments (EDs), urgent care clinics, and hospitalizations. In a recent populationbased study, Guttmann and colleagues 3 found that over 9% of children with asthma in Ontario, Canada had at least 1 ED visit for asthma over a 2-year period and that asthma accounted for 3% of all pediatric ED visits. Factors predictive of such adverse asthma events (such as acute asthma episodes and ED visits) may help identify high-risk patients to be targeted for interventions to improve outcomes, especially in those who already have experienced adverse events. A number of prospective studies have examined outcomes in children after visiting the ED for asthma. [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] Predictors of repeat acute care visits identified at the patient level included female gender, young age, previous hospitalization or ED visit for asthma, increased number of acute asthma episodes or use of oral corticosteroid in the past year, having planned visits to the primary care provider in past 6 months, acuity of index visit, suboptimal treatment during ED stay or hospital admission at the index visit, maternal smoking, and exposure to cigarette smoke. However, most of these studies were limited to shortterm follow-up (<8 weeks) [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] 10 and provide little information on outcomes beyond. 9 To improve patient outcomes after receiving acute care for asthma, the Canadian Asthma Consensus Guidelines [11] [12] [13] recommend that inhaled corticosteroids be prescribed to almost all children at discharge from ED. Observational studies showed that inhaled corticosteroid therapy was associated with a significant decrease in the risk of repeat ED visits for asthma in both the short-term and long-term. 8, 14 Nevertheless, despite widespread availability, inhaled corticosteroids are underutilized in children with asthma in Canada. [14] [15] [16] This situation may stem in part from inadequate drug insurance coverage and cost sharing, which is known to influence access to and use of inhaled corticosteroids in children with asthma, [17] [18] [19] especially in provinces (such as Ontario) without universal insurance for medications. Given these observations, it is logical to conclude that insurance coverage for asthma medications has an important role in determining patient outcomes in children who have visited the ED for acute care for asthma. However, to date, no study has examined this association directly.",

In the current study, the incidence of repeat ED visits was 6.1% and 26.8% at 1 and 6 months, respectively. Though still concerning, the rates were lower than those reported by most others. Possible explanations for this difference may lie in the asthma education given to children/ family in the ED and the emphasis of the use of inhaled corticosteroids after ED discharge. Our data showed that inhaled corticosteroids were used to some extentalthough it may not be consistent with guideline recommendations-in about three fourths of our study population over the study period.

Therefore, improving the affordability and accessibility of asthma medications-maybe through public health policies and interventions-should be considered a priority target for future efforts to improve outcomes in children with asthma. Besides drug insurance coverage, we also identified other potentially modifiable factors associated with repeat ED visits that could be used to target interventions to achieve good asthma control. Similar to previous studies, we found that environment control measures (eg, washing bed linens in hot water weekly) were associated with a significantly lower risk of subsequent acute asthma episodes. Current guidelines endorsed reducing exposure to allergens in asthma patients as the tertiary prevention strategy for asthma. [11] [12] [13] Some researchers recommended that clinicians provide education regarding effective environmental measures for all families with potentially modifiable asthma triggers, 24 although the optimal location, content, and duration of the delivery of such asthma education remain an ongoing debate. 25 Although some have advocated that education for asthma patients should be initiated in the ED, many barriers exist that make it difficult to implement. These include the allocation of adequate staff time for patient education, adjustment of content to meet individual patients' needs, and the assessment of learners' comprehension. 26 Our study suggested that providing patient education in the ED may contribute to improved long-term outcomes in children with asthma. Further studies that assess the cost-effectiveness of allocating an asthma educator in the ED would be informative to guide future policy changes and resource allocation.",

            "text": "Thirdly, the current study focused on objective health outcomes (eg, repeat ED visits) and individual asthma symptoms rather than composite functional outcome or health status measures. The latter could be of interest if the quality of care that children with asthma receive is of concern, or if one is interested in measuring the performance of the health care system in caring for children with special needs. 29 However, limitations of existing health status measures have long been noted, 30 and new measures (eg, the Children's Health Survey for Asthma) are still being tested to be used in longitudinal analysis. 29 Future studies on outcomes in children with asthma should include composite health status measures whenever possible. Finally, our study cohort was a nonrandom sample that attended the ED of a tertiary children's hospital. Therefore, our findings may not be generalizable to children with mild or moderate asthma who are primarily managed in community settings. However, since those attending the ED of a tertiary hospital may represent difficult asthma or poor controlled asthma, our results hold clinical relevance to practitioners who are providing continuous care to these children after they are discharged into the community.",

Future efforts remain in targeting the sustainability of improved outcomes beyond 6 months. Risk factors identified in this study can help target vulnerable-children populations (such as those with previous adverse events or without drug insurance coverage) for proper interventions to reduce adverse outcomes, especially acute asthma episodes and the need for acute health care use. Such interventions may include efforts to maximize insurance coverage for asthma medications, as well as strategies to improve asthma self-management, likely through patient and provider education.",
