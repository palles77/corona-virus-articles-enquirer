            "text": "The contributions of Levitt (2001) and Cantor and Land (2001) have prompted an active and interesting debate on effective intervention time series analysis. These discussions have become more prominent given the increasing interest in the effects of policy changes by governments promoting different crime-prevention programs. Different approaches to intervention time series analysis have been adopted in the evaluation of programs and policies in a number of criminal justice settings (McCleary and Hay,1980; McDowall et al.,1980; Orwin,1997) . The standard approach to time series analysis in this framework aims at discriminating between the behaviour of the time series prior to the intervention and after the intervention. In other words, \"given a known intervention, is there evidence that change in the series of the kind expected actually occurred, and, if so, what can be said of the nature and magnitude of the change,\" (Box and Tiao, 1975) . From the effective crime policy perspective it is important to assess whether a known intervention (policy change) has had the intended effect. For example, it is important to know whether an increased reliance on prisons, an increased number of police, tougher gun control laws, and innovative criminal justice programs and policies reduce crime rates and deter potential criminals from committing crimes.",

The crime rate series examined are monthly data on burglary, larceny, motor vehicle theft, robbery, aggravated assault, murder, and rape. The Commonwealth of Virginia abolished parole and reformed sentencing for all felony offences committed on or after January 1, 1995. This law was passed in a special legislative session in the autumn of 1994. Parole abolition was accompanied with substantially enhanced sentences for violent offenders. 1 Visual inspection of the crime time series analysed in this paper (Figs. 1 and 2) shows that most of them are declining from about the same time that Virginia enacted these major legislative initiatives to reduce violent crime. However, research to date is unable to determine if these reductions in crime rates are due to specific anti-crime initiatives. 2 Reductions have occurred in the types of crimes that were targeted by these initiatives, indicating that they may have had their intended effect.",

First, we adopt a univariate structural time series approach to the intervention analysis of time series data, which are serially correlated, often non-stationary, and with strong seasonal and/or cyclical effects. Second, in order to address the problem of confounding variables, we apply the approach of Harvey (1996) and estimate multivariate structural time series models with control groups. Finally, the robustness of our results is investigated with an automatic detection of breaks procedure, as well as with analyses of quarterly rather than monthly data, thus showing that our results are independent of a particular time series method applied or the data frequency used.",

            "text": "The contribution of our paper to the existing literature is threefold. Policy changes that increase the expected punishment per crime can lead to both greater deterrence and greater incapacitation. The empirical evidence which links increased punishment with lower crime rates is consistent. 3 According to Levitt and Dubner (2005) , increases in the prison population account for roughly one-third of the drop in crime in the US. However, most empirical tests on deterrence do not differentiate between the effect of deterrence and of incapacitation. Short-run declines in crime are likely to be attributable to deterrence, whereas the incapacitation effect of sentence enhancements will occur only in the long-run (Kessler and Levitt, 1999) . In the case of Virginia, the 1994 legislation abolishing parole and establishing a truth-in-sentencing system was a single, most significant factor affecting the size of the prison population. Although it took time for the longer prison sentences imposed under the 1994 sentencing reform to have a significant growth effect on Virginia's prison population, decrease in the parole grant rate had an almost immediate effect on the size of the prison population. 4 By looking at changes in crime immediately after the introduction of a sentence reform in Virginia, we hope to isolate a pure deterrent effect of the new legislation that is not contaminated by the effect of incapacitation. Hence, to the extent that severity of punishment serves as a deterrent to committing crimes in the short run, we would expect the reported crimes to drop especially for the violent offences. Disentangling deterrence and incapacitation effects of the introduced sentence reform in Virginia is the first contribution of our paper.",

            "text": "Our sample includes the 1990 to 1999 period when considerable social and economic changes occurred in the United States. There were declines in crime trends throughout the US during this decade. Furthermore, the second half of the 1990s was an economically prosperous period for the US. For example, unemployment rates declined sharply through most of this period. It was also a period in which a number of innovative criminal justice programs and policies were enacted both at the state level and at the local communities level. Favourable changes in patterns of drug use and access to guns were put in place. These factors could serve as alternative explanations for the decline in crime throughout the US in general, and Virginia in particular. Disentangling the impact of parole abolition on crime rates in Virginia from these other factors poses a considerable methodological challenge. We endeavour to tackle this problem of confounding variables by applying the approach of Harvey (1996) and estimating multivariate structural time series 3 See for example Ehrlich (1973) , Grogger (1991) , Kessler and Levitt (1999) , Levitt (1997) , and Moody (1994,1996) . 4 For example, between 1990 and 1993, Virginia's annual parole grant rate averaged about 41% (i.e., about four out of ten prisoners eligible for parole were granted parole). The parole grant rate began to decline in 1993, and by the end of 1994 it dropped to about 14%. After the parole system was abolished in 1994, the grant rate remained below 20% (Crime in the Commonwealth, 1988 Commonwealth, -1998 . Further, sentencing reform applied to virtually all felony convictions, while repeated violent offenders had to spend from two to more than five times longer in prison than under the parole system. models with control groups. Understanding better the statistical relationship between Virginia anti-crime efforts and crime reductions over time in the presence of confounding variables is the second contribution of our paper.",

A key element of the campaign was to reduce the disparity between the sentence imposed in court and the actual time-served. This reform abolished parole, established a guidelines-based truth-in-sentencing 5 Existing literature on crime macroeconomics often applies univariate error correction models (ECM), vector autoregression (VAR) and vector error correction (VECM) models. Some of the time series references using the UK data are Pyle and Deadman (1994) , Dhiri et al. (1999) , Hale and Sabbagh (1991) . Examples of papers using the U.S. data are Greenberg (2001 ), O'Brien (1999 , Corman et al. (1987) , Cappell and Sykes (1991) , Witt and Dryden Witte (1998) , Saridakis (2004) , and Nunley et al. (2011a) . For Switzerland, examples of papers which analyse crime rates using a time series approach are papers by Funk and Kugler (2003a) and Funk and Kugler (2003b) . Interesting and recent empirical time series research on crime rates for Japan is carried out by Halicioglu et al. (2012) and for China by Cheng and Smyth (2015) . Estimation results in most of these papers are based on the cointegration modelling approach, which assumes a stable long-run relationship between crime and underlying explanatory variables. An exception is a paper by Cappell and Sykes (1991) , who base their results on the autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) time series approach to modelling crime. system, and increased sentence length for violent offenders on or after January 1, 1995. The net result of the implementation of the legislation was a substantial increase in the sentences for the violent offences (especially rape and murder) and also for offenders with a violent past. 6 We have obtained a data set of monthly time series on burglary, larceny, motor vehicle theft, robbery, aggravated assault, murder, and rape from the Uniform Crime Reports (UCR) collected by the Virginia State Police in the period from January 1984 up to, and including, December 2010. The UCR includes a data summary with counts of aggregated offences known to police and arrests. The preintervention period corresponds to the period from January 1984 to December 1994. The post-intervention period corresponds to the period from January 1995 to December 2010. 7 Figs. 1 and 2 present the reported crimes rates per 100,000 population, for property and violent crimes, respectively, from January 1984 to December 2010. 8 It is clear from these graphs that the crime series are all trending and contain strong seasonal patterns. As explained in Section 3 we therefore explicitly incorporate trends and seasonal components in all our analyses.",

A single special event, a change in the mean or a change in the growth, at some time index t, can be treated by means of an intervention variable. In our analysis below we consider three types of intervention effects which are presented graphically in Fig. 3 . The first graph illustrates a pulse intervention which is used to capture a single special event at some time period 1< t< n such as a special holiday or a strike. Such events may cause outlying observations within the time series; the pulse intervention variable, denoted by I t (t), can isolate such observations from the model. The second graph in Fig. 3 presents a step intervention that enables to break up the time series into two distinct segments with two different overall means, one for the pre-intervention period t = 1, . . . , t \u2212 1 and one for the post-intervention period t = t, . . . , n for some 1 < t < n. The step intervention, denoted by B t (t), is introduced in the model to capture events such as the introduction of new policy measures or changes in regulations. However, a policy change may not be felt instantaneously, but can also have a gradual effect; its full impact is only reached after some time. We do not want to rule out such interventions and therefore also consider the smooth break intervention as presented in the third graph of Fig. 3 . The smooth break intervention, denoted by S t (t 1 , t 2 ), starts to take effect from time point t 1 onwards but it only reaches its full impact after a time period of length t 2 \u2212 t 1 , with 1 < t 1 < t 2 < n. In case we have t 2 = n, the smooth break intervention reduces to a so-called growth or slope intervention. We collect the various intervention variables for a pre-defined set of time events in the vector w t (P), where P is given and represents all selected values for t, t 1 and t 2 . We notice that for each selected intervention type, a range of different values of t can be selected. We typically only consider values of t that represent potential events. Hence the vectors P and w t (P) are treated as known and given. The selection of P and the construction of w t (P) are part of the task of the econometrician. The time series model with intervention effects is then given by",

We therefore also consider bivariate structural time series models with a treatment and a control time series as in Harvey (1996) . In this multivariate approach the model is designed to simultaneously analyse a series representing an eligible crime, that is, a crime that is expected to be affected by the intervention, together with a series representing a non-eligible crime, that is, a crime which is not expected to be affected by the intervention. The former series is often referred to as the treatment series, while the latter series can be referred to as the control or reference series.

We have confirmed in our study that a structural time series analysis can indeed be effective in capturing non-stationary features such as trends and seasonal effects simultaneously in a unified manner. In addition, we have shown that an effective intervention analysis can also be accomplished in a multivariate structural For the purpose of intervention analysis, many approaches have been developed on the basis of time series methodologies that are different from structural time series analysis. An early reference is Box and Tiao (1975) where a thorough approach is developed for intervention analysis in the context of stationary ARMA modelling. The more recent developments in detecting and testing for breaks in time series (in mean, regression coefficients, variance) have been initiated by Andrews (1993) and Zivot and Andrews (1992) . The key developments for identifying multiple structural breaks have been initiated by Perron (2003,1998) and Caporale and Grier (2005a) for non-trending data, and Lumsdaine and Papell (1997) , Lee and Strazicich (2003) , and Narayan and Popp (2013) for trending data. 11 These different econometric approaches for the detection of structural breaks have been adopted and illustrated in various empirical studies. For example, Nelson (2000) adopts the Box-Tiao intervention analysis methodology to establish the impact of the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1978. Miguel and Kremer (2008) assess whether two events, the 9-21 Earthquake in 1999 and the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome outbreak in 2003, had a temporary or long-term impact on the inbound tourism demand from Japan. Harvey and Fernandes (1989) and Atkinson et al. (1997) examine the number of outliers and breaks in a monthly time series of number of purse (handbag) snatches in Hyde Park in Chicago. The latter analyses are based on structural time series models. Caporale and Grier (2005a) verify the influence of political dummy variables while controlling for different inflation regimes, using the Bai-Perron methodology. Similarly interesting studies that assess the impact of breaks due to political and associated social and economic events are presented in Caporale and Grier (2005b) , concerned with detecting breaks in real interest rates, Smyth and Narayan (2006) , estimating both the number and location of structural breaks in concurring and dissenting opinions on the U.S. Supreme Court, and Chen and Wang (2014) , investigating the impact of political events on monetary policy.",

It is also possible within a structural time series analysis to develop a statistical procedure for determining the number of interventions and the locations of these. Hence we do not need to set a-priori the dates of the interventions but 11 We have carried out four different unit root tests: a standard augmented Dickey-Fuller(ADF) unit root test, plus three tests which allow for structural breaks (those of Zivot and Andrews (1992) , Lumsdaine and Papell (1997) , and Lee and Strazicich (2003) ). All four tests consistently point to the rejection of the null hypothesis of a unit root; the results are available upon request. Hence stochastic trends are not present in our time series. These results are consistent with the presented results from our structural time series analysis; the estimated variances of the level components are equal to relatively small values which imply that the level components are close to a constant and do not behave as stochastic trends. they can be treated as unknown. Such a procedure is implemented in the STAMP package of Koopman et al. (2010) . It is based on a first analysis where a sequential inclusion of outlier and level break dummies in the model, over each time point t, is considered and the dummy parameters are estimated. All significant dummies (or those close to significance) are recorded. In a second analysis, all recorded dummies are included in the model and all parameters are estimated simultaneously. Then a general-to-specific estimation and testing methodology is adopted to determine the final model specification. In the structural time series analysis adopted in STAMP, each estimation round is based on a model where the trend and seasonal unobserved components are included such that it always accounts for the possible non-stationary dynamic features in the time series. The methodology is different from cointegration and Perron (1998,2003) analyses. In STAMP, the computations rely on the Kalman filter and the analytical methods developed by Harvey and Koopman (1992) .",

We present these additional results for the key time series of burglary 12 and adopt the univariate structural time series model from Table 1. In the first step, we introduce outlier and level break interventions at each consecutive time point and record the resulting t-statistic for the related dummy variables. In Fig. 8 we present the t-statistics for the level break interventions in a time series index plot. We find that significant level breaks are detected in the series while the break for the reformed sentencing change from 1995 is not outstanding. In the next step we consider the univariate model that includes all significant outlier and level breaks from the first step (the level break intervention variables are for March 1984 , November 1987 , and October 1990 plus our parole policy intervention for January 1995. The resulting t-statistic for the policy change has now risen from \u22121.95 in Table 1 to \u22122.51 for this extended model. Hence the evidence of a significant change due to the parole abolition and reformed sentencing in Virginia has become stronger. However, this result is not found for all other six crime series, in In our analysis we consider the BSM with a deterministic slope for the trend component and with intervention effects; the sample sizes are 324 (monthly) and 108 (quarterly); MVT = motor vehicle theft; AA = aggravated assault; abs.diff = absolute difference between monthly and quarterly estimates; the asterisk* indicates statistical significance.",

The monthly and quarterly analyses are based on the same models, but in case of the larceny series, the behaviour of the trend component is somewhat different (more variation in the quarterly case) and this affects the estimate of the step break dummy.

The examined crime rate series are monthly data on burglary, larceny, motor vehicle theft, robbery, aggravated assault, murder, and rape in the years 1984-2010. We have verified our results with the same but quarterly data set. The empirical results have indicated that the legislation of January 1, 1995 has significantly affected only burglary (\u22123.99) and murder (\u22120.09). Significant gradual drops in crime rates based on a smooth break intervention variable for the 1995-2000 period have been found for larceny and murder. The bivariate analyses for burglary have yielded two significant drops of \u22123.99 (with aggravated assault as reference) and \u22125.19 (with motor vehicle theft as reference). In the case of rape, we found a significant drop of \u22120.24 in one of the three bivariate model specifications. We have not found an effect of the new legislation for aggravated assault which is also a violent offence.",

            "text": "Virginia's abolition of parole and reform of the sentencing system provides a useful social experiment to study. First, the legislation had a big impact on society and it focussed on all felonies. Second, the legislation was enacted at a time in which there were various, favourable changes in a number of social and economic indicators. Third, the 1990s also witnessed the implementation of a number of initiatives focused on reducing crime at the Federal, State and Community levels. Disentangling the impact of parole abolition from the other factors poses multiple design and analytical challenges. According to the Virginia crime officials, research to date has been unable to determine if the observed reductions in crime rates were due to specific anti-crime initiatives. Hence, adopting a structural intervention time series analysis, we have aimed to contribute to a better understanding of the statistical relationship between anti-crime efforts and crime reductions over time.",
