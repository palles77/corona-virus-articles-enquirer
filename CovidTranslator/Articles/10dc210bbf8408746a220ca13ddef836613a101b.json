The effect is stronger (weaker) for small (large) companies, who are less (more) likely to engage in the development of new vaccines. A potential negative investor climate (on Main Street)induced by disease-related feardoes not alter the positive sentiment effect.",

Notably, investor sentiment is found to have a significant impact on stock market returns. Mehra and Sah (2002) relate in a theoretical framework the effect of feelings on investors' decision making in financial markets. Nofsinger (2005) finds that interpersonal communication, leading to \"social mood,\" translates into emotions such as optimism, pessimism, happiness, or anxiety. A general finding is that fear leads to negative asset returns, while positive emotions increase investors' willingness to take risks.",

Despite the overall negative sentiment in the population due to fear of being infected, public and political demand for containing an infectious disease can lead to additional income channels for pharmaceutical companies. Typical reactions to an infectious illness include higher R&D investment (partially subsidized by the government), vaccine mass orders, or a general increase in demand for preventive measures (e.g., medicine, disinfection agents, and surgical masks). We focus on four major infectious diseases that were regarded as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) by the WHO. The outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2003, Influenza A (H1N1) in 2009, and Polio and Ebola in 2014 were all more or less intensively covered by media.",

            "text": "The role of mass media in communication of potential risks has been subject to intense debate. It is argued that lowprobability, high-consequence events, such as potential health risks associated with outbreaks of rare diseases, are overemphasized in media-generated news waves. This unbalanced reporting leads to a disjunction between actual and people's perceived risk (Vasterman et al., 2005; Mairal, 2011; Young et al., 2013) . For instance, a representative survey conducted by Blendon et al. (2004) indicates that 69% of respondents living in Ontario, 57% in Canada excluding Ontario, and 32% in the U. S. were concerned about contracting SARS, whereas, educative and informative communication efforts in Singapore resulted in a much lower overall anxiety level. Quah and Hin-Peng (2004) report that only 14% of respondents viewed SARS as a personal risk in May 2003. Public overreaction and panic can also lead to adverse economic effects. In particular, sectors such as tourism or retail sales fall due to individuals' preventive measures, such as reduction in traveling to the affected areas or avoidance of public places. In the case of SARS, Hanna and Yiping (2004) estimate the total cost at about 0.5% of GDP in China, while Keogh- Brown and Smith (2008) assess the global economic impact between 30 billion USD and 100 billion USD. Using a general equilibrium model for the U.K., Smith et al. (2009) estimate costs related to Influenza A (H1N1) between 0.5% and 1.0% of U.K.'s GDP. However, the total economic burden is difficult to quantify since both direct health care costs as well as indirect costs of work absenteeism and loss of productivity have to be taken into account.",

In addition, the absolute number of news announcements remains above the average up to six days after the announcement. This is not surprising since PHEIC statements are followed by other official/institutional news, which is used to build our event-day mood variable in the next section. Specifically, in two out of the four cases, an event (i.e., DRNs) was taking place on any of the six days following a PHEIC announcement. These observations provide support for the existence of a relatively strong relation between official news and media coverage and therefore between DRNs and investor sentiment. Moreover, they suggest that the sentiment effect lasts for several days. This evidence provides support for the persistent sentiment hypothesis formulated in Section 4.",

            "text": "The pharmaceutical industry is at the heart of the U.S. economy. Although public and private spending on pharmaceuticals in the U.S. collectively contributed just over 2% (around 1000 USD) to the country's GDP per capita in 2011 (OECD, 2013) , 1 this share was the largest among the OECD countries. In 2009, the overall U.S. health care expenditures accounted for 18% of the country's GDP, but it is estimated to contribute 37% in 2050. 2 Furthermore, biopharmaceutical companies in the U.S. account for the largest share of all U.S. companies' R&D expenditures, which represents nearly 20% of all domestic R&D (PhRMA, 2015) . 3 It is one of the fastest growing industries. Indeed, both revenues and R&D spending by the U.S. biopharmaceutical industry tripled from 1996 to 2008 (Lazonick and Tulum, 2011) . Further, Offit (2005) documents an increase in the market concentration of vaccine producers in the U.S. over past decades. Specifically, there are currently only four FDA-approved U.S.-based publicly traded vaccine producers and distributors. 4 The reasons for companies undertaking or quitting vaccine production are multifold. On the one hand, research, development, testing, and manufacturing of vaccines are costly; on the other hand, the market for selling vaccines is smaller than the market for pharmaceutical drugs, to name just few reasons. However, high entry barriers for the development of a new vaccine bears potential for monopoly. Additionally, there is no manufacturing of generic vaccines, as vaccine production is substantially more complicated and technologically advanced than drug production. 5 The result is an increase in vaccine shortages, especially for flu vaccines (Hinman et al., 2006) . The emergence of a dangerous infectious disease can thus be regarded as a potentially new market for vaccine producers, along with subsidized R&D. Therefore, it is surprising that research focusing on the effects of investor sentiment on the stock prices of pharmaceutical companies has been underwhelming.",

We recognize that all regularly spaced updates may be anticipated by stock market investors and may be priced in prior to the actual update. For this reason, our sample of announcements comprises only those updates that documented first-time cross-border transmissions. This strategy helps ensure the independence of subsequent announcements, insofar as crossborder transmissions of infectious diseases occur unpredictably. In the case of SARS, we observe a rapid spread across countries within the first two months. 11 In total, 29 countries were affected by the disease. In the case of Influenza A (H1N1), the official list contains more than 214 countries and overseas territories or communities as of 1 August 2010. The virus spreads quickly and our list includes a sizable number of first cross-border transmission dates (around 50). For polio, we abstain from identifying first outbreak dates as there are only 10 event dates in total. Considering Ebola, we count 10 crossborder transmissions in total.

To test for the impact of DRNs on pharmaceutical stock returns, we employ the rates of return on a variety of portfolios comprising pharmaceutical stocks. Specifically, we construct four benchmark pharmaceutical portfolios. The first is an equally weighted portfolio (EW). The EW portfolio draws on the literature on the optimality of portfolios of na\u00efve investors (De Miguel et al., 2009) . The second is a value-weighted portfolio of all pharmaceutical stocks with time-varying market-value based weights (VW). The third portfolio is a constant-value-weighted portfolio accounting for the 10 largest pharmaceutical stocks (TOP). The fourth is a constant-value-weighted portfolio of the 10 smallest pharmaceutical stocks (BOTTOM). The VW portfolio emphasizes the role of large companies as opposed to small companies. The TOP portfolio illustrates a real-world situation where investors are constrained by cardinality constraints. The BOTTOM portfolio addresses our Hypothesis 4 stated in the next section. Finally, the inclusion of the S&P 500 Information Technology Index (S&P 500 IT), a standardized and tradable diversified portfolio of stocks, seeks to project our hypotheses on sectors other than the pharmaceutical. In doing so, we show that the DRNs positive sentiment spreads to other sectors and confirm that the breadth of sentiment is not confined only to the pharmaceutical industry.",

The median follows a similar pattern with one notable exception, where the difference between the mean and the median (and hence the ensuing asymmetries in the probability density function) is largest for the EW portfolio. The range of variation between the maximum and the minimum returns is greatest for the S&P 500 IT portfolio (11.46% and \u00c0 9.67%, respectively) and lowest for the VW portfolio (10.17% and \u00c0 6.52%, respectively). The BOTTOM portfolio has the highest idiosyncratic risk, as measured by the standard deviation (1.63%), whereas the TOP portfolio is the least risky to invest (1.03%). Moreover, portfolio returns are negatively skewed, with an exception of the VW portfolio. The negative skewness implies that large negative returns are more likely than large positive returns. Furthermore, returns on the five portfolios are leptokurtic, where the coefficient of excess kurtosis is greater than zero. A high value of excess kurtosis contributes to the observed non-normality of returns for the five portfolios, as measured by the Jarque-Bera test statistic. The Ljung-Box test statistic provides evidence of serial correlation in (squared) returns. Therefore, our regression-based methodology in Section 4.3 is designed so as to account for heteroscedasticity. Notes: This table reports the descriptive statistics of continuously compounded day-to-day percentage returns on the five investment portfolios. EW denotes returns on an equally weighted portfolio of pharmaceutical stocks. VW denotes returns on a (time-varying) value-weighted portfolio of pharmaceutical stocks.

Q 5 denotes the Ljung-Box test statistic for the fifth-order cumulative autocorrelation of stock returns, and Q 5 2 denotes the Ljung-Box test statistic for the fifth-order cumulative autocorrelation of returns squared. The table also provides the p-values for the significance tests of the Jarque-Bera and Ljung-Box statistics (in parentheses).

In this scenario, anxiety and fear spread across different stock market sectors and may instigate a drop in the pharmaceutical stock prices.

(1998) report that the larger the information salience of an announcement, the faster the contents are incorporated into closed-end country funds' prices. Within the pharmaceutical industry, considerable media coverage can cause significant changes in stock prices through continuous overreporting, even though no genuinely new information becomes available to the market (Huberman and Regev, 2001) .

This hypothesis is supported by recent studies suggesting that the stocks of small firms are mainly held by local investors who tend to be largely influenced by specific events (Edmans et al., 2007) . Furthermore, even though large pharmaceutical companies act as forerunners of R&D activities, it may be less costly for small pharmaceutical companies to act as followers in the development of new drugs. 12 However, vaccine production requires more costly and sophisticated technologies than drug production (Hinman et al., 2006) . The costs of developing effective new vaccines place a constraint on small pharmaceutical firms. As a result, they are likely to develop new vaccines less frequently than large firms.

We choose five lagged returns to be sure that all serial correlations have been accounted for. The dummy variables for the days of the week are employed to account for the so-called \"Monday effect.\" To account for a possible positive sentiment effect on the days following DRNs, or differently, for a possible reversal effect, we run also the following regression: approach. The Last event approach gives rise to positive abnormal returns following the event day for the EW and BOTTOM portfolios. The increase prior to the event can be attributed to the sensitivity of the Last event approach to the contiguous (preceding) events in the overlapping window. The First event approach points to an increase in returns of the EW and BOTTOM portfolios on the event day. This increase is rather persistent on the days following the event, thus, confirming that those DRNs that were discarded in the CAR calculation had a positive impact on pharmaceutical stock returns. The results are less supportive for the VW and TOP portfolios. The event study results are weaker than the regression results reported in the next section due to the fact that only 33 out of 146 DRNs were employed in the CAR analysis. In general, EW Last/First (VW, TOP, and BOTTOM) experienced in 27%/30.7% (34.6%/42.3%, 38.4%/42.3%, and 53.8%/50%) of all event cases a significant CAR at the 10% level. The CAR analysis provides evidence supporting the persistent (positive) sentiment effect hypothesis (Hypothesis 3). One could anticipate that the SMB factor in the three-factor Fama-French model already captures some of the effect of investment sentiment, biasing the estimate of CARs. Indeed, if investors holding smaller cap stocks become more optimistic, then the SMB factor increases, and the CAR decreases. We also compute the CARs by employing the excess return on the market in a one-factor model. 16 The unreported results suggest more pronounced CARs for the BOTTOM portfolio. Overall, our event study analysis reveals a positive and persistent effect of DRNs on the stock returns of pharmaceutical companies.",

Panel A documents our main findings that result from incorporating all events in the regression analysis. For robustness purposes, we also rerun our model on a subsample of DRNs by employing WHO-related announcements only (see Panel B). Consistently with Hypothesis 1, a negative and significant effect of the fear gauge index is obtained. This effect is robust across the five portfolios. The estimated coefficient \u03b2 5 ranges from \u00c0 0.1378 (TOP portfolio) to \u00c0 0.2056 (VW portfolio). Thus, the effect of investor fear gauge is strongest for diversified portfolios of stocks and weakest for large firms. Further, the DRNs variable effect is always positive and generally significant at the 5% level, vindicating Hypothesis 2. The coefficient estimate ranges from 0.1781 (VW) to 0.3883 (S&P 500 IT). Thus, in the wake of DRNs, stock returns increase by roughly 18-39 bps. This is an interesting finding, insofar as disease outbreaks, such as Ebola, may not actually spread in the United States. However, investor decisions can be guided by sentiment. Paradoxically, while dangerous infectious diseases may impose non-negligible costs on the economy and may potentially lead to the depletion of resources, DRNs can produce an optimistic view and a positive sentiment effect among U.S. investors. They unreasonably anticipate that pharmaceutical companies whose stocks or ADRs are listed on the NYSE or NASDAQ will invest in R&D and, potentially, raise their future cash flows.",

At the same time, they underestimate the probability that vaccines and medicines are not necessarily effective (Shortridge, 2004) . The results unambiguously indicate that investors should buy stocks when an infectious disease outbreak is announced. Moreover, investment in a portfolio dominated by large cap stocks (such as TOP or VW) when a disease outbreak is announced yields a lower return than investment in a portfolio of small cap stocks (such as BOTTOM), ceteris paribus. 17 This finding supports Hypothesis 4, wherein small cap stocks respond stronger to investor sentiment than large cap stocks. This result agrees with Brown and Cliff (2005) and Edmans et al. (2007) . Table 4 further shows that the investor fear gauge has the smallest (largest) effect (in absolute value) for the TOP (VW) portfolio (\u00c0 0.1481 and \u00c0 0.2163, respectively).

It is qualitatively similar to the results reported by Kaplanski and Levy (2012) , wherein the investor fear gauge provoked by the 1973 Arab-Israeli War is responsible for a negative effect on the stock market return of the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange. Table 4 also indicates that the investor sentiment effect is positive and persistent. We use six lags of DRNs to capture the persistence. The number of lags is dictated by Fig. 1 , which indicates that the number of media articles remains above average six days after PHEIC event. We thus expect that the positive sentiment effect will last for six days due to a continuous flow of information in the stock market. We test the combined effect of the contemporaneous and lagged DRNs on pharmaceutical stock returns. To this end, we test for the significance of the coefficient sum \u03b2 \u2211 = i I i 0 4, , where I\u00bc6. Entries related to this coefficient sum highlight that the DRNs positive sentiment effect is stronger among small pharmaceutical firms (0.8169) and is weaker for the VW portfolio (0.4860). In all cases, the coefficient is significant at the 1% level. The estimated lagged effects are consistent with Kaplanski and Levy (2010b) , who argue that the announcement typically receives headlines several days after the event. The estimation results for the five portfolios show a positive and significant effect (at the 5% level) for at least six trading days after DRNs are released. Thus, our results also support Hypothesis 3, wherein positive investor sentiment remains significant several days after the DRNs. This result agrees with Huberman and Regev (2001) , who underscore the importance of the information salience of a breakthrough in biopharmaceutical research. The contemporaneous and lagged effects provide unequivocal evidence that DRNs have a positive and significant (either contemporaneous or lagged) effect on pharmaceutical stock prices.",

That is, during tranquil times, 100% of an investor's wealth is invested in the market portfolio, which is proxied by the S&P 500. On event days that coincide with high volatility periods, the investor reallocates funds by going 150% long in a pharmaceutical portfolio and 50% short in the VIX and holds the position between one (1D) and three (3D) days.

For instance, typically at least 850 million USD is needed to develop and license a new pharmaceutical product (Masignani et al., 2003) . As a result, pharmaceutical stock prices should not respond to DRNs. Thus, DRNs can only lead to higher stock prices and returns of other pharmaceutical companies through altering investor sentiment about their future performance and leading to irrational trading (Kaplanski and Levy, 2010b) .
