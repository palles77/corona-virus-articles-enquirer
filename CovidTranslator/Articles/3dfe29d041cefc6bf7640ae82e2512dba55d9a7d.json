Surface NHE3 serves as the key regulatory site controlling electroneutral Na + absorption. In this study, our results showed that the surface NHE3 content was significantly reduced following TGEV infection, whereas the total level of protein expression was not significantly changed, and NHE3 activity gradually decreased with prolonged infection time. We then inhibited SGLT1 expression by lentiviral interference and drug inhibition, respectively. Inhibition studies showed that the level of phosphorylation of the downstream key proteins, MAPKAPK-2 and EZRIN, in the SGLT1-mediated p38MAPK/AKt2 signaling pathway was significantly increased. The surface NHE3 expression was also significantly increased, and NHE3 activity was also significantly enhanced. These results demonstrate that a TGEV infection can inhibit NHE3 translocation and attenuates sodium-hydrogen exchange activity via the SGLT1-mediated p38MAPK/AKt2 signaling pathway, affecting cellular electrolyte absorption leading to diarrhea.",

Transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) is a coronavirus characterized by severe diarrhea, vomiting, and dehydration, with the death rates as high as 100 % in one-week-old piglets, whereas three-week-old infected piglets survive; however, these recovered piglets can spread TGEV to other uninfected piglets for several days (Tajima, 1970; Leopoldt and Meyer, 1978; Lawhorn, 2007) . Moreover, TGEV has been reported to cause a severe infection in mature mucosal epithelial cells of the proximal small intestine, induce villi atrophy, and reduce the villous height and crypt depth (Xia et al., 2018) . In addition, BuTRr has also been found in the diarrhea of piglets infected with TGEV, and exhibited increased quantities and concentrations of sodium, potassium, and chloride in the stools (Kelly et al., 1972) .",

Under normal physiological conditions, the balance of absorption and secretion of intestinal water and electrolytes plays an important role in maintaining homeostasis of the intestinal environment (Field, 2003; Zhang et al., 2012) . Although viruses, bacteria, and some enterotoxins invade intestinal epithelial cells, the expression and activity of related ion channels and transport carriers on intestinal epithelial cells undergo abnormal changes, leading to disturbances in the absorption and secretion of water and electrolytes (i.e., Na + ). Na + /H + exchanger 3 (NHE3), belongs to the SLC9A family and is present in the intestinal and renal epithelia, which is primarily responsible for the electrical neutral absorption of Na + (Dynia et al., 2010) . Moreover, Nhe3 \u2212/\u2212 mice have an absorptive defect in the intestine and kidney, and suffer from an acid-base unbalance and Na + -fluid volume disorder (Schultheis et al., 1998) .",

Na + -glucose co-transporter1 (SGLT1) is predominantly expressed in the mucosa of the small intestine and has been found to play an important role in the absorption of Na + and glucose (Xu et al., 2018; Wright et al., 2004) . Previous studies have demonstrated that SGLT1 can regulate NHE3 translocation to the plasma membrane via the p38MAPK/Akt2 signaling pathway in intestinal epithelial cells via the sequential activation p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), MAPK-activated protein kinase 2 (MAPKAPK-2), Akt2, and ezrin (Cha and Donowitz, 2008) ; however, the role of SGLT1-induced NHE3 translocation in viral infection remains unknown.",

Several previous studies have found that diarrhea is associated with NHE expression and activity. For instance, congenital sodium diarrhea (CSD) is a rare autosomal recessive diarrheal disorder with symptoms characterized by the secretion of a large volume of persistent high Na + diarrhea, which is considered to be related to the lack of NHE3 protein expression in vivo (Holmberg and Perheentupa, 1985; Booth et al., 1985; Janecke et al., 2016) . Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) consists of a group of chronic inflammatory diseases, the mechanisms of which involve changes in the intestinal movement and abnormal epithelial ion transport (i.e., Na + absorption defects in the colonic mucosa) (Clayburgh et al., 2006) . One of the significant components of altered electrolyte flux in infectious diarrhea is a reduction in Na + absorption via impaired NHE activity, which is shown in mouse models of infection with Salmonella typhimurium and Campylobacter jejuni (Khurana et al., 1991; Kanwar et al., 2010) .",

            "text": "However, less is known about the role of NHE in diarrhea during viral gastroenteritis. Astroviral infections have been suggested to lead to decreased levels of NHE3 in the insoluble protein fraction of enterocytes, and previous studies have shown that TGEV infection can affect changes in the both the intracellular and extracellular concentration of sodium ions in intestinal epithelial cells (Nighot et al., 2010) . In our study, we found that TGEV infection could reduce the level of NHE3 protein expression on the epithelial membrane, and Y. Yang, et al. Virus Research 280 (2020) 197901 weakened its sodium hydrogen exchange activity, whereas the level of NHE3 mRNA was continuously increased. Thus, we concluded that the weakened the power of sodium-hydrogen exchange after TGEV infection are associated with changes in the NHE3 protein content on the cell plasma membrane, independent of transcriptional levels. NHE3 is one of nine isoforms of the mammalian Na + /H + exchanger (NHE) gene family, which is continually trafficked between the plasma membrane and intracellular organelles, and only its distribution on the plasma membrane is indicative of sodium hydrogen exchange activity (Donowitz and Li, 2007) . The mechanism by which NHE3 activity is regulated is extremely complex, among which acute regulation is the most important mode of activity that includes changes in the turnover number and trafficking; the latter of which involves several regulatory proteins. Previous studies have shown that SGLT1 activation by D-glucose can initiate a linear signaling pathway that includes early activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase, followed by activation of MAP kinase activated kinase 2 (MAPK)/APK-2, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-K), Akt2, and Ezrin, which lead to Y. Yang, et al. Virus Research 280 (2020) 197901 NHE3 translocation to stimulate NHE3 activity (Cha and Donowitz, 2008) . Moreover, a co-transport relationship exists between SGLT1 and NHE3 under physiological conditions (Coon et al., 2011) . In the present study, we found that SGLT1 inhibition via siRNA transfection and treatment with Phlorizin could up-regulate the expression of p-MAP-KAPK-2 and p-Ezrin in the p38MAPK/Akt2 pathway and increase the translocation of NHE3. In addition, there was a corresponding enhancement of sodium hydrogen exchange. As mentioned in the introduction, SGLT1 is also involved in Na + absorption; thus, there were no significant changes in the intracellular and extracellular concentration of Na + compared with the control groups after SGLT1 was inhibited by transfection with siRNA b. In conclusion, these results suggest that the inhibition of the SGLT1 expression promoted NHE3 translocation and exchange activity under physiological conditions. TGEV infection has been shown to increase the level of SGLT protein expression at 48 h, which was consistent with previous reports by Dai Phlorizin for 15 min, and samples were measured using the pH sensitive dye BCECF-AM. Each experiment was performed in triplicate. *0.01 < p < 0.05, **p < 0.01. Y. Yang, et al. Virus Research 280 (2020) 197901 et al. (Dai et al., 2016) . Moreover, in Fig. 2D at 72 h post-TGEV infection, a smaller fragment of beta-Tubulin was detected, suggesting that it might be cleaved by a viral or host proteinase(s) at later stages of TGEV infection. At the same time, our previous research results showed that TGEV infection could reduce the level of surface NHE3 protein expression. Thus, we hypothesized that TGEV might regulate NHE3 trafficking by affecting the SGLT1-mediated activation of the P38MAPK/Akt2 pathway. Therefore, the cells were transfected with SGLT1-siRNA b and treated with Phlorizin to inhibit the expression of SGLT1, followed by Fig. 5 . TGEV regulated the surface NHE3 protein contents via SGLT1-mediated p38MAPK/ AKt2 pathway. (A) IPEC-J2 infected TGEV for 48 h after Knockdown of SGLT1 expression by transfection siRNA b, then the expression of p-MAPKAPK-2, MAPKAPK-2, p-EARIN, EZRIN, the surface NHE3, Total NHE3, SGLT1 and \u03b2tubulin protein were analyzed by western-blot.

(B-E) Grayscale analysis of the changes in p-MAPKAPK-2/ MAPKAPK-2, p-EARIN / EZRIN, the contents of surface NHE3, toal NHE3/\u03b2tubulin and SGLT1 level, Each experiment was performed in triplicate. *0.01 < p < 0.05. an incubation with TGEV. We then found that the level of p-MAPKAPK-2 and p-EZRIN protein expression were both reduced following TGEV infection after transfection with SGLT1-siRNA b, and enhanced NHE3 trafficking and the power of Na + absorption. TGEV infection had no significant effect on the level of p-MAPKAPAK-2 protein expression after IPEC-J2 cells were treated with Phlorizin; however, the surface NHE3 protein content was still increased, and the activity of Na + absorption was enhanced. It has been established that since Phlorizin is a non-selective SGLT inhibitor, when applied to a target, it may affect the expression and activity of other proteins. Therefore, while there was no change in the level of phosphorylation of the upstream proteins, the downstream phosphoric acid levels remained up-regulated. We suspect that there may be other signaling pathways involved in the common regulation of EZRIN-mediated NHE3 translocation. These data suggest that TGEV infection may weaken NHE3 activity due to a reduction of surface NHE3 protein content through SGLT1-mediated activation of the P38MAPK/Akt2 signaling pathway, and this may provide a new strategy for treating diarrhea in infected piglets.
