Because MERS CoV has led to mortality as high as 40%, it has become one of the most important emerging pathogens threatening human health. Recently, the outbreak of MERS CoV, which resulted in 172 infections and 27 deaths in South Korea, was the largest outside Saudi Arabia. A 44-year-old man, had been exposed to the first confirmed MERS case who shared a ward with the man's father in this outbreak, travelled from South Korea to China, becoming the first imported MERS case reported in China. Here, we report the sequencing and analysis of the MERS CoV genome from this case. Viral genome sequencing provides information vital to tracing the pathogenic source, predicting viral virulence, and following the pattern of viral evolution, variation, and transmission [2] [3] [4] .",

The deposited sequence was 29,928 bp, which was ~180 bp shorter than the complete genomic sequence, as the technique of 5\u2032-and 3\u2032-RACE (rapid-amplification of cDNA ends), which amplifies genomic ends, was not applied.",

Remarkably, there were two different secondary branches KSAa and KSAb, suggesting that two different origins of MERS CoV may prevail in Saudi Arabia. The phylogenetic tree of ORF1a gene (Figure 1b ) was closer to that of the full-length genome.

We identified three new mutations in the polyprotein ORF1ab; however, no variation in genes associated with viral assembly or the virulence-linked S, E, M and N genes were observed, nor was there any apparent recombination in the genome. These results further suggest that the virulence of the MERS CoV did not increase. Based on current reports, mortality was ~10%, which is far lesser than the 40% previously reported. Simultaneously, the epidemiological characteristics of the virus suggest that it is still limited to human-to-human transmission, with no sign of a large-scale outbreak.",

            "text": "As the case reported here illustrates, globalization and frequent international travel can pose a threat to human health worldwide, and exposure to the infectious agent can occur unpredictably [5] [6] [7] . Hence, excellent technical preparations and mandatory close monitoring are critical for rapid detection of pathogenic viruses like MERS CoV, and to reduce the risk of a pandemic. We were able to achieve this by identification and analysis of the viral genome from the only imported case of MERS CoV, with no contacts being infected in Guangdong up to now [8] .",
