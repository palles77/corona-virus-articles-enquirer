The robots and kit evaluated represent major commercially available methods that are capable of simultaneous extraction of DNA and RNA from respiratory specimens, and included platforms based on magnetic-bead technology (KingFisher mL, Biorobot EZ1, easyMAG, KingFisher Flex, and MagNA Pure Compact) or glass fiber filter technology (Biorobot MDX and the manual kit Allprep). All methods yielded extracts free of cross-contamination and RT-PCR inhibition. All automated systems recovered L. pneumophila and adenovirus DNA equivalently. However, the MagNA Pure protocol demonstrated more than 4-fold higher DNA recovery from the S. pyogenes than other methods. The KingFisher mL and easyMAG protocols provided 1-to 3-log wider linearity and extracted 3-to 4-fold more RNA from the human influenza virus and respiratory syncytial virus. These findings suggest that systems differed in nucleic acid recovery, reproducibility, and linearity in a pathogen specific manner.",

These assays require nucleic acid extraction from biological samples. The yield and quality of nucleic acids have a direct impact up assay performance (Liu, 2008; Muldrew, 2009 ). The traditional DNA/RNA isolation techniques using phenol/chloroform extraction are time consuming and prone to sample cross contamination and PCR inhibition from phenol/chloroform carryover. Manual column purification kits using glass fiber filters were developed to replace phenol/chloroform extraction procedures. These kits involve alkaline lysis of cells followed by capture of nucleic acid on a filter membrane in a spin column in the presence of chaotropic reagents. Although these methods have demonstrated improved perfor-mance and are extensively used for general molecular biology purposes, they require large elution volumes and are subject to problems such as filter clogging and inconsistent yield (Yang et al., 2008) . In addition, increasing demand in clinical diagnosis necessitates reliable automated methods for efficient recovery of nucleic acid from clinical specimens. A solid phase binding technology using magnetic beads was introduced into robotic systems to provide rapid and high-throughput detection capacity (Akutsu et al., 2004) .",

Evaluation of methods that allow simultaneous DNA and RNA extraction is useful for clinical diagnosis because the etiology of acute respiratory diseases includes a wide spectrum of microorganisms that can have RNA or DNA genomes and may be present singly or as mixed infections (Mancini et al., 2008; Paranhos-Baccala et al., 2008) . Pathogen coinfections are common and may implicate poor prognosis. For example, a recent investigation of pandemic 2009 influenza A (H1N1) cases found that presence of Streptococcus pneumoniae in H1N1 patients was associated with higher mortality (Palacios et al., 2009 ). Con- current detection of several viruses with Gram positive/negative bacteria has been reported in children with pneumonia (Korppi et al., 1991; Palacios et al., 2009; Wolf et al., 2010) .

Bacteria were spiked at concentrations of approximately 5 \u00d7 10 6 cells. Viral cultures were titrated to the concentrations that produced a C T value around 25 from RT-PCR analysis of nucleic acid extracted using KingFisher mL. Twenty-four samples in a volume of 100 L per tube were prepared for each extraction method. These samples were extracted following the manufacturers' instructions using the robotic systems or the manual kit described in Table 1 . KingFisher Flex was purchased and added to the phase two studies. Extractions were performed by trained users of each platform on three separate days. PCR-grade water (Cat# 9935, Ambion, Austin, TX, USA) was processed in parallel to monitor cross contamination. DNA/RNA was eluted into 100.0 L elution buffer supplied by the manufacturers. The volume of final elutes from each extraction system were adjusted to 200 L with EB buffer (Cat# 1014609, Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA) and aliquots were stored at \u221280 \u2022 C. All samples were subjected to fewer than two freeze-thaw cycles. In the phase two studies, fresh cultures of the representative pathogens except for the influenza A virus that was BPL inactivated were pooled and spiked into nasal following the phase-one procedures unless indicated otherwise. Ten-fold serial dilutions of the spiked samples were prepared in 100 L of nasal wash. These samples were coded and stored at \u221280 \u2022 C. Identical aliquots of three sets of samples were prepared for each experiment. MagNA Pure and MDX were removed from the phase two evaluations due to malfunctions of the systems at the time of the studies. purity of extracted nucleic acid were excluded as tRNA absorbs UV light and interferes with A260 and A280 readings (Subbarayan et al., 1995) . Rather, the efficacy of extraction methods was compared using C T value from RT-PCR analysis. Although RT-PCR amplification efficiency may vary between assays, one criterion was employed for all of the comparisons, i.e., one C T represents 2fold difference in template input. RT-PCR was performed using the AgPath-ID One-Step RT-PCR kit (Cat# AM1005, Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and the 7500 real-time PCR system (AppliedBiosystems, Carlsbad, CA, USA). All the RT-PCR assays were developed in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The sequences of the primers and probes are available upon request. Each reaction contained 5 l of the nucleic acid in a standard 25 l assay. Data was analyzed using SDS 1.4 software (AppliedBiosystems, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and GraphPad Prism software version 5.03 (GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA).",

In contrast, easyMag (bioM\u00e9rieux, Marcy l'Etoile, France), EZ1 (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA), and MagNA Pure Compact (Roche, Indianapolis, IN, USA) are closed systems with preprogrammed protocols, which should minimize cross contamination and human errors.

The outer cell wall of Gram-positive bacteria consists of a complex of cross-linked peptidoglycan, teichoic acid, polysaccharides, and other proteins, whereas the Gram-negative cell wall is thinner with a fairly simple cross-linking pattern. Although both S. pyogenes and S. pneumoniae are Gram-positive bacteria, lysis of S. pyogenes appears to be more challenging because S. pyogenes contains more peptidoglycan and its cell wall polysaccharide is estimated at 6-10% of the dry weight of the microorganisms (McCarty, 1952; Salton, 1953) . The viral genome is wrapped within a protein capsid or lipid bilayer membrane. These structural differences may explain why all of the methods displayed similar efficiency in DNA extraction from the DNA virus (adenovirus) and the Gram-negative bacterium (L. pneumophila) (Figs. 1 and 2) , but exhibited about a 20fold difference in efficiency in DNA recovery from Gram-positive S. pyogenes (Fig. 1) .",

Rather, their performance appeared to be pathogen specific. The MagNA Pure Compact was most suitable for DNA extraction from the Grampositive S. pyogenes, whereas KingFisher mL and EasyMag provided better performance for the RNA viruses.
