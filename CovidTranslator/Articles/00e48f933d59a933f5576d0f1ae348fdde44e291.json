The matrix is composed of small acid molecules that have a strong optical absorption in the range of the laser wavelength used, although the composition is different according to the type of laser used and the biomolecule to be analyzed. The molecules are then both desorbed and ionized by charge transfer by absorbing the energy of a short laser pulse. The desorbed and ionized molecules are first accelerated in an electrical field and ejected through a metal flight tube and collide with a detector at the end of the flight tube. This cycle is repeated at a frequency of 50 Hz or more. Thus, biomolecules are separated according to their mass and create a mass spectrum that is characterized by both the mass and the intensity of the ions. Finally, the result is a spectral signature (spike representation) that is then searched for in the appropriate database for the identification of the microorganism, comparing with values provides by the manufacturer of the database.",

Low viral loads near the detection limit of the method and weak cross-reactivity might contribute to the few discrepant results with reference methods.

The detection of respiratory viruses such as influenza viruses are mainly performed using PCR techniques (real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; rRT-PCR) or antibody-based assays to identify the nucleoproteins. Alternative methods have been investigated for viral diagnosis, such as multiplexed flow cytometry [14] , microarrays [15] , and MS [16] . MS has been considered as one of the best methods for protein analysis because of its low detection limit and high accuracy. It has been also demonstrated that the combined use of antibody-magnetic nanoparticles and MALDI-TOF MS is suitable for sensitive detection of influenza viruses [17] . This method could also be used for the rapid screening of virus subtypes, suggesting a promising application in early and accurate diagnosis of influenza viruses. It has developed rapid sample preparation method to allow identification of cultured respiratory viruses with MS and multiplex PCR coupled with this technique to detect the most common respiratory viruses such as influenza virus, parainfluenza viruses, coronavirus, metapneumovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, adenovirus, and bocavirus [18\u00c020].",

Classical detection of enteric virus is mostly based on conventional approaches such as indirect immunofluorescence assay, neutralizing testing, and cell culture and immunohistochemical detection. However, some clinical samples remain undetectable because of the absence of antibodies against viral proteins, and cell culture and neutralization tests are time-consuming and laborious. Multiplex RT-PCR and real-time PCR have shown good sensitivity and specificity [21] . For these viruses, the MALDI-TOF MS technology has demonstrated high capacity to diagnose with high throughput and short turnaround time. MALDI-TOF MS measures the intrinsic physical properties of molecules directly. A PCR mass assay combining multiplex PCR with MALDI-TOF MS technology has shown simultaneous detection of eight human enteric viruses including poliovirus, coxsackievirus A16, enterovirus 71, hepatitis E virus, echovirus, norovirus, astrovirus, and reovirus [22] . This method has a sensitivity ranging from 100 to 1000 copies per reaction and shows that this assay could be used for the simultaneous detection of co-infections with several viruses. MALDI-TOF MS has been also used for the diagnosis of hand, foot, and mouth disease that is caused by acute enterovirus infections such as poliovirus, coxsackievirus A and B, and echovirus. These infections are clinically indistinguishable but infection with echovirus 71 could be complicated with aseptic meningitis, encephalitis, and acute flaccid paralysis. Recently, a study has developed a MALDI-TOF MS technique for the rapid diagnosis of these viruses [23] . The diagnosis of these pathogens can help to a more comprehensive surveillance of enteroviruses to understand the molecular epidemiology of enteroviruses detecting multiple genotypes simultaneously. The main advantage of this strategy is the identification of several genotypes at the same time, opening up new possibilities for the diagnosis and discovering pathological and epidemiological characteristics.",

The diagnosis of HPV infection is based on several methods, but HPV DNA detection is necessary for the follow-up of the patients. Currently, there are three HPV assays approved for clinical use by the US Food and Drug Administration: two non-PCR-based assays (e.g., Cervista and Hologic, Marlborough, MA; Hybrid Capture 2, Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and a PCR-based method such as the Cobas HPV assay. The majority of these assays use GP5 1 /GP6 1 consensus primers, MY09/11 primers, and their multiprimer derivatives PGMY09/11 primers and the SPF10 system. However, a new method based on the amplification of a fragment of the L1 gene region using GP5 1 /GP6 1 consensus primers using mass array technique based on the MALDI-TOF MS technology has been recently developed to identify 14 high-risk HPVs [24\u00c026]. This MS assay was found to be non-cross-reactive with common low-risk HPV genotypes affecting the genital tract and more sensitive (General sensitivity results ranging from 10 to 100 copies) than the Hybrid Capture 2 and conventional PCR methods. An advantage of this method is that it is possible to extend the HPV genotype spectrum by adding new type-specific primers. The use of this technique together with automated DNA extraction and PCR pipetting procedures could increase the viral detection which a decrease in the cost of the overall assay.",

Variations in the HBV genome are biologically and clinically important and might confer drug resistance or affect virus replication capacity, resulting in failure of antiviral therapy. Some MALDI-TOF MS platforms are capable to detect 60 HBV variants with accuracy and low detection limits [29] . This technology has been used also to study the evolution of drug resistance and to detect minor HBV variants [30] . The main disadvantage of this method is that only HBV genotypes B and C were tested. Some characteristic mutations in HBV could cause lamivudine resistance due to prolonged treatment with this antiviral agent. Current methods for detecting such variants (e.g., sequencing analysis, restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP), and hybridization-based assays) are time-consuming and unsuitable for screening large numbers of samples. For these reasons, it has been developed a MALDI-TOF MS assay suitable for detecting YMDD mutants [28] . This technique provides high rates of accuracy for YMDD mutations and has advantages over RFLP and direct DNA sequencing, including the ability to more sensitively and specifically detects mixed populations as well as being a simpler procedure without need for cloning or multiple PCR steps producing earlier detection of HBV mutations. Moreover, this platform is adaptable for the detection of other mutations or polymorphisms. This method will be very useful to evaluate the emergence of mutant viruses and to monitoring of antiviral treatment of chronic hepatitis B, correlating them to clinical features with regard to response to drug therapy in these patients.",

Currently, the method of choice for this purpose is the nucleotide sequencing of a subgenomic region, but all these methods are complex to standardize, labor-intensive, or non-useful for determining multiple HCV genotypes. However, it is frequent heterogeneity during the course of infection, producing mixed-genotypes infections in some patients. Thus, researchers have developed some MALDI-TOF MS\u00c0based assays for HCV genotyping during the last years [31\u00c033].

For this reason, the typing is not routinely performed in every laboratory, so these samples are being sent out of the hospital and this fact could delay the investigation of these outbreaks and hospital-associated infections. The introduction of MALDI-TOF MS technology in the laboratories can facilitate the performing of tests leading to improve the information to the infection control staff.

Currently, there are a wide number of references in the database from the available commercial platforms for MALDI-TOF techniques. These mass spectra can establish the comparison and further identification of microorganisms, but until now these spectra are limited.
