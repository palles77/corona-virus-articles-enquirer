            "text": "The targeting signals of two yeast integral membrane dipeptidyl aminopeptidases (DPAPs), DPAP B and DPAP A, which reside in the vacuole and the Golgi apparatus, respectively, were analyzed. No single domain of DPAP B is required for delivery to the vacuolar membrane, because removal or replacement of either the cytoplasmic, transmembrane, or lumenal domain did not affect the protein's transport to the vacuole. DPAP A was localized by indirect immunofluorescence to non-vacuolar, punctate structures characteristic of the yeast Golgi apparatus. The 118-amino acid cytoplasmic domain of DPAP A is sufficient for retention of the protein in these structures, since replacement of the cytoplasmic domain of DPAP B with that of DPAP A resulted in an immunolocalization pattern indistinguishable from that of wild type DPAP A. Overproduction of DPAP A resulted in its mislocaliza-tion to the vacuole, because cells expressing high levels of DPAP A exhibited vacuolar as well as Golgi staining. Deletion of 22 residues of the DPAP A cytoplasmic domain resulted in mislocaiization of the mutant protein to the vacuole. Thus, the cytoplasmic domain of DPAP A is both necessary and sufficient for Golgi retention, and removal of the retention signal, or saturation of the retention apparatus by overproducing DPAP A, resulted in transport to the vacuole. Like wild type DPAP B, the delivery of mutant membrane proteins to the vacuole was unaffected in the secretory vesicle-blocked secl mutant; thus, transport to the vacuole was not via the plasma membrane followed by endocytosis. These data are consistent with a model in which membrane proteins are delivered to the vacuole along a default pathway.",

In the absence of retention or sorting signals, soluble proteins of the secretory pathway are secreted; thus, the default pathway for these proteins is secretion (Burgess and Kelly, 1987; Pelham, 1989) . In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, mutations in the targeting signal of the soluble vacuolar protein, carboxypeptidase Y (Vails et al., 1990) , or the retention signal of the soluble ER protein, BiP (Hardwick et al., 1990) , result in the secretion of these proteins. Likewise, the flow of membrane proteins to the cell surface of nonpolarized mammalian cells is apparently by default, because mutations that disrupt the retention of ER or Golgi-retained membrane proteins (Machamer et al., 1987; Machamer, 1991; Jackson et al., 1990) or the sorting of a lysosomal membrane protein (Williams and Fukuda, 1990) result in localization to the plasma membrane. Little is known regarding membrane protein sorting in S. cerevisiae, although a previous study suggested that the cell surface is the default compartment for membrane proteins (Fuller et al., 1989b) . In this paper, we characterize the targeting of two membrane proteins of the yeast secretory pathway, DAP dipeptidyl aminopeptidases (DPAPs) ~ DPAP A and DPAP B of the Golgi apparatus and vacuole, respectively.",

Both DPAP B and ALP are type II membrane glycoproteins (nomenclature of Singer, 1990) , consisting of NH2-terminal cytoplasmic domains of approximately 30 amino acids, single hydrophobic membrane anchors, and COOH-terminal lumenal catalytic domains. These proteins transit the early compartments of the secretory pathway (i.e., ER and Golgi), but not the later compartments (i.e., secretory vesicles), indicating that the proteins do not transiently reside at the plasma membrane before delivery to the vacuole. The localization signals of these two proteins have not been identified, although the lumenal domain of ALP has been shown to be unnecessary for vacuolar targeting (Klionsky and Emr, 1990) .",

In yeast, three membrane-bound proteases, Kex2p, Kexlp, and DPAP A (see Fig. 1 A) process the mating pheromone a-factor precursor polypeptide as it traverses the secretory pathway (Bussey, 1988; Fuller et al., 1988) . The biosynthetic pathways of Kex2p and Kexlp have been characterized (Fuller et al., 1989a,b; Cooper and Bussey, 1989) , and Kex2p has been shown to function in a late Golgi compartment (Julius et al., 1984; Graham and Emr, 1991) . Kex2p has been localized by indirect immunofluorescence to three to six punctate structures per cell that exhibit a somewhat random distribution within the cytoplasmic compartment (Franzusoff et al., 1991; Redding et al., 1991) . Thus, the Golgi apparatus of yeast is not localized to a perinuclear location, as in mammalian cells, but rather is dispersed throughout the cell. Both Kexlp (A. Cooper and H. Bussey, manuscript submitted) and DPAP A (see below) have been immunolocalized to punctate bodies that are similar to those containing Kex2p in size, abundance, and distribution. In this paper, a combined gene fusion and mutational analysis was used to show that no single domain of DPAP B is required for vacuolar localization. Furthermore, both overproduction of DPAP A and a mutation in the cytoplasmic domain of DPAP A resulted in mislocalization of this protein to the vacuole. Finally, the fusion proteins analyzed in this work are shown to be transported directly to the vacuole from the Golgi, and not to the plasma membrane.",

The resulting fusion protein contains the 48 NH2-terminal residues of DPAP B fused to residue three of cytoplasmic invertase ( Fig. 1 B) . BB-Inv was placed under the control of the GAL/promoter by cutting pCJR15 with EcoRI and HiedIII and ligating in the 822-bp GAL/fragment (Johnston and Davis, 1984) . This fused the 3' end of the GAL/fragment at nucleotide -92 of the DAP2 sequence. Vectors encoding A20-BB and A27-BB were constructed as follows. Oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis (Kunkel et al., 1987) was used to create 60-and 81-bp deletions in DAP2 (A20-BB and A27-BB, respectively) in pCJR27. The ~3.2kbp BamHI-HindIII mutant DAP2 fragments were inserted into the BamHI-HindIII sites of the CEN plasmid pSEYC58, creating pMNH1 (620-BB) and pC JR45 (A27-BB). &20-BB and A27-BB were over-produced by replacing the DAP2 promoter with the GAL/promoter as follows. The HindIII site at -92 of DAP2 was blunt ended and religated, creating an NheI site. The ~3-kbp NheI-HindIII fragments of pC JR43 and pC JR44 were inserted at the XbaI-HindIII sites of pC JR52, creating pC JR56 and pC JR54, respectively. The A20 and A27 deletions removed residues 2-21 and 2-27 of DPAP B, changing the NH2-terr~nal acid sequence of DPAP B from NH2-MEG-GEEEVERIPDELFDTKKKHLLDKLIRV30 to NH2-MHLLDKLIRV and NH2-MIRV, respectively ( Fig. 1 B) .",

The signal sequence should direct the translocation of the protein into the ER lumen and be cleaved, rendering the lumenal domain a soluble protein in the secretory Figure 2 .

Analysis of the samples by SDS-PAGE and fluorography showed that 64 % of txFss-B was secreted as a heterogeneous population of highly glycosylated species (Fig. 2, lane 2) , similar to the secreted protein invertase (Esmon et al., 1981) , whereas the intracellular fraction contained a tightly migrating species (Fig. 2 , lane /). Treatment of the immunoprecipitates with Endo H to remove N-linked carbohydrate demonstrated that the difference in the apparent mobilities was due to glycosylation (Fig. 2, lanes 3 and 4) . The glycosylation pattern of the secreted material differs from that of wild type DPAP B, which receives only modest glycosyl modifications of the core oligosaccharides in the Golgi apparatus (Roberts et al., 1989) . To test whether the alteration in glycosylation caused the secretion of the lumenal domain, otFss-B was expressed in an mnn9 mutant, which is deficient in the addition of the extensive t~1,6 outer chain glycosyl groups (Kukuruzinska et al., 1987) . Fig. 2 , lanes 5 and 6, show that t~Fss-B was secreted to the same extent (59%) from mnn9 cells, even though the protein was not aberrantly glycosylated.

Immunoprecipitations of BB-Inv using anti-invertase antibody, followed by SDS-PAGE and fluorography, showed that the fusion protein was glycosylated, and treatment with Endo H showed that the protein was of the expected size (Fig. 3,  lanes 9 and 10) . BB-Inv fractionated with membranes under high pH carbonate conditions, consistent with BB-Inv being an integral membrane protein (data not shown). Invertase enzyme assays of either permeabilized or non-permeabilized whole cells deleted for the invertase structural gene and expressing BB-Inv from a CEN plasmid showed that <2 % of the total invertase activity was extracellular. The subcellular localization of BB-Inv was determined by indirect immunofluorescence microscopy using an antibody that recognizes the cytoplasmic domain of DPAP B (see Materials and Methods). Fig. 4 shows the staining pattern of wild type DPAP B (Fig. 4, A-C) and BB-Inv (Fig. 4 , G-I) when expressed from the high copy number (2#) plasmids, pGP3 (Roberts et al., 1989 ) and pCJR13, respectively. For these and the other 2# plasmid constructs used in this study, the proteins were overproduced 10-20-fold as determined by enzyme activity. Both DPAP B and BB-Inv were localized to the vacuolar membrane as judged by differential interference contrast (Nomarski) optics and co-localization with a marker for the vacuolar membrane, the 60-kD subunit of the vacuolar H+-ATPase (Vat2p; Yamashiro et al., 1990; Table  I ). DPAP B and BB-Inv were also localized to the vacuolar membrane when expressed from a single copy (CEN) plasmid (data not shown). Aside from the differences in signal intensity, no difference in subcellular localization was observed when BB-Inv was expressed from CEN or 2# plasmids. The results from the aFss-B and BB-Inv fusions indi-cate that, similar to ALP (Klionsky and Emr, 1990) , the lumenal domain of DPAP B is neither necessary nor sufficient for vacuolar targeting.",

No staining of the plasma membrane was observed for any of these proteins. Thus, the cytoplasmic and transmembrane domains of DPAP B are not necessary for targeting to the vacuolar membrane. A significant fraction of cells expressing A20-BB and A27-BB also showed some ER localization, as judged by staining of the perinuclear space and long cisternal compartments (Table I; Rose et al., 1989) , whereas B-A-B showed only vacuolar labeling. The z~20-BB and ~27-BB cells in Fig. 5 show predominantly vacuolar staining. In many cases, the plane of focus had to be adjusted to observe staining of both vacuolar and ER structures within a given cell. The increased residence time of A20-BB and A27-BB in the ER was corroborated by immunoblotting analysis, which showed that a small amount of the ER forms of A20-BB and A27-BB were seen in the steady state, along with the Golgi-modified forms, whereas only the Golgi-modified form was seen for wild type DPAP B (data not shown). The increased ER retention of A20-BB and A27-BB could be due to an impaired ability to achieve a native conformation competent for exiting the ER, as has been observed with mutant membrane proteins in mammalian cells (Gething et al., 1986; Doms et al., 1988) . Upon exiting the ER, however, A20-BB and A27-BB were transported through the Golgi complex to the vacuole, indicating that the cytoplasmic domain of DPAP B is not necessary for vacuolar localization. These results, combined with those from the analysis of eeFss-B, BB-Inv, and B-A-B, demonstrate that, aside from a membrane anchor, no single domain of DPAP B is required for transport to the vacuole. * For each construct, the percentages refer to the fraction of stained cells that exhibited staining of a particular organelle. Depending on the protein being monitored, some cells showed staining of more than one class of organdie; thus, the percentages for a given protein may add up to more than 100. w Vacuolar localization was determined both by coincidence of staining with the vacuole membrane as determined by Nomarski optics, and by co-localization with Vat2p.

The structural gene for DPAP A (STE23) has been cloned and sequenced (Julius et al., 1983 ; C. A. Flanagun, D. A. Barnes, M. C. Flessel, and J. Thorner, manuscript submitted for publication), and the predicted structure of DPAP A is similar to that of DPAP B in several regards. Both are type II integral membrane proteins, and both have lumenal enzymatic domains of ,x,800 residues that share a high degree of sequence identity, including 48 % identical residues over the COOH-terminal 250 residues (Fig. 1 A) ; however, there is no significant sequence similarity between the cytoplasmic and transmembrane domains of DPAP A and DPAP B. To assess the subcelhlar distribution of DPAP A, an antibody specific for DPAP A was generated (see Materials and Methods). The specificity of the antibody is demonst-rated in Fig. 6 . Immunoprecipitation of DPAP A was carried out with 35S-labeled cells that varied with regard to the dosage of the STE/3 gene. SDS-PAGE and fluorography showed that the antibody immunoprecipitated a protein of 112 kD from wild type cells but not from ste13A ceils, and that this polypeptide was overproduced ~20-fold in a strain containing the STE/3 gene on a 2t~ plasmid (Fig. 6 A) . A protein of *40 kD was also immunoprecipitated; however, the level of the 40-kD protein did not vary with the dosage of STE/3. The STE/3 DNA sequence predicts three possible sites for addition of N-linked carbohydrate (C. A. Flanagan, D. A. Barnes, M. C. Flessel, and J. Thorner, manuscript submitted for publication). Treatment of DPAP A with Endo H resulted in an ~,5 kD decrease in apparent molecular weight (Fig. 6 B) , suggesting that at least two of the three Asn-X-Ser/Thr sites of DPAP A were modified, assuming that the core oligosaccharides added were of the typical structure (Kukuruzinska et al., 1987) , and that the carbohydrate moieties were only slightly modified in the Golgi apparatus, as is the case for the glycosyl groups of Kex2p (Fuller et al., 1989a,b) and Kexlp (Cooper and Bussey, 1989) . The apparent molecular weight of deglycosylated DPAP A, 107 kD, is consistent with the molecular weight of DPAP A predicted from the STE13 DNA sequence, 107,200 D (C. A. Flanagan, D. A. Barnes, M. C. Flessel, andJ. Thorner, manuscript submired for publication).",

This signal was absent in a steI3A strain (Fig. 7 , A-C). This staining pattern is typical of the Golgi apparatus, as determined by the localization of Kex2p and Kexlp (A, Cooper and H. Bussey, manuscript submitted for publication). Attempts to localize DPAP A in cells containing only the chromosomal copy of STE/3 were unsuccessful due to the low abundance of the protein. Because the copy number of yeast 2/~ plasmids can vary from 10-40 copies/cell within a population (Rose and Broach, 1991) , the fluorescence signal corresponding to DPAP A when expressed from a 2# plasmid also varied from cell to cell, ranging from a weak signal to a very strong signal, whereas the intensity of the Vat2p signal was consistent from cell to cell. All of the cells that showed a signal with the DPAP A antibody displayed a Golgi-staining pattern (Fig. 7 , D-U; Table  I ); however, cells exhibiting a very strong signal, presumably due to a high dosage of the STE/3 gene, also showed vacuolar staining (5 % of the cells ofapep4-3 strain; Table I ). An example of this is shown in Fig. 7, (~ S, and U) . A single cell exhibiting a strong DPAP A signal is shown, and the signal stains both vacuolar and punctate non-vacuolar structures, as judged by co-localization with Vat2p. The percentage of cells showing vacuolar localization of DPAP A decreased significantly in an otherwise isogenic PEP4 strain, which contains the full complement of vacuolar proteases (I %; Table I) . Thus, cells producing high levels of DPAP A showed mislocalization of the protein to the vacuolar membrane, with the mislocalized protein degraded in a vacuolar proteasedependent fashion. DPAP enzyme assays on permeabilized and non-permeabilized cells expressing DPAP A from either CEN or 2g plasmids showed that ,088% of the total activity was intracellular; thus, it is possible that a small percentage of DPAP A is present at the cell surface, even though no plasma membrane staining was detected by indirect immunofluorescence, However, the apparent extraceUular DPAP A enzyme activity could in part be due to a small degree of cell lysis during the assay.",

As with DPAP A, all cells that showed a signal displayed a punctate staining pattern, and a subset of those cells that showed a strong signal also exhibited vacuolar localization (Table I ). An example is shown in Fig. 8 (A-C) for cells expressing AA-B. The cell in the bottom right corner shows a very intense fluorescein signal relative to the other cells in the panel, and clearly exhibits co-localization with Vat2p. Thus, as was seen for wild type DPAP A, overproduction of these proteins resulted in some mislocalization to the vacuole. These experiments demonstrate that the cytoplasmic domain of DPAP A is sufficient for the retention of an otherwise vacuolar membrane protein in punctate structures typical of the Golgi apparatus in S. cerevisiae. The cytoplasmic domain of DPAP A also has been shown to be sufficient for Golgi retention when fused to the transmembrane and lumenal domains of the vacuolar membrane protein ALP (S.

            "text": "We have previously shown that the transport of DPAP B to the vacuole does not involve delivery to the plasma membrane followed by endocytic targeting to the vacuole (Roberrs et al., 1989) . This was demonstrated by expressing DPAP B in a secl mutant, which at 34~ is blocked at a late stage of the secretory pathway and accumulates secretory vesicles Salminen et al., 1987) . To ad-dress the possibility that the mutant constructs analyzed in this study were mislocalized to the plasma membrane followed by rapid endocytic uptake to the vacuole, indirect immunofluorescence experiments were performed on BB-Inv, B-A-B, A20-BB, and/x22-AA-B expressed in a secl strain at 34~ As a positive control for accumulation in secretory vesicles, the localization of the fusion protein Fusl-LacZp was analyzed (Trueheart et al., 1987) . The FUS1 gene product is required for the breakdown of the cell walls after the fusion of a and ct cells during conjugation (McCaffrey et al., 1987; Trueheart et al., 1987) , and has been shown by protease treatment of whole yeast cells to be a plasma membrane protein (Trueheart and Fink, 1989) . The fusion protein Fusl-LacZp, consisting of the 254 NH2-terminal amino acids of Fuslp fused to the/acZ gene product (/3-galactosidase), has been shown by immunofluorescence microscopy to be localized to the plasma membrane after induction during mating (Trueheart et al., 1987) . For these experiments, the expression of these proteins was under the control of the inducible GAL/promoter (see Materials and Methods; Johnston and Davis, 1984) . Neither Fusl-LacZp, BB-Inv, B-A-B, or A20-BB showed any signal before addition of galactose (data not shown). Fig. 10 (A-F) shows that Fusl-LacZp was localized to the plasma membrane in a SEC \u00a7 strain after 2 h of induction at 34~ but accumulated intracellularly, presumably in secretory vesicles, in a secl strain under the same conditions. No colocalization with the vacuolar marker, ALP, was detected. Figure 10 . Immunolocalization in SEC* and secl strains. JHRY20-1A (SEC*) and SEY-5016 (secl) cells containing plasmids encoding Fusl-LacZp (pCJRll4) or B-A-B (pCJR79) under the control of the GAL/ promoter were grown to log phase in media containing raffinose, then shifted to 34~ at the same time that galactose was added to the cultures. After 2 h, the cells were fixed, spheroplasted, and prepared for immunofluorescence. Cells expressing Fusl-LacZp were stained with anti-/~-galactosidase mAb and anti-ALP polyclonal antibody, and were viewed using filter sets specific for fluorescein and rhodamine fluorescence, respectively. Cells expressing B-A-B were stained as in Fig. 5 . Typically, Fusl-LacZp accumulated in a large patch in the bud and bud neck region of budded cells, and near the cell periphery of unbudded cells. BB-Inv, B-A-B, and A20-BB were each localized to the vacuole under these conditions (e.g., Fig. 10 , G-l; Table II) , as defined by co-localization with Vat2p. The intraceUular, non-vacuolar signal occasionally observed for B-A-B (23 %; Table II ) was different from that of Fusl-LacZp, in that the signal looked reminiscent of the Golgi signal observed for DPAP A (data not shown). This was also observed for B-A-B in SEC \u00a7 cells at 34~ suggesting that the kinetics of delivery of this protein is slowed at elevated temperatures. The analysis of A22-AA-B in the secl strain was complicated by the fact that expression of the protein was leaky; ,~50% of the cells in the population showed a weak vacuolar staining pattern before galactose addition. However, addition of galactose to the culture after shifting the cells to 34~ resulted in '~90% of the cells exhibiting an intense vacuolar signal (data not shown). These data show that the BB-Inv, B-A-B, A20-BB, and A22-AA-B proteins are targeted directly from the Golgi apparatus to the vacuole without transient appearance at the cell surface; thus, these proteins follow the same route to the vacuole as wild type vacuolar membrane proteins (Roberts et al., 1989) .",

These results were unexpected, given that the targeting of soluble vacuolar proteins in yeast and soluble and membrane proteins of the lysosomes of animal cells require targeting information to prevent delivery to the cell surface (Vails et al., 1990; Kornfeld and Mellman, 1989; Williams and Fukuda, 1990; Machamer, 1991) .",

Whereas this result might appear to conflict with earlier published data on Kex2p, more recent analysis indicates that membrane-bound forms of Kex2p that fail to be retained in the Golgi are found in the vacuole rather than the plasma membrane, when these proteins are expressed at wild type or modestly elevated levels (C.

Alternatively, one could argue that, given the similarity between DPAP B and DPAP A, both proteins could contain vacuolar targeting information in their transmembrane domains, even though no significant similarity is apparent from the amino acid sequence data (C. A. Flanagan, 13. A. Barnes, M. C. Flessel, and J. Thorner, manuscript submitted for publication). Mutations in the Golgi retention signal of DPAP A, or saturation of the retention apparatus, would then result in the delivery of DPAP A to the vacuole. This model requires that both Kex2p and Kexlp must also have cryptic vacuolar targeting signals. With regard to the cryptic vacuolar targeting signal model, we have found that replacement of the membrane spanning domains of DPAP A and A22-AAA with a 21 residue hydrophobic sequence, L(LALV)~, creating the proteins AXA and A22-AXA, results in the retention of AXA in the Golgi and the transport of A22-AXA to the vacuole (S. Nothwehr and T. Stevens, unpublished data). These data suggest that the transmembrane domain of DPAP A does not contain vacuolar targeting information, and thus support the vacuolar default model. The vacuolar default model is directly testable by analyzing potential localization signals of yeast plasma membrane proteins.",

It is possible that the majority of DPAP A and a significant percentage of Kex2p are missorted to the vacuole in cells lacking clathrin heavy chain. Mutations in clathrin may affect both the retention of Golgi membrane proteins and the functional integrity of the sorting pathway (Seeger and Payne, 1992b) .

There is no clear evidence for the existence of such a pathway in yeast or animal cells. However, several cases have been described in animal cells in which non-lysosomal membrane proteins were transported to lysosomes, either due to mutations (Armstrong et al., 1990) , or in the case of the heptameric T-cell antigen receptor, complexes lacking the ~\" subunit are degraded in lysosomes (Minami et al., 1987) . In these cases, the proteins were transported through the Golgi apparatus, and it is unclear whether the proteins were transported to lysosomes by a \"garbage\" pathway, or by the uncovering of a cryptic lysosomal targeting signal. In the great majority of cases, mislocalized membrane proteins of the secretory pathway in animal cells accumulate at the plasma membrane, which is presumed to be the default destination for these proteins (e.g., Williams and Fukuda, 1990) . It is well established that proteins that are slow to reach the folded state are retained in the ER due to the action of proteins such as BiP (Pelham, 1989; Rothman, 1989) , and proteins that are unable to fold or oligomerize properly are degraded in the ER (Klausner and Sitia, 1990) . Several of the proteins analyzed in this study (i.e., A20-BB, A27-BB, A22-AAA, and A22-AA-B) showed increased retention in the ER. However, all of these proteins eventually exited the ER, were enzymatically active, and were transported through the Golgi complex to the vacuole.",

            "text": "The 22-amino acid segment of the cytoplasmic domain of DPAP A presumably contains the recognition domain for a \"retention protein\" of the Golgi apparatus. This protein could be a permanent resident of the Golgi apparatus; alternatively, the \"retention protein\" could reside in a post-Golgi compartment and function as a salvage receptor, such as the proposed receptor for soluble ER proteins (Pelham, 1989) . It is interesting to note that the 22-amino acid stretch identified as the DPAP A Golgi retention signal contains five phenylalanine residues (Fig. 1) . In animal cells, one or more aromatic amino acids in the cytoplasmic domains of cell surface receptors have been shown to comprise part of the signal for the clustering into coated pit regions of the plasma membrane (Chen et al., 1990; Johnson et al., 1990; Lobel et al., 1989; McGraw et al., 1991) . That the phenylalanine residues in the A22 region may play a direct role in Golgi retention is supported by the observation that mutations in just two of these residues result in a substantial level of missorting of DPAP A to the vacuole (S. Nothwehr and T. Stevens, unpublished data) .",

However, in polarized epithelial ceils, it remains unclear which membrane serves as the default destination for membrane proteins (Simons and Wandinger-Ness, 1990; Mostov et al., 1992) . Even if the default compartments for membrane proteins of the secretory pathways of yeast and certain animal cells are different, the same mechanistic considerations apply, that is, positive sorting information is required for proteins to avoid delivery to the default compartment.",

The two proteins are diagrammed as rectangles, with the NH2 termini at the left, the solid black portions representing the transmembrane domains, and the percentages of identical residues indicated above. DPAP B and DPAP A are predicted to contain 841 and 931 amino acids, respectively. The amino acid sequence of the cytoplasmic domain of DPAP A is indicated in the one letter amino acid code, and the boxed residues are removed by the A22-AAA mutation (see below). (B) Constructs used in the analysis of the sorting signal of DPAP B. Each construct is represented as a rectangle spanning a lipid bilayer, with the NH2 terminus on the left protruding into the cytoplasm. The different domains of each construct are given a letter depending on their origin (either DPAP A or DPAP B). The details of the constructions are given in Materials and Methods.
