These self-assembling polypeptide nanoparticles (SAPNs) are composed of linear peptide (LP) monomers which contain two coiled-coil oligomerization domains, the dense granule 7 (GRA7 20-28 LPQFATAAT) peptide and a universal CD4 + T cell epitope (derived from PADRE). Purified LPs assemble into nanoparticles with icosahedral symmetry, similar to the capsids of small viruses. These particles were evaluated for their efficacy in eliciting IFN-\u03b3 by splenocytes of HLA-B*0702 transgenic mice and for their ability to protect against subsequent T. gondii challenge. This work demonstrates the feasibility of using this platform approach with a CD8 + epitope that binds HLA-B7 and tests the biological activity of potentially protective peptides restricted by human major histocompatibility complex (HLA) class I molecules in HLA transgenic mice.",

They are self adjuvanting and have been successful in the induction of immune responses without additional adjuvants [3, 4, 5, 6] . However, until now, an analogous nanoparticle-based vaccine has not yet been developed to prevent toxoplasmosis. Using self-adjuvanting nanoparticles in vaccines is promising because adjuvants have proven to be difficult to develop and manufacture, as they are limited by many factors such as toxicity, biodegradability, expenses, individual immunogenicity, and lack of interaction with the antigen itself [7] . Considerable effort has been made to identify promising vaccine candidate antigens for T. gondii. To date, these candidates include surface antigens (SAG), dense granule antigens (GRA), rhoptry proteins (ROP) and microneme proteins (MIC). Among them, GRA7 is a potent antigen expressed in all infectious stages of T. gondii [8] . It can trigger significant humoral and cellular immune responses against toxoplasmosis [9, 10] . Our previous findings identified the T. gondii HLA-B*0702-restricted GRA7 20-28 (LPQFATAAT) peptide as one that confers protection against toxoplasmosis [10] . In conjunction with an universal CD4 + T cell epitope (PADRE) and adjuvant (a specially formulated TLR4 agonist called GLA-SE [11] ), GRA7 peptide elicits IFN-\u03b3 from CD8 + T cells and controls parasite burden in HLA-B*0702 transgenic mice [12, 13] .",

A 1-liter culture of E. coli was grown to an A 600 of 0.6, and protein expression was induced by addition of isopropyl-\u03b2-Dthiogalactopyranoside (1mM final concentration). Recombinant protein was extracted under native conditions by using the BugBuster protein extraction reagent (Novagen, 6 ml/g of cell pellet) containing a protease inhibitor mix (Roche Diagnostics) and 10 ug/ml lysozyme. All purification steps were done under 8M urea denaturing conditions. The His-tagged LPs were purified by using nickel-affinity chromatography and followed by Q-Sepharose. The eluate which contains 8M urea was dialyzed against a buffer containing 5 mM Hepes-KOH (pH 7.8) and 0.5 mM DTT. Upon removal of the denaturant the LPs self-assemble to form nanoparticles which were stored at 4\u00b0C. The purity of the recombinant LP was determined by SDS-PAGE, and the protein concentration was measured by the method of Bradford using BSA as a standard.",

            "text": "The inclusion of PADRE, a synthetic peptide that binds promiscuously to variants of the human MHC class II molecule DR and is effective in mice, also augments CD8 + T cell effector functions by producing IL2 which augments induction of CD4 + T helper cells [24, 25] . Both CD4 + and CD8 + epitopes are important components in the formulation of successful vaccines by driving a protective response [26] . Adjuvants also contribute to the success of vaccination. Our recent studies show GLA-SE, a specially formulated Toll like receptor 4 (TLR4) agonist, is very effective as an adjuvant providing CD8 + T cells producing IFN-\u03b3 when used for immunizations against T. gondii in mice [10, 27] .",

The nanoparticles are small \u223c 38nm in diameter, and contain strong hydrophobic oligomerization domains that drive self-assembly of the monomer proteins.

Our data showed that HLA-B*07 mice immunized with the nanoparticles elicit protective immune responses against T. gondii infection. Consistent with former studies, mice immunized with the linked peptides in particles (PADRE and GRA7) elicit higher IFN-\u03b3 production than mice immunized with single PADRE and GRA7 peptides in saline . We have also found that the particles without these peptides (control SAPN) are not immunogenic by themselves and did not contribute to significant immune responses. In the GRA7 20-28 SAPN, the contribution of GRA7 20-28 induction of CD8 + to produce IFN-\u03b3 is significantly increased but still not high (Fig 2A, B) . PADRE contributes to production of more IFN-\u03b3 response on the IFN-\u03b3 ELISpot assay (Fig 2B) . This work indicates that PADRE is an effective CD4 + Th epitope that contributes to the peptide construct. This is in correlation with our previous studies that showed GRA7 peptide in combination with PADRE and the adjuvant GLA-SE elicits IFN-\u03b3 in splenocytes of HLA-B*0702 [10] . Challenges with the type II parasites in HLA-B*0702 mice demonstrated a 54% reduction from a mean of 335 to 155 cysts per brain [10] . In this current study, our data using GRA7 20-28 nanoparticles showed a 72% reduction from a mean of 685 to 192 cysts. Thus, GRA7 [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] SAPNs are capable of more protection against type II T. gondii strains.",
