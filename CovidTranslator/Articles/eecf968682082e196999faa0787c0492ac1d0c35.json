To examine the possibility of structural or morphological differences of virus particles with different buoyant densities, a discontinuous sucrose density gradient was used to separate the virus into four distinct peaks (Fig. 2) . Fractions containing the four peaks were taken and recentrifuged on discontinuous gradients to give clean preparations of each peak. The densest peak could be separated into two distinct peaks at this stage (Fig. 3) . Although this was a consistent finding, the amount of material involved in the denser of the two peaks (V) was related to the length of time the virus was stored at temperatures other than --60 \u00b0 C. Material from each of the five separated peaks was centrifuged on a continuous sucrose density gradient for 16 hours at 80,000 X g. The results obtained are shown in Figure 4 (a--e).

Although it could be shown that infectivity, complement fixing (CF) activity and 31t-uridine were associated with all five peaks, titres of infectivity and CF activity were very low. Much higher levels were obtMned if the second discontinuous density gradient step in the separation of the peaks was omitted although this meant that peaks IV and V were not separated. Typical results are shown in Table t. Some differences in the levels of the activities associated with each peak were detected, in particular I and IV/V showed relatively low levels of CF activity per mg protein but high levels of associated SH-uridine. Comparison of CF aetivity/mg protein in allantoic fluid with peaks II and III from the sucrose density gradients suggest that the virus has been purified more than 400-fold relative to protein. Negative-stain electron microscopy reveMed several differences in the morphology of the material in each peak (Fig. 5) . Peak I consisted of pleomorphic virus particles which were frequently seen as elongated filamentous forms. Filamentous virus particles also formed a small proportion of the virus populations seen in eleetronmierographs of peak III but were rarely seen in peak II, which consisted mainly of regular spherical virus particles. Peak IV consisted of particles similar in morphology to those of peak III but with a much larger size range, occasionally very large particles were seen in this peak. Peak V consisted mainly of amorphous material although clumps of large particles were also present. The amorphous material was usually in large aggregates but occasionally individual pieces were seen which, although lacking marked structural definition, were distinctive in appearance (Fig. 5e inset) . The mean diameters of the virus particles in each peak were: I: l13:k23nm, I I : 97:J:19nm, I I I : 1 1 2~2 4 n m , IV: 1 2 2 \u00b1 2 2 n m , V: 1 8 2 \u00b1 7 0 nm. In each peak particles that possessed projections could be seen (Fig. 5a--e) . These projections were unlike those usually associated with coronaviruses and rarely formed a complete corona. However, the presence of projections is in contrast with the work of HA~KN~SS and BRACEW~LL (1974) who reported the absence of projections on virions of this strain of IBV.",

Use of discontinuous density gradients resolved the virus material into five distinct peaks, all retaining infectivity and CF activity. HOSAKA st g/. (1966) obtained similar results with Sendai virus, but were able to show, on a morphological basis, that the variations in density were directly related to the RNA content of the different particles. If the 3H-uridine activity associated with the density gradient peaks was representative of virus I~NA, our results suggest that the differences in density of IBV particles are not related to differences in R]XA content. Although the densest peak IV/V had four times the amount of SH-uridine cpm per CF unit compared to peaks II and III, peak I, the least dense, had an equally high epm/CF units ratio. It, seems possible, due to the presence of amorphous material and high nucleic acid to protein and CF activity ratios, that peak V, the densest peak, consists of internal virus material from disrupted particles plus very large intact virus particles--these particles could contain more than one genome. In contrast, peaks I~V consisted of apparently whole infectious virus particles. Additional evidence that the amorphous material may be ribonucleoprotein or similar virus material is the morphological resemblence to the ribonucleoprotein of some oncornaviruses (BonoG~SI et al., 1973) .",

Any assessment of freedom from contaminating cellular material is difficult with a virus as labile as IBV. Populations of coronaviruses have physical to infective particle ratios which may be as high as 104 (J. D. AL~EIDA, quoted by BRADBUR~E, 1972) , for this reason we have used CF units rather than infectivity to give a more realistic comparison of the virus purity.

BEm~Y and ALMEDIA (1968) demonstrated by electron microscopic examination of virus-antibody-complement interactions that the envelopes of IBV particles were derived from the host cell. It is probable that the corona.viruses, like other envelope viruses have a lipid composition resembling that of the host membrane from which they bud (KLENK and CHOPPIN, 1969, RE~'~ONEX et al., 1971 ) and therefore like Newcastle disease virus (STEa-]~CK and ])UI~AND t963) would be expected to exhibit host specific differences in buoyant density. If this is the ease then two possibilities may exist. Firstly, IBV virions budding from the membranes of different organetles may possess the quMitative and quantitative differences in lipid composition seen in these membranes (gocsnn et al., 1968) . Secondly, IBV grown in the embryonated egg may be produced by budding from the endoplasmie retieulum of cells from more than one organ or tissue. Analytical studies of the tipids from the endoplasmic retieulum of different organs have clearly demonstrated marked variations in composition (I~ovsE~ et al., 1968) . In this respect it is interesting to note that the density distribution of the eoronavirus OC43 which had been adapted to a single organ, the suckling mouse brain, extended only over the range 1.18--1.20 g/cm 3 on continuous sucrose gradients (KA\u00a5]s et al., 1970) .",

            "text": "Our results suggest that four major and ten minor polypeptides are associated with IBV virions. This compares favourably with the 16 polypeptides detected in preparations of this virus by BI~I[A~ (personal communication). If both the major and minor polypeptides represent the structural polypeptidcs of the virus, then IBV is unlike coronavirus 0C43 which has been reported to contain only 6 or 7 polypeptides (HIERItOLZER et al., 1972) . Although the apparent IBV ~structural proteins are within the approximate coding capacity of the large genome suggested for IBV by W~TKINS et al. (1975) , it seems more probable that, unlike the paramyxoviruses, IBV virions incorporate host polypeptides as well as lipids [the work of BEan~ and AZ~EID~ (1968) suggests that IBV has a host-derived lipoprotein membrane], or host material becomes closely bound to the virus particles. Either case may account for some, or all, of the minor polypeptides seen in ~his study.",
