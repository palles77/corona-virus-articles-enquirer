            "text": "Coronaviruses are a large group of enveloped, lipid containing, RNA viruses which are characterised by their distinctive projection morphology [ 1 ] . There have been extensive reports describing the morphology of the virion both in thin sections of infected cells and by the negative staining technique [2] . Although several members of this group have been characterized biochemically [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] little is known about the morphology of the internal component. Apostolov and Flewett [8] observed 7-8 nm threads in thin sections of pelleted preparations of avian infectious bronchitis virus and Kennedy and Johnson-Lussenburg [9] isolated the internal component of the human respiratory coronavirus 229E and described its morphology from negatively stained preparations. However, Macnaughton et al. [10] recently described the morphology following negative staining of ribonucleoprotein (RNP)-like structures in their preparations of 229E virus which were clearly dissimilar, both in diameter and appearance to those previously reported [9] . Nucleocapsid-like structures, 9 nm in diameter, have been observed in thin sections of organ cultures infected with the human enteric coronavirus [11 ] . However, before attempting further characterisation of this nucleocapsid-like structure and in view of the conflicting reports of the internal component of 229E virus, we have further examined the internal component of the human coronavirus 229E. This paper presents new evidence on the morphology of its nucleocapsid.",

The structures released by detergent treatment of intact purified virus superficially resembled paramyxovirus nucleocapsids in their overall morphology. However, these nucleocapsid-like structures were significantly smaller in diameter and the appearance of the subunit structure differed from the classical \"herring bone\" appearance of paramyxovirus nucleocapsids Fig. 5b [14] . The density of 1.27 g/cm a in sucrose for these nucleocapsid-like structures is within the range of reported densities for the nucleocapsids of other large RNA viruses [15] .",

The differences between the morphology of the previously described structures and those reported here could be explained by the electron microscopical preparative procedures used. The finding of the nucleocapsid-like structures in close association with densely staining filaments could account for the observation of these nucleocapsid-like structures at the lighter density of 1.24 g/cm a. The association of protein with the RNP of other coronaviruses has been reported [16, 17] .",
