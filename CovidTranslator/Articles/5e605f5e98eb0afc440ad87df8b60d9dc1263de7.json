The novel virus shared a maximum of 50% amino acid sequence identity within the VP6 gene to currently known members of the genus.

For example, a bat strain from Kenya had an unusual VP1 gene and the hypothesis arose that during their evolution mammalian RVs belonging to different RV species may share genes by reassortment (Esona et al., 2010) . Furthermore, bats seem to serve as reservoirs of multiple RVA genotypes commonly found in heterologous host species. Consequently, batborne RVAs might pose some veterinary and public health risk (Asano et al., 2016; He et al., 2013; Xia et al., 2014) . More recent data indicate that in addition to RVA, RVH may also infect bats (Kim et al., 2016) .",

Colonies of M. schreibersii are usually large and dense so that members of the colony can save energy during the hibernation period. These bats may roost together with Rhinolophus ferrumequinum, Rhinolophus euryale, Myotis myotis, Myotis blythii, and Myotis emarginatus. M. schreibersii is able to fly large distances (N500 km) from one roost to another (Hutterer et al., 2005) . Overall, these colonial and behavioral characteristics of M. schreibersii may notably influence pathogen dissemination that could lead to high prevalence and maintenance of viruses within colonies (Kemenesi et al., 2014) .",

Nucleic acid samples were previously denatured at 97\u00b0C for 5 min in the presence of 10 \u03bcM random hexamer tailed by a common PCR primer sequence (Djikeng et al., 2008) . Reverse transcription was performed with 1 U AMV reverse transcriptase (Promega), 400 \u03bcM dNTP mixture, and 1\u00d7 AMV RT buffer (composition at 1 \u00d7 concentration; 50 mM Tris-HCl [pH 8.3], 50 mM KCl, 10 mM MgCl 2 , 0.5 mM spermidine and 10 mM DTT) at 42\u00b0C for 45 min following a 5 min incubation at room temperature. Then, 5 \u03bcL cDNA was added to 45 \u03bcL PCR mixture to obtain a final volume of 50 \u03bcL and a concentration of 500 \u03bcM for the PCR primer (Djikeng et al., 2008) , 200 \u03bcM for dNTP mixture, 1.5 mM MgCl 2 , 1 \u00d7 Taq DNA polymerase buffer, and 0.5 U of Taq DNA polymerase (Thermo Scientific). The reaction conditions consisted of an initial denaturation step at 95\u00b0C for 3 min, followed by 40 cycles of amplification (95\u00b0C for 30 s, 48\u00b0C for 30 s, 72\u00b0C for 2 min) and terminated at 72\u00b0C for 8 min. 0.1 \u03bcg of cDNA was subjected to enzymatic fragmentation and adaptor ligation following the manufacturers recommendations (available at www.neb.com; NEBNext\u00ae Fast DNA Fragmentation & Library Prep Set for Ion Torrent\u2122 kit, New England Biolabs). The barcoded adaptors were retrieved from the KAPA Adaptor Kits for Ion Torrent Platforms (Kapa Biosystems). The resulting cDNA libraries were measured on a Qubit\u00ae 2.0 equipment using the Qubit\u00ae dsDNA BR Assay kit (Invitrogen). The emulsion PCR that produced clonally amplified libraries was carried out according to the manufacturer's protocol using the Ion PGM Template kit on an OneTouch v2 instrument (Life Technologies). Enrichment of the templated beads (on an Ion One Touch ES machine, Life Technologies) and further steps of pre-sequencing set-up were performed according to the 200 bp protocol of the manufacturer. The sequencing protocol recommended for Ion Torrent PGM Sequencing Kit on a 316 chip was strictly followed (Life Technologies).",

In these samples various amounts of sequence reads mapped onto known eukaryotic viral sequences (range, \u226a 0.1% to 0.9%; Fig. 1 ). When evaluating the results of viral metagenomics data we need to point out that sample processing did not include virion enrichment step and it is not clear whether each of the relevant sequence reads originate from intact virions. Consequently, the presence of potential endogenous viral sequence elements may have affected the overall landscape of viral diversity. For example retrovirus specific reads, which may represent endogenous viral genomic traits from genomic DNA of the host species, were detected in all samples. Overall the rate of eukaryotic virus specific sequence reads was low, likely because we omitted virus particle enrichment procedures in our sample processing protocol. Nonetheless, various eukaryotic viruses were detected in all six selected fecal samples. Herpesvirus, astrovirus and coronavirus sequences were detected in at least three samples (herpesvirus in sample 1, 3, and 4; astrovirus in sample 1 to 3; coronavirus in sample 4 to 6). Rotavirus and gemycircularvirus sequences were found in two and one samples, respectively (both viruses in sample 1; rotavirus without gemycircularvirus in sample 6). In one specimen (i.e. sample 6) RV sequences were the most abundant genomic representatives (98.5%); however, these sequence reads were distributed among various RV species (incl. RVB, RVG, RVH and RVI). To clarify this ambiguous situation, the library DNA that contained the most abundant RV-specific reads was resequenced at a greater sequencing depth. The resulting N 1.3 Million sequence reads were subjected to de novo assembly.",

With this approach we found the equivalents of the major structural (VP1 to VP4, VP6 and VP7) and non-structural (NSP1 to NSP5) proteins of RVs (Tables 2 and 3 ). The encoded structural and non-structural proteins were assigned to particular RNA segments based on the size of full-length genome segments. Additional putative ORFs were predicted to be encoded on segments coding for VP6 and NSP5; however, these putative proteins shared no conserved protein motifs with those of known from other rotavirus species.",

One exception was found when analyzing the NSP4 tree, where the limited bootstrap support at the deepest nodes prevented the separation of the two major RV clades (Fig. 2) . Consistent with the phylogenetic analyses, the greatest nucleotide and amino acid sequence identities for the novel batborne RV were seen when compared to reference RVH strains (range, 41 (nt%) and 14 (aa%) for NSP4; 63 (nt%) and 64 (aa%) for VP1) (Table 4) .",

In this analysis, again, BO4351/Ms/2014 was most closely related to the major genetic lineage containing RVH strains (49-50%, aa) and showed lower similarity to other clade 2 RVs (RVB, 39%, RVG, 39%). The genetic relationship of BO4351/Ms/2014 to clade 1 RVs was marginal (max. identity with RVC, 17%) (Fig. 4, Table 4 ). Thus, applying the official species demarcation sequence cut-off value, which is 53% identity at the amino acid level, we conclude that the novel batborne RV strain represents a new RV species, tentatively called Rotavirus J (RVJ). The reference strain was therefore designated as RVJ/Bat-wt/SRB/BO4351/Ms/ 2014/G1P1.",

By adapting the nested PCR assay that amplified a 338 bp long fragment (spanning nucleotide position 137 to 474), another four stool samples were found to be positive for RVJ. All PCR products obtained in the 2nd round PCR were bidirectionally sequenced. The low sequence variation within these short segments (data not shown) suggested the presence of the same virus strain within the colony. Notably, given that RVs have been detected exclusively in birds and mammals, the data presented here suggests that bats may be a true host species of RVJ, although further studies are required to confirm this hypothesis. It is important to note that by morphological examination all tested animals were confirmed as adult specimens. Immune competence and pathogenicity need to be clarified for most viruses harbored by bats, although asymptomatic virus shedding seems to be common. Further studies are needed to clarify the pathogenicity, prevalence and effect of the virus on bat colonies. Since bats seems to possess special immune characteristics , these features may contribute to an altered response to rotavirus infection and explain the high rate of fecal virus shedding in adult M. schreibersii specimens.",
