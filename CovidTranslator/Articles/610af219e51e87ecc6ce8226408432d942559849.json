One can regard an acute infection as a race between the ability of the virus to replicate, spread in the body, and cause disease, and the ability of the host to restrict and control these events. A highly virulent strain of virus is less lethal for a highly resistant animal than for a susceptible animal; con versely, a relatively avirulent strain of virus may be lethal for an un usually susceptible animal.",

The dose of infect ing virus may be influential, but this is by no means the only factor. Both genetic and physiological factors can influence the outcome of exposure to a virus.",

There are many of these genes, most of them situated in the region known as the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) (see Chapter 9). Most other genetic determinants of virus sus ceptibility are not directly related to the immune response and map outside the MHC locus. Individuals with a genetically determined poor immune response to neutralizing epitopes on the surface proteins of a given virus would presumably have difficulty in controlling infection with that particular virus. In the mouse at least, absence of a specific response is generally recessive. Susceptibility of mice to infection with cytomegaloviruses, retroviruses, and lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus has been shown to be linked to particular MHC genotypes. Some breeds of domestic animals (e.g., sheep) are so inbred that particular viral susceptibility and resistance patterns have been found to be associ ated with specific immune responsiveness patterns.",

Most domes tic animals are reasonably mature immunologically at the time of birth, but still very susceptible to infection with those viruses against which their dam has no antibody.

The most telling evidence that interferon can indeed be instrumental in de ciding the outcome of a natural viral infection is that mice infected with any of several nonlethal viruses, or with sublethal doses of more vir ulent viruses, die if antiinterferon serum is administered. In general, however, we know very little about the relative importance of the vari ous interferons. While it is widely postulated that interferons constitute the first line of defense in the process of recovery from viral infections, it would be naive to believe that they are the only, or even the most important factor. If this were so, one might expect that a systemic infec tion with any virus, or indeed, immunization with a live vaccine, might protect an animal, for a period at least, against challenge with an unre lated virus. While some experimental data suggest that this may occur, the phenomenon cannot be generally demonstrated. Evidence is some what stronger that infection of the upper respiratory tract with one virus will provide temporary local protection against others. Perhaps this dis tinction provides the clue; the direct antiviral effect of interferons is limited in both time and space. Their main antiviral role may be to protect cells in the immediate vicinity of the initial focus of infection.",
