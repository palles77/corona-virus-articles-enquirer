A recent outbreak of pneumonia in Wuhan, China declared in December 12 th 2019 led to the isolation and identification of a new human coronavirus, 2019-nCoV (SARS-CoV-2), as the responsible agent of this new acute respiratory syndrome 3 . Since, SARS-CoV-2 and the Coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) have spread to more than 200 countries and territories worldwide affecting more than 600,000 people (laboratory-confirmed cases) from which around 28,000 have died by COVID-19 4 . As such, the WHO declared COVID-19 outbreak as a pandemic on March 11 th 2020 5 . Given the rapid spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and that an important fraction of the infected individuals remains asymptomatic but still spread the virus 6 , rapid and extensive diagnosis together with the isolation of infected individuals remains as one of the most powerful ways to avoid the spread of new COVID-19 cases. There are several RT-qPCR protocols from different countries that are currently approved by the WHO in order to detect SARS-CoV-2 7 . However, one of the limiting steps of such protocols is RNA extraction from clinical samples, which is currently performed by the use of a limited quantity of approved RNA extraction kits.

In this sense, it was recently reported that the detection of SARS-CoV-2 by RT-qPCR from a mixed sample could be achieved with non-approved kits but also in the absence of an RNA extraction process 10 . Here, we have extended these preliminary observations by using an RNA extraction-free SARS-CoV-2 detection protocol from nasopharyngeal swab samples from two COVID-19 diagnosed individuals using two commercially available and broadly used RT-qPCR kits. Our data indicate that RNA extraction can be omitted from the protocol at least with one of the tested kits allowing the rapid and reliable detection of SARS-CoV-2 directly from nasopharyngeal swabs samples.",

FLOQswabs (Copan Diagnostics Inc) containing the nasopharyngeal samples were added to a 4 ml tube containing 3 ml of UTM-RT mini transport media (Copan Diagnostics Inc). A volume of 5 \u00b5l of the NSS was used to perform the RT-qPCR detection using the TaqMan\u2122 2019-nCoV Assay Kit v1 (ThermoFisher) and the 2019-nCoV CDC qPCR Probe Assay (Integrated DNA Technologies). RT-qPCR detections using 5 \u00b5l of RNA extracted with the QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen) were processed in parallel in order to perform comparisons. In both cases, the cycling protocol recommended by each supplier was used in the QuantStudio3 Real Time PCR System (Thermo Fisher Scientific) using the samples obtained from the two COVID-19 positive individuals, the positive control provided by each kit together with SARS-CoV-2-free RNA obtained from human embryonic kidney (HEK293T) cells, which was used as a negative control. We first tested the suitability of the TaqMan\u2122 2019-nCoV Assay Kit v1 to detect the SARS-CoV-2 genes Orf1ab, S and N ( Fig. 1A and Table 1 ). We observed that the three viral genes were readily detected in the NSS of both COVID-19 positive samples and the positive control but not in RNA from HEK293T cells. Interestingly, detection of SARS-CoV-2 genes from the NSS was as efficient as RNA samples extracted with the QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit with differences between 1 to 5 Ct values depending on the viral gene and the sample (Fig. 1A and Table 1 ). These results strongly indicate that the TaqMan\u2122 2019-nCoV Assay Kit v1 from Thermo Fisher Scientific is fully compatible with the direct use of NSS without any RNA extraction step. We then wanted to know whether these observations were extrapolable to the 2019-nCoV CDC qPCR Probe Assay (Fig. 1B and Table 1 ). As observed, although we were able to detect the SARS-CoV-2 N gene from the NSS using the N1 and N2 probes provided by the kit, our data indicate that this kit is much more performant using RNA extracted samples. This observation was more evident with the N2 probe, in which we observed a difference of 13 Ct values between the NSS and the RNA extracted samples from both patients (Fig. 1B and Table 1 ).",
