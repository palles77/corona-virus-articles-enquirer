            "text": "Next-generation sequencing has been used in numerous investigations to characterize and quantify the genetic diversity of a virus sample through the mapping of polymorphisms and measurement of mutation frequencies. Next-generation sequencing has also been employed to identify recombination events occurring within the genomes of higher organisms, for example, detecting alternative RNA splicing events and oncogenic chromosomal rearrangements. Here, we combine these two approaches to profile RNA recombination within the encapsidated genome of a eukaryotic RNA virus, flock house virus. We detect hundreds of thousands of recombination events, with single-nucleotide resolution, which result in diversity in the encapsidated genome rivaling that due to mismatch mutation. We detect previously identified defective RNAs as well as many other abundant and novel defective RNAs. Our approach is exceptionally sensitive and unbiased and requires no prior knowledge beyond the virus genome sequence. RNA recombination is a powerful driving force behind the evolution and adaptation of RNA viruses. The strategy implemented here is widely applicable and provides a highly detailed description of the complex mutational landscape of the transmissible viral genome.",

            "text": "Recombination within RNA viral genomes is a powerful driving force behind the evolution of RNA viruses and has been widely documented in bacterial, plant, and animal viruses (for a review, see Ref. 1) . There are two possible models for RNA recombination: non-replicative or breakage rejoining 2,3 and copy-choice recombination. 4, 5 Breakage rejoining mechanisms are similar to that occurring during mRNA splicing and involve a catalytic ligation of two RNA molecules. During copy-choice recombination, RNA replication is halted mid-flow and the template RNA dissociates. The nascent RNA remains associated with its polymerase, however, and is able to re-prime replication either at a new position on the original template or on a new template strand. Copy-choice recombination is thought to be the most common mechanism for RNA recombination in many RNA viruses and is thought to primarily occur during the synthesis of the negative-sense RNA strand from the positivesense RNA genome. 6, 7 RNA recombination may be advantageous to viruses through a variety of proposed mechanisms including the generation of viral escape mutants, the removal of deleterious mutations, the mating of viral genes and genomes, or the capturing of other viral or host genes. As a consequence, RNA recombination contributes to the extraordinary and rapid adaptability of RNA viruses and has been attributed to be the source of a number of recent outbreaks of, for example, dengue virus and echovirus [8] [9] [10] as well as the emergence of entirely new viruses, including severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus. 11 Conversely, viral RNA recombination may also facilitate the stepwise generation of defective RNAs. 12 Defective RNAs have lost their ability to independently encode functional viral proteins but maintain the sequence motifs required for RNA replication by the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and so are able to proliferate parasitically. Additionally, defective RNAs are often packaged into viral particles and so may contain the necessary motifs required for encapsidation. If a defective RNA is able to attenuate the replication of the full-length RNA genome through competition for access to the RdRp, then they are known as defective-interfering RNAs (DI-RNAs). 13 DI-RNAs arise during both persistent and acute infections most commonly in cell culture 14, 15 but also occur during wild infections. 16, 17 Flock house virus (FHV) is an icosahedral T =3 non-enveloped virus containing a positive-sense, single-stranded RNA genome. It is the prototypic member of the Nodaviridae family and provides an important model for the study of many pathogenic human viruses including poliovirus, human rhinovirus, and hepatitis C virus (reviewed in Refs. 18 and 19) . FHV naturally infects insects including Drosophila melanogaster as well as medically important insects such as mosquitoes (including Anopheles gambiae) and the tsetse fly. 20 The FHV genome consists of two positive-sense, single-stranded RNAs. RNA1 (3.1 kb) encodes the RdRp, which can autonomously replicate the FHV genome. RNA2 (1.4 kb) encodes the capsid precursor protein, \u03b1, 180 copies of which form the viral capsid. FHV packages one copy each of RNA1 and RNA2, but on average, nearly 2% of the packaged RNA is derived from transcripts of the host genome. 21 Additionally, virus-like particles (VLPs) of FHV can be made in cell culture by expressing the single capsid protein from a baculoviral vector in Sf21 cells. 22 VLPs spontaneously assemble into particles that are closely similar to native FHV, except that they package ribosomal RNAs, transcripts derived from the baculoviral expression vector and other cellular RNAs. 21 Next-generation sequencing (NGS) has been used in multiple investigations to assess the polymorphism and mutation frequency within a viral genome, for example, in human immunodeficiency virus, 23 human rhinovirus, 24 and foot-and-mouth disease virus. 25 With NGS technology, it is possible to detect fusion events that may occur during RNA/DNA recombination and has been used to characterize mRNA splicing events 26 and to identify oncogenic chromosomal rearrangements. [27] [28] [29] Here, we use NGS to investigate the sequence variation as a result of RNA recombination within the genome encapsidated by FHV. We profile with single-nucleotide resolution hundreds of thousands of recombination events that have occurred during FHV genome replication and which have subsequently been encapsidated into virus particles.",

We have previously thoroughly characterized the contents of FHV virions and VLPs and so used these sequences as references here. 21 Reads were mapped in an endto-end and un-gapped manner. The number of mapped reads for both data sets is shown in Table 1 . FHV virions packaged roughly equal stoichiometric amounts of FHV RNA1 and RNA2. Out of the 24.6 millions reads that aligned to the FHV genome, only 4 of these mapped to the negativesense RNA transcript. In addition to the FHV genome, we also detected some encapsidated host RNA, as we have recently reported. 21 VLPs primarily packaged host RNA, most of which consisted of ribosomal RNA. VLPs also packaged transcripts from the baculoviral expression vector, which included the FHV RNA2 gene encoding the FHV capsid protein. We also detected a small amount of FHV RNA1 in our VLP-RNAseq (1103 reads), indicating that there was a low-level persistent infection with FHV in our Sf21 cells, as has also been reported for a number other cell lines. 21, [32] [33] [34] Consequently, we would also expect approximately 300 of the FHV RNA2 reads from the VLP-RNAseq data set to be present as a result of FHV replication (judging from the stoichiometric ratios of FHV RNA1 and RNA2 seen in the FHV-RNAseq data set), which is well below the total number observed in the VLP-RNAseq data set (1.46 millions). Note that the FHV RdRp would not be able to replicate the FHV RNA2 derived from the baculovirus vector as this is cloned without the appropriate 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 untranslated regions required for viral replication. 6 To illustrate the detection of recombination, we mapped the reads to two specific defective RNAs (R2D675 and R1D1626) that are known to arise during passaging of FHV in cell culture. 14, 15 These defective RNAs are formed by recombination events that occur between different portions of the FHV genome as illustrated in Fig. 1 . Many of these result in large deletions of the RNA genome while others result in insertions or duplications (e.g., in R2D675, nucleotides 102-154 are duplicated and reinserted near the 3\u2032 terminus). When these recombination events occur, a junction is generated with a novel nucleic acid sequence. From the FHV-RNAseq data set, 15 single reads mapped to R1D1626, and 101 mapped to R2D675, all of which mapped to junction sites that characterize the respective defective RNA. The locations of the mapped reads are illustrated in Fig. 2 . Reads from the FHV-RNAseq data set were mapped to these sequences and are indicated underneath the schematic for each defective RNA to illustrate their mapping over the recombination junction sites. Fig. 1 . As expected, no reads aligned to the portions of the defective RNAs that maintain a wild-type sequence as these reads were already aligned to the fully intact FHV genome. However, not all junction events were detected, indicating that the precise character of the defective RNAs generated in our sample was different to that previously identified. The mapping of reads over junctions present in known defective RNAs is important to illustrate how individual RNA recombination events within the FHV genome can be detected.",

To achieve this, we generated a reference pseudolibrary containing millions of short reference sequences (\u2264150 nt in length) each corresponding to potential recombination events within the FHV genome. The pseudo-library was generated using a Python script whereby every 75-base sequence from the FHV genome was appended to every other 75-base sequence. We also allowed shorter sequences to be generated for reference sequences corresponding to recombination events occurring near the edges (\u226520 bp) of the FHV genes. The reference pseudo-library contained 19,965,801 sequences describing junctions within FHV RNA1 and FHV RNA2 as well as between these two. For each reference, the first 75 nt on the 5\u2032 side of the junction site is defined as the 5\u2032 strand, while the 3\u2032 nucleotides form the 3\u2032 strand. Thus, by mapping 95-nt reads to reference sequences 150 nt in length where the recombination junction is placed between bases 75 and 76, a minimum of 20 nt from the single read must align to both the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 strands. Junctions appearing in either 20-bp extremity of the single reads would not be detected. Consequently, there are 56 of a possible 94 'cutting' sites in the 95bp single reads where junctions may be detected. While this will result in an underreporting of all possible recombination events, this prevents the possibility of mapping reads with too few nucleotides on one side of a junction to unambiguously assign its identity.",

Interestingly, the locations of the striations are maintained regardless of the identity of the recombination partner; for example, the horizontal striation occurring between nucleotides 710 and 730 in RNA2 is present regardless of whether RNA2 or RNA1 provides the 3\u2032 strands. These striations may therefore indicate a sequence-dependent preference in the selection of recombination sites. It is interesting to note that some of these striations pass through locations of previously characterized defective RNAs 14,15 as well as locations of high-frequency events detected here. The positions of the horizontal and vertical striations do not correlate (Pearson coefficients are \u22120.0035 and \u22120.0019 for RNA1 and RNA2 recombinations, respectively). This indicates that the sequence-dependent selection of 5\u2032 strands differs from that of 3\u2032 strands. However, no apparent nucleotide preference at either strand could be detected, other than a weak underrepresentation of guanines at the junction sites (Fig. S1 ). Additionally, there was no average sequence identity detected between nucleotides upstream of the junction site in the 5\u2032 strand and nucleotides upstream of the 3\u2032 strand, as has been reported for defective RNAs, for example, in dengue virus. 16 The selection of recombination sites may therefore have a more complex origin, for example, in the character of the local RNA secondary structure. 6 The positions in the heat map that correspond to mapping to the defective RNA illustrated in Fig. 1 are shown in Fig. 2b and c. The precise sites of the junctions corresponding to the previously identified defective RNAs are marked with blue cross-hairs and are relatively poorly represented (the reads indicated under the cross-hairs in the heat map are the same reads illustrated in Fig. 1 ). However, we detected two high-frequency junctions nearby that join nucleotides 249-517 and nucleotides 730-1229 (8544 and 1080 mapped reads, respectively-these can be seen in Fig. 2c insets f and g, respectively) and are two highest-frequency events detected within RNA2.

This indicates that there is an overrepresentation of a small number of unique recombination events. Heavy-tailed distributions can arise when events are initially randomly generated, but some selected events are favorably duplicated, 36 as has been observed for a number of replicable components of eukaryotic and prokaryotic genomes. 37 Such a scenario is what we would expect during the generation of defective RNAs, which are initially generated by stochastic RNA recombination but are subsequently highly (sometimes competitively) replicated by viral RdRps. 12 Detection of sequence reads spanning two recombination events",

As before, we designed this library to enforce the single reads to map with at least 20 nt on the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 sides of the recombination events. Consequently, the maximum distance allowed between junction sites was 55 nt (95 nt from a single read minus two 20-nt 'seeds') and we allowed a minimum of 5 nt. This second pseudolibrary contained 19,379,090 reference sequences ranging from 95 to 145 nt in length. From the 1,990,779 reads that remained unaligned (Table 1) , we mapped an additional 80,374 reads to RNA1 recombinations and 58 reads to RNA2 recombinations. As each reference contained two recombination junctions, this corresponds to an extra 160,748 and 116 junction sites detected in RNA1 and RNA2 respectively.",

The VLPs were generated by expressing the capsid protein (FHV RNA2) from a baculoviral expression vector. In the absence of viral RNA replication, VLPs package host RNA and RNA transcripts from the baculoviral expression vector (Table 1) , which are transcribed by the host DNA-dependent RNA polymerases. We would not therefore expect any junctions to be present in the VLP-RNAseq data set as a result of recombination during viral RNA replication. The VLP-RNAseq data set was generated using the same procedure as for the FHV-RNAseq data set. Consequently, by searching for junctions within the VLP-RNAseq data set, we can estimate the amount of recombination that has occurred during PCR steps in the cDNA library preparation used for RNAseq, as is a recognized artifact. 38 From the VLP-RNAseq data set, 82 reads mapped to RNA1-RNA1 junctions (note that RNA1 was present in very small quantities due to a potential low-level persistent infection of Sf21 cells with FHV) and 2168 reads mapped to RNA2-RNA2 junctions ( Fig. 4 and Table 1 ). A prominent diagonal striation is visible, spanning the heat map of RNA2-RNA2 junctions. These events correspond to very short insertions and deletions. A histogram of the lengths of insertions and deletions that occurs due to each recombination event (Fig. 5) shows that insertions and deletions 5 nt or shorter (known as MicroInDels) are abundant in the VLP-RNAseq data set as well as in the FHV-RNAseq data set. This indicates that their formation was not unique to the FHV viral polymerase but was most likely to have arisen during the amplification of the cDNA library used for sequencing. DNA polymerases are known to accrue MicroInDels 39, 40 and have been reported to be abundant in other NGS data sets. 41, 42 Consequently, we exclude all MicroInDels when counting and comparing recombination events between the FHV-RNAseq and VLP-RNAseq data sets, as indicated in Table 1 . Excluding these MicroInDels, only 356 reads from the VLP-RNAseq data set mapped to recombination events in FHV RNA2 (none were detected in FHV RNA1). In contrast, we detected 26,958 junctions in FHV RNA2 within the FHV-RNAseq data set. Fig. 2 of the junctions detected in the VLP-RNAseq data set demonstrate that the majority of events correspond to MicroInDels (N=1812), evident as the strong diagonal striation. Other artifactual junctions were also detected but with low frequency (N=356).",

They thus provide a suitable control against which to compare the FHV-RNAseq data set. We detected 1220 reads that mapped to recombination events occurring within these genes and between these genes (Table S1) , thus giving a total of 1576 artifactual recombination events per 4.19 millions mapped reads. This would be equivalent to 2539 reads per 6.75 millions mapped reads. Excluding the double recombinations, we detected 26,958 recombination events within FHV RNA2 (6.75 millions mapped reads) and 1,167,929 reads within FHV RNA1 (17.9 millions mapped reads) and a total of 33,356 between these two, which is clearly in great excess of the artifactual recombination detected in the VLP-RNAseq data set.

From this, we can make an estimate of the average recombination frequency across the FHV genome ( Table 2 ). This will reflect both the frequency of individually generated recombination events and the replication of junctions that are found in the defective RNAs. However, the observed frequencies provided a metric with which to evaluate the amount of genetic variety in the virus sample. As these frequencies are likely to be inflated at the extremities of each gene due to the low coverage of wild-type reads in these regions (in particular at the 3\u2032 terminus) (Fig. S2) , we also show the rates over just the ORFs of each gene. These values indicate that RNA recombination is an abundant source of mutagenesis and is comparable in magnitude to that of mismatch mutation ( Table 2 ).",

The frequency of RNA recombination is known to vary widely between viral species, even among different positive-sense RNA virus, and could be assessed using NGS. The frequency of RNA recombination could also be compared between different preparations of the same virus, for example, during the course of an infection, or when amplified in different host cells for viruses that have a broad host range (e.g., dengue virus) or when viruses are exposed to antiviral therapies (e.g., ribavirin treatment for hepatitis C virus). Additionally, it would also be possible to search for recombination between different viral species during co-infections. This would be important for understanding the role of RNA recombination in the evolution of new viruses. Our approach could also be used to discover and characterize novel defective RNAs and DI-RNAs potentially present in a variety of infectious viruses. The generation of DI-RNAs has been proposed to be a critical stage in the transition of acute to chronic viral infections 43 and DI-RNAs have been found in patients persistently infected with measles virus, 44 dengue virus, 45 and hepatitis C virus. 46 Characterizing DI-RNAs present even in very low titers may improve our understanding of viral infections and help identify variations of such elements between individuals or host organisms or during the progression of a viral infection. Additionally, characterizing what portions of the virus genome are present in the DI-RNAs will help us understand which components of the genome are necessary for replication by the viral polymerases. Similarly, by analyzing the nucleic acids packaged inside viruses, we may potentially find which components of the genome are required for successful encapsidation. Finally, therapeutic applications could be envisioned as discovering the identity of DI-RNAs may allow for their exploitation for treatment or prevention of acute viral infections. Such applications have been demonstrated, for example, in the form of deliverable vaccines 47 or through the transgenic expression of DI-RNA-like molecules. 48 ",

Reads were aligned to the host genome reference using the Bowtie alignment package version 0.12.7 31 c in -v mode, tolerating up to three mismatched nucleotides per 95-base read. Alignment files were processed using SAMtools 51 d and alignments were visualized and inspected using Tablet. 52 Reads were mapped to the FHV genome using Bowtie parameters -v 2 -best. Junctions were detected by alignment of the remaining reads using Bowtie parameters -v 2 -best to a library of sequences corresponding to all possible recombination events in the FHV genome as described in the main text. Reads that mapped with mismatches and that mapped to the edges of the reference sequences were removed from the alignment (from the .sam file). This is because the mismatch tolerance can allow a read to map with fewer than the required 20 nt at either the donor or acceptor strand by claiming mismatching at the junction site of an adjacent but incorrect reference.",
