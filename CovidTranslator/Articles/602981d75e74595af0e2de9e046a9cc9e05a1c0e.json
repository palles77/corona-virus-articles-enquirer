However, mammalian genomes transcribe many short and long non-protein-coding RNAs (ncRNAs). With the advent of deepsequencing technologies, systematic transcriptome analysis of the host response, including analysis of ncRNAs of different sizes, is now possible. Using this approach, we recently discovered widespread differential expression of host long (>200 nucleotide [nt]) ncRNAs in response to virus infection. Here, the samples described in the previous report were again used, but we sequenced another fraction of the transcriptome to study very short (about 20 to 30 nt) ncRNAs. We demonstrated that virus infection also altered expression of many short ncRNAs of diverse classes. Putting the results of the two studies together, we show that small RNAs may also play an important role in regulating the host response to virus infection.",

In this study, we used deep-sequencing technology to perform a complementary small RNA transcriptome analysis of the same severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV)-infected lung samples collected from four mouse strains as previously reported. In addition, lung samples collected from the same four influenza virus-infected mouse strains were included in the new analysis. Our results show that many known miRNAs responded differently to the two virus infections and that many of them were also differentially regulated during lethal influenza virus infection, as shown in a previous study (3) . We also discovered many non-miRNA small RNAs and unannotated small RNAs that were differentially expressed during infection. The integration of transcriptome sequencing analysis of long transcripts and small RNAs showed the intricate interactions of short and long RNAs during virus infection. The changes in miRNAs positively correlated with the changes in long transcripts cotranscribing from the same locus, indicating that the miRNAs were transcriptionally regulated during virus infection. We predicted that differentially expressed miRNAs could target the majority of differentially expressed long transcripts during virus infection.",

For comparisons, we performed small RNA sequencing analysis using another set of lung samples collected from additional mice of the same four mouse strains infected with influenza virus.

Directional cDNA libraries were constructed using standard Illumina protocols for small RNA analysis, which targeted small RNAs of around 19 to 22 nucleotides (nt).",

As expected, the reads exhibited a large peak in abundance in the length range of 19 to 22 nt ( Fig. 1a ; see Fig. S1 in the supplemental material). For each sample, the majority (88% on average) of total short reads were mapped into different classes of abundant small RNAs. miRNAs composed the most abundant class, accounting for about 45% of total reads on average ( Fig. 1b ; see also Table S1 in the supplemental material). We observed a wide range of counts of reads (from 1 to an average of 2,577,006 for the most abundant miRNA in a given sample) mapped to individual miRNAs in both normal and virus-infected samples, indicating that techniques with dynamic ranges as large as 10 6 are required for comprehensive profiling of miRNA expression. On average, about 616 of 1,055 annotated mature mouse miRNAs were detected with at least one read in a given sample. The detected miRNAs showed very distinctive expression patterns in both normal and virus-infected mouse lung samples. In all samples, the top 20 most abundant miRNAs by read count accounted for about 90% of miRNA reads and the top 10 miRNAs for 80% of miRNA reads.

We first studied annotated miRNAs, as host miRNAs represented the most abundant class of small RNAs observed and the host miRNA response to SARS-CoV infection has not been reported previously. We identified 45 mature miRNAs that were differentially expressed during SARS-CoV or influenza virus infection. Thirty were consistently upregulated or consistently downregulated by more than 1.5-fold across three or more mouse strains during SARS-CoV infection, and 10 were consistently upregulated or consistently downregulated by more than 1.5-fold across three or more mouse strains during influenza virus infection (Fig. 2a ). In addition, 24 of these miRNAs were consistently upregulated or consistently downregulated by more than 1.5-fold in two or more mouse strains during both SARS-CoV and influenza virus infection. Additional quantitative PCR (qPCR) analyses of replicate samples with a large subset of differentially expressed miRNAs showed good concordance between replicates and statistical congruence (see Fig. S2 in the supplemental material). Interestingly, there were 7 miRNAs that were upregulated in at least three mouse strains during both SARS-CoV and influenza virus infection, suggesting that a subset of miRNAs such as these commonly responded to different virus infections. However, 84% (38/45) of the differentially expressed miRNAs showed different expression profiles across four mouse strains in SARS-CoV and influenza virus infections (Fig. 2a) , suggesting that expression of most miRNAs was likely both host and virus dependent. Although the physiological relevance of small changes in miRNA expression remains to be investigated, other studies have indicated that 1.5fold changes in expression can have significant biological impact (8) . In addition, because we profiled whole lung samples, some of the observed changes in expression could have been due to the infiltration of immune cells into the infected lung.",

Of those 28 miRNAs profiled on the microarray in the previous study, 75% (21/28) showed at least a 1.5-fold difference between the response to the highly pathogenic r1918 virus infection and the response to minimally pathogenic A/Texas/36/91 virus infection for at least one of three time points studied.

Even with only 6 miRNAs surveyed and relatively large variations among replicate samples, we were able to observe distinctive miRNA expression changes. These changes were detected under conditions of infection with different viruses and were seen with samples generated in vivo versus in vitro (see Fig. S3 in the supplemental material). First, we observed that 5 of 6 miRNAs had very different expression patterns in the highly pathogenic SARS-CoVMA15 versus the minimally pathogenic Urbani strain ( Fig. 2b; Fig. S3 ). Different expression patterns were also seen with 3 of 6 miRNAs in comparisons of the highly pathogenic VN1203 influenza virus to the attenuated VN1203 hemagglutinin (HA) mutant strain. This argues that some of the identified miRNAs may be associated with pathogenic outcomes. Second, many factors may have contributed to the different expression patterns; however, it appears unlikely that the observed miRNA changes were due to pure immune cell infiltration, as 4 miRNAs showed strong evidence of differential expression in cultured fibroblasts during infection. Third, and not surprisingly, several miRNAs showed expression patterns that differed between the in vivo and in vitro models. The differences could be attributed to cell type specificity or to different environmental and/or growth conditions, as two miRNAs that did not show obvious differential expression patterns in cultured fibroblasts, miR-155 in macrophages (10) and miR-223 in neutrophils (11) , are known to be related to different immune cell types. In summary, these results suggest that miRNAs are likely involved in viral pathogenesis and that the choice of experimental systems used for miRNA studies should be considered a critical and informing component in the study design.",

As shown in Table S1 in the supplemental material, there were still many (about 17 million in total) \"leftover\" reads which did not map to annotated or predicted abundant small RNAs but were aligned to the mouse reference genome, suggesting that there might be some novel host small RNAs relevant to virus infection. Therefore, starting by mapping all short reads directly to the mouse reference genome, we carried out a genome-wide search of novel small RNAs (see Materials and Methods). In total, of 4,473,273 start positions in the genome with at least one uniquely mapped read, we found that about 5% (233,236) gave at least 4 reads of the same length in a sample, resulting in 16,054 nonredundant candidate loci for putative small RNAs. About 1.7% (276/16,054) of the candidate loci (median length, 39 nt) were differentially expressed during SARS-CoV and/or influenza virus infection (see Table S2 and Fig. S4a in the supplemental material); 46 of those candidate loci overlapped with annotated miRNA precursors (miRBase version 16). We next used a conservative filtering strategy to remove 60 of 276 candidate loci from further analysis because of the possibility of misalignment of short reads originating from other highly expressed loci (see Materials and Methods). We considered the remaining 216 to represent putative small RNA loci, as we reasoned that their showing consistent responses to virus infection suggested that they were more likely to be biologically functional rather than to represent random noise. To validate the analytical approach used to identify these differentially expressed putative small RNA loci, we compared the expression ratios calculated for infection versus matched mock infection that we used to identify these putative (10) and miR-223 in neutrophils (11) , are known to be related to immune cells. The other four miRNAs came from a small-scale screening performed using qPCR with a subset of randomly selected differentially expressed miRNAs in PWK/PhJ mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) infected with influenza virus (data not shown). Also, miR-27a* and miR-671-3p were not measured by previous microarray (see panel a). Colors on the heat map indicate the log 2 ratios (the differences between medians of normalized Ct values of replicate samples) of expression in virusinfected samples to expression in matched mock-infected samples.

Similarly, the \"Lung \u03e9 SARS\" data contrast miRNA expression changes in lung samples from mice infected with highly pathogenic SARS-CoV (MA, MA15) and minimally pathogenic SARS-CoV (Urb, Urbani). The \"PWK MEFs \u03e9 Flu\" data represent temporal miRNA expression changes in samples from cultured PWK MEFs infected with the mouse-adapted A/PR/ 8/34 influenza virus across four time points after infection.

We found that 63% (135/216) overlapped (sense or antisense) with annotated loci, including coding RNAs, ncRNAs, and those with unannotated genomic regions ( Table 1 ), suggesting that the majority of small RNAs originated from genomic regions encoding long transcripts. Also, the result suggested that long transcripts from some of these regions have not been well annotated or that some regions formed independent transcriptional units exclusive to small RNAs, as 37% of putative small RNA loci did not overlap annotated long transcript-transcribing regions. To understand the classes of putative small RNAs produced from the loci, we then compared them to annotated or predicted abundant small RNAs. Interestingly, many putative small RNA loci overlapped non-miRNA small RNAs such as small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) and piwi-associated small RNAs (piRNAs) ( Table 1) . snoRNAs guide the chemical modification of ribosomal RNAs and other ncRNAs and are essential for major biological processes, including protein translation and mRNA splicing (12) . piRNAs represent a class of small RNAs that are 24 to 32 nt long and have been linked to transcriptional gene silencing in germ line cells (13) . piRNAs have also been identified in various somatic tissues (14, 15) . Also, we observed length distributions of small RNA loci overlapping an-notated small RNA loci that were similar to those of small RNA loci with no overlap (Fig. 3a) , indicating that our identified loci were indeed producing small RNAs. Examples of detailed read mapping of loci overlapped with annotated small RNAs are shown in Fig. 3b and c; similar results determined using read mapping of putative novel small RNA loci are shown in Fig. 4 . We observed that 32 putative small RNA loci overlapped with annotated snoR-NAs on the basis of the updated Ensembl annotation and that almost all (29 of 32) of the loci also overlapped with annotated coding or ncRNA loci, suggesting that, in addition to miRNAs, snoRNAs might represent another large class of small RNAs differentially expressed in response to virus infection and originating from long transcript-encoding loci.",

To the best of our knowledge, studies have profiled host miRNA expression changes during virus infection (1, 3, 16, 17) , but regulation of such miRNA expression changes has not been systematically investigated. miRNA biogenesis can be regulated at different steps (18) , including at least three steps of RNA processing: (i) the transcription of miRNA primary transcripts (pri-miRNA) of several thousand base pairs, (ii) the processing of the long pri-miRNAs to miRNA precursors (70 to 100 nt), and (iii) the processing of miRNA precursors into mature miRNAs (about 20 to 22 nt). As we had previously generated whole-transcriptome data using the set of lung samples infected with SARS-CoV with which we quantified long transcripts (especially those \u03fe200 nt in length) (5), we reasoned that the long pri-miRNAs were also quantified.",

The ratio of miRNA targets versus nontargets for differentially expressed mRNA loci was~3.5 compared to~1.6 for those loci that were not differentially expressed during infection, representing an enrichment of about 2.2-fold. These results strongly suggest that collectively differentially expressed miRNAs modulate the global host responses to virus infection. Notably, about 80% of those differentially expressed targets were predicted targets of two or more identified mature miRNAs, indicating that a single target could be regulated in vivo by multiple miRNAs at the same time during virus infection. Importantly, 82% of the targets predicted to be regulated by multiple miR-NAs were targeted by both upregulated and downregulated miRNAs at the same time, showing that additional studies are necessary to elucidate which specific miRNAs, if any, play a regulatory role in the changes of individual targets in vivo (Fig. S5b) . Functional analysis of predicted miRNA targets also indicated that many important aspects of the host response (such as innate immunity and cytokine production) were likely modulated by miRNAs (see Table S3 in the supplemental material).

For example, human and protozoan snoRNAs have been reported to be processed into miRNA-like RNAs (21, 22) , and the members of a class of novel small RNAs have been reported to be derived from many snoR-NAs (23) . Abundant small RNAs are also derived from tRNAs in a Dicer-dependent manner (9) , and human tRNA-derived small RNAs appear to be involved in the global control of small RNA silencing (24) . To our knowledge, the present study was the first to use comprehensive deep-sequencing technology to characterize virus infection-induced changes in expression of miRNAs and other classes of small RNAs, including many nonannotated small RNAs. As the biological functions of these diverse types of small RNAs are largely unknown, virus infection models also offer a unique platform for studying the regulation and biology of these diverse small RNAs. For example, the influenza virus NS1 protein inhibits host pre-mRNA splicing through its interaction with snoRNAs (25) (26) (27) . Also, it has been shown that SARS-CoV and other nidoviruses encode a protein with sequence similarity to XendoU, a eukaryotic endoribonuclease that is involved in cellular snoRNA processing (28, 29) . Though the experimental protocol used here is not optimized for the capture of RNA products with 2=,3=-cyclic phosphates as specifically generated by XendoU (30), we did observe that the fold changes of identified small RNAs tended to be larger in SARS-CoV-infected samples than in influenza virus-infected samples (see Fig. S4b and c in the supplemental material), suggesting that further investigation of the impact of viral proteins on host small RNA processing could represent another approach for the study of virus-host interactions.",

We therefore investigated whether the putative small RNAs identified here tended to have stable secondary RNA structures (see Materials and Methods). In total, 89 (41%) putative small RNA loci were predicted by secondary structure analysis; 20 of those loci did not overlap with those of the annotated small RNAs (see Table S4 in the supplemental material). Interestingly, those that overlapped with annotated small RNAs were significantly (chisquare test; P \u03ed 9.26e-06) more likely to be predicted by RNA secondary structure analysis (54% [69/128]) compared to those which did not overlap any annotated small RNAs (23% [20/88]), suggesting that the existing annotation of small RNAs might be biased toward those with stable local secondary structures. For example, out of 46 putative small RNA loci that overlapped with known miRNA precursors, 76% (one prediction only) to 87% (all four predictions combined) were predicted with secondary structures, indicating that our automated strategy for structure prediction performed well in terms of finding local RNA structures such as hairpins. For those putative loci that overlapped with other classes of small RNAs, however, the percentage predicted with secondary structures was much lower, ranging from 40.6% to 59% for snoRNAs to 24% for piRNAs. A closer look at those loci overlapping snoRNAs showed that 90% (9/10) of the loci that overlapped with H/ACA box family snoRNAs but only about 45% (10/22) of the loci that overlapped with C/D box family snoRNAs were predicted with secondary structures. Since snoRNAs are broadly classified into two families, corresponding to a C/D box with one short (~5 nt) hairpin structure and an H/ACA box with at least two large hairpin structures (31) , these results suggest that investigations based solely on a typical RNA secondary structurebased approach might miss many small RNAs that do not form stable local RNA structures per se and that approaches utilizing transcriptome sequencing might be able to identify broader classes of small RNAs.",

However, the regulation of miRNA expression changes during virus infection has not been systematically investigated. Through integrative analysis of parallel sequencing of both small RNAs and long transcripts from the same samples, we were able to infer the regulatory relationships both upstream and downstream of miRNAs with respect to the differences in expression. Not only did we show that the differential expression of miRNAs was likely due to transcriptional regulation, but our data also indicate that those miRNAs may collectively play a role in modulating the global host response. Since it has been shown that mechanistically mammalian miRNAs mainly act to decrease target mRNA levels, thus leading to reduced protein output (32), these results argue that a better understanding of the small RNAs, including miRNAs, would be required for complete knowledge of the regulation of host responses to virus infections. As evidenced here and in other studies (33) , multiple miRNAs can simultaneously regulate the same targets, arguing that experimental design with the corresponding miRNAs measured by whole-transcriptome sequencing analysis using the same samples (x axis). In total, 36 mature miRNA loci overlapped annotated loci and were included in the plot. (b) Data are presented as described for panel a, with the y axis data showing the log 2 fold changes in expression of the 2-kb genomic regions surrounding the corresponding miRNA precursors measured by whole-transcriptome sequencing analysis of the same samples.

For example, miR-155, one of the upregulated miRNAs identified here (Fig. 2a) , is produced from an exon of the long ncRNA BIC, which was also observed to be upregulated by whole-transcriptome sequencing analysis (5) . Both miR-155 and BIC were induced in primary murine macrophages stimulated by beta interferon (INF-\u2424) (10) . Loss-offunction studies showed that mice lacking a functional BIC/miR-155 gene exhibited a defective immune response in vivo and were deficient in cytokine production (35, 36) . Also, Fig. 3 shows two small RNAs overlapping snoRNAs encoded in the introns of Gas5, another long ncRNA that was previously identified as an apoptosis regulator (37) . It is unclear whether snoRNAs from Gas5 play any functional roles in response to virus infection, but it has been hypothesized that the functional effect of Gas5 on T-cell growth may be mediated through its intronic snoRNAs (38) . These examples suggest that a detailed investigation of the connections between long ncRNAs and the coexpressed small RNAs might facilitate a better understanding of the regulation of host responses. Moreover, even though the study of viral small RNAs is beyond the scope of this report, it is worth noting that we also observed many small sequence reads from both viral genomes (see Table S1 in the supplemental material). Though isolation of small RNAs from SARS-CoV infections has not been reported, it was shown recently that influenza virus expresses many small RNAs (39, 40) . In summary, our results convincingly show that, in the future, integrated sequencing analysis of different fractions of the complex transcriptome should facilitate a full understanding of virushost interactions and viral pathogenesis.",

We then used the Bowtie program as described above (43) but with criteria that were less stringent (i.e., with a change from 2 mismatches to 3 mismatches) and with adjustments of the program settings to report all valid alignments (Bowtie option \"-all\") to realign the extracted reads to the reference genomes.

For each identified homologous region, we counted the number of uniquely mapped reads obtained across all samples as described above.

Conserved RNA secondary structures (P \u03fe 0.5) were predicted using 30-way multiple alignments downloaded from the UCSC genome browser (http://genome.ucsc .edu) and RNAz (49) . For predictions performed using RNAfold (48), we extracted three genomic windows of different sizes (100, 150, and 200 nt) surrounding each putative small RNA loci. When a locus was shorter than the desired genomic window, we expanded the locus by first adding neighboring candidate loci within the desired genomic window and then extending the sequence at both ends to achieve the desired width. To evaluate the statistical significance of the secondary structures predicted by RNAfold, we generated 500 randomly permutated sequences from the original sequence, with dinucleotide frequencies preserved using uShuffle (50) , and used RNAfold to similarly fold all random sequences. We calculated the percentage of times that a random sequence exhibited a higher minimum free energy level than the original sequence as the P value of the predicted secondary structure for the locus. A prediction with P \u03fd 0.05 was considered significant.",
