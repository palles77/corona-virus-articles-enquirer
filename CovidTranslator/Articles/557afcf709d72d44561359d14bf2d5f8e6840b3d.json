The \u03b3-, \u03b2and \u03b1-phases exist at ambient pressure (p = 101.325 kPa) and low temperature (\u03b3 at T < 54.4 K; \u03b2 at T < 43.8 K; \u03b1 at T < 23.8 K) [1, 2] . At ambient temperature (T = 295 K) under pressure of 5.4 GPa oxygen solidifies into the \u03b2-phase, then at 9.6 GPa into the orthorhombic 'orange' \u03b4-phase, and, successively, at 10 GPa into the monoclinic 'dark red' \u03b5-phase. Above 96 GPa \u03b5-oxygen is transformed into the metallic \u03b6-phase which exhibits superconductivity (T c = 0.6 K) [1, 2] . The 'red' \u03b5-phase revealed the structure of two combined tetroxetane (cyclo-O 4 ) rings, giving rise to rhombohedral O 8 clusters [2] . In 1990 a ninth allotropic modification of oxygen was theoretically predicted [3] , the cyclooctaoxygen (cyclo-O 8 , octoxocane) (Fig. 1A) [1, 3] , assumed to exist in analogy to the common modification of elemental sulfur, cyclooctasulfur (cyclo-S 8 , octathiocane) [3] . We now wish to report the (biomimetic) synthesis, isolation, chemical characterization, biochemical and epigenetic significance of cyclo-O 8 in form of its sodium crown complex, (octoxocane-\u03ba 4 O 1 ,O 3 ,O 5 ,O 7 )sodium(1+) or cyclo-O 8 -Na + (Fig. 1B) , which can be liganded to give aqua(chloro)(octoxocane-\u03ba 4 ",

Briefly, cells were seeded into 96-well plates for the in vitro assays and incubated at 37 \u00b0C with 5% CO 2 before testing so that cells were 80-100% confluent upon infection. Each dilution of test or control compound was added to 5 wells of a 96-well plate, and three wells of each dilution were then infected with the test virus. The multiplicity of infection (MOI) was \u2264 0.007 cell culture infective dose 50% (CCID 50 )/cell for each virus. Two wells remained uninfected as toxicity controls. Six wells per plate were set aside as uninfected, untreated cell controls, and six wells per plate were infected with no treatment as virus controls. A known active compound was assayed in parallel as a control. The test medium was MEM with 2% FBS for chikungunya virus and MERS coronavirus, and MEM with 1 IU/ml trypsin and 10 \u03bcg/ml of EDTA for influenza A viruses. Assay plates were incubated at 37 \u00b0C with 5% CO 2 .

The unincorporated neutral red solution was removed from the wells and the incorporated dye was then eluted by adding S\u00f8rensen citrate-buffered ethanol. The plates were then read on a spectrophotometer at \u03bb = 540 nm wavelength to quantify the neutral red taken up by the healthy cells. The optical density of test wells was converted to percent of cell control and normalized to the virus controls. The concentration of test compound required to inhibit CPE by 50% (EC 50 ) was calculated by regression analysis. The concentration of compound that would cause 50% CPE in the absence of virus (CC 50 ) was also calculated by regression analysis using the uninfected wells treated with test compounds compared with untreated cell controls.

Instead of cytidine, cytidine hydrochloride (cytidine \u00d7 HCl) was utilized ( Fig. 2A) . The reported reaction [32] did not proceed, instead a crystalline material NC could be isolated which gave not the elemental analysis of cytidine \u00d7 HCl. This striking difference of NC from cytidine \u00d7 HCl was examined further by proton nuclear magnetic resonance ( 1 H-NMR) spectroscopy (Fig. S1 ), Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy (Fig. S2) , FT-Raman spectroscopy (Fig. S3) , and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) ( Fig. S4A and Fig. S5 ). It could be substantiated that NC contained an inert material not being salt (NaCl), since the FT-IR spectrum of NC differed from that of cytidine \u00d7 HCl. According to elemental analysis this inert material could account for one O 2 and a quarter of NaCl pro one cytidine \u00d7 HCl. In consequence, the formula was multiplied fourfold and this resulted in an oxygen 8-ring, cyclo-O 8 (Fig. 1A) , coordinated to one Na + (Fig. 1B) . The interpretation of the ESI-MS spectrum of NC actually proved the inclusion of cyclo-O 8 -Na + in NC, revealing was the detection of the aqua(octoxocane-\u03ba 4 O 1 ,O 3 ,O 5 ,O 7 )sodium(1+) cation (Fig.  S5) . Since in the 1 H-NMR spectrum of NC, in comparison to the 1 H-NMR reference spectrum of cytidine \u00d7 HCl, the differentially affected resonances were the 4-NH 2 , the 3-NH + , and the H-5 protons of the protonated cytidine (Fig. S1) , it is assumed that the points of coordination between cyclo-O 8 -Na + and cytidine \u00d7 HCl are the two 4-NH 2 hydrogens and one non-Na + -coordinated (free) oxygen of cyclo-O 8 -Na + . Consequently, a formula for NC can be elaborated: cytidine hydrochloride -aqua(chloro)(octoxocane\u03ba 4 O 1 ,O 3 ,O 5 ,O 7 )sodium (4:1) (Fig. 2A) . The FT-Raman spectrum of NC (Fig. S3B ) was nearly identical to the reference spectrum of cytidine \u00d7 HCl (Fig. S3A) . This, contrary to expectation, pointed to Raman-inactivity of cyclo-O 8 -Na + .",

As a result it was discovered that NC catalyzed oxygen formation from H 2 O 2 (catalase effect) [11] weakly in presence of NaHCO 3 , and strongly in presence of both C. utilis RNA and NaHCO 3 (Fig. S9) . Interestingly, NC could be fully substituted by cytidine \u00d7 HCl. Multiple controls assured that oxygen neither was produced spontaneously, nor from any other relevant combination of the utilized reagents.

If the C. utilis RNA was omitted, no product RC could be isolated, only cytidine \u00d7 HCl. Based on 1 H-NMR spectroscopy (Fig. S8B) and FT-IR spectroscopy (Fig. S10 ) of RC, a formula for RC can be constructed: cytidine hydrochloride -\u03bc-chloro(\u03bc-hydroxy)bis(octoxocane- (Fig. 2C ). We suggest a mechanism for the generation of cyclo-O 8 from atmospheric O 2 under ninhydrin catalysis (Fig. 2D) . Ninhydrin can dissociate to the ninhydrinate anion which in the heat could absorb four O 2 molecules to form an anion of a nonaoxidane. The 10-ring intermediate spiro[indene-2,10\u2032-nonoxecane]-1,3-dione could be formed from the nonaoxidanide under acid catalysis, followed by extrusion of cyclo-O 8 .",

NC and dNC were non-toxic to PBM cells, but stimulated the growth of CCRF-CEM cells. This pointed to a catalase effect exerted by NC and dNC, since CCRF-CEM cells are extremely sensitive to H 2 O 2 [43] , and scavenging of H 2 O 2 by 'catalase factors' is CCRF-CEM cell growth rate-limiting [43, 44] . Since NC was more active as a growth stimulant for CCRF-CEM cells than dNC, the responsible 'catalase factors' should be the nucleoside hydrochlorides, not the equimolar cyclo-O 8 -Na + -content in NC and dNC. NC and dNC exhibited no significant in vitro antiviral activities against the retro-transcribing human immunodeficiency type 1 and hepatitis B viruses (HIV-1 and HBV) (Table S1 ). NC showed no significant in vitro inhibiting activity versus the replication of influenza A, chikungunya and Middle East respiratory syndrome viruses (Table S2 ). In summary, cyclo-O 8 -Na + is, contrary to expectation, essentially non-toxic to human cells, and cytidine in conjunction with RNA acts as a catalyst in producing cyclo-O 8 -Na + from ubiquitous [45] H 2 O 2 through a catalase reaction in cultured human cells.",

We suggest a model for a first epigenetic shell of in vivo DNA (Fig. 4) , based on the observed complexation of cyclo-O 8 -Na + and spermine phosphate to ssDNA. One reason why this protecting shield of in vivo DNA was overlooked until now may be its destruction during DNA purification by the classical phenol extraction method of Schuster, Schramm & Zillig [47] . In our model (Fig. 4A ) the phosphate backbone of ssDNA binds one cyclo-O 8 -Na + pro three nucleotides, and this binary complex binds one spermine monophosphate to form a ternary epigenetic core of DNA. The monohydrogen phosphate bridges the cyclo-O 8 -Na + with the sperminium cation, and the cyclo-O 8 -Na + has an inverted alternating orientation (Fig. 4A) . Interestingly, the sperminium tetracation cannot bind alone to DNA in this model, since the distances [d (N 1 ,N 4 ) = 490 pm; d (N 1 ,N 12 ) = 1,600 pm] between the four ammonium nitrogens do not fit the average repeating distance (d \u00d8 = 650 \u00b1 30 pm) of the phosphate anion charges of DNA. Therefore, it is quite remarkable that in our model for the first epigenetic shell of in vivo DNA (Fig. 4A ) a repeating unit is formed from cyclo-O 8 -Na + and spermine phosphate that perfectly fits both the triplet nature of the genetic code [48] and the repeating distance of the phosphate anion backbone of DNA.",

The theoretical intracellular concentration of the sperminium phosphate/cyclo-O 8 -Na + complex required to cover all triplets of the dsDNA genome in a blood lymphocyte of Bos taurus was calculated as 13.8130 mM (see Section 2.9.). The actual concentration of spermine was measured as 1.57 \u00b1 0.12 (mM \u00b1 s.d.) [15] . Therefore, the coverage of B. taurus genome can be calculated as 2.62 \u00b1 0.50 (% \u00b1 s.d.) (see Section 2.9). A correlation was obtained when this value was compared to the proportion of protein-coding exons in B. taurus genome which was calculated as 2.64% or 2.68% by two independent methods (see Section 2.9.). This points to complete coverage of actively transcribed gene regions in B. taurus interphase genome by the sperminium phosphate/cyclo-O 8 -Na + complex. Since spermine binds more strongly to GC-rich dsDNA (pBR322 plasmid) [15] , it can be assumed that the sperminium phosphate/cyclo-O 8 -Na + complex binds preferentially to epigenetic, non-methylated CpG island hotspots [49] and is involved in epigenetic gene regulation [49] .",

This is a reasonable result, since spermine synthesis is highest in the metaphase of mitosis in the cell cycle, coincident with an extraordinary high condensation grade of metaphase chromatin [50] . Control for this in vitro result is the published elemental phosphorus content (mmol/kg dry weight) in mitotic chromatin of primary cryptal enterocytes of murine duodenum [21] . The obtained in vivo value corresponds to a haploid genomic coverage of 12.4%, and a nuclear RNA coverage of 77.3%, by the sperminium phosphate/cyclo-O 8 -Na + complex in mitotic chromatin (see Section 2.11.).

These postulations would account for a long-sought molecular explanation of the essential, but 'mysterious' function of the polyamine spermine in eukaryotes [55] . Spermine is found only in eukaryotes, with some exceptions, and prokaryotes rely mostly on putrescine and spermidine [55, 56] . The essentiality of spermine for humans is exemplified by the Snyder-Robinson X-linked mental retardation syndrome [57] caused by missense mutations in the human spermine synthase gene, leading to mental retardation, generalised seizures, absent speech, inability to stand, and other severe defects [57] . One can speculate that at the transition from prokaryotic to eukaryotic life the sperminium phosphate/cyclo-O 8 -Na + complex resulted as a consequence from the combined accumulation of atmospheric oxygen and prokaryotic RNA, since the evolution of spermine synthases from prokaryotic spermidine synthase was proposed [56] as co-occurring with the onset of proto-eukaryotic life.",
