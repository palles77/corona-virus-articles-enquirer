This paper deduces a non-smooth infectious disease model induced by selection pressures. Analysis of this model reveals rich dynamics including local, global stability of equilibria and local sliding bifurcations. Model solutions ultimately stabilize at either one real equilibrium or the pseudo-equilibrium on the switching surface of the present model, depending on the threshold value determined by some related parameters. Our main results show that reducing the threshold value to a appropriate level could contribute to the efficacy on prevention and treatment of emerging infectious disease, which indicates that the selection pressures can be beneficial to prevent the emerging infectious disease under medical resource limitation.",

Since the first outbreaks in China in early 2003 SARS had spread rapidly across China into southeast Asia and even the world, and SARS was the first severe new disease of the 21st century, so we take SARS as an example of emerging infectious disease in this paper. In the early stages of the 2003 SARS outbreak, only a very few number of individuals infected by SARS, and the early symptoms were very similar to flu and could not be diagnosed by medical personnel.",

On the prevention and treatment for SARS, the effective and essential measures including heightened surveillance, early detection and treatment of cases, and infection control in all health facilities have been applied. Although the emergency ambulances including development of effective drugs and rapid tools for diagnosis provided a safe and reliable mobile medical treatment platform for tacking SARS, it would put pressure on limited medical resources such as doctors, hospital beds, isolation places and bring grave challenges to each country, especially in rural areas in many developing http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chaos.2014.09.014 0960-0779/\u00d3 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. countries [6] [7] [8] [9] . For example, it was a serious challenge for medical personnel to diagnose the patients who were infected by SARS or flu with the similar signs and symptoms such as coughs, colds, fevers and so on. Those required a lot of medical resources, which undoubtedly worse the already grave situation. Thus, medical resource limitation seriously restricted the prevention and treatment for SARS. Therefore, faced with an increasing numbers of SARS infected cases and flu, the increasing serious situation caused the doctors have to focus their attentions on the SARS infected cases and put aside flu due to selection pressure. As such, emergency medical treatment services such as isolated treatment, personal protection, medical observation, sterilization and so on were only taken immediately for SARS. For the patients infected by flu, the doctors had to prescribe some medicines to them and advise them go home for home treatment as the selection pressure.",

In such a case, intervention is modeled and represented by using a piecewise function. This type of control strategy is a socalled threshold policy [10, 11] , which is defined as follow: if the number of the patients infected by SARS is below the threshold level (denoted by I c ), there is no limited medical resource and selection pressure; above the threshold, due to the limited resource, and doctors treat SARS only. The threshold policy defined as above is also referred to as an on-off control which can be described by Filippov systems [12, 13] .

All those show that R is a monotonic increasing (or decreasing) function with respect to p 2 provided I 1 < I c (or I 1 > I c ). Thus, in order to obtain the maximum recovery rate, we choose p 2 \u00bc 1 for I 1 < I c , that is, sufficient medical resources can treat those small number of infected patients at the early stage of SARS outbreak, the patients infected by flu can be treated simultaneously with SARS (i.e., p 1 \u00bc p 2 \u00bc 1). However, along with the prevalence of SARS (i.e., I 1 > I c ), the limited medical resources can not satisfy the growing trend towards SARS cases. Department of health or state has to cite the urgency of fighting SARS, adopts ''green passage'' policy that speeds for isolation and treatment for SARS. At this moment, the doctors have to prescribe medicines for the patients infected by flu and advise them go home for home treatment (i.e., p 1 \u00bc 1; p 2 \u00bc 0). Meanwhile, this exposes the faultiness of state handling mechanism of paroxysmal public health events and infectious disease observation mechanism, especially in poor countries and areas. In this case, we choose p 2 \u00bc 0 for I 1 > I c .",

            "text": "In present work, we have proposed a non-smooth infectious disease model induced by selection pressures under medical resource limitation. In order to understand the effects of selection pressure on infectious disease transmission, by employing the qualitative theory and bifurcation techniques of non-smooth systems [13, [27] [28] [29] , we deliberately investigate the long-term dynamic behavior of the proposed Filippov model. In particular, the sliding mode dynamics, the sliding bifurcations and global dynamics of the proposed model have been addressed.By using Utkin's equivalent control method introduced in [13] , we first obtain the differential equation for sliding dynamics of the Filippov system (7), and then the sliding mode dynamics and the local sliding bifurcations have been addressed by applying bifurcation theories [27] [28] [29] , see Figs. 2 and 3. Meanwhile, the global dynamical behavior has been established by excluding the existence of limit cycles for system (7), as shown in Figs. 7-9.Model (7) could stabilize at either one of the two equilibria (E 1 R and E 2 R ) or the pseudo-equilibrium E P on the switching surface, depending on the threshold level I c which is determined by Fig. 8 indicates that the pseudo-equilibrium E P is globally asymptotically stable, which indicates that the infected population can stabilize at a previously chosen level I c once the threshold policy and some related parameters (i.e., c 1 ; c 2 ; b 2 ) are chosen properly. Hence, it is very crucial to choose appropriate control parameters for making the decision to trigger the intervention on infectious disease transmission.The main results also show that on the prevention and treatment of SARS, we should choose an appropriate threshold I c (i.e., I c < I \u00c3 c ) at which the selection treatment strategy should be implemented and decided. That is, if the number of people infected by SARS is large than the threshold I c , then we should take emergency medical treatment services (such as isolated treatment, personal protection, medical observation, sterilization and so on) immediately only for SARS cases due to medical resource limitation. Only in this way, SARS can be controlled as soon as possible. Those indicate that the results obtained here could be beneficial for accurately assessing the effect of selection pressure in the control and treatment of SARS (as shown in Figs. 11 and 12) . In particular, the selection treatment strategy can help us to prevent the new emerging infectious disease.However, this study is a special case that the patients infected by SARS will be taken care immediately no matter medical resource limit (i.e., b 1 \u00bc 0). In fact, there exists limited medical resource in real world especially in rural areas for new emerging infectious disease. Therefore, if b 1 > 0, the dynamical behavior of both subsystems become much more complex and what we want to investigate is how the dynamic behavior of the model could be dramatically affected by the existence of medical resource limitation, and consequently influences the prevention and control for emerging infectious disease. Hence, we leave this work as our future study.",
