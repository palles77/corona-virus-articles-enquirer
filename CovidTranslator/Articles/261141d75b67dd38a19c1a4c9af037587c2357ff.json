Data showed an increasing incidence from 0.7/million in 1997 to 1.2/million in 2006 (p<0.001). We compared our data with those from the French Mycosis Study Group, a recently established voluntary network of French mycologists coordinated by the National Reference Center for Mycoses and Antifungals. We documented that incidence of zygomycosis increased, particularly in patients with hematologic malignancies or bone marrow transplants. The role of previous exposure to antifungal drugs lacking activity against zygomycetes could explain this increase but does not appear exclusive. Incidence also increased in the population of patients with diabetes mellitus. We conclude that observed trends reflect a genuine increase of zygomycosis cases in at-risk populations.",

            "text": "Z ygomycoses are severe angioinvasive infections caused by common filamentous fungi, the zygomycetes. These ubiquitous opportunistic fungi can cause infections with high lethality in immunocompromised or diabetic patients. Whatever the route of infection (inhalation of airborne spores, ingestion, or direct skin inoculation), the hyphae invade blood vessels, causing tissue infarction and necrosis (1) (2) (3) (4) . In healthy persons, innate immunity is sufficient to prevent infection, except in cases of massive contamination after traumatic inoculation of contaminated soil (5) . Patients with phagocytic dysfunctions caused by neutrope-nia or ketoacidosis, as well as patients with high iron serum concentrations, are at high risk of developing zygomycosis (4) . These underlying conditions can influence clinical presentation and outcome (2, 6, 7) . The rhinocerebral presentation is the most frequently reported localized symptom followed by pulmonary, cutaneous, cerebral, gastrointestinal, and disseminated infections (3, 8) . In the rhinocerebral or pulmonary forms, patient death rates are reported to be as high as 60% because of delayed diagnosis or delayed therapeutic management (7) (8) (9) . Treatment strategies are based on high doses of any lipid formulation of amphotericin B, associated with large surgical resections when possible. Most triazole agents are not effective in vivo (10) , except for posaconazole, which shows some efficacy both experimentally and in patients as second-line therapy (11) (12) (13) . The clinical contribution of new iron chelating agents remains controversial (14, 15) .",

Several explanations have been posited: longer survival of persons with severe hematologic malignancies or solid organ transplantations; increased knowledge of the infection and thus a better diagnosis yield; and finally, prolonged use of new antifungal drugs ineffective against zygomycetes as prophylactic or empiric treatment in bone marrow transplant recipients or other immunocompromised patients (10, (17) (18) (19) (20) . However, the incidence of infection among the general population and infection trends over time has rarely been documented at a national level. To describe the demographic characteristics of patients and to estimate the incidence and casefatality ratio (CFR) associated with the major underlying diseases, we analyzed the electronic hospitalization and death records of patients in France in whom zygomycosis had been diagnosed.",

Medical information includes the main cause of admission (principal diagnosis), the related medical conditions (with >20 entries for various associated diagnoses), duration of stay, modes of admission and discharge, and major medical activities performed during the stay. Diseases are coded according to the International Classification of Diseases, 10th revision (ICD-10). This coding system was stable during the study period.

We first created the bone marrow transplantation (BMT) category, which included autologous and allogenic BMT, with or without graft versus host disease. To reduce underreporting bias, we looked for BMT occurrence in both incident and readmitted patients. Because of changes in the coding system regarding medical procedures, identification of autologous versus allogenic BMTs before 2003 was not possible. In a second category labeled hematologic malignancies, we included neutropenia or aplastic anemia, acute lymphoid or myeloid leukemia, lymphomas, and other disorders of the myeloid system. The third category, labeled nonhematologic immunodepression, included solid organ cancers, HIV infection, solid organ transplantations, and/or rejection of these transplantations. By convention, BMT patients (with or without graft versus host disease) who also had a neutropenia were classified under the BMT category.

These differences could have several nonexclusive reasons. First, diagnosing zygomycosis is not easy. As recently underlined (25) , a culture positive with a zygomycete does not always mean infection; many gastrointestinal cases reported in the PMSI may be falsepositive cases resulting from laboratory contamination. The unusual distribution of clinical presentations found in our study and the fact that one third of clinical information was missing favor this hypothesis.

As reported by Chang et al. (27) , who compared administrative data with medical records in the United States, the positive predictive value of ICD-10 codes for detecting invasive aspergillosis can be low. The authors stressed that these codes may sometimes be assigned before final diagnosis is confirmed, or they may not be assigned by the clinician in charge of the patient. These considerations are also true in the PMSI: overreporting was estimated at 11% for cancers of the thyroid in a study based in 10 districts (28) and at 15% for mesothelioma (29) . Inversely, underreporting caused by diagnostic or coding errors was estimated at 17% by Hafdi-Nejjari et al. (30) and at 27% by Carr\u00e9 et al. (28) , respectively. Nevertheless, administrative data are useful tools to estimate the trends of severe infections like zygomycosis, since most patients are likely to be hospitalized (26, 31) , especially in the tertiary care centers that participate in the PMSI.",

In this population, increases in the number of recorded cases could be linked to frequent prescription of antifungal drugs lacking activity against zygomycetes, such as voriconazole and caspofungin (10,17,18,33-35) . However, the role of previous exposure to these antifungal drugs does not appear exclusive because the incidence also increased in the population of patients with diabetes mellitus, a population not known to be commonly exposed to long-term antifungal therapies. An increasing number of the populations at risk (increasing incidence or prolonged survival times) could explain the increase observed in our study: +24% per year for patients with hematologic malignancies and +15% for BMT patients, respectively. However, data from the national agency in charge of the surveillance of transplantations (36) indicate that the number of hematopoietic stem cell transplantations increased by +1.58% per year (p<0.01) 2001-2006. Similarly, we documented a +9% per year increase in zygomycosis in patients with diabetes; in parallel, diabetes prevalence increased at an estimated 5.7%/year in France from 2000 through 2005 (37) . We thus tend to consider that the observed trends reflect a genuine increase of zygomycosis cases in these atrisk populations.",

However, age distributions and underlying conditions are likely to differ between places and to evolve over time, thus not allowing strict comparisons. Another limitation of the PMSI is the absence of information regarding the circumstances of exposure and portal of entry. The highest incidence rates found in 5 rural districts and not in others of comparable age and gender distributions may indicate a particular exposure to molds in rural environments (for instance, a professional exposure) or an increased awareness of these diseases among clinicians and microbiologists/mycologists of the corresponding regions.",

Nevertheless, the CFRs for patients with severe immunosuppressive conditions (Table) are close to values reported in the literature. The CFRs in our study are population-based, while reports from the literature mostly refer to large but relatively old series or to series of immunocompromised patients with severe underlying diseases whose outcome is expected to be worse than in the nonimmunocompromised general population (8, 32, 38) . Also, the CFRs in these other studies may include the long-term outcomes for more discrete time frames, for example, 1 year survival rates (32), information not available through our type of study. Deaths occurring during hospitalization are not systematically reported in the PMSI, and those occurring outside the hospital may be underdiagnosed in the CepiDc because many practitioners are not aware of zygomycosis. False-positive cases (for instance, zygomycetes culture without infection) can also influence CFR calculations by increasing the denominator. The wide range of CFR estimates calculated with the capture-recapture method reflects these uncertainties.",

Despite the limitations linked to the sources of data we used, this study provides a useful overview of the zygomycosis incidence trends over a decade at a western European country level. It stresses the growing frequency of this severe infection and the need to increase awareness among clinicians of early diagnosis and treatment, especially for patients with hematologic malignancies, BMT, and/or diabetes. As stated by Chang et al. (27) , administrative data can be regarded as useful screening tools that should be completed by medical record investigation. In fact, our study has represented an opportunity to launch in 2008 a retrospective study of zygomycosis cases identified through the PMSI and the NRCMA. This study will provide a description of zygomycosis cases and their outcome in France. In addition, it should enable us to evaluate the predictive value of administrative data for this rare disease.",
