Saudi Arabia, a relatively young economy, has fostered the most enormous growth in this religious pilgrimage history has yet seen, with aggressive and rapid modernization in all aspects of Hajj planning: Hajj facilities, procedures, healthcare and policy making are all comprehensive and on an immense scale. Still, there is no sign of slowing in the growth of pilgrim attendance. As Hajj congregations grow in the order of millions, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia rises to new challenges on colossal scales with relentless drive, challenges that are the focus of this chapter discussion.",

After a final farewell Tawaf of seven circuits around the Ka'aba, the pilgrim leaves Makkah immediately. Today we can learn much from Hajj. Pilgrimage presents a unique opportunity to study health issues in a mobile population. Due to massive scale and singular focus on one city, Hajj affords insights no other migration can yet offer (Figure 31 .2). Substantial hazards accompany such extraordinary congestion; both health hazards of performing Hajj and the public health concerns relating to the returning pilgrim.

When carrier rates become so abnormally high, outbreaks are a real public health threat. Additionally, the risk of invasive infection in carriers is compounded by a loss of upper airway epithelial integrity in the setting of upper respiratory tract infection (URTI), which is very common among pilgrims. Many outbreaks of MCD occurred over the years. It started in 1987 with a large outbreak of meningococcal meningitis serogroup A that affected many pilgrims in Makkah and internationally. Bivalent serogroups (A and C) polysaccharide meningococcal vaccine became mandatory requirement for all pilgrims (local and international) and was successful in eliminating future large outbreaks of serogroup A MCD. In the years 2000 and 2001, two large outbreaks of meningococcal meningitis serogroup W135 occurred among hajjis and their family members. A shift in the vaccine requirements for hajj from bivalent to quadrivalent (serogroups A, C, Y, W135) polysaccharide vaccine was successful in eliminating future outbreaks. Continuing concerns with the lack of efficacy of the polysaccharide meningococcal vaccine in children less than 5 years, the lack of efficacy of the polysaccharide vaccine in eliminating nasopharyngeal carriage and the need for repeat dosing every 3 to 5 years have led to greater interest in investigating the role of the newly licensed conjugated quadrivalent meningococcal vaccine (Menactera) during future hajj seasons, since the conjugated meningococcal vaccine is suppose to address all the shortcomings of the polysaccharide vaccine.",
