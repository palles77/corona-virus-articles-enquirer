Since type I FCoV infection is dominant in the field, it is necessary to develop antiviral agents and vaccines against type I FCoV infection. However, few studies have been conducted on type I FCoV. Here, we compare the effects of cholesterol on types I and II FCoV infections. When cells were treated methyl-b-cyclodextrin (MbCD) and inoculated with type I FCoV, the infection rate decreased significantly, and the addition of exogenous cholesterol to MbCD-treated cells resulted in the recovery of the infectivity of type I FCoV. Furthermore, exogenous cholesterol increased the infectivity of type I FCoV. In contrast, the addition of MbCD and exogenous cholesterol had little effect on the efficiency of type II FCoV infection. These results strongly suggest that the dependence of infection by types I and II FCoV on cholesterol differs.",

There are two genotypes/serotypes of FCoV: FCoV has been classified into types I and II based on the amino acid sequence of its S protein [10, 19] . Type II FCoV was previously suggested to be produced by recombination between type I FCoV and type II canine coronavirus (CCoV) [7, 31] . Separate from these genotypes/serotypes, FCoV has been classified into two biotypes: weakly pathogenic feline enteric coronavirus (FECV; low-virulent FCoV) and strongly pathogenic feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV; virulent FCoV) [20] . The etiology of the pathogenesis of FECV/FIPV has not yet been elucidated in detail. Two theories currently exist: an ''internal mutation theory'' and a ''circulating virulent/ avirulent theory'' [1, 3, 21] . FIPV causes a fatal disease called FIP in wild and domestic cats [20] . Although antiviral agents and vaccines against FIPV infection have been investigated, no method has yet been established for practical use.",

Differences have been identified in the following events between types I and II FCoV: replicative ability in cell lines and monocytes/macrophages [29] , the amino acid sequence and immunogenicity of the S protein [10, 19] , and the virus receptor used to enter cells & Tsutomu Hohdatsu hohdatsu@vmas.kitasato-u.ac.jp [4, 8] .

This finding demonstrates that type I FCoV needs to be examined in more detail in studies on the prevention and treatment of feline FCoV infection. However, no study using type I FCoV has been conducted to date because the propagation of type I FCoV in feline cell lines is low. Type II FCoV uses feline aminopeptidase N (fAPN) as a receptor [8, 34] , and infection of cells with this virus has been studied in detail. In contrast, the virus receptor for type I FCoV has not been identified, and the mechanism underlying cell infection has not yet been elucidated. Therefore, a basic analysis of type I FCoV is needed for the development of effective antiviral drugs against type I FCoV, which is prevalent in the field. In the present study, we discovered that the dependence of the infection on cholesterol differs between types I and II FCoV. We recently reported that the rate of inhibition of viral replication by a viroporin inhibitor differed between types I and II FCoV [28] . Based on these findings, it is desirable to use type I FCoV, in addition to type II FCoV, for the development of effective antiviral drugs. We depleted cellular cholesterol in fcwf-4 cells using MbCD. Cell membrane cholesterol is extracted by binding to the hydrophobic cores of MbCD [15] . Nystatin is frequently used, as well as MbCD, to analyze cholesteroldependent viral cell infection; however, it sequesters, rather than removes cell membrane cholesterol [32] . Moreover, strong cytotoxicity was noted in fcwf-4 cells treated with nystatin in a preliminary experiment. Therefore, we selected MbCD.",

The coronaviruses MHV and SARS-CoV of the genus Betacoronavirus belong to the second group [5, 33] , while TGEV and type II canine coronavirus (CCoV) of the genus Alphacoronavirus belong to the third group [23, 25] .

[29] suggested that fAPN functions as a virus receptor for type I FCoV, although it is very inefficient. Based on this hypothesis, type I FCoV might enter cells using fAPN and a cofactor (coreceptor). MHV fuses with the cell membrane, utilizing cholesterol after binding to carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule (CEACAM), and enters cells using cholesterol in the absence of CEACAM [33] . Cholesterol may also function as an essential cofactor in type I FCoV infection. Furthermore, the envelope cholesterol of type I FCoV has been suggested to be involved in infection, as shown in Figure 7 . Further investigations are needed in order to determine whether the envelope cholesterol of type I FCoV plays an important role in cell infection.",

In order to determine the amount of FCoV released into the supernatant of cholesterol-depleted and -replenished cells, we measured virus titers in culture supernatants using the TCID 50 assay. The titers of FCoV-I KU-2, FCoV-I Black, and FCoV-I UCD-1 in the supernatant of MbCD-treated cells were significantly decreased by approximately 100-fold(Fig. 4B), and exogenous cholesterol restored the titers of these viruses in a dose-dependent manner.

The results are shown as means \u00b1 SE (n cholesterol slightly affected the titer of FCoV-II 79-1146 in the supernatant of fcwf-4 cells. We investigated the expression of viral proteins in order to further investigate the effects of cholesterol on FCoV infectivity. The N protein levels of FCoV-I KU-2 specifically decreased in fcwf-4 cells treated with 16 mM MbCD (Fig. 5). The N protein levels of fcwf-4 cells treated with 16 mM MbCD, followed by the addition of 0.5 mg of exogenous cholesterol per ml, returned to levels similar to those in untreated-fcwf-4 cells. In contrast to type I FCoV KU-2, the depletion and replenishment of cellular cholesterol did not affect the N protein levels of FCoV-II 79-1146 in fcwf-4 cells. Facilitation of type I FCoV infection by the addition of cholesterol to fcwf-4 cells As shown in Figure 4, number of plaques caused by type-I FCoV increased in exogenous-cholesterol-treated fcwf-4 cells. In order to confirm the influence of cholesterol on type-I FCoV in cells untreated with MbCD, untreated cells were incubated with exogenous cholesterol and then inoculated with the virus. Incubation with 0.1 and 0.5 mg of exogenous cholesterol per ml significantly increased the number of plaques caused by FCoV-I KU-2, FCoV-I Black, and FCoV-I UCD-1 (",
