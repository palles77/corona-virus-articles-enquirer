(DVV) a titre reduction of 10 4fold is necessary for demonstrating efficacy in suspension tests. 1 The European draft of a guideline also requires the same reduction with identical volume ratios for confirming the virus-inactivating properties of a chemical disinfectant. 2 Besides volume ratios and soil load, the choice of test viruses is one of the most important question in addressing inactivation experiments. In North America, each virus which can cause nosocomial infection is regarded as a test virus. In Europe, model viruses have been chosen that are representative of a wide range of virus families. In Germany, poliovirus type 1 (vaccine strain LSc 2ab, formerly strain Mahoney/Pette), adenovirus type 5 (formerly adenovirus type 2), papovavirus strain 777 and vaccinia virus strain Elstree are test viruses for hand-, surface-and instrument disinfectant. 1 In Europe (prEN 14476), only the polio-and the adenoviruses are chosen. 2 Additionally, bovine parvovirus is incorporated into the guideline for the evaluation of instrument disinfectant due to its heat stability. In Germany, the Robert Koch-Institute and the DVV plan to divide the requirements of disinfection into high level (polio-and adenovirus inactivation necessary) and low level (only inactivation of bovine viral diarrhea virus and vaccinia virus necessary).",

            "text": "Human HBV belongs to the family of Hepadnviridae and is a serious viral pathogen in man that is highly contagious and can spread through blood, saliva and semen. HBV is a small, enveloped DNA virus (40 -48 nm in diameter) that replicates its partially double-stranded DNA genome through reverse transcription of an RNA intermediate. The total genome is 3020 -3320 nucleotides for the full, and 1700 -2880 nucleotides for the short, length strand, respectively. Hepadnaviruses employ an episomal covalently closed circular DNA as a nuclear transcription template and establish a DNA pool to regulate gene expression by a copy number. They are noncytopathic viruses and often establish a long-term persistent infection. In the past, a variety of approaches to study inactvation of HBV were utilised due to the lack of sufficient cell culture replication (Table II) . The chimpanzee test system allows the use of human HBV itself in the test, but the small number of available animals limits its relevance for proper testing of chemical disinfectants. The so-called indirect tests like the morphologic alteration and disintegration test (MADT), DNA polymerase inactivation and the HBsAg test do not reflect our increased knowledge of HBV. Adaption experiments with a cell culture of the hepatoma cell line HepG2 showed only a small effect. 4 A molecular approach based upon the destruction of sequential epitopes and the inability to amplify the target sequence with a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) needs further investigations. 5 Recently, the Asian tree shrew, Tupaia belangeri, was introduced as a novel animal model. 6 The primary tupaia hepatocytes are susceptible to infection with HBV and woolly monkey hepatitis B virus (WMHBV). Inactivation assays with HBV and these hepatocytes may allow disinfection experiments in the future.",

First, titration can be performed in day-old ducklings followed by bleeding nine weeks after infection and detection of DHBV DNA by Southern blotting or by PCR. However, as a large number of animals and special housing are required and the time for results is considerable, in vitro systems have been developed.

In another study, 0.5% glutaraldehyde and 1000 ppm hypochlorite were effective within one minute, whereas 1:10 quaternary ammonium, 75% ethanol and 1% anionic detergents failed to demonstrate virucidal efficacy within this exposure time. 23 Our own experiments with various 70% alcoholic solutions (ethanol, propan-1-ol, propan-2-ol) on artifically contaminated fingerpads according to E 1838-02 of American Society for Testing and Material (ASTM) 24 showed that ethanol with 30 s exposure time was superior to the other types of alcohol.

Although they are not incorporated into official guidelines by standard-setting organisations, the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has allowed label claims for human HBV after testing with DHBV since August 2000 (virucides DIS/TSS-7/1981). Even the labeling disclaimer to indicate that the disinfectant has been tested against DHBV is unnecessary. This shows the important role of animal virus testing and the use of appropiate surrogates in disinfection experiments. The World Health Organisation has recently declared that there are no new infections with the virus of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), but the possibility of its remergence still exists. Epidemiological data seem to suggest that the virus is spread by droplets or by direct and indirect contact, although airborne spread cannot be excluded. If transmission by indirect contact plays an important role, disinfection with products of proven efficacy is critical. Due to the high risk of working in the laboratory with this new coronavirus, surrogates such as bovine coronavirus or avian infectious bronchitis virus could provide acceptable replacements for the SARS virus in chemical disinfectant testing.",
