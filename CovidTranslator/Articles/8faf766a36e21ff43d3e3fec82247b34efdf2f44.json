            "text": "Prior to the World Health Organization's announcement of total eradication in 1977 [J. Am. Med. Assoc. 281 (1999) 1735], smallpox was a worldwide pathogen. Vaccinations were ceased in 1980 and now with a largely unprotected world population, smallpox is considered the ideal biowarfare agent [Antiviral Res. 57 (2002) 1]. Infection normally occurs after implantation of the virus on the oropharyngeal or respiratory mucosa [J. Am. Med. Assoc. 281 (1999) 2127]. Smallpox virus can be detected from the throats of exposed individuals prior to onset of illness and prior to the infectious stage of the illness. A rapid, sensitive real-time assay to detect Variola virus (smallpox) has been developed using the Vaccinia virus, a surrogate of smallpox, as a target. Cyanine 5 dye-labeled anti-Vaccinia antibody was used in a sandwich immunoassay to produce a fluorescent signal in the presence of the Vaccinia virus. The signal was detected using the Analyte 2000 biosensor (Research International, Monroe, WA). The Analyte 2000 uses a 635 nm laser diode to provide excitation light that is launched into a polystyrene optical waveguide. Fluorescent molecules within the evanescent wave are excited and a portion of their emission energy recouples into the waveguide. A photodiode quantifies the emission light at wavelengths between 670 and 710 nm. The biosensor was able to detect a minimum of 2.5 \u00d7 10 5 pfu/ml of Vaccinia virus in seeded throat culture swab specimens.",

            "text": "Smallpox or Variola, a member of the genus Orthopoxvirus, is a large brick-shaped DNA virus with a diameter of about 200 nm (Fenner et al., 1988b) . Smallpox has a fatality rate of 30% or more among unvaccinated persons; currently there is no known cure (Fenner et al., 1988a) . The virus has a small infectious dose and is stable in an aerosol form; therefore, an aerosol release could cause a widespread outbreak (Harper, 1961; Wehrle et al., 1970) . Although the disease smallpox has been eradicated worldwide, it is a major threat as a bioterrorism agent. It was probably first used as a biological weapon by the British during the French and Indian Wars in the mid-1700s. Contaminated blankets were distributed to the Indians to initiate outbreaks of the disease. The ensuing epidemics killed over 50% of the af-fected tribes (Breman and Henderson, 1988) . In 1980, the same year that vaccination against Variola major (smallpox) ceased globally, the Soviet government began research to grow large quantities and adapt it for use in bombs and intercontinental ballistic missiles (Alibek, 1999) . Today, with a lack of vaccinations, the long incubation period of the smallpox virus, and our rapid transportation capabilities, an outbreak could easily spread throughout the world. The recent outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is an example of such rapid worldwide dissemination. Variola virus is considered a Category A Pathogen by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), meriting this ranking because of its high case-fatality rate and transmissibility.",

(1974) were able to detect smallpox virus from the throats of these individuals prior to the actual onset of illness and the infectious stage.

Data on post exposure is sparse, but it is indicative of partial protection when vaccination occurs within 4 days of exposure (Mortimer, 2003) . If the disease state does occur after a post exposure vaccine (given within 4 days), a reduction in severity is noticeable. Persons given the vaccine more than 4 days after exposure to the disease had a high incidence of severe and sometimes fatal smallpox. Unfortunately, because of the long incubation period, people may not realize they have been exposed in time for the vaccine to be effective.

When the waveguides were completely dry, they were placed into reaction chambers made from 100 l glass capillary tubes cut to a length able to contain the waveguide.
