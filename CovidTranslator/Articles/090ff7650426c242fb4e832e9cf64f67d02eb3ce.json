It is one of the most common infections in the pediatric population and a leading cause of mortality in children in developing countries. It is usually acquired through inhalation of infected upper airway secretions, although hematogenous routes or contiguity can occur [1] [2] [3] [4] . Viruses, bacteria, fungi and other microorganisms are the main etiological agents. Though pneumonia from any organism can occur at any age, certain age groups are at higher risk for particular types of pneumonia. The vast majority of pneumonia in infancy and early childhood is of viral origin and accounts for 50% of pneumonia in children younger than 5 years [2] . The most common bacterial organism in children older than 5 years is S. pneumoniae. Mycoplasma is the most frequent cause of pneumonia in those older than 5 years of age group [2, 4, 5] . The immunological status of the child and the infectious agent also have an important role in the clinical and radiological aspects of the disease [5, 6] . This paper reviews the most common causes of pulmonary infection in children, emphasizing the imaging findings.",

            "text": "Viral infections occur after the inhalation of infected aerosols. Usually the infection begins in the nasopharynx and upper respiratory tract and migrates to the small airways and alveoli. The clinical presentation of viral pneumonia varies greatly depending on the infecting agent, the age and the immune status of the host [4, 5] . Influenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), adenovirus and parainfluenza are common causes of viral pneumonia in children. In premature-born infants with lung disease, RSV can be devastating. Recently, human metapneumovirus has been recognized as a pathogen. Its ubiquity suggests that it is as important as RSV, and studies suggest its incidence is as high as that of RSV. Nearly 100% of children ages 5-10 years are seropositive [7] . Herpes simplex virus is rare, affecting mostly newborns. Patients with immunodeficiency syndromes are also at risk of pneumonia caused by other pathogens such as cytomegalovirus [5] . Influenza virus and RSV infect the pneumocytes, causing diffuse alveolar damage. The alveoli are infiltrated with neutrophils, and mononuclear cells with fibrin and edematous fluid [1, 4] . In addition, the submucosa presents with hyperemia with focal hemorrhage and edema. The small bronchial diameters and poorly developed airways of the smallest children combined with their abundant mucus production cause the characteristic abnormalities revealed by chest radiograph [4, 5] . CT is sometimes indicated in complicated cases of diffuse disease [2] .",

In the next stage, neutrophils and fibrin material fill the alveoli, and massive extravasation occurs through interalveolar pores (pores of Kohn), producing a homogeneous opacity. Fibrin and exudative cells accumulate, appearing on radiographs as a clear zone adjoining the alveolar and acinar cells [9, 12, 13] . If the process extends to the pleural space, associated pleural effusion is present.",

Streptococcus pneumoniae is a common infectious agent but pathogens like Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus and gram-negative enteric bacteria can cause similar clinical syndromes. The typical chest radiograph reveals homogeneous or fluffy lobar consolidation, but diffuse bilateral inhomogeneous opacities extending peripherally also can be seen, both with and without associated pleural fluid (Fig. 6) . As opposed to the other bacterial pneumonias, Round pneumonia has an atypical radiographic appearance of pulmonary bacterial infections. It is caused most often by S. pneumoniae. It is rare in adults and occurs in less than 1% of children (usually younger than 8 years of age) but is seen more frequently in the young because of the underdeveloped pores of Kohn and the absence of canals of Lambert characteristic of this age group. The radiographic finding usually occurs early in the disease course, and for this reason cough and respiratory symptoms can be absent in the initial presentation. The usual presentation is an area of focal nodular consolidation, often solitary, with well-defined borders and mass effect. It frequently occurs in the lower lobes, posteriorly (>80%) and inferiorly (>70%) [14] (Fig. 7) .",

Reticulonodular infiltrate in one lobe is a usual presentation of mycoplasmal pneumonia.

Many of these features can be seen in viral pneumonia as well. To distinguish these pneumonias one needs to recognize the clinical features that don't appear to match the radiograph, such as the degree of respiratory distress or the unusual laboratory findings. For example, Chlamydia trachomatis (or chlamydophila) affects young infants in the first 4 months, and frequently a history of conjunctivitis and a staccato cough are observed. The history will reveal a vaginal delivery and a mother with vulvovaginitis. Chest radiograph shows bilateral reticular interstitial involvement, hyperinflation and bronchial wall thickening.",

Regardless of the immunodeficiency cause, the most common complications are infections caused by bacterial, viral or opportunistic pathogens [5, [33] [34] [35] . Immunodeficiency can be divided into major groups of primary and secondary. A simple model of the immune system is that it is mediated by two major mechanisms: humoral and cellular. Defective development of B cells results in humoral immunity abnormalities, while defective development of T cells causes cellular immunity problems. Children with impairment of cellular or humoral immune mechanisms or both experience a higher propensity for specific infections. Humoral immune impairments usually result in bacterial infections, while cellmediated immune impairments make children more prone to opportunistic, viral and mycobacterial infections [34] . This applies to children with primary immunodeficiency syndromes and secondary immunodeficiency diseases, including AIDS. Most primary immunodeficiencies are humoral deficiencies, with IgA deficiency, X-linked agammaglobulinemia and common-variable immunodeficiency the best known examples. These children are prone to repeated bacterial infections with associated pneumonia leading to postinfectious bronchiectasis (Fig. 18) . A much smaller group of primary immunodeficiencies is caused by changes in cellular immunity (DiGeorge syndrome and severe combined immunodeficiency) or in phagocyte activity like chronic granulomatous disease. DiGeorge syndrome, which is also called thymic aplasia or hypoplasia, is a typical example of a primary T cell deficiency with abnormal development of the thymus, parathyroid glands and heart. Children with this syndrome are susceptible to opportunistic organisms and to graft-versus-host disease from blood transfusions [34] .",

Vertical transmission is the usual form of infection in the pediatric population. Lung infection is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality, causing 50 percent of deaths. Viral and bacterial pneumonia are the most frequent infections at diagnosis [3, 42] . The most frequent agents are Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, respiratory syncytial virus and adenovirus. Children are prone to having severe presentations, and bacterial pneumonias are usually associated with cavitations, abscesses and empyema [40] . Children with AIDS are also susceptible to fungal and mycobacterial infections. Pneumocystis jirovecii is the most common opportunistic infection in infected babies without prophylaxis. P. jirovecii has a high mortality rate during the initial episode. The most common chest radiograph and CT findings are diffuse reticular interstitial opacities that can progress to massive alveolar consolidations resulting in acute respiratory distress syndrome in infants (Fig. 20) . Postinfection cavitations and bronchiectasis are typical after recurrent infections. Cryptococcus neoformans infection is rare and has unusual presentations in HIV-infected children. The spectrum of disease ranges from asymptomatic pulmonary lesions to disseminated infection with necrotizing pneumonia, pleural effusion and meningoencephalitis [43] (Fig. 21) .",

After engraftment (during the first 30 days) profound neutropenia and mucosal injury lead to severe immune suppression. Children at this time are very susceptible to all organisms fungal, bacterial and viral. As the child's neutropenia recovers the immune suppression related to antirejection medication leads to impairment of humoral and cellular immunity (days 30 to 100). These children have a high incidence of cytomegalovirus and RSV. After 100 days the children have near normal immune function and pneumonia is less common. Fungal organisms are associated with very high mortality, with Aspergillus and Candida the most common. It should be noted that children might not demonstrate fever or an elevated white blood cell count. CT is frequently used to monitor these children when there is a high index of suspicion for disease. Fungal infections in particular demonstrate small, ill-defined nodules with or without surrounding ground-glass opacity. Bacterial infections have features similar to those found in the immunecompetent child [44] .",

The identification of a specific organism is almost never possible from imaging alone. However, by combining imaging and clinical information, the differential diagnoses can be generated. Chest radiographs remain the mainstay of pneumonia imaging, supplemented with sonography and CT for specific indications. Investigation of specific organisms using image-guided sampling and serological determinations is important in designing therapy. During treatment the radiologist can recognize complications such as cavitation, abscess and empyema. The role of image-guided intervention is beyond the scope of this paper, but in many centers the radiologist might be asked to address each of these complications. ",
