The optimal growth temperature was 300 C, at which temperature cells underwent one division at approximate 2-day intervals until they reached a tight confluency leading to density-dependent growth inhibition D. When seeded with 8 million cells/25-cm' flask, i. e. 3.2 x 10 ~ cells/era ~, this occurred within 6-7 days, at which time the cell number/era 2 ranged between 2.6 and 3 million cells with each cell dividing about 3 times. Once the plateau was reached, some cells began to degenerate, rather slowly during the first month and more rapidly thereafter. At 330 C, the decrease in viable cell number became severe after 3 weeks, with 15.4 million remaining on day 28 and none remaining on day 60. At 200 C, the kinetics of growth was about half that at 30 ~ C, which is consistent with such biological mechanisms; the final cell harvest, however, was unmodified, and the same final result was obtained at 15 ~ C. At 7 and 10o C, EPC cells survived but did not divide. They remained perfectly viable, and when transferred to 300 C on day 60, underwent the same growth as previously reported at this temperature, exhibiting the same susceptibility to viruses as that of Plaling efficiencg.",
