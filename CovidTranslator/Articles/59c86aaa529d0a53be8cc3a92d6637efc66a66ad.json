The purpose of this study was to assess whether the level of anti-C. parvum IgG antibodies transferred through colostrum from dams to newborn calves impacts the susceptibility to cryptosporidiosis. A number of 50 dams and their healthy newborns were included in the study. Colostrum samples were collected within 12 h after birth and anti-C. parvum IgG antibody levels were determined by single radial immunodiffusion. The health condition of the newborns was daily monitored, and fecal samples were collected at first diarrheic episode of a calf. In all dams, the anti-C. parvum IgG antibody concentration in colostrum varied between 570 and 4070 mg/dl; in dams who gave birth to calves with diarrhea and were C. parvum-positive, the antibody concentration in colostrum varied between 680 and 3680 mg/dl (Table 1 ). The point-biserial correlation showed a negative correlation between the levels of anti-C. parvum antibodies and manifestation of clinical cryptosporidiosis (r=-0.425). Our findings highlight the importance of IgG levels in colostrum received by neonatal calves during their first day of life for prevention of C. parvum infection.",

The parasite infects the digestive tract of the major vertebrate groups, including humans, livestock (cattle, sheep, goats, horses and poultry), pets (dogs and cats), etc. (Chalmers and Katzer, 2013) . In cattle, Cryptosporidium spp. infection was first reported in the early 1970s (Panciera et al., 1971) . Of the four species commonly found in cattle (C. parvum, C. bovis, C. ryanae and C. andersoni), only C. parvum is generally associated with clinical disease, especially in neonatal calves (Fayer, 2010; Sunnotel et al., 2006; Thompson, 2008) . C. ryanae and C. bovis usually infect older calves and young stock, and C. andersoni mainly adults (Langkjaer et al., 2007) . Experimental infections have been carried out and it has been shown that infected animals shed oocysts with no clinical manifestations of the disease (Thompson, 2008) . The importance of C. parvum as an etiological agent of gastroenteritis-like syndrome in dairy calves during their first weeks of life has been confirmed (Sunnotel et al., 2006) . The main clinical signs are diarrhea, dehydration, weakness, anorexia, abdominal pain and mortality (Fayer, 2010) .",

Colostrum samples were transported and further processed at room temperature and fat was removed through centrifugation. An amount of 3 \u03bcl of each reference standard was placed into the first wells and the same amount of colostrum sample in the remaining wells, by using a 3 \u03bcl precision pipette. The plates were covered and left right-side up at room temperature for 24 h. At 24 h, the diameter of each ring was read by direct measure on the plate and a standard curve was established. The diameters of the reference standards versus their concentrations were plotted on the graph paper provided in the kit.

The analysis was performed using the commercially available dip-stick assay (BIO K156 -Tetra Calf Scours, BioX Diagnostics S.A, Belgium), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Approximately 0.1 g of feces from each sample was diluted with the reagent provided in the kit. The test strip was dipped into the homogeneous suspension and read after 3 and 10 min of contact. The presence of control line confirmed the validity of the test. Positive results were read as follows: red strip -Rotavirus-positive, blue strip -E. coli F5-positive, yellow strip -Corona virus-positive and green strip -Cryptosporidium positive. There were no mixed infections from the other pathogens tested.",
