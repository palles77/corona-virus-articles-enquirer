            "text": "Hepatitis E virus (HEV) has recently emerged to cause chronic infection in some immunosuppressed individuals, including extrahepatic manifestations in acute and chronic patients. Mammalian MAPK-JNK1/2 is expressed in hepatocytes, which is known to be involved in anti-apoptotic signaling pathway for the establishment of persistent infection. Though in vitro modulation of cellular MAPK-ERK cascade by HEV-ORF3 protein is suggested to have a role in host pathobiology, activation of the JNK module has not been studied so far. In this report, we have shown for the first time, evidence of MAPK-JNK1/2 activation by HEV-ORF3, using viral replicon as well as expression vector in human hepatoma cells. Phospho-ELISA based relative quantitaion has demonstrated *54% and *66% phosphorylation of JNK1/2 in replicon-RNA and ORF3-vector DNA transfected cells, respectively. Our finding however, suggests further molecular studies to validate a role of JNK1/2 in HEV pathogenesis.",

            "text": "Hepatitis E virus (HEV) causes acute hepatitis E, in general as well as chronic infection in some cases of immunocompromised individuals (Holla et al. 2013; Parvez 2013a) . HEV infection accounts for global mortality rate of *2 %, including fulminant liver failure in 20-30 % of pregnant women (Purcell and Emerson 2008) . Moreover, growing evidences have shown an emerging neuropathic manifestation of the virus in acute and chronic patients, worldwide (Kamar et al. 2011; Tse et al. 2012; Sharma et al. 2013; Peng et al. 2014; Parvez 2014) . Human HEV has four recognized genotypes 1, 2, 3 and 4, and of these, HEV3 and HEV4 are recently implicated in the autochthonous sporadic cases of hepatitis E (Parvez 2013a) . HEV is a small nonenveloped virus with a plus sense, single-stranded RNA genome that comprises of three open reading frames (ORFs 1, 2 and 3). While ORF1 encodes the nonstructural polyprotein, ORF2 codes for the viral capsid. In animal cells, the ORF3 translates into a very small protein (a.a. 114), phosphorylated at a single serine residue (Ser80) (Jameel et al. 1996) . The conserved proline-rich (PXXP) motif in the C-terminal part of ORF3 is recognized to bind with SH3 domains of host cell-signaling protein modules (Korkaya et al. 2001) . HEV-ORF3 has been further demonstrated to have some host-regulatory functions (Holla et al. 2013) , including mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)-ERK1/2 pathway, in vitro (Korkaya et al. 2001; Kar-Roy et al. 2004 ) as well as crucial in establishing in vivo infection (Emerson et al. 2006) .",

In contrast to activation of ERK, upstream signal transduction mechanisms for the JNK is generally, less understood. Of the three known mammalian JNK genes, JNK1 (SAPKc) and JNK2 (SAPK a ) are expressed in hepatocytes that are known to be involved in anti-apoptotic or pro-cell survival signaling pathway for the establishment of persistent infection (Malhi and Gores 2008) . Further, mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), the prototype coronavirus (CoV) is reported to have potentiality to chronically infect the central nervous system in rodents (Maeda et al. 1995) . In addition, Mizutani et al. (2005) have demonstrated a role of JNK cascade during persistent SARS-CoV infection in cultured cells. Though in vitro interaction of viral ORF3 with ERK1/2 cascade has indicated its possible role in host pathobiology (Korkaya et al. 2001; Kar-Roy et al. 2004) , involvement of the JNK1/2 has not been described so far. To explore this, we therefore looked into modulation of MAPK-JNK phosphoprotein by HEV-ORF3, if any, in cultured hepatoma cells.",

The plate was sealed and incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C. After washing, the cells were incubated with 100 ll of diluted secondary antibodies for 1 h at RT. After a wash with phosphate buffer saline (PBS), 100 ll of pre-warmed developing solution (DS) was added, and the plate was incubate for up to 20 min at RT in dark until the color developed into medium-to-dark blue. Immediately, 100 ll of stop solution (SS) was added per well that changed the color to yellow, and the absorbance was read at 450 nm (ELex800, BioTek). The colored solution was removed and the plate was washed once with WB and distilled water, and air-dried at RT for 5 min. The cells were incubated with 100 ll of cell staining buffer (CSB) for 30 min at RT, followed by washing twice with water. The cells were then incubated with 100 ll of 1 % SDS (w/v, in PBS) at RT for 1 h on a rocker, and read at 595 nm. Finally, the antibody reading was normalized to the relative cell number by dividing readings of OD 450 by OD 595 , for each well of Set-I and Set-II. The relative quantitation of JNK phosphorylation was determined by normalizing the phospho-JNK1/2 antibody ratio (Set-I; OD 450 :OD 595 ) to the total-JNK1/2 antibody ratio (Set-II; OD 450 :OD 595 ) under the same experimental condition. The above experiment was also performed in a time-course manner as well as under serum-free condition.",

            "text": "Interactions or/and modulations of host proteins by vector-expressed ORF3 has been widely studied (Panteva et al. 2003; Holla et al. 2013) . Of these, a detailed study of regulation of MAPK-ERK cascade in ORF3-expessing stable non-hepatic cells has been reported (Korkaya et al. 2001; Kar-Roy et al. 2004 ). However, this finding has not been confirmed either in ORF3-expressing hepatocytes or HEV-replicating/infected cells. Moreover, there are no data available so far, on MAPK-JNK modulation by HEV. Therefore, in this report, we, first, utilized the ex vivo genomic-replicon/hepatoma cell system that could mimic the in vivo HEV infection of hepatocytes. In the HEV SAR 55 -replicon system, the RNA replication is manifested on day 4 and peaks on day 6 that declines subsequently (Emerson et al. 2004) . However, in the present time-course assay, the optimal JNK phosphorylation was observed on day 4 (p.t.). RNA viruses are known to modulate cellular MAPK pathways, including ERK and JNK cascades, in vivo. Positive immunestaining for ORF2 and ORF3 co-expressions in HEV RNA-transfected cells on day 4, confirmed an active viral replication (Fig. 1b) . Further, the ELISA-based relative quantitation of JNK1/2 phosphoprotein in the same culture showed an optimal phosphorylation on day 4. The JNK1/2 phosphorylation in WT-RNA receiving cells was elevated by about 54 % as compared to GAD-control (Fig. 1c) . These experiments, when repeated in serumfree medium under the same conditions did not show significant differences in the results (data not shown).",

However, activation of phospho-JNK1/2 by vector-expressed ORF3 was approximately 22 % higher than that of viral mRNA-translated ORF3 (Fig. 3) . Notably, we had up to 50 % replicon transfection efficiency compared to 18-20 % transfections achieved with expression vectors (data not shown). However, there was much higher production of ORF3 by the customized expression vector as compared to the genomic replicon.

Of these, the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-Nef, the herpesvirus-TIP, the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-latent membrane proteins 1 and 2A (Collette and Olive 1997) were reported previously. Moreover, the hepatitis C virus (HCV)-core (Hayashi et al. 2000; Fukuda et al. 2001 ) and NS5A proteins (Tan et al. 1999 ) as well as the HBV-HBx protein has also been shown to activate the MAPK pathway (Benn and Schneider 1994) . Further, it has been reported that MAPK-JNK1/2 pathway is required for robust replication and/ or persistence of encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) (Steer et al. 2006) , coxsackievirus B3 (CVB) (Si et al. 2005) , MHV (Maeda et al. 1995) , SARS-CoV (Mizutani et al. 2005 ) and enterovirus 71 (EV 71) (Peng et al. 2014 ). In a recent study, the HBV surface protein (HBsAg) has been demonstrated to selectively interfere the JNK1/2 pathway and provide a mechanism by which HBV can maintain its persistence in infected cells (Wang et al. 2013 ). In addition to this, involvement of HCV NS3 and NS5A (nonstructural) as well as core and E2 (structural) proteins in JNK pathway is also proposed to mediate pathogenesis of chronic hepatitis C (Rau et al. 2013) .",
