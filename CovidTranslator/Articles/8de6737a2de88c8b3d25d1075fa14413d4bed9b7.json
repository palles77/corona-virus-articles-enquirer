Why are they important specifically to American dentists?",

These diseases arrive with their own costs to a person's capacity to function in the economic marketplace, to attend school or even just to maintain a minimal functional quality of life. And these conditions often present new and varying oral manifestations that have their own costs and impact on daily functioning. And it is not just communicable diseases that take a toll. Chronic diseases occur here and abroad that double the burden for the world's communities as they try to feed and educate their own and to sustain viable economies. Without health, education and economic vitality, populations become economically as well as politically unstable, leading to disorganization and dissolution of established institutions, anomic individualistic behaviors, violence and conflict and, inevitably, affecting relations between and among nations.

We cannot risk this window of opportunity to exert credible leadership. The specific case for increasing our national investments in health research is a special responsibility of health professionals. It is not the sole responsibility of patients and other stakeholders who are necessary and critical partners involved in the development of a public policy agenda. The moral leadership must come from those with the most scientific expertise, and health professionals have that as their essential credential. If health professionals can and will organize themselves to address this issue of global health and associated health research and training, they could be effective and normative role models for others. The credibility of this unique collective across all health professions could create a powerful force for changing the downward spiral in global health and, at the same time, serve to protect the health and enhance the well-being of our own people.",

By advocating for a greater investment in global health research and associated capacity building for research (that is, strengthening the research labor force and providing adequate research infrastructure) in a manner that is inclusive of oral health research, this nation will be able to generate and share data that will enable and drive strategic and evidence-based interventions to enhance health and oral health.",

Global collaborations in health and health research will help other nations see us in a new light. Health care and health research are a form of diplomacy. Science is the bridge between countries that can make the difference. Science can enable people to work together effectively for common and mutual benefit, removing the barriers of inequality, moving toward social justice globally and finding new ways to prevent, diagnose and treat diseases, not only in the world's poorest countries but also in our own as well. As Michael Leavitt, secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, testified before the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, Education and Related Agencies in May, \"Health holds a special place as a foreign-policy tool. It is a universal and fundamental desire of all people, and is a common concern among almost every electorate in the world.\" 7 Secretary Leavitt should be lauded for his leadership in helping to establish the Latin American Health Initiative, which will begin in 2008, in no small part because oral health care and oral disease prevention are among the services provided in this inaugural health services package.",

We need to develop stronger research training initiatives to enhance the quality and quantity of researchers who are culturally competent to work across international borders. We need to form even stronger alliances across the oral health and health care professions to influence the public will-and to help translate that will to decision makers who can commit needed resources for global health research and the infrastructure that supports that research.
