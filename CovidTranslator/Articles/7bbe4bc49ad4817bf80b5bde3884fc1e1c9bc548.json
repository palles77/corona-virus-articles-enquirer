Rotavirus-specific IgM ASC occurred by post-inoculation day (PID) 3, and numbers peaked in spleen and MLN tissues by PID 7 and in intestinal LP by PID 7-14. Numbers of rotavirus specific IgA and IgG ASC in these tissues peaked at PID 14-2 1. Rotavirus specific IgA ASC were predominant in the gut and IgA to IgG rotavirus specific ASC ratios were highest for all rotavirus antigen coatings in the gut LP. However, the relative ratios of specific IgA to IgG ASC were lower (ratios of 5 to 7) against combined structural and nonstructural viral antigens (rotavirus-infected fixed cell ELISPOT plates) than ratios ( 13 to 46) against only viral structural antigens (rotavirus-coated ELISPOT plates). indicating that there were proportionately more specific IgG ASC to the nonstructural viral antigens in the LP, the tissue adjacent to the site of rotavirus replication in the intestine. In the node cells (spleen and MLN) rotavirus-specific IgA to IgG ASC ratios were lowest and against the various ELISPOT rotavirus coatings ranged from 0.7 to 4. Gnotobiotic piglets inoculated at different ages with porcine rotaviruses generally showed similar specific immunoglobulin",

Although challenge of SB 1 A or Gottfried rotavirus-inoculated pigs with SB 1 A (G4P7) or Gottfiied (G4P6) rotavirus revealed a high degree of protection from diarrhea and virus shedding, greater numbers of specific IgM ASC were observed in spleen after challenge of SBlA-inoculated pigs with Gottfried rotavirus (same G type, distinct P type).

In these and calf models of rotavirus infection, neutralizing local antibodies to VP4 and VP7 provided protection against rotavirus infection localized in the epithelium of the small intestine (Offit and Clark, 1985a,b; Saif, 1987; Kapikian and Chanock, 1990) . Limited studies in mice have also demonstrated a role for cell-mediated immunity in rotavirus infections (Offit and Dudzik, 1989 ) . Merchant et al. ( 1991) and Shaw et al. ( 199 1, 1992) characterized the mucosal antibody responses of mice to a heterologous infection with simian rotavirus (RRV) using an enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISPOT) assay to enumerate antibody-secreting cells ( ASC) isolated from different tissues. In their study, ASC isolated from the small intestine lamina propria (LP) secreted predominantly rotavirus-specific immunoglobulin A (IgA). This extended previous tindings that antibodies in fecal and nasal secretions of calves recovered from a bovine rotavirus infection were primarily IgA (Saif, 1987) . Similar antibody responses were reported in rabbits orally inoculated with rabbit rotavirus (Conner et al., 199 1) . In addition, predominantly IgA ASC were identified in the small intestinal LP of pigs recovered from infection with the enteric coronavirus, trans-missible gastroenteritis virus, but were detectable only in low numbers in the LP of pigs exposed to the antigenically related porcine respiratory coronavirus which replicates in the respiratory tract but not the gut (VanCott et al., 1993 (VanCott et al., , 1994 .",

The rabbit model suffers similar limitations in the ability to induce clinical disease (Conner et al., 199 1) . Pigs are monogastric and closely resemble humans physiologically (Phillips and Tumbleson, 1986 ) . The porcine placenta prevents the transfer of maternal antibodies; hence, newborn pigs are agammaglobulinemic but immunocompetent (Porter, 1979 ) . Thus, studies of rotavirus infection in gnotobiotic pigs permit basic investigations of the ontogeny of the immune response and evaluation of true primary antibody responses. In our laboratory, gnotobiotic pigs have been used to study the pathogenesis and immune responses to human rotaviruses (Wyatt et al., 1980; Schaller et al., 1992) as well as to homologous porcine rotaviruses (Bohl et al., 1984) . Gnotobiotic pigs present advantages over mice and rabbits as models for rotavirus infection, mostly owing to their extended susceptibility (up to 6 weeks of age) to infection and disease with porcine (Bohl et al,, 1984) and human rotaviruses (Wyatt et al., 1980; Schaller et al., 1992; Saif and Chen, unpublished data, 1992 ) .",

The tests were performed with IgG-secreting hybridomas, whose specificities were examined with both goat-anti-mouse IgM and goat-anti-mouse IgG coated plates. No spots were generated in the anti-IgM wells (data not shown). By incubating hybridomas secreting antibodies specific to group A rotavirus VP6 and VP7, as well as Gottfried and OSU VP4 in wells coated with either rotavirus antigens or anti-mouse IgG, the effectiveness and specificity of the antigen coating was verified. The ratios of spots observed in the antigen-coated wells to spots in the anti-IgG wells were similar and ranged from 0.78 to 1.14, demonstrating that all hybridomas secreting IgG could be measured on the appropriate antigencoated plates. For example, hybridomas secreting antibodies specific to VP4, VP6 and VP7 reacted with the corresponding antigens in plates coated with virusinfected acetone-fixed cells (viral structural proteins including VP4, 6, 7 and nonstructural proteins), purified double-shelled viral particles (DS) containing structural proteins VP4,7 and also VP6 exposed on any broken particles (Shaw et al., 1991) , and partially purified (PP) viral particles (structural proteins including VP4, 6, 7). The anti-VP6 hybridoma reacted with the DS viral preparations of all three group A rotavirus strains. However, the purified single-shelled particles (SS) (structural proteins including VP6, but lacking VP4, VP7) of Gottfried, SBlA or OSU (data not shown) reacted only with the anti-VP6 secreting hybridoma (RG25A 10 ) . Baculovirus-expressed Gottfried or OSU VP4 reacted only with the hybridomas (RG24B9 and R03F1, respectively) secreting antibody to the corresponding antigen, although the capture ability of the OSU VP4 protein coating for hybridoma R03Fl was only about 80% (0.78/ 1.04) of that detected using the purified OSU viral particles.

The MNC were assayed for numbers of ASC on plates containing Gottfried rotavirus-infected fixed cells. Numbers of pigs tested at each time point for the different tissues varied from n = 1 (3 PID) to n = 5 ( 14 PID) for the MLN and spleen. At least two to three pigs were tested at all other time points for all tissues. Reasons for this variability in pig numbers included the difficulty in isolating the MNC from the LP of pigs in our initial experiments which used MNC from MLN and spleen at peak response days (PID 7 and 14) for standardization of the ELIS-POT. Rotavirus-specific ASC of each isotype were detected by the ELISPOT from PID 7 through 29 in all four tissues (Fig. 1 ). In the negative control pigs, no viralspecific ASC were detected from the LP, MLN and spleens examined at 2 1 days of age (data not shown). Also, no spots were evident in uninfected control wells examined at each time point for each tissue and antibody isotype. Rotavirus-specific IgM ASC appeared earlier in the MLN (PID 3) than in spleens (PID 3 was not tested for the LP because the severe pathological damage to the small intestine at this time made it impossible to isolate the MNC numbers needed for the ELISPOT). Numbers of virus-specific IgM ASC peaked earliest in the MLN and spleen at PID 7, but in the LP of small intestine at PID 7 to 14. By PID 7, the numbers of specific IgM ASC were predominant in all tissues, except the duodenum (Fig. I) . The IgM ASC response was transient and declined in all tissues by PID 21. The specific IgA ASC numbers peaked in the MLN, LP and spleens by 14 to 2 1 PID. In the LP, the IgA ASC were predominant from PID 14 to 29 and were higher than in MLN and spleens. The virus-specific IgA and IgG ASC responses were similar in MLN and spleens. Overall, the numbers of virusspecific IgG ASC were highest in the spleen and duodenum at PID 14, but the IgG ASC made up a greater proportion of the ASC response in the spleen and MLN versus the LP. In contrast, in the LP, the numbers of virus-specific IgA ASC remained higher than IgG or IgM ASC after PID 14. Moreover, the ASC responses in the spleen were the most transient and declined sharply by PID 2 1.",

The numbers of IgA ASC detected on the fixed cells also were higher than against the other coatings. (ii) The numbers of specific ASC that were detected using the PP and SS rotavirus antigen coatings were similar within a tissue type, whereas the numbers of specific ASC against the DS coating were more variable. (iii) The highest number of rotavirus-specific IgA ASC were in the LP of the small intestine as measured against any of the virus coatings.

Mucosal immunity is important for protection against enteric pathogens (McGhee et al., 1992) . However, investigations of protective mechanisms against rotavirus infections often focused on serum antibody responses which may not correlate with enteric protection; only a few researchers investigated the role of coproantibodies in recovery from rotavirus infection (Riepenhoff-Talty et al., 198 1; Saif, 1987; Grimwood et al., 1988; Conner et al., 199 1) . Research groups have employed various techniques to study the local enteric mucosal antibody response to rotavirus infection. Those techniques included using ELISA to detect antibody isotypes in feces from humans (Riepenhoff-Talty et al., 198 1; Grimwood et al., 1988) ) calves (Saif, 1987 ) and rabbits (Conner et al., 199 1 ), identification of specific antibody-producing cells in intestinal tissue sections by immunohistochemistry in a mouse model (Dharakul et al., 1988) , and counting the specific ASC isolated from mouse lamina propria (LP) using an ELISPOT assay (Merchant et al., 199 1; Shaw et al., 199 1, 1992) . All of these studies confirmed the predominance of specific IgA antibody responses in the mucosal secretions or intestinal tissues. Our ASC data in pigs exposed to porcine rotaviruses corroborate and extend these earlier findings.",

However, the following trends were evident. The data shown in Table 3 and Figs. 1 (C) and 1 (D) demonstrate that rotavirus-specilic IgA ASC in the small intestine LP, especially the duodenum, represent the highest response (the mean number of spots was 65 IgA ASC per 5 x lo5 MNC, n = 6, in Fig. 1 (C) by PID 14-2 1. Further, in the intestinal LP of pigs, the ratio of the numbers of structural viral antigen-specific IgA ASC to those of specific IgG ASC ranged from 13 to 46 (Table 3) . Although this ratio was higher than the LP ASC data (IgA/IgG= 10) from the mouse model employed by Merchant et al. ( 199 I) , their results were based on a heterologous simian rotavirus infection in mice. However, their findings concur that specific IgA ASC represent the greatest population of ASC in the LP of the small intestine. In our studies, the magnitude of the IgA ASC response in the gut LP to the structural and nonstructural antigens of rotavirus was about 8-14 times greater than for the MLN and spleen (Table 3) . Although the ASC numbers we detected in gnotobiotic pigs were less than the ASC numbers reported in mice exposed to rotavirus by Merchant et al. ( 1991) , it is possible that the immune stimulus induced by the normal gut flora in conventional animals in comparison with gnotobiotic ones may play a role in the overall magnitude of the ASC numbers. A similar phenomenon (reduced numbers of ASC or Ig synthesis) was observed in the nasal mucosa or Peyer's patches of gnotobiotic versus conventional mice (McClelland, 1976; Ichimiya et al., 1991) .",

            "text": "In gnotobiotic pigs, the kinetics of the specific IgM ASC response showed a different pattern from the IgA ASC response. The specific IgM ASC were detected in MLN as early as PID 3. The highest numbers of virus-specific IgM ASC (mean 49.8 IgM ASC per 5 x lo5 MNC, n=4) were measured in the spleen at PID 7 ( Fig. 1 (B ) ). Similar results (82 IgM ASC per 1 O6 MNC ) were reported by Kaila et al. ( 1992) using ELISPOT to measure ASC among circulating blood lymphocytes from children infected with human rotavirus. Our data demonstrate the specific IgM ASC reached a peak and were predominant in the MLN and spleen by PID 7 (Figs. 1 (A) and 1 (B) ). The IgM ASC peaked in the duodenum and ileum by PID 14 but were fewer in number than IgA ASC (Figs. 1 (C) and 1 (D ) ). By PID 14, the specific IgM ASC decreased in the MLN and spleen similar to the pattern for ASC in human blood observed by Kaila et al. ( 1992 ) . Specific IgG ASC and IgA ASC in both MLN and spleen peaked at 14 PID. In the intestinal LP, the IgA ASC were predominant at all time points except PID 7 in ileum. We also observed an interesting difference in the immune responses in the LP to antigens of rotavirus (Table 3 ). The numbers of specific IgA ASC in the duodenum to total (structural and nonstructural) viral antigens (the rotavirus-infected fixed cells) were about seven times greater than the numbers of IgG ASC; in contrast, the IgA ASC numbers in the duodenum to only viral structural antigens (PP, DS or SS virus) were approximately 40 times higher than the corresponding IgG ASC numbers. Also, the IgA ASC response in ileum to total structural and nonstructural viral antigens was about live-fold higher than the IgG ASC response, and the average ratio of IgA to IgG in the ileum against the viral structural antigens was about 18. This phenomenon suggests a proportionately greater contribution of IgG ASC responses to the nonstructural rotaviral antigens adjacent to the site of rotavirus replication in the small intestine.",

Using the ELISPOT assay, we detected very few positive ASC reactive with baculovirusexpressed VP4 in each tissue tested. Because VP4 constitutes only about 1.5% of the mass of the viral particle, it is not surprising that the specific ASC response to VP4 is very low. Our data showed that numbers of VP4-specific ASC generally constitute about 1.3-4.89/o of the total virus-specific ASC; moreover, VP4-specilic IgA ASC outnumbered IgG ASC in the tissues examined, especially in the LP of the duodenum. This is in agreement with observations for mice by Shaw et al. ( 199 1, 1992 ) , whose data showed that the VP4-specific ASC were less than 2% of rotavirus-specific ASC response in mice infected with a heterologous simian SA 11 rotavirus. In gnotobiotic pigs, we previously found partial protection of SB 1 A-inoculated pigs from challenge with OSU porcine rotavirus (common VP4 type (P7),distinctVP7 type (G4 forSBlA, G5 forOSU)) (Hoshinoet al., 1988) . Although the VPCspecilic ASC responses occurred at relatively low levels, evidence of protection against OSU challenge in pigs suggests that the VP4-specific immune responses still play an important role in intestinal mucosal immunity to rotavirus infection. However, such protection may not be as efficient as that induced by the other major outer capsid neutralizing antigen, VP7.",

            "text": "Our ELISPOT assay conducted using hybridoma cells secreting rotavirus-specilic antibodies showed that VP6 specific hybridoma cells were able to efficiently detect the corresponding antigen of the three group A rotaviruses based on the viral antigen coatings of partially purified viral particles and fixed infected-cells, as well as SS particles. However, we also found that the VP6 specific hybridoma cells reacted with DS viral preparations (Table 1) . This result confirms the same phenomenon observed by Shaw et al. ( 199 1) and suggests that DS viral particles used for coating the plates became partially degraded, resulting in exposure of VP6 on the surface of such particles. As also reported by Shaw et al. ( 1991) , generally our data confirm that the various preparations of rotavirus structural antigens (PP, DS and SS) for the coatings generated similar numbers of ASC within a tissue type except for lower numbers of IgA ASC in the duodenum against the DS coating (Table 3 ) . Because VP6 is the predominant protein in rotavirus particles, it is not unexpected that the specific ASC responses to other structural proteins such as VP4 can be eclipsed by the large quantity of VP6 specific ASC. Therefore, the positive ASC responses detected in DS coated plates probably included the VP6-specific ASC as well as the ASC elicited by the outer shell proteins, VP4 and VP7. Although 96-well plates have been used routinely for ELIS-POT assays including the enumeration of specific isotypes of ASC in most tissues, when VP4 ASC are measured which constitute a very small proportion of the total ASC population, such plates may be not efficient enough for more accurate assessment of the more limited numbers of MNC secreting antibodies to VP4. Table 2 shows that the susceptibility of gnotobiotic pigs to rotavirus (both clinical signs and virus shedding) lasted at least through 25 days of age. Further, generally similar response patterns were noted for the specific ASC detected at PID 7 when the pigs were initially inoculated at 3-5 or 25-27 days of age (Table  4 )) illustrating that humoral immune responses are induced in newborn pigs and supporting the concept that pigs are immunocompetent at birth (Porter, 1979) . However, we observed that in the older pigs inoculated with either SB 1 A or Gottfried rotavirus at 25-27 days of age, the specific IgA ASC responses in the MLN at PID 7 were higher than in the younger pigs (Table 4) , suggesting a possible delay in the maturation of the IgA antibody responses. Moreover, our data demonstrate that most piglets exposed to SB 1 A (G4P7 ) rotavirus are protected from diarrhea and virus shedding when challenged with heterotypic Gottfried (G4P6) rotavirus (Table 4 ), in agreement with earlier observations by Hoshino et al. ( 1988 ) . However, we observed that one of four SB 1 A-inoculated pigs developed transient (1 day) diarrhea and virus shedding after challenge with heterotypic Gottfried rotavirus (Table 2 ) , and that the numbers of virus specific IgM ASC in the spleen after the challenge of SBlA virus-inoculated pigs with heterotypic Gottfried rotavirus were higher than after challenge with homotypic SB 1 A rotavirus (Table 4 ). It is possible that limited viral replication in the gut of pigs challenged with the heterotypic rotavirus induced these specific IgM ASC.",

Equally important, the use of gnotobiotic pigs assures that exposure to extraneous rotaviruses or other enteric pathogens is eliminated as a confounding variable. Moreover, we have found that clinical signs in gnotobiotic pigs infected with various heterologous human rotavirus strains resemble those seen in pigs after infection with rotaviruses of host origin (Wyatt et al., 1980; Schaller et al., 1992; Saif and Chen, unpublished data, 1992) .
