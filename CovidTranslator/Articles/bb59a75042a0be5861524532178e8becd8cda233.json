Imaging revealed that bone marrow edema was significantly relieved, but the necrotic bone could not be reversed after ESWT. This technique could slow or even block the progression of ONFH and therefore reduce the demand for surgery. Collaboration with other conservative modalities would not improve the curative benefits of ESWT. Meanwhile, ONFH with various risk factors showed similar reaction to this noninvasive treatment method. However, these conclusions should be interpreted carefully for the low-quality of included publications and further studies are requisite to validate the effect of ESWT in ONFH.",

[1, 2] Approximately 20,000 patients were estimated to develop ONFH in America every year and another survey showed that the annul morbidity of ONFH in Japan was about 2.51/10,000. [3, 4] It is histologically characterized by insufficient supply of blood, death of osteocytes and bone marrow cells, and progressive structure damage of involved bones. Although osteonecrosis only affects the femoral head in most cases, osteonecrosis of other sites, for example, joints of knee, shoulder, wrist, elbow, and ankle also could be seen on clinic. The etiology of osteonecrosis is of various risk factors such as trauma, surgery of hip, corticosteroids, alcoholism, systemic lupus erythematosus, sickle-cell disease, and coagulopathy; [5] however, usually osteonecrotic lesions possess similar pathophysiological alteration.",

[6] [7] [8] [9] ESWT was introduced into the medical field after World War II, targeted at managing urinary calculus first and subsequently incidental phenomena that pelvic bone density increased during lithotripsy intrigued orthopedists to apply extracorporeal shockwave to treat musculoskeletal disorders. [10] A amount of studies investigated the effect of ESWT in the treatment of ONFH but high-quality evidence about its mechanism and effectiveness is still urgently needed.

Twelve [13, 14, [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [23] [24] [25] 27] studies were prospective ones and 5 [15, 22, 26, 28, 29] were retrospective ones. All patients were diagnosed with ONFH. Fourteen [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] articles provided the energy intensity of ESWT, all of which exceeded 0.18 mj/mm 2 and 9 were 0.62 mj/mm 2 . The patient population of these studies ranged from 1 to 335. Eleven [13, 15, 16, 20, [22] [23] [24] [26] [27] [28] [29] studies only investigated the effect of extracorporeal shockwave, 4 [14, 17, 19, 25] compared the performance of ESWT with operations (jointpreserving surgeries or endoprosthetic replacement of joint) and 2 [18, 21] compared the effect of ESWT with cocktail therapy (ESWT combined with other noninvasive modalities). Sixteen [13] [14] [15] [16] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] studies presented the visual analog scale (VAS) and/or Harris hip score before and after the treatment as evaluation indicators. Other outcome assessment indexes provided by these literatures included the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index (WOMAC), the 12item Short Form (SF-12) Survey, magnetic resonance imaging manifestation, the need for surgical intervention as well as numbers of patients with improved, stable and deteriorating conditions.",

            "text": "In 2001, Ludwig and his coauthors [13] first suggested that highenergy extracorporeal shockwave might provide a noninvasive alternative for treating ONFH. In this study, a total of 22 patients with ONFH of ARCO I-III stage received 1 (or 2 if necessary) session of ESWT and were followed up for 1 year. The results revealed obvious therapeutic success in 14 patients, in which group patients scored statistically differently at ARCO scale and showed slightly heterogeneous (though not statistically significant) age distribution compared with those resistant to ESWT. Meanwhile, 4 cases of complete healing were observed on MRI. Kong et al [22] supported this conclusion. In their study, 36 ONFH patients involving 42 hips were enrolled and at 1-year follow-up, they declared that cure was observed in 6 hips, marked effect in 13 hips, effectiveness in 16 hips, and ineffectiveness in 7 hips. It must be pointed out that in this study they did not undertake MRI examination and the definition of cure was disappearance of clinical symptoms. In 2012, Vulpiani et al [23] performed a further study by including 36 patients with unilateral ONFH and grouping them according to the ARCO scale. At the same time, [29] also divided patients on the basis of ARCO stage and obtained similar results. Kusz et al [24] demonstrated considerable enhancement of quality of life in ONFH patients after ESWT; however, they only followed up patients for 6 weeks. In the study reported by Gao et al, [26] they presented the largest patient population on this topic. A total of 335 patients involving 528 hips were divided into 2 groups according to whether the lateral pillar of femoral head was preserved and both groups showed amelioration of pain, increase of Harris hip scores and slowing of disease progression. They pointed out that the improvement of Harris hip scores was mainly due to the reduction of pains and the lesion decrease on MRI after ESWT was not statistically significant (at the same time, a significant reduction of bone marrow edema was indeed observed). Above-mentioned studies used focused shockwave while in 2016, Ma et al [28] described a case of advanced ONFH opt not to THA and treated with radial ESWT, in which a satisfactory result was obtained. Larger-scale clinical trials are needed to confirm this conclusion.",

Participants from 2 groups possessed homogeneous characteristics as well as VAS and Harris hip scores at baseline. At about 2-year follow-up, the ESWT group yielded better outcome in pain relief, Harris scores, hip function in activities of daily living and imaging manifestations. In 2012, Wang et al [25] published a further investigation comparing curative effect of ESWT with core decompression plus autogenous cancellous bone and allogenous fibular graft, and in this study they extended the follow-up to 8-or 9-year. At the last follow-up point, the ratios of good/poor response to treatment were 76/24 and 21/79 in ESWT group and CD group, respectively; meanwhile, THA was applied to 24% and 64% patients in ESWT group and CD group, respectively. Chen and his coworkers included 17 patients with bilateral ONFH, and then treated 17 hips with THA for late disease and other hips with ESWT for early disease. [19] According to the subjective evaluation after treatment, ESWT was valued more highly than THA in 13 patients and believed to be similar to THA in 4 cases. This result indicated that early detection of ONFH was crucial for its management.",

            "text": "The exact mechanism of ESWT in the treatment of ONFH is still controversial. High-energy extracorporeal shockwave travels through soft tissue and the change of impedance between soft tissue and bone interface results in energy deposition. This energy deposition of high acoustic waves may explain part of the therapeutic effect of extracorporeal shockwave. Meanwhile, extracorporeal shockwave has the ability to propagate through necrotic femoral hips and at the depth of 10 mm of bone, a pressure loss of 50% of shockwave was observed. [30] One hypothesis is that ESWT could induce microfracture to accelerate bone healing and increase pain threshold. [10] Higher expression level of bone morphogenic protein (BMP)-2, vessel endothelial growth factor (VEGF), alkaline phosphatase, Runt-related transcription factor 2 (RUNX2) and osteocalcin mRNA in marrow stromal cells as well as more mature mineralized nodules were demonstrated in ESWT group compared with control group, in which nitric oxide acted as the mediator. [31] One study showed increased osteogenesis and angiogenesis as well as bone remodeling of diseased hips after ESWT, indicating a regeneration effect. [17, 32, 33] In experiments with rabbit model, the expression of VEGF, BMP-2 and corresponding mRNA in subchondral bone of necrotic femoral heads was significantly up-regulated, which was consistent with the results in human samples. [34, 35] Durst et al reported that a woman with calcific tendinitis received high-energy extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy, and about 3 and a half years later she was diagnosed with osteonecrosis of humeral head. [36] Liu et al [37] presented another similar case report in which the onset of osteonecrosis of humeral head occurred only 3 months after ESWT. It is supposed that the high dose of extracorporeal shockwave and relatively small diameter of anterior humeral circumflex in 2 case reports might explain these complications. Though no evident complications of ESWT for treating ONFH was revealed, deterioration of lesions did be observed in some cases. Therefore, before starting ESWT, important arteries and nerves ought to be located with ultrasonography to avoid any possible damage. It is believed that radial ESWT has no need for location in advance but collection of high-quality data is necessary to testify this assumption.",

Only 4 studies were classified as Ib evidence according to Oxford Centre for EBM Levels of Evidence. Second, this is a systematic review and we could only discuss issues based on existing clinical evidences. Third, due to limited number of studies, quantitative analysis (meta-analysis) of extracted data is impossible. Finally, populations of most included studies were very small. This SR also reminds us of several research directions in the future. Persisting histopathological or even genetic experiments are indispensable to further clarify the mechanism of ESWT in the treatment of ONFH. Meanwhile, charging voltage, energy intensity, focus size, number of session and impulse of extracorporeal shockwave adopted by included studies were heterogeneous; therefore, a standardized therapeutic schedule of ESWT for ONFH needs to be determined. Last but not least, it is urgent for clinicians to discover other effective conservative modalities which could be applied to ONFH alone or enhance the benefits of ESWT.",

It possesses advantages such as non-invasiveness, safety, convenience to conduct and economy. Imaging revealed that bone marrow edema was significantly relieved but the necrotic bone or femoral head collapse could not be reversed after ESWT. This technique could slow or even block the progression of ONFH and therefore reduce the demand for surgery. ESWT brings more benefits than core decompression with/without bone grafting for early-stage ONFH and there is no evidence revealing that collaboration with other conservative methods could improve the curative effects of ESWT. Meanwhile, ONFH with various risk factors showed similar reaction to this noninvasive treatment method. Nevertheless, these results should be interpreted carefully due to the low quality of included publications and further studies are requisite to validate the effect of ESWT in ONFH.",
