            "text": "Ribosomal frameshifting signals are found in mobile genetic elements, viruses and cellular genes of prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Typically they comprise a slippery sequence, X XXY YYZ, where the frameshift occurs, and a stimulatory mRNA element. Here we studied the in\u00afuence of host translational environment and the identity of slippery sequence-decoding tRNAs on the frameshift mechanism. By expressing candidate signals in Escherichia coli, and in wheatgerm extracts depleted of endogenous tRNAs and supplemented with prokaryotic or eukaryotic tRNA populations, we show that when decoding AAG in the ribosomal A-site, E.coli tRNA Lys promotes a highly unusual single-tRNA slippage event in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic ribosomes. This event does not appear to require slippage of the adjacent P-site tRNA, although its identity is in\u00afuential. Conversely, asparaginyl-tRNA promoted a dual slippage event in either system. Thus, the tRNAs themselves are the main determinants in the selection of single-or dual-tRNA slippage mechanisms. We also show for the \u00aerst time that prokaryotic tRNA Asn is not inherentl\u1ef3 unslippery' and induces ef\u00aecient frameshifting when in the context of a eukaryotic translation system.",

            "text": "The elongation phase of protein synthesis is a precise process and mechanisms exist to promote translational \u00aedelity (reviewed in Czworkowski and Moore, 1996) . However, a growing number of examples have been described of highly ef\u00aecient`programmed' frameshift sites (see Farabaugh, 1996 Farabaugh, , 2000 . Such frameshifts, which can occur at frequencies approaching 100%, are not errors in the classical sense in that they generate authentic proteins and are stimulated speci\u00aecally by elements encoded in the mRNA. For this reason, they are considered more as extensions of the genetic code (recoding sites) (Gesteland and Atkins, 1996) rather tha\u01f9 natural' errors, although there may be mechanistic similarities between the two (Farabaugh and Bjork, 1999) . There is considerable interest in how programmed frameshifting occurs, as this may provide insights into normal frame maintenance, tRNA movement and the unwinding of mRNA secondary structures by ribosomes. Programmed \u00b11 ribosomal frameshift signals are found most commonly in eukaryotic RNA viruses and Escherichia coli insertional elements (IS), where they facilitate expression of replicases and transposases, respectively (see Chandler and Fayet, 1993; Brierley, 1995; Futterer and Hohn, 1996; Farabaugh, 2000 for reviews) . Examples have also been described in conventional cellular genes of E.coli (dnaX) (Blinkowa and Walker, 1990; Flower and McHenry, 1990; Tsuchihashi and Kornberg, 1990) , Bacillus subtilis (cdd) (Mejlhede et al., 1999) and mammalian cells (Edr) (Shigemoto et al., 2001) . The mRNA signals that cause frameshifting typically comprise two essential elements: a heptanucleotide`slippery' sequence, where the ribosome changes reading frame, and an adjacent stimulatory signal. This can be an RNA secondary structure (often an RNA pseudoknot) located a few nucleotides downstream (Jacks et al., 1988; Brierley et al., 1989; ten Dam et al., 1990) , a Shine\u00b1 Dalgarno-like (SD-like) sequence upstream (Mejlhede et al., 1999) or a combination of both (Larsen et al., 1994; Rettberg et al., 1999) . The slippery sequence consists of two homopolymeric triplets, conforming in the vast majority of cases to the motif X-XXY-YYZ. Frameshifting at this sequence is thought to occur by simultaneous (also referred to as`dual' or`tandem') slippage of the peptidyl and aminoacyl tRNAs, which are translocated from the zero (X-XXY-YYN) to the \u00b11 phase (XXX-YYY) (Jacks et al., 1988) . Following the slip, the tRNAs remain base-paired to the mRNA in at least two out of three anticodon positions. In prokaryotic systems, the generality of the simultaneous slippage model of frameshifting is not fully established. At most naturally occuring E.coli frameshift signals, including dnaX (slippery sequence A-AAA-AAG) (Tsuchihashi and Brown, 1992) , IS911 (A-AAA-AAG) (Chandler and Fayet, 1993) and the G-T ORF of bacteriophage l (G-GGA-AAG) (Levin et al., 1993) , a simultaneous slippage mechanism is employed. However, in IS1, frameshifting is thought to occur by \u00b11 slippage of a single lysyl-tRNA at the sequence A-AAA (from the underlined codon onto the overlapping AAA codon), despite the fact that the AAAA stretch is embedded within two potential and conventional slippery sequences (U-UUA-AAA-AAC) (Sekine and Ohtsubo, 1992) . There are other examples of frameshift signals where the occurrence of a dual slippage mechanism is questionable on the grounds that re-pairing of the frameshifted P-site tRNA with the mRNA does not allow the formation of stable base-pairs at the non-wobble positions. These include IS3 (C CAA AAG) (Sekine et al., 1994) , the bacteriophage T7 gene 10 signal (G-GUU-UUC) (Condron et al., 1991) and that of equine arteritis Prokaryotic-style frameshifting in a plant translation system: conservation of an unusual single-tRNA slippage event The EMBO Journal Vol. 22 No. 15 pp. 3941\u00b13950, 2003 \u00e3 European Molecular Biology Organization virus 1a/1b (G-UUA-AAC) (den Boon et al., 1991; Brierley et al., 1992) .",

            "text": "In mechanistic terms, the position of the tRNAs during the slippage event is a key issue. Evidence supports the view that in the vast majority of cases, the slippery sequence-decoding tRNAs are present in the P-and A-sites of the ribosome (see Atkins et al., 2001 for a review). However, there are a few exceptions. In an E.coli expression system, frameshifting at the human immuno-de\u00aeciency virus type 1 (HIV-1) gag/pro frameshift signal (U-UUU-UUA) is thought to occur when the tRNAs are in the ribosomal E-and P-sites (Hors\u00aeeld et al., 1995) . This hypothesis was proposed following the discovery that the presence of a termination codon immediately downstream of the U-UUU-UUA stretch reduced frameshifting some 5-to 10-fold. There are also two examples of \u00b11 frameshift signals where a single tRNA slippage event is proposed. At the CP/12K signal of potato virus M (A-AAA-UGA), a P-site slip is proposed, with lysyl-tRNA slipping back by 1 nucleotide (nt) from the underlined codon when the A-site is unoccupied (Gramstat et al., 1994) . The stimulation of such movements of peptidyl-tRNA by termination codons is not without precedent in other classes of frameshift signal (see Atkins et al., 2001) . However, a \u00b11 frameshift signal in the B.subtilis cytidine deaminase gene (cdd; CGA-AAG) (Mejlhede et al., 1999) is particularly unusual. Frameshifting at this site appears to occur without P-site slippage, with the A-site tRNA Lys repairing from AAG to AAA. How this can occur without simultaneous P-site tRNA slippage is not known, although displacement of the wobble pair (A:I) of the P-site tRNA by the \u00aerst base of the re-pairing A-site tRNA is a possibility (Mejlhede et al., 1999) . An event that bears similarity to the cdd frameshift event has been described for a viral frameshift system (Brierley et al., 1997) . An investigation into the functionality of the frameshift signal of the coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus (IBV; U-UUA-AAC) in E.coli revealed that a variant with slippery sequence U-CUA-AAG was highly active (40%) (Brierley et al., 1997) , despite possessing a slippery sequence which should allow only a single-tRNA slip in the A-site (from AAG back to AAA). This was unexpected, since viral frameshifting was generally believed to occur by simultaneous slippage and, as with cdd, no obvious mechanism exists to account for movement of just the A-site tRNA.",

There is a need to investigate more thoroughly the prevalence of such events and the features that can in\u00afuence the selection of single-or dual-tRNA slippage mechanisms of frameshifting. Here, we employed the IBV frameshift signal as a model system to investigate whether the mechanism employed is determined by the host translational environment (prokaryotic versus eukaryotic) and/or the nature of the tRNAs decoding the slippery sequence in the ribosomal A-and/or P-sites, focusing on tRNA Lys and tRNA Asn . To achieve this, we exploited a recently developed methodology for the preparation of tRNA-dependent in vitro translation systems (Jackson et al., 2001) . By expressing candidate frameshifting signals both in E.coli and in wheatgerm extracts (WG) depleted of endogenous tRNAs and supplemented with puri\u00aeed prokaryotic or eukaryotic tRNA populations, we show that, when present in the A-site, E.coli tRNA Lys can promote an unusual single-tRNA slippage event in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic ribosomes. We also demonstrate that prokaryotic tRNA Asn is not inherently`unslippery' and is perfectly capable of inducing ef\u00aecient frameshifting when placed in the environment of a eukaryotic translation system. However, with this tRNA, a dual slippage event is promoted. These \u00aendings provide strong evidence that it is the tRNAs themselves that are the main determinants in the selection of a single-or dual-tRNA slippage mechanism.

Although mammalian cells harbour a lysyl-tRNA closely related to the E.coli molecule [with anticodon 3 \u00a2UUU** 5 \u00a2, where U** is 5-methylcarbonylymethyl-2-thiouridine (mcm 5 s 2 U)], the U-UUA-AAG signal does not stimulate ef\u00aecient frameshifting in mammalian systems, probably because two additional tRNA Lys isoacceptors are present with anticodon 3 \u00a2UUC 5 \u00a2 which outcompete the mcm 5 s 2 U-containing isoacceptor (Tsuchihashi and Brown, 1992) . With slippery sequences of the order X XXA AAC, decoded by a single tRNA Asn isoacceptor with anticodon 3 \u00a2UUQ 5 \u00a2 (Q is queuosine), the situation is reversed in that in mammalian systems such signals are usually highly ef\u00aecient, but in E.coli promote only low levels of frameshifting.

It is also possible that the actual mechanism of frameshifting may change depending upon the identity of the tRNA. In a study of frameshifting at the IBV signal, we made the unexpected observation that a variant with slippery sequence U-CUA-AAG (wild type is U-UUA-AAC) showed highly ef\u00aecient frameshifting in E.coli (40%) but poor frameshifting (<1%) in the rabbit reticulocyte lysate in vitro translation system (RRL) (Brierley et al., 1997) . In E.coli, the P-site codon in the mutant, U-CUA-AAG, is probably decoded by a minor tRNA Leu isoacceptor with anticodon 3 \u00a2GAU 5 \u00a2 (Inokuchi and Yamao, 1995) and if it were to slip into the \u00b11 reading frame, in accordance with the simultaneous slippage model, it could form only a single G-U base-pair with the \u00b11 frame codon (see Table I ). This level of Fig. 1 . Plasmids used in this study. Frameshifting in E.coli BL21 cells was studied using the pMM series. Induction of T7 RNA polymerase with IPTG (see Materials and methods) leads to the expression of a 33 kDa non-frameshifted product, corresponding to ribosomes that terminate at the IBV 1a stop codon and a 50 kDa frameshift product from ribosomes that frameshift prior to encountering the stop codon and continue to translate the 1b ORF in the \u00b11 frame. Frameshifting in tRNA-depleted WG extracts employed synthetic mRNAs transcribed from the pFScass plasmid series. Here, the non-frameshifted and frameshifted species are 19 and 22 kDa, respectively. The frameshift signal present in each plasmid contained either a pseudoknot (PK) or a related stem\u00b1loop structure (SL). In the pMM series, these were the wild-type IBV PK and a related SL (Brierley et al., 1991) . In the pFScass series, the minimal IBV PK was employed (Brierley et al., 1992) along with a related SL (this study).",

For this reason, we examined here a broader range of IBV slippery sequence mutants, decoded by a variety of tRNAs, and measured frameshifting in E.coli BL21 cells (see Materials and methods).

As can be seen in Figure 2 , variants of U-UUA-AAG with individual point mutations that were predicted to disrupt slippage of the P-site tRNA retained high levels of frameshifting ( Figure 2 ). This was the case even when the expected number of P-site post-slippage tRNA anticodon:mRNA codon contacts formed was only one or less (taking into account pairing speci\u00aecities of tRNAs, including anticodon modi\u00aecations; see Table I ). Thus, in all cases, substantial frameshifting was promoted under conditions where only the A-site tRNA Lys could repair in the \u00b11 frame.

First, point mutations that changed the slippery sequence so as to reduce the predicted stability of the post-slippage A-site mRNA codon\u00b1anticodon complexes either greatly reduced (pMM41, slippery sequence U-UUG-AAG; 2%) or abolished frameshifting (pMM30, pMM40; slippery sequence U-UUA-CAG).

(1989) assessed the primary sequence requirements for frameshifting in E.coli of a variant of the mouse mammary tumour virus (MMTV) gag/pro frameshift signal with slippery sequence A-AAA-AAG. In contrast to what is observed with the IBV system, even a modest reduction in the potential for post-slippage P-site mRNA\u00b1tRNA pairing (e.g. a change from A-AAA-AAG to G-AAA-AAG) reduced frameshift ef\u00aeciency markedly with the MMTV signal, indicating that a dual slippage event was occurring. The most obvious explanation for the discrepancy between the two studies is that the identity of the P-site tRNA is in\u00afuencing the slippage process. To test this, we compared variant IBV signals with slippery sequences A-AAA-AAG and G-AAA-AAG together with either pseudoknot or hairpin stimulator. As shown in Figure 2 , the frameshift ef\u00aeciencies seen were consistent with the study of Weiss et al. (1989) . The A-AAA-AAG signal promoted ef\u00aecient frameshifting with a pseudoknot (pMM44, 43%) or a stem\u00b1loop stimulator (pMM45, 37%), but a change to G-AAA-AAG reduced frameshifting markedly (pMM46, 18%; pMM47, 7%). Thus, the ability of tRNA Lys to induce a single tRNA slip can be in\u00afuenced by the adjacent P-site tRNA. Certainly, when this tRNA is also tRNA Lys , a dual slippage event appears to be the most likely outcome.",

The tRNA content and tRNA dependence of the depleted WG used in this experiment are shown in Figure 3 . Translational activity was entirely dependent upon the addition of exogenous tRNA.

With calf-liver tRNAs, the pattern of frameshifting seen was consistent with previous studies, although the ef\u00aeciencies were uniformly slightly higher, indicating that the depleted WG is somewhat more promiscuous. In combination with the pseudoknot (Figure 4A ), the wild-type slippery sequence (U-UUA-AAC, pFScass 5) stimulated ef\u00aecient frameshifting (51%), a variant with slippery sequence U-UUA-AAG (pFScass 5.18) had greatly reduced frameshifting (7%), and variants with point mutations in the \u00aerst part of the slippery sequence (U-UUA-AAC) showed reduced frameshifting, consistent with the dual-tRNA slippage model of frameshifting. P-site variants of the slippery sequence U-UUA-AAG also showed reduced levels of frameshifting (<2%), and we attribute this to an inability of the calf-liver tRNA Lys species decoding the A-site codon (presumably an isoacceptor with anticodon 3 \u00a2UUC 5 \u00a2) to slip. The situation was different in translations programmed with E.coli tRNAs. Under these conditions, frameshift signals with a slippery sequence ending with AAG (pFScass 5.18, 5.90, 5.91, 5.92), decoded by prokaryotic tRNA Lys , showed much greater activity (47, 35, 48 and 50%, respectively), strongly supporting the view that an A-site single tRNA Lys slippage event also occurs in the plant system. In contrast, the frameshift ef\u00aeciency of slippery sequences ending in AAC (i.e. A-site decoded by prokaryotic tRNA Asn ) was highly dependent on the P-site tRNA and its ability to re-pair in the \u00b11 phase. In constructs in which P-site re-pairing was predicted to be impaired (cass 5.87, C-UUA-AAC; 5.101, U-AUA-AAC; 5.102, U-GUA-AAC), the frameshift ef\u00aeciencies were considerably lower (6, 13 and 7%, respectively) than those in which such re-pairing was likely (cass 5, U-UUA-AAC; 5.97, U-UCA-AAC), where frameshifting occurred ef\u00aeciently (50 and 38%, respectively). This pattern closely resembled that seen with calf-liver tRNAs and supports the view that prokaryotic tRNA Asn is not`inherently unslippery' and is capable of promoting ef\u00aecient dual-tRNA frameshifting within the context of a eukaryotic ribosome. Figure 4B shows the translation products synthesized from a set of frameshift reporter mRNAs in which the stimulatory structure was a hairpin\u00b1loop. The pattern of frameshifting observed was qualitatively similar to that seen with the pseudoknot in that the lysyl-and asparaginyl-tRNAs decoding the slippery sequences are associated with single-and dual-tRNA slippage events, respectively. Thus, the nature of the stimulatory RNA does not appear to in\u00afuence the mechanism of frameshifting. In quantitative terms, frameshifting occurred uniformly less ef\u00aeciently with the hairpin stimulator, consistent with previous studies (Brierley et al., 1991 (Brierley et al., , 1997 . However, the presence of the hairpin or pseudoknot was required for frameshifting; the introduction of a destabilizing mutation into the stem of the hairpin or stem 1 of the pseudoknot (in constructs with slippery sequence U-GUA-AAG) greatly reduced frameshifting in translations supplemented with E.coli tRNAs (to 2%, data not shown).",

By expressing candidate frameshifting signals in E.coli and in WG extracts depleted of endogenous tRNAs and supplemented with prokaryotic or eukaryotic tRNA populations, we found that when present in the ribosomal A-site, E.coli tRNA Lys promotes a highly unusual single-tRNA slippage event in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic ribosomes. The ef\u00aeciency of the process is in\u00afuenced both by the A-site codon (AAG or AAA) and the identity of the P-site tRNA. Asparaginyl-tRNA, on the other hand, promoted a dual slippage event in either system. The type of stimulatory RNA, stem\u00b1loop or pseudoknot, did not appear to in\u00afuence the choice of frameshift mechanism, although it did modulate the ef\u00aeciency of the process. Thus, the tRNAs themselves are the main determinants in the selection of single-or dual-tRNA slippage mechanisms. The tRNA-dependent translation system enabled us to con\u00aerm, for the \u00aerst time, that prokaryotic asparaginyl tRNA is not inherentl\u1ef3 unslippery' and is capable of inducing highly ef\u00aecient frameshifting in the context of a eukaryotic translation system.",

Heelprint analysis of RRL ribosomes paused at the IBV pseudoknot indicate that the ribosomal P-and A-sites are positioned over the slippery sequence during the pause (Kontos et al., 2001) and the same is true for WG ribosomes (Kontos, 1997) . Furthermore, the response of both prokaryotic (Brierley et al., 1997) and eukaryotic (Brierley et al., 1989) ribosomes to changes in the length of the spacer region between slippery sequence and stimulatory RNA is the same, i.e. reduction to 3 (nt) or expansion to 9 nt (from the normal 6 nt) abolishes frameshifting in either system. The decoding sites of the prokaryotic and eukaryotic ribosomes employed here are, therefore, highly likely to interact with the pseudoknot or stem\u00b1loop at the same relative position on the mRNA. The differential responses to pseudoknot-or stem\u00b1loop-stimulated frameshifting observed in the present study are consistent with this belief. It seems highly unlikely, therefore, that the single-tRNA slippage event occurs in the P-site, since this would require movement of the ribosome (hence unwinding of the pseudoknot) by an additional codon. Furthermore, the differential responses in frameshifting seen when the`A-site' of the slippery sequence is decoded by tRNA Lys or tRNA Asn are An unusual single-tRNA frameshift event unaffected by the presence of a stop codon immediately downstream of the slippery sequence, arguing against a slippage mechanism involving the P-or P/E-sites.",

            "text": "Our experimental data are strongly supportive of an A-site single tRNA Lys slippage event. However, the nature of the P-site tRNA can also in\u00afuence the process. Although most of the P-site tRNAs tested (tRNA Leu , tRNA Ile , tRNA Val , tRNA Ser ) allowed ef\u00aecient single-tRNA frameshifting, the presence of tRNA Lys in the P-site (when decoding G-AAA-AAG) was quite inhibitory. Another important factor is the nature of the wobble pair formed between the A-site tRNA Lys and the mRNA. It is generally accepted that the strength of the interaction between the codon and anticodon can in\u00afuence frameshifting ef\u00aeciency and, in this light, the role of the mnm 5 s 2 modi\u00aecations of tRNA Lys U34 is signi\u00aecant. In normal translation, these modi\u00aecations are thought to restrict wobble, preventing misreading of near-cognate codons ending in U, but at the cost of greatly reduced recognition of G (Yokoyama et al., 1985) . The high frameshift ef\u00aeciency elicited by E.coli tRNA Lys at the AAG codon is consistent with a weak wobble pair, and it was perhaps surprising to \u00aend that in mnmA and mnmE strains, the absence of mnm 5 or s 2 did not lead to a notable reduction in frameshifting (there was a very small reduction in the case of mnmA; Figure 2 ). However, these data are consistent with more recent studies on these modi\u00aecations (Brierley et al., 1997; Hagervall et al., 1998; Kru \u00c8ger et al., 1998) and support the idea that the 5-methylaminomethyl group facilitates base-pairing with G and in its absence (in the mnmE strain) the interaction is weaker, leading to increased frameshifting. In contrast, the absence of the 2thio group (mnmA) does not appear to affect recognition of G. It would be interesting to test frameshifting in a strain defective in the synthesis of both modi\u00aecations, should such a strain be viable. Recognition of the AAG codon by wild-type tRNA Lys , however, is still suf\u00aeciently poor to allow ef\u00aecient frameshifting. A change of this codon to AAA, which is bound more tightly to the anticodon (at least in vitro) (Lustig et al., 1981; Yokoyama et al., 1985) , gave the expected reduction in frameshift ef\u00aeciency at U-UUA-AAA (pMM9), but alteration to U-CUA-AAA (pMM42; Figure 2 ) depressed the ef\u00aeciency further, indicating that a single tRNA slip was less favoured under these circumstances. However, it will be necessary to test additional P-site tRNAs in the context of an A-site AAA codon before the signi\u00aecance of this observation can be fully assessed.",

Escherichia coli tRNA Asn , on the other hand, promoted a simultaneous slippage event in either system, consistent with previous studies of the closely related MMTV frameshift signal (Weiss et al., 1989; Chamorro et al., 1992) . This suggests that it is the tRNA rather than the host translational environment that is the main determinant in the selection of single-or dual-tRNA slippage mechanisms. The extent of the frameshift however was variable between host systems. Although the prokaryotic asparaginyl-and lysyl-tRNAs promoted similar levels of frameshifting in the WG system, this was not the case in E.coli. It has been known for some time that in prokaryotes, frameshifting at slippery sequences that end in AAAC is generally very inef\u00aecient in comparison to eukaryotic systems (Weiss et al., 1989) . The prokaryotic and eukaryotic asparaginyl-tRNAs employed in this study have identical anticodon loops and it is known that the presence or absence of the queuosine modi\u00aecation of the wobble base does not in\u00afuence frameshifting (Brierley et al., 1997; Marczinke et al., 2000) except for yeast tRNA Asn (Carlson et al., 2000) . It has thus been speculated that differences in frameshifting ef\u00aeciencies seen between the two systems are a consequence of either sequence variation elsewhere in the tRNAs or the differing translational environments (Marczinke et al., 2000) . Here we show for the \u00aerst time that prokaryotic tRNA Asn is not inherently`unslippery' and is able to promote ef\u00aecient frameshifting in the WG system to a level similar to that stimulated by WG tRNA Asn . Thus, prokaryotic ribosomes somehow restrict frameshifting by this tRNA. It is clear, therefore, that the two translation systems are not identical from a frameshifting perspective, a point that must be borne in mind when attempting mechanistic comparisons.",

            "text": "Current models of ribosomal frameshifting seem inadequate to explain a single-tRNA slippage event of the kind described here. One can speculate that the A-site tRNA Lys slips during translocation at a time in the cycle when the P-site tRNA detaches from the mRNA as it moves fully into the E-site (Weiss et al., 1989) . Under these circumstances, there would be no requirement for P-site tRNA repairing (Brierley et al., 1997) . This is consistent with an earlier suggestion that pseudoknot-induced ribosomal pausing may occur during translocation (Kontos et al., 2001) , but not with studies of antibiotics that in\u00afuence frameshifting, which indicate that the event takes place prior to translocation (see Plant et al., 2003) . A perhaps more compelling model can be devised based on the \u00b11 frameshifting signal of the B.subtilis cytidine deaminase gene (cdd; CGA-AAG) (Mejlhede et al., 1999) . Frameshifting at this site has been suggested to occur without P-site slippage, with the A-site tRNA Lys repairing from AAG to AAA, and the \u00aerst base of the re-pairing A-site tRNA displacing the weak wobble pair (A:I) of the P-site tRNA Arg (anticodon 3 \u00a2GCI 5 \u00a2). The CGA codon is rare, yet replacing it with another rare arginine codon (AGA) leads to a great reduction in frameshifting, suggesting that the important aspect of the CGA codon is the weak pair it forms with the decoding tRNA Arg rather than tRNA abundance (Mejlhede et al., 1999) . The single tRNA slippage event detailed in the present study has similarities to the cdd signal and could conceivably occur in the same manner with the \u00aerst base of the repairing tRNA Lys displacing the wobble base of the adjacent P-site tRNA. In almost all of the examples tested, the wobble base that would be displaced comprises an A in the mRNA and a modi\u00aeed U of some form in the anticodon. If the modi\u00aecation were to weaken the base-pair in a manner akin to the aforementioned A:I pair, this may promote displacement and the stimulation of a \u00b11 single-tRNA slip. Indeed, in the one case tested where the mRNA base was G (in pMM41, U-UUG-AAG), frameshifting was greatly reduced (<2%). In the case of this site, the decoding tRNA in the P-site, tRNA Leu , possesses an unmodi\u00aeed anticodon ( 3 \u00a2AAC 5 \u00a2) that would presumably have a stable wobble pair (G:C). However, a more systematic analysis is required before this hypothesis can be generally accepted. Another issue that requires resolution is the role of the stimulatory RNAs in frameshifting. The single-tRNA slippage event described in the present study requires the participation of a downstream stimulatory element (pseudoknot or stem\u00b1loop), whereas frameshifting at the cdd site is promoted by an interaction between the anti-Shine\u00b1 Dalgarno (anti-SD) sequence close to the 3\u00a2-end of 16S rRNA and an SD-like sequence 14 nt upstream of the recoding site (Mejlhede et al., 1999) . An additional question is how such movement could be accommodated by the ribosome. Recent crystallographic studies indicate that there is a considerable gap (10 A \u00ca ) between the anticodon loops of the P-and A-site tRNAs that could potentially allow some reorganization of the A-site tRNA without P-site tRNA slippage (Yusupov et al., 2001) . However, whether there is suf\u00aecient freedom of movement to allow the formation of a post-slippage pair across the mRNA kink present between the P-and A-site codons is unknown.",

One millilitre columns were loaded with 1\u00b12 ml lysate and eluate fractions tested for their ability to translate a reporter mRNA in the presence or absence of added tRNAs (at 50 mg/ml \u00aenal concentration). Active fractions with good tRNA dependence (<5% residual activity in the absence of added tRNA) were retained and stored under liquid nitrogen prior to use.",

These plasmids contain the IBV ORF 1a/1b frameshift signal\u00afanked by portions of the in\u00afuenza virus A/PR8/34 PB1 gene (Young et al., 1983) . Following site-directed mutagenesis to introduce changes in the IBV slippery sequence or spacer region, 585bp NheI\u00b1EcoRI fragments encompassing the frameshift region were subcloned from the mutated plasmids into BamHI-cleaved pET3xc, an E.coli expression vector (Studier et al., 1990) . Both fragments and vector were end-\u00aelled using the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I prior to ligation with T4 DNA ligase. The resulting plasmids, part of the pMM series (Brierley et al., 1997) , are shown in Figure 1 . The PB1:1a/ 1b:PB1 fragment is located downstream of, and in-frame with, the \u00aerst 783 bp of coding sequence of the bacteriophage T7 gene 10 and the ensemble is under the control of the bacteriophage T7 promoter. In BL21 cells (see below), the constructs express a 33 kDa non-frameshifted and a 50 kDa \u00b11 frameshift product. Frameshifting assays in WG employed plasmid pFScass 5 and mutant derivatives (Brierley et al., 1992) . This plasmid contains the minimal IBV frameshifting signal\u00afanked by portions of the in\u00afuenza virus A/PR8/34 PB2 gene (Young et al., 1983) . Messenger RNAs derived from BamHI-cleaved pFScass 5 direct the synthesis of a 19 kDa non-frameshifted and a 22 kDa \u00b11 frameshift product. Some of the variants of pFScass 5 employed in this study were described earlier (Brierley et al., 1992) .",

The puri\u00aeed expression products of the pMM plasmids were dissolved in Laemmli's sample buffer and aliquots analysed on SDS\u00b115% (w/v) polyacrylamide gels. Proteins were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R (0.1% w/v) in 10% (v/v) acetic acid, 50% (v/v) methanol and destained in 10% (v/v) acetic acid, 30% methanol. The relative abundance of non-frameshifted or frameshifted products was estimated (Adobe Photoshop and NIH Image software) by scanning densitometry and adjusted to take into account the differential size of the products. Scans were performed on gels whose proteins were stained to an intensity at the centre of the dynamic range of the scanner (Epson Expression 1600 Pro).
