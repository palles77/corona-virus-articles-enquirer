            "text": "The human coronavirus NL63 is generally classified as a common cold pathogen, though the infection may also result in severe lower respiratory tract diseases, especially in children, patients with underlying disease, and elderly. It has been previously shown that HCoV-NL63 is also one of the most important causes of croup in children. In the current manuscript we developed a set of polymer-based compounds showing prominent anticoronaviral activity. Polymers have been recently considered as promising alternatives to small molecule inhibitors, due to their intrinsic antimicrobial properties and ability to serve as matrices for antimicrobial compounds. Most of the antimicrobial polymers show antibacterial properties, while those with antiviral activity are much less frequent. A cationically modified chitosan derivative, N-(2-hydroxypropyl)-3-trimethylammonium chitosan chloride (HTCC), and hydrophobically-modified HTCC were shown to be potent inhibitors of HCoV-NL63 replication. Furthermore, both compounds showed prominent activity against murine hepatitis virus, suggesting broader anticoronaviral activity.",

While 5 0 two-thirds of the genome encodes a large polyprotein that contains all proteins necessary for RNA replication, the 3 0 one-third encodes several structural proteins, including spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N), which are incorporated into the virion and participate in numerous processes (e.g., virus budding). Nonstructural accessory protein genes are species-specific and are interspaced between the structural genes. The virus particle itself is enveloped and carries extruding S proteins on the membrane surface, providing the virion with the typical crown-like structure (Fields et al., 2007) .",

The change took place in 2003, when the SARS-CoV emerged in the Guandong province in China (Drosten et al., 2003; Ksiazek et al., 2003; Peiris et al., 2003) . The epidemic spread was contained in early July of 2003, mostly by quarantine measures; however, there were also some sporadic cases in 2003-2004 season (Peiris et al., 2004) . This sudden outbreak of a previously undescribed coronavirus brought the whole family of viruses back to the limelight, so in the consecutive two years two new human coronaviruses -HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 -were identified. Both viruses have spread worldwide and are linked with the respiratory tract disease (van der Hoek et al., 2004; Woo et al., 2005) .",

            "text": "Considering the prevalence of the HCoV-NL63 and its indubitable association with diseases, an effective antiviral treatment is required for patients suffering from severe respiratory tract illness. The studies described in this paper indicate that such a treatment may be provided by polymeric substances. Polymers are intensively studied as potent antimicrobial systems both due to their intrinsic antimicrobial properties and as matrices for antimicrobial compounds (both organic and inorganic). The latter systems, however, require the diffusion of low-molecular-weight antimicrobials through a polymeric matrix, which may be toxic to the human body (Munoz-Bonilla and Fernandez-Garcia, 2012) . Therefore, polymers which possess antimicrobial activity are the preferred solution. Moreover, polymers usually show a long-term activity. Of particular interest among antimicrobial polymers are polycations containing phosphonium groups (Kenawy and Mahmoud, 2003) or those with quaternary nitrogen atoms such as pyridinium (Tiller et al., 2002) , imidazolium (Anderson and Long, 2010) , or ammonium groups Timofeeva et al., 2009) . Other antimicrobial polymers are those containing halogens, both fluorine (Caillier et al., 2009 ) and chlorine (Patel et al., 2004) , polymers containing sulfo groups (Zaneveld et al., 2002) , or those substituted with low-molecular-weight compounds such as antibiotics ciprofloxacin (Woo et al., 2000) or norfloxacin (Yang and Santerre, 2001) . Most of the antimicrobial polymers show antibacterial properties, while those with antiviral activity are much less frequent. It is still difficult to predict if a polymer shows antimicrobial properties just based on its structure, therefore its potential antimicrobial activity has to be verified experimentally.",

Briefly, LLC-MK2 cells were seeded on a 96-well plate in media containing increasing concentrations of inhibitory polymers.

To test whether the observed effect is not cell-specific, the inhibitory activity of the polymers in a more natural environment was also assessed; HAE cultures, mimicking natural conductive airway epithelium, were used for this purpose. HAE cultures are formed by the multi-layered, fully differentiated primary human airway epithelial cells growing on collagen-coated plastic supports on air/li-quid interphase (Banach et al., 2009; Pyrc et al., 2010) . Due to technical restrictions, it was not possible to use a standard assay with inhibitors present in the apical medium. HAE cultures were infected in the presence of tested inhibitors during 2 h incubation and subsequently the apical medium was removed. Further, the apical surfaces of HCoV-NL63-infected and mock-infected HAE cultures were rinsed every 24 h with 100 ll of the medium containing a given inhibitor. Samples of the apical fluid were concurrently collected. Real-time RT-PCR analysis shows the drastic decrease in the number of viral copies in the presence of the tested polymers, proving their effectiveness also in this semi-natural setting (Fig. 4A) .

In native chitosan the amino groups are partially deacetylated which means that the glucose groups may be substituted with both -NH 2 and CH 3 CONH-groups in the same macromolecule. Since the distribution of acetylated and deacetylated NH 2 -groups along the chitosan chain is random, this is often reflected by showing that R may be either H or -COCH 3 group. Consequently, since in HM-HTCC polymer some of the NH 2 -groups are substituted with -C 12 H 25 groups, some of R groups may be H, some -COCH 3 groups, and some -C 12 H 25 groups in the same chitosan chain. Therefore, in HM-HTCC R may be H or COCH 3 or C 12 H 25 . tures with respective polymers did not result in a marked decrease in cell viability (Fig. 4B) , which suggests these polymers may be potentially used in the treatment of coronaviral illnesses.",

Briefly, as MHV infection results in a massive cell death within 24-48 h post infection, the CPE occurrence 48 h post-infection was scored on a 96-well plate in media containing inhibitory polymers. Cells were infected with MHV at 50% tissue culture infectious dose (TCID 50 ) of 400 and the reduction of CPE in susceptible cells in-fected with MHV was investigated. Analysis revealed that HTCC and HM-HTCC hamper the appearance of morphological changes and cell death following the infection, as presented in Fig. 2 . Further, a quantitative RT-PCR -based assay was employed to assess the MHV yield in the cell culture supernatant. The assay was performed as described in Section 2 and the number of RNA copies per milliliter of cell culture supernatant was assessed. Obtained results confirm observations shown in Fig. 2 and prove that in the presence of HTCC or HM-HTCC MHV replication is limited by 3-4 logs, compared to the control sample ( Fig. 5A and B) . While for HM-HTCC some cytotoxicity may be observed at the highest concentration tested (200 lg/ml; $20% toxicity), no marked toxicity was observed for the HTCC compound. The lower toxicity, compared to LLC-MK2 cells, most likely resulted from shorter incubation time for MHV (48 h instead of 144 h). Subsequently, an effort was made to determine whether tested compounds are able to inhibit replication of other human viruses. To appropriately study the subject, a variety of viral species were tested, including human metapneumovirus, human adenovirus, human echovirus, influenza A virus, and human herpesvirus type 1. The analysis was conducted by CPE assessment and no inhibition of virus-mediated effect was observed (data not shown).",

All the experiments aimed to determine the cytotoxicity of the tested compounds were conducted in identical conditions as those used for the assessment of the antiviral potential of the polymers (i.e., LLC-MK2 and A549 cells were incubated for 6 days, and LR7 cells were incubated for 48 h in the presence of the inhibitory compounds). Two different assays were used to appropriately evaluate the cytotoxic potential of the tested polymers. First, an XTT test was performed, based on the ability of eukaryotic mitochondrial enzymes to transform the substrate (2,3-bis-(2-methoxy-4-nitro-5-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium-5-carboxanilide) to colored formazan salts. As there is a direct relationship between cell viability and the amount of the dye produced, it was possible to determine the relative viability of cells. The neutral red (NR) assay was used as the second method. The neutral red dye is able to penetrate living cells and it accumulates in endosomes, therefore it was possible to analyze and quantify the rate of this process, as described in Section 2. Following the 6-day incubation of LLC-MK2 or A549 cells in the presence of the tested polymers, the media were removed and the cell viability was evaluated. Both methods produced consistent estimation of the polymer toxicity and the results are presented in Table 3 and Fig. 3 . The HTCC polymer is not toxic at effective concentrations (up to 100 lg/ml), showing highly specific inhibition of viral infection. At higher concentrations the cytotoxic effect becomes visible (IC 50 > 150 lg/ml), but one should remember that LLC-MK2 cells are incubated with polymer for six consecutive days due to low replication rate of the HCoV-NL63 in this model system. The second tested polymer -HM-HTCC -shows similar toxicity, though its inhibitory properties are inferior compared to HTCC. For LR7 cells, following the 2-day incubation in the presence of the tested polymers, the media were removed and the cell viability was evaluated with the XTT assay (Fig. 5B) . Obtained results were consistent with those presented in Fig. 2 . Also in this case no cytotoxicity was observed in an effective range for HTCC and only minor toxicity for HM-HTCC.",

For this purpose HTCC was substituted with FITC and fluorescence emission intensity in the presence of increasing concentrations of Se-NL63 was measured. As presented in Fig. 6 , the fluorescence intensity diminished in the presence of Se-NL63 in a concentration-dependent manner. Such an observation indicates a strong interaction between the tested biopolymers, as it results from the signal quenching during complex formation. No decrease in fluorescence intensity of FITC-HTCC was observed in the presence of bovine serum albumin (BSA) indicating that BSA does not interact with FITC-HTCC and, consequently, that there is some specificity in the interaction between Se-NL63 and HTCC.",

This is particularly important considering recent identification of new coronavirus infecting humans (Wise, 2012) . As mentioned above, a clear link between HCoV-NL63 and the respiratory diseases was established in a prospective population-based study (PRI.DE) on lower respiratory tract infections in children less than three years of age in Germany. Of the children with HCoV-NL63 infection, 45% had laryngotracheitis (croup) compared to only 6% in the control group. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that the chance of croup is 6.6 times higher in HCoV-NL63-positive children than in HCoV-NL63-negative children (van der Hoek et al., 2005). Considering the observed pathogenicity and worldwide distribution of the virus, in severe cases (e.g., in children, immunocompromised and elder patients) the application of a therapeutic drug may be required to hamper the disease progression. Until present, some inhibitors have been described for HCoV-NL63, interfering with different stages of HCoV-NL63 replication.",

Another interesting approach was proposed by Pyrc et al., who used synthetic peptides interfering with S protein fusogenic activity by interacting with heptad repeat regions in the S2 domain. The same group of authors suggested employment of RNAi technology and small molecule inhibitors previously shown to inhibit other viruses . An interesting and novel approach for inhibition of coronaviral infection was proposed initially by Pfefferle et al., who identified interaction between cyclophilins/immunophilins and the coronaviral non-structural protein 1. Such an interaction is maintained in all coronaviral species, though what is even more important, commercially available peptide inhibitors of cyclophilins/immunophilins are able to hamper coronaviral infection (Carbajo-Lozoya et al., 2012; de Wilde et al., 2011; Pfefferle et al., 2011; Tanaka et al., 2012) .",

Therefore, one may assume that the observed activity relies on the direct interaction of the polymer with the virus (e.g., with the S protein, essential for virus entry). Indeed, the analysis of the interaction between HTCC polymer and the recombinant ectodomain of the S protein showed binding, resulting in the formation of protein-polymer complexes. One may assume that such binding will result in the efficient inactivation of the virus. Unfortunately, it was not possible to determine whether HTCC polymer hampers NL63-S/ACE2 interaction, as the affinity of NL63-S to ACE2 is very low (Lin et al., 2008; Mathewson et al., 2008) and it was not possible to visualize this process with accessible methods. Careful analysis of polymers suggests that the combination of particular polymeric chain and its proper substituent is indispensable for its activity. For example, the non-modified oligochitosan did not present any antiviral properties; furthermore, no inhibitory effect was seen for other polymeric chains substituted in a similar fashion (data not shown).

Analogical measurements of FITC-HTCC spectra in the presence of bovine serum albumin (BSA) were performed as a control (d).

The obtained results were further normalized to the control sample, where cell viability was set to 100%. For the assessment of the cell viability for HAE cultures, the apical surface was washed with 100 ll of 1\u00c2 PBS and 100 ll of 1\u00c2 PBS with 50 ll of the activated XTT solution was overlaid on the apical surface. Following the 2 h incubation, the apical solution was collected and transferred onto a new 96-well plate. The signal was evaluated as described above.",
