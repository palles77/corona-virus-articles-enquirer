Current evidence suggests these populations include older adults, those with serious chronic medical conditions, and immunosuppressed patients with prior or active cancer. 1,2 Whether this latter group includes patients on biological and small molecule therapies remains to be seen. Nevertheless, the therapeutic efficacy of immunosuppressive and immunomodulatory medications is critical to the management of inflammatory and autoimmune conditions in dermatology.",

Antiviral T-cell responses are initiated with the uptake of viral antigen in infected tissue, activation of T-cells by viral recognition and pathogen signaling, and cytokine polarization toward a Th1 profile via IL-12 and type 1 IFN. 3 Importantly, Th17, Th2, and Treg cell populations may also be generated to some degree to combat infection against certain viral pathogens. It stands to reason that the use of biologic therapies known to modulate and blunt Th1 responses, including TNF-alpha inhibitors, abatacept (CTLA-4 inhibitor), and ustekinumab (IL-12/23 inhibitor) may specifically require more stringent precautions to diminish risk of infection and prioritization of alternative therapeutic agents when possible. 4 The effect of IL-17 inhibitors and dupilumab (IL-4 blockade), which predominately impair Th17 pathways and Th2 pathways respectively, on SARS-CoV-2 remains unknown and for now, also warrants caution. Additionally, use of non-biologic systemic therapies, such as cyclosporin, azathioprine, and methotrexate, warrant similar precautions as their therapeutic mechanisms create a state of generalized immunosuppression in the host.",

Specifically, higher concentrations of GCSF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF\u03b1 were found in patients requiring intensive care unit (ICU) admission compared to those with infection that did not require ICU admission, suggesting a possible association between cytokine storm and disease severity. 1 The cytokine storm immunopathology of SARS-CoV-2 suggests that a subset of immunosuppressive therapies may begin to play a protective role in infected patients. By inhibiting the intensity of the cytokine storm, immunosuppressants may prevent lung tissue damage and further clinical deterioration. Directly counteracting the cytokine storm with glucocorticoids and anti-IL-6 treatment is under active investigation in China. 1 Anti-IL-17 therapy was similarly investigated to combat morbidity of the influenza A (H1N1) virus pandemic in 2009 and a similar mechanism may become important in SARS-CoV-2. 5 As clinical evidence is collected to inform evidenced-based guidelines for management of COVID-19, dermatologists should use their clinical judgement, the existing AAD guidelines, and an understanding of pathophysiology to determine the appropriate risk-benefit of using systemic immunomodulating therapies.",
