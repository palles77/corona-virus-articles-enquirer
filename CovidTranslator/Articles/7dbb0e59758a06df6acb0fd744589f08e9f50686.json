            "text": "Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is a novel virus that emerged in 2012, causing acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), severe pneumonia-like symptoms and multi-organ failure, with a case fatality rate of \u223c36%. Limited clinical studies indicate that humans infected with MERS-CoV exhibit pathology consistent with the late stages of ARDS, which is reminiscent of the disease observed in patients infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus. Models of MERS-CoV-induced severe respiratory disease have been difficult to achieve, and small-animal models traditionally used to investigate viral pathogenesis (mouse, hamster, guinea-pig and ferret) are naturally resistant to MERS-CoV. Therefore, we used CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing to modify the mouse genome to encode two amino acids (positions 288 and 330) that match the human sequence in the dipeptidyl peptidase 4 receptor, making mice susceptible to MERS-CoV infection and replication. Serial MERS-CoV passage in these engineered mice was then used to generate a mouse-adapted virus that replicated efficiently within the lungs and evoked symptoms indicative of severe ARDS, including decreased survival, extreme weight loss, decreased pulmonary function, pulmonary haemorrhage and pathological signs indicative of end-stage lung disease. Importantly, therapeutic countermeasures comprising MERS-CoV neutralizing antibody treatment or a MERS-CoV spike protein vaccine protected the engineered mice against MERS-CoVinduced ARDS.",

Effective vaccine and therapeutic development require preclinical animal models that resemble the pathogenesis of human MERS-CoV infection. Additionally, these models should: (1) include a measure of mortality associated with severe respiratory disease; (2) not be confounded by neurological complications due to high viral loads in the brain; (3) exhibit sustained, high-level virus replication within the lungs of infected animals; (4) exhibit lung pathology associated with human acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS); (5) maintain innate expression of the MERS-CoV host receptor, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), to prevent perturbation of immunological homeostasis; (6) be genetically tractable to study host genes that regulate responses to MERS-CoV vaccines and therapeutics; and (7) exhibit reproducibility.",

NHPs are instrumental for the preclinical development of therapeutics; however, these models are costprohibitive for initial screening of large numbers of vaccine and therapeutic candidates, challenging to work with for routine pathogenesis studies, limited in availability and typically require high virus challenge doses into multiple sites.

            "text": "MERS-CoV fails to replicate in traditional small-animal models (mouse, hamster, guinea-pig and ferret) due to the inability of the receptor-binding domain in the MERS-CoV spike protein to interact with the respective DPP4 receptor [7] [8] [9] [10] . In addition to acting as the MERS-CoV receptor, DPP4 regulates T-cell activation, cytokine function and trans-endothelial migration to sites of inflammation 11 . Therefore, overexpression of DPP4 may result in immune dysregulation. Effective models would therefore ideally promote functional MERS-CoV/DPP4 interactions, with minimal perturbations of innate DPP4 expression, signalling activity or tissue distribution. Classical strategies to overcome receptor incompatibilities to generate susceptible mice have relied on generalized or tissue-specific transgenic overexpression approaches to drive expression of the human receptor (hDPP4) in the mouse [12] [13] [14] [15] . Although MERS-CoV can elicit respiratory disease in hDPP4 overexpression models, these models exhibit a fatal central nervous system (CNS) and systemic multi-organ disease [12] [13] [14] , probably due to non-specific overexpression of the receptor throughout the animal, which complicates the study of MERS-CoV-induced respiratory pathogenesis in these models.",

This strategy resulted in a mouse that is permissive for MERS-CoV infection, while maximally preserving the species-specific interaction networks critical for DPP4 immune function. Generation of mice carrying a chimaeric mouse DPP4 (mDPP4) molecule (A288L/T330R), combined with a mouse-adapted strain of MERS-CoV, allowed us to generate a mouse model that resembles severe MERS-CoV-induced respiratory disease without bystander neurological disease. In parallel, we demonstrated that this model system can be used for the development and testing of MERS-CoV vaccines and therapeutics.",

We have demonstrated previously that the introduction of two amino acids that match the human sequence at positions 288 and 330 in the mDPP4 receptor can support MERS-CoV docking, entry and replication in cell culture 7 . These determinants are located within exons 10 and 11 of mDPP4 on chromosome 2 ( Fig. 1a and Supplementary Fig. 1 ). Therefore, we used CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing to introduce these determinants (A288L and T330R) into the mDPP4 receptor ( Fig. 1a and Supplementary Table 1 ). Two lines of C57BL/6J-derived mice were generated that were either homozygous (288/330 +/+ ) or heterozygous (288/330 +/\u2212 ) for the chimaeric mDPP4 alleles (Fig. 1a) . The 288/330 +/+ homozygous mice encoded the 288L and 330R changes on both chromosomes, thereby expressing only mDPP4 with both changes (Fig. 1a) . The 288/330 +/\u2212 heterozygous mice encoded the 288L and 330R changes on one chromosome and the C57BL/6J wild-type amino acids, A288 and T330, on the other chromosome, thereby expressing both mutated and wildtype mDPP4 (Fig. 1a) . The innate mDPP4 expression levels and patterns in the lungs, kidneys and brains of 288/330 +/+ and 288/ 330 +/\u2212 mice reflected those observed in C57BL/6J wild-type mice (Fig. 1b,c; Supplementary Fig. 2 ). DPP4 is central to the maintenance of glucose homeostasis in mammals 16 . Blood glucose levels were within the normal range observed in C57BL/6J wildtype mice, supporting the hypothesis that biological mDPP4 functions were not altered in the 288/330 +/+ and 288/330 +/\u2212 mice ( Supplementary Fig. 2) . Moreover, basal CD4 + T-cell expression of interleukin-2, tumour-necrosis factor-\u03b1, interferon-\u03b3, CD69, CD25 and mDPP4 (CD26) from the 288/330 +/+ and 288/330 +/\u2212 lines was comparable to the levels observed in C57BL/6J wild-type mice ( Supplementary Fig. 3 ). Notwithstanding functional T-cell assessment, these results suggested that minimal alteration of the 288 and 330 alleles does not alter basal T-cell activation status. Overall expression levels, expression patterns, biological function and the immunological profiles of mDPP4 were comparable to those of C57BL/6J wild-type mice following site-specific modification of the 288 and 330 alleles.",

In parallel, a MERS-CoV tissueculture-adapted variant, derived by infection of NIH/3T3 cells ectopically expressing the chimaeric mDPP4 (A288L/T330R) receptor, was found to encode a three amino acid insertion (RMR) and a Fig. 4 ).

            "text": "The recombinantly derived MERS-0 virus was mouse adapted by serial passage for 15 rounds through the lungs in 288/330 +/\u2212 mice at 3-day intervals, resulting in the MERS-15 strain. Infection of 288/330 +/+ mice via the intranasal route with MERS-15 resulted in \u223c70% mortality (genuine mortality, rather than mice meeting the typical 20% weight loss cut-off associated with humane euthanasia criteria), while 100% of infected 288/330 +/\u2212 mice survived (Fig. 2a) . However, both lines exhibited 20-25% weight loss by day 6 p.i., in contrast to MERS-0-infected 288/330 +/+ mice or MERS-15-infected C57BL/6J wild-type mice, which exhibited no weight loss (Fig. 2b) . Significantly higher levels of MERS-15 replication were detectable in the lungs of both 288/330 +/+ and 288/330 +/\u2212 mice at days 3 and 6 p.i., while MERS-0 was mostly cleared from the lungs by day 6 p.i. (Fig. 2c,d) . Similar to MER-0, MERS-15 did not replicate in C57BL/6 wild-type mice. Importantly, the observed decreases in survival and weight loss induced by MERS-15 were not confounded by neurological complications from brain infection, as plaque assays for replication-competent virus and PCR with reverse transcription (RT-PCR) at days 3 and 6 p.i. were negative ( Supplementary  Fig. 5 ). Moreover, quantitative RT-PCR on the same samples demonstrated an increase of >10 6 detectable viral transcripts in infected lungs compared with similarly infected C57BL/6J mice, with no detectable viral transcripts in the brains of these mice ( Supplementary Fig. 5c ). Although mortality and weight loss provide important measures of MERS-CoV-induced disease, these parameters do not directly assess the impact of virus replication on respiratory function. Therefore, to directly assess the impact of MERS-15 infection on respiratory function in 288/330 +/+ and 288/330 +/\u2212 mice, we measured respiratory function using unrestrained plethysmography, as demonstrated previously for respiratory pathogenesis in mouse models of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and influenza 17 . MERS-15 elicited severe lung disease as quantified by enhanced pause (Penh), a unitless measure that reflects airway obstruction/restriction due to debris in the airway, and by midtidal expiratory flow (EF 50 ), which represents the flow rate at which 50% of the tidal volume has been expelled in a single breath 17 . MERS-15 infection led to significant increases in both Penh and EF 50 in 288/330 +/+ and 288/330 +/\u2212 mice up to day 6 p.i. compared with 288/330 +/+ mice infected with MERS-0 and C57BL/6J wild-type mice infected with MERS-15 ( Fig. 3a,b) , demonstrating that MERS-15 elicited severe respiratory distress in mice carrying the chimaeric DPP4 receptor. This was further supported by our observation of severe haemorrhage in the lungs of both 288/330 +/+ and 288/330 +/\u2212 mice infected with MERS-15 at days 3 and 6 ( Supplementary Fig. 6 ), inflammatory infiltrates by day 3 (Fig. 3c ) and respiratory pathology associated with severe acute respiratory distress, including hyaline membrane formation, intra-alveolar oedema, perivascular cuffing and severe inflammation, at day 6 p.i. (Fig. 3d ). Quantitative comparison of the lung pathology in 288/330 +/+ mice infected with MERS-15 and MERS-0 demonstrated that MERS-15 induced significant levels of pathology commensurate with ARDS by day 6 p.i. (Supplementary Fig. 7 ). Although we did not conduct an exhaustive assessment of all extrapulmonary tissues in the 288/330 +/+ mice, we could not detect virus replication in the brain, even at doses of 5 \u00d7 10 6 plaque-forming units (p.f.u.) up to day 6 when the humane euthanasia end points were reached, and the pathology observed in our model was consistent with the severe respiratory pathology associated with fatal ARDS in the only published case study of a human MERS-CoV infection 18 .",

Two viral Fig. 8 ), whereas both clonal isolates caused 25-30% weight loss (Fig. 4b ) and high levels of virus replication in the mice up to day 6 p.i., when humane euthanasia end points were reached (Fig. 4c) . The lung pathology elicited by MERS-15 C2 resembled that obtained with the primary MERS-15 virus (Fig. 4d) , demonstrating similar pathologies including oedema, hyaline membrane formation and perivascular cuffing. Sequencing of the entire MERS-15 C2 genome revealed a set of unique missense mutations, acquired during in vivo passaging, in the genes encoding the non-structural proteins, nsP2, nsP6 and nsP8, and a large deletion in orf4b that may be responsible for the enhanced disease observed with MERS-15 ( Supplementary Fig. 9 ). Sequencing of MERS-15 C1 revealed some differences that may influence the capacity of the virus to elicit the increased mortality observed with MERS-15 C2, namely mutations in nsP2 and an expanded deletion that extended from orf4b into orf5 ( Supplementary Fig. 9 ). Moreover, 5\u2032 rapid amplification of cDNA ends revealed that the nucleotide at position 2 of the 5\u2032 untranslated region was deleted in both clones ( Supplementary Fig. 9 ). Generation of an infectious clone harbouring all of the MERS-15 C2 mutations (icMERSma1) demonstrated that the disease could be reproduced with an infectious dose of 5 \u00d7 10 6 p.f.u. (Supplementary Fig. 10 ). Decreasing the dose by 10-fold to 5 \u00d7 10 5 p.f.u. resulted in weight loss that paralleled that observed with 5 \u00d7 10 6 p.f.u.; however, the 5 \u00d7 10 5 p.f.u. dose exhibited a slight decrease in mortality up to day 7 p.i. (Supplementary Fig. 10 ). Although additional studies will be needed, comparative genomic analysis of the two clones, C1 and C2, indicated that nsP2 and Orf5 may have significant roles in determining disease outcome. Therefore, the MERS-15 C2 derived virus, combined with the 288/330 +/+ mouse line, represent useful tools for studying MERS-CoV pathogenesis or assessing therapeutic countermeasures against MERS-CoV-induced ARDS.",

Human monoclonal antibodies provide a robust strategy for the treatment of newly emerged viruses in humans. 3B11 is a human monoclonal antibody that targets the receptor-binding domain of the MERS-CoV spike protein 19 , and is effective in NHPs 5 . As the MERS-15 C2 adapted virus acquired no receptor-binding domain mutations ( Supplementary Fig. 9 ), we reasoned that 3B11 should protect 288/330 +/+ mice from MER-15 C2 challenge. Pretreating mice for 12 h with 3B11 provided 100% protection against MERS-15 C2 challenge (Fig. 5a,b) . Moreover, 3B11 treatment reduced viral loads in the lungs of infected mice to undetectable levels ( Fig. 5c and Supplementary Fig. 11 ) and protected from loss of respiratory function (Fig. 5d ) ( Supplementary  Fig. 11 ), pulmonary haemorrhage ( Supplementary Fig. 11 ) and severe pathological changes ( Supplementary Fig. 12 ). In contrast, pretreatment with isotype control antibody provided no protective effect. Therefore, these data convincingly demonstrated that our preclinical mouse model of severe respiratory disease and mortality can serve as a platform for assessing MERS-CoV therapeutics.",

To examine vaccine efficacy in the 288/330 +/+ MERS-15 C2 model, mice were vaccinated with Venezuelan equine encephalitis replicon particles (VRPs) expressing MERS-CoV spike protein (spike-VRP) or mock vaccinated with VRPs expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP-VRP), boosted at 4 weeks postprime and challenged with MERS-15 C2 at 4 weeks postboost. All mice receiving spike-VRP survived and exhibited no weight loss following challenge compared with GFP-VRP mock-vaccinated animals (Fig. 6a,b) . Spike-VRP vaccination significantly reduced MERS-15 C2 replication in the lungs of infected mice as shown by both plaque titre (Fig. 6c ) and viral antigen staining ( Supplementary Fig. 14) , while also protecting against severe respiratory disease, as assessed by measurement of Penh (Fig. 6d) and EF 50 (Supplementary Fig. 13 ), lung haemorrhage ( Supplementary Fig. 13 ) and pathological indications of severe acute respiratory disease (Supplementary Fig. 14) . Neutralization of MERS-15 C2 with prechallenge serum from spike-VRP-vaccinated mice validated the presence of high-titre neutralizing antibodies in the serum of vaccinated 288/330 +/+ mice (Supplementary Fig. 13 ). Our data demonstrated that the spike-VRP vaccine provoked an adaptive immune response capable of protecting mice from a lethal challenge with MERS-CoV, thereby extending the utility of our preclinical mouse model of severe respiratory disease to include vaccine evaluation. . c, Viral lung titres were determined at day 3 p.i.

Coupled with an inability to elicit escape mutants, 3B11 has also been tested in NHPs 5 , making it an excellent candidate for downstream human studies. However, existing NHP models rely on quantitative RT-PCR, rather than measures of infectious virus, to quantify viral loads, and these models do not reproducibly result in the severe respiratory disease or mortality observed in human MERS patients [1] [2] [3] [4] . Therefore, the results from our model complement the NHP 3B11 studies by directly demonstrating that 3B11 reduces levels of infectious MERS-CoV in the lungs, while preventing severe virus-induced respiratory pathology, loss of respiratory function and mortality.",

Furthermore, MERS-CoV antigen staining localized the virus to pneumocytes and syncytial cells 18 . Infection of type I and II pneumocytes can lead to cell death, as observed in autopsies of patients who have died from severe respiratory infections with influenza virus and SARS-CoV 21, 22 . Moreover, pneumocyte cell death has been proposed to cause decreased respiratory function, as measured by whole-body plethysmography in a mouse model of influenza 23 . Commensurate with these previous studies, our MERS-CoV mouse model demonstrated widespread infection of pneumocytes and pathology consistent with diffuse alveolar damage and severe respiratory disease. This was corroborated by decreased pulmonary function in the MERS-CoV model, as measured by plethysmography, which may be associated with widespread infection and possibly the death of pneumocytes and airway epithelial cells. Therefore, this model system provides the field with the opportunity to investigate the mechanisms that lead to MERS-CoV-induced pathology and severe respiratory disease, in the absence of any CNS complications.",

One limitation of the 288/330 +/+ MERS-CoV model described here was the use of high viral loads to achieve severe, and often fatal, respiratory disease. Further adaptation may allow the use of lower infectious doses that would produce a model of mild disease with subsequent recovery at later time points, as has been described with SARS-CoV 25 .

However, it is important to point out that a balance must be achieved between the virulence of mouseadapted virus, which enhances the model's capacity to replicate human disease phenotypes, and the number of mutations required to significantly reduce the dose lethal to 50% of animals tested. Conventional models using constitutive overexpression of the hDPP4 MERS-CoV receptor have demonstrated widespread infection of extrapulmonary tissues including brain, kidney, liver, spleen and heart [12] [13] [14] , and two of these studies indicated that the mice exhibited multi-organ failure 13, 14 . Furthermore, high viral loads were detected in the brains of mice in the transgenic hDPP4 overexpression models [12] [13] [14] . Importantly, Li et al. 13 concluded that \"mortality correlated with brain infection, suggesting that infection of this organ was most important for the high mortality observed in K18-hDPP4 mice\". While these lethal models have value for vaccine and immunotherapeutic testing 29 , small-molecule inhibitors that are effective in the lung may be limited in their efficacy due to an inability to cross the blood-brain barrier 30 . Similar neurological complications have been observed in model systems for SARS that used overexpression, or tissue-specific constitutive promoters, to express human angiotensin 1-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) in mice 31 . While additional human pathology studies are needed to determine the extent of extrapulmonary sites of MERS-CoV replication and their impact on MERS-CoV disease, it is clear that respiratory replication and pathology is an important aspect of human MERS-CoV disease. Therefore, an important attribute of the 288/330 +/+ model is that the lack of detectable virus replication in the CNS means this model can be used to study MERS-CoVinduced pulmonary disease without the confounding effects of death due to CNS infection.",

            "text": "Recently, a debate has emerged around the safety of performing gain-of-function (GOF) studies with highly pathogenic viruses (such as MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, influenza virus H5N1) (http:// www.gryphonscientific.com/gain-of-function/). As demonstrated here, GOF studies were absolutely necessary to develop a mouse model that reflects the ARDS pathology observed previously in humans infected with respiratory pathogens. Importantly, the GOF studies performed here yielded MERS-CoV strains that reflect the complexity of clinical isolates identified recently in humans, where deletions were identified in ORF3 and ORF4A 32 . Moreover, these GOF studies have allowed us to identify mutations in MERS-CoV proteins that may influence how MERS-CoV interacts with, and possibly circumvents, host immune responses. Nevertheless, future studies to evaluate host factors that contribute to MERS-CoV disease will be constrained in this model, as well as in hDPP4 expression models, by the fact that the mice must be backcrossed to mouse lines harbouring modified endogenous genes, such as knock-out mice. This limitation may be overcome through additional GOF studies that facilitate MERS-CoV adaptation to the innate mDPP4 receptor molecule. The continued threats from novel emerging pathogens, such as Zika virus, will demand the rapid development of physiologically relevant animal models to evaluate therapeutic countermeasures, thereby necessitating virus adaptation to host immunity to achieve effective models. It is critical that the GOF regulatory structure does not impede the development of robust animal models of human disease, which are essential for protecting the public health.",

All RNAs were reverse transcribed under standard conditions in a 20 \u00b5l reaction volume using SuperScript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). MERS-CoV viral RNA was assessed using the following primers at 900 nM in a 20 \u00b5l reaction in a SYBR Green assay with 2\u00d7 SsoAdvanced Universal SYBR Green Supermix (Biorad). The forward primer anneals at the MERS-CoV leader sequence in the 5\u2032 untranslated region (5\u2032-GAATAGCTTGGCTATCTCAC-3\u2032) and the reverse primer anneals in the N gene (5\u2032-TTGTTATCGGCAAAGGAAAC-3\u2032). PCR conditions were 45 cycles of 95\u00b0C for 10 s, 59\u00b0C for 10 s and 72\u00b0C for 15 s. Standard Taqman conditions were used to analyse expression of mDPP4 and 18S rRNAs. The following primers were used for mDPP4: 5\u2032-CCCCAAGACAGTGTGGATTC-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-GAGGATGAGCTGAGAGAGTCTATATTT-3\u2032; probe no. 51 was used from the Roche Universal ProbeLibrary. PCR conditions were 45 cycles of 95\u00b0C for 15 s and 60\u00b0C for 50 s. A 20\u00d7 commercially available primer/probe set was utilized to quantitate the 18S rRNA (Life Technologies).",

Laboratory safety plans were submitted to, and the facility has been approved for use by, the UNC Department of Environmental Health and Safety (EHS) and the CDC. Electronic card access is required for entry into the facility. All workers have been trained by EHS to safely use powered air-purifying respirators, and appropriate work habits in a BSL3 facility and active medical surveillance plans are in place. Our BSL3 facilities contain redundant fans, emergency power to fans, and biological safety cabinets and freezers, and our facilities can accommodate SealSafe mouse racks. Materials classified as BSL3 agents consist of MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, bat CoV precursor strains and mutants derived from these pathogens. Within the BSL3 facilities, experimentation with infectious virus is performed in a certified Class II Biosafety Cabinet. All members of staff wear scrubs, Tyvek suits and aprons, powered air-purifying respirators and shoe covers, and their hands are double-gloved. BSL3 users are subject to a medical surveillance plan monitored by the University Employee Occupational Health Clinic (UEOHC), which includes a yearly physical, annual influenza vaccination and mandatory reporting of any symptoms associated with coronvirus infection during periods when working in the BSL3. All BSL3 users are trained in exposure management and reporting protocols, are prepared to self-quarantine and have been trained for safe delivery to a local infectious disease management department in an emergency situation. All potential exposure events are reported and investigated by EHS and UEOHC, with reports filed to both the CDC and the NIH.",
