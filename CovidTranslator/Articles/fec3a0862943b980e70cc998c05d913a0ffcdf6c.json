            "text": "Three isolectins from cultivated Eucheuma denticulatum were isolated. They were commonly monomeric proteins of about 28 kDa with a range of averaged molecular weights from 27,834 to 27,868 Da among the isolectins and shared almost the same 20 N-terminal amino acid sequences. Complementary DNA (cDNA) cloning based on the rapid amplification cDNA ends (RACE) methods elucidated the full-length sequence of EDA-2 which encodes 269 amino acids, including initiating methionine, with four tandemly repeated domains of about 67 amino acids. The primary structure of EDA-2 is highly similar to those of the highmannose N-glycan specific lectins including Oscillatoria agardhii (OAA) and Burkholderia oklahomensis EO147 (BOA) from cyanobacteria, Myxococcus xanthus (MBHA) and Pseudomonas fluorescens Pf0-1 (PFL) from bacteria, and ESA-2 from a macro red alga. The hemagglutination activities were commonly inhibited by the glycoproteins bearing high-mannose N-glycans, but not by monosaccharides examined, including mannose. In a direct binding experiment with pyridylaminated oligosaccharides, an isolectin EDA-2 exclusively bound to high-mannose type N-glycans, but not to other glycans that include complex types and a core pentasaccharide of N-glycans, indicating that it recognized the branched oligomannoside moiety. Its binding activity was subtly different among the oligomannoside structures examined, showing that the lectin has preference affinity for highmannose type N-glycans with an exposed (\u03b11-3) mannose residue in the D2 arm. Interestingly, EDAs, the mixture of three isolectins inhibited the growth of shrimp pathogenic bacterium, Vibrio alginolyticus, although it did not affect the growth of V. parahaemolyticus and V. harveyi. Growth inhibition of V. alginolyticus with EDAs was not observed in the presence of yeast mannan bearing high-mannose N-glycans, suggesting that EDAs caused the activity through binding to the target receptor(s) on the surface of V. alginolyticus. These results indicate that cultivated carrageenophyte E. denticulatum is a good source of a lectin(s) that may be useful as a carbohydrate probe and an antibacterial reagent.",

            "text": "Lectins, or carbohydrate-binding proteins, are present in various organisms from viruses to mammals and serve as recognition molecules between cells, cell and matrix, and organisms. Owing to the capability of discriminating carbohydrate structures, not only are lectins used as valuable biochemical reagents in many research fields, including glycomics, but they are promising candidates for medicinal and clinical application (Sharon and Lis 2003) . Indeed, antiviral activities have been reported for several lectins (Botos and Wlodawer 2005) . Antihuman immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and/or antiinfluenza virus lectins from bacteria, algae, fungi, and land plants have the common property of binding to high-mannose N-glycans, thereby blocking the entry of viruses into host cells through binding to the mannoside structures in the viral envelope glycoproteins, which are critical for the primary infection of viruses (Balzarini 2006) . The anti-HIV lectins from cyanobacteria (blue-green algae) and eukaryotic macroalgae are presently marked as a new antiviral agent because their HIV-inhibiting activities are extremely strong compared to those of lectins from other biological groups (Zi\u00f3lkowska and Wlodawer 2006; Balzarini 2007) . Practically, a potent anti-HIV lectin, griffithsin, from the red alga Griffithsia sp., has been investigated in detail with this objective (Mori et al. 2005) , as well as some anti-HIV cyanobacterial lectins (Zi\u00f3lkowska and Wlodawer 2006; Sato et al. 2007) . Recently, the high-mannose N-glycan-specific lectins from the red alga Kappaphycus alvarezii (KAA-2) (Sato et al. 2011a ) and the green alga Boodlea coacta (BCA) (Sato et al. 2011b) showed strong anti-HIV and anti-influenza virus activities in a similar manner. Although these anti-HIV lectins share both binding specificity for high-mannose N-glycans and repeated domain structures, they differ from each another in amino acid sequences and recognizing branched mannoside structures, which may lead to subtle differences in the degree of inhibiting activities. Some of high-mannose binding lectins also inhibit the infection of other enveloped viruses such as Ebola virus (Barrientos et al. 2003 ), hepatitis C virus (HCV) (Helle et al. 2006) , and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) ). Thus, highmannose binding lectins may become a useful interesting target for application. Furthermore, antibacterial activities have been reported for lectins from various biological sources (Slifkin and Doyle 1990) . However, little is known about the effects of marine algal lectins towards marine vibrios, except the species-specific activities against vibrios have been reported for the lectins from the red algae, Eucheuma serra and Galaxaura marginata (Liao et al. 2003) . Marine vibrios are halophilic Gram-negative proteobacteria, which occupy a diverse range of ecological niches including sediments, water column, and in association with organisms either as symbionts or pathogens (Tracy et al. 2007) . They cause an economically important disease of fish, marine invertebrates, and are responsible for high mortality rates in aquaculture worldwide (Marhual et al. 2010 ). Among the vibrios, Vibrio alginolyticus and V. parahaemolyticus are quite important, since they cause serious episodes in marine fish and shellfish including shrimp (Zorrilla et al. 2003; Marhual et al. 2010) . In Vietnam, V. alginolyticus, V. parahaemolyticus, and V. harveyi have greatly reduced yields of farmed shrimps (FAO 2013) .",

In Vietnam, E. denticulatum has been cultivated since 2005 from algal seeds that were transported from Bohol, Philippines.

After filtration through a cheese cloth, the filtrate was centrifuged at 3500\u00d7g for 20 min at 4\u00b0C. The supernatant was collected and examined for hemagglutination activity. To the supernatant, cold absolute EtOH (\u221220\u00b0C) was added to attain a final concentration of about 80 % as measured by an alcoholmeter and the mixture was kept at 4\u00b0C overnight. The resulting precipitates were collected by centrifugation at 3500\u00d7g for 30 min at 4\u00b0C and thoroughly dialyzed against 50-mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) containing 0.15-M NaCl.

ORF coded a polypeptide of 269 amino acids including an initiating methionine. The calculated molecular mass of the deduce amino acid sequence in EDA isolectin cDNA was 27.834.19 Da, which was consistent with that of EDA-2, 27,834.2 Da, which was determined by ESI-MS. Thus, we concluded the isolated cDNA encoding EDA-2. The 20 N- terminal amino acid sequence of EDA-2, which had been determined by Edman degradation, was found in the deduced amino acid sequence of EDA-2 cDNA. The primary structure of EDA-2 has four tandemly repeated domains, each consisting of 67 amino acids and sharing 47 % sequence identity (Fig. 5) (Fig. 6) .",

            "text": "The binding activity of EDA-2 differed among highmannose N-glycans examined, being attributed to subtle differences in the structures of branched oligomannosides (Fig. 8, Table 4 ). The binding activity of EDA-2 was considerably decreased when (\u03b11-2)-linked Man is attached at the terminus of D2 arm (5, 7, 9, 10, and 12) , whereas it was not affected but rather enhanced by the presence of (\u03b11-2)-linked Man at the terminus of D1 or D3 arm (4, 6, 8, and 11) . In other words, the attachment of Man (\u03b11-2) at the non-reducing terminus of D2 arm blocked the carbohydrate interaction of EDA-2. This suggests that a C2-OH of the Man (\u03b11-3) residue in the D2 arm may interact directly with the EDA-2 molecule. The Man (\u03b11-3) in the D2 arm may be the primary target for EDA-2 binding because EDA-2 did not interact to the oligosaccharide 14 (0 %) lacking the Man (\u03b11-3) in the D2 arm, whereas it bound to the oligosaccharide 13 (37.1 %) containing this residue, indicating that EDA-2 recognized preferentially the exposed (\u03b11-3) Man in the D2 arm. The similar binding specificity has also been reported for high-mannose binding lectins from the algae such as ESA-2 , KSA-2 (Hung et al. 2011 ) and OAA ). On the other hand, the addition of one (\u03b11-2) Man residue to Man(\u03b11-3)Man\u03b21-unit in the D1 arm notably enhanced the binding activity (binding activity of EDA-2 with PA-oligosaccharides 4 compared to that with 3), indicating that the (\u03b11-2) Man residue attached at Man(\u03b11-3)Man\u03b21unit in the D1 arm serves as another target for enhancing the binding affinity of EDA-2 to oligomannosides. The similar cases have also been reported for the algal lectin ESA-2 (Hori Table 3 Hemagglutination-inhibition test of the three isolectins isolated from E. denticulatum. The hemagglutination-inhibition test was carried out as described in the Materials and methods Sugar and glycoprotein EDA-1 EDA-2 EDA-3 (Hung et al. 2011) , while the binding activity of OAA was not affected by the (\u03b11-2) Man residue(s) in the D1 arm . In contrast, a leaf lectin CRLL from the land plant Cycas revoluta, which belongs to the Jacalin-like superfamily, loses the binding to highmannose glycans in which a (\u03b11-2) Man residue was attached at Man(\u03b11-3)Man\u03b21-unit in the D1 arm, indicating that the addition of (\u03b11-2) Man to the core Man(\u03b11-3)Man\u03b2 had rather a destructive effect on CRLL recognition (Nakamura et al. 2005) . The high-mannose N-glycan recognition profiles basically resemble other lectins from carrageenophytes, including EDA-2, ESA-2 , KSA-2 (Hung et al. 2011), and KAA-2 (Sato et al. 2011a) , whose glycan recognition profiles were also similar to that of OAA, a lectin from the cyanobacterium O. agardhii ), but clearly differed from those of other high-mannose binding lectins such as griffithsin from the red alga Griffithsia sp. (Moulaei et al. 2010) , BCA from the green alga B. coacta (Sato et al. 2011b) , cyanovirin-N from the cyanobacterium Nostoc ellipsosporum (Boyd et al. 1997) , MVL from the cyanobacterium M. viridis (Williams et al. 2005) , SVN from the cyanobacterium Scytonema varium (Bokesch et al. 2003) , ASAs from the garlic A. sativum (Dam et al. 1998; Bachyhawat et al. 2001) , and HRL from the mushroom Hygrophorus russula (Suzuki et al. 2012) . The high-mannose binding affinities of EDA-2, ESA-2, KSA-2, KAA-2, and OAA were impaired by the addition of the terminal (\u03b11-2) Man in D2 arm, while griffithsin, BCA, cyanovirin-N, SVN, and ASAs preferentially recognized the non-reducing terminal (\u03b11-2) Man of the mannosides such as Man 8 GlcNAc 2 and Man 9 GlcNAc 2 (Moulaei et al. 2010; Sato et al. 2011b; Botos et al. 2002; Bokesch et al. 2003; Dam et al. 1998) . MVL recognized the core tetra-and pentasaccharides of high-mannose N-glycans (Williams et al. 2005) , and HRL showed the highest affinity for N-glycan core structure, Man(\u03b11-6)[Man(\u03b11-3)]Man(\u03b21- Fig. 8 The structures of 17 PAoligosaccharides used in this study.

Thus, there seems to be subtle difference in the recognition modes among high-mannose N-glycan-binding lectins.",

Although antibacterial activities have been reported for lectins from various biological sources (Santi-Gadelha et al. 2006; Charungchitrak et al. 2011; Riera et al. 2003) , there seems to be not reported for the growthinhibiting activity against shrimp and fish pathogens, except the high-mannose N-glycan specific lectins from carrageenophytes mentioned above.

Clusters of identical amino acids of EDA-2 were located on both N-and C-terminal regions of each repeated domain, portions of which also correspond to the conserved regions among the four repeated domains of the lectin. Recently, genes coding the lectins belonging to the same lectin family including OAA and ESA-2 have been discovered in several other prokaryotic microorganisms, including cyanobacteria, proteobacteria, chlorobacteria, and in an eukaryotic marine red alga (Sato and Hori 2009; Koharudin et al. 2012) . Similar to members of this lectin family, EDA-2 shared a considerable structure similarity and high-mannose N-glycan binding specificity with ESA-2 ), BOA (Whitley et al. 2013) , OAA Sato and Hori 2009 ), MBHA (Romeo et al. 1986; Koharudin et al. 2012 ) and PFL (Sato et al. 2012) . The lectins in this family are commonly monomeric proteins composed of either two or four tandem repeats of homologous Antibacterial activity and inhibition of antibacterial activity. The growth of V. alginolyticus after incubation at 37\u00b0C for 24 h was measured at absorbance of 600 nm. The inhibitory effect of EDAs against the bacteria growth was expressed in percentage where the inhibition effect of 1 mg mL \u22121 ampicillin (a positive control) was hundred percent and that of non-lectin or -ampicillin supplemented solution (a negative control) was zero percent. EDAs treatment (\u25cb) and EDAs treatment with yeast mannan (\u2022) domains, depending on different family members (Sato and Hori 2009; Koharudin et al. 2012) . From a comparison of the sequences, it is also speculated that the highly conserved segments in both the N-terminal and C-terminal regions may be involved in the carbohydrate binding (Fig. 6) . Although the high-mannose N-glycan recognition profile of EDA-2 was slightly differed from those of the high-mannose binding cyanobacterial lectins such as CV-N (Botos et al. 2002) , MVL (Williams et al. 2005) and SVN (Bokesch et al. 2003) , EDA-2 has no sequence similarity with these cyanobacterial lectins, except for OAA ). The strict specificity for high-mannose oligosaccharides with very high binding affinities seems to be a common feature among the lectins from lower organisms such as cyanobacteria and algae.",

EDAs also inhibited the growth of a marine pathogenic bacterium, V. alginolyticus in dose-dependent manner. The oligosaccharide-binding properties and the primary structure of EDA-2 well resemble those of the antiviral lectins which belong to the high-mannose Nglycan specific lectin family in lower organisms (Sato et al. , 2011a , suggesting that EDA-2 is also predicted to have antiviral and other applicable activities. This study indicates that E. denticulatum might become a candidate for a functional food that can prevent virus infection in the future. Clarifying the structural basis of the recognition mode of the carrageenophyte lectins, including E. denticulatum lectins, should contribute to demonstrate the biological function(s) as well as application of this lectin group.",
