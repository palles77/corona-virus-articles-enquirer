Overall, 79 (17.7%) of 446 had a positive antibody titer by hemagglutination inhibition, with 46 (19.9%) of 231 HCWs and 33 (15.3%) of 215 controls positive (OR 1.37, 95% confi dence interval 0.84-2.22). Of 87 participants who provided a second serum sample, 1 showed a 4-fold rise in antibody titer; of 45 patients who had a nose swab sample taken during a respiratory illness, 7 had positive results. Higher numbers of children in a participant's family and working in an intensive care unit were risk factors for infection; increasing age, working at hospital 2, and wearing gloves were protective factors. This highly exposed group of frontline HCWs was no more likely to contract pandemic (H1N1) 2009 infl uenza infection than nonclinical staff, which suggests that personal protective measures were adequate in preventing transmission.",

Staff members who had no clinical contact were chosen as a convenient surrogate for a community control group. These workers included university and hospital staff in nonpatient contact areas such as the library, information technology, and administration. This study was approved by the Human Research Ethics Committees at each of the hospitals and all participants gave written informed consent. The study was conducted from August 24, 2009, through December 16, 2009. Four tertiary referral hospitals in metropolitan Melbourne were involved: Royal Melbourne, St Vincent's, Austin, and Alfred Hospitals. At all sites, patients with suspected or confi rmed pandemic infl uenza infection were cared for in negative pressure isolation rooms when they were available, and in private rooms when they were not. Institutional infection control policies directed that gloves, gowns, goggles, and masks be used when caring for these patients. Use of N95 masks was initially recommended in all hospitals, although hospital 1 changed to surgical masks after June 16, 2009 . Hand hygiene with an alcohol-based product and respiratory etiquette were promoted at all hospitals.",

Miller et al. reported that 89.1% of participants with pandemic (H1N1) 2009 had an antibody titer of >32 three weeks after infection, although a baseline serum sample was not taken; therefore, seroconversion could not be demonstrated (17) . None of the participants with positive PCR results reported taking NIs, and all had serum samples taken >2 weeks after the positive nose swab specimen, allowing suffi cient time for seroconversion. Our results are likely to be true positives, as all swabs were only taken when patients were symptomatic. Previously, virus isolation has been the gold standard for infl uenza detection but RT-PCR is now considered to be more sensitive and specifi c. A previous study by some of the current authors has shown that seroconversion occurs in 80%-90% of serum samples if they are tested a suffi cient time after infection (confi rmed by RT-PCR) (19) . Nasal swabs are a relatively peripheral type of sample (20) . If viral load is low in the nose, the sample may be insuffi cient as an antigenic stimulus to induce a detectable level of seroconversion in the serum. This may be the explanation for the lack of seroconversion seen in some PCR-positive cases in this study. Because the number of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 cases in Victoria was low by the time this study commenced, we used a single antibody measurement for diagnosis in most patients. This is not ideal, because some participants may have had preexisting cross-reactive antibodies, as reported by others (15, 16) . However, this cross-reactivity has been most commonly found in older persons >65 years of age, a population which was underrepresented in our study. The explanation given for presence of cross-reactive antibodies in older persons has been past exposure to other antigenically similar viruses or a lifetime exposure to infl uenza A virus (17) . Because this exposure could not have occurred in our younger study participants (median age 38 years) and serum samples were collected toward the end of the pandemic wave when many would have already been exposed, reactivity likely was specifi c to pandemic (H1N1) 2009. These factors support the use of a single antibody measurement for diagnosis.",

However, many of the predictor variables were not subject to recall bias (e.g., clinical or nonclinical status, work place, age, gender, occupation, and number of children in the household). In addition, in order to infl uence the results, the 2 exposure groups would have had to exhibit differential recall. Although it could be postulated that HCWs may have perceived that they were at greater risk for exposure and may have therefore been more conscientious when fi lling out questionnaires, we believe that because of the large amount of public awareness of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 at that time, it is unlikely that this group would have been more conscientious than the nonclinical group.",
