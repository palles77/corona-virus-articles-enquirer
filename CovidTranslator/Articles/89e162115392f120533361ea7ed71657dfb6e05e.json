            "text": "Nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-nB) is a critical regulator of innate and adaptive immune function as well as cell proliferation and survival. The present study demonstrated for the first time that a virus belonging to the Arteriviridae family activates NF-nB in MARC-145 cells and alveolar macrophages. In porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV)-infected cells, NF-nB activation was characterized by translocation of NF-nB from the cytoplasm to the nucleus, increased DNA binding activity, and NF-nB-regulated gene expression. NF-nB activation was increased as PRRSV infection progressed and in a viral dose-dependent manner. UV-inactivation of PRRSV significantly reduced the level of NF-nB activation. Degradation of InB protein was detected late in PRRSV infection, and overexpression of the dominant negative form of InBa (InBaDN) significantly suppressed NF-nB activation induced by PRRSV. However, InBaDN did not affect viral replication and viral cytopathic effect. PRRSV infection induced oxidative stress in cells by generating reactive oxygen species (ROS), and antioxidants inhibited NF-nB DNA binding activity in PRRSV-infected cells, suggesting ROS as a mechanism by which NF-nB was activated by PRRSV infection. Moreover, NF-nB-dependent expression of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 and MMP-9 was observed in PRRSV-infected cells, an observation which implies that NF-nB activation is a biologically significant aspect of PRRSV pathogenesis. The results presented here provide a basis for understanding molecular pathways of pathology and immune evasion associated with disease caused by PRRSV. D",

PRRSV causes one of the most economically important diseases of swine which is characterized by severe and sometimes fatal respiratory disease and reproductive failure. Infection with PRRSV also predisposes pigs to infection by bacterial and viral pathogens such as Steptococcus suis, Haemophilus parasuis, Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae, Acti-nobaccillus pleuropneumoniae, Salmonella spp., and swine influenza virus (Benfield et al., 1992; Done and Paton, 1995; Galina et al., 1994; Groschup et al., 1993; Kawashima et al., 1996; Zeman et al., 1993) . The most consistent pathological lesions caused by PRRSV during acute infection are interstitial pneumonia and mild lymphocytic encephalitis (Halbur et al., 1995; Plagemann, 1996; Rossow et al., 1995 Rossow et al., , 1996 . Tissue macrophages and monocytes are the major target cells during both acute and persistent infection (Molitor et al., 1997) , although pneumocytes and epithelial germ cells of the testis have also been shown to be infected (Sur et al., 1996 (Sur et al., , 1997 .",

NF-nB is an inducible transcription factor that plays a key role in inflammation, innate immune responses, the regulation of cell proliferation, and cell survival (Caamano and Hunter, 2002; Li and Verma, 2002) . Activation of NF-nB by viral infection is a key trigger to inducing type I interferon (IFN) transcription and other immune responses, including pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, adhesion molecules, matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), cyclooxygenase 2 (COX2), and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) (Caamano and Hunter, 2002; Santoro et al., 2003) . These molecules are involved in initiating adaptive immune responses by recruiting immune cells to the site of infection. Furthermore, it was recently demonstrated that temporally activated NF-nB confers an essential innate antiviral response against cytoplasmic RNA viruses (human parainfluenza virus type 3 and respiratory syncytial virus) in an IFN-independent manner, showing the importance of NF-nB in the innate antiviral response (Bose et al., 2003) .",

The predominant form is a heterodimer composed of p50 and RelA subunits . When inactive, NF-nB is sequestered in the cytoplasm by associating with inhibitory proteins of the InB family, including InBa, InBh, and InBe, which mask the nuclear localization signal. In response to a wide range of stress signals (e.g., lipopolysaccharide (LPS), tumor necrosis factor (TNF), interleukin (IL)-1, and virus infection), the inactive NF-nB-InB complex is dissociated via serine phosphorylation by InB kinase (IKK) and degradation of InB in proteasomes. These events lead to the unmasking of the nuclear localization sequence of NF-nB, which then allows NF-nB to enter the nucleus and activate transcription of target genes .",

            "text": "While the immune response against PRRSV is not fully characterized, experimental work has demonstrated that the adaptive immune response of PRRSV-infected pigs is generally ineffective (Horter et al., 2002; Murtaugh et al., 2002; Wills et al., 1997 Wills et al., , 2003 . Specific evidence of an ineffective adaptive immune response includes a slow neutralizing antibody response, which is typically not detected until 3 weeks p.i. (Albina et al., 1998b) and does not reach maximum levels until 10 -18 weeks p.i. (Nelson et al., 1994; Yoon et al., 1995) . While the importance of a cellmediated response for protection against PRRSV is well accepted, the effectiveness of this response during the early phases of disease also appears to be suboptimal (Murtaugh et al., 2002) . For example, the T-cell response to PRRSV is weak and transient and cannot be re-stimulated for more than 4 weeks post-challenge (Molitor et al., 1997; Xiao et al., 2004) . Additionally, IFN-g responses of PRRSVinfected pigs were relatively weak and increased slowly in comparison to pseudorabies-virus-infected pigs (Meier et al., 2003) . Although the precise mechanisms for the ineffective nature of the adaptive immune response to PRRSV are not known, PRRSV evasion of the innate immune responses, such as the type I IFN response, may set the stage for subsequent subversion of the adaptive immune response. Previous studies demonstrated that PRRSV appears to elicit weak innate interferon and cytokine responses compared to other viruses such as swine influenza virus (SIV), porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV), transmissible gastroenteritis (TGE) virus, and pseudorabies virus (Albina et al., 1998a; Meier et al., 2003; Van Reeth and Nauwynck, 2000; Van Reeth et al., 1999 . Because NF-nB is important for regulation of type I IFN and After 48 h, cells were fixed and permeabilized followed by IFA. Nuclear translocation of NF-nB was detected by confocal laser microscopy with FITC staining following incubation with a specific antibody recognizing the NF-nB p65 subunit. (B) Nuclear translocation of NF-nB detected by Western blot of nuclear extracts from MARC-145 cells and PAM cultures. Both cell types were infected with PRRSV at MOI = 0.1. At 5, 24, 36, 48, and 60 (only in PAM) h post-infection, nuclear extracts were prepared and subjected to Western blot analysis, as described in Materials and methods.",

Following infection with PRRSV, NF-nB p65 DNA binding activity increased as PRRSV infection progressed. Although a slight, though statistically significant decrease was consistently observed at 24 h p.i. in PAM cultures (but not MARC-145 cells), the predominant effect of PRRSV infection in both cell types was an increase in NF-nB DNA binding activity. As shown in Fig. 2 , significant increases in NF-nB DNA binding activity in PRRSV-infected cells were measured, especially at 36 and 48 h p.i, compared with that in mock-infected cells. At 48 h p.i., NF-nB p65 DNA binding activities increased 5.7-fold in MARC-145 cells and 2.2-fold in PAM cultures. The NF-nB DNA binding activity observed in these assays was ablated by an excess of unlabeled competitor, but not by an excess of unlabeled noncompetitor (data not shown).

Therefore, luciferase expression is under control of NF-nB activation. After transfection, cells were infected with PRRSV for 1 h or left uninfected.

In some viral infections, binding of the viral particle to a cellular surface receptor is sufficient to trigger signaling cascades that activate NF-nB. To test this possibility, UV-inactivated PRRSV was used to determine if PRRSV binding to its receptor mediates NF-nB activation. As shown in Fig. 3B , UV-inactivation of PRRSV decreased NF-nB activation compared to infection with noninactivated (fully infectious) PRRSV. NF-nB-regulated gene expression was reduced from 3.34-fold to 1.43-fold at MOI = 1, from 1.99-fold to 1.15 at MOI = 0.1, and from 1.42-fold to 0.96-fold at MOI = 0.01.

Therefore, it was determined if PRRSV-mediated changes in the InB proteins correlated with increased NF-nB activity. Protein levels of InBa, InBh, and InBe were monitored by Western blot analysis following a time course of infection in MARC-145 cells and PAM cultures. Results in Fig. 4 show that InBa, InBh, and InBe were found in uninfected MARC-145 cells and PAMs and the protein levels were mostly unchanged throughout the time course. In MARC-145 cells (Fig. 4A ), PRRSV infection resulted in a lower concentration of InBa at 48 h p.i. compared to uninfected control cells, suggesting proteosomal degradation of InBa. This correlated with the highest NF-nB activity at 48 h p.i. among the time points tested. However, InBa was still weakly detectable in PRRSV-infected cells at late times p.i. InBh and InBe remained relatively constant at all time points in PRRSV-infected MARC-145 cells. In PAM cultures, degradation of InBa and InBe was detected after PRRSV infection at 48 h and 60 h p.i. as shown in Fig. 4B . The degradation of InBh protein was detected at 60 h p.i. The onset of the degradation of InB proteins correlated with the NF-nB activation later in PRRSV infection as observed above.

To determine if ROS induction by PRRSV contributed to activation of NF-nB, cells were treated with antioxidants and NF-nB binding activity was measured at 48 h p.i. The DNA binding activity of NF-nB p65 was markedly reduced in PRRSV-infected cells when treated with the antioxidant PDTC or NAC as shown in Fig. 7B . The highest concentration of PDTC or NAC used in this experiment reduced NF-nB activity to less than 30% in PRRSV-infected cells. To rule out that the observed effect is simply due to inhibition of viral replication by antioxidants, virus titer was determined at 24 and 48 h p.i. (Fig. 7C) . PRRSV replication was not significantly affected by either PDTC or NAC in all concentration tested. ",

Despite years of research, little is known about intracellular signaling pathways that play key roles after PRRSV infection and the role of these pathways in PRRSV pathogenesis. The present study demonstrated for the first time that a virus belonging to the Arteriviridae family activates NF-nB in host cells and that potential mechanisms of PRRSV-mediated NF-nB activation are derived from the InB protein degradation and ROS induction. The major target cells of PRRSV in vivo are tissue macrophages such as PAMs. MARC-145 cells are the only continuous cell line that is highly permissive for PRRSV infection (Kim et al., 1993) , and they are typically used for in vitro experiments of PRRSV as well as virus maintenance and attenuation in the laboratory. Viruses could have different effects on NF-nB pathways depending on the cell type infected as demonstrated in Epstein-Barr virus and measles virus infection (Devergne et al., 1996; Dhib-Jalbut et al., 1999; Dreyfus et al., 1999; Fang et al., 2001; Helin et al., 2001) . Therefore, in the present study, both MARC-145 cells and PAM cultures were used to determine if PRRSV activates the NF-nB pathway. This study showed that PRRSV infection resulted in increased nuclear translocation of NF-nB and increased DNA binding activity both in MARC-145 cells and PAM cultures. In addition, NF-nBdependent luciferase expression was significantly increased in MARC-145 cells by PRRSV infection. Although the NF-nB reporter assay was not successfully performed in PAM cultures (due to extremely low transfection efficiencies of PAM cultures), results presented here clearly demonstrated that PRRSV activates the NF-nB pathway in both its natural target cells, PAM, as well as in a continuous cell line, MARC-145 cells.",

            "text": "Viruses have developed various strategies which lead to either activation or inhibition of NF-nB-dependent gene transcription for their benefits (Santoro et al., 2003) . The NF-nB pathway can be activated as a protective response of the host to viruses. Therefore, some viruses, such as vaccinia virus, African swine fever virus, influenza A virus, and mengovirus, have evolved strategies to block NF-nB activation in order to evade the innate immune response (Powell et al., 1996; Shisler and Jin, 2004; Wang et al., 2000; Zoll et al., 2002) . The NF-nB pathway can also be activated directly by viruses. Viruses including HIV, herpesviruses, hepatitis C virus, encephalomyocarditis virus, reovirus, dengue virus, West Nile virus, and herpes simplex virus have evolved strategies to activate NF-nB to exploit NF-nB for optimized replication, or to control host cell proliferation and survival to maximize viral progeny production (Connolly et al., 2000; Goodkin et al., 2003; Jan et al., 2000; Santoro et al., 2003; Schwarz et al., 1998; Waris et al., 2003) . Despite the importance of the NF-nB pathway in immune response, it has not been determined if PRRSV or other arteriviruses modulate this pathway. Previous studies demonstrated that PRRSV induced weak type I IFN responses (Albina et al., 1998a; Lee et al., 2004; Miller et al., 2004; Van Reeth et al., 1999) . Therefore, it has been postulated that PRRSV inhibited the NF-nB pathway to evade antiviral responses of host cells. However, the present study provides evidence that PRRSV actually activates the NF-nB pathway in PAMs, which are primary target cells in vivo. The synthesis of type I IFN is regulated trascriptionally and post-transcriptionally, and various transcription factors such as the interferon regulatory factor (IRF) family as well as NF-nB may be involved (Hiscott et al., 2003; Taniguchi and Takaoka, 2002; Wathelet et al., 1998) . Therefore, it is possible that PRRSV blocks IFN gene expression at transcriptional and/or post-transcription levels but does not inhibit the NF-nB pathway. Fig. 8 . PRRSV increases MMP-2 and MMP-9 gene expression through an NF-nB-dependent pathway. MARC-145 cells were infected with PRRSV for 48 h at MOI = 0.1, and total RNA was extracted and treated with DNase I. Quantitative real-time RT-PCR was performed for MMP-2 or MMP-9 specific primers. Results are expressed as relative fold changes of MMP-2 or MMP-9 mRNA using cyclophilin as an internal control. Values are shown as the means T SD from triplicate wells and represent two independent experiments. *P < 0.001 compared to Ad-eGFP/PRRSVinfected cells.",

Activation of NF-nB is usually mediated by degradation of InBa in a proteasome-dependent mechanism after phosphorylation by IKK (Hayden and Ghosh, 2004) . InBa is generally thought to be the major inhibitor of NF-nB activation. NF-nB activation by influenza virus is mediated by oxidative radicals and activation of IKK as a result of overexpression of viral proteins in endoplasmic reticulum (Flory et al., 2000) . The Tax transactivator oncoprotein of human T-lymphotropic virus-1 activates NF-nB by interacting directly with IKK (O'Mahony et al., 2004) . HSV-1 induces persistent translocation of NF-nB by InBa degradation (Patel et al., 1998) . In this study, Western blot analysis of InB protein levels revealed that InBa protein was degraded in PRRSV-infected cells and the expression of InBa-DN eliminated NF-nB activation by PRRSV. This finding demonstrates that NF-nB activation by PRRSV is mediated at least in part by InBa degradation in MARC-145 cells and the degradation of InBa, InBh, and InBe in PAM cultures. This result indicates the possibility that different molecules are involved in NF-nB activation in PAM culture infected with PRRSV compared to MARC-145 cells. However, the precise mechanism through which PRRSV influences the InB degradation in both cells is presently unknown.",

However, it is unlikely that NF-nB activation by PRRSV is triggered solely by viral binding to its cognate cellular receptor because the level of NF-nB activation by PRRSV increased as PRRSV replication progression was significantly reduced by UV-inactivation of virus. Therefore, it is possible that PRRSV replication or viral protein expression is a prerequisite for activation of the NF-nB pathway.",

            "text": "Previous studies have demonstrated a requirement for NF-nB activation in viral replication. Influenza virus infection is dependent on an active NF-nB signaling pathway (Nimmerjahn et al., 2004) . Inhibition of NF-nB activation blocked influenza virus infection of susceptible cells, and cells with low NF-nB activity were poorly susceptible to influenza virus infection (Nimmerjahn et al., 2004) . Efficient replication of HSV-1 is promoted by NF-nB activation through the InB kinase-InB-p65 pathway (Gregory et al., 2004) . However, blocking the NF-nB pathway by overexpression of dominant negative forms of InBa did not interfere with PRRSV replication, suggesting that activation of the NF-nB pathway is non-essential for efficient viral replication. Similarly, other studies with Japanese encephalitis virus or cytomegalovirus demonstrated that NF-nB activation is not required for efficient viral replication (Benedict et al., 2004; Liao et al., 2001) . Although NF-nB activation does not play an essential role in PRRSV replication in vitro, it does not mean that NF-nB has no contribution to PRRSV pathogenesis in vivo. Macrophages represent an important source for a variety of soluble immune mediators, including cytokines, chemokines, MMPs, and adhesion molecules which often contain NF-nB binding sites in their promoters (Caamano and Hunter, 2002; Kim and Koh, 2000; Li and Verma, 2002; Mogensen and Paludan, 2001) . The MMPs are a group of zinc-and calcium-dependent endopeptidases that degrade an extracellular matrix implicated in tissue remodeling and chronic inflammation. MMPs, especially MMP-2 and MMP-9, play a role in immune responses by promoting infiltration of inflammatory cells (Kumagai et al., 1999) . A previous study demonstrated that PRRSV infection significantly increased MMP-2 and MMP-9 which correlated with the appearance of severe histological lung lesions characterized by massive lymphomononuclear cell infiltration and possible local immunosuppression in PRRSV-infected pigs. Therefore, it is possible that MMPs produced in PRRSV-infected cells by NF-nB activation could mediate the influx of new cells of the monocyte/macrophage lineage.",

After centrifugation, cell pellets were resuspended in RPMI-1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 2 mM l-glutamine, 0.25 Ag/ml fungizone, 100 U/ml penicillin, 10 Ag/ml streptomycin sulfate, and 5 Ag/ml gentamicin (BioWhittaker, Walkersville, MD) and plated at a density of 2 -4 \u00c2 10 5 cells/well in a 24-well Primaria plate (Becton Dickinson and Company, Franklin Lakes, NJ) . The PAM cultures were confirmed to be PRRSV-negative by RT-PCR before used in subsequent experiments. PAM cultures were incubated for 24 h at 37 -C in a humidified 5% CO 2 incubator and washed once with complete RPMI-1640 media before use. All cells were maintained at 37 -C in a humidified 5% CO 2 incubator.",

The pRL-TK plasmid contains the Renilla reniformis (sea pansy) luciferase gene under the transcriptional control of the herpesvirus thymidine kinase promoter and constitutively expresses low levels of renillar luciferase. The pNF-nBluc plasmid contains the firefly luciferase gene under the transcriptional control of a synthetic promoter containing five direct repeats of the NF-nB binding element. After transfection, cells were mock-infected or infected with viruses at the indicated MOI. At various time points post-infection, cell monolayers were lysed in 150 Al of passive lysis buffer (Promega, Madison, WI) followed by cell lysate analysis for both luciferase activities by using the Dual Luciferase Reporter assay (Promega, Madison, WI). Luciferase activity was measured as relative light units (RLUs) using a luminometer (Turner BioSystems, Inc. Sunnyvale, CA). For all assays, experiments were performed in triplicate. For each experimental point, the average of the firefly luciferase activity was divided by the average of sea pansy luciferase activity to correct for differences in transfection efficiencies. The resulting ratios were used to compare the expression of the firefly luciferase gene in virus-infected cells to that present in uninfected (mock) cells.",
