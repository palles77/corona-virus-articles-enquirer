As a Class 2 solvent with less severe toxicity, content of residual 1,4dioxane in this newly developed scaffold should be rigorously controlled when it is translated to clinical use. In this study, a headspace gas chromatography-mass spectrometric (HS-GC-MS) method and related testing protocol were developed for quantitative determination of 1,4dioxane in the PLGA/TCP composite scaffolds. Methods: Matrix effect analysis was used to optimise the pretreatment method of the scaffolds. Then, the procedure for testing 1,4-dioxane using HS-GC-MS was set up. The accuracy, precision, and robustness of this newly developed quantitative method were also validated before quantification of 1,4-dioxane in the scaffolds with different drying procedures. Results: Dimethyl formamide (DMF) was the optimal solvent for dissolving scaffolds for GC-MS with proper sensitivity and without matrix effect. Then, the optimised procedure was determined as: the scaffolds were dissolved in DMF and kept at 90 C for 40 minutes, separated on a HP-5MS column, and detected by mass spectroscopy.

The linear range for 1,4-dioxane was determined as 1e40 ppm with linear correlation coefficient ! 0.9999. Intraday and interday precision was determined as being within relative standard deviation of below 0.68%. The passable drying procedure was related to lyophilising (\u00c050 C, 50 Pa) the scaffolds for 2 days and drying in vacuum (50 Pa) for 7 days. Conclusion: This is the first quantitative method established to test 1,4-dixoane in a novel scaffold. This method was validated with good accuracy and reproducibility, and met the methodological requirements of the Guideline 9101 documented in the Chinese Pharmacopoeia 2015 Edition. The translational potential of this article: This quantitative method for determination of residual 1,4-dioxane in the novel scaffolds is a key technical method during its translation into clinical use because this method is an important and indispensable file in the enterprise standard when the porous scaffold is registered as a Class III implanted medical device for bone defect repair, which is used to guarantee the safety of the scaffolds. It is also applied to optimise the drying process of scaffolds and to monitor the quality of scaffolds in the industrialisation process. Further, this method provides references for other solvents quantitative determination in porous scaffolds or materials.",

As a newly developed medical product, safety issues are considered as the most important ones. As a Class 2 solvent with less severe toxicity, content of residual 1,4-dioxane in the novel 3D printing PLGA/TCP scaffolds should be rigorously controlled [26] . We first developed an HS-GC-MS method for testing 1,4-dioxane in PLGA/TCP porous scaffolds. This method utilised a reproducible and highly recovery sample preparation process, a more efficient separation technology, and a specific singleion monitoring mass detection to quantify 1,4-dioxane in PLGA/TCP porous scaffolds. Different from the liquid or liquid-like sample [29, 30] , 1,4-dioxane should be extracted from the solid scaffold at the first step. Four solutions were used; as a result, the detected amount of 1,4-dioxane was exactly inversely related to its solubility in different solution, and Na 2 CO 3 solution showed the highest sensitivity due to the saltingout effect [32] . However, as the first method to test the gas from a solid porous structure, we further investigated the matrix effects of the different solutions. There were two different extraction systems, one in Na 2 CO 3 solution, retaining the porous structure of the scaffolds, and the other in DMF solution without any porous structures. In DMF solution, the scaffolds were dissolved into powders, and 1,4-dioxane was distributed in solution phase and gas phase. The detected amount was determined by its solubility in DMF, so the detected amount of 1,4-dioxane were the same in DMF with or without matrix blank scaffolds. In Na 2 CO 3 solution with the matrix blank scaffold, 1,4dioxane was distributed in three phases: scaffold, solution, and gas, and the detected amount was determined not only the solubility in Na 2 CO 3 but also the attachment in the porous scaffolds. Thus, the detected amount of 1,4dioxane in Na 2 CO 3 solution only was more than that in the Na 2 CO 3 solution with matrix blank scaffolds ( Figure 2C ). The fabricated porous scaffolds had both regular macropores, with the size among 300 mm to 500 mm, as well as irregular micropores with size from 5 mm to 50 mm pores (Figure 1Be1F) [11, 13] , which might be the cause of matrix effects. Thus, we selected DMF to extract 1,4-dioxane from the scaffolds as the pretreatment process of the GC-MS methods. The following method's validation results further confirmed the feasibility of this procedure.",

Our results showed that 1,4-dioxane in the scaffolds lyophilised (\u00c050 C, 50 Pa) for 2 days and then dried in vacuum (25 C, 50 Pa) for 7 days were below 380 ppm (Figure 4) . After examining the three-phase diagram of 1,4-dioxane, we found that the conditions of \u00c050 C and 50 Pa for lyophilising are not efficient for removing 1,4-dioxane ( Figure S1 ) because in this environment 1,4-dioxane prefers solid rather than gas; therefore, we will further optimise the drying process by lowering the pressure or increasing the temperature to improve the freeze-dry efficiency. Our newly established quantitative method will also be used to verify this hypothesis.",
