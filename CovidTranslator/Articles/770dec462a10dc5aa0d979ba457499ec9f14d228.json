Several events over the past three decades signal a shift in terrorism trends: the intentional contamination of restaurant salad bars with Salmonella by a religious cult trying to influence a local election in The Dalles, Oregon in 1984; 3 the revelations that Aum Shinrikyo, the Japanese cult responsible for the sarin gas attack in the Tokyo subway system in 1995 experimented on multiple occasions with aerosolizing anthrax from downtown Tokyo rooftops; the findings of massive quantities of weaponized biologic agents in Iraq following the first Gulf War; 4 and the domestic anthrax attacks in the USA in 2001.",

The anthrax attacks in 2001 evoked fear and anxiety and diverted public health and healthcare resources away from other critical activities despite the limited number of casualties associated with the event.

For large-scale bioterrorism, biologic agents must undergo complex processes of production, cultivation, chemical modification and weaponization. Therefore, state sponsorship or direct support from organizations with significant resources and infrastructure would predictably be required to incite such events. 5 However, some threat agents may be acquired by terrorist groups on the black market. 6 Additionally, the anthrax attacks in the USA in late 2001 illustrated the devastating results that can be achieved with relatively primitive delivery methods, e.g. high-speed mail-sorting equipment and mailed letters.",

Unlike other weapons, most biologic agents are associated with a clinical latency period of days to weeks, during which time exposed individuals are asymptomatic, making early detection difficult. Additionally, specific antimicrobial therapy and/or vaccines are available for the treatment and prevention, respectively, of illness caused by biologic weapons; casualties from other forms of WMD can generally only be treated by decontamination, trauma mitigation, and supportive care.",

Details of the microbiology and pathogenesis of anthrax are found in Chapter 134. In nature anthrax is a zoonotic disease of herbivores that is prevalent in many geographic regions; sporadic human disease results from The serious events following the outbreak were related to inhalational disease. Therefore, planning for larger-scale events with aerosolized anthrax is warranted. The differential diagnoses of cutaneous and inhalational anthrax are described in Table 75 -3. The lesion of cutaneous anthrax may be similar in appearance to other lesions, including cutaneous forms of other agents of bioterrorism; however, it may be distinguished by epidemiologic as well as certain clinical features. Anthrax is traditionally a painless lesion, unless secondarily infected, and it is associated with significant local edema (Figure 75-1) . The bite of Loxosceles reclusa, the brown recluse spider, shares many of the local and systemic features of anthrax but is typically painful from the outset and lacks significant edema. 18 Cutaneous anthrax may be associated with systemic disease and its attendant mortality in up to 20% of cases if untreated; with appropriate therapy, mortality is <1%. 16 Once the inhaled endospores reach the alveoli, they are phagocytosed by macrophages and transported to regional lymph nodes, where they germinate into vegetative bacteria and, subsequently, disseminate hematogenously. 14 The bacteria generate potent exotoxins, lethal toxin and edema toxin, which lead to hemorrhagic mediastinitis, systemic illness and death. Spores may remain latent for extended periods of time in the host, up to 100 days in some experimental animal models, 17 resulting in prolonged clinical incubation periods following exposure to endospores. Cases of inhalational anthrax occurred up to 43 days after exposure in the Sverdlovsk experience, although the average incubation period is 2-10 days, perhaps influenced by inoculum. 15 Although the clinical experience derived from the 2001 USA attacks had much in common with the clinical manifestations of inhalational anthrax noted in the Sverdlovsk cases, some novel findings emerged. Of 11 confirmed cases of inhalational anthrax, 5 (45%) died. Although this contrasts with a case fatality rate of greater than 85% reported from Sverdlovsk, the reliability of reported data from the latter outbreak is questionable 17 and, perhaps more importantly, patients in the 2001 outbreak were more likely to receive appropriate treatment at an earlier stage.",

Data suggest that discrimination between inhalational anthrax and benign, influenza-like illnesses may be possible on the basis of initial symptoms: shortness of breath, nausea, and vomiting are significantly more common in anthrax, while rhinorrhea is uncommonly seen in anthrax but noted in the majority of community-acquired viral respiratory infections. 20 Other common clinical manifestations of inhalational anthrax include abdominal pain, headache, mental status abnormalities and hypoxemia. Abnormalities on chest radiography appear to be universally present, although these may only be identified retrospectively in some cases. Pleural effusions are the most common abnormality; infiltrates, consolidation and/or mediastinal adenopathy/widening are noted in the majority of cases (Figure 75-2a) . Mediastinal adenopathy appears to be an early indicator of disease; CT scan is more sensitive than chest radiographs for this finding (Figure 75-2b) . In the 2001 outbreak, more than 80% of cases were noted to have mediastinal widening with or without pleural effusions or infiltrates.",

They subsequently develop a centrifugally distributed eruption that initially involves the face and extremities and then generalizes as it evolves through macular, papular, vesicular, and pustular stages in synchronous (i.e. lesions progress concurrently and have similar appearances diffusely) fashion over approximately 8 days, with umbilication in the latter stages (Figure 75-6 ). An oropharyngeal enanthem typically precedes the exanthem by 1 or 2 days; this is indicative of high titer viral replication in the upper respiratory tract and correlates with high infectivity. The rash generally remains denser peripherally and typically involves the palms and soles in its early stages, a potentially useful clue in narrowing the differential diagnosis (Figure 75-7) . The umbilicated pustules begin crusting during the second week of the eruption. Separation of scabs is usually complete by the end of the third week, but the course of the systemic illness may be attenuated and the appearance of the exanthem milder in those with partial, have been weaponized for use in bioterrorism although their actual use has never been documented. 4 Botulinum toxin is considered to be the most toxic molecule known; it is lethal to humans in minute quantities and acts by blocking the release of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine from presynaptic vesicles, thereby inhibiting muscle contraction. 34 Botulism presents with the clinical features of an acute, afebrile, symmetric, descending, flaccid paralysis without mental status or sensory changes. The disease manifests initially in the bulbar musculature; fatigue, dizziness, dysphagia, dysarthria, diplopia, dry mouth, dyspnea, ptosis, ophthalmoparesis, tongue weakness and facial muscle paresis are early findings seen in more than 75% of cases. Progressive muscular involvement leads to respiratory failure in untreated cases. The clinical presentations of food-borne and inhalational botulism are indistinguishable in experimental animals. 34 The diagnosis of botulism is based largely on epidemiologic and clinical features and the exclusion of other possible differential diagnoses (see Table 75 -3); there is no commercial assay currently available to confirm intoxication. While sporadic or clustered cases occur regularly, albeit infrequently in higher-income countries, it must be recognized that any single case of botulism could be the result of bioterrorism or could herald a larger-scale event. Certainly, large numbers of epidemiologically unrelated, geographically dispersed or multifocal cases should raise the specter of an intentional release of the agent, either in food/water supplies or as an aerosol.",

The potential effectiveness, feasibility, legality and consequences of quarantine were reviewed following the USA anthrax attacks. 40 The logistics of this approach are complex and impractical and it can be associated with adverse consequences such as increased risk of disease transmission among a quarantined group or public unrest.

For these reasons, physicians (and specifically infectious diseases specialists) are likely first responders to bioterrorism and must keep their diagnostic and clinical skills current and remain clinically vigilant to potential threat agents. Because we clinicians are expected to be reliable sources of information for our patients, colleagues and public health authorities, we must guard against the inexorable 'bioterrorism fatigue' that may otherwise result from a persistent state of heightened readiness without an actual event taking place. 5 References available online at expertconsult.com.",

Acute anxiety reactions and exacerbations of chronic psychiatric illness during the stress of the event, or post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in its aftermath may affect clinical victims of bioterrorism as well as healthcare workers and other first responders. Nearly half of the emergency department visits during the Gulf War missile attacks in Israel in 1991 were related to acute psychological illness or exacerbations of underlying behavioral problems. 41 Data from recent acts of terrorism in the USA suggest that PTSD and/or depression may develop in more than 35% of those impacted by the events. 42, 43 Although close proximity to an event and personal loss appear to be directly correlated with PTSD and depression, respectively, those indirectly involved also experience substantial",
