            "text": "h~ recent years the fixed-cell ELISA system has been applied widely to virological and immunological investigations. This method is frequently used to demonstrate surface antigens unless endogenous peroxidases of the cells under study prevents it~ application (Epstein and Lunney, 1985; Nibbering et al., 1990) . Therefore, we developed a more convenient immunoperoxidase technique to study the expression of virus-induced antigens on the plasma membrane of TGEV-infected cells. It is clear that the presence of M and S antigens (Fig. 1 ) can be demonstrated on the plasma membrane of TGEVinfected cells, fixed with 0. 1% PFA; while the presence of N antigen can not (data not shown). In contrast, the N (Fig. l ) , M and S (data not shown) antigens could be easily detected by IPT in the cytoplasm of TGEV-infected cells which were fixed with 80% acetone. However, the results depend on the number of cells being infected. ]In other words, for the comparative study, the synchronization of cells plays an important role in estimation of the results. It is clear that the antigen quantity detected depends upon number of the cells infected rather than upon the antigen quantity expressed by a single cell. The curve over a period of time appeared in hyperbolic form with the peak at 14 h post-infection (Fig. 2) . Under standardized conditions of cell number, m.o.i., and incubation time, the results obtained are easily reproducible.",

            "text": "For S antigen, its presence on the surface of TGEV-infected cells has been demonstrated by immunofluorescence in the previously published reports Welch and Saif, 1988 ) while the presence of the M antigen on the plasma membrane has only been suspected by four unspecified mAbs (Welch and Sail, 1988) . What is interesting in our study is that not only S but also M antigens could be found, by an IPT, present on the surface of TGEV-infected cells. 1his result confirmed the recent findings of Laviada et al. (1990) on the presc;nce of S and M proteins of TGEV on the surface of infected cells by isotope labelling. The MAb directed against TGEV M antigen (25-22) used in our study was postulated to play a key role in alpha interferon induction in a previous report (Charley and Laude, !988) . These authors suggested that interferon induction by TGEV ~esulted from interaction between the peripheral blood mononuclear cell membrane and an outer membrane domain of the M protein by the fact that anti-M mAbs 25-22 and 49-22 could block alpha interferon induction by infectious or inactivated virions. However, the presence of TGEV M antigen on the surface of infected cells was in contrast to the location of the M protein of MHV, a well studied coronavirus. The MHV M protein migrates to the Golgi apparatus, but is not transported to the plasma membrane as readily as is the S protein (Sturman and Holmes, 1983) . Transmission electron micrographs presented in a previous report (Holmes et al., 1981 ) on MHV maturation showed virions in the lumen of the rough endoplasmic reticulum, in smooth walled vesicles and adsorbed in large number to the plasma membrane by the tips of the peplomers in the 17 Cl I cells 24 h after infection. The question still remains whether the TGEV M protein is virion-associated M or this antigen itself is inserted into the plasma membrane. Our results (Fig. 2 ) suggested that the TGEV M protein would insert into the plasma membrane as we could detected this antigen at 4 h after infection, long before infectious virus was released from infected cells by plaque assay (data not shown). Moreover, the possible insertion of M protein into the plasma membrane could be explained by its predicted amino acid sequence. According to this, although the TGEV M glycoprotein is mainly buried in the viral lipid membrane (Laude et al., 1987) but is might protrude through the lipid membrane with a short (around 30 residues) amino-terminal domain (Charley and Laude, 1988) . For TGEV, the insertion of M protein into the plasma membrane is more likely as its amino terminus extends 54 amino acids from the virion envelope which compares with only 28 for bovine coronavirus (BCV), 26 for MHV, and 21 for avian infectious bronchitis coronavirus (IBV) (Kapke eta!, ! 988 ) . Eleven of 16 amino-terminal amino acids are hydrophobic and the positions of charged amino acids around this sequence suggest that the first sixteen amino acids comprise a potentially cleavable signal peptide for membrane insertion. A similar sequence is not found in the M protein ofBCV, MHV, or IBV. This finding suggested that TGEV M protein may behave differently from its BCV, MHV or iBV counte~arts with regard to intracel!u!ar trafficking (Kapke et al., 1988) . Studies on morphogenesis and M protein migration of TGEV should be done to clarify this in vitro phenomenon. Beside this, researches on in vivo expression of TGEV-induced antigens in intestinal cells should be carried out to understand their role in immune response of swine against TGEV infection.",
