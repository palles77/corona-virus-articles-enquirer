Previous studies with H. parasuis have revealed virulence disparity among isolates and inconsistent heterologous protection. In this study, virulence, direct transmission, and heterologous protection of 4 isolates of H. parasuis (SW114, 12939, MN-H, and 29755) were evaluated using a highly susceptible pig model. In an initial experiment, isolates 12939, MN-H, and 29755 caused Gl\u00e4sser's disease, while strain SW114 failed to cause any clinical signs of disease. One pig from each group challenged with MN-H or 29755 failed to develop clinical disease but was able to transmit H. parasuis to noninfected pigs, which subsequently developed Gl\u00e4sser's disease. Pigs colonized with SW114, 29755, or MN-H that were free of clinical disease were protected from a subsequent challenge with isolate 12939. In a following experiment, pigs vaccinated with strain SW114 given as either a bacterin intramuscularly or a live intranasal vaccine were protected from subsequent challenge with isolate 12939; however, some pigs given live SW114 developed arthritis. Overall these studies demonstrated that pigs infected with virulent isolates of H. parasuis can remain healthy and serve as reservoirs for transmission to naive pigs and that heterologous protection among H. parasuis isolates is possible. In addition, further attenuation of strain SW114 is necessary if it is to be used as a live vaccine.",

            "text": "H aemophilus parasuis is a Gram-negative, NAD-dependent bacterium of the family Pasteurellaceae that causes Gl\u00e4sser's disease in swine, which is characterized by systemic invasion and bacteremia, resulting in a syndrome characterized by polyserositis (peritonitis, pleuritis, pericarditis), meningitis, and arthritis. Clinical signs of disease include fever, depression, anorexia, swollen joints with lameness, dyspnea, and central nervous system signs. Development of disease is sporadic but can be devastating when it occurs (1) . H. parasuis can also cause pneumonia in swine without signs of systemic disease (2) (3) (4) . Disease patterns suggest that maternal antibody may provide early protection, allowing piglets to be colonized without resulting disease while developing an active immune response (5) . This is supported by experimental studies demonstrating that exposure of neonatal piglets to the predominant virulent strain on the farm can be used as a method of prophylaxis (6) . Also, it is difficult to experimentally reproduce systemic disease in conventionally reared pigs, and colostrumdeprived pigs are often used as an experimental model (7, 8) . Various practices, such as early weaning, may result in intermittent colonization of piglets, resulting in exposure to the bacterium when pigs are mixed in the nursery or later after maternal antibody levels have waned. Elevated health status may result in the lack of specific maternal antibody to a diverse number of strains, leaving piglets vulnerable, while coinfection with other bacteria and viruses may also increase the susceptibility to infection and disease.",

            "text": "Fifteen serovars of H. parasuis have been identified, but many isolates are nontypeable (9) . Serovars 4 and 5 are isolated most frequently in conjunction with clinical disease in the United States (10) . Experimental evidence indicates that H. parasuis may colonize the nasal cavity and trachea initially, resulting in loss of cilia and damage to the ciliated epithelium even though the organism does not appear to be closely associated with these cells (11, 12) . Damage to the mucosal epithelial cells may facilitate invasion (11, 12) . H. parasuis has also been shown to invade epithelial and endothelial cells in vitro (13) (14) (15) . After initial colonization, there is bacterial invasion resulting in bacteremia and systemic spread of H. parasuis. Virulence has been associated with serum and phagocytosis resistance and the ability to invade endothelial cells (14, 16, 17) . Specific virulence factors are largely unknown, but capsule and certain variants of trimeric autotransporters (VtaA) have been found to be associated with pathogenic strains and phagocytosis resistance, and the outer membrane protein P2 has been associated with serum resistance (17) (18) (19) (20) . It is not unusual for a number of different strains to be found in a herd or even in the same animal, and it is believed that nonpathogenic strains commonly colonize the nasal cavities of swine (21) (22) (23) . Reports have been mixed as to the degree of heterologous protection among strains (24) . This may be due to relatedness of the strains, exposure to live bacteria on a mucosal surface versus bacterins given parenterally, and prior colonization status of the animal.",

We also demonstrated direct transmis-sion of the virulent isolates from clinically healthy animals to naive pigs, resulting in systemic disease. In a second experiment, heterologous protection was demonstrated using the SW114 isolate as either a bacterin or live vaccine. However, arthritis occurred in some of the pigs vaccinated with the live SW114, indicating that further attenuation of this strain would be necessary if it was to be used as a live vaccine.",

The original pigs from this facility were derived by caesarian-derived, colostrum-deprived (CDCD) methodology and maintained in a HEPA-filtered barrier with irradiated pig feed and filtered, chlorinated, UV-treated water. All pigs derived from this population were raised in this facility by normal production methods. Sentinel pigs were euthanized monthly, and full diagnostic workups were conducted to ensure freedom of swine pathogens. In addition, if there were any unexpected clinical signs or mortality, these pigs were also euthanized and given a full diagnostic workup. Diagnostic monitoring included gross pathology, histopathology, serology, virus isolation, fecal float, electron microscopy, bacterial culture, select immunofluorescence testing and immunohistochemistry procedures, and select molecular diagnostic testing, including PCR. Many of the agents were screened by multiple procedures. Pathogens that the herd of origin was determined to be free of by diagnostic testing were as follows: Actinobacillus spp., Giardia spp., pseudora- Original pigs were derived from Large White \u03eb Landrace females and boars that were F2s from Large White \u03eb Landrace females and synthetic sire lines (PIC L24 and L26). Mating programs were designed to minimize inbreeding. Sows were bred by fresh artificial insemination, gestated in individual pens, and farrowed in traditional farrowing crates. At 24-to 28-day weaning, all pigs were moved to growth pens. Appropriate feed for pig ages was given. No antibiotics (feed, water, or injection) or vaccines were ever used in the 10-year period from facility derivation until the start of this study. The animals were moved from the source herd to the National Animal Disease Center, where they were housed in biosafety level 2 (BSL-2) animal isolation facilities and cared for in compliance within the guidelines of the National Animal Disease Center Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Nasal swabs were taken from each pig the day that both animal experiments began and were negative for H. parasuis by culture. Experiment 1 design. Twenty-five pigs from 4 litters were distributed into 5 groups of 5 pigs such that each group contained 1 pig each from 3 of the litters (one each that was 36, 53, or 68 days old) and 2 pigs each from the fourth litter (48 days old). One group each was challenged intranasally with 1 of the 4 isolates of H. parasuis (29755, 12939, MN-H, and SW114) or sham inoculated with PBS. Cultured dilutions indicated that the inocula contained 10 8.31 CFU/ml (SW114), 10 8.68 CFU/ml (12939), 10 8.32 CFU/ml (29755), or 10 7.23 CFU/ml (MN-H). One week after challenge, nasal swabs were taken from all surviving pigs and one sham-inoculated pig was cohoused with each of the healthy survivors of the 29755 and MN-H groups. Three weeks after challenge, nasal swabs were taken from all surviving pigs and they were rechallenged intranasally with 10 8.83 CFU of H. parasuis isolate 12939. During the course of the experiment, pigs were examined for clinical signs approximately every 4 h, except for an 8-h overnight period, and any pig showing signs of Gl\u00e4sser's disease, such as joint swelling and lameness, incoordination, tremors, severe depression, or reluctance to move was immediately euthanized. Remaining pigs were euthanized 10 days after secondary challenge. At the time of euthanasia, swabs of nasal cavity, lung, joint, abdominal cavity, thoracic cavity, and meninges were collected and agitated in 1 ml of PBS, and 100 l of this was cultured on Casman's plates. Experiment 2 design. Eighteen pigs from 8 different litters that were 5 to 6 weeks old were randomly divided into 4 groups. Group 1 consisted of 4 pigs that were intramuscularly (i.m.) vaccinated with a bacterin made from H. parasuis strain SW114. One milliliter of the adjuvanted bacterin was given twice, once on day 0 and again 3 weeks later. Group 2 consisted of 8 pigs that were given intranasal live SW114 as a vaccine on day 0 of the experiment. Groups 3 (n \u03ed 4) and 4 (n \u03ed 2) consisted of nonvaccinated pigs. On day 85 of the experiment, pigs in groups 1 to 3 were challenged intranasally with 10 8.48 CFU of H. parasuis isolate 12939. Nasal swabs were taken on days 0, 7, 14, 21, and 35 of the experiment, and blood was collected for sera on days 0 and 85. After challenge with H. parasuis isolate 12939, pigs were examined for clinical signs approximately every 4 h, except for an 8-h overnight period, and any pigs showing signs of Gl\u00e4sser's disease were euthanized immediately; surviving pigs were euthanized 10 days after challenge. At the time of euthanasia, swabs were collected and cultured as described for experiment 1.",

One of the goals of this study was to directly compare the virulences of a set of H. parasuis isolates so as to identify strains with divergent virulences for future genome sequence comparisons. Based on previous experimental work and/or diagnostic information, it was expected that isolates 29755, 12939, and MN-H would be pathogenic with various virulences and strain SW114 would be nonpathogenic (7) (8) (9) . Results from experiment 1 indicate that 3 of the 4 isolates are capable of causing systemic disease. Disease developed most rapidly in the pigs challenged with isolate 12939, and H. parasuis was isolated from numerous systemic sites. Disease signs developed slightly later in the groups challenged with 29755 and MN-H, and one pig remained healthy in both groups. H. parasuis was more broadly distributed in pigs challenged with 29755 than in those challenged with MN-H. Interestingly, the survivors from both the 29755 and the MN-H groups were from the same litter, which were the youngest pigs to be challenged. While this may be a coincidence, it is possible that there was an age or genetic effect on systemic disease progression.",

In the second experiment, however, H. parasuis with genetic evidence confirming that it was strain SW114 was isolated from arthritic joints. These pigs recovered quickly and without complications after treatment with ceftiofur, but it is unknown whether disease would have progressed had treatment not been initiated. This strain was believed to be nonpathogenic based on previous reports where it was given either intranasally or intraperitoneally to specific-pathogen-free pigs with no resulting clinical signs of disease and no gross lesions seen at necropsy (9, 26, 27) . It is a strain that was originally isolated from the nasal cavity of a healthy pig (28) . Strain SW114, along with all type strains for serovars 1 to 7, was virulent when given intraperitoneally to guinea pigs. However, when SW114 was given by the intratracheal route to guinea pigs, only transient clinical signs and minimal evidence for infection were present at necropsy, in contrast to results for some of the other type strains that are considered more virulent and caused disease by this route (29) . Thus, although this strain appears to be less virulent than the others, it retains the ability to cause systemic disease under certain conditions that have yet to be fully identified.",

Furthermore, there is evidence that the virulence of the vaccine strain may make a difference in the degree of protection seen with bacterins (34) .

Given prior reports, we expected the live vaccine to be superior to the bacterin in inducing heterologous protection. Live bacterial vaccines have been shown in many cases to be more effective at eliciting broad immune responses involving both antibody-and cell-mediated immunity. Also, live vaccines are often superior at stimulating mucosal immunity, which may be crucial for controlling H. parasuis colonization and disease. The variability in results of previous studies examining cross-protection with bacterins may be explained by examining the relatedness of the isolates used in the studies and/or the prior colonization/immune status of the piglets used. For instance, in young pigs maternally derived immunity often interferes with the development of an active immune response to a vaccine, especially with bacterins that largely induce a systemic antibody response. Since we used naive pigs, no such interference would have occurred. Thus, whether both vaccines would be equally efficacious in the face of maternal immunity still needs to be investigated. Unfortunately, the fact that SW114 demonstrated some virulence makes it a less attractive candidate as a live vaccine. However, further rational attenuation may make it a more suitable candidate, or identification of other nonpathogenic strains may be undertaken. We are currently carrying out further sequence and virulence comparisons of these strains and other H. parasuis isolates that may identify virulence factors and possible attenuation targets.",

Thus, we used sera from the pigs in our experiment to evaluate vaccine-induced antibodies in an antibody-mediated, complement killing assay, which revealed some interesting results. First, there was little difference between strain SW114 and 12939 in sensitivity to killing with nonimmune sera obtained from CDCD pigs. This is somewhat contradictory to a previous report indicating that nasal isolates, considered to be of low virulence, were more sensitive to serum killing (16) . SW114 and 12939 were not tested in the previous report. Although all the nasal isolates tested were sensitive to complement killing in the previous report, there was a range of susceptibility seen with these isolates, and the fact that we observed that SW114 has some pathogenic capability may explanation this inconsistency. Also, the sources of sera used were different in our study and the previous one. In our study we used swine sera from a CDCD pig as the complement source and heat-inactivated sera from the experimental animals as an antibody source, while in the previous study sera from conventional animals was used; thus, the levels of specific and nonspecific antibodies may have been different for the sera used in the two studies. Differences in culture conditions, which may alter characteristics such as capsule production, could account for discrepancies as well.",

Again this may be due to the individual strains and experimental specificities of the different experiments. In the previous report antibodies raised to a highly virulent strain, Nagasaki, did not appear to enhance serum sensitivity to the homologous strain or 2 heterologous strains (nasal and systemic isolates). Certain highly virulent strains, like Nagasaki, may be resistant to killing whether homologous antibodies are present or not, potentially due to inherent traits such as capsule type or production. The nature of the antibody response induced by the Nagasaki strain may be different and in part the reason for its high virulence potential. Cross-reactivity of induced antibodies may be specific to the particular strains used in each study as well, and this may explain the lack of antibody-enhanced killing in the previous study. In general, postvaccination sera in our study were not as effective at killing strain 12939, possibly due to the heterologous specificities of the antibodies. There was a slight increase in sensitivity of both strains SW114 and 12939 to sera from nonvaccinated pigs taken on day 85 of the experiment compared to sera from day 0. A possible explanation for this phenomenon is exposure to commensal bacterial flora over time, which may have induced some nonspecific, cross-reacting antibody. The outer membrane protein P2 has been implicated in conferring serum resistance to H. parasuis, and mutants lacking P2 have been shown to induce complement activation through the classical pathway by the binding of IgG to other outer membrane proteins (20, 35) .",

Sera from pigs not treated with the antibiotic were more effective at mediating killing of 12939 than were sera from ceftiofur-treated pigs. It is important to note that treatment with ceftiofur was not effective in clearing H. parasuis from the nasal cavity. Systemic invasion by H. parasuis in the antibiotic-treated pigs failed to induce an enhanced systemic antibody response sufficient to achieve an increase in complement-mediated, antibody-dependent killing. The ELISA detects serum IgG specific for the OppA protein, and development of OppA-specific antibody appears to occur selectively in survivors of systemic disease but not in healthy, colonized pigs (S. Oliveira, personal communication). However, only 3 of 4 pigs given bacterin developed an OppA-specific serum antibody response, and none of the pigs given live SW114 as a vaccine developed an OppA-specific serum antibody response, regardless of ceftiofur treatment. It is possible that the live SW114vaccinated, non-ceftiofur-treated pigs had a clinically inapparent systemic infection and/or established infection lower in the respiratory tract that did not result in obvious clinical disease but did result in the development of an antibody response that significantly aided in the ability to kill 12939. These data provide evidence that intranasal delivery of a live strain of H. parasuis induces a broader antibody response; however, rational attenuation is likely necessary to prevent vaccine-induced disease.",

Previous challenge studies that we have undertaken in conventional pigs with some of the same H. parasuis strains used in this study have provided results not entirely consistent with those reported here. While we have been able to sporadically reproduce systemic disease with some of these strains in conventional pigs, more often only the pigs' respiratory tracts become colonized and, at most, mild pneumonia results (our unpublished data). The results obtained with the pigs used in this study also support the concept that Gl\u00e4sser's disease can occur in the absence of coinfections with common pig viruses such as porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus and porcine circovirus.
