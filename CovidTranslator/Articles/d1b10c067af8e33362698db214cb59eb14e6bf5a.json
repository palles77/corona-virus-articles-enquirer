The DNA vaccine contained a plasmid encoding the SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) S protein under the control of the human CMV promoter and intron A. The whole killed virus vaccine was comprised of SARS-CoV, propagated in Vero-E6 cells, with subsequent \u2424-propilactone inactivation and formulated with aluminum hydroxide adjuvant. Mice immunized twice with the DNA vaccine and once with the whole killed virus elicited higher antibody responses than mice immunized three times with the DNA vaccine or once with the whole killed virus vaccine. Mice immunized twice with the whole killed virus vaccine elicited higher antibody responses than mice immunized three times with the DNA vaccine or once with the whole killed virus vaccine. However, a combination of the vaccines induced T-helper type 1 (Th1) immune responses while the whole killed virus vaccine induced T helper type 2 (Th2) immune response. These results demonstrate that combination of the DNA vaccine and the whole killed virus vaccine can be used to enhance the magnitude and change the bias of the immune responses to SARS-CoV.",

We found more INF-\u2425 than IL-4 producing cells in splenocytes of the immunized mice. This result suggests that both vaccine regiments generated Th1-type immune response, since INF-\u2425 is secreted by Th1-type CD4+ and CD8+ cells.

Therefore, vigilance must be maintained and appropriate control measures must be available for implementation in the event that it reoccurs. Previous experience in controlling viral diseases suggests that a vaccine may be one of the most effective measures to prevent SARS. Recent studies identified the S protein as the only one which induced significant SARS-CoV neutralization [7] . The SARS-CoV S gene has been expressed in different vector systems [8, 10, 11] with an ultimate goal to develop a SARS-CoV vaccine. In two reports [9, 12] plasmid DNA expressing SARS-CoV S gene fragments was used to develop a DNA vaccine. These authors demonstrated neutralizing antibodies production [12] and protective anti-SARS-CoV immunity [9] in mice. In another study, Tang and colleagues [13] developed an inactivated SARS-CoV vaccine prepared from the whole virus, and demonstrated high level of neutralizing antibodies in mice after immunization with the vaccine.",

The sequence of the S protein suggests that it contains an N-terminal signal sequence and C-terminal hydrophobic membrane-anchoring domain. We used full-length S protein because it had been shown that the S protein, anchored on the cell surface, generated a better immune response than secreted versions of the protein [9] .

Taking into consideration the clinical evidence that the incubation period of SARS is short (5 days to 2 weeks) and that most patients appear to recover within a short time with no persistent or latent infection, it is reasonable to conclude that neutralizing antibody may play an important role in preventing SARS-CoV infection. It has also been shown in laboratory animals that neutralizing antibodies play the most important role in prevention of the viral replication [9, 22] , and protection can also be achieved by the administration of S-specific monoclonal antibodies [23] . However, the contribution of T-cell immunity cannot be excluded. It was reported that an apparent depletion of T cells occurred in the early SARS-CoV infection of patients, and a gradual increase to normal level was observed as the patients recovered [24] . Moreover, T-cell epitopes in the SARS-CoV S protein elicited specific T-cell immune responses in patients recovered from SARS [25] . Therefore, generation of both humoral and cellular immune responses would be beneficial for vaccine against SARS.",
