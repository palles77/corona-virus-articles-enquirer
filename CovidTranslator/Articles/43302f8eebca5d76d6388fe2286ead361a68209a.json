These pressure changes occur as a result of repeated herniations of the abdominal esophagus and cardiac portion of the stomach into the esophagus. During retching, food freely moves back and forth in the esophagus, which is now dilated because of the ingesta. Ultimately, the diaphragm rapidly moves cranially, resulting in positive intrathoracic pressure that leads to expulsion of these contents. 12 Vomiting is such an active process that it seems to involve the whole cat, and so it is little wonder that it concerns owners so much.",

The author has found that some cats with dental disease can gorge their food, resulting in vomiting; so, paying attention to the state of the teeth and gums is important. Of course, some cats have multiple problems, and correction of dental disease may not resolve vomiting if there is another process. In the examination, it is also important to note consequences of both the underlying process and the vomiting itself; these include the demeanor of the cat, hydration status, and abdominal pain. The physical examination findings, together with the clinical history, help determine the next appropriate steps. Well cats that are not continually vomiting and are appropriately hydrated, with no other specific signs, may be treated as outpatients by fasting them for 24 hours, then returning to food with a bland diet, such as plain cooked chicken or commercial, low-residue prescription diets designed for this purpose. Follow-up is important to ensure signs do not progress. Cats with nonspecific signs may require supportive care with subcutaneous or intravenous fluids and perhaps analgesia (with opioids). If clinical signs do not resolve, the pursuit of a specific diagnosis should be attempted. The practitioner must ask the following important questions:",

At low doses metoclopramide inhibits dopaminergic (D 2 ) transmission, and at higher doses it inhibits serotonergic 5-HT 3 receptors in the chemoreceptor trigger zone (CRTZ). 15, 23 Metoclopramide also acts peripherally as a prokinetic at the level of the gastrointestinal smooth muscle of the stomach and duodenum, triggering gastric emptying and duodenal contractions. Multiple mechanisms mediate metoclopramide's prokinetic activity, including augmentation of acetylcholine release and increased smooth muscle sensitivity to cholinergic neurotransmission, which may in part be because of antagonism of dopamine, but more recently, serotonergic 5HT 4 receptor activation has been suggested. 23, 56 Metoclopramide has been reported to increase the lower esophageal sphincter tone in humans, 20 although in cats metoclopramide's affect on the lower esophageal sphincter is reported to be weak. 32 Adverse central nervous system, extrapyramidal signs occur secondary to dopamine (D 2 ) antagonism, including excitement and behavior changes. Extrapyramidal signs are most often seen at the higher doses needed to block 5-HT 3 receptors.

H 2receptor antagonism is reported to result in a 70% to 90% reduction in acid production. 13 Famotidine is more effective at suppressing gastric acid secretion relative to ranitidine. Famotidine is well tolerated, although, with chronic therapy, there is the potential for hypoacidity and gastric bacterial overgrowth. In humans dose reduction is recommended in association with renal dysfunction. 21 Famotidine is not an inhibitor of the hepatic microsomal cytochrome P-450 enzyme system, therefore significant drug interactions are not anticipated. activity. 40, 54 Significant drug interactions associated with hepatic microsomal cytochrome P-450 enzyme system inhibition are not a clinical concern with ranitidine. 46 An adverse effect to be aware of in cats treated with ranitidine is transient hypotension associated with ranitidine administered as an IV bolus. 19 In humans dose reduction is recommended in patients with renal azotemia. 39 Ranitidine is effective in decreasing gastric acid in cats. 22 Ranitidine would be a logical choice in a cat with gastrointestinal ulceration and/or atony. The reported dosage recommendation for ranitidine in cats is 3.5 mg/ kg orally every 12 hours or 2.5 mg/kg intravenous every 12 hours. 19 Omeprazole Omeprazole is a proton pump inhibitor that targets the H + /K + ATPase pump on the luminal surface of partial cells. Omeprazole is effective at suppressing parietal cell acid secretion, and its effects persist for \u224824 hours after drug withdrawal because of drug accumulation in the parietal cell (by ion trapping). Indications for omeprazole therapy are for the treatment and prevention of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug (NSAID)-induced ulcers. 9 Omeprazole is enteric coated to prevent its degradation by gastric acid; therefore oral formulations should not be crushed. Based on human studies, omeprazole is a hepatic microsomal cytochrome P-450 enzyme inhibitor with known drug interactions with diazepam. 2 The extent of clinically significant drug interactions in cats has yet to be studied.",

The microorganisms commonly used are nonpathogenic bacteria and yeast that have a vital role in gastrointestinal health, including Lactobacillus spp., Enterococcus faecium, Bifidobacterium spp., and Saccharomyces spp. For example, lactobacilli synthesize B vitamins, digestive enzymes, and folate coenzymes. 63 Clinical indications for the use of probiotics are diverse, including primary gastrointestinal disease, chronic renal disease, and pancreatitis. 71 The rational use of probiotics in the treatment of gastrointestinal diseases include their ability to modulate gastrointestinal flora, minimize colonization by pathogenic bacteria, and decrease the likelihood of bacterial translocation. 17 In healthy cats, Lactobacillus acidophilus is reported to reduce fecal Clostridium counts. 45 When Lactobacillus acidophilus was used adjunctively with antimicrobial therapy, fecal shedding of Campylobacter was reduced in cats with Campylobacter-induced diarrhea relative to cats treated with antimicrobials alone. 3 Specifically, in cats with gastrointestinal disease, available research supports the probiotic Enterococcus faecium as clinically beneficial in resolving diarrhea in kittens. 16 Relative to the control group, the kittens treated with probiotics had increased fecal Bifidobacteria and blood IgA concentrations and decreased fecal counts of Clostridium perfringens.",

Also dexamethasone maybe preferred in patients with a history of heart failure, fluid retention, or hypertension because of its lack of mineralocorticoid activity relative to prednisone/prednisolone. Dexamethasone's potency is 4 to 10 times that of prednisolone; therefore a dose reduction is necessary when prescribing dexamethasone (the dexamethasone dose is one seventh that of prednisolone). 4, 10 Budesonide is an oral, locally active, highpotency glucocorticoid that is formulated to be released in the distal gastrointestinal tract (based on the pH differential between the proximal and distal small intestine), where it is absorbed and is locally immunomodulating at the level of the enterocyte. The amount of systemically absorbed budesonide is minimized, because 80% to 90% of the budesonide absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract undergoes first-pass metabolism in the liver. Some systemic absorption does occur, as evidenced by a blunted adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) stimulation test in dogs treated with budesonide at 3 mg/m 2 for 30 days. 66, 70 The use of budesonide in cats remains anecdotal, with a suggestive empirical dose of 0.5 to 1 mg/cat/day.

The goal of therapy is to achieve clinical remission and slowly taper the dose of glucocorticoids to the lowest dose that will control the cat's clinical signs. 67 Some cats may be completely weaned off therapy, while others require long-term lowdose therapy.

Expectoration may also be confused with vomiting or regurgitation.

Coughing may also occur in cats that have aspirated as a result of regurgitation.

However, a small bolus of food or water is sufficient to ensure immediate passage of the medication into the stomach. 20, 53 The risk of esophageal retention can also be lessened by coating a tablet or capsule with butter or a gel dietary supplement (Nutri-Cal; V\u00e9toquinol, Fort Worth, Tex.). 21 One study determined that tablets or capsules administered using a one-step pill gun with flavored liquid (FlavoRx Pill Glide; FLAVORx, Columbia, Md.) or a pill delivery treat (Greenies Pill Pockets; Nutro Products, Franklin, Tenn.) ensured an average transit time of 60 seconds or less. 6 Delayed esophageal transit of medications allows tablets and capsules to disintegrate within the esophagus, exposing the mucosa to irritating chemicals. Cats may be at risk of delayed esophageal transit, because they do not typically drink water with medication, and they do not have an upright posture. In addition, medications are often given to sick or dehydrated patients Many preanesthetic drugs and induction agents reduce lower esophageal sphincter pressure. 27, 28 Other predisposing factors may be intraabdominal surgery and a head-down position on the surgery table. Reflux fluid with a pH less than 4 is likely to cause esophageal mucosal damage, as is prolonged contact time. Esophageal defense mechanisms include clearance of the reflux fluid by peristalsis and neutralization of the acidic pH by the bicarbonate present in saliva.",

In the early 1980s, the discovery of the association of Helicobacter pylori with gastric disease (gastritis, peptic ulcers, and neoplasia) in humans revolutionized treatment of those diseases. Since then, Helicobacter spp. have been associated with gastric disease in various veterinary species, including cats and dogs. Several Helicobacter spp. (e.g., H. heilmannii, H. bizzozeronii, H. felis) have been identified in cats, some of which have the potential to infect humans, although transmission is thought to be rare. 19, 48 The prevalence of Helicobacter infection in cats varies geographically and may be very high (>40%) in some locations. 1, 27, 37, 47, 58 The importance of Helicobacter as a cause of gastric disease is cats is unclear; the bacteria may be found in the stomach of both clinically normal cats and cats with gastritis.

More recently, commercial diets have been formulated for control of trichobezoars.

Ollulanus tricuspis is a worm that infects the stomach of cats, causing chronic gastritis, and it is difficult to diagnose (see below, Gastrointestinal Parasites). The worm is occasionally found on histologic examination of gastric biopsy samples. 9 It is reasonable to treat empirically (fenbendazole 10 mg/kg, once daily, PO \u00d7 2 days) for this parasite when the cause of gastritis is not apparent. 49 The frequency of vomiting in cats with chronic gastritis is highly variable, ranging from once or twice per week (and not necessarily every week) to more than once daily. Most patients are otherwise well, although other clinical signs (inappetence, anorexia, depression, or weight loss) are possible depending on disease severity. Results of routine laboratory testing are typically normal but may show neutrophilic leukocytosis, result when there is an abnormality of the immunoregulatory system. 21 The most commonly used methods for diagnosis of Helicobacter infection in cats are based on gastric specimens obtained during endoscopy (or laparotomy): exfoliative cytology, histopathologic examination of biopsy specimens, and rapid urease testing of biopsy specimens. 28 However, it is important to note that even when Helicobacter organisms are identified, the infection may not be the cause of the patient's clinical signs, and other causes of vomiting should always be evaluated.",

In one study, it was also the most sensitive diagnostic method when compared with urease testing and histologic examination. 20 Brush cytology samples gathered during endoscopy are airdried on microscope slides and stained with Wright's stain. The slide is examined at 100\u00d7 magnification under oil immersion. Spiral bacteria are readily seen if present. At least 10 oil-immersion fields on two slides should be examined before determining a specimen is negative for Helicobacter-like organisms. 28 Since Helicobacter produce abundant urease, a rapid urease test (e.g., CLOtest, Ballard Medical Products, Draper, Utah) may be used for diagnosis. 38 The kit consists of an agar gel impregnated with urea and a pH indicator. A gastric biopsy sample is applied to the gel, and if urease is present, ammonia will form and change the pH (and thus the color) of the gel. The gel may change color rapidly (within 30 minutes), but 24 hours must elapse before the test can be considered negative. 28 The more rapidly the color changes, the higher the bacterial load. Both false-positive and false-negative results are possible with rapid urease testing for various reasons, giving the test a sensitivity of 70% to 90%. 28, 37 Histopathologic examination of gastric biopsy samples using hemotoxylin and eosin (H&E) or silver stains is highly sensitive and specific in human studies for detection of Helicobacter-like organisms. The organisms are not equally distributed; so, examination of biopsy specimens from multiple sites will increase sensitivity. The bacteria may be seen in mucus on the surface epithelium as well as in the gastric pits, glandular lumen, and parietal cells. Organisms may also be seen submucosally within gastric lymphoid follicles. 46 Histopathologic examination of biopsy samples also allows for assessment of other abnormalities. Mild to severe lymphocytic-plasmacytic or lymphocytic gastritis may be present.",

Since Helicobacter infection is common in cats, yet no clear pathogenic role has been established, it is difficult cases. 29 Depending on the underlying cause and severity of disease, abdominal pain, anorexia, lethargy, pale mucous membranes, and drooling may also be seen. Cats with neoplastic disease may have prolonged clinical signs and are more likely to present with anorexia and weight loss. 29 Cats with perforated ulcers may or may not present with signs of shock. Diagnosis may be problematic because the clinical signs and physical examination findings are often not specific, even in cats with perforated ulcerations. 8 The causes of gastric ulceration in cats are not well characterized. In dogs the most common cause is the administration of ulcerogenic drugs, particularly NSAIDs, either alone or in combination with corticosteroids. Several cases of NSAID-induced gastroduodenal ulceration or perforation have been reported in cats. 8, 34, 45 Additional cases may be reported in the future, because long-term administration of these drugs is gaining in popularity for treatment of chronic diseases such as osteoarthritis. NSAIDs cause direct mucosal damage and interfere with prostaglandin synthesis. Although inhibition of the COX-1 enzyme is thought to be the cause of adverse effects, such as gastric ulceration, even COX-2-selective drugs have been associated with adverse effects, and safety in sick cats is not well evaluated. Recently, guidelines for the long-term use of NSAIDs in cats were published by the International Society of Feline Medicine and the American Association of Feline Practitioners. 51 The recommendations include administering NSAIDs either with or shortly after food, withholding therapy if inappetence or anorexia develops, determining dose based on lean body weight, and titrating to the lowest effective dose.",

Various disorders are associated with impaired gastric motility, such as chronic gastritis, drug therapy (e.g., anticholinergic and narcotic drugs), dysautonomia, gastric neoplasia, metabolic disorders (e.g., hypokalemia), and temporary postsurgical gastroparesis. In some cases of chronic motility dysfunction, no cause can be identified. Outflow obstruction may be caused by neoplasia, foreign bodies, and extragastric masses. Pyloric stenosis is infrequently documented in young cats, often Siamese cats. 4, 40, 55 Since the range of underlying disorders is diverse, the diagnostic approach should allow for detection of both gastric and nongastric disorders.

Problems with interpretation of endoscopic biopsy samples include detection of necrosis, inflammation, and ulceration rather than the primary lesion. In dogs some neoplastic lesions are submucosal, making it very difficult to obtain diagnostic samples by endoscopy.

The small spheres are intended to mimic liquid transit time and the large spheres solid transit time. However, studies assessing the clinical relevance of this method are lacking. One review concluded that BIPS are probably sufficiently sensitive to detect grossly delayed gastric emptying. 60 Treatment of gastric emptying disorders is directed at identifiable causes. Treatment for gastric ulcers, chronic gastritis, and foreign bodies is described elsewhere in this chapter. Pyloric stenosis is managed surgically. If no outflow obstruction exists, treatment with prokinetic agents, such as metoclopramide or cisapride, may be beneficial (see Table 23 -3).",

The local immune system of the intestinal mucosa no doubt plays an important role, but recent work has also shown the importance of the normal bacterial population in perpetuating and, perhaps, even initiating pathology. It is known for certain that IBDs are an expression of an overanxious immune response, with a recent study 104 indicating increases in inflammatory (IL-6), type-1 immunity (IL-12 p40), and immunomodulatory (transforming growth factor [TGF]-beta, IL-10) cytokines. Other researchers have found an association with bacterial counts (Enterobacteriaceae, E. coli, and Clostridium spp.) and abnormalities in mucosal architecture, indicating that mucosal bacteria are involved in the etiopathogenesis. 65 We can summarize these theories by saying that IBDs are likely to be a consequence of hypersensitivity reactions to antigens from the intestinal lumen (e.g., bacterial, parasitic, or dietary antigens). This hypersensitivity may occur because of failed immunoregulation (suppressive function) of the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT). It is known that granulomatous colitis in Boxer dogs is associated with infection, 143 and pathogens may well be found in at least some cases of IBD in cats that cause the immune response and subsequent inflammatory infiltrate of the lamina propria typically seen.

Weight loss without vomiting or diarrhea deserves special mention because not only have several studies 38, 58 shown this to be the most common presenting sign for IBD, but many veterinarians do not consider primary intestinal disease without the presence of vomiting or diarrhea. Weight loss despite normal to increased caloric intake can represent poor absorption of food because of small intestinal disease, although it can also represent maldigestion associated with exocrine pancreatic insufficiency or increased metabolism associated with hyperthyroidism, or even lack of energy utilization associated with diabetes mellitus.

Moderate liver enzyme elevations may be seen 5,38,58,66 even in the absence of recognizable hepatic pathology, and this may reflect subclinical secondary hepatic disease, secondary cholestasis, or showering of the liver with inflammatory cells from the small intestine through the portal circulation. 66 Other changes can reflect consequences of the intestinal disease, such as azotemia or hemoconcentration reflecting dehydration, 58 or hypokalemia reflecting inappetance. 38 The chronic inflammation may be reflected by neutrophilia, monocytosis, 5, 38, 58, 66 or hyperglobulinaemia. 38 Hypocobalaminemia can reflect ileal inflammation, and low serum folate can reflect proximal small intestinal inflammation. 149 Typical ultrasonographic findings consistent with IBD are focal or diffuse intestinal wall thickening ( Figure 23-19) ; normal wall thickness is less than or equal to 2.8 mm for the duodenum and less than or equal to 3.2 mm for the ileum, 50 and large mesenteric lymph nodes with hypoechoic changes may be seen. One study found that ultrasonographic findings correlated with histologic grade of IBD. 5 There is no clear distinction between ultrasonographic changes from IBD and those from small cell lymphoma. One recent therapeutic trial, follow-up visits are vitally important. Many cats with small intestinal disease may show initial improvement simply because of the diet having lower residue, since there is decreased substrate for intestinal bacteria to digest and lower osmotic potential. The corollary of this is that failure of one novel protein diet does not mean that all novel protein diets will fail.",

Not only is lymphocytic IBD hard to distinguish histologically from lymphocytic lymphosarcoma, but the approaches and treatments are similar. Several reports have suggested a relationship between the two conditions in that inflammatory infiltrates may become neoplastic over time. 27, 43, 90 Prevalence The true prevalence of intestinal small cell lymphoma is unknown, but several recent studies have indicated similar rates to inflammatory bowel diseases, with Kleinschmidt et al noting 10 small cell lymphoma cats compared with 14 with intestinal lymphocytic infiltrates, 74 Evans et al reporting 10 cases compared with 12 with IBDs 40 , and Baral et al diagnosing 8 cases compared with 10 with IBDs. 6 Traditionally, 90% of feline lymphosarcoma is regarded as intermediate or high grade, 163 but this may not be the case within the gastrointestinal tract. Fondacaro et al found 75% of gastrointestinal lymphoma to be lymphocytic 43 ; a more recent paper found Some cats seem resistant to conventional therapy. If this is the case, the diagnostic findings should be re-assessed to ensure no steps were missed or findings disregarded; the cat should be reexamined to look for emergence of other signs; and the pathologist who reads the histology should be contacted to recheck the findings. Some cases of apparently resistant IBD are actually food sensitive, but it can be difficult to find the incriminating diet source, and commercial diets are not always effective. If underlying infectious causes have been entirely ruled out and the practitioner is certain of the diagnosis of idiopathic disease, immune suppressive therapy can be increased by either increasing the dose of prednisolone or using other agents, such as chlorambucil, typically at 2 mg/cat, PO, every second day. It has been suggested that cats with eosinophilic inflammation may be more likely to be refractory to standard therapy. Side effects of immunosuppressive therapy are rare but include inducing diabetes mellitus, immune suppression, delayed healing, and gastrointestinal ulceration.",

Adenocarcinomas accounted for 17%, and other tumor types reported included mast cell tumors and leiomyosarcomas. 135 \"Lymphoma in veterinary medicine: no longer a oneword diagnosis\" was the title of an editorial in a recent issue of the Veterinary Clinical Pathology journal, 95 and this is nowhere truer than in the feline gastrointestinal tract! A recent study classified 50 cases of feline gastrointestinal lymphoma both histologically and immunophenotypically, and it found eight different categories according to the Revised European and American Lymphoma/World Health Organization (REAL/WHO) classification system and six categories according to the approximately equal numbers of high-grade and lowgrade gastrointestinal lymphoma. 84 ",

Further difficulties in precise diagnosis may arise, since non-neoplastic lymphocytic infiltrates (e.g., IBD) are often found in other locations along the intestinal tract. 27, 40, 84 The stomach is also affected in 14% to 40% of small cell lymphoma cases. 40, 43, 84 Although not fully assessed, involvement of the colon appears rare. 84 Local lymph node involvement is common, being noted in up to 59% of cases. 84 This percentage may be even higher, because many studies assessed lymph node cytology from ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspirates, which may miss spread to the lymph node, because the population of neoplastic lymphocytic cells is indistinguishable from the normal population of lymph node cells.

However, this testing is important as part of the diagnostic workup to rule out extra-GI disease, such as hyperthyroidism or diabetes mellitus. Common biochemistry findings are mild to moderate increase of liver enzymes, such as alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and/or alkaline phosphatase (ALP). 27, 40, 43, 84 As with IBDs, these liver enzyme changes may or may not represent overt hepatic disease. 67 Albumin may be reduced 43 but is normal in most cases 27, 43, 84 ; azotemia may be present and may be of prerenal origin or represent concurrent renal disease. In one study, 25 of 32 cats were hypocobalaminemic; 1 of 27 cats had low folate, but 10 of 27 had elevated folate; and 12 of 16 cats had increased fTLI. 73 Hematologically, a mature neutrophilia with or without monocytosis is sometimes present, representing the inflammatory response; lymphopenia may be present as a stress response. Anemia may be present and may occur as a result of chronic slow GI blood loss, and in some cases, ulceration, or it may be because of chronic disease; hemoconcentration is also possible, reflecting dehydration. 27, 40, 43, 84 Palpable or ultrasonographically visible thickened intestines (30% to 41% of cases) 27, 40, 43, 84 or mesenteric lymph nodes (20% to 50% of cases) 27, 40, 43, 84 are no more or less likely to be present in comparison with IBDs. There are no defined ultrasound guidelines for cats with intestinal small cell lymphoma, because most prior papers do not distinguish between small cell and lymphoblastic neoplasia. 54 ,113 A more recent paper found 9 of 15 cats undergoing ultrasound examination had diffuse small intestinal wall thickening, with a mean of 4.3 mm (range, 3.4 to 5.0 mm; median, 4.5 mm), and focal mural thickening of 20 mm was noted in one cat. 84 In many cases, against expectations, intestinal wall layering was preserved. These findings also mean that 5 of 15 cats had ultrasonographically normal intestinal wall thickness (\u22642.8 mm for the duodenum and \u22643.2 mm for the ileum). 50 If affected, jejunal lymph nodes may appear as hypoechoic and enlarged; in the same study, 12 of 15 cats had lymph node changes with a mean diameter of 15.9 mm (range, 6.5 to 30 mm; median, 10 mm) 84 compared with the normal diameter of less than or equal to 5.0 mm. 132 None of these findings can definitively distinguish small cell lymphoma from IBDs; although one recent paper has suggested that ultrasonographic thickening of the muscularis layer is more likely in cats with intestinal small cell lymphoma (Figure 23 -20) than those with IBD, this change was also seen in 12% of cats with a normal small intestine. However, thickening of the muscularis layer together with lymphadenopathy was recognized in 26% of those cats with small cell lymphoma compared with 4% of those with IBD and 2% of cats with no small intestinal pathology. 177 Biopsy samples and histopathology are required for definitive diagnosis. An example of jejunal and mesenteric lymph node appearance at laparotomy is shown in Figure 23 It is difficult to distinguish between lymphocytic inflammation and small cell lymphocytic neoplasia in any location; some histopathologic features that might help in differentiating the ends of the spectrum may include therefore become known as the Fondacaro protocol. This consists of a combination of prednisolone and chlorambucil given orally by the client at home (Table 23-15 ). The rationale is that a slow alkylating agent, such as chlorambucil, is more appropriate to use for the slowly dividing, well-differentiated lymphocytes that cause disease. This can be contrasted to the aggressive chemotherapeutic agents required for the rapidly proliferating cells in lymphoblastic neoplasia that is typically associated with lymphosarcoma.",

The association with inflammation from IBDs was noted for small cell lymphomas, and perhaps there is a spectrum from lymphocytic IBD to small cell lymphoma to high-grade lymphoma. That some cats are more likely to have inflammatory changes become neoplastic is suggested by a paper noting higher lymphoma rates in cats with vaccine-associated sarcomas (a neoplastic condition where the role of chronic inflammation is well noted). 89 Similar protocols are used in humans with both lowgrade (i.e., lymphocytic) lymphosarcoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia. 117,151 Some studies with humans have indicated that continuous therapy with chlorambucil results in prolonged survival, 64 although metaanalyses have not been able to determine optimum dosing and scheduling of administration of chlorambucil or other alkylating agents in these conditions in humans. 20, 72 Although we do not have enough data to critically compare pulsed therapy to continuous dosing, the study assessing continuous dosing appeared to have a lower number of cats completely responding, although those cats that did respond had a longer median survival 73 than those in the studies assessing pulsed chlorambucil dosing. 43, 84 The differences may also relate to the definitions used for complete response. The chlorambucil dose of 2 mg/cat, PO every second day (or third day) is often chosen because of the ready availability of 2 mg coated tablets, the breaking of which can expose the owner to these cytotoxic medications. Chlorambucil can be compounded into smaller doses, thus allowing daily dosing of 1 mg capsules. The author has used this dose to apparent good effect, but there has been no critical assessment.",

When E. coli is associated with clinical signs of gastrointestinal disease, it is mostly as an opportunistic pathogen, with overgrowth resulting from changed environmental conditions, such as inflammation from other pathology or another pathogen. There are also specific strains of E. coli that are true pathogens because of virulence factors not present in commensal E. coli; these include enteropathogenic E. coli and enterotoxigenic E. coli, which both induce a watery diarrhea, and enterohemorrhagic E. coli, which produces a diarrheal syndrome with copious bloody discharge and no fever. 77 PCR testing is commercially available to identify pathogenic strains of E. coli 16,148 ; although not offered at routine veterinary laboratories, this testing is available to veterinarians, and laboratories offering these services can readily be found online. Diagnosis should also document histologic lesions corresponding to the strain of E. coli identified. 77 There is emerging resistance to E. coli worldwide in all species of animals, including humans. This includes the typical therapies for gram-negative bacteria of beta-lactamenhanced penicillins and fluoroquinolones. 167 A major risk factor is prior antibiotic usage, because commensal organisms are exposed to antibiotics. PCR testing does not enable antibiotic sensitivity testing, and fecal culture may not be able to distinguish pathogenic from nonpathogenic strains; so, sensitivities may not be an accurate reflection of the pathogenic organism. PCR testing for genes that impart resistance to E. coli have recently been described but are not yet commercially available. 34 In some circumstances, supportive care with fluid and electrolyte replacement may be all that is required while the cat's immune system combats the infection. Empiric therapy could include beta-lactam-enhanced penicillins (such as amoxicillin-clavulanate at 20 mg/kg, every 12 hours, PO), fluoroquinolones (such as enrofloxacin at 5 mg/kg, once daily, PO), or cefovecin (8 mg/kg, every 2 weeks, SC), but the clinician must be aware of possible drug resistance.",

Diagnosis is based on isolation of the organism by culture or identification with PCR, but care should be taken to correlate pathogen identification with clinical signs since, as with most GI pathogens, the organism can be isolated from healthy animals. 147 As with E. coli, antibiotic resistance is widespread, 120 with one United Kingdom survey finding the multiple drugresistant strain DT104 to be the most frequent bacteriophage type identified. 115 Treatment should be reserved only for those cats showing systemic signs, because routine antibiotic use in treating salmonellosis induces drug-resistant strains and prolongs the convalescent excretion period. 52 Antibiotic choice should be based solely on sensitivity findings, since resistances are so widespread and unpredictable. 98 This means that if the organism has been identified by PCR, then culture of feces must also be undertaken. The duration of treatment must be long enough to eliminate fecal excretion of the organism, prevent the chance of relapse, and reduce the chance of resistance developing; up to 28 days has been advocated. 4, 164 These cautions are particularly important because of the zoonotic potential of salmonellosis.",

Most gas accumulation is a result of swallowed air, which is predominantly nitrogen that cannot be absorbed by the intestinal mucosa. Gas also arises from bacterial fermentation. Fluid accumulates as a result of increased secretions (saliva, bile, and secretions of gastric, pancreatic, and small intestinal origin) and retention of fluid already ingested, and it can be augmented by local hemorrhage. 39 Since most intestinal obstructions in cats do not reach the midjejunum, 60 reabsorption of fluids that normally occurs at the jejunum and ileum is impaired. 39 Linear foreign bodies, such as string, dental floss, or elastic toys, require proximal anchoring, usually under the tongue or in the pylorus (for example, by part of a toy attached to elastic). Peristalsis moves the free end of the \"string\" through the intestinal tract, resulting in pleats of intestines around the foreign body.

This can be subtle when there is only minimal involvement of the intestine but overt when involving the entire small intestine. Commashaped gas patterns are more likely to occur with linear foreign bodies. 1 Contrast radiography can aid diagnosis for both discrete and linear foreign bodies but should be used with caution because intestinal perforation may be present. Nonionic iodinated agents that are typically used for myelography (such as iopamidol or iohexol) should be used, since barium is irritating to the peritoneum and oral iodine compounds are hypertonic. Hypertonic compounds may draw fluid into the stomach and intestines after oral administration, with the potential of creating further fluid and electrolyte imbalances in an already compromised patient. 137 Ultrasonography is a very useful diagnostic tool, particularly for discrete foreign bodies, where, in most cases, there is overt distention of the small intestines with intraluminal fluid apparent (Figure 23-31) . This modality has not been extensively assessed as an adjunct to diagnosis of foreign body intestinal obstruction in cats specifically, although there are several papers assessing dogs and small numbers of cats that agree with its utility. 114,156,161 Linear foreign bodies are more difficult to assess ultrasonographically, but plicated bowel can be recognized, sometimes with the foreign body seen as a hyperechoic line centrally. 156 SI A technique has been described for removal of linear foreign bodies by making a single enterotomy incision proximally and passing a red rubber catheter over the linear foreign body aborally, milking the foreign body within the catheter through the colon for retrieval from the cat's anus by an assistant. 2 This technique is not always effective, because it can be hampered if the foreign body is knotted or does not run smoothly through the red rubber catheter. 102 If the affected bowel segment demonstrates evidence of necrosis or perforation on the mesenteric border of the intestine, resection and anastomosis should be performed. Necrosis is indicated by dark discoloration, thin intestinal wall, poor arterial pulsation, poor capillary bleeding, or lack of peristalsis. End-to-end anastomosis can be accomplished using a simple interrupted appositional pattern or a modified simple continuous appositional pattern with the same type of suture material used for enterotomy closure. 14,88",

Siamese and Burmese cats seem to be overrepresented. The most common locations are the ileocolic region and the jejunum. 15, 25, 83, 110 Affected cats present with nonspecific signs of gastrointestinal disease, such as anorexia and lethargy. Vomiting is not necessarily a presenting sign; diarrhea may occur. Abdominal palpation reveals a mass in most cases. Plain and contrast radiography only show evidence of obstruction and usually do not help define that the bowel has intussuscepted. 15, 25, 83, 110 Ultrasonography is very useful for diagnosis, because a distinctive pattern of alternating hypoechoic and hyperechoic concentric rings (Figure 23-34) is present in transverse sections. 25, 110 Sometimes, the target lesion seen can be hard to distinguish from the pathology of other intraabdominal masses, such as lymph nodes, and in these cases, the size of the lesions can help, because the width will always be greater than 11 mm with an intussusception (because the sum of at least four intestinal wall widths cannot be less) and is often greater than16 mm. 110 Surgical correction is always required, and manual reduction is typically not possible because there is usually significant venous infarction, edema, and congestion (Figure 23 -35) as well as adhesions from fibrin and effusions from the affected bowel. 15, 25 If the intussusception does not reduce manually, resection of the and drier feces that become impacted, and this is known as obstipation. 140 Chronic, recurrent constipation and obstipation can result in megacolon, which refers to persistent increased bowel diameter that is not responsive to therapy. Megacolon is not a specific disease entity; it may be considered the most advanced stage in the spectrum of chronic constipation. 18 In most cases, constipation can be managed quite simply if the underlying cause is determined and dealt with.

Cats can also present for less specific signs, such as anorexia, lethargy, weight loss, and even vomiting. 140,170 Vomiting can occur because of colonic receptors stimulating vagal afferent endings, which, in turn, can stimulate the chemoreceptor trigger zone. 61 Sometimes owners are concerned that their cat is defecating less, but the cat has just changed its diet to a much lower-residue diet and so is producing less feces.

Another option is administration of a microenema, such as Microlax (McNeil Consumer Healthcare, Fort Washington, Pa.), which contains 5 mL of sodium lauryl sulfoacetate. These products act to lubricate the colon wall and therefore facilitate the passage of feces. The author prefers to use one or two of these within the consult room to observe the cat defecating (the cat must be provided with a litter tray!). The outside tube should be lubricated with the suppository contents before carefully inserting and then expressing the rest of the contents. There are also stimulant laxatives (containing bisacodyl) and emollient laxatives (containing sodium docusate) that have reportedly been used. 140 If a rectal suppository vial cannot easily be inserted because hardened fecal content obstructs its entry, a more substantive enema will be required (sometimes requiring sedation or anesthesia), and this is covered in the next section on management. Some cats present for the abdominal wall with the other hand, but great care must be taken with this maneuver, because the devitalized colon can be perforated more easily. 140,170 Enemas as described are painful for the cat, and opioid analgesia is recommended at the time of anesthesia. Opioids can reduce peristalsis in humans, 96 but having evacuated the bowel, the pain relief is more important than this transient effect. An alternative to enemas is administration of an oral polyethylene glycol (PEG 3350) solution (e.g., CoLyte, GoLytely). A nasoesophageal tube is placed and the solution is given as a slow trickle (6 to 10 mL/kg/hour) over 4 to 18 hours. Defecation usually results in 6 to 12 hours. In a retrospective study of 9 cats, median time to defecation was 8 hours and the median total dose of PEG 3350 was 80 mL/kg. 26a No adverse effects were noted.",

Practitioners can expect the radiographic assessment of colonic dilatation to exceed this guideline in cats with megacolon and, conversely, there are likely to be cats having colonic distention greater than this amount that will respond to medical and dietary management and can therefore not be defined as having megacolon.",

In these circumstances, the only possible therapy is subtotal colectomy.",

This approach has resulted in a more favorable clinical response than when the ICJ is also excised. 22, 170 When preserving the ICJ, it has been noted that, in some rare cases, it can be difficult to join the proximal segment of colon to the distal piece of descending colon because of the tethering effect of the ileocecocolic blood vessels. In these cases, sacrificing these vessels and removing the ICJ (i.e., total colectomy) is recommended to facilitate approximation of the ileum to the distal colonic segment. 21 A recently described technique using a biofragmentable anastomosis ring, compared with sutured anastomoses, showed no discernible effect on prognosis. 131 Prognosis following subtotal colectomy is generally good. A review of multiple papers, totaling over 100 cats that had undergone subtotal colectomy, found the most commonly reported perioperative complication was diarrhea or loose stools immediately after surgery. In the majority of individuals, stool consistency improves without further treatment so that within 1 to 6 weeks of the surgery soft, formed stools are developed. Diarrhea can persist in a small number of cases. In the longer term, in some cats, constipation can eventually return, but this can usually be managed by dietary and medical therapies. 172 ",

The retention of secretions may predispose to sacculitis, but impacted anal sacs do not always result in inflammation. Abscessation is a likely sequel to sacculitis. 155 Cats usually present for licking, scratching, or biting at the perineal area and can present for scooting (or dragging their anus) as dogs do.

The first host is a snail, while the second intermediate host is a lizard, toad, gecko, or skink. 46 Cats become infected with this fluke after ingesting an infected second intermediate host. The prepatent period for the fluke is 8 weeks. 46 Most infections are subclinical. If clinical signs do occur, they may include weight loss, vomiting, diarrhea, icterus, hepatomegaly, or abdominal distention. Diagnosis involves identification of ova shed in the feces using a fecal sedimentation method 46 or by finding adult flukes in the gall bladder or bile ducts during abdominal surgery. Treatment involves administering praziquantel (20 mg/kg, q24h, PO for 3 to 5 days) and/or surgical removal of the flukes. 3",

A reliable diagnosis may be difficult to obtain for several reasons. Cysts are small, easily missed, and must be differentiated from plant debris or yeast. 37 Trophozoites are short lived outside the body and can only be found in very fresh, watery feces or, better yet, in diarrheic feces collected directly from the cat's rectum. 37 Shedding of cysts is usually intermittent, and the intensity of shedding varies greatly. 28, 37 Because of these difficulties, the absence of the organism in a fecal sample does not eliminate it as the cause of diarrhea. It is often necessary to test multiple fecal samples, using at least two different techniques in order to find the organism. 37, 39 The easiest test to perform is a fecal smear or wet mount examination to identify trophozoites or cysts (Figures 23-42 and 23-43 ). The sample examined should be very fresh, warm, diarrheic feces. 39 One drop of feces is placed on a slide along with a drop of 0.9% saline or Lugol iodine. 28 Trophozoites are identified by their characteristic structure (Table 23- 21) . The motile trophozoites have a motion described as appearing like the back and forth rolling motion of a falling leaf. Since Lugol iodine stain kills the trophozoite, there will be no motion to detect. 28 This test is not very sensitive; however, with trained examiners, the test has a high specificity.",

The sample should be warm, fresh feces or feces refrigerated for no more than 2 days. 28 The processed sample is examined for the same structures as the wet mount. The sensitivity of examining one sample is 70% 28 and increases as more samples are examined. The sensitivity of looking at three samples is 95% 26, 28 ; therefore the test is not considered negative until three specimens have been found free of the organism. 39 A fecal antigen test that identifies the encystment protein is available. The SNAP Giardia antigen test (IDEXX Laboratories) uses fresh or frozen feces, or feces refrigerated for less than 7 days. 34 Since the antigen is continuously shed, this test avoids the problem of intermittent shedding of the whole organism. 28 The sensitivity of the test is 85%, with a specificity of 100%. 35 By combining the antigen test with a zinc sulfate fecal centrifugal flotation, the sensitivity improves to 97.8%. 11 It is unknown how long the antigen remains in the feces after treatment. Thus a zinc sulfate centrifugal flotation examination should be used to evaluate therapeutic efficacy. 28, 39 The use of this test in cats without diarrhea is controversial, because these cats are unlikely to shed cysts. The zoonotic significance of a positive antigen test in a cat not shedding cysts is unknown and may cause confusion. 39 Polymerase chain reaction detection of Giardia DNA is available, but the test has not been standardized across all diagnostic laboratories. One needs to ensure the laboratory performing the test has validated it for assemblage F. The test may also be used to identify cats harboring the zoonotic assemblages A and B. The sensitivity of this test is unknown. 39 ",

When six experimentally infected cats received 56.5 mg/ kg of febantel q24h PO for 5 days, four of them stopped shedding G. duodenalis cysts. 39 Metronidazole has been the traditional drug used to treat G. duodenalis in pets. 28 The drug is also useful for treating concurrent small intestinal bacterial overgrowth and clostridial infections. 39 The administration of metronidazole may eliminate shedding in 67% of cats. 26 Neurologic side effects may occur at the dose recommended for treatment of Giardia (see above, Therapeutics for Vomiting and Diarrhea). The use of a Giardia vaccine was ineffective in clearing infection by itself. 44 The combination of fenbendazole and metronidazole has been suggested as the initial treatment of choice for G. duodenalis infections. 39 Although controlled studies are lacking, they may work synergistically by acting on two different targets within the parasite. 28 Febantel would be expected to have the same synergism with metronidazole.",

Transmission of G. duodenalis from cats to humans is rare and unproven. 28 Still, it seems prudent to consider the owner's health when contemplating management of giardial infections in cats. To avoid human health risks, cats with diarrhea that test positive for G. duodenalis should be treated with the goal of controlling the diarrhea. 39 Since no treatment for G. duodenalis is completely effective or 100% safe, treatment of positive cats without diarrhea should only begin after a discussion of the benefits and risks of the treatment with the owner. 39",

            "text": "Tritrichomonas foetus is best known for causing bovine reproductive infections. It is an obligate anaerobic parasite 26 that also colonizes the lower intestinal tract of cats. There are enough differences between the two isolates that the feline isolate does not cause disease in heifers and vice versa. 39 The parasite depends on the host's normal intestinal flora and secretions for obtaining nutrition. 7 A report from the United States of purebred cats tested at an international cat show found T. foetus in 36 of the 117 cats tested, a prevalence of 31%. 23 This parasite seems to have a higher prevalence in purebred cats than nonpurebred cats. A study of pet cats visiting veterinary hospitals across the United States reported 12 of 32 purebred cats were positive for T. foetus, while only 5 of 141 nonpurebred cats were positive. In this same study, 12 of the 17 positive tests were from purebred cats. 45 A study from the United Kingdom of diarrheic fecal samples sent to a veterinary diagnostic laboratory reported similar results. Purebred cats represented 14 of the 16 cats testing positive for T. foetus. The U.K. study also found the Siamese and Bengal breeds each represented 6 of 14 positive cats; only two other breeds tested positive. 25 Transmission Like most other protozoal parasites, T. foetus is transmitted by ingestion of the parasite, in this case, the trophozoite. Unlike most of the other parasites, T. foetus does not form cysts and only survives up to 3 days outside the body in moist feces. 47 A cat becomes infected through the use of a shared litter box with an infected cat. After walking into the box, the parasite is transferred from the infected feces of one cat to the paws of the other. Infection then occurs through ingestion of the trophozoites during grooming. 47 After infection, T. foetus colonizes the distal ileum and colon, 15 followed by shedding of infective trophozoites 2 to 7 days later. 19 ",

However, it always returns at the cessation of therapy. 39, 47 Many cats experience a spontaneous resolution of the diarrhea within 2 years of diagnosis. 15, 38 Since T. foetus causes reproductive infections in heifers and bulls, there is speculation the parasite also infects the reproductive tract in cats.

Examination of multiple samples may be required to find the T. foetus trophozoites with this technique because it is insensitive. 39 The trophozoites must be differentiated from Giardia duodenalis based on structural differences and motility patterns (see Table 23 -21). The trophozoites of T. foetus can be cultured using the InPouch TF system (Biomed Diagnostics). This test is more sensitive than the fecal wet mount examination and detects 1000 trophozoites per sample. 15 The number of parasites shed by a cat with diarrhea is high enough to be routinely detected with this method. 18 The test should be performed in-house, because the parasite is unlikely to survive the trip to the laboratory. 47 The test pouch is inoculated with 50 \u00b5g of freshly collected feces, about the size of a peppercorn. 18 Any more than this increases the chances of bacterial overgrowth. 15 The pouch is incubated at 25\u00b0 C and examined under the microscope for motile trophozoites every other day for 12 days. The pouch should be tapped gently to dislodge the parasites, which tend to collect along the seams. 15 The test is considered negative if parasites are not found after 12 days. One benefit of this system is that it does not support growth of Giardia duodenalis or Pentatrichomonas hominis. 18 If a fecal wet mount examination and culture are both negative and infection with T. foetus is still under consideration, a PCR test can be performed. This test detects DNA from live or dead trophozoites, but is more expensive than other diagnostic methods. 47 This test is more sensitive than the other two methods and can detect 10 parasites per sample. 16 The sample size is 200 mg of feces not contaminated by litter preserved in 3 to 5 mL of rubbing alcohol shipped at room temperature. 15 Trophozoites of T. foetus are sometimes found in colonic biopsy samples adhered to the surface or in the lumen of crypts. 15 ",

The parasite enters into one of two cycles, depending on the host species. The enteroepithelial cycle only occurs in cats and results in shedding of oocysts after sexual reproduction of the parasite. After a cat ingests an infective oocyst or a tissue cyst, the parasite enters the mucosal cells of the small intestine, where it may undergo development and sexual reproduction, after which oocysts are shed. 12 The prepatent period after ingesting an infective oocyst is 19 to 48 days, while shedding after ingesting tissue cysts starts in 3 to 10 days. 4 Fecal shedding, which occurs only after initial infection, lasts for 2 to 3 weeks 4,31 and the oocysts become infective 1 to 5 days after they are shed. 12 The extraintestinal cycle occurs in any animal, including cats. After ingestion, the parasite penetrates the cells of the small intestine and rapidly replicates in the enterocytes and associated lymph nodes into tachyzoites. After hematogenous and lymphatic spread, tachyzoites infect cells in all tissues of the body. 4 Tissues most commonly infected include the brain, liver, pancreas, and lungs. 30 If a pregnant queen becomes infected, tachyzoites cause placentitis, after which they infect the fetus. 13 In 3 weeks, the host's immune response slows parasite replication, and the resultant bradyzoites form tissue cysts 30 in the brain, striated muscle, and liver, and they remain viable for the life of the animal. 4 Immunosuppressive drugs or disease may dull the suppression of parasite division by the host immune system and allow the slowly dividing bradyzoites in tissue cysts to begin rapid division, thereby reactivating the infection with tachyzoites. 30 ",

Maternally acquired IgG persists in kittens for 8 to 12 weeks. 13 A rising IgG titer is associated with an active infection, but the degree of increase is not associated with the severity of the clinical signs. If a cat becomes seronegative, it is more likely the titer has fallen below the sensitivity of the test rather than the parasite has been eliminated from the body. 31 Because of the vague nature of the clinical signs, many cats are presented later in the course of the disease. By this time, they may have switched from IgM to IgG production or passed the time of maximal IgG production. Thus a negative IgM titer or a lack of rising IgG titer does not rule out T. gondii infection. 30 Also, reactivation of tissue cysts is rarely associated with rising IgG titers. 31 Ultimately, the diagnosis of an active systemic T. gondii infection requires demonstration of an IgM titer greater than 1 : 64 or a fourfold increase in IgG titers over a 2-to 3-week period along with signs consistent with toxoplasmosis, the exclusion of other disorders that may cause the clinical signs, and response to appropriate anti-T. gondii treatment. 31 Although serum IgM titers may be increased in otherwise healthy cats, increased IgM titers in cerebrospinal fluid or aqueous humor only occurs in cats with active CNS or ocular infections. 30 ",

Necropsy studies from the 1970s to 1990s reported prevalence of feline pancreatitis ranging from 0.45% to 2.4%. 21,67 A more recent study 17 found 67% of 115 cats had evidence of pancreatitis. However, this included pancreatic pathology in 45% of apparently healthy cats, which suggests that mild pathology is unlikely to cause clinical signs. These studies all show lymphocytic pancreatitis to be significantly more prevalent than acute pancreatitis. This may underestimate the true prevalence of acute pancreatitis, since it is understood that no permanent histopathologic changes are present after resolution of acute pancreatitis. 89 It is also possible that studies assessing pathology in necropsy cases do not reflect clinical practice.",

A review of eight prior series totaling 159 cases of acute pancreatitis in cats found anorexia (87% of cases) and lethargy (81%) to be the most common historical findings. 78 Vomiting was recognized in 46% of cases, diarrhea in 12%, and weight loss in 47%. Physical examination findings were similarly nonspecific with dehydration (54%) being the major finding; fever was recognized in only 25% of cases and abdominal pain in 19%. It is important to note that vomiting and abdominal pain, key features of pancreatitis in dogs, are not consistently recognized in cats. Similar, nonspecific findings indistinguishable from IBD are recognized in cats with chronic pancreatitis. 3, 6 Diagnosis Because the presenting signs and physical examination findings are nonspecific, the diagnosis of pancreatitis can be challenging, requiring not only clinical suspicion but a combination of diagnostic modalities. For the most part, hematology and plasma biochemistry findings are unremarkable, although a combination of findings may increase clinical suspicion. For example, moderate elevations in liver enzymes, bilirubin, and glucose are present in approximately 50% of cases and hypocalcemia in approximately two of three of cases; hypocalcemia infers a poorer prognosis. Hypoalbuminemia is seen in approximately one of three of cases and has important implications for fluid therapy. 78 Amylase and lipase elevations are not reflective of pancreatitis in cats. 47 Feline trypsinlike immunoreactivity (fTLI) is the diagnostic test of choice of exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, but elevations in pancreatitis are not seen consistently enough to warrant use of this test for this purpose. 29, 47, 71 The biggest recent advance in feline pancreatic diagnostics has been the characterization of feline pancreatic lipase, 69 leading to the development of a radioimmunoassay for the measurement of feline pancreatic lipase immunoreactivity (fPLI). 70 It must be remembered, however, that an increase in fPLI only tells the clinician that pancreatic pathology is present, but not the cause of pathology, which may be, for example, neutrophilic or lymphocytic pancreatitis or neoplasia, and it may or may not involve the intestines or liver. fPLI should therefore be used as a screening test, with elevated results not suggesting a diagnostic end point. Further, the high interassay variability of this test 70 would suggest that mild cases may be missed as shown in one study 24 and that the test may not be appropriate for serial monitoring. fPLI is currently available as \"Spec fPL\" from commercial laboratories and has a sensitivity of 79% and a specificity of 82% when 5.4 \u00b5g/L is used as the diagnostic cut off 25 compared with 3.5 \u00b5g/L, which is the listed reference range high point.",

The underlying disease process cannot be assumed from an elevated fPLI; in one study of 63 cases, acute necrotizing pancreatitis could not be distinguished from chronic nonsuppurative pancreatitis by signalment, duration of signs, or clinical findings. 22 The major utility of diagnostic imaging is to rule out other differential diagnoses, such as an intestinal foreign body, and perhaps confirm that the pancreas is affected. Radiography is non-specific for diagnosis of pancreatitis, but findings may include decreased abdominal detail (sometimes associated with ascites), soft tissue density in the right cranial quadrant of the abdomen, hepatomegaly, or gas-filled intestines 22,60,64 (see .

One study found 5 of 20 cats with pancreatic necrosis had such a change 60 ; the mechanisms resulting in pleural effusion are not precisely defined. Ultrasonography has high specificity (>85%) but low sensitivity (<35%) for recognizing pancreatitis in cats, 22, 29, 60, 71 with findings dependent on operator skills, quality of equipment, and severity of lesions. Typical findings are hypoechogenicity of the pancreas, which may be enlarged or irregular; hyperechogenicity of the peripancreatic fat; the possible presence of abdominal effusion; and abnormal findings with other organs, such as liver or intestine, may add to the clinical picture 22, 60, 64, . One study indicated that contrast-enhanced Doppler ultrasonography can provide further diagnostic insights. 54 A recent study suggested that endosonography may be useful in cases where transabdominal ultrasonography is difficult, for example, because of obesity, hyperechoic mesentery, or excessive intestinal gas. 61 For more than 20 years, computed tomography (CT) has been a commonly used modality to confirm pancreatitis in humans, 55 but this reliability has not been demonstrated in cats, where sensitivity may be as low as 20%. 24, 29 Definitive diagnosis of pancreatitis, including differentiation of the inflammatory process, can only be made by cytologic assessment of pancreatic tissue. In most cases, ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration (FNA) of the pancreas is technically difficult because of the small dimension of the feline pancreas; there appears to be no assessment of feline pancreatic FNA findings in the literature. Gross inspection of the pancreas and samples for histologic assessment can be obtained during laparotomy 22, 64 (see or laparoscopy. 16, 79 Because pancreatitis often occurs concurrently with pathology of other organs, 22 thorough evaluation of the abdomen by ultrasonography or gross inspection is recommended, as are multiple biopsies of, for example, intestines, liver, and mesenteric lymph nodes, where appropriate. Clinicians may be reluctant to biopsy the pancreas because of perceived risks of deleterious effects. Studies of pancreatic biopsy in healthy cats dispel the concern that the pancreas is unforgiving to mild manipulation and biopsy 16,42a and the author's clinical experience is consistent with these findings.",

Increased frequency of defecation and the presence of mucus in the feces of some cats can lead to the diarrhea being characterized as large bowel. Only about 20% to 30% of cats are polyphagic, some described as having a ravenous appetite; conversely, some cats present with anorexia. Vomiting has also been described. Since cats with EPI often have concurrent disorders, such as IBD, the clinical signs recognized may reflect the concurrent disease and not necessarily EPI alone. Physical examination findings are similarly nonspecific, with thin/ emaciated body condition being the most common finding. Hematologic findings are non-specific, but a mild nonregenerative, normocytic, normochromic anemia may be recognized as well as lymphopenia or neutrophilia. Plasma biochemistry results may show a mild to moderate increase in alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and a mild increase in alkaline phosphatase in some cats. Mild to moderate hyperglycemia may be seen, as may mild hypoglycemia or normoglycemia. 66, 68, 74 Hypocobalaminemia is recognized in nearly all cats with EPI. 66, 68, 74, 85, 87 This may be because of insufficient production of intrinsic factor, a cobalamin-binding protein only produced by the pancreas in cats and necessary for ileal absorption of cobalamin 27 ; it may also be because of failure of pancreatic enzymes to liberate cobalamin from binding by R protein in the duodenum or small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO), not yet specifically described in cats. 74 Folate concentrations may be reduced (because of concurrent intestinal malab sorption), 68 normal, 68, 74 or increased, 74 which may relate to reduced pancreatic bicarbonate secretion, secondary to severe hypocobalaminemia, 59 or associated with SIBO. 7 None of these presenting complaints, physical examination findings, or routine testing results are specific to EPI.

The required dose can vary quite substantially from cat to cat. It is appropriate to start with one teaspoon of powder with food twice daily, and adjustments can be made depending on the response; most cats accept the powder readily if it is mixed thoroughly through canned food, but other flavors (e.g., fish oil or brine from canned tuna) can be used to disguise the taste if necessary. Raw pancreas (e.g., from beef or pork) may also be used, with 30 to 60 g twice daily an appropriate starting dose. 66 Since most cats with EPI are hypocobalaminemic, supplementation by subcutaneous injection is required (oral supplementation is not effective since cobalamin deficiency leads to cobalamin malabsorption). An appropriate dose for most cats is 250 \u00b5g, and it is usually given weekly for 6 weeks, then every second week for a further six doses; it is appropriate to continue dosing every month beyond that. Owners can be taught to inject their cats at home (as owners of diabetic animals are taught to do with insulin). 66 Because some cats may have SIBO, antibiotics such as metronidazole (15 to 25 mg/kg PO every 12 hours for 14 days) may be warranted. An elevation of folate may arouse suspicion of SIBO, but it is appropriate to try antibiotics in a cat failing to respond to enzyme and cobalamin supplementation.",

The most common early clinical signs observed in cats with liver disease are anorexia, lethargy, and weight loss, which are signs present in many (if not most!) feline diseases. 2, 15 Because these early indicators of disease do not point specifically toward liver disease, a delay in diagnosis will occur unless the clinician carefully considers all possibilities and performs other tests to further evaluate the situation. For example, feline hepatic lipidosis is the most common form of liver disease in cats in the United States, United Kingdom, Japan, and Western Europe, occurring with a prevalence of nearly 16% in one study. 2 However, the most common, and often only, clinical sign associated with onset of this condition is anorexia; the signs of serious hepatic disease (especially jaundice and vomiting) do not occur until later (days or weeks) in the course of the disease. 2, 21 Recognition that anorexia in a cat, even for a few days, is a risk factor for development of hepatic lipidosis is essential, and this risk is increased in obese cats. 11, 21 Further, the clinical signs of liver failure develop much more slowly; many cats with hepatic lipidosis present alert and responsive until much later in the course of the disease, thus delaying onset of appropriate therapy. A similar clinical situation exists for the second most common form of liver disease in cats, feline cholangitis syndrome. 15, 28, 58 This complex of diseases in the cat can be associated with signs ranging from anorexia and lethargy to vomiting and jaundice, and these signs can vary in severity and prevalence. The key point is that except for development of jaundice, there is no constellation of clinical signs that are classic clinical indicators of liver disease in cats. 15, 28 As with many feline diseases, the subtle clinical signs of anorexia, lethargy, or inactivity are often the only signs of illness and should be further investigated.",

            "text": "There are few changes that occur in the complete blood count that are specific indicators of primary liver disease in cats. The most common finding is the presence of poikilocytes, which are red blood cells with an irregular shape, speculated to be caused by changes in membrane lipids as a result of liver dysfunction. 14 Other abnormalities may occur, such as anemia of chronic disease or neutrophilia, but these findings are nonspecific and occur with variable frequency. Perhaps the most important reason for obtaining a hemogram is in icteric cats, because this test is essential to help rule out hemolysis as the cause of the hyperbilirubinemia. The serum chemistry profile can be very helpful, but there are several critical points in interpretation of these values that are important to review. The hepatic transaminases (alanine aminotransferase [ALT] and aspartate aminotransferase [AST]) are leakage enzymes but do not discriminate among hepatobiliary disorders, nor do they provide an indicator of severity or disease origin. Thus although increases in ALT may be noted in cats with liver disease, they are also present in a variety of other systemic infectious, inflammatory, neoplastic, and and protein-losing nephropathies can also cause loss of albumin and affect cholesterol, it is essential to evaluate the cat for these problems when interpreting these results. Finally, bilirubin metabolism is a critical function of the liver, but interpretation of hyperbilirubinemia requires a careful consideration of bilirubin disposition. Hyperbilirubinemia develps because of one of three possible causes: (1) excessive hemolysis of red blood cells (RBC) (also known as prehepatic icterus)-high bilirubin in the blood stream occurs because of an overload of the mononuclear/phagocyte system with heme pigments from RBC destruction, (2) hepatic parenchymal disease or insufficiency (also known as hepatic icterus)-resulting in lack of normal bilirubin metabolism in hepatocytes and regurgitation of the pigments into the blood stream when they are not taken up into cells and excreted in bile, and (3) disease of gall bladder, biliary tract, or pancreatic duct (also known as posthepatic icterus)resulting in obstruction of the bile ducts or loss of bile into the abdomen (duct or gall bladder rupture and bile peritonitis). 41 The bottom line is that in any cat with hyperbilirubinemia, an assessment of the packed cell volume and RBC morphology should be completed to determine whether icterus is caused by hemolysis. Once hemolysis is ruled out, then assessment of primary endocrine diseases, including hyperthyroidism, feline heartworm disease, FIP, and neoplasia.* Alternatively, the cholestatic membrane-associated enzymes alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and gamma glutamyltransferase (GGT) are especially useful for recognizing disorders involving biliary or pancreatic ductal components. Unlike the dog, these enzymes will only increase modestly in cats, even in severe disease, and there is no glucocorticosteroid or drug induction of the enzymes to influence interpretation. 14, 37 Thus increases in ALP in the adult cat represent a release of enzyme from the hepatobiliary tree and should be considered clinically important. Both ALP and GGT are produced in other tissues than the liver, with the highest GGT activity present in the kidney and pancreas; however, sources other than the liver do not contribute to the activity of these enzymes in health. Recent studies of the effects on these enzymes in cats with pancreatitis, cholangitis, extrahepatic bile duct obstruction (EHBDO), and hepatic lipidosis reveal some important characteristics in interpreting increases in these enzymes. 14 First, both ALP and GGT are increased in cats with pancreatitis, cholangitis, or EHBDO, because inflammation in the biliary tree also affects the pancreatic ducts (and vice versa, Figure 23-55) , and if the fold increases in these enzymes are similar, the diagnosis is likely one of the three. 15 Conversely, in cats with hepatic lipidosis (without concurrent inflammatory disease of the biliary or pancreatic duct system), large increases in ALP are observed, but GGT will remain normal or only slightly increased. Thus if the increase in ALP is 5 to 10 times, while GGT is not increased or is only increased 1 to 2 times, then the likely diagnosis is hepatic lipidosis. [14] [15] [16] Other than enzymes on the biochemistry panel, which are of limited value for assessing liver function, there are several key tests that can be used to help assess liver function cats with elevated liver enzymes. These five tests found on most routine biochemistry panels are helpful functional indicators: cholesterol, bilirubin, glucose, albumin, and urea nitrogen (BUN). However, none are immune to outside influences on their interpretation, including bilirubin and cholesterol, which are the most liver specific. In cats with severe liver disease or failure, bilirubin levels tend to be quite elevated, while BUN, albumin, cholesterol, and glucose concentrations tend to be significantly decreased, reflecting inability to metabolize urea (lack of arginine), inability to produce albumin or cholesterol, and abnormal metabolization of glucose. However, these changes represent severe loss of liver function and thus are not sensitive indicators of liver function because the changes occur quite late in the course of the disease. Nevertheless, in cats with elevated liver enzymes and clinical signs of liver disease, these values should be carefully assessed. Because GI disease of hepatic failure. In nonicteric cats with severe liver disease or in young cats suspected of having a portosystemic shunt, serum bile acids are the more reliable indicator of hepatic insufficiency. 18 The measurement of serum bile acid concentrations, preprandially and postprandially, is the most reliable, readily available, and sensitive test of hepatic function in nonicteric cats. 5, 14 That being said, although increases in bile acids are accurate indicators of hepatic insufficiency, the levels cannot be used to assess severity of disease or the type of dysfunction. Further, bile acid assays are most effective when paired samples (preprandial-and postprandial) are compared, because single, fasting, or random bile acid samples can result in a falsenegative (normal) result. However, cats will often not eat in the hospital or when they are sick, and this prevents collection of a postprandial sample. However, this does not invalidate the results, because if the result of the single bile acid sample is abnormal, it does reliably indicate liver dysfunction.",

Healthy cats excrete a small percentage of conjugated bile acids in the urine 14 ; however, in cats with liver disorders that cause increased serum bile acids (and especially cholestatic liver diseases) a significant increase in urine bile acid excretion occurs. When urine bile acids (UBA) were collected 4 to 8 hours after a meal and measured (normalizing the value with urine creatinine: UBA/UCr) and compared with serum bile acids in a study of 54 cats with hepatic disease, 17 cats with nonhepatic disease, and 8 normal cats, the results were highly correlated. 47 The utility of the urine bile acid test is that it does not require a paired sample (postprandial test), and it is not as affected as the serum test is by hemolysis or lipemia of the blood sample. Normal cats will have an UBA/UCr of less than 4.4 \u00b5mol/mg, while values greater than 4.4 are considered evidence of significant hepatic dysfunction. 47 It is well known that the liver plays a central role in coagulation homeostasis and is the single site of synthesis of many coagulation proteins, anticoagulant proteins, and fibrinolytic factors. Vitamin K is one of the most common factors found to be inactive or deficient in cats with liver dysfunction, and it is essential for normal functioning of factors II, VII, IX, and X; protein C and S; and thrombin. Insufficient or inactive vitamin K can occur for a variety of reasons, including dietary restriction (e.g., anorexia or diet deficiency), disruption of the enteric microflora that synthesize vitamin K (e.g., chronic antibiotic therapy), diseases causing fat malabsorption (e.g., IBD, exocrine pancreatic insufficiency), ingestion of vitamin K antagonists, or liver dysfunction. 20 For example, in cats with hepatic lipidosis, approximately 25% will have an increased prothrombin time (PT), 35% will have an increased partial thromboplastin time (PTT), but 60% of cats will have increased PIVKA parenchymal disease versus disease of the biliary tree is completed by evaluating the clinical presentation, laboratory values, and imaging of the biliary tree and abdomen for possible evidence of biliary or pancreatic disease.",

There are several situations where liver function testing may be indicated, but the most common indications for additional testing would be a cat with persistently elevated liver enzymes of unknown origin, a cat that develops urethral obstruction because of urate stones (suggestive of portosystemic shunting) or a cat with possible polycystic liver disease. 5 One of the oldest tests of liver function, because of its association with development of hepatoencephalopathy, is measurement of blood ammonia levels. 38 However, although this test is the only practical way to diagnose hepatoencephalopathy in dogs, the test has a number of limitations, including differences in ammonia levels between arterial and venous (lower) samples and significant sample handling issues (ammonia is labile and results are affected by improper sample handling or lack of immediate measurement) that make its use difficult in practice. 43 In cats hyperammonemia is even less common than in dogs likely because of their highfunctioning urea cycle pathways 14 ; the assays have not been validated for feline blood in most laboratories, and as such, the test is not recommended as the sole indicator uncommon in cats, the most common causes are neoplasia (primarily of the pancreas, but cholangiocarcinomas can occur) or chronic pancreatitis, which can occur concurrently with cholangitis in cats, resulting in both intrahepatic and extrahepatic cholestasis in some cats. 23, 41 The bile ducts are affected in cats with chronic pancreatitis, because the feline biliary system and pancreatic duct system merge at the level of the pancreas to form a single duct that empties into the duodenum. Thus in cats with either pancreatitis or biliary disease, recent evidence has shown that the inflammation affects both organs. 54, 59 Further, in chronic pancreatitis, either persistent inflammation or development of fibrosis can result in dilation or obstruction of the common bile duct. 33 In cats with chronic EHBDO, the common bile duct will become widely dilated and tortuous, a finding easily seen on abdominal ultrasonography but a problem not easily managed (Figures 23-56 and 23-57) . Interestingly, the gallbladder is often not enlarged, and may in fact be small in cats with this condition, because the remaining fluid in the gallbladder is white bile (highly concentrated mucinous bile from which the pigment has been resorbed). 41 In addition, variable filling of the gall bladder is a normal phenomenon; thus gallbladder size is not an indicator of EHBDO.",

In any case, abnormalities in the clotting cascade related to vitamin K deficiency in cats with liver disease are common, whether or not they show evidence of active bleeding. And because the balance of the coagulation system in a cat with liver disease can be disrupted by a procedure that initiates small amounts of bleeding (e.g., a biopsy), all cats with liver disease should be given vitamin K as a precautionary measure before and after invasive procedures, even if the clotting times (PT and PTT) are normal. This may be especially important in cats with hepatic lipidosis, because their vitamin K clotting status is likely to be even more affected by the concurrent anorexia and disruption of enteric microflora. 14 The dose of vitamin K 1 (phytonadione, aquaME-PHYTON [Merck, West Point, Pa.]) used prophylactically is 2.5 mg SC, IM, or PO q12h for 3 to 5 days, then weekly until recovered.",

Cholestasis is the reduction of bile flow, which can occur at any point along the biliary tree; bile production occurs in hepatocytes, and flow is connected to the distal concentrating components (gallbladder and common bile duct) by the bile ductules. Thus cholestasis can occur inside the liver's biliary tree (intrahepatic cholestasis) or outside the liver in the gallbladder and common bile duct (extrahepatic cholestasis). Intrahepatic cholestasis most often occurs in diseases involving hepatocellular damage, leakage, or swelling, such as infections (e.g., bacterial cholangiohepatitis, toxoplasmosis, FIP, or other diseases causing inflammation), infiltrative diseases (e.g., lymphoma), metabolic diseases (e.g., hepatic lipidosis), or diseases causing disruption of architecture (e.g., cirrhosis or severe polycystic disease). 41 Intrahepatic cholestasis occurs in zone 1 of the liver lobules (periportal zone); at the level of hepatocytes, canaliculi or bile ductules; and is damaging to cells because of the emulsifying properties of lipid on membrane lipids. However, because the liver has a large reserve capacity, clinical icterus (e.g., jaundice) only occurs in the most severe cases when the liver is affected diffusely. Thus severe or persistent intrahepatic cholestasis can serve to perpetuate the inflammation and cell damage if it is not corrected.",

In most hepatobiliary diseases of cats, cholestasis is occurring, but there may be no clinically apparent icterus because the degree of hyperbilirubinemia must be at least 2 to 3 times greater than the normal values to exceed the capacity of the liver to process the excess bilirubin. In cats with hyperbilirubinemia not caused by hemolysis, whether it is clinical or subclinical, there is no need for further evaluation of liver function (e.g., bile acid assays), because bilirubin is a more sensitive indicator of liver function than bile acids. The degree of hyperbilirubinemia does not suggest differentiation of intrahepatic versus extrahepatic cholestasis; however, the presence of acholic feces (white feces) is diagnostic for extrahepatic bile duct obstruction (EHBDO), because lack of stercobilinogen (the brown/black pigment in feces) is only found in cats with complete obstruction of the bile duct. Finally, the presence of intrahepatic cholestasis and clinical icterus in a cat indicates a diffuse hepatobiliary disease, such as cholangitis or hepatic lipidosis, as focal liver disease, even if severe, will not cause clinical hyperbilirubinemia because of the tremendous reserve capacity of the liver for bilirubin uptake.

            "text": "Portal hypertension is an abnormally high venous pressure in the portal system and is typically caused by increased resistance to portal blood flow. There are potentially three regional causes of portal hypertension: prehepatic (disease in the portal vein itself), hepatic (intrahepatic diseases causing compression or decreased flow), and posthepatic (diseases of the caudal vena cava, right heart or pulmonary vasculature). The most common cause of portal hypertension in the cat is cirrhosis or portal venous thrombosis, because portal vein hypoplasia (formerly known as microvascular dysplasia) is known to occur only in the dog, and the other causes of portal hypertension (Budd-Chiari syndrome, heartworm caval syndrome, pulmonary hypertension) are rare and more likely to occur in the dog. 41, 44 In any case, the clinically recognizable effects of portal hypertension are development of ascites (unusual in the cat), acquired portosystemic shunting (reported in cats), and development of hepatic encephalopathy (less common in cats than in dogs, because of their profound ability to handle protein wastes). 5, 36, 41 Most cats and dogs that develop hepatic encephalopathy (HE) secondarily to portal hypertension do so because of reduced liver function (because of portosystemic vascular shunting [PSS] or cirrhosis and the acquired shunting that develops). Cats can develop another form of chronic HE because of hepatic lipidosis, but this is believed to be because of the combination of liver failure and prolonged fasting, resulting in arginine deficiency and impaired ammonia detoxification. 2 Portosystemic vascular anomalies, also called portosystemic shunts or portovenous shunts (PSS), although less common than in dogs, also occur in cats. These vascular anomalies can be either congenital or acquired, single or multiple in number, and occur as extrahepatic vascular shunts or within the liver itself (intrahepatic shunts). 5 The shunting of blood around the liver is the cause of hepatic atrophy and reduced hepatic function that results in an accumulation of toxins, particularly ammonia that leads to the development of hepatoencephalopathy. The two most common veins that serve as the connection point for the shunting portal venous blood are the caudal vena cava and the azygous. 5 In cats a single, extrahepatic, portocaval shunt is the most commonly reported form, and occurs in 75% of cats with PSS. 5 As in dogs, specific breeds of cats may have PSS more commonly, and these include domestic shorthair cats, Burmese, Siamese, Persian, and Himalayan breeds. 5 In contrast to dogs, males may be more predisposed to PSS than females, but the clinical signs relate to the three body systems most affected: the central nervous system, GI tract, and urinary tract. The most common presenting complaints in cats are weight loss or poor/stunted growth, and dull, bizarre or lethargic behavior, especially after eating. Signs of GI disease common in dogs, such as vomiting, diarrhea, or inappetence, are less common in cats, but in one report, 75% of cats with PSS drooled. 5 Finally, cats with PSS often present with signs of lower urinary tract disease (e.g., hematuria, stranguria, or even obstruction) because of the development of urate uroliths (which are radiolucent, thus difficult to detect). 5 Because the most common signs of HE are apathy, listlessness, and decreased mental alertness, they are often not recognized specifically as indicative of brain dysfunction but as part of the constellation of signs of the liver disease. However, with progression of the has not been reported. The clinical presentation is typically nonspecific (the most common signs are vomiting, lethargy, and anorexia), and there are no laboratory changes that are suggestive of hepatic neoplasia. Thus the diagnosis must be made by identification of disease, other signs will develop, including ataxia, salivation, stupor, or coma. The best and only practical diagnostic test for HE is plasma measurement of ammonia levels. 43 However, as previously noted, the test has many technical issues that make its clinical utility in the practice setting difficult at best, and there are few laboratories that have validated ammonia measurement in the cat.",

The incidence of metastatic neoplasia (including lymphoma and mast cell tumors) The most common clinical signs are related to spontaneous rupture of the enlarged and friable liver. Affected cats may present with lethargy, anorexia, pale mucous membranes, and a heart murmur secondary to anemia. Clinical signs of liver disease are usually absent. Hepatomegaly and hypotension may also be found. Results of routine laboratory testing (mild to marked increases in ALT and globulins while ALP and GGT are typically normal) and ultrasonographic examination (hepatomegaly, generalized increase in hepatic parenchymal echogenicity) 4a of the liver may be supportive, but definitive diagnosis relies on histopathologic examination of a liver biopsy. FNA of the liver is not helpful because amyloid is rarely detected with this method. Hemostasis should be evaluated carefully before any biopsy procedure is planned. The most important differential diagnoses are FIP, hepatic lipidosis, and hepatic lymphoma. Scintigraphic imaging using I-123 serum amyloid P component has potential as a noninvasive test. 39a There is no specific treatment for amyloidosis in cats, so therapy is primarily supportive care (antioxidants, vitamin K, blood transfusion). Attention should be paid to identification and control of any underlying chronic inflammatory disease.

Radiographs are most useful to assess liver size, will reveal large hepatic masses, and provide evidence of radiopaque masses or other abnormalities in the abdomen. However, the preferred imaging modality used to assess hepatic structures in cats with suspected liver disease is abdominal ultrasonography (AUS). The reasons why ultrasonography is a more useful tool for assessment of the liver in cats are numerous, but because feline liver diseases are primarily diffuse, infiltrative, or metabolic diseases that also affect the biliary tree, ultrasonography is the only imaging tool that will give reliable diagnostic information. This widely available diagnostic tool can be helpful in determining liver size and parenchymal echogenicity, in identifying mass lesions, evaluating the biliary tree and gallbladder, quantifying flow (Doppler techniques), and identifying vascular anomalies. 29 As with all diagnostic modalities, the skill and experience of the operator is vital to accurate procurement and interpretation of the images. Further, it is important to remember that although ultrasonographic images are extremely useful in the clinical evaluation of a cat with possible liver disease, the images themselves do not represent a histologic diagnosis. structural abnormalities by hepatobiliary imaging and subsequent examination of the tissue either by FNA or biopsy techniques.",

More recently, cases of hepatic amyloidosis without renal involvement have been diagnosed in Siamese and related breeds, as well as in nonpedigreed cats. 4a,10a,30a The majority of cases have been described in Australia, the United Kingdom, and Europe. Amyloid A is deposited in the liver, probably in response to chronic inflammation in another organ. In the Siamese breed, a genetic component may contribute. 48a The amyloid A protein occurring in the Siamese breed differs from that known in the Abyssinian breed. 48a contraindicated in cats, because they may cause a lethal shock reaction. 40 A similar reaction may be seen with penetration of the larger bile ducts or gallbladder with a large-bore biopsy needle, because these tissues have a significant autonomic innervation in the cat that may result in bradycardia and shock following the procedure. 40, 48, 54 It is particularly important to recognize this as a risk in cats with EHDBO or dilated bile ducts, and this risk factor reiterates the need for ultrasound examination of the liver prior to making biopsy decisions. Nonetheless, owners should be informed of these potential risks, in addition to the risk of bleeding from biopsy sites in any cat undergoing liver sampling. 7, 48 Biopsy Techniques Liver biopsies, whether they are obtained by needle, laparoscopy, or surgical means, should be taken from a location that represents the primary liver pathology, handled appropriately to ensure accurate interpretation of the sample, and the histopathologic description should be interpreted according to the guidelines set by the WSAVA Standards for Clinical and Histologic Diagnosis of Canine and Feline Liver Disease. 42, 61 Guidelines for obtaining and handling surgical biopsies of the liver are reviewed elsewhere 27 and will not be further discussed. Because needle aspirates/biopsies, Tru-Cuttype biopsies, and laparoscopic biopsies are commonly used to obtain liver tissue in cats, the benefits and limitations of each of these techniques will be discussed. As a general rule, the more tissue that can be obtained, the better the pathologist's interpretation of the tissue abnormalities will be. For example, most pathologists believe that at least six portal areas are necessary to make a diagnosis of inflammation liver disease in cats. 42 This will require either a 16-or 18-gauge needle size or larger piece of tissue than is obtained with smaller needles or an aspirate. The amount of tissues required to view at least six portal areas is approximately 15 mg, and 5 mg will be required for culture of the tissue. 42 If other analyses of the tissues are considered (e.g., metal analysis), approximately 20 to 40 mg of liver is needed. 42 A typical laparoscopic cup biopsy forceps will provide 45 mg of liver tissue, a 14-g Tru-Cut-type biopsy needle provides 15 to 20 mg, and an 18-g needle biopsy provides only 3 to 5 mg of liver tissue. 42 Thus, depending on the clinical circumstances and considered differentials, the best approach for obtaining the needed tissue must be considered prior to planning the procedure.",

For example, in cats with hepatic lipidosis, the liver is quite enlarged and typically diffusely hyperechoic, while in cholangitis or other inflammatory diseases, the liver is more often diffusely hypochoic. 29 However, these sonographic findings are very nonspecific and can easily lead to errors in diagnosis if the tissue is not subsequently sampled for confirmation. 24, 35 Thus one of the most important utilities of the AUS is the ability to obtain liver tissue (either by aspiration or guided-needle biopsy) and for aspiration of the gallbladder to obtain bile for culture. 24, 49 These techniques alone have made the AUS an extremely important diagnostic tool in the evaluation of liver disease in cats.",

Some types of neoplasia (particularly round cell tumors) and vacuolar hepatopathies (hepatic lipidosis) can often be diagnosed by cytology using FNA techniques.

Further, if there is a need to obtain samples from the deeper tissues, the laparoscope can be used to direct a Tru-Cut needle biopsy to the best location for sampling. One of the major advantages of the laparoscopic technique is that it allows the operator to observe the biopsy sites for excessive bleeding, which is unusual, but if observed can be staunched by using pressure on the site, gelatin coagulation material placement, or electrocautery. With experienced operators, the complication rate for laparoscopy is very low (less than 2%), and most complications were because of anesthesia, bleeding, or air embolism. 48 Finally, although not necessary to have direct visualization to obtain an aspirate of gallbladder bile, laparoscopy allows easy sampling of bile for culture, which is important in all cats with suspected inflammatory liver disease or hepatobiliary disease.",

As in any patient with serious liver disease, initial therapy is always aimed at correction of any fluid or electrolyte abnormalities that may exist, because these may be profound if the cat has been vomiting. In addition, normalization of electrolytes is particularly important in cats that have been anorexic for an especially long time (1 to 2 weeks), because refeeding syndrome may be triggered with the initiation of feeding, resulting in sudden drops in potassium, phosphate, and magnesium. 1 Although this phenomenon is less common and usually less profound in cats fed enterally versus areas where appropriate, definitive diagnosis of certain infectious diseases (e.g., histoplasmosis). 57 However, even with these relatively straightforward diseases, FNA of liver tissue has significant limitations, the most important of which is the failure to accurately identify the primary disease. For example, although it is easy to make a diagnosis of hepatic lipidosis using this technique, a paper recently showed four cats that were incorrectly diagnosed with hepatic lipidosis instead of lymphoma because the FNA samples were obtained from areas that did not have lymphoma infiltration. 60 In another study, reviewing the agreement between FNA cytologic samples of liver and the histopathologic diagnosis, only 51% of the cases had overall agreement. 50 Thus although cytology of FNA samples of liver tissue in cats with diffuse hepatic disease remains a useful first step, it is important for the clinician to carefully interpret the results and discuss the potential limitations of this technique with owners.",

Tru-Cut biopsy guns are operated by a triggering device that can result in the induction of a lethal vagotonic shock reaction in the cat immediately following the procedure. 40 For most ultrasound-guided liver biopsy procedures, either the manual or, preferably, the semiautomatic Tru-Cut device is recommended for use in obtaining needle biopsies from cats. As a general rule, the Tru-Cut device will advance into the liver to a depth of 2 cm; so, it is essential to carefully note the amount of liver tissue available during the ultrasound assessment before advancing the needle for tissue collection. Properly obtained Tru-Cut needle biopsies are a valuable technique for obtaining a representative sample of liver tissue 61 ; however, because of the risk for bleeding or liver fracture with any movement, it is essential that cats be anesthetized for this procedure.",

If the cat is volume sensitive, it is important to carefully calculate how much water is used for flushing the tube, because a significant volume of fluid can be infused, creating a potential fluid overload.

            "text": "\u2022 It is highly stressful and will further increase the stress response and insulin resistance phenomena that are perpetuating the hepatic lipidosis. \u2022 It can be dangerous to the cat (aspiration) or operator (scratches/biting). \u2022 It is rarely able to meet the necessary nutritional goals set for the patient. \u2022 It may induce food aversion, a phenomenon unique to cats, but creating a profound aversion to the chosen food that can be lifelong. 12 Although NE tubes are excellent choices for short-term feeding of cats unwilling to eat, there are several disadvantages to their long-term use, including the nasal irritation that occurs, the relative ease with which cats can (and will) remove them, and the need to use liquid enteral diets. 62 Thus once the cat is deemed stable enough for general anesthesia, a long-term feeding tube solution is needed, and this typically is either an esophageal (E) tube ( Figure 23 -63) or percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube. 22, 62 Both feeding options are generally well tolerated methods for providing long-term feeding, but E tubes have the advantage of being placed without the need for any specialized equipment, and if complications occur, they are generally easily addressed, because the most common complications are infection at the tube site or premature removal of the tube by the cat. Placement of a PEG tube, although relatively easy to learn to place, requires having the appropriate endoscopic equipment, and if complications occur as a result of infection or tube removal, more significant morbidity can result. Because there is no advantage to placement of PEG tubes easiest to use, and are an acceptable choice in most situations. Finally, because many cat stomachs are volume sensitive with initiation of feeding, it is very important to start conservatively with small-volume feeding on a more frequent schedule. With prolonged fasting, the stomach volume of a cat with hepatic lipidosis may be reduced dramatically, preventing normal expansion and limiting intake to as little as 10% of normal. Thus to avoid vomiting when feeding, the starting volume may have to be as small as 10 to 15 mL every 2 to 3 hours. A good rule of thumb is to start with estimation of resting energy requirement (RER) (40 to 50 kcal/kg is a good estimate of RER), and then attempt to meet 25% of RER the first day. If no problems are encountered, increase the amount to 50% of RER the second day, and so on, but during this period, keep the frequency as high as possible (feed four to six meals per day) so that the volume remains relatively small at each meal. Once full RER has been achieved with multiple meals per day, the frequency of feeding can be gradually reduced to three to four meals per day. Most cats will eventually tolerate three meals per day well, and some can tolerate two meals per day, but this is quite variable and should not be attempted during the first weeks of feeding. In general, most cats with hepatic lipidosis will require tube feeding for a minimum of 3 to 6 weeks before they will show interest in food and begin eating again on their own. The tube should be retained until the cat has been eating on his or her own for at least 1 week or longer and can be maintained for a longer duration if it is being used to administer medications, because cats can eat normally with the E tube in place. The other therapeutic considerations for cats diagnosed with hepatic lipidosis are directed toward dealing with the complications of the disease and reducing the oxidative stress on the liver with hepatoprotective therapy (Table 23- 23) . In cats that are vomiting, in cats versus E tubes, placement of E tubes is advocated as the best approach for most practice situations. Interested readers are referred to several recent reviews on tube placement for specific details on each method and to Chapter 18. 22, 62 Diet selection is the next step in treatment planning for cats with hepatic lipidosis. In contrast to the belief that animals in liver failure need lower quantities of protein to reduce the workload on the liver, cats with hepatic lipidosis actually need protein to recover. In fact, the work of Biourge and coworkers showed that protein was the essential nutrient in reducing hepatic lipid accumulation, was essential to eliminate the negative nitrogen balance, and also appeared to minimize muscle catabolism. 9 Further, diets high in protein can improve insulin sensitivity and assist weight loss in recovery from obesity. 8, 11 Conversely, although carbohydrates are a readily available energy source, they are often associated with gastrointestinal distress (diarrhea, abdominal cramping) and hyperglycemia (secondary to the insulin resistance in place as a result of obesity and hepatic lipidosis). 2 Thus diets selected for cats with hepatic lipidosis should ideally be high in protein (>40% metabolizable energy [ME]) and have lower amounts of carbohydrates (<20% ME), with the remaining calories coming from fat. The diets that best fit this profile are the diets formulated for diabetic cats; however, kitten food, many adult cat foods, and some of the enteral recovery diets have this high protein/low carbohydrate profile. Many of the intestinal diets are not higher protein and are higher in carbohydrates, and so would not be the ideal choice. The key to using any of the foods that are not designed for use in a feeding tube is to blenderize them (and if necessary, strain the food) so that the food will easily go through the 14-or 16-g feeding tube without clogging it. Enteral diets designed for use in feeding tubes are the Because the primary starting point of the inflammatory disease in cats is the bile ducts (cholangitis), with inflammation extending to the hepatic parenchyma (cholangiohepatitis) only with time and severity, the term cholangitis syndrome has become the preferred terminology. The disease syndrome has been further classified by the WSAVA Liver Diseases Group into one of three primary types: neutrophilic or suppurative, chronic lymphoplasmacytic (Figures 23-64 and 23-65) , and lymphocytic (non-suppurative). 61 Each of the forms appears to behave quite differently clinically as well as in their progression and outcome. In general, cats with the suppurative form of CCH typically have an acute onset of illness, which often includes fever, anorexia, and vomiting, and they may become icteric quite quickly (Figure 23-66) . 28, 52 The nonsuppurative form of CCH (lymphocytic form) tends to be a more chronic condition, with affected cats showing nonspecific signs of illness that may include partial anorexia and lethargy, but the signs may wax and wane or are non-progressive. 28, 52 Because of the feline pancreatic and bile duct anatomy, it is common for cats with CCH to have pancreatitis and vice versa, and in some cases, cats will also have concurrent IBD; the constellation of the three conditions occurring together is called triaditis. 59 This combination is increasingly recognized in cats, and recent reports suggest from 50% to 85% of cats with one syndrome have all three diseases. 25, 51, 54, 59 At this time, the etiology of each of these syndromes and the pathogenesis is not well understood; however, the enteric microflora are presumed to play an important role in the suppurative form, and immune mechanisms are presumed to be the cause of the chronic inflammation found in the chronic nonsuppurative antiemetic therapy is beneficial, because it is imperative that the cat continues to receive some food, and vomiting will complicate this. Metoclopramide is often used in cats because of its ready availability and low cost, but it is a very weak antiemetic in cats and thus may not be the best choice. In most cats, the novel NK-1 receptor antagonist maropitant has been a safe and effective choice. 32 The most commonly used antiemetics in the author's feline practice are maropitant (1 mg/kg IV, SC or through the E tube q24h), ondansetron (0.22 mg/kg IV q8-12h), or dolasetron (0.5 mg/kg IV, SC q24h). In addition to control of vomiting, all cats with hepatic lipidosis should be given vitamin K 1 (2.5 mg/cat PO, SC) daily for a week, then weekly until the cat has recovered, and vitamin B 12 (cobalamin) (250 \u00b5g/cat SC) weekly for 6 weeks, then monthly until blood values are normal. 46 Other vitamins may become deficient, such as some of the B vitamins and vitamin E; however, feeding is likely to rapidly replenish these deficiencies if they exist. This is also likely true of amino acid deficiencies, but supplementation of L-carnitine (250 mg/day PO) may be beneficial by improving fatty acid oxidation. 10 Finally, hepatoprotectant and antioxidant therapy with S-adenosylmethionine (SAMe) (20 mg/kg PO q24h) has been advocated to increase glutathione and may be beneficial in cats with hepatic lipidosis. 13, 19, 56 It is important to note that if SAMe is given through the tube (and thus the tablets must be crushed), the dose must be increased by approximately 50% to allow for the loss of absorption from loss of the enteric coating. Because drug metabolism is often impaired in cats with hepatic lipidosis, appetite stimulants, such as mirtazapine, cyproheptadine, and clonazepam, should not be used in cats because dosing and side effects can be unpredictable. Benzodiazepine agonist drugs (e.g., diazepam) should be completely avoided in cats with possible lipidosis-induced hepatoencephalopathy, because they will exacerbate the signs and may cause fulminant liver failure. 2, 14 Fortunately, most cats with idiopathic hepatic lipidosis that receive immediate and aggressive therapy and feeding for their disease will recover completely. Cats that develop hepatic lipidosis secondary to other serious diseases (e.g., lymphoma) have a much lower chance of complete recovery and often die of their disease or its complications.",

In cats with chronic lymphoplasmacytic forms of cholangitis, management must be tailored to the individual situation and often requires therapy with either immunosuppressive doses of prednisolone (2 to 4 mg/kg PO q24h) or chlorambucil (4 mg/m 2 PO q2d), along with the hepatoprotectants and cholerectics, and concurrent treatment of other diseases (pancreatitis or IBD) that may be occurring. 52 The lymphocytic or lymphoplasmacytic forms of cholangitis may wax and wane in intensity over time, and may require long-term continuous or intermittent therapy to control the disease. There is no specific diet that is recommended for cats with inflammatory liver disease, but protein restriction should not be initiated unless the cat has clear evidence of severe hepatoencephalopathy. The diet should be selected based on other conditions (such as IBD), for which the diet may be more critical in the management. Monitoring of serum chemistry values (especially glucose), clotting times, cobalamin levels, and PLI/TLI concentrations are recommended every few months, as well as careful monitoring of the CBC for all cats on chlorambucil. In all cats with chronic inflammatory liver disease, prior to initiation of immunosuppressive therapy, a careful assessment of the cat for other possible causes of inflammation should be completed (Box 23-6).",

The abdominal effusion found with FIP is typically straw to golden yellow (although the color can be very variable, for example, chyle may be present), may contain fibrin clots, and has a high protein concentration. The total protein content is greater than 35 g/L and often greater than 45 g/L, with globulins comprising 50% or more. 31 One study described an effusion with total protein greater than 80 g/L as 90% specific, 55% sensitive, and having a 0.78 positive predictive value to diagnose FIP. 31 The Rivalta test evaluates the fluid's globulin content, and was found to be very sensitive but only 80% specific; this test is performed by adding one drop of acetic acid (98%) to 5 mL of distilled water. This fluid is mixed thoroughly, and then one drop of effusion is gently placed on the surface of the mixture. If the drop stays at the top of the fluid or slowly floats to the bottom, the test is considered to be positive. This test can give inaccurate results if inappropriate technique is used or if there is a significant temperature difference between the fluid sample and the acetic acid solution. A positive Rivalta test can result from lymphosarcoma, septic, or FIP effusions; these can be distinguished by cytology and culture.",

Carcinomas, mesotheliomas, and discrete (round) cell neoplasms (e.g., lymphoma, mast cell tumors, malignant histiocytosis) exfoliate cells into effusions more readily than sarcomas, and of these, lymphosarcoma is the most common malignancy of cats. Cytology of ascitic fluid reveals neoplastic cells in less than a quarter of cases; so the absence of such cells does not rule out a diagnosis of neoplasia.

Gastrointestinal tract leakage may occur as a result of ulceration associated with neoplasia or inflammatory disease or as a result of penetration of a sharp object ingested (such as a toothpick), it can also occur subsequent to prior abdominal surgery. 7, 9, 17, 24 Primary septic peritonitis in which no apparent cause can be identified has also been described in cats. 26 Septic exudates are usually yellow to tan in color, with yellow particulate matter and are foul-smelling. Microscopically, the fluid is characterized by the presence of degenerate neutrophils and bacteria. Bacteria are often seen intracellularly within neutrophils. The condition is associated with high morbidity and mortality rates, with survival rates reported between 32% and 80%. 7, 9, 17, 24, 26 The history and clinical signs are often vague and nonspecific but can include abdominal pain, vomiting, lethargy/depression, and anorexia. Abdominal pain is an inconsistent finding, being recognized in only 62% of cats in one study 7 and 43% in another. 24 Some cats may have an inappropriately low heart rate. 7, 26 Hematologic and serum biochemistry findings are also inconsistent; neutrophilia with a left shift may be present, as may neutropenia or a normal neutrophil count. Similarly, cats may be hypoglycemic, hyperglycemic, or normoglycemic, and they may be hypoalbuminemic. 7, 24, 26 One study recognized ionized hypocalcemia in 89% of cats with septic peritonitis at the time of diagnosis, 17 and another suggested hyperlactatemia, when present, may be associated with a poorer prognosis. 24 Radiographic findings are usually typical of ascites of any cause, but presence of pneumoperitoneum in a cat that has not undergone recent surgery may suggest the presence of gas-forming bacteria or rupture of an abdominal viscus and warrants immediate surgical intervention. Ultrasonography does not directly aid the diagnosis of septic peritonitis. 7 Exploratory laparotomy to determine and correct an underlying problem, such as full-thickness gastrointestinal perforation (often requiring partial resection) is required, as is copious abdominal lavage with sterile, warmed fluids ( Figure 23-73 ). There are no statistically significant survival differences between postsurgical primary closure, open peritoneal drainage, or closed suction drainage postsurgical lavage; however, a trend toward a higher survival rate has been seen in cats treated with primary closure. 24, 26 Treatment also involves antibiotics, initially parenterally, based on culture and sensitivity findings. Consistent with intestinal contents, most bacteria recognized are gram-negative aerobes, such as E. coli or Enterobacter spp., but mixed infections are usually found. 7, 24 Anaerobes seem more common in cats with primary septic peritonitis, 26 which perhaps suggests these cases may result from healed over-bite wounds into the abdomen. Amoxicillin/ clavulanate would be an appropriate empirical choice of FIGURE 23-73 Fulminant peritonitis associated with gastrointestinal perforation. In this case, the effusion volume was low but the high degree of serosal inflammation is evident. antibiotics while awaiting sensitivity results. There are no definitive guidelines for duration of antibiotic treatment; the author uses extended treatment courses of 4 to 6 weeks. Supportive care with intravenous fluids to maintain fluid and electrolyte balances is also required perioperatively.",

Since repair of or removal of the gall bladder and abdominal lavage are required, exploratory laparotomy is an appropriate means to diagnose this condition. Management should be considered as for septic peritonitis of other causes.",

Cats with ruptured bladders may still have a palpable bladder and the ability to urinate. Common historical complaints are anuria (53.8%) and vomiting (50%). Azotemia is a common finding, and hyperkalemia is seen in around 50% of cases. Drainage of urine from the peritoneal cavity seems to improve patient stabilization. Morbidity and mortality depended largely on the severity of associated injuries. 1 Regardless of the site of injury or the cause of uroabdomen, the first goal of treatment is patient stabilization. Isotonic replacement fluids are used for initial resuscitation. Treatment of hypovolemic shock, if present, is the first order of fluid therapy. After fluid resuscitation, drainage of urine from the abdomen should be established. Continuous passive drainage of the urine is necessary for stabilization and allows effective diuresis to occur. Indwelling catheterization of the urinary bladder is recommended to keep the bladder decompressed and reduce urine flow into the abdominal cavity in patients with bladder and proximal urethral injury. If the urethra is traumatized and a catheter cannot be placed, prepubic tube cystostomy may be necessary to achieve temporary urinary diversion. The decision to treat the uroabdomen patient surgically or conservatively should be based on the location and severity of the underlying injury, the condition of the patient at presentation, and the patient's response to initial stabilization. 1, 12 ",

In contrast, ultrasonography is a very useful modality to assess intestinal wall thickening and to distinguish the five layers of the intestinal wall. Abdominal masses can be assessed to determine if they are focal, mural intestinal thickening, or lymph nodes (or of other origin). All intraabdominal organs should be assessed to determine if there is multiorgan disease (even if not indicated by biochemistry results). Despite its utility, it must be recognized that a diagnosis cannot be reached by ultrasonography alone. Fineneedle aspiration (or Tru-Cut biopsy) of discrete masses is required, and if no masses are present, biopsy samples are required, using either endoscopy, laparotomy, or laparoscopy.Ultrasonography can be considered as a means to \"survey the field,\" assessing \u2022 The nature of the underlying disease, such as \u2022 Thickened intestines with or without discrete layers \u2022 Lymph node involvement \u2022 Other organ involvement \u2022 Location of disease, for example,\u2022 Diffuse or focal \u2022 Proximal duodenum (reachable by endoscope) versus distal ileum These factors may be used to assess the appropriateness of endoscopy versus laparotomy to obtain diagnostic samples.",
