Results: Of the 331 patients enrolled, only 225 met diagnostic criteria for IA as determined by the independent panel and received at least one dose of micafungin. Patients included 98/225 who had undergone hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) (88/98 allogeneic), 48 with graft versus host disease (GVHD), and 83/ 225 who had received chemotherapy for hematologic malignancy. A favorable response rate at the end of therapy was seen in 35.6% (80/225) of patients. Of those only treated with micafungin, favorable responses were seen in 6/12 (50%) of the primary and 9/22 (40.9%) of the salvage therapy group, with corresponding numbers in the combination treatment groups of 5/17 (29.4%) and 60/174 (34.5%) of the primary and salvage treatment groups, respectively. Of the 326 micafungin-treated patients, 183 (56.1%) died during therapy or in the 6-week follow-up phase; 107 (58.5%) deaths were attributable to IA. Conclusions: Micafungin as primary or salvage therapy proved efficacious and safe in high-risk patients with IA, although patient numbers are small in the micafunginonly groups.",

This study evaluated the safety and efficacy of micafungin in patients with proven or probable invasive aspergillosis (IA). Methods: A multinational, non-comparative study was conducted to examine proven or probable (pulmonary only) Aspergillus species infection in a wide variety of patient populations.

The frequency of IA varies substantially from one risk group to another and by locality, but is perhaps most influenced by the diagnostic approach taken in any given unit. Recent examples of incidence in high-risk groups include acute myeloid leukemia (8%), 1 acute lymphocytic leukemia (6.3%), 1 autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) (1.5%), 2 allogeneic stem cell transplantation after non-myeloablative conditioning (11%), 3, 4 allogeneic HSCT after myeloablative conditioning (15%; 11%), 5,6 lung transplantation (6.2%; 12.8%), 7, 8 hearte lung and small bowel transplantation (11%), 1 liver transplantation (3%), 9 and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) (2.1%). 10 Increasingly, recognized risk groups include medical intensive care unit patients, 11, 12 those with chronic pulmonary disease treated with corticosteroids, 13, 14 those receiving anti-tumor necrosis factor monoclonal antibody therapy (such as infliximab), 15 and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). 16 Mortality due to IA is high. 17e19 A review of 1223 cases reported crude mortality rates of 86%, 66%, and 99% for pulmonary, sinus, and cerebral aspergillosis, respectively, 17 with only occasional reports of improvement seen since, despite the introduction of new agents in the last 10 years.",

            "text": "Micafungin (FK463) is a new lipopeptide compound (echinocandin) synthesized through the chemical modification of a product from Coleophoma empetri. 20, 21 Its antifungal activity resides at the cell wall as it inhibits the synthesis of (1,3)-beta-D-glucan. Pre-clinical studies indicate that micafungin has fungicidal activity against almost all Candida species, including azole-resistant Candida albicans, and kills the growing tips of Aspergillus species, like other echinocandins. The median minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values for Aspergillus species (including Aspergillus fumigatus, Aspergillus flavus, Aspergillus niger, and Aspergillus terreus) were substantially lower than those of other non-echinocandins tested (ie, 0.0078 mg/mL compared with 0.5e 2 mg/mL for amphotericin B), indicating the potential for greater clinical activity than itraconazole and amphotericin B in the same clinical isolates. 21 In murine models of IA (both A. fumigatus and A. terreus) micafungin was highly effective in preventing mortality (and superior to liposomal amphotericin B against an A. terreus infection), although cultures tend to remain positive in tissues. 22e25 A dose response from 1 mg/kg to 5 mg/ kg was observed. 24 Micafungin has also been shown to confer synergistic activity to amphotericin B in vitro 26 and in murine aspergillosis models. 27e29 Initial studies in male volunteers, adult HSCT recipients, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) patients indicated that micafungin was well tolerated over a wide range of doses. 30 The objective of the current study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of micafungin, when administered alone or in combination with other systemic antifungal agents, in patients with proven or probable invasive infections due to Aspergillus species.",

Rarity of the disease usually hinders rapid patient accrual in this therapeutic area but, in fact, 331 patients were enrolled in less than 4 years in 62 centers. As a result, efficacy and safety information on a wide variety of Aspergillus species infections and patient populations was obtained. Although a previous trial with caspofungin, which enrolled 90 patients, has already been published, 34 this paper describes the largest therapeutic study to date of IA treated with an echinocandin. In the independent review, 80 of 225 patients (35.6%) in the mFAS demonstrated a complete or partial response to micafungin, comparable to the modified intent-to-treat result seen with caspofungin (44.6%). 34 There is no consensus on the enrollment criteria for clinical failure (salvage) in acute IA. For instance, how many days of primary therapy are necessary before primary therapy can be considered a failure? Also, the variety of at-risk populations and extent of disease at presentation, including extrapulmonary dissemination in some, make a uniform definition suspect. Some patients have very extensive pulmonary infection at diagnosis, which is usually fatal, and so any worsening of disease is synonymous with death. Indeed in all prospective studies of acute IA, including this study, early deaths are a constant feature. Other patients have limited single or multifocal disease that typically responds well to treatment, even if enlarging in volume before shrinking. 35 In fact, most rapidly progressive pulmonary lesions do enlarge in the first few days of antifungal therapy, 35 making a realistic early determination of response difficult. Likewise, fever and other clinical signs often take several days before starting to resolve. In the present study, patients had to have had at least 3 days of antifungal therapy before enrollment. Most patients, however, were heavily pretreated. For example, the 148 patients in receipt of a lipid amphotericin B had actually received a mean of 23 days therapy at a mean dose of 6.09 mg/kg immediately prior to enrollment. Because of the heterogeneity of previous therapy, the extent and progressive nature of disease, and different underlying poor prognostic factors, a planned independent review placed patients into different categories to facilitate comparison with other studies.",

Secondary arguments include increasing the antifungal spectrum in empiric therapy to encompass more pathogens including resistant fungi; realizing better pharmacodynamic parameters of one agent over another for certain body sites; preventing the development of resistance; and (possibly) being able to use reduced doses of one or both drugs without loss of activity while minimizing toxicity. During the time in which this study was performed, physicians were only likely to use combination therapy for very ill patients with a high mortality probability. That is probably what happened in this trial, as it was a physician's choice to add or substitute micafungin for refractory cases. Of the 202 amphotericin B-treated patients (36 amphotericin B deoxycholate \u00fe 166 lipid-associated amphotericin) treated with the combination of micafungin and an amphotericin preparation, 75 (37.2%) responded.",

This initial dose of micafungin was partially effective regardless of patient group (primary versus efficacy failure/toxicity failure) or site/species of infection. Increasing the dose of micafungin was apparently effective in achieving therapeutic responses in a number of patients. For those patients who had a dose increase, favorable responses were seen in 38.8% (50/129), including both primary and efficacy failure patients at mean daily doses exceeding 200 mg per day without significant toxicity. Micafungin has proven efficacy in the treatment of esophageal candidiasis 31,50e52 and candidemia, 33, 53, 54 and in the prophylaxis of candidemia in patients undergoing HSCT. 55 This study demonstrated that micafungin, primarily in combination with amphotericin B, is efficacious in the treatment of acute IA in adult and pediatric patients who had failed to respond to prior therapy, or in patients who were unable to tolerate alternative therapy. Micafungin, alone and in combination with amphotericin B, was generally well tolerated. These results suggest that micafungin, either alone or in combination, is a viable option in the treatment of invasive aspergillosis. Randomized trials will be necessary to determine if combination therapy adds therapeutic benefit to one drug alone.",
