CypA suppresses T-cell activation through cyclosporine complexation and is required for effective HIV-1 replication in host cells. We show that CypA is acetylated in diverse human cell lines and use a synthetically evolved acetyllysyl-tRNA synthetase/tRNA CUA pair to produce recombinant acetylated CypA in Escherichia coli. We determined atomic-resolution structures of acetylated CypA and its complexes with cyclosporine and HIV-1 capsid. Acetylation markedly inhibited CypA catalysis of cis to trans isomerization and stabilized cis rather than trans forms of the HIV-1 capsid. Furthermore, CypA acetylation antagonized the immunosuppressive effects of cyclosporine by inhibiting the sequential steps of cyclosporine binding and calcineurin inhibition. Our results reveal that acetylation regulates key functions of CypA in immunity and viral infection and provide a general set of mechanisms by which acetylation modulates interactions to regulate cell function.",

            "text": "C yclophilins, also known as immunophilins, are peptidylprolyl cis-trans isomerases found in all kingdoms of life and all tissues. Cyclophilin A (CypA), the archetypal cyclophilin, is central to protein folding 1 , signal transduction 2 , trafficking 3 , receptor assembly 4 , cell cycle regulation 5 and stress response and has an expanding catalog of roles 6 . Two of CypA's most important roles in human health are in controlling immunosuppression and viral infection. CypA is the target of the widely used immunosuppressive cyclosporine (1) . The complex formed by CypA and cyclosporine binds to and allosterically inhibits calcineurin, a protein phosphatase, leading to suppression of the T-cell mediated immune response by means of an IL-2-mediated downregulation of T-cell activation 7 . CypA is also an essential host protein in the efficient replication of several viruses, including vesicular stomatitis virus 5 , severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus 6 , hepatitis C virus (HCV) 8 , vaccinia virus and HIV type 1 (refs. 9,10) . During HIV-1 infection, CypA interacts with the capsid protein gag and is packaged into budding HIV-1 virions 9, 10 . Inhibition of CypA by cyclosporine substantially decreases viral titer in human cells 11 . The importance of CypA in lentiviral replication is underscored by the independent evolution in two different primate species of antiviral restriction factors that use a retrotransposed copy of CypA to provide viral targeting 12 . Despite the importance of CypA in immunosuppression, viral infection and other key cellular processes, the molecular mechanisms by which the varied and crucial functions of CypA are regulated remains unclear.",

However, because there are many CypA gene fusions in the genome, the origin of this peptide was ambiguous. Here we show that the free enzyme form of CypA is acetylated in human cells. We produced homogeneously and site-specifically acetylated recombinant CypA using an acetyllysyl-tRNA synthetase/tRNA CUA pair that co-translationally directs the incorporation of acetyllysine in response to an amber codon 18 placed in a CypA gene. This approach allowed us to perform structural and biophysical measurements on acetylated CypA for the first time. These results reveal how acetylation modulates key functions of CypA, including suppressing its catalytic activity, cyclosporine binding and calcineurin inhibition and altering its recognition of the HIV-1 capsid. Furthermore, the molecular details of these effects establish a general set of mechanisms by which acetylation can regulate protein activity.",

Under mildly acidic conditions, acetylated CypA was still soluble at concentrations around 3 mM.

In both CypA structures there is clear density for the acetyllysine side chain, as evidenced by the omit maps (Fig. 2a,b) . This further demonstrates the homogeneity of acetyllysine incorporation and shows that the acetyllysine has a well-defined conformation.

Comparison of the active sites reveals differences in only three residues: Phe60, Arg55 and Lys125. The Phe60 side chain of trigonal chain A is rotated 90\u00b0 compared to the other structures. This is due to crystal contacts between Phe60 and its symmetryrelated copy. Phe60, together with Met61 and Phe113, form a hydrophobic core at the base of the substrate binding pocket. Arg55 is a key catalytic residue, facilitating catalysis through stabilization of the proline in the transition state 20 . Differences in the side chain orientation of Arg55 in the acetylated and unacetylated structures are likely to result from the inherent flexibility required in this region to accommodate diverse CypA substrates. Acetylation of CypA does not therefore seem to distort its conformation or substantially rearrange the active site. However, acetylation does markedly affect its surface electrostatics. Calculation of the surface electrostatic potential using the Adaptive Poisson-Boltzmann Solver (APBS) shows that Lys125 provides the strongest patch of positive charge in the active site (Fig. 2e,f) and that this charge is largely neutralized by the acetyl group. Such a marked shift in electrostatics correlates with our observation that acetylation switches CypA from requiring a basic to an acidic environment.",

In the unacetylated complex, Lys125 mediates a shell of waters at the interface between CypA and cyclosporine (Fig. 3c) .

To examine the effect of acetylation on the ability of the CypA-cyclosporine complex to inhibit calcineurin, we assayed the calcineurin-mediated release of phosphate from the RII-phosphopeptide 22 as a function of concentration of CypA-cyclosporine. When cyclosporine was in excess and equal amounts of CypA-cyclosporine were formed with the acetylated and unacetylated cyclophilin, we found an inhibition constant (K i ) for the unacetylated complex of 497 nM, which is similar to the inhibition constants previously measured for this interaction 22 . Acetylation reduced inhibition of calcineurin by twofold, to 972 nM (Supplementary Fig. 6 ). The potency of cyclosporine immunosuppression is determined by the affinity of cyclosporine for CypA and the efficiency with which the CypA-cyclosporine complex inhibits calcineurin. As we found that acetylated CypA bound cyclosporine 20-fold more weakly than the unacetylated CypA, and as the acetylated CypA-cyclosporine complex mediates a twofold decrease in calcineurin inhibition, the total effect of acetylation on CypA-mediated immunosuppression may be multiplicatively larger than either of these individual effects. However, the potent immunosuppression mediated by cyclosporine in humans suggests that the acetylation levels in T cells in vivo or acetylation itself is not sufficient to completely abolish calcineurin inhibition in these cells.",

Previous studies have used steady-state methods to determine the k cat /K M of CypA isomerization; however, this results in loss of data during mixing of the reaction components. Moreover, this approach cannot differentiate the two kinetic events and therefore does not take into account any contribution of the fast cleavage of trans peptide to the apparent rate of isomerization. We used a stopped-flow spectrophotometer, which allows pre-steady state measurement (owing to rapid mixing, <1 ms) and the resolution of separate kinetic events. Using the stopped-flow method, we observed two discrete phases in 4-nitroaniline production, corresponding to a fast cleavage step and a slower isomerization step (Fig. 4a) . The molecular processes underpinning the fast and slow steps are confirmed by their relative amplitudes, which correspond closely to the expected cis-trans distribution of the substrate such that the slower, isomerization step represents ~10% of the total amplitude change. By fitting each experiment to a double exponential, we obtained an accurate measurement of the apparent rate of cis to trans isomerization at different CypA concentrations. We then calculated the k cat /K M by fitting the increase in apparent rate (k obs ) with increasing CypA concentrations to k obs = (k cat /K M ) [CypA] . Comparison of CypA to acetylated CypA showed that acetylation decreased k cat /K M by 35-fold from 1 \u00d7 10 7 M \u22121 s \u22121 to 3 \u00d7 10 5 M \u22121 s \u22121 (Fig. 4b) .",

The main difference between the two structures was that whereas both copies of the capsid in the unacetylated structure were bound with their Gly89-Pro90 peptide bond in a trans conformation, both copies in the acetylated structure were bound with this bond in a cis conformation (Fig. 5b,c) . This change in HIV-1 capsid binding from trans to cis is a direct result of acetylation of Lys125. In the unacetylated complex, the trans Gly89 peptide oxygen is orientated toward the positive electrostatic patch provided by Lys125 and His126; in the acetylated complex, the oxygen is orientated away.",

Enzymatic characterization showed that acetylation inhibited isomerization and reduced k cat /K M by 35-fold (Fig. 4) . Altered HIV-1 binding-namely, the switch from trans to cis proline in the HIV-1 complex-is consistent with this reduced k cat /K M , which is a measure of cis to trans isomerization. In addition to switching cis/trans preference through charge neutralization, the acetyllysine also stabilized the cis conformation of HIV-1 capsid by making new hydrogen bond and hydrophobic interactions. The methyl group of the acetyl moiety formed a new hydrophobic interaction with an alternative side chain conformer of Ile91. This interaction resulted in mainchain changes that were propagated to C-terminal residues Ala92 and Pro93, altering their interactions in turn. In the unacetylated complex, Pro93 forms a hydrophobic stacking interaction with CypA residue Trp121. The rearrangement in the position of Pro93 caused by acetylation led to an alternative stacking interaction with the aromatic ring of conserved CypA residue Phe60. Finally, the acetyllysine mediated a new water network involving the side chain of highly conserved His126, the main-chain amide of Ile91 and two water molecules (Fig. 5b) . Acetylated CypA therefore stabilizes the HIV-1 capsid in its cis form by engaging residues C-terminal to the isomerized Pro90 in a different conformation. This correlates with the proposed catalytic pathway for nitroanilide peptide substrates, in which the position of residues C-terminal to the isomerized proline alters according to whether the peptide binds in cis or trans 28 .

We have solved to our knowledge the first high-resolution crystal structures of an acetylated protein, both in its free form and in complex with small molecules and protein ligands. These structures and accompanying biochemical and biophysical studies reveal that CypA acetylation antagonizes sequential binding and catalytic activities in the pathway that regulates the immunosuppressive effects of cyclosporine, decreases the catalytic efficiency of CypA cis to trans isomerization 35-fold and switches the binding of CypA from trans to cis HIV-1 capsid. Acetylation represents a previously unexamined aspect of CypA biology. Identifying the acetyltransferases and deacetylases that modulate CypA acetylation levels will be important in exploring how CypA acetylation modulates function in response to stimuli such as immune stimulation. CypA is widely expressed, yet different tissues show different CypA phenotypes. For instance, cyclosporine and its derivatives are potent inhibitors and widely used immunosuppressives, but their off-target effects are limited. A study on calcineurin inhibition by cyclosporine in different tissues found wide variation in potency that was not always explicable by variation in CypA levels 29 . Furthermore, HIV-1 interaction with CypA in different cell lines and different species gives rise to diverse and unpredictable phenotypes 30, 31 . Differences in acetylation levels in different tissues may underpin some of this variation.",

However, in the case of HIV-1 binding (and in contrast to cyclosporine binding), acetylation also mediates changes in the orientation of key interaction residues, generating new interactions and abolishing interactions present in the unacetylated complex. Disassembly of the viral capsid is an essential step in HIV-1 infection and may be catalyzed by CypA isomerization of the Gly89-Pro90 peptide bond 26 . By reducing CypA activity, as indicated both by the enzyme kinetics and the altered substrate binding in the complexed structure, acetylation may interfere with this process and reduce viral infectivity. In addition to HIV-1, HCV has also been shown to require CypA for efficient replication 8 . As CypA inhibitors represent potential anti-HCV drugs 32 , it will be interesting to see whether acetylation affects the role of CypA in HCV replication. Finally, CypA is part of a larger CypA family, including proteins such as CypB that are almost identical in sequence and yet have discrete specificities 33 . Post-translational modification of CypA but not CypB may help differentiate their function. Acetylation may inhibit binding to some substrates but allow CypA to isomerize new ones.",

Enzymatic modification with histone acetyltransferases is generally nonquantitative 35 and leads to heterogeneity in the site and extent of acetylation. These methods of acetylation lead to inhomogeneous samples that are unsuitable for quantitative biophysical studies or structural biology. Our experiments demonstrate that homogeneously and site-specifically acetylated proteins that are suitable for structural studies and quantitative measurements can be made in excellent yield using an acetyllysyl-tRNA synthetase/tRNA CUA pair 18 .

Water w1 is conserved in the two complexes. Superscript H and C indicate HIv residues and Cyp residues, respectively. article NATURE CHEmICAL bIOLOgy dOI: 10.1038/nCHeMBIO.342",

For inhibition experiments see Supplementary Methods.Fluorescence equilibrium titration measurements. All experiments were performed using a Perkin Elmer LS55 fluorimeter at 20 \u00b0C in buffer A. The interaction of cyclosporine and CypA was followed by measuring the intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence of W121 (\u03bb excitation = 280 nm, \u03bb emission = 338 nm). Cyclosporine was added stepwise (final concentrations, 1-240 nM) to 10-50 nM CypA or CypAAcK, rapidly mixed and the fluorescence intensity measured. The final intensity at each titration point was calculated from the average of 20 measurements at equilibrium. The relative fluorescence-intensity was plotted as a function of cyclosporine concentration and the obtained curve was analyzed by fitting a quadratic function to the data. For data analysis, we used Grafit 3.0-5.0. Final K D values were calculated from the mean of at least two independent titration experiments. and structure determination. For details of crystallization conditions see Supplementary Methods. All crystals were obtained using sitting drop for initial screens and the hanging drop/vapor diffusion method for optimization. Crystals were flash frozen in liquid nitrogen using the cryoprotectants described above. Data collection was performed at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility in Grenoble, France at beamline ID29. For data analysis see Supplementary Methods and SupplementaryTable 2.",
