High rates of worker absenteeism can interrupt other essential services, such as law enforcement, transportation and communications, and impede business continuity and economic productivity. Experiences during the 2003 outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) suggest that the associated social and economic disruptions will be amplified in this century's closely interrelated and interdependent system of trade and commerce. 2 Although neither the timing nor the severity of the next influenza pandemic can be predicted with any certainty, we know that the most reliable, predictable and expedient way to improve the defenses against pandemic influenza is to build on existing structures and mechanisms that have worked well in recent public health emergencies. This is the primary focus of a facility-level pandemic plan.",

For the actual response, the internationally recognized Incident Management System (IMS) is an optimal structure to facilitate a well-coordinated response to pandemic or other emergencies. The IMS is a North American standard, essential for management of any emergency incidents. In the United States and Canada, IMS is used extensively in the fire service and increasingly by police and emergency medical services. Many hospitals and other health care providers are starting to implement IMS within their organizations. The IMS structure is built around five functions: command, operations, planning, logistics and administration.",

Our next step was to ensure that the committee members had a comprehensive understanding of the pandemic influenza phenomenon.

The goals of this table-top simulation exercise were to test plans and identify gaps. Two external facilitators with extensive experience in emergency exercise design were hired to assist with the process. Meetings were held with the facilitators to familiarize them with both the organization and the facility's influenza pandemic plan, and finalize the script for the simulation.
