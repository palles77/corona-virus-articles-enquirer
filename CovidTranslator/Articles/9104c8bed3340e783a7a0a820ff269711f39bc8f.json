Because of mild fibrosis for which the possibility of interstitial lung diseases on CT could not be ruled out, he had been receiving chemotherapy without radiation therapy since the diagnosis of adenocarcinoma. Since September 2013, he had undergone chemotherapy with cisplatin plus pemetrexed followed by maintenance chemotherapy with pemetrexed and docetaxel. In May 2017, because the contralateral mediastinal lymph node was enlarged, recurrence was diagnosed, and nivolumab was started biweekly. The swollen lymph nodes decreased in size, and no abnormal shadows were noted, so he was considered to be in complete remission. In November 2017, decreased FT3 and FT4 values and an elevated thyroid-stimulating hormone value indicating hypothyroidism were found, but there were no clinical symptoms, and we followed him without treatment. In July 2018, he developed general fatigue, and we considered the symptoms due to hypothyroidism and stopped the nivolumab. By August 2018, his general fatigue had improved, and we restarted the nivolumab. However, in September 2018, 4 days after the 29th administration of nivolumab, he developed back pain, chest discomfort, general fatigue, and dyspnea. His vital signs were as follows: blood pressure of 92/62 mmHg, heart rate of 85 beats/min, and respiratory rate of 20/min. Chest auscultation revealed an irregular heartbeat without murmurs or rales. Pitting edema was found in his lower extremities. The electrocardiogram showed wide QRS waves (Fig. 1A) . A transthoracic cardiac ultrasound examination showed an attenuated left ventricular ejection fraction of 45% compared with that of 70% in February 2014 and a decrease in the left ventricular wall motion in the posterior, inferior, and lateral walls. Laboratory data showed white blood cells of 6,200/mm 3 , hemoglobin of 13.1 g/dL, platelets of 205,000/mm 3 , serum creatine kinase value of 970 IU/ L (normal 56 to 244), and increases in creatine kinasemyocardial band to 78 ng/mL (normal <5 ng/mL) and cardiac troponin T to 4.81 ng/mL (normal <0.1 ng/mL). The Creactive protein value was also increased to 2.06 mg/dL. Autoantibodies, including antinuclear antibodies, anti-Acl-70 antibodies, anti-ARS antibodies, anti-ds DNA antibodies, anti-RNP antibodies, anti-SS-A/Ro, and anti-SS-B/La antibodies, were all negative. BNP was increased to 466 pg/mL, and chest X-ray showed cardiac enlargement with rightsided pleural effusion (Fig. 1B) .",

            "text": "As an ICI, nivolumab is a novel remedy for malignant tumors that promotes the attack of cancer cells by lymphocytes by suppressing the expression of PD-1 on the cell surface of cancer cells. Nivolumab has transformed the treatment of several cancers by releasing restrained antitumor immune responses (14) . Treatment with nivolumab is known to cause several ir-AEs, including thyroid dysfunction, colitis, pneumonitis, and rarely, type 1 diabetes, Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, and myasthenia gravis. However, the frequency of myocarditis is 0.06% (8), whereas the frequencies of myocarditis due to other ICIs, such as pembrolizumab and atezolizumab, in Japan are reported to be 3 in 4,259 patients (0.07%) (15) and 2 in 2,800 patients (0.07%) (16), respectively. Although its probability of occurrence is not high, myocarditis is an ir-AE that cannot be ignored due to the possibility of a fatal outcome. To our knowledge, only 13 cases of myocarditis induced by nivolumab have been reported (Table) . Among these 13 cases, the patients' ages ranged from 49 to 80 years, and 9 men were included. Malignancies for which nivolumab was administered included melanoma in eight cases, lung cancer in four cases, and glioblastoma in one case. Development of nivolumabinduced myocarditis occurred after the initial administration of nivolumab in five cases, after the second administration in three cases, after the third administration in three cases, after the ninth administration in one case, and after the tenth administration in one case. Our patient developed myocarditis one year after the initiation of nivolumab but during the third readministration after a two-month period of drug cessation due to hypothyroidism. As our case indicates, nivolumab-induced myocarditis can develop even one year after its administration. Thus, clinicians should consider nivolumab as a cause of myocarditis even if one year has passed from its introduction.",

All patients had myocardial tissue fibrosis, inflammatory cell infiltration, and T cell-dominant lymphocyte infiltration, findings that were also found in our patient. From previous reports, the characteristic histological finding of nivolumab-induced myocarditis is T-cell inflammation. Four potential mechanisms of ir-AE have been proposed (17) . First, ICIs (monoclonal antibodies) binding directly to cell surface proteins, such as cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA4), which is expressed on normal tissues, can cause T-cell infiltration and injury to tissues due to complement mediation. Second, circulating T cells that rec-ognize antigens expressed by tumor cells can identify either the same tumor antigen or a homologous tissue antigen in healthy tissue. ICI therapy that inhibits programmed cell death protein 1 or CTLA4 can stimulate recognition of or binding of T cells to antigens expressed by non-target organs. Third, there is some evidence to suggest that inhibiting immune checkpoint molecules can increase circulating cytokine levels in affected tissues, thus helping inflammatory molecules infiltrate non-target tissues. Fourth, antibodies administered against ICIs may increase autoantibody levels against target organs or stimulate new autoantibody formation.",

The further accumulation of CMR findings of nivolumab-induced myocarditis is needed in order to better determine the characteristic findings of such cases. However, CMR was useful in our case for ruling out viral myocarditis as a cause because viral myocarditis usually affects the epicardium, as reflected by its hematogenous spread (18) , whereas our patient showed a diffuse myocardial distribution. CMR may be useful for differentiating viral myocarditis from other disease entities.",

In our patient, in addition to heart failure, complete atrioventricular block developed, and it was necessary to administer a steroid. Among the 13 cases reported so far, none of the patients underwent observation without treatment. The recently published clinical practice guidelines state that all ICI patients complicated with myocarditis should be treated with corticosteroids regardless, of the grade of cardiac toxicities (19) . The therapeutic options in the 13 reported cases include prednisolone in 5, methylprednisolone in 4, mycophenolate mofetil in 1, methylprednisolone and infliximab in 1, methylprednisolone and intravenous anti-thymus immunoglobulin in 1, and no mention of therapy in 1 case. Corticosteroid therapy seems effective in most cases, but deaths in patients treated with steroid therapy have also been reported (3). One patient with recurrence of myocarditis after nivolumab readministration eventually died; we therefore consider that nivolumab should not be readministered in such cases (5) .",
