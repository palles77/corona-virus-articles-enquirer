During PRRSV infection one of the most abundant viral proteins produced within the cell is the nucleocapsid (N) protein. This protein Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) is a major threat to the swine industry and food security worldwide. The nucleocapsid (N) protein is a major structural protein of PRRSV. The primary function of this protein is to encapsidate the viral RNA genome, and it is also thought to participate in the modulation of host cell biology and recruitment of cellular factors to facilitate virus infection. In order to the better understand these latter roles the cellular interactome of PRRSV N protein was defined using label free quantitative proteomics. This identified several cellular factors that could interact with the N protein including poly [ADP-ribose] polymerase 1 (PARP-1), a cellular protein, which can add adenosine diphosphate ribose to a protein. Use of the PARP-1 small molecule inhibitor, 3-AB, in PRRSV infected cells demonstrated that PARP-1 was required and acted as an enhancer factor for virus biology. Serial growth of PRRSV in different concentrations of 3-AB did not yield viruses that were able to grow with wild type kinetics, suggesting that by targeting a cellular protein crucial for virus biology, resistant phenotypes did not emerge. This study provides further evidence that cellular proteins, which are critical for virus biology, can also be targeted to ablate virus growth and provide a high barrier for the emergence of drug resistance.",

At a basic level N protein complexes with virus genomic RNA to form the ribonucleocapsid core and as such is an integral component of the enveloped virus particle (Song et al., 2011) . Because the N protein forms a close association with genomic RNA and other virus proteins such as those involved in replication and components of the viral envelope, the protein has been postulate to play an important role in virus RNA synthesis and virion assembly, perhaps in the modulation of these events (Lee et al., 2006) . The interaction of N protein and the host cell has been supported by several studies showing the association of this viral protein with cellular proteins including those involved in nuclear import such as importin-a and importin-b, the nucleolar protein fibrillarin (Yoo et al., 2003) , and inhibitor of MyoD (a protein belonging to myogenic regulatory factors) family-a domain-containing protein (Song et al., 2009) . Interactome analysis of the N protein using over expression and EGFP-trapping coupled to LC-MS/MS revealed further potential interactions including association with proteins involved in translation initiation and RNA post-transcriptional modification, including poly(A) binding protein (PABP), inducible PABP (iPABP), translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) and heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A1 (hnRNPA1) (Jourdan et al., 2012a) . Use of RNA silencing of PABP mRNA and ablation of the protein in PRRSV infected cells highlighted a positive role for this protein in infection and demonstrated that host cell proteins are critical for virus biology (Wang et al., 2012) .",

Whilst over-expression analysis coupled to EGFP traps can provide a useful way of determining the interactome of a particular viral (or cellular) protein (Jourdan et al., 2012a; Wu et al., 2012) , over-expression can turn on cellular stress pathways and this may lead to a potential bias in the interactome. To identify potential cellular protein interactions with PRRSV N protein, recombinant expressed and purified protein was therefore used as bait and bound to nickel affinity beads and incubated with HEK293T cellular lysate. Label free proteomics was used to both identify and quantify proteins that associated with the N protein bait and the UBC9 control bait. One hundred and eight proteins were identified by two or more peptides bound to the N protein bait which were also four fold or more abundant than binding with the UBC9 control bait. Eighteen proteins were found to be common between this analysis and a previous analysis using EGFP-N expressed in cells as bait (Jourdan et al., 2012a) , including PABPC4 and PABPC1 as the top hits.",

Use of the PARP-1 inhibitor 3-aminobenzamide (3-AB) in PRRSV infected cells indicated that PARP-1 acted as a positive factor for virus biology, and sequential passage of the virus in the presence of 3-AB did not lead to breakthrough virus.

Confidence in protein identification is routinely achieved with the use of 2 or more peptides. Examination of this ratio for the N interactome dataset ( Fig. 2A) indicated that the modal ratio was approximately Log 2 -1, and work by ourselves and others has previously suggested that the Log 2 -2 cutoff or more represents a working threshold for assigning specific from non-specific interactions that arise due to binding to either the matrix or the single chain EGFP antibody component of the GFP-trap (Trinkle-Mulcahy et al., 2008) . Cellular interacting proteins exhibiting ratios of a conservative value of 4-fold or greater were therefore considered to potentially represent specific interacting partners of the N protein.

The eight most abundant proteins at the time of analysis were recorded as APOA2, RBP4, APOC2, TTR, ALB, APOA2, ORM1 and TMSB4X. However, none of these were part of the 108 cellular proteins associated with the N protein. There was no correlation between binding efficiency and protein abundance in the cell.

Many cellular processes can be targeted transiently without long-term ill effects, and therefore such anti-cellular viral therapy may lend itself to acute rather than persistent infections.

Using a conservative selection criteria, 108 proteins were identified that could potentially interact with the N protein, or be part of larger complexes, which associated with the N protein.

In the present study, the use of 3-AB demonstrated that PARP-1 activity was required for PRRSV biology, and therefore PARP-1 could be considered as positive viral factor. Our data have shown that PRRSV N protein interacts with PARP-1 and inhibition of PARP-1 significantly reduces the production of the viral genomic and subgenomic RNAs, indicating that PARP-1 may be recruited by N protein and benefit for the viral RNA replication and transcription processes. This result is Fig. 7 . 3-AB sensitivity assay based on an assay used to assess the effect of HSP90 inhibitors against HRSV (Geller et al., 2013) . PRRSV was sequentially grown for 15 passages in various concentrations of 3-AB. Marc-145 cells were infected with PRRSV from the final passage or from the original stock for 72 h in the presence of indicated concentrations of 3-AB. Viruses released into the supernatant were titrated by endpoint dilution. Each datum represents the mean TCID50/0.1 ml of !2 experiments. Music and Gagnon, 2010) . b-Actin was also detected by anti-b-actin antibody to normalize the protein amount of cell lysates loaded in lanes (lower panel in A & B). (C) Quantization of PRRSV genomic (Nsp1) and subgenomic (N) RNA in infected Marc-145 cells. Total RNA was extracted at 24hpi and subjected to real-time RT-PCR analysis. Relative levels of N and Nsp1 were calculated using GAPDH as an internal control. Data were shown as means AESD of three independent experiments. One-way ANOVA test was done to compare N and Nsp1 RNA level in 3-AB treated cells with untreated control (*P < 0.05; **P < 0.01). consistent with the report that PARP-1 is a positive factor for the optimal function of viral polymerases in influenza infection, although the precise mechanisms remain to be resolved.",

Here we used a similar strategy that was used to investigate an inhibitor of a cellular protein important for HRSV (Geller et al., 2013) . Whilst we could have increased the concentration of 3-AB from 20 mM to 40 mM for the selection/reversion experiment, this latter concentration may have reduced the number of viral genomes by too much to generate sufficient numbers for selection experiments. Although it is hard to predict how many passages or viral generation times should be tested, it is worth noting that two amino acid substitutions in the N protein that abolish its nuclear localization (NLS) (Pei et al., 2008) , underwent strong selection pressure both in vitro and in vivo that resulted in partial or complete reversion and gain of NLS activity (Pei et al., 2008) .",

In a wider context determining the cellular interactome of viral proteins can be used to identify cellular proteins whose functions can be ablated with small molecule inhibitors to disrupt virus biology. This adds to the general principle that is being established in anti-viral therapy (Baillie and Digard, 2013 ) that targeting cellular proteins may provide an attractive alternative and expand the repertoire of antiviral inhibitors (Xiao et al., 2014; Munday et al., 2014; Garcia-Dorival et al., 2014) .",
