Viral respiratory tract infection (VRTI) has been previously associated with CLAD development. The main purpose of this study was to evaluate the long-term effects of VRTI during the first year after lung transplantation in relation to CLAD development. Method. Ninety-eight patients undergoing lung transplantation were prospectively enrolled between 2009 and 2012. They were monitored for infections with predefined intervals and on extra visits during the first year, the total follow-up period ranged between 5 and 8 years. Nasopharyngeal swab and bronchoalveolar lavage samples were analyzed using a multiplex polymerase chain reaction panel for respiratory pathogens. Data regarding clinical characteristics and infectious events were recorded. Results. Viral respiratory tract infection during the first year was identified as a risk factor for long-term CLAD development (P = 0.041, hazard ratio 1.94 [1.03-3.66]) in a time-dependent multivariate Cox regression analysis. We also found that coronavirus in particular was associated with increased risk for CLAD development. Other identified risk factors were acute rejection and cyclosporine treatment. Conclusions. This study suggests that VRTI during the first year after lung transplantation is associated with longterm CLAD development and that coronavirus infections in particular might be a risk factor.",

This study suggests that VRTI during the first year after lung transplantation is associated with longterm CLAD development and that coronavirus infections in particular might be a risk factor. L ung transplantation (LTx) is the only available therapeutic option for end-stage, nonmalignant lung disease. The yearly number of procedures has increased, but long-term survival has not improved markedly over the years. 1 The main limiting factor for long-term survival is chronic lung allograft dysfunction (CLAD), commonly in the form of bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS). 1 In recent years, restrictive allograft syndrome has also gained recognition. 2 The underlying pathophysiology of CLAD development is multifactorial and infections are a major risk factor. 3 Other risk factors include acute rejection (AR), antibody-mediated rejection, gastroesophageal reflux, and air pollution exposure. 4 The importance of viral respiratory tract infections (VRTI) for CLAD development and graft loss has been highlighted. [5] [6] [7] [8] However, a meta-analysis of 34 articles was unable to establish an association between VRTI and CLAD or graft loss, 9 possibly due to differences in diagnostic methods between the included studies. More recently, the development of multiplex real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) methods has promoted a more sensitive and a standardized detection of respiratory viral agents. 10 We previously showed an association between detection of viral pathogens in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) samples taken during the first year after LTx and the development of BOS. 11 Others have recently reported an increased risk of CLAD after VRTI, 12, 13 but the long-term effects of early VRTI as well as the importance of VRTI compared with other risk factors remain unclear.",

It is indicated that a majority of the samples were BAL samples, and the main detection method was culture-based, which might explain the lower proportion of VRTI-positive subjects (25%) compared with our study (52%) and other prospective studies (51-61%). 7,20-22 Fisher et al 12 published a retrospective study of 250 patients with at least 1-year follow-up, in which tests for VRTI were performed upon clinical suspicion but no surveillance testing was carried out.

Also if a patient is retransplanted, TAC is selected more often (S7 http://links.lww.com/TXD/A117). The high HR for CLAD development associated with CSA treatment is somewhat unexpected, but our study was not designed for comparing the impact of different types of immunosuppression and the result must be interpreted witch caution. We did not find any association between VRTI and time until graft loss; however, the majority of the CLAD population with previous VRTI exposure suffered from a relatively slowly progressing BOS compared with those in the CLAD population with no previous VRTI exposure.

However, the survey bronchoscopies that detected lower VRTI with a simultaneous finding of the same virus in upper airways were performed on asymptomatic patients in 70% of the cases. It is likely that some of the patients with asymptomatic upper VRTI, detected at surveillance sampling without bronchoscopy, also had a lower VRTI thus the true impact of lower VRTI may have been underestimated. A hypothetic mechanism for the graft damage is a disturbed repair mechanism due to decreased regulatory T (Treg) cell activity caused by the immunosuppressive treatment. A function of Treg cells is to suppress proliferation of fibroblasts triggered by cytotoxic T cells (CD8+ T cells) attacking infected respiratory epithelial cells. An absence of Treg cells in immunosuppressed patients might lead to poor control of inflammatory responses and dysregulated epithelial repair mechanisms. 28 Thus, immune response induced by VRTI early after lung transplant might not stop with clearance of the virus and cause epithelial injury and fibroproliferation leading to reduced lung function and CLAD. 29 This study has several limitations. First, the study was designed before the release of the standardization of definitions of infections in cardiothoracic transplant recipients, released by International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation in 2011, 30 which would have been preferable for future reference. Only episodes that resulted in contact with a physician were recorded in the case report form, and no systematically recorded clinical data, except spirometry data, were available from these visits. The study did not evaluate other known risk factors, such as gastroesophageal reflux or environmental pollution exposure after LTx. Furthermore, with respect to the high number of asymptomatic VRTIs, it would have been preferable to keep sampling intervals constant, as increased time between sampling at end of the first year might introduce a bias toward the effect of early infections. More frequent surveillance bronchoscopies to analyze the frequency of asymptomatic lower VRTI after LTx would also have been preferable. No viral sequencing was performed which makes it difficult to be certain whether the 19 patients with the same virus in sequential samples suffered from persistent infections or experienced multiple reinfections with different subtypes of virus.",

Using a systematic prospective recording of symptoms, we also found that a majority of these VRTIs were asymptomatic. Further mechanistic studies of viral interaction in transplanted lungs, and larger multicenter trials using standardized sampling and diagnostic methods, are warranted to better understand the effect of viral infections on long-term outcome after LTx.",
