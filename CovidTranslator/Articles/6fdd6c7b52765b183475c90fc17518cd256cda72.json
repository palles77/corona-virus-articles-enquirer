            "text": "Doubling Time (DT) is typically calculated for growth curves that show exponential growth, such as the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases day by day. DT represents the time it takes before the number of COVID-19 cases, in a certain country or area, doubles. Throughout the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak, DT values are continually changing. These changes are influenced by the measures that are recommended by the health authorities and implemented by governments. After the government-imposed shutdowns of Nordic Countries that were announced around the 12 th of March 2020, we followed the development of the DT in the region. Governments put in place measures never before experienced during peace time; working from home, closed schools and kindergartens, travel bans and social distancing. We conducted analyses to evaluate the effectiveness of these measures. Does it work? The initial set of results following the shutdown are encouraging, demonstrating a trend towards slower growth; however, this could be reversed if the measures that are in place now are abandoned too early. Premature optimism can be very costly. In this report we describe a method for monitoring the epidemic in real time and evaluating the effectiveness of the implemented measures.",

Never before in peace time has the modern world seen widespread travel bans, closed borders, home working, and shutdowns of schools and kindergartens. But do these measures successfully slow down and reduce the spread of COVID-19? Is it possible to follow infection trends in real-time to help government officials make well-informed decisions in order to contain the pandemic? Here we describe a method that allows close monitoring of trends that otherwise may not be apparent based on data from standard statistics of cases. By measuring the increase in doubling time, an indicator of how quickly the number of cases is multiplying, we can gain important insights from the COVID-19 epidemiologic data.",

Citizens that had been abroad were required to stay at home with their families for 14 days. On March 16 th , 2020, the country was officially shut down for travel with strict control of borders. Denmark implemented even stronger measures, with many shops such as IKEA being required to close as well. In the Norwegian capital Oslo, pubs and restaurants are still open, although with a much lower number of visitors than usual. In Norway, companies that could move their employees over to working from home were advised to do so. Iceland and Finland implemented similar measures, while Sweden closed some, but not all, schools.

There may be faults in testing COVID-19, as many countries are experiencing difficulties due to a shortage of test kits and a strain on institutions and personnel, which may influence the number of reported cases. South Korea and Norway have both performed a high number of tests. Testing levels in other Scandinavian countries are assumed to be at levels comparable to other West European countries. It is also assumed that the testing routines have been stable for longer periods of time and only change from time to time. To circumvent the testing as a source of error, doubling time of the mortality rates could be calculated as well (Supplemental Figure 3 ).

The evidence suggests that all Nordic countries which implemented the measures experienced the same trend, which strengthens the hypothesis that the measures are successful. An exception to this is Iceland, where the positive trend towards reduction in the number of new infections started slightly earlier. Another significant factor that may be influencing these outcomes is that certain restrictive measures were already in place in Norway before the 12 th of March 2020. People began working from home and travel activities were reduced even before the implementation of official measures.",
