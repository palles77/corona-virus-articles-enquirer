            "text": "While total oil and gas deal values in 2019 increased 40% to $370 bn, thanks to several upstream and downstream mega-deals, overall deal count declined year-over-year (y-o-y) by 40% as companies continue to struggle with low commodity prices and challenging market conditions, according to a new Deloitte report. M&A activity in 2020 will be more of the same, but a little bit different, the report said. In 2019, upstream deal values totaled $156 bn, the report noted, up $26 bn y-o-y. Only 208 deals were struck, 40% below the 5-year trend. The US was the hub of global upstream M&A last year, representing more than 60% in terms of both deal volume and value. Midstream significantly increased in both deal count and deal value in 2019, striking 76 deals worth $78 bn, a 30% and 50% y-o-y increase, respectively. Private equity spending increased in this sector as investors pivoted from production to infrastructure. Downstream deal value reached $114 bn, a decade high and almost double the prior year and 5-year average, while the number of transactions declined 15% y-o-y. Oilfield services (OFS) deal making stalled with deal values reaching $19 bn in 2019, down $2.5 bn y-o-y and 35% below the 5-year average. Volumes decreased 20% y-o-y, 10% below the 5-year average. Absent an increase in commodity prices, the dampened level of deal making activity is expected to continue in 2020, the report said. However, as many companies change their portfolios to match external market conditions and their own shifts in strategic priorities, evolving trends and themes could shape the oil and gas transactions market in the year ahead and beyond. The largest driver in 2020 divestitures will likely be massive 2018 and 2019 acquisitions, the report noted. Upstream companies involved in recent deals are expected to continue to realign their portfolios and strategies while also looking for divestment opportunities that allow them to focus on expanded footprints and assets. In looking at existing assets, some companies are considering carbon footprints when it comes to divestitures. As investor sentiment has changed, oil companies have increased their discussion of environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues. As the size of ESG investment funds grow, so could oil and gas companies' interests in burnishing their environmental credentials. To that end, not only renewables investment will likely increase but also carbon-based divestitures, Deloitte said. In 2020, majors are expected to be primary catalyst for global M&A. In 2019, the majors divested a wide swath of assets across a range of geographies and resource types. Integrated and national oil companies are moving onward and downward. To capitalize on growing chemicals demand, most international oil and gas companies are continuing to expand their downstream footprints, beyond refining assets, and into distribution, retail, and chemicals businesses. This investment push, that has primarily targeted integrated refining and petrochemical assets, as well as fuel and natural gas networks in the Middle East and Asia Pacific, is expected to continue.

            "text": "Manufacturers of fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) are setting ambitious goals to shift to recycled content. Nestle, for example, is investing $1.52 bn to use 2 M tonnes of food-grade recycled polyolefins, most of which will be obtained via chemical recycling, by 2025. Other packaging companies are also considering chemical recycling as a means to tackle the problem of plastic waste and achieve a circular economy for plastics. Chemical recycling makes it possible to convert plastic waste into new material with virgin-like properties and allows companies to get around the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) requirements for traceability as part of the foodgrade approval process. For food and packaging approval, a viable solution is to recycle back to propylene or ethylene and to reprocess the material to virgin polymer. This does not seem to be a problem for materials like polyethylene terephthalate (PET), which is primarily based on post-consumer plastic bottles. However, for polymers such as polyolefins, in which postconsumer collection comes from various types of packaging waste including food packaging, cosmetics, and household and domestic cleaners, chemical recycling presents a major challenge. In fact, it may take some time -at least 5-10 yearsbefore chemical recycling can evolve into an industrial scale technology. This is mainly due to constraints in collection and sorting. There is also the possibility that competition for post-consumer material such as polyolefins will intensify, thus restricting their availability and sparking an increase in the price of waste and finished products. With this scenario, recyclers might shift to alternative materials. ",

            "text": "The coronavirus outbreak has disrupted chemical production in China amid the extension of the Lunar New Year holiday period and restrictions on travel and the movement of goods. As the Chinese government continues to implement measures aimed at containing the spread of the novel coronavirus, chemical companies are forced to cut or delay production due to personnel shortages, logistical problems, and increasing inventories. As a result, demand has been sluggish. Given the importance of China in the global chemical market, a major curtailment of manufacturing activity in its chemical sector would adversely affect both domestic and export markets. According to ICIS, China accounts for over 50% of global capacity for chemicals such as the polyester chain, polyvinyl chloride (PVC), purified terephthalic acid (PTA), methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE), and methanol. Due to logistics restrictions, post-holiday production at China's polyolefin plants have been cut or postponed. These include Jiangsu Sanmu Group's 280,000 tonnes/y epoxy resins site in Yixing, Zhejiang Weitai Rubber Company's 100,000 tonnes/y styrene butadiene rubber (SBR) unit in Zhejiang, Sanjiang Fine Chemical's 60,000 tonnes/y ethylene oxide facility, also in Zhejiang, and Shandong Dadi Supu Chemical (Super Chemical)'s 100,000 tonnes/y isopropanol (IPA) site in Jiangsu. Similar cutbacks have been implemented for methyl isobutyl ketone (MIBK). Domestic prices of styrene monomers have dropped sharply, with methanol and PTA futures slumping on 4 Feb and 3 Feb 2020, respectively. Operating rates at Chinese refineries and polyethylene (PE) plants are also down. A bar graph shows China's share of world production capacity (tonnes/y) for petrochemicals by product (benzene, caustic soda, chlorine, ethylbenzene, ethylene, ethylene glycols, methanol, mixed xylenes, MTBE, para-xylene, PET resins, polyester fibres, polyester polymer, polypropylene, propylene, PTA, PVC, soda ash, toluene, VCM).",

The fall was attributed to surplus supply in China as byproduct output increased at a time of low export demand from the US and Europe; concerns that some FYME bismuth stocks, which amount to 19,228 tonnes, may be sold following the sale of some indium stocks; Chinese exports of bismuth metal fell by 23% year-on-year to 1232 tonnes in Jan 2019 to Apr 2019, reflecting lower shipments to Germany (-81%), the Netherlands (-41%) and the US (-55%), after additional US tariffs were introduced in Oct 2018. Chinese exports of bismuth oxides increased by 17% to 4226 tonnes in 2018, mainly due to higher demand from pigment producers in Europe. Shipments to France rose by 11% to 1378 tonnes.
