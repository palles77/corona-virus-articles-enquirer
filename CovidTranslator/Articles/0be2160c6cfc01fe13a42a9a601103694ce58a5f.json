Factors such as a knowledge-based and free-market economy have contributed towards a prominent position on the world map of bioinformatics. In this review, we have considered the educational measures, landmark research activities and the achievements of bioinformatics companies and the role of the Hong Kong government in the establishment of bioinformatics as strength. However, several hurdles remain. New government policies will assist computational biologists to overcome these hurdles and further raise the profile of the field.

The territory of Hong Kong was initially restricted to Hong Kong Island, with the British then extending their boundaries in two phases. The first phase, in 1860, saw the British outpost being extended to the Kowloon Peninsula, and in 1898 it was again extended to include the New Territories. Hong Kong underwent its first peaceful and democratic transfer of power in 1997 when China regained sovereignty [4, 5] . The area had been occupied by the Japanese in 1941 after the Battle of Hong Kong, which occupancy ended after 3 years and 8 months [6] when Japan surrendered at the end of the Second World War, in 1945. Hong Kong has now become a major global financial centre and one of East Asia's 'Economic Tigers'. The territory is economically and technically in an excellent position to assist developing nations worldwide [7] . During the past two decades, the Hong Kong SAR government has been actively pursuing growth in high-tech industries such as telecommunications, biotechnology, information technology and electronics to help develop this economic leader of Asia into a global technological giant in today's high-tech world.",

            "text": "Age Structure Assist the Establishment of Computational Biology Hong Kong has a free-market economy which is highly dependent on international trade and finance. The USA is Hong Kong's second-largest export partner after mainland China, which is an important factor in the Hong Kong economy (http://www.tid.gov.hk/english/trade_relations/ mainland/trade.html). During the past decade, the GDP of Hong Kong has grown steadily and is now about 6.0 % (Fig. 1) . The territory has one of the highest per capita incomes in the world. This dynamic economic environment provides an added advantage in high-tech R&D areas such as computer science and computational biology [8, 9] . The economy of any nation depends on its age structure, which presents various challenges. The age structure of a population is directly related to that society's productivity and economy [10] . Hong Kong has an advantage in that the percentage of its population that is of working age is one of the highest in the world. Hong Kong's working-age population (15-64 years) is about 74.8 %, and the median age in the territory is 43.4 years. The older age group (65 years and over) comprises about 13.5 % of Hong Kong's population (Fig. 1 ). It has been observed that a higher proportion of older people leads to a critical shortage in manpower and tends to undermine productivity. The healthcare costs of an older population are noted to be economically unproductive, which is also a burden for society [10] .",

Two projects are of particular note: first, the use of microcomputers in histopathology [11] and second, the development of the commercial Microbact 24E (MB24E) microsystem for the identification of common clinical isolates of Enterobacteriaceae and non-fermenting Gram-negative bacilli [12] . In 1998, two more bioinformatics papers by different research groups were published in the journal Bioinformatics. Smith and Xue, from the Biochemistry Department of the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST), developed a method for summing up and presenting the information contained in a set of aligned sequences to identify patterns within the sequences and represent them in a more accurate and graphical form [13] . Chau et al. [14] , from the Department of Applied Biology and Chemical Technology at the Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU), developed a software package entitled 'TLCQA' for low-cost analysis of thin-layer chromatography images. Computational biology had thus already spread to the different disciplines within Hong Kong In both programmes, students learn fundamental subjects such as an introduction to programming, an introduction to molecular biology and genetics, biocomputing and theories and algorithms in bioinformatics. The M.Sc. programme includes some additional mandatory courses such as systems biology and genome informatics, and a research project carrying 3 credits. Two other courses related to computational biology are available in the CUHK's undergraduate programme leading to a Bachelor of Engineering degree in computer science: 'Algorithms for Bioinformatics' (course code: CSCI3220) and 'Topics in Bioinformatics and Computational Biology' (course code: CSCI5050). Course CSCI3220 includes topics related to sequence alignment and multiple sequence alignment using different approaches such as Markov property, recursive functions, dynamic programming, FASTA and BLAST and typical clustering algorithms for microarray analysis. Course CSCI5050 includes the topics of molecular biology, data mining, data processing, sequence alignment and biological networks.",

This virus is highly pathogenic and has caused a pandemic 'bird flu' incident in the Hong Kong SAR. Several researchers have reported the emergence of multiple genotypes of the H5N1 virus in terrestrial poultry, leading to an outbreak of avian influenza in chickens in retail markets in Hong Kong and the molecular changes in the virus associated with this event [33] . One study published in Nature investigated the long-term evolution and dynamics of transmission of swine influenza A virus (SwIV) using a data set of more than 650 SwIV isolates and more than 800 swine sera from 12 years of systematic monitoring in Hong Kong, including the H1N1/2009 virus that caused a human pandemic [34] .

One study, a collaboration between researchers in the USA, Singapore and Hong Kong, deals with a unique data set arising from surveillance of swine influenza at a Hong Kong abattoir from 1998 to 2010 and may advance understanding of the prevalence of influenza and decrease the occurrence of influenza in Hong Kong [37] . Another study aimed to understand the dissimilarity of two new Dehalococcoides mccartyi strains through collaboration between US and Hong Kong scientists. In this study, Lee et al. [38] performed a comparative genomics analysis via a microarray and concluded that the observed functional incongruence between the activity and core genome phylogenies of D. mccartyi strains is probably caused by a horizontal shift in significant reductive dehalogenase- [39, 40] . The authors of this paper are themselves performing collaborative research. Three of the authors (George, Chakraborty and Zhu) have jointly published research findings on the effects of deleterious non-synonymous SNPs in the binding adaptability of flavopiridol with cyclin-dependent kinase 7 (CDK7), a one-cell-cycle regulatory protein [41] . Another example of collaboration between India and Hong Kong is this review paper concerning computational biology in the Hong Kong SAR; bioinformatics scientists from both countries have critically analysed the activity in and the status of computational biology in the territory.",

Professor Tsui's group worked on genomic-sequence variations and the epidemiology of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) [42] . Dr. Jun Wang from the Department of Biochemistry at the HKU is working on computational and transcriptional genomics, structural bioinformatics, SNPs and copy number variation (CNV). He developed an SNP detection algorithm for next-generation sequencing data [43] and also worked on a genome-wide association study on alleles in the FGFR2 gene that is associated with risk of breast cancer [44] . Ascertaining the dynamic nature of gene regulation is a significant challenge in systems biology, an area of research interest in Hong Kong. The corresponding author of this review is working on reconstructing dynamic gene regulatory networks for human cancer, to unravel the dynamic mechanism of cancer development [45] . Dr. Yip Yuk Lap Kevin from the School of Life Sciences at CUHK is researching the use of computational methods to study biological and medical phenomena and networks, and has published work in the journals Nature and Bioinformatics [46, 47] . Other eminent Hong Kong researchers have been working in the field of computational biology for decades; an attempt to outline the activities of these researchers, to provide a bird's-eye view of their research activities, is given in Table 5 . We have also attempted to determine the proportion of total research in Hong Kong that is related to computational biology, finding that publications in the area of bioinformatics comprise about 9 % of total publications (Fig. 5) ",

A major focus of the Hong Kong SAR government, therefore, is assisting companies to fulfil the need for medical products. Recent trends in Hong Kong's population have shown a shift of disease types towards malignant neoplasms, heart disease, pneumonia, cerebrovascular disease, etc. There is a resulting increase in the demand for high-tech products and services that use biotechnology and bioinformatics tools. In response to the outbreak of SARS, many biotechnological companies were established to develop diagnostic kits. One such project involves the development of a biochip by Dr. Yu Cheung-Hoi Albert of the HKUST, which was highlighted in Science magazine [48] . This 'lab-on-a-chip' rapidly diagnoses emerging pathogens, including influenza viruses; Yu subsequently established the company Hai Kang Life to manufacture these DNA chips. Cluster Technology Limited (Clus-terTech) is a computing technology company in Hong Kong which provides solutions for bioinformatics research that combine high-performance computing and cloud computing technology; several other companies have also been established in this area. To assist with world-class infrastructure for such companies, the Hong Kong Science and Technology Parks Corporation (HKSTPC) was established by the Hong Kong SAR government in May 2001 to provide core competency in manufacturing technology, biotechnology, information technology (including computational biology), environmental technology, management systems, etc. The HKSTPC manages three industrial estates and mentors technology-based companies through its incubation programme which assists with business development for potential new entrepreneurs.",

Collaborative research activities between bioinformaticians and laboratory biologists at both a national and an international level are also increasing rapidly. Such collaborative research groups analyse biological data ranging from genes to proteins, attempt to solve important biological questions together with laboratory scientists, make various predictions and validate different hypotheses. Despite this positive outlook, however, several challenges exist. More national centres for bioinformation, similar to the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) in the USA, are needed to provide a central depository and information source for biological data and tools.",

However, many challenges lie ahead for computational biologists and the Hong Kong SAR government if the territory is to be established as a globally important bioinformatics research centre. The government needs to act to encourage more research projects, teaching modules and conferences and the provision of research grants and support to attract larger numbers to the field of computational biology. Research must be sustained as a key area of investment to improve efficiency and competitiveness in meeting Hong Kong's needs, such as in the medical sector. To identify and support the existing researchers in the field of computational biology, more professional societies and journals indexed in the Science Citation Index should be initiated to drive Hong Kong computational biology towards new heights. This will benefit both national scientists and those in neighbouring Asian countries. Finally, venture capital would be extremely beneficial in the development of bioinformatics companies to assist Hong Kong to become a world-famous centre of computational biology. ",

In Hong Kong, the objective of this type of training is to educate both young researchers and instructors. These manpower training and workshop activities were much approved and supported by the Hong Kong SAR government.
