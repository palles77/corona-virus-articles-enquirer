            "text": "Site-specific proteases are the most popular kind of enzymes for removing the fusion tags from fused target proteins. Nuclear inclusion protein a (NIa) proteases obtained from the family Potyviridae have become promising due to their high activities and stringencies of sequences recognition. NIa proteases from tobacco etch virus (TEV) and tomato vein mottling virus (TVMV) have been shown to process recombinant proteins successfully in vitro. In this report, recombinant PPV (plum pox virus) NIa protease was employed to process fusion proteins with artificial cleavage site in vitro. Characteristics such as catalytic ability and affecting factors (salt, temperature, protease inhibitors, detergents, and denaturing reagents) were investigated. Recombinant PPV NIa protease expressed and purified from Escherichia coli demonstrated efficient and specific processing of recombinant GFP and SARS-CoV nucleocapsid protein, with site F (N V V V H Q.A) for PPV NIa protease artificially inserted between the fusion tags and the target proteins. Its catalytic capability is similar to those of TVMV and TEV NIa protease. Recombinant PPV NIa protease reached its maximal proteolytic activity at approximately 30\u00b0C. Salt concentration and only one of the tested protease inhibitors had minor influences on the proteolytic activity of PPV NIa protease. Recombinant PPV NIa protease was resistant to self-lysis for at least five days.",

            "text": "The application of recombinant proteins is wellaccepted approach for producing useful protein products such as industrial material and therapeutic proteins. Fusion tags have been very helpful, not only for the purpose of detection and purification of target proteins, but also for the purpose of improving the solubility of target proteins in different bioreactors (prokaryotic, yeast, animal, plant, and virus systems) [1] [2] [3] [4] . Examples of such tags are hexahistidine [5] , streptavidin [6] , glutathione-S-transferase (GST) 1 [7] , and maltose-binding protein (MBP) [8] , Flag [9] , tandem affinity purification (TAP) [10] , thioredoxin (Trx) [11] . However, the fusion tags may interfere with the structures and functions of the target proteins. It is preferable that fusion tags can be removed after purification and several strategies have been applied for this task [4] . Cleaving at a specifically recognized sequence that has been inserted between the tag and the target protein by a specific protease is a convenient way to eliminate the fusion tag. The commonly used proteases include factor Xa, thrombin, enterokinase, and tobacco etch virus (TEV) NIa protease, although each protease has its own advantages and disadvantages. Factor Xa can recognize and cleave at the sequence of Ile-Glu/Asp-Gly-Arg., which naturally converts prothrombin to thrombin [12] . However, under certain circumstances, factor Xa may cleave at non-specific sequences besides the predicted sites [13, 14] . Additionally, factor Xa may be disabled by adjacent hydrophobic sequences flanked on the C-terminal side of the potential site [15] . The optimal cleavage sites for thrombin have the following structures: (a) P4-P3-Pro-Arg.P1 0 -P2 0 , where P3 and P4 are hydrophobic amino acid and P1 0 , P2 0 are nonacidic amino acids; (b) P2-Arg.P1 0 , where P2 or P1 0 are Gly [16] . However, Chang et al. found out that thrombin can cleave at the lysine residues in the sequences Met-Lys.Ser-Arg-Asn-Leu, Arg-Cys-Lys.Pro-Val-Asn, and Ser-Ser-Lys.Tyr-Pro-Asn in performic acid-oxidized ribonuclease when studied the action of thrombin on 30 polypeptide hormones [16] . Due to its high stringency of sequence recognition, TEV NIa protease has been frequently used in the recent time. The specificity of TEV NIa protease has been well investigated [17] [18] [19] [20] . The preferred site for TEV NIa protease is considered to be site F (P6)E (P5)N (P4)L (P3)Y (P2)F (P1)Q.(P1 0 )G/S, in which P2, P4, and P5 positions may be non-conserved amino acids and P1 0 can be any amino acid except Pro [21, 22] . Recombinant TEV NIa protease has been used for removing several fusion tags in vitro, processing on artificial site F efficiently [23] [24] [25] [26] . However, the wild-type TEV NIa protease may degrade into a truncated form with severely diminished enzymatic activity [27] , which temporarily limited its range of application. Alternatively, TEV NIa protease mutants S219V or S219D, which are resistant against self-inactivation while maintaining enzymatic activity, have eliminated this limitation [20, 28] .",

            "text": "TEV, TVMV, and PPV are members of the Potyviridae family and NIa proteases obtained from potyviruses have similar structures and functions [29] [30] [31] . The potyvirus genome is a (+) stranded RNA; it is approximately 10 kb in length with the VPg and poly(A) at 5 0 and 3 0 positions, respectively [32] . It is translated into a single polyprotein upon infection, which is processed by the virally encoded proteases P1, HC-pro, and NIa. Most of the cleavage events are performed by NIa (nuclear inclusion protein a) protease. NIa protease processes seven sites present in the potyvirus polyprotein, named as A, B, C, D, V, E, and F [33] . Different sites are cleaved at varied rates and efficiencies by NIa protease; therefore leading to the intermediate products with different functions [32, 34] . Analyses of TVMV and TEV NIa protease had shown that site F between NIb-Capsid protein in the potyvirus polyprotein was the best substrate for TVMV NIa protease [35] or highly preferred substrate for TEV NIa protease [17] . The potyvirus NIa protease has a His-Asp-Cys catalytic triad, which is homologous to the trypsin-like serine proteases except for Cys replacing Ser [36] . NIa proteases obtained from PPV, TVMV, and TEV share certain sequence identities (Fig. 1) ; however, they recognize distinct amino acid sequences at each recognition sites. Consequently, they cannot recognize the cleavage sites of each other efficiently [21, 31, 34] . This offers the possibility for adopting other NIa proteases when the fusion proteins happen to contain sequences similar to recognition sites of TEV NIa protease. Recombinant TVMV NIa protease was expressed in Escherichia coli and it can cleave at artificial site F between fusion tags and target proteins with high activity and sequence stringency, which is comparable to that of TEV NIa protease. Similar to the behavior of TEV NIa protease, the catalytic activity of TVMV NIa protease decreased at high salt concentration and low temperature. Nevertheless, TVMV NIa protease did not show self-degradation that was detected in wild-type TEV NIa protease [29] . It has been reported that PPV NIa protease recognized and processed natural and artificial site F efficiently within the E. coli expression system [37, 38] . Recombinant PPV NIa protease purified from E. coli can cleave at canonical cleavage site F (NIb-CP junction) in vitro [39] . These experiments suggested that PPV NIa protease has potential for removing fusion tags in vitro when site F",

No extra or degraded bands were observed for recombinant PPV NIa protease. Most of the recombinant PPV NIa protease was eluted by 250-500 mM imidazole. The recombinant PPV NIa protease was largely soluble and purified by using nickel affinity chromatography. Approximately 20 mg soluble recombinant PPV NIa protease was obtained from 1 liter of bacteria culture.",

The result showed the optimal temperature for recombinant PPV NIa protease is approximately 30\u00b0C.

NIa proteases from TEV, TVMV, and PPV are similar to trypsinlike serine proteases but adopt unconventional catalytic triad in which Cys replaces Ser [42] . There are many reagents that can inhibit the protease function irreversibly or reversibly. To test whether commonly used protease inhibitors can affect the behavior of recombinant PPV NIa protease, recombinant PPV NIa protease (1 lg) and the substrate sG (50 lg) were incubated at 30\u00b0C for 2 h, supplemented with different protease inhibitors. These protease inhibitors were used at high concentrations (even up to 100 times of their usual dosages). Only 1 mM PMSF had an effect, albeit slight, on the protease activity; other tested protease inhibitors (benzamidine, pepstatin A, apro- tinin, leupeptin, antipain, and EDTA) had no effect on recombinant PPV NIa protease (Fig. 5c) . Previous report showed human cystatin C affected PPV NIa protease activity in certain level when used at high concentration of 400 lg/ml [43] . In another way, the purified PPV NIa protease was not inhibited by other cystatins, such as oryzacystatins I and II (OCI and OCII), corn cystatin II (CCII), human stefin A (HSA), the domain 8 of tomato multicystatin (TMC-8) and a large 24 kDa tomato cystatin (LTCyst), when used at a molar ratio of 1:40 (NIa:cystatin) [39] . According to the detail manual of Devid S. Waugh laboratory (http://mcl1.ncifcrf.gov/waugh_research.html), TEV protease was not affected by PMSF (1 mM), AEBSF (1 mM), TLCK (1 mM), Bestatin (1 mg/ml), pepstatin A (1 mM), EDTA (1 mM) and E-64 (3 mg/ml), and a commercial ''complete'' protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche), which is frequently used to inhibit serine-, cysteine-, and metallo-proteases, as well as calpains, of bacterial, mammalian, yeast, and plant cell extracts. However, zwitterionic detergent (APO-10, DDMAB, DODMG, FC-12, HECAMEG, LDAO, OG, and ZW 3-12) notably inhibited the proteolytic activity of rTEV [44] . We chose two common detergents, SDS (also working as a denaturing reagent) and Triton X-100, to test their effects on the activity of PPV NIa protease. As we can see from Fig. 5d , recombinant PPV NIa protease was very sensitive to SDS, losing most of its proteolytic activity in the presence of 0.05% SDS, whereas recombinant PPV NIa protease was quite tolerant to Triton X-100 (up to 2%). Another denaturing reagent, urea, had almost no affect on the performance of recombinant PPV NIa protease when used at a final concentration of 1 M. About 30% activity of recombinant PPV NIa protease was blocked by 2 M urea.",

            "text": "Many fusion tags are now available for optimizing the expression and purification of target proteins; therefore proteases are demanded to be highly specific towards the expected cleavage sites. We found that recombinant PPV NIa protease was extremely specific toward the cleavage sequence; no processing of Trx tag, hexahistidine tag, S tag, GST tag (data not shown) and MBP tag (data not shown) was observed, even during overnight cleavage. We chose the naturally preferred site F [32, 37, 38] as the recognition sequence in fused substrates for recombinant PPV NIa protease. Two different substrates (sG and sN) with insertion of site F were both cleaved efficiently by recombinant PPV NIa protease, indicating the interaction between protease and substrate was highly specific and efficient in both cases. The corresponding sites F for TEV, TVMV, and PPV were E N L Y F Q.S, E T V R F Q.S, and N V V V H Q.A, all adopting a conserved residue Gln in the P1 position [21, 29, 37] . The specificity of PPV NIa protease has been studied, mainly illustrating with anomalous proteolytic processing caused by mutated proteases or mutated substrates [31, 38, 49, 50] , thus a further analysis of the specificity and efficiency of PPV NIa protease-substrate complex by crystal structural is required. Although most studies about the cleavage determinant factors for NIa protease were performed with TEV and TVMV [20, 21, 33, 51] , the high conserved amino acid sequence and function among PPV, TEV, and TVMV NIa protease indicate the recognition mechanism of TEV and TVMV NIa protease may also fit for PPV NIa protease [52] . The crystal structures of TEV and TVMV NIa protease suggested that the S4 and S3 pockets are primarily responsible for their different sequence specificities and that the residues in the P3 and P4 positions of the cleavage sites are the most important specificity discriminators [21] .",

In addition, denaturing reagents and detergents were often required in the purification of insoluble or organellic proteins. The recombinant PPV NIa protease was sensitive to 0.05% SDS, but it was tolerant to both 2% Triton X-100 and 1 M urea. Comparatively, a commercial protease factor Xa (Cat. No. 69036-3, Novagen) is sensitive to urea, SDS, and high salt concentration (above 250 mM). The enzymatic ability of recombinant PPV NIa protease is similar to that reported by TVMV and TEV NIa protease with respect to molar ratio of protease and substrate [29, 53] . All the data indicates recombinant PPV NIa protease is a promising universal tool for fusion tags removal.",

Intracellular self-cleavage by TEV NIa protease on fusion protein MBP-TEVP-rsTEV-GFP-His 6 (rsTEV: recognition site for TEV NIa protease) resulted in native and soluble EGFP protein [55] . When a fusion protein containing site F and the PPV NIa protease were driven by two compatible plasmids and expressed simultaneously within E. coli, the PPV NIa protease could process on site F correctly in vivo [56] . We can propose that two possible interacted-proteins and the PPV NIa protease may be fused together, separated by two cleavage sites, thereby the whole polyprotein can be expressed from one single vector. In this way, the protease component in the polyprotein is likely to perform self-cleavage in vivo, which will facilitate the analysis of the interaction between the two proteins in vivo. ",
