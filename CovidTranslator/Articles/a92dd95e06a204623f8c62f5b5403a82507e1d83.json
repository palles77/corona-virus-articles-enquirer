During the initial stages of work on the analysis of TGEV structural components (5) , the virus titres we obtained from cell culture were low and not reproducible. There have been reports that the virus is stable for at least 1 hour at 37 \u00b0 C between pH 4--8 (8, 10) , but there are no data as to the effect of prolonged incubation at these pH values on the stability of the virus. The pH of the cell culture medium can atso have a marked effect on the production of virus in vitro. Poliovirus, for example, shows a lower yield when grown at a slightly acidic pH, due to inhibition of viral RNA synthesis (7) ; vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) is similarly affected, but faulty maturation has been sho~a to be the cause (4) .",

Data obtained from the uninfected controls indicated that RNA synthesis in APT/2 cells was not affected by pit to any great extent over the range studied. The rate of accumulation of synthesised RNA during the first 12 hours post infection (8 hours after the addition of [3H]-uridine), as shown by the results from the infected actinomycin D treated cells, was unaffected by pH between values of 6.5 and 8.0. Between 12 and 24 hours post infection the amount of RNA increased almost 2 fold in the cultures maintained at pH 6.5. However at the other two pH values investigated a reduction in the amount of intracellular RNA was seen, the reduction being larger at pH 8.0 than at pH 7.2. This reduction was not associated with an increase in the amount, of material released into the medium and therefore involved a breakdown of RNA produced in the first 12 hours. ",

Samples of stock virus were diluted 1 : 1 with phosphate buffer (11) to give the required pH. The samples were incubated for 24 hours in water baths maintained at either 4 \u00b0 or 37 \u00b0 C. The amount of infectious virus remaining after incubation was determined by plaque assay at pH 6.8. The results given in Figure 2 indicate that the virus was stable over a wide pH range at the lower temperature. At 37 \u00b0 C, however, the virus showed greatest stability at pH 6.5. When the pH was increased above this value the virus showed marked instability, but at lower pH values the decrease in stability was less obvious. Figure 3 shows the results of an experiment in which the rate of inactivation of the virus at 4 \u00b0 and 37 \u00b0 C was followed under three pH conditions. Over the 24 hours period of the experiment the amount of virus inactivation at 4 \u00b0 C was small and essentially identical for the three pI-I values. At the normal virus growth temperature of 37 \u00b0 C the rate of inactivation was exponential with respect to time over this period but the rate increased as the pH increased. The inactivation at 37 \u00b0 C followed first order kinetics (luring the 24 hours period and the half-lives of the virus at pH 6.5, 7.2 and 8.0 were 7.34, 4.70, and 3.55 hours respectively. Figure 4 shows the results of rate zonal sedimentation of [3H]-uridine labelled TGEV, concentrated by ammonium sulphate precipitation, through 20--45 per cent (w/w) sucrose gradients. Two peaks of radioactivity were observed indicated by the symbols v and vm. On electron microscopic examination of these two areas the peak v was found to contain discrete virus particles whereas peak vm contained clumps of virus particles and membrane fragments. After incubation at 4 \u00b0 C at pH 6.5 peak vm contained more radioactivity than peak v, but as the pH was increased the aggregates eontMned in peak vm dissociated and an increase in the amount of radioactivity in peak v was observed. At pH values below 6.5 almost all the radioactivity was contained in peak vm, above pH 8.0 the counts in peak v decreased and became associated with lower molecular weight material at the top of the gradient probably due to breakdown of the virus.

Subsequent experiments revealed that the growth enhancement was due to the pH of the media, but unlike many other viruses, TGEV grew to a higher titre in slightly acidic media. From the virus growth curves it appears that there are two main effects of pH, the first early in infection whe~ the rate of virus production is affected, and the second after 24 hours following the peak of the virus yield, when the rate of virus inactivation is affected. It is possible that these results could reflect the effect of pit on the association of the virus into aggregates either with itself or ~dth eetI debris. The presence of virus aggregates would effectively reduce the amount of virus available for titration. If this was the case with TGEV, the cultures grown at pit 8.0 would be expected to contain more aggregates than cultures grown at pH 6.5, We have shown by rate zonal sedimentation however that the presence of virus aggregates is more marked at the lower pH value and is therefore not the reason for the results of the growth experiments.",

When both the inoculum and the overlay medium were maintained at either pH 6.8 or pH 7.2 the number of plaques remained constant which suggests that over this range pH has little or no effect on penetration and uncoating. The decrease in plaque diameter which occurs at pH 7.2 as compared with that at pH 6.5, again indicates the reduction in growth of the virus at the higher pH.",

Using low levels of this drug we have been able to investigate the effect of pH on TGEV ENA synthesis. Early ENA synthesis (0--12 hours post infection) was found to be unaffected by pH. After 12 hours, however, the amount of EliZA present in the infected cultures held at pH 6.5 increased whereas the content in the cultures at the other two pH values decreased. This suggests a breakdown of synthesized viral RNA which is greater at higher pH values. This may be the reason for our finding that less virus is produced at pH 8.0 compared with pH 6.5. The final interpretation of these results, however, must wait until more is known about primary and secondary transcription of corona.virus RNA.",

(1) observed that a sample of virus in a bicarbonate buffered medium left at 37 \u00b0 C for 24 hours lost virtually all infectivity. In experiments where the pH was controlled we found that the thermal inactivation of the virus at 37 \u00b0 C was pH dependent, with least inactivation at pH 6.5. The rate of inactivation appears to be exponential over a period of 24 hours, and is greatly increased as the pH of the medium is raised. This effect appears to correlate with the loss of virus infectivity as seen in growth curves, when cultures are incubated for more than 24 hours.",
