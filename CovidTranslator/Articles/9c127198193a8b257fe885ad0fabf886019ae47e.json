Given the lack of both specific drugs and an efficient preventive vaccine, the expectation that the SARS-CoV-2 transmission rate might decrease in temperate regions during summer, dominated in the social scene. Here, we attempted a prediction of the worldwide spread of the infections based on climatic data, expressed by bioclimatic variables. The calculated probability maps shown that potential areas of infection follow a shift from the Tropical to Temperate and Mediterranean Bioclimatic regions. Maps show an increased probability of infections in Europe, followed by an expansion covering areas of the Middle East and Northern Africa, as well as Eastern coastal areas of North America, South-Eastern coastal areas of Latin America and two areas of Southern Australia. Our approach may, therefore, be of value for the incorporation of climatic influences in the design and implementation of public health policies.
