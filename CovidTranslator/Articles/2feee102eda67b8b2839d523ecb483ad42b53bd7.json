However, compared to conventional vaccines, DNA vaccines usually induce poor antibody responses. To develop a more potent IBV DNA vaccine formulations, a monocistronic vector encoding the nucleocapsid protein of IBV and a bicistronic vector separately encoding the nucleocapsid protein and immunestimulatory interleukin-2 were constructed. When the DNA vaccines were administered to the quadriceps muscle of chickens, the induced humoral and cellular responses were evaluated. There was a significant difference in ELISA antibody levels elicited by either monocistronic or bicistronic DNA vaccines. The percentage of CD3 + , CD3 + CD8 + and CD3 + CD4 + subgroups of peripheral blood T-lymphocytes in chickens immunized with bicistronic DNA vaccine were higher than those in chickens immunized with monocistronic DNA vaccine. When chickens were challenged with a virulent strain of IBV, the protective efficacy could be enhanced significantly after immunization with bicistronic DNA vaccine. These results demonstrated that bicistronic DNA vaccine is an effective approach to increase IBV DNA vaccine immunogenicity.",

Such conventional vaccines, although generally effective, do have some disadvantages. Attenuated vaccines, which generally induce long-lasting immunity, have a risk of insufficient attenuation and/or genetic instability (Cook et al., 1986) . The limitations of inactivated vaccines include high cost for manufacturing and lack of long-term immunity. Therefore a new generation of IB vaccines is called for.",

This strategy has already been used successfully to enhance the effect of DNA vaccination procedures (Li et al., 2006; Chow et al., 1997; Henke et al., 2004) . The pIRES-EGFP/DsRed bicistronic plasmid which was constructed and identified previously was used to construct monocistronic and bicistronic DNA vaccines. The plasmid pIRES-EGFP/DsRed enabled the simultaneous translation of two genes of interest from the same RNA transcript. Each gene is cloned into one of the multiple cloning sites on either side of the internal ribosomal entry site of the encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV). The entire construct is under control of the cytomegalovirus (CMV) immediate-early promoter allowing the expression of two individual proteins from one plasmid. In this study, an experimental immunization strategy was developed and tested against IBV. Two recombinant plasmids pIRES-N/IL2, pIRES-N were constructed. These recombinant plasmids were inoculated in chickens and tested in a protection-challenge experiment, demonstrating that vaccination with the co-expression plasmid pIRES-N/IL2 can induce stronger immune response than vaccination with pIRES-N. Thus, it seems that vaccination with a bicistronic DNA vaccine expressing both IBV N protein and IL-2 may elicit potent immune response. In this study, the level of specific antibodies developed in pIRES-N/IL2 group was higher than that of pIRES-N group. However, the precise role of antibodies for the control of IBV infection remains controversial. Some reports have shown that circulating antibody titer did not correlate with protection from IBV infection (Gelb et al., 1998; Gough and Alexander, 1979; Raggi and Lee, 1965) . Other studies demonstrated that humoral immunity plays an important role in disease recovery and virus clearance (Cook et al., 1991; Thompson et al., 1997; Toro and Fernandez, 1994) . The antibody-dependence of the mechanism of protection against the disease remains unclear, suggesting an important role of the T-cell response in efficacy protection.",

It has been shown that cellmediated immunity to IBV is also induced and is believed to be a protective mechanism in IBV infection. CD8+ CTL are critical in the control of infectious bronchitis in poultry Dhinakar and Jones, 1997; Seo et al., 2000) . CD4+ T-cell responses may increase the proliferation, maturation and functional activity of CD8+ CTL, providing increased help for B-cells and directly producing antiviral cytokines. By increasing the number of T-cells at the same site being able to respond to N antigen, there might have been a limiting effect on viral replication leading to better protection.",
