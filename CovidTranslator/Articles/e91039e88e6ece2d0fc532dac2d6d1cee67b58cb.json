Based on bioinformatics analysis, 10 antigenic peptides derived from the S protein sequence were selected and synthesized. The antigenicity and immunoreactivity of all the peptides were tested in vivo and in vitro. Four peptides (P6, P8, P9 and P10) which contain B cell epitopes of the S protein were identified, and P8 peptide was confirmed in vivo to have a potential in serological diagnosis. By using a syncytia formation model, we tested the neutralization ability of all 10 peptides and their corresponding antibodies. It is interesting to find that P8 and P9 peptides inhibited syncytia formation, suggesting that the P8 and P9 spanning regions may provide a good target for anti-SARS-CoV drug design. Our data suggest that we have identified peptides derived from the S protein of SARS-CoV, which are useful for SARS treatment and diagnosis.",

S1 plays an important role in virus binding to virus-receptor (ACE2) while S2 mediates the fusion between the viral particle and its target cell [4, 5] . According to our current work, we confirmed that S protein can be cleaved into two parts [5] . It is predicted that the S protein yields two fragments spanning residues from 1 to 667 (S1) and 668 to 1255 (S2). So 10 peptide sequences (with 18-30 residues in length) were selected from S protein (in which peptides P1-8 are located in the S1 part and peptides P9-10 are located in S2) based on a series of bioinformatics analysis [6, 7] .",
