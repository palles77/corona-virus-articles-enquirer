Methods: We compared electronically monitored facility-wide HH frequency in the weeks immediately prior to outbreaks of acute respiratory or gastrointestinal infections versus control weeks in a 137-bed pediatric LTCF from October 2012-August 2015. Control weeks were the 8-14 day (control 1) and 15-21 day (control 2) periods prior to the onset of each outbreak. Results: There was no difference in HH frequency in the weeks leading up to the outbreaks versus control weeks (odds ratio [OR], 1.0; 95% confidence interval CI, 1.00-1.001 using control 1 and OR, 1.0; 95% CI, 1.00-1.001 using control 2). Conclusions: Our findings differed from those in adult LTFCs, possibly because of the greater contact between residents and staff in the pediatric setting, increased susceptibility to viral pathogens because of immunologic immaturity, or differences in the types of pathogens prevalent in each setting. Although HH may be important for limiting the number of residents infected during outbreaks, we found no association between HH frequency and subsequent outbreak onset.",

            "text": "Hand hygiene is the primary recommendation for preventing infections in health care settings. 1 A recent review identified several studies conducted in acute care which have demonstrated a correlation between improved hand hygiene compliance and reductions in infections from bacterial organisms commonly spread via direct or indirect contact, such as Staphylococcus aureus and Clostridium difficile. 2 Research in adult long-term care has also shown a correlation between improved hand hygiene and reduction in viral respiratory outbreaks, which are transmitted by contact or droplet routes and therefore difficult to control in residential health care settings. 3 Pediatric long-term care facilities face unique challenges with regard to outbreak prevention. Children in such facilities have increased risk of developing infections. They rely on facility staff for assistance with all activities of daily living and require frequent hands-on contact from a variety of caregivers, thereby providing many opportunities for exposure to transmissible pathogens. 4 In addition, children in pediatric long-term care facilities have chronic medical conditions necessitating the use of indwelling devices, such as tracheostomy and feeding tubes, which place them at greater risk of infection. 5 Many pediatric long-term care residents are young and therefore have immature immune systems placing them at increased risk of infections. Finally, the home-like environment and focus on group therapy complicates adherence to hand hygiene protocols and other infection prevention efforts because staff members often work with multiple children at once and engage in activities in which educational toys and props are shared. 6 Because of the specialized nature of pediatric long-term care and high burden of infections among residents, we sought to determine whether hand hygiene frequency was associated with subsequent outbreaks of acute respiratory or gastrointestinal infections in a pediatric-long term care facility.",

One reason for the disparate results may be differing methods of ascertaining hand hygiene compliance. We measured electronically monitored frequency of hand hygiene, whereas previous studies assessed adherence to hand hygiene protocols using direct observation of hand hygiene opportunities. Because timing and appropriateness of hand hygiene may be more critical for infection prevention than overall frequency, our results may be biased toward the null. Another reason for the difference in findings may be the study population. Children in pediatric long-term care likely have more frequent contact with a greater number and variety of staff members compared with residents in adult long-term care, which would make transmission events more likely. 4, 6 Children also may be more susceptible to gastrointestinal and acute respiratory infections because of their age and immunologic immaturity. 5 Furthermore, viral pathogens that are more common among children (eg, rhinovirus) may be more likely to be spread via the droplet route and therefore less preventable through hand hygiene. 8 Finally, our study may have lacked sufficient power to detect associations between hand hygiene frequency and the occurrence of outbreaks, particularly if the magnitude of association were small.",

It is possible that some hand hygiene events were not recorded by the system, for example if they were performed using personal bottles of hand sanitizer. However, this practice was discouraged and unlikely to have varied over time.
