Finding a vaccine for this virus therefore remains a high priority. Here, we show that a DNA vaccine encoding the spike (S) glycoprotein of the SARS-CoV induces T cell and neutralizing antibody responses, as well as protective immunity, in a mouse model. Alternative forms of S were analysed by DNA immunization. These expression vectors induced robust immune responses mediated by CD4 and CD8 cells, as well as significant antibody titres, measured by enzymelinked immunosorbent assay. Moreover, antibody responses in mice vaccinated with an expression vector encoding a form of S that includes its transmembrane domain elicited neutralizing antibodies. Viral replication was reduced by more than six orders of magnitude in the lungs of mice vaccinated with these S plasmid DNA expression vectors, and protection was mediated by a humoral but not a T-cell-dependent immune mechanism. Gene-based vaccination for the SARS-CoV elicits effective immune responses that generate protective immunity in an animal model.",

Because coronaviruses assemble in the compartment between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi apparatus 10 , and the S leader may direct it to the ER, the native leader sequence was retained in one set of vectors (Fig. 1a) and replaced in another set with a leader sequence derived from the interleukin-2 gene. Expression was not significantly altered by this leader sequence substitution (data not shown), and it was not studied further. Two S carboxy-terminal mutants, one that truncated the cytoplasmic domain (SDCD) and another that deleted the transmembrane and cytoplasmic regions (SDTM), were prepared, and expression of these cDNAs by a mammalian expression vector suitable for human vaccination was confirmed (Fig. 1b) .",

Animals immunized with the SARS-CoV SDCD expression vector induced substantial neutralizing antibody titres ranging from 1:50 to 1:150, unlike the vector control (Fig. 2b , middle panel). The S expression vector with the transmembrane domain deleted, SDTM, also induced neutralizing antibodies, but the titres were lower (from 1:25 to 1:75). The vector with the partial cytoplasmic domain deletion induced the optimal response (Fig. 2b , right panel). Similar neutralization was observed when the complete cytoplasmic domain was removed (data not shown), suggesting that synthesis of the glycoprotein on the cell surface, without the cytoplasmic domain, is required for this response. This may be because it gives rise to a more native structure relevant to the function of this virus. Possibly, the transmembrane region helps to form a more physiological form of the S protein by anchoring the protein on the membrane, preserving conformational determinants and/or stabilizing the formation of the putative trimer. The same antisera were also used in a SARS-CoV microneutralization assay to assess the neutralization titre against SARS-CoV. Again, antisera from SDCD-vaccinated mice elicited the most potent neutralizing antibody responses (Fig. 2b, right panel) .",

More recently, an animal model that may better reproduce the signs and time course of the human disease has been described. In this model, which uses ferrets, the development of pneumonitis and increased viral replication have been observed 17 . A murine model of SARS-CoV replication has also been described recently, in which intranasal administration of 10 4 50% tissue culture infectious dose (TCID 50 ) units of SARS-CoV leads to virus replication in the lungs and nasal turbinates within 1-2 days 18 . This model afforded us the opportunity to examine immune protection against viral replication in the respiratory tract as a measure of vaccine efficacy. BALB/c mice were immunized with the various plasmid DNAs encoding S protein and challenged 30 days after the final boost. Animals were challenged intranasally with 10 4 TCID 50 units of SARS-CoV (Urbani strain), and viral replication in the respiratory tract was measured 2 days later. In this analysis, the most potent immunogen, SARS SDCD, led to .10 6 -fold reduction in viral load in the lungs compared with a control group injected with vector alone, in which mean viral titres of .10 8 were observed ( Fig. 3a ; P \u00bc 0.0079). Although the S plasmid with the deleted transmembrane domain elicited a lower neutralizing antibody response, it was equally effective in reducing viral replication in the lungs. A 60-to 300-fold reduction of virus titre in the nasal turbinates was also observed ( Fig. 3b ; P \u00bc 0.0079). In both cases, evidence of pro- Figure 3 Protection against pulmonary SARS-CoV replication after challenge in BALB/c mice following DNA vaccination. Immunization and challenge were performed in mice as described previously 18 , and viral replication (mean log 10 TCID 50 per g tissue with standard error) in the lower (a) and upper (b) respiratory tract after challenge with SARS-CoV was measured for five immunized animals inoculated with SDCD, SDTM or empty plasmid vector control. The lower limit for detection of SARS-CoV replication was 1.5 TCID 50 per g in the lungs and 1.8 TCID 50 per g in the nasal turbinates. A non-parametric two-tailed t-test (Mann-Whitney) was used for statistical analysis. Log-transformed virus titres were compared, and statistical significance was assigned to the differences, both with a P value of 0.0079.",

            "text": "In this report, DNA vaccination has been used to induce cellular and humoral immunity to the SARS-CoV S glycoprotein. The humoral immune response includes the generation of neutralizing antibodies. This humoral immunity alone can inhibit pulmonary viral replication in a murine challenge model and suggests that DNA vaccination with the SARS-CoV S glycoprotein gene results in protective immunity. The SARS-CoV is a novel coronavirus, but vaccines for other human coronaviruses have not been successfully developed 14 . But considerable experience in developing vaccines against common veterinary coronaviruses has been obtained with animal coronaviruses 11, 12 . The feline infectious peritonitis virus is a coronavirus that causes significant morbidity and mortality in domestic animals for which vaccines have been investigated, but the development of these vaccines has been complicated by possible immune potentiation of the disease and by viral evolution 19 . In the present study, T-cell depletion and immune IgG passive transfer were used to assess the importance of humoral responses in protection against SARS-CoV challenge. These results suggest that antibodies against SARS-CoV S glycoprotein protect against SARS-CoV challenge and do not enhance infection in this animal model. The cellular immune response appears to play a limited role in protection, although studies of animal coronaviruses have suggested that both cellular and humoral immunity contribute to protection during persistent infection 13, 14 .",

            "text": "DNA vaccines have been used in a variety of animal models for different infectious diseases, including influenza, HIV, Ebola, West Nile and other viruses (reviewed in ref. 20) . Despite their success in animal models, this approach has only recently been used in human studies, and its potential to protect against human diseases has yet to be established. For this reason, as well as the limitations of the animal model for SARS-CoV infections, it is important to ascertain the immunogenicity of these plasmids in humans. Should the response be suboptimal, it can be readily augmented using primeboost combinations with inactivated viral vaccine candidates or with adenoviral or poxvirus vectors. The definition of effective viral genes reported here can guide the choice of inserts for such genebased vaccination approaches. For example, the SDCD mutant can be expressed in other vector delivery systems for analysis, alone or in various combinations. Although the murine model allows assessment of various antiviral approaches and examination of the effect of immunity on pulmonary virus replication, it does not show sustained infection or high lethality. The model of infection that has been described in ferrets shows prominent pulmonary pathology associated with infection, and the efficacy of such vaccines in this and other pathogenic animal models will be of interest in future studies. At the same time, it is not known whether even the ferret model faithfully replicates the complex pathology and symptomatology of the human disease, and it will be necessary to test potential SARS vaccine candidates for their immunogenicity, safety and efficacy in humans in the event of future outbreaks.
