            "text": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) emerged as a new human infection in South China in 2002, and ultimately caused over 8000 infections and almost 800 deaths as it spread to five continents along airline routes [1, 2] . To date, most SARS patients have been adults with very few cases in children less than 15 years of age [2] . While the overall mortality rate from SARS during the 2002-2003 pandemic was approximately 10%, the mortality among the elderly exceeded 50% [1, 2] . Subsequent outbreaks were reported later in 2003 with the latest outbreak in 2004 in China occurring as a result of accidental exposure to a laboratory virus isolate [1] . Early on, a new coronavirus, SARS corona virus (SARS-CoV), was identified as the etiologic agent responsible for human SARS; the virus was also determined to be of zoonotic origin with bats, Chinese palm civets and other mammals serving as natural reservoir hosts [2] . SARS-CoV is an enveloped virus with a positive and ssRNA genome encoding a replicase and several structural proteins including an important spike (S) protein, which binds to host receptors and can elicit neutralizing antibodies linked to protective immunity [1] . SARS outbreaks remain as a serious global concern because of the continued threat of zoonotic transmission to humans or the accidental or intentional release of laboratory isolates [1] . The SARS-CoV is classified by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases of the US NIH (NIH-NIAID) as a category C pathogen, which also includes yellow fever virus, influenza virus and other emerging pathogens that could be bioengineered for mass dissemination based on their availability, ease of production and dissemination, and potential for high morbidity and mortality [101] .",

Moreover, more than 50% of the neutralizing activity in the sera of convalescent SARS patients is mediated by RBD-S-specific antibodies [9, 12] , while RBD-S can absorb and remove the majority of neutralizing antibodies in the antisera of rabbits, mice and monkeys immunized with inactivated SARS-CoV or modified vaccinia virus expressing S protein [9, 13] . These studies provide the rationale for selecting RBD-S as an important target for vaccine development. The recombinant 21 kDa RBD-S will be expressed in yeast (Pichia pastoris), bacteria (Escherichia coli), or baculovirus (pending studies demonstrating optimal protection, as described below). More recently, a second RBD-S 219-mer construct corresponding to residues 318-536 was expressed in Chinese hamster ovary-K1 cells and shown to exhibit correct folding and conformation followed by equivalent or enhanced protection [14] ; this construct will also be evaluated as a back-up vaccination strategy.",

            "text": "Several different technologies have been proposed for developing human SARS-CoV vaccines, including inactivated virus vaccines, live-attenuated vaccines, adenovirus or poxvirus vectored vaccines, and DNA vaccines [1] . Among the concerns regarding these vaccines is the possibility of vaccine enhancement of disease, which has been noted with feline CoVs causing feline infectious peritonitis [1, 19, 20] . Similarly, laboratory animals administered alum-adjuvanted whole-virus SARS-CoV vaccine and subsequently challenged with infectious virus experienced enhanced disease and immunopathology comprised of eosiniophilic infiltration and Th2-mediated inflammatory alveolar damage [21] , similar to immunopathologic lung reactions found in infants and animals challenged with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) [22, 23] . A double-inactivated SARS-CoV (formalin and ultraviolet radiation) was also shown to elicit eosinophilic and immunoenhancing pathology, as well as poor protection, especially in aged animals, suggesting the possibility that aged humans (a desired target population for the vaccine) may be particularly vulnerable to vaccine-induced effects [24] . Further studies showed that a Venezuelan equine encephalitis vector containing the SARS nucleocapsid (NP) gene also elicited eosinophilic immunopathology in BALB/c mice after challenge without any noticeable protection [25] . Thus, it was hypothesized that the NP antigen of SARS-CoV may be responsible for this property of inactivated vaccines [25, 26] . It was also reported that the formalin-inactivated RSV vaccine was associated with lack of antibody affinity maturation followed by poor TLR stimulation, suggesting that NP may not account entirely for immune enhancement [27] .",

In addition, antigen/adjuvant formulation studies will be established both biochemically and by immunological assessment (potency). By performing a minimum of three full pilot runs with quality control for both process and release, the authors will maximize the probability of successful technology transfer for the cGMP manufacture and with optimal yield and purity. Accelerated and long-term stability studies will be conducted on the final formulations, with chemical stability emphasizing provocative tests at high pH to induce deamidation and with selective oxidizing agents to produce oxidation. In addition, stability will be assessed at different time points after conducting temperature incursion experiments (repeated freeze-thaw cycles and storage at different temperatures). Following completion of process development of the vaccine, the production technology will be transferred to WRAIR for cGMP manufacture.

While safety and immunogenicity studies with the RBD-S vaccine are feasible, human challenge studies with SARS-CoV would not be considered safe or ethical. Therefore, pivotal animal efficacy studies will be conducted using at least one animal model exhibiting host pathogenic and immune responses that are matched as closely as possible to those of humans [41] . Besides the nonhuman primate model, the diseases and lethality revealed by ACE2 transgenic mice infected by clinical isolates of SARS-CoV (e.g., Urbani) and those elicited by wild-type Balb/c mice in response to a mouse-adapted strain of SARS-CoV, designated MA-15) [33, 34, 42] make them among the best models for evaluating in vivo efficacy of SARS vaccines.",
