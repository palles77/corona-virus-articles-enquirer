            "text": "1984 marks the centenary of the first use of one of the most effective viral vaccines (rabies, Pasteur, 1884) as well as being the famous milestone of fictional political forecasting (Orwell, 1949) . This 100 year period has witnessed the industrialization of countries throughout the world and, along with this social and economic development, marked changes in patterns of infectious disease both accompanying and in some cases caused by the population and social changes. Excellent examples of these medical changes are shown in Figs. 1.1 -1.3, where mortality in different age groups is compared for the two years, 1910 and 1967 in Germany for infectious diseases, heart and circulation disease and neoplastic disease, respectively. A dramatic drop in mortality at all ages, but particularly in children, from infectious disease is noted between 1910 and 1967, whereas, conversely, an increase in mortality in older persons (but not children) is noted which is caused by heart and circulation diseases and neoplasms. Disease patterns are still changing today and new viral diseases are discovered regularly (witness the fevers of Marburg and Lassa in the last decade, and, more recently, the different viruses associated with AIDS). Indeed there is every reason to assume that continual change in infectious diseases is to be expected in the future. Even the arrival of potent antiviral compounds may not eradicate diseases such as herpes, but rather may alter the pathogenic process of the virus itself as strong selective pressures are brought to bear. A similar phenomenon has been happening with bacteria such as Staphylococci or Streptococci as, over the years, strong selective pressures exerted by antibiotics have led to the emergence of organisms with reduced or altered pathogenicity. In the case of malaria, wide- spread use of antimalarials on the one hand has led to a gradual and threatening build up of drug resistant strains of parasite and also the use of DDT to destroy the mosquito has led to development of resistance in the vector. Therefore both eukaryotes and prokaryotes possess a dramatic ability to adapt to a changed environment, and viruses are no exception.",

            "text": "As bacteriologists before us have done, we should ask ourselves which viral dis- eases are important causes of mortality and morbidity, and, amongst these which would be the most suitable for ultimate control or even eradication. In fact, the question is more complex than this because in different parts of the world different viral diseases are important and even the same virus (such as measles) may cause very different disease syndromes. Whilst in most major European countries respiratory viruses are an important cause of morbidity and mortality, in third world countries measles, polio and diarrhoea1 diseases predominate in this respect. A potential for distorted programmes of control of viral disease may easily occur, with most research centred on developed countries and therefore oriented towards viral disease in those countries. An excellent example is in the area of antiviral chemotherapy. At the present time most research effort is undoubtedly in the area of herpes infections, particularly HSV-2 causing genital infections, and this is closely followed by the search for new compounds against influenza A virus and rhinoviruses. Also, although influenza A is a pandemic virus causing mortality and morbidity throughout the world the same cannot be said for herpes viruses. Although infections with herpes viruses are universal, the impact of these nevertheless pale into insignificance beside medical problems with measles, arboviruses and hepatitis A and B in third world countries. So the direction of research effort needs continuous reassessment but, more importantly, some international perspective and direction. The World Health Organisation has provided this perspective for the eradication of smallpox from the whole world and continues to provide direction with its integrated 'Health for All by the year 2000' programme ( Fig. 1.4) which calls on member states to pursue a programme aimed at attainment by all people of the world, of a level of health that will permit them to live a socially and economically produc- . piped water reaches a small community in the Soloman Islands: satisfying needs for water calls for a complex interlocking planning and action at many levels. C. inequality in the great cities of the world. (From 'World Health', WHO publication.) tive life. The programme includes sections on the control of certain viral diseases causing respiratory infection and diarrhoea1 diseases. The WHO conference at Alma-Ata in the USSR in 1978 stressed the importance of primary health care: \"essential health care must be based on practical scientifically sound and socially acceptable methods and technology made universally accessible to individuals and families in the community through their full participation and at a cost that the community and the country can afford to maintain at every stage of their develop-ment in the spirit of self reliance and self determination\". This programme does not, at present, envisage eradication of any particular viral disease, as smallpox was eradicated, because this may not gain the necessary full support of all countries. Individual countries might, and are, considering 'national' eradication of certain virus infections such as measles in the USA, Cuba, Bahamas, Canada and Barbados where mortality rates of less than 1 measles death per 100000 population have now been achieved. Polio is another example of a viral disease which can be eradicated nationally, but of course a 'national' eradication always means that re-introduction from outside can constantly occur. Table 1 .1 illustrates illness and death caused by infectious diseases (viruses, bacteria and parasites) in Africa, Asia and Latin America. Viruses are the single chief cause of mortality, amounting to many millions of persons per year. Among these virus infections the worst culprits are respiratory viruses such as influenza, and measles and rotaviruses. Although an estimated 5-10 million persons die of enteric infections in these three continents each year, viruses will cause only a proportion of these cases and a similar situation will be true for respiratory illness. We shall examine the methods developed for the prevention of measles, influenza, polio and rotaviruses later on (Chapters 8, 7, 4 and 9, respectively) but it may be mentioned here that live polio vaccines used so successfully in industrialized countries are much more difficult to apply successfully in third world countries where problems of vaccine administration, heat lability control and viral interference become very important. Measles programmes are being initiated now in certain third world countries (reviewed by McKenzie, 1983) , but vaccines against diarrhoea1 diseases are in their infancy. Research has been orientated towards the development of successful inactivated or live vaccines or chemoprophylactic agents against influenza for the last 40 years with only limited success and even less success against other respiratory viruses such as respiratory syncytial virus and parainfluenza viruses.",

In general therefore we can conclude that certain viral diseases are 'shared' between developed and underdeveloped countries (such as influenza, measles, polio and rabies) and research and technical developments in industrialized nations will hopefully be applied worldwide. An important qualification here is that new vaccines and antivirals should not be too expensive and, unfortunately, recent rabies vaccines (Chapter 6) and hepatitis vaccines (Chapter 16) are extremely costly. Live attenuated polio and measles vaccines are produced very cheaply and with more attention to their delivery (Chapters 4 and 8) can and should result in a dramatic decrease of polio and measles in these countries in the next decade.",

Table 1 .2 shows death rates from infectious diseases in countries with 'fully developed health services' compared to those without these facilities. Table  1 .3 further emphasizes marked differences in mortality caused by acute respiratory infection (bacterial and viral) in children between a third world continent (Africa), the USA and Europe. Mortality is overall 10 times higher in Africa than in the USA but nearly 60 times higher in the 1-4 year olds. Also interesting is the two fold higher mortality in children in Europe compared to the USA, at least at the beginning of the 1970s.",

HTLV-I11 has been implicated as a possible cause of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) in promiscuous homosexuals (see Chapter 14) and presumably transmission via person to person in semen might be a major factor. Table 1 .13 and Fig. 1 .5 list, rather exhaustively (but not completely), a classification of viruses causing human disease, and Table 1 .14 briefly summarizes information on currently used vaccines and chemoprophylactic agents against viral diseases. The epidemiology, strategy of replication and physical and antigenic structure of these viruses will be discussed as fully as possible in the ensuing chapters. However, a word of warning should be introduced here. DNA technology ('genetic engineering') techniques are being introduced very rapidly indeed and are expected to revolutionize the previously used biological approaches to development of new viral vaccines. The reader can safely assume that for most viruses discussed in the following chapters, even if it is not indicated in the text, that someone is cloning the particular gene into a eukaryote or prokaryote cell. It cannot be overemphasized that with both cew vaccines and antivirals the initial discovery is often made by individuals and single groups. Only during later developments are the large teams of scientists required. Also, with antivirals, a new era has arrived which is seeing the first extended use in the clinic of inhibitory molecules against viral diseases, particularly herpes. So we shall undoubtedly see a plethora of new molecules each with certain biological and pharmacological advantages compared to the parent. Indeed, we are witnessing this trend already with molecular derivatives of acyclovir such as DHPG and DHBG (Chapter 1 I).",

The cost of less severe respiratory viral diseases, such as common cold occurring on the average more than twice yearly, is probably of the same magnitude. The distress and pain caused by recurrent labial and genital herpes infections is very large, and possibly increasing. The number of patients is difficult to express in economic terms, but an estimated number of 500 000 Americans are contracting genital herpes each year and approximately 100 million episodes of labial herpes will affect the USA population each year. The impact of gastrointestinal syndromes caused by viral infection can be illustrated by an annual mortality of 5-10 million due to rotavirus infections in children in Asia, Africa and South America Many chronic conditions are initiated in infectious diseases.

However, it is now possible to apply more precise scientific analysis to the problem. Such a scientific analysis of immunization benefits in the early 1960s led to a major alteration in national health policy in the USAnamely the decision that routine smallpox vaccination should be discontinued. The last case of variola minor in the USA was in 1949 and by 1963 the risk of death from all smallpox vaccinations was 1 per million for primary vaccinees, rising to 5 per million for children under 1 year of age. In addition, among primary vaccinees the combined rate of post vaccinia1 encephalitis and vaccinia necrosum was 6.5 per million for infants. On the other hand, the probability of a smallpox importation into the USA in 1970 was 1 importation every 12 years. It would probably have required 15 smallpox importations per year to produce the same mortality which was then associated with smallpox vaccination.

Net medical care costs often include the cost of vaccine and its administration, cost of treating vaccine complications and the medical care savings due to prevention of disease. Net health benefits include reduction in morbidity and mortality. Also one may include the gains in productivity resulting from a reduction of absence at work. Other qualitative and more difficult to cost-estimate considerations must be included to place a vaccine programme in an accurate social and medical perspective e.g. pain and anguish of illness, compensation of victims of severe vaccine reactions etc. These days, quite necessarily so, political, social, economic and medical factors are all taken into account (or at least should be by national health authorities). It is an interesting and useful exercise to see how these analyses apply to 4 popular and seemingly useful viral vaccines (Willems and Sanders, 1981) .

Prevention of congenital rubella syndrome is the aim of this programme, because rubella itself is a mild disease scarcely worth considering if it were not for the teratogenic properties of the virus. The teratogenic effect of the virus is unique in its selectivity of action and most embryos of mothers infected during the first trimester would be affected. As an example of the community effects in the 1964-1965 epidemic before vaccine was introduced, 5000 therapeutic abortions were carried out and 20 000 children were born with rubella syndrome in the USA alone. Also 2100 excess prenatal deaths were associated with the epidemic. Of the 20000 children born with congenital rubella, 8000 were deaf, 3500 deaf and blind and several thousand suffered moderate to severe mental retardation. Estimated direct costs of the epidemic in the USA were $I billion, mainly (90%) as regards long term care associated with rubella syndrome. In the USA after 1969, when vaccine became widely available, the strategy was to immunize a// children as a routine, whereas adolescents and women of childbearing age were immunized selectively. In the UK, on the other hand, mainly school girls (not boys) were immunized. The basic strategy in the USA was to displace wild virulent rubella by attenuated non-teratogenic vaccine virus. A reduced objective was aimed for in the UK and the programme to date has not been so successful. In the USA, rubella epidemics have been prevented and cases of rubella have decreased continuously in the under 15 year age group. Most cases of rubella now occur among adolescents. A study of costs and benefits found positive net benefits. In 1972 the direct cost of acute rubella for 1 million persons was estimated at $2.7 million and the costs of congenital rubella syndrome in the offspring of 1 million unprotected females was $35.9 million.

Vaccination of all persons in this group would result in a lowering of HBV incidence from 23 to 4%, costing $105.12 per person. However, screening followed by immunization would cost only $66.35 (because fewer people would be immunized). In contrast, for a group of hospital employees with relatively high exposure (0.5%) and annual attack rate of 6%, vaccination without screening is the lowest cost strategy ($104.22). For a low risk population (0.1% annual attack rate) neither vaccination nor screening followed by vaccination would result in a saving in medical care costs. Indeed the net medical costs per case of hepatitis prevenfed by vaccinating the latter population would be $22469. In contrast, net medical care costs per case prevented are negative when the attack rate is greater than 5.6%. A very important caveat of the above discussion, however, is the fact that indirect costs saved by immunization, such as loss of productivity etc, are not included. If one is only interested in medical care savings then HBV vaccination should be carried out before or early during a period of unavoidable high risk as with surgical registrars, new dialysis unit patients and staff members, new prisoners, newly institutionalized mentally retarded patients, and promiscuous homosexuals.",

The incidence of the virus disease is naturally an important factor, as is the severity of the disease. The incidence can be obtained for diseases being reported in accordance with local regulations, but in many cases viral diseases are not reported and the incidence has to be calculated from different surveys. Also a grading of the severity is not easy and an example is when herpesvirus infections are handled as a group, which would include both herpes encephalitis and cold sores. Therefore, a rather subjective average has been used in Table 1. 16. An additional important factor in deciding the targets for antiviral chemotherapy is the absence or availability of good viral vaccines and the probability of developing vaccines in the future. For viruses like rhino and influenza with many serotypes or antigenic variants, vaccine production may always be a problem especially with influenza when new antigenic types appear rapidly. In the case of HSV-I and HSV-2 infections the development of a successful vaccine seems unlikely when one considers that patients with frequent episodes of labial or genital herpes have high titres of neutralizing antibodies and that reinfection can occur in spite of circulating antibodies.
