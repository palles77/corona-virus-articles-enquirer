A widely adopted approach is Critical Incident Stress Debriefing (CISD), used principally with individuals who have undergone traumatic events (Mitchell & Everly, 1995) . The debriefing process mainly involves recapitulation of the traumatic experience, sharing of symptomatic reactions, education on cognitive coping, and finally a summarization that invites positive learning from the experience. The intervention is time-critical, recommended within a relatively short timeframe (typically 1 week) after the traumatic event. Despite its popularity, efficacy researches on CISD produced mixed results so far (see e.g. Everly & Boyle, 1999; van Emmerik, Kamphuis, Hulsbosch, & Emmelkamp, 2002) .",

Instead, participants who had debriefing increased their positive self-appraisals in the one-month follow-up. This finding supported our hypothesis that the SMART debriefing can promote growth after stressful events. On the other hand, although their positive appraisal of social impact of SARS did not improve, they did not make negative appraisals as much as the control group did. This was notable comparing to the prevalent public hostility towards the government in the latter half of 2003 for their mishandling of the SARS outbreak.",
