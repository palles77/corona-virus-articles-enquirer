Total RNA was isolated from 89 biopsies (21 hyperplastic palatine tonsils, 25 adenoids, 16 chronic inflammatory palatine tonsils and 27 chronic inflammatory palatine tonsils with histological prove of acute inflammation), reverse transcribed and subjected to PCR amplifying IL-8, Gro-alpha, eotaxin-1, eotaxin-2, MCP-3, MCP-4 and RANTES. 2% agarose gel electrophoresis revealed a predominance of IL-8 in the chronic inflammatory palatine tonsil group compared to tonsillar hyperplasia. Furthermore, eotaxin-2 was strongly overexpressed in adenoid samples compared to chronic inflammatory specimens. Our data suggest that the majority of diseases related to adenoid formation are mediated via an eotaxin-2 expression, whereas chronic inflammatory tonsillitis is associated with IL-8 upregulation. These data imply that adenoids are related to a Th-2, and chronic inflammatory tonsillitis to a Th-1 based immune response.",

L'RNA \u00e8 stato isolato da 89 biopsie (21 tonsille palatine iperplastiche; 25 adenoidi; 16 tonsille con infiammazione cronica e 27 tonsille con infiammazione cronica e diagnosi istologica di infiammazione acuta), inversamente trascritto, e sottoposto ad amplificazione per IL-8, Gro-alpha, eotaxin-1, eotaxin-2, MCP-3, MCP-4 e RANTES. L'elettroforesi su gel di agarosio al 2% ha rivelato una predominanza di IL8 nel gruppo delle tonsille con infiammazione cronica rispetto al gruppo delle tonsille con iperplasia. Al contrario l'eotaxina 2 era fortemente iperespressa nel gruppo delle adenoidi, se comparata al gruppo con infiammazione cronica. I nostri dati suggeriscono che la maggior parte delle patologie correlate con la formazione delle adenoidi sono mediate dall' espressione di eotaxina 2, mentre la tonsillite cronica infiammatoria \u00e8 associata all' iperespressione di IL8. Questi dati implicano che le adenoidi sono correlate ad una risposta immunitaria Th2, mentre la tonsillite infiammatoria cronica ad una risposta Th1.",

            "text": "In 1884, Waldeyer first described an annular arrangement of lymphatic tissue at the entrance of the aerodigestive tract, which he suggested plays an important part in the host immune system, including the palatine tonsils, pharyngeal tonsil, lingual tonsils and tubal tonsils 1 . Especially the palatine as well as pharyngeal tonsils are known to play a key role in the development of the human host defense due to their location, histologic anatomy and functional capacities 2 . These structures harbour numerous different types of tissues, including epithelium, lymphoid follicles, blood vessels and connective tissues 3 4 . The combination of these different tissues as well as their anatomic arrangement in crypts facilitates optimised exposure and processing of antigens, which aid in evoking effective immune responses 5 6 . The palatine as well as the pharyngeal tonsils are secondary lymphoid organs and an integral part of the mucosa associated lymphatic tissue complex 7 . Multiplication, differentiation and stimulation of B-lymphocytes represent one of their major functions and are essential in processing the specific immune response 8 . B-lymphocytes constitute more than 50% of the tonsillar lymphocyte population, in contrast to the blood and other lymphoid organs 9 10 . The induction of the tonsillar-specific immune responses involves several distinct processes where chemokines play an integral role [11] [12] [13] [14] . Chemokines are chemotactic cytokines, which can be classified into four subgroups depending on their arrangement of amino acids, namely CXC-, CC-, C-and CX 3 C-chemokines 15 16 . CXC-chemokines, like interleukin (IL)-8 and growth-regulated peptide -alpha (GRO-alpha), are responsible for chemotaxis of neutrophils, whereas CCchemokines, like eotaxin-1, eotaxin-2, monocyte chemotactic protein (MCP)-3, MCP-4, and RANTES (Regulated upon Activation, Normal T-cell Expressed and Secreted), promote the attraction of lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils and basophils 17 . The presented work investigated the importance of different chemokines, i.e. IL-8, GRO-alpha, eotaxin-1, eotaxin-2, MCP-3, MCP-4 and RANTES in tonsillar inflammatory disease and tonsil hyperplasia.",

Samples were retrieved during surgery after written patient consent was obtained, in accordance with the ethical commission of the Christian-Albrechts-University of Kiel, subjected to the 1975 Helsinki Declaration. Tissue samples were divided into four subgroups, based on origin, patient past medical history, clinical presentation and histologic diagnosis established by certified pathologists of the University of Schleswig-Holstein, Campus Kiel. The subgroups included 21 hyperplastic palatine tonsils, 25 adenoids, 16 chronic inflammatory palatine tonsils and 27 chronic inflammatory palatine tonsils with histologic signs of acute inflammation as per presence of cryptal ulcerations and leukocyte infiltration. At the time of procedure, the median of age for each subgroup was 6, 5, 26, and 7, respectively.

            "text": "Waldeyer's tonsillar ring acts as the first line of immune defence against microbes, entering the body nasally or orally. Especially in children, the immunogenic properties of the palatine tonsils are of particular importance. Chemokines are small signalling proteins, whose expression in various tissues is variably regulated during immune responses as well as acute and chronic infection. Previous studies have suggested a functional role for chemokines in hepatitis, colitis, pancreatitis, asthma and various malignancies as well as acute and chronic infections of the upper aerodigestive tract [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] . Most chemokines are only produced and secreted upon appropriate stimulation of cells by bacterial or viral products 24 . In cases of acute and chronically infected tonsils, accumulation of certain subsets of chemokines and neutrophilic dynamics has been observed 25 . IL-8 has been described to be very potent in neutrophil activation and migration 26 27 . Our data shows significant overexpression of IL-8 in chronic inflammatory tonsillar disease. Since IL-8 expression has been reported to be effectively stimulated by TNF-a und IL-1\u00df for neutrophil chemotaxis as well as activity, our data suggests that a Th1 response is predominatly involved in the pathogenesis of chronic tonsillitis. Both IL-8 and GRO-\u03b1 are known to be synthesised by neutrophils and fibroblasts in response to various stimuli 28 29 . In vitro, IL-1\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1 seem to be potent stimulators of chemokine production, whereas IFN-\u03b3 inhibits their production 18 . GRO-alpha is further produced by endothelial cells, fibroblasts and monocytes after stimulation with lipopolysaccharide, IL-1 or TNF-\u03b1 in vitro. In addition, it induces neutrophil accumulation and chemotaxis 29 . In our data however, GRO-alpha was not significantly overexpressed in chronic tonsillar diseases. Tonsillar hyperplasia appears to be a result of increased proliferation of lymphoid tissue predominantly triggered by bacterial infections. Previously, tonsil size has been shown to be directly proportional to the mean bacterial load 30 . The kind of bacteria found in hyperplastic tonsils does not seem to greatly differ from those in recurrently active infected tonsils. However, Haemophilus infection, besides Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes appears to be more common in tonsillar hyperplasia 30 . Our investigations demonstrate that hyperplastic tonsillitis is characterised by an acute inflammatory chemokine pattern as IL-8 expression on mRNA levels correlates with the presence of actively infected tissue. IL-8 expression was significantly elevated in acutely infected tissue compared to hyperplastic tonsils (p < 0.01), and in adenoids and chronic tonsillitis compared to hyperplastic tonsils (p < 0.05). Therefore, as IL-8 is an acute phase chemokine expressed in chronic tonsillitis, this suggests an inflammatory process in the pathogenesis of chronic tonsillitis. An elevation of IL-8 in acute infections has been described previously 31 32 , and therefore anticipated for tonsillar dis-ease. However there have been studies showing an equal expression of IL-8 in hyperplastic tonsils and chronic tonsillitis 33 . Another reason for a high expression of this chemokine in chronic and hyperplastic disease could be its additional extensive effect on cell proliferation 34 . A similar result would have been expected for the expression of GRO-alpha, since this chemokine also plays an important role in host immune defence by conveying chemotaxis and activation of neutrophils, similar to IL-8. However, in our data, mRNA expression levels of GROalpha were not significantly elevated in acute nor chronic tonsillitis compared to tonsillar hyperplasia. MCP 1-4, RANTES, eotaxin, eotaxin-2 und eotaxin-3 are CC-chemokines. RANTES is a selective attractant for T-cell and monocytes migration 35 . Proinflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-a or IL-1\u00df, have been described to be some of the most potent stimulators of RANTES expression. Furthermore, a combination of TNF-a and INFc strongly stimulate production of RANTES 36 . Another important function of RANTES is its ability to enhance the mucosal as well as systemic humoral production of antibodies, via an elevation of the production of IFN-c-, IL-2-, IL-5-and IL-6, and further an induction of co-stimulatory molecules as well as expression of cytokine receptors for CD 4 + T cells 37 . In our data, RANTES expression was evident in all subgroups analysed with no significant differences in relative mRNA expression levels within these groups. Eotaxin-2 is also described to be a potent chemoattractor for eosinophils in vitro and in vivo 38 39 . In eosinophils, eotaxin-2 causes a dose-dependent increase of the production of free radicals, mobilisation of intracellular calcium and upregulation of CD11b 40 . Eotaxin-2 expression was evident in all analysed subgroups with a significant upregulation in adenoids, suggesting an involvement of Th2-immune responses as eotaxin-2 which is known to play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of atopic diseases involving Th 2-cell activation 41 . Significant upregulation of eotaxin-2 has been observed in bronchial asthma 42 and allergic rhinitis 43 . However, the significance of eotaxin-2 expression in lymphatic tissue of the Waldeyer's tonsillar ring still largely remains uncertain, like their role in the maturation of the adaptive immune system in the mucosa of the upper aerodigestive tract. However, it is remarkable that eotaxin-2 as well as RANTES are constitutively expressed in the mucosa of the gastrointestinal tract, an organ with distinctive antigen contact, such as Waldeyer`s tonsilar ring 44 45 .",
