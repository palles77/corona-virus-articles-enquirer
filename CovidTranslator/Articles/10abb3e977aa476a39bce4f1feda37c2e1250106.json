We developed 12 primary bat cell lines from seven bat species, including 30 Tylonycteris pachypus, Pipistrellus abramus and Rhinolophus sinicus (hosts of Tylonycteris-31 BatCoV HKU4, Pipistrellus-BatCoV HKU5 and SARS-related-CoV respectively), and tested 32 their susceptibilities to MERS-CoVs, SARS-CoV and human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E). 33 Five cell lines, including P. abramus and R. sinicus but not T. pachypus cells, were susceptible 34 to human MERS-CoV EMC/2012. However, three tested camel MERS-CoV strains showed 35 different infectivities, with only two strains capable of infecting three and one cell lines 36 respectively. SARS-CoV can only replicate in R. sinicus cells, while HCoV-229E cannot 37 replicate in any bat cells. Bat dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) sequences were closely related to 38 those of human and non-human primates but distinct from dromedary DPP4 sequence. Critical 39 residues for binding to MERS-CoV spike protein were mostly conserved in bat DPP4. DPP4 40 was expressed in the five bat cells susceptible to MERS-CoV, with significantly higher mRNA 41 expression levels than those in non-susceptible cells (P=0.0174), supporting that DPP4 42 expression is critical for MERS-CoV infection in bats. However, overexpression of T. pachypus 43 DPP4 failed to confer MERS-CoV susceptibility in T. pachypus cells, suggesting other cellular 44 factors in determining viral replication. The broad cellular tropism of MERS-CoV should 45 prompt further exploration of host diversity of related viruses to identify its ancestral origin. 46 47 All rights reserved.

SARSr-CoVs in bats were shown to 210 utilize the SARS-CoV receptor, human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2), for cell 211 entry (67). Similar to SARS-CoV, HCoV-229E is likely to have originated from bats. CoVs 212 closely related to HCoV-229E have been detected in bats of the genus Hipposideros in Africa 213 (68). More recently, CoVs even closer to HCoV-229E were identified in dromedary camels in 214 the Middle East, which were able to utilize the receptor of HCoV-229E, human aminopeptidase 215 N (hAPN) for cell entry (69). This suggests that dromedary camels may have served as 216 intermediate hosts for bat-to-human transmission of HCoV-229E, which may be analogous to 217 the evolution of MERS-CoV. Recently, a CoV, closely related to HCoV-NL63 in most genome 218 regions except the spike protein, was detected from a bat of the genus Triaenops in Kenya (70). 219 However, further studies are required to identify even closer relatives of HCoV-NL63 to 220 ascertain its possible bat origin. In contrast to SARSr-CoVs and HCoV-229E which were 221 mainly found in horseshoe and roundleaf bats respectively, a more diverse host range was 222 observed in lineage C betacoronaviruses. Yet, the different bat species harboring lineage C 223 betacoronaviruses all belonged to the family Vespertilionidae. Specifically, Ty-BatCoV HKU4, 224 including cells from Hipposideros.

Since 115 lineage C betacoronaviruses closely related to MERS-CoV were detected in bats, we developed 116 12 diverse primary bat cell lines from seven different bat species, including Hipposideros 117 pomona, Miniopterus pusillus, Myotis ricketti, Pipistrellus abramus (the host of Pi-BatCoV 118 HKU5), Rhinolophus sinicus (the host of SARSr-BatCoV and Rs-BatCoV HKU2), Tylonycteris 119 pachypus (the host of Ty-BatCoV HKU4), Rousettus leschenaultii (the host of many viruses 120 including Ro-BatCoV HKU9), which were subject to infection with MERS-CoV at multiplicity 121 of infection (MOI) of 1. Viral titers were determined by RT-qPCR on day 5 p.i.. Five of the 12 122 cell lines (M. ricketti lung, P. abramus kidney, R. sinicus kidney and lung, and R. leschenaulti 123 kidney cells) propagated MERS-CoV with at least one log 10 increase in viral load. The highest 124 increase in viral load was observed in R. sinicus kidney and lung cells, which was comparable 125 to that observed in Vero cells (Fig. 1). Cytopathic effects (CPEs) were observed in infected M. three other MERS-CoV strains isolated from camels in Dubai, D998/15 (belonging to clade A2, M. ricketti lung supported infection by both D1189.1/15 and D1271.1/15; while R. 139 sinicus lung and R. leschenaulti kidney supported infection by D1189.1/15, with at least one 140 log 10 increase in viral load. None of the cells supported infection by D998/15 (Fig. 1). 141 SARS-CoV can replicate in R. sinicus cells. Since Chinese horseshoe bats are the 142 major reservoir of SARS-related-CoVs, we also tested the 12 bat cell lines, including R. sinicus 143 cells, for susceptibility to a clinical strain of SARS-CoV. SARS-CoV strain HKU-39849 can 144 replicate in R. sinicus kidney but not lung cells, with at least one log 10 increase in viral load (Fig. 145 3A). The other bat cells did not support SARS-CoV infection. 146 HCoV-229E cannot replicate in bat cells. The 12 bat cells were also tested for 147 susceptible to HCoV-229E infection.

Previous 186 studies have shown that MERS-CoV can infect cell lines from different animals including cells 187 from various bat species (54-58). However, bat cells from host species of MERS-Co-V-related 188 viruses, such as T. pachypus and P. abramus which harbor Ty-BatCoV HKU4 and Pi-BatCoV 189 HKU5 respectively, were not included in these studies. In this study, MERS-CoV EMC/2012 190 was able to replicate in cells from four different bat genera/species belonging to three different 191 bat families including Pteropodidae, Rhinolophidae and Vespertilionidae. None of these bat 192 cells were previously reported to support MERS-CoV replication. While lineage C 193 betacoronaviruses have not been detected in bats outside the Vespertionionidae family, such 194 diverse cellular tropism should prompt further studies to explore the host diversity of this group Interestingly, MERS-CoV showed the highest replicative ability in cells from R. sinicus. This 199 suggests that MERS-CoV may potentially infect this bat species which is also the natural 200 reservoir of SARSr-CoVs and animal origin of SARS-CoV (27, 29). Nevertheless, three other 201 MERS-CoV strains belonging to either clade A2 or B3 showed differential replicative abilities 202 in the five bat cell lines that were susceptible to EMC/2012 strain (clade A1), with strain 203 D998/15 (clade A2) unable to replicate in all five tested cell lines. This may suggest that 204 different MERS-CoV strains could possess different cellular tropism and host range. 205",

While the inability of MERS-CoV to replicate in 239 T. pachypus cells may be partly explained by the lack of DPP4 expression, over-expression of 240 Tp-DPP4 was unable to confer viral susceptibility. Further studies are required to study the 241 receptor-binding interphase between MERS-CoV and Tp-DPP4 and whether other cellular 242 factors may play a role in determining viral replicative abilities in T. pachypus cells, which may 243 offer further insights into the evolutionary origin and mechanisms of interspecies transmission 244 of MERS-CoV. Interestingly, one of the critical residues for binding to MERS-CoV spike 245 protein, R336, was only conserved in T. pachypus and H. pomona DPP4 (cells from these two 246 species did not support MERS-CoV replication), but not in the other four sequenced bat DPP4 247 (cells from these four species supported MERS-CoV replication). This suggests that this residue 248 may be less important for receptor binding.

The construct was transfected into 325 293FT cells together with ViraPower Packaging Mix (Invitrogen) using Lipofectamine 2000 326 (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, USA). Lentivirus was harvested from the supernatant and 327 concentrated using PEG-it (System Biosciences, Palo Alto, USA). T. pachypus cells resistant to 328 MERS-CoV were transduced using the concentrated lentivirus for tpDPP4 overexpression and 329 were subsequently subjected to inoculation with 1 MOI of MERS-CoV. 330 Nucleotide sequence accession numbers.

On the other hand, residue R336 of 163 hDPP4 was only conserved in T. pachypus and H. pomona, both not susceptible to MERS-CoV 164 RT-qPCR of bat DPP4 mRNA in the corresponding bat cells was performed to 166 determine the mRNA expression levels. Results showed that DPP4 mRNA was expressed in all 167 the five bat cells that were susceptible to MERS-CoV infection, while it was also expressed in 168 H. pomona kidney and R. leschenaulti lung cells which were not susceptible to MERS-CoV 169 infection. The mRNA expression level in P. abramus kidney (susceptible to MERS-CoV) wasbetween mock and Tp-DPP4-overexpressed cells(Fig. 6), suggesting that over-expression of 182Tp-DPP4 does not confer MERS-CoV susceptibility to T. pachypus cells. 183 All rights reserved.
