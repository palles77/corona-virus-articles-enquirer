We evaluated the capability of disinfectants to both inactivate PEDV and sufficiently damage viral RNA beyond RT-PCR detection. Five classes of disinfectants (phenol, quaternary ammonium compound, sodium hypochlorite, oxidizing agent, and quaternary ammonium/glutaraldehyde combination) were evaluated in vitro at varying concentrations, both in the presence and absence of swine feces, and at three different temperatures. No infectious PEDV was recovered after treatment with evaluated disinfectants. Additionally, all tested disinfectants except for 0.17% sodium hypochlorite dramatically reduced qRT-PCR values. However, no disinfectants eliminated RT-PCR detection of PEDV across all replicates; although, 0.52%, 1.03% and 2.06% solutions of sodium hypochlorite and 0.5% oxidizing agent did intermittently produce RT-PCR negatives. To simulate field conditions in a second aim, PEDV was applied to pitted aluminum coupons, which were then treated with either 2.06% sodium hypochlorite or 0.5% oxidizing agent. Post-treatment surface swabs of the coupons tested RT-PCR positive but were not infectious to cultured cells or na\u00efve pigs. Ultimately, viable PEDV was not detected following application of each of the tested disinfectants, however in most cases RT-PCR detection of viral RNA remained. RT-PCR detection of PEDV is likely even after disinfection with many commercially available disinfectants.",

Contaminated transportation equipment has been linked to the spread of several other important swine diseases (porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus, Salmonella, and Escherichia coli) making trailer disinfection common among United States pork producers (Dee et al., 2004 (Dee et al., , 2006 Rajkowski et al., 1998) . Efficient disinfection for PEDV in animal contact spaces, including trailers and trucks, is currently one of the primary methods used to control the spread of the disease.",

            "text": "However, PEDV is difficult to culture outside of an animal model; thus, RT-PCR assays are currently the only tests available to pork producers and swine veterinarians to directly detect PEDV. Because RT-PCR only detects the viral nucleic acid, a positive RT-PCR result only indicates detection of PEDV viral RNA, but does not mean viable and infectious virus is present. Due to the limited testing options and the implications of environmental contamination, individuals are using RT-PCR to test trailers following disinfection to ensure that the equipment is free of PEDV before contact with na\u00efve animals. However, RT-PCR tends to underestimate disinfection efficacy compared to infectivity assays; meaning, RT-PCR positive results are obtained when in fact the trailer has been effectively disinfected. This drawback of RT-PCR has been recognized for various pathogens (Pecson et al., 2011; Poschetto et al., 2007; Suarez et al., 2003) , as most disinfectants damage the protective capsid, but often, this mode of action has limited or no effect on the viral nucleic acid (Pecson et al., 2009) . Although the disinfection treatments result in loss of infectivity, RT-PCR can still detect the intact viral RNA that remains within a noninfectious viral particle. While rapid progress is being made on viral culture methods, there is an immediate need for practical solutions to address the discrepancy between RT-PCR and infectivity assays. In practical terms, pork producers must consider all RT-PCR positive trailers as contaminated; the consequences of not doing so could be disastrous to their operation and the entire swine industry. However, the cost associated with extra cleaning and disinfection and additional time until a trailer tests negative is very expensive for pork producers.",

Data from other pathogens indicate that some disinfectants (e.g., accelerated peroxide-based compounds and/or sodium hypochlorite) would better disrupt the viral RNA and produce more meaningful RT-PCR results (Charrel et al., 2001; Ma et al., 1994; Ojeh et al., 1995; Suarez et al., 2003) .

A cell-cultureadapted PEDV strain (PC22A) was used for all experiments in the present study (Oka et al., 2014) . One mililiter (1 \u00c210 6 TCID 50 /ml) of PEDV suspension was added to each petri dish and spread evenly to cover the surface of each dish using a sterile cell spreader. Dulbecco's modified eagle medium (DMEM) with 7 ug/ml trypsin, 1% penicillin-streptomycin, and 0.3% tryptose phosphate broth was used as the negative control. The inoculum was allowed to dry completely in each petri dish in biosafety cabinets. Once dry, the dishes were incubated for 15 min at the selected temperature. After the incubation, 1 ml of each disinfectant was added to its respectively labeled petri dishes and spread evenly with a spreader. All disinfectants were allowed to dry in open petri dishes in biosafety cabinets (60 min). Once the disinfectants were dry, the lids were replaced on the petri dishes and the dishes were incubated for 15 min at the selected temperature. Double distilled Table 1 Disinfectants and concentrations tested against a tissue culture adapted porcine epidemic diarrhea virus strain in both cell culture media and 10% (v/v) swine feces slurry. Testing was performed in triplicate resulting in 72 samples for each temperature tested. This procedure was replicated for each temperature (37 C, 4 C and \u00c020 C) for a grand total of 216 samples. water was used as the sham disinfectant for the positive and negative controls. A polyester-tipped swab (Catalog number: 23-400-111, Fisher Scientific, Pittsburg, PA) was pre-moistened in collection medium (DMEM with 7 ug/ml trypsin, 1% penicillinstreptomycin, and 0.3% tryptose phosphate broth mixed l:1 with Dey-Engley neutralizing broth) prior to swabbing the respective petri dish. Each petri dish was swabbed in a \"W\" pattern following the 5 marks on each petri dish, rotated 90 clockwise, and swabbed in a \"W\" pattern again with the same swab. The swabs were then placed into 1 ml of collection medium, immediately vortexed, and incubated at room temperature (21 C) for 30 min to allow the neutralizing broth time to deactivate any residual disinfectant. One hundred microliters of each sample was used for RNA extraction using the MagMAX TM -96 Viral RNA Isolation kit and the MagMax TM Express Magnetic Particle Processor (Applied Biosystems, Foster, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions for a 50 ml elution volume. Following extraction, the RNA was subjected to real-time RT-PCR using a one-step multiplex QRT-PCR kit (Life Technologies Grand Island, NY. Path ID kit [cat#4442135]) in a 25 ml reaction mixture containing 12.5 ml 2\u00c2 Multiplex buffer, 1.25 ml of the enzyme mix, 4.312 ml water, 1 ml of 5 mM probe, 0.469 ml of 40 mM forward primer, 0.469 ml of 40 mM reverse primer, and 5 ml extracted RNA. The primers and probes targeting the partial N gene were previously described . The reactions were performed on a QPCR system (Life Technologies 7500 Fast Real-Time PCR System) under the following thermocycling conditions: Stage 1-48 C for 10 min, Stage 2-95 C for 10 min, and Stage 3-45 cycles of 95 C for 15 s and 60 C for 40 s. Cycle threshold (Ct) values were calculated for each sample by setting the threshold at 5% of the positive control at cycle 40; samples with a Ct of 40 were considered positive. A standard curve of the estimated TCID 50 was generated for each RT-PCR run by making 10 fold dilutions of the positive control standard to estimate the TCID 50 value of each positive sample. Briefly, 100 ml of stock PEDV was included with each batch of samples and 5 ml of the extracted RNA was used undiluted as the starting point in the standard curve. Five additional 10-fold dilutions were generated to give a standard curve range of 1 \u00c210 4 to 0.1 TCID 50 . Estimated TCID 50 values were calculated based off the standard curves generated with each RT-PCR run from the stock virus extracted with samples each time. Estimated TCID 50 values were used for ease of comparison to actual TCID 50 values obtained from the positive controls. Estimated TCID 50 values from qRT-PCR were log (1 + x) transformed prior to comparison.",

Despite a number of medically important human and animal coronaviruses, the mechanisms of action for disinfectants against these viruses are poorly understood. Perhaps the best supported mechanism is for glutaraldehyde where the chemical is believed to react with amino or sulfhydryl groups in capsid proteins, thereby damaging the capsid and inactivating the virus (McDonnell and Russell, 1999) .

The results from the in vitro experiments in the plastic petri dishes did not translate perfectly to the aluminum coupons. One possible explanation for these discrepancies is the pitted surface of the aluminum coupons. Following treatment with 5% acetic acid, the surface of the aluminum was rough and pitted. We hypothesize that these surface irregularities may have harbored inactive virus particles and that this situation is likely common in used livestock trailers. It is also important to note that the entire 108.16 cm 2 surface of the aluminum coupons were swabbed, whereas only 47.8 cm 2 of the petri dishes were swabbed.

Aim 2 confirmed the inactivation of the PEDV with 2.06% sodium hypochlorite and 0.5% oxidizing as no pigs became infected after challenge with material collected after either of the two treatments. While all disinfectants tested in the current study prevented the virological detection of PEDV, RT-PCR detection of residual inactivated virus was common after disinfection with most of these disinfectants. Several classes of disinfectants are known to cause little or no damage to nucleic acid. In fact, investigators have used phenolic disinfectants to biologically inactivate influenza A virus in order to safely ship non-infectious, but still PCR detectable material, between laboratories for quality assurance testing (Spackman and Suarez, 2005) . Proper cleaning and surface preparation is critical to the success of any disinfection protocol. Organic material is known to inactivate many classes of disinfectants. Interestingly, presence of the fecal slurry did not impact the total number of RT-PCR positives in the present study. It is important to note that the cell culture medium used in the present study contained many organic compounds necessary for Vero cell growth; thus, even the samples generated in the absence of the fecal slurry may have contained significant disinfectant inhibitors. The present study is also limited by a very small sample size.",

In both objectives of the current study, we allowed the applied solutions to fully dry before proceeding to the next step of the protocol because most field disinfection protocols allow for complete drying following application of disinfectants. Complete drying took as long as 90 min in some situations and this impacted the temperature of the substrates (i.e., temperature changed during drying in the biosafety cabinets). Thus, the results of the 4 C and \u00c020 C are likely overestimating the effectiveness of the disinfectants at those temperatures because colder temperatures will increase drying time and are known to have a negative effect on disinfectant activity (Shaker et al., 1986; Vaneseltine and Rahn, 1949) . This limitation was unavoidable because the procedures had to be performed in a biosafety cabinet to maintain biocontainment of PEDV. Despite this limitation, we still observed temperature dependent differences in the data (Table 2) .",

            "text": "Because most PEDV strains do not grow in cell culture, the pork industry must rely upon RT-PCR for testing. Results of the present study indicate that certain oxidizing agents and sodium hypochlorite are most likely to produce negative RT-PCR results. Caution must be exercised when considering field application of these results. The very strong concentration of sodium hypochlorite (2.06%), the most effective in our study, is a serious hazard to human health (Racioppi et al., 1994) . Contact with bare skin can result in chemical burns and inhalation of sodium hypochlorite irritates the respiratory tract and can cause pulmonary edema in some situations (Hostynek et al., 1990; Luttrell, 2001) . Additionally, sodium hypochlorite will lead to corrosion of metal equipment and deterioration of rubber objects (Babb et al., 1980) . Ultimately, all disinfectants tested herein inactivated PEDV but few prevented RT-PCR detection of viral RNA. RT-PCR detection of PEDV is likely even after disinfection with many commercially available disinfectants. Pork producers attempting to disinfect transportation equipment should take steps whenever possible to properly clean the equipment prior to disinfectant application, increase the ambient temperature of the equipment, and use an appropriate disinfectant according to labeled directions.",
