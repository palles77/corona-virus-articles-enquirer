            "text": "The reversible conjugation of ubiquitin and ubiquitin-like (UbL) proteins to protein substrates plays a critical role in the regulation of many cellular pathways. The removal of ubiquitin from target proteins is performed by ubiquitin proteases also known as deubiquitylases (DUBs). Owing to their substrate specificity and the central role ubiquitylation plays in cell signaling pathways, DUB are attractive targets for therapeutic development. The development of DUB inhibitors requires assays that are amenable to high-throughput screening and provide rapid assessment of inhibitor selectivity. Determination of inhibitor selectivity at an early stage of drug discovery will reduce drug failure in the clinic as well as reduce overall drug development costs. We have developed two novel assays, UbL-Enterokinase light chain and UbL-Granzyme B, for quantifying ubiquitin and UbL protease activity. In our quest to discover and characterize novel chemical entities, we have combined these assays with a previously developed assay in a multiplex format. This multiplex format allows for the detection of three distinct protease activities simultaneously, in a single well. We have demonstrated that the multiplex format is able to distinguish between selective and nonselective protease inhibitors. Specifically, we have used this assay format to characterize P022077, a selective ubiquitin-specific protease 7 inhibitor discovered at Progenra.",

            "text": "biquitin is a small protein that is covalently conjugated to specific lysine residues in target proteins, thereby regulating the target protein's function, localization, or stability. [1] [2] [3] In addition to ubiquitin, several ubiquitin-like (UbL) proteins have been described. SUMO (small ubiquitin-like modifer) is the founding member of the UbL protein family; others include ISG15 (interferon stimulated gene 15) and NEDD8 (neural precursor cell expressed developmentally down-regulated protein 8). 4 The reversible conjugation of ubiquitin and UbL proteins to target proteins regulates a plethora of cellular processes. All of these proteins utilize a similar enzymatic process for conjugation to target proteins. With respect to ubiquitin, the C-terminal glycine residue of the mature ubiquitin protein is conjugated to the e-amino-group of lysine residues via a multistep, multienzyme pathway. 5 This results in attachment of a single ubiquitin moiety to the target protein, which is referred to as mono-ubiquitylation. Mono-ubiquitylation of target proteins can alter their function and/or localization. 6, 7 Additional ubiquitins can be attached to the first ubiquitin, forming poly-ubiquitin chains. These chains can be formed via several lysine residues present in ubiquitin. Extension of poly-ubiquitin chains from all the lysines in ubiquitin has been observed in cells. 8, 9 The best characterized polyubiquitin chains are those built via lysine 48 of ubiquitin. Lysine 48-linked chains target proteins for degradation by the ubiquitin proteasome. 10 The exact function of these various chains on target proteins is an area of intense interest and recent research suggests that chains that are not lysine 48-linked may also target proteins for degradation. 11 Interestingly, of the UbL proteins, only SUMO has been demonstrated to form chains in vivo. 12, 13 SUMOylation of proteins does not target proteins for degradation, but functions primarily to regulate the activity and localization of proteins, most notably transcription factors. 14, 15 NEDDylation of proteins regulates the activity of substrates and is essential for the activation of the SCF family of ubiquitin E3 ligases, exemplifying the interactions among the various ubiquitin/UbL pathways. 16, 17 The conjugation of ubiquitin or UbL proteins can be reversed by a family of proteases collectively referred to as deubiquitylases (DUBs). 18 This family of enzymes can be further subdivided into five classes: ubiquitin C-terminal Hydrolase; Ubiquitin-specific protease (USP); JAMM ( JAB1/MPN/Mov34 motif metalloprotease); Machado-Josephin Domain containing protease; and Ovarian Tumor related domain containing protease proteases. 18, 19 Bioinformatic analysis of the human genome has identified *100 genes encoding DUBs. 19 Dysregulation of isopeptidases has been linked to a variety of disease states. 20, 21 It is clear that DUB activity is responsible for regulating many vital cell functions. 22 Additionally, researchers have begun to identify viral and bacterial proteins that can cleave ubiquitin from ubiquitylated proteins and many of these enzymes have a direct impact on the viability and/or virulence of the pathogenic agent. [23] [24] [25] For these reasons there is a growing effort to target these enzymes for therapeutic development. The discovery and characterization of selective isopeptidase inhibitors requires robust assay systems for quantifying enzyme activity and rapidly characterizing inhibitors.",

To address this disparity we developed a novel assay featuring ubiquitin attached via a peptide bond to an enzyme, rendering the enzyme inactive. After specific hydrolysis of the proteinubiquitin bond, the enzyme is activated.",

These assays involve the fusion of ubiquitin or UbL to the N-terminus of enterokinase light chain (EK L ) or granzyme B (GZMB). The newly developed reporters offer a number of benefits. For example, the SUMO3-EK L fusion protein can be efficiently cleaved by sub-picomolar concentrations of SENP2core. Moreover, these assays can be combined with the ubiquitin-PLA 2 reporter system in a multiplex format, which has allowed us to rapidly determine the substrate specificity of DUBs. Specifically, we have discovered that USP21 can cleave both ubiquitin and ISG15 conjugates in vitro. In addition we have used the multiplex enzyme format to characterize two novel isopeptidase inhibitors, PR-619 and P022077. The novel reporter systems will play an important role in the characterization of ubiquitin/UbL isopeptidases and the development of selective isopeptidase inhibitors as potential therapeutic agents.",

Incubation with an ubiquitin/UbL isopeptidase results in cleavage of the a-peptide bond between the ubiquitin/UbL and PLA 2 resulting in the activation of PLA 2 , which can be measured using a quenched fluorescent substrate of PLA 2 . 28, 29 In addition to PLA 2 , EK L and GZMB require a free N-terminus for enzymatic activity. [31] [32] [33] We generated plasmids encoding SUMO3 fused to the N-terminus of the active forms of EK L and GZMB and expressed and purified the fusion proteins. As predicted, these fusion proteins were catalytically inactive. To determine if these fusions could be cleaved by isopeptidases, we incubated them with the core catalytic domain of the deSUMOylase SENP2. Upon activation, EK L will cleave an internally quenched fluorescence resonance energy transfer peptide resulting in an increase in fluorescence. As shown in Figure 1 , incubation of SENP2 with SUMO3-EK L and the EK L substrate resulted in a dramatic increase in fluorescence due to SENP2 mediated cleavage of the a-peptide bond between SUMO3 and EK L . In a similar manner, incubation of SUMO3-GZMB with SENP2 resulted in the activation of GZMB, which cleaved its substrate IEPD-AMC, leading to the release of AMC fluorophore and a concomitant increase in AMC fluorescence. In both cases the rate at which fluorescence increased depended on SENP2 concentration, demonstrating that these assays can be used to quantify deSUMOylase activity. The SUMO3-EK L system can reach a plateau within the time frame of this assay, whereas the SUMO3-GZMB signal remains linear throughout the course of the experiment. This is most likely caused by the difference in the amount of reporter substrate used in these assays. The EK L substrate is present at only 20 nM, whereas the GZMB substrate is present at 5 mM.",

The lack of spectral overlap of the fluorophores utilized is shown in Supplementary Figure  S2 . Before demonstrating that these reporter systems could be measured simultaneously in a single well, we optimized the concentrations of the assay components to yield a high SNR for each isopeptidase/ reporter combination (data not shown). Subsequently, we combined 100 nM of each reporter (SUMO3-GZMB, ubiquitin-PLA 2 , and NEDD8-EK L ) with appropriate concentrations of their substrates (Fig. 3A) . When all three UbL isopeptidases were added, an increase in fluorescence intensity was observed corresponding to the activation of each reporter substrate. To verify that these signals were dependent upon the presence of the cognate isopeptidase, we repeated this experiment including, in addition to the complete reaction containing all three ubiquitin isopeptidases, controls lacking one of the isopeptidases (Fig. 3A) . Figure  3B shows that the signal generated by NEDD8-EK L was completely dependent on the presence of DEN1. Similar results were obtained when omitting the other isopeptidases (Fig. 3A) . To further validate this system for high-throughput screening (HTS), we calculated the SNR and Z \u00a2 value for each reporter system in this multiplex format. Each reporter yielded a Z \u00a2 >0.5 and an SNR >10, indicating that the assay format is robust and reproducible (Fig. 3C) . To confirm that additional combinations of reporters were useable in a HTS multiplex format, we also validated the multiplex format utilizing SUMO3-GZMB, ubiquitin-PLA 2 , and ISG15-EK L (data not shown).

Characterizing the substrate specificity of novel isopeptidases is an important first step in determining the physiological role of the proteases. We have already demonstrated that USP7, SENP2, and DEN1 generate signals only with their cognate UbLs, Ubiquitin, SUMO3, and NEDD8, respectively. In our efforts to characterize the USP class of enzymes, we expressed and purified USP21 and tested the activity of 100 nM of USP21 with SUMO3-GZMB, ubiquitin-PLA 2 , and ISG15-EK L and the respective substrates of these reporter enzymes in our multiplex format. For standardization purposes we included a control isopeptidase for each reporter and set the signal generated by the control isopeptidase to 100%. Control isopeptidase concentrations were selected based on similar rates of increasing fluorescent intensity, thus standardizing the assays between different UbLs. As expected, USP21 exhibited a robust signal with Ubiquitin-PLA 2 and negligible activity with SUMO3-GZMB (Fig. 4A) .",

This probe covalently modifies the active site cysteine residue of deNEDDylases rendering the enzyme inactive. Initially, we determined the IC 50 of these compounds versus SENP2, USP7, and DEN1 individually ( Table 1) . Subsequently, dose ranges of PR-619 were preincubated with SENP2, USP7, and DEN1 simultaneously before addition of all three reporters and their substrates and measurement of enzyme activity (Fig. 5A) . From these experiments it is clear that PR-619 is a nonselective isopeptidase inhibitor with IC 50 values ranging from 4 to 16 mM for the three enzymes tested. In contrast, NEDD8-VS selectively inhibited DEN1 in both the singleplex and multiplex formats ( Table 1) . As seen in Figure 5C , P022077 had negligible activity versus DEN1 and SENP2core over the concentration range tested, but inhibited USP7 with an IC 50 of 8 mM. Comparison of the singleplexed and multiplexed data in Table 1 clearly demonstrates that the multiplex format does not dramatically alter the IC 50 values or the selectivity of these inhibitors, validating the use of this multiplex format for the characterization of isopeptidase inhibitors.",

Ubiquitin and UbL isopeptidases are key regulators in multiple cellular signaling cascades and they represent a novel class of target for therapeutic development. 20, 34, 35 We have described two new reporter systems, UbL-EK L and UbL-GZMB. These reporter fusions are efficiently cleaved by ubiquitin/ UbL proteases and are useful for quantifying activity. Additionally, by selecting reporter enzyme substrates that generate fluorescent signals in nonoverlapping discreet wavelength ranges, one can combine them with the UbL-PLA 2 reporter system in a multiplex format. This multiplexed format affords the measurement of three distinct protease activities simultaneously in a single well. We have demonstrated the utility of multiplexing enzyme assays for the characterization of enzyme specificity. In addition, we confirmed that USP21 is a DUB and simultaneously uncovered a previously unreported deISGylase activity of this enzyme. To date, only one other mammalian isopeptidase, USP18, has been shown to function as a deISGylase. The multiplex format is not able to To measure the activity of all three reporters in a single well, three isopeptidases are added to SUMO3-GZMB, ubiquitin-PLA2, and NEDD8-EK L .

In addition to these targets, ubiquitin and UbL isopeptidases are considered potential drug targets. One major concern in the development of isopeptidase inhibitors is selectivity within a protease family. In the case of ubiquitin isopeptidases it will be advantageous to determine the selectivity of an inhibitor at an early stage to rapidly exclude nonselective inhibitors from the development process.
