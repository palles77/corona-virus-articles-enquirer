In 1934, Formhals 2 described the operation of electrospinning in a US patent for the first time; but only since 1990s it has gained substantial attention. The process attracted rapidly growing interests in the past two decades triggered by potential Increasing demands for ever more sensitive sensors for global environmental monitoring, food inspection and medical diagnostics have led to an upsurge of interests in nanostructured materials such as nanofibers and nanowebs. Electrospinning exhibits the unique ability to produce diverse forms of fibrous assemblies. The remarkable specific surface area and high porosity bring electrospun nanomaterials highly attractive to ultrasensitive sensors and increasing importance in other nanotechnological applications. In this review, we summarize recent progress in developments of the electrospun nanomaterials with applications in some predominant sensing approaches such as acoustic wave, resistive, photoelectric, optical, amperometric, and so on, illustrate with examples how they work, and discuss their intrinsic fundamentals and optimization designs. We are expecting the review to pave the way for developing more sensitive and selective nanosensors. (BD) and mwang@lanl.gov (MW) Open access under CC BY-NC-ND license.",

            "text": "In a typical electrospinning process, the surface of a hemispherical liquid drop suspended in equilibrium at the tip of a capillary will be distorted into a conical shape in the presence of an external electric field 8 . When the electric field is sufficiently strong, charges on the droplet surface will overcome the surface tension to induce the formation of a liquid jet that is subsequently accelerated toward a grounded collector. For low viscosity liquids, the jet breaks into droplets because of the longitudinal Rayleigh instability which is known as electrospraying, and used to obtain aerosols composed of sub-micrometer droplets with a narrow distribution 3 . For high viscosity liquids, such as polymer solutions or melts, the liquid travels in the form of a jet to the grounded target instead of breaking up. The transverse instability or spraying of the jet into two or more smaller jets is observed due to the radial charge repulsion 9 . As the solvent is evaporating, this liquid jet is stretched to many times its original length to produce continuous, ultrathin fibers of the polymer. This process is termed 'electrospinning', and it produces polymer fibers with diameters of sub-micrometer scale 10 . These porous three-dimensional (3D) membranes assembled by electrospun fibers are featured with large specific surface area, high porosity, and good interconnectivity, which makes electrospun nanomaterials highly attractive to different applications ranging from filtration, sensors, drug delivery platforms, tissue engineering, and so on 5,6 .",

The objective is a robust method for manufacturing extremely small nanofibers in large quantities and with a uniform size. Recently, the novel two-dimensional (2D) nanowebs were generated in 3D fibrous mats by optimizing processing parameters in electrospinning 21 . The electrospun fibers act as a support for the 'fishnet-like' nanowebs comprising interlinked 1D nanowires ( Fig. 2a-e) .

Besides the MOS sensing architectures, conducting polymerbased nanostructured materials have also been utilized extensively in resistive sensors because of their high surface areas, chemical specificities, tunable conductivities, material flexibilities and easy processing. Various kinds of conducting polymers, such as polyaniline (PANI), poly(diphenylamine) (PDPA), polypyrrole (PPy), and polythiophene, have been used in various applications including metallic interconnects in circuits, chemical sensors and electromagnetic radiation shielding 49 . Among the family of conducting polymers, PANI is one of most attractive materials for sensing applications. Over the past a few years, various PANI-based electrospun nanomaterials such as individual PANI/poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) nanowires 50 , PANI nanotubes 51 , coaxial PANI/polymethacrylate (PMMA) composite nanofibers 52 , leucoemeraldine-based PANI/PVP composite films 53 and 10-camphorsulfonic acid (HCSA) doped PANI nanofibers 54 have been explored as sensing materials for various gas detection. Additionally, other conducting composite electrospun fibers, such as PDPA/PMMA 55 , HCSA doped poly(o-toluidine)/polystyrene 56 and multiwall carbon nanotube (MWCNT) doped nylon 57 , were also fabricated as sensing materials to detect ammonia, alcohols, moisture, hexane, acetone, ethyl acetate, dichloromethane, trichloromethane, tetrahydrofuran and toluene vapors by measuring the resistance changes of fibers. Photoelectric sensors Metallic nanoparticles encapsulated into dielectric matrices are considered to have practical applications in optical and electronic devices owing to their enhanced third-order nonlinear susceptibility, especially near the surface-plasmon-resonance (SPR) frequency 58 . The enhancement of photoresponse behaviors in the hybrid nanowire arising from the excitation of the surface plasmon is attributed to the generation of hot electrons owing to the decay of surface plasmon polaritons 59 . Recently, Shi and coworkers 60 have developed a method to fabricate Au nanoparticles (AuNPs) embedded silica nanofibers via electrospinning and thermal decomposition of hybrid nanofibers, which exhibited an obvious photoelectric response under the illumination (Fig. 6a). Upon illumination, the hybrid peapod nanofibers presented a wavelength-dependent photoelectric current response. In particular, the current photoresponse reached a maximum value under illumination at a wavelength of 550 nm, which was close to the SPR absorption band of the AuNPs nanofibers (Fig. 6b). These results showed the potential of using gold nanopeapodded silica nanowires as wavelength-controlled optical nanoswitches. Another type of photoelectric sensor based on 1D nanosized GaN has been developed recently. Considering the distinguished optical and electric performance, electrospun GaN nanofibers are suitable for ultraviolet photodetection applications. Pan and coworkers 61demonstrated that electrospun GaN nanofibers were promising candidates for easily assembled high-performance UV photodetectors(Fig. 6c). The photoconductance of an electrospun GaN nanofiber increases by 830 times compared with single crystalline GaN nanowires when UV was on. This high sensitivity can be attributed to the polycrystalline structure and rough surfaces of GaN nanofibers, which lead to a high surface area-to-volume ratio, and subsequently result in more photogenerated carriers compared with a smooth GaN nanowire.",

(Reprinted with permission from 61 . \u00a9 2009 Wiley.) first work was proposed on enzymatic electrode, electrochemical biosensors with the GO x binding to the transducers have played a leading role in this direction. Considering the immobilization of GO x , various carbon-based nanoscaled materials such as carbon nanofiber, carbon nanotube, carbon nanohorn, mesoporous carbon and graphite nanoplatelet were explored as immobilization matrix due to their unique electronic and mechanical properties. Wang et al. 70 explored the application of carbon nanotubefilled electrospun nanofibrous poly(acrylonitrile-co-acrylic acid) membranes in glucose biosensor (Fig. 8a-b), in which fast response and low detection limit were achieved. Apart from these carbon-based nanoscaled immobilization matrix, Ren et al. 71 have developed an amperometric biosensor by electrospinning deposition of nanofibrous GO x /PVA membranes as sensitive coatings on the surface of the Au electrode. The electrospinning technique makes it convenient and efficient to prepare the enzymatic electrode for biosensors. Good selectivity and high sensitivity were obtained with these enzymatic sensors, while inevitable drawbacks such as the chemical and thermal instabilities originated from the intrinsic nature of enzymes as well as the tedious fabrication procedures may limit their analytical applications 72 . Most enzymeless electrochemical glucose sensors rely on the properties of electrode materials, on which glucose is oxidized directly. With the great development of nanotechnology, various electrospun nanomaterials such as Ni nanoparticle-loaded carbon nanofibers (NiCF) 73 , copper oxide nanofibers 74 , Pd(IV)-doped copper oxide composite nanofibers 75 and poly(vinylidene fluoride)/ poly(aminophenylboronic acid) composite nanofibrous membranes 76 were explored as the candidates in the hope of developing effective enzyme-free sensors. As an example, the amperometric responses of the NiCF paste electrode are shown in Fig. 8c. As indicated, fast response with 95% of the steady-state current achieved within 5 seconds could be observed, and the limit of detection was 1 \u03bcM. The good analytical performance and straightforward preparation method made enzymeless electrode material promising for the development of effective glucose sensor. Apart from these predominant glucose sensors, many research groups have investigated the application of biomaterials modified amperometric devices to detect hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ), nitrite, urea, and so on, which further extend the scope of amperometric biosensors.

As is known to all, urea levels are vital in medical diagnosis, environmental and bioindustrial analysis. Recently, researchers at the University of New York have demonstrated that electrospun PVP/urease composite nanofibers had great potential as a urea biosensor 78 . These nanocomposite materials exhibited high electric conductivity and accelerated the electron transfer, which in turn greatly enhanced the sensor sensitivity.Optimization analysis of sensor performance Specific surface area and fiber diameterGrowing efforts have been focused on developments of nanostructured materials to achieve higher surface-to-volume ratios and lower cross-section areas, which lead to more effective performances of electrochemical detectors such as mass transport, electric charge transport and signal to noise current ratios.Various hyperfine nanostructures, such as porous, hollow and core-sheath structures, can be obtained via regulating the parameters of electrospinning process or solution properties. Porous nanofibers can be produced by different ways, for instances via polymer blends, solvents caused phase separations, and spinning onto very cold substrates such as liquid nitrogen or on different collectors 5,79,80 . Nanofibers with porous structures can also be produced from bicomponent systems by calcination or porogen treatment 17 . Zhang and coworkers 81 have demonstrated the feasibility of preparing porous SnO 2 fibers through electrospinning of PVA/SnCl 4 \u00b75H 2 O composite and oxygen plasma etching. The highly porous SnO 2 fibers composing of nano-size fibrils outperformed the conventional bulk films in both sensitivity and response time to ethanol.To obtain hollow or core-shell fibers, an electrospun nanofiber serves as a template onto which a second material is deposited as shell either from solution or melt, via layer-by-layer techniques, or from the vapor phase11,82 . Especially for hollow fibers, the core fiber can be removed by thermal decomposition, selective solvents, or by biodegradation.The internal surface of the hollow fibers is structured in this case by the surface topology of the template fibers. Choi et al.37 demonstrated that hollow ZnO fibers(Fig. 9a)enhanced the sensitivity to NO 2 compared with the reference ZnO thin film specimens(Fig. 9b). Park et al.83  and Wang et al.36 also described that an sensitivity increase was observed with the fabrication of TiO 2 -ZnO core-shell and TiO 2 -poly (3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) structured nanofibers. These works have proved the possibility to form numerous interesting inorganic tubular structures with homogenous wall thickness and secondary structure. The manufacturing of structured yet compact polymer fibers with diameters from submicrometer to 10 nm meets with considerable interests for various kinds of applications. The reduction of diameter into nanometers gives rise to a set of favorable properties, including increase of surface-to-volume ratio, unique electronic properties, and simple integration with two-terminal microcircuits, which will further enhance the sensitivity of the sensor. Craighead and coworkers 50 investigated the diameter-dependent response of single PANI upon exposure to NH 3 . The PANI nanowires with two different diameters (335 and 490 nm) were fabricated and their sensitive properties were examined. As a result, the electrical response of single PANI nanowire sensors depended on the vapor concentration as well as the nanowire diameter. Both the response time and the sensitivity were greatly improved with the decrease of",

(Reprinted with permission from 73 . \u00a9 2009 Elsevier Ltd.) , a thicker nanofibrous membrane has a larger sensing area and vacant volume in which more analytes can be absorbed and diffuse into the membranes. We demonstrated that the nanofibrous PAA membranes coated QCM sensors with a larger coating load exhibited a larger frequency response for the same RH 22 . For resistive sensors, increased interaction of the analyte with the conduction channel is of importance, as the sensitivity and response time ultimately depend on the analyte transport to this region. It may be possible that a thicker semiconductor or conducting polymer layer could protect the conduction pathway from the deleterious effects of environment as well as analytes of interest. Wang et al. 84 demonstrated how ultrathin PPy membranes influenced the sensor characteristics. The high sensitivity and fast recovery time can be attributed to the ultrathin PPy-coating layer (\u223c7 nm), in which the ultrathin PPy layer greatly reduces the diffusion resistance of NH 3 . Nevertheless, the dependence of sensing performance on nanofibrous membranes thickness has not been clearly established for resistive sensors 85 . Conclusion The past few years have witnessed significant progresses in applications of the electrospun nanomaterials, demonstrated by numbers of recent scientific publications on this area. Current research has focused on not only the theory and optimization of the electrospinning process, but also many specific aspects of electrospun nanomaterials such as structure formation, functionalization, potential implementation in devices and other applications 86 . Although most of these topics are of fundamental interest, they have been, for the most parts, studied only rudimentarily to date. Essential studies, nevertheless, are still required and many challenges have to be faced. More experimental studies and theoretical modeling are required in order to achieve a better control over the size and morphology of electrospun fibers. In particular, nanofiber systems with ultrafine diameter less than 20 nm exhibit several fascinating characteristics such as extremely large specific surface area, high porosity and superior mechanical performance, which make them optimal candidates for applications in ultrasensitive sensors as well as the ultra-fine filters to intercept viruses and bacteria such as influenza A (H1N1) virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus, Escherichia coli, etc. Until now, thorough understanding the formation mechanisms of nanowebs has been an imperative challenge. Only after solving this challenge, we can successfully prepare more and better nanowebs with different polymers and precisely control the actual mechanics in the progress of electrospinning. Preparation of sensing materials in form of nanostructures may significantly improve their performances in the existing devices or open the doors to new types of applications. For instance, the research on engineering the secondary structures (porous and core-sheath or hollow) of electrospun nanomaterials will provide a new platform for designing advanced electrode materials, catalyst supports, and sensing devices. However, integration of such nanomaterials into useful devices requires materials of well-controlled orientation, size, and other targeting characteristics as well as reproducibility locating them in specific positions and orientations. The ability to narrow the compatibility gap between sensing devices and nanomaterials, however, remains a major challenge in the field. Fortunately, several approaches have emerged that promise to bridge these gaps and realize the vision of upgraded nanosensors.",
