This in turn increases contacts between wildlife and hence the risk of transmission and emergence of zoonotic diseases. We analyzed the environment and land use using remote spatial data around the sampling locations of bats positive for coronavirus (21 sites) and astrovirus (11 sites) collected in 43 sites. A clear association between viruses and hosts was observed. Viruses associated to synanthropic bat genera, such as Myotis or Scotophilus were associated to highly transformed habitats with human presence while viruses associated to fruit bat genera were correlated with natural environments with dense forest, grassland areas and regions of high elevation. In particular, group C betacoronavirus were associated with mosaic habitats found in anthropized environments.",

The thickly forested Lao PDR landscape consists of rugged mountains (up to 2800 m) surrounded by plains and plateaus. The Mekong River represents the \"lifeline\" of the country, and is the major economic corridor (Sisouphanthong and Taillard, 2000) . In Cambodia, the landscape is characterized by a low-lying central plain including the Tonle Sap Lake and the upper areas of the Mekong River delta dominated by irrigated cultures. These areas are flooded during the rainy season (Wildlife, 2014) . They are surrounded by uplands and low mountains, and thinly forested and transitional plains at around 200 m above sea level (Wildlife, 2014) . Cambodia and Lao PDR experienced an important forest loss and fragmentation: 22% and 24% of their forest cover disappeared between 1973 and 2009 , respectively (WWF, 2013 . In 2010, the forest covered 57.2% and 77.2% of Cambodia and Lao PDR respectively (FAO and World Bank, 2016; World Development Indicators, 2016) .",

Sampling was conducted in two phases (Lacroix et al., 2017a (Lacroix et al., , 2017b . Phase 1 was performed in 2010 by the Institut Pasteur in Cambodia (IPC). Bats were captured using harp traps, stored in Mist Net bags and humanely euthanized under supervision of the National Veterinary Research Institute in full compliance with local ethical and legal guidelines at the sampling sites in the Cambodian provinces of Ratanakiri, Stung Treng and Preah Vihear. Phase 2 of sampling was performed by the Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS), as part of USAID PREDICT project, from 2011 to 2013. Samples were taken at the human-bat interface and thus mostly from bats dedicated to human consumption, in markets, restaurants or directly from hunters. Fresh guano samples were also taken from guano farms in Cambodia. Geographical coordinates of each collection site were recorded using a Global Positioning System (GPS).",

Initial data were produced in 2010 and updated in 2014. Images were from Landsat8. Land cover map showed the main classes of land use as a synthesis of various material types, i.e. natural attributes and features on earth used for GlobeLand30 (GLC30) classification from 30 \u00d7 30 m multispectral satellite images. Schemes were merged into six land use categories: crop land, forest, grassland, wetland, water bodies and settlement areas. Elevation map was obtained from Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) of the Consortium for Spatial Information (CGIAR-CSI). Most bats were obtained from markets or directly from hunters and have been hunted in surrounding areas (Lacroix et al., 2017a (Lacroix et al., , 2017b . It was thus important to estimate the area of origin of these hunted bats. According to road connectivity and cost effectiveness, the distance between hunting and selling points was assumed to be less than 20 km. A 20-km radius was in agreement with the ecology and potential flying distances of the collected bats (Flemming and Eby, 2003; Kunz and Fenton, 2005; IUCN, 2017) and should then encompass the original environment of the hunted bats. In this study, this 1256 km 2 (20 km radius) buffer zone was designated as \"Area Of Interest (AOI)\". AOIs are shown in Fig. 2 . Data were extracted using the Patch Analyst extension in Geographical Information Systems (GIS) software ArcMap 10.3.1. Forest cover was examined more precisely in each AOI: 1) as a simple proportion of forest to each land cover type, 2) using the Shannon diversity index (SDI), 3) using the Fg fragmentation index defined as the ratio of the surface of the forest to the edge length of the forest (Fortin et al., 2005) and 4) using the ED edge density index which is the density of forest borders divided by the forest surface. Administrative data were obtained from the GADM database of Global Administrative Areas (version 2.8, November 2015). Main road networks in Cambodia and Lao PDR were obtained from the Digital Chart of the World (DCW) available on the Diva-gis online resource (www. diva-gis.org) and Google Earth. The network density in each AOI was assessed by measuring the total road length and the number of intersections. Connectivity index shows the density of roads connections for each AOI as the total length of the main roads (L) and the number of intersections (I). Connectivity = log (L * l).",

            "text": "A hierarchical analysis, also known as cluster analysis, based on environmental parameters in each AOI was performed in order to describe the different type of habitats using the software R version 3.3.0 (www.r-project.org). The principle of hierarchical analysis is to build a binary tree of data that successively merges similar groups of points. From a statistical point of view each group is described by the index of similarity. Parameters used for hierarchical analysis were: Land cover [% forest cover, % settlement cover, % grassland, % surface water cover, % cropland cover and % wetland cover]; Mean elevation; and Connectivity. Similarity is described by the distance on the Y axis, in this work a Euclidean distance. As a first step, data are grouped into most similar pairs (expressed by a correlation index). As a second step, pairs are grouped into larger groups of similarity. In this work, Euclidean distances between 8 and 12 were yielded 6 independent clusters and each cluster comprised from 6 to 9 statistically similar AOIs. Principal Component Analyses (PCA) were performed using Statistica v.12. PCA analysis shows statistical, multidimension links between several variables and is used to emphasize variations. PCA requires statistically independent factors. The information is shown as a set of new orthogonal variables, the principal components (p). The pattern of similarity of the observed variables is displayed as points on a surface. In this case we used PCA to assess the correspondence of spatial environment and anthropogenic factors with respect to (a) astrovirus and coronavirus found on bats, and (b) to spatial environment and anthropogenic factors. As a first step all 11 factors corresponding to A. Afelt et al. Infection, Genetics and Evolution 58 (2018) 181-191 spatial analysis and considered in each AOI were assessed for correlation using a correlation matrix. Out of 11 factors considered, 3 were strongly correlated and dependent, i.e. forest, ED, SDI (r = 0.56-0.76). Out of these three factors, SDI (Shannon Index) provided a more complete information integrated both forest cover and density. SDI was therefore retained for PCA analysis while forest and ED were excluded from this analysis. PCA analysis was therefore performed with 9 environment-linked factors: SDI, Fragmentation, Connectivity, Settlements, Cropland, Wetland, Grassland, Water, and Elevation. PCA analysis was preceded by data normalization. Finally, three sets of supplementary variables were investigated, i.e. (i) bats sampled in each AOI, (ii) coronavirus isolated from sampled bats, and (iii) astrovirus isolated from sampled bats.",

AOI were described by nine statistically independent parameters: i.e. water cover, settlements cover, cropland cover, wetland cover, grassland cover, elevation, forest Shannon index, forest fragmentation index and connectivity index ( Table 2 ). Hierarchical analysis based on these 9 parameters resulted into 6 clusters of landscape parametrization (Fig. 3) . The main parameters for cluster characterization were: grass cover, cropland, Shannon index, fragmentation index and connectivity index.

Infection, Genetics and Evolution 58 (2018) 181-191 and high connectivity index (2.5%-2.9%). Only one AOI (38) was negative for viruses. AOI 39, 40, 41, 42 and 43 were positive for coronavirus while only two sites (40 and 43) were positive for astrovirus. Cluster B comprised 9 AOIs (33, 35, 36), including four sites positive for at least one virus. In these areas, forest cover (80-95%) and Shannon index were higher than for cluster A and the human settlements cover was small or not detected in a 30 \u00d7 30 m resolution, indicating that villages were small and scattered. Both clusters A and B were located in Lao PDR. Euclidean distance indicated that clusters A and B segregated independently from the other 4 clusters (Fig. 3) . These remaining clusters were characterized by low cropland cover, low human settlement cover and high Shannon index. Clusters C, D, E and F corresponded to AOI located in Cambodia. The cluster pairs C & D and E & F were the most similar. Cluster C included 6 AOIs with only two (11, 12) where only coronavirus were detected while no astrovirus was present.",

Cluster D comprised 6 AOIs (1-6) displaying cultivated areas with high cropland cover and one of the highest settlement cover (7.2% for AOI 2). Three AOIs (1, 2, 3) were positive for astrovirus, including AOI 1 which displayed a high wetland cover and one of the highest cropland cover. Cluster E covered 7 AOIs (22-27) dominated by forest (85-98%) with the lowest connectivity index, one of the lowest forest fragmentation index and limited cultivated and grassland areas. The Shannon index was also among the lowest. Cluster E represented a wilderness parts of Cambodia. Cluster E also displayed the highest virus richness, i.e. 4 coronavirus sub-clusters and 5 astrovirus sub-clusters. The last cluster, F, comprised 9 AOIs (13-21) out of which 6 were positive for viruses (13, 14, 15, 17, 19, 21) . All displayed mostly cultivated land with patches of forest, and the highest connectivity index and wetland cover, corresponding to highly transformed environments. The human settlement cover was rather low (0.1-3.5%) indicating that villages were concentrated in clusters. Cluster F also displayed the highest rate of coronavirus detection (37, including 28 \u03b1CoV_1 in AOI 14) and astrovirus (37 Bat_AstVs, located only in AOIs 13 and 14). Distances indicated that clusters E and F were the most divergent (Fig. 3) . Another conclusion from this analysis is the higher bat biodiversity observed in Cambodia associated to more anthropized environment than in LAO PDR where dense forest was predominant (Fig. 3) .",

These observations are in accordance with their biology and ecology: Myotis and Scotophilus can adapt to many habitats but preferentially settle in anthropogenic habitats, in old buildings or crevasses. They rely on water bodies, which attract prey for these insectivorous bats (Bates et al., 2008b; Rosell-Ambal et al., 2008) . Scotophilus bats are also reared in farms for their guano (Chhay, 2012) . The presence of Hipposideros, Macroglossus and Rhinolophus, in environments with forest areas mixed with other categories of land cover (mosaic landscape) is also in accordance with their ecology (Bates et al., 2008a; Hutson et al., 2008; Walston et al., 2008) . As a consequence, the two coronavirus sub-clusters \u03b1CoV_1 and \u03b1CoV_2, detected specifically in Scotophilus and Myotis respectively (Lacroix et al., 2017a) displayed the same trend, i.e. a high correlation with anthropogenic environment. Fruit and forest-dependent bat genera testing positive for viruses (Rousettus, Eonycteris) were correlated with an environment mostly consisting of densely forested areas at a higher elevation. The betacoronavirus clusters \u03b2CoV_D3 and \u03b2CoV_D4 which were found mostly in bats from the genera Rousettus and Eonycteris also correlated with the same type of environment. Finding coronavirus sub-clusters specific to a given bat genus in similar environment types indicates that the distribution of viruses is likely to follow the distribution of their hosts. The highest diversity of bats observed in anthropized environments emphasizes furthermore the risk associated with environmental changes. Deforestation and anthropization instead of leading to the elimination of bats generate conversely yield to a higher diversity. This might be explained by the complexity of A. Afelt et al. Infection, Genetics and Evolution 58 (2018) 181-191 the anthropized environments which offer opportunities to different groups of ubiquity bat species whereas natural environments might be more selective and suited for species with more strict ecological requirements. This higher biodiversity occurring by definition at the human interface, the risk of virus transmission is therefore increasing as well.",

The correspondence with host habitat is even more evident with astroviruses. Ungulate astrovirus found in ungulates and bats are associated with grasslands at higher elevation while murine astroviruses found in rodents and bats are associated with human settlements, indicating that the host bats are present in these same habitats. Bat astroviruses, found only in bats, are associated with water surface and irrigated cultures. This could be explained by the fact that irrigated cultures provide an important insect biomass and food resources for insectivorous bat populations which are harboring mainly arboviruses (Kunz and Fenton, 2005; Lacroix et al., 2017b) .",

The distribution pattern of bat population has been found to also impact the viral richness of the host (Henle et al., 2004; Meyer et al., 2008; Gay et al., 2014) . The fragmentation of bat populations was linked to a decrease in viral species richness (Gay et al., 2014) . However, this work indicates that if fragmentation is an important parameter, it is not sufficient by itself to explain the distribution and must be considered jointly with the Shannon Diversity Index (SDI index) to yield a picture accurate enough. In this work, combining these parameters allowed us to clearly associate certain clusters of viruses to given environments and this is to our knowledge, the first time it is achieved in SEA. This correlation is a direct consequence of the association between bats hosting these viruses and specific environments. This work should thus be accompanied by the modeling of the modification of landscapes (Jung and Threlfall, 2016) over the next decades in order to assess and predict which part of the current biodiversity may increase or be at risk.",

            "text": "From a methodological standpoint, large sampling was not possible because of the status of protected species attached to the reservoir (IUCN, 2017). On another hand, avoiding the sampling of protected reservoirs for the sake of conservation and thus avoiding early detection and risk assessment is putting human populations at risk and contrary to public health policy (Morse, 2012; Lipkin and Anthony, 2015) . In this work we considered both aspects at once. The limited sample size and limited quality of the bat material are a direct consequence of their status of protected species which was respected and enforced. Indeed, the bat sample collection was opportunistic, and mostly based on animals hunted by local populations (Lacroix et al., 2017a (Lacroix et al., , 2017b . One of the consequences was the difficulty to reach the level of species identification but this could be easily achieved in the future by implementing procedures integrating molecular typing of bats (Clare et al., 2011; Korstian et al., 2016) . However, if the species level could not be reached with certainty in a significant part of the samples, except for Ia io, Pipistrellus coromandra and Megaerops niphanae, the ecology of the species present in South East Asia was similar within a given genus. The IUCN red list of threatened species provides the basis for a comparative analysis (IUCN, 2017). Scotophilus species found in South East Asia are reported to roost in crevices, cracks in walls, or roof of old buildings as well as leaves and crowns of palms, hollows of trees and among leaves of banana. This is in conformity with the analysis of the distribution of Scotophilus reported in this work as being influenced by forest fragmentation, water areas and anthropogenic environments. The genus Myotis was found in this work to strongly correlate with anthropogenic environments, water areas and wetlands. The ecology of Myotis species in South East Asia is matching this description (IUCN, 2017). M. annectans was found on a river valley, M. horsfieldii and M. ater are found near to water source and streams in lowland forest as well as disturbed forest and agricultural areas. M. rosseti is found in disturbed areas while M. siligorensis has been collected in lowland second growth forests over streams. M. pilosus is a fish-eating bat and therefore strictly dependent on water. We reported in this work that the genera Hipposideros, Eonycteris, Ia and Rhinolophus as correlating with more natural habitats comprising dense forests and grassland area at higher elevation. Hipposideros scutinares is known only from caves in limestone areas while H. cineraceus is roosting in hollows of trees in forests in South East Asia. H. galeritus is found in lowland forests as well as rubber plantations in Southeast Asia (IUCN, 2017) . H. pomona ecology is not well known but in Southeast Asia it roosts essentially in caves. Similarly not much is known about H. rotalis which is considered to live in dry forests (IUCN, 2017) . Eonycteris spelaea is found in caves in forested areas. However, it is a forest nectar eating bat which has adapted to agricultural and orchard crops (IUCN, 2017) . With respect to Rhinolophus, similar features are observed. R. coelophyllus is found in forest, R. lepidus is associated with intact lowland tropical moist forest. R. malayanus is found in caves in secondary forest and degraded habitat. R. paradoxolophus was found in dry pine forest, while R. affinis is living in primary and secondary forest (IUCN, 2017) . The two Rousettus species described in the IUCN database as present in Lao PDR and Cambodia, Rousettus amplexicaudatus and Rousettus leschenaultia, share the same ecology and roost in caves, old and ruined buildings and disused tunnels in forest, agricultural areas, disturbed habitats and at the forest edge. This matches the position described for Rousettus in this work. Finally, with respect to Taphozous theobaldi and Taphozous melanopogon, they both share the same forest habitat with roosting in caves or abandoned buildings and mines (IUCN, 2017) . This short review of the ecology of the bats genera described in this work indicates that the species of a given genus share the same ecological traits and therefore that the lack of identification at the species is not impairing the conclusions on correlation between batborne viruses and environmental patterns.",

One must also take into account if species associated to similar environment shelter together. This will influence the presence and prevalence of bat-borne viruses which is not only a consequence of environmental change but also of ethology and ecology of bats. This can thus influence the occurrence of contacts with humans and should be further investigated in order to consider the specificity of each bat genus. However, this problem has been overcome with the definition of AOI considering both economic and ecological aspects.",

The prediction of landscape modification, climate change and anthropogenic behaviors (urbanization, roads, development of croplands, animal husbandry, etc.) can be achieved by economic planning and using GIS analysis. The association between environmental patterns and viral sub-clusters described in this work will therefore permit to develop a typology of situations at risk depending on (i) the virus involved, (ii) on the evolution of risk of contact, and (iii) the risk of emergence in the different situations which could arise. Preventive and protective actions could therefore be proposed to reduce this risk and hinder the evolution and development of hazardous contexts. This work is a preliminary step and deeper analyses and modeling must be further investigated. Nevertheless it provides opportunities for developing prospective approaches capable of managing protection of bats and wildlife while protecting human populations from potentially devastating emerging bat-borne viral diseases.",
