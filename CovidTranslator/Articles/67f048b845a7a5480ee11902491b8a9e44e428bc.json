The subtle differences in presentation and workup results create a diagnostic challenge to neurologists and neuroradiologists. 2 In any patient presenting with what appears to be acute encephalopathy based on history and physical examination, the first priority is to rule out an acute bacterial or viral infection of central nervous system (CNS) such as meningitis or encephalitis.

In order to solve this issue, efforts were directed towards developing a standardised case definition clearly outlining the diagnostic features of different demyelinating diseases of childhood. Standardised definitions are necessary not only in the clinical setting, but for widespread use in surveillance and research (clinical trials).",

The requisite inclusion of encephalopathy, although overly restrictive, was performed to increase diagnostic specificity and helps differentiate ADEM from MS. A number of other clinical features, laboratory test findings and MRI findings also serve as diagnostic criteria. 2 8 While a viral infection often precedes ADEM, documentation of an antecedent infection and isolation of an infectious agent are not requirements for diagnosis. 8 ",

However, impaired level of consciousness (drowsiness, lethargy, stupor or coma) is a key feature. 3 At least 70% of patients report an antecedent prodromal event 2-30 days prior to the onset of ADEM symptoms. 3 ADEM is usually triggered by systemic viral infections. Viruses that have been implicated in studies or case reports to cause ADEM include coronavirus, coxsackie, CMV, EBV , HSV , influenza, measles, rubella, VZV and West Nile virus. [2] [3] While measles was identified as a major cause of ADEM in the past, the incidence and prevalence of encephalomyelitis has significantly decreased in areas where children are vaccinated against measles. 9 Meanwhile, non-specific respiratory viral infections have now become the major prodromal illness in developed countries. The infection typically occurs days to weeks prior to the disease. 3 In most cases of ADEM, however, the aetiologic agent remains unknown with only the occasional microbiological or serological evidence of a viral agent. A 6 year retrospective study by Murthy et al published in 2002 identified 18 patients with ADEM, with 13 who had initially presented with a prodromal URT illness. Despite rigorous testing, a definite microbiological diagnosis was established in only one child and the result was EBV. 10 ",

However, the phenomenon most consistent with EBV infection was the development of a diffuse maculopapular rash a few days after the administration of Augmentin. Studies have found the relative risk of developing this characteristic rash to be as high as 58 times in EBV-positive patients as opposed to those without EBV. 19 A monospot test, which is normally sensitive and specific for EBV mononucleosis, is of limited value in children <4 years 17 and so was not performed in this case. The clinical picture, along with the lymphocytosis, IgM seropositivity to EBV VCA and lymphocytic pleocytosis, are sufficient to establish EBV infection as the culprit behind this boy's ADEM. Another remarkable laboratory finding is the mild elevation in liver enzymes which can be seen with IM.",

It was in fact the IgM to EBV early antigen (EA) that was seen in 16% (3 cases) of only ADEM cases. This is worth noting as the finding is compatible with the serology profile of our patient. 20 Associations have also been detected between EBV seropositivity and MS in adults and children. 21 22 CNS complications of EBV infection occur in up to 18% of patients with IM. 23 To date, many attempts have been made to explain the pathogenesis of EBV-related encephalitis and autoimmune demyelinating diseases, such as ADEM. Weinberg et al studied the CSF patterns in different EBV-related neurological diseases. They explained direct infection of neurons and glial cells and lytic EBV replication as the likely pathogenesis of EBV encephalitis, where there is intense viral replication and vigorous inflammation. On the other hand, postinfectious complications were associated with low viral replication and vigorous inflammation. 23 For ADEM, cross-reactivity between EBV and myelin proteins has been proposed as a potential mechanism by which the autoimmune response is triggered. 1 2 This is the phenomenon known as molecular mimicry which can lead to a distant autoimmune reaction and does not necessarily require the viral agent to actively replicate in the CNS.",
