In temperate climates, there is significant seasonal variation in the rates of GAS pharyngitis, peaking during winter/early spring. In tropical climates, the seasonal variation appears to be less marked, although robust data are lacking. 4 It is unclear as to whether other factors affect this (e.g., increased viral transmission or crowding). 5 Impetigo is common in childhood; transmission occurs readily in school and pre-school care settings, especially during summer in humid locations. In tropical settings where the burden is particularly high, almost half of children can have impetigo at any one time. 6 ",

            "text": "A Streptococcus (GAS) causes a diverse spectrum of disease, ranging from benign and self-limited infections of the throat or skin, to lethal soft tissue infections accompanied by multi-organ failure. Until the advent of the antibiotic era, GAS was a major cause of death in industrialized countries due to fatal epidemics of scarlet fever, sepsis, and rheumatic heart disease (RHD). The 1980s saw an increase in rheumatic fever cases in the Rocky Mountain states of the United States, along with an apparent resurgence in severe GAS disease in industrialized countries. 1 The subsequent awareness of GAS disease in recent years has also brought to focus its disproportionately high burden in resourcelimited settings, especially in tropical regions. The severe implications of advanced RHD and the existence of effective strategies for prevention and treatment highlight the need for better data to accurately determine worldwide burden. 2, 3 EPIDEMIOLOGY As expected, the burden of all GAS infections is highest in resourcelimited settings. This is likely related to poverty, overcrowded living conditions, and reduced access to medical care, although geography and climate may also play a role. The estimated number of cases and deaths from GAS diseases are summarized in Table 40 .1. Of these, 79% of RHD cases, 95% of acute rheumatic fever (ARF) cases, 97% of acute post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis (APSGN) cases, and 97% of invasive GAS cases come from less developed countries. 2 Pharyngitis is the most common manifestation of GAS disease; the peak incidence is in school-aged children. Compared with the incidence in developed urban settings, which may be as low as one episode per 8 child years, the incidence in resource-limited settings may be four to eight times higher. 2 GAS colonization has been detected in the oropharynx of approximately one in eight school-aged children; lower rates occur below the age of 5 years (\u22485%), with groups C and G streptococci being more common.",

The incidence varies considerably over time, at 6 to 239 cases per 100,000 in low-resource settings and <1 case per 100,000 in developed countries. Increasingly, studies have shown evidence that APSGN is associated with an increased albumin:creatinine ratio and a threefold increased risk of developing chronic kidney disease. 11 Mortality is approximately 1.7%. 3 All estimates rounded down. *New RHD cases were calculated based on the proportion of incident acute rheumatic fever cases expected to develop RHD. The remainder of incident acute rheumatic fever cases are included in the \"History of acute rheumatic fever without carditis\" row. Therefore the total number of new acute rheumatic fever cases each year is 188,000 + 282,000 = 470,000 \u00a7No satisfactory data available to identify glomerulonephritis-induced chronic renal impairment or end-stage renal failure on the global scale. \u2126 Inferred from relevant reference. In simple impetigo, infection is confined to the epidermis with the formation of superficial crusted lesions on the face or other exposed body parts. Especially in tropical and impoverished settings, \"pyodermatous\" lesions may be pustular and ulcerative, with deeper ulceration leading to ecthyma. Children are usually afebrile and otherwise well, although resolution of pyoderma may take many days and result in scarring. Erysipelas, which typically affects the face or an extremity, is a painful infection of the dermis resulting in a clearly demarcated red and raised area of inflammation and sometimes superficial bullae formation. Cellulitis involves the deeper subcutaneous tissues, causing a more diffuse and less clearly demarcated area of inflammation. Lymphangitis, infection of the draining lymphatic ducts, results in tender linear streaks extending proximally from the site of infection. Unlike impetigo, GAS cellulitis and erysipelas are often associated with fever and systemic toxicity.",

            "text": "Necrotizing fasciitis is a rapidly progressing infection of the subcutaneous fat, the superficial fascia, and deeper structures, including muscle. Shock, multi-organ failure, and death may ensue within hours or days of onset. Initially, the overlying skin is relatively spared, and severe escalating pain may be disproportionate to clinical findings. The skin subsequently becomes violaceous, there may be bullae formation and associated sloughing. STSS is characteristically associated with GAS necrotizing fasciitis, although it may arise in the setting of other invasive GAS infections. The case definition of STSS requires the confirmation of GAS infection, along with hypotension and two or more features of multi-organ involvement: rash, coagulopathy, acute respiratory distress syndrome, renal failure, or hepatic impairment. 16 Otitis media, retropharyngeal and peritonsillar abscess, sinusitis, meningitis, pneumonia, bacteremia, necrotizing fasciitis, and endocarditis may arise without apparent antecedent or as a complication of tonsillopharyngitis, surgery or trauma (including burns), or varicella infection. Historically, outbreaks of GAS pneumonia were reported among previously healthy adults, although more recent reports have described the highest risk among the elderly and those with underlying medical conditions; infection in these individuals is often associated with high case fatality. A viral prodrome is often reported, although the onset of fever, chest pain, and dyspnea is characteristically rapid. GAS pneumonia may be necrotizing with pleural effusions frequently present early. Other complications include lung abscess formation, mediastinitis, and pericarditis. GAS uncommonly causes meningitis; most reports involve individuals with a pre-existing focus of GAS infection (e.g., pharyngitis, otitis media) or with other risk factors (e.g., skull defect or post-cranial surgery). 17 Puerperal sepsis caused by GAS was a frequent cause of death in the pre-antibiotic era with outbreaks resulting from nosocomial transmission. Unlike group B Streptococcus, GAS more commonly affects the mother than the infant, manifesting as post-partum endometritis, peritonitis, septic thrombophlebitis, or bacteremia without focus. 18 Chorioamnionitis, septic abortion, and neonatal sepsis have also been reported. A study in four tropical developing countries (Papua New Guinea, Ethiopia, the Gambia, and the Philippines) during the 1990s found that GAS was one of the three leading causes of bacteremia in newborns <90 days old, suggesting that peripartum infections remain common. 19 Similarly, GAS was the third most common cause of bacteremia in neonates (behind Escherichia coli and group B Streptococcus) in a large prospective, population-based study in Kilifi, Kenya. 20 ARF is characterized by various combinations of fever, mono/ poly arthritis or arthralgias, carditis (both clinical and sub-clinical), erythema marginatum, chorea, and subcutaneous nodules. 21 Chorea and insidious carditis can occur as a manifestation of ARF in the absence of other features. The 2015 revision of the Jones criteria now includes assessment by echocardiography to ensure that subclinical carditis is identified, as it is often not clinically evident. Severe or recurrent episodes of ARF may result in progressive facilitate specific adhesion of GAS to either the mucosal epithelium of the throat or skin. Asymptomatic colonization of the oropharynx may persist at low levels for weeks without eliciting a host immune response. Colonization of the skin is more transient, usually becoming established only days before inoculation (e.g., by insect bite) and subsequent pyoderma. Poor food hygiene has been responsible for several outbreaks of GAS pharyngitis in both low-resource settings and industrialized areas. 12 Pharyngitis and pyoderma are mostly benign with spontaneous resolution usually within days. Invasion by GAS into normally sterile sites occurs less commonly, but when this occurs it may result in severe clinical manifestations arising from complex host-pathogen interactions. Viral infection, notably with measles, varicella, or influenza, is occasionally antecedent to invasive infection. The skin and throat are the main portals for entry, after which GAS evades host defenses by expressing a number of virulence factors, chief of which is M protein, which extends as hairlike filaments from the cell surface. Together with the hyaluronic acid capsule and other surface proteins, M protein enables GAS to evade phagocytosis by multiple mechanisms, including preventing opsonization by blocking complement fixation to the bacterial cell wall. 12 Several additional cellular products appear to facilitate direct spread of the invading organism through tissue planes, potentially leading to bacteremia and hematogenous dissemination. Certain high-virulence strains of GAS secrete \"super-antigens\" which are able to stimulate T lymphocytes and antigen-presenting cells simultaneously, leading to overwhelming cytokine production and resultant shock seen in STSS. 12, 13 Antibodies against GAS proteins are important in providing protection against subsequent infection, in particular, those targeting serotype-specific epitopes on the M protein. However, aberrant immune responses to otherwise benign GAS infection of the throat or skin can result in the immune-mediated manifestations: ARF, RHD, and APSGN. In ARF, cross-reactive antibodies are thought to arise in genetically predisposed individuals infected with rheumatogenic GAS strains. These immune-mediated responses affect the endocardial, synovial, and neural tissue resulting in the syndrome of ARF. 12 Recent genome-wide association studies have identified an association between RHD and polymorphisms of the gene encoding the immunoglobulin heavy chain, specifically the IGHV4-61 segment in certain populations. 14 Impetigo is suspected to cause ARF, although this has not been proven. Case reports exist to support the possible link between a patient with GAS impetigo and concurrent group C Streptococcus (GCS) pharyngitis suffering from ARF. 15 Further work is required to clarify a definitive link between impetigo and ARF, as well as the association between group C/G Streptococcus and ARF, as has been noted for APSGN.",

ARF is the most common cause of chorea in most populations with a high incidence of ARF-particularly those in tropical, less developed damage to the mitral valve (most commonly) and/or the aortic valve, resulting in RHD. Over several years, the valve may eventually become stenotic, resulting in subsequent atrial fibrillation and right ventricular failure. Post-streptococcal reactive arthritis describes a syndrome of polyarthritis that differs from ARF by affecting a range of smaller joints, being relatively resistant to anti-inflammatory treatment, and not being associated with carditis, although cases of ARF have been misdiagnosed as post-streptococcal reactive arthritis. 21 APSGN can occur 1 to 2 weeks after throat infection or a few weeks after GAS skin infection. The features are hematuria (usually gross), edema, and hypertension. Severe cases can also be complicated by hypertensive encephalopathy (posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome). The illness is generally benign in childhood, but there may be an appreciable mortality among adults as a result of renal and congestive cardiac failure.",

            "text": "GAS remains universally sensitive to penicillin, which is the treatment of choice. 5, 23 Although treatment failures occur, they never occur due to in vitro non-susceptibility. As penicillins target cell wall synthesis, they may be less effective in the stationary phase of bacterial growth when penicillin-binding proteins are not expressed. This is thought to occur in severe infections complicated by large bacterial loads, the Eagle effect. 12 However, in instances where alternative antibiotics may be used because of differing mechanisms of action, they are generally given as an adjunct to-rather than in replacement of-penicillin therapy. Erythromycin and the newer macrolides have been used for GAS infection where individuals have immediate hypersensitivity to penicillin. Macrolide resistance is common in some settings and can arise abruptly, apparently related to the population level of macrolide consumption. Some mutations confer resistance to both macrolides and clindamycin, but these remain uncommon. 5 In populations in whom ARF is now rare, antibiotics for the routine treatment of GAS pharyngitis is contentious because of the usually self-limiting nature of the illness. A Cochrane systematic review suggested that treatment of a sore throat with antibiotics reduces symptoms by 32% on day 3 and 51% on day 7, although it was noted that 82% of controls have self-resolved by day 7. It was noted that treatment decreased the risk of rheumatic fever by 73% and the risk of peritonsillar abscess by 85%; however, in low-incidence settings, the numbers needed to treat to prevent complications are likely to be very large. Therefore the aim of antibiotic treatment, if used, is alleviation of symptoms and shortening the duration of illness. Treatment of GAS pharyngitis is essential in populations with a high incidence of ARF and, if diagnostic facilities are limited, empiric treatment of all sore throat cases may be justified. The use of antibiotics to reduce the risk of subsequent APSGN is limited due to insufficient studies. 26 Treatment recommendations are detailed in Table 40 .4. Ten days of twice-daily oral penicillin V or a single dose of intramuscular benzathine penicillin G (BPG) is the preferred treatment for GAS, although once-daily oral amoxicillin appears to be effective for symptom resolution and GAS eradication. 5 Short courses (up to 5 days) of macrolides have been shown to have equivalent clinical and short-term microbiologic cure rates, but the risk of late microbiologic failure may be higher. There are insufficient data regarding the efficacy of short-course or non-penicillin regimens for preventing ARF. Treatment of impetigo may be with oral, intra-muscular, or topical antibiotics, although topical treatment is discouraged in high-prevalence settings because of the rapid emergence of antimicrobial resistance. A randomized controlled trial in north Australia showed non-inferiority of short-course oral trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (co-trimoxazole) compared with the single-dose BPG. The co-trimoxazole group had improved clearance of staphylococci, including methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA). 27 Options for treatment are given in Table 40 .4.",

Where necessary, cardiac failure is managed with diuretics and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. Steroids are sometimes used in cases of severe carditis, although there is no evidence that they improve the long-term outcome in RHD. Mitral valve repair, balloon valvuloplasty, or valve replacement may be required to manage patients with severe valve disease. 24 Management of APSGN is based on control of hypertension with fluid restriction and use of a loop diuretic such as furosemide. ACE inhibitors may also be needed as an adjunct. Dialysis is anti-staphylococcal penicillin or a first-generation cephalosporin is required to cover both GAS and S. aureus in cellulitis (see Table 40 .4). Where MRSA is prevalent, clindamycin may be acceptable, providing local MRSA strains are susceptible. Suppurative diseases frequently seen as complications of GAS infection (e.g., peritonsillar abscess) may also be caused by organisms other than GAS. 5 As necrotizing soft tissue infections may be polymicrobial, broad-spectrum cover (e.g., with a carbapenem + clindamycin \u00b1 vancomycin) is recommended until the microbiologic cause is confirmed. Urgent and aggressive debridement of non-viable tissues has been the cornerstone of management of GAS necrotizing fasciitis, along with intensive supportive care and antibiotics. 23 Clindamycin is recommended as an adjunct to penicillin for the treatment of severe invasive GAS disease, including necrotizing infections, during the first few days of treatment. Clindamycin has multiple mechanisms of action, targeting protein synthesis as opposed to penicillin-binding proteins and exhibiting an inhibitory effect against super-antigens, thereby reducing the inflammatory response. Observational studies have demonstrated a benefit of clindamycin in reducing mortality in patients with necrotizing fasciitis. 8 In instances where clindamycin is used, penicillin should always be given unless there is a history of hypersensitivity. Although Detection of subclinical carditis requires echocardiography with strict criteria; refer to guidelines. Repeat echocardiography if initially negative and high clinical suspicion. \u2021See guidelines regarding polyarthralgia, which should only be considered as a major manifestation in moderate-to high-risk populations after exclusion of other causes. As in past versions of the criteria, erythema marginatum and subcutaneous nodules are rarely \"stand-alone\" major criteria. Additionally, joint manifestations can only be considered in either the major or minor categories, but not both in the same patient. # If Sydenham (rheumatic) chorea is present, evidence of GAS infection or other criteria is not required for the diagnosis of ARF, refer to guidelines. \u0194 CRP must be elevated by local laboratory reference values. Peak ESR values should be used, as they often fluctuate. \u221e Unless carditis is a major criteria. Correct PR interval for age. If infection with clindamycin-resistant MRSA likely; adjust dose on basis of trough blood levels rarely required to manage severe hyperkalemia or symptomatic uremia. Contacts of patients with GAS infection may be colonized with the same GAS strain, but primary prophylaxis of contacts is rarely indicated for simple GAS pharyngitis. For contacts of severe invasive GAS infection, approximately 250 people would need to be treated to prevent one severe infection, and many experts now recommend routine treatment of close contacts. 5, 8 If prophylactic treatment of contacts is attempted, regimens combining rifampin with penicillin, or using alternative antibiotics such as cephalosporins or azithromycin, are usually recommended as a result of the increasing failures of penicillin alone in eradicating carriage. 5 Regular secondary prophylaxis is recommended for all children and adults with previous ARF or established RHD to prevent recurrence. Current guidelines recommend intramuscular BPG four times a week for 10 years. Secondary prophylaxis is central to the management of children and adults with ARF/RHD (see Table 40 .4).",
