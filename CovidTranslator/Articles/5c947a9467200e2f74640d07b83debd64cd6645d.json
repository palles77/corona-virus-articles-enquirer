Attenuation of virulence and tropism shift can also occur in nature, an example being the naturally occurring s and orf3 gene deletion mutant, the Porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV), which has both reduced pathogenicity and a predominantly respiratory tropism [14] . Although it is generally accepted that deletions in the spike and orf3 genes contribute to tropism change and attenuation in PRCV, other genes may also be involved. For instance, amino acid mutations in the M protein affect the ability of attenuated Purdue TGEV P115 to induce IFN-alpha, implying a potential role for the M protein in altered host response and virulence [12] .",

The TGEV TS S protein possessed the same number of amino acids as the Miller M6 and virulent Purdue strains, suggesting that TS is also a virulent strain. Amino acid mutations in the M protein affect its ability to induce IFN-alpha, and so the M protein has a potential role in TGEV virulence. The m gene has been regarded as a highly conserved TGEV gene, but comparison of the lengths of TGEV m genes revealed that the Miller M60 gene (789 nucleotides) encoded a 263 aa polypeptide, the TGEV gene encoded a 262 aa polypeptide, and the PRCV ISU-1 gene encoded a 261 aa polypeptide.

We characterized the TS strain by following its passage in three different cell types typically used for the culture of TGEV. As expected, ST cells were most sensitive to the presence of the TGEV virus, as indicated by the presence of cytopathic effects (CPE) after 48 h in culture. Although CPE were obvious in IB cells passaged for 50 generations, TGEV genes could not be cloned by RT-PCR, suggesting that maybe the virus can not be propagated in the cells. This indicated that IB cells were not suitable for the culture of the TGEV virus. The 3'end genome sequences of TS-ST 50 and TS-PK 50 showed no nucleotide mutations in the m, n, e and orf7 genes. However, the s and orf3 genes of TS-PK 50 had more nucleotides mutations than in TS-ST 50 . Surprisingly, the T residue at position 1753 of the TS s gene mutated to G in TS-PK 50 .

All the compared TGEV strains were divided into 3 clusters in the phylogenetic tree based on the s gene nucleotide and amino acid sequences. These were the American Miller cluster, American Purdue cluster and British cluster. The attenuated strain H from China had the closest relationship with Miller M60, while another Chinese strain, SC-Y, belonging to the Purdue cluster was separated into an independent group based on the S amino acid phylogenetic tree. Analysis of SC-Y gene revealed that one nucleotide mutation generating a termination codon appeared at aa residue 924. This may have been due to a sequencing mistake because no such mutations have been described in coronavirus s genes. Surprisingly, the orf3a genes of viruses in the Miller cluster were 72 aa in length, while in the Purdue cluster they were 71 aa in length. Therefore, the nucleotide number of the orf3a genes may differentiate the Miller cluster and Purdue cluster strains. Homology analysis indicated that PRCV ISU-I had the closest relationship with the Miller strains at both the nucleotide and protein levels. The orf3 gene of the Miller strains also had a high frequency of mutations and deletions, suggesting that a Miller-like strain was the ancestor of PRCV-ISU-1",
