The clinical responses, gross respiratory lesions and growth performances of these pigs were studied and compared with those of single (PRCV, H1N1 or H3N2) and mock-infected animals. PRCV infection caused fever, growth retardation and lung lesions, but no respiratory symptoms. Infection with swine influenza viruses caused rather similar, mild symptoms of disease, with H1N1 infection being the least severe. Combined infections with influenza viruses and PRCV did not appear to enhance the pathogenicity of these viruses. Furthermore, viruses were isolated more frequently from tissues and nasal swabs taken from 'single' than 'dual' infected animals, suggesting a possible in vivo interference between replication of PRCV and swine influenza virus.",

Serial passage in embry-onated eggs might have reduced the pathogenicity of these viruses for pigs. Field observations have suggested the possible association of swine influenza virus with porcine respiratory coronavirus in outbreaks of respiratory disease. However, the clinical picture observed in these experimentally induced dual infections was quite similar to that seen when PRCV was given on 'its own. Body temperatures were slightly higher after dual than after single infections and PRCV+H3N2-infected pigs were the only ones to develop coughing and sneezing. However, no significant differences in growth rates were detected between the single and dualinfected animals.
