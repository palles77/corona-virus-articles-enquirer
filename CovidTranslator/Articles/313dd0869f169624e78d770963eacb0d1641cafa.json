            "text": "A new coronavirus (CoV) identified as COVID-19 virus is the etiological agent responsible 31 for the 2019-2020 viral pneumonia outbreak that commenced in Wuhan 1-4 . Currently there 32 is no targeted therapeutics and effective treatment options remain very limited. In order to 33 rapidly discover lead compounds for clinical use, we initiated a program of combined 34 structure-assisted drug design, virtual drug screening and high-throughput screening to 35 identify new drug leads that target the COVID-19 virus main protease (M pro ). M pro is a key 36 CoV enzyme, which plays a pivotal role in mediating viral replication and transcription, 37 making it an attractive drug target for this virus 5,6 . Here, we identified a mechanism-based 38 inhibitor, N3, by computer-aided drug design and subsequently determined the crystal 39 structure of COVID-19 virus M pro in complex with this compound. Next, through a 40 combination of structure-based virtual and high-throughput screening, we assayed over 41 10,000 compounds including approved drugs, drug candidates in clinical trials, and other 42 pharmacologically active compounds as inhibitors of M pro . Six of these inhibit M pro with 43 IC50 values ranging from 0.67 to 21.4 \u03bcM. Ebselen also exhibited strong antiviral activity 44 in cell-based assays. Our results demonstrate the efficacy of this screening strategy, which 45 can lead to the rapid discovery of drug leads with clinical potential in response to new 46 infectious diseases where no specific drugs or vaccines are available. 47 48 author/funder.

The COVID-19 virus genome is comprised of ~30,000 51 nucleotides; its replicase gene encodes two overlapping polyproteins, pp1a and pp1ab, 52 required for viral replication and transcription 3,4 . The functional polypeptides are released 53 from the polyproteins by extensive proteolytic processing, predominantly by a 33.8-kDa 54 main protease (M pro ), also referred to as the 3C-like protease. M pro digests the polyprotein 55 at no less than 11 conserved sites, starting with the autolytic cleavage of this enzyme itself 56 from pp1a and pp1ab 8 . The functional importance of M pro in the viral life cycle, together 57 with the absence of closely related homologues in humans, identify the M pro as an attractive 58 target for antiviral drug design 9 . 59 To facilitate the rapid discovery of antiviral compounds with clinical potential, we 60 developed a strategy combining structure-assisted drug design, virtual drug screening and 61 high-throughput screening to repurpose existing drugs to target COVID-19 virus M pro . 62 Establishing a high-throughput activity assay 63 Recombinant COVID-19 virus M pro with native N and C termini was expressed in 64 Escherichia coli and subsequently purified (Extended Data Fig. 1a, b). The molecular 65 weight of COVID-19 virus M pro as determined by mass spectroscopy is 33797.0 Da, 66 consistent with its theoretical molecular weight 33796.8 Da. In order to characterize its 67 enzymatic activity and to carry out high-throughput screening of inhibitors, we developed 68 a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) assay. To do this, a fluorescently labeled 69 substrate, MCA-AVLQ\u2193SGFR-Lys(Dnp)-Lys-NH2, derived from the N-terminal auto-70 cleavage sequence of the viral protease was designed and synthesized for time-dependent",

The electron density 112 shows that the S\u03b3 atom of C145-A forms a covalent bond (1.8-\u00c5) with the C\u03b2 of the vinyl 113 group, confirming that the Michael addition has occurred. The S1 subsite has an absolute 114 requirement for Gln at the P1 position. The side chains of F140-A, N142-A, E166-A, H163-115 A, H172-A, S1-B (from protomer B), and main chains of F140-A and L141-A are involved 116 in S1 subsite formation, which also includes two ordered water molecules (named W1 and W2). The lactam at P1 inserts into the S1 subsite and forms a hydrogen bond with H163-118 A. The side chain of Leu at P2 site inserts deeply into the hydrophobic S2 subsite, which 119 consists of the side chains of H41-A, M49-A, Y54-A, M165-A, and the alkyl portion of the 120 side chain of D187-A. The side chain of Val at P3 is solvent-exposed, indicating that this the S1\u2032 site, forming van der Waals interactions with T24-A and T25-A. In addition, N3 126 forms multiple hydrogen bonds with the main chain of the residues in the substrate-binding 127 pocket, which also helps lock the inhibitor inside the substrate-binding pocket. conformation. This may be attributed to an ordered water (W1) in SARS-CoV M pro -N1 133 structure, which makes a long distance hydrogen bond to the carboxylate oxygen of the 134 ester and also forms two hydrogen bonds from the backbone NH of G143 and the side 135 chain of N142. In our previous study, we proposed that all the CoV M pro s share a highly 136 conserved substrate-recognition pocket, which could serve as a drug target for the design 137 of broad-spectrum inhibitors 12 . The recent discovery of new CoVs and accumulation of 138 structural data for CoV M pro s from various species provided the opportunity to further 139 examine this hypothesis. Superposition of the 12 crystal structures of M pro s 12-21 have shown that the most variable regions were the helical domain \u2162 and surface loops, but the 141 substrate-binding pockets located in a cleft between domains \u2160 and \u2161 are still highly 142 conserved among all CoV M pro s, suggesting the antiviral inhibitors targeting this site should 143 have wide-spectrum anti-CoV activity (Fig. 2b, c) . \u03bcM.

Briefly, the activity of364 COVID-19 virus M pro was measured by a continuous kinetic assay, with the substrate 365 MCA-AVLQSGFR-Lys(Dnp)-Lys-NH2 (GL Biochem, Shanghai), using wavelengths of 366 320 nm and 405 nm for excitation and emission, respectively. The assay started by 367 immediately mixing 0.2 \u03bcM COVID-19 virus M pro with different concentrations of 368 substrate (2.5-100 \u03bcM). Fluorescence intensity was monitored with an EnVision multimode 369 plate reader (Perkin Elmer, USA). Initial rates were obtained by fitting the linear portion 370 of the curves to a straight line. The kinetic parameters Km and kcat were calculated from a 371 double-reciprocal plot. As N3 is a mechanism-based irreversible inhibitor for COVID-pro , kobs/[I] was used as an approximation of the pseudo second-order rate constant 373 to evaluate the inhibition effect of the inhibitor N3 12 . In this case, the measurement was 374 carried out with 0.2 \u03bcM of enzyme, 20 \u03bcM of substrate and inhibitor at 6 different 375 concentrations (0-1 \u03bcM).",
