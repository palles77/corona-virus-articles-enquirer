Microbiological life, microbes, or pathogens in food contribute to food spoilage, disease, illness, and even death. Similarly, microbes in a health care environment may cause disease, infections, sickness, illness, and death. The elimination, killing, or control of microbes is therefore critically important. The processes used for microbe control can affect the properties of materials, especially plastics. That effect is the subject of the bulk of this book. This introductory chapter will be split up into three parts. First will be background on the biology and types of microbes. Then the processes used to control microbial life in the food supply are discussed. That is followed by the control of microbes in the health care environment.",

They occur in animals (dogs, cows, and primates) as well as humans and are rapidly fatal once symptoms develop. Prions propagate by transmitting a misfolded protein state. When a prion enters a healthy organism, it induces existing, properly folded proteins to convert into the disease-associated, prion form. It acts as a template to guide the misfolding of more protein into prion form. This altered structure is extremely stable and accumulates in infected tissue, causing tissue damage and cell death. CJD poses a unique infection prevention problem because prions, which are protein-containing infectious agents, can survive many common sterilization processes.",

Chemical pickling e Food for pickling is placed in an edible liquid that inhibits or kills bacteria and other microorganisms. There are many pickling agents including brine (high in salt), vinegar, alcohol, and vegetable oil (particularly olive oil). Many chemical pickling processes also involve heating or boiling so that the food being preserved becomes saturated with the pickling agent. In fermentation pickling, the food itself produces the preservation agent, typically by a process that produces lactic acid. This is commonly used to preserve vegetables. Salting e Salting has been used extensively for pork, beef, and fish. The origins of salt-preserving food can be traced back to at least ancient Egypt, where they used salt as part of the embalming process, as well as in food preservation.

The idea of using ionizing radiation in food preservation almost immediately followed. The suggestion to use ionizing energy to destroy pathogenic and spoilage microorganisms in food was published in a German medical journal the same year. However, the cost and quantity of this radiation inhibited commercial development until much, much later. The basic history of food irradiation follows 5 :",

Low voltage power, typically three-phase, 440 V AC, is converted to high-frequency (100 kHz) radio frequency (RF) power by an oscillator. A number of rectifiers in series along with an RF resonant transformer convert the RF power into ultra high voltage (2e5 MM V) direct current (DC) power. The DC voltage is sent to the acceleration tube. This tube is a hollow vacuum cylinder made from glass and metal. Glass rings are positioned as insulation rings in between metal rings, called dynodes. An electron gun is positioned at the entry point of the tube. A tungsten filament is the source of electrons that are emitted by heating the filament. The continuous electron stream is accelerated through a vacuum tube, supplying a high-energy beam with a diameter of 2e3 cm. The accelerated beam is transmitted through an oscillating magnetic field with a frequency of 200 Hz that converts the tight beam cone into a wide curtain of electrons with a width of 1e2.5 m. A thin titanium window acts as a window or a filter before the beam reaches the food to be irradiated. A control system monitors all the functions of the various systems of accelerator to insure proper and consistent operation. An accelerator operates based on a number of factors including voltage (electron energy), beam current, and beam power. Because electrons have mass, they can only penetrate about 1.5 inches (3.8 cm) into a typical food product or about 3.5 inches (8.9 cm) if the food product is irradiated on both sides. Electrons also have an electric charge. This charge allows the stream of accelerated electrons to be scanned by magnets to track across the product. A commercial food electron beam irradiator accelerates the electrons to an energy of up to 10,000,000 electron volts [10 million electron volts (MeV)]. Electron beam irradiators typically use massive concrete, steel, or lead shielding. Electron beam accelerators can be turned on and off. Safety interlocks ensure that a person cannot enter the radiation chamber where the food is being irradiated when the accelerator is \"on.\" Product is usually passed through the scanned \"beam\" on roller-type conveyors as shown in Fig. 1.12 . A picture of the electron beam scan horn and conveyor system in the irradiation area is shown in Fig. 1 .13.",

Cobalt-60 radioactively beta decays to Nickel-60 and emits two gamma rays with energies of 1.17 and 1.33 MeV. 6 Cobalt-60 is not found in nature. It is a synthetic radioactive isotope made by neutron activation of Cobalt-59. Cobalt-60 is produced off site in nuclear reactors and transported in special shipping containers (casks) to the sterilization facility. Cobalt-60 is a solid radioactive metal molded into a cylindrical slug as shown in Fig. 1 .14. The slugs are loaded into \"sealed source\" pencils made of stainless steel. The stainless steel sealed source contains the \"radioactive\" Cobalt-60, but allows the gamma photons (radiation) to pass through the steel. The pencils are arranged into flat panel arrays.

The sudden deceleration of the electrons generates X-rays and waste heat. The shielding and product conveyance are similar to that of a chamber-type gamma irradiator ( Fig. 1.15 ). The advantages of X-rays over electron beams are that they have good product penetration (over 24 inches or 60 cm of food product if irradiated on both sides). The advantage of X-rays over gamma irradiators is that they do not require a shielding storage pool. However, there is a substantial loss of energy during the conversion process.

He is considered one of the founders of microbiology, inspiring such major figures as Paul Ehrlich and Gerhard Domagk. Joseph Lister is often considered to be the father of modern surgery, who promoted the idea of sterile surgery while working at the Glasgow Royal Infirmary. Until Lister's studies of surgery, most people believed that chemical damage from exposure to bad air, \"miasma,\" was responsible for infections in wounds. Hospital wards were occasionally aired out at midday as a precaution against the spread of infection via miasma. Hands or a patient's wounds were not washed. While he was a professor of surgery at the University of Glasgow, Lister read a paper published by the French chemist Louis Pasteur, which showed that rotting and fermentation could occur under anaerobic conditions if microorganisms were present. Pasteur suggested three methods to eliminate the microorganisms responsible for gangrene: filtration, exposure to heat, or exposure to chemical solutions. Lister confirmed Pasteur's conclusions with his own experiments and decided to use his findings to develop antiseptic techniques for wounds. Lister successfully introduced carbolic acid (now known as phenol) to sterilize surgical instruments and to clean wounds, which led to reducing postoperative infections and made surgery safer for patients.",

After 4 days, he renewed the pad and discovered that no infection had developed, and after a total of 6 weeks, he was amazed to discover that the boy's bones had fused back together, without the danger of formation or discharge of pus. At that time, the mortality rate of a compound fracture was about 60%. He instructed surgeons under his responsibility to wear clean gloves and wash their hands before and after operations with 5% carbolic acid solutions.

For example, when food is irradiated it is often packaged in plastic materials. How does the irradiation process affect the properties of the packaging?

Sterility indicates the elimination (death) of all viable life forms and their germinative elements such as eggs, spores and endospores. Sterility is absolute; there is no such thing as an object being \"partially sterile.\" Asepsis generally means that only certain types of life forms have been removed, excluded or neutralized (rendered nonviable), while the presence of other organisms may be tolerated or even promoted. For example, pasteurization of food does not kill all microorganisms in the food; it does dramatically reduce the number of microorganisms, with the intent that the pasteurized material is stored in conditions that will maintain that low number, such as refrigeration. Disinfection refers to a process whereby many or all pathogenic microorganisms are neutralized or removed.

However, microwaves must only be used with products that are compatible (e.g. do not melt). Microwaves are radio frequency waves, which are usually used at a frequency of 2450 MHz. The microwaves produce friction of water molecules in an alternating electrical field. The intermolecular friction derived from the vibrations generates heat and some authors believe that the effect of microwaves depends on the heat produced while others postulate a nonthermal lethal effect. The initial reports showed microwaves to be an effective microbicide. The microwaves produced by a \"home-type\" microwave oven (2.45 GHz) completely inactivate bacterial cultures, mycobacteria, viruses, and Geobacillus stearothermophilus spores within 60 s to 5 min depending on the organism. Another study confirmed these results but also found that higher power microwaves in the presence of water may be needed for sterilization. Microwaves used for sterilization of medical devices have not been FDA cleared.",

Gas plasmas are generated in an enclosed chamber under deep vacuum using RF or microwave energy to excite the gas molecules and produce charged particles, many of which are in the form of free radicals. The five stages of the process consist of: The sterilization chamber is evacuated to 0.3 mmHg pressure. Hydrogen peroxide solution is injected from a cassette and is vaporized in the sterilization chamber to a concentration of 6 mg/l. The hydrogen peroxide vapor diffuses through the chamber for about 50 min and exposes all surfaces and initiates the inactivation of microorganisms. At the completion of the diffusion phase, the chamber pressure is reduced to 0.5 torr. An electrical field created by an RF is applied to the chamber to create a gas plasma, which lasts for 15 min. Microbicidal free radicals are generated in the plasma. The excess gas is removed and in the final stage of the process the sterilization chamber is returned to atmospheric pressure by introduction of high-efficiency filtered air. The vapor purged from the chamber is vented to the atmosphere through a catalytic filter to decompose all remaining traces of hydrogen peroxide into water and oxygen vapor. The by-products of the cycle (e.g. water vapor, oxygen) are nontoxic and eliminate the need for aeration. The process operates in the temperature range of 37e44 C and has a cycle time of 75 min.",

Figure 1 .36 shows that UV lights may be mounted within air ducts to destroy airborne organisms; such an application might be found in operating room ventilation. Figure 1 .37 shows an example of UV use in an isolation room. Table 1.9 shows the UV dose required to reduce the populations of various organisms.",

Irradiation of mail is an effort to disinfect it. The most notable instance of mail irradiation occurred in response to the 2001 anthrax attacks; the level of radiation chosen to kill anthrax spores was so high that it often changed the physical appearance of the mail. A facility in Bridgeport, NJ, operated by Sterigenics International, uses a Rhodotron continuous wave electron beam accelerator built by IBA Industrial to irradiate the mail. A few facilities were planning to use Cobalt-60 sources, though it is unclear whether this was ever done. During irradiation, an intense stream of electrons (or X-rays if X-ray technology is used) strikes the mail and any anthrax spores it may contain. The radiation dose is very high, about 56 kGy of radiation, which is approximately 2 million times more than a chest X-ray. Water safety threats (e.g. Vibrio cholerae, Cryptosporidium parvum).",
