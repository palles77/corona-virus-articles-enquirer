Objective: To assess the reporting of these protections for several study designs in general medical journals. Design: A consecutive series of research papers published in the Annals of Internal Medicine, BMJ, JAMA, Lancet and The New England Journal of Medicine between February and May 2003 were reviewed for the reporting of ethical approval and patient consent. Ethical approval, name of approving committee, type of consent, data source and whether the study used data collected as part of a study reported elsewhere were recorded. Differences in failure to report approval and consent by study design, journal and vulnerable study population were evaluated using multivariable logistic regression. Results: Ethical approval and consent were not mentioned in 31% and 47% of manuscripts, respectively. 88 (27%) papers failed to report both approval and consent. Failure to mention ethical approval or consent was significantly more likely in all study designs (except case-control and qualitative studies) than in randomised controlled trials (RCTs). Failure to mention approval was most common in the BMJ and was significantly more likely than in The New England Journal of Medicine. Failure to mention consent was most common in the BMJ and was significantly more likely than in all other journals. No significant differences in approval or consent were found when comparing studies of vulnerable and non-vulnerable participants. Conclusion: The reporting of ethical approval and consent in RCTs has improved, but journals are less good at reporting this information for other study designs. Journals should publish this information for all research on human participants.",

It is, however, important and indeed a requirement of most biomedical journals, that authors of all investigations on human participants state whether the study was approved by an ethics committee and how consent was obtained. Following on from the work of Ruiz-Canela et al 6 and Yank and Rennie, 10 we assessed the reporting of ethical approval and patient consent in five top general medical journals in 2003, by study design. All of these journals have signed up to the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors requirements for ethical protection and explicitly state in their guidance to authors that both ethical approval and consent should be reported.",

Such institutions, including journals, have a role in providing an environment that emphasises the importance of ethical behaviour in research. Journal editors are gate keepers for the integrity of the scientific record. They should try to enforce requirements for authors to meet ethical standards and, as stated in the Declaration of Helsinki, reject research not meeting these requirements. By upholding high standards and explaining to readers and researchers the importance of ethical protection, editors can show researchers that they attach importance to these issues and will publish only those papers that take them into consideration. Although many journals, including those in this study, now provide guidance on including information on ethical approval and obtaining consent in their instructions to authors, many do not enforce these requirements effectively. Journal editors should introduce effective mechanisms to ensure that this information is reported for all research on human participants.

Clearly, case studies differ from other research study designs and the practice of reporting ethical protection may be different for each journal. The BMJ, for example, routinely checks that the patient has consented but rarely reports this information owing to limited editorial space in the print journal. Arguably, it may be more important to ask and declare consent for case reports and case series as patients with rare conditions can be easily identified by readers.",

Authors reporting additional analysis of a previously reported study often made reference to another paper, implying that details about methods and ethical protection may be reported there. Although we recorded whether authors made reference to another paper, we did not follow up and check whether that paper contained all the necessary information. It is important to make statements in every paper to help avoid publishing unethical research. 9 It is also possible that authors may have submitted this information to the journal, but that owing to word restrictions this information was omitted during the publishing process. Where this information was not reported, this does not mean that the journal did not check with the authors that they had obtained approval and consent.",
