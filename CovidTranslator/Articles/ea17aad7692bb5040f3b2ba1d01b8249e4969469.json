Viral titers in hospitalized patients can fluctuate day-to-day with lack of 140 correlation to disease severity 17-19 , and thus a single negative qRT-PCR test for SARS-141 CoV-2 does not exclude infection. The virus has also been shown to be shed in stool 20 , 142 raising the possibility of environmental contamination contributing to local disease 143 outbreaks. Low testing platforms such as the DETECTR CRISPR-Cas12 assay 144 developed here may be useful for periodic repeat testing of patient samples. Clinical 145 validation of this assay in response to recent draft guidance from the US FDA 7 is 146 currently ongoing in a CLIA (Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments)-certified 147 microbiology laboratory. 148 The major pandemics and large-scale epidemics of the past half century have all 149 been caused by zoonotic viruses. Despite these recurrent outbreaks, we still do not 150 have a programmable point of care (POC) diagnostic platform that can be used to 151 promptly address any emerging viral threat. The CRISPR-based DETECTR technology 152provides such a platform, which we have reconfigured within days to detect SARS-CoV-153 2(Supplementary Fig. 6). Here we developed a SARS-CoV-2 DETECTR assay, 154described its performance characteristics and demonstrated compatibility with lateral 155 flow strips. The future development of portable microfluidic-based cartridges to run the 156 assay and use of lyophilized reagents will enable POC testing outside of the clinical 157 diagnostic laboratory, such as airports, local emergency departments and clinics, and 158 other decentralized locations. 159 (~1343 words, max 2000 words) 160",

LAMP primers were added at a 243 final concentration of 0.2 \u00b5M for F3 and B3, 1.6 \u00b5M for FIP and BIP, and 0.8 \u00b5M for LF 244 and LB.

A single band, close to the 259 pad indicated a negative result, whereas a single band close to the 260 top of the strip or two bands indicated a positive result. 261 262 Optimized DETECTR method for patient samples 263The patient optimized DETECTR assays were performed using RT-LAMP 264 method as described above with the following modifications: A DNA binding dye, 265 SYTO9 (Thermo Fisher Scientific), was included in the reaction to monitor the 266 amplification reaction and the incubation time was extended to 30 minutes to capture 267 data from lower titre samples. 268The fluorescence based patient optimized LbCas12a trans-cleavage assays 269were performed as described above with modifications; 40nM LbCas12a was pre-270 incubated with 40nM gRNA, after which 100nM of a fluorescent reporter molecule 271 compatible with detection in the presence of the SYTO9 dye 272 (/5Alex594N/TTATTATT/3IAbRQSp/) was added to the complex. 2 \u00b5L of amplicon was 273 combined with 18 \u00b5L of LbCas12a-gRNA complex in a black 384-well assay plate and 274 monitored for fluorescence using a Tecan plate reader. 275 276 Contrived sample preparation. 277 In-vitro transcribed RNA (gift from California Department of Public Health 278 (CDPH)), with a titer of 10,000 copies/\u00b5L (Ct value of 21) was diluted into 2,500 279 copies/\u00b5L first, then serially diluted in water to concentration of 1 clinical sample collection and preparation 284 Negative nasopharyngeal swabs were acquired from healthy donors in Chiu lab 285 with the approval of the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) IRB. Clinical 286 nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swab samples of SARS-CoV-2 patients were 287 collected in UTM and transported to the CDPH or UCSF lab.

SARS-CoV-2 DETECTR assay (RT-LAMP + Cas12a) was evaluated on 314 IVT RNA products from SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, bast-SL-CoVZC45, and clinical 315 samples from common human coronaviruses. As expected, the N-gene is only detected 316 in SARS-CoV-2, whereas the E-gene is detected only in SARS-CoV-2 and bat-SL-317 CoVZC45. SARS-CoV E-gene was not detected as the RT-LAMP primer set is not 318 capable of amplifying the SARS-CoV E-gene, even though the E-gene gRNA is capable 319 of detecting the SARS-CoV E-gene target site. RNase P is detected in common human 320 coronaviruses because these samples are RNA extracted from clinical samples.
