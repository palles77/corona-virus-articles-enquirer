The field of virology has done a remarkable job of characterizing and categorizing viruses and defining the steps of viral attachment, entry, replication and release. Moreover, an understanding of viral protein function has paved the way for the development of antiviral drugs that target viral enzymatic activities. However, many of these drugs function poorly at best, and the virus-centric approach has not proved to be well suited for deciphering the complex and multifaceted virus-host interactions that underlie viral recognition, innate immune signalling and disease outcome. In the past decade, tools have become available to chart a new course, one directed at obtaining comprehensive systems-level views of the host response and the interplay between virus and host.",

Moreover, for dynamic systems such as those involved in the host response to viral infection, systemslevel analyses are considered the only way to understand emergent properties -that is, properties or biological outcomes that cannot be predicted by an understanding of the individual parts of a system alone, but rather become apparent only with knowledge of the specific organization of, and interactions between, components 5 .

Over the past 12 years, DNA microarrays have evolved from hundreds of cDNAs spotted on nylon membranes to glass slides containing high-density oligonucleotides that encompass entire genomes (BOX 1) . Microarrays (then covering only 1,500 human genes) were first used in virology to evaluate the changes in cellular gene expression that occurred in a CD4 + T cell line infected with HIV 8 . Since then, the use of microarrays to evaluate changes in host gene expression in response to viral infection has become commonplace. In many cases, these studies remain small and narrowly focused, and although they provide glimpses into global responses, low sample numbers make it difficult to determine their reproducibility. In addition, these studies do not provide the robust data sets that are needed for computational modelling, which could result in deep insights into system architecture or behaviour. This shortcoming has perhaps fed scepticism regarding the ability of genome-wide expression profiling to yield transformative discoveries. Below, we provide examples of more comprehensive studies resulting in genomic signatures that have increased our understanding of both viral pathogenesis and the characteristics of the host response required for immune protection.",

Most strains cause mild respiratory disease, whereas others, such as the 1918 pandemic virus and highly pathogenic avian H5N1 influenza virus strains (such as A/VN/1203/04), can cause severe and often fatal infections 9 . The field has used DNA microarrays and functional analyses to define the virus-host interactions that regulate influenza virus pathogenesis 10 . These studies have identified gene expression signatures that correlate with virulence and have revealed that the timing and magnitude of the host response is a crucial determinant of the eventual outcome of infection. This phenomenon was first demonstrated in studies that used a combination of mouse and macaque infection models and genome-wide transcriptional profiling to measure the host response to the reconstructed 1918 pandemic virus. In these animal models, the virus causes a rapidly fatal infection marked by severe lung pathology, intense neutrophil infiltration and the rapid and sustained induction of pro-inflammatory cytokine and chemokine genes 11, 12 , an event often referred to as a cytokine storm 13 . By contrast, macaques infected with a highly pathogenic avian H5N1 influenza virus strain show a rapid and intense induction of interferon (IFN) and innate immune genes, but this eventually resolves as the animals recover 14 . Genomic analyses have also revealed that macaques infected with the 1918 pandemic strain 15 and mice infected with H5N1 influenza virus A/VN/1203/04 show a strong induction of genes encoding inflammasome components (for example, NLRP3 (NOD-, LRR-and pyrin domain-containing 3) and interleukin-1\u03b2) 16 . This H5N1 virus is particularly virulent in mice, and although the inflammasome is part of the innate immune response to influenza A viruses [17] [18] [19] , Figure 1 | The systems virology paradigm. Appropriate experimental models and technologies are used to generate multidimensional data, including virology data. Analyses of such data, in combination with mathematical modelling, are used to generate comprehensive, integrated and predictive models of biological systems and virus-host interactions.

These findings and outcomes can be used directly or further refined by the scientific community for various types of disease intervention.",

Two alternative methods were used to generate gene expression signatures that are predictive of high or mild pathogenicity (defined here as 100% mortality and 100% survival, respectively). The first signature consists of 74 genes for which expression changes in the opposite direction in highly versus mildly pathogenic infections, with respect to mock infections (referred to as a 'digital' relationship). The second signature consists of 57 genes that are differentially expressed between highly and mildly pathogenic infections, without reference to mock infections (referred to as an 'analogue' relationship). Most genes in the analogue signature are differentially expressed during both lethal and non-lethal infections (compared with mock infections), but high pathogenicity corresponds with a higher degree of differential expression.",

Therefore, knowing the identity of genes that are differentially expressed in response to infection provides only part of the information needed to predict patho genicity. The magnitude and timing of the host response are crucial determinants of the eventual disease outcome and might have important implications for antiviral therapy. To date, efforts to target the host response with a range of anti-inflammatory drugs have been largely unsuccessful 13 , and it is likely that effective host-directed therapy will depend not only on the target, but also on exactly when elements of the host response are suppressed or enhanced. Moreover, these findings point to the need for computational approaches that can describe nonlinear relationships (see below) and account for various factors associated with large multivariate data sets 21 . This also suggests the need for a paradigm shift in biomarker discovery to one that looks at sets of quantitative molecular measurements.",

Over a 3-year period, a Box 1 | Microarrays DNA microarrays are widely used for global transcriptome profiling and remain the workhorse technology of systems biology. Microarrays can trace at least part of their ancestry to the Southern blot, in which DNA fragments are immobilized on a filter membrane for subsequent detection by hybridization of labelled DNA, and Southern himself has provided a detailed description of the many early technological developments that together led to the first commercial microarrays 93 . Over the past 15 years, the technology has progressed from cDNAs deposited on membranes by spotting robots, to commercial microarrays consisting of tens of thousands of oligonucleotides on glass slides or other solid supports. Today, major commercial providers of microarrays include Affymetrix, Agilent Technologies, Illumina and NimbleGen, with platforms varying in the length of oligonucleotide used, the number of oligonucleotides representing each gene, and the methods used for oligonucleotide synthesis and attachment to solid supports. Although microarrays are best known for their use in profiling the expression of protein-coding genes, the technology has also been adapted for profiling of microRNA expression, DNA methylation and SNPs, as well as for promoter analysis and the detection of genome-wide DNA copy number variation. Methods have also been developed to extract RNA from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) samples, a technique that has opened the door for microarray-based gene expression profiling of the large numbers of clinical samples that have been archived using this preservation method. Microarrays can now provide considerably more information about virus-host interactions than simply the differential expression of protein-coding genes in response to viral infection [94] [95] [96] [97] . series of clinical studies was undertaken in which young adults were vaccinated with either inactivated influenza vaccine (TIV) or live-attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV). Molecular signatures for predicting antibody responses were identified by combining gene expression profiling, antibody response data, real-time PCR analysis and DAMIP. The resulting predictive signature consisted of genes with known roles in antibody responses and other genes with previously unidentified roles in antibody or B cell responses. For example, one gene from the predictive signature, Camk4, encodes calcium-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase type IV (CaMKIV), a protein known to be involved in multiple immune system processes. However, it was not known whether this protein had a role in antibody responses 25 . To demonstrate the ability of the systems biology approaches used in this study to identify biologically significant targets, Camk4-knockout and wild-type mice were vaccinated with TIV, and the Camk4-knockout mice exhibited significantly higher antibody titres than wild-type mice 7, 14 and 28 days after vaccination, thus revealing that Camk4 is important in regulating B cell responses. Although further investigations are needed to confirm many of these signature predictions, these studies demonstrate that systems approaches can both identify biological targets and generate new testable hypotheses related to the mechanism of vaccine action.",

Interestingly, the changes are consistent across different strains of the same virus and across cell types, but differ markedly between HCMV and HSV-1, demonstrating that these viruses induce distinct metabolic programmes. The findings derived from these systems-level approaches generated the hypotheses needed to drive additional focused studies in which more traditional methods were used to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying the virus-specific hijacking of the host metabolome and the relevance of these mechanisms to potential therapeutic interventions [38] [39] [40] [41] [42] .",

This has a number of advantages over microarray-based profiling, including the ability to identify and quantify rare or as-yet-undiscovered transcripts and the ability to provide information on alternative splicing, genetic variation, and gene and exon boundaries. The method used for the construction of the cDNA library determines the type of transcripts to be sequenced; these include small RNAs (<200 bases; for example, microRNAs, small nucleolar RNAs and PIWI-interacting RNAs), mRNAs (various types of polyadenylated transcripts) or whole transcriptomes (polyadenylated and non-polyadenylated transcripts). After sequence reads are generated, they are aligned to a known reference genome, or if no reference genome is available, sequences can be assembled de novo. Because of the short length of sequence reads, the alignment and assembly of sequence information is a significant computational challenge 100 . Additional potential applications of next-generation sequencing that are relevant to systems virology include the detection of binding events involving protein-DNA (ChIP-seq (chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing)) or protein-RNA (RIP-seq and CLIP-seq (crosslinking immunoprecipitation followed by high-throughput sequencing)) and DNA methylation profiling (Methyl-seq) 59, 101, 102 .",

Such interactomes have been generated for numerous viruses, including influenza virus, HIV, dengue virus, hepa titis C virus (HCV), herpesviruses and SARS CoV, and have yielded 'hit lists' of cellular factors that might be important in viral pathogenesis [44] [45] [46] [47] [48] [49] [50] [51] . Although the number of interactions identified by these studies is impressive, few of the genes identified have been subjected to functional analyses to confirm their role in viral replication. Moreover, there is little overlap in the host factors identified by the different screens. This could be due to a variety of factors, including variation in the screening systems, cell types and viruses used, as well as differences in the methods applied to identify interacting partners.

Common targets include proteins involved in the cell cycle, apoptosis, the unfolded-protein response and nuclear transport. Many of the common host targets identified are multifunctional hubs -that is, they have multiple functions or roles within the cell. When coupled with the fact that many viral proteins interact with multiple host proteins, this combination of factors might explain how viruses, with their relatively small genomes, are capable of dysregulating so many aspects of host biology.

By defining the rewiring of cellular networks and pathways caused by the viral proteins and identifying a list of host proteins that are central to the rewiring, the systematic identification of host targets of DNA tumour viruses was found to be as successful as traditional large-scale cataloguing of tumour mutations for cancer gene identification.

Twenty-one high-confidence eQTLs were identified, 17 of which were confirmed using mice from the eight Collaborative Cross founder strains 58 . Many of these genes have known functions related to immunity or the host response to infection, such as Ifi27l2a (IFN\u03b1-inducible 27-like 2A), Clec16a, Pde7a (high-affinity cyclic AMPspecific 3\u2032,5\u2032-cyclic phosphodiesterase 7A) and Tcf7l1 (transcription factor 7-like 1), whereas for others, such as the serine/threonine protein kinase gene Sik1 and sentrin-specific protease 5 (Senp5), their role in influenza virus infection is not yet clear. Structural equation modelling was used to identify potential regulatory relationships between additional genes and the validated eQTLs, suggesting that these genes and corresponding subnetworks have important roles in the host response by either promoting a protective (mild) or a pathologic (severe) response to influenza virus infection, depending on the specific genetics of the host. Thus, using this genetically diverse population, high-confidence gene candidates involved in regulating the host response to influenza virus infection were identified, allowing for future investigations into their utility as therapeutic targets.

Such populations are used to study complex traits and are most beneficial when they contain large numbers of lines that exhibit substantial and uniform genetic variation. In the case of the Collaborative Cross, five inbred strains (A/J, C57BL/6J, 129S1/SvImJ, NOD/ShiLtJ and NZO/HlLtJ) and three wild-derived strains (CAST/EiJ, PWK/PhH and WSB/EiJ) are being used to generate a large panel of RI lines through a randomized funnel breeding scheme 103 , resulting in hundreds of independent RI lines in which genetic variation is randomly and uniformly distributed throughout the genome. When they are established, RI lines can be intercrossed among themselves to generate recombinant intercross (RIX) lines or backcrossed to other non-Collaborative Cross lines to generate RI backcross (RIB) lines. RIX lines maximize genetic diversity, and because they are outbred, they are better models of human populations and can provide information on gene dominance and epistasis 104 . RIB lines can be used, for example, to evaluate whether specific allele combinations alter the phenotype associated with a given target gene (such as a dominant targeted gene knockout). For example, a comparison between viral titre in the lungs and the extent of airway inflammation for a panel of pre-Collaborative Cross (not fully inbred) mice demonstrates the impact of genetic diversity on influenza virus disease phenotypes (see the figure; each diamond represents a different mouse). Phenotypes range from high viral titre and high inflammation to low viral titre and little inflammation; in addition, some animals show unique phenotypes, such as a high viral titre with little accompanying inflammation.

These models helped to elucidate key molecular and cellular processes governing epithelial cell apoptosis and proliferation in response to TNF treatment. For example, monocyte chemotactic protein 1 (MCP1; also known as CCL2) was predicted by the model to be especially protective against TNFinduced apoptosis, and this hypothesis was confirmed by treating with an MCP1-specific antibody before TNF administration.

Similar evidence is accumulating that the outcome of HIV infection is also related to the activation dynamics of host gene regulation 77, 78 . However, high-throughput data are typically static and often not adequate for modelling dynamic systems. To help overcome this limitation in analysing network dynamics, inference method ologies are being devised to reinterpret activity differences caused by system perturbations as differences in observation time. For example, changes in pathogen-induced gene expression that are associated with genetic variability, whether in the pathogen (for example, mutant viruses) or the host (as occurs in the Collaborative Cross mouse model), can potentially be used to indirectly infer the crucial dynamics of a system without having to measure the system over time.

SVD-MDS and co-abundance networks (which relate molecules to each other on the basis of their abundance profiles) were also used to integrate proteomic and metabolomic data sets obtained from the same cohort of patients. This strategy identified a potential role for oxidative stress in rapid fibrosis progression after the transplant surgery and identified serum metabolites that might prove useful as biomarkers for predicting progression to fibrosis 84 . This understanding of network structure can now be used to simulate human liver metabolism using novel flux balance modelling approaches to better comprehend and eventually treat disease 85 . Additional geometrical approaches have been described and should prove useful for effectively bridging different technologies 86, 87 and for integrating diverse types of data, thereby enabling better analysis of the data that are already available in public databases and repositories. Finally, geometrical methods, as well as links between geometry, information theory and probability theory 7 , will also help to identify causal relationships 88 , which is clearly a currently unmet challenge. Unlike purely statistical approaches, geometrical methods can be used to integrate different individual measures for the purposes of comparison and combination into coherent objects that identify relationships between genes, transcripts or proteins.",

Systems-level approaches provide the opportunity to assemble the incomplete puzzle of biology in a meaningful way that will advance our understanding of how viruses cause disease and lead to improved patient care. Although there will always be a need for traditional microbiology, the success of undergraduates in this day and age will depend on their ability to combine traditional skills with systems approaches and mathematics. The time is ripe, the data are here, and the mathematics to put them together is coming along.

The complexity of virus-host interactions can be unravelled only through meta-analyses that rely on advanced computational and mathematical approaches and the integration of large, coherent and systematic multi-dimensional data sets. Owing to the immense amounts of time, expertise, manpower and expense that are required to produce these data sets, it is imperative for the systems virology community to share data in a timely manner. In most cases, owing to the richness of information contained in these data sets, this can be done with little chance of compromising one's own research. Two of the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID)-sponsored Bioinformatics Resource Centers, ViPR (Virus Pathogen Resource) and IRD (Influenza Research Database), are charged with capturing, publically sharing, storing, integrating and visualizing systems-wide high-throughput omics data sets that detail the host response to viral infection. Importantly, in addition to capturing data types such as transcriptomic, proteomic, metabolomic, lipidomic and ChIP-seq (chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing) data, the goal of these databases is to capture extensive metadata that provide users with the experimental details needed to facilitate data interpretation. The practice of linking metadata to several forms of the omics data (be it raw, analysed or modelled) enables ViPR and IRD to meet the demands of a range of end users (see the figure) . For instance, at their portals, users can search for information on individual genes, download lists of differentially expressed genes or link metadata to raw data for doing meta-analysis. All laboratories, as a service to the community, should be committed to sharing these types of data sets, whether through organization-specific public websites, the appropriate NIAID Bioinformatics Resource Center or a combination of both.",
