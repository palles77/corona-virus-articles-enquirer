Hackett's previous review of innate immune activation as a broad-spectrum biodefense strategy identified several unresolved questions. The current article is a systematic approach to answering those questions with the focused participation of research groups developing this technology. Our team of academic and industry participants reviewed the promising agents and came to the following conclusions. It is feasible to construct a biodefense platform combining synergistic agents that activate the innate immune system against a broad range of pathogens on the basis of conserved microbial components by using a nasal spray for immune activation in the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts because these are the most likely routes of attack. It might also be possible to include agents that inhibit molecular events leading to septic shock. Innate immune-activating agents designed to activate Toll-like and other receptors will probably provide protection against the biothreat pathogen spectrum for periods ranging from 2 to 14 days for IFNs up to 26 weeks for immunomodulatory oligonucleotides. Initial treatment is proposed on the first index case or biosensor alert. Boost doses would be required. Harmful inflammation is possible, but thus far, only transient fever has been observed. Autoimmune reaction and retroviral activation have not been seen thus far in preclinical and human trials of many of these compounds. Toll-like receptor agonists caused cytokine production in all subjects tested, but genetic polymorphism reduced the response to IFN in African American subjects.

As mentioned above, TLRs are type I transmembrane and endosomically expressed proteins that are evolutionarily conserved and have been identified as the key pathogen recognition receptors in innate immunity. TLRs 1 through 10 are present on human innate immune cells and act through cellular signal cascade to augment host immune response through inflammation. TLR agonists can modify host inflammatory responses, potentially offering increased protection from infection. Currently, TLR agonists are licensed and being used in human subjects in the setting of microbial infection and cancer. They can be tailored to specific diseases and administered through multiple routes. Microbial ligands recognized by TLRs are constitutively expressed and highly conserved structural molecules less prone to rapid genetic mutation, and thus TLR agonists are less likely to select for resistant strains (Fig 1) .",

Potent antiviral activity in mouse and primate models against herpes simplex virus (HSV) 1 and 2, cytomegalovirus, Banzivirus, Rift Valley fever, influenza, and West Nile has been demonstrated. Their IRM models also suggest utility against Leishmania, Listeria, and Mycobacterium species. Imiquimod is currently applied 2 to 3 times per week with active immunomodulatory effects between treatments. IRM models suggest administration 3 to 4 days before exposure provides adequate anti-infective protection. Rare inflammatory side effects have been reported, specifically in those with T cell-mediated autoimmune disorders that subside after therapy is discontinued. Potential systemic side effects, such as fever, are possible in conjunction with cytokine toxicity. Genetic polymorphisms might play a role in response variability. 3M screened blood from more than 100 individuals and demonstrated variable IRM response, but cytokine production was observed in all subjects. Fatigue and influenza-like symptoms have been reported with use. There is concern about the relationship between TLR7 agonists and autoimmune disease; however, in extensive preclinical and clinical trials with IRMs, autoimmunity has not been observed. Aldara (imiquimod 5% cream) has gone through phase III clinical trials and is approved for the treatment of external genital warts, actinic keratosis, and basal cell carcinoma.

Three different classes of CpG oligodeoxynucleotides (ODNs) are distinguished by their structure and immune effects.

Conversely, B-class (type K) CpG ODNs induce modest IFN-a production, weak NK cell activation, and profound B-cell and monocyte activation, with secretion of IgM, IL-10, and IL-6. 7 C-class CpG ODNs have intermediate immune effects 7 and are very stable in vivo, with easy formulation. CPG 7909, a B-class ODN, was the first ODN to enter clinical trials in 1999. CPG 10101, a C-class ODN, recently entered clinical trials as monotherapy for chronic HCV infection. A recently developed type of CpG ODN (fma CpG ODN) by Daniela Verthelyi and Serge Beaucage at the FDA has an altered chemistry that will allow for CpG ODNs to be prepared as prodrugs, thereby easing their production (Beaucage and Verthelyi, unpublished data).",

There is also some evidence suggesting synergy with antibiotic treatment to infection (Mycobacterium avium and clarithromycin) and the possibility of postexposure efficacy. Class CPG 7909 has been tolerated locally and systemically in more than 700 subjects thus far, with flu-like symptoms and transient injection site reactions commonly seen in patients receiving more than 1 mg. C-class CPG 10101 has shown a similar safety profile in clinical trials with more than 80 healthy volunteers or HCV-infected subjects. Possible proinflammatory activity through the intranasal route and autoimmune disease has been described in mice. 8 The use of CpG ODNs in most models requires that they be administered 3 to 6 days before infection. Newly developed fma CpG ODNs have backbones with thermolytic protective moieties that prolong the ODN activity. At 37\u00b0C, the ODNs become spontaneously deprotected, ultimately allowing ODNs to act as prodrugs. 9 Studies in rodents have shown that CpG ODNs have immunoprotective effects against the following pathogens: bacteria (Bacillus anthracis, Francisella tularensis, Listeria monocytogenes, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Mycobacterium species, Brucella abortus, Burkholderia mallei, Burkholderia pseudomallei, Salmonella typhi, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Orientia tsutsugamushi), viruses (vaccinia and other orthopox viruses, arena, Ebola, Venezuelan equine encephalitis, Friend leukemia, HSV papillomavirus, cytomegalovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, murine acquired immunodeficiency virus complex, and influenza), fungus (Cryptococcus neoformans), and parasites (malaria, Leishmania major, and toxoplasmosis). CpG DNA innate protection was evident for a period of from approximately 2 days after treatment up to 2 weeks later, with possible repeated administration for extended protection. 10 The experience in primates is more restricted. Protection was only demonstrated thus far when CpG ODNs of type D were administered to macaques infected with L major. 11 Although theoretic concerns remain regarding the possibility that TLR9 agonist therapy could trigger harmful inflammation, this has not been seen in initial clinical trials in human subjects. Other concerns include genetic polymorphism. 12 Lederer, at Harvard, is working with Coley Pharmaceutical Group on a synergistic platform, combining their CpG ODNs with a double-stranded RNA, Ampligen (see later), which stimulates immune reactions through TLR3. CPG 7909 has shown some positive results in several human clinical trials involving a total of more than 900 subjects as an adjuvant for hepatitis B, flu, and cancer vaccines and in the treatment of melanoma, renal cell carcinoma, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, and lung cancer.

CRX-527 is a highly active synthetic TLR4 agonist that induces innate resistance to airway challenge by viral and bacterial pathogens. Studies in mice have demonstrated that CRX-527 enhances protective immunity in the airways to L monocytogenes, influenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus, and Haemophilus influenzae, with resistance to infection persisting between 4 and 7 days accompanied by induction of cytokines, chemokines, defensins, and type 1 IFNs. Animal models suggest response within hours of administration and lasting up to a week. Weekly or biweekly administration can extend protection without inducing tolerance. Protective doses of CRX-527 are significantly lower than toxic doses, suggesting a safe therapeutic index. 19 ,20 A phase I, multidose, dose-escalation trial with CRX-527 (a high-activity TLR4 agonist) is scheduled for early 2006. It is expected that CRX-527's effects will last between 3 and 7 days, with biweekly dosing extending the duration for 6 to 12 weeks. Redosing might avoid prolonged innate stimulation and potential autoimmune reactions. Biweekly intranasal delivery has not been associated with systemic inflammation. Corixa does not anticipate that genetic polymorphism will significantly affect TLR4 agonist responses; however, a recent study suggests phylogenetic and individual diversity in TLR4 responses, suggesting possible variability in efficacy for TLR4 agonists. A phase I clinical trial with CRX675 was recently completed, with no serious or severe adverse events reported. Additional clinical trials with CRX527 (phase I safety study) and CRX675 (phase II) are planned for 2006.",

Data in mice demonstrate prevention of lethal respiratory vaccinia infections with IFN-a and IFN-g. 24 Proposed effectiveness might include early postexposure studies for bunyaviruses, arenaviruses, flaviviruses, coronaviruses, and orthomyxoviruses. AFG Biosolutions has addressed the aforementioned questions as follows: IFNs ultimately provide the antiviral and immunoregulatory protection induced by TLR3, TLR7/TLR8, and TLR9 ligands for pre-exposure prophylaxis. Exogenous administration of IFNs will activate antiviral pathways faster than TLR ligands and might be an effective form of preventative therapy before and after exposure for certain viral infections. Anticipated duration is between days and weeks for a daily dose of IFNs given for 5 to 14 days (or biweekly doses given over 1 to 2 weeks if using pegylated IFNs). There are side effects to chronic IFN treatment seen thus far in HBV and HCV treatment, including flu-like symptoms, fatigue, depression, nausea, weight loss, musculoskeletal pain, and leucopenia. However, midterm to long-term protection can be administered for weeks to months at nontoxic doses. Prophylaxis through IFNs could trigger harmful inflammation because IFN therapy has resulted in autoimmune reactions in various case reports with large doses of IFNs. Smaller doses over a short period of time or autoantibody serial testing to monitor for exacerbations might limit possible autoimmune reactions. Genetic polymorphism is likely to play a role in IFN responsiveness. Race appears to affect responsiveness to IFN therapy in HCV (African American subjects have a reduced response relative to white subjects). Published data cited by AFG Biosolutions demonstrate the safety of aerosol IFNs; however, in-depth evaluation for treatment in infectious diseases in human subjects must be demonstrated. Literature from the mid-1980s using aerosolized IFNs for treatment of rhinovirus infections shows that aerosolized IFNs resulted in some reduction in virus replication but little relief from symptoms and increased blood and nasal secretions compared with placebo. 25, 26 Inhaled IFN is likely to have similar side effects to current routes of administration, which might be acceptable in the setting of a biothreat agent (BTA).

Anti-HMGB1 antibodies have been shown to prevent death in animal models by inhibiting the activity of HMGB1, which disrupts epithelial cells in organs. 30 Tracey and colleagues are currently investigating this possibility for a7 expression and cholinergic agonist responsiveness. CAP68 (acetylcholine agonist) is a small molecule that prevents overproduction of cytokines like TNF and HMGB1. This is accomplished by targeting a7 receptors on macrophages, which in turn inhibit nuclear factor kB activity, the cytokine regulator responsible for the release of the lethal cytokines TNF and HMGB1. Blocking HMGB1 has already been shown to prevent death caused by peritonitis, 30 supporting CAP68's possible role in lethal infection. It is likely that anti-HMGB1 antibodies will enter clinical trials within 12 to 18 months.",

In theory, the most broadly active immunopotentiators should yield the broadest protective response. Candidates for innate immune receptor activation include TLR3, TLR4, TLR7, TLR8, TLR9, T H 1, CD4, and the IFN-a and IFN-g receptors. Concern exists for variable expression of targets between small animal models and human models (eg, human subjects express TLR9 and TLR8, whereas mice only express TLR9 but in a much greater variety of cell types). Thus a correlate between the efficacy and duration seen in animal models must take into account these species-specific differences to accurately represent human response to immunomodulation. The most likely route of attack (respiratory or gastrointestinal) is probably the ideal route of protection to minimize drug exposure.",

Protection with immunomodulators usually lasts between 1 and 2 weeks, regardless of the mechanism targeted. The potential for readministration should extend the protective effects for greater than 2 weeks. The exact duration will vary on mechanism of action, delivery method, and any adverse effects of chronic use. 3. Enhancing innate immunity carries an inherent risk of inflammatory response. Some immunomodulators, such as TLR4 agonists, raise concerns for the possibility of innate overactivity on the basis of their pivotal role in the development of septic shock. 4. Some individuals are more prone to autoimmune reaction or retroviral activation with innate immunomodulation. This becomes increasingly more likely if the target yields polyclonal B-cell activation (ie, TLR9 and TLR7/TLR8 agonists) because of increased likelihood for loss of self-tolerance and development of autoantibodies. There is also some concern for the possible relationship between IFN and autoimmunity that remains to be established. 5. Genetic polymorphism is an important potential variable, depending on the molecular target selected for therapy. Better comprehension of genetic variability could lead to improved treatment for nonresponders and discovery of novel targets for innate immunomodulation and could affect adverse events (inflammatory response) in predisposed individuals.",
