Similarly, the ORF1ab poly-protein retains high sequence identity in SARS-CoV-2 and 129 several known antagonists contained within the poly-protein (NSP1, NSP7, NSP14-16) are 130 highly conserved relative to SARS-CoV. One notable exception is the large papain-like 131 proteases, NSP3, which only 76% conserved between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. However, 132 SARS-CoV-2 does maintain a deubiquitinating domain thought to confer IFN resistance 29 . For 133 SARS-CoV ORF3b, a 154 amino acid (AA) protein known to antagonize the type I IFN 134 responses by blocking IRF3 phosphorylation 30 , sequence alignments indicates that the SARS-135 CoV-2 equivalent ORF3b contains a premature stop codon resulting in a truncated 24 AA 136 protein.

            "text": "162With a similar genome organization and disease symptoms in humans, the SARS-CoV-2 163 outbreak has drawn insights from the closely related SARS-CoV. However, the differences in 164 sensitivity to IFN-I pretreatment illustrate a clear distinction between the two CoVs. Coupled with 165 a novel furin cleavage site 32 , robust upper airway infection 8 , and potential transmission prior to 166 symptomatic disease 33 , the differences between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 could prove 167important in disrupting the ongoing spread of COVID-19. For SARS-CoV, in vitro studies have 168 consistently found that wild-type SARS-CoV is indifferent to IFN-I pretreatment 34,35 . Similarly, in 169 vivo SARS-CoV studies have found that the loss of IFN-I signaling had no significant impact on 170 disease 36 , suggesting that this virus is not sensitive to the antiviral effects of IFN-I. However, 171 more recent reports suggest that host genetic background may majorly influence this finding 37 . 172 For SARS-CoV-2, our results suggest that IFN-I pretreatment produces a 3 -4 log drop in viral 173 correlates to STAT1 phosphorylation. This level of sensitivity is similar to MERS-CoV 174 and suggests that the novel CoV lacks the same capacity to escape a primed IFN-I response as 175 SARS-CoV 38,39 . Notably, the sensitivity to IFN-I does not completely ablate viral replication; 176 unlike SARS-CoV 2'O methyl-transferase mutants 34 , SARS-CoV-2 is able to replicate to low, 177 detectable levels even in the presence of IFN-I. This finding could help explain positive test in 178 patients with minimal symptoms and the range of disease observed. In addition, while SARS-179 CoV-2 is sensitive to IFN-I pretreatment, both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV employ effective 180 means to disrupt virus recognition and downstream signaling until late during infection 40 ; a 181 similar mechanism may also be employed by SARS-CoV, diminishing the overall effect of IFN-I 182 during infection. 183 For SARS-CoV-2, the sensitivity to IFN-I indicates a distinction from SARS-CoV and 184 suggests differential host innate immune modulation between the viruses. The loss of ORF3b 185 and truncation/changes in ORF6 could signal a reduced capacity of SARS-CoV-2 to interfere 186 with type I IFN responses. For SARS-CoV ORF6, the N-terminal domain has been shown to 187 have a clear role in its ability to disrupt karyopherin transport 31 ; in turn, the loss of ORF6 188 function for SARS-CoV-2 would likely render it much more susceptible to IFN-I pretreatment as 189 activated STAT1 has the capacity to enter the nucleus and induce ISGs and the antiviral 190 response. In these studies, we have found that following IFN-I pretreatment, STAT1 191 phosphorylation is induced following SARS-CoV-2 infection. The increase in ISG proteins 192 (STAT1, IFIT2, TRIM25) suggests that SARS-CoV-2 ORF6 does not effectively block nuclear 193 transport as well as SARS ORF6. For SARS-CoV ORF3b, the viral protein has been shown to 194 disrupt phosphorylation of IRF3, a key transcriptional factor in the induction of IFN-I and the 195 antiviral state 30 . While its mechanism of action is not clear, the ORF3b absence in SARS-CoV-2 196 infection likely impacts its ability to inhibit the IFN-I response and eventual STAT1 activation. 197Similarly, while NSP3 deubiquitinating domain remains intact, SARS-CoV-2 has a 24 AA 198 of this deubiquitinating domain that could potentially alter that function29 .  199    While other antagonists are maintained with high levels of conservation (>90%), single point 200 mutations in key locations could modify function and contribute to increased IFN sensitivity. 201",

However, the findings 206 from the SARS-CoV outbreak were complicated by combination therapy of type I IFN with other 207 treatments including ribavirin/steroids and lack of a regimented protocol. While type I IFN has 208 been utilized to treat MERS-CoV infected patients, no conclusive data yet exists to determine 209 efficacy 43 . Yet, in vivo studies with MERS-CoV has found that early induction with type I IFN 210 can be protective in mice 44 ; importantly, the same study found that late type I IFN induction can 211 be detrimental for MERS-CoV disease 44 . Similarly, early reports have described treatments 212 using type I IFN in combination for SARS-CoV-2 infection; yet the efficacy of these treatments 213 and the parameters of their use are not known 45 . Overall, sensitivity data suggest that type I 214 IFN treatment may have utility for treating SARS-CoV-2 if the appropriate parameters can be 215determined. In addition, use of type III IFN, which is predicted to have utility in the respiratory 216 tract, could offer another means for effective treatment for SARS-CoV-2. 217In addition to treatment, the sensitivity to type I IFN may also have implications for 218 animal model development. For SARS-CoV, mouse models that recapitulate human disease 219 were developed through virus passage in immune competent mice 46 . Similarly, mouse models 220 for MERS-CoV required adaptation in mice that had genetic modifications of their dipeptidyl-221 peptidase 4 (DPP4), the receptor for MERS-CoV 47,48 .
