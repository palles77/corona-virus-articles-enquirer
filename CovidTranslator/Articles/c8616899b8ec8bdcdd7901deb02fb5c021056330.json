Appl. Math. 66 (2006) 627-647]. An \"acting basic reproductive number\" \u03c8 is used to predict the final size of the susceptible population. We find the relation among the final susceptible population size S \u221e , the initial susceptible population S 0 , and \u03c8. If \u03c8 > 1, the disease will prevail and the final size of the susceptible, S \u221e , becomes zero; therefore, everyone in the population will be infected eventually. If \u03c8 < 1, the disease dies out, and then S \u221e > 0 which means part of the population will never be infected. Also, when S \u221e > 0, S \u221e is increasing with respect to the initial susceptible population S 0 , and decreasing with respect to the acting basic reproductive number \u03c8.",

The first known cases and the last case of SARS occurred in November 2002 and in July 2003. The international spread of SARS resulted in 8098 SARS cases in 26 countries, with 774 deaths [6] . It is believed that the transmission of SARS can be effectively controlled by adhering to basic public health measures-rapid case detection, case isolation, contact tracing, good infection control (hand-washing and the use of personal protective equipment), and quarantine. Hsu and Hsieh [3] had modeled the SARS outbreak in Taiwan for year 2003 using the general models that include two different levels of quarantines, level A for those who were suspected of having close contact with a suspected SARS case and level B for those who traveled from affected areas after April 28, 2003. Their model equations are as follows: ",
