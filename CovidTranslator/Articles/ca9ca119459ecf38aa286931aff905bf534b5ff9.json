Methods: Patients admitted to medical wards in an acute hospital were recruited prospectively from May 1, 2004 to April 30, 2005. Sputum culture, blood culture, paired serology, and nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPA) viral culture and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) studies were performed. Spirometry was assessed in stable phase at 2e3 months post-hospital discharge. Results: Seventy eight subjects were admitted for AECOPD with concomitant pneumonia. The mean (SD) age was 77.1 (7.5) years, with FEV 1 of 41.5 (20.8)% predicted normal. Overall, an infectious etiology could be established in 48.7% of the subjects. Among the 71 subjects with sputum collected, 40.8% had positive bacterial culture. The commonest bacteria identified were Streptococcus pneumoniae (8[11.3%]), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (7[9.9%]) and Haemophilus influenzae (7[9.9%]). Among the 66 subjects with NPA collected, 9.0 and 12.2% had positive viral culture and PCR results, respectively. The commonest viruses identified by NPA PCR were influenza A (4[6.1%] subjects) and rhinovirus (2[3.0%]). Paired serology was positive in 4.4%. Patients on high dose inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) (>1000 mcg beclomethasone-equivalent/day) had a higher rate of positive sputum bacterial culture than those on low-medium dose of ICS (50.0% vs 18.2%, p Z 0.02). a v a i l a b l e a t w w w . s c i e n c e d i r e c t . c o m j o u r n a l h o m e p a g e : w w w . e l s e v i e r . c o m / l o c a t e / r m e d Respiratory Medicine (2008) 102, 1109e1116",

            "text": "Pneumonia is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. In the US, pneumonia is the 6th most common cause of death and the leading cause of death among all infectious diseases. 1 In Hong Kong, pneumonia and COPD were the 3rd and 5th leading causes of death, with mortality rates of 60 and 28.5 per 100,000 population, respectively. 2 An observational study in the US reported that patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) with a diagnosis of COPD had a significantly higher 30-and 90day mortality than non-COPD patients. 3 Recently, the use of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) is associated with an excess risk of pneumonia hospitalization followed by death within 30 days, among elderly patients with COPD. 4 Most studies on the etiology of CAP did not focus on COPD patients. 5e7 In addition, some studies of the infectious etiology of pneumonia were conducted in the intensive care unit (ICU) setting, and were again not specific for COPD. 8, 9 On the other hand, many studies of the infectious etiology related to AECOPD have excluded patients with pneumonia as they were not considered as ''pure'' AECOPD. 10e13 Our group has previously conducted a retrospective study on the sputum bacteriology of patients with AECOPD with concomitant pneumonia, 14 but the causative role of viruses was not explored. There are currently limited data on the etiological agents in patients with AECOPD and concomitant pneumonia. 15 The aim of this study is to assess prospectively the bacterial and viral etiology of patients hospitalized with AECOPD and concomitant pneumonia. In addition, the associations between the identification of micro-organisms in AECOPD with the use of ICS and clinical outcomes (including mortality and need for non-invasive positive pressure ventilation [NPPV]) were assessed.",

We have observed that the use of higher dose ICS was associated with a higher rate of positive sputum bacterial culture in patients with AECOPD and concomitant pneumonia. Further studies are needed to investigate why COPD patients on ICS appear more prone to pneumonia as reported by recent studies. 4, 26 ",
