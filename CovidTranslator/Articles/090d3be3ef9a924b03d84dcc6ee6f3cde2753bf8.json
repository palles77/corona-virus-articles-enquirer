Wild birds are recognized as the ancestral host of influenza A viruses, and avian viruses have contributed genetic material to most human viruses, including subtypes H5N1 and H1N1. Thus, influenza virus transmission in wild and domestic animals and humans is intimately connected. Here we review how anthropogenic change, including human population growth, land use, climate change, globalization of trade, agricultural intensification, and changes in vaccine technology may alter the evolution and transmission of influenza viruses. Evidence suggests that viral transmission in domestic poultry, spillover to other domestic animals, wild birds and humans, and the potential for subsequent pandemic spread, are all increasing. We highlight four areas in need of research: drivers of viral subtype dynamics; ecological and evolutionary determinants of transmissibility and virulence in birds and humans; the impact of changing land use and climate on hosts, viruses, and transmission; and the impact of influenza viruses on wild bird hosts, including their ability to migrate while shedding virus.",

            "text": "An important trait for the transmission and virulence of influenza viruses is their tissue tropism or infectivity of different tissue types in hosts. In birds, most influenza viruses primarily infect the intestinal, and to a lesser extent, respiratory cells and are thus shed with feces, and respiratory secretions. 8 These viruses are generally thought to cause only mild illness in wild birds. Some strains, however, are able to invade and replicate in other cell types and organs, and as a result, may cause systemic and highly pathogenic infections. The current designation of an influenza virus as high or low pathogenicity is based on the severity of illness in poultry. For example, one index measures the morbidity and mortality of 6-week old specific pathogen free chickens in the ten days following intravenous injection of the virus. 13 Viruses that are highly pathogenic in chickens frequently (but not always; see 14 ) have a characteristic genetic alteration in the gene coding for hemagglutinin (e.g. a polybasic cleavage site in H5N1) compared to similar low pathogenicity forms. 15, 16 Influenza transmission is driven by interactions between the host community, the environment, and co-evolution between the host and pathogen. 17 Anthropogenic environmental changes, including agricultural development, land use, globalization, and climate change have altered the ecology and evolution of influenza viruses and we explore their impact both individually and synergistically. If we can understand the ecology and evolution of influenza viruses in wild and domestic birds, this may enable us to identify the processes that contribute to emergence of the next pandemic human strain. 18, 19 The role of wild birds in influenza ecology Wild birds have been found infected with the majority of the known sub-types of influenza A viruses. 20 Co-infections within individual birds of two viral subtypes enable re-assortment of HA and NA genetic segments and have helped spawn the diversity of human and domestic-animal strains. 17 Waterbirds, including primarily anseriforms (Order Anseriformes, including ducks, geese and swans) and charadriiforms (Order Charadriiformes, including gulls, terns, sandpipers, plovers, etc.), are recognized as the natural reservoirs of influenza A viruses. 8, 17, 21 Low prevalence of infection in passerine bird populations suggests that they are primarily spillover hosts (having been infected through contact with poultry or waterbirds), but some peri-domestic species such as house sparrows (Passer domesticus) may be important in moving viruses between poultry farms.",

There was an early report of an influenza virus causing mortality in wild birds (an H5N3 virus in common terns (Sterna hirundo) in South Africa in 1961 27 ), but few reports in the next forty years. However, since 2002, H5N1 has caused mortality in dozens of birds from several dfferent orders including ducks. [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] In addition, recent evidence suggests that even low pathogenicity influenza viruses can cause illness in mallards and other species. In one study, infected mallards weighed almost 10% less than uninfected birds, and infected juveniles had increased staging times before migration in September. 23 In another study, Bewick's swans (Cygnus columbianus bewickii) infected with a low pathogenicity influenza virus travelled shorter distances and had reduced foraging/refueling rates. 34 One continuing conundrum is that despite clear evidence of H5N1 being present in an area (e.g. the presence of H5N1-infected dead birds), it is rarely detected in living healthy wild birds. 35 This has led some to argue that the role of wild birds in the spread of H5N1 is relatively minor. 36, 37 However, laboratory studies have shown that mallards and other species can remain healthy and shed virus following infection with H5N1. 32, 38 In any case, the very low prevalence of virus in live, healthy birds has created challenges for H5N1 surveillance using these birds, and currently the most effective technique for detecting the presence of H5N1 appears to be monitoring for individual sick or dead birds. 33 At root in this debate is the critical question: Can infected migratory birds fly significant distances while shedding highly pathogenic viruses? A direct experimental study would require a Biological Safety Level 3 laboratory equipped with a wind tunnel, and none of these yet exist. An alternative approach would be to use satellite-telemetry transmitters to track free-living H5N1-infected wild birds and recapture them to demonstrate continued shedding. However, because satellite-telemetry collars are expensive (several thousands of dollars per unit) and the prevalence of highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza in wild birds is frequently very low, even in outbreak areas (e.g. 0.12% 39 ) it would be very costly to ensure that infected birds were included in a sample. One strategy would be to develop rapid field tests for influenza infection (including sub-typing) and use these to identify birds naturally infected with H5N1. These birds could then be fitted with a satellite transmitter. However, it is unclear whether it would be ethical to release birds known to be infected with H5N1 and experimental infections in the field would certainly be considered unethical.",

Sixty-three HA-NA subtypes were found in a sampling of 13,466 North American ducks over 26 years and seventy-one subtypes were found in 4,266 North American shorebirds over 16 years ( Figure 1A ). We used a permutation test and found that the concordance of the presence and absence of HA-NA subtypes among ducks and shorebirds in North America was significantly higher than would be produced from a random distribution of HA and NA types present in each group (p=0.009). Thus, if a subtype occurred in shorebirds in North America, then North American ducks were significantly more likely to carry that subtype, and vice-versa (odds ratio 2.32, 95% CI 1.08-4.94). There is also a weak but significant correlation between the prevalence of influenza viruses on a serotype-by-serotype basis among shorebirds and ducks ( Figure 1B ; Spearman's rho 0.21, p = 0.02). After excluding the serotypes for which the prevalence was zero in either shorebirds or ducks or both, the correlation was marginally non-significant (Spearman's rho 0.28, p = 0.06). In any case, the correlations were strongly influenced by a few points and may not be able to be generalized. In addition, it should be noted that the presence of a viral subtype in either or both groups was highly dynamic and may depend on the presence or absence of other subtypes due to cross immunity. 43 For example, one of the most common subtypes in ducks in the first half of this three-decade study (H6N2) disappeared from the sampled population and was not isolated for the rest of the study while others were only present afterward. 22 The concordance of viral subtypes and prevalence of infection in ducks and shorebirds suggests that several non-exclusive processes involving hosts, viruses, and transmission ecology may be important: 1) host factors: shorebirds and ducks share patterns of susceptibility and resistance to different subtypes, 2) viral factors: viral strain competition within hosts or the environment favors particular HA-NA subtypes that then infect both shorebird and duck populations independently or some HA-NA subtypes result in non-viable viruses, and 4) transmission: there is direct spillover of viruses from shorebirds to ducks and/or vice versa. Genome sequence analysis of viral subtypes that are common among ducks and shorebirds that live in, or transit, the same locations may be the most useful method for determining the extent of local spillover, but to date, few if any such detailed analyses have been performed.",

            "text": "Isolation of highly pathogenic influenza virus subtypes found in ducks from charadriiform birds is generally a rare event. For example, out of 4,623 confirmed highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza events reported from January 2004 through August 2009, approximately 3,048 were reported in domestic chickens, where surveillance is highest, and 588 in wild bird species, with most events being detections of single dead birds. 33 H5N1-infected charadriiforms (shorebirds and gulls) were only reported 7 times (1.2% of wild bird detections). H5N1 has mostly been found in mallards, swans, geese, and other ducks (62% of wild bird detections or 384 events) and other species, including quail, buzzards, falcons, pigeons, guinea fowl, herons, grebes, crows, sparrows and \"unspecified birds\" (39% or 234 events). 44 Although detection and reporting biases clearly exist (e.g. swans are much larger than sandpipers and thus are more likely to be reported to health officials when they are sick or dead), it is less clear whether the low number of H5N1 events involving charadriiform birds is due solely to reporting biases or whether they are inherently less likely to become infected, get sick, or die from this virus. Surveillance at sites along shorebird flyways, including birds traversing from Asia to New Zealand, Australia, or the West Coast of the USA, have found no H5N1 viruses and have documented very low prevalence of other viral subtypes in shorebirds, especially compared to ducks. 21, [45] [46] [47] Although H5N1 avian influenza can eventually be lethal to gulls 50 , the latency and shedding periods in shorebirds are only beginning to be studied. Recent work suggests that herring gulls can shed influenza virus for one to five days prior to the onset of any detectable clinical signs of illness. 52 Because some shorebirds can fly thousands of kilometers in just a few days 51 , the long distance movement of viruses remains possible during the pre-clinical periods. Thus, even if shorebirds have lower prevalence of influenza infection during migration than ducks, the potential global distribution of viruses, and the flow of viral genes, could be affected by shorebird movements. 11, 53 Further research documenting the clinical course of influenza infection in charadriiforms, and their capacity to migrate while infected, are needed.",

For example, large numbers of shorebirds regularly migrate from Europe to South Africa, from SE Asia to Australia, and from eastern Siberia to the lower 48 states of the USA. In contrast, many fewer anseriforms, or none at all, make these movements. 30, 48 Phylogenetic analyses of viruses isolated from shorebirds in different continents could be useful in detecting evidence of these movements. 49 In addition, contact and aggregation patterns among charadriiforms, ducks, and domestic poultry are poorly studied despite their importance for viral spillover.

            "text": "Wetlands provide critical habitat for wild waterfowl as well as ecosystem services such as sediment trapping, ground water purification, and water velocity reduction during floods. Yet, over the last several centuries, a third of all wetlands have been dammed, drained, and used for development, agriculture, golf courses, and domestic water use. [54] [55] [56] Some studies also suggest that wetland habitats are disappearing as temperatures climb due to decreased inflow and increased evaporation as glaciers and snow-packs shrink. 57 Wetland loss has been highly heterogeneous such that some areas, such as California, have lost over 90% of their wetlands, while other less accessible areas, such as Alaska, have lost less than 5%. 58 Land use change, coupled with global climate change and increased demand for freshwater by humans, is expected to significantly decrease the global availability of natural wetland habitat for wild waterfowl in the future. 55 Loss of wetlands has had variable effects on wild waterfowl populations. Some duck species, such as northern pintails and in North America, have suffered population declines in the last several decades linked to habitat loss. 59, 60 Other waterfowl, including some species of geese and swans, have adapted to human-altered landscapes and have experienced spectacular population increases over the last few decades. Their increases are likely in part due to food subsidies provided by nitrogen and calcium rich croplands that are important in reproduction. 61, 62 In many countries there has also been a significant shift towards agricultural intensification. An example of this is the decrease in the agricultural practice of \"summerfallow,\" where land was traditionally tilled but left un-cropped for one year to allow for moisture accumulation, nitrogen release, and weed-control benefits. The shift toward continuous cropping is one of the most economically and environmentally significant land use changes in Canadian prairies in recent decades. 63 Waterfowl nests, including those of northern pintails (Anas acuta), in agricultural land are often destroyed by the modern practice of continuous cultivation. 59 The consequences of these changes in land use and wild waterfowl populations for avian influenza ecology are only beginning to be explored. Land use change that leads to higher waterfowl densities, stress, or proximity to domestic birds, will likely lead to increased influenza transmission within flocks and increased cross-species transmission. For example, in Thailand irrigation has enabled year-round or \"second harvest\" rice cropping that supports higher densities of domesticated free-grazing duck populations that rely on postharvest rice fields for feed. 64 In these areas, highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 outbreaks in domestic poultry are frequent, suggesting a possible causal link. 65 A complicating issue is that decreasing wetlands may have a dynamic effect on influenza transmission. Initially, aggregations of waterfowl may be increased due to crowding at breeding, wintering, and stopover areas, which may also lead to increased contact rates between wild and domestic birds. In the longer term, waterbird populations dependent on wetlands are likely to decrease, most likely with a shift to more human-commensal species (e.g. Canada geese, Branta canadensis). The critical question is whether the species that remain are effective amplification hosts for influenza viruses. 66 At present, the consequences of longer term ecological changes on influenza transmission are not well known, and will be dependent on the interactions among hosts, viruses, and the environment, including climate change.",

For some species, climate change may lead to range shifts [69] [70] [71] , while for some high arctic breeders, climate change may lead to an almost complete loss of habitat. 72 For all species, substantial uncertainty exists because there will likely be interactions between climate and other factors, such as land use change, that influence overall abundance patterns.",

Some long distance migrant birds show earlier spring migration 73 , whereas others do not. 74 Climate-associated changes in the distribution, composition, and migratory behavior of wild bird hosts may cause important changes in avian influenza epidemiology. However, geographically-specific directional predictions will require a knowledge of the behavioral (e.g. contact) patterns of species, as well as their susceptibility and infectiousness for influenza viruses, which are at present largely unknown. 75 In addition to impacts on avian hosts, climate change may have important impacts on the epidemiology of avian influenza through viral survival in the environment. Influenza virus survival decreased in the laboratory with increased water temperature, more acidic conditions (lower pH), and higher salinities. 26, 76 All of these changes are expected to occur in most freshwater ecosystems with future climate warming scenarios 55 , which may decrease the survival of influenza viruses in the aquatic reservoir and thereby decrease transmission. Predicting net impacts of climate change will require models and empirical investigation of how decreased viral survival in the aquatic reservoir might interact with other factors determining influenza transmission, such as smaller, shallower wetlands and increased crowding, stress, and contact rates among migratory species and between wild and domestic birds.",

Live animal markets have a long history in Asian and other cultures, partly because of a lack of refrigeration that make purchasing a whole live animal the only way to assure poultry product freshness. Live bird markets have been implicated in a number of avian influenza outbreaks and in facilitating enzootic influenza virus transmission worldwide, 81 including H5N1 in Hong Kong 28 and in other parts of Asia. 84 Markets can also be hotspots for viral evolution because they bring together different species of animals from different geographical areas into an unsanitary environment and this can facilitate reassortment between viruses. 85 Research on viruses circulating in live bird markets has helped us learn about the processes of viral evolution and transmission. 39, 86, 87 For example, domestic and wild bird surveillance and phylogenetic reconstruction resulted in the identification of H5N1 as a pandemic threat as early as 2002, when its distribution was limited to China, and only a few humans had been infected. 88 Actions taken to prevent transmission of this and other influenza viruses in markets included separation of different types of poultry in markets and a \"day of rest,\" to allow for cleaning of cages and elimination of viruses and other pathogens. 89, 90 Unfortunately, preventative measures were unsuccessful in entirely stamping out the H5N1 virus, and it re-emerged in 2003 and spread throughout Asia, Europe, and Africa over the next four years (Figure 3 ). 30 The emergence of H5N1 has led to four questions being asked of new avian influenza virus isolates acquired during market surveillance: What are the virus' effects upon different hosts (i.e. how pathogenic is it)? Can it infect humans? How transmissible is it between birds and between humans? And, is it resistant to anti-viral drugs? Tools to answer these questions cheaply and quickly are being developed, and should enable scientists and public health workers to take a more active role in preventing the emergence of influenza viruses in the future.",

Due to the large numbers of birds involved, poultry trade can enable viruses to spread rapidly, as occurred in the H7N2 virus outbreaks in Pennsylvania in 1996-1998. 91 Trade in poultry from and between developing countries may carry a larger risk, per chicken, of viral spread, due to infrequent testing or quarantine, and less regulated trade. In addition, government practices of reimbursing only a fraction of the market value of birds to farmers during culling of infected and/or sick animals sometimes encourages rapid and often illegal selling of birds before they die or are seized and culled.

Illegally traded animals bypass any testing and quarantine requirements that may be in place, and thus are a significant threat. 94 Indeed, on two separate occasions, illegally traded wildlife with active H5N1 infections entered Europe; however, they were intercepted before mixing with and potentially spreading the virus to local birds. 30 Actions to reduce the spread of avian influenza and other pathogens are beginning to be enacted across the spectrum of poultry production. Live animal markets, which are known to be high risk areas for the transmission and spread of influenza viruses and other pathogens, are being increasingly regulated, or closed altogether. 84 International trade of live poultry has also been increasingly regulated or banned from some countries. 95 Evidence of the success of these measures exists in Vietnam, where ornamental bird sales have been regulated, and this has led to a significant decline in the number of markets trading these species. 96 One final measure that has received substantial attention for controlling H5N1 in poultry flocks is vaccination.",

            "text": "Two primary strategies exist for influenza control: vaccination and depopulation. The second is clearly costly but is frequently the method of choice when epidemics of highly pathogenic influenza occur within poultry houses. 97 Vaccination, on the other hand, is often undertaken as a preventative measure, although it has also been shown to be effective during an outbreak of H5N1. 98 Most vaccines reduce both susceptibility and infectiousness, and thus have dual benefits. Several countries including China, Vietnam, Pakistan, Indonesia, Thailand and Egypt have or are currently executing costly vaccination programs for live birds because of fears that H5N1 viruses have become enzootic in Southeast Asia. 5, 39 Two key challenges for influenza virus control using vaccines are: 1) high costs associated with current vaccine production techniques that require culturing virus in embryonated chicken eggs, and 2) maintaining an effective vaccine against a fast-mutating virus. Innovative techniques, including reverse genetics and chimeric constructs, are being developed to produce cheaper vaccines more rapidly, as well as vaccines against multiple pathogens, such as influenza and Newcastle disease. 99 One important issue with vaccination is that it may promote enzootic transmission and spread by masking the presence of highly pathogenic viruses such as H5N1. These viruses would normally be detected by higher than normal mortality during production or shipment of poultry, but not in vaccine-protected poultry which sometimes still shed virus. 100 In some cases, the use of non-sterilizing vaccines may also facilitate evolution of increased virulence. 101 Overall, vaccination is a useful tool in influenza control, but costs are substantial, especially given the short lifespan of the commercial birds, and it brings with it the additional risks of enabling silent transmission and encouraging evolution of the virus. In humans, by contrast, vaccination is one of the primary influenza control measures, and the global spread of H1N1 influenza has highlighted the need for rapid production effective vaccines against novel strains.",

The number of early cases of H1N1 influenza in each country fit well with the volume of airline travel arriving from Mexico, providing both a link and perhaps a predictive tool for future spread of novel viruses. 6, 104 Air travel has not only increased global connectivity among humans, but it has done the same for livestock, including poultry, and their associated viruses. The viral strain involved in the most recent H1N1 influenza pandemic is a triple-reassortant, with gene segments from humans, birds, and swine. 105 It is well known that swine are particularly good mixing vessels for influenza viruses because they have cellular receptors in their respiratory tract that both avian and human influenza viruses can bind to. 81, 106, 107 Although it is impossible to determine where or in which hosts the mixing of viruses occurred because the virus has been evolving separately from its closest known relative for approximately ten years, abundant evidence exists of intercontinental trade in poultry and swine, and this trade could have facilitated strain mixing and reassortment. 30, 104 The greatest future threat to human health from an influenza virus comes from a virus to which there is no pre-existing immunity in the human population, one which has the transmissibility of seasonal flu and the virulence of some H5N1 viruses which can have a case-fatality rate greater than 50%. 108 The estimated economic impact of an introduction of a virus with these characteristics in the United States is between $71.3 and $166.5 billion, not including disruptions to commerce and society. 109",

At least as important, and much more poorly known, are the ecological factors (especially anthropogenic changes currently underway) that influence viral evolution in wild birds. Finally, a key unanswered question is: to what extent does selection for virulence and transmissibility in avian hosts impact the likelihood of a pandemic strain emerging in humans? 110 For example, what traits have enabled the H5N1 virus to have such an extraordinarily broad host range that it can infect poultry, nearly all wild birds studied, and several orders of mammals, including humans? 18 All of these questions will require understanding the importance of genetic drift, reassortment, and coinfection in \"mixing vessels\" (animals which can be infected with avian and human strains such as swine) in influenza evolution. 81, 106, 107",
