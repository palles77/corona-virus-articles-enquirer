Viral 3Cpro and 3CLpro are cysteine proteases and share a typical chymotrypsin-like folding, a nucleophilic cysteine residue in the active site, and a preference for a glutamine or glutamic acid residue in the primary binding residue (P1 site) of the substrate proteins. 12 The 3Cpro or 3CLpro of these viruses are appealing targets for the discovery of antiviral therapeutics, and the conservation of the proteases may provide an excellent platform for broad-spectrum antivirals for those important viruses. 12 We report herein our design, synthesis, and bio-evaluation of a class of broad-spectrum anti-viral tripeptidyl inhibitors as depicted in Figure 1 . incorporating a recognition element such as a peptidyl fragment that is compatible with the known substrate specificity of the targeted enzymes and a warhead such as an aldehyde, \uf061ketoamide, bisulfite adduct, 13, 14 or an \uf061-hydroxy phosphonate transition state mimic. Since the primary substrate specificity residue of 3Cpro and 3CLpro is a glutamine residue, a glutamine surrogate 15, 16 was therefore utilized in the P1 site of the inhibitors. Like others, 17, 18 we found that a hydrophobic amino acid such as leucine residue at the P2 site enhances the recognition.",

These inhibitors could be further developed as broad-spectrum antivirals against these important viruses.",
