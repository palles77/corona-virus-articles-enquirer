            "text": "Background: Little information is available regarding eosinophil activation and cytokine profiles in relation to age in virus-induced bronchial asthma. We therefore explored the association between age, respiratory viruses, serum eosinophil cationic protein (ECP), and cytokines/chemokines in acute exacerbations of childhood asthma. Methods: We investigated viruses in nasal secretions from 88 patients with acute exacerbation of childhood asthma by using antigen detection kits and/or RT-PCR, followed by direct DNA sequencing analysis. We also measured peripheral eosinophil counts, and the serum levels of ECP and 27 types of cytokines/chemokines in 71 virus-induced acute asthma cases and 13 controls. Results: Viruses were detected in 71(80.7%) of the 88 samples. The three major viruses detected were rhinoviruses, RS viruses, and enteroviruses; enteroviruses were found to be dominant in patients aged !3 years. There was no change in the levels of rhinoviruses and RS viruses between the two age groups, defined as children aged <3 years and children aged !3 years. Serum concentrations of ECP, IL-5, and IP-10 were significantly elevated in virus-induced acute asthma cases compared with controls. Serum ECP values were significantly higher in patients with virus-induced asthma at age !3 years compared with those aged <3 years. Among the 27 cytokines/chemokines, serum IP-10 was significantly higher in virusinduced asthma in patients <3 years than in those !3 years. Serum ECP and IL-5 production correlated significantly with age, whereas serum IP-10 showed an inverse correlation with age. Conclusions: Age-related differences in cytokine profiles and eosinophil activation may be related to virus-induced acute exacerbations of childhood asthma.",

            "text": "Viral infection induces both the development and exacerbation of bronchial asthma. 1, 2 Accumulating evidence suggests that rhinovirus infection is a major cause of acute exacerbations of asthma in both adults 3 and children. 4 Kotaniemi-Syrj\u20ac anen et al. showed that the most significant risk factor for the development of preschool childhood wheezing is the occurrence of symptomatic rhinovirus illness during infancy. 5 The COAST (Childhood Origins of Asthma) study group also reported that wheezing attacks during childhood (2e16 years of age) can be linked to rhinovirus infection with atopy or eosinophilic airway inflammation. 6, 7 Respiratory syncytial (RS) virus is another leading cause of serious lower respiratory tract infection in infants. RS virus infection exacerbates recurrent wheezing attacks in patients with established asthma. 8 A number of caseecontrol studies have established at least a statistical correlation between RS virus infection in infancy and the development of recurrent wheezing and asthma in young children (9e14 years old). However, RS virus infection appears unlikely to be a cause of atopic asthma later in life. 9e14 Heymann et al. found that patients of age <3 years with wheezing and positive tests for viruses showed a higher presence of RS virus compared with other viruses. In contrast, rhinovirus was dominant in children aged 3e18 years, suggesting that viral respiratory tract pathogens might differ at different ages in asthmatic children with acute exacerbation. 15 The purpose of this study was to investigate changes among the viruses detected, peripheral eosinophil counts, serum levels of eosinophil cationic protein (ECP), and several cytokines and chemokines in relation to age in cases of virus-induced acute exacerbation of childhood asthma.",

All patients had a history of three or more different episodes of recurrent wheezing and documented evidence of wheezing by auscultation. Subjects with asthma were diagnosed according to the criteria of the Japanese guidelines. 16 Briefly, a diagnosis of asthma was confirmed on the basis of a history of recurrent wheezing and dyspnea on at least three independent occasions, and reversible bronchoconstriction. 16 Patients were prescribed short-acting b agonists and/or long-term controller medications. We excluded children with obvious bacterial infections, congenital heart diseases, and chronic lung diseases as well as those who showed the presence of a foreign body, had signs of severe infection, or were immunosuppressed, as these complications can interfere with the assessment of asthma-related outcome measures. The control group included 13 healthy children (8 boys, 5 girls, mean/median age 3.7/4.2 years) with no symptoms of wheezing at the time of examination. Exclusion criteria for the controls included immunosuppression, the presence of other respiratory tract symptoms, or a history of previous wheezing and asthma. Controls and patient cases were age-and sex-matched. This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Gunma Children's Medical Center. Informed consent was obtained from parents of patients and assent was obtained from the children if they were considered old enough (generally >9-year-old).",

Comparison between peripheral eosinophils counts, serum ECP, and cytokines/chemokines in virus-induced acute exacerbations of asthma between patients aged <3-yearold and those aged !3 years, as well as controls. ECP serum values were significantly higher in virus-induced asthma in patients aged !3 years than in those aged <3 years. Among the 27 cytokines/chemokines, serum IP-10 was significantly higher in virus-induced asthma in patients aged <3 years than in those aged !3 years. The median is represented by horizontal bars.

However, previous report showed IP-10 has been shown to be induced in bronchial epithelial cells infected by rhinovirus-16, with a close link to rhinovirus replication and through a mechanism that is not dependent on prior induction by either IFN-g or the type I IFNs such as IFN-a and IFN-b. Further, IP-10 release might be triggered via double-stranded viral RNA reacting with Toll-like receptor 3, leading to the translocation of nuclear factor kB to the nucleus. 26 Wark et al. showed that serum IP-10 levels in virus-induced acute asthma subjects aged 16e74 years are increased compared with non-virus-induced acute asthma cases, specifically rhinovirus infection. 27 Our recent study also suggests that serum IP-10 is a novel marker of rhinovirus-and RS virusinduced acute asthma exacerbations. 17 Another report showed that the levels of plasma IP-10 during acute RS virus infection in infants are elevated compared with the convalescence period and controls. 28 Although the present study could not specify which factor such as asthma, attack, or viral infection is most important on the IP-10 production, previous reports 17, 27 found that serum IP-10 was elevated by viral-induced acute exacerbations of asthma compared with stable asthma as well as acute non-virus-induced asthma. Further, serum IP-10 increased at exacerbations of patients with COPD by rhinovirus infection. 29 These observations collectively suggest that IP-10 is a biomarker of virus infection.",
