IS/ mutants with a i bp insertion, which encode mutant transposases with an amino acid substitution within the polypeptide segment at residues 84-87, did not efficiently mediate cointegration, except for an IS 1 mutant which encodes a mutant transposase with a Leu-Arg-Lys-Leu segment instead of Leu-Lys-Lys-Leu. An IS 1 mutant with the DNA segment 5'-CTTAAAAACTC-3' at positions 305-315 carrying the termination codon TAA in the B'-insB reading frame could still mediate cointegration, indicating that codon AAA for Lys corresponding to second, third and fourth positions in the run of adenines is the site of frameshifting. The fi-galactosidase activity specified by several IS 1 -lacZ fusion plasmids, in which B'-insB is in-frame with lacZ, showed that the region 292-377 is sufficient for frameshifting. The protein produced by frameshifting from the IS 1-lacZ plasmid in fact contained the polypeptide segment Leu-Lys -Lys -Leu encoded by the DNA segment 5'-TTAAAAAACTC-3', indicating that -1 frameshifting does occur within the run of adenines.",

            "text": "Insertion sequence IS 1 is the smallest active IS element in bacteria (Ohtsubo and Ohtsub 0 1978; Johnsrud 1979) and is involved in various kinds of genomic rearrangements, including the cointegration event between two Correspondence to: E. Ohtsubo replicons (Iida and Arber 1980; Ohtsubo et al. 1980 Ohtsubo et al. , 1981 . IS/ encodes two out-of-phase reading frames, insA and B'-insB, where B' is an open reading frame extending in-frame from the initiation codon ATG of the insB frame for 126 bp. The B' reading frame, which overlaps the 3' end of the insA frame, is in the -1 frame with respect to insA. Previous genetic analyses indicated that a frame shifting event occurs in the -1 direction within a run of six adenines, which lies in the overlap region between insA and B', to fuse insA and B'-insB by translation, producing the InsA-B'-InsB fusion protein that has IS 1 transposase activity (Sekine and Ohtsubo 1989) . The InsA protein, which is produced unless the frameshifting event occurs, may play a role as a negative regulator of transposition (Machida and Machida 1989; Sekine and Ohtsubo 1989; Zerbib etal. 1990 ). Since the efficiency of frameshifting determines the ratio between the amount of InsA and that of transposase, frameshifting is thought to be a mechanism which controls transposition of IS 1 (Sekine and Ohtsubo 1989; Escoubas et al. 1991) . The production of transposase encoded by other IS elements, such as IS3 and perhaps those related to IS 3, has been suggested to depend on -1 frameshifting within a run of adenines in these elements (Sekine and Ohtsubo 1991) . Recently, frameshifting in IS i50 which is related to IS3, has been demonstrated (V6gele et al. 1991) .",

Cointegration frequencies mediated by IS 1-31, IS/-32 or IS 1-33 were taken from Sekine and Ohtsubo (1989) higher frequency than does either wild-type IS 1 or any of the other mutants with a 1 bp insertion neighboring the run of adenines (see IS1-32 and IS1-33 in Fig. 1 ) (Sekine and Ohtsubo 1989) . The mutant IS1-31 is considered to produce, without frameshifting, active transposase in which the amino acid sequence at residues 84-87 is Leu--Lys-Lys-Leu (LKKL in Fig. 1 ), but the other mutants produce inactive transposase with FKKL or LKNL (see Fig. 1 ). These results have suggested that wild-type IS 1 produces transposase having the polypeptide segment LKKL by -1 frameshifting in the run of six adenines. To support this suggestion, we constructed four other mutants with a 1 bp insertion designed to alter the amino acid sequence in the possible IS i transposase. We then examined cointegration between each of these mutant plasmids as donor and pHSI, a temperature-sensitive replication mutant of a tetracycline-resistance plasmid pSC101 as recipient, by selecting for cells harboring cointegrates which can replicate in the presence of tetracycline at 42 \u00b0 C. Three mutants, IS 1-35, IS \u2022-36 and IS 1-38 (Fig. 1) , which generate Sekine and Ohtsubo (1989) . See the legend to Fig. 1 for further details transposases with LEKL, LQKL and LKKV polypeptide segments, respectively, instead of LKKL, did not efficiently mediate cointegration. Conversely, one mutant (IS1-37 in Fig. 1 ) which generates a transposase with an LRKL segment, with a related amino acid substitution R (Arg) for K (Lys) at the 85th residue, mediated cointegration at an even higher frequency than that of IS1-31 (Fig. 1) . This supports the suggestion above that IS1 transposase with the polypeptide segment LKKL at residues 84-87 is the product of frame-shifting and used to mediate cointegration in wild-type IS 1.",

To determine which is the case, we constructed an IS I mutant, IS1-81, with two substitutions, C for nucleotide T at 305 and T for nucleotide A at 307, which not only convert codon 3\u00b0STTA for 84L in insA to the synonymous codon CTT, but also convert codon 3\u00b0TAAA for the first K in B'-insB to the ochre codon TAA (Fig. 2) . This IS 1 mutant retained the ability to mediate cointegration (Fig. 2) . This indicates that the mutant produces active transpo-sase upon frameshifting, using the 3\u00b0SAAA codon for SSK as the last codon in insA at which -1 frameshifting occurs during translation to give rise to transposase. The other two IS 1 mutants were constructed as negative controls: IS/-62 with a substitution of A for T at position 306, which introduces an ochre codon in insA at a position upstream of the run of adenines, and IS/-24 with a T for C substitution at position 322 which introduces an amber codon in B'-insB downstream of the run of adenines. These mediated cointegration at greatly reduced frequencies (Fig. 2) as expected, since both of the termination codons introduced resulted in production of a truncated protein and, therefore, inactive transposase.",

We also constructed IS i-lacZ fusion plasmids having a DNA fragment of IS ! with a single adenine insertion in the run of adenines, so that insA is fused with B'-insB-lacZ in-frame. The ratio of LacZ activity specified by the out-of-frame plasmid to that specified by the corresponding in-frame plasmid is considered to reflect the efficiency of frameshifting in the out-of-frame plasmid.",

On the other hand, LacZ activity specified by pSEK2055-I, a derivative of pSEK2055 with a single adenine insertion in the run of adenines, was 811 units (Fig. 3) . Thus, the efficiency of frameshifting in pSEK2055 was estimated to be 0.21% (Fig. 3) . LacZ activity specified by plasmid pSEK9000 having the region 292-377 was 17.9 units, while the LacZ activity specified by the corresponding in-frame plasmid pSEK9000-I was 5220 units (Fig. 3) . The efficiency of frameshifting in pSEK9000 was thus estimated to be 0..34% (Fig. 3) , which was alsmost the same level as that in pSEK2055. This suggests that the region 63-291, which is upstream of the run of adenines, is not required for frameshifting.

(1991) . The degree of the reduction, however, seemed not to be so great, and the efficiency in pSEK6000 is the same as that in pSEK2055. Moreover, the efficiency in pSEK6100 hav-ing the region 292-332 was the same as that in pSEK2055 and pSEK6000 (data not shown). In the two plasmids, pSEK6000 and pSEK6100, several possible secondary structures seen in the region downstream of the run of adenines (Sekine and Ohtsubo 1992) are deleted. These show that the region 333 377 is not essential for frameshifting, suggesting that the contribution of the secondary structures downstream of the run of adenines to the efficiency of frameshifting is small (Sekine and Ohtsubo 1992) . Note here that the efficiency of frameshifting in pSEK207 having the region 63-314 was, however, 0.047% (Fig. 3) , a 4.5-fold decrease compared with that in pSEK2055. This suggests that the region 315-377, which is located downstream of the run of adenines, is required to stimulate frameshifting. The reduction of efficiency of frameshifting seen in pSEK207 was considered to be caused mainly by the elimination of the termination codon of insA, but not by the elimination of secondary structures, as described above and by Sekine and Ohtsubo (1992) .",

In this plasmid, the codon for Leu at the 84th residue in IS 1 transposase becomes the 8th codon in the coding region for the LacZ fusion protein, where the ATG of cro is the first codon (see Fig. 4A ). The LacZ fusion protein, which was overproduced by heat induction in cells harboring pSEK9000, was readily purified using a LacZ-specific affinity column (see Materials and methods). The purified protein was subjected to 21 cycles of Edman degradation (Fig. 4A) , and the relevant phenylthiohydantoin (PTH)-amino acids detected in the first 13 cycles are shown in Fig. 4B (a). This shows that translation of the LacZ fusion protein was initiated at the ATGcro and continued in-frame along insA, but shifted into B'-insB-lacZ. The amino acid sequence detected at cycles 8-11, which was produced from the sequence 5'-TTAAAAAACTC-Y, was LKKL ( Fig. 4B, a) , as expected from the results obtained from genetic analyses described above.",

In MMTV, -1 frameshifting occurs at the gag-pro overlap, with the sequence AAAAAAC identical to that of IS 1, to produce the transframe protein, such that the last codon in gag (0 frame) is codon AAC (Hizi et al. 1987) and is downstream by one codon when compared with the site in IS 1. This difference between IS 1 and MMTV and probably other retroviruses which are thought to use the AAAAAAC sequence for frameshifting (Rice etal. 1985; Shimotohno et al. 1985) might be due to the structural or functional differences between prokaryotic and eukaryotic molecules participating in the translational process. The run of six adenines in dnaX and IS150 is followed by a guanine residue instead of a cytosine residue, unlike IS1 and MMTV. In dnaX, the amino acid sequence of the protein produced by frameshifting from the DNA segment 5'-GCAAAAAAGAG-3' is-AKKE (Tsuchihashi and Kornberg 1990) , indicating that frameshifting occurs at one of the consecutive codons, AAA and AAG, for lysine (K) in the 0-frame. In IS 150, the amino acid sequence of the protein produced by frameshifting from the DNA segment 5'-CUAAAAAAGCU-3' was LKKA (V6gele et al. 1991) , indicating that frameshifting occurs at either codon CUA for leucine (L) or one of the consecutive codons, AAA and AAG, for lysine (K) in the 0-frame. Since the exact site for frameshifting is not clear in dnaX or IS I50, it is unknown at present whether the site of frameshifting in these genetic systems is the same as that in IS 1 or not.",

We have shown here that the efficiency of frameshifting in IS i is 0.2-0.3%. This is very low when compared with other cases, for example, 5-25% in retroviruses (for a review, see Varmus and Brown 1989) , 40 50% in dnaX (Flower and McHenry 1990; Tsuchihashi and Kornberg 1990) , and 30% in IS150 (V6gele et al. 1991) . The lack of the secondary structures which stimulate frameshifting might result in such a low efficiency of frameshifting in IS 1. It is reasonable to assume that IS 1 adopts a low level of frameshifting, which results in a low level production of transposase, to avoid deleterious rearrangement of .the host chromosome containing IS 1.",

IS 1 (with coordinates 1-768; Ohtsubo and Ohtsubo 1978) has two overlapping open reading frames, insA and B'-insB, shown by two arrows within IS1 at the top. Each plasmid carries a DNA fragment of IS 1 containing a part of the insA and B'-insB frames, each of which is in-frame with ATGc,o and lacZ, respectively. pSEK2055-I, etc. are the plasmids carrying a DNA fragment with a single adenine insertion in the run of adenines which results in fusion between the two frames to give in-frame expression of lacZ. Nucleotide positions of the ends of each IS i fragment are Filled portions indicate a frame(s) required to give the InsA-B'-InsB-LacZ fusion protein. Production of the fusion protein is controlled at promoter PR by a thermosensitive repressor, the product of ci857. Broken lines show regions of IS 1 deleted in each plasmid. The LacZ activity in the lysate of the cells harboring each plasmid was assayed at least three times; standard errors were less than 15%. Efficiency of frameshifting (%) was obtained by calculating the ratio of LacZ activity specified by the out-offrame plasmid to that specified by the corresponding in-frame plasmid TTTCCGCCATT T AAAAAACT\u2022AGG\u2022\u2022GCAGTCGGTAA\u2022\u2022T\u2022G\u2022G\u2022ATA\u2022AGC\u2022GGGCAGTGA\u2022GT\u2022AT\u2022GT\u2022TG\u2022G\u2022GGAAAT`hI(3AT\u2022\u2022T..
