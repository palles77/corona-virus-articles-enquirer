The basis of the assay is the cleavage of target RNA by RNase H mediated by sequence-specific chimeric oligonucleotides followed by sample to residual ratio quantitation (SRRQ) using RRT-PCR. Four serotype-specific chimeric oligonucleotides were designed, one each for the Massachusetts, Connecticut, Arkansas, and Delaware/Georgia 98 serotypes, and tested for their ability to mediate specific cleavage of target RNA from known homologous and heterologous strains of IBV. Specific cleavage of target RNAs by each chimeric oligonucleotide was verified using agarose gel analysis and RRT-PCR. There were no non-specific cleavage products. Eight different IBV strains representing seven serotypes were tested and each chimeric oligonucleotide mediated cleavage of target RNA only from strains within the serotype that the chimeric was designed against. The SRRQ assay was evaluated on 15 samples without prior knowledge of their grouping and correctly identified the serotype of each sample. The assay is rapid; six samples can be tested in approximately 4 h. In addition, the primer set amplifies all IBV RNAs tested to date and provides a built in control for detecting IBV whether it is typeable or not.",

The vaccination strategy is dependent upon the serotype of IBV prevalent within a geographical area because different serotypes do not cross-protect.

Due to their ease and correlation with serotype, genotype tests (dot blots, DNA probes, DNA sequencing, serotype-specific RT-PCR, and RT-PCR/RFLP) have become widely used. Although the genotyping tests are rapid, room for improvement remains. In particular, elimination of post RT-PCR manipulations (gel electrophoresis, gel purification of DNA, restriction enzyme analysis, sequencing, etc.) would decrease the cost and overall assay time. Recent technological advances in the field of real-time nucleic acid amplification could be used to negate the need for post RT-PCR manipulations.",

Briefly, a sample of RNA is amplified by RT-PCR and aliquots are taken from the reaction every 5-10 cycles and separated on an agarose gel. The second aliquot showing the presence of a clear band of the proper size is then used as the number of total PCR cycles for the appropriate sample during the assay. Once the number of PCR cycles is determined for a particular sample, the chimeric oligonucleotide cleavage reaction is run as stated, RNA is extracted, and used as template in an RT-PCR using the number of appropriate PCR cycles determined earlier.",

Due to the quasi-species of IBV and the ease of contamination of vaccine strains during manipulation, a test that can determine the level of purity for a particular sample should be helpful.
