If we were able to find reports listing numbers of confirmed and suspected cases, we used that information. If the epidemiological curve was available online as a graph, which is the case for data obtained from the CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) and Eurosurveillance sites, we estimated numbers from the graph and matched the plot of the estimated data with the online source. This can conveniently be done in Excel by plotting our estimated numbers on a graph with a transparent background and superimposing the resulting plot on a copy of the epidemiological curve posted online.

Confirmed (autochthonous + imported) and suspected cases are included in this analysis. Not all countries provided weekly revisions of the total number of reported cases, leading to groups of consecutive data points with equal value. In the calculation of the outbreak growth rate, we use a time unit of one week. We do not compensate for the fact that the 53 rd week of 2014 has only 4 days; since the data are first smoothed and then interpolated, such a variation leads to a change in the instantaneous growth rate that is comparable to the size of uncertainties due to fluctuations in the number of reported cases, and is therefore negligible.

The latter depends on the nature of the outbreak and is typically a day or a week. In order to smooth the data and interpolate C(t) on a finer grid of mesh size \u03b4t = 1/28 TU, we first remove consecutive repeated values of C(t), keeping only the first occurrence, except for values at the end of the data set, or values equal to zero.

Recent work (8) cautions against estimating epidemiological parameters from cumulative data, since cumulative fluctuations are not independent from one another. Our approach is different. First, G in the expression for E(C 0 , M ) is incidence and its daily fluctuations due to noise in the data can be assumed to be independent. Second, the fit to the cumulative epidemiological curve is only performed along a curve, not on the entire parameter space. 4. The SIR model and the logistic differential equation.

The three panels correspond to training data sets (red stars) of increasing size. The blue circles show reported cumulative cases that were not part of the training data. The solid curve is obtained from a logistic fit and the dashed curve are EpiGro predictions. Figure T2 shows predictions of the two procedures when an increasing fraction of the available data for the 2014-15 chikungunia outbreak in the Dominican Republic is used to train the models. In the left panel (small training data set), the logistic model largely overestimates the final size of the outbreak, while EpiGro (the approach discussed in the present article) underestimates it; short-term predictions are however better captured by a logistic fit. As the size of the training data set increases (middle and right panels), EpiGro's performance is comparable to or better than the logistic fit. Figure T3 shows similar results for the 2009 H1N1 outbreak in Canada. In that case, EpiGro performs better, both for short term predictions and outbreak size, than the logistic fit. In panels 2 and 3, the minimizer found by fminsearch is not a global minimizer, and EpiGro finds a set of parameters that better fits the data. Figure T4 , for the 2014",

            "text": "The above integrals are numerically approximated by left Riemann sums. The curve K is obtained as the location where E(C 0 , M ) changes sign on a discrete lattice of values of C 0 and M , in the vicinity of the default values M def = max(G obs ), C 0,def = max(C obs ). Points on K are identified by following the sign of E(C 0 , M ) along straight lines of different slopes, and E(C 0 , M ) is approximated at those points. Amongst these, the point giving the minimum value of E(C 0 , M ) is selected and used as an initial condition for an iterative procedure that converges to the local minimizer of E(C 0 , M ) in the vicinity of that initial point. Once the minimizer is found, the corresponding values of C 0 and M define the model used to describe the outbreak in terms of the logistic differential equation. The latter is integrated by hand exactly. In situations where G is piecewise quadratic, we use a numerical solution, obtained with the MATLAB ode45 routine. The initial condition is chosen as the first integer value after the point in the smoothed interpolated data where C obs (t) first exceeds C 0 /10.",

            "text": "Comparison with least square logistic fit of cumulative epidemiological curve. As explained in Section 3, the two parameters of the model are chosen by a least-square minimization of the error E(C 0 , M ), along the curve K. Because this minimization is restrained to K and performed using interpolated data, the outcome is typically different from the two parameters that would be obtained by a least-square fit of the cumulative epidemiological curve to the solution of the logistic differential equation. In this section, we present a comparison of the two approaches, in order to illustrate the advantages and limitations of the present method. For the logistic fit, the search for the minimizer in the parameter plane is performed with MATLAB's routine fminsearch, which identifies a local (but not necessarily the global) minimum.",
