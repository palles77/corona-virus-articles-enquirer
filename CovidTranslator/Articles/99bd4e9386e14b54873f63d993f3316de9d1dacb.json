For the first time, China's 12th five-year Plan for National and Social Development (2011)(2012)(2013)(2014)(2015) includes \"developing the ocean economy\" as a key national development strategy for the country. Because of this, the demand for ocean economic statistics and indicators is growing rapidly. The aim of this paper is to define and quantify the value of the major ocean industries in China and to examine the growth in the major Chinese ocean industries in the period 2001 to 2010. The paper also outlines a methodology that provides a robust quantification of the marine sector over time. It finds that in 2010 the major ocean industries in China contributed $239.09 billion to the national economy and employed over 9 million individuals.",

In China, the ocean economy is now seen as a critical component of that engine. Following the reform of economic trade policy, especially in the period 2001-2010, China's ocean economy has been growing rapidly, in line with national GDP. Also, as the second largest economy in the world, China is paying more attention to the sustainable development of its ocean economy. One important reason for this is that since joining the World Trade Organization (WTO), Chinese trade with other nations has steadily expanded as a proportion of national economic activity, to the point where it affects approximately 70% of China's economy [2] . China also has access to a significant marine resource base with a coastline of more than 32,000 km [3] and more than 7300 islands [4] in its territorial waters. Coupled with this, China has sovereign jurisdiction over a vast area of continental shelves and exclusive economic zones (EEZs) (as defined by the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea) equal to approximately 3 million km 2 of offshore waters. China also has marine oil reserves of an estimated 24 billion tons and natural gas reserves of over 1.6 billion cubic meters [5] .",

Ocean commerce in 2008 alone represented approximately 10% of China's gross domestic product (GDP), with a value of approximately $456 billion. Moreover, some 85% of its international trade moves by the sea lanes [2] . China's increasing reliance on oil imports to sustain its rapid economic expansion is a key element of this marine commerce. China imported over half of the oil it consumed in 2009, the majority of which was transported by tankers [7] .",

            "text": "Since the productive land resources in China, as well as other countries around the world, are increasingly reaching the limits of economic and ecological exploitation, the value of the oceans as a resource for economic development has become increasingly more prominent. A number of coastal countries have launched programs explicitly aimed at strategic initiatives for the development of their ocean resources [2] . For example, in 2002 the Canadian Department of Fisheries and Oceans launched Canada's Oceans Strategy which provides an overall strategic approach to oceans management in that country [8] . In July 2010, U.S. President Obama signed Executive Order #13547 establishing a National Policy for the Stewardship of the Ocean, Coasts, and the Great Lakes which aims to significantly improve the management of the U.S.'s marine resources [9] . Elsewhere, in 2011, the Irish prime minister launched Ireland's first national integrated marine plan entitled \"Harvesting our Ocean Wealth-An Integrated Marine Plan for Ireland\" [10] . The Plan sets out actions and an implementation model which includes a number of integrated Government delivery mechanisms aimed at supporting an integrated system of policy and program planning for Irish marine affairs. Similar to these other nations, China has also been planning for the strategic development of the oceans as a resource for economic development. In 1996 the Chinese government unveiled the China Ocean Agenda 21 which put forward a sustainable development strategy for China's marine resources. The main aims of this strategy were to effectively safeguard the state's marine rights and interests internationally, provide protection for delicate marine ecosystems and realize the sustainable development of China's ocean economy [11] .",

The US National Ocean Economic Program (NOEP) which compiles marine economic data in the US extracts their ocean economy data based on the NAICS. Similarly, in Europe, the relevant institutes in France, Britain and Ireland collect ocean economic statistics based on the NACE (Classification of Economic Activities of the European Communities) coding system 3 . All government statistics programs in China are compiled on the basis of CCSNEI. Table 2 provides a comparison of definitions and codes for each of the ocean sectors reported in China and America (in the later case reported by the NOEP). In China's case, 12 industries are defined based on the 4-digit codes of CCSNEI, while six ocean industries are defined by the US NOEP based on the 6-digit codes of NAICS. Seven of China's defined ocean industries have corresponding classification in the USA ocean economy accounting system. However the corresponding classification in the US system is often at a higher level of aggregation. For example while the Chinese system has separate categories for offshore oil and gas and offshore mining, in the US system these industries are grouped together under the heading of \"Minerals-Offshore\". The types of activities under the headings of offshore mining, shipbuilding and marine construction is also much broader in the Chinese classification compared to the US one.",

In terms of GVA, coastal tourism is the largest contributor to the overall value of the ocean economy with US$78.33 billion of value added. The marine communications and transportation industry is the next largest category producing US$55.92 billion. When it comes to employment, the marine fishery industry is the biggest contributor, employing 5.53 million individuals, followed by Coastal tourism at 1.24 million and the marine communications and transportation industry at 0.81 million. In China's case, the coastal tourism, the marine communications and transportation industry and the marine fisheries industry dominate the ocean economy. These are categories that have also been found to dominate other ocean economies internationally [19] [20] [21] [22] . It would appear however that the high numbers employed in the fisheries sector relative to the other two dominant sectors is somewhat unique to China's ocean economy.",

            "text": "Since the data sources employed to quantify the ocean economy are also a historical record of the economic activities it is possible to analyze the growth (or otherwise) of the major ocean industries over time. The reduced growth rates in these two years reflect the fact that the major ocean industries are vulnerable to unexpected shocks to the economy. In 2003, the SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) virus broke out in China. SARS was the first severe and readily transmissible new disease to emerge in the 21st century [25] . This hit the Chinese economy heavily, especially the industries involved in international trade. Due to their export-oriented characteristics, the ocean industries were greatly affected. The fall in the growth rate of the ocean economy in 2009 was due to the financial crisis of 2007/2008, which is considered by many economists to be the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression of the 1930s [26] . A massive stimulus package from the Chinese government saw the economy through the worst of the financial crisis but still the growth rates of national GDP went down significantly, especially for the ocean related industries. It would therefore appear that the major ocean industries are more vulnerable to the impact of unexpected events (e.g. the SARS outbreak in 2003 and global recession in 2007) than the general economy. Also any events impacting on international trade have a higher impact on the ocean economy. This is not surprising given, as mentioned in Section 1, that seaborne commerce is an essential part of Chinese trade; alone represented 10% of China's gross domestic product in 2008 [2] . [27] . The tourism sector bounced back strongly in 2004 due in part to a rescue package from the government that included tax rebates, employment and training measures and financial aid. Also domestic and pan-Asian tourism boards put in place action plans to revitalize the stricken sector.",

The value of these sectors decreased by 8.51% and 39%, respectively, in 2009. The marine communication and transportation industry has long been the dominant support of China's international trade and continues to integrate markets between China and other countries. In the decade of 2001-2010, the marine communication and transportation industry had been growing rapidly due to the fast development of China's international trade. The only year that saw a decrease in the rate of growth of this sector was 2009. The offshore oil and gas industry is also a very important component of the ocean economy in China. In 2010, marine oil and gas output exceeded 50 million tons of oil equivalent, which makes China one of the world's major marine oil and gas producers. China's offshore exploration platforms are distributed both on coastal waters and in its deepwater territorial seas which increases the risk of ocean environmental pollution of the coastal area. The sharp drop in the value of the offshore oil and gas industry in 2009 was in line with global trends and was mainly due to the decline in international oil prices caused by the financial crisis. Table 4 provides a comparison of the Chinese ocean economy value (as a percentage of GDP) and employment figures to other ocean economies internationally. Such comparisons, while interesting, can be misleading as the \"marine/ocean\" sector does not formally exist in most national accounts and as pointed out by SEMRU [28] figures made available by national marine agencies are often based on different underlying definitions of the sector and different methods of collection of data and classification of activities into different categories. Indeed, it is worth noting that all of the marine economic reports reviewed in Table 4 recognize the limitations of official statistics-gathering procedures in capturing the importance of marine activities in their national economies.",

In 2010, the value added by ocean based sectors in these two countries are almost at the same level. In the USA it was reported as $266.72 billion while in China it was $239.09 billion. However, the share of the ocean based income in overall GDP is quite different, in China it is 4.03% (and this includes only the 12 major ocean industries classified in Table 1 ) while in the US it is only 1.82% (based on the fact that the national GDP of the USA is almost twice that of China). It would also appear that the indicative employment in China's ocean economy is much larger than that of America. The discrepancy between the shares of employment in the sector and the share of ocean based activity in the countries respective GDP would appear to indicate that labor productivity might be relatively lower in the Chinese ocean economy compared to the US ocean economy. However the real explanation is more likely to be reflected in the fact that in China 553,000 individuals are employed in the labor intensives primary production activity that is the marine fishery industry. In comparison, more persons are employed in higher value added industries in the US ocean economy. While shifting up this value added chain is an important objective for the Chinese ocean economy sector (as can be seen in the government's support for emerging industries such as marine energy, marine bio-medicine and marine technology and the fact that industries using marine high technologies have been growing rapidly at an average annual rate of more than 20% in the last decade), the importance of the primary fisheries jobs to rural China in particular should not be underestimated.",

Data was collected for 12 major ocean industries. Using a similar methodology to that developed in previous international studies, it was found that the major ocean industries produced US$239.09 billion in value added output in 2010 and accounted for 4.03% of China's national GDP. The major ocean industries were found to employ 9,253,000 individuals. This analysis also found that coastal tourism, marine communication and transportation industry and the marine fishing industry dominate in China's ocean economy. A time series analysis for the period 2001 to 2010 found that the Chinese ocean economy follows a very similar growth path to that of the national economy. It would appear from the analysis however that given the international nature of the activities in the ocean economy, the major ocean industries demonstrate a higher level of vulnerability in terms of the impact of unexpected shocks to the economy.",

As Colgan [24] points out \"knowledge of the marine economy is very imprecise because little has been invested in developing the needed data, especially in comparison with the investment in the understanding of other natural resources\". The adoption of the \"Developing the Ocean Economy\" strategy and the establishment of five ocean economy pilot test sites by the Chinese government were in recognition of the importance of marine activity to the economy in China. This increased focus on the ocean economy means policy-makers require accessible and reliable information regarding the role of the ocean industries in the wider economy [2] . With the implementation of the ocean-related plans, the goal of \"developing the ocean economy\" is occurring at a rapid pace. This rapid development however requires detailed information on the marine activities that policy makers can use to ensure that the development is sustainable and does not jeopardize other marine policy goals especially in relation to the marine environment and the conservation of marine species.",

Indeed it could be argued that the establishment of container terminals in all provinces has not been an efficient use of valuable coastal resources in China.

In this decade of rapid development for all the major ocean industries, 2003 and 2007 are worthy of note.

Coastal tourism was the largest contributor to China's ocean economy from 2006 to 2010. Coastal tourism includes hotels and lodging places, coastal tourism services, amusements and recreation, and coastal tourism and cultural services. The coastal tourism sector had been achieving growth rates of over 20% almost every year throughout the decade, greatly boosting the development of China's marine economy. For China's coastal tourism, 2003 was a significant year due to the outbreak of the SARS virus. Total tourism output had decreased dramatically in the first half of the year, and in the whole of 2003, the added value created by coastal tourism was $13.37 billion, down 27.39% compared to 2002. By the time that the World Health Organization lifted its two-month advisory warning against nonessential travel to China in late June 2003 the outbreak had cost China's travel and tourism industry sectors an estimated US$20.4 billion",

The Chinese marine communications and transportation industry can be divided into five categories; marine passenger transportation, marine cargo transportation, sea ports, submarine pipeline transportation, and marine transportation service. With the center of world trade shifting to Asia and rapid growth of the China's economy, marine shipping has become the main mode of transport in terms of international trade with China.Fig. 5 provides the volume of cargo handled at China's Coastal seaports from 2006 to 2010. In 2010, the volume of cargo handled was 5640 million tons, representing an increase of 15.8% compared to 2009. The sector achieved an average annual growth rate of 13.4% in the \"11th Five-Year Plan\" period of 2006-2010. In 2010, the majority of shipping activity occurred in 16 coastal ports which between them handled more than 100 million tons of cargo (Ningbo-Zhoushan (633 million tons), Shanghai (563 million tons), Tianjin (413 million tons), Qingdao (350 million tons), Dalian (314 million tons), Qinhuangdao (263 million tons), Tangshan (246 million tons), Rizhao (226 million tons), Yingkou (226 million tons)\uff0cShenzhen (221 million tons), Yantai (150 million tons), Zhanjiang (136 million tons), Lianyungang (127 million tons) and Xiamen (127 million tons), Beibuwan (119 million tons). Fig. 6 presents the volume of container traffic handled by China's seaports from 2006-2010. In 2010 container throughput exceeded the pre-crisis level. In 2010, coastal ports handled 131 million TEUs (20 ft equivalent units), representing a growth rate of 25.5% compared with the peak years of 2007. The marine fishery sector is also a vital component of China's ocean economy. It provides a high proportion of the protein intake for Chinese people. It also provides employment for the highest number of persons working in the Chinese ocean economy, often in rural locations where few other employment opportunities exist. In 2010, marine fishery production in the coastal region of China was falling, perhaps reflecting a resource that was already been exploited at near maximum capacity. The output of living sea resources amounted to 27.97 million tons in 2010 which was a decrease of 2.9% compared with that of the previous year. The production of mariculture amounted to 14.82 million tons in 2010, 3.5% down from the previous year. The yield from near-shore fishing in 2010 was 12.07 million tons, 10.5% down from the previous year with a further 0.89 million tons from the deep-sea fishing fleet, 8.5% up from the previous year.",
