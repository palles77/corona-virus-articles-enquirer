To construct the multi-functional DNA (MF-DNA) as a bioprobe, the 3 W J was introduced. The proposed AIV detection bioprobe should contain three functionalities: target recognition, signal amplification, and connection to substrate. To achieve this goal, each piece of the DNA 3 W J was tailored to a hemagglutinin (HA) binding aptamer, FAM dye and thiol group, respectively. The assembly of each DNA 3 W J functional fragment was then confirmed by TBM-Native PAGE. Moreover, the hAuSN was immobilized on the indium-tin-oxide (ITO) substrate for LSPR measurement. The DNA 3 W J was immobilized onto the hAuSN electrode through the thiol-group of DNA 3 W J. The fabricated DNA 3 W J/hAuSN heterolayer on the ITO substrate was investigated by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). LSPR experiments were conducted to confirm HA protein binding to the DNA 3 W J/ hAuSN -modified electrode. The proposed biosensor can detected the HA protein in PBS buffer (LOD: 1 pM) as well as in the diluted chicken serum (LOD: 1 pM). The present study details a label-free, simple fabrication method consisted of DNA 3 W J/ hAuSN heterolayer that uses easy-to-tailor elements to detect not only AIV but also various viruses detection platform easily.",

In particular, virus mutants are serious infectious pathogens because of their rapid infection speed, high infectivity and severe painful symptoms as well as the economic losses associated with their spread. Efforts to prevent such infections and develop vaccines against the viruses are underway [4] . The avian influenza virus (AIV) is particularly regarded as a highly contagious virus that infects humans and birds and, in the past, it has caused economic issues and health problems [5, 6] . The highly pathogenic H5N1 AIV infection can be transferred from birds to humans and can cause death. Usually, bird flu can only infect bird species. However, AIV mutants (H5N1) can infect humans as well [7] . Furthermore, if a human is infected with H5N1 AIV, the virus can exchange genetic information with the human flu virus and then spread to other individuals.",

            "text": "To prevent the spread of H5N1 AIV, several techniques have been proposed to identify H5N1, including surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) [8] , enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) [9] , electrochemical (EC) assays [10] , quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) [11] , Luminescence resonance energy transfer (LRET) [12] , surface plasmon resonance (SPR) [13] [14] [15] , and fluorescence [16] techniques. In order to create a portable H5N1 detection system for field use, it is important to meet the requirements of accuracy, high sensitivity, high throughput, specificity, fast signal response time, small sample size, and ease of use in the field. Among these, the optical biosensor- localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) method has been studied for high sensitivity, easy fabrication, and cost-effectiveness [17, 18] . Introduction of plasmonic nanostructures to virus detection could facilitate the field-ready portable biosensor construction. The electron oscillation originating from electromagnetic waves triggers a binding interaction event in the nanoparticle interface, thus providing high sensitivity [19] . Moreover, this plasmonic event can be tuned to excite the fluorescence dye-labeled bioprobe that exhibits ultra-sensitivity in order to detect the H5N1 virus [20, 21] . Advanced bioprobes have been developed to detect H5N1 accurately with high sensitivity. Among these, DNA aptamers are one of the powerful elements used to construct an AIV biosensor [22, 23] . However, to construct the aptasensor, a labeling process and immobilization process are usually required to enhance signals and fabricate the electrode. These processes are quite complicated, time-consuming, and laborious. Furthermore, conventional DNA only has two terminal groups at the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032, which limits embodying the multi-functionality and complicates the manufacture processes related to immobilization, labeling, and detection.",

            "text": "To overcome the present limitation, this study introduced the DNA 3-way junction (3 W J) that can introduce multi-functionality [24, 25] . Compared to packaging RNA 3 W J (pRNA 3 W J), DNA 3 W J showed the less stability [26] [27] [28] . However, for the biosensor construction, the production cost issue should also be considered. DNA 3 W J is cheaper than same sequence of RNA 3 W J for constructing MF-DNA bioprobe. Each end of the DNA arm was modified to perform the biosensor function. The 5\u2032 end of the DNA 3 W Ja was tagged to an HA protein recognition aptamer (HA Apt/3 W Ja). The 5\u2032 end of DNA 3 W Jb was labeled with FAM dye (FAM/3 W Jb) for signal enhancement. It is reported that the fluorescence dye can be excited by a plasmonic field, which increases the detection sensitivity effectively [20, 21] . To increase the LSPR enhancement effect, FAM dye was introduced. Moreover, the LSPR enhancement effect by fluorescence dye needs to adequate distance between fluorophore and nanoparticle surface [29, 30] . The FAM-tagged DNA 3 W J showed the high rigidity and provide the defined distance around 5-6 nm between FAM and hAuSN surface for making LSPR effect. As the rest of module, the 5\u2032 end of DNA 3 W Jc was labeled with a thiol-group (SH/3 W Jc) that enabled bioprobe immobilization without an additional linkage process. These functional DNA pieces were assembled well by annealing. The hAuSN-modified ITO substrate was also prepared by atmospheric plasma treatment and silanization. hAuSN has a unique local refractive index (RI) and high surface roughness that can provide increased bioprobe immobilization chances compared to normal Au nanoparticles [31] . This transparent substrate can provide a detection platform for LSPR. Synthesis of hAuSN was confirmed by field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM). The immobilization process of the multi-functional DNA 3 W J on the hAuSN-modified ITO substrate was investigated by atomic force microscopy (AFM). The sensing performance of the proposed biosensor was investigated by UV-VIS, which showed the high sensitivity of longitudinal LSPR intensity to detect the HA protein. Fig. 1 displays the schematic diagram of the AIV biosensor.",

This result shows that the hAuSN layer substrate could be applied to the LSPR biosensor for HA detection. To maximize the LSPR effect of hAuSN, various concentrations of hAuSN were employed on the ITO substrate and changes in absorbance were monitored to obtain the optimal concentration of hAuSN for LSPR biosensor fabrication. Fig. 4a shows the UV-VIS absorption spectra with various concentrations (600 ppm, 1200 ppm, 1800 ppm, 3000 ppm, and 4200 ppm) of the hAuSN layer. Because of free electron absorption, the hAuSN layer absorbed light throughout the visible ranges and an absorption peak was observed at around 541 nm. When the hAuSN concentration was changed, the LSPR peak intensity was changed. From 600 ppm (red line) to 3000 ppm (green line), the LSPR peak intensity was gradually increased. However, at 4200 ppm of hAuSN-modified ITO the LSPR peak intensity was decreased (Fig. 4b) . This effect might be elucidated by hampered light transmission due to physical adsorption and unreacted particles of hAuSN. Based on these results, we employed 3000 ppm of hAuSN for LSPR biosensor fabrication.",

Compared with UV-VIS spectra of the ITO substrate (red line), the hAuSN layer absorbed light from the visible area because of free electron absorption [19] . After DNA 3 W J immobilization, the LSPR band intensity was increased substantially (green line). Then, when HA protein was added to the DNA 3 W J/ hAuSN -modified substrate, an additional increase in the LSPR band was observed (blue line). This phenomenon could be explained by the increased thickness of the protein-DNA biomolecular layers on the hAuSN nanostructure through the plasmon effect.

In this study, the authors developed an LSPR biosensor composed of DNA 3 W J on a hAuSN -modified ITO electrode. The MF-DNA was introduced as a multi-functional bioprobe for simultaneous HA protein detection, LSPR signal enhancement, and immobilization. Construction of the multi-functional DNA was confirmed by TBM-PAGE. The hAuSN-modified ITO substrate can be easily prepared and provides a suitable detection platform for LSPR methods. AFM and FE-SEM experiments were carried out to investigate the surface topography of the hAuSN-modified ITO substrate. Moreover, LSPR measurements were then carried out to determine HA protein binding to DNA 3 W J on the hAuSN-modified electrode. For the clinical test, specificity tests and LOD tests were carried out. Respective LSPR-based AIV detection platforms have been developed. However, the proposed method can perform each experiment on a single platform without an additional labeling, immobilization, and target amplification processes. In the near future, this simple H5N1 biosensor fabrication method can be used as a powerful alternative for virus detection platforms.",

Fig. 2b shows the PAGE result of the AIapt/Zyme/SH-DNA 3 W J assembly. The gel clearly shows the AIapt-3 W Ja (lane 2), FAM-3 W Jb (lane 3), SH-3 W Jc (lane 4), and AIapt/Zyme/SH-DNA 3 W J (lane 5). The results demonstrate that the designed multi-functional bioprobe can be prepared easily. However, the prepared multifunctional bioprobe should sustain its target binding affinity and specificity. HA protein was thus reacted with the assembled AIapt/FAM/SH-DNA 3 W J. Lane 7 shows the migration retard and upper band occurrence that clearly indicates the assembled AIapt/ FAM/SH-DNA 3 W J-bound HA protein. As a negative control, the spike protein (S protein from MERS-CoV coat protein) was reacted with the assembled AIapt/FAM/SH-DNA 3 W J (lane 9). In case of lane 9, no migration change was observed compared to that in lane 5. This implies that the AIapt/FAM/SH-DNA 3 W J only showed specificity to HA protein. Therefore, the designed bioprobe can detect the HA protein specifically.",
