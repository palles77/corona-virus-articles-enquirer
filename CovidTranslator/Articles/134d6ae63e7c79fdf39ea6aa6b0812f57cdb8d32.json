The epidemiology, risk factors and outcomes of viral respiratory tract infections (vRTI) are not well described in patients with multiple myeloma managed with novel agents, the current standard of care. Methods Patients with myeloma from 2009 to 2012 who tested positive on respiratory virus multiplex polymerase chain reaction had clinical, radiological and microbiological records reviewed. The Fourth European Conference on Infections in Leukaemia (ECIL-4) definitions of RTI were applied. Univariate and multivariate regression analysis of risk factors was performed using vRTI as the evaluable outcome. Results Of 330 patients, 75 (22.7 %) tested positive for a total of 100 vRTI episodes. All patients received thalidomide, lenalidomide or bortezomib in combination with myeloma therapies (median of three treatment regimens). vRTI occurred most commonly in patients with progressive disease, and receipt of more than three lines of myeloma therapy was associated with an increased risk of vRTI (p<0.01). Amongst key respiratory pathogens, influenza was associated with the highest hospital admission rate (66.7 %), ICU admission rate (41.6 %) and mortality (33.3 %) whilst RSV was associated with prolonged hospital stay. Conclusion Patients with multiple myeloma and advanced disease managed with multiple lines of therapy are at risk for vRTI, and targeted interventions for prevention/treatment are required.",

In addition, we found receipt of ASCT, bortezomib and more than three lines of therapy were risk factors for vRTI on univariate analysis. There are several possible explanations for these findings. During a vRTI, the innate immune system initiates the host antiviral responses via intracellular signalling pathways and the release of interferon cytokines. These cytokines, including IFN-\u03b1, augment host N number, IQR interquartile range, ASCT autologous stem cell transplant, ISS international staging system, IVIG intravenous immunoglobulin # All regimens prior to onset of viral respiratory tract infection antiviral response and activate the adaptive immune system, which plays a key role in subsequent viral clearance [7] . Corticosteroid treatment for myeloma reduces monocyte counts, function and trafficking to areas of need, whilst IMiDs reduce monocyte activation. Also, bortezomib disrupts NF-K\u03b2 which impacts viral antigen presentation [2] . In addition, patients with myeloma have disease-related immune deficits including defects in cell-mediated and humeral immunity that accumulate with progression of disease [8] . In addition, patients with myeloma are known to have lower levels of specific influenza antibodies compared to healthy controls [9, 10] . These factors may explain our observations that multiple lines of treatment are a risk factor for vRTI and progressive disease being the \"at risk\" period. We have demonstrated that vRTI are associated with morbidity in patients with myeloma. Nearly 40 % of vRTI episodes required hospital admission with a median LOS of 10 days. Influenza infections in particular were associated with poor outcomes and increased use of resources. We found over two thirds of influenza vRTI were associated with hospital admission. The majority of influenza episodes (75 %) involved LRTID, which is substantially higher than that reported in previous studies of predominantly allogeneic HSCT patients (30 %) [5, 11] . Influenza episodes were associated with the highest proportion of ICU admission (41.6 %) and all-cause mortality rates (33.3 %) amongst all the RV pathogens. Mortality rates from influenza LRTID in patients with haematological malignancies and HSCT have been reported to be 15-28 % [5, 11] . In fact, patients with advanced myeloma maybe a higher risk group for complications than other patients after HSCT as demonstrated during the recent H1N1 pandemic, where more patients with myeloma required ICU management than patients with other malignancies [12] .",

Preventative measures and treatment should be evaluated in patients with myeloma to reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with influenza infections. The rate of oseltamivir treatment in our cohort may have contributed to the observed mortality, as early treatment of influenza episodes with oseltamivir has been shown to improve outcomes [13] . Seasonal influenza vaccination is well tolerated, effective and results in reduced number of URTI episodes and hospitalisation, albeit from studies undertaken before current treatment regimens were instituted [10, 14] . Current national immunisation and international consensus guidelines recommend annual seasonal influenza vaccination in patients with myeloma, with Australian guidelines recommending two doses, 1 month apart in patients not previously vaccinated [15, 16] .",
