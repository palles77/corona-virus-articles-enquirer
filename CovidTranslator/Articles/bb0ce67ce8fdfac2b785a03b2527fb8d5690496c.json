During the period from 1999 to 2007, applications of MAGE in cancer investigation have shifted from molecular profiling, identifying previously undiscovered cancer types, predicting outcomes of cancer patients, revealing metastasis signatures of solid tumors, to guiding the use of therapeutics. The roles of cancer genomic signatures have evolved through three phases. In the first phase, genomic signatures were described in stored cancer specimens and dubbed as molecular portraits of cancer. When gene expression profiles were carefully correlated with sufficient clinical information of cancer patients, new subgroups of cancers with distinct outcomes were revealed. In studies of the second phase, validation of cancer signatures was emphasized and commonly performed with independent groups of cancer specimens or independent data set. In the third phase, cancer genomic signatures have been further expanded beyond depicting the molecular portrait of cancer to predicting patient outcomes and guiding the use of cancer therapeutics. Cancer genomic signatures have become an essential part of a new generation of cancer clinical trials. It is advocated that, in future clinical trials of cancer therapy, the cancer specimens of each participant should be tested for currently available predictor genomic signatures, so that the most effective treatment with the least adverse effects for each patient can be identified. Then, participants can be triaged to an appropriate study group. [Taiwan J Obstet Gynecol 2007;46(3):222-229] ",

Their results suggested a general strategy for discovering and predicting cancer classes, which proved useful in predicting outcomes in patients with other tumor types [36] . As a proof of principle, Perou et al used cDNA microarrays to identify genes of differential expression between in vitro cultured human mammary epithelial cells and breast tumor specimens [40] . Their results supported the feasibility and usefulness of this systematic approach for studying variations in gene expression patterns in human cancers as a means to dissect and classify solid tumors [40] . Then, 64 surgical specimens of human breast tumors from 42 patients were analyzed for gene expression profiles [33] . They identified a set of co-expressed genes for which variation in mRNA levels could be related to specific features of physiologic variation. Molecular portraits of cancer with gene expression profiles were thus proposed [33] .",

Using hierarchical clustering for MAGE profiling, 40 DLBCL specimens could be divided into two distinct groups: 19 cases of germinal center B-like DLBCL, and 21 cases of activated B-like DLBCL [34] . Statistically, patients with germinal center B-like DLBCL had a better overall survival than those with activated B-like DLBCL. The molecular classification of tumors based on gene expression profiles has thus proved its ability to identify previously undetected and clinically significant subtypes of cancer [34] . Even in the same stage of disease, breast cancer is notorious for its unpredictable response to chemotherapy and variable overall outcome. Chemotherapy [42] or hormonal therapy [43] reduces the risk of distant metastasis by about a third. However, because of the lack of an accurate patient triage strategy to determine who should or should not undergo adjuvant therapy, many patients who might not develop cancer metastasis at all have unnecessarily undergone adjuvant therapy. To develop patient-tailored therapy strategies for breast cancer, van't Veer et al used supervised classification to analyze DNA microarray data on primary breast tumors of 117 young patients [35] . van't Veer et al identified a poor prognosis signature, by which they could predict a short time interval to distant metastasis. Therefore, these results provide a strategy to select patients who would benefit from adjuvant therapy.",

Notably, Ramaswamy et al analyzed whole tumor tissues including surrounding stromal cells, instead of pure cancer population that could be isolated using laser capture microdissection. In the 17-gene metastasis signature identified in that study, two collagen genes and one lamin gene were upregulated, suggesting that malignancy is the product of the tumor-host microenvironment [44] .",

However, even if the same group samples were analyzed, distinct prognostic profiles have been derived for outcome prediction [35, [48] [49] [50] [51] . To resolve this paradox, Fan et al compared the prediction powers of the gene sets for the same group of specimens by applying five geneexpression-based models: intrinsic subtypes, 70-gene profile, wound response, recurrence score, and the two-gene ratio [53] . By performing Kaplan-Meier survival analyses of 295 patients with breast cancer, Fan et al found that four of the five models tested showed significant agreement in the outcome prediction for individual patients. The only exception was the model using two-gene ratio, which could not result in a reliable prediction [53] . The explanation for the surprising concordance among the four different models in predicting breast cancer outcomes is likely to be as follows: there was a large group of genes, which behaved differently and were related to biologic phenotypes of cancer, and ultimately, the patients' outcomes. In this large list of genes, each of the four models might have used only some of them to construct the signature profiles used for predicting outcomes.",

Applying this strategy, they were able to specifically isolate the subsequent events as defined by the activation/deregulation of that single oncogenic pathway, and analyze these events with Affymetrix oligonucleotide microarrays [54] . In clinical samples of lung, breast and ovarian cancers, Bild et al combined signature-based predictions across several pathways and identified coordinated patterns of pathway deregulation that distinguish between specific cancer and tumor subtypes [54] . Using pathway-specific inhibitors such as Ras pathway inhibitors, either farnesyltransferase inhibitor (L-744832) or farnesylthiosalicylic acid, and the Src pathway inhibitor (SU6656), Bild et al could predict drug sensitivity of tested breast cancer cell lines according to their pathway deregulation. In summary, predictions of pathway deregulation in cancer cells can also predict the sensitivity to therapeutic agents that target components of the pathway. These results pave the path of using these oncogenic pathway signatures to guide the use of target therapeutics.",

In the first phase, genomic signatures were described in stored cancer specimens and dubbed as molecular portraits of cancer [33] . When gene expression profiles were carefully correlated with sufficient clinical information of cancer patients, new subgroups of cancers with distinct outcomes were revealed [34] . In studies of the second phase, validation of cancer signatures was emphasized and commonly done with independent groups of cancer specimens or independent data sets [22, 25, 35, 39] . In the third phase, cancer genomic signatures have been expanded beyond depicting the molecular portrait of cancer to predicting patient outcomes [45, 46] , including metastasis [37] . It has become a rule, in the third phase, that all of the prognostic genomic signatures be validated in additional data sets. Potti et al further demonstrated the role of cancer genomic signatures as a guide to the use of cancer therapeutics [38] . A new generation of cancer clinical trials was proposed, in which the cancer specimens of each participant should be tested for currently available predictor genomic signatures so that the most effective treatment and the least adverse effects for each patient could be identified. Then, participants can be triaged to an appropriate study group (Figure) . In fact, successful examples in treating patients with early-stage non-small cell lung cancer were reported by Potti et al [59] and in treating those with advanced-stage ovarian cancer by Dressman et al [60] .",

Indeed, mRNA expression is only a coarse surrogate for protein activation levels. For many genes, however, mRNA expression is a useful surrogate [23] . As documented in many studies, when one finds strong signals of differential expression, these are typically reflected later at the protein levels. The latter can be validated by protein assays such as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays [5] or immunohistochemistry [4] .",

Many biomedical researchers and clinicians predict that microarray technology will be incorporated into clinical laboratories in hospitals in the near future. As extrapolated from the results of the studies discussed in this article, the use of a \"focused array\" to measure the expression of 50 to 100 genes in the signature profile for a selected disease would help clinicians predict the patient's response to a drug, triage patients into a chemo-responsive versus chemo-resistant group, and evaluate a panel of risk Three phases of genomic signatures in cancer therapy and a new generation of clinical trials. This schema is adapted from Herbst and Lippman [58] and Potti et al [38] . factors that may result in comorbidity of the patient. To achieve this practical feasibility, microarray technology would need to address a range of quality-control issues. Every aspect of the process should be so robust that it can be considered to be foolproof. It is predicted that within the next 10 years, microarray developers will meet these challenges [13] .",
