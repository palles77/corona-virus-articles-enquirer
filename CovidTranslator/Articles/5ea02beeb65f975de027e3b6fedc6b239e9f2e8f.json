            "text": "siRNA-aptamer chimeras have emerged as one of the most promising approaches for targeted delivery of siRNA due to the modularity of their diblock RNA structure, relatively lower cost over other targeted delivery approaches, and, most importantly, the outstanding potential for clinical translation. However, additional challenges must be addressed for efficient RNA interference (RNAi), in particular, endosomal escape. Currently, vast majority of siRNA delivery vehicles are based on cationic materials, which form complexes with negatively charged siRNA. Unfortunately, these approaches complicate the formulations again by forming large complexes with heterogeneous sizes, unfavorable surface charges, colloidal instability, and poor targeting ligand orientation. Here, we report the development of a small and simple protein tag that complements the therapeutic and targeting functionalities of chimera with two functional domains: a dsRNA binding domain (dsRBD) for siRNA docking and a pH-dependent polyhistidine to disrupt endosomal membrane. The protein selectively tags along the siRNA block of individual chimera, rendering the overall size of the complex small, desirable for deep tissue penetration, and the aptamer block accessible for target recognition. More interestingly, we found that extending the c-terminal polyhistidine segment in the protein tag to 18 amino acids completely abolishes the RNA binding function of dsRBD. s iRNA is of considerable current interest because it can elicit potent, target-specific knockdown of virtually any mRNA, creating new opportunities for personalized medicine and for addressing a broad range of traditionally undruggable disease targets using small molecules 1-3 . Similar to other antisense approaches, however, cell-specific delivery of siRNA technology in vivo still represents a major technical hurdle 4 . To guide siRNA to diseased cells, targeting ligands such as small molecules, lipids, peptides, and proteins have been identified and linked directly to siRNA or on the surface of siRNA nanocarriers 5-10 . Considering the complex physical and chemical structures of various formulations, the siRNA-targeting ligand-delivery vehicle complexes face difficulty in large-scale production and regulatory approval for clinical uses.",

            "text": "Recently, siRNA-aptamer chimera, employing only RNA molecules, has emerged as a highly promising approach for cell type-specific RNAi, owing to its low immunogenicity, ease of chemical synthesis and modification, small size, and the targeting specificity of aptamers. RNA-based aptamers are identified through in vitro enrichment known as SELEX (systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment) 11-14 . Similar to antibodies, they are capable of binding to various molecular targets including small molecules, proteins, and cells, while offering key advantages as they can be completely identified and produced with desired chemical modifications in vitro through automated processes. For aptamer-guided siRNA delivery, exciting works by McNamara, Dassie, and coworkers show that chimeras composed of aptamer targeting prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA) and siRNA targeting anti-apoptotic genes (Plk1) have been made and optimized 15,16 . The aptamer block recognizes PSMA on prostate tumor cell surface and leads to chimera cell internalization, whereas the siRNA block enzymatically cleaved from the chimera promotes cell death. Significantly reduced tumor mass was observed in mouse xenograft models of prostate tumor after administration of the chimera, though the exact mechanism of chimera endosomal escape remains unclear 17 . This limitation helps explain why high concentrations of chimera were required in these pioneer studies to treat prostate tumors 15, 16 .",

Common delivery vehicles include lipids, polymers, and inorganic nanoparticles such as gold, silica, magnetic, and semiconductor nanoparticles [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] . For siRNA immobilization, condensation, stabilization against enzymatic degradation, and endosomal escape, virtually all these nanocarriers are positively charged, and so are their siRNA complexes. Unfortunately, the electrostatically induced nanocarrier-chimera condensation almost completely defies the purpose of simple formulation for siRNA clinical translation because the final nanoparticles become complex again, with mixed sizes, surface properties, aptamer conformations and orientations, and batchto-batch variations.

Furthermore, it is ideal to make the aptamer loop structure exposed and the siRNA block hidden for specific binding, but electrostatic condensation with cationic nanocarriers does not warrant that selectivity. As demonstrated previously, immobilizing siRNA-aptamer chimeras onto cationic nanoparticles via the siRNA end offers significantly improved silencing effect compared to condensing chimeras onto cationic nanoparticles through random sites 24 . This is understandable since (1) exposure of the siRNA end would only increase the chances of non-specific binding and reduce the stability siRNA against enzymatic degradation; and (2) interaction between cationic nanocarriers with anionic aptamers could alter aptamers' conformation and targeting capability 25 . Therefore, it is of critical importance to design a delivery system that is simple for potential regulatory approval and mass production, universal for all siRNAaptamer chimera, neutral and siRNA-binding specific to ensure aptamer targeting, and small to avoid major alteration of chimera's biodistribution profile. A system simultaneously achieving these features could expedite clinically translation of the highly promising siRNA-aptamer chimera technology.",

At neutral pH (such as in circulation), they are mainly deprotonated (uncharged), which is desirable over positively charged counterparts due to reduced accumulation within the RES (reticuloendothelial system).

The dsRBD domain comes from the first 172 amino acids of human protein kinase R (hPKR), and has two double-strand RNA binding motifs (dsRBM1 and dsRBM2) for cooperative and dsRNA-specific binding 31 . Because dsRBM1 towards the N terminal dominates the binding with dsRNA 32 , we introduced the histidine peptide towards the C terminal ( Figure 1 ) to minimize impact on dsRBD's biological activity. In theory, the endosomal escape capability should increase with longer His chain; on the other hand, long His chain could potentially interfere with dsRBD protein folding and binding. To achieve a balance, dsRBD with Cterminal Histidines of various lengths (His n , n 5 0, 12, 18, and 24) were cloned into the PET28a (1) vector. BamH1 and Xho1 restriction enzyme sites were introduced to the 59-and 39-flanking region by PCR, respectively. Because all the genetic constructs contain His 6 at the N-terminal from the cloning vector (this Nterminal His 6 has been previously proved to have no impact on dsRBD binding) 26 , the total numbers of His encoded by the final constructs are 6, 18, 24, and 30, respectively (sequences see Methods).",

As shown in Figure 2b , the dsRNA binding capability of dsRBD with His 12 at the C terminus (total His 18 ) is well preserved compared with dsRBD without a Cterminus histag insertion. The minimum RNA length for high affinity binding with dsRBD has been determined to be 16 base-pairs 26 . At the current RNA length, the siRNA segment and the adjacent short stem in the aptamer structure can bind with 1-2 copies of dsRBD. However, it has been well documented that only the first dsRBD binds to RNA stably, while, at high dsRBD/RNA ratio, a second copy of dsRBD can bind, but at significantly lower affinity 26, 33 .

At the current gate value set for GFP fluorescence intensity, the original untreated cells showed a GFP-negative population of 17.4%. Treating the cells with a random sequenced siRNA with protein tag (His 18 ) shows virtually no change in this population (difference: 5.4% of total cell population, within error range) proving sequence-specific silencing of RNAi. For cells treated with GFP siRNA and chimera, the GFP negative cells only increase by 7.6% and 12.2% of the total cell population respectively. Even by increasing the chimera concentration by ten times (1 mM), the total GFPnegative cell population only increase by ,20% (Supplementary Figure S1) , strongly suggesting the need of carrier materials. Direct comparison of the chimera tagged by dsRBD-His 6 and dsRBD-His 18 shows major difference in silencing efficiency, too (14.6% and 59.6% change). Taken together, these results clearly indicate that (1) chimera alone at concentration commonly used in RNAi experiments does not lead to effective silencing, and (2) His 18 is remarkably more effective than His 6 in endosomal destabilization since the dsRBD block is identical in structure and function. To put the silencing efficiency of dsRBD-His 18 in the context of those of conventional RNA delivery vehicles such as Lipofectamine, quantitative flow cytometry was also conducted. In agreement with the microscopy results shown in Figure 2d , Lipofectamine reduces GFP-negative cells from the original 17.4% to 91.6% (74.2% change, Supplementary Figure  S2 ), which is slightly more efficient than the protein tag. However, it is important to note that Lipofectamine delivers chimera into cells mainly via electrostatic interactions (positively charged Lipofectamine and negatively charged cell surface, non-targeted delivery), whereas our protein tag delivers chimera by cell type-specific molecular recognition (targeted delivery). It is also worth mentioning that the molar ratio of mixing chimera with protein tag is 152 because the siRNA block can bind up to 2 copies of dsRBD, although the second copy has very weak binding affinity. Indeed, changing the binding ratio to 1 or 4 does not affect the RNAi efficiency (Supplementary Figure S3) .",

More importantly, employing only RNA molecules, the simple formulation of chimera-based targeted siRNA therapy leads to outstanding clinical translation 15, 16 . Due to the incapability of chimera to efficiently escape endosome, delivery nanocarriers are needed. However, almost all current targeted siRNA delivery formulations involve cationic nanocarriers such as polymers, inorganic nanoparticles, peptides, and proteins 7, 19, 20, 27, 28, [38] [39] [40] [41] [42] [43] [44] . Unfortunately, these conventional siRNA nanocarriers are unsuitable for chimera delivery, and, in fact, reverse the signature property of chimera, simple formulation for regulatory approval and clinical translation 15, 16 . This is because the charge induced complex formation is basically an aggregation process, which lacks control over aggregate size, shape, stoichiometry, chimera orientation, aptamer functionality, and reproducibility during scale-up production. In addition, the final complexes often carriers positive charges as well, which is unfavorable for systemic uses 23 . As a result, first clinical trials of siRNA duplexes are mainly limited to local administrations [45] [46] [47] [48] .",

            "text": "Our protein tag does not rely on high positive charge to interact with RNA molecules. In fact, it only recognizes relatively long dsRNAs (.16 bp) such as the siRNA segment and the short stem region of the aptamer in our chimera molecule. Extensive biochemistry investigations have shown that for the current length of the chimera, maximum two copies of dsRBD can bind to it with differential affinity (the first copy binds much stronger than the second copy). The gene silencing experiments conducted here reflect this effect since mixing chimera with 13 or 23 protein tags does not affect the silencing efficiency. Considering the molecular weights of the chimera (28.8 kDa) and the protein tag (24.8 kDa), molecular weight of the final complex at 151 binding will become 53.6 kDa. Based on well-documented size effect for in vivo drug delivery 49 , this size is sufficiently large to reduce premature renal clearance while still small enough for deep tissue penetration. For example, by tagging siRNA-aptamer chimera with a 20 kDa PEG, its in vivo circulating half-life has been shown to increase from approximately 30 min to 30 hours 15 ; whereas large nanoparticles (.30 nm) have been shown to be ineffective in tumor treatment except for some hyperpermeable tumors 50 .",

The resulted protein tag shares the simplicity feature of siRNA-aptamer chimera, yet offers exactly complementary functionalities. The dsRBD selectively binds to the siRNA block, leaving the targeting aptamer accessible. In terms of size, different from conventional cationic delivery vehicles, the dsRBD-His 18 tagged chimera remains discrete in solution rather than forming large aggregates. In terms of functionalities, chimera and dsRBD-His 18 are highly complementary to each other, and thus offer the complete set of features necessary for targeted siRNA delivery (e.g., targeting, therapeutic, siRNA protection, and endosomal escape). This platform is also universal, able to chaperone any chimera sequences for cell type-specific delivery. Largely based on natural proteins, dsRBD-His 18 is an excellent candidate for potential clinical translation because of its simple structure and biodegradability. Further development of this small protein tag with in vivo testing should raise exciting opportunities for siRNA clinical translation and personalized medicine.",

The purified PCR product was used as the template for in vitro transcription with MEGAscriptT7 Kit (Ambion) according to manufacturer's instruction. 29 fluoro-modified pyrimidines (TriLink, San Diego) were added to replace CTP and UTP.

Motility patterns of the four protein tags are in agreement with their calculated molecular weights of 22.6 kDa (His 6 ), 24.8 kDa (His 18 ), 25.8 kDa (His 24 ), and 26.8 kDa (His 30 ). (b) Characterization of dsRNA binding capability of the four protein tags with agarose gel electrophoresis. Chimera labeled with fluorophore (FAM) was incubated with the protein tags at protein/chimera molar ratios of 1, 2, or 4 for 1 h at 4uC. The dsRNA binding capability of dsRBD-His 18 is well preserved compared to the original dsRBD-His 6 , whereas dsRBD-His 24 and dsRBD-His 30 completely lose dsRNA binding activity.

PSMA-positive LNCaP cells and PSMA-negative PC3 cells are treated with complex of Cy3-labeled chimera and dsRBD-His 18 for 12 h.
