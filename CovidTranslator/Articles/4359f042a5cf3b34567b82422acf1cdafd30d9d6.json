Highly pathogenic strains of influenza A, such as H5N1, have the capacity to cause severe illness or death in ferrets. The use of ferrets as a model of influenza infection is currently limited by a lack of species-specific immunological reagents. Interferon gamma (IFN-g) plays a key role in the development of innate and adaptive immunity and the regulation of Th1-type immune responses. Here we describe the cloning of the full-length cDNA for ferret IFN-g. Multiple sequence alignment of the predicted amino acid sequence with those of other species indicates that the predicted ferret protein shares the highest identity with Eurasian badger IFN-g. We raised two hybridoma clones expressing monoclonal antibodies against recombinant ferret IFN-g capable of detecting IFN-g protein derived from mitogenstimulated ferret PBMCs by immunoblotting, ELISA and ELISPOT assay. Finally, an ELISA utilizing the ferret-specific antibodies detected elevated levels of IFN-g in serum samples from H3N2 influenza A-infected ferrets.",

            "text": "Cytokines are important mediators of the immune response and have been shown to play a pivotal role in host immune defense to microbial infection [5] . Interferon gamma (IFN-g) has been recognized as a multipotent cytokine due to its broad range of regulatory functions during virus-induced host immune responses [6, 7] . IFN-g can directly influence the differentiation of T cells and promote Th1-type immune responses in CD4 + and CD8 + T cells [5, 8] . Virtually all immune cell types express receptors for IFN-g and are influenced by this cytokine. Signaling by IFN-g leads to up-regulation of class II major histocompatibility complex (MHC) expression, which in turn increases the antigen presentation to CD4 + T cells by macrophages, dendritic cells, and B cells [9, 10] . IFN-g also increases the expression of class I MHC, resulting in enhanced stimulation of antigenspecific CD8 + T cells [11, 12] . Upon stimulation of these cells by IFN-g, CD8 + T cells are important in the eradication of intracellular virus during recovery from viral infections [13] [14] [15] . Moreover, high levels of IFN-g bias the polarity of CD4 + T helper cells towards a Th1 phenotype, characterized by production of IL-2 and IFN-g [16, 17] . A Th1-type immune response is fundamental to the development of host immunity against many pathogens, including influenza A virus [18] [19] [20] . IFN-g is also necessary for T cell-mediated viral clearance and limitation of latent viral infections [21] . Moreover, IFN-g production is considered to be critical in determining vaccine efficacy [22, 23] . Therefore, measurement of IFN-g production in both natural and experimental influenza A virus infections will improve our understanding of the antiviral immune response, which may assist the development of more effective vaccines.",

Ferrets (Mustela putorius furo) have been used by researchers to identify novel viruses, determine strain toxicity and evaluate vaccines [28] . Ferrets are naturally susceptible to human strains of influenza virus and display many of the same symptoms that appear in humans, including sneezing, nasal discharge, weight loss and an increased body temperature [29] . Indeed, the Spanish flu virus (H1N1) was first identified in ferrets [28] . Ferrets therefore represent a fundamentally important model for studying the transmission and pathogenesis of influenza. A current limitation to the ferret influenza model, however, is the lack of species-specific immunological reagents required to assess host responses in vaccinated and infected animals. In the current study, we report the full-length cloning of the ferret IFN-g cDNA, expression of the recombinant cytokine, and the generation of monoclonal antibodies suitable for ELISA and ELISPOT detection of natural ferret IFN-g.",

The cDNA sequence and predicted amino acid sequence for ferret IFN-g are depicted in Figure 1A . Amino acid sequence homology to the predicted ferret IFN-g was highest in the Eurasian badger (Meles meles) (97%), followed by the canine (86%) and feline (83%) sequences ( Figure 1B) . The homology of ferret IFN-g to human and mouse IFN-g was 63% and 48%, respectively. Phylogenetic analysis using BLAST (see Figure 1C ) indicates that closest orthologue of ferret IFN-g is that of the badger. The ferret IFN-g cDNA was subcloned into the His 6 -,V5-fusion protein expression vector and subsequently transfected into COS-7 cells to produce recombinant IFN-g protein. Ferret IFN-g protein was secreted from the COS-7 transfectants (fIFNg-COS-7) and migrated as a 35-45 kDa band when subjected to immunoblotting experiments using a V5-specific antibody (Figure 2 ).

Neither human nor mouse-specific arrays resulted in the positive detection as antibodies did not cross react with ferret IFN-g. We are therefore prompted to generate monoclonal antibodies specific to ferret IFN-g. To produce ferret IFN-g specific antibodies, recombinant IFN-g was conjugated to a carrier protein, KLH (keyhole limpet hemocyanin) using glutaraldehyde. The resulting KLH-IFN-g complex was injected i.p. into Balb/c mice. Following fusion of splenocytes isolated from IFN-g-immunized mice with hybridoma parent cells, IFN-g-reactive B cell hybridomas were established. Hybridoma clones, selected by ELISA reactivity, were tested for specificity by immunoblotting against recombinant ferret IFN-g and supernatants from mitogen-stimulated ferret PBMCs (Figure 3) . Clone 3E7 recognized a 36 kDa band in samples of recombinant ferret IFN-g, demonstrating that the ferret IFN-g reactive monoclonal antibody can also detect the dimerized form of IFN-g ( Figure 3 ). Additionally, a weak band at 65 kDa was consistently observed indicating a possible detection of another oligomeric form of ferret IFN-g ( Figure 3 ). Interestingly, the study of culture supernatants derived from mitogen-stimulated PBMCs showed prominent bands at 60-70 kDa and the band at 36 kDa was only weakly detectable ( Figure 3) . The data indicates that the native ferret IFN-g exists as an oligomeric form (likely a dimer of the dimer), while the recombinant IFN-g exists predominantly as a single dimer.",

To this end, we tested our monoclonal antibodies for utility in a ferret IFN-g-specific ELISA assay. To select the antibody pair for IFN-g recognition in ELISA assays, we tested monoclonal antibodies derived from different clones. The clone 3E7 was conjugated to biotin and used as the detection antibody against ferret IFN-g and antibodies from five other clones were used to coat the assay wells. Of the five monoclonal anti-ferret IFN-g antibodies that we screened in this manner, the clone 1E3 consistently showed the presence of Ferret IFN-g in mitogenstimulated ferret spleen cell supernatants. Therefore, we decided to continue using 1E3 as the ELISA capture antibody paired with 3E7 as the detection antibody. As shown in Figure 4A , an ELISA was carried out using the paired capture and biotin-conjugated detection antibodies, and demonstrated an increase in optical density that correlated directly with the concentration of purified recombinant IFN-g. The increase in optical density exhibited a smooth logarithmic correlation between 10 pg/ml and 10 ng/ml of recombinant IFN-g protein (R 2 \u00bc 0.9826). Using this standard curve, we measured the concentration of IFN-g in in vitrostimulated PBMC supernatants. IFN-g was present only in samples that were treated with PMA in conjunction with a Ca 2+ ionophore ( Figure 4B ). The results indicate that the monoclonal antibodies selected are applicable for ferret IFN-g-specific ELISA.",

The assay showed substantial levels of circulating IFN-g on day 6 post-infection ( Figure 5 ). The level of IFN-g in serum from the non-infected control ferret was below the detection limit.

Previous studies on IFN-g have shown that there is a strict species-specific activity of IFN-g. IFN-g genes isolated from diverse species such as guinea pig, turkey, rhino, and catfish have been previously described in the literature [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] .

            "text": "Unexpectedly, the monomeric form of IFN-g (17 kDa) was detectable at only low levels in recombinant ferret IFN-g samples. Instead, a dominant band at 36 kDa was consistently observed during Western blotting whereas a weak band at 65-70 kDa was also observed in the same sample. Conversely, when native IFN-g in mitogen-stimulated PBMC culture supernatants were investigated with monoclonal antibodies, dominant bands were identified at 65-70 kDa and the 36 kDa band was barely detectable. Oligomeric forms of IFN-g were very stable aggregates, as treatment with reducing reagents, guanidine or urea did not disrupt the IFN-g into its monomeric form (unpublished data). Since the IFN-g dimer was also observed in supernatants from mitogen-stimulated ferret PBMC cultures, it is unlikely that the dimerization is caused by the epitope tags present on the recombinant protein. The recombinant IFN-g dimer was found to have biological function consistent with known IFN-g activity [36] . Treatment of ferret PBMC cultures with the dimerized recombinant IFN-g increased the surface presentation of class II MHC (unpublished data), suggesting that the recombinant ferret IFN-g is able to maintain biological function in the dimerized form. We observed, however, an IFN-g-specific band in Western blotting of mitogen-stimulated PBMC culture supernatants at a molecular mass at 65 kDa. This suggests that the probable form of ferret IFN-g in vivo exists in tetrameric form rather than a dimeric form. Our observation of recombinant ferret IFN-g seems to contradict the recent report on guinea pig IFN-g in which recombinant IFN-g was shown to exist primarily as a monomer [30] . Recombinant guinea pig IFN-g was expressed in bacteria, and the purified protein was capable of stimulating the class II MHC expression in guinea pig cells. It has been reported previously that human IFN-g shows a dominant band at approximately 65 kDa in immunoblotting and human IFN-g specific receptors are shown to be reactive with IFN-g dimers [37] . Other groups have demonstrated that carbohydrate modification alters the molecular nature of human IFN-g [38] . Taken together, these observations suggest that it is not unreasonable to find that ferret IFN-g may exist in monomeric, dimeric and oligomeric forms. Subtle variation in amino acid sequences between two species may result in differences in post-translational modification by glycosylation, which could result in differential association of monomers into oligomers. Alternatively, the origin of cells secreting IFN-g, such as CD8 + T cells or NK cells, may determine the differences observed in IFN-g oligomerization. The interaction between ferret IFN-g and its receptor under physiological conditions may be mediated by IFN-g dimerization or oligomerization. Whether or not dimerization is the mechanism of IFN-g activation in other species obviously requires further investigation. Cloning and expression of biologically active ferret IFN-g is critical in the development of immunoassays such as ELISPOT and ELISAs for detection of interferon production and interferon producing cells. These reagents will be invaluable in the assessment of vaccine efficacy against influenza A and other emerging infectious viruses. Figure 6 ELISPOT assay for the IFN-g producing cells in mitogen-stimulated ferret PBMCs. ELISPOT assay was performed in the same manner outlined for Figure 4 for capture and detection. Ferret PBMCs were plated in serial dilution and stimulated with PMA plus ionomycin for 18 h and IFN-g secreting cells were detected by biotinylated capture antibody. The y-axis depicts the number of IFN-g spot forming cells per well; total cells per well are indicated on the x-axis. Data shown are the average of triplicate samples.",
