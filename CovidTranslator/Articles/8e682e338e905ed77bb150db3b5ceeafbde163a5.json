[1] [2] [3] [4] Despite their successes, these methods are haunted by false positives, compounds that initially appear to have a desired biological activity but on closer evaluation are found to act by spurious mechanisms. Often, these counterfeit screening hits have peculiar behaviors that cannot be reconciled with canonical modes of inhibition. These compounds are ultimately found to be developmental dead-ends and are discarded, typically after a great deal of time and resources has been devoted to them.",

            "text": "The frustration caused by such molecules is compounded by their prevalence; it has been estimated that in any given experimental HTS, the ratio of false positives to true positives is at best 1:1 and more likely 10:1. 5 This enrichment of phony inhibitors has led to increased scrutiny of hit lists and an increased interest in developing filters and counterscreens to rapidly recognize and eliminate 'non-lead-like' compounds from further consideration. [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] Toward this end, work over the last decade has been devoted to understanding the origins of false-positive screening hits. Experimental artifact, such as compound impurity 12 or assay interference, 7,13 is a well-known cause. Inhibitor promiscuity due to reactive groups 14, 15 or privileged scaffolds [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] has also been described. More recently, aggregate formation has emerged as a potential mechanism of promiscuous inhibition. 23, 24 This model proposes that some nonspecific inhibitors form aggregates in solution and that the aggregate species is responsible for enzyme inhibition (Figure 1 ). Preliminary studies suggest that aggregate-forming promiscuous compounds may be common among screening libraries and hit lists. This chapter will initially focus on nonspecific enzyme inhibition as caused by aggregate-forming molecules and will review experimental methods for the identification of such compounds. Computational algorithms for the prediction of all types of promiscuous inhibitors will then be discussed and outstanding questions regarding promiscuous inhibitors in drug discovery will be considered.",

Although various screening techniques and algorithms had been developed, it became apparent that the output from these largescale methods was suboptimal.

Despite the use of filters for reactivity, 14 chemical swill, 11 and druglikeness, 25 problematic molecules continued to appear on screening hit lists.

            "text": "To explore the underlying mechanism responsible for this perplexing behavior, 115 compounds were initially investigated. This included 45 screening hits, 23 , 24 15 leads used as experimental tools, 26 and 55 clinically prescribed drugs. 27 Of the 115 compounds studied, 53 were found to inhibit diverse model enzymes, including b-lactamase, chymotrypsin, dihydrofolate reductase, and b-galactosidase. These promiscuous compounds showed time-dependent inhibition that was sensitive to enzyme concentration, the presence of bovine serum albumin (BSA), and ionic strength. Based on these observations, it was hypothesized that the nonspecific compounds formed aggregates in solution, and the aggregate particles caused enzyme inhibition ( Figure 1 ). 23 Consistent with this hypothesis, dynamic light scattering (DLS) and transmission electron microscopy revealed that the promiscuous compounds formed particles on the order of 30-1000 nm in diameter; these particles were absent from solutions of nonpromiscuous compounds. 23 How did the aggregate particles interact with enzyme molecules to cause inhibition? 24 Centrifugation experiments suggested a direct interaction between aggregate-forming inhibitors and enzyme molecules; this interaction was disrupted by the addition of detergent such as Triton X-100. 24 Aggregate formation and enzyme inhibition by the promiscuous compounds were also prevented or rapidly reversed by the addition of Triton X-100. 24 Additional microscopy studies showed that protein molecules were adsorbed onto the surface of the aggregate particles, although absorption into the aggregate interior could not be excluded. This interaction was also prevented by the addition of detergent such as Triton X-100. 24 To account for these observations, it was proposed that some promiscuous compounds form aggregates in solution and enzyme molecules adsorb onto the surface of the aggregate particle, resulting in reversible enzyme inhibition ( Figure 1) . 24 Since the first proposal of this model, a growing number of research groups have identified potential aggregate-based inhibitors among their screening hits ( Table 1) . Their observations, in addition to the initial, small-scale evaluation of the prevalence of aggregators suggest that they occur among screening hits, 23,28-31 small-molecule reagents used in the lab, 26 and, surprisingly, even clinically used drugs. 27, 32 A recent study evaluating 1030 random druglike molecules suggests that up to 19% show experimental signatures of aggregate-based promiscuity. 33 Because of the potentially widespread occurrence of aggregate formers, there is much interest in the development of rapid experimental methods for the identification of these promiscuous compounds. There has also been a growing interest in the development of computational models to predict compounds likely to act as aggregate formers because such filters could be used to remove suspect molecules from screening libraries or from hit lists. These experimental and computational efforts are considered in turn in the following sections. ",

Depending on the purposes of the research effort, these experiments can be tailored appropriately. For most early-stage discovery programs, the following experiments are performed to answer the question: Is this hit likely inhibiting the screening target as an aggregate? If the answer is yes, it is unlikely that the hit will be a favorable starting point for lead design and it should be dropped from further consideration immediately, as the pain of throwing out compounds early in the process pales in comparison to the agony of abandoning leads that have been through several nonproductive development cycles. If the answer to the above question is no, then one element of the hit's potential has been reassuringly established. The necessary experiments and examples of their recent application in drug discovery projects are described below; detailed recipes for performing these assays have been described elsewhere. 43 ",

All of the library compounds were assayed against each target enzyme in the presence and absence of 0.001 or 0.01% Triton X-100 to ultimately identify the specific inhibitors. 35 Detergents have also been used to study the inhibition of PTP1b by ertiprotafib, a compound that had reached phase II clinical trials ( Table 1) . 32 The IC 50 of ertiprotafib against 1 nM PTP1b increased 10-fold with the addition of 0.01% Triton X-100.

If aggregate formation is involved, inhibition ought to decrease from 50% to less than 40% against the 10-fold greater concentration of enzyme. This assay requires that the ratio of inhibitor to enzyme remains elevated, on the order of 1000:1 or greater, even after the enzyme concentration has been increased. Many assays may not be able to tolerate increases in enzyme concentration due to cost, limited reagent availability, or an increased reaction rate that makes it technically difficult to obtain accurate velocity measurements. In such cases, it may be helpful to decrease the initial assay concentration of the enzyme or to use alternative substrates with slower reaction rates. 23 As in the detergent assay described above, a well-behaved inhibitor should not be affected by the increase in enzyme concentration and can serve as a negative control. 23 A known aggregator that has been shown to be sensitive to enzyme concentration should be used as a positive control. 23, 26, 27 This protocol has also been used by several research groups to evaluate screening hits. 13, 28, 36, 37 For example, Disperse Blue against 3.3 mg mL \u00c0 1 phosphomannomutase/phosphoglucomutase (PMM/PGM) had an IC 50 of 5 mM; when the enzyme concentration was increased to 33 mg mL \u00c0 1 , the compound did not show any detectable inhibition up to 10 mM. 28 Similarly, the IC 50 of ertiprotafib against PTP1b increased from 1.6 to 9 mM as the concentration of the enzyme increased from 10 to 100 nM. 32 ",

Depending on the level of certainty required, testing against one dissimilar enzyme may be sufficient; testing against two or more provides additional reassurance. Screening across receptors also allows for investigation of other mechanisms of promiscuity, such as chemical reactivity or privileged scaffolds; nonspecific inhibition from any mechanism may be sufficient to drop the compound from further optimization studies.",

Instead, they found that the compound behaved as a parabolic, noncompetitive inhibitor, and they proposed that the kinetic signature of time-dependent inhibition with a nonlinear dependence on inhibitor concentration may be a marker for aggregation. 28 Future studies to evaluate the generalization of this observation are certainly anticipated. In the meantime, it should be noted that time-dependent inhibition is consistent with several modes of enzyme inhibition and is not singularly sufficient to denote a compound as an aggregator.",

            "text": "The biochemical experiments described above provide phenomenological support for the identification of an aggregatebased inhibitor, but they do not yield direct evidence for the presence of aggregate particles. To obtain such data, a biophysical method such as DLS is necessary. DLS has a growing number of applications in the biological and material sciences, but this discussion will focus on the use of DLS to determine if particles are present in a solution of a promiscuous inhibitor and, if so, what is their size? In conjunction with the assays previously described, DLS completes the series of experiments typically needed to characterize a promiscuous, aggregate-based inhibitor. DLS is most commonly used to analyze particles with a diameter of 1-1000 nm. In a standard setup, a sample of the solution under study is placed in a chamber and exposed to a laser. Particles in the sample cause the laser light to scatter. A detector at a fixed angle relative to the chamber records the scattered photons over a period of time, usually tens of seconds to minutes. Because particles in the sample undergo Brownian motion, the intensity of the scattered light measured by the detector will fluctuate, typically on the microsecond timescale. These fluctuations reflect the rate of diffusion by the particle in solution, which in turn depends on the hydrodynamic radius of the particle according to the Stokes-Einstein equation. The necessary calculations are performed by software provided with the DLS instrument, and given certain assumptions about particle shape and distribution, the hydrodynamic radius can be used as a measure of particle size. This is only a brief explanation of the method; for more details on the theory and practice of DLS, see descriptions by Santos 51 and Wyatt. 52 For analysis of a promiscuous inhibitor, the first task is to determine if particles are present. Graphically, this can be determined from the shape of the autocorrelation function obtained during the DLS experiment. For instance, rottlerin is a known promiscuous, aggregate-forming inhibitor, 26 and it yields an autocorrelation function with well-defined decay on the microsecond timescale as shown in Figure 3a . The same is true for K-252c, another promiscuous kinase inhibitor (Figure 3b) . Surprisingly, suramin, a compound that is known to inhibit multiple targets, produces an autocorrelation function with a poorly defined decay, suggesting that it does not form aggregates in solution (Figure 3c ). 26 Additionally, it is useful to note the average intensity of the scattered light at the detector during the experiment. This is usually reported as counts per second (cps) or kilocounts per second (kps). The absolute value of the intensity will depend on the particular instrument used, but solutions that are known to be particle free, such as filtered water, should yield average intensities at least an order of magnitude less than that of solutions known to contain particles, such as latex beads or albumin. Therefore, it is worthwhile to conduct both positive and negative control experiments to evaluate the signal-to-noise ratio of the instrument.",

Notably, GFP retains its fluorescence signal in the presence of I4PTH, suggesting that the protein is not denatured by the aggregates (Figure 4b) . Higher resolution imaging of similar solutions of b-galactosidase and I4PTH obtained by transmission electron microscopy show that the protein adsorbs onto the surface of the inhibitor aggregate (Figure 4e) , and with the addition of detergent, this interaction is prevented (Figure 4f ). These observations, in combination with biochemical and biophysical studies, suggest that enzyme is adsorbed onto the surface of the aggregate particles and thereby inhibited, although absorption into the aggregate interior cannot be excluded. 24 Furthermore, the interaction between aggregate and enzyme can be prevented or reversed by the addition of Triton X-100. 24 Electron microscopy is an intensive process not typically amenable to screening, although there has been at least one report of a research program using transmission electron microscopy to evaluate a novel drug lead for aggregation. 39 The technique was also used to visualize aggregates formed by NNRTIs studied by Arnold's group; although these compounds were not considered promiscuous, aggregate formation was suggested to mediate bioavailability of the drugs. 44 ",

For instance, Jenkins and colleagues used a fluorescence-based HTS to identify angiogenin inhibitors. 13 The initial set of hits was re-plated with activated fluorescent substrate to evaluate the hits for interference with the fluorescent readout; strikingly, 73% of the hits were found to interfere. 13 Screening for chemical reactivity may also be productive. The ability of the same screening hit to inhibit diverse receptors, as described above, may be the first sign of reactivity. Time-dependent behavior may also suggest an irreversible reaction. More directly, some authors have found it useful to repeat the screening assay in the presence of dithiothreitol (DTT) to evaluate hits for thiol reactivity. 15, 30 Alternatively, mass spectrometry (MS) has been used to evaluate compounds for adduct formation. 15 Less glamorously but no less importantly, it is often useful to evaluate the purity of screening hits because the observed activity may be due to a contaminant. A variety of approaches are possible; most simply, a new solution of the compound can be prepared from fresh powder or with powder from a different lot. 15 Alternatively, the compound can be repurified and then reassayed. 15 For a more rigorous analysis, HPLC or MS can be employed to detect impurities. 12 ",

To predict compounds likely to act as frequent hitters, Roche and colleagues first developed a database of known frequent hitters. These compounds were culled from compounds that had hit in at least eight different HTS assays, compounds from an in-house depository that had been requested by at least six different discovery projects, and additional compounds from various sites within Roche. 53 Eleven teams of medicinal chemists voted on the structures to identify molecules that according to their expert opinion and experience were likely to be frequent hitters. To obtain a set of nonfrequent hitters, a diverse set of compounds from the Roche human drug database were selected. The final data set contained 479 frequent hitters and 423 nonfrequent hitters. 53 Structural analysis with LeadScope revealed that no single substructure was sufficient to identify a frequent hitter. To extend the analysis, Ghose and Crippen descriptors were calculated for all compounds in the data set and used to define a partial least squares (PLS) multivariate linear regression model. The PLS model correctly predicted 92% of frequent hitters and 88% of nonfrequent hitters. The group then developed a nonlinear model using a neural network, again based on the Ghose and Crippen descriptors. The final model correctly classified 90% of frequent hitters and 91% of nonfrequent hitters. 53 As the authors explained, 'frequent hitter' is not synonymous with 'undesired structure;' for instance, ligands that bind a similar set of receptors will cross-react because of common substructures. Therefore, this model was not intended for elimination of compounds but for prioritization of compounds for purchase, library design, or testing.",

Seidler and colleagues screened 50 clinically prescribed drugs and found that seven showed aggregate-based inhibition of b-lactamase, chymotrypsin, and malate dehydrogenase. 27 These experimental results were used to develop a data set of 111 compounds containing 48 aggregators and 63 nonaggregators. Simple cutoffs based on solubility or ClogP classified 87% or 81% of the 111 compounds correctly, respectively. To obtain a more precise model, a recursive partitioning algorithm based on 260 physicochemical descriptors was developed ( Figure 5 ). As shown in Table 2 , the model correctly classified 43 of 48 aggregators (90%) and 61 of 63 nonaggregators (97%). 27 The same neural network 53 and SVM method 54 described in the preceding section were then tested against the 111 compounds in the aggregator test set; the results are described fully in 54 and briefly here ( Table 2 ). The neural net identified 30 of 48 aggregators (63%) and 53 of 63 nonaggregators (84%) with a Matthew's correlation coefficient of 0.48. The SVM method correctly predicted 32 of 48 aggregators (67%) and 58 of 63 nonaggregators (92%) with a Matthew's correlation coefficient of 0.63. In summary, these methods did not discriminate between aggregators and nonaggregators as well as the recursive partitioning model. One obvious cause is that these models were trained against a data set containing frequent hitters acting by a variety of mechanisms, not simply aggregation. Nonetheless, it is remarkable that these algorithms performed as well as they did, given that the molecules on which they were trained were not specifically designated aggregators or nonaggregators. Indeed, it is intriguing to consider that the frequent hitters data set may include (as yet unidentified) aggregators, thereby contributing to the success of these models.",

These privileged substructures are often starting points for the design of ligands with improved specificity for a particular receptor. This section will review two pharmacophore-based studies describing the use of privileged substructures for designing G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) targeted compound libraries 17 and for identifying promiscuous kinase inhibitors. 16 Mason and co-workers introduced a method for generating 4-point pharmacophores that could be modified to include a pharmacophore for a particular substructure such as a privileged scaffold. 17 Using Chem-X, atom types were automatically generated and assigned to a feature type used to generate the pharmacophore. Atom types or dummy centroid atoms unique to a privileged substructure were designated as a special 'privileged' feature type. This feature type was designated as one of the four points used to generate the pharmacophore map for the compound. Because all of the subsequent pharmacophore descriptor sets contained the privileged substructure, molecular similarity and diversity could be compared relative to their shared privileged scaffold. The authors proposed that this could be used as an aid for library design, either to imitate features of known active compounds or to explore 'missing diversity' among existing compounds containing the desired scaffold. The latter goal could be accomplished by using molecules containing the privileged substructure as reagents to obtain desired chemically accessible products. 17 In addition, the method was shown to identify pharmacophores enriched among a class of ligands sharing similar biological activity. For instance, structural features shared by GPCR ligands were distinguished from those in a set of small molecule enzyme inhibitors and in a set of random compounds. 17 The method could also be used to address ligand selectivity by comparing pharmacophore keys across sets of ligands for related enzymes, such as trypsin, thrombin, and factor Xa. More recent work has explored the use of pharmacophores for describing related binding sites, for instance see 55 .",

Selective inhibitors were defined as compounds that had a K i value less than 50 nM against only one of the five kinases and greater than 50 nM against the other four. Both the promiscuous and selective compounds were known to exhibit ATP-competitive kinase inhibition at nanomolar concentrations. In total, the authors compiled a set of 43 frequent hitters and 209 selective inhibitors. 16 Ligand-bound structures of four of the promiscuous compounds had been solved in-house; these structures were aligned and used to generate a five-point pharmacophore composed of two hydrogen bond donors, two hydrogen bond acceptors, and one aromatic feature. 16 These results were compared against the frequent hitter and selective inhibitor data sets described above; 38 of 43 frequent hitters (88%) but only 10 of 209 selective inhibitors (5%) matched the pharmacophore. Considering only selective inhibitors with a K i value less than 2 nM for one of the kinases (25-fold greater specificity), 0 of 61 compounds (0%) matched the pharmacophore. Therefore, the pharmacophore captured some of the features that distinguished frequent hitters from specific inhibitors. 16 By placing the pharmacophore features in the ATP binding site, it was possible to identify interactions between conserved kinase residues and the frequent hitters that contributed to the inhibitors' promiscuity. The authors proposed that either by addition of features beyond those five associated with promiscuity or subtraction of at least one of the substructures represented by the pharmacophore, it might be possible to engineer ligands with greater specificity for a given kinase. 16 ",

For example, Blanchard and co-workers reported that of 69 HTS hits against coronavirus protease, 64 (93%) were discarded after repeat assays with DTT suggested thiol reactivity. 30 To address this persistent problem, Hajduk's group at Abbott has proposed the thiol reactivity index (TRI) for estimating the probability that a given compound will be reactive. 15 Their recently developed ALARM NMR method for detecting thiol reactivity found that of 476 lead compounds experimentally shown to be reactive, only 156 (33%) were predicted as such by computational filters. To better define the relevant moieties, structural descriptors were calculated for a series of reactive compounds. The probability of reactivity (P R ) for any given structure was then defined as the sum over all structural descriptors of the number of occurrences of each descriptor in that compound weighted by the TRI for that descriptor. If the P R for a compound was greater than 0.3, the compound was predicted to be reactive. The TRI for each descriptor was determined by using nonlinear regression to maximize the agreement between observed and predicted reactivity as described by a scoring function. 15 The final set of 75 nonzero TRIs was applied to a data set of 3504 compounds studied by ALARM NMR. 15 Using a P R of 0.3, 486 of 509 experimentally reactive compounds (95%) were correctly predicted and 2005 of 2995 experimentally nonreactive compounds (67%) were correctly predicted. As described, the method has a high sensitivity and a low number of false negatives, making it a useful flag for identifying compounds for follow-up experimental reactivity testing. 15 ",

The DockVision/Ludi combination ranked 33% of the true hits in the top 10% of the total database for a 3.3-fold enrichment over random and the GOLD algorithm placed 42% of the true hits in the top 2% to yield a 21-fold enrichment.

Indeed, it is interesting to speculate on possible consequences of aggregation by drugs. But aggregation at micromolar concentrations leading to inhibition of nontarget receptors does not change the fact that the drug also inhibits its target at nanomolar concentrations. This is the important difference between a drug that inhibits off-pathway targets via aggregation and a hit that inhibits its screening target via aggregation. The purpose of screening is to find new leads for inhibitor design. A screening hit that is only active because it inhibits its target receptor via aggregation is likely not a good starting point for further design work and should be abandoned. Furthermore, even though the screening hit shares the same pathology (aggregation) as a real drug, it does not necessarily follow that it may also share the same desired feature (classical inhibition of a target). Conversely, aggregation at micromolar concentrations does not exclude the possibility that the compound may also act as a specific inhibitor of a given target at nanomolar concentrations.",

What factors determine the size of the particle formed by each aggregator? Preliminary observations have been made by a few groups. For instance, Frenkel and colleagues analyzed SARs among 15 aggregating NNRTIs and found that compounds containing oxygen atoms tended to form larger particles. 44 The authors proposed that oxygen's ability to serve as a hydrogen bond donor could result in different interactions from a similarly placed carbon or nitrogen atom and consequently lead to different aggregation patterns. In a separate study, Seidler and co-workers studied a series of azole antifungals, four of which were aggregate formers and two of which were not. 27 Interestingly, the two nonaggregators are prescribed as orally available medications, but the four aggregators are only administered as topical agents. These compounds could be distinguished from each other based on their ClogP values, with the aggregators having a ClogP greater than 5 and the nonaggregators having a value less than 5. 27 In addition to physical properties, potential structural descriptors have been suggested by the various computational models described above. Additionally, pharmacophore-based methods may be a useful approach for studying SARs among these compounds. It is hoped that as more small molecules are explicitly studied for aggregation, the structural influences leading to aggregation will be better defined and the mechanism itself will be better understood.",
