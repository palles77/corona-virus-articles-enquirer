While convenient, these methodologies often result in unintentional genetic alterations, which have lead to adaptation and even attenuation in animal models of disease. An example is the attenuation of hantaviruses (family: Bunyaviridae, genus: Hantavirus) when cultured in vitro. In this case, viruses propagated in the natural reservoir species cause disease in nonhuman primates that closely mimics the human disease, but passaging in cell culture attenuates these viruses to the extent that do not cause any measurable disease in nonhuman primates. As efforts to develop animal models progress, it will be important to take into account the influences that culture in vitro may have on the virulence of viruses. In this review we discuss this phenomenon in the context of past and recent examples in the published literature.",

Several attempts to experimentally recreate the clinical features of HFRS in NHPs demonstrated that a variety of species were susceptible to infection, but did not develop overt signs of disease. After the characterization of hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome (HCPS, also referred to as hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS)) and the discovery of highly pathogenic New World hantaviruses in 1993, efforts continued to model hantavirus diseases, but the outcomes were the same: inoculation of NHPs with New World hantaviruses amplified in cell culture resulted in asymptomatic, self-limiting infection (Safronetz, Prescott, Feldmann, unpublished data) (McElroy et al., 2002) .",

Interestingly, propagation in cell culture may result in loss of the ability to reliably infect their natural reservoirs (Fulhorst et al., 1997 ). An example is provided by Puumala virus (PUUV), an etiological agent of a mild form of HFRS commonly referred to as nephropathia epidemica (NE), which is carried by the bank vole (Clethrionomys glareolus) (L\u00e4hdevirta et al., 1984) . Genetic analysis revealed that point mutations in the nucleocapsid and polymerase genes accompanied adaptation to Vero cells in culture (Nemirov et al., 2003) . Interestingly, when re-introduced into laboratory-reared bank voles, the Vero-propagated PUUV was unable to reliably establish infection. These findings led to the hypothesis that an accurate NHP model of nephropathia epidemica might require the inoculation of virus derived directly from bank voles, rather than virus propagated in cell culture. The pivotal article by Klingstrom and colleagues demonstrated just that: PUUV prepared from tissues of infected voles caused a mild disease in macaques, including low-grade fever, proteinuria and microhematuria as well as a transient viremia, resembling the human condition (Klingstrom et al., 2002) .",

We inoculated macaques with Sin Nombre virus (SNV), the primary agent of HCPS in North America, which was derived either from Vero cell culture or directly from tissue homogenates obtained from infected deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus), the natural reservoir of SNV. Analogous to the previous PUUV study, the macaques that were inoculated with deer mouse-derived SNV developed HCPS, with 7 of 10 animals becoming severely ill and requiring euthanasia, with a disease that fully recapitulated the human condition (Safronetz et al. 2013) . Similar to the 2002 study by McElroy et al., macaques which received the Vero-propagated SNV experienced only a self-limiting infection without visible signs of illness. Genetically, the SNV viruses utilized in these experiments differed by only a few mutations in the nucleocapsid and polymerase genes. Nevertheless, the loss of virulence associated with Vero cell culture highlights an important and potentially widespread problem in the field of virology.",

As obligate intracellular organisms, the procedure of 'growth in pure culture' in virology differs substantially from the solid phase media cultures described by Koch for bacteriology. Multiple steps are required for a virus to replicate in cell culture, and each step may impose selective pressure on the population. Host cells are required for the propagation of viruses. This propagation inevitably results in a mixed population of viruses. For the purpose of this article we propose that 'pure culture' for virus isolation means propagating viruses using in vitro preparations, such as mammalian cell culture. Historically, viruses were isolated by inoculating susceptible laboratory animals or embryonated eggs with small quantities of homogenized tissues or fluids obtained from biological specimens. Utilizing modern in vitro culture techniques, most viruses are now isolated by inoculating susceptible, generally immortalized, cells with biological material containing the desired agent. Accordingly, virus preparations are obtained by collecting supernatants or lysed cell homogenates. These methods facilitate obtaining high-titer virus stocks which can be concentrated and purified (e.g., using a sucrose gradient), and allow for the serial propagation and molecular characterization of viruses that can readily be grown in culture. While it is often assumed that the starting and final virus populations are the same, in fact there is always some degree of genetic change resulting from \"adaptation\" to the cultured cells. There are therefore several limitations for many viruses generated in this fashion, potentially reducing the biological relevance of in vivo studies performed with cell culture-derived viruses.",

These novel variants may out-replicate wild-type viruses encoding virulence factors, such as immune modulating factors, that are required for replication in a host species. As a consequence, passaging viruses in cell culture, chick embryos, or sometimes in animals has led to attenuation for humans and potential usefulness as prophylactic vaccines. One of the first vaccines to be produced by serial passaging was the oral polio vaccine (OPV), in which the accumulation of nucleotide changes during passaging at a sub-physiological temperature resulted in the loss of the ability of the virus to be neuroinvasive (Sabin et al., 1960) . Following the success of the OPV, many other attenuated viral vaccines have been developed using this method, including vaccines for measles, mumps, rubella, rotavirus, yellow fever, rabies, varicella-zoster and Influenza viruses (Minor, 2015) .",

Low-passage isolates of Ebola Zaire-Mayinga virus obtained from human specimens and amplified in cell culture are uniformly lethal for NHPs, while common laboratory mice inoculated with the same viruses support only limited replication, and do not become ill. Passaging of Mayinga virus in suckling mice resulted in an adapted strain which was lethal in mature, immunocompetent mice, but somewhat attenuated for NHPs (Bray et al., 2001 (Bray et al., , 1998 . Interestingly, the generation of large stocks of the mouse-adapted virus in Vero cells has resulted in a partial loss of its lethal phenotype in mice, presumably due to the lack of selective pressures in cell culture (M Bray, personal communication) . Recent findings also demonstrate that genomic alterations of wild-type Ebola viruses occur during propagation in cell culture. Amplification in cell culture, particularly interferon-deficient cell lines including Vero cells, leads to an accumulation of a subpopulation of viruses containing eight adenosine residues at a crucial editing site within the viral glycoprotein gene (Volchkova et al., 2011) . After a few passages, the\" 8A\" mutated viruses essentially out-compete and replace wild-type \"7A\" viruses. This change been suggested to reduce pathogenicity of the virus for guinea pigs; however, these results appear to contradict observations in NHPs (Kugelman et al., 2012) .",

Viruses in nature are subjected to pressures exerted by the immune response and by infection of specific cell types, and although mutations accumulate and quasispecies may form, biological pressure limits the fitness of viruses that might be able to replicate in a less stringent system. Removing this pressure through propagation in cell culture, particularly in deficient cell lines like Vero cells, results in 'freedom' for mutant viruses to accumulate to a greater extent than would be possible in vivo. These mutant viruses may be more effectively targeted by the immune system, and are therefore attenuated when reintroduced into a host animal. A specific example is provided by the adaptation of vaccine strains of measles virus. While gaining fitness for replication in cell culture, these viruses no longer need to antagonize and evade the innate immune defenses, as this immune pressure is not present in many cell culture systems. These tissue culture-passaged viruses therefore undergo regressive evolution and mutations arise in both the P and V proteins, which allow the wild-type virus to inhibit type I and type II interferon signaling, and the adapted virus loses its pathogenicity in rhesus macaques (Bankamp et al., 2008) .",

The temperature at which a virus replicates in its host may therefore be different than the typical 37\u00b0C temperature used in tissue culture. Also, a virus replicating in the respiratory tract would be subjected to temperatures lower than that of a virus replicating systemically. Similarly, viruses that replicate in arthropods such as mosquitoes and ticks would be accustomed to much different temperatures in a mammalian host or in cell culture. Temperature differences impose selective pressure favoring certain novel variants resulting from mutation, that may produce conformational changes in proteins, increased or decreased protein dynamics, including protease cleavage and other enzymatic activities, or interactions between macromolecules.",

Recognizing that natural selection invariably accompanies any mode of virus propagation, researchers should examine procedures and choose those that are least likely to introduce unwanted changes in phenotype, to ensure accurate modeling of virushost interactions. Some laboratories have established colonies of the natural reservoir species of certain viruses, such as the rodents that carry hantaviruses, and viruses may also be propagated in mosquitoes or ticks. Although propagation of viruses in this manner can be difficult, it may circumvent adaptations that can result in decreased pathogenicity. For example, the SNV preparation we used to develop the NHP model for HCPS was initially characterized by Dr. Brian Hjelle and colleagues in the late 90's (Botten et al., 2000) . Continuous passage of this virus in deer mice at the University of New Mexico and more recently at Rocky Mountain Laboratories for almost two decades has not altered the viral phenotype in these mice.",

For example, flaviviruses and alphaviruses grown on mosquito cells interact differently with the human innate immune response than viruses grown on mammalian cells (Shabman et al., 2007; Silva et al., 2007) . Similarly, Sindbis virus grown on the C6/36 insect cell line is much more infectious in human dendritic cells than the same virus propagated in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, even though both viruses use the same receptors (DC-SIGN/L-SIGN) (Klimstra et al., 2003) . In some cases, phenotypic changes have been linked to differences in the makeup of the virus particles as they bud through membranes of cells derived from a natural host, instead of the typical cells used for virus propagation. For example, when Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) is propagated on mosquito cells, it incorporates an additional viral glycoprotein into its virion, but not when the virus is grown in mammalian cells. The incorporation of this protein appears to be necessary for productive infections in ruminants, as viremia occurs when goats and sheep are inoculated with virus propagated in C6/36 cells, but not when they are inoculated with a Vero-derived RVFV isolate (Weingartl et al., 2014b) (Weingartl et al., 2014a) .",

Similar conclusions may be drawn from NHP experiments with many seasonal strains of influenza virus or the etiological agents of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (Old World hantaviruses), which similarly have a long and in many cases undefined passage history (Bouvier and Lowen, 2010; Groen et al., 1995) .",
