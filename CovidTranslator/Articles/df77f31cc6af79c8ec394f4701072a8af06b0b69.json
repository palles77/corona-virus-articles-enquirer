A systematic diagnostic approach is necessary in these cases to achieve the appropriate diagnosis and formulate an effective treatment plan. In all exotic species, husbandry plays a central role in the pathogenesis of cutaneous disease, so a thorough evaluation of the husbandry is critical for successful management. There are vast differences in the structure and function of the skin in exotic species; an understanding of these unique properties is important when treating skin disease in exotic pets. This article focuses on the clinical approach to skin disease in exotic pets including structure and function of the skin, appropriate diagnostic testing, and differential diagnoses for commonly encountered cutaneous diseases. study of dermatologic lesions in reptiles found that from 29% to 64% (dependent on institution and reptile group) of the cases had underlying husbandry-related deficiencies. 1 ",

[2] [3] [4] The three layers of the epidermis are (1) stratum corneum (six to eight cell layers, heavily keratinized); (2) stratum intermedium; and (3) stratum germinativum (deepest). [2] [3] [4] Two types of keratins compose the stratum corneum. 4 The softer more flexible a-keratins are elastic and pliable and form the suture/hinges and spaces between scales. 4 The b-keratins (unique to birds and reptiles) compose the hard horny scale. 4 The skin is protected by scales produced by the stratum germinativum; scales are separated by scale pockets. 2 The keratinized layers of chelonians are modified into scutes. 5 The scales or scutes of chelonians and some lizards (plated and girdled lizards, skinks, and crocodilians) are underlain by dermal bony plates referred to as osteoderms or osteoscutes. [2] [3] [4] [5] In tortoises, the stratum corneum produces the shell, which consists of the carapace (dorsal) and plastron (ventral); the keratinized scutes cover osteoderms that fuse with the vertebrae and sternebrae. [2] [3] [4] Chromatophores (pigment cells) are found in the dermis and melanocytes are present within the stratum germinativum. 3 Reptiles shed their skin at regular intervals in a process called ecdysis. The skin of lizards and chelonians shed in several smaller pieces, whereas snakes typically shed their entire skin as one piece. 4 Chelonians and crocodilians shed their epidermis continuously, whereas lizards and snakes shed their epidermis periodically. 5 ",

The skin of amphibians is clinically the most important organ system of amphibians and varies depending on the life stage (premetamorphosis or postmetamorphosis); habitat (generally divided into aquatic or terrestrial); and the species. 6 The skin functions in osmoregulation, gas respiration, and water absorption. 6, 7 Amphibian epidermis is typically thin; keratinized; and consists of the stratum corneum, stratum granulosum, stratum spinosum, and the stratum basale. [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] Modifications of amphibian skin include the presence of dermal scales (caecilians); folds and grooves for increased surface area (salamanders); partial ossification of the cranial skin and adherence to the skull (bufonids); a specialized highly vascularized ventral dermal organ for water absorption (\"drinking patch\" in anurans); and the presence of dermal bones (some anurans). 10, 12 The stratum corneum is typically shed in one piece at regular intervals and consumed (dermatophagy) unless the animal is ill. 6, 11, 13 The skin of anurans is loosely adhered to the body and can become edematous in disease states. 11 Two key features separate adult caecilians and anurans from their larval form: the epidermis is keratinized in adults and the dermis contains a variety of dermal glands. 7, 9, 11 Mucus, produced by mucous glands and epithelial cells, aids in respiration, prevents evaporative water loss, contains antibacterial and antifungal properties, can be defensive noxious or contain toxic chemicals, may act as pheromones, and can aid in reproduction. 12, [14] [15] [16] [17] Dermatologic Examination and Diagnostic Testing A thorough history and dermatologic examination are important when evaluating any case of amphibian skin disease. Husbandry-related factors often underlie the development of many skin diseases in amphibians. Important questions to consider include recent introductions into the collection; diet; and tank setup including filtration, aeration, water quality, and temperature. During examination, it is important to always handle amphibians with rinsed gloves to avoid damaging their skin and prevent cutaneous absorption of potentially toxic glandular secretions. [18] [19] [20] Many amphibian skin diseases can have a similar appearance with cutaneous hyperemia and discoloration, dermal papules and nodules, ulceration, hemorrhages, edema, and excess mucus being the most common findings. 21 Clinical Approach to Dermatologic Disease Commonly used dermatologic diagnostic tests in amphibians include the following:",

The cuticle (outermost layer) is approximately 1 mm thick and contains mucus, sloughed cells, and cellular debris. It has antimicrobial properties mediated by antibodies (IgM), free fatty acids, and lysozymes. 30, 31 This layer is commonly referred to as the \"slime coat\" by aquarium hobbyists because of its high concentration of mucus. This layer is usually lost during routine processing for histopathology. Together with the cuticle, the epidermis produces a waterproof barrier. The epidermis is a nonkeratinizing (most species) stratified squamous epithelium that contains 3 to 20 cell layers. 30, 31 It contains many mucus-producing goblet cells and, in some species, club cells that secrete an \"alarm substance\" when the skin is damaged. Unlike mammals, epidermal cells are not keratinized and are capable of mitotic division in all layers; however, division most commonly occurs in cells adjacent to the basement membrane where the epidermis junctions with the dermis. 30, 31 The upper dermis contains collagen and reticulin and forms a supportive network; the deeper dermis contains more compact collagen and provides the main structural strength to the skin. 30, 31 Scales are flexible bony plates that develop in scale pockets in the dermis; they are not shed regularly. 30, 31 As scales emerge they are covered by a layer of epidermis, and often overlap one another, providing structural support and protection. Two main types (ctenoid and cycloid scales) are described that differ in surface sculpture. 30, 31 Ultrastructurally, scales contain collagen fibers interspersed with an organic matrix in which hydroxyapatite crystals are deposited. 30, 31 Some fish are scaleless and histologically have a thicker epidermis. Chromatophores (pigment cells) are present in the dermis and include melanophores; xanthophores (yellow); erythrophores (orange-red); leucophores (white); and iridophores (reflective/iridescent/silver). The pigments consist mainly of carotenoids. The subcutis contains connective tissue and fat and is highly vascular; bacterial disease can spread rapidly along this layer. 30, 31 Dermatologic Examination and Diagnostic Testing",

If there are lesions on the skin, a coverslip should be dragged across lesional skin in a head-to-tail direction, collecting mucus on the coverslip. The coverslip is then placed onto a slide with a drop of tank water. Some fish require sedation for this procedure. Sedation may reduce the number of ectoparasites found on skin scrapings. ii. When there are no obvious lesions on the skin, sites commonly sampled include just caudal to the pectoral fin, operculum, and the ventrum. Samples should be taken from two to three different sites; when possible, several fish should be sampled. b. Gill biopsy i. Gill is epithelial tissue and many ectoparasites affect the gills and skin. Occasionally, ectoparasites are found only on the gills. ii. Typically requires sedation iii. The operculum is lifted and a small snip of distal gill lamellae is taken (usually with iris scissors) and placed onto a slide with a drop of tank or pond water to examine. c. Skin scrapings and gill biopsies are examined under the microscope; superior results are obtained with the condenser down. Most parasites can be seen on \u00c24 or \u00c210 magnification. However, with some smaller parasites, such as Ichythobodo, and bacteria, such as Flavobacterium columnare, \u00c240 magnification is required. 3. Bacterial culture and sensitivity a.

The cells show signs of keratinization in the stratum transitivum. 33 Feathers are formed from feather follicles in the dermis. The dermis is thicker than the epidermis and contains structurally supportive collagen, blood vessels, fat, nerves and neuroreceptors, feather follicles, and associated smooth muscle. 32, 33 Avian skin is aglandular with the exception of the uropygial (or preen) glands; the pericloacal glands (secrete mucus); and the sebaceous glands of the ear canal. 32, 33 The uropygial gland is a holocrine gland found at the base of the tail that secretes a liposebaceous material important in protecting and waterproofing feathers; it is spread through the feathers in a process called preening that is also necessary for interlocking of feather barbules. 32, 33 Feathers are arranged into tracts known as pterylae that are separated by featherless areas of skin called apteria. [32] [33] [34] Table 4 illustrates the common feather types and their properties. The calamus is the part of the feather that attaches to the follicle. [32] [33] [34] The main shaft of the feather is called the rachis; where the rachis meets the calamus is a pulp cap referred to as the superior umbilicus. [32] [33] [34] There may be a smaller feather attached to the superior umbilicus that is referred to as the after feather. [32] [33] [34] Projections from the rachis are referred to as barbs, which bear projections called barbules. [32] [33] [34] Most barbules contain hooks called barbicels that hold the barbs and barbules together. [32] [33] [34] Molting occurs when the growth of a new feather in the follicle forces out the older feather; all feathers of adult birds are replaced regularly during molting. Most species of pet birds molt once to twice yearly. 32, 33 Dermatologic Examination and Diagnostic Testing A thorough history and dermatologic examination are important when evaluating any case of avian skin disease. Dermatologic examination in birds should include evaluation of feathers, skin, beak and cere, ears, legs and claws, preen gland, and cloaca. Common findings during clinical examination of birds with skin disease include feather abnormalities (broken or absent feathers, dystrophic and discolored feathers); scaling; crusting; ulceration; redness; and nodules and masses. Commonly used dermatologic diagnostic tests in pet birds include the following:",

            "text": "The basic structure and function of exotic small mammal skin is very similar to that of the dog and cat. Relevant differences are discussed. The skin is divided into a fourlayered avascular epidermis (stratum corneum, stratum granulosum, stratum spinosum, stratum basale) and the underlying, structurally supportive, collagenous, and vascular dermis. The subcutis is below the dermis and consists of connective tissue and fat. In rodents, brown fat is located between the scapulae, in the ventral neck, and in the axillary and inguinal regions; it is more prominent in smaller rodents, rabbits, and ferrets and less so in guinea pigs and chinchillas. 37 Fig. 10 . Gyropus ovalis from a guinea pig. Fig. 11 . Cystic ovarian disease resulting in symmetric noninflammatory flank alopecia. Hairs can be divided into primary (guard) hairs; secondary (undercoat) hairs; and tactile hairs. 37 The number of hairs per follicle varies with the species, breed, age, and other external factors; chinchillas have as many as 60 hairs per follicle, producing the characteristic dense soft coat. 37 The keratinized hair consists of the innermost medulla, pigmented cortex, and outermost cuticle. Primary hairs are associated with sebaceous glands, apocrine sweat glands, and an arrector pili muscle. Rodents and ferrets have no epitrichial (apocrine) sweat glands. 37 Secondary hairs are typically only accompanied by sebaceous glands. 37 The rat and mouse tail is very sparsely haired. In interfollicular regions, there is surface parakeratosis and no stratum granulosum, whereas follicular ostia contain the typical orthokeratosis and stratum granulosum; these changes give the tail its characteristic scaly appearance. 37 The footpads are areas of specialized thickened epidermis with underlying shockabsorbing fat deposits. Atrichial (eccrine) sweat glands are located only in the footpad. Rabbits lack foot pads, but instead have coarse fur on their distal limbs. Sebaceous scent glands are a common feature in many small mammal species and are important in scent marking and communication. Hamsters have large darkly pigmented glands on their flanks, more prominent in males. 37 Gerbils have large oval-shaped yellowish hairless scent glands on the ventrum. 37 Guinea pigs have a large gland over the rump that can secrete an oily substance, especially in boars. 37 Rabbits have sebaceous scent glands on the chin (mental gland) that is used for territorial marking, anal glands, and androgen-dependent inguinal scent glands. 37 Ferrets have active sebaceous glands throughout their skin that results in their typical musky odor and greasy coat; they also have two prominent perianal scent glands. 37 As with other exotic species, a thorough questioning and evaluation of the husbandry is critical for successful diagnosis and treatment of small mammal dermatoses. Important questions include those pertaining to the environment and husbandry (type of housing, indoor or outdoor, substrate or bedding, diet, and so forth), and more targeted questions pertaining to skin disease. In small mammals, it is important to know whether the condition is pruritic and whether any other animals are affected.",
