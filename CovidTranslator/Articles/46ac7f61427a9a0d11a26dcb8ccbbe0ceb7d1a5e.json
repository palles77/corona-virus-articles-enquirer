            "text": "Pathologic rheumatoid factor (RF) levels are hallmarks of several human diseases. Production of monoclonal RF in vitro is essential for studies of the antigenic specificities of RF, as well as for a dissection of the mechanisms of aberrant RF + B cell activation. We have expanded upon previous methods to develop a flow cytometry-based method to efficiently clone monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) from humans with expansions of RF-like, immunoglobulin heavy chain variable region (IgVH) 1-69 gene segment-containing B cells. The cloned variable regions are expressed as IgM and produced during culture at concentrations between 5-20 \u03bcg/ml. Using this system, we show that clonal Igs from patients with HCV-related mixed cryoglobulinemia, when expressed as IgM, have RF activity. We anticipate that this system will be useful for the cloning and expression of mAbs partially encoded by VH1-69 and for determination of the reactivity patterns of polyspecific, low-affinity IgMs of human pathogenic importance.",

            "text": "A high level of circulating IgM rheumatoid factor (RF) is a feature of several human autoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome, systemic sclerosis, and hepatitis C virus-associated mixed cryoglobulinemia (HCV MC). By definition, RF has reactivity towards IgG Fc; however, Fc specificities vary with disease process and RF mutational status (Bonagura et al., 1998) . In vitro production of monoclonal RF has traditionally involved heterohybridomas (Brown et al., 1990) or EBV-transformed lymphocytes (Steinitz et al., 1980) ; however, both of these are highly selective, lowefficiency processes (Laffly and Sodoyer, 2005) . A protocol for the efficient transformation of human memory B cells has more recently been described (Traggiai et al., 2004) , but this procedure is limited to memory B cells that can be activated by CpG and transformed by EBV. In HCV MC, however, the clonal B cells are often CD21 low/\u2212 (Charles et al., 2008) , and are resistant to EBV infection in vitro. A relatively nonbiased system for cloning of IgVH from singly-sorted B cells and expression as human IgG 1 has been well-described (Wardemann et al., 2003; Tiller et al., 2008) . This system is not restricted to particular B cell populations and does not require prior B cell stimulation. However, expression of IgM RF as an IgG 1 poses several difficulties for downstream specificity analyses. First, avidity may be lost upon conversion from a decavalent IgM to a bivalent IgG. Second, the expressed IgG 1 RF could form immune complexes due to the presence of the antigen-binding domain and its target antigen in the same molecule. Third, heavy chain constant region domain swapping may affect affinity, specificity and V-region structure (reviewed in (Torres and Casadevall, 2008) ). Motivated by these considerations, we have built upon this previous system to develop a flow cytometry-based method to clone RF-like Ig from humans with expansions of VH1-69 + B cells and express it as IgM in high yield, in order to more accurately assess the reactivities of the RF-like IgM towards putative antigens.",

We have previously reported that HCV MC is associated with a clonal expansion of modestly hypermutated IgM + \u03ba + memory B cells that express Ig encoded by VH1-69 and V\u03ba3-20 gene segments. The G6 mAb, which recognizes the VH1-69 gene product (Potter et al., 1999) , has previously been used to identify these clonally-expanded B cells in HCV MC patients (Carbonari et al., 2005) . We have singly-sorted G6 + B cells by FACS and performed nonbiased IgVH and IgV\u03ba RT-PCR as previously described (Wardemann et al., 2003) ; sequencing confirmed the overwhelming majority of these cells to be VH1-69 + /JH4 + /V\u03ba3-20 + . We next performed a third round of VH1-69/JH4-specific and V\u03ba3-20-specific PCR to correct for 5' IgV mutations introduced by the unbiased first and second stage PCR primers. IgVH and IgV\u03ba were then ligated into Ig\u03bc and Ig\u03ba expression vectors. We then co-transfected these constructs into 293T cells expressing human J chain. After 6 days of culture, supernatants typically contained 5-20 \u03bcg/ml IgM, which was demonstrated to have RF activity by ELISA.",

After digestion with HindIII/XhoI, the product was ligated into pcDNA3.1 Zeo (+) (Invitrogen). Plasmid was transfected into 293T cells using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Individual cells were plated by limiting dilution in 96-well dishes, and following Zeocin selection, were expanded into 12-well dishes. Supernatants from each well were screened for IgJ production by ELISA. Cells with the highest level of IgJ secretion were subsequently used for IgM expression.",

The sorting strategy for a representative HCV + MC + patient (LDU 125) is shown in Figure 2 . After gating on live lymphocytes as described above, FSC and SSC doublets were excluded, and G6 + CD20 + B cell subsets were identified ( Fig. 2A) . G6 + and G6 \u2212 B cell subsets may be subsequently sorted on the basis of CD27 and CD21 staining (Fig. 2B ) or FCRL4 staining (not shown) for either Ig RT-PCR or cell function analysis. For Ig cloning, cells were singly-sorted into individual wells of a 96-well microplate containing lysis buffer and RNase inhibitors (Wardemann et al., 2003) . Unbiased IgV RT-PCR was then performed as described in the Materials and Methods. Since clinical tests had revealed subject LDU 125 to have elevated serum RF, a serum monoclonal IgM\u03ba gammopathy, and an expansion of IgM + \u03ba + peripheral B cells, we performed IgM-and Ig\u03baspecific PCR (primers listed in Table 1 ). After the first and second rounds of PCR, 58% and 52% of the wells had size-appropriate products for IgV\u03bc and IgV\u03ba, respectively. Paired IgH and IgL products from the same individual cells were TA-cloned and sent for sequencing (Table 3) . A majority of clones A4-H10 had very similar IgVH and IgVL, with the same complementarity determining region 3 (CDR3) sequences, whereas there was considerably more variability among clones NA6-NH5. Note that G6 + cells were sorted into one plate (wells A1-H12) based upon expression of FCRL4, and were sorted into another plate (wells NA1-NH12) based upon absence of FCRL4 expression. Overall, 26/32 clones were VH1-69; 24 of these were also DH3-22/JH4 + , and 25/26 were V\u03ba3-20 + . Three clones were VH3-07 + , and one clone each was VH3-11 + , VH3-48 + , or VH3-72 + . Consistent with our earlier report (Charles et al., 2008) , the majority (25/26) of the VH1-69 + clones had IgVH mutations; with four exceptions, all clones had 3 or fewer non-synonymous mutations.

IgM yields after 6 days of culture typically ranged from 5-20 \u03bcg/ml of supernatant. Before and after concentration via centrifugal filtration through 100 kDa molecular weight cutoff membranes, we calculated IgM concentration by ELISA. We then used gel filtration chromatography to verify that the size of the cloned, concentrated IgM approximated that of IgM isolated from human serum. Figure 3A shows that the elution peaks of human IgM, human IgG, and bovine serum albumin corresponded to 37-42 ml, 57-67 ml, and 67-75. respectively. The elution profile of cloned CBH5 IgM revealed major peaks at 32-37 ml and 37-42 ml, as well as smaller peaks at 62-72 ml and 78-82 ml.

Clones E3, E5, and H5 demonstrated substantial binding to IgG 1 , with decreased avidities for IgG 2 and IgG 4 , and markedly decreased avidities for IgG 3 , consistent with earlier reports regarding isotype specificities of certain RF subclasses (Normansell, 1975; Bonagura et al., 1998) . The IgG isotype specificity pattern of these mAbs mirrored that seen in the serum of subject LDU 125 (Fig. 5E) , suggesting that the cloned mAbs are a physiological reflection of circulating RF found in this patient in vivo. Finally, we used ELISA to confirm that the cloned IgM could be recognized by the G6 mAb (Fig. 5F ). G6 bound to the VH1-69-encoded LDU 125 A4 clone, but not to the VH4-39encoded mGO clone.",

In particular, the expression of IgM RF + B cells' mAb as IgM, instead of IgG 1 , offers the potential advantage of an improved physiologic assessment of these mAbs' reactivities. Modestly hypermutated RF typically has low to moderate affinity for its target antigen, IgG Fc, and the decavalent stoichometry of pentameric IgM confers a substantial increase in avidity. Supporting this, it has been shown that the binding of a lowaffinity mouse IgG 2a anti-RBC autoantibody is enhanced > 1000 fold when expressed as an IgM, compared to IgG 2a , isotype (Fossati-Jimack et al., 1999) . Thus, our method may prove to be most beneficial in the determination of the reactivity patterns of polyspecific, lowaffinity IgMs. Our procedure can easily be adapted for the analysis of RF expressing non-G6 cross-reactive epitopes, synthesis of germline IgVH and IgVL mAbs (described in (Tiller et al., 2008) ), cloning of mAbs from class-switched B cells, or expression of VH1-69-encoded mAbs as IgG 1 .",
