Although known for over 25 years, this phenomenon is only now beginning to be understood in molecular terms. Indeed, recent immunological, biochemical, and molecular biological developments have led to precise understanding of the structures and functions of the human major histocompatibility complex (MHC). This knowledge is prerequisite in evaluating the genetic and somatic aspects of the role of the HLA complex in the physiology of the immune response and their contribution to autoimmunity. The most significant initial observation has been an increase in the frequency of certain serologically defined alleles of the HLA complex in several autoimmune diseases.",

Indeed, the epi- tope recognized by an antibody can be present on the class I1 molecule involved in the susceptibility, while also present on a distinct molecule irrelevant to the disease. Assignment of the antibody specificity to disease susceptibility could only be allowed in the case of recombination between two genes. Such recombination is rarely found within a homogeneous population and is more frequently found between different ethnic groups. This explains the interest in studying HLA and disease associations in these groups.",

Moreover, since serological reagents were selected through allorecognition, they are not necessarily suitable for detecting disease susceptibility epitopes. HLA serological typing thus may presently represent a rather incomplete approach to typing for HLA disease associations. New serological reagents are being developed to circumvent these difficulties.

Site-directed mutagenesis of the class I1 molecule or immunization with synthetic peptides should generate antibodies uniquely directed toward discrete sequences of the class I1 product (i.e., disease-specific epitope) (Atar et al., 1989) . This approach would not only be invaluable for epidemiological studies, but should be ultimately considered for epitope-specific therapy. This approach is particularly pertinent in the case of hybrid determinants (i.e., determinants created by the formation of particular a-P heterodimers, as discussed below) for which no serological reagent is available. Apart from serology for the detection of cell surface-expressed (thus, conformational) epitopes, several molecular methods have been developed and have been widely used in HLA typing over the past 10 years. They include analysis of the polymorphism at either the protein or DNA level and therefore largely reflect linear amino acid or nucleic acid sequences. My purpose is not to review these approaches in detail, but to highlight some of their characteristics and the implications for HLA and disease association.",

            "text": "Biochemical typing, which includes one-dimensional isoelectrofocusing (IEF) and two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE), usually requires radioactive cell labeling and immunoprecipita-tion with specific mAb's), steps which are both time consuming and expensive. Two-dimensional PAGE at least has proven to be highly efficient in detecting new HLA class I1 variants (Fig. 3) . Furthermore, it represents the best technique for definition of the reactivity of mAb's in association, eventually, with immunodetection by Western blotting of their individual chains or complex reactivity. The first dimension (of a two-dimensional PAGE) can be nonequilibrium pH gradient electrophoresis or IEF, which provides better resolution of the class I1 fl and a chains, respectively. Since our initial description of the DR fl chain polymorphism, two-dimensional PAGE has been widely used to identify molecular variants belonging to DR2, DR4, DR5, DRw6, DR7, and DRw52. So far, this is one of the best typing procedures for the identification of DQ a and DP a variants, with eight and two alleles, respectively McDevitt, 1979, 1980; Knowles, 1989; Charron and Fernandez, 1990) . The theoretical limitation is that in some instances conservative amino acid substitution will not be detected electrophoretically and thus will not be resolved by two-dimensional PAGE. In practice, this appears to be very rare. Further, in the case in which the initial (i.e., most basic) location of two different alleles is electrophoretically indistinguishable, the more processed forms (more acidic locations) are distinct. This reflects the fact that, although the net charges of two molecules may be similar, the type and the variety of amino acids which compose the molecule do, in fact, slightly affect their electrophoretic migration. This is clearly the case when the DR /3l chains from DR1 and DRw9 cells are analyzed (R. Fauchet and D. Charron, unpublished observations) . In contrast, limited substitution (e.g., point mutation) at the genomic level may induce drastic changes in the net charge and variants, which are silent by genomic analysis [restriction fragment-length polymorphism (RFLP) ] but are readily distinct by two-dimensional PAGE as in the case of DR-BON versus DRBl gene products (Coppin et al., 1987) .",

In addition to the number of class I1 a-P loci combined two by two within a haplotype to form isotypes, a powerful way to increase class I1 antigen diversity would be the association of the a and p chains of the two haplotypes by tramcomplementation within an isotype. These molecules are found only in heterozygous individuals. An even more efficient way of generating additional diversity would be to pair a and p chains from different isotypes either in cis and/or tram.

Thirty hypothetical dimers which could arise as a result of the various combinations between five DQ a and six DQ p chains were considered, but only 20 dimers were observed experimentally. Whether the absence of a given a-/3 combination is due to the inability to associate (i.e., forbidden a-p pairing) or whether the population studies are, as yet, insufficiently extensive to include all possible combinations is unresolved. Indeed, because of strong linkage disequilibrium between alleles of the DR and DQ loci, certain combinations of alleles predominate in a given population. Different combinations of genes which would generate czsderived hybrid molecules are most likely to be found in different populations. Natural hybrid molecules thus represent minor variant haplotypes. It is likely that these \"natural\" hybrid DQ molecules evolved by recombination between two distinct (heterozygous) haplotypes and were then fixed. This type of data argues in favor of a recombination \"hot spot\" between DQ a and p chains (Song et al., 1987) and justifies a search for sequences facilitating recombination events, as have been described in the mouse I region (Steinmetz et al., 1986; Smith et al., 1981) .",

INTERISOTYPIC HYBRID HLA CLASS I1 MOLECULES It has been suggested that, due to a presumed higher affinity between the a and /3 chains when they are coded for by loci of the same isotype, the expression of class I1 dimers will occur only within one isotype. Isotypemismatched molecules were therefore considered forbidden pairs and were not expected to be found at the surface of normal cells (Travers et al., 1984) . A series of laboratory experiments using normal Epstein-Barr virus-transformed human B cell lines provides direct evidence for the assembly and the cell surface expression of mixed isotypes consisting of DR a and DQ p chains. Quantitation of the isotype-mismatched dimers versus the conventional class I1 dimers using immunoprecipitation of labeled cell lysates is not precise. It appears, nonetheless, that DR a is associated with DQ /? than with DR p and, similarly, less DQ p is associated with DR a than with DQ a.",

The 109 D6 serological epitope may therefore reflect a common class I1 structure present on both DRw53 p and DRwlO / 3 chains (Winchester and Gregersen, 1988) . MC1' and 109 D6' individuals may be more closely related than was previously thought. Although MCl is not present on DRw53 (since DR7 individuals are MC1-), the DRw53 sequence (amino acids 65-73) is identical to the one found in the DRw 10 p 1 chains, while some DRw10 individuals belong to the MCl' group (Merryman et al., 1988; Carpenter et al., 1988) . This suggests that among DRwlO individuals there is some heterogeneity interconverting 109 D6 and MC1.

The concept of molecular mimicry was logically proposed based on the assumption that an environmentally provided antigen could exist which would induce T cell recognition of the previously defined disease susceptibility epitope.

The most relevant finding is an aberrantly high expression on the synovial tissue, in particular, on the adherent synovial lining cells of the HLA class I1 species.

The importance of the RFLP data was strengthened by a perfect correlation of these fragments with a DQ p chain profile, as assessed by two-dimensional PAGE (Kim et al., 1985) . Moreover, it linked the putative susceptibility epitope on the DQ p molecule of a given type (DQw8 or DQw3.2).

A dramatically increased relative risk was further demonstrated for individuals possessing a particular heterozygous combination of HLA class I1 antigens, namely, DR3-DR4. This prompted a search for the class I1 molecule inducing the most susceptibility. Since the DR ct chain is monomorphic, it cannot therefore contribute to the heterozygous effect. The discovery that both Q and p chains of the DQ molecules were polymorphic led to the ideas that the formation of hybrid class I1 molecules obtained by trans-complementations could oc-cur and that those molecules present only in heterozygous individuals will fulfill the requirement imposed to explain the heterozygous effect (similar to an FI effect in animal genetics) (Svejgaard et al., 1983; Charron et al., 1984) . Ultimately, these ideas support the concepts that it is more the structural three-dimensional conformation than an individual sequence which is the likely genuine disease susceptibility element and that several distinct amino acids can contribute to its formation.

In a series of 92 IDDM patients from Norway, an increased risk was found among DR4-DRw8 heterozygotic individuals, similar to that seen for DR3-DR4 heterozygotes. By RFLP and AS0 typing, the DR4-DRw8 patients appear to bear the DR4-DQw8/DRw8-DQw4 haplotypes in eight of nine. This suggests that the two distinct combinations of haplotypes D R~-D Q w~/ D R~-D Q w~ and DR4-DQwNDRw8-DQw4 share an equivalent DQ a-P conformation encoded in trans. Interestingly, DQw4 has an Asp57 of its DQP chain, and thus the DQw4-DQw8 heterozygotic individuals do not have two Asp57negative DQ p l alleles. In these cases Asp57 DQ p is not protective as in DR7 (and DRw9) haplotypes appear to confer disease susceptibility in blacks that contrasts with a neutral effect of DR7 found in Caucasians. Todd et al. (1988b) analyzed the DQ a and p chains found in these black haplotypes. While the sequences of the amino-terminal domain of the DR p chains (pl and p4) and DQ were identical in black and Caucasian DR7-DQw2 haplotypes, a difference was found in the DQ a chain. The black DQA 1 allele was identical to the DQA 1 allele found on DR4 Caucasian haplotypes. Thus, replacement of the DR7-DQA l allele (present in DR7 Caucasians) by a DR4-DQAl allele (present in DR7 blacks) appears to be sufficient to switch from a neutral to a susceptible haplotype for IDDM.",

These experiments provided some unexpected results. Mice were made transgenic using constructs containing the insulin promoter gene and class I1 a and p chains. It was anticipated that these animals would only differ from nontransgenic animals by the expression of class I1 in pancreatic islet /3 cells. This was indeed the case (Lo et al., 1988; Sarvetnick et al., 1988) . Moreover, diabetes results in almost all of the animals. However, one of the most unexpected findings was the absence of an inflammatory infiltrate surrounding the islet cells (noticeably T cells). This may be consistent with the incapacity of these cells to actually function as antigen-presenting cells. Thus, class I1 expression does not appear to be capable, by itself, of inducing autoimmune destruction of the islet /3 cells. However, the islet cells were altered and progressively disappeared. The decrease in insulin secretion and subsequent cell death observed in the p cells of these transgenic animals in the absence of T cell infiltration are puzzling, as is the observation that similar transgenic animals with class I genes, as well as with class I1 genes, became diabetic (Allison et al., 1986) .",

Using Sepharose-conjugated anti-HLA class I1 antibodies, we were able to directly activate human B cells via a secondary messenger pathway involving calcium flux, phospholipase C metabolism, and protein kinase C activation (Mooney and Charron, 1988; Mooney et al., 1989) . Stimulation of interleukin 1 synthesis and release by the B cell were also observed. I suggest that such a role for class 11 molecule may well be relevant to the observation made in the transgenic mice and subsequently to the pathophysiology of IDDM. Indeed, hyperexpression of HLA class I1 on pancreatic islet p cells, once established, may alter the cellular biology of the islet cells and transduce activation signals contributing directly or indirectly to cellular destruction (via interleukin 1 or via the release of other cytotoxic agents). Such a hypothesis accommodates the different possibilities of HLA class 11 induction on the p islet cells (e.g., direct infection of the p cells, release of the cytokines, and gene transfer) and does not require any primary immunological event and effector.",

Taking into account the molecular composition of the DR2-DRw 15 and DR2-DRw 16 haplotypes and comparing them with the sequences of the other positively and negatively associated haplotypes, Todd et al.

The presence of an aspartic acid residue at this position would therefore explain the protective effect of most DR2 haplotypes.

An RFLP study of patients with MS from Northern Ireland and Scotland mentions a polymorphism of the DQ a gene (DQa-MSp1 3.25-kb fragment) which was found in increased frequency in DR2 MS patients (Heard et al., 1989) . Since this polymorphism appears to be allelic to the DQw1.2 a usually found in DR2-Dw2 haplotypes, it is likely that in the cells of MS patients who are DR2-Dw2 DQw1.2, the new DQ a fragment is contributed by the other haplotype.

The First International Symposium on HLA and Disease was held in Paris in 1976 (Dausset and Svejgaard, 1976) and was an essential contribution, drawing the attention of the medical and scientific community to the importance of the HLA system in disease and stimulating further research. At the time the genetics and statistics provided the hard data, while the immunology was speculative. The situation was confused, but McDevitt (1976) stated that the \"future prospects seemed bright\" in his concluding remarks and requested more precise typing techniques, while foreseeing mapping of the Ir genes and an unraveling of their structure: \"Availability of such typing techniques will probably result in the detection of very strong associations between particular alleles of genes in the HLA-D region and particular diseases.\" Indeed, the prediction is now superbly fulfilled. Clearly, the HLA class I1 molecules involved in disease susceptibility have a normal structure and may be found in the normal population, although at a lower frequency. The data reviewed here support the concept that the disease susceptibility element is composed of amino acids (contiguous and/or distantly spaced on the same chain, or on different chains of the same or a distinct class I1 isotype) which delineate a specific three-dimensional conformation. It is suggested that it is more the conformational epitope created than the linear stretch of amino acids which is important (Fig. 7) .",

In conjunction with the fact that HLA class I1 molecules are a-P dimers capable of forming hybrid molecules (intra-or interisotypic) by CZSand/or tram-complementation, this provides an ideal structural framework for the localization of the conformational disease susceptibility epitope(s). T h e capacity of the conformational epitope to bind within a high-affinity range set of defined peptides varies, presumably according to the polymorphism of the epitope (Buus et al., 1987) . Whether it is always the same conformation of the class I1 molecule or a slightly different, but equivalent, structure which is involved in one disease is unknown.",

Many peptides (but not all) are likely to bind to the disease susceptibility element. This questions the nature of the antigen involved in disease susceptiblity in autoimmunity. There is no obvious reason to exclude that the antigen itself has some degree of polymorphism, as it binds to the appropriate disease-specific conformational epitope with sufficient affinity and is able to induce T cell activation.",

The MHC molecule in itself may provide a molecular tool in this search, since the antigen can be defined through its complementary conformational interactions with the class I1 molecule. Candidate peptides are presently being tested for their ability to bind class I1 disease susceptibility elements. The TcR represents the third partner of the functional trimolecular complex involved in the control of the immune response. Already in animal models of autoimmunity (e.g., experimental allergic encephalomyelitis), experimental evidence for a selection of the T cell diversity gives support to the idea that the T cell repertoire is important (Acha-Orbea et al., 1988) . It is, however, unknown whether this reflects a secondary state or precedes and induces the disease. The T cell repertoire is the result of germ-line diversity, followed by thymic selection.",

However, this process may require specific amounts of any class I 1 molecule and sufficient duration of expression of a particular class I1 molecule in order to efficiently result in a full depletion of autoreactive T cells (self-MHC). Hybrid molecules may be expressed at a lower level than regular class I1 species and their expression may not be as equally constant as the typical a-p isotypes. n 0 z n n a a cy I g n n a n Recent data from mice and preliminary results from this laboratory in humans suggest that there are favored a-p associations, while some are almost totally forbidden. This is determined by the affinity of different p chains for a given a chain. The end result may be that autoreactive T cells specific for class I1 hybrid molecules may not be totally depleted in all individuals. This may also depend on the local presence of lymphokines in the thymus during the selection process. The TcR repertoire would thus vary in different individuals, more susceptible individuals possessing a small amount of autoreactive T cells specific for the HLA class I1 hybrid molecule. This offers a tentative explanation for the concordance rate in twins, which is, at most, 50% in the HLA-associated diseases.",
