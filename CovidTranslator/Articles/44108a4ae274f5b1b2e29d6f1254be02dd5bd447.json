A particularly interesting candidate is AAV8, which can efficiently and rapidly transduce a wide range of tissues in vivo. To further unravel the mechanisms behind AAV8 transduction, we used yeast twohybrid analyses to screen a mouse liver complementary DNA library for cellular proteins capable of interacting with the viral capsid proteins. In total, we recovered approximately 700 clones, comprising over 300 independent genes. Sequence analyses revealed multiple hits for over 100 genes, including two encoding the endosomal cysteine proteases cathepsins B and L. Notably, these two proteases also physically interacted with the corresponding portion of the AAV2 capsid in yeast, but not with AAV5. We demonstrate that cathepsins B and L are essential for efficient AAV2-and AAV8-mediated transduction of mammalian cells, and document the ability of purified cathepsin B and L proteins to bind and cleave intact AAV2 and AAV8 particles in vitro. These data suggest that cathepsinmediated cleavage could prime AAV capsids for subsequent nuclear uncoating, and indicate that analysis of additional genes recovered in our screen may help to further elucidate the mechanisms behind transduction by AAV8 and related serotypes.",

            "text": "A Two-hybrid Screen Identifies Cathepsins B and L as Uncoating Factors for Adeno-associated Virus 2 and 8 INTRODUCTION Adeno-associated virus is a non-pathogenic virus belonging to the parvovirus family, which also includes canine parvovirus, minute virus of mice, and the human B19 virus. 1 However, AAV is distinguished from other family members, in that it is a dependovirus, able to replicate and produce viral particles only in the presence of a helper virus such as adenovirus. AAV particles are composed of a 4.7 kb single-stranded DNA genome enclosed within a non-enveloped icosahedral capsid of about 20 nm in diameter. Sixty subunits of the structural capsid proteins, VP1, VP2, and VP3, assemble at a 1:1:10 ratio to form the intact viral capsid. 2 Vectors derived from AAV are particularly powerful and promising tools for human gene transfer, owing to their high safety (the vectors are devoid of wild-type genes, and integrate at low frequency, if at all) and their ability to mediate sustained gene expression in various cell types. Recently, the usefulness of AAV vectors has been further enhanced with the isolation of over 100 novel AAV serotypes. 3, 4 Encapsidation of recombinant AAV genomes with these viral variants typically results in vector particles characterized by distinct tissue tropism and immunological profiles. An outstanding example is provided by AAV8, a serotype isolated from rhesus monkey. As shown by a recent plethora of reports, vectors pseudotyped with AAV8 can mediate unusually robust and sustained transgene expression in numerous tissues, including the liver, heart, and skeletal muscle. [5] [6] [7] In particular, AAV8 can yield up to 20-fold higher transduction levels in the liver than the AAV prototype-2, despite an 83% amino-acid homology between the two capsids. 6 It is not surprising that AAV8 is currently gaining increasing popularity as a vector for the in vivo transduction of multiple tissues and species, and is being considered for clinical evaluation in humans.",

            "text": "However, despite the growing interest in this particular AAV serotype, little is known about its mechanism of transduction. In fact, most of the insight into the various steps of cellular AAV infection stems from studies conducted with the AAV family prototype, AAV2. The initial step typically involves attachment to the cell surface via binding to one or more primary or secondary receptor molecules. For AAV2, these are heparan sulfate proteoglycans, aVb5 integrin , and the fibroblast or hepatocyte growth factor receptors. [8] [9] [10] [11] In contrast, AAV5 preferentially attaches to cells by binding to sialic acid and the platelet-derived growth factor receptor, 12, 13 explaining the distinct tissue tropisms displayed by this serotype. Binding of AAV2 to the cell surface also appears to activate intracellular signaling pathways, which subsequently trigger internalization of the virus by receptor-mediated endocytosis. Rac1, a small GTPbinding protein, is a key player in this process, as its activity is essential to virus uptake into the cell. 14 Subsequent to cell entry, the AAV2 particle proceeds to the endosomal compartment, where it can traffic to either the late or recycling endosomes. Two factors influencing the localization of the particles within the different endosomal subcompartments are the viral dose administered and the cell type. 15, 16 In contrast to AAV2, AAV5 has been reported to accumulate in the Golgi compartment following its endocytosis from the cell surface, 17 suggesting that AAV serotypes can utilize distinct transduction pathways. AAV2 trafficking to the endosome is a critical step, as particles injected directly into the cytoplasm do not express their viral genomes. 18 In addition, treatments that block acidification of the endosomal compartment cause a significant decrease in AAV2 transduction. 16 Collectively, these studies suggest that proper AAV endosomal processing may serve to ''prime'' the viral capsid for downstream steps, such as nuclear transport and/or uncoating of the virions.",

            "text": "Following endosomal escape, AAV2 particles travel to the perinuclear compartment, a step probably facilitated by an ATPdependent molecular motor. 19 The ubiquitin-proteasome pathway appears to be involved in the uncoating and/or nuclear translocation of AAV, as ubiquitination of the capsid proteins of both AAV2 and AAV5 was reported, as was the fact that proteasome inhibitors enhance nuclear AAV uptake. [20] [21] [22] Inside the nucleus, AAV eventually uncoats to release its genome and allow its subsequent transcription and replication. In the case of AAV2, this process is slow and inefficient, and is probably one of the major limiting factors for transduction by recombinant AAV2. In contrast, AAV8 virions uncoat much more rapidly, likely explaining their very robust transduction efficiency. 23 To further our understanding of the mechanisms behind AAV8 transduction, we conducted a yeast two-hybrid screen for host cellular proteins that are able to physically interact with AAV8 capsid proteins. Here, we report the identification of over 100 respective candidates, including two particularly interesting clones encoding the endosomal cysteine proteases cathepsins B and L. Using cathepsin-specific inhibitors, we were able to show that their activities are important for AAV8 transduction of mammalian cells, and that they play a similar role in AAV2. Moreover, in in vitro assays, we found that both cathepsins bound to and cleaved the capsids of either serotype, creating a virus-specific restriction pattern. These data suggest that cathepsins B and L are involved in the differential endosomal processing of AAV2 and AAV8, and that they may prime the virions for subsequent nuclear disassembly as a prerequisite for transgene expression.",

We fused the Gal4p DNA-binding domain to portions of the AAV8 capsid homologous to regions of the AAV2 capsid that contain most of the exposed residues. The resulting bait (encoding residues 147-623 of the AAV8 VP1 capsid protein) was used to screen a mouse liver cDNA-Gal4p activation domain library under highly stringent conditions, requiring the activation of two different Gal4p-binding-dependent reporter genes (ade2 and his3). Sufficient yeast cells were transformed with both the bait and library (containing an estimated 3.5 million clones) plasmids to provide a 1.5-fold coverage of the library. We recovered 700 clones capable of activating both reporter genes, allowing the cells to grow on the selection media ( Figure 1 ). Sequence analyses of the plasmid DNA from these clones revealed the identity of 313 different genes. Among these, 108 were repeatedly recovered from multiple independent colonies (listed in Table 1 ), suggesting that their interaction with the AAV8 bait was strong and genuine. The proteins encoded by these 108 genes belonged to a wide range of protein classes ( Figure 2 ), including plasma membrane proteins (potentially acting as viral receptors on the cell surface) and proteases, which could theoretically contribute to viral uncoating during AAV cellular transduction. In fact, two particularly interesting candidates recovered in our screen were cathepsins B and L, endosomal proteins previously implicated in the uncoating of numerous other viruses, such as Ebola and reovirus. 24, 25 As AAV transduction depends on virus trafficking through the endosome, we decided to further investigate the potential role of these two cathepsins in this step of the AAV life cycle.",

As shown in Figure 3 , the activity of the recovered clones with the AAV8 bait was significantly higher (three-to seven-fold) as compared to the empty control, confirming that the interaction between these independent protein domains was indeed specific. Interestingly, the AAV2 bait was also able to interact with each of the candidate preys, a result that was not surprising in the light of the large sequence similarity between the AAV2 and AAV8 capsids. In contrast to both AAV2 and AAV8, reporter gene activation with the AAV5-based capsid bait was not significantly different from the empty plasmid control for most of the tested clones, including the cathepsin-encoding preys.",

This result was further validated using a series of control experiments. Firstly, when the assay was conducted with AAV5(gfp), we only observed a decrease in vector transduction at a high dose of inhibitor (40 mM). This apparent inhibitory effect was most likely nonspecific as the use of a lower inhibitor dose (20 mM) actually resulted in a slight increase in AAV5(gfp) transduction. Secondly, when we transfected cells with a plasmid expressing a destabilized GFP protein (with a half-life of 2 h) before Ca074-Me treatment, we likewise observed a marginal increase in the number of GFP-positive cells, ruling out inhibitory effects on gene expression from the drug per se. Thirdly, when we tested the non-cell-permeable version of the drug, Ca074, as well as the cathepsin L inhibitor Z-Phe-Tyr(t-Bu)-diazomethyl ketone, we found no significant change in transduction efficiency by the AAV2 and AAV8 vectors (data not shown).

Importantly, the specificity of this cleavage was confirmed with the cathepsin S negative control, where VP3 levels remained stable under otherwise identical experimental conditions. Moreover, addition of the Ca074-Me cathepsin inhibitor to the reaction abolished AAV capsid cleavage by cathepsin B or L, confirming that their activity was responsible for the observed digestion (Figure 5b) .

            "text": "Cathepsin cleavage patterns are AAV serotype specific Although cathepsins B and L generated similar cleavage products within a given AAV serotype (2 or 8), we observed that the exact peptide pattern differed between the two viral isolates. To analyze this phenomenon in more detail, we resolved the digested capsid proteins on a high-percentage (12.5%) polyacrylamide gel. This was followed by immunoblotting with two distinct antibodies, allowing us to differentiate between C-terminal peptide fragments and the more upstream cleavage products. We found that the AAV8 capsid was digested into two fragments of approximately 35 and 27 kDa in size, with the upper band being the C-terminal fragment, as evidenced by its recognition by the B1 antibody (which binds an epitope found in the VP3 C-terminus) (Figure 5c ). In contrast, AAV2 particle digestion resulted in three predominant bands with sizes of approximately 50, 30, and 13 kDa, as detected by the polyclonal a-VP1,2,3 serum. Additionally, we noted a fourth band of around 20 kDa upon overexposure of the blot (as it was fainter than the other bands, we hypothesize that this polypeptide contained fewer epitopes bound by the polyclonal antibody). Interestingly, upon overexposure of the blots, the undigested AAV2 and AAV8 samples also displayed trace amounts of the same cleavage products. One possible explanation for this observation is that the purified AAV vectors contain a small sub-population of viral capsids that had been processed by cellular cathepsins before purification. As the sum of the AAV2 cleavage product bands exceeded the size of the full-length AAV2 VP3 protein (63 kDa), we reasoned that one or more of them probably represented a partial cleavage product. Indeed, subsequent immunoblotting with the B1 antibody revealed that only the smallest 13 kDa peptide contained the C-terminal B1 epitope, suggesting that together with the N-terminal 50 kDa product it formed the fulllength VP3 protein. We, moreover, hypothesized that the two intermediate bands of 30 and 20 kDa detected with the polyclonal antibody resulted from secondary cleavage of the large 50 kDa fragment, especially as none of these three bands was recognized by the B1 antibody. Accordingly, the presence of a substantial amount of the 50 kDa precursor peptide would indicate that this particular reaction occurs inefficiently, or that this cleavage site is only accessible on a subset of all VP3 subunits within the assembled AAV2 capsid. In contrast to this apparent two-step cleavage process for AAV2, our finding of only two bands for AAV8, whose sizes add up to full-length VP3, suggests that this particular serotype is cleaved only once and more efficiently than AAV2. This idea was indeed confirmed when the cleavage rates of the two vectors were compared, by partially digesting them with increasing amounts of cathepsin B. Intriguingly, AAV8 VP3 levels were reduced more readily than those of AAV2 when both were incubated with the same amount of enzyme, further indicating that AAV8 capsid cleavage may be more efficient than that of AAV2 ( Figure 5d ). As will be discussed below, the differential cleavage rates and patterns could explain some of the differences in the transduction rate and kinetics seen with AAV2 and AAV8.",

We thus sought to investigate how cathepsin cleavage affected the stability of the AAV capsid, by assessing the ability of different monoclonal antibodies to bind either digested or undigested virions. To this end, AAV particles of serotypes 2 or 8 were incubated with cathepsin B as indicated above, and then transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane under nondenaturing conditions. As a control, we included undigested viral samples that were incubated at 751C, based on previous reports that this treatment triggers dissociation of the AAV2 capsid. 28 The particles were then detected by immunoblotting with either the B1 or A20 antibodies. The former binds an epitope in the C-terminus of VP3 that is inaccessible in assembled capsids, but becomes available for binding once the capsid proteins dissociate. In contrast, the A20 antibody solely binds to intact AAV2 capsids, as its three-dimensional epitope is disrupted once the subunit proteins disassemble. Interestingly, we did not observe any differences between the digested and undigested samples with the B1 antibody, as a very minimal amount of protein was recognized in both cases ( Figure 6 ). Consistent with this result, we obtained a strong signal for both AAV2 samples with the A20 antibody, whose specificity for intact particles was confirmed by its lack of reaction with the heatdenatured particles. There was only a slight decrease in the A20 signal intensity for the digested sample, perhaps owing to a change in the virion confirmation upon cathepsin cleavage of the individual capsid proteins. Moreover, we observed that upon addition to cultured cells, digested AAV2 and AAV8(gfp) vectors displayed similar or even slightly higher transduction efficiencies as compared to undigested particles (data not shown). Collectively, these data strongly suggest that AAV particles remain intact after cathepsin cleavage. This supports the idea that this process does not lead to capsid dissociation, but is rather a prerequisite for efficient downstream processing of the virions.",

            "text": "This study was performed to better understand the transduction mechanism of AAV8, an AAV serotype currently in preclinical development for use in human gene therapy. A key component of AAV transduction is the ability of the AAV capsid to interact with specific host proteins that enable the proper uptake, trafficking, and uncoating of the virus. To date, only a small number of these host proteins were identified, and only for individual serotypes (excluding AAV8), leaving us with a limited understanding of the mechanisms behind AAV transduction. The yeast two-hybrid screen described in this report identified a number of proteins capable of directly interacting with portions of the AAV8 capsid, which should help to shed light on the complex processes leading to AAV gene expression. Several previous studies indicated that endosomal processing is necessary for transduction by the AAV family prototype, AAV2, whose capsid protein sequence is highly homologous to AAV8. Interestingly, our screen recovered two endosomal proteases, cathepsins B and L, which either alone or in tandem act as uncoating factors for a number of other viruses, such as reovirus, SARS coronavirus, hepatitis B, Ebola, Nipah, and Hendra. 24, 25, [29] [30] [31] [32] In this report, we show that these cathepsins appear to play a similar role in AAV8 and AAV2, by demonstrating that both proteases can bind to and cleave their capsids, and that their activity is important for efficient cellular transduction by both serotypes. Our results also indicate a possible redundancy in function by these two proteases, as both cleaved the capsid proteins of a given serotype similarly. Moreover, cellular transduction was reduced by a cathepsin inhibitor that is able to inhibit both cathepsins B and L efficiently. Furthermore, our assays showed that AAV5-mediated cellular transduction is not only independent of these proteins, but the AAV5 capsid is neither bound nor cleaved by the cathepsins. A higher dose of the Ca074-Me inhibitor diminished transduction by AAV5, but its inhibition profile was clearly distinct from that of AAV2 and AAV8. Ca074-Me is a cathepsin B inhibitor at low doses and was reported to inhibit cathepsin L upon dosage escalation. 25 This suggests that another cellular protease important for AAV5 transduction was also inhibited at the tested higher dose. Clearly, AAV5's mechanism of transduction differs from that of AAV2 and AAV8, which are more closely related to each other and both seem to depend on cathepsins B and L for efficient gene expression.",

The AAV8 capsid protein appears to be cleaved efficiently at a single site close to the center of the VP3 protein, whereas the AAV2 VP3 has two distinct cleavage sites. The C-terminal site is cleaved more efficiently in our assay than the more N-terminal site, resulting in a partially digested capsid fragment. Even when 10-fold less AAV2 virions were incubated with the same amount of enzyme, the 50 kDa precursor fragment was still readily visible upon Western blot analyses (data not shown).

It is possible that only a subset of the internalized particles gets cleaved by cathepsins B and L, whereas the remainder are processed by a different set of proteins, or not at all. In a previous study, it was reported that although AAV2 particles traffic through late endosomes in both HEK-293 and NIH-3T3 cells, they do so to a much lesser degree in the latter (partly explaining why they are less permissive for AAV2 infection). 16 Perhaps in more permissive cell lines where the AAV particles traffic more frequently to the late endosome, the capsids are cleaved even more efficiently by the cathepsins because of their increased colocalization in the endosomal compartment. In addition, Ding et al. 15 reported that particles shuttled to the recycling endosome are more competent for transgene expression on a per genome basis than those in the late endosome. The authors speculated that this is due to more efficient processing in the recycling endosome. As cathepsins B and L have not been reported to be present in this compartment so far, AAV particles may be processed by other proteases or ubiquitin-associated proteins present in this subcompartment. Other proteases recovered in our screen are potential candidates for this activity ( Table 1) , perhaps acting synergistically with the cathepsins, or in an independent and compartment-specific fashion.",

As our screen was conducted in a yeast system, it is unlikely that all of the recovered genes would bind the intact virus in a mammalian cellular setting. However, using a number of independent assays, we showed that this screen accurately predicted the ability of the AAV8 capsid to bind some of these proteins. This convinces us that further analysis of the other recovered clones is clearly warranted. Although this study focused only on proteins involved in AAV transduction, it is easy to envision how various other proteins could interact with the AAV capsid and thereby influence many additional processes relevant to AAV biology, such as the regulation of capsid synthesis, viral replication, and/or viral transmission. In addition, as other members of the parvovirus family share many similarities to AAV, some of the proteins identified in our screen may also be important for their normal function. Further analysis of these proteins might ultimately provide valuable insights into the treatment of viruses such as the pathogenic B19 virus, whose infection can lead to fetal loss in pregnant women, and can cause severe anemia in immuno-compromised individuals. 36 In summary, we have furthered our understanding of AAV8 transduction by identifying a number of candidate host cell proteins that can interact with its capsid. We have revealed the importance of several of these proteins in AAV8-and AAV2mediated transduction. Further study into the role of these and the other recovered clones in the AAV8 life cycle may have important implications for the use of this powerful gene transfer vector.",

(a) Portions of the AAV8 capsid were fused to the Gal4 DNA-binding domain and used as bait to screen prey encoding a mouse liver cDNA library fused to the Gal4 activation domain. The three reporter genes ade2, his3, and lacZ preceded by Gal4 binding sites (BS) were used to measure an interaction between bait and prey plasmids. (b) Yeast co-transformed with plasmids encoding the cathepsin B protease prey and the individual bait proteins were grown, serially diluted, and spotted onto media either containing or lacking adenine and histidine. The activation of both the ade2 and his3 reporter genes is necessary for growth on media lacking adenine and histidine.Molecular Therapy vol. 15 no. 2, feb. 2007",
