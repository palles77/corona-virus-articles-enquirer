            "text": "Astroviruses are enteric viruses first identified in the feces of children with diarrhea that predominantly impact the pediatric population. Detection was originally based on a five-to six-pointed star morphology of virions by electron microscopy (EM). However, only about 10% of viral particles display these structures; the remaining 90% of particles have a smooth surface and a size similar to other small, round-structured viruses like picornaviruses and caliciviruses. Thus, accurate diagnostics were difficult to obtain and determining the true prevalence of astrovirus within a population was challenging. Development of much more sensitive detection techniques like real time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), cell culture RT-PCR, and astrovirus-specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) have made detection more accurate and specific, even allowing diagnosis of specific serotypes. Utilizing these techniques, classic human astroviruses are known to be distributed worldwide and are associated with 2-9% of cases of acute, non-bacterial diarrhea in children although incidences as high as 61% have been reported. Astroviruses can also be isolated in a subset of asymptomatic individuals, suggesting that a proportion of infected individuals shed the virus asymptomatically or for some time after the resolution of other symptoms of infection. Asymptomatic carriers may be a major reservoir for astroviruses in the environment and could contribute to dissemination of the virus. The release of astroviruses into the environment is a concern due to the extreme stability of the virus. Astroviruses are resistant to inactivation by alcohols (propanol, butane, and ethanol), bleach, a variety of detergents, heat treatment including 50 C for an hour or 60 C for 5 min, and UV treatment up to 100 mJ cm \u00c02 . Human astroviruses are known to survive up to 90 days in both marine and tap water, with survival potential increasing in colder temperatures. Studies have described the isolation of infectious virus from water treatment facilities. Furthermore, astroviruses can be concentrated by filter-feeding shellfish like oysters and mussels in marine environments. Astroviruses are transmitted fecal-orally, and contaminated food and water have been linked to astrovirus outbreaks. similarities, astroviruses were originally thought to belong to either the families Picornaviridae or Caliciviridae. However, the lack of a helicase and use of a frameshifting event during replication (discussed below) distinguish astroviruses so completely that, in 1995, the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) classified astroviruses as a unique family, Astroviridae, which is now divided into two genera, Mamastrovirus and Avastrovirus. Since 2008, the number of animal hosts that have been shown to be infected with astroviruses has significantly increased comprising at least 30 mammalian and 14 new avian species increasing the complexity of classification. Originally, classification within each genus was based on the species of the host of origin. At present genera are divided into viral species or genotypes based on either the host range or genetic differences within the complete capsid sequence. On average the mean amino acid distance (p-dist) between both genera is 0.83 and within genera distances are 0.72 and 0.64 respectively. Currently, ICTV recognizes 19 species within the Mamastrovirus genus (MAstV) and 3 within the Avastrovirus (AAstV) genus but following the standardized criteria for classification, the two genera could be further divided into 33 and 11 genotype species respectively ( Figure 2 ). This complexity is likely to increase in the future given the continual isolation of new astrovirus genotypes, identification of recombinant viruses, and due to the fact that it is common to find that a single host species may be susceptible to infection with divergent astrovirus lineages. There is also increasing evidence of cross-species transmission highlighting astroviruses zoonotic potential.",

Viral infection occurs with equal frequency in boys and girls and predominantly in children under the age of 2. Infection is not restricted to young children, however, and has been noted in individuals of all ages, including immunocompetent adults and the elderly.

The classic HAstV 1-8 strains are widely recognized as a common cause of diarrhea in children, with all eight circulating globally to various levels. HAstV-1 is by far the most prevalent serotype, comprising 25-100% of astroviruses in a region, and the most prevalent reactivity of antibodies detected, although serological surveys of all serotypes have not been undertaken. HAstV-6, -7, and -8 are the least frequently detected, although three to four serotypes of HAstV are often detected in a region at any given time. The differing prevalence of serotypes could be a reflection of severity; perhaps HAstV-1 infection results in a higher frequency of hospital visits than other serotypes and is therefore overrepresented in hospital-based epidemiological studies. Alternatively, serotypes may be restricted by region. For example, one Mexican study identified HAstV-1 as the predominant serotype throughout the country, but HAstV-3 and -8 were prominent in select regions. Intriguingly, there appears to be a decrease in classic HAstV incidence in the last few decades. This could be due to differences in detection methodologies or it's possible that this could be due to displacement of classic HAstV infections by those of the novel HAstV strains.",

However, a case control study on HAstV-MLB1 and classic HAstVs in India showed that while classic HAstVs were significantly associated with diarrhea, HAstV-MLB1 was not and MLB1 titers in stool did not differ between symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals. HAstV-MLB2 viruses have also been detected in the plasma of a child with upper respiratory infection suggesting that HAstV-MLB pathogenicity may affect extra-enteric tissues and tropism may not be restricted to the gastrointestinal tract. Similarly, the HAstV-VA/HMO viruses have been detected in pediatric gastroenteritis samples from several parts of the world and serological studies suggest that HAstV-VA is a highly prevalent human infectious agent. Recent studies reported that an HAstV-VA1-like strain was detected in a patient with new-onset celiac disease and associated with extra-intestinal dissemination (including neural tissue) in immunocompromised children. Together, these findings highlight the public health need to better understand the impact of different human astrovirus genotypes in human health requires. Importantly, new diagnostic tests are desperately needed that detect all of the HAstV genotypes. Our current assays are primarily limited to detecting the classical HAstV 1-8 strains.",

The importance of this in humans is not entirely clear. In a study specifically examining co-infections, astrovirus co-infection with rotavirus increased the duration of diarrhea and vomiting over either virus alone, although whether this difference was statistically significant is unknown.

Through these studies we now know that there is remarkable genetic diversity amongst the MAstVs and AAstVs. Astroviruses have been found in association with most animals examined, although the effect of infection varies with species (see below). While astroviruses were originally identified in humans, they have since been identified in both marine and land-based, companion and a variety of mammals including mink, bat, rabbits, mice, calves, sheep, piglets, dogs, red-tailed deer, kittens, and a variety of domestic and wild avian species. Like HAstVs, there appears to be large genetic diversity amongst the other MAstV including ovine, bovine, and bat astroviruses. The best epidemiologically characterized animal astroviruses are the turkey astroviruses. Surveillance of turkey flocks in the 1980s isolated astrovirus from 78% of diseased flocks, but only 29% of normal flocks. Astroviruses were the first pathogen detected in many flocks and were most commonly detected in birds less than 4 weeks of age. Similar to human infections, turkey astrovirus was frequently isolated with other pathogens, most commonly rotavirus-like viruses. The early age of infection and the prevalence of co-infections led one group to postulate that astrovirus infection may predispose birds to infection by other viruses.",

Successful propagation of the classical HAstV 1-8 strains was originally achieved by repeated passage through primary human embryonic kidney cells; it was later discovered that direct passage through the human intestinal cell line Caco-2 would also yield infectious virus. Propagation of porcine, bovine, and chicken astroviruses has been successful in their respective host cells in vitro. However, many astroviruses still have not been adapted to propagation in vitro for unknown reasons, while others lose infectivity with subsequent passages and therefore cannot be maintained continuously. This problem has been circumvented in some systems by passing the virus through an animal system, as is the case for the turkey astrovirus, in which highly concentrated virus can be obtained from infected turkey embryos in ovo.",

Given the susceptibility of different cell lines for HAstV infection (depending on the serotype and genotype) it is possible that astroviruses use a variety of attachment proteins or receptors including carbohydrate moieties. Studies of HAstV infection in the highly permissive Caco-2 cells suggest that HAstV enters the cell via clathrin-mediated endocytosis. RNA uncoating likely occurs upon acidification and maturation of the endosome leading to release of the viral RNA into the cytoplasm where ORF1a and -1b are immediately translated by the host machinery. It has been estimated that the initial binding and virus uncoating steps takes $130 min. ORF1a is 2.8 kb and encodes a polypeptide of approximately 110 kDa. This polypeptide contains a variety of conserved motifs, including several putative transmembrane domains, a bipartite nuclear localization sequence (NLS), and a serine protease motif. The translated polypeptide is cleaved by both cellular protease(s) and the viral protease into at least five peptides. The actual function of each protein remains largely unknown. The transmembrane domains may localize to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane to facilitate replication, as all plus-strand RNA viruses have been shown to replicate in association with a membrane. One peptide, NSP1a/4, colocalizes with the viral RNA at the ER membrane; mutations in NSP1a correlate with increased viral titers in vitro and in vivo, suggesting a role for this protein in viral replication. The role for the NLS remains unclear; some reports suggest viral antigen is observed in the nucleus, while others find that it is excluded. Recent studies demonstrated that some of the non-structural proteins may undergo posttranslational modifications including phosphorylation that could modulate viral protein-protein interactions.",

This frameshifting event is unique among plus-strand animal RNA viruses and requires a highly conserved shifty heptameric sequence (A 6 C) as well as a downstream hairpin structure. This event, which occurs with frequencies up to 25% in cells, results in an ORF1a/1b fusion peptide.

Production of the capsid protein from a sgRNA not only temporally restricts capsid production to later in the viral replication cycle, but also allows for massive capsid protein expression; it is estimated that sgRNA is produced in tenfold excess of the viral genome by 12 h post infection (hpi). The sgRNA is about 2.4 kb and encodes the single structural protein of approximately 87 kDa.

Positive-sense genomes are packaged into these viral-like particles (VLPs), possibly through interactions with the first 70 amino acids of the capsid protein. The virions are released by an unknown mechanism, which may involve cellular caspases, after which the capsid undergoes an extracellular trypsin-mediated maturational cleavage. This increases infectivity up to 10 5 fold, condenses the virion to approximately 28 nm, and transforms the 79 kDa capsid protein into at least three smaller peptides of approximately 34, 29, and 26 kDa. Computational predictions suggest that VP34 may comprise the core of the virion while VP29 and VP26 form spike-like projections that may be important for viral tropism and receptor binding. This is corroborated by studies suggesting that VP26 is only loosely associated with the virion. These spikes are also thought to be responsible for the star morphology visible by EM (Figure 1(a) ).

Specific tropism of the virus for immune cells suggests that astrovirus may have an immunomodulatory role in calves. While the virus replicated in these animals and could be detected in their feces, the calves displayed no clinical signs. In most bovine studies, viral infection is asymptomatic, although changes in the feces from solid and brown to soft and yellow were noted in one study. Mild villus atrophy and slight changes in villus-to-crypt ratios have been noted but no changes in xylose absorption were observed. Despite the lack of symptoms, viral shedding continued until the termination of the experiment.",

Astrovirus-infected sheep developed a transient diarrhea as early as 2 dpi, but virus was detected at early as 14 hpi and initially confined to the lumenal tips of the intestinal villi. By 23 hpi, virus was observed coating the microvilli and infection had spread to the apical two-thirds of the villi. This correlated with sloughing of degenerate cells from the apical portion of the villi, which continued through 38 hpi. At this time, villus blunting was apparent in the ileum and midgut. Furthermore, normal epithelial cells lining the villi were replaced with immature, cuboidal cells reminiscent of crypt cells. Neither these immature cells nor crypt cells were ever observed to be infected, suggesting that only mature enterocytes are susceptible to infection. By 5 dpi, viral infection had cleared and intestinal histology had returned to normal.",

Notably, the increased barrier permeability was independent of viral replication; purified recombinant capsid protein alone was sufficient. Similar results were obtained in turkey poults administered purified recombinant turkey astrovirus type-2 capsid protein. Inoculated poults exhibited disruption of cellular tight junctions and epithelial barrier permeability and acute diarrhea suggesting that the astrovirus capsid protein may act as a novel viral enterotoxin. Although this appears to be independent of increased cell death, particular strains of HAstV have been shown to induce apoptosis late during the course of infection.

In these animals, virus could be detected from 1 to 12 dpi in the intestines. Viral replication was limited to the enterocytes on the apical portion of the villi, but the virus could be detected throughout the body, including the blood. The development of viremia is rare among enteric viruses and its function remains unclear. Infected turkeys developed a yellow, frothy, gas-filled diarrhea from 1 to 12 dpi. Diarrhea occasionally contained undigested food, but never blood. The intestines of infected birds became thin walled, flaccid, and distended. Despite these changes, histological examination suggested that only mild changes occur during infection. A mild crypt hyperplasia and shortening of the villi were noted from 4 or 5 to 9 dpi, and single degrading enterocytes could be identified. However, TUNEL staining suggested that the amount of cell death in infected intestines is similar to control birds. D-xylose absorption, a measure of intestinal absorption, was significantly decreased from 2 to 5 dpi in one study and up to 13 dpi in another. This effect was exacerbated in the presence of another enteric pathogen, turkey coronavirus. Astrovirus infection also caused a significant growth depression in turkey poults by 5 dpi; infected birds never recovered from this, leading to flock unevenness. Infected birds also demonstrated a transient (3-9 dpi) reduction of the thymus, which returned to normal by 12 dpi.",

Indeed, serological studies have indicated that approximately 50% of neonates have maternally acquired antibody to HAstV, which wane by 4-6 months of age. Children then acquire anti-HAstV antibodies rapidly due to astrovirus exposure. By the age of 9, up to 90% of the population has been exposed to HAstV-1. Furthermore, volunteer experiments demonstrate that astrovirus exposure generally leads to an increase in anti-astrovirus antibody titer. While astrovirus antibodies protected individuals from symptoms associated with infection, virus was identified in the feces, suggesting that such antibodies do not necessarily prevent viral replication. Additionally, immunoglobulin treatment has been attempted as a treatment for severe or chronic astrovirus infection. The results have been mixed and difficult to interpret, as the presence of astrovirus-specific antibodies in the immunoglobulin treatment was not always confirmed. Seroprevalence studies also showed that the vast majority of healthy young adults have antibodies against the novel HAstVs.",

However, it was noted that macrophages from TAstV-2 infected turkeys produced significantly higher levels of nitric oxide (NO) both in vivo and upon stimulation ex vivo. Inhibition of NO in vivo led to a significant increase in viral production, while addition of exogenous NO decreased viral production to below the detection limit, suggesting that NO is an important factor in controlling astrovirus infection. The importance of macrophages and their role in astrovirus infection has been corroborated by observations in astrovirus-infected lambs, where EM showed virions within macrophages. Furthermore, it is possible that astroviruses have a mechanism to combat this response, as macrophages in astrovirus-infected turkeys demonstrate a reduced ability to phagocytose.",

This can often be accomplished at home; thus, hospital admittance is rare. No vaccine is yet available for humans, and as noted above, immunoglobulin treatment for immunocompromised individuals has been met with varying degrees of success. More recently, authors have speculated that the use of probiotics may interfere with the biological cycle of enteric viruses and may be useful in treatment; however, more studies are needed to confirm these findings. Additionally, no treatment for astrovirusinfected animals exists. The best solution, therefore, is prevention of transmission, which is best done in humans by conscientious hand and food washing. The stability of astroviruses and their resistance to inactivation make them difficult to eliminate after introduction. This is a significant problem in hospitals, where individuals are generally immunocompromised and therefore more susceptible to infection. One outbreak in a bone marrow transplant ward prompted the hospital to scrub the entire ward with warm, soapy water. However, surveillance of the subsequent inhabitants demonstrated fecal shedding of astroviruses, underscoring the difficulty in removing the virus. This is also a significant problem in commercial farming, where astrovirus infection of animals significantly decreases productivity. Its introduction and maintenance in this environment can mean drastic financial losses. In each of these environments, early detection and thorough disinfection are keys to limiting transmission and controlling infection.",
