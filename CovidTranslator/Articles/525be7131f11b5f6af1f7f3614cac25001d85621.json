            "text": "Feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV), an alpha Coronavirus, is the causative agent of a fatal immune mediated disease in cats. It is currently unclear if this virus circulates in the field or develops in felines that are infected with Feline enteric coronavirus. To better understand the genomic changes associated with viral adaptation, we sequenced the complete genomes of FIPV WSU 79-1146 at different tissue passage levels: passage 1, passage 8, and passage 50 tissue culture. Twenty-one amino acid differences were observed in the polyprotein 1a/ab between the different passages. Only one residue change was observed in the spike glycoprotein, which reverted back on subsequent passages, four changes were observed in the 3c protein, and one change was observed in each 3a, small membrane, nucleocapsid and 7a proteins. The mutation rate was calculated to be 5.08-6.3 9 10 -6 nucleotides/site/ passage in tissue culture suggesting a relatively stable virus. Our data show that FIPV has a low mutation rate as it is passed in cell culture but has the capacity for change specifically in nsp 2, 3c, and 7b as it is passed in cell culture.",

            "text": "Belonging to the family Coronaviridae and the order Nidovirales, Coronaviruses are classified into three main subgroups based on genetic and antigenic differences. Classified in-group alpha, Feline coronavirus (FCoV) infection is common in areas with dense cat populations. FCoV can be divided into two groups: type I and type II. Type I FCoV is considered the ''wholly'' feline virus, while type II has been identified as a recombinant of Canine Coronavirus (CCoV) and type I FCoV [1] . Within each of these subgroups (type I and II), there are two variants: feline enteric coronavirus (FECV) and feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV), which cause different forms of clinical disease. The name ''FCoV'' is typically applied to both. The major difference between the two variants is the clinical presentation and outcome of the disease. The majority of infections with FECV result in a mild gastrointestinal disease, whereas infections with FIPV result in a fatal immune system disease due to serosal membrane damage and widespread pyogranulomatous [2] . While FIPV predominantly affects domestic cats (Felis domesticus), it has been recognized in other species such as the African lion (Panthera leo), the mountain lion (Panthera concolor), leopard (Panthera pardus), and cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus) [3] . There is no accurate diagnostic test for differentiating FIPV from the nonlethal FECV.",

            "text": "In 1996, Poland and colleagues [4, 5] suggested that cats acquire FIPV by a mutation that occurs in an endogenous FECV. This is known as the ''in vivo mutation transition hypothesis'' which is defined by the FECV disseminating from the gut and going systemic via de novo virus mutations [2, 5] . The conversion from FECV to FIPV is thought to occur more frequently in a primary infection and in kittens \\2 years of age [5] . Based on this theory, several studies have attempted to identify the exact change(s) in FECV that enable the switch in its pathobiology. One study found that the 3c gene, which encodes a small protein of unknown function, was truncated in the majority of FIPV isolates [6] . Although 3c displays more genetic differences in virus isolated from cats with FIPV when compared to 3c in FECV virus isolates, the changes were not shown to be a specific determinant of replication in macrophages [6] . Based on sequence differences, the spike (S) protein as well as the protein encoded by open reading frame (ORF) 7B have also been suggested to play a role in the pathogenicity change but these proteins have not been specifically implicated in the pathobiology of the virus [7] . Although, gene comparisons between FECV and FIPV have identified nucleotide differences, the specific mutations that cause the altered pathotype have not been identified. In addition, the mutations associated with the altered pathotype can even differ between affected kittens in the same litter [6] .",

One study looked at four regions within the genome: the spike-3a-3c (1,017 bp), Membrane (575 bp), Polymerase (384 bp), and 7b (735 bp) in order to demonstrate distinctive circulating virulent and avirulent strains in natural populations [2] . Based on phylogenetic analysis, they concluded that there are clear genetic differences between FIPV and FECV in multiple gene segments. Based on that data the authors concluded that cats are re-infected with new strains of FCoV from external sources, rather than the viruses acquiring mutations in vivo [2] . It is possible that both hypotheses contribute to the manifestation of FIP.",

In addition, the carboxy terminal domain of the S glycoprotein of FIPV was shown to be responsible for more efficient macrophage infection [9] . In that study, two genetically engineered FIPVs were constructed with one containing a chimeric S glycoprotein with the N-terminal 873 amino acids derived from FECV and the C-terminal 582 amino acids from FIPV and the other virus containing the N terminal amino acids from FIPV and C-terminal amino acids from FECV [9] . Both recombinants had similar growth kinetics; however, the virus with the C-terminal portion from FIPV was able to readily infect macrophages, whereas the virus with the FECV C-terminal S protein had a reduced ability to infect macrophages with \\2 % of the cells infected at 10 h post infection [9] .

Protein 3c was also truncated to a 165 amino acid protein in passages 1, 8, 50, and 100 compared to the previously reported 238 amino acid 3c protein in FECV [14] . The FCoV accessory protein 3c is a membrane-spanning protein that is predicted to have similar topology to SARS-CoV 3A [15] . The SARS-CoV 3A protein is the largest of all accessory proteins containing 274 amino acids. This protein localizes to the Golgi, the plasma membrane and intracellular vesicles [16] . One study investigated the function of 3A and found that it contributes to the cytotoxicity of SARS-CoV and causes intracellular vesicle formation, which is thought to be necessary for Golgi fragmentation during virus infection [17] . However, the depletion of SARS-CoV 3A, in a previous study, did not reduce the levels of RNA isolated from infected cells or media indicating this protein and double membrane vesicles may not be necessary for replication [17] . Another possibility is that this protein functions as a means to rearrange the Golgi for nonlytic release of virus particles. Such is the case with Poliovirus, which has been identified as using intracellular vesicles and double membrane vesicles for nonlytic release of virus particles [18] .",

We found that passage 51 reached a higher peak viral titer (10 8 PFU/ml) than the lower passage viruses (pass 9 at 1 9 10 7 and pass 2 at 1 9 10 6 ). In addition, pass 51 reached a peak titer at 60 h postinoculation, whereas the passage 1 and 9 reached peak titer at 24 and 48 h. It appears that the rate of replication was similar for all passages, thus it is possible that pass 51 was able to replicate to a higher titer because the cells remained viable for a longer time during virus replication possibly reflecting the ability of the higher passaged virus to modulate apoptosis. Mutation rate is a crucial parameter driving viral evolution. The ability to undergo a high rate of genetic change facilitates the development of diverse viral subpopulations that can emerge as new variants capable of cell tropism and pathogenicity shifts. It is still unclear if FIPV arises from point mutations that occur during the FECV replication or if they are two closely related circulating viruses or if both play a role in development of FIP in cats. It must be noted that FCoV has been shown to exist in quasispecies [23] . It is interesting to note that the synonymous mutation rate in CoV's is *1.2 9 10 -3 [24] . However, in this study, the mutation rate was calculated to be 5.08-6.3 9 10 -6 . The reason for the low mutation rate is unclear could be due to the different selection pressures that occur in vitro and in vivo. In this study, we showed that FIPV has the capacity for change specifically in nsp 2, 3c, and 7b as it adapts to cell culture, highlighting the importance of continued studies to elucidate changes in FECV that could potentially lead to FIP in cats.",
