The 2 viruses were highly related (98%, 95%, and 99% sequence identity for the small, medium, and large viral genome segments, respectively), indicating that the men were independently infected with the same virus. This new virus, named Heartland virus (HRTV), was most closely related to, but clearly distinct from, the SFTSV detected in China (7) .",

PCR analysis using bunyavirus-specific primers (10) also failed to detect any specific sequence from this newly isolated virus.",

In total, 6.9 Mb of sequence, consisting of 23,617 reads, was obtained and assembled into 722 contigs. BLASTN (http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi) analysis at the nucleotide level showed no sequence identity to any of the known viruses in GenBank (data not shown). However, a protein-based BLASTX (http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih. gov/Blast.cgi) search yielded 10 contigs showing protein sequence identity to SFTSV and some degree of sequence identity to several other members of the family Bunyaviridae. The virus was tentatively named Hunter Island Group virus (HIGV) after the location where the tick samples were obtained.",

From the sequence comparison, it is evident that HIGV is a new member of the genus Phlebovirus and that it is most closely related to the newly discovered zoonotic members of the genus, SFTSV and HRTV. This finding was further confirmed by phylogenetic analysis based on nucleotide and protein sequences of all 3 genome segments (representative trees shown in Figure 2 ). Because HIGV was isolated from ticks collected from healthy and diseased birds we believed it was unlikely that the virus was the causative agent for the disease in the shy albatrosses. To further confirm this, we conducted ELISA and Western blot analysis using a recombinant HIGV nucleocapsid protein, which was expressed and purified from Escherichia coli by using previously described methods (14, 15) . Of the 38 serum samples tested, none produced positive readings in ELISA or Western blot. In addition, none were positive when tested by HIGV-specific quantitative PCR targeting the polymerase gene of the large segment.",
