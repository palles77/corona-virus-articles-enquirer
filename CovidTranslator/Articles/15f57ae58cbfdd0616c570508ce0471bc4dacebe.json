            "text": "Bacterial colonization and viral respiratory pathogens play important roles in exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), 1,2 especially in patients requiring hospitalization. 3 Viral and/or bacterial infections have been detected in up to 78% of patients with COPD exacerbations. 4 Although bacteria are considered the major cause of COPD exacerbations and antibiotics commonly used to treat exacerbations, 5 the importance of viral infections in COPD exacerbations was mentioned after the introduction and wide use of viral culture and real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). 6, 7 The link of viral infections to COPD has been emphasized in recent studies. COPD patients had more airway inflammation after virus-associated exacerbations. 8, 9 Seemungal et al found that viral infections caused frequent COPD exacerbations with prolonged symptoms. 10 After viral infections, secondary bacterial infections were frequently detected in COPD patients. 11 Biomarkers are commonly used to differentiate infective or noninfective causes of COPD exacerbations. A previous study suggested that patients treated with antibiotics according to procalcitonin (PCT) levels for exacerbations of COPD, reduced antibiotics use. 12 However, PCT does not differentiate bacterial from viral causes of COPD exacerbations requiring admission to intensive care unit or ward. 13, 14 Whether serum inflammatory markers, such as C-reactive protein (CRP) or PCT, can distinguish bacterial from viral infection or not in patients with COPD exacerbations requiring emergency department (ED) visits remains controversial.",

Patients with a history of bronchial asthma or with abnormal chest radiographs indicating other respiratory diseases were excluded.

Higher percentages of the virus-positive patients presented with sore throat and with the family cluster of common cold symptoms. The analysis of maintenance medications prescribed before the ED visits showed that the percentage of patients who had oral corticosteroid treatment prior to Multivariate analysis for evaluation of the risk factors for recurrent exacerbations showed a higher rate of recurrent COPD exacerbation in the 1-year period after the original ED visit in those with an increased sputum volume during the first COPD exacerbation. However, the commonly used biomarkers for infection, such as serum CRP or PCT levels, did not aid in differentiating between bacterial or viral infections in patients with COPD exacerbations. A more rapid decline of lung function is observed in COPD patients with exacerbations. 17 The patients with exacerbations also had higher mortality rates and more frequent exacerbations requiring hospital admissions. 18 Papi et al found that infective exacerbations were detected in 78% of patients, with bacteria identified in 54.7% and viruses in 48.4%. 4 COPD exacerbations in which pathogens were identified were associated with longer hospitalization stays than noninfective exacerbations. 4 However, the positive rates of viral identification in patients with COPD exacerbations requiring hospitalization varied in different publications. In the study by Kherad et al in which the samples for virus identification were obtained via nasopharyngeal swabs and the identification was performed using qualitative RT-PCR assays, the overall virus-positive rate was 51%. 19 McManus et al showed that 36.8% of patients hospitalized for COPD exacerbations had sputum samples that were positive for viruses. 20 In a study of patients with COPD exacerbations requiring mechanical ventilation, viruses were identified in 43% of nasopharyngeal aspirates and posterior pharyngeal swabs. 21 In our study, viral pathogens were detected in the oropharyngeal swabs of 16 patients (22.2%). The viruspositive rate of the oropharyngeal swabs was thus lower than in the previous studies. The possible causes of the variation may include seasonal and geographic differences in the etiology of virus-associated COPD exacerbations. In a recent systematic review, the rates of detection of viruses associated with COPD exacerbations were highest in Europe. 7 Another possible cause of the differences in the results is the site of the sample collections. In our study, we collected oropharyngeal swabs but not nasopharyngeal swabs or sputum samples, which might result in different rates of viral detection.",

            "text": "In this study, the commonly identified viruses in patients with COPD exacerbations requiring ED visits were PIV3, Inf A virus, and human rhinovirus. This result was similar to the finding of Cameron et al from a study in Australia in which the most frequently detected viral etiologies were Inf A, PIV3, and rhinovirus. 21 In a recent review of eight studies, picornavirus was the most common virus in western countries and influenza virus was most common in Asia. 7 H. influenzae was the most common bacterial pathogen in COPD exacerbations in a previous study. 4 Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella pneumoniae were also emphasized in recent studies. 22, 23 In our study, H. influenzae, H. parainfluenzae, and K. pneumoniae were the most commonly identified bacteria. Our data provided worthwhile epidemiologic results of viral and bacterial etiologies of COPD exacerbation, and this may have important implications for appropriate empirical selection of antibiotics and proper management of COPD exacerbations. Biomarkers are commonly used to differentiate infective or noninfective causes of COPD exacerbations. We compared WBC, CRP, and PCT levels between the bacteria-positive and bacteria-negative patients, and these biomarkers did not show statistically significant between-group differences in our study. Similarly, for the WBC, CRP, and PCT levels, the differences between the virus-positive and virus-negative patients were not statistically significant. PCT is a biomarker that is more specific for bacterial infection and might be useful as a guide for decisions regarding antibiotic treatment. However, it could not distinguish bacterial from viral and noninfectious causes of COPD exacerbations. 13 Daniels et al compared CRP and PCT as markers of clinical outcome in COPD exacerbations and found that PCT was not a good biomarker in COPD exacerbations because patients with low PCT values did benefit from antibiotics. 24 The severity of the bacterial infections of the airways in some patients with COPD exacerbations is probably insufficient to induce a significant PCT production.",

Clinicians should consider virusinduced COPD exacerbations if the patients present with a sore throat or a family cluster of common cold symptoms.",

Second, although this study was conducted in a 3,300-bed tertiary teaching hospital, it was still a single-center, not a multicenter, study, and our results were obtained for a very low number of patients. Third, whether these patients had prior influenza or pneumococcal vaccinations had not been recorded. We could not clarify the influence of vaccinations in COPD exacerbations from this study. Further, virus was assessed both by cultures and by PCR, but bacteria were identified only by culture. Finally, our virus identification was obtained from oropharyngeal swab specimens. We did not obtain specimens from nasopharyngeal swabs or the lower respiratory tract for virus identification. The actual rates of virus identification in different sampling sites were unknown.",
