The initial frame of the transloeation is provided by an initiation triplet, usually AUG, while all other coding triplets follow downstream at distances multiple of three bases. This canonical scheme is well illustrated by many known cases of the frameshift mutations, when small deletions or insertions of sizes indivisible by three change the frame of the 3base transloeations. The downstream sequence is read in wrong frame and translated into the wrong amino acid sequence. It also leads to premature termination of the process, with an encounter of a stop-codon. There are eases, however, when the system somehow becomes unstable in that frame, the ribosome counts one base more or one base less, finding itself in the correct frame again [ 1 ] . In other words, the ribosome corrects the effects of the textual change, frameshift mutation, by physically shifting on the mRNA molecule, making an unusual step of one or two bases -a translational frameshift.",

The mRNA sequences have been shown to carry, well pronounced 3-base periodical motif (GHN)n where H stands for non-G and N for any base. Ribosomal RNA of the small subunit, on the other hand, namely those parts of it that are believed to interact with mRNA, carry the complementary periodical pattern (NNC)\u00b0. There are at least three such sites in the small subunit rRNA: 5'-gcCagCagCegCgguaau, 5'-guacaCacCgcCcguca and 5'-gauCacCucCuua centered at positions 525, 1400 and at the T-end (position 1535), respectively (the numbers correspond to coordinates along 16S rRNA of E coli). The (NNC), sites have been assumed to neighbor one another in the mRNA-rRNA complex in the ribosome, making together a kind of rack-gear of repeating NNC units, with which the mRNA makes imperfectly complementary contact involving the frequently repeating motif (GHN)n by keeping the first position G's of the coding triplets always opposite to C's of the frame-monitoring rack-gear.",

Their close proximity to one another is also suggested by the overall size of the mRNA-rRNA contact. Indeed, the minimal estimate of this size is given by total length of the (NNC), rack with its 10 x 3 = 30 bases. This coincides with the estimated length of mRNA involved in the contact with the ribosome [14, 15] . The physical length of the contact is, minimally, about 30 \u00d7 3.4 A = 100 A. Since the diameter of the small subunit neck is about 65 A [16] , this would mean that the mRNA passes largely around the neck and, perhaps, cuts through it. This is consistent with the observation that the 3'-and 5'-ends of the mRNA fragment engaged in the ribosome meet on the same side of the neck [17] . The experimental evidence on the spatial disposition of the sites in the body or on the surface of the 30S subunit is rather controversial and usually of low accuracy since much of the evidence is obtained by electron microscopy [8] .",

            "text": "A recent cross-linking study using mRNA analogues with photoreactive thio-U residues in various positions demonstrated conclusively that the 525 and 1400 sites are in close vicinity to one another, being cross-linked to the same short piece of model mRNA in the elongation 70S complex [24] . The 525 site is found in contact with mRNA, several bases downstream from the triplet interacting with the decoding site. By the same technique but with several thio-U residues in one mRN,A fragment, the cross-linking was detected of the 3-end of rRNA to mRNA few bases upstream from AUG triplet in the initiation 30S complex [251. This new technique of cross-bridging by pieces of RNA [24,251 appears to be the most appropriate for determination of the spatial relationships among the rRNA-mRNA binding sites. It not only shows that both the 525 site and 1535 site are within a few bases of the 1400 site, but it also potentially allows to determine exact distances and the order of the sites along the mRNA, both at the initiation and at the elongation stages. Whatever the order is, the experiments provide conclusive support for one of the main suppositions of our frame-monitoring scheme: the close proximity of the framing sites 525, 1400 and ! 535 to one another within the ribosome.",

            "text": "The periodical signal carried by the protein-coding sequences is itself of distributional nature. Indeed, the stability of the presumed imperfect complementary contact between mRNA and rRNA depends on at least three different sequence features corresponding to basic physical components of the interaction. First, these are isolated complementary base oppositions G.C, A.U and G.U flanked by the non-complementary ones. Second, the stability of the contact is substantially higher when neighboring bases in mRNA are complementary to the respective two bases of rRNA. In this case strong stacking interaction between the neighboring base pairs is the stabilizing factor. Last, but also essential, is the destabilizing contribution of non-complementary base oppositions, especially of the similar-named ones: A.A, C.C, G.G and U.U [31] . For the mRNA-rRNA contacts to be sufficiently stable in the correct frame at every stage of the 3-base translocations, the number of the single complementary contacts should be higher and/or the number of complementary dinucleotides should be higher and/or the number of the bad mismatches should be lower than in the other two frames. The role of the first factor is reflected, in particular, by the frequent occurrence of G in the first positions of the triplets [2] . Special analysis with the emphasis on the possible role of the dinucleotides, excluding the mononucleotide background, resulted in detection of the excessive dinucleotides UG in the third positions of the mRNA triplets and CU in the second positions (Lagunez-Otero, Trifonov, submitted) . This allows to express original degenerate pattern (GHN), carried by mRNA in more detailed form: (GCU),. The same pattern is generated when avoidance of the bad base oppositions is taken into account [32] . Thus, the predominant 3-base periodical motif of the mRNA, reconstructed from the components of the presumed distributional framing recognition of mRNA by rRNA, is 5'-(GCU),. Remarkably, this pattern, extracted from mRNA sequences, without any a priori information on ribosomal RNA structure, turned out to be almost perfectly complementary to the proofreading 525 site (Lagunez-Otero, Trifonov, submitted) as shown in figure 1. This is the only such site in the 16S rRNA, complementary to the (GCU), mRNA pattern. The mRNA sequence, therefore, carries in it not just the framing 3-base periodicity, but information about the rRNA structure as well. This also points to an exceptional role of the universally conserved 525 site in the ribosome function(s). The mRNA sequence analysis potentially could lead, perhaps, to a complete description of the sequence structure of the mRNA-rRNA contact, including all the contact sites and their relative positions and distances along mRNA, as soon as they are reflected in the mRNA sequences.

That is, if there are not enough guanines in the first triplet positions, their avoidance in the second positions should become even stronger. This, indeed, is found to be the case [32] . The avoidance of G in the second positions is explained by the predominant occurrence of G in the second positions of 3'-(CNN)n sequence of the rTzain 525 framing site, since the opposition G.G appears to be one of the most destabilizing base oppositions in RNA structure [31] . Another interesting example of such compensation is the human alpha-fibrinogen gene that lacks the canonical G in the first positions of the triplets of a large repeat region of the gene [2, 33] . It turned out that the dinucleotide CU of the second positions of the triplets is overrepresented in this case, apparently to keep the mRNA pattern (gCU), sufficiently comp-lemer~tary to the 525 site [32] .",
