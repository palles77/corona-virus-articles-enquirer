The recent COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan, highlights such threats to human health, social stability and global trade and economy. We used species distribution modelling and environmental data from satellite imagery to model Blueprint Priority Diseases occurrences. We constructed classical regression and Support Vector Machine models based on environmental predictor variables such as landscape, tree cover loss, climatic covariates. Models were evaluated and a weighed mean was used to map the predictive risk of disease emergence. We mapped the predictive risk for filovirus, Nipah, Rift Valley Fever and coronavirus diseases. Elevation, tree cover loss and climatic covariates were found to significant factors influencing disease emergence. We also showed the relevance of disease biogeography and in the identification potential hotspots for Disease X in regions in Uganda and China.",

Bushmeat consumption and animal trading, arising from the growing demand of animal protein, causes significant changes at the human-animal reservoir interface (7). Among the BPDs, studies demonstrate that the SARS and EVD outbreaks were directly linked to the consumption of infected bushmeat (8, 9) . LF, MVD and EVD flourish in West and central Africa where the consumption of bushmeat is four times greater than the Amazon, which is richer in biodiversity (10) . Moreover, EIDs are also triggered by anthropogenic pressures on land use for agricultural expansion and livestock farming to meet the demand of a growing human population. The fruit-bat migration driven by the deforestation through forest fires in the islands of Sumatra lead to the emergence of Nipah disease in farmers and abattoir workers in Malaysia (11, 12) . Once sufficient infection cycles between human-animal without the sustainable transmission among humans termed as viral chatter is established, the emergence of human-tohuman transmission is inevitable (7). Mathematical modeling and prediction provides quick assessment for control and potential preventive efforts when time for epidemiological studies is scarce (13) . Modeling of infection dynamics analyses diseases outbreaks in animal population and estimates the rate of transmission as well as the potential chance of spillover. Yet, the increasing trends of EIDs risks surpass our capacity in the surveillance and detection of spillovers and outbreaks. Thus, the current public health response to EIDs is to \"get ahead of the curve\" and the growing resolution of satellite imagery has shifted the paradigm towards identifying potential environmental drivers such as deforestation, land fragmentation, biodiversity loss and climate change rather than the surveillance of the EIDs themselves.",

Our results confirm this hypothesis associated with low-lying plains, flooding and emergence of Nipah disease. Coronaviruses are also linked with bat reservoirs.

Biodiversity loss, due to anthropogenic changes to their habitat such as deforestation, land fragmentation for agriculture, increase in demand for protein and climate We hypothesize that a decrease in predators could cause an imbalance in the natural predator-prey equilibrium leading to an increase in small mammal reservoirs and thus to viruses transmission via disease vectors such as ticks.

Despite these limitations, our study is the first to confirm the validity and effectiveness of using SDMs and other mathematical models to predict and identify the potential hotspots for BPDs.
