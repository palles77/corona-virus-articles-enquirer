Pulse labeling with 32 P-orthophosphate indicated that the IBV N protein was phosphorylated in the virion, as well as at all times during infection in either chicken embryo kidney cells or Vero cells. Pulse-chase analyses followed by immunoprecipitation of IBV N proteins using rabbit anti-IBV N polyclonal antibody demonstrated that the phosphate on the N protein was stable for at least 1 h. Simultaneous labeling with 32 P-orthophosphate and 3 H-leucine identified a 3.5-fold increase in the 32 P: 3 H counts per minute (cpm) ratio of N in the virion as compared to the 32 P: 3 H cpm ratio of N in the cell lysates from chicken embryo kidney cells, whereas in Vero cells the 32 P: 3 H cpm ratio of N from the virion was 10.5-fold greater than the 32 P: 3 H cpm ratio of N from the cell lysates. These studies are consistent with the phosphorylation of the IBV N playing a role in assembly or maturation of the viral particle. D",

IBV Beaudetteinfected Vero cells were treated with actinomycin-D (5 Ag/ ml), an inhibitor of RNA synthesis, immediately after infection and continued during the 1 h of labeling with 100 ACi 32 P i . One-eighth of the volume of the TRIZOLtreated cell lysate was used for denaturing gel electrophoresis. As shown by 32 P i labeling, IBV N was the only phosphorylated viral protein in infected cell lysates, as compared with the uninfected cell lysate control ( Fig. 2A ). N protein, as represented by a phosphorylated band at approximately a 48-kDa molecular mass, was phosphorylated throughout infection, with label appearing around 6 h p.i. until at least 18 h p.i., the last hour examined ( Fig. 2A) . A second, slower phosphorylated band, appearing to be slightly larger than the 36.4-kDa marker, was determined to be a cellular protein because it was also clearly present in the uninfected cell lysate control. Western blot analyses with rabbit anti-N polyclonal antibody, specific for IBV N protein, highlighted a band at approximately 48 kDa molecular mass (Fig. 2B ). 35 S methionine pulse labeling followed by unlabeled media chase determined the stability of the IBV N protein",

IBV Beaudette-infected Vero cells were pulse labeled for 0.5 h with 35 S-methionine at 7.5 h p.i, before chasing with excess cold methionine for 0.5 h (that is, 8 h p.i.) to 3.5 h (that is, 11.5 h p.i.) when the infected cells were harvested. IBV N protein was isolated by immunoprecipitation at saturating concentrations of rabbit anti-N-polyclonal antibody, such that all N in the infected cell lysates was precipitated. N protein in cell lysates was consistently detected after 30 min of pulse labeling, whereas labeled N was not detected with a 15-min pulse-label with 35 Smethionine. After labeling for 30 min, media containing an excess of unlabeled methionine were added for varying lengths of time in order to dilute or chase the label from N. Maximum incorporation of the label was observed after the 1.5 h of chase (Figs. 3A and B). As can be seen from the graphic representation of the densitometric analyses of the bands, using a phosphor imager (Fig. 3B) , there was a slight decrease in the intensity of the band until the 2.5-h chase period when an increase in intensity was observed at the 3and 3.5-h chase periods (Fig. 3A) . The intensity of 35 Slabeled band resulting from the 2-and 2.5-h chase corresponded, respectively, to 75% and 82% of the 1.5h chase period band intensity. After the 3-and 3.5-h chase with unlabeled methionine, the band intensity corresponded, respectively, to 85% and 92% of the band intensity for the 1.5-h chase. The decrease in the band intensity was never greater than 50%. If we interpret the stability as beginning with 1.5 h, the time of maximum incorporation, it can be deduced that the N protein is stable for at least 2 h. N protein alone was immunoprecipitated as shown by Western blot analysis using chicken anti-IBV antibody (Fig. 1B) . No bands were obtained when lysates from uninfected cells were used for immunoprecipitation, using rabbit-anti-N polyclonal antibody (Fig. 3A ) or when using non-specific rabbit-anti-reticuloendotheliosis virus gag antibody as a control (data not shown). A faint band slightly larger than 48 kDa was obtained on exposure to an imaging plate when rabbit preimmune serum was used for immunoprecipitation of infected cell lysates. This band did not react with anti-IBV-Gray chicken serum as determined by the Western blot analysis (data not shown) and therefore was not considered a viral protein.",

In order to determine the stability of the phosphate on the N protein in terms of half-life, infected cells were labeled with 32 P i for 2 h and the chase analysis was started at 8 h p.i. The chase was continued until 11 h p.i., when N protein was immunoprecipitated from cell lysates at saturating amounts of the antibody and standardized so as to precipitate all the N protein.

Since phosphate was readily available in the cell, intracellular phosphate pools would be difficult to replace. Labeling on the N protein might increase during the chase period due to labeled cellular-derived phosphate.

The hours p.i. were calculated as the treatment variable and the ratio was used as the response. A significant linear trend ( P < 0.0001) in the ratios was obtained (Fig. 6) .

            "text": "Dual labeling with 32 P i and 3 H-leucine indicated that the virion N was more phosphorylated than the N from infected Vero or infected CEK cells. However, the 32 P: 3 H cpm ratio of the virion N protein from Vero cells was greater than the ratio from CEK cells. The electrophoretic mobility of the virion N during SDS -PAGE was slightly slower than the cellular N, as might be expected with additional phosphorylation. In the case of measles virus, the nucleoprotein, phosphorylated on both serine and threonine, is preferentially assembled into the nucleocapsids (Gombart et al., 1995) . Increased phosphorylation could relate to preferential binding of N protein to viral RNA for packaging or assembly into nucleocapsids. In the case of Chandipura virus, homodimerization of the phosphoprotein (P) occurs via the N-terminal 46 amino acids of the protein only after phosphorylation of this region (Raha et al., 2000) . A global conformational change in the N-terminal domain of the P of the Chandipura virus is induced by phosphorylation (Raha et al., 1999) . Similarly, phosphorylation of the IBV N protein could induce a conformational change that promotes both N -N interactions and RNA binding. N -N interactions may be important in nucleocapsid assembly and in compacting the nucleocapsid. The N associated with virions was mostly resistant to CIAP treatment which targets serine-and threonine-bound phosphates and to RNase treatment. It is likely that the hyperphosphorylated form of the IBV N protein binds genomic RNA thereby forming tight compact complexes that are resistant to enzyme treatment. Narayanan et al. (2003) showed that the MHV N protein in the virion nucleocapsid and in the intracellular genome-length RNP complexes that bound to the viral M protein was tightly self-associated, such that its association was retained even after extensive RNAse A treatment. However, this was not the case with RNP complexes formed with subgenomic RNA (Narayanan et al., 2003) .",

However, the degree of phosphorylation may depend on the cellular functions since the N packaged in Vero cells apparently was associated with 7-fold more labeled phosphate than the N in virions assembled from CEK cells. In addition to the differences in avian versus primate origin, respectively, the CEK cells are not immortalized and make interferon, as compared with Vero cells that are deficient in interferon genes. Because the hyperphosphorylated state of N was consistently observed in viral particles from both cell types, it may be essential in packaging and assembly of genomic RNA into infectious virions.",
