Kinetic analysis of RNA binding indicated that the C-terminal phosphorylation cluster was involved in the recognition of viral RNA from non-viral RNA. The IBV N protein has been found to be essential for the successful recovery of IBV using reverse genetics systems. Rescue experiments indicated that phosphorylated N protein recovered infectious IBV more efficiently when compared to modified N proteins either partially or non-phosphorylated. Our data indicate that the phosphorylated form of the IBV N protein plays a role in virus biology.",

Phosphorylation of the nucleocapsid protein is thought to regulate many of these events although precise roles remain unclear. Coronaviruses are a group of positive strand RNA viruses which cause principally respiratory and gastro-intestinal infections and include the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) (Peiris et al., 2004) and avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) (Cavanagh, 2005) .",

            "text": "Coronavirus genomes are approximately 30 kb in length, making them the largest RNA genomes so far discovered. Both RNA replication and mRNA transcription occur in virus infected cells and a series of subgenomic mRNA molecules are synthesized by the viral replicase via a discontinuous transcription mechanism (Enjuanes et al., 2006a; Pasternak et al., 2006; Sawicki et al., 2007) , in which a viral leader sequence, derived from the 5\u2032 end of the genome, is added to the 5\u2032 end of each subgenomic mRNA (Masters, 2006) . Adjacent to the leader sequence is a transcription regulatory sequence (TRS) which also precedes each open reading frame along the genome. Genetic analysis suggests that the TRS and flanking sequences are involved in the modulation of transcription (Alonso et al., 2002; Hiscox et al., 1995; Sola et al., 2005; Van Marle et al., 1995; Zuniga et al., 2004) . The TRS has been shown to act as a high affinity binding site for the coronavirus nucleocapsid (N) protein suggesting a role for N protein in transcription Nelson et al., 2000; Spencer and Hiscox, 2006a; Stohlman et al., 1988) . Although replication can take place without N protein it does so at reduced efficiency (Almazan et al., 2004; Schelle et al., 2005) . Furthermore N protein has been shown to co-localize with coronavirus replication complexes in the cytoplasm at early points post-infection Van der Meer et al., 1999) . Moreover, N protein is required for the efficient rescue of coronavirus genomic RNA from cDNA clones (Almazan et al., 2004; Coley et al., 2005; Schelle et al., 2005; Yount et al., 2000 Yount et al., , 2003 and has been shown to be essential for the rescue of IBV using at least two different types of reverse genetics systems (Britton et al., 2005; Casais et al., 2001; Youn et al., 2005a,b) .",

Situated within these regions are motifs which play a role in both aspects of virus biology.

Although coronavirus N proteins were predicted to be phosphorylated at multiple serine residues, mass spectroscopic analyses identified two regions of phosphorylation on the IBV N protein (when over-expressed) which are located at two conserved amino acid clusters, Ser 190 and Ser 192 and Thr 378 and Ser 379 (Chen et al., 2005) . The protein was heterogeneously phosphorylated with the predominant species having all four sites occupied (Chen et al., 2005) , which reflects the mobility of IBV N protein (detected using western blot) during infection, in which a single N protein species is observed . Similarly the porcine coronavirus, transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), N protein was also found to be phosphorylated at two clusters, amino acids Ser 156 , Ser 254 and Ser 256 (Calvo et al., 2005) . The murine coronavirus, mouse hepatitis virus N protein is phosphorylated at Ser 170 , Thr 177 , Ser 389 , Ser 424 and Thr 428 (White et al., 2007) . Although the precise sites have not been mapped, the SARS-CoV N protein is thought to be phosphory-lated at serine residues (Surjit et al., 2005) . Thus for IBV and MHV N proteins these phosphate groups are located in the middle and C-terminal regions of the protein, and overall the IBV, TGEV and MHV analyses demonstrate that coronavirus N proteins are phosphorylated but not at multiple (b 10) serine residues which was once accepted dogma based upon prediction analysis.",

Previous mass spectroscopic analysis demonstrated that N protein expressed in insect cells had identical post-translational modifications to that produced in a cell line (Vero) permissive to virus infection (Chen et al., 2005) . A similar approach was used in this study to generate recombinant baculoviruses for the expression of modified IBV N proteins. The baculoviruses were used to express modified N proteins in which either Ser 190 and Ser 192 (N AATS ) or Thr 378 and Ser 379 (N SSAA ) were substituted for the amino acid alanine resulting in a partially phosphorylated IBV N protein. A third recombinant baculovirus was produced that expressed a modified N protein in which all four amino acids were substituted for alanine resulting in a non-phosphorylated (N AAAA ) form of the IBV N protein. The N AAAA protein was used in place of E. coli expressed N protein (non-phosphorylated protein) to ensure that any additional post-translational modifications, such as acetylation, were present.",

This difference in affinity resulted from decreased association and increased dissociation rates for random versus viral RNA. The non-phosphorylated IBV N protein, N AAAA , and the partially phosphorylated N protein, N SSAA , bound non-viral RNA with higher affinities. However, the partially phosphorylated N protein, N AATS , bound non-viral RNA with approximately 246 times lower affinity than the non-phosphorylated N AAAA protein, with binding kinetics similar to the phosphorylated N SSTS protein (Fig. 3 , Table 1 ).

In the first case phosphorylation through altering charge may affect binding affinity. For example, dephosphorylation of the rubella virus capsid protein increases its binding affinity for viral RNA and specific phosphorylation sites are involved in the process (Law et al., 2003) . This is also the case for IBV N protein where nonphosphorylated N protein can bind viral RNA with higher affinity than phosphorylated protein, but at the expense of specificity. Likewise, phosphorylation has been proposed to reduce the electrostatic interaction with target RNA, as in the case of the binding of potato virus A coat protein to RNA (Ivanov et al., 2001) . Given the binding differences between N AATS protein and N SSAA protein for viral RNA it can be concluded that overall negative charge is not contributing to binding, otherwise the two proteins would have equivalent binding kinetics. Both of these proteins had identical motilities as determined by SDS-PAGE analysis (Fig. 1) , and again mass spectroscopy confirmed their phosphorylation status with two phosphorylated sites.",

            "text": "An alternative mechanism is that phosphorylation can affect the conformation of a protein with a corresponding effect on RNA binding properties, as in the case of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 Rev protein, where the phosphorylation of one or two serine residues can cause the closure of an RNA binding cleft in the protein (Fouts et al., 1997) . Similarly, phosphorylation of the duck hepatitis B virus capsid protein causes a conformational change in the C-terminal region of the protein (Yu and Summers, 1994) . In order to determine whether there were any major conformational differences in the N protein structures between the modified forms of the N proteins either following loss of the phosphate group from substitution of the Ser or Thr amino acids with Ala, circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy was used to determine the conformational states of the four N proteins. CD spectroscopy results in the detection of changes in the overall secondary structure of a protein. CD spectroscopic measurements were taken in the far UV (180-260 nm) spectra. This was repeated three times for all four proteins with different protein samples used in each separate experiment. The HT reading was taken along side all measurements to ensure that the signal to noise ratio remained below the level at which data could be considered reliable. An example of a CD spectrum obtained for all four proteins with the average HT reading for all four proteins is shown in Fig. 4 . The resulting data (above a wavelength of 195 nm) indicated that the differing phosphorylation patterns did not result in different overall secondary structures, as judged by the similarity of the four CD readings produced. The spectra of all four proteins remained below the axis for the majority of the reading, with a major trough occurring between 200 and 210 nm. One subtle difference that can be observed is that the CD trace of both the partially phosphorylated proteins remained slightly closer to the x-axis (i.e. less negative) between 250 and 200 nm than the same region of the fully and non-phosphorylated proteins. Despite this difference in magnitude of the CD signals, the general shapes of Fig. 2 . Kinetic analyses of IBV N protein and the N proteins with modified sites binding to viral RNA. The proteins at 3.125, 6.25, 12.5, 25, 50 and 100 nM concentrations were injected over the immobilized RNA; association was monitored for 6 min followed by a 12 min dissociation phase. Black lines represent fitted data. Kinetic parameters for the experiments are shown in Table 1. the spectrum remain similar. Moreover, the trend of remaining negative and evoking a major trough peaking at approximately 208 nm was the same as observed in the far CD spectrum of IBV N protein expressed and purified from E. coli (Spencer and Hiscox, 2006a) .",

As for previous analysis (Spencer and Hiscox, 2006a ) the CDDSTR (a Fortran program (Johnson, 1999) ) provided the best fitting data, as judged by the low normalized root mean square deviation (NRMSD) values and close agreement between the experimental and reconstructed spectra. As such, data estimated by this method were used to compare the structures of differentially phosphorylated N proteins ( Table 2 ). The data indicated that all four proteins were made up of a large proportion of \u03b2 structures, with \u03b2-sheets and turns accounting for over 50% of the secondary structure. The proteins contained an average of 20% \u03b1-helix with the remaining 26-27% being comprised of random coil structures, again these are consistent with those estimations of secondary structure for (nonphosphorylated) N protein expressed in E. coli (Spencer and Hiscox, 2006a) . The Student's t-test revealed that any difference between the secondary structure elements of the differentially phosphorylated B proteins was not significant (data not shown). These proportions are in approximate agreement with the solid state structure for the N and C-terminal regions of IBV N protein (Jayaram et al., 2006) .",

N protein is essential for the successful rescue of IBV using at least two different types of reverse genetics systems (Britton et al., 2005; Casais et al., 2001; Youn et al., 2005a,b) . Recovery of infectious IBV was repeatedly found to be unsuccessful in the absence of the IBV N protein or from the use of an IBV N gene that lacked the correct initiation codon for the N protein. However, infectious IBV was rescued via co-transfection of plasmid DNA expressing either IBV N SSTS , N SSAA , N AATS or N AAAA (pCi-NeoIBVN SSTS , pCi-NeoIBVN SSAA , pCi-NeoIBVN AATS and pCi-NeoIBVN AAAA , respectively) and vaccinia virus DNA containing a full-length IBV cDNA under the control of a T7 promoter sequence in chick kidney cells previously infected with a recombinant fowlpox virus expressing T7 RNA polymerase. The rescue experiments were repeated three times. The amounts of progeny virus rescued in the transfected cells were determined by plaque assay, as an approximate determination of the efficiency of rescue, and related to input plasmid, generating a numerical output of infectious units per \u03bcg of input plasmid. All of the modified N proteins resulted in the rescue of infectious IBV, indicating that phosphorylation of the IBV N protein is not required for this biological activity.

This plasmid served as template for the generation of plasmids that when expressed would lead to phosphorylation mutants of N protein. Specific mutations were introduced using the Stratagene QuikChange site directed mutagenesis kit. Three plasmids were generated pTriExIBVN SSAA , pTriExIBVN AATS and pTriExIBVN AAAA , which lead to the replacement of Thr 378 and Ser379 with alanine, Ser190 and Ser 192 with alanine and Ser190, Ser 192 , Thr 378 and Ser 379 with alanine, respectively. Primer sequences are available on request. All constructs were sequenced in both directions. Recombinant baculoviruses were generated by transfecting Sf9 cells with the plasmids expression vector (which contained segments of baculovirus genomic DNA) and BacVector-3000 Triple Cut Virus DNA (Novagen). After transfection, monolayers were plaque assayed and candidate plaques individually purified by re-plaquing. Virus was harvested from subsequent plaques and used to infect exponentially growing cultures of Sf9 cells. These modified N protein genes were also cloned into the eukaryotic expression plasmid pCi-Neo that did not contain a his-tag moiety for rescue of infectious IBV as described (Casais et al., 2003 (Casais et al., , 2001 . These vectors were pCi-NeoIBVN SSAA , pCi-NeoIBVN AATS and pCi-NeoIBVN AAAA . The cloning of wild-type N protein into pCi-Neo (in this study referred to as pCi-NeoIBVN SSTS ) has been described previously (Hiscox et al., 2001) .",

Expression of the IBV N protein from an expression plasmid is essential for the successful rescue of infectious IBV. Vaccinia virus DNA, containing the full-length IBV cDNA, and the plasmid expressing the IBV N genes are co-transfected into chick kidney cells previously infected with a recombinant fowlpox virus expressing T7 RNA polymerase. Expression of T7 RNA polymerase from the recombinant fowlpox virus results in the synthesis of infectious IBV RNA from the vaccinia virus DNA. The IBV RNA acts as an mRNA for the synthesis of the IBV replicase proteins, resulting in replication of the IBV RNA and generation of the subgenomic mRNAs for translation of the structural proteins and assembly of infectious virus progeny. The expression of IBV N protein from the co-transfected plasmid is required to initiate this process by an as yet unknown mechanism.",
