We have previously investigated the therapeutic efficacy of recombinant human catalase (rhCAT) against viral pneumonia in mice, but the protection mechanisms involved were not explored. In the present study, we have performed a more in-depth analysis covering survival, lung inflammation, immune cell responses, production of cytokines, and inflammation signaling pathways in mice. Male imprinting control region mice were infected intranasally with high pathogenicity (H1N1) influenza A virus followed by treatment with recombinant human catalase. The administration of rhCAT resulted in a significant reduction in inflammatory cell infiltration (e.g., macrophages and neutrophils), inflammatory cytokine levels (e.g., IL-2, IL-6, TNF-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b3), the level of the intercellular adhesion molecule 1 chemokine and the mRNA levels of toll-like receptors TLR-4, TLR-7, and NF-\u03baB, as well as partially maintaining the activity of the antioxidant enzymes system. These findings indicated that rhCAT might play a key protective role in viral pneumonia of mice via suppression of inflammatory immune responses.",

            "text": "According to global estimates generated by the World Health Organization, 450 million cases of pneumonia are diagnosed every year. Approximately 4 million of those cases end in death, accounting for 7 % of total mortality worldwide. The recent emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-associated coronavirus, avian influenza A (H5N1) virus, the 2009 pandemic influenza A (H1N1) virus and novel avian influenza A H7N9 virus [2] [3] [4] has served to highlight respiratory viruses as important causative agents of severe pneumonia. Nonetheless, the current battery of antivirals available in clinical practice for the treatment of pneumonia is limited [5] . The continued pandemic threat of these circulating viruses makes identification and development of novel therapeutic strategies, especially for the treatment of influenza A, an urgent matter Recent evidence suggests that much of the acute lung injury caused by H1N1 and H5N1 can be attributed to excessive ROS production (i.e., oxidative stress) initiated by an overactive innate immune response [6] [7] [8] . ROS, including the superoxide anion, hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ) and the hydroxyl radical (OH\u00b7), are indiscriminately toxic to cells when produced in excess and are capable of regulating proinflammatory cytokine production. A major cellular source of ROS during infection is infiltrating inflammatory cells [9] . Identification of the enzymatic sources of ROS may pave the way for therapies that combat the oxidative stress-dependent lung injury caused by the influenza A virus.",

For recipients of saline alone, no mice in the virus control group survived beyond 6 day post-infection, whereas 35 % of mice that received rhCAT (100 kU) survived until 14 day post-infection (p<0.01).

Lung/body index (Fig. 1c) and total protein content in lung tissue (Fig. 1d ) demonstrated that H1N1 virus infection caused lung tissue swelling and the production of significant amounts of protein exudate in the control mice, while rhCAT administration (50 and 100 kU) significantly alleviated these effects.

For this reason, the levels of key antioxidant enzymes [e.g., CAT and superoxide dismutase (SOD)], total antioxidant status (TAS), and MDA (the product of lipid peroxidation representing ROS-mediated tissue peroxidation injury) were evaluated in lung tissue on days 2 and 4 post-infection. Influenza infection induced a significant increase of MDA and a decrease in CAT and SOD activity in virus control mice while the administration of rhCAT resulted in a dosedependent reduction of MDA and a higher activity of CAT and SOD (Fig. 2; p\u22640.05 ). rhCAT treatment slightly influenced the level of TAS but revealed no significant difference between virus control and rhCAT-treated mice (Fig. 2b ). The antioxidant system is comprised of non-enzymatic antioxidant molecules (e.g., vitamins A, C, and E, glutathione, etc.) and antioxidant enzymes (e.g., CAT, SOD and various peroxidases) and is therefore reflected in TAS measurements. This therefore indicates that rhCAT may partly restore the antioxidant enzyme system while at the same time not significantly influencing TAS levels.

We think that the robust ROS reaction induced by H1N1 infection may have activated the TLR-NF-\u03baB signaling pathway and stimulated the secretion of associated cytokines, resulting in severe pneumonia accompanied by a robust infiltration of inflammation-related cells in the control mice. This assumption echoes the latest finding that oxidized phospholipid potently stimulates TLR4-dependent inflammation [31] . The administration of rhCAT markedly suppressed inflammatory responses to H1N1-infection, which was probably ascribed to a decrease in ROS levels, but more direct experiments are needed in future studies.",
