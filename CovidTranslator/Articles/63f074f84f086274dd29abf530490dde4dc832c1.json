For the viral genetic material to be delivered into the cytoplasm, these viruses have to escape the endosomal compartment, an event triggered by the conformational changes of viral endosomolytic proteins. We focus here on small nonenveloped viruses such as adeno-associated viruses, which contain few penetration proteins. The first time a penetration protein changes conformation defines the slowest timescale responsible for the escape. To evaluate this time, we construct what to our knowledge is a novel biophysical model based on a stochastic approach that accounts for the small number of proteins, the endosomal maturation, and the protease activation dynamics. We show that the escape time increases with the endosomal size, whereas decreasing with the number of viral particles inside the endosome. We predict that the optimal escape probability is achieved when the number of proteases in the endosome is in the range of 250-350, achieved for three viral particles.",

In many cases, endosomes containing viruses mature into late endosomes, which are later on transformed into lysosomes, where the viral particle is readily degraded (4) . Consequently, to pursue their target and deliver their genetic material to the cytoplasm, viruses have to escape the endosomal compartment before being degraded (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) .

            "text": "Viruses have developed molecular tools for efficient hijacking of host cell machinery. They use them for efficient delivery of their own genes and replication. Consequently, viruses can be used to explore cellular biology pathways such as endocytosis (4) , or to study gene and foreign molecule transfer (13) . To better understand the virus-host molecular communication, and to unravel viral efficiency in cell entry, interdisciplinary approaches have been recently developed (14) . In particular, to quantify early infection, including cell entry, endosomal escape, and diffusion into the cytoplasm, early models (15, 16) have used mass action laws, based on a single Poissonian rate to compute the time the virus spends in each step. Although the mass-action law can be used to obtain several quantitative estimates about the early time of infection, it presents several limitations. Indeed, these Poissonian decay rates are generally fitted to data, rather than being derived from biophysical molecular properties. In addition, as shown below, because the endosomal escape time depends on the concentration of proteases in the endosome, the escape rate is not time-independent; instead, it is an increasing function of time. Recently, using the virus-host interactions, new stochastic models have been developed at a molecular level to quantify the different viral entry stages, starting with the receptor binding at the cell surface, the virus internalization (17) (18) (19) , and the free cytoplasmic trafficking to a nuclear pore (20) (21) (22) (23) .",

            "text": "Due to the central role of endosomal escape in the viral entry process and the difficulty of obtaining direct experimental data, our goal here is to develop and analyze a biophysical model to investigate and quantify the viral escape mechanism. The escape process is not clearly understood: whereas enveloped viruses possess membrane-associated glycoproteins mediating the fusion between the virus and endosome membranes, nonenveloped viruses (such as the adeno-associated virus (AAV)) possess penetration proteins able to initiate formation of small pores, leading to endosomal membrane disruption (24) . In many cases, endosomes containing viruses undergo a gradual and complex maturation, involving proton-pump-mediated acidification (25, 26) , and low-pH-mediated signals trigger conformational changes of both glycoproteins and penetration proteins. Interestingly, protons can either directly bind and trigger viral proteins activation, which is the case for influenza (27) or vesicular stomatitis virus (28) , or regulate the activity of proteases, such as furins (29) or cathepsins (30) , which then cleave viral endosomolytic proteins, leading to their conformational change and endosomal membrane destabilization, occurring for Ebola virus (31), Murine hepatitis virus (32) , papillomaviruses (33) , and parvoviruses (34, 35) . In particular, low-pH treatment of AAV particles appears to be insufficient to trigger the lipolytic activity of their viral protein 1 (VP1) penetration proteins, indicating that other unknown pH-dependent proteases cleave and activate VP1 proteins. Furthermore, the AAV seems to escape endosomes in an optimal pH window, before being degraded in lysosomes and after viral capsid has been primed by low-pH-activated cathepsins, which is required for nuclear uncoating (36) . In addition, due to possible degradation in the cytoplasm through the ubiquitin-proteasome machinery (5), the release location of the viral capsid influences the efficiency of arrival to the nucleus. For all these reasons, the pH and the escape time are two fundamental parameters defining the efficacy of viral delivery into the nucleus, and this calls for a quantitative modeling to determine the kinetics of the endosomal escape time. Interestingly, AAV contains only seven VP1 penetration proteins (37) , and the activation of a single VP1 protein defines the slowest timescale of the endosomal escape process.",

            "text": "Consequently, to quantify the residence time of the AAV inside an endosome, we use the fact that the limiting step is due to the conformational change of at least one VP1 penetration protein. Thus, we develop a biophysical model based on the properties that a small number of endosomolytic proteins are involved, which is specific to AAV, and that the conformational change of these proteins is triggered by the binding of proteases. In this model, we first use a Markov jump process to describe the dynamics of proteases binding to a VP1 protein and compute the conformational change time. This analysis uses a Markov jump process continuous approximation (38) . Interestingly, we obtain the VP1 conformational change rate as a function of the forward and backward rates of proteases to the virus binding sites. We then obtain several quantitative results and predictions on the number of bound sites on VP1, required to trigger the conformational change. To integrate the dynamics of endosomal acidification, we further model the low-pH activation of proteases with a Poisson process, and finally obtain an expression for the mean first time a VP1 penetration protein changes conformation and disrupts the endosomal membrane. Finally, our model predicts that increasing the number of AAV in the endosome slightly decreases the viral residence time and its variance, whereas enlarging the endosome-size shall delay the escape process. We show that the number of AAV particles inside the endosome drastically modulates the probability of escape in a given range of activated proteases and we find that the optimal number of AAV is 3.",

For small nonenveloped viruses such as AAVs, endosomal escape is induced by the conformational change of penetration proteins in the viral capsid (Fig. 1) . To estimate the residence time t e inside an endosome, we start when there are already n v AAV particles inside a spherical endosome, with a radius r 0 \u00bc 0.45 mm (39) , and a volume V 0 \u00bc 4/3pr 3 0 \u00bc 0.38 mm 3 . In a first approximation, we neglect endosomal fusion or split (39) , leading to variations of the endosome size. Viral particles contain n P independent penetration proteins, formed of n s sites that can bind competitively activated proteases (Fig. 1) . Thus, there are a total of n v n p n s binding sites. In our model, escape occurs when the number of bound sites at a single VP1 penetration protein has reached a critical threshold n T , mediating its conformational change.",

The active transport of endosomes along microtubules (MTs) is accompanied by a change of the early endosome (EE) into a maturing endosome (ME) after a gradual acidification of the endosomal compartment. Low-pH-activated proteases bind to viral endosomolytic proteins, triggering their conformational change. Finally, the conformational change of a single viral protein induces endosomal membrane disruption, followed by the release of viral particles into the cytoplasm. After magnification, the region inside the dashed box shows that the activated proteases of concentration c can bind with a forward binding rate r(X,c) and unbind with a dissociation rate l(X) to viral endosomolytic proteins, where X is the number of occupied sites.

This analysis relies on the dynamics of protease entry (see Eq. 12) and on estimating for each concentration the probability for a single protein to change conformation that leads to viral escape. Because the AAV contains only seven penetration proteins (37), we consider that escape occurs when at least one of them is activated. In addition, because proteases are in excess, each VP1 is treated independently. Furthermore, because wild-type AAV rescue the infectivity of mutant devoid of penetration proteins (34, 48) , this experimental result confirms that all viruses escape when at least one of them penetrates the membrane. Consequently, to estimate the mean proteases concentration hc t e i at which viruses escape the endosome, we shall compute the probability P 0 e (c) that a penetration protein changes conformation before a new protease is activated for a fixed concentration c. The probability of no conformational changes is p\u00f0t; c\u00de \u00bc Z x T 0 p\u00f0y; tjx 0 \u00f0c\u00de; c\u00dedy; (13) where initially x(t \u00bc 0) \u00bc x 0 (c).

In our model, the conformational change of a single VP1 penetration protein defines the limiting stage of the AAV egress from the endosome. We have indeed neglected other factors not directly correlated with the endosomal pH, such as the physical disruption of the endosome. These limiting factors shall be further investigated, but their kinetics should be negligible compared to the timescale of proteases activation and binding up to a critical threshold. In addition, almost nothing is known about the nature and activity of the proteases. Here we have considered the simplest situation where pH-activated proteases bind and cleave VP1.

However, because priming of the viral capsid by low-pHactivated cathepsins is required for later stages of the entry process, such as genome uncoating and delivery into the nucleus (36), a viral particle should stay long enough inside the endosome. Consequently, we predict that there must be an optimal range in the number of activated proteases inside the endosome [k min ; k max ] in which viruses must escape. Whereas escaping above k max leads to an irreversible degradation, escaping below k min results in the premature release and the insufficient priming of the viral capsid by the cathepsins (Fig. 4 a) .

In addition, P optimal depends strongly on various parameters, such as the endosomal proteases range. Indeed, when the range is shifted to [300-400], the optimal probability is maximal for a single virus (P optimal \u00bc 0.21), and further drops to P optimal \u00bc 0.05 for two viruses and P optimal \u00bc 0.01 for three viruses.

We predict that by replacing all VP2 proteins by VP1, the optimal escape probability P optimal , for a single virus, will increase from 0.37 to 0.52.
