The largest category (inflammatory) contained 92 cats, of which 47 were considered to be consistent with infection by feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) virus. Six cats showed evidence of more than one disease process; thus, one cat with FIP also had toxocara infection of the lateral ventricles and five cats with FSE also showed perivascular cuffing suggestive of concurrent viral infection. In only two cases did the diagnosis on review differ significantly from the original interpretation. There was no evidence of FSE before the original case was recognized in April 1990. q",

In 1990, feline spongiform encephalopathy (FSE) was identified as a cause of nervous disease in cats (Wyatt et al., 1990 Wyatt, 1991) . It was subsequently shown that FSE had the characteristics of a transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (TSE) (Pearson et al., 1992) and that in mouse transmission studies its behaviour was similar to that of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) (Fraser et al., 1994) . At that time the archive of post-mortem diagnoses of feline neurological cases was briefly reviewed , but detailed histopathological examination was not undertaken. More recently, serological and molecular evidence of exposure of cats in the UK to Borna disease virus (BDV) has been reported (Reeves et al., 1998) . The aims of this study were (1) to extend the preliminary retrospective survey of the Bristol University archive of cats with neurological disease, (2) to review the histology of cases of nervous disorders, (3) to categorize the nature of the pathological changes, and (4) to search for histological evidence that FSE may have occurred in the UK before it was first recognized in 1990.",

As a result, the cases from which histological sections were available for review numbered 286. The material examined, which varied between cases, is summarized in Table 1 . In 1990 the sampling procedure was standardized to include brain sections from the anterior cerebrum, mid-cerebrum (thalamic level), posterior cerebrum (including the midbrain), cerebellum and medulla at the level of the obex. The breeds represented in the 286 cases were: Domestic shorthair (172), Siamese (27), Domestic longhair (22), Burmese (19), Birman (13), Persian (8), Rex (4), miscellaneous (19) and unknown (2).",

Storage disorders were identified by the presence of many swollen abnormal neuronal cell bodies (Summers et al., 1995) . In one kitten, electron microscopy and histochemical stains supported the initial diagnosis, and biochemical analysis of tissue (Dr Bryan Winchester, personal communication) confirmed the storage disorder to be a GM 1 gangliosidosis (Barker et al., 1986) . In another case the diagnosis was confirmed by thin layer chromatography but no detailed information was available. A dermoid cyst present at the level of the third thoracic vertebra of a 16-month-old cat resulted in ataxia and euthanasia .

Lymphoma was located within the spinal canal in 13 cats; four of which also had neoplastic infiltrates in the brain. The brain alone was affected in the remaining five cats. Twelve of the 18 cats with lymphoma also showed evidence of lymphoma affecting other sites, e.g., kidney, liver, lymph node and vertebrae. In the remaining 20 cases (neoplasia other than lymphoma), meningioma was the most common tumour (12 cats; six with single cranial meningioma, two with multiple cranial meningioma, and four with spinal meningioma). There were, in addition, four cases of glioma (one of which had previously been diagnosed as an inflammatory lesion), three cases of sarcoma and one of metastatic carcinoma secondary to a bronchoalveolar carcinoma.",

In one cat with hydrocephalus and an inflammatory infiltrate typical of FIP (Krum et al., 1975) , the original description did not include reference to the inflammatory infiltrate. A second cat was originally reported to have an inflammatory and degenerative lesion of the midbrain and medulla, but on review the lesion was considered to be associated with a pleomorphic tumour (possibly a glioma of the astrocytoma type). The cells were variable in appearance and it would seem were originally interpreted as purely inflammatory. Other cases in which the original and final diagnoses differed were more difficult to interpret. These cats included five in the group with degenerative changes; in these animals the lesion distribution or appearance suggested viral infections such as FIV (Poli et al., 1997) , although gliosis did not appear to be a feature. In addition, there may have been overlap between the inflammatory lesions associated with FIP virus and with other viral agents. Other techniques (e.g., immunohistochemistry) might have helped to classify these cases further.",
