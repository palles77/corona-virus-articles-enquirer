In the aquaculture industry, outbreaks of betanodavirus infection and spread in larval and juvenile fish result in devastating damage and heavy economic loss. Although an urgent need exists to develop drugs that inhibit betanodavirus infection, there have been no reports about anti-betanodavirus drugs. Recently, it was reported that betanodaviruses were detected in the endosomes of infected cells, suggesting that betanodaviruses enter fish cells by endocytosis. This finding prompted us to examine whether blocking this endosomal pathway could provide a target for antiviral drug development. In this study, we examined the inhibitory effect of several lysosomotropic agents against betanodavirus infection in fish E-11 cells. The pres-",

Viruses belonging to the genus Betanodavirus are the causative agents of viral encephalopathy and retinopathy, also known as viral nervous necrosis (VNN). Nodaviruses are small (25-30 nm diameter), spherical, non-enveloped viruses with a genome that is composed of two single-stranded, positive-sense RNA molecules [17] . The larger genomic segment, RNA1 (3.1 Kb), encodes the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) [10, 19, 31] , and the smaller genomic segment, RNA2 (1.4 Kb), encodes the coat protein [20] . It has recently been determined that a subgenomic RNA transcribed from the 3 0 end of RNA1, termed RNA3, encodes a protein, B2. This protein is highly conserved among the betanodaviruses and is an RNAi antagonist [7, 8, 13] .",

Betanodaviruses have been isolated from more than 30 marine fish species from 14 families and are classified into four genotypes based on a phylogenetic analysis of the coat protein sequences. The genotypes are: striped jack nervous necrosis virus (SJNNV), barfin flounder nervous necrosis virus (BFNNV), tiger puffer nervous necrosis virus (TPNNV) and redspotted grouper nervous necrosis virus (RGNNV) [18, 20, 21] . Effective control of betanodavirus infection is urgently needed to reduce the significant economic loss caused by the virus in the fish industry. It is widely accepted that a vaccine capable of preventing VNN would be a major improvement. Partial immunity has been obtained using recombinant betanodavirus coat protein expressed in E. coli [11, 32] . Immunization with virus-like particles (VLPs) of betanodavirus has been reported to induce a protective immune response against VNN [33] . However, in most cases, VNN occurs in larval and juvenile fish that cannot be easily vaccinated due to their small size. Therefore, the development of drugs that inhibit betanodavirus infection is of critical importance. The mechanism of betanodavirus infection is still unclear. An electron-microscopic study of betanodavirus-infected cells suggested that the entry of the betanodavirus into a fish cell line depends on the endocytic pathway [16] .",

The uninfected E-11 cells showed a flat adherent shape (Fig. 1A) , and virus-infected cells showed a typical CPE shape and detached from the dish by 6 days after inoculation (Fig. 1B) . In contrast, when E-11 cells were infected with RGNNV in the presence of NH 4 Cl ( Fig. 1C -E) or chloroquine ( Fig. 1F-H) , the development of CPE was suppressed in a dose-dependent manner. CPE was completely suppressed at a concentration of 1 mM NH 4 Cl (Fig. 1E ) and 1 mM chloroquine (Fig. 1H) , respectively. The effect of NH 4 Cl and chloroquine on viral infection may result from the cytotoxicity of these agents. Therefore, we investigated the cytotoxicity of these agents to E-11 cells by WST-1 assay.

            "text": "To further determine the detailed mechanism of the inhibitory effect of NH 4 Cl and chloroquine, we next analyzed the viral genomic (\u00fe) RNA1 and template (\u00c0) RNA1 accumulation in infected cells. E-11 cells were inoculated with virus in the presence or absence of these agents, and the infected cells were incubated for specific periods of time, and the total RNA was subsequently prepared from the cells. (\u00c0) RNA1 was synthesized from (\u00fe) RNA1 as the replication template; thus the presence of (\u00c0) RNA1 in the cells indicated that the replication of viral genomes had occurred. As shown in Fig. 3A and B, the detection of (\u00fe) RNA1 bands in the control cells gradually increased and reached a maximum level at 18 h post-inoculation. No significant (\u00c0) RNA1 bands were detected in the cells at 1 h post-inoculation, but their intensity gradually increased until 9 h post-inoculation and significantly increased from 9 to 12 h post-inoculation. These data imply that, after attaching to the cell membrane, the betanodavirus enters the cell, and the synthesis of the (\u00c0) RNA1 begins immediately thereafter. No significant (\u00c0) RNA1 bands were detected in cells that were inoculated and cultured in the presence of 1 mM NH 4 Cl or 1 mM chloroquine. In addition, the band intensity of (\u00fe) RNA1 was steady over the sampling period. NH 4 Cl was next added to virus-infected E-11 cells at various times after infection (Fig. 3C) . With the continuous presence of 1 mM NH 4 Cl during the assay, no (\u00fe) RNA1 accumulation was detected in comparison to the control, as shown in panel B. However, a significant accumulation of (\u00fe) RNA1 was detected when NH 4 Cl was added to the cells 1 h after inoculation. When NH 4 Cl was added at 3 h post-inoculation, the amount of (\u00fe) RNA1 that accumulated in the cells was almost equal to the level of (\u00fe) RNA1 in the untreated cells. Taking these results into consideration, NH 4 Cl inhibits an early step of betanodavirus entry into cells and has no effect on viral replication once the virus has entered the cells. At the indicated times after inoculation, total RNA was extracted, and the (\u00fe) RNA1, (\u00c0) RNA1 and 18S rRNA were detected by RT-PCR. (B) The band intensity of RNA1s was normalized and calculated as the relative value of (\u00fe) RNA1 (closed circle) and (\u00c0) RNA1 (open circle) to that of (\u00fe) RNA1 which was seen at 1 h post-inoculation. The data represent the means from two independent experiments. (C) Cells were inoculated with virus and incubated in the presence (gray bar) or absence (open bar) of 1 mM NH 4 Cl throughout the experiment. NH 4 Cl was added to virus-infected cells to a final concentration of 1 mM at the indicated time post-inoculation (black bar). At 12 h postinoculation, total RNA was extracted and subjected to RT-PCR. The band intensity of (\u00fe) RNA1 were normalized and expressed as the ratio of (\u00fe) RNA1 compared to that of the cells that were only infected with virus (only adsorption). The data represent the means and standard deviations from three independent experiments",

At a concentration of 160 mM NH 4 Cl, the number of infectious viruses decreased to about 90% of the control. An almost complete inhibition of virus production was observed when cells were treated with 630 mM NH 4 Cl. Chloroquine had an effect identical to NH 4 Cl on the reduction of virus production (Fig. 4B) . The amount of infectious virus was reduced to less than 5% of the control in the presence of 200 nM chloroquine. Treatment with bafilomycin A1, a lysosomotropic agent that is a specific inhibitor of the vacuolar H \u00fe -ATPase [24] , also showed an inhibitory effect against viral production in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 4C) . No virus-induced CPE was observed with cells that were treated with 1 nM bafi-lomycin A1 for 6 days after inoculation (Table 1 ). In addition, monensin, another lysosomotropic agent, and chlorpromazine also inhibited the development of virus-induced CPE at the concentrations listed in Table 1 . These results strongly suggested that the various lysosomotropic agents could be utilized as inhibitors against betanodavirus infection.",

We utilized these agents because the electron microscopic study by Liu et al. [16] suggested that the entry of betanodavirus into cells depends on the endocytic pathway. We initially used NH 4 Cl and chloroquine to examine whether they can inhibit the development of CPE after betanodavirus infection. Both agents completely inhibited virus-induced CPE at non-cytotoxic concentrations (Fig. 1) . NH 4 Cl and chloroquine had no affect on virus attachment to the cells (Fig. 2C and D) . We also showed that NH 4 Cl inhibited a very early step of infection rather than blocking polymerase activity, since the level of (\u00fe) RNA1 accumulation was not affected when NH 4 Cl was added to the culture medium at 1 h post-inoculation (Fig. 3C) . The effective doses of NH 4 Cl (1 mM) and chloroquine (1 mM) in this experiment were more than 10-fold lower than those used for other viruses [1, 2, 15, 29] . The infection of betanodavirus was also inhibited by bafilomycin A1 and monensin ( Fig. 4 and Table 1 ), thus confirming that lysosomotropic agents can be useful for the prevention of betanodavirus infection. Chloroquine, first synthesized as an anti-malarial drug, has been shown to have an antiviral effect on a wide range of viruses, including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) [25, 27] , influenza virus [23] , and the SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) [4] . As for the enveloped viruses, chloroquine and NH 4 Cl inhibit the glycosylation of viral envelope proteins [34] , the transportation of glycoprotein to the plasma membrane [6, 9] , and the envelopment of viral nucleocapsids [14] . It has also been suggested that the terminal glycosylation of angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2), a functional receptor of SARS-CoV, is inhibited by chloroquine and NH 4 Cl [34] .",

Our data suggested that the inhibitory effect against an early step of betanodavirus infection (binding to the cell surface) was not affected by the agents (Fig. 2C and D) . Feline calicivirus (FCV), a member of the family Caliciviridae and a non-enveloped virus, also requires the acidification in endosomes for its entry pathway [29] . The a2,6-linked sialic acid present on an N-linked glycoprotein acts as a receptor for FCV infection [30] , and it has been suggested that the inhibitory mechanism of chloroquine against FCV entry into the cells is not due to a defect of the functional cellular receptor [29] .",

This agent is a cationic, amphiphilic molecule that inhibits viral infection by shifting clathrin and the AP-2 complex to the late endosomal compartment [28, 36] . Many non-enveloped viruses have been shown to use the clathrin-mediated endocytic route to infect cells [3, 5, 35] , and this pathway requires an acidic environment in the endosomes. Further detailed experiments are needed to clarify the mechanism of the endocytic pathway utilized in betanodavirus infection.",
