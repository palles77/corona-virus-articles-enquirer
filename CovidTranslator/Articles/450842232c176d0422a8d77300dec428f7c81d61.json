A 0.24 \u00d7 0.10 \u00d7 0.08 mm colorless block of compound 6 was mounted on a Cryoloop with Paratone \u00ae oil. Data were collected in a nitrogen gas stream at 100(2) K using \uf066 and \uf076 scans. The diffractometer was a Bruker Ultra D8 platform equipped with a rotating-anode source and microfocus optics. The crystal-to-detector distance was 50 mm, and exposure time was 5 s/frame using a scan width of 0.5\u00b0. Data collection was 96.2% complete to 28.3\u00b0 in \uf071. A total of 6610 reflections were collected covering the indices, -6 \u2264 h \u2264 3, -13 \u2264 k \u2264 21, -27 \u2264 l \u2264 31. 4213 reflections were found to be symmetry independent, with a R int of 0.0444. Indexing and unit cell refinement indicated a primitive, orthorhombic lattice. The space group was found to be P2 1 2 1 2 1 . The data were integrated using the Bruker SAINT software program and scaled using the SADABS software program. Solution by direct methods (SHELXS) produced a complete phasing model consistent with the proposed structure. All nonhydrogen atoms were refined anisotropically by full-matrix least-squares (SHELXL-13). All hydrogen atoms were placed using a riding model. Their positions were constrained relative to their parent atom using the appropriate HFIX command in SHELXL-13. The absolute stereochemistry of compound 6 is unambiguous.
