Elimination of the most-fit 49 members of the viral population by an antiviral agent requires that resistance emerge from the 50 surviving, low-fitness member of the population, which would ultimately require restoration of 51 fitness for the population to survive the myriad mechanisms of host restriction (Andino and 52 All rights reserved.

We describe a microfluidics device that can be used to produce complete dose-57 response curves. We have used this device to compare three, mechanistically-distinct classes of 58 antiviral agents: a PV polymerase inhibitor (2'-C-methyl-adenosine, 2'-C-Me-A); a PV protease 59 inhibitor (rupintrivir); and two HSP90 inhibitors (geldanamycin, GA, and ganetespib, GS). We 60 find that single-cell analysis distinguishes these classes of inhibitors.

The long-term utility of an antiviral therapy is 215 determined, in part, by the time required for resistance mutants to emerge. One approach to 216 delaying or even eliminating the emergence of drug-resistant mutants is the use of antiviral 217 combinations (Dunning et al., 2014; Hofmann et al., 2009) . What is often evaluated is the ability 218 of two drugs to exhibit greater efficacy (synergy) in preventing infection in combination than 219 observed when either drug is used alone. We evaluated the ability of 2'-C-Me-A to synergize 220 with GA by treating cells with the concentrations of one or both at their IC50 values (Fig. 4a) . In 221 the absence of drug, 34 \u00b1 3% of cells in the device were infected. That number was reduced to 18 222 \u00b1 2%, 30 \u00b1 3%, or 15 \u00b1 3% in the presence of 2'-C-Me-A, GA, or the combination thereof, 223",

The resolution afforded by this 296 approach is unprecedented when compared to other cell-based approaches, which only provide a 297 measure of efficacy. Given the substantial effort required to go from compound to mechanism 298 using the traditional experimental paradigm, the ability of single-cell analysis to inform 299 mechanism should make this approach a welcome addition to the drug discovery and 300 development toolbox. It is not uncommon for analogues to be synthesized during the drug-301 development process that lose specificity or even function by a different mechanism of action, 302 single-cell analysis has the potential to reveal changes such as these at the start of the analysis 303 instead of much, much later in the development process. Finally, although we have used antiviral 304 agents to demonstrate the power of single-cell analysis, use of this technology and approach will 305 All rights reserved.

Infection outcomes in cells are determined, in part, by stochastic processes (Heldt et al., 261 2015). For example, the presence and abundance of viral-restriction factors and viral-replication-262 promoting factors of the host are largely governed by stochastic gene expression (Raj and van 263 Oudenaarden, 2008). As a result, substantial between-cell variation exists in all quantifiable 264 parameters of infection. An underappreciated consequence of the behavior of systems such as 265 these is the non-self-averaging nature of these systems, which means that the population average 266 of any single-cell parameter will almost certainly fail to represent the dynamics within any single 267 cell (Derrida, 1997; Wiseman and Domany, 1998). The practical complication arising from this 268 phenomenon is that changes in the average kinetics observed in a growth curve for a virus caused 269 by a perturbation, for example exposure to an antiviral therapeutic, will not inform accurately the 270 step(s) of the viral lifecycle impacted most by the perturbation. 271 With this perspective in mind, it is not surprising that our previous evaluation of an 272 antiviral ribonucleotide using a single-cell approach revealed the unexpected finding that the 273 most-fit members of the viral population were most susceptible to this class of compounds (Guo 274 et al., 2017). This observation left one major unresolved question: do all effective antiviral 275 therapeutics target the same subpopulation of viruses or do unique signatures exist for distinct 276 mechanistic classes of antiviral therapeutics? Addressing these questions is the central objective 277 of this study. 278",
