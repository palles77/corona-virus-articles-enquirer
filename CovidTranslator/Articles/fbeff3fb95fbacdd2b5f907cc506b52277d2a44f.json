Estimates for exposure to non-SARS coronaviruses are high, particularly for 229E and OC43; however, less information regarding seroprevalence is available for HKU1 and NL63. To measure exposure rates to these four coronavirus strains (229E, HKU1, NL63, and OC43), we devised an immunoassay based on amino-and carboxy-terminally tagged recombinant coronavirus nucleocapsid antigens. Four human and one feline coronavirus antigen were cloned into baculoviruses expressed in insect cells and recovered proteins bound in the solid phase of an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay-based system. We screened sera from 10 children and 196 adults and established primary cutoff points based on immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody levels of the predominantly seronegative children. The proportion of seropositive adults for each coronavirus was as follows: 229E, 91.3%; HKU1, 59.2%; NL63, 91.8%; and OC43, 90.8%. No evidence of a significant serological response to the feline coronavirus was observed. Significant associations of coronavirus seropositivity and antibody levels with age, gender, race, socioeconomic status, smoking status, and season of the blood draw were tested with chi-square and regression analyses. The group II coronaviruses (OC43 and HKU1) were significantly associated with race (P < 0.009 and P < 0.03, respectively). Elevated OC43 IgG levels were further significantly associated with smoking status (P < 0.03), as were high NL63 titers with socioeconomic status (P < 0.04). The high-level immunoreactivity of each coronavirus was significantly associated with the summer season (P < 0.01 to 0.0001). In summary, high rates of exposure to 229E, NL63, and OC43 and a moderate rate of exposure to HKU1 characterized the seroprevalence among individuals in this population. Demographic factors, such as race, smoking status, and socioeconomic status, may confer an increased risk of susceptibility to these viruses.",

We prepared recombinant nucleocapsid antigens following baculovirus cloning and expression in insect cell cultures and used these proteins to devise novel enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) specific for the target coronavirus antigens. With these assays, we quantified antibody levels in a group of 196 generally healthy individuals.

Nucleotide sequences encoding nucleocapsid proteins of the human coronaviruses 229E, HKU1, NL63, and OC43 and a feline coronavirus were synthesized with codon optimization for insect cell expression (Genscript Corporation, Piscataway, NJ). The corresponding GenBank coronavirus nucleocapsid gene and protein accession numbers, respectively, are as follows: NL63, NC_005831 and YP_003771.1; OC43, NC_005147 and NP_937954.1; 229E, NC_002645 and NP_073556.1; and HKU1, NC_006577 and YP_173242.1. Insect cell codon-optimized sequences were cloned into a modified pAB-GST baculovirus transfer vector (AB Vector, San Diego, CA) as previously described (22) . The pAB-GST vector was mutated to incorporate a 3\u0408 60-nucleotide sequence tag encoding a bovine polyomavirus (BPV) large T antigen peptide. Plasmid constructs were recombined with Pro-Easy linearized baculovirus DNA (AB Vector) and recombinant baculoviruses passaged in sf9 insect cells (Orbigen, San Diego, CA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Coronavirus nucleocapsid proteins were expressed in Trichoplusia ni (High Five) insect cells (Orbigen) as glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins. To confirm the fusion protein expression, cell lysates were analyzed by immunoblotting using standard methodology. Total protein concentrations were determined using a Bradford-based total protein assay, and 1-g amounts were loaded on a precast 2 to 40% gradient Tris-HCl polyacrylamide Criterion gel (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). An anti-GST-horseradish peroxidaseconjugated polyclonal antibody (pAb) (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ) was used to verify that expressed antigens contained amino-terminal GST tags and would be properly bound in the solid phase of the ELISA. A pAb against the 20-aminoacid BPV peptide tag was used to detect the presence of carboxy termini and to verify the expression of full-length coronavirus nucleocapsid proteins. This pAb was prepared by immunizing rabbits with the BPV peptide (HNYNLYKSLKN TEEVGKKRY) and isolated using standard methodology. We also probed immunoblots with an anti-OC43 nucleocapsid-specific monoclonal antibody (Millipore, Temecula, CA). Blots were screened with study sera from several representative individuals to determine if coronavirus immunoglobulin G antibodies were present and to what degree antibodies would bind to expressed fusion proteins. The control antigens used in all immunoblots included the feline coronavirus and insect cell lysate with and without empty pAB-GST and pAB-GST-BPV vectors.",

Our estimates support previously reported seroprevalence rates for 229E (53 to 100%) and OC43 (88 to 100%) (6, 10, 15) . Until now, seroprevalence rates of the more newly discovered viruses NL63 and HKU1, particularly in asymptomatic adult controls, generally have been lacking. Our results suggest that exposures to HKU1 are less common for unknown reasons, whereas NL63 exposures are as frequent as 229E and OC43 exposures. The lack of a detectable increase in antibodies to the feline coronavirus, which is not thought to infect humans, indicates that we are not measuring a nonspecific antibody response.",

            "text": "In our demographic analyses, race, socioeconomic status, and smoking status were all identified as risk factors for coronavirus exposure. Higher rates of seropositivity were observed in African Americans, smokers, and individuals of low socioeconomic status. All three of these risk factors have been previously shown to render individuals more prone to a variety of respiratory illnesses (2, 5, 11). The demographic factor as- sociations were particularly evident in individuals with higher antibody titers, suggesting that these risk factors are linked to recent infections. Similarly, higher antibody levels were significantly associated with the season of the blood draw, and the highest coronavirus immunoreactivity occurred during the summer months. It is possible that in this population of adults and especially in those individuals deemed at risk, these summer bouts could represent either a persistent infection or a reinfection with the same coronavirus strain (1). Amino acid identity among the four coronavirus nucleocapsids is overall generally low (35.4 to 68.2%), thus making the nucleocapsid protein a useful strain-specific diagnostic antigen (8) . Nevertheless, defining the extent of the cross-reactivity among the coronavirus nucleocapsids remains an ongoing issue. Recent results regarding the degree of cross-reactivity between the SARS nucleocapsids and each of the non-SARS nucleocapsids (8, 12) are mixed, and in these studies, it was not possible to assess the degree of cross-reactivity among the non-SARS strains. Our study was not designed specifically to test cross-reactivity; however, the correlation between the antibody levels of different strains was evident, with the expected highest association observed between viruses within the same phylogenetic group (i.e., between NL63 and 229E [group I] and between OC43 and HKU1 [group II]). The cross-reactivity between group I strains has previously been suggested in a serological study of NL63 and 229E in children and young adults (17) . In this study, portions of the nucleocapsid genes were expressed and certain amino acid regions of the NL63 recombinant proteins were detected by 229E antisera in Western blots. Although our use of the whole nucleocapsid sequence may have contributed to a certain degree of crossreactivity, the absence of reactivity to the feline coronavirus nucleocapsid indicates that genus-and group-specific crossreactivity cannot completely explain the correlation between antibody levels to the different human coronavirus strains. Because the feline virus is more closely related to NL63 and 229E than to OC43 and HKU1, the correlation observed between the group I and group II coronaviruses is likely to reflect a shared exposure rather than cross-reactivity. In our study, we also have evidence for intragroup monospecificity of individual strains. For example, 32% of the 196 individuals who were seropositive for OC43 were seronegative for HKU1. With re- spect to the group I viruses, 5.6% of individuals were seropositive for either NL63 or 229E but not for both. The extent of the cross-reactivity to the nucleocapsid proteins of human coronaviruses will need to be addressed in future studies by competitive inhibition experiments with purified nucleocapsid proteins. Documenting relative levels of seroprevalence of coronavirus strains is important, particularly given the recent emergence of the SARS virus as a serious pathogen. The assay that we have developed is a straightforward and sensitive means of tracking the four known human non-SARS coronaviruses, and its application will likely benefit epidemiological studies of these viruses.",
