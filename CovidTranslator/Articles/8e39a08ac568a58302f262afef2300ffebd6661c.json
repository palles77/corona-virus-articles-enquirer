Variables in the NT include the challenge dose of virus and the incubation temperature of the virus-serum mixture prior to inoculation. The latter is important because infectivity of some viruses is reduced or lost by incubation at 37\u00b0C. Tests may be quantitative, in which pocks, plaques or fluorescent foci are counted, or semi-quantitative, in which endpoints are calculated from the proportion of hosts showing signs of infection after inoculation with virus-serum mixtures. In addition, the NT may use variable virus concentrations mixed with a constant concentration of serum or a single virus concentration mixed with serial dilutions of serum. The former method is relatively insensitive for demonstrating low concentrations of neutralizing antibody and requires volumes of serum that may not be available from small species such as mice. The latter method is more sensitive and requires smaller quantities of reagents. The NT may be used in those situations requiring differentiation among strains of virus (7).",

            "text": "The HAI test has traditonally been used for serosurveys because it is easy to perform. Sera to be tested for antibody to minute virus of mice (MVM) by HAI must be pre-treated to remove nonspecific inhibitors. If guinea pig erythrocytes are used in the HAI test, pre-treated sera may still yield reactions that cannot be confirmed using other test methods (10, reviewed in 3). Use of mouse erythrocytes reduces, but does not eliminate, this problem. IFA and ELISA have the advantage of detecting antibody to crossreactive antigens, so MVM antigen may be used to detect antibody to the rat parvoviruses, rat virus (RV) and H-l virus, as well as to homologous virus. The reactivity in IFA between MVM and the rat parvoviruses is not reciprocal in that the antigens of the Kilham strain of RV or of H-l virus do not detect MVM antibody (17) . An IFA test and commercial ELISA were equally sensitive for detecting MVM antibody in sera of mice experimentally infected with homologous virus (10).",

Ranking is based on relative sensitivities, specificities, labor intensity and cost. ELISA and IFA are grouped together because they are approximately equal in sensitivity and the choice of test may depend on the number of sera to be evaluated in a single test. VII.

            "text": "Our experience in serological monitoring of rodent colonies confirms what Dr. Smith has mentioned. We want to share our results with you.Sera from mouse and rat colonies known to be infected with different viruses were tested either by hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) test and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) or by indirect immunoflourescence assay (IFA) and ELISA.Antibody titers by ELISA for pneumonia virus of mice (PVM), Sendai virus, reovirus 3, minute virus of mice (MVM) and Theiler 1 s mouse encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV) were approximately five dilution steps higher than titers by HAI test.However, the most important result for rodent seromonitoring was the distinct increase in positive results by ELISA in comparison to HAI results. Twenty-four of 126 sera from PVM infected colonies were negative by HAI test but were positive by ELISA. Similar results were obtained for Sendai virus, reovirus 3, MVM and TMEV infected colonies (TABLE I) .We also compared IFA and ELISA to determine if IFA can be a suitable alternative to ELISA.Sera from infected colonies were tested by both methods for antibodies to mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), TMEV, MVM, PVM, and M. pulmonis. Antibody titers by ELISA were one to two dilution steps higher by ELISA for TMEV and PVM but the sensitivity of the tests was equal in our laboratory.Thus, in summary, the ELISA and the indirect IFA test detected up to 30% more positive reactions in naturallly infected murine colonies than did the HAI test. It is obvious that the use of these tests may improve the reliability of murine seromonitoring. Hazards for animals and bioassays can be detected earlier and smaller volumes of sera are required than for the HAI or CF tests. It will be useful to be able to use both ELISA and IFA in routine laboratory tests. This offers the possibility of confirming borderline reactions by an alternative s\u00e9rologie method.",
