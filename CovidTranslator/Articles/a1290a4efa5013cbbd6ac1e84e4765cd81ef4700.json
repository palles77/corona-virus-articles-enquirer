Sails were used in ships transporting goods; cushions and curtains were used in carriages or trains for the comfort of passengers; and airplane wings were made out of woven canvas for instance. The evolution of each means of transportation along with the increased awareness about the importance of passengers' safety pushed research and development forward towards a larger use of lightweight, fire-resistant, nontoxic, and durable textiles in transportation.",

One of these twelve areas-which also include Agrotech, Buildtech, Medtech, and Oekotech-is Mobiltech symbolized by a tire symbol, which covers textiles for ship and aircraft construction as well as all aspects of automobile, railway, and space travel. The Mobiltech sector is in full growth due to the rapid development of all means of transportation and increased safety requirements for passengers (Bertrand, 2005) . For instance, the need for fire-retardant materials in the case of a plane or train crash or a car accident is critical to limit the rate of ignition of fabrics and flame propagation; the extra time it will give passengers to exit the wreck will definitely increase their chances of survival. reinforcements, filters, fiber-reinforced composites, thermal and acoustic insulators, etc. They are used in cars; in recreational vehicles such as motorcycles, snowmobiles, campers, and quads; in public transportation such as buses and streetcars; and in commercial vehicles such as trucks, fire trucks, ambulances, army vehicles, and construction trucks. Textile exports, when considered separately from clothing, accounted for $314 billion in 2014 (WTO, 2015) .",

But even though the introduction of mandatory seatbelts and the presence of life vests under the seats have contributed to saving many lives, the presence of synthetic fabrics in airplanes has also been the cause of many deaths. According to a study led by the National Transportation Safety Board on 26 plane crashes that occurred between 1983 and 2000, among the 45% passengers who did not survive the accidents, 26% lost their lives because of the violence of the impact while almost 5% died of fire-related causes (NTSB, 2001) . In addition, it was observed that, in crashes with a higher survivability rate after impact, the rate of fire-related causalities was higher. As a matter of fact, many polymers used in seats, curtains, cushions, carpets, etc. do not display a high enough flame retardancy and/or they generate toxic fumes while burning (Bertrand, 2005) .",

The objective is to reduce the overall weight of the structure and cut fuel consumption. These materials also require less maintenance thanks to the larger resistance to corrosion. However, the cost of the carbon fiber raw material is still higher than steel or aluminum, for instance, despite the twofold drop over the last decade made possible by the increased production volume and the development of new manufacturing processes. Carbon fiber-reinforced composites are gaining ground and becoming competitive thanks to the reduction in defects and cycle time as well as the development of new resin systems and new fiber placement and composite manufacturing processes (Rao, Simha, Rao, & Ravi Kumar, 2015) ; this provides interesting perspectives for aircraft manufacturers willing to push innovation forward in this sector of industry.",

As a complement to seatbelts, the presence of airbags is now considered as a key factor for survival during a crash. Airbags are controlled by a central unit which monitors a series of sensors, including accelerometers that can detect variations in the vehicle speed indicative of a crash. Due to the forces involved and the speed of the airbag deployment and inflation, it has to be constructed out of very high strength fabrics so that it does not explode, distort, or tear during the two most critical phases of its action: inflation and impact of the body. The airbag has thus to be designed so that it does not fail catastrophically, doesn't allow tear propagation, and includes very high safety factors.",

Lap or 2-point seat belts became compulsory in Europe for front car seats in 1965. A further improvement was the introduction of 3-point seat belts that restrain the motion of the chest toward the steering wheel or the front panel, which proved to be fatal in many cases: They are now mandatory in front and back seats of cars in many countries and are also used in a series of other road vehicles such as trucks and in the front seats of other commercial vehicles such as buses and ambulances. Lap seat belts are still found in buses and aircrafts for passenger seats. In the case of child safety seats as well as for aircraft and racing car pilots for instance, 4-, 5-, or 6-point seat belts are used with additional buckling belts over the other shoulder and between the legs. Current 3-point seat belt systems comprise a piece of webbing, a retractor, a pillar-loop, a tongue, a buckle, and a 3rd point anchor. The webbing is generally a multiple layer woven made of high-tenacity continuous filament polyester yarns (Fung & Hardcastle, 2001) . It has to have very high strength and good abrasion resistance, be soft and flexible in the longitudinal direction and rigid in the transverse direction, and resist UV degradation.",

For instance, Europe refers to ECE R16 (restraints and safety belts) and ECE R44 (child restraints in power driven vehicles), while requirements for seat belts used in the United States are provided in FMVSS 208 (occupant crash protection), FMVSS 209 (seat belt assemblies), FMVSS 210 (anchorages for seat belt assemblies), and FMVSS 213 (child restraint system).

Computer aided design (CAD) will help model the component and choose the raw materials. It is also used for running virtual failure analysis through a failure mode and effects analysis (FMEA) and constraint accumulation calculation by finite elements analysis (FEA).

W. Thompson, pneumatic tires take advantage of the exceptional performance of vulcanized rubber (Fung & Hardcastle, 2001) . A Scottish-born veterinary surgeon, John Boyd Dunlop, rediscovered pneumatic tires at the end of the nineteenth century while trying to improve the rolling comfort of his son's tricycle. His design involved the use of a fabric as reinforcement for the rubber. Another large step was made in 1946 by Michelin, who invented the radial tire method of construction. The more stable structure it produces allows a large increase in the tire longevity, driving safety, and fuel efficiency compared to the original cross-ply construction. They now have taken over most of the passenger road vehicle market, and the use of cross-ply tires is limited to some applications for trucks, trailers, farm equipment, and emerging markets (Lindenmuth, 2006) .",

The amount of textile in cross-ply tires is larger with about 21% (Fung & Hardcastle, 2001) . Textiles in radial carcasses are primarily composed of polyester, while they are mostly nylon for cross-ply structures (McDonel, 2006) . Aramids are also used when high strength-to-weight ratio and temperature resistance are required, for instance, in aircrafts and racing cars (Fung & Hardcastle, 2001) . A small amount of aramid and nylon may be found as well in belt overlays (McDonel, 2006) . Other tire components include natural and synthetic rubber, reinforcing fillers such as carbon black and silica, and various additives including vulcanization agents, plasticizers, stabilizers, antioxidants, and antiozonants (Lindenmuth, 2006) . Some tests are performed on the whole tire structure as described for instance in the US Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS 139) or in its European counterpart (EC 661, 2009 ). In the case of pneumatic tires, they cover the tire dimensions, high speed performance, endurance, low inflation pressure performance, and strength. In addition, the tire textile components may also be tested at the yarn, cord, and fabric scale (ASTM D885, 2010). ",

They are generally made with high-tenacity polyamide, polyester, or polypropylene multifilament. A series of European standards cover the safety aspects of textile slings: flat woven webbing slings made of manmade fibers (EN 1492-1, 2008) , roundslings made of manmade fibers (EN 1492 (EN -2, 2008 , and lifting slings made from natural and manmade fiber ropes (EN 1492 (EN -4, 2008 . A fourth standard for disposable flat woven slings is in preparation. Properties and performance of slings assessed in these standards comprise the type of polymer and yarn; the webbing construction, width, thickness, and tenacity; the change in webbing width under load; the working load limit and minimum failure force; and the interaction of the sling with fittings. A description of requirements and test methods may also be found in ASME B30.9 (2010) for slings used in conjunction with cranes and ANSI B77.1a (2012) for passenger ropeways (aerial tramways, aerial lifts, surface lifts, tows and conveyors), for instance.",

Further, with respect to cars, large concerns have also been raised about the air quality inside the passenger compartment (Fung & Hardcastle, 2001 ). Indeed, research has shown that, because of the tunnel effect, the exhaust gas concentration inside a car may be six times higher than outside. This phenomenon is amplified when a car is driven as a closed distance from the preceding one. The question of inside air filtration is also critical in public transportation, especially for long distance travel segments (Santos O'Connor, 2012) . Cabin air filters may combine three mechanisms (Fung & Hardcastle, 2001) : mechanical filtration of the solid particles through the pores of the nonwoven, electrostatic attraction of the solid particles on the charged nonwoven fibers, and adsorption of gases and removal of odors by activated carbon granules distributed across the nonwoven filter.",

In the latter case, it has to slowly migrate towards the fiber surface to provide its function during use. Finishing treatments may use conventional exhaust and pad-dry-cure methods as well as newly developed padding, spraying, coating, foam finishing, and microencapsulation techniques. For instance, silver nanoparticles have recently generated interest because they appear as a more health and environmentally friendly antimicrobial alternative to halogenated phenols such as triclosan. In addition, bacteria are less prone to develop resistance to silver nanoparticles than conventional antibiotics (Chernousova & Epple, 2013) . Other strategies involve the use of natural compounds such as chitosan to limit the occurrence of side effects on health and the environment (Lim & Hudson, 2004) .",

This has allowed Airbus to save 20% in mass compared to aluminum and 25% in fuel consumption. It has also seen a strong improvement in the resistance of parts to corrosion and fatigue. The Aston Martin One-77 structural core is made of a carbon fiber composite monocoque, making the car weight only 1500 kg (Aston Martin, 2008) . In railway applications, Alstom teamed up with France's national railways (SNCF) to develop train noses made of carbon fiber reinforced composite in order to reduce the overall weight and improve the aerodynamics of high speed trains (Mason, 2004) . However, all of these composite parts have to go through intense testing in order to fulfill the requirements on which the passengers' lives depend. These may be conducted at the preform and/or composite stage and may involve destructive and nondestructive test methods.",

They may be used directly, for instance, in filament winding or fiber placement processes. They may also be transformed into more complex textile structures such as wovens, knits, and braids with anisotropic properties in all three directions. On the other hand, nonwovens or mats are manufactured directly using fibers or chopped strands that are more or less randomly distributed in the plane of the structure. Recently, noncrimp fabrics (NCF) have been developed to combine the strength and perfect fiber placement of wovens with the flexibility, ease of manufacture, and absence of fiber crimp of nonwovens (Schnabel & Gries, 2011) . The 2-D sheet materials may then be assembled by stitching, Z-pinning, or tufting, for instance, to create complex shaped, 3-D structures that will be cut to shape to be fitted in the composite part mold (Mouritz, 2011) . Near net-shape preforms may also be prepared directly using 3-D textile manufacturing techniques, which include 3-D interlock and orthogonal noncrimp weaving as well as 3-D braiding. This allows improving the pace of the process and the quality of the composite. The 2-D reinforcements and 3-D preforms may also be delivered as prepregs, i.e., with the textile being coated with the resin only partially cured (Strong, 2008) . Prepregs need to be stored in cold conditions to prevent premature complete polymerization.",

For instance, some polymers like polyolefins are prone to thermo-and photooxidation degradation, while polyester and polyamide are especially sensitive to hydrolysis and polyvinylchloride may discolor and become brittle at high temperatures (Verdu, 1984) . Polymers and natural fibers may also be degraded by microorganisms. The resistance of textiles and textile-based materials to heat, moisture, water spray, and UV aging is usually tested using conditions that accelerate the aging process to reduce the duration of the test. Weathering programs simulating climatic conditions to which the material is likely to be subjected in service will combine cycles with variations in temperature, water, and/or radiation conditions. Resistance to microorganisms may also be assessed to evaluate the effect of bacteria, mildew, and rot. The durability is generally characterized in terms of color change as well as effect on mechanical and other physical properties. Table 14 .7 provides a list of test methods used in the transportation industry to characterize the resistance of materials to environmental aging.

The damage may come during the manufacture of the woven or braided structure for instance as well as during use. One typical example is the cyclic fatigue experienced by a tire cord. In addition to the mechanical stress mode and conditions of application (frequency, amplitude, offset, etc.), other parameters may affect the fatigue failure of a fiber: its composition and manufacturing process/conditions, its dimensions, the presence of impurities, its environment (temperature, humidity, UV, pH, bacteria), etc. The measurement is conducted by applying cyclic loading conditions in a specified environmental.

As a result, green fabrics and composites are becoming an interesting alternative to many synthetic products, with the use of natural fibers, biosourced resins, and nontoxic and biodegradable dyes and finishes (Chard, Creech, Jesson, & Smith, 2013) . It also pushes research forward into the reduction of greenhouse gases through the development of new lightweight and durable materials in transportation.",

Indeed, in addition to their low cost, they display a low density which can lead to reduced energy consumption as well as competitive specific mechanical properties. They are also biodegradable. In the automotive industry, for instance, jute was used by Mercedes-Benz in 1996 for its E-class vehicle door panels (Koronis, Silva, & Fontul, 2013) . A blend of flax and sisal later found its way as reinforcement into Audi's 2000 A2 midrange car door trim panels; kenaf in Toyota's 2003 spare tire cover; bamboo fibers in Mitsubishi Motors' interior components; and wheat straw in Ford 2010 Flex crossover vehicle storage bin and inner lid. Natural fibers are now considered for more high-performance applications thanks to improvements in their compatibility with polymer matrices (Pickering, Efendy, & Le, 2016) . For instance, a green hydrophobic treatment based on zinc oxide nanorods and stearic acid was developed for recycled jute fibers (Arfaoui, Dolez, Dub\u00e9, & David, 2017) . However some issues remain, including the inherence variability in their physical properties as well as their poor moisture resistance and limited thermal stability (Koronis et al., 2013) . This thus requires some adjustments in testing programs to ensure that they perform as required by the application. It may be noted that, to the authors' knowledge, natural fiber-based textiles have not found an application in transportation by themselves, i.e., without being combined with a polymer matrix. This may be eventually attributed to their short life resulting from their biodegradability.",
