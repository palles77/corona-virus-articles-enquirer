Scientific evidence has to be a key element in making this decision, and it has to be based on the available data. A reckless decision could do enormous harm to the national economy, which in Chile is already crippled by the social outburst of October 2019. However, acting too late is likely to imply a large number of causalities, or producing an even harder sociopolitical scenario. The long delay between the enforcement of measures and their repercussion in the infection rate makes taking the right decision even more difficult.",

In * Center for the Development of Nanoscience and Nanotechnology \u2020 m.kiwi.t@gmail.com and rafael.gonzalez@umayor.cl the COVID-19 pandemic, the bottleneck of the healthcare system is given by the number of beds available for intensive care (ICU). The number of ICU beds in Chile is not entirely certain, but it could be estimated to 1000 beds [1] (or \u223c 5.3 ICU per 100.000 inhabitants). Of those, we can expect a steady-state occupancy of 75%; this is the average of the usual hospital beds occupied in the OECD [2] . Due to the exponential growth of the infection, a lower value (i.e., a 50% or a 30% occupancy) does not make much difference. Therefore, for this study, we are going to consider the currently available capacity of the Chilean healthcare system for COVID-19 patients is \u223c 250 ICU beds. As we will show later, a higher number of ICU beds can be assumed, for example, similar to the case of Belgium, but the scenario is still quite worrying.",

When this index reaches 1.0 (the Burnout Limit) the healthcare system is at its local limit. A value larger than 1.0 reflects, approximately, how many extra ICU and medical professionals are needed relative to the regular healthcare system situation (75% occupancy). The important message is to keep the COVID-19 burden index below unity. For values above one doctors will surely find themselves in the difficult humanitarian dilemma of who to care for, or even worse, who to save.",

The results are consistent with what is expected; the worst affected countries, i.e., Italy, Iran, and Spain score 4.6, 3.6, and 3.6 in the last day considered for this report. UK and Germany are about to reach their limit. Germany has maintained a controlled COVID-19 Burden index for 16 days; that is, it has maintained its health system without collapsing. But 16 days below the burnout limit may be insufficient, if they do not manage to reduce the rate, it spreads urgently. Although the disease is overcome on average in 2 weeks, critically ill patients take between 3 and 6 weeks [9] , so Germany seems still far from overcoming the emergency. The UK case is very worrying because it could collapse very quickly if it does not reduce the rate of infections as soon as 2 or 3 days, or they could face the worst-case scenario. South Korea is on its limit, its healthcare system is fully occupied and strained, but it is copping with the demand. Finally, USA and Chile are steadily approaching the limits of their healthcare systems; in about one week, they might not be able to cope with the demand if they don't reduce the rate of contagion right now. An under/over estimate of the parameters used could mean at most one or two days in reaching the burnout limit. Close to reaching this limit, the fatality of COVID-19 increases drastically, see Fig. 2 .",

Then, at intermediate stages -when around the 500 detected cases is reached-the slope of the COVID-19 burden index is nearly the same.

Our recommendation, for any country that is still in time, is to stay under the burnout point (1.0) as South Korea achieved. As we will show below, this can make a difference in reducing the number of deaths, when compared to the Italian crisis by about 10 times, using the preliminary data from South Korea, or even up to about 20 times as preliminary data from Germany. Finally, the marked difference, between 3 clear stages (or more in the case of South Korea) makes a prediction of the spread of COVID-19 inaccurate using standard methods, such as a regression of early contagious data (see Fig. 3 ).",

The case fatality rate (CFR), defined as the percentage of death from confirmed COVID-19 cases, changes day to day, and cannot be determined with certainty, and our data are no reference. However, on the basis of the data available on March 23, it is around 4,3%. This is in sharp contrast with South Korea, with over 8,000 cases and about 1% CFR. However, Spain and Italy, with their collapsed healthcare systems, report around 6 and 9%, respectively. Germany has not overcome the emergency and must take extreme measures. In any case, having today a similar number of confirmed infections than those of Spain, and after a similar time since they both exceeded 500 cases, it has a CFR of less than 0.5%, which seems encouraging.",

In this analysis, we have tried to avoid any bias, sticking to the available data [8] . We believe that the COVID-19 burden index is a simple and solid tool to warn the authorities and decision-makers about the dangers of COVID-19. If the COVID-19 burden index reaches values close to 1.0 the collapse of the healthcare system is imminent, and harsh measures are in need to avoid a drastic increase in causalities.",

The US has 17 times more population than Chile, and 100 times more ICU beds, but there is no guarantee of avoiding collapse (see Fig. 1 ). The only way to avoid collapse is by reducing the contagion rate as early as possible. By March 23, the slope of the COVID-19 burden index of USA is similar to South Korea in Day 2 (see Fig. 1 ). South Korea shortly afterward decreased the slope of the curve, avoiding the burnout limit. The same could happen in USA, but it will depend on the measures taken in the previous weeks.",
