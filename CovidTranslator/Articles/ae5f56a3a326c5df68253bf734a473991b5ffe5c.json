A major breakthrough took place in the 1970s when Carl Woese [2] and coworkers aligned the small subunit ribosomal RNA (SSU rRNA) sequences to infer phylogenetic relations. The recognition of Archaea as a third domain of life in addition to Bacteria and Eukarya and the support to the endosymbiotic origin of chloro plasts and mitochondria were the main achievements along this line. Databases of rRNAs have been established [3, 4] to facilitate SSU rRNA based molecular phylogeny. Even the second edition of the Bergey's Manual of Systematic Bacteriology followed \"a phylogenetic framework based on analysis of the nucleotide sequence of the SSU rRNA, rather than a phenotypic structure\" (see George Garrity's Preface to ref. [5] ).",

These sequences of about 1500 nucleotides may not contain enough phylogenetic information to resolve all branchings on the tree of life. There was evidence that even these conserved RNAs might be horizontally transferred [6, 7] . Moreover, the inpouring of complete prokaryote genomes since 1995 has brought about more problems than clarifications in molecular phylogeny. For example, it is a consensus now that different genes may tell different stories and a gene tree cannot be equated to the species tree. In particular, the implications of lateral gene transfer and lineage-dependent gene loss on molecular phylogenetics have become a subject of hot debate [8, 9] . In order to make use of the ever increasing genomic data many \"whole-genome\" methods have been suggested (for a review see, e.g., refs. [10, 11] ). In between the two extremes of using single genes or whole genomes it has also been proposed to base the trees on combinations of protein sequences [12] . Nevertheless, all these methods need sequence alignments and scoring schemes explicitly or implicitly at one or another stage thus depend on many parameters and fine adjustments.",

The new approach has been successfully applied to the study of prokaryotes [13] , chloroplasts [14] and coronaviruses [15] . On the other hand, the use of whole genome data might be considered as a demerit of the method. Therefore, in this work we chose two protein sets that behave quite differently in yielding phylogenetic information. The ribosomal proteins are interwoven with rRNAs to form complexes which function as a whole thus they may not be easily transferred horizontally to other species. No wonder that sequence-based methods using concatenated ribosomal proteins have led to reasonable phylogenetic results [10, 16] . On the contrary, the aminoacyl tRNA synthetases act as individual molecules and there was no severe obstacle to prevent them from being transferred between organisms. Indeed, they have been known as notorious molecules for phylogenetics. The 20 different aminoacyl tRNA synthetases, if used individually, yield 20 different trees; some may not even show the trifurcation of the three main domains of life, Archaea, Bacteria and Eu-karya [17, 18, 19] . However, as our results show the collection of all aminoacyl tRNA synthetase sequences in a species leads to a phylogenetic tree comparable to the tree based on ribosomal proteins or on the whole proteome [13] .",

Therefore, only a brief summary of the method follows. First, collect all amino acid sequences from a protein family or from a whole genome. Second, calculate the frequency of appearance of overlapping oligopeptides of length K. A random background was subtracted from these frequencies by using a Markov model of order K\u22122 in order to diminish the influence of random neutral mutations at the molecular level and to highlight the shaping role of selective evolution. Third, putting these \"normalized\" frequencies in a fixed order a composition vector of dimension 20 K was obtained for each species. Fourth, the correlation C (A, B) between two species A and B was determined by taking projection of one normalized vector on another, i.e., taking the cosine of the angle between them. Thus if the two vectors were the same they would have the highest correlation C = 1; if they had no components in common then C = 0, i.e., the two vectors would be orthogonal to each other. Lastly, the normalized distance between the two species was defined to be D = (1-C)/2. Once a distance matrix was obtained the tree construction went in the standard way [22] by using the neighbor-joining algorithm in the Phylip package [23] . The tree topology did stabilize with K increasing and with respect to re-sampling of protein sequences. For more on statistical tests and justification of this approach please see refs. [13, 14] .",

The latter may even get quite far from the main Proteobacteria groups on the tRNA synthetase tree ( fig. 2 ).

The relationship of higher taxa will be further verified when genomic data from a wider assortment of taxa become available. The composition distance method provides a new systematic way of inferring phylogenetic relationships without sequence alignment and parameter adjustment. Together with the traditional SSU rRNA analysis it may help to put prokaryote taxonomy on an unified molecular basis.",
