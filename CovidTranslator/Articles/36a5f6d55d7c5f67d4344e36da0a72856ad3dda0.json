We collected extensive individual case reports and estimated key epidemiology parameters, including the incubation period. Integrating these estimates and high-resolution real-time human travel and infection data with mathematical models, we estimated that the number of infected individuals during early epidemic double every 2.4 days, and the R0 value is likely to be between 4.7 and 6.6. We further show that quarantine and contact tracing of symptomatic individuals alone may not be effective and early, strong control measures are needed to stop transmission of the virus.",

Our estimate of the time from initial exposure to symptom onset is 4.2 days with a 95% confidence interval (CI for short below) between 3.5 and 5.1 days (Fig. 1C ). This estimated period is about 1 day shorter and has lower variance than a previous estimate (1). The shorter time is likely caused by the expanded temporal range of our data that includes cases occurring after broad public awareness of the disease. Patients reported in the Li et al. study (1) are all from Wuhan and most had symptom onset before mid-January; in our dataset, many patients had symptom onset during or after mid-January and were reported in provinces other than Hubei province (where Wuhan is the capital). The time from symptom onset to hospitalization showed evidence of time dependence (Fig. 1D and S1). Before January 18, the time from symptom onset to hospitalization was 5.5 days (CI: 4.6 to 6.6 days); whereas after January 18, the duration shortened significantly to 1.5 days only (CI: 1.2 to 1.9 days) (p-value <0.001 by Mann-Whitney U test). The change in the distribution coincides with the period when infected cases were first confirmed in Thailand, news reports of potential human-to-human transmission and upgrading of emergency response level to Level 1 by China CDC. The emerging consensus about the risk of 2019-nCoV likely led to significant behavior change in symptomatic people seeking more timely medical care over this period. We also found that the time from initial hospital admittance to discharge is 11.5 days ( Fig. 1E ; CI: 8.0 to 17.3 days) and the time from initial hospital admittance to death is 11.2 days ( Fig. 1F ; CI: 8.7 to 14.9 days).",

We thus used mathematical models to integrate the empirical estimates with spatiotemporal domestic travel and infection data outside of Hubei province to infer the outbreak dynamics in Wuhan. Inference based on data outside of Hubei is more reliable because, as a result of the awareness of the risk of virus transmission, other provinces implemented intensive surveillance system to detect individuals with high temperatures and closely track travelers out of Wuhan using digital data to identify infected individuals (6) as the outbreak in Wuhan unfolded.

Therefore, the data represents a reliable, real-time and highresolution source of travel patterns in China. We extracted daily travel data from Wuhan to each of the provinces. We found that in general, between 40,000 to 140,000 people in Wuhan traveled to destinations outside of Hubei province daily before the lock-down of the city on January 23, with travel peaks on January 9, 21 and 22 (Fig. 2B) .

            "text": "We integrated the travel data into our inferential models using two approaches. The rationale of the first model, the 'first-arrival' approach, is that an increasing fraction of people infected in Wuhan increases the likelihood that one such case is exported to the other provinces. Hence, how soon new cases are observed in other provinces can inform disease progression in Wuhan (Fig. 2C ). This has similarities with earlier analyses to estimate the size of the 2019-nCoV outbreak in Wuhan based on international travel data (5, 7, 8) , though inference based infected cases outside of China may suffer large uncertainty due to the low volume of international travel. In our model, we assumed exponential growth for the infected population I* in Wuhan, * ( ) = ( \u2212 0 ) , where is the exponential growth rate and 0 is the time of the exponential growth initiation, i.e. * ( 0 ) = 1. Note that 0 is likely to be later than the date of the first infection event, because multiple infections may be needed before the onset of exponential growth (9) . We used travel data to each of the provinces (Table S3 ) and the earliest times that an infected individual arrived at a province across a total of 26 provinces (Fig. 2D ) to infer and 0 (see Supplementary Materials for details). Model predictions of arrival times in the 26 provinces fitted the actual data well (Fig. S2 ). We estimated that the date of the beginning of an exponential growth is December 20, 2019 (CI: December 11 to 26). This suggests that human infections in early December may be due to spillovers from the animal reservoir or limited chains of transmission (10, 11) . The growth rate of the outbreak is estimated to be 0.29 per day (CI: 0.21 to 0.37 per day), a much higher rate than two recent estimates (1, 5). This growth rate corresponds to a doubling time of 2.4 days. We further estimated that the total infected population size in Wuhan was approximately 4,100 (CI: 2,423 to 6,178) on January 18, which is remarkably consistent with a recently posted estimate (7) . The estimated number of infected individuals is 18,700 (CI: 7,147, 38,663) on January 23, i.e. the date when Wuhan started lock down. We projected that without any control measure, the infected population would be approximately 233,400 (CI: 38,757 to 778,278) by the end of January (Fig. S3 ).",

This could be a reasonable assumption to make for symptomatic individuals because of the intensive surveillance implemented in China, for example, tracking individuals' movement from digital transportation data (6). However, it is possible that a fraction of infected individuals, for example, individuals with mild or no symptoms (13), were not hospitalized, in which case we will underestimate the true size of the infected population in Wuhan. We undertook sensitivity analyses to investigate how our current estimates are affected by this issue using both approaches (see Supplementary Materials for detail). We found that if a proportion of cases remained undetected, the time of exponential initiation would be earlier than December 20, translating into a larger population of infected individuals in January, but the estimation of the growth rate remained the same. Overall, the convergence of the estimates of the exponential growth rate from the two approaches emphasizes the robustness of our estimates to modeldependent assumptions.",

At 0 = 2.2 this fraction is only 55%, but at 0 = 6.7 this fraction rises to 85%. To translate this into meaningful predictions, we use the framework proposed by Lipsitch et al (16) with the parameters we estimated for 2019-nCoV. Importantly, given the recent report of transmission of the virus from asymptomatic individuals (13), we considered the existence of a fraction of infected individuals who is asymptomatic and can transmit the virus (see Supplementary Materials) . Results show that if as low as 20% of infected persons are asymptomatic and can transmit the virus, then even 95% quarantine efficacy will not be able to contain the virus (Fig. 3B) . Given the rapid rate of spread, the sensitivity of control effort effectiveness to asymptomatic infections and the potential of transmission before symptom onset, we need to be aware of the difficulty of controlling 2019-nCoV once it establishes in a new population (17) . Future field, laboratory and modeling studies aimed to address the unknowns, such as the fraction of asymptomatic individuals, the time when individuals become infectious and the existence of superspreaders are needed to accurately predict the impact of various control strategies (9, 17) .",

Since January 23, Wuhan and other cities in Hubei province implemented vigorous control measures, such as closing down transportation and mass gatherings in the city; whereas, other provinces also escalated the public health alert level and implemented strong control measures. We noted that the growth rate of the daily number of new cases in provinces outside of Hubei slowed down gradually since late January (Fig. 3B) . Due to the closure of Wuhan (and other cities in Hubei), the number of cases reported in other provinces during this period shall start to track local infection dynamics rather than imports from Wuhan. We estimated that the exponential growth rate is decreased to 0.14 per day (CI: 0.12 to 0.15 per day) since January 30. Based on this growth rate and an R0 between 4.7 to 6.6 before the control measures, a calculation following the formula in Ref. (14) suggested that a growth rate decreasing from 0.29 per day to 0.14 per day translates to a 50%-59% decrease in R0 to between 2.3 to 3.0. This is in agreement with previous estimates of the impact of effective social distancing during 1918 influenza pandemic (18) . Thus, the reduction in growth rate may reflect the impact of vigorous control measures implemented and individual behavior changes in China during the course of the outbreak.",

(A) A modified snapshot of the Baidu\u00ae Migration online server interface showing the migration pattern out of Wuhan (red dot) on January 19, 2020. Thickness of curved white lines denotes the size of the traveler population to each province. The names of most of the provinces are shown in white. (B) Estimated daily population sizes of travelers from Wuhan, Hubei province to other provinces. (C) A schematic illustrating the export of infected individuals from Wuhan. Travelers (dots) are assumed to be random samples from the total population (the whole pie). Because of the growth of the infected population (orange pie) and the shrinking size of the total population in Wuhan over time, it is more and more likely infected individuals travel to other provinces (orange dots). (D) The dates of documented first arrivals of infected cases in 26 provinces. Names of provinces were shown vertically. (E) Best fit of the 'case count' model to daily counts of new cases (including only imported cases) in provinces other than Hubei. The standard deviations of the sample distribution are shown as the error bars. (F and G) The marginalized likelihoods of the growth rate (F) the exponential growth initiation time (G) are consistent between the 'first arrival' model and the 'case count' model.",
