As the epidemic progresses, many disease modelers have focused on estimating the basic reproductive number R 0 -the average number of secondary cases caused by a primary case in an otherwise susceptible population. The modeling approaches and resulting estimates of R 0 vary widely, despite relying on similar data sources. Here, we present a novel statistical framework for comparing and combining different estimates of R 0 across a wide range of models by decomposing the basic reproductive number into three key quantities: the exponential growth rate r, the mean generation interval\u1e20, and the generation-interval dispersion \u03ba. We then apply our framework to early estimates of R 0 for the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak. We show that many early R 0 estimates are overly confident. Our results emphasize the importance of propagating uncertainties in all components of R 0 , including the shape of the generation-interval distribution, in efforts to estimate R 0 at the outset of an epidemic.",

Estimates of the basic reproductive number are of interest during an outbreak because they provide information about the level of intervention required to interrupt transmission (Anderson and May, 1991) , and about the potential final size of the outbreak (Anderson and May, 1991; Ma and Earn, 2006) . We commend these researchers for their timely contribution and those who made the data publicly available.

The generation interval, defined as the interval between the time when an individual becomes infected and the time when that individual infects another individual (Svensson, 2007) , plays a key role in shaping the relationship between r and R 0 (Wearing et al., 2005; Roberts and Heesterbeek, 2007; Wallinga and Lipsitch, 2007; Park et al., 2019) ; therefore, estimates of R 0 from different models directly depend on their implicit assumptions about the generation-interval distribution and the exponential growth rate. Early in an epidemic, information is scarce and there is inevitably a great deal of uncertainty surrounding both case reports (affecting the estimates of the exponential growth rate) and contact tracing (affecting the estimates of the generation-interval distribution). We suggest that disease modelers should make sure their assumptions about these three quantities are clear and reasonable, and that estimates of uncertainty in R 0 should propagate error from all three sources (Elderd et al., 2006) .",

This phenomenon is a known problem (Gelman et al., 2006) . Alternative choices of prior for the between-study shape parameters are also suboptimal: imposing strong priors (e.g. half-t(\u00b5 = 0, \u03c3 = 1, \u03bd = 4) assumes a priori that between-study variance is large, while weak priors (e.g. half-Cauchy(0,5)) can lead to poor mixing.",

We inferred point estimates (black), uniform distributions (orange) or confidence intervals (purple) for each parameter from each study, and combined them into pooled estimates (red; see text). Open triangle: we assumed \u03ba = 0.5 for Study 2 which does not report generation-interval dispersion. Fig. 1 compares the reported values of the exponential growth rate r, mean generation in-terval\u1e20, and the generation-interval dispersion \u03ba from different studies with the pooled estimates that we calculate from our multilevel model. We find that there is a large uncertainty associated with the underlying parameters; many models rely on stronger assumptions that ignore these uncertainties. Surprisingly, no studies take into account how the variation in generation intervals affects their estimates of R 0 : all studies assumed fixed values for \u03ba, ranging from 0 to 1. Assuming fixed parameter values can lead to overly strong conclusions (Elderd et al., 2006 ). Fig. 2 shows how propagating uncertainty in different combinations would affect estimates and CIs for R 0 . For illustrative purposes, we use our pooled estimates, which may represent a reasonable proxy for the state of knowledge as of January 23-26 ( Fig. 2A) . Comparing the models that include only some sources of uncertainty to the \"all\" model, we see that propagating error from the growth rate (which all but one of the studies reviewed did) is absolutely crucial: the middle bar (\"GI mean\"), which lacks growth-rate uncertainty, is relatively narrow. In this case, propagating error from the mean generation interval has negligible effect compared to propagating the uncertainty in r. Uncertainty in the generation-interval dispersion also has important effects as it determines the functional form of the relationship between r and R 0 (compare \"growth rate + GI mean\" with \"all\"). For example, reducing the dispersion parameter \u03ba from 1 (assuming exponentially distributed generation intervals) to 0 (assuming fixed generation intervals) changes the r-R 0 relationship from linear to exponential, therefore increasing the sensitivity of R 0 estimates to r and\u1e20.",

There are two explanations for this result. First, even though the exponential growth rate r and the mean generation interval\u1e20 have identical mathematical effects on R 0 in our framework (Eq. 2 in Methods), r is more influential in this case because it is associated with more uncertainty (Fig. 1) . Second, assuming a fixed generation interval (\u03ba = 0) makes the estimate of R 0 too sensitive to r and\u1e20. One exception is Study 1: we find this estimate of R 0 is most sensitive to generation-interval dispersion \u03ba. This is because Study 1 assumes an exponentially distributed generation interval (\u03ba = 1): estimates that rely on this assumption make R 0 relatively insensitive and thus tend to have particularly narrow confidence intervals.",

While the point estimate of R 0 is similar to other reported values from this date range, the confidence intervals are wider than all but one study. This result does not imply that assumptions based on the pooled estimate are too weak; we believe that this confidence interval more accurately reflects the level of uncertainties present in the information that was available when these models were fitted. In fact, because the pooled estimate does not account for overlap in data sources used by the models, we feel that it is more likely to be over-confident than under-confident. Our median estimate averages over the various studies, and therefore particular studies have higher or lower median estimates. We note in particular that, while the baseline example we used from Study 6 may appear to be an outlier, the authors of this study also explore different scenarios involving changes in reporting rate over time, under which their estimates of R 0 are similar to other reported estimates.

            "text": "There are other important phenomena not covered by our simple framework. Examples that seem relevant to this outbreak include: changing reporting rates, reporting delays (including the effects of weekends and holidays), and changing generation intervals. For emerging pathogens such as SARS-CoV-2, there may be an early period of time when the reporting rate is very low due to limited awareness or diagnostic resources; for example, (Study 6) demonstrated that estimates of R 0 can change from 5.47 (95% CI: 4.16-7.10) to 3.30 (95% CI: 2.73-3.96) when they assume 2-fold changes in the reporting rate between January 17, when the official diagnostic guidelines were released (World Health Organization, 2020b), and January 20. Delays between key epidemiological timings (e.g., infection, symptom onset, and detection) can also shift the shape of an observed epidemic curve and, therefore, affect parameter estimates as well as predictions of the course of an outbreak (Tariq et al., 2019) . Even though a constant delay between infection and detection may not affect the estimate of the growth rate, it can still affect the associated confidence intervals. Finally, generation intervals can become shorter throughout an epidemic as intervention strategies, such as quarantine, can reduce the infectious period (Hethcote et al., 2002) . Accounting for these factors is crucial for making accurate inferences.",

During early phases of an outbreak, it is reasonable to assume that the epidemic grows exponentially (Anderson and May, 1991) . However, as the number of susceptible individuals decreases, the epidemic will saturate, and estimates of r used for R 0 should account for the possibility that r is decreasing through time. Although our analysis only reflects a snapshot of a fast-moving epidemic, we expect certain lessons to hold: confidence intervals must combine different sources of uncertainty. In fact, as epidemics progress and more data becomes available, it is likely that inferences about exponential growth rate (and other epidemiological parameters) will become more precise; thus the risk of over-confidence when uncertainty about the generation-interval distribution is neglected will become greater.",

A combined effort between public-health workers and modelers in this direction will be crucial for predicting the course of an epidemic and controlling it. We also emphasize the value of transparency from modelers. Model estimates during an outbreak, even in pre-prints, should include code links and complete explanations.
