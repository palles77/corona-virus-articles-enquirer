Data were collected in the year prior to the hurricane as well as approximately 1 and 3 years thereafter. Using Latent Class Growth Analysis (LCGA), we detected 6 distinct trajectory groups. Over half of the participants fit into a trajectory consistent with resilience; that is, they maintained low levels of psychological distress over the course of the study, but experienced an elevation in symptoms at the first predisaster time point followed by a return to predisaster levels. The other trajectories reflected a range of psychological responses to disasters and indicated that predisaster functioning had a major influence on postdisaster psychological outcomes. Degree of exposure to hurricane-related stressors, experiences of human and pet bereavement, perceived social support, and socioeconomic status were significant predictors of trajectory group membership. Implications for research and policy are discussed.",

Yet, even among vulnerable groups, there is often remarkable strength and fortitude in responses to disasters. The primary purpose of this study is to investigate the variability in trajectories of psychological distress in a sample of low-income, African American mothers. Drawing on a data set that includes a measure of psychological distress from the year prior to the disaster as well as 1 year and 3 years thereafter, we document psychological distress trajectories among the women. In addition, we investigate how factors commonly associated with postdisaster psychological responses (e.g., demographic characteristics, disaster exposure, and social and material resources) predict trajectory group membership.",

This imbalance stems, in part, from the unpredictable nature of disasters and the consequent reliance on cross-sectional, post hoc research designs (Benight & McFarlane, 2007) . Indeed, only about 5% of natural disaster studies have included pretrauma data (Norris et al., 2002) ; yet, in the absence of such data, it is impossible to discern whether postdisaster elevations in psychological symptoms stem from preexisting conditions or are the result of the impact of the disaster and its aftermath. This is particularly concerning, given that previous researchers have found that predisaster indices of psychological symptoms are among the strongest predictors of psychological outcomes (e.g., Ginexi, Weihs, Simmens, & Hoyt, 2000; Weems et al., 2007) .",

Continuous measures of psychological distress maximize the statistical variance that can be predicted, but such approaches leave to speculation how to categorize participants' resilience, growth, or decline (Luthar & Cushing, 1999) . In addition, conventional growth curve modeling approaches assume that all participants come from the same population, that a single growth trajectory can be approximated for the entire sample, and that covariates affect growth the same way for each participant (Andruff, Carraro, Thompson, Gandreau, & Louvet, 2009; Jung & Wickrama, 2008; Raudenbush, 2001) . These assumptions are at odds with theoretical frameworks and research findings that posit subpopulations that vary by socioeconomic status, risk status, and other dimensions and that exhibit varying patterns of growth and decline (Jung & Wickrama, 2008) . Therefore, such techniques are thought to oversimplify the complex patterns of growth and decline within a given population (Jung & Wickrama, 2008) .",

(2008) used this approach in a study of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) survivors in Hong Kong. Drawing from assessments at 6, 12, and 18 months after hospitalization, the researchers identified four latent classes (chronic dysfunction: consistently low psychological functioning; delayed dysfunction: initially high functioning, followed by a decrease to low functioning; recovery: initially low functioning, followed by an increase to high functioning; and resilience: consistently high functioning). More recently, deRoon-Cassini, Mancini, Rusch, and Bonanno (2010) used this approach with a sample of traumatic injury survivors at 1, 3, and 6 months after hospitalization and detected the same latent classes. In the aftermath of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, Nandi, Tracy, Beard, Vlahov, and identified five psychological trajectory groups among a representative sample of adult residents in the New York metropolitan area in the four-wave study, which spanned from approximately 6 to 30 months after the September 11th attack. The most common response was having few symptoms over time, but two groups had sustained increases (mild and severe, respectively), one group evidenced a decrease in symptoms, and the last group evidenced chronic symptoms. Lastly, Norris, Tracy, and Galea (2009) recruited representative samples in fourwave longitudinal studies in the aftermath of two disasters: the 1999 floods in Mexico and the September 11th terrorist attack. Six and seven trajectories were identified, respectively, with the most common response in both disasters being low levels of symptoms over time and lower proportions of other patterns.",

That is, what variables predict whether an individual exhibits one pattern (e.g., resilience) over another (e.g., chronic psychological distress)? Along these lines, researchers have identified several variables that seem to predict survivors' psychological responses. First, although the results have been mixed, research has suggested that demographic predictors, such as younger age, having young children, and being an ethnic minority, increase the risk of postdisaster psychopathology (e.g., Brewin et al., 2000; Elliot & Pais, 2006; Gibbs, 1989; Morrow, 1997) . More consistently, researchers have demonstrated a dose-response relationship between indices of disaster exposure and postdisaster psychological distress (e.g., Goenjian et al., 2001; Shore, Tatum, & Vollmer, 1986) .",

Although disaster exposure and stressors have shown associations with short-term psychological responses, less clear is how they relate to longer term psychological outcomes. Some researchers (e.g., Kaniasty & Norris, 2009; Smith & McCarty, 1996) suggest that persistent postdisaster psychological distress is more related to the chronic stressors following disasters (e.g., unstable housing, disrupted social support networks) than to disaster exposure.

Phenomena at each level have the potential to be disrupted by a traumatic event and to rebound after such disruption. As such, the secondary aim of this study was to explore predictors of various psychological trajectories. We included variables that prior research has found to predict variation in disaster survivors' psychological responses, including demographic characteristics (age, race and ethnicity, number of children) and those related to disaster exposure (stressors endured during the hurricane, instances of bereavement and pet loss, and moves). We also included assessments of perceived social support and access to social benefits, a proxy for socioeconomic status, to determine how social and economic functioning at all three time points relate to psychological trajectories.",

First, a Hurricane-Related Stressors scale that included 16 questions assessed stressors experienced during the hurricanes and the week that followed. The questions were drawn from a larger survey of the demographic and health characteristics, evacuation and hurricane experiences, and future plans of Hurricane Katrina evacuees. The Washington Post, the Kaiser Family Foundation, and the Harvard School of Public Health jointly designed the scale (Brodie et al., 2006) . Participants were asked to indicate whether they had experienced the following as a result of the hurricanes: (a) lacked enough fresh water to drink, (b) lacked enough food to eat, (c) felt their life was in danger, (d) lacked necessary medicine, (e) lacked necessary medical care, (f) had a family member who lacked necessary medical care, (g) lacked knowledge of safety of children, and (h) lacked knowledge of safety of other family members. These questions were asked for both Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Rita, yielding 16 items in total. A composite score with the count of affirmative responses to these items was created (KR-20 = .84).",

Perceived social support, defined as beliefs about the availability of support should a need arise, is generally considered a better predictor of mental health, including posttrauma distress, than the more structural measures of support (Fleming, Baum, Gisriel, & Gatchel, 1982; Kaniasty & Norris, 1993; Kaniasty, Norris, & Murrell, 1990) . The 24-item Social Provisions Scale was designed to assess six relational provisions identified by Weiss (1974) . Instead of the full scale, which consists of six subscales each with four items, an eight-item version was used. The shortened version included two items from four of the six original subscales: social integration (e.g., \"I am with a group of people who think the same way I do about things\"), reassurance of worth (e.g., \"There are people who value my skills and abilities\"), guidance (e.g., \"I have a trustworthy person to turn to if I have problems\"), and reliable alliance (e.g., \"There are people I know will help me if I really need it\"). The full scale was not employed to reduce the burden on participants, with the intention of increasing retention in the study. The retained items were selected a priori, because they aligned with the goals of the Opening Doors program, which was to increase community college students' sense of social integration, connection, and guidance from their community colleges. Items were rated using a 4-point Likert-type scale ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 4 (strongly agree), and half of the items were reverse scored. Cutrona (1989) provided evidence for the validity of the Social Provisions Scale among young mothers, and reliability (measured with Cronbach's alpha) for the full scale in a previous study was .92 (Cutrona, Russell, & Rose, 1986 ). In the current study, linear SEM coefficients of reliability, following the guidelines of Yang and Green (2011) , were .83 at Time 1, .82 at Time 2, and .81 at Time 3.",

A total of 12 models was tested. To compare models, we investigated Akaike's information criterion (AIC), Bayesian information criterion (BIC), and adjusted BIC, with lower values indicating better fit, as well as posterior probabilities, with higher values indicating better fit; additionally, we took into account considerations of parsimony and interpretability (Andruff et al., 2009; Jung & Wickrama, 2008) . Fit statistics for each of the models are shown in Table 2 . We selected a model with six trajectory groups and linear and quadratic terms as the best representation of the data. Table 3 lists the mean and standard error of intercept, linear, and quadratic terms for each of the six trajectory groups. As evident in the table, the resilient and increased distress trajectories were best defined by intercept, linear, and quadratic terms; the delayed distress, decreased distress, and improved trajectories were best defined by intercept and linear terms; and the coping trajectory by intercept and quadratic terms. It is important to note here that because of the differing sample sizes within each trajectory group (ranging from 12 to 241), statistical power to detect significant effects varied. Table 3 are means and standard deviations for K6 scores for each trajectory group at the three time points as well as the results of analysis of variance (ANOVA) for group differences in K6 and post hoc Bonferoni-corrected pairwise comparisons. As evident in the table, there were several significant differences in psychological distress among the groups at each time point, providing evidence that LCGA produced unique groups. Growth curves for the six trajectory groups, with estimated means and observed individual values for each (from one of the five complete data sets), are shown in Figure 1 . In addition, a spaghetti plot, with the six trajectories and observed individual values for the full sample (from one of the five complete data sets), is provided in Figure 2 .",

That is, although they reported relatively low levels of psychological distress at each time point, they experienced an increase in symptoms at the first postdisaster assessment, followed by a return to baseline levels at the second postdisaster assessment. The consistently low levels of distress among the majority of participants align with the results of previous studies using LCGA (e.g., Bonanno et al., 2008; Nandi et al., 2009) . The unique contribution of the current study, however, is that we can see that the resilient majority was functioning well prior to the storm and likely had existing psychosocial resources that protected them from adverse postdisaster psychological outcomes. Moreover, the results show that slight elevations in psychological symptoms commonly occur among resilient individuals. Such elevations, although not surpassing cutoffs for probable mental illness, could have a clinically significant impact on survivors. With predisaster data, we were therefore able to show the more nuanced patterns of psychological symptoms among resilient participants.",

It is important to note, however, that they maintained levels of psychological distress in the probably mild or moderate mental illness category over the course of the study. The coping trajectory, again, demonstrates the added value of predisaster data to the current study.

A chronic distress trajectory has been detected in previous studies of samples exposed to traumatic stress (e.g., Bonanno et al., 2007; Hobfoll et al., 2009 ). However, the percentage of participants consistently exhibiting postdisaster symptoms is notably smaller than in previous research. For example, Nandi et al. (2009) found that 13.2% of their sample of NYC residents exhibited severe and increasing symptoms, and 8.3% exhibited chronic severe symptoms in the aftermath of the September 11th terrorist attacks. Again, because these studies lack predisaster data, they cannot determine whether participants experienced increases in distress from pre-to postdisaster and therefore likely include survivors who had severe predisaster symptoms in their chronic distress trajectories. In contrast, we provide clear evidence that the increased distress group had worsening psychological symptoms in the aftermath of the disaster and distinguish them from survivors suffering from predisaster severe distress (i.e., the decreased distress trajectory).",

This discrepancy could be because of how long participants were followed: The September 11 sample was followed through 30 months postdisaster, whereas the Mexican sample was followed only through 24 months postdisaster. The results of the current study further suggest the advantages of longitudinal studies of trauma survivors that continue to assess survivors well beyond the initial recovery period.

Although the decreased distress trajectory is suggestive of postdisaster improvements in psychological functioning, it is possible that participants in this group were experiencing a regression to the mean. That is, because they reported such extreme levels of psychological distress prior to disaster, they were likely to experience some decrease with the mere passage of time, independent of disaster exposure. As with the coping and increased distress trajectories, the decreased distress trajectory demonstrates that the majority of disaster survivors with chronically high levels of psychological symptoms had preexisting psychological conditions. In the absence of predisaster data, we might have erroneously assumed that this trajectory represented an acute postdisaster response and gradual recovery from disaster-related distress to low predisaster levels, rather than a steady decreasing of symptoms that were present before the disaster struck.",

Low perceived social support could have accounted for the predisaster psychological symptoms among the decreased distress participants and put them at greater risk for exposure to the storm (Lowe et al., 2010) . Indeed, those with fewer social resources may have been less likely to secure transportation out of New Orleans and alternative housing for themselves and their children (Lowe et al., 2010) . It is perhaps not surprising, then, that decreased distress participants experienced significantly more hurricane-related stressors than resilient participants, increasing their likelihood of sustaining high levels of distress in the aftermath of the hurricane (e.g., Goenjian et al., 2001) . Also distinguishing the decreased distress trajectory was their receipt of significantly more social benefits (i.e., food stamps, welfare, unemployment, SSI) in the first postdisaster period (i.e., relative to the resilient, coping, delayed distress, and improved groups at Time 2). Perhaps participants in this group had access to fewer family and network resources and were less able to draw on natural supports to reestablish themselves in the aftermath of disaster. Financial distress, in turn, exacerbates women's risk for psychological symptoms (Belle & Doucet, 2003) . Alternatively, chronic mental health problems could have prevented participants from engaging in employment activities, increasing their need for social benefits.",

Of course, identifying and reassessing former participants requires financial and organizational resources and, understandably, disaster studies are often focused on practical matters, such as documenting rates of mental and physical illness and identifying survivors in immediate need of services (Benight & McFarlane, 2007) . When interpreting such data, we should be mindful of the influence of predisaster vulnerabilities in determining both disaster exposure and postdisaster psychological responses.",

Although a resilient trajectory represented the majority of the sample, there were clear subgroups of participants that deviated from this pattern. With traditional latent growth curve modeling, we would have overlooked participants with consistent distress and delayed responses as well as those who experienced improvements in functioning in the postdisaster period. A categorical approach, wherein cutoff criteria are used, would have also detected such variability; however, through LCGA, we were able to demonstrate more subtle changes within each trajectory group. For example, we showed that, even among participants without probable mental illness over the course of the study, there was variation in symptoms over time, with symptoms initially increasing after the disaster before returning to predisaster levels.",

First, selecting which LCGA model to use in subsequent analyses involved some subjectivity; that is, although statistical indices of good fit provided insight into the optimal LCGA model, we also interpreted results with previous research findings and theoretical considerations in mind. Likewise, although attempts were made to choose labels representative of the trajectory shapes, the names selected are not value-neutral. For example, we chose the term resilient for the trajectory that began low, experienced an initial elevation of symptoms, and then returned to baseline levels of distress because that fits with the scientific definition of resilience. This definition, however, has been used inconsistently in the empirical literature, and, likewise, resilience has different meanings in its common usage (Luthar et al., 2000; Tarter & Vanyukov, 1999) . Therefore, although the results provide insight into the rates of a resilient trajectory in a sample vulnerable to postdisaster distress, they do not fully capture the subjective experience of resilience. Likewise, resilience is a multidimensional phenomenon, present in domains beyond psychological functioning, such as physical, educational, and occupational functioning, and in systems beyond the individuals, such as families, social networks, communities, and economic systems. Future researchers should explore different domains of resilience and the interrelationships among them. In addition, qualitative methods should be employed to better understand how survivors of natural disasters and other traumatic events define and experience resilience and the factors they see as promoting positive posttraumatic psychological responses (Luthar & Cushing, 1999 ). An investigation of how these subjective experiences of resilience map onto statistical trajectories, which would enrich our understanding of how individuals respond and recover in the aftermath of disasters and other trauma, would be appropriate.",

As stated previously, participants in the study-lowincome mothers, primarily unmarried and African American-were especially vulnerable to postdisaster psychological distress. The focus on a vulnerable sample is a strength of the study, yet limits its external validity. All of the participants in the study were community college students, which further limits the generalizability of the study. Likewise, there were unique aspects of Hurricane Katrina, including the destruction of levees in need of repair and the slow governmental response. Methodologies that capture more normative samples (e.g., random digit dialing) could be employed to address this limitation. If such procedures were being used for another study in progress prior to a disaster, researchers could mobilize their efforts to contact and reassess participants, thereby including predisaster data for a normative sample. Normative data would also permit a better understanding of the role of demographic variables in determining postdisaster psychological outcomes. In addition, with a larger sample size, researchers would have more statistical power to detect statistically significant differences between trajectory groups, particularly those represented by smaller proportions of a given sample. The analysis of predictors of trajectory group membership should also be replicated, as the number of between-group comparisons in the current study elevated the risk of Type I errors.",

Likewise, studies with additional waves could better capture the complex relationships between psychological and other domains of functioning over time. Although we were able to show that perceived social support and access to social benefits, depending on the timing of assessment, predicted trajectory membership, we did not model change in these resources. As with psychological distress, resources are likely also changing in nonlinear patterns, and additional data waves would allow for modeling of different domains simultaneously.",

Future analyses of patterns of specific psychological disorders commonly found in the aftermath of disasters (e.g., posttraumatic stress disorder, major depressive disorder) would both improve our understanding of postdisaster psychological responses and have implications for clinical interventions. It is also possible that, for some of the participants, more severe psychological symptoms had dissipated by the time of the first postdisaster assessment, which took place approximately a year after the disaster, indicating the need for data points in closer proximity to the disaster (Steinglass & Gerrity, 1990) .",

High disaster exposure, experiences of bereavement and pet loss, low perceived social support, and low socioeconomic status influence survivors' course of symptoms, indicating these variables as viable targets for disaster policies and clinical interventions. As we continue to explore psychological resilience and its relationship with other variables, we will be able to further promote this trajectory among disaster survivors.
