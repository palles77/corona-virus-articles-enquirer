            "text": "Lectins derived from plant and microbial sources constitute a vital class of entry inhibitors that target the oligomannose residues on the HIV envelope gp120. Despite their potency and specificity, success of lectin-based entry inhibitors may be impeded by issues in regards to economical production, formulation and potential mitogenicity. Therefore, there exists a gap in the HIV therapeutics pipeline that underscores the need for mass producible, synthetic, broadspectrum, and biocomptabile inhibitors of HIV entry. Here, we present the development of a polymeric synthetic lectin, based on benzoboroxole (BzB), which exhibits weak affinity (~25 M \u22121 ) for non-reducing sugars, similar to those found on the HIV envelope. High molecular weight BzB-functionalized polymers demonstrated antiviral activity that increased with an increase in ligand density and molecular weight of the polymer construct; revealing that polyvalency improves activity. Polymers showed significant increase in activity from 25 to 75 mol% BzB functionalization with EC 50 of 15 \u03bcM and 15 nM, respectively. A further increase in mole functionalization to 90% resulted in an increase of the EC 50 (59 \u00b1 5 nM), likely due to the elongated rigid structure of the polymer chain compelled by electrostatic repulsion between the boronic acid groups. An increase in molecular weight of the polymer at 50 mol% BzB functionalization showed a gradual but significant increase in antiviral activity, with the highest activity seen with the 382 kDa polymer (EC 50 of 1.1 \u00b1 0.5 nM in CEM cells and 11 \u00b1 3 nM in TZM-bl cells). Supplementing the polymer backbone with 10 mol% sulfonic acid not only increased the aqueous solubility of the polymers by at least 50-fold, but also demonstrated a synergistic increase in anti-HIV activity (4.0 \u00b1 1.5 nM in TZM-bl cells), possibly due to electrostatic interactions between the negatively charged polymer backbone and the positively charged V3-loop in the gp120. The benzoboroxole-sulfonic acid copolymers showed no decrease in activity in the presence of a seminal concentration of fructose (p > 0.05). Additionally, the copolymers exhibit minimal, if any effect on the cellular viability, barrier properties, or cytokine levels in human reconstructed ecto-cervical tissue after 3 days of repeated exposure and did not show pronounced activity against a variety of other RNA and DNA viruses.",

            "text": "From a therapeutic perspective, each step in the HIV life-cycle provides an opportunity for pharmaceutical intervention. Amongst the initial steps in HIV infection is the binding event that occurs between the gp120 receptor on the viral envelope and surface proteins on the target cell. The HIV envelope is among the most heavily glycosylated proteins known to mankind. 1, 2 The gp120 of HIV IIIB has 24 potential N-linked glycosylation sites, of which 13 sites contain complex-type oligosaccharides, and the remaining 11 sites contain hybrid and/or high mannose-type structures. 3, 4 Reports on the antiviral activity of lectin-based entry inhibitors suggest that targeting the oligomannose regions of gp120 can potentially produce broad spectrum entry inhibitors capable of inactivating HIV independent of tropism and strains. Prolonged exposure of these agents to virus-infected cells causes cause deglycosylations on the viral envelope, creating virions that are highly susceptible to neutralization by immunogenic responses. Such mutated virions also lack resistance to other small molecule entry inhibitors. [5] [6] [7] [8] Therefore, lectin-based gp120 targeted entry inhibitors represent an interesting class of antiretroviral agents that potenatially can inactivate HIV in the vaginal lumen even before they reach susceptible CD4+ cells, preventing male-to-female heterosexual HIV transmission. 7, 9 All the entry inhibitors -with the exception of Maraviroc 10 and Fuzeon 11 -that have been tested in clinical trials have failed, most likely due to non-specific interactions with the cell surface and/or suboptimal efficacy. [12] [13] [14] Consequently, there are a limited number of clinical candidates that target HIV entry in comparison to agents that target the enzymatic machinery involved in the viral replication. 15 Carbohydrate binding proteins (CBP), such as the nonhuman naturally occurring lectin protein (MBL) 16 , cyanovirin-N (CV-N) 17 and griffithsin 18 that bind to the high-mannose oligosaccharides found on gp120, demonstrate the ability to inhibit HIV infection in vitro and ex vivo, irrespective of the cell type, or the co-receptor tropism of the viral strain. 19 However, the unacceptably high cost of large scale production and purification of these protein-based lectins, added to their low-stability and plausible immunogenic response, 20 may limit their use as a microbicide. 21 Polyvalency -a mechanism capitalized by CBPs -pertains to simultaneous interactions between multiple-linked ligands and receptors with repeating epitopes, such as those found on the HIV envelope. 22 Due to translational entropic advantage 23 and steric stabilization, polyvalent interactions may enhance binding affinity of weak ligands. 22, 24 Inspired by nature's adaptation to harness polyvalent interactions as a mechanism to enhance weak binding affinity between ligand-receptor pairs, 22 we aimed to develop a synthetic polyvalent inhibitor of the HIV entry by targeting the high-density glycosylation sites on the viral envelope ( Fig 1A&B) .",

While PBA-containing polymers have demonstrated the ability to bind to glycosylated proteins, interactions of boronic acids with glycans have yet not been exploited as a mechanism to attenuate HIV entry. This is because the PBA and cis-diol form hydrolytically stable complexes only when the boronic acid exists in its tetrahedral form, mostly prevalent at a pH value greater than the pKa of PBA. 26 PBA without any substitutions on the aromatic ring have a pKa of 8.8 and therefore, is found to bind strongly to diols only at alkaline pH's. 27 In order to improve binding at physiological pH researchers have investigated various methods to facilitate the formation of stable tetrahedral boronate species at neutral pH by lowering the pKa, 27 through dative bonds formed with boron, 28, 29 and multivalency. 30 The addition of electron-withdrawing groups such as hydroxymethyl, fluoro and nitro to the phenyl ring of the PBA has been found to improve binding to diols at physiological pH compared to unsubstituted PBA. 26, 27, 30, 31 Benzoboroxole (orthohydroxymethyl phenylboronic acid; BzB; Fig 1C) demonstrates strong binding to reducing sugars like fructose and is also capable of binding to glycopyranosides, like galactopyranose, a non-reducing sugar structurally similar to those found in the terminal glycan residues on gp120 at neutral pH. 32 Owing to the ease of synthesis, stability and improved affinity to terminal sugar residues at neutral pH, this work focused on investigating BzB as a gp120-targeted HIV entry inhibitors.",

However, our previous system involved problems regarding solubility and activity, in addition to the need for biocompatibility evaluations. We hypothesized that incorporation of negatively-charged moieties would improve affinity to gp120 through electrostatic interactions with the positively charged V3 loop, while improving solubility and steric availability of the reactive boronic moieties. This work therefore pertains to modulating the multiplicity, ligand density and charge of ligand presenting a polymer backbone to augment the entry inhibition activity of the synthetic lectins. In the current work, we investigate the effect of -(a) ligand density (BzB mole % incorporation), (b) molecular weight of the BzB 50 polymers and (c) activity of the polyvalent synthetic lectins with a sulfonated polymer backbone to inhibit HIV entry. Additionally, we also assayed the influence of fructose and the role of binding kinetics on the antiviral activity of the BzB 50 polymers.",

A 2 mM stock solution of BzB was prepared in 10 \u03bcM solution of ARS. The pH of both solutions was re-adjusted to 7.4. Using a 96-well plate, varying amounts of BzB solution were added to ARS solution to obtain a range of concentrations of BzB maintaining the concentration of ARS constantly at 10 \u03bcM. The plate was allowed to shake for 60 sec prior to measurements. Fluorescence was measured at an excitation wavelength of 485 nm and emission at 620 nM. The experiments were carried out in triplicate. Absorbance spectra were collected over 300-600 nm. The association constant of PBA or BzB for ARS was determined by plotting the inverse of change in fluorescence vs. the inverse of the concentration of boronic acid. The quotient of the y-intercept and the slope of line were used to compute K a for the boronic acid-ARS complex. To validate the assay we first determined the effect of varying concentrations of PBA on the absorbance and fluorescence intensity of ARS. ARS showed a color change, from red to yellow and an 80-fold increase in fluorescence intensity at pH 7.4. The association constant for the PBA-ARS complex was determined to be 1260 M \u22121 , which is consistent with the values reported in literature. 26, 34 Following this, solutions with varying concentrations of the diol (D-fructose, glucose, sialic acid, methyl-\u03b2-Dgalactopyranoside and methyl-\u03b1-D-mannopyranoside) were prepared in 100 mM pH 7.4 phosphate buffers containing 10 \u03bcM ARS and 2 mM PBA or BzB. Solutions containing excess of the diol were titrated against the boronic acid-ARS complex. As the diol replaces the ARS to form a boronic acid-diol complex, the concentration of free ARS in the solution increased, thereby showing a marked decrease in fluorescence. This shift in fluorescence was used to compute the association constant for the boronic acid-diol complex. 34 ",

Following this, the reaction was moved to a 65\u00b0C oil bath for 24 hrs. Polymers were precipitated in anhydrous ether using the fractional precipitation technique. Polymers were centrifuged and purified using dialysis across a 10,000 MWCO membrane using the VivaFlow dialysis system. Polymers with varying molecular weights were synthesized as described above, with 50 mol% feed ratio of BzB and varying feed ratio's of AIBN (1 mol% -5 mol%).

Additionally, R5 TRO (Clade C) and the pseudotyped X4 WEAU (Clade B) viral strains were assayed to investigate cross-clade and cross-tropism activity. Polymer solutions were prepared at 10 mg/mL in DMEM (4.5 g/L D-glucose, 110 mg/mL sodium pyruvate and L-glutamine, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), with the pH adjusted to 7.5 as necessary, and pasteurized for 5 min at 70\u00b0C. After pasteurization, the stock solution was diluted 1:1 with DMEM containing 2X nutrients (DMEM supplemented with 20% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone, Logan, UT), 50 mM HEPES (Gibco/Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and 100 \u03bcg/mL gentamicin (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) under sterile conditions. Preparation was designed to pasteurize the polymers without proteins being present in the media. The final media composition after 1:1 dilution was 10% FBS, 25 mM HEPES, and 50 \u03bcg/mL gentamicin. The assay was conducted in a 96-well plate such that the polymer solution at the highest concentration was added to the bottom row. From the bottom row of the plate 20 \u03bcL of the test sample was added to the prior row with 100 \u03bcL of growth media to create a 6-fold dilution. This scheme of serial dilution was repeated five times to obtain a dose-response curve. Appropriate cell controls and virus controls were included in each plate. Following the serial dilutions, 50 \u03bcL of cell-free virus (200 TCID 50 ) was added to each well, with the exception of the wells that served as cell control. The plate was then incubated for 1 hr in a 37 \u00b0C, 5% CO 2 incubator.

Luminescence was measured after 2 min incubation with Britelite Reagent (PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA). Toxicity of the samples was simultaneously analyzed using an identical plate layout in the absence of virus. To determine loss in cell viability, luminescence from the sample-treated wells was compared to that of the cell controls. EC 50 is reported as the concentration of the sample which reduced the relative luminescence units (RLUs) by 50% compared to the virus control. Dose response curves were fit to the percent neutralization data using GraphPad Prism software (Graph Pad, LaJolla, CA).",

To ensure the viability of the assay, the association constant of PBA-ARS was compared to values reported in the literature by Wang and co-workers. 34 Table I summarizes the association constants of PBA and BzB for various diols. Comparison between PBA and BzB affinities for simple reducing sugars revealed four-fold stronger affinity of BzB for fructose (~600 M \u22121 ) when compared to PBA (160 M \u22121 ); however, the affinity of BzB and PBA for glucose was comparable. Unsubstituted PBA demonstrated minimal affinity for non-reducing sugars such as methyl-\u03b2-Dgalactopyranoside or methyl-\u03b1-D-mannopyranoside at neutral pH. In contrast, BzB revealed higher, but still weak, affinity (~25 M \u22121 ) for non-reducing complex sugars. To develop a boronic acid based synthetic entry inhibitor for HIV, we have exploited the ability of the BzB to bind to non-reducing sugars, 32 which are structurally similar to the terminal sugar moieties found on the high mannose and complex-type N-linked glycans of gp120. We have previously confirmed this observation also using surface plasmon resonance (SPR), in which BzB showed a K d of ~180 mM for HIV BaL gp120, whereas no measurable binding was observed with PBA. 33 Unsubstituted PBA-containing polymers have demonstrated the ability to bind to glycosylated proteins only at alkaline pH; whereas BzB binds to glycosides at neutral pH. 29 This difference has been ascribed to the presence of oxygen from the ortho substituent that stabilizes the boronate ester towards hydrolysis 28 and decreases the energy barrier for tetrahedral formation. 35 While the BzB shows superior binding affinity for sugar residues, when compared to the unsubstituted PBA, the binding is fairly weak for practical applications. In this regard, polyvalency has commonly been exploited to improve binding affinity of weak ligands. This effect is well-known in natural protein-ligand interactions as well as for other synthetic protein mimics. 22, 23 Kaur et al. demonstrated almost a double increase of affinity for glucose for a tweezer-like bis-boronic acid molecule compared to a monovalent boronic acid. 30 Incorporating ligands into polymer backbones provides a synthetically accessible mechanism for increasing the affinity of ligands for glycoproteins.",

The combined effect of the increase in the number and density of ligands likely improves the probability of binding, thereby enhancing binding and antiviral activity through avidity and polyvalency. As a secondary mechanism, we suspect that, when the BzB presenting polymers bind to gp120, they escort along a large water-swollen polymer drape which possibly makes the viral envelope physically inaccessible for fusion and entry into the host cell. 24, 36 If we assume that it is these two mechanisms that collectively determine the activity of synthetic lectins, the gradual increase in activity from 50 to 75 mol% and the decrease in activity from 75 to 90 mol% can be explained through loss in the steric stabilization effect of these polymers. As we increase the ligand density in the polymers has been increased, the negatively charged borons could repel each other, thereby distorting the polymer conformation from an effective random coil structure to a less effective rigid elongated structure. 24 On the other hand, increasing the number of available ligands and therefore, points of attachment between the polymer and the gp120 could result in a collapsed polymer structure; compromising the ability of the polymer to sterically stabilize the binding surface. 24 Although the relative contribution of the above-mentioned two mechanisms towards antiviral activity is yet to be elucidated, it is reasonable to assume that steric stabilization plays a critical role 24 in governing the ability of BzB-functionalized polymer to block HIV entry. Based on these results, further assessments were performed on 50 mol% functionalized BzB polymers.",

Kataoka et al. and others have demonstrated that the incorporation of amines into a PBA-containing polymer could lower the pKa of the boronic acid to around 7, thereby enhancing solubility. 48, 49 Incorporation of amines was also utilized by Winblade et al., who reductively aminated 4formylphenylboronic acid to a poly-lysine-PEG backbone.

            "text": "Since both AMPS and BzB bind to gp120, we tested both polymers individually, as a physical mixture and a co-polymer of AMPS and BzB. BzB was functionalized at 50 mol% and AMPS at 10 mol% in a HPMA polymer. As shown in the dose response curve shown in Fig 4, the physical mixture of the two polymers -BzB 50 and AMPS 10 -did not demonstrate any significant increase in activity (2-tailed student's t-test p = 0.70). This data suggests that the presence of AMPS 10 only in the polymer solution has no influence on the binding of BzB to gp120. In contrast, when the AMPS and BzB were co-polymerized, the resulting polymer showed a more than 2 log scale decrease in EC 50 (2-tailed student's t-test p = 0.004). We believe that the presence of (a) simultaneous ionic and covalent interactions; (b) steric stabilization; and (c) entropic advantage with multiple binding events -may contribute to the observed synergistic improvement in antiviral activity of the co-polymers over the physical mixture. The charged sulfonated polymer backbone likely facilitates initial ionic interactions with the V3 loop on gp120; thereby sterically facilitating covalent interactions between the BzB on the polymer and the glycans on gp120. This implies that, irrespective of the binding affinity, the binding event would bring along a large polymer drape to the viral surface, thus inhibiting interactions with the host cell. The BzB-AMPS co-polymers show activity at concentrations (~ 1 to 4 nM) comparable to the CBP, such as CV-N (~ 0.6 nM). The compound has also been evaluated for its potential to prevent syncytium formation in co-cultures of persistently HIV-1 IIIB infected HUT-78 and uninfected Sup T1 cells, and found to display an EC 50 of 50 \u00b1 2.6 nM.",

Furthermore, the primary mechanism of action of the synthetic lectins is through the ability of BzB to covalently bind to gp120, which demonstrates clade and tropism independent activity 33 . The ionic interactions between AMPS and the V3 loop is an auxiliary mechanism of action which augments the overall activity of the BzB-based synthetic lectins. In summary, incorporation of AMPS in BzB 50 yields a polymer with enhanced aqueoussolubility and generates a heteromeric polyvalent presentation of ligands with superior binding to gp120.",

Owing to the ability of the BzB to bind to glycoproteins and the ability of sulfonic acid to non-specifically bind to positively charged surfaces; it is critical to assess the safety of the BzB-AMPS co-polymers in vaginal tissue. The VEC-100 tissue purchased from MatTek Corporation serves as a suitable model for evaluating the tissue-level toxicity of topical microbicides. 53 As can be seen in Fig 6, BzB-AMPS co-polymers showed no significant loss in tissue viability when compared to the nontoxic HPMA control even at concentrations ~ 1000-fold the in vitro EC 50 , after 72 hours of exposure (\u2265 90% viability). The irritation potential of test polymers were evaluated by ELISA for inflammatory cytokines associated with mucosal toxicity (i.e. IL-8, IL-1, IL-6, TNF\u03b1) using human cytokine kits (R&D System). Our investigations on biocompatibility revealed no significant alterations in tissue viability, cytokine levels, tissue morphology or the barrier properties of the epithelium. In summary, these results suggest that polymers functionalized with BzB moieties, are likely to be non-toxic and are likely to have a high therapeutic index; allowing higher concentrations of the polymer to be dosed safely, thereby minimizing the impact of competing binding sites that may be present in the vaginal environment.",

An ideal microbicide candidate must exhibit potency, cross-clade broad spectrum activity, selective inhibition of the pathogen, mass producible and biocompatible. While current research on CBPs suggests that they possess several of the above favorable properties to qualify as potential microbicide candidates, their success is largely impeded by the potential mitogenic properties, cost of production and isolation and purification in mass quantities. In this regard, our approach of developing synthetic lectins using the BzB moieties meet all of the above criteria of an ideal microbicide. The BzB can readily be incorporated into a variety of biocompatible polymer backbones and polymeric constructs which can be synthetically modified to enhance activity and specificity. Additionally, the BzB-based synthetic lectins also present an affordable and scalable product that could be delivered to the pandemic regions. 50 was determined by fitting a sigmoidal dose-response curve with variable Hill's slope. Single factor ANOVA showed significant differences between the groups (p < 0.05). Two tailed Student's t-test revealed significant increase in activity from 25 to 50 and 75 mol%.

Table III summarizes the inhibitory concentration of BzB 50 , 382 kDa against the viruses we tested. We notably observed activity solely against HIV. Except for HIV, none of the other viruses were inhibited by the BzB polymers even at concentration 100-fold higher than the EC 50 for HIV. These results are in contrast with UDA that inhibit viruses such as HIV-1, HIV-2, RSV, Influenza, CMV, SIV and FIV.
