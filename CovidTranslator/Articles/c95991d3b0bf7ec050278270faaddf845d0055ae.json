Study design: A recombinant protein enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) based on portions of the nucleocapsid protein of group I human coronaviruses was developed and was used to screen serum from 243 children and young adults. Results: For HCoV-229E, the percentages of seropositive individuals were 57.1% for infants <2 months old; 38.9% for infants 2-3 months old; 4.7% for infants 4-5 months old; 42.9-50.0% for infants 6-12 months old; 34.8-62.5% for individuals 1-20 years old. For HCoV-NL63, the percentages of seropositive individuals were 45.2% for infants <2 months old; 11.1% for infants 2-3 months old; 4.7% for infants 4-5 months old; 28.6-40.0% for infants 6-12 months old; 25.0-70.3% for individuals 1-20 years old. Conclusions: Infection with these viruses is common in childhood though the prevalence of these viruses may vary from year to year.",

We chose to use recombinant proteins rather than whole virus for this assay for several reasons. First, use of whole virus or infected cell lysates as antigens would require efficient replication of these viruses in vitro. HCoV-NL63 replicates poorly in cell culture and this would limit the ability to screen a large number of serum specimens. Second, whole virus or infected cell lysates may detect crossreactivity antibody, complicating the use of these materials for seroepidemiology. Indeed, portions of the nucleocapsid of HCoV-NL63 were detected by a goat anti-HCoV-229E suggesting that cross-reactive antibody to the two group I human coronaviruses may be elicited after infection with these viruses.

            "text": "Since we could not rely on an infected cell lysatesbased ELISAs as a \"gold standard,\" because of a concern for cross-reactive antibody, we could not test the sensitivity for the recombinant protein-based ELISA. Nonetheless, we demonstrated that the recombinant proteins could be used to specifically detect antibodies for HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63. The high negative predictive value (89%) indicates that our assay is reliable though may result in an (albeit small) underestimation of the true percentage of negatives. However, this negative predictive value was determined for HCoV-229E; we could unfortunately not confirm this for HCoV-NL63, because we could not propagate the HCoV-NL63 virus to sufficient titers. It appears that infection with known group I coronaviruses is common in childhood. Although maternally acquired Ndirected antibodies to both HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 appeared to wane by 4-5 months of life, >30% of children have serological evidence of infection with either of the two group I human coronaviruses by the age of 12 months. The most likely explanation for this is the exposure and infection with these viruses in the first year of life. Our cross-sectional study revealed that the percentage of seropositive individuals 2 years of age was much greater for HCoV-229E as compared to HCoV-NL63 suggesting that HCoV-229E was more prevalent in the 1-2 years prior to the acquisition of the serum for these children. Our findings are similar to that of Hofmann et al. who found, with the use of pseudotype virus expressing the S protein, that most sera from adults had HCoV-NL63-neutralizing antibodies (Hofmann et al., 2005) . Indeed, the youngest children who had detectable HCoV-NL63-specific antibodies were \u223c1.5 years old and by age 8 years, the sera from most of the children screened had HCoV-NL63-specific antibodies, which are consistent with Table 1 Screening of sera for group I human coronavirus specific antibodies our findings. Furthermore, HCoV-229E specific antibodies were infrequently detected in the adult sera screened by Hofmann et al. and by our group suggesting that the circulation of the two group I coronaviruses differ. Previous studies of non-SARS human coronaviruses, which focused on HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, demonstrated that the seroprevalence varies greatly and depends on the age of the population and the method used to detect coronavirus-specific antibodies (Hambre and Beem, 1972; Hasony and Macnaughton, 1982; Kaye et al., 1971; McIntosh et al., 1970; Monto and Lim, 1974; Pohl-Koppe et al., 1995) . However, these studies used whole virus as antigen and, because of the apparent cross-reactivity of HCoV-229E antibodies demonstrated in our study, it is likely that the assays used in these studies detected group-specific antibody rather than type-specific antibody. With the discovery of HCoV-NL63 the results of these publications should now be viewed differently: in the studies in which HCoV-229E antibody was measured, the data likely represents the seroepidemiology of group I coronaviruses. (The same is likely true for group II coronaviruses with the discovery of HCoV-HKU1, Woo et al., 2005a.) In conclusion, our data indicates that infection with these group I coronaviruses is common in childhood. Application of the recombinant protein-based ELISA will lead to the further understanding of the epidemiology of these viruses.",

An ELISA assay was developed that used either HCoV-NL63 N protein (amino acid 234-377) or HCoV-229E N protein (amino acid 229-389) as antigen. Serial dilutions of sera were incubated with bound recombinant protein. Human antibodies specific for these recombinant proteins were detected with a chromogenic reaction following the addition and incubation with an enzyme (HRP)-linked anti-human antibody. Antibody levels were quantified by optical densities. (A) HCoV-NL63+, HCoV-229E+; (B) HCoV-NL63+, HCoV-229E\u2212; (C) HCoV-NL63\u2212, HCoV-229E\u2212; (D) HCoV-NL63\u2212, HCoV-229E+.",
