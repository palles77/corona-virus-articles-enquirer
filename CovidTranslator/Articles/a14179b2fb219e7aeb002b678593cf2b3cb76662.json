            "text": "There are eight members of the human herpesviridae family: HSV-1, HSV-2, VZV, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), CMV, human herpes virus-6 (HHV-6), human herpes virus-7 (HHV-7), and human herpes virus-8 (HHV-8). The hallmark of the herpesviruses is their ability to establish latency within the neuronal ganglia of the nervous system or cells of the immune system and reactivate during periods of stress, trauma, or immune suppression. Chemistry, mechanism of action, and antiviral activity Acyclovir [9-(2-hydroxyethoxymethyl) guanine] is a synthetic acyclic purine nucleoside analogue that lacks the 3 0 -hydroxyl group of nucleosides. Acyclovir is phosphorylated to the active triphosphate metabolite that inhibits viral DNA synthesis (Figure 1 ). Viral encoded thymidine kinases (TK), present in only herpesvirus-infected cells, catalyze the phophorylation to acyclovir monophosphate. Host cell TK or other kinases cannot phosphorylate acyclovir to its monophosphate metabolite efficiently. Acyclovir is highly selective for cells engaged in active viral replication and does not affect noninfected cells. The monophosphate is subsequently phosphorylated to the di-, and triphosphate by cellular kinases, resulting in acyclovir triphosphate concentrations much higher in HSV-infected than in uninfected cells. Acyclovir triphosphate inhibits viral DNA synthesis by competing with deoxyguanosine triphosphate (dGTP) as a substrate for viral DNA polymerase, as illustrated in Figure 1 . Since acyclovir triphosphate lacks the 3 0 -hydroxyl group required for DNA chain elongation, the growing chain of DNA is terminated. In addition, the incorporated acyclovir can trap viral DNA polymerase and prevent it from initiating other viral DNA replication. The viral polymerase has a greater affinity for acyclovir triphosphate than cellular DNA polymerase, resulting in little incorporation of acyclovir into cellular DNA. In vitro, acyclovir is most active against HSV-1 (average EC 50 \u00bc 0.04 mg ml \u00c01 ), HSV-2 (0.10 mg ml \u00c01 ), and VZV (0.50 mg ml \u00c01 ). Varicella virus is much less susceptible to acyclovir than is HSV, and hence, higher doses of acyclovir are required in the treatment of VZV infections. EBV TK has poor efficiency to utilize acyclovir as substrate, therefore, higher acyclovir concentrations are required for EBV inhibition. CMV, which lacks a virus-specific TK, is relatively resistant.",

Chemistry, mechanism of action, and antiviral activity Cidofovir, (S)-1-(3-hydroxy-2-phosphonylmethoxypropyl) cytosine (HPMPC), is an acyclic phosphonate nucleotide analogue of deoxycytidine monophosphate. Cidofovir has a single phosphate group attached therefore it does not require viral enzymes for conversion to the monophosphate, cellular kinases sequentially phosphorylate the monophosphate to its active triphosphate metabolite. The triphosphate metabolite then serves as a competitive inhibitor of DNA polymerase. The active form of the drug exhibits a 25-to 50-fold greater affinity for the viral DNA polymerase, compared with the cellular DNA polymerase, thereby selectively inhibiting viral replication. Owing to its unique phosphorylation requirements for activation, cidofovir usually maintains activity against acyclovirand foscarnet-resistant HSV isolates, as well as ganciclovir-and foscarnet-resistant CMV mutants. Cidofovir is less potent than acyclovir in vitro; however, cidofovir persists in cells for prolonged periods, increasing drug activity. In addition, cidofovir produces active metabolites with long half-lives (17-48 h), permitting once weekly dosing. Cidofovir has in vitro activity against VZV, EBV, HHV-6, HHV-8, HPV, polyomaviruses, orthopoxviruses, and adenovirus. Unfortunately, cidofovir concentrates in kidney cells 100 times greater than in other tissues and produces severe proximal convoluted tubule nephrotoxicity when administered systemically. Cidofovir has limited and variable oral bioavailability (2-26%), therefore, it is administered intravenously.",

It has 8-20 times greater in vitro activity against CMV, and as active as acyclovir against HSV-1 and HSV-2 and almost as active against VZV. Like acyclovir, the first step of phosphorylation to ganciclovir monophosphate in herpesvirus-infected cells depends on virus-encoded enzymes. In cells infected by HSV-1 or HSV-2, TK catalyzes the phosphorylation of ganciclovir to ganciclovir monophosphate. Because CMV lacks the gene for TK, the enzyme that catalyzes the initial phosphorylation of ganciclovir in CMV-infected cells is the phosphotransferase encoded by UL97 gene. The final phosphorylation steps to the di-and triphosphate is by cellular kinases. Ganciclovir triphosphate serves as a competitive inhibitor of herpes viral DNA polymerase and inhibits the incorporation of guanosine triphosphate into viral DNA. Incorporation of ganciclovir triphosphate into the growing viral chain results in slowing and subsequent cessation of DNA chain elongation.

In addition, vira-A is incorporated into terminal positions of both cellular and viral DNA, thus inhibiting elongation. Viral DNA synthesis is blocked at lower doses of drug than is host cell DNA synthesis, resulting in a relatively selective antiviral effect. However, large doses of vira-A are cytotoxic to dividing host cells. The use of vidarabine was replaced by acyclovir because of poor solubility and toxicity.

Rimantadine is fourfold to tenfold more active than amantadine. The mechanism of action of these drugs relates to the influenza A virus M2 protein, an integral transmembrane protein that functions as an ion channel for this virus and is activated by pH. The drop in pH accompanying the hydrogen flux facilitates the dissociation of the M2 protein from the ribonucleoprotein complexes so that the ribonucleoprotein can enter the cell nucleus and initiate replication. By interfering with the function of the M2 protein, amantadine and rimantadine inhibit the acid-mediated dissociation of the matrix protein from the ribonuclear protein complex within endosomes. This event occurs early in the viral replication cycle. The consequences of these drugs are the potentiation of acidic pH-induced conformational changes in the viral hemagglutinin during its intracellular transport.",

These side effects are usually mild and cease soon after amantadine is discontinued, although they often disappear with continued use of the drug. CNS side effects, which occur in 5-33% of patients, are most common and include difficulty in thinking, confusion, lightheadedness, hallucinations, anxiety, and insomnia. More severe adverse effects (e.g., mental depression and psychosis) are usually associated with doses exceeding 200 mg daily. About 5% of patients complain of nausea, vomiting, or anorexia. CNS adverse effects associated with rimantadine administration are significantly less; however, rimantadine has been associated with exacerbations of underlying seizure disorders. Chemistry, mechanism of action, and antiviral activity Zanamivir (4-guanidino-2,3-dideoxy-2,3-didehydro-N-acetylneuraminic acid), and oseltamivir [ethyl ester of (3R,4R,5S)-4-scetamido-5-amino-3-(1-ethylpropoxyl)-1-cyclohexane-1-carboxylic acid] are sialic acid analogue that competitively inhibit influenza virus neuraminidase (NA). Influenza virus NA is located on the surface of the virus and is responsible for cleaving terminal sialic acid residues, which are essential for the release of the virus from infected cells, viral aggregation, and spread within the respiratory tract. Influenza NA also decreases viral inactivation by respiratory mucous. The lipophilic side chain of zanamivir and oseltamivir binds to the influenza virus NA, blocking its ability to cleave sialic acid residues. Zanamivir and oseltamivir are effective against both influenza A and influenza B. Zanamivir has poor oral bioavailability and therefore it is administered by oral inhalation. More than 75% of an orally inhaled dose of zanamivir is deposited in the oropharynx, approximately 13% of this is distributed to the airways and lungs. Local respiratory mucosal concentrations of zanamivir exceeds 1000 ng ml \u00c01 in sputum for 6 h after inhalation (i.e., over and above the concentration required to inhibit influenza A and B viruses). Approximately 10% of inhaled dose is absorbed systemically; peak serum concentrations range from 17 to 142 ng ml \u00c01 within 2 h of administration of a 10 mg dose. The plasma T 1/2 is between 2.5 and 5 h. Systemically absorbed zanamivir is excreted unchanged in the urine. Although serum concentrations of zanamivir increase with decreasing creatinine clearance, no adjustment in dosing is necessary for renal insufficiency because of the limited amount of systemically absorbed drug.",

IFNs are currently classified as a, b, or g, the natural sources of which, in general, are leukocytes, fibroblasts, and lymphocytes, respectively. Each type of IFN can be produced through recombinant DNA technology. The binding of IFN to the intact cell membrane is the first step in establishing an antiviral effect. IFN binds to the cellular receptors and activates secondary messengers to initiate production of multiple proteins, which are pivotal for the defense of the cell against viruses. The mechanism of action is rather complex (Thomas et al., 2003) . The antiviral effects of IFN include degradation of viral mRNA, inhibition of viral protein synthesis, and prevention of the viral infection of cells. The immunomodulating effects of IFN include enhancement of antigen presentation by HLA I and II to the immune system, activation of natural killer (NK) cells and other immune cells, and increased cytokine production. IFNs are active against a wide spectrum of viruses with RNA viruses being more sensitive than DNA viruses.",

It will be curious to know if lamivudine at higher doses will affect the incidence of resistance. Lamivudine resistance to HBV is conferred through HBV strains with mutations in the viral polymerase, within the catalytic domain (C domain), which includes the YMDD motif (e.g., M204V or M204I), and within the B domain (e.g., L180M or V173L) (Das et al., 2001) .

The phosphorylation to the di-and triphosphate metabolites is by cellular kinases (Merta et al., 1992) .

Entecavir is efficiently phosphorylated by cellular kinases to the active triphosphate metabolite. It affects three-steps in the replication of HBV: (1) prevent the priming of the HBV reverse transcriptase, (2) prevent reverse transcribing of the HBV pregenomic mRNA, and (3) inhibits DNA-dependent DNA synthesis (i.e., terminating viral DNA synthesis) (Seifer et al., 1998; Zoulim, 2006) . The HBV polymerase binds preferentially to entecavir triphosphate, and entecavir triphosphate does not affect human mitochondrial DNA synthesis. The effect of entecavir on human cellular polymerase is minimal. Studies prior to approval of entecavir for HBV treatment suggested that entecavir did not have anti-HIV activity at clinical relevant concentrations. However, recent studies have suggested an anti-HIV activity of entecavir at drug concentrations in the low nanomolar range (McMahon et al., 2007; Sasadeusz, 2007) . Entecavir is well absorbed after oral administration achieving peak plasma concentrations between 0.6 and 1.5 h. Entecavir is not a substrate of the cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme system. It is eliminated primarily in the urine through glomerular filtration and tubular secretion. The mean elimination T 1/2 of entecavir varies from 77 to 149 h in patients with normal function. The intracellular half-life of the triphosphate metabolite in vitro studies is about 15 h (Yamanaka et al., 1999) .",

Telaprevir first binds weakly to the NS3/4A protease and then forms a covalent bond between the hydroxyl group of the catalytic serine and the keto-carbonyl group of telaprevir. The T 1/2 dissociation of this complex is 58 min. Telaprevir is selective for HCV NS3/4A and does not inhibit other serine proteases. Telaprevir is readily absorbed orally with a T max between 2.5 and 5.0 h . The Cmax, Cmin, and AUC for telaprevir are higher when telaprevir is given in combination with peginterferon and ribavirin than when given as monotherapy. A high-fat breakfast increased the the AUC by about 20% compared with a standardized meal (Matthews and Lancaster, 2012) . Telaprevir is metabolized in the liver through reduction, hydrolysis, and oxidation. Telaprevir is a substrate and an inhibitor of CYP 3A4 isozyme. Telaprevir is both a substrate and an inhibitor of P-glycoprotein. Agents that induce CYP 3A4 or P-glycoprotein may reduce plasma concentration of telaprevir. Telaprevir is eliminated mainly through the feces and to some extent through expired air and urine.",

Chemistry, mechanism of action, and antiviral activity Maraviroc (4,4-difluoro-N-{(1S)-3-[exo-3-(3-isopropyl-5-methyl-4H-1,2,4 triazol-4-yl)-8-azabicyclo(3,2,1]oct-8-yl]-1-phenylpro-pyl}cyclohexanecarboxamide) is the first of the class of CCR5 coreceptor antagonists licensed (August 2007) for HIV treatment. Maraviroc selectively binds to the human chemokine receptor CCR5 present on the cell membrane, preventing the interaction of HIV-1 gp120 and CCR5 necessary for CCR5-tropic HIV-1 to enter cells. It inhibits the replication of CCR5-tropic laboratory strains and primary isolates of HIV-1 in vitro. The mean EC 50 for maraviroc against various strains of HIV-1 ranges from 0.1 to 1.25 nmol l \u00c01 (0.05-0.64 ng ml \u00c01 ) in cell culture. Maraviroc was not active against CXCR4-tropic and dual-tropic viruses (EC50 value >10 mmol l \u00c01 ). The antiviral activity of maraviroc against HIV-2 has not been evaluated. The absolute bioavailability for 100 and 300 mg doses are 23 and 33%, respectively. Peak plasma concentrations of maraviroc are attained at 0.5-4 h following single oral dose of 1200 mg administered to uninfected volunteers. Maraviroc is bound (approximately 76%) to human plasma proteins. It is principally metabolized by the cytochrome P450 system to metabolites that are essentially inactive against HIV-1. Maraviroc is a substrate of CYP3A and the efflux transporter P-glycoprotein (Pgp), and therefore, its pharmacokinetics are likely to be modulated by inhibitors and inducers of these enzymes/transporters. The terminal half-life in healthy subjects is 14-18 h.",

Enfuvirtide interferes with the entry of HIV-1 into cells by inhibiting fusion of viral and cellular membranes (Figure 2 ). Enfuvirtide binds to the first heptad-repeat (HR1) in the gp41 subunit of the viral envelope glycoprotein and prevents the conformational changes required for the fusion of viral and cellular membranes. The IC 50 of enfuvirtide for baseline clinical isolates ranged from 0.089 to 107 nmol l \u00c01 (0.4-480 ng ml \u00c01 ). Enfuvirtide is active against R5, X4, and dual tropic viruses, but has no activity against HIV-2. Enfuvirtide is administered twice daily by subcutaneous injection. Single-dose vials contain 108 mg of enfuvirtide for the delivery of approximately 90 mg ml \u00c01 when reconstituted. The absolute bioavailability is 84.3 AE 15.5%. Following 90 mg bid dosing of enfuvirtide subcutaneously in combination with other antiretroviral agents in HIV-1 infected subjects, the median T max was 4 h (ranged from 4 to 8 h). Enfuvirtide is catabolized by proteolytic enzymes. It is not metabolized by hepatic CYP450 isoenzyme systems.

Zidovudine is initially phosphorylated by cellular TK and then to its diphosphate by cellular thymidylate kinase. The triphosphate derivative competitively inhibits HIV reverse transcriptase, and functions as a chain terminator. Zidovudine inhibits HIV-1 at concentrations of approximately 0.013 mg ml \u00c01 . In addition, it inhibits a variety of other retroviruses. Synergy has been demonstrated against HIV-1 when zidovudine is combined with didanosine, zalcitabine, lamivudine, nevirapine, delavirdine, saquinavir, indinavir, ritonavir, and other compounds. It was the first drug to be licensed for the treatment of HIV infection, and still is used in combination with other drugs as initial therapy for some patients. Zidovudine is available in capsule, syrup, and intravenous formulations. Oral bioavailability is approximately 65%. Peak plasma levels are achieved approximately 0.5-1.5 h after treatment. Zidovudine penetrates cerebrospinal fluid, saliva, semen, and breast milk and it crosses the placenta.

Chemistry, mechanism of action, and antiviral activity Abacavir sulfate, (1S,4R)-4-[2-amino-6-(cyclopropylamino)-9H-purin-9-yl]-2-cyclopentene-1-methanol, is a structural analogue of the purine guanine. The phosphorylation pathway of abacavir differs from that of all other nucleoside analogues. The first step in the conversion of abacavir to its active metabolite, carbovir triphosphate, is phosphorylation to abacavir monophosphate by adenosine phosphotransferase. This step is followed by deamination by a cytosolic enzyme to form carbovir monophosphate, which undergoes two subsequent phosphorylations, to the diphosphate by guanylate kinase and to the triphosphate by nucleoside diphosphate kinase and other enzymes. Carbovir triphosphate competes with endogenous 2 0 -dGTP for incorporation into the nucleic acid chain, and after incorporation, terminates DNA chain elongation. Abacavir exhibits potent in vitro antiviral activity against wild-type HIV-1 (IC 50 4.0 mmol l \u00c01 ), but this activity is lower than the activity of zidovudine (IC 50 0.040 mmol l \u00c01 ).

In phase IIb trial, the amino acid substitution V32I developed on darunavir/ritonavir (600/100 mg twice a day) in greater than 30% of virologic failure isolates and substitutions at amino acid position I54 developed in greater than 20% of virologic failure isolates. Other substitutions that developed in 10-20% of darunavir/ritonavir virologic failure isolates occurred at amino acid positions I15, L33, I47, G73, and L89.",

The trend toward fixed-dose combinations and once-daily dosage forms of many antiretroviral drugs has provided welcome relief to patients. The following multi-class fixed dose combination agents have been approved by the FDA: Atripla (efavirenz, emtricitabine and tenofovir); Complera (emtricitabine, rilpivirine, and tenofovir); and Stribild (elvitegravir, cobicistat, emtricitabine, and tenofovir). Not only is their medication burden simplified, but as a consequence of improved adherence to therapy, they should experience better control of HIV and thus reduced morbidity.",

There are several nucleoside analogues in preclinical and clinical studies. Notably are the novel 4 0 -substituted thymidine analogues with potent antiviral activity and less cytotoxic . An example is the recently discovered 2 0 ,3 0 -didehydro-3 0 -deoxy-4 0 -ethynylthymidine, structurally related to stavudine, is a more potent inhibitor of HIV-1 replication and is much less inhibitory to mitochondrial DNA synthesis and cell growth in cell cultures than its progenitor stavudine. The triphosphate metabolite accumulates in cells much longer than stavudine, and exerts persistent antiviral activity even after removal of drug from culture (Paintsil et al., 2007) . It also has a unique resistance profile when compared to other thymidine analogues and maintains activity against multidrug resistant HIV strains. There is increasing number of compounds discovered as anti-HIV agents targeted at virtually any step in the replicative cycle of the virus and novel targets in development.",
