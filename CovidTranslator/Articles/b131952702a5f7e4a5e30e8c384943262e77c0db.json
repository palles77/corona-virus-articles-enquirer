Passive immunization with the Fab fragment alone (618907 pg mouse -') was unable to confer protection in mice. Furthermore, we passively immunized with the mAb 18A2B2 SCID beige mice, which are deficient in natural killer (NK) cell activity, to ascertain the role of NK cells in the protective mechanism, These mice were free of virus 5 days following viral challenge, indicating that NK cells do not contribute signtficantly towards the protective action of this antibody. Moreover, passively immunized BALBIc mice decomplemented with 8-10 U of cobra venom factor (CoVF) and DBAI2J mice (C5 deficient) were only partially protected. These findings suggest that in mice the alternative and classical pathways of the complement system are involved in the passive protection mechanism conferred by the non-neutralizing mAb 18A2B2.

For several years the F and G glycoproteins of RSV have been under scrutiny in the prospect of developing an effective and innocuous vaccine1g5. Studies involving the characterization of potential antigenic and immunogenic sites of the F and G glycoproteins revealed that some B epitopes are involved in neutralization and passive protection . 3~6-11 It was shown that the subgroup specific antigenic site is located within the amino acid region 174-188 of the glycoprotein G839.

In this study we examined the mechanisms involved in the protection of mice following passive immunization with mAb 18A2B2. The protective potential of the mAb was investigated in SCID mice deficient in B and T cell function, in SCID beige mice deficient in B, T, NK cells and polymorphonuclear (PMN) cells. Furthermore, complement depleted BALB/C mice and DBA/2J mice deficient in the C5 component of the complement were used to evaluate the role of the complement system in protection. Finally, IFN-y depleted BALB/c mice allowed us to evaluate the contribution of IFN-), towards the antiviral effect observed in BALB/c mice passively immunized with mAb 18A2B2. The results demonstrate that both pathways of the complement Protection of mice: S.

MAb 18A2B2 prevented replication of RSV in the lungs of treated mice (Table I) . However, mice receiving 618-907 ,ug of the Fab fragments showed no significant reduction of viral titres in the lungs (t-test 0.05 level) in comparison to the control mice receiving intranasal challenge only (Table 1) . This observation is consistant with the observation made by Oldstone et aL2' that Fab fragments are almost totally ineffective in the lysis of viral infected cells. Lamarre and Talbot22 showed that the Fab fragment of a neutralizing mAb directed against the S glycoprotein of murine hepatitis virus required tenfold the amount of the whole antibody to achieve the same level of protection in mice. In our experiment, the complete absence of protection observed with the passive transfer of up to 907 pug of Fab fragments suggests that the Fc fragment of the n-&b 18A2B2 plays an important role in passive protection. Unfortunately, we have not been able to evaluate the protective potential of antibody bivalency by using F(ab'), since the isotype IgG2b is degraded upon digestion with pepsin. SCID mice have few if any lymphocytes; they are hypogammaglobulinaemic and deficient for immune functions mediated by T and B lymphocytes23q24. We immunized SCID mice with mAb 18A2B2 to determine whether B and T cells play a role in the protection conferred. The 6 mice receiving mAb were totally protected while the control mice had an average viral titer of 104.3 TCID,,. Total protection observed in passively immunized SCID mice suggests that passive protection by mAb 18A2B2 is not dependent on B-or T-cell functions. Previous studies reported that mice expressing the beige mutation (bg/bg) have an NK defect which appears to lie within the lytic machinery of NK cells2'-' . The use of beige mice has proven valuable in studying cytomegalovirus and lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus infection in the absence of functional NK cells28.29.",

It was shown that administration of anti-IFN-y serum enhanced the mortality of mice infected with herpes simplex virus\"' and raised virus titers of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus34 and vaccinia virus35 infected organs. In our study, we attempted to evaluate the effect of IFN-y as a complementary mechanism in the protection of mice. Our results show that three mice injected with anti-IFN-y antibodies and passively immunized with mAb 18A2B2 were totally protected as were the mice passively immunized with mAb 18A2B2 that were not IFN-), depleted (Table I) . This finding suggests that the participation of IFN-y in the observed protection with mAb 18A2B2 is unlikely. This conclusion is also supported by the fact that we were unable to detect any IFN-y in the sera of mice vaccinated with the peptide G/174-187 (result not shown).",

However, depletion of the complement system appears not to be sufficient to totally abrogate the protection of mice passively immunized with mAb 18A2B2. Macrophages and monocytes known notably for their viral phagocytic properties and cytokines production could confer a complementary protection in our animal model. This hypothesis is yet to be verified.",
