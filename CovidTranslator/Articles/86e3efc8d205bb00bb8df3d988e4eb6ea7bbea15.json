It is the most common acquired gastrointestinal medical and surgical emergency in premature infants and occurs in 7% of infants less than 1500 g birth weight 1, 2 . Progress in prevention of the disease has been limited by the inclusion of heterogeneous intestinal diseases labeled as NEC 3 . Although considered an infectious disease for a long time, no single pathogen has been identified consistently. Reports of NEC have linked this disease with a variety of intestinal pathogens including Clostridium difficile 4 , Clostridium perfringens 5 , Escherichia coli 6 , adenovirus 7-8 , astrovirus 9 , enterovirus 10 , rotavirus 11 , and norovirus 12 . The number of reports of viral pathogens associated with NEC has tripled in the last 5 years and it has been suggested that rotavirus may constitute as much as 30% and norovirus 40% of NEC cases in single center cohorts 3, [11] [12] . Recently molecular methods have been developed for detection of viral RNA in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded human tissues 13 . We applied a multiplex PCR amplification and suspension array detection approach to evaluate 28 ileum tissue samples resected for NEC collected over a 3-year period for 15 common bacterial, fungal and viral gastrointestinal pathogens.",

Of the NEC samples, 13 were from males and 9 from females (see Table, Supplemental Digital Content 1). The median (range) gestational age was 28.2 (23-39) completed weeks and the median (range) age at the time of tissue resection was 27.1 (7-108) days. All NEC cases were collected between 2007 and 2011 with 2 collected during spring, 5 during summer, 9 during fall and 6 during winter. NEC cases did not appear to occur during a clustered outbreak or a preferential season. Non-NEC controls were taken from patients diagnosed with spontaneous intestinal perforation, atresia, volvulus, ileus or gastroschisis. Of the control samples, 7 were from males and 7 from females. The median (range) gestational age was 32.8 (25-39) completed weeks and the median (range) age at the time of tissue resection was 8.3 (2-73) days. Samples were collected between 2008 and 2011 with 2 collected during spring, 5 during summer, 2 during fall and 5 during winter. The positive control tissue sample was strongly positive for Giardia and the stool sample was positive for norovirus. In contrast, none of the NEC or non-NEC tissue samples were positive for any of the following pathogens: Y. enterocolitica, Salmonella, Shigella, Campylobacter, Vibrio, E. coli, E. coli ST, E. coli LT, norovirus GI, norovirus G II, rotavirus A, adenovirus, C. diff. toxin A, C. diff. toxin B, Cryptosporidium, E. histolytica, Giardia, Shiga toxin I, and Shiga toxin II.",

Other studies have linked NEC with Clostridium perfringens 5 , Escherichia coli 6 , Clostridium difficile 4 , rotavirus 11 , astrovirus 9 and others. However, in almost all cases pathogen detection has been performed from stool samples but not from tissue. Bhatnagar et al. confirmed RT-PCR as highly sensitive method in detection of West Nile Virus in formalinfixed, paraffin-embedded human tissue samples 13 . Therefore, we applied for the first time a multiplex PCR approach to paraffin-embedded human intestinal tract samples from preterm patients with NEC. To the best of our knowledge this is the largest collection of NEC tissue samples tested for gastrointestinal pathogens by this method.",

Reported associations between NEC and bacterial or viral pathogens in previous studies have often been observed as clustered cases simultaneously with epidemic intestinal infections [16] [17] [18] . However, Boccia et al. could not detect a seasonal trend when they reviewed 17 reports of NEC outbreaks 19 . Other studies have considered a linkage of NEC and viral 9 or bacterial pathogens 5 independent from epidemic infections. The lack of pathogen detection in a relatively large collection of NEC cases supports the multifactorial nature of NEC.",
