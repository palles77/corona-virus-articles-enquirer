            "text": "We describe a new method for affinity purification of recombinant proteins using a dual protease protocol. Escherichia coli maltose binding protein (MBP) is employed as an N-terminal tag to increase the yield and solubility of its fusion partners. The MBP moiety is then removed by rhinovirus 3C protease, prior to purification, to yield an N-terminally His 6 -tagged protein. Proteins that are only temporarily rendered soluble by fusing them to MBP are readily identified at this stage because they will precipitate after the MBP tag is removed by 3C protease. The remaining soluble His 6 -tagged protein, if any, is subsequently purified by immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC). Finally, the N-terminal His 6 tag is removed by His 6 -tagged tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease to yield the native recombinant protein, and the His 6 -tagged contaminants are removed by adsorption during a second round of IMAC, leaving only the untagged recombinant protein in the column effluent. The generic strategy described here saves time and effort by removing insoluble aggregates at an early stage in the process while also reducing the tendency of MBP to \"stick\" to its fusion partners during affinity purification.",

            "text": "Rapid advances during the past three decades in genomics and proteomics have revolutionized the fields of biotechnology and human medicine, particularly when recombinant DNA technology joined hands with structural biology. Currently, samples of proteins for structural and functional studies are routinely obtained by bioengineering (Derewenda 2004) . Even so, protein purification remains the principal bottleneck. Conventional methods of protein purification have been almost completely supplanted by affinity-based methods that employ protein or peptide affinity tags (Lichty et al. 2005; Terpe 2003; Waugh 2005) . The popularity of these affinity-based methods can be attributed to their generic nature in comparison to traditional approaches, which are rather protein specific. Other purification platforms like ion exchange, hydrophobic interaction or size exclusion chromatography are used as auxiliary steps to further enhance the purity of the sample if necessary.",

            "text": "In our laboratory and many others, a dual His 6 -MBP (maltose-binding protein) tag is used in an initial immobilized metal-ion affinity chromatography (IMAC) step (Hewitt et al. 2011; Jing et al. 2010; Nallamsetty and Waugh 2007) . The reason for employing the dual-tag has been discussed in detail elsewhere (Nallamsetty et al. 2005) . Briefly, MBP enhances the solubility and improves the yield of its fusion partners during overproduction but is not a particularly effective affinity tag for protein purification. Hence, the His 6 tag is included to allow affinity chromatography by IMAC. The N-terminal His 6 -MBP tags are subsequently removed by tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease to generate a tag-free protein. Although in general this approach has been very successful, it is not without its problems. For instance, a significant fraction of aggregation-prone proteins that are rendered soluble by fusing them to MBP subsequently precipitate when the fusion proteins are cleaved by TEV protease (Nomine et al. 2001; Smyth et al. 2003) . These proteins presumably are either not properly folded or exist as soluble aggregates in partially folded forms. Usually it cannot be ascertained whether or not this will be a problem until after affinity purification. A second potential pitfall is the tendency of some proteins to stick to MBP after TEV digestion, making it difficult to separate them from each other. The interaction between MBP and its fusion partners may be related to the mechanism of solubility enhancement (Raran-Kurussi and Waugh 2012) . In these situations, it is usually necessary to employ an MBPTrap (or amylose) column, or another IMAC step to remove the MBP, thereby making the purification process more labor intensive. In the present study, we attempt to circumvent both of these problems by using a dual protease approach to achieve sequential removal of the MBP and His 6 tags.",

First, a SnaBI restriction site was inserted at the end of the ORF encoding MBP in pKM596 (Fox et al. 2003) , using the QuikChange Lightning site-directed mutagenesis kit (Agilent Technologies) with primers PE-2852 and PE-2853 (Table 1) to generate the plasmid pSRK2704. In the next step, the C-terminus of MBP in pSRK2704 was further extended to include an in-frame 3C protease recognition site followed by a His 6 tag by PCR-restriction cloning using PE-42, PE-2886 and PE-2887 primers ( Table 1 ). The PE-42 primer was designed to anneal just proximal to the BglII site in the malE gene while PE-2886 and PE-2887 were partially overlapping reverse primers that were employed to engineer the desired insertions (3C site and His 6 tag) followed by a SnaBI restriction site. The PCR amplicon, consisting of a C-terminal portion of the MBP ORF from pKM596 joined inframe to a sequence encoding GGGLEVLFQ/GPHHHHHHYV, was digested with BglII and SnaBI, and then cloned between the same sites in pSRK2704 to yield the destination vector pSRK2721 ( Table 2 ). The \"YV\" residues shown above are cloning artifacts derived from the SnaBI site. The rhinovirus 3C protease recognition site is underlined and the cleavage site is marked by a forward slash (see above).",

In the initial step, the desired insertion sequence (p15A ori) was PCR-amplified using a high fidelity DNA polymerase. The forward and reverse primers for creating a \"p15A mega primer\" were pSAMRFFwd and pSAMRFRev, respectively ( Table 1 ). The reaction set-up, cycling method and template DNA were the same as previously described (Sathiamoorthy and Shin 2012) . This mega primer amplicon was used as complimentary primers in a subsequent QuikChange Lightning reaction (Agilent Technologies) to bring about the desired change in the target plasmid. The QuikChange Lightning reaction mix consisted of the target DNA template (50 ng) and the mega primer amplicon (350 ng) along with other PCR components. The cycling method was as follows: 95 \u00b0C for 30 s (segment 1); 95 \u00b0C for 30 s, 52 \u00b0C for 1 min, 68 \u00b0C for 7 min (segment 2 for 5 cycles); 95 \u00b0C for 30 s, 55 \u00b0C for 1 min, 68 \u00b0C for 7 min (segment 3 for 13 cycles). The target plasmid in the QuikChange reaction was pBLN200-GFPmut2-Car9 plasmid (Coyle and Baneyx 2014) in our reaction mix instead of pET-28a(+) in the earlier method (Sathiamoorthy and Shin 2012) . The pBLN200-GFPmut2-Car9 is a derivative of pET-24a(+) and carries the arabinose-inducible P BAD promoter and the araC gene instead of the T7 promoter. Thus, effectively the ColE1 replicon in pBLN200-GFPmut2-Car9 was replaced with the p15A replicon. The modified vector, pSRK2738 (Table 2) , was confirmed by PCR and DNA sequencing. Induction of the vector with L-arabinose was confirmed by monitoring the fluorescence of the GFPmut2 protein in E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells (Agilent Technologies Inc.). Next, the 3C protease ORF, bracketed by NdeI and XhoI sites, was amplified by PCR, cleaved with these restriction enzymes, and inserted between the same sites in pSRK2738 to generate the L-arabinose inducible, untagged 3C protease expression vector pSRK2751 (Table 2) .",

The purpose of the MBP tag is to enhance the solubility and promote the proper folding of the passenger protein (Kapust and Waugh 1999; Raran-Kurussi and Waugh 2012; Waugh 2005) . The 3C protease site allows the MBP moiety to be separated from the His 6 -tagged passenger protein prior to IMAC. This has two benefits. First, it enables one to determine whether or not the passenger protein will precipitate when it is released from MBP before any chromatographic steps are performed. Second, it helps alleviate the propensity of MBP to stick to and co-purify with some passenger proteins, probably because such an interaction is less likely to persist once the two fusion partners are no longer covalently attached to one another. After IMAC purification of the His 6 -tagged passenger protein, the His 6 tag is removed by His 6 -tagged TEV protease. In the final step, the cleaved His 6 tag and the TEV protease are adsorbed by another IMAC step, leaving just the pure, untagged passenger protein in the column effluent.",

Alternatively, 3C protease can be co-expressed with the fusion protein substrate. For this purpose, an arabinose-inducible 3C protease vector is utilized, enabling the production of 3C protease to be controlled independently of the IPTG-inducible fusion protein expression vector.

Except for sfGFP, Ubc9 and MERS-CoV 3CL pro , all of the other passenger proteins used in this study are poorly soluble when expressed in an unfused form or as GST fusion proteins in E. coli (Fox et al. 2003; Kapust and Waugh 1999; Nallamsetty et al. 2005; Sun et al. 2011) .

The results confirmed that the fusion proteins were cleaved nearly to completion during the short incubation period ( Figure  2A, 2B) . Upon prolonged incubation, the 3C protease also cleaved the TEV recognition site in the MBP fusion proteins (Supplementary data). This observation was unexpected, considering the reportedly strict requirement for Gly and Pro residues in the P1\u2032 and P2\u2032 positions, respectively, of a 3C protease recognition site (Waugh 2011) . In a subsequent titration experiment, it was determined that an E. coli cell weight ratio of 10:1 (fusion protein cells: 3C protease cells) can remove the MBP tag efficiently without causing any non-specific cleavage at the TEV site ( Figure 3) . Thus, generally speaking, 1 liter of cells expressing 3C protease is required to cleave the MBP fusion protein in cells obtained from 10 liters of medium.",

Therefore, we and others have employed a generic strategy for protein expression and purification that combines the solubility-enhancing benefit conferred by MBP with the powerful advantage of immobilized metal affinity chromatography by using a polyhistidine tag in a tandem configuration with MBP (His 6 -MBP) (Hewitt et al. 2011; Jing et al. 2010; Nallamsetty and Waugh 2007) . Although frequently successful, this approach has two potential pitfalls. First, many aggregation-prone proteins that can be rendered soluble by fusing them to MBP subsequently precipitate after they are separated from the solubility enhancer. Second, MBP has a tendency to form noncovalent complexes with some passenger proteins that complicates their downstream purification. The first problem occurs when passenger proteins are unable to fold properly, either spontaneously or with the assistance of endogenous chaperones, once the competing kinetic pathway of aggregation is blocked by fusing them to MBP (Raran-Kurussi & Waugh, 2012) . Presently there is no generally effective solution to this problem. However, the method reported here, in which MBP is cleaved from the passenger protein in the crude cell extract, enables many of these \"dead end\" cases to be spotted very early, prior to purification of the fusion protein by affinity chromatography. Still, occasionally a passenger protein may remain soluble but be biologically inactive after it is released from MBP, possibly because fusion to MBP enables certain proteins to evolve into kinetically trapped folding intermediates that are no longer susceptible to aggregation. Therefore, it is advisable to employ a biological assay, if possible, at an early stage to confirm that the passenger protein is properly folded. The second advantage of cleaving the MBP fusion protein prior to affinity purification is that this reduces the tendency of MBP to \"stick\" to the cleaved passenger protein during its purification. This characteristic of MBP may be related to the mechanism by which it promotes solubility and inhibits aggregation, which is thought to involve the formation of transient complexes between MBP and partially folded passenger proteins (Raran-Kurussi & Waugh, 2012) .",

The most likely explanation for this is that some of the fusions exist in the form of soluble aggregates, thereby masking the cleavage site. We have also observed cases in which a His 6 -MBP fusion protein binds readily to IMAC (e.g., Ni-NTA) resin whereas the corresponding His 6 fusion protein generated after 3C cleavage does not. This could be due to obstruction of the His 6 tag when it is present on the N terminus of the passenger protein as opposed to when it is attached to the N terminus of MBP. This is exemplified by DUSP14 (Supplementary Figure S3A) . Inefficient binding of a His 6 -tagged passenger during IMAC is not necessarily indicative of an unfolded protein, however, because at least some of the unbound His 6 -DUSP14 was enzymatically active (data not shown).",

However, the method presented here has two noteworthy advantages. First, 3C protease is used instead of TVMV protease to separate MBP from the His-tagged passenger protein. 3C protease is superior to TVMV protease because it is highly active at low temperature (Raran-Kurussi et al. 2013) . Consequently, the reaction proceeds efficiently on ice. Moreover, in the Donnelly method the fusion protein is cleaved by TVMV protease inside intact cells. Yet expression of the TVMV protease is constitutive, resulting in the rapid cleavage of MBP fusion proteins following their translation. There is significant evidence to suggest that the longer a protein remains fused to MBP, the more likely it is to fold correctly (Kapust and Waugh 2000) . Although delayed induction of the 3C protease gene on the plasmid pSRK2751 with arabinose was intended to solve this problem, unfortunately enough protease was produced in the absence of inducer to cleave a substantial portion of a well-expressed MBP-sfGFP fusion protein in vivo ( Figure   4 ). Hence, we recommend employing the novel co-lysis method of 3C protease cleavage instead.",

Moreover, while the attrition rate may seemingly appear higher than that associated with the use of a dual His 6 -MBP tag and a single protease, proteins that cannot be purified using the dual protease approach very likely would also prove to be problematic when the more conventional approach is employed, only at a later stage and after a considerably greater expenditure of time and effort.",
