The opposite was true for cleaning of the lambing areas, organization of lambing periods, accumulation of lambs in the pens, high content of fat, protein and lactose in milk and low serum gamma globulin and total protein in lambs and ewes. Cryptosporidium spp. and Escherichia coli isolation showed a trend to be linked to the presence of diarrhoea. A positive correlation was found between serum total protein in ewes and serum gamma globulin in lambs. Thus, the measure of serum total protein in ewes before lambing would be a valuable indicator of the risk of lamb scouring and it would be useful to establish an adequate programme to prevent this condition in the farms of this geographical area.",

A positive relationship was recorded between milk composition and the presence of diarrhoea (Table 1) .

Partially digested milk proceeds along the small bowel, resulting in high concentration of nutrients, specially lactose, in the gut lumen, withdrawing water from interstitial space and favouring the onset of diarrhoea (Radostits et al., 1999) . In addition, due to the climatic conditions of the area, sheep receive more supplements during the lambing period of autumn-winter and they presumably produce richer milk in this season (Izquierdo et al., 2003) .",

In the present experiment a direct relationship between serum gamma globulin in lambs and mortality was recorded (Table 1) . Average gamma globulin levels were 1.3 g/dL. Therefore, in this area and under these husbandry conditions attention should be paid to flocks with average serum gamma globulin in lambs below this point.",

In calves, serum protein values lower than 5.0 g/dL are related to the predisposition to scouring (McGuire and Adams, 1982) . In our experiment this limit would be 5.8 g/dL, the average serum protein value. This influence of serum total protein on lamb mortality rate is supported by the positive correlation found between the individual values of serum total protein and gamma globulin in lambs. This would be very interesting in this area, from a practical point of view; as it would permit to employ this easy technique (clinical rephractometry) instead of more complicated ones such as electrophoresis and laser nephelometry for measuring the risk of lamb scouring.",

In this experiment, subnormal gamma globulin levels were obtained in ewes (average = 1.3 g/dL). This low value suggested that the poor immune status observed in the lambs of the experiment might be linked to the low immune levels of their dams and not to FPT. This was confirmed by the positive correlation between the individual levels of gamma globulin in ewes and their lambs. This fact explained that below 1.3 g/dL more farms showed high mortality (Table 1 ). In our case, this limit would be a good predictor of the probability of lamb scouring episodes in a certain flock.",
