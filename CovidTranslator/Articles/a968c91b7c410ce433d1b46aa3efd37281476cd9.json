Their cognate gene products are highly conserved with the exception of the N-terminal region of the S proteins, which have only 63-64% sequence identity. The N-terminal region of coronavirus S protein is responsible for virus-receptor interaction. In this study, the immunogenicity of the SL-CoV S protein (S SL ) was studied and compared with that of SARS-CoV (S SARS ). DNA immunization in mice with S SL elicited a high titer of antibodies against HIV-pseudotyped S SL . The sera had low cross-reactivity, but no neutralization activity, for the HIV-pseudotyped S SARS . Studies using wild bat sera revealed that it is highly likely that the immunodominant epitopes overlap with the major neutralizing sites of the SL-CoV S protein. These results demonstrated that SL-CoV and SARS-CoV shared only a limited number of immunogenic epitopes in their S proteins and the major neutralization epitopes are substantially different. This work provides useful information for future development of differential serologic diagnosis and vaccines for coronaviruses with different S protein sequences.",

Briefly, 12 lg each of pHIV-Luc (pNL.4.3.Luc.E \u00c0 R \u00c0 ) and plasmid pcDNA3.1 containing various S genes (or empty vector control) were co-transfected into 2 \u00c2 10 6 293T cells in 10 cm dishes by standard calcium phosphate method [6] . The pseudoviruses were purified by ultracentrifugation from cell culture supernatant through a 20% sucrose cushion (10 mL) at 55,000g for 60 min using a Ty70 rotor (Beckman). The pelleted pseudoviruses were dissolved in 100 lL of PBS and stored at \u00c080\u00b0C in aliquots until further use. Antisera. Six field bat sera showing positive (5 of 6) or negative (1 of 6) cross-reactivity with SARS-CoV [1] were used in this study. Hyperimmune mouse sera were generated by DNA immunizations with plasmids pcDNA 3.1(+) containing the codon-optimized fulllength S gene of SARS-CoV BJ01, SL-CoV Rp3, and two chimeric plasmids CS 310-518 and CS 259-518 (see Fig. 1 for diagrams). The pcDNA 3.1(+) vector was used as a negative control. Five groups (five mice per group) of 6-8 week old female BALB/c mice were immunized with 30 lg of plasmid DNA in 30 lL PBS by in vivo electroporation according to the published method [7] . Mice were immunized three times at weeks 0, 3 and 5. Sera were collected at week 8. After injection into the right quadriceps muscle, a pair of electrode needles with 5 mm apart was inserted into the muscle to cover the DNA injection sites and electric pulses were delivered using an electric pulse generator (Electro Square Porator T830 M; BTX, San Diego, CA). Three pulses of 100 V each, followed by three pulses of the opposite polarity, were delivered to each injection site at a rate of one pulse per second. Each pulse lasted for 50 ms.",

We have shown previously that despite substantial antigenic cross-reactivity between bat sera from naturally infected animals and SARS-CoV, there was no crossneutralization detected [1] . This discrepancy could be explained by the low level of sequence identity shared at the N-terminal domain of the S proteins between the two classes of viruses [1, 2] . The N-terminal region of coronavirus S proteins is known to be responsible for virus attachment to susceptible host cells, hence a major target of neutralizing antibodies [4] .

The results obtained clearly demonstrated that mice immunized with BJ01-S, CS 310-518 or CS 259-518 generated antibodies with higher antigenic and neutralizing activity to HIV/BJ01-S and HIV/CS 318-510 than HIV/Rp3-S. Vice versa, mice immunized with Rp3-S displayed higher reactivity to HIV/Rp3-S than HIV/ BJ01-S. These results demonstrated that SL-CoV and SARS-CoV shared only a limited number of immunogenic epitopes in their S proteins and the major neutralization epitopes are substantially different among these two viruses.",
