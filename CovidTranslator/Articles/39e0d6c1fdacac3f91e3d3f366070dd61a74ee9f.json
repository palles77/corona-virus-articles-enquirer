When data were unavailable, we relied on our ensemble modelling techniques to generate the estimates using other available variables and the information for neighbouring countries or countries with a similar health profi le in the region. We used six diff erent modelling strategies for the 240 causes of death using our cause-of-death ensemble model for causes with suffi cient information. We estimated national time series from 1950 to 2013 for gross domestic product, educational attainment, tobacco prevalence, and obesity. For mortality rates of children younger than 5 years, we analysed all survey, census, sample registration, and vital registration sources. Wherever possible, we analysed microdata from surveys and censuses with updated methods for child mortality. We corrected for bias in diff erent sources in specifi c countries. For adult mortality, we identifi ed all available vital registration data, sibling history survey data, sample registration data, and household recall of deaths. We assessed vital registration data for completeness and analysed sibling history data to account for survivor bias, zero-surviving sibships, and recall bias. We used spatiotemporal regression and Gaussian process regression to synthesise all measurements of mortality. We used UN population estimates that account for migration in our analyses.

Causes of death and their rates of change varied by country. 8 There was a change in causes of years of life lost (YLLs) from 1990 to 2013 in all countries (appendix p 9).

Nutritional defi ciencies (mainly iron-defi ciency anaemia) decreased in the region overall, but remained a large burden in low-income countries. For example, nutritional defi ciencies remained one of the leading causes of YLDs in Yemen although the YLDs per 100 000 people decreased slightly by 2% from 1990. 8 Overall, regional DALYs decreased from 54 838 years per 100 000 people in 1990 to about 34 217 years per 100 000 people in 2013.

From 1990 to 2010, Egypt, Libya, Syria, and Yemen had a steady increase in life expectancy of about 0\u00b725 years per year, with a slightly higher increase in females (about 0\u00b73 years) than in males. However, Egypt, Tunisia, and Yemen have lost about 0\u00b725 years of life expectancy due to the uprising that began in 2010. When comparing observed life expectancy to expected life expectancy if no crisis had occurred, we found a large decrease in life expectancy in Libya of more than 9 years for males and 6 years for females. Conversely, a steady decrease in life expectancy was observed in Syria because of the continuing war. Therefore, between 1990 and 2013 life expectancy for Syria would have been 6 years higher than observed for males and 5 years higher for females had the crisis not happened. Moreover, our analyses showed that several countries in the region have experienced a slow-down in lowering infant mortality rate. For example, in Syria the annualised rate of reduction in infant mortality between 2010 to 2013 was -9\u00b71%, in sharp contrast with the rate of decrease of 6\u00b70% before 2010. 9",
