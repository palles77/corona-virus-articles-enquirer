Cells of the innate immune system include phagocytes (neutrophils, monocytes, macrophages), dendritic cells, epithelial cells, basophils, mast cells, eosinophils and natural killer cells.

The molecular components of innate responses include complement, acute-phase proteins, and cyto-and chemokines. The innate immune system also specifically eliminates bacteria after recognizing several conserved microbial motifs, the so-called pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs). PAMPs are highly conserved structures present in large groups of microorganisma, for instance, bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS), peptidoglycan (PGN) or lipoteichoic acid (LTA) . PRRs are present in soluble forms like mannanbinding lectin (MBL) and in form of transmembraneous or intracellular molecules that directly mediate cellular immune responses. These cell-bound receptors include Toll-like receptors (TLRs), NOD-like receptors (NLRs), RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs) and cytosolic DNA receptors. PRRs are expressed by alveolar macrophages, lung epithelial cells and dendritic cells responsible for the first reactions to invading pathogens (Bals and Hiemstra 2004; Opitz et al. 2010 ). Relevant respiratory pathogens causing different types of pneumonia or exacerbations of asthma and COPD are listed in Table 1 .",

The cytoplasmic Toll/ IL-1 receptor homology (TIR) domain is responsible for downstream signaling via TIR adaptor molecules whereas the extracellular leucinerich repeat (LRR) domain most likely mediates ligand binding. TLRs are located either at the cell surface (TLR1, 2, 4-6, 10) or in intracellular lysosomal/endosomal membranes (TLR3, 7-9). In the lung, several host cells including macrophages, dendritic cells (DCs), lung epithelial and endothelial cells express TLRs. Different combinations of TLRs can be found on different respiratory cells (see also Table 2 ) and the simultaneous activation of several TLRs might lead to a more pathogenspecific immune response (Bals and Hiemstra 2004; Krishnan et al. 2007; Knuefermann et al. 2007) . TLR activation by microbial pathogens can also lead to increased TLR expression on the surface of the stimulated cell such as H. influenzae upregulates TLR2-expression on bronchial and alveolar epithelial cells (Fig. 1a, b) . This is important to know since unstimulated epithelial cells show a weak expression of TLR (Imasato et al. 2002) .",

TLR2 recognizes lipoproteins and lipoteichoic acid (LTA) from a variety of Gram-positive and some Gram-negative bacteria as well as from mycobacteria and fungi. After activation, TLR2 forms a heterodimer with TLR6 or TLR1 to recognize (responding to a different panel of lipoproteins) diacyl and triacyl lipopeptides. TLR2 binds to zymosan, a particle of yeast cell wall components, peptidoglycan, a component of the Gram-positive bacteria cell wall, and Pam3Cys-Ser-(Lys)4 hydrochloride (Pam3Cys), a lipohexapeptide analog of the immunologically active N-terminal portion of bacterial lipoprotein (Chaudhuri et al. 2005; Henning et al. 2008) . The enhanced expression of TLR2 at the protein level and the increased expression of TLR2 on the cell surface leads to remarkable induction of mRNA expression for IL-6 and CXCL-8 and after stimulation with PGN. These gene products and others are known to be important for innate immune responses and host defense reactions, upregulated TLR2 in respiratory epithelial cells may consequently enhance the antimicrobial responses of the host (Homma et al. 2004; Reppe et al. 2009 ).",

            "text": "TLR4 plays a central role in the response of cells to LPS, a major component of the Gram-negative cell wall. LPS is bound by LPS-binding protein (LBP), an acute phase protein produced by liver cells and epithelial cells in the lung. LBP transfers LPS to CD14, to constitute the TLR4 complex together with the extracellular protein MD-2. Activation of the TLR4 receptor complex by the recognition of LPS is followed by intracellular signal transduction including the adaptor molecule MyD88 and leading to the production and secretion of proinflammatory cytokines (Wieland et al. 2005; Janardhan et al. 2006) . The regulation of TLR4 expression on the cell surface of bronchial epithelium and alveolar macrophages is discussed controversially (Saito et al. 2005) . In addition to LPS, TLR4 also recognizes pneumolysin (PLN), an intracellular toxin found as an important virulence factor in S. pneumoniae. Interaction of TLR4 and PLN leads to enhanced cytokine production and thus to the elimination of the pathogen from the respiratory tract (Dessing et al. 2008 ). TLR3, TLR7/8 and TLR9 act as intracellular PRRs as they are located in the endosome. TLR3 detects doublestranded (ds)RNA which is an intermediate in viral replication, as well as possibly endogenous mRNA released from necrotic cells, and TLR7/8 respond to viral singlestranded (ss)RNA. TLR5 recognizes extracellular bacterial flagellin. TLR9 responds to microbial DNA by recognizing cytosine-guanine pairs in the DNA, the so-called CpG-DNA (Opitz et al. 2010; Chaudhuri et al. 2005) . Analogous to TLR2 expression of TLR9 is increased by bacterial pathogens (Fig. 1c -e). The ligand for TLR10 has not yet been identified (Bals and Hiemstra 2004; Hippenstiel et al. 2006 ).",

Caspase-1 and RIP2/CARDIAK are necessary for the activation of proinflammatory cytokines such as pro-IL-1\u03b2 and for the induction of NF-\u03baB.

First of all PAMP, e.g., LPS or MDP, activating receptors on the cell surface or in the intracellular compartment leading to NF-\u03baB-dependent transcription of immature cytokines (e.g., proIL-1\u03b2) which become processed and secreted after a second activating signal. This is mostly mediated by damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) that might be released after tissue damage from necrotic cells, like ATP, hyaluronan or uric acid crystals, leading to caspase-1dependent cleavage of proIL-1\u03b2 into mature IL-1\u03b2. Initially, stimulation with any of these second signals leads to the formation of a large complex containing NLRP3, caspase-1, and the adaptor protein, ASC. Studies in genetargeted mice suggest that the inflammatory response to these DAMPs is crucial for the pathogenesis of, e.g., acute lung injury and perhaps other lung diseases (Opitz et al. 2010; Abdul-Sater et al. 2009 ). RIG-I-deficiency leads to decreased IFN\u03b1/\u03b2 responses to, e.g., influenza A virus and respiratory syncytial virus, whereas MDA5 deficiency led to decreased cytokine production induced after infection with picornaviruses. It is hypothesized that RIG-I and MDA5 mediate virus recognition in most cell types including macrophages, conventional DCs and pulmonary epithelial cells, whereas TLRs are essential for antiviral responses by plasmacytoid DCs (Opitz et al. 2010; Kato et al. 2006) .",

In addition, activation of the inflammasome by DAMPs might be another mechanism contributing to the pathogenesis of COPD. Inhaled toxic agents, oxidative stress, infections, necrotic cell death, as well as hypoxia, hypercapnia, focal hypoperfusion and tissue acidification might lead to release of DAMPs (e.g., uric acid, ATP) by damaged lung tissue which activates the NLRP3 inflammasome. Uric acid concentrations were increased in broncho-alveolar fluids of COPD patients and smokers. Furthermore, COPD patients showed significantly reduced concentrations of IL-1\u03b2 antagonists compared with controls (Opitz et al. 2010) .",

As described by Didierlaurent et al. impaired immune responses to bacterial infections, including desensitization to TLR signals, can be observed after infections with influenza virus or respiratory syncytial virus. Although such desensitization may be beneficial for prevention of overwhelming immune responses, the reduced neutrophil recruitment might contribute to severe secondary bacterial pneumonia.

Recognition of invading pathogens and cell injury-associated endogenous molecules by pattern recognition receptors expressed on phagocytes and epithelial cells lead to a differentiated immune reaction. Acute inflammatory reactions are supposed to eliminate the pathogen, but also implicate tissue destruction. Therefore, PRRmediated signaling pathways are critical for the balance between host protection and tissue homeostasis. Considering this key role in infectious and non-infectious lung diseases therapeutic approaches, targeting this system should be strengthened. Many details have been characterized recently on the innate immune system. However, severaldetails are so far only known for experimental animals (mostly mice) and have to be studied in the human lung in future.",

The RNA helicases retinoic acid inducible gene-I (RIG-I) and melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 (MDA5) belong to the RIG-I-like receptor (RLRs) family. Both proteins show IFN-inducible expression in different host cells including alveolar macrophages and lung epithelial cells. They consist of a carboxy-terminal DexD/H box RNA helicase domain mediating the recognition of the dsRNA and two CARD domains mediating the downstream signal transduction. Both helicases signal through multiple downstream adapter molecules resulting in production of the antiviral type I IFNs (e.g., IFN-\u03b1/-\u03b2) and NF-\u03baB-dependent induction of inflammatory cytokines. Kato et al. described that both RIG-I and MDA5 detect RNA viruses and polyinosine-polycytidylic acid (poly(I:C)), a synthetic dsRNA analogue. Nevertheless the recognition of RNA viruses is differentially mediated via RIG-I and MDA5(Wilkins and Gale 2010).",
