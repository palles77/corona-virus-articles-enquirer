Electron-microscopic immunogold cytochemistry, with both polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies, demonstrated these enzymes at opposite poles of the cells and in distinct intracellular sites. Kallikrein was found within apical secretory granules, whereas Na,K-ATPase was present on basolateral cell membranes. In addition, kallikrein was localized throughout cisternae of all Golgi profiles, whereas Na,K-ATPase (~-subunit) was found only in small peripheral vesicles and/or lateral cisternal extensions of a basal subset of Golgi profiles. These differences in the subcellular distribution of the two marker antigens were most clearly seen with double immunogold labelling. Our results suggest that kallikrein, an apical, regulated secretory protein, and Na,K-ATPase, a basolateral, constitutively transported membrane protein, are segregated at (or prior to) the level of the Golgi apparatus rather than in the trans-Golgi network (TGN), as was expected.",

Simson consisting of rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER), Golgi membranes, and a variety of vesicles, vacuoles and granules, traversed sequentially (Palade 1975) . At least two pathways exist for the transit of proteins to the cell periphery: 1) a regulated pathway, for secretory material stored in granules and discharged in response to specific stimuli, and 2) a constitutive pathway, for macromolecules which leave the system without selective retardation (Burgess and Kelly 1987; Farquhar 1991) . Most components of the plasma membrane apparently follow the constitutive pathway (Caplan and Matlin 1989) . Currently under intense investigation are the mechanisms underlying this sorting and traffic among the various intracellular membrane compartments (Bartles and Hubbard 1988; Mostov et al. 1992) .",

Tissue kallikrein is one member of a family of serine proteases found in salivary glands, kidneys, and several other tissues (Clements 1989) . Among other actions, kallikrein has been implicated in ion transport processes, perhaps by means of local kinin production (Bhoola et al. 1992) . Na,K-ATPase is an evolutionarily conserved ion transport enzyme, found in most animal cell membranes as a complex consisting of separately translated and processed ~-and 13-subunits. Although the ~-subunit appears to carry out all enzyme functions and to be the target of inhibitors, functional cell surface expression of the enzyme appears to require association of the ~-and [3-subunits (Geering 1990 ).",

The advantage of initial screening with this method at the light-microscopic level is that the same concentrations of primary antibody could then be used on thin sections for electron microscopy. Following the initial screening, thin sections (80-100 rim) were cut from the same block face for electron-microscopic immunocytochemistry and picked up on nickel grids that had been previously coated with parlodion and carbon.

Either 14 nm or 8 nm gold, coated with protein A, was used in the second step of the procedure. Grids were rinsed thoroughly with PBS between incubation steps by a combination of jet washing and passing through PBS-containing wells. In single-label studies only a single primary antibody was used as the first step of the procedure. The ranges of antibody dilutions used were: rabbit anti-kallikrein, 1 : 100-1:500; rabbit anti-Na,K-ATPase, 1:50-1:200; V4D11, 1:50-1:100. The primary antibody was followed (after thorough rinsing in PBS) either with protein A-gold or with colloidal gold coated with an appropriate secondary antibody (RAM, GaM, or GaR). In incubations with the monoclonal antibody (V4Dll) as the primary reagent followed by protein A-gold, RaM was usually used as an intermediate step to provide better and more consistent binding of the protein A-gold. Double-label incubations were performed with primary antibodies originating in different species: e.g., polycIonal (rabbit) anti-Na,K-ATPase with monoclonal (mouse) V4D11 (antikallikrein), mixed at appropriate dilutions in the first incubation step, followed by a mixture of GaR-gold of one size and GaM-gold of another size, as described previously (Simsou et al. 1989 ). The protein A-gold or antibody-gold suspensions were used at ODszs of 0.1-0.5 for 14 nm gold and 0.02-0.1 for 8 nm gold.",

Mechanisms for establishing the polarity of these proteins must depend upon differences in molecular signals that interact with the subcellular sorting machinery. The two molecules examined in this study differ in several important respects. Kallikrein is a secreted protein (Simson et al. 1979) , whereas Na,K-ATPase is an integral membrane protein. Kallikrein is hydrophilic and contains carbohydrate side groups (Fiedler 1979) , whereas the ~-subunit of Na,K-ATPase has several hydrophobic domains but no carbohydrates (Shull et al. 1985; Tamkun and Fambrough 1986) . Nonetheless, secretory and membrane proteins are considered to follow a common intracellular pathway through the Golgi apparatus, to be sorted in the TGN (Griffiths and Simons 1986; Caplan and Matlin 1989; Farquhar 1991) .",

Transit from RER to storage granule normally involves modification of carbohydrates in the Golgi apparatus (Farquhar 1991 ) and further processing, such as proteolytic trimming, in a post-Golgi compartment, e.g., condensing vacuole or immature secretory granule (Orci et al. 1987 ).

At the TGN, the pathways are believed to diverge, with small, constitutive vesicles transported quickly (within 10-30 min) to the cell surface and discharged without awaiting a further secretory signal (Burgess and Kelly 1987) . The evidence accumulated to date suggests that many normal plasma membrane proteins, as well as viral membrane and/or coat proteins, follow this latter pathway, intercalated into the membranes of small vesicles (Rodriguez-Boulan and Sabatini 1978; Strous et al. 1983; Orci et al. 1987) .",

The Na,K-ATPase ~-subunit, destined for basolateral membrane insertion, appears to skirt the main Golgi cisternae and to form a peripheral (and probably transient) connection with this organelle. Differences in the intensity of labelling for the two marker proteins in the Golgi apparatus might result from differences in transit times through this organelle; however, differences in distribution would not. Several reasons can be postulated for a differential distribution of the two proteins within Golgi stacks. Kallikrein is a soluble secretory protein which could diffuse into the cisternae from transition vesicles upon fusion of the two compartments. Na,K-ATPase, by contrast, is integrated into the membrane via several transmembrane loops (Shull et al. 1985) , and would diffuse less readily in the cisternal membrane plane. Moreover, Na,K-ATPase is largely bound to ankyrin, which would further limit its diffusibility in the membrane (Nelson and Veshnock 1987; Koob et al. 1988; Morrow et al. 1989) . Kallikrein is a siaiylated protein (Fiedler 1979 ) and thus must contain signals directing it to sialylation sites in Golgi cisternae. The ~-subunit of Na,K-ATPase, by contrast, has little or no carbohydrate (Tamkun and Fambrough 1986 ) and may not be directed to Golgi cisternae. If the Na,K-ATPase ~-subunit forms a complex with the glycosylated [3-subunit prior to insertion into the plasma membrane, an association (perhaps transient) of the ~subunit with the Golgi apparatus would allow complex formation to occur before transport to the plasma membrane.",

These studies have been performed on animals of several species, in different developmental stages, and in different tissues. While both subunits are relatively conserved in terms of amino acid composition (see Geering 1990) , interpretation of the data is complicated by the fact that both subunits have tissue-specific isoforms (Fambrough and Bayne 1983; Felsenfeld and Sweadner 1988) . The time course for processing of the enzyme, and perhaps even its intracellular route of traffic and targeting to the cell surface, may be quite different, for example, in Xenopus oocytes (Ackerman and Geering 1990 ) and chick sensory neurons (Tamkun and Fambrough 1986) . Very little is known about the actual intracellular routes of transport of Na,K-ATPase from sites of synthesis to the plasma membrane. Differences in data and interpretation in these studies may also reflect species or tissue differences in sorting and membrane targeting of the subunits. The lack of agreement in these studies suggests that the a-subunit, at least, may not follow the canonical model for membrane protein synthesis and targeting (also suggested by Caplan et al. 1986 ). This subunit differs from most proteins examined in cell membrane trafficking studies, in that it lacks a hydrophobic N-terminal signal peptide but possesses multiple hydrophobic domains in the primary translation product (Shull et al. 1985) .",

            "text": "Nonetheless, the present study, in conjunction with data from other studies, may provide some insight and offer plausible interpretations of apparently contradictory data. Since our immunocytochemistry localized only the ~-subunit, the subcellular localization of the 13-subunit remains conjectural; additional studies need to be performed. However, the 13-subunit is highly glycosylated m its mature form, and we postulate that it traverses the main Golgi stacks during processing. Complete glycosylation of the 13-subunit requires 45-90 min (or longer) to complete (Tamkun and Fambrough 1986; Ackermann and Geering 1990) , whereas the a-subunit apparently binds stably to the 13-subunit within 15 min of synthesis (Tamkun and Fambrough 1986) . Other evidence suggests early postsynthetic (10-20 rain) stabilization and activation of the ~-subunit (Caplan et al. 1990; Geering 1990 ). This may result, at least in part, from association with the [3-subunit. It is possible that newly synthesized ~-subunit binds to previously synthesized and glycosylated [3-subunit in lateral Golgi cisternal extensions and shuttle vesicles. If this hypothesis is true, newly synthesized ~-and ~-subunits might appear at the celt surface with different time courses. Complete processing of core sugars of the [3-subunit is apparently not necessary for Na,K-ATPase activity of the enzyme complex (Geering 1990) . Shuttling of vesicles between cell membrane and basolateral Golgi stacks could result in a prolonged time course of glycosylation of the [~-subunit, and a sizeable intracellular vesicle-bound pool of the enzyme.",

            "text": "Another unexpected finding in the present study was that only about a third of the Golgi profiles were associated with vesicles stained for Na,K-ATPase. These were either basal or lateral to the nucleus of striated duct cells, near membranes into which the enzyme would be inserted. In contrast, kallikrein was demonstrable in all Golgi profiles in these cells, whether apical (in the expected direction of secretory transport) or basal. This suggests that Golgi stacks of a given cell may be \"regionally specialized\" to subserve processing and/or traffic of a subset of molecules for export. Examples already exist of regional subcellular localization of contents in endoplasmic reticulum (Deschuyteneer et al. 1988; Ellinger and Pavelka 1992) . The controversy concerning membrane delivery of Na,K-ATPase in MDCK cells, that is, whether the enzyme is delivered exclusively to the basolateral cell surface (Caplan et al. 1986 (Caplan et al. , 1990 Boll et al. 1991) , or randomly delivered to both apical and basal surfaces, with selective removal of apical enzyme (Hammerton et al. 1991; Mays and Nelson 1992) may reflect the fact that in one system (Hammerton et al. 1991 ) the MDCK cells had recently been induced to form tight junctions and achieve polarity, whereas in the other system (Caplan et al. 1986) , MDCK cells had exhibited stable polarity for the duration of culture. If \"regionally specialized\" Golgi stacks can contribute to polarized delivery of cell-surface constituents, as suggested by observations in the present sudies, then in \"newly polarized\" cells, the Golgi stacks may not have achieved the regional differentiation required for non-random delivery of Na,K-ATPase to the cell surface membrane.",

These models have provided numerous insights into the mechanisms of intracellular traffic. It is clear, however, that tissue culture and genetic engineering are artificial systems that may result in anomalous information for unexpected reasons. In the system investigated in the present study, two endogenous cell products, targeted to separate cellular domains by means of normal subcellular sorting machinery, were localized simultaneously with double-label immunogold cytochemistry. Our results suggest that kallikrein and Na, K-ATPase are sorted prior to or during transit through the Golgi compartment, rather than in the TGN, where most secretory and membrane proteins appear to be sorted.",
