            "text": "In patients with stones in their bile ducts and gallbladders, cholecystectomy is generally recommended after endoscopic sphincterotomy and clearance of bile duct stones. However, only approximately 10% of patients with gallbladders left in situ will return with further biliary complications. Expectant management is alternately advocated. In this study, we compared the treatment strategies of laparoscopic cholecystectomy and gallbladders left in situ. Methods: We randomized patients (>60 years of age) after endoscopic sphincterotomy and clearance of their bile duct stones to receive early laparoscopic cholecystectomy or expectant management. The primary outcome was further biliary complications. Other outcome measures included adverse events after cholecystectomy and late deaths from all causes. Results: One hundred seventy-eight patients entered into the trial (89 in each group); 82 of 89 patients who were randomized to receive laparoscopic cholecystectomy underwent the procedure. Conversion to open surgery was needed in 16 of 82 patients (20%). Postoperative complications occurred in 8 patients (9%). Analysis was by intention to treat. With a median follow-up of approximately 5 years, 6 patients (7%) in the cholecystectomy group returned with further biliary events (cholangitis, n \u202b\u060d\u202c 5; biliary pain, n \u202b\u060d\u202c 1). Among those with gallbladders in situ, 21 (24%) returned with further biliary events (cholangitis, n \u202b\u060d\u202c 13; acute cholecystitis, n \u202b\u060d\u202c 5; biliary pain, n \u202b\u060d\u202c 2; and jaundice, n \u202b\u060d\u202c 1; log rank, P \u202b\u060d\u202c .001). Late deaths were similar between groups (cholecystectomy, n \u202b\u060d\u202c 19; gallbladder in situ, n \u202b\u060d\u202c 11; P \u202b\u060d\u202c .12). Conclusions: In the Chinese, cholecystectomy after endoscopic treatment of bile duct stones reduces recurrent biliary events and should be recommended. E ndoscopic sphincterotomy and stone extraction have gained wide acceptance in the management of bile duct stones. Complete stone removal after endoscopic sphincterotomy can be achieved in \u03fe90% of cases with low morbidity and negligible mortality. 1 After endoscopic removal of bile duct stones, the need for cholecystectomy in patients with concomitant gallstones is disputed. Many contend that endoscopic management of bile duct stones with gallbladders left in situ is definitive in elderly and high-risk patients. Retrospective and prospective series have suggested that further biliary complications occur in 4%-24% of patients after varying periods of follow-up, and the rate of subsequent cholecystectomy is 5.8%-18%. [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] As a treatment of the complication of biliary pancreatitis, ablation of the sphincter allows free passage of stones into the duodenum. Endoscopic sphincterotomy may in itself be definitive in prophylaxis against further attacks.",

            "text": "Many advocate for a single-stage cholecystectomy and bile duct exploration as the primary treatment of bile duct stones. The strategy was compared with endoscopic treatment in 2 randomized studies. Hammarstrom et al 9 randomized 83 patients and found that recurrent biliaryrelated events occurred in 28% of patients initially treated by endoscopy compared with 5% in those who underwent open cholecystectomy and bile duct exploration. In a similar study involving 98 patients with a mean age of 80 years, recurrent biliary symptoms occurred in fewer patients treated by operation (3 of 48 vs 10 of 50). 10 Both studies concluded that surgery would be preferable in the treatment of bile duct stones. We argue that the added cholecystectomy during open surgery in these 2 trials could explain the fewer recurrent biliary events. In a European multicenter study, a singlestage laparoscopic cholecystectomy and bile duct exploration was compared with a 2-stage endoscopic sphincterotomy followed by laparoscopic cholecystectomy in patients with bile duct stones. 11 A single-stage approach led to shorter hospitalization. Long-term follow-up data in these patients were lacking. Skill in laparoscopic bile duct explorations remains sparse and confined to a few expert centers. Although open or laparoscopic cholecystectomy and bile duct exploration may be appropriate as a treatment of uncomplicated bile duct stones, many patients present with acute cholangitis or pancreatitis. In these emergencies, endoscopic therapy is preferred and leads to better outcome. 12, 13 Endoscopic sphincterotomy is likely to prevail as the primary treatment of bile duct stones. The real issue is the need for subsequent cholecystectomy, particularly among older patients. We therefore compared the 2 treatment strategies of early elective cholecystectomy or leaving gallbladders in situ in patients \u03fe60 years after endoscopic sphincterotomy and removal of bile duct stones.",

Consecutive patients who underwent endoscopic sphincterotomy and complete removal of bile duct stones at the Prince of Wales Hospital were eligible for trial entry if they met all of the following criteria: (1) they were older than 60 years, (2) they received complete endoscopic sphincterotomy (defined by free bile flow and passage of a fully bowed sphincterotome with a 25-mm wire), (3) there was radiological evidence of an intact gallbladder containing gallstones, and (4) there was no previous hospitalization for cholecystitis. In patients with cholangitis, we initially decompressed the bile duct by inserting a nasobiliary catheter or a short stent across the sphincter to avoid aggravating systemic sepsis and contaminating the gallbladder. Definitive stone removal was performed after sepsis resolution. Complete clearance of the bile duct was ensured by obtaining a balloon occlusion cholangiogram at the end of procedure. Patients were excluded if there was evidence of concomitant intrahepatic ductal stones, radiological evidence of recurrent pyogenic cholangitis, no consent to trial entry, or intercurrent malignancy with a limited life span or if they were deemed unfit for cholecystectomy (those belonging to American Society of Anesthesiologists grade IV or V).",

First, our trial represented a single-center experience, and consecutive patients with bile duct stones were accounted for.

This was again observed in our study. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy should be performed early to gain maximal efficacy in preventing cholecystitis. In approximately 10% of our patients assigned to cholecystectomy, acute cholecystitis was present at operation. In patients with cholangitis or pancreatitis, gallbladders, being part of the biliary tree, are often found inflamed at early cholecystectomy. Gallbladders may have been contaminated during instrumentation and occlusion cholangiogram at ERCP. In our protocol, we endeavored to reduce such risks by providing initial drainage to the bile duct before definitive removal of stones in patients with cholangitis. After resolution of biliary sepsis, the rate of subsequent cholecystitis is, however, lower. Patients with nonfilling of their gallbladders at ERCP were thought to be at risk of subsequent cholecystitis and biliary pain. 17 Because of the small number of outcome events in our trial, an ancillary analysis would be of limited value.",

Some have suggested that ablation of the sphincter could lead to ascending biliary tract infection from enteric organisms and, thereby, increase the risk of cholecystitis. In a randomized study that compared endoscopic sphincterotomy and balloon sphincteroplasty in the treatment of bile duct stones, acute cholecystitis occurred in 7 of 71 patients treated by sphincterotomy, as compared with 1 of 75 patients assigned to balloon sphincter dilation. 18 Other studies showed that endoscopic sphincterotomy reduces gallbladder filling and increases gallbladder emptying. Augmented gallbladder contractility may in theory reduce the risk of acute cholecystitis. 19, 20 The issue is largely unresolved. There are inherent limitations to our study. First, we arbitrarily recruited patients \u03fe60 years. The European Society of Gerontology defined an elderly patient to be someone older than 65. Patients should, however, be assessed by their physiological rather than chronological ages. Using the same argument, we did not impose an upper age limit during recruitment. Second, a significant proportion of our patients, as a result of advanced age or perceived comorbid illnesses, were unwilling to undertake surgery with its attendant risks and, therefore, did not participate. Patients who entered the trial could represent a group with less risk. The scenario is, however, closer to real clinical practice, in which elderly patients are often reluctant to receive cholecystectomy after successful endoscopic sphincterotomy and clearance of bile duct stones. Third, Hong Kong Chinese may have a higher incidence of primary pigment stones when compared with the white population. The inclusion of such patients in our trial may explain the higher rate of recurrent cholangitis and a lower rate of cholecystitis. Our findings may therefore not be extrapolated to the Western population.",
