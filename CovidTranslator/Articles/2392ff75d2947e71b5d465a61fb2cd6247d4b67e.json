            "text": "Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) infection in Vero cells is facilitated by trypsin through an undefined mechanism. The present study describes the mode of action of trypsin in enhancing PEDV infection in Vero cells during different stage of the virus life cycle. During the viral entry stage, trypsin increased the penetration of Vero-cellattached PEDV by approximately twofold. However, trypsin treatment of viruses before receptor binding did not enhance infectivity, indicating that receptor binding is essentially required for trypsin-mediated entry upon PEDV infection. Trypsin treatment during the budding stage of virus infection induces an obvious cytopathic effect in infected cells. Furthermore, we also show that the PEDV spike (S) glycoprotein is cleaved by trypsin in virions that are bound to the receptor, but not in free virions. These findings indicate that trypsin affects only cell-attached PEDV and increases infectivity and syncytium formation in PEDV-infected Vero cells by cleavage of the PEDV S protein. These findings strongly suggest that the PEDV S protein may undergo a conformational change after receptor binding and cleavage by exogenous trypsin, which induces membrane fusion.",

            "text": "Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), a member of the family Coronaviridae, is an economically important pathogen of swine. PEDV causes acute watery diarrhea, resulting in approximately 50% mortality among suckling piglets and reduced weight among fattening pigs [10] . Although the structural and pathological properties of PEDV are similar to those of other group 1 coronavirus, including human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E), transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) and feline infectious peritonitis virus, many biological issues, such as the role of trypsin in infection, remain unresolved [7, 12, 36] . The first successful propagation of PEDV in cell culture was done by supplementing the Vero cell culture medium with trypsin [15] . The addition of trypsin was shown to induce fusion of the infected Vero cells, resulting in the formation of multiple syncytia, and produced a significant increase in virus titer after several passages. Soon afterwards, several other groups performed PEDV infection in vitro using the same conditions and reported similar findings [20, 21] . On the other hand, another study reported the successful propagation of the P-5 V strain in porcine enterocyte cell lines without trypsin supplementation of the medium, suggesting that the proteolytic processing of PEDV in enterocytes may have occurred during maturation or prior to virus release [17] .",

            "text": "Trypsin mediates the penetration of cell-attached PEDV To investigate how trypsin enhances PEDV infectivity of Vero cells, trypsin was added during various stages of infection. Trypsin treatment of KPEDV-9 prior to inoculation did not significantly differ from non-trypsin-treated virus after 20 hpi (1.24 9 10 4 and 1.32 9 10 4 ffu/ml, respectively) (Fig. 3) . This suggests that proteolytic processing of the surface glycoprotein by trypsin prior to receptor binding does not have a significant effect on enhancing infectivity. To determine whether trypsin interaction with Vero-cell-surface proteins contributes to enhanced PEDV infectivity, Vero cells were pre-treated with 10 lg/ml trypsin for 30 min before inoculation. This treatment did not significantly alter virus titer when compared to the untreated cells. Interestingly, addition of trypsin immediately after inoculation during the absorption To investigate the mechanism of trypsin in more detail, Vero-cell-bound PEDV was treated with trypsin. Vero cells were inoculated with KPEDV-9 in serum-and trypsin-free media for 2 h and then washed twice to remove un-bound KPEDV-9. The cell-bound KPEDV-9 was treated with different concentrations of trypsin for 10 min, and the titers of penetrating and produced virus were determined. When the concentration of trypsin in the medium was increased from 5 lg/ml to 80 lg/ml, the number of PEDV penetrating the Vero cells also increased from 4 9 10 2 ffu/ml to 9 9 10 2 ffu/ml. The enhanced trypsin-mediated penetration during initial infection resulted in an increase in virus titer at 24 hpi, from 3.0 9 10 4 ffu/ml to 1.0 9 10 5 ffu/ml (Fig. 4) . These findings are consistent with the notion that trypsin activity during the initial stage of virus infection enhances the efficiency of virus penetration into Vero cells, thereby increasing viral infectivity. Although the penetration of cell-attached virions was facilitated by trypsin treatment, virions treated with trypsin before cell attachment did not show any difference when compared to the results obtained in the absence of trypsin. Based on these findings, it is appropriate to suggest that trypsin might only affect the receptor-bound spike, inducing fusion between the cell membrane and the virus envelope, leading to increased virus penetration.",

            "text": "To investigate the role of trypsin on the late stage of infection and syncytium formation, KPEDV-9-infected Vero cells were prepared by inoculation for 20 h. The cells were washed extensively and treated with various concentrations of trypsin for 10 min prior to continuing cell cultivation in fresh serum-and trypsin-free medium. KPEDV-9-infected Vero cells did not show visible signs of syncytium formation in the absence of trypsin, while KPEDV-9-infected Vero cells treated with 5, 10 and 20 lg/ml trypsin at 20 hpi contained multiple syncytia (Fig. 5A) . Without trypsin treatment, the virus titer at 4 hpi was 1.4 9 10 3 ffu/ml while KPEDV-9-infected Vero cells treated with 5, 10, 20, 40 and 80 lg/ml trypsin showed virus titers of 2.1 9 10 3 , 3.0 9 10 3 , 3.5 9 10 3 , 4.1 9 10 3 and 6.7 9 10 3 ffu/ml, respectively (Fig. 5B) . In virus budding stage, trypsin also activated syncytium formation of infected Vero cells and consequently increased virus infectivity. Newly packaged virions budding from infected Vero cells could be activated by trypsin, which caused the infected Vero cells to form syncytia. This finding was consistent with the previous results shown in Figs. 3 and 4 . The collective results supported the idea that trypsin acts on cell-attached virions, both during virus attachment and during virus release and induces membrane fusion between the host-cell membrane and the virus envelope, and also between host-cell membranes. Cleavage of receptor-bound S protein by trypsin The S protein from ultrapurified virions and receptor-bound virions was treated with trypsin and analyzed by western blotting. S protein from both ultrapurified virions and KPEDV-9-infected Vero cells that had not been treated with trypsin was apparent as a species of about 220 kDa, which represented the glycosylated native S protein (Fig. 6) . In ultrapurified virus, only this protein species was detected, even after trypsin treatment, while 140-kDa and 125-kDa proteins, likely trypsin-cleaved S protein, were detected in trypsin-treated KPEDV-9-infected Vero cells (Fig. 6) . The findings supported the suggestion that PEDV S protein has a site that is highly sensitive to trypsin cleavage to produce two fragments, as has been reported for other coronaviruses [23, 24, 32] . However, this Fig. 4 Enhancement of cellattached KPEDV-9 penetration by trypsin. Vero cells were inoculated with KPEDV-9 for 2 h and then washed to remove unbound KPEDV-9. Only cellattached KPEDV-9 was treated with trypsin for 30 min, and penetrated virus (j) and progeny virus were titrated after 24 h (h). Increasing the amount of trypsin added during virus adsorption resulted in increased virus penetration into Vero cells during initial entry and higher virus titers after 24 hpi cleavage only occurred when the virus was associated with receptor protein.",

            "text": "Several enterotropic or pneumotropic viruses, such as those belonging to the families Orthomyxoviridae and Paramyxoviridae, undergo proteolytic cleavage of their surface glycoprotein prior to entry into host cells to facilitate virus penetration by activating the fusion domain of the surface glycoprotein [6, 26] . The activated fusion protein undergoes conformational changes that induce fusion of the viral envelope and host membranes [3, 27, 30] . This process usually occurs during the period between virus maturation and virus attachment to the host receptors [25, 33] . After the fusion process, the viral core, including the viral genome, is transported into the cytoplasm where uncoating and replication ensue [22] . In natural infections, the viral surface glycoproteins that are not cleaved during maturation are subsequently cleaved by exogenous proteases secreted from host pancreas, liver and bronchiolar epithelia [19] . In cell culture, the protease cleavage that is required for virus propagation is carried out by exogenous proteases such as trypsin or pancreatin [1, 15, 28] . These exogenous proteases induce syncytium formation by activating the fusion domain of the viral glycoprotein expressed on the surface of infected cells [2, 16] .",

Mutations that alter the furin protease recognition sequence (RXR/KR) located at the junction of the S1 and S2 subunits as well as treatment with a peptide furin inhibitor prevent the proteolytic cleavage of the S protein, resulting in reduced cell-cell fusion activity, although viral entry is not significantly affected [4, 9, 14] . Conversely, the addition of trypsin to the culture medium can enhance the fusion of MHV-infected cells [13] .

            "text": "Similar to SARS-CoV, the S protein in most group 1 coronaviruses also does not exhibit cleaved S1 and S2 subunits during virus maturation and biogenesis [34] . Several studies on TGEV and PEDV have used trypsinsupplemented culture media to induce CPE by syncytium formation in ST cells and Vero cells, respectively [15, 31] . Furthermore, in the case of PEDV, trypsin facilitates successful propagation in Vero cells as well as other primate cell lines [15, 20] . However, the role of cellular and exogenous proteases on the cell entry of group 1 coronaviruses, particularly PEDV, as well as the putative proteolytic cleavage site on the S protein, remains unclear. Based on the present results summarized in Figs. 3, 4 and 5, enhancement of virus penetration and cellcell fusion induced by the addition of trypsin suggests that the PEDV S protein may also be cleaved into S1 and S2 subunits during the course of infection. Electrophoretic examination of purified virions resulted in the detection of the PEDV S protein as a monomer of about 220 kDa in the absence of trypsin, while the protein was detected as two fragments of 140 kDa and 125 kDa in the presence of trypsin (Fig. 6) . It may be that the PEDV S protein on native virions adopts a conformation that protects it from various exogenous proteases, but the S protein attached to the host receptor protein may undergo a conformational change that exposes a trypsin cleavage site. Previous reports have described the formation of syncytia by PEDVinfected cells only upon addition of trypsin in the culture medium, and sequence analysis of the PEDV S protein has revealed the absence of the RRX(R/H)R motif, which is associated with cleavage into the S1 and S2 subunits [11] . This suggests that the PEDV surface glycoprotein does not undergo proteolytic processing upon maturation and release. Conversely, the observation that trypsin can induce temperature for 10 min. PEDV S was detected using anti-PEDV polyclonal antibodies raised in mice. Uncleaved S protein and cleaved S protein are indicated by black and white arrows, respectively cell-cell fusion in PEDV-infected cells suggests that proteolytic processing of the S protein by exogenous trypsin may augment viral entry by facilitating fusion of the viral membrane with the host membranes [11, 15] .",

As shown in Fig. 3 , early activation of the S protein before binding to cellular receptors did not enhance viral entry into the host cell, while addition of trypsin shortly after receptor binding increased the efficiency of virus entry. While the S protein in infected cell lysates and receptorbound virions was cleaved into two fragments, the S protein cleavage in PEDV was different from that of other coronaviruses, as PEDV S protein was only cleaved when associated with its host cell. This implies that cleavage of the S protein by trypsin occurs only when it is bound at the surface of host cells to the host receptor protein, which presumably induces a conformational change in the bound S protein. This conformational change might expose a trypsin cleavage site. Cleavage of the S protein could result in membrane fusion. It would be of interest to determine the nature of the conformational change that is involved and the location of the S protein cleavage site.",

Trypsin is not essential for PEDV infection but enhances its infectivity and CPE formation. Trypsin cleaves PEDV S protein only when it bound its cell receptor and in the later stages of infection. The association of the S protein with the host receptor could induce conformational changes that expose a trypsin cleavage site(s). The resulting cleavage might expose or activate the fusion peptide and activate PEDV entry and pathogenesis.",
