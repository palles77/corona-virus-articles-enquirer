US showed rounded lymphadenopathy with chaotic vascularisation in the right inguinal and left supraclavicular regions with maximum diameter of 21\u00d713 mm and 17\u00d710 mmn respectively. Surgical biopsy of the right inguinal lymph nodes was performed and the histological examination result was reported as a morphological aspect consistent with massive metastasis of KS (figure 3). On immunohistochemistry (IHC), diffuse positivity for HHV8 and CD34 was seen in the tumoural area, and that for factor VIII, actin and smooth muscle actin in the rich vasculature. At the same time, an HIV test was positive (HIV-1 gp120, gp41, p24 and p17 were detected), and a T-lymphocyte count in peripheral blood showed no CD4 + cells, and reduced counts of CD3 + and CD16/56 + CD3 \u2212 cells.

In light of this clinical picture, a diagnosis of KS was made.",

It is the most common tumour associated with HIV-1 infection; indeed, the incidence among patients infected with HIV is one in 20 [2, 3] . Four clinical variants of KS have been described: localisation occurs in 20-75% of cases, particularly in severely immunocompromised patients with low CD4 + counts, with involvement of the lung parenchyma, pleura, LNs and airways [6] [7] [8] [9] . Reports of isolated pulmonary disease have rarely appeared in the literature (0-16% of cases) [6, 7] .",

However, chest radiography may be normal. A CT scan is more sensible and specific, and can show irregular, poorly defined nodules with speculated borders and peribronchovascular distribution, interstitial thickening and perinodular ground-glass halo signs (due to haemorrhage secondary to fragility of the neovascular tissue). Irregular narrowing of the bronchial lumen, interlobular septal thickening, air-space consolidation and pleural effusion may be associated with the aforementioned findings [6, 8] . Lymphadenopathy can be present in up to 30-35% of patients. The effusion can be transudative or exudative and is often haemorrhagic because of the vascular nature of the disease [10] .",
