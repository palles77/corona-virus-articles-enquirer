            "text": "We have used a combination of virtual screening (VS) and high-throughput screening (HTS) techniques to identify novel, non-peptidic small molecule inhibitors against human SARS-CoV 3CLpro. A structurebased VS approach integrating docking and pharmacophore based methods was employed to computationally screen 621,000 compounds from the ZINC library. The screening protocol was validated using known 3CLpro inhibitors and was optimized for speed, improved selectivity, and for accommodating receptor flexibility. Subsequently, a fluorescence-based enzymatic HTS assay was developed and optimized to experimentally screen approximately 41,000 compounds from four structurally diverse libraries chosen mainly based on the VS results. False positives from initial HTS hits were eliminated by a secondary orthogonal binding analysis using surface plasmon resonance (SPR). The campaign identified a reversible small molecule inhibitor exhibiting mixed-type inhibition with a K i value of 11.1 lM. Together, these results validate our protocols as suitable approaches to screen virtual and chemical libraries, and the newly identified compound reported in our study represents a promising structural scaffold to pursue for further SARS-CoV 3CLpro inhibitor development.",

            "text": "A highly infectious respiratory illness, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), emerged in Southern China and Hong Kong during late 2002. 1 It rapidly spread to over 25 other countries, infecting nearly 8000 people worldwide with a mortality rate of over 10%. 2 A novel human coronavirus (SARS-CoV) was identified as the causative agent of SARS. Although containment of the epidemic was successful through epidemiological and quarantine measures, the possibility of reemergence of the SARS-CoV or SARS-like diseases has been suggested based on the isolation of closely related strains from the horseshoe bat. 3, 4 Two new human coronaviruses named HKU1 5,6 and NL63 7, 8 have been identified since 2003, which turned out to be less lethal than SARS-CoV. However, a more recently identified human coronavirus, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), has infected 114 people since April 2012 with a nearly 50% mortality rate (54 deaths reported), and this number keeps rising daily. [9] [10] [11] Two Asian bat coronaviruses, BtCoV-HKU4 and BtCoV-HKU5, have been shown to be the closest to MERS-CoV. 12 This strongly suggests that there could be new SARS-like or new strains of SARS human coronaviruses that could cause another deadly outbreak in the future. There is still no effective therapy for SARS or other coronaviral infections. 13 The SARS coronavirus gene encodes two overlapping polyproteins-pp1a and pp1ab. 14 These polyproteins are processed by virally encoded peptidases to generate functional viral proteins. The SARS Chymotrypsin-like cysteine protease (3CL pro ) is the primary enzyme responsible for proteolysis, cleaving the initial polyprotein synthesized by the virion at eleven of its fourteen cleavage sites. Due to its crucial role in maturation of SARS-CoV, 3CL pro is an important target for anti-SARS drug design. 3CL pro functions as a dimer, 15 Abbreviations: SARS-CoV, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus; 3CL pro , 3 Chymotrypsin-like cysteine protease; MD, molecular dynamics; VS, virtual screening; CSM, computational solvent mapping; ROC, receiver operating characteristic; RMSD, root mean square deviation; HTS, high-throughput screening; FRET, fluorescence resonance energy transfer; SPR, surface plasmon resonance; K D , equilibrium dissociation constant; K i , inhibition constant; MLPCN, Molecular Libraries Probe Production Centers Network. a loop from the neighboring monomer. The N-terminus Ser1 of one monomer forms a hydrogen bond with Glu166 of the adjacent monomer in the S1 pocket. This interaction between the two monomers substantially stabilizes the protein, which then behaves as an active dimer where both monomers are found in the 'active form'. However, the majority of the drug discovery efforts against SARS-CoV 3CL pro reported to date have employed 'non-authentic' protein, i.e. one which has either an N-terminal GST tag or a C-terminal His-tag, in the crystal structures used in computational studies or in the constructs used in enzyme assays. Since the modified N-and C-termini can influence the functionality and activity of the SARS-CoV 3CL pro , [15] [16] [17] the inhibition data reported in literature should be interpreted with caution.",

Many peptidomimetic inhibitors of 3CL pro were initially developed, with these inhibitors including a 'warhead' moiety that formed a covalent interaction with the catalytic cysteine (Cys145) in 3CL pro . [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] After the development of the first generation of covalently interacting peptidomimetic inhibitors, researchers moved on to identifying non-peptidic small molecule inhibitors. [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] These were also largely warhead-based covalently bonding inhibitors, which could cause unwanted problems such as toxicity and off-target side effects, especially for other cysteine proteases. Thus there is a strong need to identify novel, noncovalent inhibitors with enhanced selectivity and potency against 3CL pro .",

The lack of a rigid, well-defined deep pocket of SARS-CoV 3CL pro makes small molecule inhibitor design difficult using in silico approaches. We thus developed a screening protocol using tiered docking and dynamic pharmacophore model filtering to screen the ZINC database (Fig. 1A ). Subsequently, we developed an experimental high-throughput screening assay to screen $40,000 diverse small molecules from four chemical libraries and optimized an orthogonal counter-screen binding assay to remove false positives (Fig. 1B) . Through the use of virtual and high-throughput screens we present several novel chemical scaffolds, which serve as excellent lead candidates for optimization of biological activity for potential anti-SARS drug design. The SARS-CoV 3CL pro binding pocket has been shown to be quite flexible in previous studies based on crystal structures solved at various pH values and in molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. 29 Our nanosecond-scale MD simulations of the authentic SARS-CoV 3CL pro dimer structure show that the four loops surrounding the active site region can sample alternative conformations ( Fig. 2A) . The plot in Figure 2B displays the average per-residue RMSD for the N-terminal monomer relative to the crystal structure. Significant conformational flexibility can be observed in the active site, particularly in loops L1, L2 and L4 that constitute the walls of the binding pocket. Such flexible loops are expected to play an important role in the correct positioning of amino acid residues during substrate binding and may adversely affect the virtual screening performance for a single rigid-receptor docking approach, as is often undertaken.",

The success of docking approaches relies on the overall classification accuracy of the scoring functions as well as their early enrichment, which is particularly important in high-throughput virtual screening. We examined the overall predictive power of scoring functions on the compounds in the validation dataset using rank order correlation between the computed docking scores and the experimentally reported IC 50 values, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) values (see Methods). The correlation coefficients and the AUC values for all the assessed scoring functions are listed in Figure 3A . We found that both Surflex-Dock and GOLD yielded poor prediction accuracy. Rescoring with Amber-DOCK improved the binding free energy estimation of the docked poses from GOLD, but reduced the classification accuracy of the Surflex-Dock poses. The initial slope of the ROC curve quantifies the early enrichment of the scoring function. We found that Amber-DOCK rescoring of GOLD binding poses and the GoldScore function show superior early enrichments (Fig. 3B) . These results show that Amber-DOCK rescoring of GOLD binding poses displays the best prediction accuracy in terms of early and overall enrichment for 3CL pro inhibitors. However, there remains an issue in using the Amber-DOCK rescoring method for screening large compound libraries, primarily because pose refinement employs energy minimization and molecular dynamics of the binding-site residues, making it computationally slow.",

A compound was not selected when 6 of its closest 30 neighbors were selected and those 6 neighbors were at least 85% similar.

The best accuracy and enrichment was obtained from the rank-sum approach by summing ranks from GoldScore, Surflex-Dock and Amber-DOCK rescoring of GOLD and Surflex-Dock conformations.

The S1 subsite includes His163 and Glu166 residues, which could potentially make hydrogen bonding interactions with inhibitors. The hydrophobic S2 subsite is lined with Met, Pro, Asp, His and Tyr residues. Methanol, acetate, and methylammonium probes were used to identify hydrogen bonding interactions; benzene probes were used for mapping of aromatic interactions, and ethane probes were used to distinguish hydrophobic interactions from aromatic. The method identified five hot spots (Fig. 4) , an aromatic feature interacting with the S1' subsite, two aromatic/hydrophobic features in the S1 and S2 subsites, an acceptor site near the catalytic cysteine, and a donor site interacting with residues His163 and His164 in the S1 subsite. The validity of the generated pharmacophore model was ascertained using two techniques. The water molecule was used as a probe and the positions of consensus clusters were compared with the crystallographic waters in the SARS-CoV 3CL pro active site. The method reproduced the binding sites of all the three binding pocket crystallographic waters. We also evaluated the performance of the generated pharmacophore model on the validation dataset. Although the non-inhibitors closely resembled the active compounds in chemical structure and molecular properties, the model differentiated well between the two classes.

It has been known that any affinity tags or extra amino acid residues at either the N-terminus or C-terminus decrease 3CL pro enzyme activity significantly via disturbing the formation of dimmers. 35, 36 Hence, we over-expressed and purified the authentic 3CL pro without any additions on either termini. Currently, Dabcyl-KTSAVLQSGFRKME-Edans, 37 is the only commercially available fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based substrate to monitor the 3CL pro enzyme activity. The fluorescence due to cleavage of the Edans/Dabcyl substrate can be monitored at excitation and emission wavelengths of 355 nm and 538 nm. In addition to this substrate, the long-wavelength fluorophore/ quencher pair Alexa Fluor/QSY has been developed for compound screening, which can be monitored at excitation/emission of 490 nm/535 nm or 595 nm/620 nm depending on the types of Alexa Fluor and QSY. 38 Typically, substrates with higher wavelength fluorescence signals work better for HTS because of less interference from intrinsically fluorescent compounds. For this reason, AlexaFluor/QSY would be a better substrate than Edans/Dabcyl. However, it was not used in this study primarily due to its much greater expense. Instead, we developed a new 3CL pro FRET substrate peptide labeled with fluorophore, 5-FAM and a quencher, QXL, for our studies. The FAM/QXL pair is a cost-effective alternative with a higher excitation/emission (492 nm/520 nm) wavelength than that of Edans/Dabcyl. The new 3CL pro substrate, 5-FAM-TSATLQSGFRK (QXL520)-NH 2 , has the same peptide cleavage sequence as the Edans/Dabcyl-containing substrate. We investigated our new FAM/QXL substrate by comparing its kinetic parameters with Edans/Dabcyl, which are summarized in Table 1 Before HTS was done, a thorough assay optimization was done to determine the optimal substrate and enzyme concentrations. In addition, the reducing agent effect, DMSO tolerance, and enzyme stability were also studied. In order to determine the correct substrate concentration for the HTS assay, the Michaelis constant (K M ) was determined in the presence and absence of reducing agents as described. 39 A series of DMSO concentrations ranging from 0% to 10% were tested for enzyme activity and substrate stability. Less than 10% inhibition of enzyme activity was observed with up to 10% of DMSO, and the substrate of 3CL pro showed sensitivity to DMSO starting at 10%. Therefore, a final DMSO concentration of less than 4% was used for all assays.",

IC 50 values for the active compounds were determined by dose-response curves. We were able to obtain IC 50 values for six compounds, all of which exhibited micromolar activities, with the most potent one (Compound 8) showing an IC 50 value slightly less than 1 lM (Fig. 5 ). Seven analogs of compound 8 were identified from ZINC v8.0 and were evaluated. However, none of the analogs were found to inhibit the enzyme by more than 50% at 100 lM concentration. Due to the presence of a catalytic cysteine in the 3CL pro active site, the hits from primary screening were evaluated in follow-up assays containing reduced glutathione (GSH) as the reducing agent 39 to eliminate any covalent binders and to maintain the protein in its active state. Out of the eight hits identified in the preliminary assays, four compounds (1, 2, 3 and 6) retained IC 50 values in the micromolar range (Fig. 5) , with the rest losing their inhibitory activity in the presence of GSH. The IC 50 values of these four hits ranged from 40.9 to 76.7 lM in the presence of GSH. None of the analogs of compound 8 were found to inhibit the enzymatic activity of SARS-CoV 3CL pro by more than 50% at 100 lM concentrations when GSH was present in the assay buffer.",

Of the four VS hits and the six HTS hits, the dissociation equilibration constants (K D ) of five compounds (1, 6, 9, 11, and 14) were successfully determined. The calculated K D values of the five hits ranged between 26.4 and 55.3 lM, indicating direct binding to the 3CL pro enzyme. Figure 6C shows the K D curve fit for one of the identified hits (14) . The remaining compounds either non-specifically bound to the enzyme or did not bind at all. Specifically, as shown in Figure 6D , compound 2 did not bind to 3CL pro , and four compounds (3, 10, 12, and 13) exhibited non-specific binding patterns (Fig. 6E) . Unfortunately the only drug hit, Alexidine dihydrochloride from the Prestwick FDA-approved drug library, also turned out to be a false positive based on SPR because it did not bind to the 3CL pro enzyme.

Our kinetic analysis was done with varying concentrations of substrate and enzyme-inhibitor complexes for each compound. The different models of enzyme inhibition (competitive, non-competitive, uncompetitive, and mixed-type) were fit to the kinetic data and were assessed using Michaelis-Menten, Lineweaver-Burke, and Dixon plots, using the SigmaPlot Enzyme kinetics Module. The best fit equations had the lowest Akaike Information Criterion corrections (AICc) value, 43 which should have a minimum of 2 AICc units difference from the next lowest to be significant. Compound 9 was determined to be a competitive inhibitor with respect to the substrate, with a K i value of 27.5 lM. Compound 14 showed a mixed-type inhibition with different affinities for free 3CL pro enzyme and the enzymesubstrate complex, with a K i value of 11.1 lM (Fig. 7) . Their determined K i values were similar to each of their IC 50 values (Table 3 ). Since compound 9 is a competitive inhibitor while 14 is a mixed-type inhibitor, 9 apparently binds to the active site of 3CL pro , while 14 apparently binds at a site distinct from the active site. We further studied the binding of compound 9 to SARS-CoV 3CL pro by molecular docking. The predicted binding pose and the key interactions are shown in Fig. S3 .

We have identified two compounds that exhibit IC 50 values in the low micromolar range. Unlike the majority of 3CL pro inhibitor leads reported to date, which either contain reactive warheads that may potentially engage in non-specific interactions with other cysteine-containing proteins, or which have not been tested for their inhibitory activities in the presence of reducing agents, the identified inhibitors act This study places particular emphasis on the quality of the results at each step of the screening pipeline and the rigorous experimental validation of the hits. The virtual screening protocol was designed for low computational complexity, improved enrichment, and its ability to accommodate protein flexibility into computational screening. The VS hits provided insights for choosing appropriate compound libraries for HTS instead of screening random compound libraries. The favorable binding positions of small probes in the CSM studies and the molecular docking studies of the VS hits suggest the preference of the S2 subsite for hydrophobic or aromatic groups and hydrogen bonding interactions with the residues in the S1 subsite. Accordingly, the libraries were selected which were enriched in aromatic groups and hydrogen bond donors and acceptors while exhibiting a molecular size distribution similar to that of the VS hits. The enzyme assays and the HTS screens employed the untagged construct of the 3CL pro enzyme and a new FRET substrate designed for high k cat /K M value and longer excitation/emission wavelength for minimal interference. The primary hits identified from VS and HTS were examined for binding in an independent SPR assay, followed by kinetic characterization of the mode of compound inhibition. The identified hits were further tested against a number of enzymes and were found to be selective for SARS-CoV proteases over other enzymes. Together, the results indicate the well-characterized hit compound 14 identified in this study to be sufficiently potent to provide a new scaffold for further development.",

The rank-sum and the voting techniques of consensus scoring were investigated to improve the enrichment compared to single scoring functions (see Supplementary data). The performance of docking programs was assessed on the validation dataset using two metrics: (1) rank-order correlation between the computed docking scores and the experimental IC 50 values, and (2) AUC. The ROC curve describes sensitivity or the true positive rate as a function of (1-specificity) or the false positive rate for varying values of thresholds for compound selection. The early enrichment was assessed from the plot by comparing true and false positive rates at the low thresholds. The AUC indicates the overall performance of the classifier compared to a random classification. An AUC value of 0.5 would correspond to a random classification and an AUC value of 1.0 would correspond to a perfect classification.",

[58] [59] [60] [61] [62] [63] Briefly, fifteen snapshots from the last 6 ns MD simulation of the bound form of the protein with the ligand removed were extracted based on their active site pocket heavy atom RMSD diversity compared to the original crystal structure. The RMSD for all frames was calculated using the ptraj module in Amber10 and the snapshots were clustered using the kclust program of the MMTools. 64 Five small organic molecule probes, benzene, propane, methanol, acetate, and methylammonium were moved on the surface of the protein active site using 10,000 operations of the Monte Carlo simulated annealing algorithm as implemented in Autodock v4.0. 100 docking trials for each probe type were carried out followed by the conformational clustering of the final docked poses. The best scoring molecule of each Autodock determined cluster for each probe type was retained as the parent molecule for that cluster. On aligning all parent molecules for a particular probe type, consensus clusters (containing at least 3 parent probes) were formed. The center point of each cluster was computed from the center averages of the parent molecules of each cluster. The radius of each cluster was computed from the average deviation of parent probe centers forming a cluster from the cluster center. The pharmacophore model was built using the Molecular Operating Environment (MOE) software package (v 2008.10, Chemical Computing Group, www.chemcomp.com) from the center points and the radius of each consensus cluster for each probe type. Residues Leu27, Met49, Phe150, Met165 and Glu166 were used to define the center points of the excluded volumes with a radius of 1.5 \u00c5 to define the boundaries of the pharmacophore search space. TIP3P water molecule probes were also docked using the same protocol to evaluate the reproduction of crystallographic water sites. The stringency of the pharmacophore model was examined by varying the required number of pharmacophore elements that must be matched by enabling partial match and varying the radii of elements. Rule-based torsion driving in OMEGA (Open-Eye Scientific Software) was used to produce multiple conformations of each molecule of the representative set, using an energy cut-off of 14 kcal/mol calculated with the MMFF force field and a heavy-atom RMSD criterion of 1 \u00c5. These pre-generated conformations were compared to the pharmacophore model.",
