Infection prevention and control (IP&C) interventions such as hand hygiene improvement, hiring IP&C personnel experienced in long-term care, prophylactic administration of oseltamivir, and staff and resident influenza vaccination have reduced outbreaks in adult long-term care. 1 However, pLTCFs present additional challenges due to the family-centered approach, on-site schools, age-related vulnerability to infections, high rate of device utilization, and behavioral factors that increase transmission (eg, uncontrolled secretions). 2 Outbreaks in pLTCFs lead not only to morbidity and acute care hospitalizations for infected children but also to school closures and service reductions that affect quality of life for all residents. 3 Thus, preventing ARIs and limiting outbreaks are uniquely important in these settings. In this study, we implemented several IP&C interventions aimed at reducing ARIs in a pLTCF, and we compared the incidence of ARIs and related outcomes before and after implementation. at a 137-bed pLTCF in New York that provides subacute, long-term, and rehabilitative services (bed occupancy, 97%-100%). The mean age of residents was 9.7 years (range, 2 months-21 years), and the average length of stay was 477 days (range, 1-7,315 days). Residents were being treated with mechanical ventilation (6%), tracheostomies (36%), and gastrostomy tubes (80%). Most residents had neurological deficits (>90%) including cerebral palsy, brain anomalies, and/or hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy. Most residents (83%) attended an on-site Department of Education school, and a few residents (4%) attended schools in the community. The staff-to-resident ratio was 4:1 and included 7 onsite clinicians. This study was approved by the appropriate institutional review boards.",

Of 549 ARIs, 58% were single infections unassociated with outbreaks. ARI-related transfers to acute care occurred 219 times; 39 of these resulted in hospitalizations. Laboratory testing was performed for 475 ARIs (50%). Tests included direct fluorescent antibody (n = 176), viral culture (n = 159), and/or reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (n = 111). Test type was unknown for 201 samples (42%). Viral pathogens were identified for 267 ARIs (56%) and included parainfluenza (n = 75; 28%), rhinovirus/enterovirus (n = 56; 21%), influenza (n = 47; 16%), human metapneumovirus (n = 40; 15%), respiratory syncytial virus (n = 34; 13%), coronavirus (n = 7; 3%), and 2 cases (1%) had \u22651 virus. One resident died due to adenovirus. Table 2 describes differences in ARI outcomes before and after implementation of the new policies. While the rates of total ARI and outbreaks increased (P < .01 and P = .20, respectively), the proportion of infections associated with outbreaks and the average number of cases per outbreak decreased (P < .01 and P = .17, respectively). Staff vaccination increased from an average of 65% during 2009-2013 (range, 44%-77%) to an average of 97% during 2013-2015 (range, 96%-98%), and incidence of influenza in residents decreased significantly.",

We suspect that the observed increase may be due to greater case detection from improved surveillance and testing. Another contributing factor may be the doubling of mechanical ventilation beds after facility expansion, which elevated the average severity of illness among residents. We detected higher rates of ARI versus adult long-term care, 3.0 versus 1.2 ARIs per 1,000 resident days, respectively. 7 This result is not surprising considering the immunologic immaturity and behavioral characteristics of pediatric patients. Pathogens identified in our facility are similar to those reported by other pLTCFs, including influenza and adenovirus. 8, 9 Although ARIs increased overall, the rate of single infections unassociated with outbreaks increased and outbreak size decreased, suggesting that IP&C initiatives successfully curtailed the spread of ARIs. Because complete ARI prevention is likely infeasible, focusing on limiting transmission may have a strong impact on reducing resident morbidity, mortality, and facility-wide disruption of services due to isolation. Influenza rates also decreased significantly, likely due to high compliance with the staff vaccination policy. The respiratory illness algorithm was intended to reduce acute care transfers by providing information to help manage residents within the facility. However, no change was observed, possibly because 44% of the assays performed did not detect viral pathogens.",

Furthermore, consistent ARI documentation in this population is challenging due to the lack of pLTCFspecific case definitions. 10 High nursing turnover during facility expansion and turnover in the IP&C coordinator role may also have confounded our results. Nevertheless, our findings support the use of mandatory staff influenza vaccination and suggest that factors such as increased space between residents and heightened ARI symptom monitoring among staff may limit transmission within the facility once a case occurs.
