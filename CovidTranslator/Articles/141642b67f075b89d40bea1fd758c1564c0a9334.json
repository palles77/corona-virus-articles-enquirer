Rotaviruses and, in some cases, adenoviruses are found on electron microscopy of faeces of a substantial proportion of children with acute diarrhoea in various parts of the world and there is evidence that these organisms can cause the disease (BISHOP et al., 1974; BRYDEN et al., 1975; MIDDLETON et al., 1974; SEXTON et al., 1974; FLEWETT et al., 1975; SCHOUB et al., 1975) . Particles resembling coronaviruses (CALJL et al., 1975; MATHAN et al., 1975) and small isometric particles (APPLETON & HIGGINS, 1975; ~JADELEY & COSGROVE, 1975 ,1976 have also been seen although it is not clear whether they are pathogenic Viruses which are detected by inoculation of tissue cultures, such as enterovimses and adenoviruses, are only occasionally cultured from patients with diarrhoea in Britain, but are common in children with and without diarrhoea in developing countries; in some studies there has been evidence that these viruses may be associated with diarrhoea (e.g. Yow et al., 1966; RAMOS-ALVAREZ & OLARTE, 1964 , and see CRAMBLETT & SIEWERS 1965) but they are not generally thought to explain diarrhoea of children in the tropics.",

Rotaviruses were found mainly in the early months of the year and altogether represented about half the viruses detected and one in eight of the patients studied.

The technique used, namely immunoelectron microscopy, is known to be more sensitive than that used for Harrow specimens, and in almost all the specimens it was clear that the patient's serum contained antibody against the isometric particles seen, but not against the corona-virus-like particles. Further there was no evidence that any virus was associated with the presence of diarrhoea. In most specimens only one pathogen was detected by one technique but in 6 cases two viruses were found -adeno + (4 rota, 1 calici, 1 corona)s and in one adeno + influenza + rota. \"Three of 4 viruses found in patients aged 2-15 were from children under 5. tSmal1 isometric particles (see Table 2 ). *These specimens matched those collected earlier or later when the patient had clinical recognized diarrhoea. @BE 150 specimens collected 9 were excluded because a Shigella or Salmonella was isolated and 16 because a pathogenic serotype of E. coli was isolated-5 of the latter from patients without diarrhoea.
