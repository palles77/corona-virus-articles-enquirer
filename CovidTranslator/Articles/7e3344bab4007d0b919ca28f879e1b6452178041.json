The aim of this work was to study the etiology of the respiratory infection in order to assess the usefulness of the clinical and analytical parameters used for COPD identification. Patients and methods: We included 132 patients over a period of 2 years. The etiology of the respiratory infection was studied by conventional sputum, paired serology tests for atypical bacteria, and viral diagnostic techniques (immunochromatography, immunofluorescence, cell culture, and molecular biology techniques). We grouped the patients into four groups based on the pathogens isolated (bacterial versus. viral, known etiology versus unknown etiology) and compared the groups. Results: A pathogen was identified in 48 patients. The pathogen was identified through sputum culture in 34 patients, seroconversion in three patients, and a positive result from viral techniques in 14 patients. No significant differences in identifying etiology were observed in the clinical and analytical parameters within the different groups. The most cost-effective tests were the sputum test and the polymerase chain reaction. Conclusion: Based on our experience, clinical and analytical parameters are not useful for the etiological identification of COPD exacerbations. Diagnosing COPD exacerbation is difficult, with the conventional sputum test for bacterial etiology and molecular biology techniques for viral etiology providing the most profitability. Further studies are necessary to identify respiratory syndromes or analytical parameters that can be used to identify the etiology of new AE-COPD cases without the laborious diagnostic techniques.",

Half of the AE-COPD cases are attributed to respiratory infections (50%), but exacerbations are also associated with pollution, temperature changes, allergens (30%), and other comorbidities (26%) such as heart failure and pulmonary thromboembolism. 4 In several studies, the presence of bacteria in AE-COPD has been associated with purulence of the sputum and the presence of inflammatory markers. 5, 6 In recent years, emerging new diagnostic techniques have revealed a relationship with respiratory viruses. [7] [8] [9] [10] In addition, the etiology of respiratory infections in AE-COPD patients differs according to the geographic area. 11 Currently, AE-COPD patients are treated with antibiotics as the first line of defense, depending on the severity of the COPD and the severity of the exacerbation itself. 12 With the emergence of multidrug resistance and increased economic spending on antibiotic therapy, numerous studies have assessed the benefit of antibiotic treatment, 13, 14 recommending a short course of antibiotic treatment for slight exacerbations. 15 Similarly, biological markers such as procalcitonin have been proposed as markers for antibiotic administration in the AE-COPD, 16 allowing a reduction in antibiotic prescriptions.",

The most frequent cause of COPD exacerbation is considered to be viral or bacterial bronchial infection. 25 This fact is based on the regular presence of purulent coughing and bacterial isolation from the cough of more than half of the patients with exacerbations. 26 In addition, up to 30% of patients with stable COPD had evidence of bronchial bacterial colonization in the absence of AE-EPOC. 6 However, authors such as Sethi et al have demonstrated that pathogen colonization is not responsible for the exacerbation, as for Haemophilus, where infection with an additional bacterial strain is necessary to elicit an exacerbation. 27 The identification of a bacterial etiology for AE-COPD is primarily obtained through the study of sputum. We obtained sputum in 65% of patients, which shows the difficulty of obtaining it in clinical practice. A mixed respiratory flora was obtained in 37% of these patients and was diagnostic in 24.2%, with the samples exhibiting a predominance of H. influenzae and P. aeruginosa. It is important to note that our patients had severe COPD exacerbations that caused respiratory failure and required hospital admission. H. influenzae and P. aeruginosa were detected mainly in the patients with severe COPD, which could explain the inability to isolate bacteria such as Pneumococcus and viruses, as severe COPD benefits the enterobacteria and P. aeruginosa.",
