Blood samples were taken from all captured sheep until 1993 and stored in preservative at 220 8C. Sampling resumed in 1997, when hair samples were taken from all captured sheep by plucking 50-100 hairs including roots from the back or flank. Hairs were kept either in paper envelopes or plastic bags containing about 5 g of silica at room temperature. From 1998 to 2002, a tissue sample from each captured sheep was taken from the ear with an 8-mm punch. Ear tissue was kept at 220 8C in a solution of 20% dimethylsulphoxide saturated with NaCl. We sampled 433 marked individuals over the course of the study.",

It is unclear when, where and how novel pathogens such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), monkeypox and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) will cross the barriers that separate their natural reservoirs from human populations and ignite the epidemic spread of novel infectious diseases. New pathogens are believed to emerge from animal reservoirs when ecological changes increase the pathogen's opportunities to enter the human population 1 and to generate subsequent human-tohuman transmission 2 . Effective human-to-human transmission requires that the pathogen's basic reproductive number, R 0 , should exceed one, where R 0 is the average number of secondary infections arising from one infected individual in a completely susceptible population 3 . However, an increase in R 0 , even when insufficient to generate an epidemic, nonetheless increases the number of subsequently infected individuals. Here we show that, letters to nature as a consequence of this, the probability of pathogen evolution to R 0 > 1 and subsequent disease emergence can increase markedly.",

In contrast, evolutionary factors including the adaptation of the pathogen to growth within humans and the subsequent transmission of the pathogen between humans are mostly considered in terms of changes in the virulence of the pathogen, and are often thought to have a lesser role in the initial emergence of pathogens 4 .

Each introduction thus forms branched chains of transmission, which stutter to extinction if R 0 , 1, and the pathogen cannot evolve (m \u00bc 0). The probability that the pathogen evolves and a secondary infection is caused by the mutant is equal to m for each of the secondary infections (we note that m incorporates not only the pathogen's mutation rate, but also its dynamics within the host and its transmissibility).

In the conventional view the R 0 of these infections must be greater than one, whereas in the mechanism described here it is less than one, and evolution during the stochastic chains of transmission allows R 0 to increase above one. In the case of human infections such as HIV 1,11,12 , SARS [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] and (potentially) monkeypox [18] [19] [20] [21] , seroprevalence studies among groups at high risk of infection from the reservoir would allow evaluation of whether crossover events are usually dead ends, as we expect in our model, or whether they are associated with a large number of secondary cases. In the case of diseases emerging into non-human populations, such as the Nipah virus, which moved from bats to pigs [22] [23] [24] , it may be possible to conduct additional tests involving controlled experimental infections to estimate the R 0 (in this case of the bat Nipah virus in pigs) and to determine whether it evolves during the course of chains of transmission. Such studies may additionally help to identify pathogens that have an ability to evolve rapidly and thus have a high potential for emergence. The framework presented here has special relevance for pathogens that have been driven to extinction by vaccination. In the case of smallpox there are probably reservoirs of related zoonoses (such as, but not restricted to, monkeypox) from which smallpox may have originated. Although the R 0 of monkeypox in the human population is clearly less than one, there are occasional chains of transmission in the human population [18] [19] [20] [21] . As the level of herd immunity to smallpox wanes in the absence of continued vaccination, we expect an increase in R 0 of infections with monkeypox albeit to a level still less than one (the smallpox vaccine provides about 85% cross immunity against monkeypox). Our results suggest that this increase in the effective R 0 of monkeypox in the human population could markedly increase the probability of evolution of monkeypox, allowing it to emerge into a successful human pathogen (which, depending on the evolutionary trajectory followed, may be similar to or differ from smallpox).",

These indicators were derived using data (46,777 samples) collected by the Continuous Plankton Recorder (CPR) survey 10 . We first examined long-term monthly changes (period 1958-1999) in the plankton ecosystem of the North Sea (including the Skagerrak), applying a standardized Principal Component Analysis (PCA, table years-months \u00a3 indicators). The first principal component (Fig. 1, 33 .71% of the total variability) revealed a clear distinction between the periods 1963-1983 and both of the periods 1984-1999 and 1958-1962 . The period 1963-1983 was characterized by high abundance of prey for larval cod (positive anomalies in the biomass of calanoid copepods, in the abundance of C. finmarchicus, euphausiids and Pseudocalanus spp.) and a high mean size of calanoid copepods. In twelve of the 21 years from 1963 to 1983 cod recruitment (one-year-olds) in the North Sea was high, in parallel with positive anomalies in the plankton ecosystem (Fig. 1) . Estimated recruitment during this period was ",

            "text": "Long-term monthly changes in the plankton index (as the first principal component, 33.78% of the total variability), resulting from analysis of the table years-months \u00a3 biological indicators. The main variables related to this first principal component were, in order of importance, mean abundance (as mean number of individuals per CPR sample) of C. finmarchicus (normalized first eigenvector C m \u00bc 0.84), euphausiids (C m \u00bc 0.72), mean size of calanoid copepod (C m \u00bc 0.72), C. helgolandicus (C m \u00bc 20.41), calanoid copepod biomass (C m \u00bc 0.34) and the genus Pseudo-calanus spp. (C m \u00bc 0.07). A negative anomaly in the first principal component indicates a low value for all biological parameters with the exception of C. helgolandicus (opposite pattern) and Pseudocalanus spp. (no relationship). Cod recruitment (one-year-olds; in decimal logarithm) in the North Sea (curve in black) is superimposed with a lag of one year. The period of the 'gadoid outburst' 11 is indicated. Horizontal dashed lines indicate the period (March-September) of larval cod occurrence in the North Sea.",
