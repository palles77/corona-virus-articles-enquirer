Recently, a third category has been added: healthcare-associated pneumonia (HCAP) ( Table 2) . This category was needed to designate patients with pneumonia developing outside the hospital but whose pathogenesis, causative agents, and antibiotic resistance patterns were more consistent with nosocomial pathogens. The majority of these patients are from nursing homes but the group also includes chronic dialysis patients or others with frequent or recent contact with the medical system. Within each of these categories, patients with compromised immunity are usually discussed separately, since the spectrum of causative etiologies is much larger and therefore the diagnostic and therapeutic approaches differ from that of patients with overtly normal host immunity.

            "text": "The key to the development and pattern of pneumonia is the alveolar macrophage. The overwhelming majority of microorganisms that reach the alveolar level are killed and/or cleared by the alveolar macrophage without inducing an inflammatory response. Simply to get to the alveolar level means that the microorganism has avoided all the mechanical and other host defense mechanisms of the upper respiratory tract and the conducting airways. These include the branching airway pattern and the mucociliary clearance mechanisms, mucosal immunoglobulins, complement, surfactant, lactoferrin, defensins, and other antimicrobial peptides. Given the microbial and particle challenge presented to the respiratory tract on a daily basis, these mechanisms are highly efficient at preventing an overwhelming challenge to the alveolar macrophage. However, either because of the virulence or the volume of microorganisms that it is exposed to, the alveolar macrophage can be overwhelmed. The response is release of a variety of mediators that elicit an inflammatory response appropriate for the particular challenge. The inflammatory response, rather than shear numbers of microorganisms, is responsible for the radiographic changes of pneumonia while the mediators released as part of the inflammatory response result in many of the clinical manifestations, such as fever and leukocytosis. Microorganisms can reach the alveolar level through two major mechanisms: aerosol deposition and aspiration of an infected bolus. The former is the mechanism for most viral, mycobacterial, and fungal infections while many of the bacterial pneumonias are a result of aspiration. Aspiration pleuropneumonia is a specific variant of aspiration pneumonia that is characteristically polymicrobial with prominent involvement of anaerobic bacteria. In this disorder, a large volume aspiration episode, usually from a seizure or alcoholic stupor, occurs days to weeks before presentation with the signs and symptoms of pneumonia. The aspirated bolus is usually enriched with anaerobic microorganisms by the presence of severe gingivitis, which explains the fact that this syndrome is very rare in the edentulous. The presence of anaerobes often results in a lung abscess and corresponding severe pleural reaction.",

In the elderly and those with an inadequate immune response, pneumonia may present with nonrespiratory symptoms such as delirium, fatigue, failure to thrive, worsening of an underlying chronic illness, or a fall. In elderly patients, fever may be absent but tachypnea is usually present, along with an abnormal physical examination of the chest. Unfortunately, none of these symptoms is unique to pneumonia.

However, for optimal antimicrobial management an etiologic diagnosis is also needed. Demonstrating the presence of a microorganism in culture or in stains of pathologic specimens are the classic methods to demonstrate the causative agent. Once again these methods are woefully inadequate for diagnosing pneumonia. The reason varies depending on the type of pneumonia. In communityacquired pneumonia (CAP), many of the causative microorganisms are not easily grown in culture and even with the most aggressive culture and extensive use of other diagnostic modalities, the etiologic diagnosis remains unknown in the majority of cases. In contrast, for nosocomial pneumonia, especially VAP, the high incidence of colonization frequently results in many false-positive cultures and polymicrobial cultures in monomicrobial pneumonias. For some of the chronic pneumonias such as tuberculosis and endemic fungal disease, the slow growth characteristics delay a definitive microbiologic diagnosis for weeks.

An example of the former is human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) disease. When helper T-lymphocyte counts (cluster determinant or CD4) are 4500 cells/mm 3 , usual CAP pathogens and tuberculosis are common causes of pneumonia. Once the CD4 count falls below 200 cells/mm 3 , opportunistic infections including Pneumocystis jerovecii and CMV become more common. Exposure to broad-spectrum antibiotics is enough to shift the spectrum of HCAP toward that of nosocomial pneumonias.",

            "text": "While new or previously unrecognized pathogens can play a role in management decisions, the major issue in pneumonia is the appearance of antibiotic resistant strains of known common bacterial pathogens. The emergence of antibiotic-resistant isolates has truly reached epidemic proportions for CAP and VAP. Multidrug-resistant pathogens are the norm for VAP. The emergence of drug-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae (DRSP) is an increasingly common problem worldwide, with more than 40% of all pneumococci in some areas falling into this category by current definitions. Controversy exists, however, about the clinical relevance of in vitro resistance in the absence of meningitis, and whether new therapeutic approaches are required and whether resistance influences the outcome of CAP. When resistance to penicillin is present, there is often in vitro resistance to other agents. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcal aureus, previously thought to be exclusively a HAP pathogen, is now making an appearance as a cause of CAP. The common denominator in development of antibiotic resistance is antibiotic over usage. Unfortunately, development of new antimicrobials is slowing and so far has only been successful in fighting a rearguard action against the advance of antibiotic resistance. Some benefit accrues from shortening the course of appropriate antibiotic use, such as for suspected VAP or with surgical prophylaxis. However, avoiding even starting antibiotics for nonbacterial infections, such as outpatient viral URIs, is the strategy most likely to slow this trend.",

            "text": "Given the resistance issues with antibiotics and lack of effective treatment for some types of pneumonia, immunomodulatory treatment is an increasingly important consideration for treatment of pneumonia. Immune modulation can take three pathways. One is the development and use of less immunosuppressive treatments for malignancies and transplant patients. Important advances in this area have already resulted in renal transplant patients returning to a near normal response to bacterial pneumonia and infrequent occurrence of opportunistic pathogens causing pneumonia. The second route is immunization. Childhood immunization has a long track record of effectively preventing respiratory infections with pertussis and diphtheria. The only infections seen with these pathogens in developed societies are when vaccination has not been provided. Recently, the use of the Haemophilus influenzae and protein conjugate pneumococcal vaccines have nearly eliminated meningitis from these bacteria and significantly reduced the incidence of respiratory tract infections. Not only has the conjugate pneumococcal vaccine decreased infection in children but it has also resulted in a decrease in invasive infections in the child's adult caregivers. Even the polysaccharide pneumococcal vaccine appears to decrease the rate of invasive disease, even if it does not decrease overall pneumonia rates. The third immunomodulatory strategy is specific immunomodulation for established infection. The use of the colony-stimulating factors filgrastim and sargramostim for neutropenic patients is one example. The recent release of drotrecogin alfa activated (activated protein C) for severe sepsis offers some hope to improve the mortality of bacterial CAP, especially pneumococcal CAP.",

It includes medical practioners, nurses, scientists, and any professional with an interest in respiratory disease. Abstract 'Atypical pneumonia' refers to a clinical syndrome associated with pneumonia (typically mild, nonlobar) and diverse upper respiratory tract and extrapulmonary manifestations. Clinical features overlap with bacterial pneumonia, and co-infection with both typical (e.g., Streptococcus pneumoniae or other bacteria) and atypical pathogens may occur. 'Atypical' pathogens include Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia pneumoniae, and Legionella spp. In large epidemiological studies, Mycoplasma pneumoniae has been implicated in 2-18% of community-acquired pneumonias; Chlamydia pneumoniae, in 2-8%; Legionella sp., 1-4%. Atypical pathogens lack cell walls and are resistant to b-lactam antibiotics but are usually susceptible to tetracyclines, macrolides, ketolides, and fluoroquinolone antibiotics. In this article, we also review other unusual causes of pneumonia which are transmitted by insects or vectors (e.g., Rocky Mountain spotted fever, cat scratch fever, Q fever, ehrlichiosis, Lyme disease, and tularemia). These diverse organisms are not found on Gram stain, and diagnosis requires special culture techniques or serological assays. We review the salient clinical and laboratory features of these various disorders, and discuss diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.",

            "text": "In 1938, Hobart Reimann described a group of patients with an initial mild respiratory illness, often accompanied by headache and sore throat, progressing to pneumonia without sputum production. Because this was a picture very different from the well-known presentation of acute pneumococcal pneumonia, Reimann coined the term 'atypical pneumonia' to describe these cases. His observation was confirmed by subsequent similar reports and it was noted that the etiologic agents for these illnesses were unidentifiable on Gram stain and not recovered by culture methods used at the time. The evolution of diagnostic techniques eventually led to the identification of many of the causative pathogens of atypical pneumonia, including the most significant ones, Mycoplasma, Chlamydia, and Legionella. Clinical features of atypical and typical community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) overlap, and the etiology of CAP cannot be determined on demographic, clinical, or radiologic features. However, the term 'atypical pneumonia' remains a useful one and describes a clinical picture characterized by more pronounced systemic than respiratory symptoms, bilateral patchy or interstitial infiltrates on chest radiographs, and negative results on sputum Gram stain and routine cultures.Atypical pathogens are being isolated with increasing frequency in CAP and may occur as coinfecting organisms with typical bacterial pathogens. Recent expert consensus statements recommend that empirical therapy for CAP should include coverage for atypical pathogens. In this article, we discuss many of the important microbes that cause atypical pneumonia, including epidemiology, clinical presentation, and therapy (see Table 1 ). Additional pathogens that can induce an 'atypical pneumonia' picture include viruses (e.g., influenza, adenovirus,",
