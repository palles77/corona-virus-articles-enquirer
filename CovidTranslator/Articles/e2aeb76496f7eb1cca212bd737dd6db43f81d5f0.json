The assay coverage was 97.9% (184/188) for PCV3 and 99.1% (1889/1907) for PCV2 sequences that were available from the current GenBank database. The PCR amplification efficiencies were 98-99% for plasmids, and 92-96% for diagnostic samples, with correlation coefficients all greater than 0.99. The limit of detection (LOD) determined as plasmid copies per reaction was 17 for PCV3 and 14 for PCV2. The assay specifically detected the targeted viruses without cross reacting to each other or to other common porcine viruses. Among 336 swine clinical samples collected in 2018, 101 (30.1%) were PCV3 positive, 56 (16.7%) were PCV2 positive and 18 (5.4%) were co-positives. Sixty selected PCV3 positives were confirmed by Sanger sequencing, and 53 of the 56 PCV2 positive samples were tested positive by another validated PCR assay.",

The Rep protein is a non-structural protein and functions for the viral replication, while the structural Cap protein dominates immunogenicity (Cheung, 2003; Mankertz et al., 1998a, b; Nawagitgul et al., 2002) .

            "text": "PCVAD is a common disease in swine production systems and has Y. Wang, et al. Journal of Virological Methods 269 (2019) 7-12 caused significant economic losses. PCV2 is a major pathogen involved in PCVAD (Segales et al., 2008) . A new porcine circovirus, PCV3, was identified in 2015 and is causing PCVAD-like clinical signs, including PDNS and reproductive failure, and cardiac and multi-organ inflammation, and thus has attracted researchers' and producers' attention (Chen et al., 2017; Palinski et al., 2017; Phan et al., 2017; Stadejek et al., 2017) . Considering the similar clinical symptoms caused by PCV2 and PCV3, and that PCV2 assays built many years ago are no longer covering the majority of field strains, there was a need to develop a mqPCR assay that was based on the most current sequencing data and capable of detecting the two viruses with high diagnostic coverage to field strains. Although several molecular detection methods were developed for rapid detection of PCV3 and PCV2 (Kim et al., 2017; Li et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2018) , our mqPCR assay showed apparent advantages. With the help of bioinformatics tools, 1907 PCV2 full genome sequences that were currently available in the GenBank were downloaded and analyzed to achieve high coverage in the assay design stage. We believe that the coverage of the primers and probes over available sequences in the designing stage is the best estimation of assay's future diagnostic sensitivity against field strains (Bai et al., 2018) . Compared to the three published duplex assays, our assay has much higher coverages: 97.9% (184/188) for PCV3 and 99.1% (1889/1907) for PCV2. All 4 PCV3 strains that our primers or probes mismatch to are all single nucleotide variations, and very often these oligoes that have single nucleotide mismatches will not affect their ability of binding to the templates. Therefore, the actual diagnostic sensitivity for PCV3 can be higher than this estimation. Using two non-overlapping targets for a given virus may not increase the assay's analytical sensitivity, but it will increase field strain coverage, and will help to detect strains with additional mutations, as the chance for a strain to have mutations on both target sites is small. Also, compared to the LOD of 50 copies per reaction in Kim et al. (2017) and 90 copies per reaction in Zhang et al. (2018) , our assay appeared to be more sensitive: 17 copies per reaction of PCV3 and 14 copies per reaction of PCV2. The LOD of PCV2 was also evaluated with cell culture, with an LOD of around 1.4 TCID50 per reaction. In addition, the internal control, swine SB2M gene, is included in our assay to monitor nucleic acid extraction efficiencies and potential PCR inhibitions in order to reduce the false-negative rate, which were not used in the previous studies.",

The viral targets were detected from porcine serum, oral fluid, feces, intestines and tonsil, indicating that our assay can be used for a wide range of sample types that are encountered in routine diagnostic operations. It is interesting to see, with our limited data, that the PCV3 positive rate was 30.1%, which was much higher than the PCV2 positive rate of 16.7%. We currently do not have the data to indicate whether the application of PCV2 vaccines in recent years play a role in reducing PCV2 prevalence. We will keep monitoring the field samples to see if this prevalence data holds true in the future.",
