On the basis of three-dimensional structures, and some less direct evidence, most of these families can be grouped together into about six clans that may well have common ancestors. The structures that are known for members of four of the clans, chymotrypsin, subtilisin, carboxypeptidase C, and Escherichia D-AIa-D-AIa peptidase A, show them to be totally unrelated, however.

Thus, the peptidases of the chymotrypsin, subtilisin, and carboxypeptidase C clans have in common a \"catalytic triad\" of the three amino acids: serine (nucleophile), aspartate (electrophile), and histidine (base). The geometric orientations of these are closely similar between families, despite the fact that otherwise the protein folds are quite different. This striking example of convergent evolution has led researchers to look for the same catalytic residues in other serine peptidases. However, the catalytic mechanisms of clans SE* (Escherichia D-Ala-D-Ala peptidase A) and SF (repressor LexA) are already known to be very different, and there is little doubt that some of the other [13] in Volume 248 of this series. All of the peptidases known to be encoded by viruses are endopeptidases, and it will be noted that there is no metallopeptidase among them.",

The members of this family are inherently secreted proteins. Each is synthesized with a signal peptide that targets it to the secretory pathway. The animal enzymes may be secreted directly (e.g., proenzymes of coagulation factors in the liver parenchymal cell), or packaged in vesicles for regulated secretion (e.g., chymotrypsinogen in the pancreas), or they may be retained in leukocyte granules (e.g., elastase, chymase, or granzymes in polymorphonuclear leukocytes, mast cells, or cytotoxic lymphocytes, respectively). Proteolytic activation of the proenzymes occurs extracellularly, or sometimes in storage organelles. Functions are occasionally intracellular, as in intracellular digestion of bacteria by neutrophils, but most commonly extracellular. Examples of extracellular functions are digestion of food proteins in the intestine by the enzymes from the pancreas, and coagulation, fibrinolysis, and complement activation by the enzyme systems in the plasma.",

However, many members of the family are mosaic proteins in which the molecule is extended N-terminally by addition of unrelated peptide segments (Fig. 3) . The catalytic unit almost invariably forms the C-terminal domain: only acrosin and complement The propeptide maintaining the proenzyme in its inactive state can be as small as two amino acid residues, as in cathepsin G 5 and granzyme B (see [5]), but many are much longer. Not uncommonly, these are disulfide bonded to the catalytic domain, so that they remain part of the active enzyme. These N-terminal extensions often contain one or more copies of several domains with different structures (Table IV) . Domains such as \"kringles\" and \"apples\" are confined to this family of proteins, but others, such as \"sushi\" and epidermal growth factor-like domains, are widely distributed among protein families. One domain is found not only in the chymotrypsin family (complement subcomponents Clr and Cls) but also in the astacin family of metallopeptidases.6 The process by which so much \"exon shuffling\" has occurred in this family has been suggested to depend heavily on a conserved phase 1 intron N-terminal to the peptidase domain. 7 A surprising feature of the genes for peptidases of the chymotrypsin family is the diversity of codons used for the active site serine residue.

A domain C-terminal to the potential active site residues of lysyl endopeptidase (residues 474-653) is homologous to a segment of Vibrio collagenase (family M9), which establishes the mosaic nature of both proteins. Both this domain and a long N-terminal peptide are removed during proteolytic activation of lysyl endopeptidase. 23 IgA-specific Serine Endopeptidase Family ($6) Family $6 contains similar enzymes from two gram-negative, pathogenic bacteria, Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Haemophilus influenzae. Both peptidases cleave the heavy chains of immunoglobulin A at certain prolyl bonds in the hinge region (see [10]). Unrelated metalloendopeptidases from organisms including Streptococcus sanguis also exhibit similar specificity. 24",
