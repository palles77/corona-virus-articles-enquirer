The interface between these two components forms the 157 tRNA binding sites of the small subunit. The head of the 40S subunit is 158 a dynamic component, modifying its relative orientation respect the body. 159 This dynamic is of critical importance in two aspects of translation: the po- The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/606236 doi: bioRxiv preprint sition respects the 40S body ( Fig. 3A and B) .

Notably, the SL-III/ASL-like unit of IAPV-IRES populates 204 a space more similar to a hybrid A/P-tRNA than a canonical, A/A-tRNA 205 or A/T-tRNA (following nomenclature of hybrid states previously proposed 206 ([45]). Similarly, PKIII overlaps with the position occupied by a hybrid P/E-207 tRNA, mimicking its helical components the elbow region of a tRNA in this 208 intermediate configuration. Overall, the IAPV-IRES is able to manipulate 209 the 40S subunit in isolation, blocking the functional sites where key canonical 210 initiation factors bind, and at the same time, steering the intrinsic dynamics 211 of the 40S head towards a configuration reminiscent of an early elongation,",

In many structures is not visible due to its intrinsic 230 flexibility, required to perform its role escorting in-transit tRNAs [46, 47]. 231 The SL-III of IAPV-IRES contacts the A site finger, stabilizing it in a fixed 232 conformation, which allows the apical loop of SL-III to reach deep into the 233 60S, establishing a novel interaction with the ribosomal protein uL16 (Fig. 234 4B and C). The IAPV-IRES positions the apical loop of SL-III (nucleotides 235 6585 to 6590) in direct contact with basic residues of uL16, which are in 236 electrostatic interacting distance with negatively charged phosphates of the 237 RNA backbone of the IRES (Fig. 4C).

The re-267 cruitment of elongation factors to commit the ribosome to the production of 268 viral proteins seems to be achieved not through a dynamic manipulation of 269 the 40S rotation, but by directly adopting a configuration reminiscent of a 270 ribosome with tRNAs in hybrid configurations. 271 Remodeling of specific components of the IAPV-IRES 272 allows its translocation through the ribosome. 273 Due to their intrinsic flexibility, IRESs are able to populate multiple con-274 formational states, while maintaining a basic structural framework dictated 275 by their base pairing scheme. A combination of rigid elements connected 276 via flexible linkers allow these RNAs to tune their interactions with differ-277 ent ribosomal sites as they transit from an early pre-translocated state to 278 a post-translocated one. Along this vectorial movement, these IRESs take 279 advantage of intrinsic dynamic elements of the ribosome, normally involved 280 in translocation of tRNAs and mRNAs [53, 23]. 281 In order to visualize the IAPV-IRES in a post-translocated state, we engi-282 neered a stop codon in the first coding codon following the IRES sequence 283 [26, 54].

An example of such intricate scenario is the current collapse of bee 347 hives worldwide, a syndrome termed Colony Collapse Disorder or CCD. Even 348 thought the exact cause of CCD could be multi-faceted and complex, there is 349 unambiguous evidence that a related group of bee-infecting RNA viruses of 350 the Dicistrovirideae family exert a deleterious effect [1, 2, 8]. Viruses of this 351 family make use of a RNA-only mechanism to take control of host ribosomes 352 in order to gain access to the cellular machinery for protein production [31]. 353 Using cryo-EM, we comprehensively characterized how the intergenic IRES 354 of IAPV, a putative agent causing CCD, binds and manipulate ribosomes to 355 redirect them toward the production of viral proteins. The IAPV-IRES is 356 able to establish a stable binary interaction with the small ribosomal sub-357 unit. An early capturing of free 40S subunits, committing them toward viral 358 protein production, may represent a limiting step in a cellular environment 359 where competition between cellular and viral messengers content for riboso-360 mal access. The IAPV-IRES is able to insert its PKI domain in the A site 361 (decoding site) of the 40S effectively blocking the binding of eIF1/eIF1A, two 362 initiation factors required for canonical initiation (Fig. 2C). While blocking 363 the 40S functional sites, the IAPV-IRES is able to steerer the intrinsic dy-364 namic of the 40S subunit towards a specific configuration, facilitating the 365 recruitment of the large ribosomal subunit (60S) in the absence of eIF5B, 366 the cellular factor catalyzing this event (Fig. 4A). 367 Bypassing the highly regulated initiation stage of translation is a custom-368 ary requirement for the type IV family of IRES [18]. This is accomplished 369 by inducing an altered ribosome stage, able to recruit directly and without 370 tRNAs, elongation factors (eEF2 and eEF1A).
