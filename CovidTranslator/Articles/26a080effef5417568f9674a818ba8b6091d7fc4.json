Recent work has attempted to exploit this unique feature by increasing the viral mutation frequency beyond an extinction threshold, an antiviral strategy known as lethal mutagenesis. A number of novel nucleoside analogs have been designed around this premise. Herein, we review the quasispecies nature of RNA viruses and survey the antiviral, biological and biochemical characteristics of mutagenic nucleoside analogs, including clinically-used ribavirin. Biological implications of modulating viral replication fidelity are discussed in the context of translating lethal mutagenesis into a clinically-useful antiviral strategy.",

The mutation rate for RNA viruses is generally accepted to be in the range of 10 \u22125 mutations per incorporated nucleotide, compared with 10 \u22128 -10 \u221211 per base pair for DNAbased organisms [5] . This results in approximately one mutation per genome per replication cycle for RNA viruses, and 0.1 mutations per genome per replication cycle for retroviruses. The equivalent value for DNA-based microbes is 0.003 per genome per replication cycle, even though the genome size is orders of magnitude larger [6] . Clearly, RNA viruses are subject to extensive mutation during replication. This phenomenon is likely due to the absence of a proofreading activity associated with most viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRp), the enzymes responsible for replication of RNA genomes [7] , although recent work suggests that coronaviruses may possess some proofreading activity [8] (which may be a requirement for RNA viruses to have a genome longer than 10,000 nucleotides).",

Most individual genomes in the population will have a sequence differing from the consensus sequence by one or more nucleotide changes. Studies on the chemical mutagenesis of poliovirus (PV) and vesicular stomatitis virus demonstrated that there was an upper limit to the increase in mutation frequency of RNA viruses [12] . Mutation frequencies at a single site could only be increased 1.1-2.8-fold, even in the presence of a mutagen that was sufficient for a 99% reduction in virus viability. Loeb and colleagues, utilizing the retrovirus HIV, also demonstrated significant decreases in virus viability when the mutation frequency was increased only modestly [13] . Serial passage of HIV in the presence of a mutagen that increased the mutation rate only threefold was sufficient for extinction of the virus population. Subsequently, Loeb and Mullins coined the term 'lethal mutagenesis' to describe an antiviral strategy based on increasing the viral mutation rate to a level beyond which the population is no longer genetically viable [14, 15] .",

Viral RNA is replicated following delivery of the genome to the cytoplasm and production of necessary viral proteins, including the RdRp. Replication is error-prone, resulting in the generation of approximately one mutation per progeny genome (left panel). Treatment with a nucleoside mutagen (\u00b5) allows for intracellular accumulation of mono-, di-and triphosphorylated forms (\u00b5MP, \u00b5DP and \u00b5TP). The triphosphory lated analog \u00b5TP functions as an ambiguous substrate for the RdRp, inducing additional mutations into the progeny genomes. This results in more deleterious mutations per genome and therefore a lower average fitness of the viral population.",

Experimental support for this concept was demonstrated in foot-andmouth disease virus, as low viral load or low fitness increased the frequency of viral extinction [21] . Thus, lethal mutagenesis has both genetic and environmental components.

In other words, a high but narrow fitness peak can be inferior to a lower but broader fitness plateau, as mutations on the fitness plateau will only have a minimal effect on overall fitness of the population owing to support from sequences of similar fitness connected on the fitness landscape [23, 24] . Survival of the flat-test should lead to the evolution of 'mutational robustness' in populations subjected to high error rates [27] .

RNA viruses should be particularly sensitive to such a 'genetic meltdown' since their genomes are extraordinarily dense with information. Viral genomes encode for proteins as well as RNA structural signals for translation and replication, and their small sizes have resulted in numerous strategies for maximizing genetic information, including transcriptional slippage [28] and programmed ribosomal frameshifting [29] . The number of allowed mutations per replication cycle should therefore be relatively small. Hence, RNA viruses likely exist at or near the extinction threshold and may be particularly susceptible to minor increases in mutation frequency.",

Natural PV replication results in approximately 1.5 mutations per genome based on sequence ana lysis of capsidcoding regions. When PV was grown in the presence of a mutagen, a dramatic decline in specific infectivity of PV genomic RNA was seen when the mutation frequency exceeded two mutations per genome. Furthermore, an approximate fourfold increase in mutation rate was sufficient to cause a 20-fold reduction in specific infectivity. This observation provides additional support for the notion that only a small increase in mutagenesis is necessary to allow for a potent antiviral effect. Subsequent work has demonstrated extinction of virus populations through the application of chemical mutagens. FMDV was driven into extinction by the combination of a mutagen and an antiviral inhibtor [31] , and more recent work has shown that treatment with a mutagen alone is sufficient for extinction [32, 33] . The mutagenic nucleobase 5-fluorouracil causes an increase in mutation frequency of the prototypic arenavirus lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) and is able to drive the virus population into extinction [34] .",

For 30 years, the antiviral activity of ribavirin was thought to be due to inhibition of cellular inosine 5\u2032-monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH) [47] , although polymerase inhibition, immune modulation and inhibition of 5\u2032 capping of viral RNA have also been implicated as potential mechanisms [46] . More recently, it has become apparent that ribavirin can induce transition mutations in viral genomes via ambiguous base-pairing during or subsequent to incorporation by the viral RdRp. Crotty and colleagues were able to demonstrate RTP incorporation by PV 3Dpol using an in vitro primer-extension assay [48] . RMP was incorporated at approximately the same rate as an incorrect nucleotide opposite either cytidine or uridine, and a template containing ribavirin was able to direct incorporation of both cytidine and uridine at approximately the same efficiency. This promiscuous base-pairing capacity is presumably due to rotation of the carboxamide moiety of the ribavirin pseudobase resulting in two distinct hydrogen-bonding con-figurations ( Figure 3 ).",

Additionally, a nucleoside with different templating properties, for instance a nucleoside that can mimic either cytidine or uridine, could exploit the lower cellular concentration of competing pyrimidines [65] . A pyrimidine analog might be most effective if administered in combination with a purine analog such as ribavirin, allowing for all possible genomic sites to be targeted. Novel nucleoside analogs may also possess other desirable properties such as increased cellular phosphorylation, leading to a more rapid accumulation in the target cell, or improved discrimination by cellular enzymes, providing greater specificity for the antiviral response over off-target cellular effects. Finally, ribavirin treatment causes significant clinical side effects owing to its pleiotropic biological properties [66] .

The related ribonucleoside, 5-aza-5,6-dihydrocytidine, has been clinically investigated in oncology [80] , although no evaluation of its antiviral activity has been published. KP-1212 was shown to inhibit HIV with an EC 50 of 10 nM and therapeutic index of 100,000 [78] . Tautomerization of the nucleobase between the imino and amino form presumably allows base pairing with either of the natural purines (Figure 7) , and this compound increased the mutation frequency of proviral HIV-1 DNA 50-100% with no evidence of evolution of resistance or genotoxicity to the host. KP-1461, a prodrug of KP-1212, is currently in Phase IIa clinical trials as a monotherapy for the treatment of HIV-1 infection in treatment-experienced patients harboring virus with significant resistance to standard antiretrovirals [81] . This trial has been suspended by Koronis to investigate a discrepancy in preclinical in vitro data and to examine Phase IIa clinical results [202] . Suspension was not requested by the US FDA and was not due to safety concerns or observation of drug-related adverse events [202]. Figure 8A ) is a bicyclic pyrimidine analog which can mimic either cytidine or uridine through tautomerization of the nucleobase. This com-pound was shown to induce transition mutations in Escherichia coli [82] and in an in vitro retroviral replication model [83] . PV genomes synthesized in vitro to contain rP demonstrated substantial reductions in viral fitness, and the nucleotide was an efficient and promiscuous substrate of PV 3Dpol [84] . In spite of these properties, rP did not demonstrate antiviral activity against PV in cell culture, owing to insufficient phosphorylation by cellular kinases [84] . While a prodrug approach may ultimately prove fruitful, this highlights the complexity of designing nucleoside analogs that can induce mutagenesis and, at the same time, maintain activity as substrates for critical cellular enzymes, such as nucleoside and nucleotide kinases required for conversion to the nucleoside triphoshate.",

Concentrations for the pyrimidines uridine 5\u2032-triphosphate (UTP) and CTP are approximately 250 and 100 \u00b5M, respectively. The disparity is due primarily to the extremely high intracellular concentration of ATP, indicative of its essential role as an energy source for myriad cellular processes. Development of pyrimidine analogs thus ensures that intracellular competitors are at a minimum, potentially requiring lower drug concentrations to be effective. Additionally, the purines are intimately involved in essential cellular chemistry beyond DNA and RNA synthesis, being necessary for such diverse processes as metabolic processes, signaling and translation.

This will prove challenging, as the specific structure-function relationships defining substrate specificities for these enzymes are still largely a mystery. Recent work with 2\u2032-modified nucleoside analogs may provide a first step in this direction [90] . These analogs appear to be incorporated by the HCV RdRp and appear to act as chain terminators. Further experimentation demonstrated that 2\u2032-modified nucleoside analogs were inhibitors of the HCV RdRp both in vitro and in vivo [91] . In this case, a mutation conferring resistance was discovered in the RdRp and resistance was directed towards the specific 2\u2032-modification. Importantly, it appears as if these nucleoside analogs are not incorporated by cellular DNA-dependent DNA polymerases or DNAdependent RNA polymerases [90, 91] . This resulted in minimal cellular toxicity at concentrations effective for virus inhibition, and intracellular phosphorylation did not appear to be rate limiting. These promising experiments indicate that modifications to the pentose ring of the nucleoside may allow antiviral activity to be retained while reducing cytotoxicity to the host cell, although differences in substrate selection by various polymerases may render such modifications viral specific. It is important to note, however, that at this time the ability of the mitochondrial transcription machinery to be impacted by these analogs has not been addressed.",

RNA viruses may actually replicate at a suboptimal error rate [20] . Thus, it may be possible that exposure of a virus population to a drug which increases the mutation rate during replication may allow that population to access a peak on the fitness landscape that was unattainable without treatment. This may allow for resistance to the mutagen itself, or to a drug targeting another viral process that is coadministered with the mutagen.

Not surprisingly, a ribavirin-resistant variant of PV was identified (PV-G64S) [95, 96] , whereby resistance is mediated through an increase in polymerase fidelity of approximately threefold. Importantly, although two separate research groups were able to isolate a ribavirin-resistant PV variant, both isolates had exactly the same mutation. This suggests that there may be a very limited number of resistance mechanisms to counter continued exposure to a mutagen. Interestingly, this mutation occurs at a location of the enzyme remote from the catalytic site.",

The M296I polymerase incorporates RMP less efficiently than the wildtype polymerase, although quasispecies diversity was not restricted [97] . Biochemical evaluation of the polymerase revealed that this polymerase has lower fidelity (by 2.5-fold) than the wild-type, but with a specific discrimination against ribavirin utilization [ARIAS A ET AL., SUBMITTED MANUSCRIPT (2008)]. Thus, FMDV can attain resistance by decreasing the efficiency of ribavirin incorporation, although this results in a trade-off of fidelity for normal nucleotide incorporation (specifically, a higher frequency of GMP misincorporation). Interestingly, this is not the first mutator phenotype identified for an RNA virus [98] , but it does demonstrate that multiple mechanisms exist to confer resistance to lethal mutagens, and further underscores the importance of a tightly-controlled mutation rate in RNA virus populations.",

Targeting viral polymerases with small molecule drugs could possibly affect the conformational dynamics required for fidelity of viral replication, thus creating an antiviral effect. However, the interactions necessary to elicit such an effect are unknown, complicating design of such a drug. Furthermore, high-throughput screening approaches to identify small molecules that modulate small changes in fidelity are technically challenging.

Surprisingly, this was not due to increased frequency of ribavirin incorporation, as CVB3 3Dpol utilized ribavirin less efficiently than PV 3Dpol in an in vitro primer extension assay [GRACI JD ET AL., MANUSCRIPT IN PREPARATION]. Instead, CVB3 appears to be constrained by a lower extinction threshold, as an equivalent number of mutations caused a more deleterious fitness effect on the CVB3 genome than the PV genome [GRACI JD ET AL., MANUSCRIPT IN PREPARATION (2008) ].

In this regard, clinical trials of new antiviral mutagens, such as KP-1212 and KP-1461, will provide critical insight for translating in vitro observations to therapeutic use, as well as providing new avenues for drug development. While a number of nucleoside analogs, particularly those exhibiting ambiguous base pairing properties, have shown sufficient mutagenicity to be potent antivirals in vitro, pharmacological and toxicological liabilities remain. Thus, research leading to improved selectivity and pharmacological properties is required. Understanding the substrate specificity of host cell kinases and ribonucleotide reductases is still in its infancy, but is a field which can have profound implications on the design of future antiviral nucleosides.
