Two approaches can be used: demonstration of a specific antibody response or of the presence of the virus itself. Serological methods are used for measuring the antibody response while the presence of virus can be demonstrated by cultivation or demonstration of specific antigens or gene sequences. For the latter, molecular diagnostic methods have become more and more widely applied.",

Following transmission, the virus starts to multiply and after an incubation period clinical symptoms appear with simultaneous shedding of infectious virus. Virus-specific antibodies appear somewhat later (from some days to weeks, called a window period). When the virus-specific antibody production reaches the level of detection, at first immunoglobulin M(IgM) antibodies and some days later immunoglobulin G(IgG) antibodies appear, and the amount of infectious virus starts to decrease. If this is the first encounter with this particular virus, that is, a primary immune response, IgG antibody levels can stay at a relatively low level, whereas in a later contact with the same antigen, that is, in secondary response, IgG levels increase rapidly and reach high levels while IgM response may not be detectable at all. Antibodies are usually investigated from serum samples taken at acute and convalescent phase of the infection. In selected cases other materials such as cerebrospinal fluid and other body fluids can also be analyzed.",

Patient's serum is incubated with the antigen and the bound antibody, after washing steps, is visualized using labeled anti-immunoglobulin antibodies ('conjugate') ( Figure 2(a) ). If the label used is an enzyme, the test is called enzyme immunoassay (EIA) or enzymelinked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and the bound antibody is detected by an enzyme-dependent color reaction. If a fluorescent label is used, the method is called immunofluorescent test (IFT). The enzyme labels most commonly used are horseradish peroxidase (HRP) and alkaline phosphatase (AP). In HRP-EIA the color-forming system consists of ortho-phenyldiamine (OPD) as a chromogen and hydrogen peroxidase (H 2 O 2 ) as a substrate. If the HRP-conjugate is bound to antibody-antigen complexes, the colorless chromogen becomes yellow and color intensity is measured with a photometer at a wavelength of 490-492 nm. The intensity of the color is proportional to the amount of bound conjugate and to the amount of specific antibodies in a patient serum sample. If the serum contains no specific antibodies, the conjugate is not bound and no color reaction occurs. By using either anti-IgG or anti-IgM conjugates it is possible to determine separately immunoglobulin subclasses. The specificity and sensitivity of these immunoassays are high. The sensitivity can be improved further, by using an additional incubation step where IgM antibodies are first enriched ('captured') in the sample by using anti-IgM immunoglobulin. Modifications to improve assay specificity by various methods of antigen handling and by using monoclonal antibodies or synthetic peptides have been developed.",

A single microarray test (microchip) can contain thousands of virusspecific oligonucleotide probes spotted on a glass slide. Several kit applications for detecting viral nucleic acids and antigens or virus-specific antibodies already exist. Microarrays based on random PCR amplification can be used to detect a variety of viruses belonging to different families. Screening of some other infection markers can be also included in the same test format. Microarrays are not widely used for clinical purposes because of limited sensitivity and the difficulties of developing analytical instruments suitable for diagnostic laboratories.

            "text": "After the early 1960s, it became apparent that invertebrates, as well as vertebrates and plants, played host to a number of small (<40 nm in diameter) icosahedral viruses with RNA genomes. The initial descriptions of many of these viruses involved little more than their physical and biochemical characteristics such as diameter, density, and S-value. By the 1970s, many new invertebrate small RNA viruses were being isolated and described and even minimal characterization made it clear that new families of viruses were emerging from this assemblage of small RNA-containing viruses of invertebrates, along with apparent members of existing virus families. Two major families of viruses recognized in the late 1970s and early 1980s were the Tetraviridae and Nodaviridae. Any of the other viruses were simply considered to be 'invertebrate picornaviruses' or 'small RNA viruses of insects'. The properties of many of the yet-unclassified viruses were found to be very similar to those of the mammalian picornaviruses. In particular, the size of the virions (c. 30 nm), the composition of the capsids (three major proteins of around 30 kDa), and single-stranded, positive-sense RNA genomes all suggested these were invertebrate picornaviruses and this was very much the prevalent feelinguntil 1998. At this point, the first full genome sequence of one such invertebrate virus, drosophila C virus (DCV), was published and surprisingly revealed a genome organization strikingly different from the picornaviruses, and indeed quite different from any other viruses known at that time. During the next several years, the genomes of a number of insect small RNA-containing viruses were sequenced and it became clear that two organizational paradigms existed. The first group became the Dicistroviridae while the second has become the (currently) unassigned genus Iflavirus.",
