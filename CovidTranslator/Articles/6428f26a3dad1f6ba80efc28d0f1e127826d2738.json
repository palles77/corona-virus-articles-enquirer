Diseases including severe acute respiratory syndrome, west nile virus encephalitis and avian influenza have focused public attention on interrelationships between wildlife, domestic animal and human health. Understanding factors responsible for disease transmission and distribution is critical to controlling disease. Traditionally, disease transmission dynamics have been assumed to be random and to increase proportionally with population size. However, complex social behaviours can result in contacts among infected and susceptible individuals that are not solely explained by density (Altizer et al. 2004) . Therefore, social organization should influence contacts among individuals, and the distribution and spread of disease. Molecular genetic markers are ideal tools to elucidate the role of genealogical relationships in disease transmission in wildlife populations without undertaking detailed observational studies.",

Bovine TB is spread through direct contact among animals (Thoen & Himes 1981) and indirect contact with contaminated food (Palmer et al. 2004) . Until 1999, feeding resulted in large aggregations of deer leading to high rates of animal contact probably facilitating disease transmission. Cessation of feeding and increased harvest was enacted to reduce deer density and contacts among animals, common management strategies for controlling disease. These actions will not be sufficient to eliminate disease, however, if host behaviours result in non-random contacts and thus non-random disease transmission (McCallum et al. 2001) .",

Because there were more non-infected deer than TB-infected deer, the differences in relatedness between TB-infected and non-infected deer were evaluated by bootstrap re-sampling (Manly 1997) . For each distance class, we calculated mean relatedness among a randomly selected number of non-infected deer equal to the number of TB-infected deer. This process was repeated 5000 times. We estimated the probability that non-infected deer were more closely related than TB-infected deer as the number of times mean relatedness among non-infected deer was higher than among TB-infected deer divided by 5000 (Manly 1997) . We evaluated the difference in relatedness from 1998 to 2000 among TB-infected deer harvested in the same location as the number of times relatedness between pairs of TB-infected deer in 1998 was greater than between pairs in 2000 divided by the total number of pairs.",

However, contact among animals appears to be the mechanism by which susceptible individuals become infected. Our findings suggest that the contacts that occur within social groups (of related individuals) are an important mechanism of disease transmission.

Failure to account for life-history characteristics related to transmission can impede control efforts (Hutchings & White 2000; Woodroffe et al. 2006) . For example, badger (Meles meles) culling in the UK aimed at reducing TB disrupted badger social structure and increased TB in cattle (Donnelly et al. 2003) . Understanding factors responsible for TB transmission among white-tailed deer in Michigan is a high priority in order to control the disease, protect human and domestic animal health and alleviate economic loss. Standard observational or telemetry methods were not sufficient to resolve relationships among large numbers of individuals in this population and assess the role of genealogical relationship to disease risk. Molecular genetic markers can be used to identify the mechanisms of disease transmission without having to undertake detailed, individual-level fieldwork. Our results demonstrate that epidemiological models should incorporate aspects of host social organization likely to affect disease transmission (Wobeser 2002) .",
