It is believed that active fractions of mannoproteins (AFMs) obtained through extraction and fractionation of yeast cell walls (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) may beneficially modulate the immune system. However, studies that have evaluated this component and the effects of ageing on the immune system of dogs are scarce. This study aimed to evaluate the immunological effects of AFMs in adult and elderly dogs. Three extruded iso-nutrient experimental diets were formulated: without addition of AFM (T0); with AFM at 400 mg/kg (T400); and with AFM at 800 mg/kg (T800). Thirty-six beagle dogs were used, and six experimental treatments, resulting in combinations of age (adult and elderly) and diet (T0, T400, and T800), were evaluated. On days zero, 14, and 28, blood samples were obtained for leucocyte phenotyping and phagocytosis assays. On days zero and 28, a lymphoproliferation test, quantification of reactive oxygen (H 2 O 2 ) and nitrogen (NO) intermediate production, evaluation of faecal immunoglobulin A (IgA) content, and a delayed cutaneous hypersensitivity test (DCHT) were performed. Statistical analyses were performed with SAS software. Repeated measure variance analyses were performed, and means were compared by the Tukey test. Values of P \u2264 0.05 were considered significant, and values of P \u2264 0.10 were considered tendencies. Dogs fed T400 tended to have higher neutrophilic phagocytic activity than dogs fed T800 (P = 0.073). Regarding reactive oxygen intermediates, bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated neutrophils from animals that were fed T400 had a tendency to produce more H 2 O 2 than those from animals fed the control diet (P = 0.093). Elderly dogs, when compared to adult dogs, had lower absolute T and B lymphocyte counts, lower auxiliary T lymphocyte counts, and higher cytotoxic T lymphocyte counts (P < 0.05). A significant effect of diet, age, and time with saline inoculation was noted for the DCHT. There was no effect of diet or",

During the process of ageing, alterations in the immunological system lead to increased morbidity and mortality because of infections and age-related diseases, a process called immunosenescence. Among these changes are decreased a proliferative response of blood mononuclear cells, reduced peripheral blood lymphocyte numbers, including those of B, T, and CD4 + T helper cells, increased CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes, and a consequent decrease in the CD4+/ CD8+ ratio (Franceschi et al., 2000; Day, 2010; Bauer and Fuente, 2016) . Although the focus of immunosenescence characterization is acquired immunity, changes in innate immunity components may also contribute to a generalized decline in immune function during senescence (Greeley et al., 2001 ).",

Innate immunity acts concurrently with adaptative immunity and is characterized by a rapid response to injury, regardless of previous stimulus (Sigal and Ron, 1994) . Adaptative immunity is induced by cellular memory as a result of exposure to microorganisms or antigens and is very effective at preventing infection propagation (Samartin and Chandra, 2001) .",

The yeast cell wall comprises \u03b2-(1,3)-D-glucan, \u03b2-(1,6)-D-glucan, chitin, and mannoproteins (Koll\u00e1r et al., 1997) , all of which have potential action on the immune system.

Lymphocyte proliferation assay Lymphocyte proliferation was measured using the commercial Cell Trace CFSE Cell Proliferation kit (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR, USA) on samples from days 1 and 28. Cells were suspended in RPMI 1640 medium (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA), and the cellular concentration was adjusted to 5 \u00d7 10 6 cells/mL. After running the CFSE protocol according to the instructions in the commercial kit, 100 \u03bcL of cells were placed in duplicate in 96-well round-bottom plates, as follows: 100 \u03bcL of cells with no CFSE incubation (negative control) plus 100 \u03bcL of complete medium (RPMI-1640 medium plus 40 mg/mL gentamicin and 10 % foetal bovine serum (FBS); Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA); 100 \u03bcL of cells with CFSE incubation (positive control) plus 100 \u03bcL of complete medium; or 100 \u03bcL of cells with CFSE incubation plus 100 \u03bcL of Concanavalin A solution (ConA, 100 mg/mL diluted 1:10 in a complete medium). Plates were kept at 37\u00b0C in a humidified 5 % CO 2 incubator (Thermo Fisher Scientific Revco, Mod. RCO3000T-9-ABC, Waltham, MA, USA) for 5 d. Later, cells were transferred to flow cytometry tubes in duplicate. Tubes were centrifuged, the supernatant was discarded and 1 mL of 1 % formaldehyde PBS was added to each tube. Samples were read with flow cytometer (FACSCanto\u00ae, Becton Dickinson Immunocytometry System, Mountain View, CA, USA), and data were analysed with FlowJo\u00ae Software (Tree Star Inc., Ashland, OR, USA).",

To quantify these cells, monoclonal antibodies (AbDSerotec, Raleigh, NC, USA) against surface markers were used. After adding 100 \u03bcL of total blood to polystyrene tubes, 2 \u03bcL of each antibody was added, homogenized and incubated for 20 min.

Beneficial bacteria indirectly affect the immune system by producing substances with immunostimulatory properties that interact with the immune system in many ways, including cytokine production, mononuclear cell proliferation, macrophagic phagocytosis, and induction of immunoglobulin synthesis (Macfarlane and Cummings, 1999) . Therefore, the influence of diet may be better understood by evaluating the microbiota present in the intestinal lumen after addition of mannoproteins. Although current research has not evaluated this parameter, a study performed by Swanson et al. (2002) demonstrated that supplementation with 0.3 % MOS positively influenced microbial populations, with a tendency for increasing the abundance of Lactobacillus spp., along with a tendency to increase serum IgA and ileal IgA levels when associated with intake of fructooligosacharides (FOSs). Middelbos et al. (2007) reported increased ileal IgA with the addition of 0.25 % yeast cell wall. By studying the oral intake of 225 mg of beta-1,3/1,6-glucans in the form of tablets, Stuyven et al.

Characteristic mechanisms by which active mannoprotein fractions act on immunity, however, are not known. Immune modulation as a result of prebiotics intake appears to act on GALT, secondary lymphoid tissues, and peripheral cells, according to Schley and Field (2002) , possibly because of direct contact with lactic acid bacteria, products of the cell wall or cytoplasmic components of intestinal cells, by production of short-chain fatty acids derived from fermentation, or through mucin production changes. Mansour et al. (2002) established that AFMs act by binding to mannose receptors in macrophages, which serve as a link between the innate and acquired immune responses, and the MOS fraction acts to activate macrophages by occupying mannose receptor sites of glycoproteins on their cell surface. Once these sites are occupied, a chain reaction begins, resulting in the activation of macrophages and cytokine secretion.",

Animal Feed Science and Technology 261 (2020) 114392 acquired immunity of adult and elderly dogs, with beneficial immunomodulating effects. Active fractions of mannoproteins had effects on some parameters of the specific and nonspecific immune responses mediated by cells, such as a increased percentage of phagocytic activity by neutrophils, increased production of H 2 O 2, and enhanced cutaneous responses in elderly dogs to vaccine and phytohemagglutinin stimuli. Elderly dogs are affected by the immunosenescence process, as evidenced by a decrease in lymphocytic counts and the proliferation ability of these cells. Therefore, the immune responses of dogs may benefit from the addition of active fractions of mannoproteins in the diet.",
