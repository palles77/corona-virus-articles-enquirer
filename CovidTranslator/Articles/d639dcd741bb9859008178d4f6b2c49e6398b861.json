Indeed, the effectiveness of control measures fundamentally depends greatly on human beliefs on public infection awareness and risk perception for driving the change in self-behavior. 3 Infection and Drug Resistance 2018:11 submit your manuscript | www.dovepress.com",

SteelFisher et al 6 indicated that 60% of the adult population said that they did not intend to acquire the H1N1 vaccine for themselves. In addition, perception of vaccine safety and personal vulnerability were the major reasons for vaccine acceptance. Allison et al 7 indicated that children could use accurate protective behavior; for example, they could use hand gel for preventing influenza. On the other hand, childhood vaccination is more likely to depend on parental decision making. Moreover, researchers have suggested assessment of the risk perception and behavior across different age groups. 8, 9 A social network could be an important social structure in which people could exchange information about risk-related events to spur the health behavior change. 10 Scherer and Cho 11 suggested that individual perceptions could be affected by self-perception in the social network. Researchers have explored the interactions between epidemic spreading and risk perception in the network. 12, 13 However, the influence of risk perception on the risk of infectious disease is controversial, because the perceptual capacity of individuals may both create and reduce the disease risks. Therefore, the behavior-disease dynamics in the social network structure may result in amplification or attenuation of the disease outbreak.",

Moreover, the effects the network with human responses to disease spreading were studied extensively and attracted substantial attention. Funk et al 12 used SIRbased perceptual-influenza model for examining the effects of risk perception on behavioral change and susceptibility reduction. They also indicated that the effects within a disease network can induce health behavioral changes in the population. In turn, the influence of risk perception could result in a feedback signal to alter the progress of the disease dynamics. 12, 14 Recently, information theoretical approaches have been applied to infer the relations in diseases or social networks. 15, 16 Zhao et al 15 developed a model to quantify the effects of a dynamic network, indicating that the behavior responses correspond to the entropy derived from different information content of the dynamic social network. Greenbaum et al 17 proposed an information theoretic model to assess pandemic risk. They indicated that mutual information was a key determinant in minimizing risk of the pandemic threats.",

Basic reproduction number (R 0 ) can be used to quantify disease infection severity, defined as the average number of secondary cases produced successfully by an infected individual in a totally susceptible population. 22 Therefore, based on the BI model, we can also estimate R 0 with the perception state (R a 0 ) and without perception state (R d 0 ).

To our knowledge, we have conducted the first step on exploring the effects of risk perception in a population, on the spread of epidemics. We believe that our present methodology provides an innovative approach that integrates an epidemiology model with the information theory. We examined three scenarios for describing different agespecific populations to overcome susceptibility risk due to less accurate knowledge of influenza. We found that noise effect, which reflects as overlapping percentages about the uncertainty of accurate knowledge of influenza, can reduce risk perception information transfer on the network through the epidemic transmission. For example, previous studies found that participants had misconceptions between seasonal vaccine and pandemic strain. 36, 37 The effect of overlapping response may have resulted from the public health campaigns. For example, people were recommended to acquire the seasonal vaccine in pandemics. This may lead to a feedback mechanism between behavior change and disease dynamics. Future work should carefully consider the effects of this noise on specific age groups. Moreover, each intervention should be carefully investigated to the extent possible during an epidemic.",
