To do this, the type 1 error is allocated to different outcomes, most simply through the specification of a single primary outcome measure (where a one sided P value of <0.025 is conventionally regarded as statistically significant). Alternatively, the available type 1 error may be split between different primary outcomes, or indeed outcomes may be placed in a predefined hierarchical list, with type 1 error \"spent\" down the list until the conventional one sided 2.5% \u03b1 level is reached (equivalent to a two sided 5% level-but no drug is ever licensed for being significantly worse than the comparator).",

Composite outcomes can help in avoiding arbitrary decisions between different candidate outcomes when prespecifying the primary outcome, and they have several advantages. However, a positive result for a composite outcome applies only to the cluster of events included in the composite and not to the individual components. Regulatory behaviour may have led to the addition of \"death\" to many composite primary end points used in trials, and it is our experience that the Food and Drug Administration has actively promoted the use of such composite outcome measures in heart failure trials. The DREAM trial, of rosiglitazone in the prevention of diabetes in patients with impaired fasting glucose or glucose tolerance (or both), had the composite primary outcome measure of diabetes or death. 7 The primary outcome was highly statistically significant, although there was no difference in the rate of death between the groups (30/2635 (1.1%) in the rosiglitazone group and 33/2634 (1.3%) in the placebo group).

Indeed, as the US represents about 60% of the world market for drugs, FDA policy drives the design of regulatory trials. Two areas of concern require attention. Firstly, the regulators should ensure that primary outcome variables in regulatory trials really do \"provide a valid and reliable measure of some clinically relevant and important treatment benefit in the patient population. . .,\" 8 as required in the regulators' own guidance on the design and analysis of clinical trials. Secondly, while it is our opinion that composite outcome measures do have a useful role in the evaluation of health technologies, the difficult problem of the appropriate interpretation of composite outcome measures in regulatory policy should be dealt with. This might be achieved by using a corollary (such as a health warning), which makes it clear that on their own the individual components of a composite have not been shown to be affected by the experimental treatment. preferentially increases blood flow to these units, improving ventilation-perfusion matching and oxygenation. Theoretically, these actions could improve oxygenation and oxygen delivery, allow for less injurious mechanical ventilation, and ultimately reduce the prevalence or severity of the multiorgan dysfunction that is the cause of death in most patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome. Unfortunately, randomised controlled trials of inhaled nitric oxide have not borne out this theory. Adhikari and colleagues' methodologically rigorous and clinically sound systematic review and meta-analysis of 12 randomised controlled trials provides evidence that nitric oxide can provide modest short term improvements in oxygenation. However, all but one of the nine relative risk point estimates for mortality favoured patients in control groups. This lack of concordance between physiological improvements and outcome for patients is a recurring theme in critical care, 6 7 and it probably plays a part in our collective reluctance to abandon these interventions.",

Indeed given the costs and potential for harm, its routine use in acute respiratory distress syndrome should be actively discouraged. I suggest that it should be used in this syndrome only for rare cases of refractory hypoxaemia, after considering modalities such as high frequency oscillation or prone positioning. 9 In the light of this new evidence should we persist with trying to show that nitric oxide improves outcomes in acute respiratory distress syndrome? Not finding a benefit is not proof of no benefit. However, the trend towards harm seen across these many trials makes it unlikely that we will eventually prove a benefit through persistence alone. This does not mean that nitric oxide is without merit; it is still useful in other diseases such as persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn. 10 Even in acute respiratory distress syndrome, nitric oxide may yet have a role outside salvage therapy for severe hypoxaemia, but this work by Adhikari and colleagues indicates that we need to change radically the designs of randomised controlled trials of nitric oxide in these patients. For example, future trials could explore alternative dosing schedules for nitric oxide (such as titrated decremental dosing 11 ), the application of nitric oxide to specific subgroups of patients, or combining nitric oxide with other treatments (such as mechanical ventilation strategies to reduce pressure, or early aggressive fluid resuscitation 12 ) .",

            "text": "An imperfect measure of a modest predictor of response to antidepressants may not be ready for clinical application Patients' responses to treatment with antidepressants vary greatly. The largest study on the effectiveness of antidepressants to date suggested that roughly one third of patients will recover fully given a long enough trial, one third will improve substantially, and one third will not respond. 1 A subset in all three groups will have adverse effects such as sexual dysfunction, insomnia, nausea, and weight gain. Side effects are rarely dangerous, but they cause many patients to discontinue treatment, often after a single prescription. 2 Similar concerns exist for many drugs, not just antidepressants. What makes antidepressants especially frustrating for clinicians and patients is the lack of factors to predict how individual patients will respond to a given treatment. We know that one third of patients will have minimal improvement, but we have few data to guide selection of alternative treatments. Indeed, while the psychiatric literature abounds with reports of clinical predictors, the findings are rarely replicated. 3 One of the only replicated predictors, that atypical depression responds better to monoamine oxidase inhibitors than to tricyclics, does not seem to apply to newer antidepressants. Worse, many of the widely touted and taught predictors turn out to be invalid on closer inspection. For example, conventional wisdom holds that antidepressants with \"activating\" properties, such as bupropion, are less likely to be effective in patients with anxiety or insomnia. In a clinical trial, however, this was not the case. 4 5 Any predictive test, especially one with the shiny lustre of genetics and the promise of rapid and highly accurate results, therefore causes excitement among psychiatric clinicians. The marketing of a test that can define a person's genetic profile in terms of two important P450 enzymes has generated just this sort of excitement. One journal devoted its cover to the headline, \"New tool: genotyping makes prescribing safer, more effective!\" However, a recent report by the US Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality 6 found little evidence to support a role for cytochrome P450 genotyping when prescribing antidepressants.",

            "text": "As the agency report highlights, both aspects of this argument are suspect. The 11 studies that examined the relation between P450 genotype and antidepressant concentrations found only the suggestion of an association. A key point here is that P450 genotype is just one of many factors that influence drug concentrations. Other factors include variables that can change over time, such as diet, smoking, and cotreatment with other P450 substrates or inhibitors. 7 Furthermore, newer generations of antidepressants do not exhibit clear dose-response relations, and concentrations of antidepressants in the blood are rarely informative, except at the extremes. Measuring drug concentrations may be more useful in populations at higher risk; one study of depressed elderly patients did suggest that therapeutic drug monitoring led to changes in treatment about half the time. 8 So P450 genotype is not an accurate predictor of drug concentration in the blood, which in turn is not a strong predictor of outcome. Still, even modestly accurate predictors might have benefit. Unfortunately, no adequately powered studies have investigated this question directly. The suggestion that people who metabolise antidepressants rapidly may have a worse response and that those who metabolise them slowly may have more side effects is encouraging but not convincing. Notably, the largest study to look at this question failed to find an effect on adverse effects. 9 Therefore, before P450 genotyping can be recommended when prescribing antidepressants, we need to establish that this test can help improve outcomes, either in terms of tolerability or effectiveness. Studies that examine the effects of P450 in populations where the consequences of adverse effects might be greater (such as elderly patients) or suspicion of metabolic differences is high, or in patients who fail to respond to multiple antidepressant trials, would be particularly valuable. In the meantime, what should individual clinicians do? Where concern for drug interactions or toxicity is high, the simplest approach is to begin with antidepressants minimally metabolised by P450 isoforms CYP2D6, CYP3A, and CYP2C19. If this is not practical, the most direct and informative approach is to check concentrations of antidepressants in the blood.",

An antiviral agent might even be of limited use in practice. Many cases are identified late, after the appearance of irreversible sequelae.

If the introduction of smallpox did produce multiple cases, the epidemiological pattern of severity would provide a fairly accurate diagnosis. In fact, the unique appearance of a patient with early severe smallpox would quickly be disseminated via the media, and subsequent cases would be recognised by lay people.

Under current Western social circumstances of small family size and highly efficient communication, the number of cases is unlikely to be large. 5 Most cases of smallpox are acquired at the bedside, whether in urban hospitals 6 or in rural villages, 4 and transmission between houses occurs through social relationships. If a large outbreak did occur, it would probably be the result of simultaneous exposures to the same (hospital) bedside rather than extended transmission. 6 If a chain of transmission does not die out on its own, it would quickly be contained by the standard control techniques of public health and hospital epidemiologists. 5 The unique appearance of an infectious case; the interval of roughly two weeks between exposure and symptoms; and the triad of surveillance, isolation, and effective vaccination would act together to ensure that control is established within a few case generations. Neither a widespread nor a long term epidemic is probable, whether judged from past history, 6 from extrapolation of the experience with severe acute respiratory syndrome, 7 or from any of the recent mathematical models. [8] [9] [10] [11] The net impact of an introduction would be comparable to a large common source outbreak of a severe disease caused by an agent such as hantavirus or encephalitis virus, although that impact might be substantially augmented by complications if mass vaccination were to be initiated. 5 Thus, a case can be made for destroying the stocks, given the absence of compelling contrary arguments, although the stocks do not pose a great threat. Destroying the stocks would have two added benefits-it would fulfil the commitment made by the US in 1990 to destroy stocks after the genome had been identified and it would circumvent any pressures to return stocks to their countries of origin. 2 Another real benefit would be the permanent elimination of this question as a distraction. More important problems need to be dealt with. Even more dangerous viruses may be found in P4 and lesser facilities. Release of the highly virulent recombinant 1918 influenza virus would be a real catastrophe, 12 yet retention and distribution of recombinant strains for study is enthusiastically justified on the basis of the need for effective prevention, diagnosis, and treatment.",
