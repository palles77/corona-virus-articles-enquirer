Plastic chip has the potential of mass production for clinical use for its advantages in biocompatibility and low cost. In this work, the method for fabrication of poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) chip was described, and conditions for DNA separation were investigated with the chip. The PMMA microchip was used for detection of multiplex PCR products of 18 and 36 cases with SARS and hepatitis B virus infection under optimized separation conditions. Microchip electrophoresis showed higher sensitivity, higher resolution and less time consumption when compared with gel electrophoresis. The microchip electrophoresis with PMMA chip provided a rapid, sensitive and reliable method for analysis of multiplex PCR products.",

            "text": "Microchip electrophoresis is a promising technique for separation; it has been applied to analyze various biological samples. The microchips have been fabricated in silicon, glass, quartz and plastic substrates. Plastic chip has been frequently used recently because of its advantages in biocompatibility and lower cost as well as increased flexibility with respect to fabrication methods and substrate dimensions [1] . Plastic chips can be made of a variety of polymeric materials, such as poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) [2] , polycarbonate [3] , SU-8 photoresist [4] , Zeonor 1020 [5] and the elastic poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) [6, 7] . Polymeric substrates have then been patterned by laser ablation [1] , X-ray lithography [8] , injection-molding [9] and imprinting with master templates [10] . Mass production of plastic chip may effectively reduce the cost. There are many methods for mass production of polymeric devices, such as the devices of silicone structures fabricated by a casting protocol [11] , the production of microseparation channels in plastic substrates via laser ablation [12] , the fabrication of micro-channel chips in acrylic substrate with an injection-mold method [9] and rapid prototyping for injection-molded integrated micro-fluidic devices and diffractive element arrays [13] . In summary, injectionmolding, compression-molding or stamping processes provide the possibility of mass production of essentially evenly fabricated plastic micro-devices from a single master in a cost-effective manner.",

Briefly, the schematic of the channels was first drawn using the CAD software. The image was reproduced on the chrome glass to serve as mask for photolithography. An oxide silicon layer was produced on the surface of a 4 in. silicon wafer with crystal orientation 1 0 0 . Subsequently, a layer of photoresist was spin-coated over the oxide silicon layer, followed by being exposed to UV light through the mask aligned to the wafer flat. The photoresist was then developed to reveal the transferred image. Therefore, all the area defining the channels was exposed in this step. The exposed silicon oxide layer was etched with hydrofluoric acid before serially rinsed with distilled water and acetone to remove the photoresist.",

In brief, the output radiation (532 nm) from an air-cooled laser diode (LD)-pumped solid-state laser (20 mW) (Mektec Seiwa Corporation, Beijing, China) passes through a 532 nm filter (Omega Optical, Brattleboro, VT). The beam is reflected by a dichroic beam splitter (Omega Optical) and focused into the channel through a 20\u00d7 microscope objective (0.4 NA). The emission signal is collected by the same objective and transmitted back through the dichroic beam-splitter. The emission beam passes through a bandpass filter (Omega Optical), which may be alternated easily to fit a wide selection of dyes, and is focused by a focusing lens through a 400 m pinhole. The photo-multiplier tube (Hamamatsu Photonics R212, Japan) is mounted in an integrated detection module including high voltage power supply, voltage divider and amplifier. The charge coupled device (CCD) camera is fixed at the same board as the photomultiplier tube to focus and observe the channel. The whole optical system is installed on the X-Y-Z translational stage (3-D micromanipulator, which adjusting precision is 1 m), and the focus can be controlled via picture displayed on the screen.",

Microchip electrophoresis showed higher sensitivity in the detection of SARS virus. We ascribed the reason to sample collection; the samples of SARS virus infection were all collected at day 10, when the virus was presented in body fluids at high levels, while that of hepatitis B virus infection were collected during intervals of antivirus therapy. Therefore, the level of hepatitis B virus in blood can be very low during the recovery phase. Microchip electrophoresis showed much higher sensitivity and less time consumption than agarose gel electrophoresis. The relatively low sensitivity of gel electrophoresis, which might cause false negative seems to be disadvantage for PCR products detection. Electroosmotic flow in the channel of PMMA chip was minimized using HPMC-TBE buffer as a dynamic coating, which was stable for multiple injection/separation operations and provided reproducible results. Separation time was therefore decreased with the absence of electroosmotic flow. Since DNA was less adsorptive to the surface of the micro-channel of PMMA chip, peaks with good form were obtained. The high resolution of microchip electrophoresis enables rapid analysis of multiple PCR products and the high sensitivity ensured low level of virus copy could be detected. At the same time, experiments became convenient with the fast separation and simple operation.",
