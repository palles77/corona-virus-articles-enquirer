            "text": "With extremely short generation times and high mutability, many viruses can rapidly evolve and adapt to changing environments. This ability is generally beneficial to viruses as it allows them to evade host immune responses, evolve new behaviours, and exploit ecological niches. However, natural selection typically generates adaptation in response to the immediate selection pressures that a virus experiences in its current host. Consequently, we argue that some viruses, particularly those characterised by long durations of infection and ongoing replication, may be susceptible to short-sighted evolution, whereby a virus' adaptation to its current host will be detrimental to its onward transmission within the host population. Here we outline the concept of shortsighted viral evolution and provide examples of how it may negatively impact viral transmission among hosts. We also propose that viruses that are vulnerable to short-sighted evolution may exhibit strategies that minimise its effects. We speculate on the various mechanisms by which this may be achieved, including viral life history strategies that result in low rates of within-host evolution, or the establishment of a 'germline' lineage of viruses that avoids short-sighted evolution. These concepts provide a new perspective on the way in which some viruses have been able to establish and maintain global pandemics.",

Chronic viral infection: a persistent infection characterised by continual viral/proviral production and high viral/proviral loads. Founder strain(s): the viral strain(s) that initiate an infection in a host. These are also referred to as transmitted/founder (TF) viruses. Germline lineage (population): a within-host viral lineage (population) that has undergone less evolutionary change than the majority of viral lineages (populations) within the host. Mutation rate: the rate at which spontaneous mutations are generated, measured per viral replication. Persistent viral infection: an infection that is not cleared and lasts for the lifetime of the host. Provirus: a viral genome that has integrated into the DNA of a host cell. Short-sighted evolution: evolutionary change that is adaptive within a host, but limits the ability of the virus to transmit to new hosts. Transmission interval: the typical time between infection of a host and onward transmission to a new host. Viral generation time: the average time between two consecutive generations along a within-host viral lineage. This can be estimated as the average time for viruses/proviruses to complete a full replication cycle in a given population, and therefore can also be considered the cell-to-cell generation time.

Viral adaptation to these changes may result in short-sighted evolution. Unsurprisingly, most evidence for the loss of transmissibility following within-host adaptation comes from HIV-1. In the bid to develop a vaccine, there has been intense interest in characterising the viruses that are successfully transmitted and which initiate new infections (so-called transmitted/founder, or TF, viruses). Crucially, many of the characteristics of TF viruses appear to be selected against during the course of infection. Perhaps the most frequently cited of these is the switch from using the CCR5 to the CXCR4 coreceptor during late-stage infection in some patients, enabling the virus to infect na\u00efve CD4 + T cells; in late infection there is a fall in the number of activated CD4 + CCR5 + T cells that can support highly productive viral infection, making it advantageous for the virus to infect na\u00efve CD4 + CXCR4 + T cells, even though infection of these cells is less productive (reviewed in [14] ). However, CXCR4 viruses are rarely transmitted, probably because their between-host transmissibility is severely diminished, although a competing explanation for the lack of CXCR4 TF viruses is simply because they are uncommon in the donor population [15, 16] .",

It is hypothesised that heavy glycosylation evolves during the course of infection because it increases viral resistance to neutralising antibodies [18] , but is detrimental at the point of transmission because viruses are more easily trapped or inhibited by agents in the transmission fluid, and/or are more likely to be targeted by the innate immune system. Other characteristics of HIV-1 TF viruses include high densities of the Env protein compared to viruses circulating during later infection. This might increase infection of cells in the genital tract and enhance binding to dendritic cells, thereby enabling efficient transport of the virus from the genital tract to the gut (reviewed in [17] , although a recent study of transmission pairs gives more equivocal results [19] ).",

We make the assumption of no net growth since, after the first few weeks of infection, viral loads tend to remain approximately stable for the majority of the infection. After a period of time, T, the wild-type virus particles transmit to new hosts, with each virus particle in the germline enjoying a fraction t of the successful transmission enjoyed by those in the active compartment.

The first term represents the contribution of wild-type virus from the germline, and the second term is the contribution from the active compartment. The dynamics of the proportion p t of mutant particles in the active compartment, over the course of the infection, are given by dp t /dt = sp t (1-p t ) (see [94] 1)). Wild-type transmission success w is an appropriate measure of Darwinian fitness if the transmission ability of the mutant is sufficiently low that it does not completely displace the wild type from the wider population. This is because any mutant virus particles that do successfully transmit nevertheless enjoy zero long-term reproductive value [95] : owing to the assumed absence of back mutation, all virus particles ultimately derive from wildtype ancestry, and hence no mutant virus particle leaves any descendants in the long term. Accordingly, any transmission achieved by mutant virus particles does not contribute to an infection's fitness.",

Denoting the right-hand side of the condition t* yields a threshold level of germline transmission above which allocation to the germline is favoured, and below which it is not. Specifically, since the condition for increase is independent of the value of g, natural selection favours full investment into the germline when the condition is satisfied (g* = 1 when t > t*) and favours zero investment into the germline when the condition is not satisfied (g* = 0 when t < t*). The threshold level of germline transmission t* is a monotonically decreasing function of mutation rate m, mutant replicative advantage s, and believed to restrict cell entry of various viruses, including HIV-1 [1] . However, within the first 6 months of infection neutralising antibody responses select for specific escape mutations in HIV-1 Env that result in susceptibility to IFITMs [1] .

Although HBeAg is dispensable for ongoing infection, it is important for the establishment of immmunotolerance in neo/antenatal infections [22] .

The necessity to escape or avoid the host adaptive immune response can result in the accumulation of CTL and/or antibody escape mutations that are tailored to the specific host genotype, such as human leukocyte antigen (HLA) type. Whilst these mutations will be advantageous in the current individual, evidence suggests that antigenic escape in HIV-1, HCV, and HBV can have substantial fitness costs when measured in the absence of specific immune responses [25] [26] [27] . This can put viruses harbouring escape mutations at a disadvantage in hosts with different genotypes, potentially hindering transmission. This is supported by a number of findings. First, HIV-1 variants matching the population consensus are more likely to be transmitted, even if these variants are in a minority within the donor at the time of transmission [28] . Second, the rapid reversion of some CTL escape mutations if they infect HLA mismatched hosts [29] . Third, the frequency of CTL escape mutations that carry a large cost is proportional to the frequency of the corresponding HLA alleles in the host population, but CTL escape mutations with little or no cost tend to accumulate at the population level [30] .",

If these mutations also increase transmission they will rapidly spread throughout the viral population at the epidemiological level, as was observed during the 2014/15 West Africa Ebola outbreak [31] . However, within-host adaptive mutations can increase the pathogenicity (virulence) of viruses, and if this results in fewer potential transmission events then within-host viral adaptation will reduce overall rates of transmission (even if transmissibility per contact is increased). Perhaps the clearest example of this is found in bovine viral diarrhoea virus (BVDV), a pestivirus of cows. Although BVDV can cause acute infection when transmitted horizontally, persistent infection can be established only via vertical in utero transmission; persistently infected animals are thought to be essential for the maintenance of BVDV within a herd. Chronically infected cows typically exhibit mild symptoms, but within-host evolution can lead to the emergence of a cytopathic BVDV biotype that escapes viral control of the rate of within-host virus replication [32, 33] . This highly virulent form replicates quickly, leading to high viral loads, and is invariably fatal after a couple of weeks. Notably, cytopathic BVDV is incapable of establishing persistent infection, and therefore its emergence almost certainly limits the ability of BVDV to spread among hosts and it is generally regarded as an evolutionary dead-end [34] . A similar spontaneous emergence is thought to give rise to feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) in cats persistently infected with feline enteric coronavirus. In this case viral mutations enable FIPV to efficiently replicate in monocytic cells, resulting in systemic infection and very high mortality [35] [36] [37] .",

Although higher viral loads are correlated with higher rates of transmission, they are also linked to faster progression to AIDS [40, 41] and are therefore more pathogenic. It has been calculated that the number of onward transmissions during the course of an infection is maximised when viral load, and by implication viral replicative capacity, is intermediate [42, 43] . However, the predicted replicative capacity of HIV-1 in untreated patients tends to slowly increase during the course of infection [9] , presumably a consequence of withinhost competition. In other words, between-host evolution favours viruses with intermediate levels of virulence, but within-host evolution favours viruses with high levels of virulence. All else being equal, over the long term, within-host competition is expected to result in the evolution of highly pathogenic viruses at the host population level, even though these viruses will generate fewer onward transmissions than less pathogenic strains, a consequence of short-sighted evolution [43] .",

To persist at the epidemiological scale, we suggest that such viruses require life-history traits that avoid or reduce short-sighted evolution. These include traits resulting in a low rate of evolution across the whole within-host population, or a reduced rate in one or more subsets of the within-host viral population. We know very little about the within-host life history of most viruses, except those that infect humans, so it is not clear how many viruses fit into this category. It could be that chronic viruses with long transmission intervals are uncommon because few viruses are able to mitigate short-sighted evolution. Moreover, if life-history traits that ameliorate short-sighted evolution are partly under the control of the virus, then evolutionary theory predicts those traits should be under selection (see Box 1). Here, we describe potentially relevant life-history traits in four human chronic viruses with long transmission intervals [Human T-lymphotropic virus-1 (HTLV-1), HBV, HIV-1, and HCV].",

The majority of infections in endemic countries are through mother-to-child transmission via breast milk, resulting in a long transmission interval. As with all retroviruses, HTLV-1 uses an error-prone reverse transcriptase to generate complementary DNA (cDNA) from an RNA template, which is then integrated into the genome of the host cell, where it is referred to as provirus. Subsequently, however, the vast majority of viral reproduction is via mitotic division of proviral-containing host cells, leading to clonal expansion of the provirus. Since this uses the host cell polymerase to copy the provirus, error rates are extremely low, and within-host evolution comes to an almost standstill: the within-host rate of evolution of HIV-1, also a retrovirus, is in the order of 1.5\u00c210 \u00c02 [ 1 8 2 _ T D $ D I F F ] substitutions per site per year (s/s/yr) in the Env region of the genome [44] [45] [46] , whereas it is probably four orders of magnitude lower for HTLV-1 [47] .

However, the unique life cycle of hepadnaviruses results in long viral (cell-tocell) generation times even though chronic infection is productive, with infected cells producing 1 to 10 virions per day [49] . When a hepatocyte is infected with a hepadnavirus particle, viral relaxed circular DNA (RC-DNA) is transported to the nucleus of the cell where it is converted into covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA). This cccDNA then acts as a template for the production of more RC-DNA, via an RNA intermediate, which is either packaged into virions that are released from the host cell or, during early infection of the hepatocyte, are transported back into the nucleus to form more cccDNA [50] . During chronic infection, cccDNA is incredibly stable, with an estimated half-life for duck hepatitis B virus (DHBV) cccDNA of 33-57 days (reviewed in [51] ), giving a viral generation time around 20-40 days in ducks (and possibly much longer in humans). This leads to a rate of evolution 20-40 times slower than if the viral generation time were 1 day. As a result of this long generation time, and the compact nature of the HBV genome, which constrains its evolution, the within-host rate of HBV evolution is much slower (on the order 5\u00c210 \u00c05 s/s/yr [52] ) than would be expected given its high rate of spontaneous mutation. HCV, in comparison, has a within-host rate of evolution of about 1\u00c210 \u00c02 s/s/yr in the E1/E2 gene region [53] , with rates about five times lower in other gene regions [54] . Despite its slow rate of evolution, HBV is able to persist due to immunotolerance and/or immune exhaustion driven by excessive production of viral antigens (sAg and HBeAg) [55] .",

However, accumulating evidence suggests that minority viral populations persist within HIV-1-and HCV-infected hosts that have much lower rates of evolution. HIV-1 replication requires integration of virus into the genome of newly infected CD4 + T cells. A small proportion of these provirus-containing cells enter a long-lived resting phase with estimated half-lives ranging between $0.75 and $3.6 years [56] [57] [58] . It is these latently-infected resting CD4 + T cells that constitute the bulk of the HIV reservoir and which represent the major barrier to finding a true cure. The reservoir is established early in infection [59, 60] , and then maintained by newly infected cells entering the reservoir, and by the high-fidelity proliferation of cells within the reservoir [61, 62] . Consequently, a proportion of the provirus population in the reservoir is expected to be identical, or similar, to the virus(es) that initiated the infection [63, 64] ; a prediction supported by phylogenetic analysis [56, 65] . The latent reservoir is not visible to the host immune system, and therefore proviral populations originating from early infection are expected to avoid immune-mediated deletion. This is supported by a recent study of antiretroviral-treated patients that documented the persistence of a minority population of provirus, which had not accumulated CTL escape mutations in the reservoir of most patients despite robust CTL responses [66] . If within-host selection pressures are not too strong, reactivation of latently-infected cells is also expected to result in a minority RNA viral population resembling TF virus years after initial infection [63, 64, 67] . Variation in the rate of evolution along different branches of within-host HIV-1 phylogenies (which exclude viruses in the reservoir) provides support for this [44, 68] , although the short sequence lengths used to generate these phylogenies currently makes it difficult assess the importance of this process.",

Extra-hepatic replication of HCV remains controversial, not least because the HCV life cycle is seemingly intrinsically linked to liver biology [69] . Nonetheless, numerous studies suggest limited genome replication in neurological tissue, gastrointestinal cells, and B-lymphocytes [70] [71] [72] [73] [74] . Moreover, genetic analysis of virus isolated from hepatocytes, plasma, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from the same patients has shown that virus in PBMCs typically represents a distinct subpopulation (discussed in [53] ), and recent work has shown that HCV infecting B cells shows tropism for lymphocytes rather than hepatocytes, indicating the presence of subpopulations specialised on infecting B cells [73] . Among the PBMC types it has been suggested that longlived memory B cells are primarily infected, with these infected cells avoiding host antiviral immune responses [74] . These factors will potentially increase the viral generation time of extrahepatic lineages and provide a way of maintaining a compartment of slowly evolving viruses that do not undergo extensive within-host adaptation.",

We call these 'founder-like' populations because they will be genetically similar to the TF virus(es). For chronic viruses with slow rates of within-host evolution, such as HTLV-1 and HBV, the entire within-host population will be founder-like, and therefore transmitted viruses will be representative of the viruses present in the donor at the time of transmission. However, for chronic viruses with fast rates of within-host evolution, such as HIV-1 and HCV, this leads to the expectation that viral subpopulations that have experienced low rates of within-host evolution will be more likely to be transmitted ( Figure 2 ). We draw an analogy between these subpopulations and the germline in most animals, and possibly also in plants [75] . For both HIV-1 and HCV, transmission is relatively inefficient, with only one or a few viral strains transmitted between hosts [76] [77] [78] , and studies of both HIV-1 and HCV have revealed that TF viruses are often under-represented in donor viral populations [1, 19, 79] . This has led to the suggestion that, for these rapidly evolving viruses at least, the majority of virions circulating in an individual are adapted to the within-host environment, but are poorly adapted for transmission between hosts.",

Another mechanism likely to contribute to this mismatch in rates is 'adapt-and-revert', whereby hostspecific adaptations accumulate in one host, only to be lost in the next host [82, 83] . However, this is unlikely to be the primary mechanism since it will only result in a mismatch at sites under selection, whereas the mismatch in evolutionary rates is seen for both synonymous and nonsynonymous mutations [67, 84, 85] , and across the whole genome [46] . Saturation effects might also contribute [86] . However, because the mismatch can be observed over short transmission chains [80] , whereas saturation effects are expected to accumulate over longer timescales, the transmission of germline lineages remains the most likely primary mechanism.",

As with HIV-1, this implicates the transmission of less-evolved virus, rather than a process of adaptation and reversion, as the primary mechanism leading to the mismatch in evolutionary rates. Finally, a mismatch also appears to exist for HIV-2 [87, 88] , although the relative rates of synonymous and nonsynonymous mutations have not been measured.

Two studies of HIV-1 discordant couples from Rakai, Uganda, found evidence for the preferential transmission of more founder-like virus [89, 90] . Furthermore, a study of 137 linked transmission pairs from Zambia concluded that viruses within a donor are more likely to be transmitted if their genomes more closely resemble viral genomes circulating in Time Evolu\u019fonary distance vertical lines) , within-host rates of viral evolution can be extremely rapid, indicated by increasing evolutionary distance as time progresses. If there is heterogeneity in the rates of evolution among different within-host viral lineages, and if more slowly evolving lineages are more likely to be transmitted because they contain fewer transmissionreducing mutations, the rate of evolution of the virus at the between-host level will be slower than the rate of evolution measured at the within-host level (indicated by the red line). These slowly evolving lineages can be considered the viral germline.",

Since it is unethical to enrol patients into a study without offering treatment, suitable pairs must be searched for retrospectively in the sample archives of earlier studies.",

Moreover, we speculate that the mechanisms for maintaining proposed germline lineages in viral populations could themselves be under selection (Box 1).",

All six of these chronic viruses have long transmission intervals, ranging from years to decades, and three of them (HTLV-1, HTLV-2, and HBV) have life history traits that result in slower rates of within-host evolution than would be expected given their high mutation rates during replication. The other three (HIV-1, HIV-2, and HCV) have fast rates of within-host evolution, but may bypass shortsighted evolution through the maintenance and preferential transmission of a subpopulation of viruses that retain the transmissibility of the TF virus that initiated the infection (a 'germline' lineage).",

            "text": "An important factor that influences the potential impact of short-sighted evolution is the transmission interval, or more specifically, the number of viral generations between the time of infection and the average time of onward transmission. This will depend on a number of variables, including the mode of transmission, host behaviour and life-history traits, and viral generation time. The potential for short-sighted evolution could therefore explain why some families of chronic viruses persist in some host species, but not others. For example, arenaviruses and hantaviruses cause chronic infections in rodents and are endemic in these populations, but not in human populations. This might be because transmission intervals are likely to be shorter in rodents, limiting the amount of short-sighted evolution that can accrue between transmission events. Similarly, pestiviruses might be able to persist at the host population level in livestock (despite occasional host death due to within-host viral evolution) but not in humans, because the mother-to-child transmission interval in humans would be much longer. Whether this is a general pattern is unknown; longitudinal sampling of individual animals to determine whether infections are acute, persistent and/or chronic is extremely challenging, particularly in wild populations [93] , and in itself should become a research priority, not least because many of these potentially zoonotic infections are highly pathogenic in humans.",

Factors Favouring the Evolution of a Viral Germline. Our mathematical model predicts that allocation of viral particles to a nonreplicating germline is favoured by natural selection if the relative transmission success t of wild-type virus in the germline exceeds a threshold value t* describing the threat imposed by mutation. Specifically, increased [ 1 7 1 _ T D $ D I F F ] time to transmission (T), mutation rate (m), and replicative advantage of the mutant genotype (s) is associated with increased likelihood of the germline being favoured (lower t*).",
