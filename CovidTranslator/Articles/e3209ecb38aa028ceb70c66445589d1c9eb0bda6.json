            "text": "Hantaviruses are the causative agents of HFRS and HCPS (hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome and hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome), two severe, and often fatal human diseases. Mortality from HFRS varies between hantaviruses; Hantaan and Dobrava show the highest, Seoul intermediate, and Puumala low mortality. Saaremaa, genetically closely related to Dobrava, is also known to induce HFRS, with low or no mortality. In this study, mice were inoculated with Dobrava and Saaremaa viruses to test for infectibility, lethality, viremia, nitric oxide production and antibody responses. Out of suckling mice intracerebrally inoculated with 50, 500 and 5000 focus-forming units of Dobrava virus, respectively, 1/8, 2/8 and 7/8 died within 18e26 days. In all but one of the lethally infected mice high levels of replicating virus were detected, and most were positive for neutralizing antibodies and showed elevated levels of nitric oxide production. All suckling mice intracerebrally inoculated with 50, 500, or 5000 focus-forming units of Saaremaa virus survived and all seroconverted. Clearly lower viral titers were observed for the Saaremaa virus-inoculated mice, also when sacrificed at day 18 after infection, compared to those in mice that died following Dobrava virus infection. Dobrava, Saaremaa, Puumala and Hantaan virus infections of adult mice were asymptomatic, and the anti-nucleocapsid protein IgG2a/IgG1-titer ratio was higher in mice inoculated with Dobrava virus than in those inoculated with Saaremaa virus. Elevated nitric oxide production was not detected in asymptomatically infected mice, and iNOS\u00ff/\u00ff mice, like normal mice, cleared viremia. In conclusion, we show that Dobrava virus and Saaremaa virus induce distinct differences in terms of survival, viremia, nitric oxide production and antibody responses in mice.",

Interestingly, there seem to be clear differences in terms of pathogenicity for humans after DOBV and SAAV infections. The most severe HFRS cases, with high fatality rates, have been reported from the Balkans, where DOBV is dominant [7e9] . In contrast, in parts of Europe where SAAV dominates, no fatalities associated with DOBV-like viruses have been registered [2,10e13] . One prominent example is the large DOBV-like associated outbreak in central Russia in 1991e1992, when 130 HFRS patients were hospitalised, but no fatal cases occurred [10] . Taken together, those reports suggest that SAAV induces a disease more similar to PUUV than to DOBV infection [2] .",

Hantavirus infection per se does not directly damage endothelial cells in vitro [15] , and specific immune responses are present at the onset of the symptomatic phase of the disease. In SNV-infected patients there is a correlation between a high frequency of SNV-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes and severe disease, and these cytotoxic T lymphocytes are suggested to contribute to the disease [16] . Furthermore, histological studies of postmortem tissues show blood mononuclear cell infiltration that might play a role in functional organ failure [17e19]. Elevated levels of cytokines like IL-6, IL-10 and TNF-a have been reported, and elevated production of the free radical nitric oxide (NO) has been detected in hantavirus infected patients [20e22] , as well as in monkeys infected with PUUV [23] , indicating that it may contribute to hantavirus pathogenesis [22] . SNV infection of deer mice, the natural host, does not induce elevated NO production [22] . NO is known to contribute to the pathogenesis of certain virus infections in mice, like influenza virus [24] and neurotropic viruses [25] , but NO is also known to have antiviral effects against some viruses, including ectromelia virus (mousepox), coxsackievirus, herpesviruses and SARS coronavirus [26, 27] .",

We indirectly measured the levels of NO in the brains of the suckling mice by measuring the level of nitrite, after conversion of nitrate to nitrite. In this experiment, we also included a group of suckling mice inoculated with inactivated DOBV (corresponding to 5000 FFU) that was sacrificed at day 18 after inoculation, as control. Similar mean values of nitrite were detected in all groups, except in the group of suckling mice that died following DOBV infection (Table 4 ). Significant differences between the mean levels of NO in the groups were found (KruskaleWallis test, P \u00bc 0.014). High levels of nitrite were only detected in the DOBV-infected mice that died following infection with 5000 FFU of DOBV, but not in those that died after infection with 50 or 500 FFU of DOBV (Fig. 1) , suggesting that the NO production was dose-dependent, or that the levels in the other lethally infected mice had returned to normal before they died.",

All mice inoculated with 8000 FFU of DOBV died (Fig. 2) . To evaluate if a higher dose of SAAV would be lethal, undiluted SAAV (corresponding to 10,000 FFU) was inoculated into eight mice; however, none of the mice died or showed any symptoms (Fig. 2) , clearly showing that SAAV was not lethal for suckling mice. PUUV esc-5A2 (20,000 FFU) and PUUV Kazan-wt (200 bank vole ID 50 ) were inoculated into eight mice per group, and five mice were inoculated with PUUV Sot (5000 FFU). None of the mice inoculated with PUUV died, or showed any symptoms within 23e25 days after inoculation (Fig. 2) . The same pattern was seen for TOPV and TULV: of eight mice inoculated with undiluted TOPV (900 FFU) or TULV (1,800 FFU) none died or showed any symptoms within 23 and 36 days after inoculation, respectively (Fig. 2) .

            "text": "This study was undertaken to investigate the potential differences in terms of lethality, viremia, and immune responses in mice after infection with two genetically similar, but distinct, hantaviruses, DOBV and SAAV. Adult laboratory mice have experimentally been infected with ANDV [33] , SNV [33] , HTNV [32] , SEOV [56] , SAAV [28] , and DOBV [28] . In contrast to the general lack of symptoms and lethality observed in adult mice, inoculation of suckling mice with HTNV and SEOV has been reported to be lethal in several studies [30,31,47,56e61] , although no symptoms resembling human infection have been reported. In suckling mice, neuropathological symptoms are prominent, and the disease pathogenesis mechanism has been suggested to be immune mediated [60] . However, in contrast to human patients, no evidence of dysfunction in any other organ, except the brain, has been described for suckling mice, suggesting that failure of other organs is not instrumental in the fatal outcome. In this study, all but one of the mice that died following DOBV inoculation showed evidence of replicating virus or neutralizing antibodies, and all but one were negative for N-specific IgG responses. This indicates that they died rather early after a specific immune response was mounted. The level of lethality, as well as time to death, correlated with the amount of DOBV given: the more the virus, the higher the degree of lethality. However, although all mice in the group given 5000 FFU of DOBV were infected, the pattern observed for lethality was not observed for infection, as approximately half of the mice in both of the groups given 50 or 500 FFU became infected. For SAAV, all inoculated mice seroconverted, showing that all were infected, and replicating virus or viral RNA could also be detected in most of the mice at the time of sacrifice (day 34 after infection). When suckling mice inoculated with 5000 FFU of SAAV were sacrificed at day 18 after infection, higher virus titers were detected as compared to day 34; however, the titers were at least 50% lower than for the mice inoculated with DOBV that died between days 18 and 20. Thus, it seems that a low dose of SAAV can more readily infect suckling mice than DOBV, while DOBV replicates to higher titers after a successful infection. The data further indicate that some mice were not successfully infected by DOBV, as evident by the lack of replicating virus, viral RNA and specific antibody responses.",

We therefore measured the level of NO in the brains of SAAV and DOBV-inoculated mice. As NO is very short-lived, we measured the level of the stable end products of NO, nitrite and nitrate (nitrate was converted to nitrite by reductase). Interestingly, only mice that died following DOBV inoculation showed elevated levels of nitrite as compared to all other groups, including mice inoculated with 5000 FFU of SAAV and sacrificed at day 18 after infection. However, the highest level of nitrate was detected in mice given 5000 FFU of DOBV, the three mice that died following infection with 500 or 50 FFU of DOBV showed similar levels of nitrite as controls, suggesting that the peak of NO production occurs before or around day 18, or that NO production was not increased in those mice.",

It was recently shown that SNV infection of the natural host (the deer mice), does not induce elevated levels of NO production [22] . In line with the results of Davis et al. we could not detect systemically elevated NO levels in adult mice asymptomatically infected with HTNV. Furthermore, no replicating virus was detected in iNOS\u00ff/\u00ff mice 3 weeks after HTNV infection, suggesting that virus clearance in mice is not dependent on NO. Moreover, as elevated levels of NO were only detected in suckling mice that succumbed to DOBV infection, and not in any asymptomatically infected suckling or adult mice, our results are in line with the reports of elevated levels of NO production in HFRS/HCPS-patients [20e22], indicating that NO may be involved in hantavirus pathogenesis and that the increased NO production is caused by the immune response, and not by the virus per se. However, the possible role of NO in hantavirus pathogenesis in man, and the mechanisms leading to elevated levels of NO, remain to be shown.",

There is an intriguing connection between the Th-type of immune response and iNOS, the enzyme that produces the vast majority of NO during viral infection. During Th1-type immune responses IFN-g is produced, which leads to the induction of iNOS, whereas a Th2-type of immune response down-regulates iNOS induction [62] . If suckling mice also mount a stronger Th1-type of immune response against DOBV than SAAV, this might explain why they showed elevated levels of NO production.",
