We conducted a review of the literature to evaluate the processes and procedures utilized for safe AE high-level containment transport (AE-HLCT) of patients with HHCDs. Methods: A literature search was performed in PubMed/MEDLINE (from 1966 through January 2019). Authors screened abstracts for inclusion criteria and full articles were reviewed if the abstract was deemed to contain information related to the aim. Results: Our search criteria yielded 14 publications and were separated based upon publication dates, with the natural break point being the beginning of the 2013-2016 Ebola virus disease epidemic. Best practices and recommendations from identified articles are subdivided into pre-flight preparations, inflight operations, and post-flight procedures. Conclusions: Limited peer-reviewed literature exists on AE-HLCT, including important aspects related to healthcare worker fatigue, alertness, shift scheduling, and clinical care performance. This hinders the sharing of best practices to inform evacuations and equip teams for future outbreaks. Despite the successful use of different aircraft and technologies, the unique nature of the mission opens the opportunity for greater coordination and development of consensus standards for AE-HLCT operations.",

Some evacuation procedures were preestablished and drilled, whereas others were based on situational needs. AE HLCT has increased since it was introduced in the 1970s, but no literature review comparing approaches has been published.

Lotz and Raffin 20 indicated their transport met recommendations set by the World Health Organization for medical evacuation of patients with high infectious risk (36-48 hours). Thoms et al 2 noted that \". . . U.S. military policy is to treat highly infectious patients 'in place', and avoid unnecessary evacuation to the U.S.\" but acknowledged instances in which transport would occur, such as index cases or for political considerations. Given the current emphasis on military participation in nation-building efforts, it is unlikely that adequate resources for \"treatment in place\" will be present during future outbreaks. As such, the military may become increasingly reliant on AE HLCTs.",

Zone designation lends the ability to transport multiple patients at different stages of disease progression for the same disease or, more likely, to transport both suspected and confirmed patients. In the 1974 air medical transportation of a Lassa fever patient from Nigeria to Germany, the following zones were established: a containment zone where the patient was located, a crew zone where PPE was not worn, and a neutral zone between the 2 that was also available for plane-related emergency procedures. 25 Withers and Christopher 9,10 stated that military \"flight nurses know that cabin airflow is 'top to bottom, front to back' on the C-9A Nightingale; therefore, contagious patients are placed as far aft and as low as possible.\" Withers and Christopher 9,10 also noted particular considerations (eg, high-efficiency particulate air systems, air exchanges/hour, and negative pressure zones) are made on the ventilation systems within each aircraft for potential dispersion of aerosolized microbes from a contagious patient that is either uncontained in an isolation unit or may have been unknowingly contagious.",

This combination reduces loading time and the likelihood of aircraft contamination. The British military uses a dedicated road transport vehicle for the T-ATI positioned at the receiving air base for seamless transport to the destination facility. 19 A major limitation of transport systems was the inability to house multiple patients. Newer systems currently in validation seek to alleviate this limitation. The Transport Isolation System is a DoD containment modality designed and approved for loading onto C-17 and C-130 military aircraft; each system (aluminum frame with clear plastic liner that maintains a negative pressure isolation environment) is capable of moving multiple patients simultaneously, and 2 such systems can be accommodated on the larger C-17 platform. The Containerized Bio-Containment System is a US State Department\u2212sponsored platform similar to a hard-sided shipping container with viewing ports and a negative-pressure isolation environment. It has the capability to transport 4 patients simultaneously with space for multiple caregivers and is designed to be loaded onto the C-17 (not yet approved by the US Air Force) or the Boeing 747 airframe. 29, 30 Procedures/Capabilities In-flight Care provided during AE HLCTs will not be equivalent to that available at a dedicated health care facility. However, several articles detailed the ability to provide a wide range of medical procedures in-flight (eg, endotracheal incubation and defibrillation) 2, 6, 18, 19 ; other articles implied in-flight procedures were limited to monitoring. 5 The type of isolation unit limits capabilities in-flight; for example, the HSTI-TCOL detailed in the study by Dindart et al 5 is a sealed pod and enables only limited interventions (eg, intravenous rehydration and antiemetics).",

AE HLCT systems advancement with increased space and ability to perform care within the unit enables more advanced patient care procedures than available in single-patient isolation. However, with the improved capability for in-flight care, discussions are needed on what medical procedures should be conducted in-flight, focusing on minimizing aerosol generation.

Marklund, Written communication, December 2017). Clayton, 23 using a Canadian system similar to USAMRIID's, further advocated medical crew knowledge on patient management and care techniques, hypobaric medicine, and equipment familiarization. Schilling et al 21 discussed the importance of PPE training and detailed the timing of Italy's Aeromedical Isolation Team trainings, indicating military portions of their team are trained every 15 days. Likewise, Nicol et al 19 noted that the UK's Royal Air Force Deployable Air Isolator Team convenes monthly for retraining on PPE and the patient isolator used for transports. A study by Lamb,",
