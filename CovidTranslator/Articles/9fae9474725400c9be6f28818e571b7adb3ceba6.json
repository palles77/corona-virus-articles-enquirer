Viral entry/infection is initiated by binding of glycoprotein GP protein on Ebola virion to host cells, followed by fusion of virus-cell membrane also mediated by GP. Using an human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-based pseudotyping system, the roles of 41 Ebola GP1 residues in the receptor-binding domain in viral entry were studied by alanine scanning substitutions. We identified that four residues appear to be involved in protein folding/structure and four residues are important for viral entry. An improved entry interference assay was developed and used to study the role of these residues that are important for viral entry. It was found that R64 and K95 are involved in receptor binding. In contrast, some residues such as I170 are important for viral entry, but do not play a major role in receptor binding as indicated by entry interference assay and/or protein binding data, suggesting that these residues are involved in post-binding steps of viral entry. Furthermore, our results also suggested that Ebola and Marburg viruses share a common cellular molecule for entry.",

In contrast, entry of Ebola GP pseudovirions was decreased dramatically in cells expressing either \u0394mucin or GP mutants (Fig. 4B) (Fig. 4C) . Furthermore, the overall inhibitory profile of viral entry mediated by Marburg GP was highly similar to that by Ebola GP. Two mutants (R64A and K95A), which were impaired in inhibiting viral entry mediated by Ebola GP, were also less effective in inhibiting viral entry mediated by Marburg GP. These results substantiate the notion that Ebola and Marburg viruses share a common receptor/co-receptor for viral entry. These results further strengthen the argument that R64 and K95 are involved in direct interaction with the cellular receptor.",

In this report, we improved the effectiveness (>90% inhibition of viral entry) and consistency using a retroviral vector to express GP protein in cells. It was shown that two alanine substitutions on \u0394mucin Ebola GP (R64A and K95A) were less efficient in inhibiting Ebola GP-mediated viral entry (31% and 18%) compared to wt (7%). This is consistent with the cell surface binding data. In were defective in inhibiting both Ebola and Marburg GP entry (Fig. 4 B and C) . Third, purified fusion proteins containing the Ebola RBD can block Marburg GP-mediated viral entry and vice versa [17] . In addition, small molecule compounds and their derivatives inhibited both Ebola and Marburg GP mediated viral entry while they displayed no effect on the VSV-G mediated entry [2, 51] .

This specific inhibition is consistent with the notion that virus envelope protein expressed in target cells interacts with its cognate receptor(s) and interferes with the reinfection by the viruses using the same receptor(s). However, this entry interference assay is not highly efficient (about 60% inhibition) and variable due to unreliable transfection efficiency(60%-80% of cells are transfected, depending on experiments). Here we developed a more efficient interference assay by stably expressing Ebola GP in the target cells using a retrovirus-based transduction. Briefly, to maximize the number of cells expressing the gene of interest, a pilot experiment was carried out to transduce 293T cells by a replication-defective HIV vector carrying GFP as the reporter. As shown in Fig. 3A, the number of GFP positive cells increased as more virions were used in transduction. Approximately 99%-100% cells expressed GFP when 1-3 mL of virions were used. This protocol gives virtually 100% of transduction efficiency compared to the previous transient transfection protocol. To develop an interference assay for Ebola GP-mediated viral entry, the \u0394mucin Ebola GP were challenged by the HIV-luc virions carrying either VSV-G or Ebola GP. As controls, the same VSV-G or Ebola GP pseudotyped HIV virions were incubated with the target cells expressing GFP (by transduction). As shown in Fig. 3B, expression of \u0394mucin Ebola GP in target cells displayed some effect on VSV-G mediated viral entry. This effect was likely due to the cytotoxicity by increasing the amount of viruses used in transducing the \u0394mucin construct into target cells, since the same trend was observed for the cells expressing GFP (by transduction with the HIV-GFP construct) which were then challenged by VSV-G or Ebola GP pseudotyped virions. In contrast, expression of \u0394mucin Ebola GP in target cells could interfere with Ebola GP-mediated viral entry up to 95%. Thus we have developed a more reliable and efficient interference assay for Ebola GP-mediated viral entry. This improved entry interference assay was used to examine 12 substitution mutants of interest identified in this study and our previous work. These mutant GP genes were introduced to the target cells (293T) by transduction, and all of them were expressed at similar levels (Fig. 4A). The cells expressing these different mutants were challenged by either wt Ebola GP or VSV-G pseudotyped virus. In this experiment, the target cells expressing puromycin-resistant gene (puro)or GFP gene were used as controls. Entry of pseudotyped virus into puro and GFP-expressing cells was",

Our results showed that only 8 residues are critical for protein structure and viral entry function while alanine substitution of other 33 residues did not have major effect. Four residues (V52, V66, F160, and V181) appear to be important for protein expression/folding, and four residues (T42, T60, N61, and V79) are critical for viral entry. Furthermore, the role of several GP residues which displayed moderate effects by single amino acid substitution was investigated by double substitutions. It was found that four residues (L43, R54, K56, and N61) were important for viral entry. Using an improved viral entry interference assay and cell surface binding assay, we demonstrated that two residues (R64 and K95) are directly involved in receptor binding. In contrast, I170 is not defective in receptor-binding, suggesting a role in the postbinding step during viral entry.

These 10 residues are critical for viral entry, but not important for entry interference, suggesting some of them might be involved in the post-binding steps of viral entry. In addition, I170A is defective in mediating viral entry, but not impaired in receptor binding or entry interference, thus we conclude that I170 is important in the post-binding steps in viral entry. Several pieces of evidence suggest that Ebola and Marburg viruses share a common cellular factor(s) for viral entry. First, conservation of protein sequence suggests that RBD of Ebola and Marburg GP might adopt a similar structure: 68% (32 of 47) of the residues that are important for protein structure or viral entry are conserved in both. Second, it has been shown by an entry interference assay that expression of Ebola or Marburg GP inhibited entry of each other.
