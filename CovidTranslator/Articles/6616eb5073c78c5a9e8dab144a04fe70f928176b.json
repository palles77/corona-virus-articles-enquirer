            "text": "Fourteen infectious bronchitis viruses (IBVs) were isolated in Korea between 2001 and 2003 from chickens suspected to be infected with IBVs. The nucleocapsid (N) protein genes of the various IBVs were amplified by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and were cloned and sequenced, and the nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences were compared with published sequences for non-Korean IBV strains. The Korean IBV isolates shared amino acid sequence similarity of between 89.2% (K203-02 and K1255-03) and 98.3% (K434-01 and K281-01) with each other and exhibited amino acid sequence similarity between 57.0% (K774-01 and V18/91) and 96.6% (K507-01 and JP8147) with non-Korean IBV strains. Phylogenetic analysis of the deduced N protein amino acid sequences resulted in the segregation of Korean IBV isolates into three different clusters, with cluster assignments differing for some of the isolates from those obtained with analysis of the S1 glycoprotein. and K234-02 formed an independent cluster comprised only of Korean IBV isolates. Another Korean IBV isolate, K210-02, belonged to a cluster that included IBV strains isolated in USA, the Netherlands and China. Recent Korean IBV isolates K514-03 and K1255-03 grouped into a third distinct cluster related to a Chinese IBV strain. As deduced from phylogenetic analysis, some IBV isolates appear to have arisen from the recombination of IBV strains with different origins.",

The genome of IBV consists of a single-stranded sense RNA genome approximately 27 kb in length [2] . IBV encodes four structural proteins, which are the spike (S) glycoprotein, the membrane (M) glycoprotein, the envelope (E) glycoprotein, and the nucleocapsid (N) protein [3] . The S glycoprotein of IBV is post-translationally cleaved into N-terminal S1 and C-terminal S2 subunits [3] . The S1 subunit carries neutralizing epitopes and cell attachment determinants, and traditional vaccines have targeted the S1 glycoprotein [4] . The N protein is associated with the genome, and it plays an important role in viral replication, assembly, and immunity [5, 6] . Recent evidence indicates that the N protein could, in addition to S1 glycoprotein, represent an important target in the prevention of IB outbreaks.",

Boots et al. [27] reported a MHC class II-restricted T-cell hybridoma that recognized the N protein of IBV, which showed markedly variable responses to 12 different strains of IBV. These data indicate that T lymphocytes constitute another important element in the control of IBV infection in poultry. In conclusion, we recommend that an indigenous IBV strain should be a first candidate when a new vaccine is developed in the future.",
