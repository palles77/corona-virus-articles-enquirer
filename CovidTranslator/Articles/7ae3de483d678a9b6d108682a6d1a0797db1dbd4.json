Then, female BALB/c mice were immunized with the purified recombinant N protein and one strain of hybridoma cells named 2B8 secreting anti-N protein monoclonal antibodies (MAb) was obtained by hybridoma technique. The MAb was specifically reacted with PEDV and identified by Western blot and indirect immunofluorescence assays. This work indicated that the MAb would be a valuable tool as a specific diagnostic reagent for PEDV epidemiological surveys and diagnosis in the future.",

(1) (2) (3) (4) (5) PEDV was first reported in Belgium and the United Kingdom in 1978, (1) and then was detected in Hungary, Italy, China, Japan, Thailand, the United States, and South Korea. (2, (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) Since late 2010, a variant PEDV outbreak occurred in China and has caused a huge economic loss to the swine industry. (3, 4, 10) In 2013, the variant virus outbreak also occurred in the United States. (11) Recently, PEDV has been a serious causative agent resulting in piglet mortality in China and the United States. (12) (13) (14) Belonging to the Coronaviridae family in the Nidovirale order, PEDV is an enveloped virus with a single-stranded positive-sense RNA genome that is approximately 28 kb and encodes four structural proteins: spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N), and three non-structural proteins, replicases 1a and 1b and ORF3. (4, 10) PEDV N protein, which provides a structural basis for the helical nucleocapsid, is a basic phosphoprotein associated with the genome. (15, 16) Therefore, it can be used as a target for the accurate and early diagnosis of PEDV infection. (16) In order to facilitate the study of the differential diagnosis of PEDV, the recombinant PEDV N protein was expressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3), and an anti-N protein MAb was obtained by hybridoma technique. The MAb was reacted with PEDV identified by Western blot and immunofluorescence assays (IFA), and is useful for detecting PEDV N protein.",

The variant PEDV was reported in China and the United States (3, 4, 10, 11) and has become a serious causative agent of death among piglets in these countries. PEDV N protein is a phosphorylated nucleocapsid protein binding to the genomic RNA, which can be used as a target for the accurate and early diagnosis of PEDV infection. (16) In this study, the N gene of PEDV was expressed bacterially for generation of MAbs against N protein of PEDV. A high level of antibody induced by the purified rN protein was detected using indirect ELISA in immunized mice. Following hybridoma technique, an MAb (2B8) against N protein of PEDV was generated and identified by Western blot and IFA. The results showed that MAb 2B8 can be used as a diagnostic reagent for detecting PEDV.",
