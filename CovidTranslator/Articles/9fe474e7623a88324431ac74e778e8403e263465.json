[1] [2] [3] [4] There are four main groups of pattern recognition receptors, ie, Toll-like receptors, NOD-like receptors, C-type lectin receptors, and RIG-I-like receptors, and genes encoding them are broadly expressed, eg, in epithelial cells, endothelial cells, keratinocytes, lymphocytes, granulocytes, fibroblasts, and neurons. [1] [2] [3] [4] A summary of the most modern conceptual data about members of these groups and about their structure and function can be obtained from recent comprehensive reviews by Kawai and Akira, 1 Elinav et al, 2 Osorio et al, 3 and Loo and Gale. 4 The completion of the human genome project and widespread distribution of genotyping technologies have led to an enormous number of studies devoted to associating inherited gene polymorphisms with various diseases. Single nucleotide polymorphisms may result in amino acid substitutions altering protein function or splicing, and they can also change the structure of enhancer sequences during splicing 5 and affect mRNA stability. 6 Single nucleotide polymorphisms may alter transcription factor binding motifs, change the efficacy of enhancer or repressor elements, 7 and alter the structure of translation initiation codons that may lead to downregulation of wild-type transcripts. 8 Gene polymorphisms located in leucine-rich repeats constituting ectodomains of many pattern recognition receptors may affect the ability of these receptors to bind pathogens they normally recognize, 9 single nucleotide polymorphisms in transmembrane domains can lead to defects of intracellular receptor transport that prevent receptors localizing to the cell membrane, 10 and, finally, polymorphisms in the cytosolic domains may result in altered interactions with adaptor proteins or in disrupted receptor dimerization. Therefore, there are many avenues by which single nucleotide polymorphisms may alter pattern recognition receptor expression and activity. Because pattern recognition receptors recognize a number of oncogenic infectious agents and launch an immune response against them, inherited variation in their structure may modulate cancer risk and, possibly, influence cancer progression. In addition, pattern recognition receptors bind a lot of endogenous ligands, 1-4 so polymorphisms of genes encoding them can affect risk and/or progression of some autoimmune disorders and, consequently, cancer risk and/or progression, given that there is a fundamental and epidemiological association between many autoimmune diseases and cancer risk.",

This can be explained by the fact that the first wave of studies devoted to the association of polymorphisms of genes encoding Toll-like receptors and NOD-like receptors with cancer risk appeared only in 2004, and the number of such papers was relatively small until 2008. In addition, known hypotheses about the infectious agents causing human cancer and their recognition by pattern recognition receptors suggested that Toll-like receptors and NOD-like receptors should play a major role in the immune response against biological carcinogens. However, more recent findings concerning specific potentially carcinogenic ligands of C-type lectin receptors and RIG-I-like receptors were only obtained in the last few years, 3,4 so there has not been enough time as yet to conduct comprehensive investigations between single nucleotide polymorphisms of genes encoding C-type lectin receptors and RIG-I-like receptors and cancer risk.",

            "text": "For instance, it was suggested that variant alleles of MRC1 rs2477637, rs2253120, rs2477664, rs692527, rs1926736, and rs691005 gene polymorphisms are associated with development of asthma 13 (eg, variant A allele of rs1926736 was connected with decreased asthma risk). In addition, Alter et al 14 found that the variant A allele (S396) of rs1926736 (G396S) polymorphism is associated with a lower leprosy risk and, conversely, G allele (G396) correlates with increased risk of this disease. Interestingly, G396 did not influence leprosy risk in combination with T399 and L407 (amino acids resulting from variant alleles of rs2478577 and rs2437257, respectively). 14 The authors noted that all three of these MRC1 gene single nucleotide polymorphisms map to the second C-type lectin domain (CTLD2) of the MRC1 protein, with their in vitro results suggesting that a direct interaction between CTLD2 and an accessory receptor molecule is necessary in order for microbial ligand recognition to occur. 14 It is logical to propose that such interaction would be sensitive to G396 only in the context of the A399-F407 haplotype, and not in the context of the T399-L407 haplotype. 14 Thus, rs1926736 may have substantial functional consequences at the molecular level, but this depends on its relationship with other single nucleotide polymorphisms in the same exon. Finally, Hattori et al 15 showed that a variant allele of rs691005 polymorphism, located within the 3\u2032 untranslated region of the MRC1 gene, is associated with a higher risk of sarcoidosis. Because of its location, it is feasible that this single nucleotide polymorphism may alter the regulatory binding sequence and influence mRNA expression. 15 The only study investigating the association of polymorphisms of genes encoding C-type lectin receptors and RIG-I-like receptors with cancer risk is a study by Xu et al. 16 They investigated single nucleotide polymorphisms of the CD209 gene and found that the GG genotype of the rs2287886, AA genotype of the \u2212939 promoter polymorphism, and the G allele of the rs735239 single nucleotide polymorphism were connected with higher nasopharyngeal carcinoma risk. 16 Polymorphisms in the promoter of the CD209 gene and in the CD209 gene were also associated with hemorrhage in patients with dengue fever (G allele of rs4804803), 17,18 modulated tuberculosis risk (G allele of rs4804803, A allele of rs735239), [19] [20] [21] higher celiac disease risk in HLA-DQ2-negative cases (G allele of rs4804803), 22 increased ulcerative colitis risk in HLA-DR3-positive patients (G allele of rs4804803), 23 higher susceptibility to cytomegalovirus infection (G allele of rs735240 and C allele of rs2287886), 24 protection from lung cavitation 20 and fever during tuberculosis 25 (GG genotype and G allele of rs4804803), decreased HIV-1 infection risk (GG genotype of rs4804803), 21 accelerated progression to acquired immune deficiency syndrome in HIV-1-infected hemophiliacs (C allele of rs2287886), 26 decreased human T-lymphotropic virus type I infection risk (G allele of rs4804803, A allele of rs2287886), 27 increased severity of liver disease during hepatitis C virus infection (G allele of rs4804803), 28 and better prognosis following severe acute respiratory syndrome (G allele of rs4804803). 29, 30 It was shown that the A allele of the rs4804803 single nucleotide polymorphism may increase gene expression in vitro, 17 expression in subjects with the G allele may result in an impaired immune response against hepatitis C virus, 28 M. tuberculosis, 19, 21 and bacteria potentially causing celiac disease 22 and ulcerative colitis, 23 that elevates the risk of diseases caused by these infectious agents. Such a decreased immune response may protect from hemorrhage during dengue fever, 17 from lung cavitation, 20 from fever during tuberculosis, 25 and from lung injury during severe acute respiratory syndrome 29,30 as a result of less cytokine production and diminished activation of immune cells. However, from the point of view of Vannberg et al, 20 conversely, lower CD209 gene expression as a consequence of G allele of rs4804803 polymorphism may protect against tuberculosis because of decreased production of proinflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-4. Further fundamental, translational, and clinical studies are necessary to clarify these discrepancies. Nevertheless, although there are a number of reasons for the discrepancies between studies devoted to the association between CD209 single nucleotide polymorphisms and development of tuberculosis, but confounding host, bacterial, and submit your manuscript | www.dovepress.com Dovepress Dovepress environmental factors between different study populations should be taken into account. In addition, Mezger et al 24 demonstrated that alleles of rs735240 and rs2287886 polymorphisms may also influence CD209 gene expression and thus affect transcription factor binding. In relation to the CLEC7A (Dectin-1) gene, it was also found that a variant allele of rs16910526 polymorphism is associated with impaired cytokine production by macrophages 31, 32 and with a defective response to Aspergillus and Candida invasion. 33, 34 The variant S form of I223S polymorphism was characterized by a lower capacity of the receptor to bind zymosan. 35 Among polymorphisms of genes encoding RIG-Ilike receptors, RIG-I single nucleotide polymorphisms are the most investigated. Pothlichet et al 36 conducted a comprehensive study investigating the functional consequences of rs36055726 (P229fs) and rs11795404 (S183I) polymorphisms. They found that the variant allele of rs36055726 results in a truncated constitutively active RIG-I (that leads to permanent production of proinflammatory mediators, particularly antiviral), and, conversely, the variant allele of rs11795404 induces an abortive conformation of RIG-I, causing formation of unintended stable complexes between CARD modules of RIG-I and between RIG-I and its downstream adapter protein, MAVS, rendering RIG-I incapable of downstream signaling and further cytokine synthesis. 36 Moreover, Shigemoto et al identified a variant of rs11795404 as a loss-of-function allele. 37 Ovsyannikova et al 38, 39 showed that a minor allele of rs10813831 polymorphism is associated with a decrease in the rubella virus-specific granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor/interleukin-6/IgG response, whilst a variant allele of rs3824456 is connected with an increase in the rubella virusspecific tumor necrosis factor alpha response, and a variant allele of rs669260 correlates with an increase in the rubellaspecific antibody level. Hu et al 40 discovered that a variant allele of rs10813831 polymorphism leads to increased gene expression and, consequently, cytokine production due to an amino acid substitution in the CARD domain of RIG-I that results in functional alteration of this RIG-I-like receptor.",

[43] [44] [45] [46] [47] [48] [49] Taking into account that there are no carcinogenic infectious agents recognizing MDA5, it does not seem to be prudent to investigate IFIH1/MDA5 gene polymorphisms from the oncogenomic point of view. In addition, polymorphisms of genes coding for components of the Toll-like receptor signaling pathway may modulate cancer risk as single nucleotide polymorphisms of the TLR gene family. 1 The same statement can be true for C-type lectin receptor and RIG-I-like receptor signaling pathways. For instance, a variant allele of rs11905552, encoding MAVS/ VISA/IPS-1, a key downstream signaling molecule of RIG-I and MDA5, was associated with a particular systemic lupus erythematosus phenotype. 50 It was found that this single nucleotide polymorphism leads to reduced production of type I interferon and other proinflammatory mediators, and also to the absence of anti-RNA-binding protein autoantibodies. 50 In addition, variant alleles of rs17857295 and rs2326369 polymorphisms of the MAVS/VISA/IPS-1 gene were associated with nephritis and arthritis in patients suffering from systemic lupus erythematosus. 51 A variant allele of another single nucleotide polymorphism of this gene, rs7269320, showed associations with different clinical characteristics of this autoimmune disease. 51 All the population case-control studies mentioned above are summarized in Table 1 .",

There are still no comprehensive functional investigations for other single nucleotide polymorphisms correlated with risk of disease, so it is difficult to conclude which of them have independent significance, and which of them are just in linkage disequilibrium with truly functional variants.",

The problem is that the design in an epidemiological study having a large sample is very seldom ideal. Stratification by status of chronic infection is rather difficult because of their extreme diversity and because of the very high cost of such testing. Stratification by an immune response is even more complex because of innumerable peculiarities in functioning of the immune system. Therefore, if the study has a perfect funding source, stratification by infection status can be possible, but stratification by immune response status will be far from ideal.",
