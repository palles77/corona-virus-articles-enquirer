            "text": "Background and purpose: Most antiviral therapies directed against herpes simplex virus (HSV) infections are limited to a small group of nucleoside analogues that target the viral polymerase. Extensive clinical use of these drugs has led to the emergence of resistant viral strains, mainly in immunocompromised patients. This highlights the need for the development of new antiherpesviral drugs with novel targets. Herein the effects of a plant anthraquinone, emodin, on the HSV-1 alkaline nuclease activity and virus yields were investigated. Experimental approach: HSV-1 alkaline nuclease activity was examined by nuclease activity assay. Inhibition of virus yields was measured by plaque reduction assay and immunohistochemical staining. Interaction between emodin and alkaline nuclease was analysed by docking technology. Key results: Emodin specifically inhibited the nuclease activity of HSV-1 UL12 alkaline nuclease in a biochemical assay. Plaque reduction assay revealed that emodin reduced the plaque formation with an EC 50 of 21.5 \u00b1 4.4 mM. Immunohistochemical staining using the anti-nucleocapsid protein antibody demonstrated that emodin induced the accumulation of viral nucleocapsids in the nucleus in a dose-dependent manner. Docking analysis further suggested that the inhibitory effect of emodin on the UL12 activity may result from the interaction between emodin and critical catalytic amino acid residues of UL12. Conclusions and implications: Our findings suggest that emodin is a potent anti-HSV agent that inhibits the yields of HSV-1 via the suppression of a novel target, UL12.",

HSV infections are more severe in immunocompromised patients, which are characterized by chronic and extensive lesions of the mucous membranes (Whitley, 2001) . Most therapies directed against HSV infections are nucleotides, nucleosides or pyrophosphate analogues, such as acyclovir, valacyclovir, penciclovir and famciclovir. After uptake by virus-infected cells, these drugs are phosphory-lated by virus-encoded thymidine kinase, compete with the nucleotides to inhibit the viral DNA polymerase and subsequently cause the termination of growing viral DNA chains (Field, 2001) . Although these drugs are effective in the treatment of many acute infections, the intensive use of these drugs has led to the emergence of resistant viral strains, mainly in immunocompromised patients (Field, 2001) . Therefore, there is a need to provide other drugs with distinct mechanisms as alternatives to existing therapies.",

Null mutants incapable of expressing UL12 are able to synthesize near wild-type levels of viral DNA, suggesting that UL12 is not essential for viral DNA replication in culture (Weller et al., 1991) . Although UL12 is not essential for viral DNA synthesis, UL12 mutant viral yields are 0.1-1% of wildtype yields (Shao et al., 1993; Martinez et al., 1996a) . The analysis of UL12 null mutants has shown that the decrease in virus yield results from the reduction of capsids exiting from the nucleus (Martinez et al., 1996b; Goldstein and Weller, 1998) . Analysis of replicating DNA from UL12 mutantinfected cells has shown that UL12 is implicated in resolving branched structures of HSV-1 replicative intermediates prior to encapsidation (Martinez et al., 1996a; Porter and Stow, 2004a, b) . Therefore, these results indicate that, even though UL12 is not essential for either viral DNA synthesis or packaging, UL12 is required for full efficiency of these processes. Additionally, these findings suggest that HSV-1 UL12 can be a novel target for anti-herpes viral drugs.",

After four washes with PBS, diluted mouse anti-HSV-1 nucleocapsid monoclonal antibody was added to each coverslip and incubated at 4 1C overnight. After four washes with PBS, diluted FITC-conjugated secondary antibody was added and incubated at 37 1C for 90 min in the dark.

The EC 50 of emodin was 21.5\u00b14.4 mM. Moreover, no significant loss of mitochondrial function was detected by MTT assay. Therefore, these findings indicated that emodin reduced the plaque formation by the inhibition of UL12 activity. Previous studies indicated that HSV-1 UL12 is involved in viral DNA processing and capsid egression (Martinez et al., 1996b; Goldstein and Weller, 1998) . We wondered whether emodin induces the accumulation of nucleocapsids in the nucleus by the inhibition of UL12 activity. Immunohistochemical staining, using anti-HSV-1 nucleocapsid protein antibody, was therefore performed to analyse the localiza-tion of viral nucleocapsids during emodin treatment. No fluorescent signal was observed in mock cells ( Figure 6a ). As expected, the nucleocapsids were localized diffusely in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm at 16 h post-infection because the HSV-1 progenies are assembled and released from cells at 16 h post-infection . In contrast, emodin induced the accumulation of nucleocapsid protein in the nucleus in a dose-dependent manner at 16 h postinfection. Time course assay showed that, in the absence of emodin, nucleocapsids mainly remained in the nucleus at 3 h post-infection, diffused to cytoplasm at 5 h post-infection, and mainly localized in cytoplasm at 8 h post-infection. In contrast, the fluorescent signal mainly remained in the Emodin inhibits HSV-1 yields in vitro C-Y Hsiang and T-Y Ho nucleus during emodin treatment. These findings suggest that emodin inhibited HSV-1 UL12 activity, leading to the accumulation of nucleocapsids in the nucleus and the subsequent reduction of HSV-1 yields. Our findings are also consistent with previous studies showing that UL12 is involved in the egression of capsid from the nucleus (Martinez et al., 1996b; Goldstein and Weller, 1998) .",

            "text": "Antiviral drugs have been used for the treatment of HSV infections for over 45 years (Field, 2001) . Acyclovir is of significant therapeutic value and is considered as the 'gold standard' in HSV therapy. However, approximately 5% of the isolates from immunocompromised patients, which receive a long-term prophylactic treatment with acyclovir, have experienced the emergence of resistant strains (Danve-Szatanek et al., 2004) . Even in immunocompetent populations, the prevalence of resistance ranges from 0.32 to 3.5% by large-scale studies (Fife et al., 1994; Danve-Szatanek et al., 2004) . Therefore, the development of antiviral drugs with different mechanisms is an alternative approach to the control of HSV infections. Viral proteins, that are known to be involved in HSV infection, have been used as the targets for chemotherapy. For examples, viral glycoproteins together with the cell membrane receptors are involved in viral attachment and penetration (Rajc\u00e1ni and Vojvodov\u00e1, 1998) . Sulphated polymer-based inhibitors, which interact directly with viral envelope glycoproteins and prevent viral attachment, are now being tested in Phase II or III clinical trials (Keller et al., 2005) . Helicase-primase complex is essential for the unwinding of dsDNA and the generation of primers for DNA synthesis (Boehmer and Lehman, 1997) . Aminothiazolylphenyl compounds (BILS 179 BS and BILS 45 BS) and thiazolyl sulphonamide compound (BAY 57-1293), that prevent the propagation of helicase-primase catalytic cycle and inhibit its ATPase activity, respectively, display potent anti-HSV effects in mice (Crute et al., 2002; Duan et al., 2003; Biswas et al., 2007) . Viral DNA polymerase is essential for DNA replication (Boehmer and Lehman, 1997) . 4-Hydroxyquinoline-3-carboxamides (PNU-182171 and PNU-183792), Emodin inhibits HSV-1 yields in vitro C-Y Hsiang and T-Y Ho that compete with incoming nucleotides and dislodge the template from the active site, display anti-herpes virus activities in preclinical animal studies (Thomsen et al., 2003; Liu et al., 2006) . In principle, all the replicationessential viral proteins can be considered as potential targets for chemotherapy. This has raised the question. Is UL12 a possible candidate for anti-herpes virus therapy? Although UL12 mutants are able to synthesize near wild-type levels of viral DNA, the yields of mutant virus are reduced by 100-to 1000-fold (Shao et al., 1993; Martinez et al., 1996a) . UL12 mutants display the failure of DNA-containing capsids to migrate into the cytoplasm and the more complex structure of replicative intermediates with an increased frequency of branches (Martinez et al., 1996b; Goldstein and Weller, 1998; Porter and Stow, 2004a, b) . Additionally, antisense phosphorothioate oligonucleotides, targeting an internal start codon of HSV-1 UL12 mRNA, inhibit HSV-1 replication in Vero cells (Chiba et al., 2000) . Furthermore, emodin, that inhibited UL12 activity in vitro, displayed the reduction of HSV-1 yields in Vero cells in this study. These findings indicated that UL12, which is conserved in all species of Herpesviridae, can be considered as the target for the anti-herpes virus therapy.",

Several studies have revealed that the antiviral activity of emodin is through casein kinase 2 (CK2) inhibition, which is exploited by viruses for the phosphorylation of proteins that are essential for viral life cycle (Yim et al., 1999; Battistutta et al., 2000) . Moreover, emodin has affinity for phospholipid membrane and is effective in weakening hydrophobic interactions between hydrocarbon chains in phospholipid bilayers, contributing to the antiviral capacity of emodin against enveloped viruses (Sydiskis et al., 1991; Alves et al., 2004) . In this study, we demonstrated that emodin can exert its antiviral activity by the third mechanism, the inhibition of HSV-1 UL12 alkaline nuclease activity. These findings suggest that emodin may be a potential anti-HSV-1 candidate with a broad spectrum of antiviral activities.",

            "text": "Our results indicate that emodin inhibits HSV-1 UL12 activity, leading to the reduction of HSV-1 yields in Vero cells. How did emodin inhibit nuclease activity of HSV-1 UL12? To answer this question, we modelled the threedimensional structure of UL12 using phage l exonuclease as the template protein. Although HSV-1 UL12 exhibits a low amino acid sequence similarity (13.6%) with l exonuclease, HSV-1 UL12 shares similar enzyme activities and biological functions with l exonuclease. For example, both proteins preferentially degrade DNA from double-stranded end in the 5 0 -3 0 direction (Cassuto and Radding, 1971; Knopf and Weisshart, 1990) . Moreover, they mediate DNA strand exchange by interacting with ssDNA-binding protein and participate in initiating viral recombination events (Muniyappa and Radding, 1986) . The recognizable homology suggests that using l exonuclease as the template for the modelling of UL12 is reasonable. The interaction of emodin with UL12 was predicted by docking analysis. Results showed that emodin docked into UL12 but not bovine pancreatic DNase I (data not shown). Emodin interacted with and Lys-366 of UL12 via hydrogen bonds or hydrophobic interactions. Interestingly, some of these amino acid residues may be critical for the nuclease activity. Site-directed mutagenesis on the HSV-1 UL12 homologue, Epstein-Barr virus DNase, has revealed that Asp-203, Glu-225 and Lys-227 of Epstein-Barr virus DNase, corresponding to Asp-340, Glu-364 and Lys-366 of UL12, respectively, play important roles in catalysis (Liu et al., 2003) . Glu-225 of Epstein-Barr virus DNase, corresponding to Glu-364 of UL12, is involved in metal binding. The docking of emodin into UL12 may affect or occupy the catalytic site of UL12, leading to the inhibition of nuclease activity. Therefore, the interaction between emodin and critical amino acid residues of UL12 may explain why emodin inhibited the nuclease activity of HSV-1 UL12.",

Serum profiles after oral administration of emodin at a dosage of 2 g kg \u00c01 in mice showed that the peak serum concentration of emodin is 700 mM (Mengs et al., 1997) . We revealed that emodin at a concentration of 21.5 mM was sufficient to reduce 50% virus yields without cytotoxic effect. Moreover, there is no evidence or equivocal evidence of carcinogenic activity of emodin in rats or mice (National Toxicology Program, 2001) . Therefore, we speculate that the antiviral effect of emodin measured in vitro may occur in vivo. Furthermore, in addition to the inhibition of UL12, emodin possesses antiviral activities via the disruption of phospholipid bilayer and the inhibition of CK2. Therefore, these results suggest that emodin may be a potent herpes viral inhibitor with a broad spectrum of antiviral activities.",
