In the University of Virginia analysis, after account ing for age, lung allocation score, and type of transplant, 1-year survival after transplantation appeared to be signifi cantly lower in patients with CWP (61%) compared with non miner patients with COPD (82%) or interstitial lung disease (78%). However, independent of the exact prognosis of CWP after transplant, the reality of advanced CWP is that medical treatment may ameliorate symptoms but does not reverse the lung damage or halt the progressive fi brotic process.",

We concur that the medical community needs to be more effective in enhancing awareness of the continuing human toll from these dust diseases and in assuring optimal medical care and fair compensation for affected miners. Progressive massive fi brosis is entirely preventable, since it is virtually only caused by excessive dust inhalation and does not occur from tobacco use or other causes. Effective dust controls should have eliminated this type of lung disease in a modern mining industry, and the failure of the US industry to tackle this ongoing problem has been highlighted internationally. 5 In addition to drawing attention to the role of lung transplantation to improve survival and functional status in these patients, we hope our report's fi ndings can motivate timely implementation of the necessary effective measures to reduce dust exposures and provide a healthful working environment for our country's coal miners.",

            "text": "We thank Dr D'silva and colleagues for their interest in our recent article in CHEST . 1 Most asthma exacerbations are considered to be associated with viruses, 2 and current guidelines do not advocate the use of antibiotics for exacerbations of asthma. 2 Interestingly, Dr D'silva and colleagues only identifi ed viruses in 36% of cases and bacteria in 24%. In COPD, where bacterial infection is implicated as a major cause of exacerbations, current evidence does not support the use of antibiotics in the management of mild to moderate exacerbations. 3 Whether patients with asthma and bacterial-associated exacerbations benefi t from antibiotic therapy is uncertain; however, further detailed analysis of the microbiology of asthma exacerbations using both standard and molecular techniques is warranted. We and others have found that procalcitonin is not strongly associated with an exacerbation of COPD 1 or asthma, 1 but is elevated in patients with pneumonia. It is, therefore, a good biomarker of a systemic infl ammatory response to pneumonia and may have potential clinical utility in directing antibiotic therapy. 4 Importantly, the value of procalcitonin might not be greater than the more widely available C-reactive protein. Controlled trials of antibiotics directed by biomarkers such as C-reactive protein or sputum cell counts at exacerbations of asthma and COPD are required. Biomarker-guided therapy is commonplace in other medical specialties, such as cardiology. This approach needs urgent investigation and to be embraced by respiratory medicine if we are to make a change in the management of exacerbations of airways disease.",
