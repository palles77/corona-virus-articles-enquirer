            "text": "After four decades of effective use of the adamantane class of antiviral drugs in the prophylaxis and treatment of influenza, global resistance to these drugs has increased dramatically among influenza viruses of the A/H3N2 subtype in recent years. In the vast majority of cases, the basis for resistance is a single Ser to Asn amino acid replacement (S31N) in the matrix M2 ion channel, which interferes with the drug's ability to block M2 ion channel activity and viral replication (Wang et al., 1993; Aoki 1998) . Whereas b2% of A/H3N2 influenza viruses sampled globally were resistant to adamantane during 1995-2002, resistance was detected among 12.3% of viruses collected in 2004 (Bright et al., 2005) . Sharp increases in adamantane resistance first appeared in Asia, particularly in China, where the prevalence of resistance increased from 8. 2% in 2002 to 73.8% in 2004 , and also in Hong Kong (69.8% resistance in 2004 (Bright et al., 2005) . Recently, the S31N mutation was detected in 100% of influenza viruses sampled from multiple Asian countries, although sample sizes were relatively small (Deyde et al., 2007) . In the United States, adamantane resistant influenza viruses emerged somewhat later, with prevalence increasing from b2% in 2003 to 11% in 2004-2005, and over 90% during the 2005-2006 epidemic (Bright et al., 2005; Bright et al., 2006) . Since 2006 the USA Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has recommended the cessation of use of adamantanes for treatment or prophylaxis of influenza (CDC 2006) .",

Although mutations conferring drug resistance emerge readily when adamantanes are administered to control influenza outbreaks in nursing homes and long-term care facilities (Shiraishi et al., 2003; Suzuki et al., 2003) , resistant strains typically persist only transiently. Accordingly, the prevalence of resistance to adamantane at a population level has remained low for many decades (b2%), despite periods of significant adamantane usage in certain areas, such as Japan in the late 1990s (Ziegler et al., 1999; Masuda et al., 2000) .",

In particular, it has been proposed that the increased global frequency of the S31N mutation in the M2 protein resulted from a chance hitchhiking event involving linkage to advantageous mutations in other segments following a major 4 + 4 reassortment event, including mutations in HA1 at positions 193 and 225 near the receptor-binding site . This reassortment event, which most likely occurred in early 2005, generated a new global lineage of adamantane resistant A/H3N2 viruses, termed the 'N-lineage', characterized by an antigenically A/ Wisconsin/67/2005-like HA and an M2 protein bearing the S31N replacement . Further characterization of influenza viruses circulating globally identified additional independent introductions of resistant A/H3N2 influenza viruses that emerged prior to the emergence of the 'N-lineage', but which did not spread globally (Deyde et al., 2007) . However, the specific roles of local evolution, migration, and reassortment in the genesis of adamantane resistance in years prior to the global emergence of the 'N-lineage' are unknown.",

In particular, the over-the-counter use of adamantane drugs may have increased in some areas, including China, possibly in association with the recent outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and H5N1 avian influenza virus (Bright et al., 2006; Deyde et al., 2007 , Hayden 2006 . Furthermore, it has been proposed that South-East Asia serves as an epicenter for continuous influenza virus activity, with antigenic variants emerging in tropical South-East Asian countries before disseminating globally (Russell et al., 2008) . According to the 'source-sink' model of influenza A virus evolution, tropical regions in general support continual viral activity, greater genetic diversity, and consequently stronger natural selection, whereas epidemics in temperate areas repeatedly die out due to strong seasonal bottlenecks and require continual re-seeding (Rambaut et al., 2008; Nelson et al., 2007 Nelson et al., , 2006 Tang et al. 2008a) . Overall, the seasonality of influenza in the tropics is less defined than in temperate regions but in some areas is associated with high rainfall (Shek and Lee 2003) .",

Given the early detection of adamantane resistant viruses in China and Hong Kong (Bright et al., 2005) and the prominence of South-East Asia in global influenza virus evolution (Russell et al., 2008) , we sought to investigate the specific role of Hong Kong in the origin and rapid global dissemination of adamantane resistant viruses between 1997 and 2007. As drug selection pressure alone inadequately explains the global domination of adamantane resistant viruses in temperate countries where adamantane usage has not increased in recent years, we explored how the interaction between local evolution, genomic reassortment, and ongoing antigenic change more completely explains the rapid global dissemination of adamantane resistance. In particular, to understand the global emergence of the S31N adamantane resistance mutation within the context of antigenic evolution, we conducted a phylogenetic analysis of influenza virus sequence data for the HA, M1/2, and NA segments that was obtained through ten years of sampling in both subtropical and temperate regions.",

In the years prior to the global proliferation of adamantane resistance viruses associated the emergence of the 'Nlineage' in early 2005 , the overall prevalence of adamantane resistance in our data set was 3.0% (38 / 1250): 11.0% (27 / 246) Phylogenetic analysis of the M1/2 segment of A/H3N2 influenza virus isolates collected from Hong Kong, New York State, Australia, and New Zealand reveals at least 11 independent introductions (i.e., 11 separate clades) of the S31N mutation between the years 1997 and 2007 ( Fig. 1, Table 1 ). This estimate is conservative, as clusters of genetically related resistant isolates are regarded as a single introduction of the S31N replacement even though it is possible (although less parsimonious) that the mutation arose independently among these isolates rather than through viral transmission.",

For example, at least four distinct lineages of A/Sydney/5/1997-like isolates and four distinct lineages of A/Fujian/411/2002-like isolates co-circulate on both the M1/2 and NA phylogenies, as indicated by the phylogenetically divergent clusters of isolates shaded in pink and light green, respectively, on the M1/2 and NA trees ( Figs. 1 and 3) .

Introduction #6 also represents the first S31N mutation observed among A/Fujian/411/2002-like viruses. Given the time and distance separating these three isolates, it is possible that each isolate represents a separate introduction of the S31N mutation, although there is insufficient phylogenetic resolution in this section of the M1/2 phylogeny to distinguish between the single versus multiple introductions of these three isolates (Fig. 1) . Again, to be conservative in the number of independent introductions, we suggest that this introduction spread from the summer 2003 epidemic in Australia to the winter 2003-2004 epidemic in New York State (Table 1) . (Holmes et al., 2005) . Although these isolates cluster with A/Fujian/411/2002-like isolates on the HA tree (Fig. 2) , they are members of a clade that is related to older A/Sydney/5/1997-like isolates on both the M1/2 and NA trees (Figs. 1 and 3) Whereas the six previous introductions of the S31N mutation likely exhibit limited spread in time and space, Introduction #7 is continually detected among this viral population for more than 3.5 years (from 07/06/2003 to 03/14/2007) and gives rise to the majority of adamantane resistant isolates in our data set, including the major 'N-lineage' that is associated with the global spread of adamantane resistance that begins in 2005 (Table 1, Fig. 1 ) . This reassortment event is evidenced by the phylogenetic distance on the HA tree between two sets of isolates that are both closely related on the M1/2 tree in association with Introduction #7 (Figs. 2 and 1, respectively) . On the HA tree, one of these sets clearly is A/Fujian/411/2002-like ('#7F', Fig. 2) , while the other is A/ Fig. 2 ). In addition, the four phylogenetically distinct clusters of '#7F' isolates on the HA tree suggest that A/Fujian/411/2002-like isolates may have acquired the #7 S31N introduction through multiple additional reassortment events. The phylogenetic divergence between two clusters of '#7F' isolates is particularly pronounced on the NA tree ('#7F1' and '#7F2', Fig. 3 Supplementary Fig. 1) . Notably, none of the additional global isolates in the 'N-lineage' isolates was sampled prior to the original 03/01/2005 emergence date we identified in Hong Kong. Nor do any of the global background isolates associated with Introduction #7 pre-date its first detection in Hong Kong on 07/06/2003 ( Supplementary Fig. 1 (Figs. 1 and 2) .",

By tracing the evolution of adamantane resistance among three geographically and climatically distinct localities for the HA, M1/2, and NA segments, we are able to determine evolutionary processes operating at both regional and global scales. Given that the therapeutic usage of adamantane drugs has been at a constant and relatively low level for many decades in temperate areas, including the United States, simple models based on local drug selection pressures alone inadequately explain the rapid rise in the global prevalence of adamantane resistance in recent years. Rather, we find that the emergence and spread of adamantane resistance appears to be a complex evolutionary process that includes geographically variable selection pressures, extensive global migration, and frequent reassortment.",

This estimate is also conservative, given the limitations of our sampling and our capacity to identify additional de novo introductions among genetically related resistant isolates. As several introductions of the resistant S31N mutation were detected in elderly patients in temperate regions where adamantane is more frequently administered to seniors (Cohen et al., 2008; Couch 2000) , it is possible that intra-host selection was involved in a number of these introductions. However, 10/11 of these introductions were represented by no more than three isolates in each case, suggesting that these introductions experienced only limited in spread in our studied population, and that drug selection pressure alone was insufficient to increase the prevalence of S31N.",

Although our data set is limited to the HA, NA, and M1/2 segments, we were still able to observe a number of reassortment events among these three genome segments. While genetic diversity appears to be more limited in the HA, presumably due to strong immune selection pressures, multiple divergent lineages co-circulated on the NA and M1/2 phylogenies prior to the selective sweep associated with the emergence of A/California/7/ 2004-like viruses that has been described previously (Rambaut et al., 2008) . It is this long-term preservation of genetic diversity in the M1/2 segment that allows for the continued circulation of both adamantane sensitive and adamantane resistant influenza viruses to the present day. Indeed, just as influenza viruses acquired adamantane resistance through reassortment in 2005, it has been observed that resistant influenza viruses may re-acquire drug sensitivity through reassortment with adamantane sensitive lineages that continue to co-circulate in both the United States and in Japan (Furuse et al., 2008) .",

We also included the following five vaccine reference strains in our HA data set (n = 231) to determine antigenic groups: A/Sydney/5/1997, A/Wyoming/03/2003 (A/ Fujian/411/2002-like), A/California/07/2004, A/Wisconsin/67/ 2005, and A/Brisbane/10/2007. To study the emergence of adamantane resistance in a broader global context, an additional 20 A/H3N2 influenza virus isolates exhibiting the S31N adamantane resistance mutation (and for which HA1 sequences were also available) were identified, and M1/2 and HA1 sequence data was downloaded from GenBank (Bao et al., 2008) and added to the original data sets (n = 246). These background isolates were collected between 2003 and 2005, mainly from South-East Asia (Macau, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand, and Vietnam) (Supplementary Table 5 ).",

In each case, the best-fit model of nucleotide substitution was identified by MODELTEST (Posada and Crandall, 1998) as the general reversible (GTR+I+\u0393 4 ) model, with the frequency of each substitution type, proportion of invariant sites (I), and the gamma distribution of among-site rate variation with four rate categories (\u0393 4 ) estimated from the empirical data (parameter values available upon request). In all cases tree bisection-reconnection (TBR) branch-swapping was utilized to determine the globally optimal tree. To assess the robustness of each node on the phylogenetic tree, a bootstrap resampling process (1000 replications) using the neighbor-joining (NJ) method was used, incorporating the ML substitution model. Clades of related isolates were again identified by high bootstrap values (N70) and exceptionally long branch lengths. Independent introductions of the S31N replacement were inferred from clade positions on the M1/2 phylogeny and the location and dates of sampling.",

Introduction #7 is first detected in Hong Kong on 07/06/ 2003 (A/Hong Kong/CUHK50895/2003) and is continually detected in Hong Kong for nearly two years (through 04/28/2005) (Table 1). A single resistant isolate is observed during this time outside of Hong Kong (A/New York/204/2003, 08/16/2003), but during the nonepidemic summer months in New York State and is likely to be a spillover from Asia (Table 1, Fig. 1). All resistant isolates circulating in Hong Kong from 2003 to 2004 are A/Fujian/411/2002-like in antigenicity. However, in the early spring of 2005 these resistant viruses acquire an antigenically novel HA segment described as A/Wisconsin/67/2005-like, at which point this lineage has been referred to as the 'N-lineage'",

The first of the reassortant 'N-lineage' isolates is detected in Hong Kong on March 1, 2005 (A/Hong Kong/CUHK7711/2005) (Table 1). Adamantane resistant reassortant isolates rapidly proliferate globally thereafter, emerging in Oceania by the late spring of 2005 and reaching New York State during the 2005-2006 winter epidemic (Table 1). An expanded phylogenetic analysis of the M1/2 segment that includes additional adamantane resistant isolates collected globally from 1997 to 2007, mainly from South-East Asia from 2003 to 2005, indicates that the 'N-lineage' circulated widely in South-East Asia during the late spring and summer of 2005, including Vietnam, Malaysia, Philippines, Thailand, and Macau (",

            "text": "). As expected, the majority of these global resistant isolates are associated with the main Introduction #7, and all 2005 global isolates are members of the 'N-lineage.' The third independent introduction of the S31N mutation among A/Fujian/411/2002-like viruses is detected in 2004 involving three isolates from Hong Kong (Introduction #8, Table 1, Fig. 1), while the fourth, Introduction #9, occurs along a phylogenetically divergent lineage of the M1/2 segment that is primarily sensitive to adamantane drugs (isolate A/Hong Kong/CUHK35011/ 2004) (Table 1, Fig. 1). Despite the global dominance of adamantane resistant influenza viruses from 2005 to 2007, a phylogenetically distinct lineage of the M1/2 segment that for the most part lacks the S31N substitution co-circulates from 2004 to 2007 (Fig. 1). This adamantane sensitive lineage includes all of the A/California/7/2004-like isolates, as well as small clusters of sensitive A/Fujian/411/2002-like and A/Wisconsin/67/2005-like isolates. Consequently, while the vast majority of A/Wisconsin/ 67/2005-like isolates are resistant to adamantanes, several A/ Wisconsin/67/2005-like isolates are adamantane sensitive due to reassortment with this sensitive M1/2 lineage that co-circulates: isolates A/Canterbury/127/2005, A/Hong Kong/CUHK63957/2006, A/Hong Kong/CUHK68792/2006, A/New York/UR06-373/2007, and A/New York/UR06-515/2007",
