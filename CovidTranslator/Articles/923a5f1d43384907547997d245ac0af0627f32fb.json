The methods used have significant differences based on tissue source, cell isolation, culture conditions, and assessment of culture purity. We modified and optimized a method for generating tracheal epithelial cultures from Syrian golden hamsters and characterized the cultures for cell composition and function. Soon after initial plating, the epithelial cells reached a high transepithelial resistance and formed tight junctions. The cells differentiated into a heterogeneous, multicellular culture containing ciliated, secretory, and basal cells after culture at an air-liquid interface (ALI). The secretory cell populations initially consisted of MUC5AC-positive goblet cells and MUC5AC/CCSP double-positive cells, but the makeup changed to predominantly Clara cell secretory protein (CCSP)positive Clara cells after 14 d. The ciliated cell populations differentiated rapidly after ALI, as judged by the appearance of \u03b2 tubulin IV-positive cells. The cultures produced mucus, CCSP, and trypsinlike proteases and were capable of wound repair as judged by increased expression of matrilysin. Our method provides an efficient, high-yield protocol for producing differentiated hamster tracheal epithelial cells that can be used for a variety of in vitro studies including tracheal cell differentiation, airway disease mechanisms, and pathogen-host interactions.",

It is clear that animal studies provide the best system for studying organ and tissue function; however, the inability to perform real-time observations; precisely control nutrient, toxin, or growth factor concentrations; and difficulty in assessing direct versus indirect effects limit the experimental parameters that can be tested in vivo. In contrast, cell lines are grown easily and have defined characteristics (inducible gene expression, cell type-specific markers, etc.) but are usually derived from a single cell type and cannot perform all the functions attributed to the original organ or tissue.",

            "text": "The airway epithelium consists of a variety of cell types: ciliated cells that propel mucus up through the respiratory tract, secretory cells that are primarily responsible for secreting factors within the mucus layer, and basal cells that are hypothesized to play a structural role and serve as a pool of progenitor cells that can repopulate a damaged epithelial cell layer (Wu, 1997) . Studies of function and development of airway epithelial cells are important in understanding the basis of diseases such as cystic fibrosis, cigarette smoke-associated airway injury, and are particularly interesting to us in the study of microbial pathogen-induced injury and disease. Many groups have cultured tracheal epithelial cells (TECs) for evaluating airway growth and development (Wu and Smith, 1982; Lee et al., 1984; Kaartinen et al., 1993; You et al., 2002) as well as pathogen-host interactions (Goldman et al., 1982; Look et al., 2001; Sinn et al., 2002; Walters et al., 2002; Zhang et al., 2002) , and protocols have ranged from tracheal ring organ cultures (Collier et al., 1977) to enzymatic dissociation followed by various culture conditions (Goldman and Baseman, 1980; Lee et al., 1984; Wu et al., 1985; Yamaya et al., 1992) . The most successful techniques have described culturing at an air-liquid interface (ALI) (Whitcutt et al., 1988; Yamaya et al., 1992; Robison et al., 1993; You et al., 2002) . Specific hormone media formulations and ALI culture conditions have allowed researchers to create heterogeneous cultures that differentiate into a variety of cell types, including the major cell types found in the airways (Wu, 1997) .",

            "text": "The use of Syrian golden hamsters as a small animal model for a variety of human pathogens has been of particular interest to us. Microbial pathogens ranging from severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus (Buchholz et al., 2004) , West Nile virus (Morrey et al., 2004) , Nipah virus (Wong et al., 2003) , South American hantaviruses (Hooper et al., 2001; Milazzo et al., 2002) , human parainfluenza virus 3 (Tao et al., 1999) , Bordetella pertussis (Collier et al., 1977) , influenza (Ali et al., 1982) , Rift Valley Fever virus (Fisher et al., 2003) , eastern equine encephalitis virus (Paessler et al., 2004) , and leishmania (Melby et al., 2001) have been shown to infect and cause disease in hamsters. Because several of these pathogens interact with the airway epithelium, we sought to optimize and streamline protocols for the isolation and culture of well-differentiated hamster TECs. Our protocol is based on other TEC protocols, using mouse (You et al., 2002) , guinea pig (Robison et al., 1993) , human (Yamaya et al., 1992 (Yamaya et al., , 2002 Karp et al., 2002) , and hamster (Lee et al., 1984; Wu et al., 1985; Moller et al., 1987; Whitcutt et al., 1988) tissue. We achieved a high efficiency of cell isolation per hamster (5 \u00d7 10 5 to 6 \u00d7 10 5 cells/trachea), resulting in the seeding of 10-15 wells/animal. The cells are initially devoid of significant numbers of ciliated or secretory cells but rapidly differentiate into a heterogeneous culture containing ciliated, secretory, mucous, and basal cells. Cell types were quantified by immunostaining, characterized by electron microscopy, and possessed secretory and ciliated cell activities. Thus, hamster TECs can provide a faithful in vitro representation of the in vivo tracheal epithelium for studying a variety of systems.",

Tracheas were excised from below the larynx to the major bronchi. The explanted tracheas were digested for 12-18 h with 0.3% pronase (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) in Ham's F-12 with 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 \u03bcg/ml streptomycin followed by deoxyribonuclease treatment (0.5 mg/ml in Ham's F-12, Calbiochem, EMD Biosciences, San Diego, CA) for 10 min at 4 \u00b0C (You et al., 2002) . Cells were resuspended in TEC Basic (Table 1 ) with 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and plated in a 3.5-cm cell culture plate for 3 h at 37 \u00b0C, 5% CO 2 to remove contaminating fibroblasts (You et al., 2002) . The recovered epithelial cells were plated on thin-layer collagen-coated 0.4-\u03bcm pore 0.33 cm 2 Transwell-Clear (Corning Costar, Corning, NY) supported membranes (You et al., 2002) . Collagen coating was performed by applying 50 \u03bcg/ml rat tail collagen type I (diluted in 0.02 N glacial acetic acid) to each membrane, incubating overnight at 4 \u00b0C, and washing three times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) before cell plating. Cells were plated at a density of 1 \u00d7 10 5 cells/cm 2 , and typical yields were 5 \u00d7 10 5 to 6 \u00d7 10 5 cells/trachea. Cells were grown in TEC Plus (Table 1) , and apical and basolateral media were changed every 2 d (Lee et al., 1984; Wu et al., 1985; Yamaya et al., 1992; Robison et al., 1993; You et al., 2002) . Transepithelial resistance (TER) was measured with the Millipore Millicell-ERS (Millipore, Bedford, MA). On reaching a TER of >1000 \u03a9-cm 2 , the apical media was removed to create an ALI (Whitcutt et al., 1988; Yamaya et al., 1992; Robison et al., 1993) , and the basolateral media was then replaced with TEC MM (Table 1) (Yamaya et al., 1992; Karp et al., 2002; You et al., 2002) . The cells were routinely infected between days 10 and 14 ALI.",

The CCSP single-positive population steadily increased to become the predominant secretory cell type at roughly 30% of the total cell population by 15 d ALI (Fig. 5B) .

Trypsin cleaves the influenza A virus HA precursor protein into disulfide-linked subunits and is required to convert the protein into a fusion competent form (Paterson and Lamb, 1993; Steinhauer, 1999) . Figure 6A demonstrates that exogenous trypsin is not required for influenza A virus replication in hamster TECs, whereas Fig. 6C demonstrates that HA cleavage occurs in the absence of exogenous trypsin. Because the influenza A virus life cycle takes approximately 12 h to complete, cells expressing viral antigen at 24 and 48 hpi most likely represent cells that were not infected with initial virus inoculum but with infectious virus produced from the initially infected cells. This is in contrast to infection of most transformed cell lines, MDCK cells serving as an example in Fig. 6A and B. A 12-h time point was taken because HA is not detectable at later time points because the infection of MDCK cells in the absence of trypsin is abortive. Finally, infected hamster TECs produced comparable numbers of viral antigen-positive cells in the presence or absence of exogenous trypsin at 24 hpi ( Fig. 6D-F ). Using various cell markers, we determined that viral antigen was present in ciliated and secretory cells (data not shown). These data indicate that unlike most transformed cell lines, hamster TECs produce a trypsin-like enzyme capable of cleaving the influenza A virus HA protein.",

To determine if hamster TECs were capable of wound repair, the TER as well as matrilysin expression was monitored after injury. At 1 and 12 h postinjury, the cells had a low TER, which was restored to >500 \u03a9-cm 2 by 24 h postinjury, after which a high resistance was maintained (Fig. 7A) . At 12 and 24 h postinjury, the cells were monitored for matrilysin expression using immunofluorescence confocal microscopy ( Fig. 7B and D) . At 12 h postinjury, matrilysin expression was detected in cells surrounding the injury (Fig. 7B) . By 24 h postinjury, matrilysin expression was still present within the scarred region, but the wound had closed, and this correlated with a high TER (Fig. 7D) . Nuclei staining was used to monitor the migration of cells into the wound (Fig. 7C and E) . These data suggest that hamster TECs are capable of wound repair.",

            "text": "In this study, we defined a primary hamster TEC culture system that produces a welldifferentiated cellular population that is grown at an ALI, similar to the environment encountered in vivo. Hamster tracheal cultures have been reported (Goldman and Baseman, 1980; Lee et al., 1984; Niles et al., 1988; Whitcutt et al., 1988; Wu, 1997) , and in this study we modified, updated, and streamlined the methodology. The use of protease dissociation for cell isolation resulted in a high yield of epithelial cells (roughly 5 \u00d7 10 5 to 6 \u00d7 10 5 cells/trachea), and use of hormone-and serum-supplemented medias led to rapid proliferation and differentiation of the cells at ALI. We chose to limit our cell-type analysis to cells that could be identified with antibodies to well-characterized cell markers in order to objectively characterize the cellular makeup of the cultures and used electron microscopy primarily to assess the ultrastructure of the cultures. We found that our cultures produced a heterogeneous cell population, similar to the trachea in vivo, including ciliated and nonciliated cells. The nonciliated cells were identified as basal (electron microscopy), goblet (MUC5AC-positive), and Clara (CCSP-positive) cells and were capable of producing and secreting mucus and mucus-associated proteins. Interestingly, a high percentage of cells expressed both MUC5AC and CCSP immediately after ALI. Whether Clara cell differentiation is completely independent of MUC5AC expression, proceeds through a MUC5AC/CCSP positive intermediate cell, or goblet cells themselves can differentiate into Clara cells through the double-positive intermediate remains to be investigated. It is interesting to note the mounting evidence indicating that Clara cells can differentiate into MUC5AC-positive goblet cells, perhaps through a MUC5AC/CCSP double-positive population, in response to interleukin-13 or antigen challenge in murine models of airway hyperresponsiveness (Reader et al., 2003; Shahzeidi et al., 2003) . The presence of both cell populations in hamster TEC cultures allows for the study of the interdependence of these two cell populations (Boers et al., 1999; Hayashi et al., 2004) .",

Although we have not extensively characterized differentiation in the absence of ALI, it is clear from the literature that ALI is an important stimuli for differentiation of mouse (You et al., 2002) , human (Yamaya et al., 2002) , guinea pig (Robison et al., 1993) , rat (Kaartinen et al., 1993) , and hamster (Whitcutt et al., 1988) TECs. This differentiation after ALI is consistent with the isolation of a progenitor population as seen in other tracheal isolation protocols (Goldman and Baseman, 1980; You et al., 2002) . In vivo, the secretory cells that populate the airways consist of Clara and goblet cells (Wu, 1997) . These cell types were present in our cultures and in roughly similar quantities to that observed in hamster tracheas (data not shown). Secretory cells predominated early, as compared with ciliated cells, consistent with reports that suggest that secretory cells may serve as a progenitor population (Wu, 1997) . The MUC5AC-positive population was found to be a small percentage, whereas the CCSP-positive population predominated as the major secretory cell in the mature hamster TEC culture (Figs. 4 and 5) as well as in vivo (data not shown). Transmission electron microscopy analysis indicated the cells morphologically consistent with basal cells (Fig. 3C) , suggesting that this cell type may constitute the remaining 20-30% of the cells in this culture.",

After injury, hamster TECs quickly regained a high TER, suggestive of establishing cellular tight junction integrity and wound repair (Fig. 7A) . Under light microscopy, the wound was no longer visible at 24 h postinjury (data not shown). Matrilysin expression is upregulated in response to injury in healthy cells that surround an injury (McGuire et al., 2003) , and indeed it appeared to be induced on injury of the hamster TECs. Interestingly, there was a low level of matrilysin expression in mock cells as shown by immunofluorescence microscopy and Western blot analysis (data not shown). This is consistent with reports that in vivo, matrilysin is constitutively expressed in the airways (Dunsmore et al., 1998) and supports the role of matrilysin in other responses, such as immune modulation and airway homeostasis (Parks et al., 2004) .",

Recently, Syrian golden hamsters have been described as suitable small animal models for many emerging infectious diseases, including SARS coronavirus (Buchholz et al., 2004) , Nipah virus (Wong et al., 2003) , and the South American hantaviruses, Andes and Maporal viruses (Hooper et al., 2001; Milazzo et al., 2002) . These viruses are transmitted through inhalation, result in high morbidity and mortality in human infections, and require high containment facilities (biosafety levels 3 or 4) in which to conduct research (Lopez et al., 1996; Chua et al., 2000; Ksiazek et al., 2003) . The respiratory tract is likely to play an important role in the disease progression of these pathogens, whether as a site of virus replication or simply as a barrier preventing virus access to other organs in the animal. Therefore, the use of in vitro systems, such as the hamster TEC culture, could provide a preferred environment to study virus-host interactions, as well as testing of antiviral molecules. Hamster tracheal epithelial cell (TEC) tight junction formation. (A) Transepithelial resistance was measured across the cell layer at the indicated d relative to the air-liquid interface (ALI). Zonular occludin 1 (ZO-1) staining was monitored by immunofluorescence confocal microscopy at (B) \u22126 d, (C) \u22123 d, (D) 0 d, and (E) 5 d ALI. All images were acquired at \u00d763 magnification. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) of hamster tracheal epithelial cell (TEC) differentiation. Scanning electron microscopy was performed on hamster TECs at various d after ALI: 0, 3, 5, 10, and 14 d (A-E, respectively) or on tracheal sections from a 6-wk-old female hamster (F).
