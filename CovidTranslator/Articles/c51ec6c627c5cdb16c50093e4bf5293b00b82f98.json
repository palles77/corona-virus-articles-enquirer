Existing habitat-based models do not consider interspecies pathogen transmission, a primary route for emergence of new infectious diseases and reservoirs in wildlife and man. The modeling of interspecies transmission has the potential to provide more accurate predictions of disease persistence and emergence dynamics. The new models are motivated by our recent work on hantavirus in rodent communities in Paraguay. Our Paraguayan data illustrate the spatial and temporal overlap among rodent species, one of which is the reservoir species for Jabora virus and others which are spillover species. Disease transmission occurs when their habitats overlap. Two mathematical models, a system of ordinary differential equations (ODE) and a continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC) model, are developed for spread of hantavirus between a reservoir and a spillover species. Analysis of a special case of the ODE model provides an explicit expression for the basic reproduction number, \u211b 0 , such that if \u211b 0 < 1, then the pathogen does not persist in either population but if \u211b 0 > 1, pathogen outbreaks or persistence may occur. Numerical simulations of the CTMC model display sporadic disease incidence, a new behavior of our habitat-based model, not present in other models, but which is a prominent feature of the seroprevalence data from Paraguay. Environmental changes that result in greater habitat overlap result in more encounters among various species that may lead to pathogen outbreaks and pathogen establishment in a new host.",

            "text": "Successful transmission of a directly transmitted pathogen requires opportunities for contact between species. These opportunities often occur when the preferred habitat of a species overlaps or is invaded by a second species. Interspecies interactions, especially among species competitively utilizing the same resources, often result in aggressive encounters. If a pathogen is present in a reservoir host, the encounter may result in pathogen transmission to a naive host or adaptation of the pathogen to create a new reservoir. The reservoir population, the carrier of the pathogen and the long-term host, often does not exhibit disease symptoms or experience any additional mortality.",

Our goal is to model the process of interspecies pathogen transmission based on species habitat preferences. The motivation for the models comes from our recent study of hantavirus in Paraguay. Hantavirus (Family Bunyaviridae) is a genus of viruses, each generally associated with a specific rodent species (i.e., mice and rats). Approximately 30 different hantaviruses exist throughout the world, some of which cause human infection (Mills et al., 1997) . Human infection is incidental, generally due to indirect transmission from contact with infectious rodent excreta, but may result in hantavirus pulmonary syndrome with a mortality rate as high as 37% (CDC, 2002) . One of the reservoir species for hantavirus in Paraguay is Akodon montensis (Montane Akodont found in Eastern Paraguay, Northeastern Argentina and Southeastern Brazil) carrier of Jabora virus (JABV, GenBank # EF492471). Our empirical data show that although these species exhibit different habitat preferences, the combination of partial habitat flexibility and temporally variable climatic and soil and vegetation conditions, results in periodic microgeographic sympatry of Akodon with one or both of the spillover species.",

A multi-species epizootic model for susceptible and infected hosts was formulated and analyzed by McCormack and Allen (2007) but this model was not spatially explicit and did not account for differences in epizootiology of reservoir and spillover species. Our new models take into account habitat partitioning and important differences in the epizootiology of the reservoir and spillover populations. The role of the spillover species in pathogen and disease emergence is not well understood. It has been speculated that the spillover species may contribute to maintenance of the pathogen in the wild, provided there is spillback infection (McCormack and Allen, 2007) or the spillover species may be instrumental in the evolution of new hantaviruses . Spillover infections occur in hantavirus (Delfraro et al., 2008; Palma et al., 2009; Klingstrom et al., 2002; Torrez-Martinez et al., 2005; Wiedmann et al., 2005) but are not unique to hantaviruses (Daszak et al, 2000) ; they have been documented in other zoonotic diseases including rabies (Nadin-Davis and Loza-Ruio, 2006; Nel et al., 1997) , Nipah virus (Chua, 2003) , canine distemper, parvovirus (Fiorello et. al, 2006) , and the SARS coronavirus (Holmes, 2003) .",

We formulate two models, the first model is a deterministic model, a system of ordinary differential equations (ODE), whereas the second model is a stochastic model, a continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC) model. The ODE system is analytically tractable in the case that encounters in the boundary region are brief. In this case an explicit expression for the basic reproduction number, \u211b 0 , can be calculated, the threshold for disease outbreaks. The basic reproduction number is one of the most important parameters in the study of disease ecology. Specifically, it is the number of secondary infections caused by introduction of one infectious individual into an entirely susceptible population (see Anderson and May, 1991; Hethcote, 2000) . The ODE system does not capture the few cases that occur due to interspecies interactions in the region of overlap. Therefore, we formulate a CTMC model for this purpose. Numerical solutions of the stochastic model illustrate sporadic infection in the spillover species when habitats overlap, a prominent feature of the seroprevalence data from Paraguay. Analysis and simulation of our new models show that as the number of encounters in the overlap region and the time spent in the overlap region increase (which may be triggered by habitat change), there is greater likelihood of pathogen outbreaks and disease persistence in the reservoir and spillover populations (through increase in \u211b 0 ). Interspecies encounters and pathogen transmission in the region of overlap may be the first step in the evolution of a new hantavirus strain.",

This site is highly disturbed by human activities and is intensively managed for pasturing and grazing. Reforestation is suppressed and graminoid cover maintained by frequent prescribed burning. Large ungulate grazers, primarily domestic cattle (Bos taurus) are present on this site year-round. Vegetation in the site is dominated by species of the genus Andropogon, warm temperature/tropical grasses used as grazing forage. Other common vegetation genera include Merostachys (bamboo) along the fringes of pastures and Xyris (a forb) in lower, wetter areas. Although dominated by herbaceous species, R3A retains a few islands of woody vegetation and trees, especially along the edges of the deforested areas. These forest remnants are better microhabitats for Akodon, and most captures of this species were along the northwest and southeast corners of the grid, the edges closest to the woodlands.",

These edges and gaps are associated with a dense understory at the forest floor, favorable habitat for A. montensis (Pardi\u00f1as and D'El\u00eda, 2003) . Dominant vegetation genera in areas of intact or mostly intact forest include Cedrela and Balfourodendron.

Where vegetation structure permitted (R3B only), another trap was placed 2-3 m above ground, in branches or vines, to sample other more arboreal species. However, although A. montensis is preferentially a forestdweller, it only rarely climbs in the vegetation (651 of 661 [98.5 %] of our captures of this species on R3B were on the ground). Both grids were sampled in nine sessions from February 2005 through May 2007, using standard mark-recapture techniques for small mammals (Wilson et al., 1996) . Each session included eight consecutive nights (seven in February 2005). Animals were individually marked with a subdermally-implanted Passive Integrated Transponder (PIT) tag, which can be read by passing the electronic reader near the animal's body. Date, grid, trap station, and the PIT tag number were recorded, animals were identified to species, and sex and weight were recorded. Blood, saliva, urine, and feces were collected the first time an animal was captured during each sampling session, for assay of hantavirus antibody and viral RNA presence. Animals were then released at the site of capture. All field protocols were approved by the Texas Tech University Animal Care and Use Committee. A. montensis has been described as the primary reservoir of JABV. RNA-positive individuals of Akodon were encountered on R3B and R3A, and seropositive individuals of N. lasiurus and O. delator were trapped and identified on R3A. Each of these species is widely distributed in the central Southern Cone of South America (Carleton and Musser, 2005) , and may be locally abundant in their preferred habitat. Habitat preferences differ somewhat among the three, which is critical to this field situation and to the model which we present herein. N. lasiurus and O. delator prefer grasslands, with Necromys preferring dry soil and Oxymycterus preferring wet or even saturated soils. A. montensis preferentially inhabits disturbed woodlands, also venturing into old-fields and grasslands which include forbs and brushy growth (Redford and Eisenberg, 1992; Goodin et al., manuscript) . Our data from nine sampling sessions through 27 months support these descriptions of habitat preferences, and further indicate that the microgeographic separation among these three species is partial and temporally variable and often incomplete, with overlap (microsympatry) occurring sporadically between A. montensis and one or both of the spillover species. Figure 2 illustrates this situation on site R3A, and also indicates the presence of seropositive individuals for each of these species in close proximity to the others.",

The models described below assume density-dependent transmission (pseudo mass action incidence) as in other hantavirus models (Abramson and Kenkre, 2003; Abramson et al., 2003; Allen et al., 2006a; Allen et al., 2006b) . The models and results can be easily generalized to frequency-dependent transmission which in some cases may provide a better fit to data (Begon et al., 1999) . In stable environments, frequencydependent transmission may be appropriate, but in the overlap region, where rodents occupy the region for only a short period of time, encounters are most likely density-dependent. The average length of the exposed and highly infectious periods are I/\u03b4 r and 1/\u03b3 r , respectively. All parameters are assumed to be positive unless noted otherwise. The model for the reservoir population takes the following form:",

It can be easily shown that the extinction equilibrium is unstable; the population persists. For example, it follows from equations (3.8) that in the preferred habitats, the population densities approach a constant value, their respective carrying capacities, The preferred habitats serve as a population source for the boundary region. The densities in the boundary region depend on the densities of these source populations and the movement rates into and out of this region. In particular, in the boundary region, the reservoir and spillover population densities are respectively. As the ratio p i /p o increases, so do the population densities in the boundary region, whereas the densities in the preferred habitats will approach their respective carryingcapacities. Hence, the total reservoir population density (preferred + boundary) is K r + K a and the total spillover population density is K s + K b . The equilibrium values for the unique DFE are S r = K r , S a = K a , S s = K s , and S b = K b ; all of the other equilibrium values are zero.

The reproduction numbers can be calculated using the next generation matrix approach (van den Driessche and Watmough, 2002) . For the general system (3.4)-(3.6), it is possible to show that the basic reproduction number is a positive root of a fourth degree polynomial but it is difficult to obtain a simple analytical expression for \u211b 0 . The simplifying assumption (4.9) leads to an explicit expression for \u211b 0 (shown below). This explicit expression is a close approximation to the overall basic reproduction number, if the time spent in the boundary is short relative to the time spent in each of the disease states.

In this case, it is straightforward to calculate the enzootic equilibrium for the reservoir host, To derive an expression for the basic reproduction number for the habitat-based model when (4.9) holds, we first define an expression which depends on interspecies or crossover transmission. That is, let the intraspecies transmission parameters be zero, \u03b2 I = \u03b2 P = \u03b2 A = 0 and \u03b2 a1 = \u03b2 a2 = \u03b2 b3 = 0 and the interspecies transmission parameters, \u03b2 b1 , \u03b2 b2 , and \u03b2 a3 , be nonzero. The reproduction number for interspecies pathogen transmission is defined as Note that depends on the ratio p i /p o directly and indirectly through the carrying capacities in the overlap region, K b and K a . The preceding definition can be used to define the basic reproduction number for the habitat-based model (3.4)-(3.6): The local stability of the DFE follows directly from the results of van den Driessche and Watmough (2002) . Global stability of the DFE when \u211b 0 < 1 and condition (4.9) holds can be verified by construction of a Liapunov function. The full system (3.4)-(3.6) consists of 16 differential equations which makes it difficult to find an explicit closed form solution for an enzootic equilibrium (EE). However, existence and uniqueness of a positive EE can be verified when \u211b 0 > 1 and condition (4.9) holds. It is shown, in the Appendix, that the EE for the full system (3.4)-(3.6) is a fixed point of E r = f(E r , E s ) and E s = g(E r , E s ). Then the existence of a unique positive EE follows by applying a theorem (Hethcote and Thieme, 1985) on existence and uniqueness of a positive fixed point.

The reservoir species A. montensis and one spillover species (N. lasiurus) are widely distributed in many of our study sites sampled in Paraguay, whereas the other spillover species (O. delator) is less widespread and generally less abundant. We choose carrying capacities of K r = 100 and K s = 50 for the reservoir and spillover species in their respective habitats. Although the values for K r and K s are not known, the selected values are close to the estimates for minimal number known alive based on data from the trapping regions. The basic time unit in the model is one year. We assume total number of births per female per year that survive to the adult reproductive stage is six for the reservoir and the spillover species (several litters per year). Assuming an equal sex ratio, for the male population the number of males that survive to reproductive age is b r = 3 = b s . Population growth is assumed to satisfy a logistic growth assumption so that for the reservoir and spillover species, so that d r (K r ) = b r and d s (K s ) = b S . We assume an average duration of two weeks for the latent period E and for the spillover infectious stage A, and an average duration of three months for the highly infectious stage for the reservoir species (Bernshtein et al., 1999; Lee et al., 1981; Padula et al., 2004) . Hence, \u03b4 r = 26 = \u03b4 s , \u03b3 s = 26, and \u03b3 r = 4, e.g., 1/26 year \u2248 two weeks. In addition, \u03b4 a = \u03b4 r , \u03b4 b = \u03b4 s , \u03b3 a =\u03b3 r , and \u03b3 b = \u03b3 S . Animals enter the boundary region several times per year and stay only a short time. The average length of time in the boundary region is less than the average length of time for the latent period or acute infectious period, 1/p o \u22641/\u03b4 i and 1/p o \u2264 1/\u03b3 i , i = a, b. In the numerical examples, we let p i = 8 and p o = 52 which means, on average, each animal may make eight visits per year to the boundary region, spending about one week in the boundary region. The probability there is a transition from an exposed to an infectious state while in the boundary region is 1/3 (see equation (3.7)). Even though this probability is not small, the basic reproduction number given by (4.12) is a good approximation to the overall basic reproduction number for our parameter values (shown below). The parameter values are reasonable but are chosen for illustrative purposes (a range of values, p i \u2208 [2, 25] and p o \u2208 [26,364], are considered later in this section). These parameter choices give population densities in the boundary region of K a \u2248 15 and K b \u22488.",

Instead, we make some reasonable assumptions about their relationship to disease transmission in the infectious stages, \u03b2 I and \u03b2 P . The product \u03b2 I K r is the number of infectious contacts that result in infection by a highly infectious reservoir animal per year (at equilibrium). Based on the summary data for proportion of animals RNA-or antibody-positive, 0.25 at site R3B, if we equate formula (4.11) to 0.25 and let b r = 3 and \u03b4 r = 26, this leads to \u211b r = 1.39 (when p i = 0 = p o ). Thus, the value of \u03b2 I is chosen so that (which is close to \u211b r ) is between one and two. We assume that the highly infectious stage of the reservoir host (RNA-positive and/or antibody-positive) is three times as infectious as the persistently infectious stage (only antibody-positive), i.e., \u03b2 I = 3\u03b2 P (Bernshtein et al., 1999; Lee et al., 1981; Padula et al. 2004 ). In addition, we assume the transmissibility of the pathogen in the acute infectious stage A of the spillover host is the same as for the persistent stage in the reservoir host, \u03b2 A = \u03b2 P . This leads to . In the boundary region, intraspecific transmissibility remains the same as in the preferred habitats, but interspecies transmissibility is doubled due to aggressive encounters.

The models are based on the fact that spatial overlap of habitats leads to greater numbers of interspecies encounters. From the ODE model, an explicit expression for the basic reproduction number \u211b 0 was calculated based on the assumption (4.9), as well as reproduction numbers for the preferred habitats, and , and for crossover or interspecies transmission, . In this case, we showed global stability of the disease-free equilibrium when \u211b 0 < 1 and existence of an enzootic equilibrium when \u211b 0 > 1. Greater numbers of interactions among species allow the pathogen to be transmitted more frequently from an infectious host to a susceptible host. This, in turn, increases \u211b 0 so that it exceeds the reproduction number in the preferred habitat, \u211b 0 > \u211b r (Figure 7) , which ultimately results in greater likelihood of outbreaks and disease persistence. As illustrated in Figure 2 , the overlap region is spatially-and temporally-dependent. We did not consider temporal variability of this overlap region which may depend on seasonal variations. But we did include demographic variability due to births, deaths, transmission, and movement in the CTMC model. Seasonal variations, in general, will cause additional variability in the solution behavior (e.g., Allen et al., 2005) . As more data are collected, the effects of seasonal and climatic variations on the reservoir and spillover species will be studied.

The Jacobian matrix of \u2131 and , evaluated at the DFE, isThe probability of no change is one minus the sum of the 38 probabilities defined above and the probability of any other change is o(\u0394t).Differential equations for the joint probability function of X follow from these infinitesimal transition probabilities. The joint probability function is a solution of the forward Kolmogorov differential equations, an infinite system of differential equations. For multivariate processes, the form of these differential equations is often too complicated for analytical purposes. This is the case for our CTMC model with 16 random variables. The general form of the forward Kolmogorov differential equations depends on the set S = U\u00d7U\u00d7\u2026\u00d7U = U 16 , where U = {\u22121,0,1}. Let h a (X) denote the rate at which events occur for a \u2208 S, where the values of a = (a 1 ,\u2026, a 16 ) are defined above. For example, for the 38th event, a 16 = 1, a 12 = \u22121 and a i = 0 for i \u2260 12,16 so that h a (X) = p 0 X 12 . There are 38 events for which h a (X) \u2260 0.
