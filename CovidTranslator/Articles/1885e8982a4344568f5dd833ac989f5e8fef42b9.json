The primers were derived from the corresponding sequences of infectious bronchitis virus (IBV). The PCR products were cloned and sequenced and their nucleic acid structure and similarity to published sequences of other coronaviruses were analyzed. Sequencing and subsequent analysis revealed 9 open reading frames (ORFs) representing the entire S protein gene, tricistronic gene 3, membrane (M) protein gene, bicistronic gene 5, and N protein gene in the order of 5 -3 . The overall nucleic acid structures of these encoding regions of TCoV were very similar to the homologous regions of IBV. The consensus transcription-regulating sequence (TRS) of IBV, CT(T/G)AACAA, was highly conserved in TCoV genome at the levels of nucleotide sequence and location in regarding to the initiation codon of individual genes. Pair-wise comparison of gene 3, M gene, gene 5, or N gene sequences with their counterparts of IBV revealed high levels (82.1-92.0%) of similarity. Phylogenetic analysis based on the deduced amino acid sequences of S, M, or N protein demonstrated that TCoV was clustered within the same genomic lineage as the IBV strains while all the other mammalian coronaviruses were grouped into separate clusters corresponding to antigenic groups I or II. There were substantial differences of S protein sequence between TCoV and IBV with only 33.8-33.9% of similarity.",

This unique antigenicity was questioned when the close relationship between TCoV and bovine coronavirus (BCoV) was demonstrated in a series of antigenic studies (Dea et al., 1990) and by sequence analysis of TCoV M and N genes (Verbeek and Tijssen, 1991) . In contrast, recent antigenic (Guy et al., 1997; Loa et al., 2000) and genomic (Breslin et al., 1999a,b; Akin et al., 2001; Cavanagh et al., 2001 Cavanagh et al., , 2002 Lin et al., 2002) analysis of TCoV, however, demonstrated that TCoV and IBV, two avian coronaviruses, are closely related. The causes for these discrepant results regarding the relationships of TCoV with BCoV or IBV remained unclear. Further analysis of genomic structure of TCoV is important to clarify this enigma. Thus, the purpose of the present study was to determine the sequences of the 3 end coding region for structural protein genes of TCoV.",

The number, nucleotide sequence, and gene order of these ORFs varied remarkably among different coronaviruses. It is speculated that these genes were inserted into different sites in the coronavirus genomes due to the RNA recombination-prone discontinuous transcription mechanism and were not essential for virus replication and pathogenesis. However, sequence analysis in the present study indicated that both nucleotide sequences and locations of these ORFs and their consensus TRS of TCoV are highly conserved with those of IBV.

Several conserved TRS have been identified for different coronavirus proximal to the initiation codon of the first ORF for each particular subgenomic mRNA. The consensus sequences of the TRS sites are CT(T/G)AACAA for IBV, ATC(T/C)AAAC for BCoV, AACTAAAC for TGEV, AATC(T/C)A(A/T)AC for MHV, and AACTAAAC for FIPV (Spaan et al., 1988; Stirrups et al., 2000) . The distance between the TRS and the first ORF is different for each subgenomic mRNA of different coronaviruses. Both the nucleotide sequence of TRS and the distance between the TRS 3 end and the initiation codon of first ORF are suggested to play important role in the transcription of mRNAs. As shown in the present study, the TRS sequences of TCoV were found highly conserved with those of the corresponding genes of IBV except one nucleotide substitution in that of gene 3. The TRS of gene 3 is ATGAACAA for TCoV and CTGAACAA for IBV. The distances between TRS and initiation codon of S gene, gene 3, gene 5, and N gene of TCoV were all the same as those of IBV while the distances for TCoV or IBV M gene are 74 or 77, respectively. The highly conserved sequences and structures of TRS between TCoV and IBV provide further evidence that these two avian coronaviruses share close evolutionary relationship. These highly conserved TRS sequences of IBV has been shown to be recombination \"hot spot\" and may serve as the template switching sites for the viral encoded RNA dependent RNA polymerase (Lee and Jackwood, 2000) . These recombination events play important role to the emergence of new IBV variants responsible for continuous outbreaks in the chicken flocks vaccinated with live attenuated viruses due to failure of cross protection. It is possible that the similar recombination events of IBV in chicken may contribute to the origin and evolution of TCoV in turkey and merit further investigation.",

The similarity of S protein sequences between TCoV in the present study and IBV strains (33.8-33.9%) is much lower than that among IBV strains (83.2-94.0%). The difference of nucleotide between TCoV in the present study and IBV seems to be randomly distributed throughout the entire S gene except a stretch of 225 nucleotides from the 3 end that shared high similarity (88.9%) with the corresponding sequences of IBV. These observations suggested that cross-over homologous recombination, very likely by a template switching mechanism, occurred around the consensus TRS site of S gene and within the 3 end 225 nucleotides region (involving the TRS site of gene 3) and resulted in a whole new codon reading frame for S protein of TCoV with conserved TRS and other genomic structure features of IBV. Spike protein of coronaviruses has been well known as the major structural protein responsible for attachment, fusion, and penetration of virions to the target cells. The substantial difference of S protein gene between TCoV and IBV well explains the different host tropism and different tissue pathogenicity of these two avian coronaviruses.

The positions where nucleotide bases are missing are indicated as (-) and identical nucleotides as (.). Heavy underlines below the sequence of TCoV indicate the putative start codons. Light lines above the sequence of TCoV indicate the stop codons. The conserved tanscription-regulating nucleotide sequence (A/C)T(T/G)AACAA, which is located upstream from the start codons of individual genes, is boxed. The start codon of IBV M protein gene is also underlined because it is at different position from that of TCoV M protein gene.",
