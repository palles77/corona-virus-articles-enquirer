This assumes that lockdown is complete, which can be guaranteed in the simulation, but not in reality. Still, it gives strong support to the argument that it is never too late for complete lockdown. 2. As a rule of thumb, we would suggest complete lockdown no later than once 10% of hospital capacities available for COVID-19 are in use, and possibly much earlier. This is based on the following insights: a. Even after lockdown, the infection dynamics continues at home, leading to another tripling of the cases before the dynamics is slowed. b. There will be many critical cases coming from people who were infected before lockdown. Because of the exponential growth dynamics, their number will be large. c. Researchers with more detailed disease progression models should improve upon these statements. 3. Our simulations say that complete removal of infections at child care, primary schools, workplaces and during leisure activities will not be enough to sufficiently slow down the infection dynamics. It would have been better, but still not sufficient, if initiated earlier. 4. Infections in public transport play an important role. In the simulations shown later, removing infections in the public transport system reduces the infection speed and the height of the peak by approximately 20%. Evidently, this depends on the infection parameters, which are not well known. -This does not point to reducing public transport capacities as a reaction to the reduced demand, but rather use it for lower densities of passengers and thus reduced infection rates.",

Optimally, they should be confirmed independently. Short of that, given current knowledge we believe that they provide justification for \"complete lockdown\" at the latest when about 10% of available hospital capacities for COVID-19 are in use (and possibly earlier; we are no experts of hospital capabilities). 1",

Although the infection does not lead to severe illness for many people, about 10-20% of infected persons need hospital care, and about 5% become critical (Robert Koch Institute 2020). Given, say, 22000 hospital beds (Berlin.de n.d.) for 3.5 million people in Berlin, it is clear that 100000 simultaneously infected persons, needing 10000 to 20000 hospital beds, would push the system beyond its limits.

This also means that in the first approximately 10 days the number of infected persons is small, and the situation does not seem dramatic. This then rapidly changes, eventually leading to about 2.3 million simultaneously infected persons around day 44. Evidently, this is what we should not let happen; according to the above numbers it would imply 230,000 persons needing hospital care, many times more than what the system can absorb. 2 \u2022 The number of recovered persons goes up to about 97% of the population. 3 Once that many persons are immune, the reinfection rate drops below 1, and the virus dies out. \u2022 The model does not explicitly contain death cases. For the dynamics of the model, it is irrelevant if infected persons eventually recover or eventually die. Fig. 5 shows the share of infections occurring in different containers. The outcome shows that especially home, leisure, work and public transit activities have a high influence on the epidemic spreading. As the home activity cannot be reduced, the next sections will outline the effects of reducing leisure, work and public transport. One notices that about a fourth of infections occur in public transit vehicles. Our current assumption is that the contact intensity , as described earlier, is 10 times higher in public transport vehicles than in activities. Fig. 6 shows the effect a complete shutdown of public transport would have. The cases differ from each other with regard to the time point the measure is introduced. The maximum number of simultaneously infected persons goes down in every case, and the maximum is reached later compared to the base case. Also, the overall number of infected persons becomes smaller, implying a lower threshold of herd immunity.

The peak number of simultaneously infected persons can be reduced to about 970.000 cases when enforcing this strategy no later than day 20. This underlines the recommendations stated before that work and leisure activities should be reduced early enough. However, 970.000 simultaneous cases are still too many for our current hospital system to process, even though it is a very drastic measure. 4.6 Assuming no infections at work, at leisure activities, and in public transport Fig. 10 shows the effect of closing both work and leisure activities and also shutting down public transport. Compared to the section before, the maximum number of simultaneously infected persons can be reduced even more to approximately 880.000 persons when enforcing this strategy no later than day 20.
