            "text": "Atlantic cod trypsin ZT is biochemically characterized for the first time in this report in comparison to a group I trypsin (cod trypsin I). To our knowledge, trypsin ZT is the first thoroughly characterized group III trypsin. A more detailed understanding of trypsin ZT biochemistry may give insight into its physiological role as well as its potential use within the biotechnology sector. Stability is an important factor when it comes to practical applications of enzymes. Compared to trypsin I, trypsin ZT shows differences in pH and heat stability, sensitivity to inhibitors and sub-site substrate specificity as shown by multiplex substrate profiling analysis. Based on the analysis, trypsin ZT cleaved at arginine and lysine as other trypsins. Furthermore, trypsin ZT is better than trypsin I in cleaving peptides containing several consecutive positively charged residues. Lysine-and arginine-rich amino acid sequences are frequently found in human viral proteins. Thus, trypsin ZT may be effective in inactivating human and fish viruses implying a possible role for the enzyme in the natural defence of Atlantic cod. The results from this study can lead to multiple practical applications of trypsin ZT.",

            "text": "The global seafood industry produces large amounts of waste with huge potential for utilization [1] . As an example, the Norwegian and Icelandic seafood industries produced 1.246.000 tons of by-products in 2013 combined [2] . A portion of this material is used for low value products whereas a large share becomes waste with concurring strain on the environment [2] . Of the underutilized by-products from the seafood industry, fish viscera is a rich source of proteolytic enzymes such as trypsin, chymotrypsin and elastase [3] . A variety of industrial applications for fish trypsins have recently been reviewed [4] . Trypsin from Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) gets special attention in the review [4] due to the thorough basic knowledge available on different cod trypsin isoenzymes and their potential use in high-value products for therapeutic applications for humans [5] . Notably, recent studies have shown that cod trypsin has efficacy against human respiratory viruses and herpes simplex virus in vitro [5] . The epidermal mucus of fish contains trypsin like serine proteases that play a significant role in the natural defence of fish against pathogens such as viruses and bacteria [6] [7] [8] [9] . Atlantic cod trypsin is produced from viscera as production of recombinant trypsin is not yet economically feasible [10] [11] [12] . Two main trypsin groups have been identified in Atlantic cod, termed group I and group III, based on their deduced amino acid sequence identities [13] [14] [15] [16] . Different Atlantic cod group I trypsin isoenzymes have been isolated, purified and characterized [14, 17] . Cod trypsin ZT belongs to group III trypsins. To our knowledge, cDNA sequences for group III trypsins have thus far only been described in fish [18] . Prior to this report, the group III trypsins have not been thoroughly characterized. Therefore, it was difficult to contemplate the physiological role or potential utilization of cod trypsin ZT, due to lack of biochemical data on the group III trypsins. In that context, cleavage specificity, sensitivity to inhibitors and stability is of interest. Stability analysis of proteins that have possible therapeutic applications or industrial use is important [4, [19] [20] [21] .",

Table 1 shows the effect of serine protease inhibitors (PMSF, TLCK, TPCK and soybean trypsin inhibitor), 2-mercaptoethanol and EDTA on cod trypsin ZT activity after 30 min incubation at 25\u00b0C. Cod trypsin ZT is less sensitive to the trypsin inhibitors TLCK, PMSF and soybean trypsin inhibitor (Table 1 ) compared to cod trypsin I. The results on cod trypsin I derive from a study on the effect of inhibitors on the amidase activity (BzArg-NH-Np) of cod trypsin I [36] . On the other hand, cod trypsin ZT is more sensitive to EDTA and 2-mercaptoethanol compared to cod trypsin I [36] . Cod trypsin ZT is partly inhibited by TPCK which is an irreversible inhibitor of chymotrypsin. TPCK is generally known to bring about no inhibition on the activity of trypsin [37] . The 2-mercaptoethanol has been shown to convert sulfur-containing groups of ox trypsin to \\ \\SH groups and to lower the activity of the enzyme [38] . Slightly more inhibition of cod trypsin ZT is observed with 2-mercaptoethanol at 100 mM concentration compared to cod trypsin I [36] . The effect of the metalloprotease inhibitor EDTA on cod trypsin ZT activity was much higher compared to cod trypsin I [36] . Taken together, the results signify that cod trypsin ZT is a serine protease based on its inhibition by PMSF and belongs to the trypsin family based on its susceptibility to inhibition by TLCK and soybean trypsin inhibitor.",

Cleavage of any one of the available peptide bonds within the peptides was detected by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) sequencing [26] . Based on the results, motif analysis was conducted. Representations using iceLogo [28] that take into account both the cleaved and uncleaved positions in the peptide library were made. This was done to visualize the fold enrichment and de-enrichment of amino acids flanking each cleavage site (cleavage occurs between the P1 and P1\u2032 positions) ( Fig. 7 and Supplementary file 4). As expected for tryptic enzymes, cod trypsin ZT and cod trypsin I both shared an enrichment of Arg and Lys at the P1 position. Differences between the two enzymes were detected. Unlike cod trypsin I, Glu at P3 was detected at a low frequency and Gln was preferred at P4\u2032 by cod trypsin ZT. After 15 min and 60 min incubation, cod trypsin I disfavored Arg at P4\u2032 in contrast to cod trypsin ZT. Both cod trypsin ZT and cod trypsin I exhibited a preference for Ser at P1\u2032 and bulky hydrophobic amino acid residues at P3 (Tyr), P2 (Phe) and P4\u2032 (Phe) after 5 min and 15 min incubation. Furthermore, Asp was detected at a low frequency at P2 and as has been observed for other trypsins [39] , there was low tolerance for Pro at P1\u2032 for both enzymes. In line with the finding that cod trypsin ZT did not show activity towards a substrate (Suc-Ala-Ala-Pro-Phe-pNA) designed for chymotrypsin (data not shown), amino acid residues specific for chymotrypsin (F, Y and W) are disfavored by cod trypsin ZT and cod trypsin I at position P1 within the substrate (Fig. 7) .",

Blue color (Zscore, N0) reflects a preference for the amino acid residue in a certain P position in favor of cod trypsin ZT compared to cod trypsin I.

Also, cod trypsin ZT is less stable at lower pH values (below pH 7, Fig. 4 ) than cod trypsin I [14] . In general, proteins are highly charged at extreme pH that can lead to their partial denaturation due to electrostatic repulsions [20] . The lower stability of cod trypsin ZT can be of importance for certain practical purposes as the activity of cod trypsin ZT can be better restricted than cod trypsin I [5, 14] . In addition, cod trypsin ZT has narrower maximal activity range at different pH than cod trypsin I (Fig. 3) . This characteristic can also be utilized for more stringent control of maximal tryptic activity. It is well known that stability is an important parameter which in part determines the practical feasibility of applying enzymes in industrial processes [40] . Various stabilizing liquid formulations have been developed for cod trypsin in order to facilitate its application in biomedicine (unpublished results). Stability studies involving chemical modifications of trypsin have also been undertaken with some success [3, 5, 41] .",

In line with those findings, cod trypsin ZT has an overall preference for arginine and lysine amino acid residues, in favor of arginine, at the cleavage site (P1) based on MSP-MS analysis ( Fig. 7 and Supplementary file 4) . Furthermore, cod trypsin ZT belongs to the trypsin family as shown by its susceptibility to inhibition by TLCK and Soybean inhibitor ( Table 1 ). The sensitivity of proteases to inhibitors is of importance for their potential therapeutic application [43] . Interestingly, despite the fact that cod trypsin ZT is partly inhibited by a chymotrypsin inhibitor (TPCK) it showed no activity towards a chymotryptic substrate (data not shown) unlike the previously identified native-and recombinant group III trypsin, cod trypsin Y [11, 44] . The difference observed in the sensitivity of trypsin ZT to inhibitors relative to trypsin I might be important for effective digestion because of inhibitors present in feed. This has been proposed for human trypsin isoenzyme (mesotrypsin) that might serve a specific function in digestion because of low sensitivity to inhibitors [45] .",

Notably, lysine and arginine rich amino acid sequences are frequently found in surface proteins of viruses infecting humans [46] [47] [48] . For that reason, cod trypsin ZT might be of value against certain human pathogenic viruses.

Trypsin diversity is particularly high in fish, decapod crustaceans and insects [52, 54, 55] . The occurrence of multiple isoenzymes is thought to provide adaptive advantage in some insects feeding on plants containing inhibitors [10, 54] . In salmon (Salmon salar), different trypsin isoenzymes can have an effect on physiological conditions such as fish size, growth rate, protein utilization and feed efficiency [55] . Enzyme polymorphism has also been shown to be important for adaptation to a broad food spectrum in caridean shrimp (Crangon crangon) [56] . The results presented here demonstrate that cod trypsin ZT and cod trypsin I show differences in stability to pH and heat, sub-site substrate specificity and sensitivity to inhibitors. It is therefore tempting to suggest that trypsin polymorphism plays an adaptive role in the Atlantic cod as it appears to do in salmon, decapod crustaceans and insects.",

However, using naturally selected isoenzymes to make enzyme combinations for certain therapeutic use is a novel approach. The knowledge gathered on the biochemical properties of cod trypsin ZT and cod trypsin I allows for development of different combinations of cod trypsin isoenzymes aimed for biomedical applications. Future research will focus on further characterization of cod trypsin ZT including kinetic analysis and stability studies using circular dichroism (CD) and other known techniques [19] [20] [21] . Furthermore, research on the efficacy of cod trypsin ZT against human viruses as well as fish viruses will be conducted. The results will give insight into the physiological role of cod trypsin ZT and aid in its practical application.",

Trypsin ZT is the first thoroughly studied group III trypsin reported. This isoenzyme shows differences in pH and heat stability compared to cod trypsin I. Stability is a key parameter which co-determines the practical feasibility of applying an enzyme in an industrial process. Differences were also observed between the two enzymes in their sensitivity to inhibitors and sub-site substrate specificity. The results indicate that cod trypsin ZT may be of value for inactivating viruses. Thorough understanding of cod trypsin ZT biochemistry increases basic scientific understanding and may lead to multiple novel uses within the biotechnology sector.",

Motif analysis of time-dependent substrate specificity profiles for trypsin ZT and trypsin I are shown as percent difference in occurrences for an amino acid (relative to the available amino acids in the library), plotted at each position P4 to P4\u2032. Amino acids most often detected at each P position are shown above the horizontal axis, and the amino acids least frequently detected are shown below the axis. Statistically significant residues (P b 0.05) are colored by physicochemical property (black: hydrophobic; blue: basic; red: acidic). Residues in pink are absolutely disfavored (never observed in a cleavage). Purple indicates amidic amino acids (N) and residues in green are amino acids capable of forming H-bonds. Letter height corresponds to the percent difference value. Figure is made with iceLogo software, iceLogo representations. Heat map representation based on standard scores (Z-score) ratio at the P4-P4\u2032 positions in multiplex substrate profiling substrates comparing the substrate specificity of trypsin ZT and trypsin I after incubation for 5 min. Amino acid residues in a substrate undergoing cleavage were designated P1, P2, P3, P4 in the N-terminal direction from the cleaved bond. The residues in C-terminal direction are designated P1\u2032, P2\u2032, P3\u2032, P4\u2032. The P positions are provided in the columns and the rows show amino acids in the different P positions.
