The air velocity, particle velocity and particle deposition velocity were validated with available experimental data. Several particle deposition ratios were proposed to describe the particle accumulation due to bends. Particle deposition velocities in and behind bends were analyzed numerically. It is found that bend walls with surfaces of higher capture velocity tend to accumulate more contaminant particles as seen with an increased factor of 1.2 times on particle deposition velocity. Particle deposition reaches a maximum value near bend outlet, e.g. 15.2 times deposition ratio for particles of d p \u00bc 23 mm, and decay exponentially to a status of fully developed deposition in approximately 10D length. Compared to traditional consideration of sole deposition in bends, a new general concept of total deposition including that in bends and behind bends is proposed to better describe the particle deposition induced by bends since the enhancement deposition ratios behind bends compose 42e99% in the total ratios for particles of d p \u00bc 3e23 mm. Furthermore, models of fast power and exponential decay trend are demonstrated to uncover the relationship among enhancement factor of deposition velocity behind bend, dimensionless distance behind bends and particle Stokes number. The present study can contribute to the understanding and controlling of contaminant aerosol flow behavior in ducts, e.g. particle sampling, removal and associated epidemiologic study between particle and human health.",

Nowadays, to provide a comfortable built environment, central ventilation systems are commonly installed in modern commercial, institutional and public buildings, and therefore the ventilation ducts become one main way to transport particle-laden airflow [8] . In real ventilation ducts, one of the main parts is the bend for flow direction adjustment and pollutant aerosol deposition [9] . Additionally, there are other practical applications of particle flowing through bends, including the removal of particulates from industrial duct bends [10] and extractive sampling of pollutants in gas flow [11, 12] .",

The experimental data from Liu & Agarwal [34] was also presented to compare the deposition velocities in bends with those in straight ducts. It can be seen that predicted deposition velocities in bends are much larger than those in straight ducts by one or two orders of magnitude. Sippola and Nazaroff [16] also drew a similar conclusion when comparing their experimental data in bends with those in their straight ducts. Among the three experiments in bends, result data also change by about one order of magnitude due to different experimental conditions. Simulated particle deposition velocities from s \u00fe p \u00bc 1.2 to 32.9 fall within the experimental data [11, 12, 16] . The surface effect on particle deposition velocity can be clearly seen from Fig. 7 . The deposition velocity with copper surface is the lowest. This observation can also be seen in Fig. 5 where deposited particle numbers with different surfaces are presented. The reason of a low deposition velocity with copper surface could be due to the low capture velocity near such surface. Between particle relaxation time s \u00fe p \u00bc 1:2 and 6:4, the particle deposition velocity with molybdenum surface is 0.7e1.2 times larger than that of a copper surface. Given more experimental data about particle collision behavior onto different surfaces with a wide particle diameter range, more deposition velocities could be predicted following the proposed method in this work.

            "text": "Since a bend in the flow stream can cause the change of flow pattern and lead to flow turbulence behind bends, the particle deposition behind bends would be enhanced due to the bend. To describe the deposition change along the straight duct behind a bend, dimensionless distance (s*) is expressed as s* \u00bc (La \u00c0 x)/D, which is shown in Fig. 8 . In the present work, the dimensionless distance is an integer number. In the equation, La is the total straight duct length behind bends, which equals 1.2 m in this paper, and x is the horizontal coordinate. In addition, the predicted results in the following discussion were simulated based on the wall surfaces of the lowest capture velocity. Fig. 9 shows the comparison of average particle deposition velocity behind 90 bends for d p \u00bc 3e23 mm particles from s* \u00bc 1 to 12. Correspondingly, the Stokes numbers of these particles are from 0.016 to 0.89. Each particle deposition velocity at an s* value is the average deposition velocity based on the deposition particle numbers from s* \u00c0 1 to s*. The calculation method can be found in Eq. (14) . As shown in the figure, the magnitude of the dimensionless particle deposition velocity changes from 0.0317 to 1.332, which is much higher than those illustrated in Figs. 6 and 7 . This behavior provides quantitative evidence through simulation that the deposition behind the bend is enhanced due to bend-induced turbulence. Along with the increasing of dimensionless particle relaxation time from s \u00fe p \u00bc 1:21 to 67:8, the deposition velocity increases sharply by 4.8e10 times. Current results of the enhanced particle deposition behind bends and the changing trend could explain and support previous experimental visualized observations and reports behind bends qualitatively [16, 26] .",

From s* \u00bc 1 to 2, the particle deposition velocity reduces tremendously, which reflects the rapidly decreasing influence of bend-induced vortices. The reduction degree from s* \u00bc 2 to 5 is moderate and from s* \u00bc 6 to 12 is minor. The decreasing deposition could be probably attributed to the turbulent level reduction when the distance increase behind bends as shown in Fig. 10 .

In the presentations of the deposition ratio and the following enhancement factor, Eqs. (1e4) were adopted at the domain inlet to guarantee the airflow was fully developed in straight duct ahead of bends. The results range from R da \u00bc 0.91 to 15.2, which indicate the quantitative increase of particle deposition caused by bend. Particle accumulation is very high near the bend outlet. Deposition ratios increase from 4.61 to 15.2 times for particle diameters increasing from d p \u00bc 3e23 mm. The deposition is reduced sharply from areas near the bend outlet to those further away from it. From s* \u00bc 10 to 12, the deposition ratios are close to unity 1. This phenomena means that the flow disturbance due to bend is weakened to a marginal level at these areas, and the length of increased deposition due to the presence of the bend is Fig. 11 . Bend-induced deposition ratio distribution along the distance behind bend for different particle diameter. 10 times as long as the cross dimension (D) of straight duct. This interpretation is partially supported by the experimental measurements of particle deposition in developing turbulent flow in the studies of Sippola and Nazaroff [16] . Fig. 12 illustrates the bend-induced enhancement deposition ratio in and behind bends for present simulation domain. The enhancement deposition ratios in bends and behind bends correspond to the first and second term in Eq. (18), respectively. These ratios are calculated based on Eqs. (16)e (18) . They can be also called as additional deposition caused by bend. For small particles, for example, d p \u00bc 3 mm, the enhancement deposition ratio is rather low because the ratio considers the bend as equivalent straight duct and the Stokes number indicates that small particles are easy to follow fluid flow. In other words, smaller particles are hardly to impact onto bend walls. However, the flow pattern change by bends also leads to deposition enhancement behind bends, and the total ratio is mainly composed of the enhancement deposition behind bends, approximately 99% for particles of d p \u00bc 3 mm. This behavior is probably due to that eddies behind bends are adaptable to catch smaller particles onto wall surfaces as demonstrated in Fig. 12 . For larger particles, the major composition of the total ratio is reversed, i.e. in bends. However, the deposition behind bends are still of a great portion, approximately 42% for particles of d p \u00bc 23 mm. Therefore, when describing the particle deposition induced by bends, the general concept of total deposition including that in bends and behind bends is much better than sole particle accumulation in bends.",

Particle deposition distribution and deposition velocity in 90 ventilation bends with different surface materials were analyzed numerically, and the simulation results were also validated with experimental data. Bend-induced deposition ratio and deposition velocity were also discussed and fitted quantitatively. To summarize, the following conclusions can be drawn: a) Predicted particle deposition velocities in bends are much higher than those in straight ducts by one to two orders of magnitude. Between the predicted particle relaxation time 1.2 and 6.4, the particle deposition velocities with surfaces of highest capture velocity can be 1.2 times larger than those of lowest capture velocity. This behavior indicates that the duct bend wall with surfaces of high capture velocity is easy to accumulate contaminant particles. b) Current simulation provided quantitative evidence that the deposition behind a bend is sharply enhanced due to bendinduced turbulence. Particle deposition had a peak value near bend outlet. Along the straight duct behind bends, the depositions decreased exponentially toward a deposition pattern of fully developed turbulent flow since the bend-induced eddies are weakened. c) It is much better to adopt the general concept of total deposition including that in bends and behind bends to describe the particle deposition induced by bends. Deposition behind bends forms a large portion of the total bend-induced deposition, especially for smaller particles. d) Power decay trend was obtained between the enhancement deposition ratio (R dae ) and dimensionless distance (s*). Nonlinear exponential decay trend was also given among enhancement factor of deposition velocity behind a bend (e da ), dimensionless distance (s*) and particle Stokes number (St). These fitting equations are valid according to the current simulation condition for the ranges of s* \u00bc 1e12 and St \u00bc 0.016e0.89. Finally, two fitting equations of dimensionless deposition velocity behind bend were developed to model the deposition trend easily and universally.",
