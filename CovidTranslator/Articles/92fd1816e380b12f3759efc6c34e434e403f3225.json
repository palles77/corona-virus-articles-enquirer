            "text": "A 6-month-old female Iberian lynx (Lynx pardinus) cub that was severely affected by mange died in September 2016 in the Montes de Toledo (Spain) with crusts and fissures on its face, outer ears, nipples and footpads. The body condition of the cub was very poor, and it also had a mandibular abscess and a severely ankylosed luxation on its left knee. After confirming that the origin of the deceased cub's dermal lesions was Sarcoptes scabiei, the subsequent search for ectoparasites and a comparison of histopathological and immunohistochemical findings in all sympatric lynxes handled (n = 30) and submitted for necropsy (n = 4) during 2016 and 2017 revealed the presence of S. scabiei mites and/or milder mange compatible lesions in five members of her family group, which was treated against mange together with two exposed contiguous family groups. An ELISA developed by the authors showed the presence of antibodies against S. scabiei in the deceased female cub and one brother. The presence of concomitant immunosuppressive factors in the dead female cub and the results obtained for the other sympatric lynxes studied since 2016 suggest that S. scabiei had a limited effect on immune-competent Iberian lynxes in the local population of the Montes de Toledo. However, a different evolution and relevance of sarcoptic mange in different populations-or even in the same one in the presence of immunosuppressive factors-cannot be ruled out, thus confirming the need for further research in order to attain a complete comprehension of the epidemiology and the real threat that this ectoparasitic disease may imply for L. pardinus.",

In this respect, an outbreak of feline leukemia virus (FeLV) during 2007 severely affected (Meli et al. 2010 ) the small Iberian lynx population in Do\u00f1ana National Park (one of the only two remaining stable populations at that time). Subsequent studies carried out to investigate the transmission of FeLV from affected lynxes to cats stressed the particular susceptibility of Iberian lynxes to infectious diseases (Geret et al. 2011) . Other infectious diseases, such as tuberculosis, pasterellosis, clostridiosis, feline parvovirus infection, or Aujeszky's disease virus infection, have been confirmed to affect the Iberian lynx (Mill\u00e1n et al. 2009; L\u00f3pez et al. 2014; Masot et al. 2017 ), but few works have been published with regard to the effects of macroparasites and ectoparasites on L. pardinus, including their effect as pathogens or as vectors of pathogens (Mill\u00e1n et al. 2007 ). Sarcoptic mange, which is caused by the burrowing mite Sarcoptes scabiei, is a relevant illness owing to its zoonotic condition and economical relevance in domestic animals, while from an ecological point of view, sarcoptic mange may be an important problem for isolated or small size populations (Martin et al. 1998; Kalema-Zikusoka et al. 2002) . Various feline species have been described to be affected by sarcoptic mange in the wild, including the cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus), the serval (Felis serval), the African lion (Panthera leo), the leopard (Panthera pardus), and the Eurasian lynx (Lynx lynx) (Munson et al. 2010) . In the last case, sarcoptic mange was reported to be the most frequent infectious disease in Sweden, affecting up to 22% of the non-hunted dead lynxes reported (Ryser-Degiorgis et al. 2005a ). The disease was considered to have contributed to the decrease in the Swedish lynx population during the first decade of a major mange epidemic (1980 ( -1990 ( , M\u00f6rner 1992 , although after its hunting was prohibited, the population recovered in 1999 (Ryser-Degiorgis et al. 2005b ). In Switzerland, mange was first detected in the small and inbred reintroduced Eurasian lynx population in 1999 (Ryser-Degiorgis et al. 2002 and increased the overall percentage of infectious causes of mortality by up to 40% (Schmidt-Posthaus et al. 2002) , although no important related population decline was reported (von Arx et al. 2004) .",

This lynx was born in the framework of the LIFE-IBERLINCE program: BRecuperation of the historical distribution of the Iberian lynx (Lynx pardinus) in Spain and Portugal( LIFE10NAT/ES/570), which began reintroducing this wild cat into western Sierra Morena and the Montes de Toledo (South-Central Spain) in 2014.",

            "text": "The cub was found seriously ill at a private country house in the municipality of Mazarambroz (Montes de Toledo, X396458, Y4382440 Central Spain), and was extremely weak and cachectic. The cub was trapped by field technicians working for the Government of Castilla-La Mancha and taken to the Wildlife Rehabilitation Center, where it died 29 h after admission, despite the intensive care provided. After death, a complete necropsy was performed at the CERI Wildlife Rehabilitation Center according to the work protocol established for this species (https://www.lynxexsitu.es/ ficheros/documentos.../Manual_Sanitario_Lince_Ib_2014. pdf). After a thorough external examination and the collection of body measurements, skin scrapes were taken from the cub's ears, face, and footpads for the detection and identification of ectoparasites, and blood was collected from its jugular vein for molecular and serological studies. The animal's skin was removed and thoroughly reviewed after necropsy, in small skin patches of 10 \u00d7 10 cm using an Olympus SZX9 (10-57\u00d7) magnifier for the detection and collection of ectoparasites. Several tissues (brain, heart, lungs, intestine, spleen, kidney, liver, and scapular lymph nodes) and skin samples from eight anatomical regions (ear, lip, nose, periorbital, forelimb, hind limb, belly, and back) were taken and stored in 10% neutral formalin for their subsequent histopathological and immunohistochemical analysis. Oropharyngeal and rectal swabs, in addition to samples of the brain, blood, heart, lung, intestine, spleen, kidney, and liver, were also collected for serological, parasitological, and molecular analyses regarding the different pathogen agents studied in the Iberian lynx, as previously described -Lehmann et al. 1996; Ramsauer et al. 2007; Meli et al. 2009 ). Liver and gastric content for toxicological analyses and excrements for parasitological studies were also collected. The subsequent parasitological and microbiological diagnostic analyses were performed at the BCentro de An\u00e1lisis y Diagn\u00f3stico de la Fauna Silvestre (CAD)^, M\u00e1laga-Andaluc\u00eda-, and the BServicio Regional de Investigaci\u00f3n y Desarrollo Agroalimentario (SERIDA)^, Gij\u00f3n-Asturias (Spain). It is important to mention here that N4-Keres' father (Kendo) was also the father to a contiguous family group (of which the mother was the female, Kuna). The data attained from the necropsy and subsequent diagnostic tests carried out on N4-Keres showed the need to study and treat the other members of its family pack, along with the members of the contiguous family group for mange, since Kendo was the father of both (see Table 1 ). Since the death of N4-Keres, all the lynxes captured and handled in the Montes de Toledo during 2016 and 2017 (n = 30) have been subjected to skin scrapings and a thorough review for the detection of dermal lesions. The adults were captured by using trap cages with bait. They were anesthetized in order to monitor their health status, and blood samples, scrapings of the ear and face, along with oropharyngeal and rectal swabs, were collected for PCR studies, after which they were fitted with tracking collars. The cubs were also captured, although they were not anesthetized. After being examined in the cage, scrapings were taken from their ears, and FelV vaccinations and transponder placements were carried out. The two family groups of the females Keres and Kuna and their male (Kendo) were treated in 2016 with Selamectin (cubs) and Ivermectin (adults, with the exception of Kuna, who was treated with Selamectin, Table 1) .",

With regard to the Iberian lynxes affected, self-trauma and alopecia were rarely observed in mangy Eurasian lynx, while alopecia was spotty and never generalized when present. The presence of numerous mites on skin scrapings and histological sections is also a common finding in the Eurasian lynx (Pence and Ueckerman 2002; Ryser-Degiorgis et al. 2002) . Histologically, the crusting dermatitis (with hyperkeratosis, acanthosis, and the degeneration of epidermal cells found on the skin) of N4-Keres agrees with the findings in the Eurasian lynx affected (Pence and Ueckerman 2002 ). An interesting immunohistochemical finding was the presence of positive immunolabeling of S. scabiei Ss\u03bb20\u0394B3 protein in the lymphocytes and macrophages of the skin samples from 6 of the 8 anatomical regions in N4-Keres (Table 3) .

In this respect, both the mandibular abscess and the luxation of the left knee joint should be considered as relevant findings from a clinical point of view. The subcutaneous mandibular abscess was apparently related to the fracture of the lower right canine (picture c, Fig. 1 ) and showed the existence of a fistula draining caudally through the right lower jaw, whose purulent material could also be related to the bronchopneumonia described. Furthermore, the ankylosed and apparently old luxation of the left knee joint prevented the correct flexure and extension of the left lower leg (Table 2, Fig. 1d ) for at least several weeks before death. Since this individual was in an area without supplementary feeding support at the moment of capture, both limitations in its movement (which could have triggered hunting problems) and mastication difficulties related to the mandibular lesions could, therefore, have caused feeding problems, thus favoring malnutrition, a severe weakening of its body condition, stress and immunosupression. Although we cannot rule out the possibility of N4-Keres having come into contact with S. scabiei previously and the fact that the disease could have had a greater effect over time, these concomitant immunosuppressive factors may explain why N4-Keres' body condition was worse than that of the other family members affected and the effect of S. scabiei was much more serious on it.",

These same reasons lead us to hypothesize that previous cases of the transmission of sarcoptic mange to Iberian lynxes may have occurred in the field before this first description, but could have gone unnoticed owing to the hypothetical ability of immunocompetent Iberian lynxes to control this mite, and taking into account that the features of dermal lesions reported in mangy lynxes could also have hidden the disease in the field. The absence of conspicuous alopecia (Ryser-Degiorgis et al. 2002) reported in lynxes affected by sarcoptic mange can make this illness difficult to detect in the field, even through the use of camera trapping. Camera traps are widely used to monitor the Iberian lynx in the field (Guil et al. 2010; Gil-S\u00e1nchez et al. 2011 ), but their use would, therefore, appear to be of little value for the detection of mange compatible lesions in this species. Nevertheless, these same camera traps can undoubtedly provide valuable information about sympatric red foxes and the presence of sarcoptic mange lesions on them (Oleaga et al. 2011) , thus warning about the increased risk of transmission from the red fox to the lynx on a local scale. It has been proposed that the presence of sympatric reservoirs (sarcoptic mange was confirmed in the necropsy of one red fox from the Montes de Toledo on May 25, 2016, unpublished data), together with a small population size and low genetic diversity, may increase disease-induced extinction risk for endangered species (Castro and Bolker 2005) .",

Sarcoptic mange was recently described in the wild European rabbit (Mill\u00e1n 2010) and wild rabbit population restocking has been identified as a potential means of dispersing or introducing sarcoptic mange into resident populations (Navarro-Gonz\u00e1lez et al. 2010) . Molecular based research on the features and origins of mites detected in the Iberian lynx is required, not only to identify health risks for this endangered species, but also for a better understanding of the pathogenesis and evolution of sarcoptic mange in this wild cat: the genetically based preference of S. scabiei for a particular host can determine the pathogenic effect of the parasite and the evolution of the disease in a new host (Kassen 2002; Rasero et al. 2010; Oleaga et al. 2013 ).",

This female cub was seriously ill, had an extremely poor body condition, and had been suffering concomitant problems for at least several weeks, which could have affected the nature and effectiveness of the immune response developed. Apart from N4-Keres, her brother, N3-Keres, was the only other lynx analyzed in which the presence of antibodies against S. scabiei was confirmed at necropsy. The Bweak^positive ELISA result (obtained for N3-Keres more than 200 days after its first handling, when the sarcoptic mange lesions and mites had been found and treated, Table 1) is difficult to interpret, and one of the possible explanations is a recent reinfection. More samples and research are necessary for a better adjustment and validation of the ELISA developed and a correct understanding of the Iberian lynx's humoral immune response against S. scabiei. Nevertheless, the promising results obtained suggest the value of the ELISA developed for the health surveillance of the Iberian lynx, and its possible usefulness as a monitoring tool for the detection and evaluation of exposure to S. scabiei of this species in the field over time.",

The thorough monitoring and frequent handlings to which Iberian lynxes are subjected could allow the capture and effective treatment of individual cases as it has been reported in other threatened species (Young et al. 1972; Pence et al. 1982 ), but the eradication of mange in the field is not feasible, since other affected sympatric species are abundant and are a possible frequent source of mites (Bornstein et al. 2001; Mill\u00e1n et al. 2007 ). In the specific case of the Iberian lynx, the use of ectoparasitic treatments should also take into account the existence and conservation needs of Felicola isidoroi, a host-specific louse of Lynx pardinus, which has been suggested to be scarcer and, therefore, even more endangered than its host (P\u00e9rez et al. 2013; J\u00f8rgensen 2014) .",

Data obtained in this first outbreak suggest a limited effect of S. scabiei on immunecompetent Iberian lynxes in the local population of the Montes de Toledo, at least during the first stages of the disease, and a good and apparently definitive recovery after treatment. However, a different evolution and relevance of sarcoptic mange in different populations, or even in the same one when confronted with immunosuppressive factors-such as other immunosuppressive infectious diseases-cannot be ruled out, which could trigger more serious consequences. In this respect, the fact that sarcoptic mange has been considered the most frequent infectious disease affecting the Eurasian lynx in Central Europe should warn us about its possible relevance for the Iberian lynx. Health surveillance works carried out on this wild cat and sympatric species that potentially share parasites with it are key tools for the early detection of health risks, and would, if necessary, allow the implementation of preventive or corrective measures. Further research is, therefore, required for a complete understanding of the epidemiology and real threat that this ectoparasitic disease may imply for L. pardinus.",
