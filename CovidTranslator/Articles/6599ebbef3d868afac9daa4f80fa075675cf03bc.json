The aviation industry has voiced similar concerns. Like many governments, the industry's current position is that it is opposed to emission levies, but supports emissions trading subject to certain conditions (e.g. it is introduced on the basis of mutual consent between participating nations and that the schemes are open and allow for permits to be traded with other sectors) (International Air Transport Association (IATA), 2008a, b).",

Further, under international aviation law, each country has complete and exclusive sovereignty over the airspace above their territory.

In addition, there are debates about how international aviation emissions should be allocated between countries and the most appropriate design of an emissions trading scheme that applies to the sector. The political problems that have hindered progress on international aviation emissions are not unique.

            "text": "One proposed solution is to use a radiative forcing index (RFI) (i.e. the ratio between the total radiative forcing from aviation and the radiative forcing associated with aviation CO 2 emissions) to devise a metric (often called an 'uplift factor'), which is used to estimate aviation CO 2 -e emissions. To do so, CO 2 emissions from aviation are multiplied by the uplift factor to provide an estimate of the total impact of aviation emissions in CO 2 -e. There is debate about the appropriateness of uplift factors and their use in policy processes. Questions have also been raised about what uplift factor should be applied. Recent studies indicate that the appropriate uplift factor could range between 1.7 and 5.1 times aviation CO 2 emissions depending on the timescales of the analysis (Forster et al., 2006; Sausen et al., 2005) . If the purpose is to provide an approximation of CO 2 -e using a 100-year timeframe, an uplift factor of 1.7 appears to be the best estimate, although it is subject to considerable uncertainty.",

These market dynamics are evident in the trends in international aviation since 1990 (see Fig. 3 ). International traffic growth rates have generally been responsive to global GDP over this period. Significant divergences between the two were witnessed in response to a number of external shocks, including the East Asian Financial Crisis in 1997-98, the September 11 terrorist attacks in 2001 (which coincided with the global economic slowdown in 2001-02) and the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak that began in November 2002.",

Based on the available science and informed by value judgments, many individuals and institutions have suggested that the threshold for dangerous climate change is an increase in the average surface temperature of between 1.7 and 2.5 1C above pre-industrial levels. 10 To have a reasonable chance of preventing global warming exceeding a 2 1C threshold, which is the most commonly cited target, the atmospheric concentration of greenhouse gases would have to be stabilised at less than 450 ppm CO 2 -e. Meeting this stabilisation target would require dramatic action. Global carbon emissions would have to be reduced by in excess of 60 per cent on 2000 levels by 2050 (IPCC, 2007) . The latest generation of climate models that account for climate-carbon cycle feedbacks suggest the required emission reductions may be greater than previously believed and that significant emission reductions may be necessary by 2030 just to keep the atmospheric concentrations of CO 2 below 450 ppm ($500-550 ppm CO 2 -e) (Friedlingstein et al., 2006; Meehl et al., 2007) .",

However, the extent of abatement that is necessary to ensure the increase in the global average surface temperature does not exceed 2 1C, and the speed at which it would have to occur, leaves little room for significant increases in emissions from any sector. Consequently, if there is a desire on behalf of policy makers to pursue a temperature target of around 2 1C, it is likely that steps will need to be taken in the near future to curb aviation emissions. International aviation emissions are of particular concern because of the speed at which demand is increasing and the political, legal and policy issues hindering the introduction of effective abatement measures.",

If an uplift factor of 1.7 is used to estimate total CO 2 -e emissions, the emission intensity model suggests international aviation emissions will be between 1488-1722 Mt in 2025. While the use of uplift factors is controversial, these figures illustrate the potential magnitude of the total climate impacts associated with international aviation.",

            "text": "The results for S1 and S2 from the emission intensity model are at the higher end of previous international aviation emission projections. Olsthoorn (2001) projected that international aviation CO 2 emissions will be 86-144 per cent above 1995 levels by 2020 (or 383-503 Mt) and 187-513 per cent above 1995 levels by 2050 (591-1263 Mt) if carbon is not priced. These results suggest that by 2025, emissions will be approximately 100-190 per cent above 1995 levels ($410-600 Mt CO 2 ). In comparison, the emission intensity model predicts that emissions will be 150-190 per cent above 1995 levels in 2025 (876-1013 Mt CO 2 ). The results from Olsthoorn's (2001) low and high emission growth scenarios (the Ecological and Schumpter scenarios (marked 'OE' and 'OS' respectively)) are shown in Fig. 5 , along side the results from the emission intensity model. Much of the difference in absolute numbers is attributable to Olsthoorn's (2001) lower estimate of emissions in 1995 (206 Mt CO 2 compared to the latest IEA estimate of 306 Mt CO 2 ). In relation to the proportional increases, the emission intensity model results overlap the upper end of the range in Olsthoorn (2001) . The higher estimates from the emission intensity model are due mainly to differences in economic growth rates, which are a major determinant of aviation demand. The scenarios in Olsthoorn (2001) assumed annual global real GDP growth of 1.6-3.1 per cent. The ICAO traffic forecast used in the emission intensity model assumed real GDP growth of 3.5 per cent to 2025. Owen and Lee (2006) provide another source of comparison. The report, which was prepared for the UK Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA), projected scheduled domestic and international aviation CO 2 emissions over the period 2000-2050. The traffic forecasts prepared by the FESG for the sixth meeting of ICAO's Committee on Aviation Environmental Protection (CAEP/6) were used as the basis for the projections to 2020 (Wickrama et al., 2003) . Traffic forecasts for 2020-2050 were developed using a non-linear Verhulst logistic model derived from the historical relationship between aviation traffic and GDP between 1960 and 1995. The model was applied using the GDP growth rates from the IPCC's A1 and B2 SRES scenarios. The results suggest that scheduled international aviation CO 2 emissions will increase from approximately 240 projections and those from the current study are primarily due to a lower base year fuel quantity estimate in Owen and Lee (2006) and differences in scope (i.e. Owen and Lee (2006) exclude nonscheduled traffic, which is likely to have reduced their estimates by approximately 10 per cent). As discussed in Section 4, a number of long-range global aviation emission projections have been prepared. Vedantham and Oppenheimer (1998) Fig. 6 compares the results from the emission intensity model to selected adjusted results from Vedantham and Oppenheimer (1998) , Eyers et al. (2004) , Horton (2006) and Berghof et al. (2005) . The international component of the global estimates from these studies was estimated by assuming that international civil aviation CO 2 emissions are proportional to the international share of global scheduled traffic. The international/domestic traffic shares were devised using the ICAO (2007b) traffic forecasts. 12 From Vedantham and Oppenheimer (1998) , only the basedemand level projections for the IS92a (IPCC base case), IS92c (low growth) and IS92e (high growth) scenarios are shown (marked 'IS92a', etc.). Their high-demand projections were excluded because they currently appear to be less plausible than the base-demand projections. From Berghof et al. (2005) , only the Unlimited Skies (ULS) and Regulatory Push and Pull (RPP) scenarios are shown (marked as 'CONSAVE-ULS' and 'CONSAVE-RPP'). The other two scenarios from Berghof et al. (2005) (Fractured World (FW) 13 and Down to Earth (DtE) 14 ) were considered less likely. From Horton (2006) , only the Case 3 (or base case) outcomes are shown (marked 'AERO2k-H') because Cases 1 and 2 were theoretical cases based on no change in fuel efficiency, while Cases 4 and 5 were dependent on the imposition of carbon prices. The results from Eyers et al. (2004) are marked as 'AERO2k-E'.",

For Vedantham and Oppenheimer (1998) , the estimates of military emissions were derived using the nominal growth rates adopted in the study. 13 FW assumed security concerns and a move away from global integration obstruct traffic growth. 14 DtE assumed there is an aggressive push for greater environmental protection. 15 In reality, the international proportion of the estimates of global aviation emissions is likely to be lower than indicated in Fig. 6 .

Yet history has shown that demand growth generally outstrips emission intensity gains. Whether this trend continues in the future is unknown. However, the available evidence suggests international aviation emissions are unlikely to be stabilised unless there is a radical shift in technology or demand is restricted. 1 9 9 0 1 9 9 2 1 9 9 4 1 9 9 6 1 9 9 8 2 0 0 0 2 0 0 2 2 0 0 4 2 0 0 6 2 0 0 8 2 0 1 0 2 0 1 2 2 0 1 4 2 0 1 6 2 0 1 8 2 0 2 0 2 0 2 2 2 0 2 4 2 0 2 6 2 0 2 8 2 0 3 0 To demonstrate this, two hypothetical scenarios (S3 and S4) were developed using the traffic forecasts outlined in Table 3.

S4 was the same as S3, only the object was to determine by how much the emission intensity of international aviation would have to improve in order to stabilise CO 2 emissions at their 2005 levels by 2025 (i.e. 416 Mt).",

Without the imposition of carbon prices on international flights to suppress demand, it seems unlikely that international aviation emissions will be able to be kept below 850 Mt CO 2 by 2025 (i.e. more than 100 per cent above 2005 levels). International aviation CO 2 emissions are only likely to stay below this level if one or more of the following events occur: a prolonged global economic slowdown; an international shock, such as a major international conflict, pandemic or a substantial increase in the price of oil; or the emergence and rapid deployment of new emission saving technology. While more efficient aircraft are currently being rolled out (e.g. A380 and B787), the fuel efficiency gains associated with the latest generation of aircraft are unlikely to be sufficient to offset the increases in international demand. Moreover, international aircraft have relatively long commercial lifetimes (typically 15-35 years) (ICAO, 2007c) . Without aggressive policy measures to promote the deployment of state-of-the-art technology, the slow rate of turnover in the fleet will hinder progress on curbing emissions growth.",

To date, it has been able to deflect calls for the imposition of effective abatement measures, successfully arguing that it is only a minor cause of global warming and that it has achieved admirable advances in emission intensity since the early 1990s. The cause of the industry has been aided by a lack of political will and legal and policy disputes about how best to address emissions from international aviation.",

This proposal has been met with near universal opposition from non-EU countries. At this point, it is unclear whether the EU will go ahead with its scheme and defy the international community. However, its willingness to propose the scheme is a sign of the intensity of the pressure for more action to be taken to contain the growth in emissions.",

Projections based on ICAO's (2007) traffic forecast suggest international aviation CO 2 emissions will increase by between 111 and 144 per cent between 2005 and 2025 (i.e. from 416 Mt to between 876 and 1013 Mt). These projections are at the upper end of previous estimates, primarily because of an increase in forecast economic growth, higher base year emission estimates and broader coverage. It should also be emphasised that they are confined to CO 2 emissions and do not account for emissions of other gases and particles like H 2 O and NO x . If an uplift factor of 1.7 is used to estimate total CO 2 -e emissions, the emission intensity model suggests international aviation emissions will be between 1488 and 1722 Mt in 2025.",

Historic and projected emission intensity improvements 1996-2025. more than 100 per cent between 2005 and 2025, the emission intensity of international aviation would have to fall by 32 per cent, requiring an average annual decrease of 1.9 per cent. To stabilise emissions at 2005 levels, the emission intensity would have to be improved by 65 per cent, necessitating an average annual decrease of 5.2 per cent. With current technology, emission intensity improvements of this magnitude appear unlikely. Further action on international aviation emissions is likely to be necessary if the international community wants to keep the increase in the global average surface temperature to less than 2 1C. Under current policy settings, emissions are likely to increase significantly unless there is a major global economic downturn or other shock to the aviation market.",

The warming arises because aviation NO x emissions result in the production of ozone (O 3 ) (a greenhouse gas) in the troposphere. The cooling effects arise because chemical reactions associated with NO x remove methane (CH 4 ) (a greenhouse gas) from the atmosphere O emissions have three main impacts. H 2 O emitted from aircraft builds up in the lower stratosphere and traps infrared radiation, leading to warming. Aviation H 2 O emissions create contrails, which act like clouds and trap heat. Contrails created by aircraft can lead to the creation of cirrus clouds, which also leads to warming SO x emissions lead to the formation of sulphur aerosols, which reflect solar radiation and thereby cool the atmosphere. They can also have indirect effects by altering cloud formation. The radiative forcing estimates only consider the direct effects\u00c03.5 Fair Soot Soot can act as a warming agent by trapping and radiating heat. It can also have indirect warming effects by altering the albedo (reflectivity) of the earth's surface. The radiative forcing estimates only consider the direct effects Source: Sausen et al. (2005). a mW/m 2 means milliwatt or 10 \u00c03 W per square metre. These data were derived from returns made by approximately 55 per cent of IATA member airlines, who were responsible for around 70 per cent of total global RTK over the relevant period. 6 Some of the observed change in the emission intensity of the international task may be due to data errors that are attributable to the poor quality of aviation statistics, particularly in the early 1990s. However, there is considerable evidence supporting a sharp improvement in fuel efficiency and emission intensity over this period. For example, data from ICAO indicate that the fuel efficiency of the scheduled international task (excluding operations of airlines registered in the Commonwealth of Independent States) fell from 53.5 in 1985 to 36.1 L/100 RTK in 2005, a 33 per cent improvement (ICAO, 2007b). 7 ATM and aircraft and engine design improvements have reduced fuel burn per available seat kilometre by approximately 70 per cent since the 1960s (ICAO, 2007c; IPCC, 1999).Although there are differences in the estimates, the weight of evidence suggests that total global civil aviation CO 2 emissions rose from approximately 400 Mt in 1990 to at least 650 Mt in 2004 (International Energy Agency(IEA), 2007b, c; IPCC, 1999;Kim et al., 2005).
