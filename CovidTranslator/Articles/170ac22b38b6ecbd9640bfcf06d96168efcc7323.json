            "text": "Procalcitonin, a 14-kDa protein encoded by the Calc-1 gene along with calcitonin and kataclacin, is an innovative diagnostic parameter with kinetics different from other presently available indicators of the inflammatory response. 6 In the animal model, hyperprocalcitoninemia was an early systemic marker of sepsis which correlated closely with severity of acute illness and mortality. 7 Studies of its behavior in patients with bacterial sepsis have found it to be a useful marker of systemic bacterial infection, with greater specificity and sensitivity than acute phase proteins such as C-reactive protein, interleukin-6 and lactate levels even in a medical intensive care unit setting. 8, 9 The excellent specificity and negative predictive value at a cut-off point of 0.5 ng/ml suggests that this test might be a useful parameter in the management of infectious diseases. 10 PCT can help to identify an infectious cause or complication in patients with systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). 11 It has also been used to distinguish infectious from non-infectious causes of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). 12 It is moderately increased in local bacterial infection (pneumonia, pyelonephritis), parasitic and fungal infections and is unchanged or only slightly increased in even severe viral infections. 13 -18 A serum PCT level of , 0.4 ng/ml accurately rules out the diagnosis of bacteraemia. 19 Children with bacterial pneumonia had significantly higher PCT than those with sole viral aetiology. 20 PCT has also similarly high diagnostic value in both immunosuppressed and non-immunosuppressed patients with sepsis or severe infections. 21 -23 SARS is an emerging infectious disease by a novel coronavirus-SARS-CoV which is associated with pneumonia with global impact. 24 It is notable that nearly 40% of the patients developed respiratory failure that required assisted ventilation. In the ICU setting, SARS is essentially ARDS plus intensified respiratory isolation. 25 The clinical presentation and radiologic features of SARS bear some resemblance to the syndrome commonly referred to as 'atypical pneumonia'. The high incidence of altered liver function, leucopenia, severe lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and subsequent evolution into adult respiratory distress syndrome suggest a severe systemic inflammatory damage induced by this human pneumonia-associated coronavirus. 26 The constellation of absence of upper respiratory symptoms, the presence of dry cough, and minimal auscultatory findings with consolidations on chest radiographs may alert the clinician to the possible diagnosis of SARS. However, the clinical and radiographic characteristics of atypical pneumonia are not useful in differentiating these pathogens from usual bacterial pathogens such as S. penumoniae and H. influenzae. Clinical diagnosis also becomes particularly problematic once the association with travel or case contact is lost. The difficulty of making a firm diagnosis until chest radiographic changes appear has important implications for healthcare personnel and for surveillance.",

This is consistent with the current evidence that SARS is just another viral pneumonia. High initial levels of PCT may be used to exclude SARS to a certain degree of accuracy whereas low PCT in relevant clinical context may prompt further testing for SARS.
