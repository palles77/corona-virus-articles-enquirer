            "text": "Embryonated eggs were coinfected with two strains of the coronavirus avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), IBV-Beaudette and IBV-M41, to investigate whether recombination between the two strains would occur. Virions were isolated from the allantoic fluid of the coinfected eggs and putative hybrid RNAs were detected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), using strain-specific oligonucleotides. PCR products, of the expected sizes, were obtained as predicted from potential recombination events between the nucleoprotein (N) gene and the 3-untranslated region of the two IBV genomes. Sequencing confirmed that they corresponded to hybrid RNAs. Virus produced as a result of the mixed infection was treated with an M41-specific neutralizing monoclonal antibody and passaged in Vero cells, in which IBV-Beaudette, but not IBV-M41, replicated. Hybrid RNA was still detectable after three serial passages. Since no IBV-M41 was detectable this confirmed that infectious recombinant genomes had been produced in the embryonated eggs. These findings not only support the circumstantial evidence, from sequencing studies of IBV field strains, that recombination occurs during replication of IBV and contributes to the diversity of IBV, but also show that coronavirus RNA recombination is not limited to mouse hepatitis virus. \u1b67",

To detect The technique of strain-specific PCR has been shown to be an extremely powerful method for distinguishing hybrid IBV RNAs, following as little selection pressure as possible, we used RT-PCR on virion RNAs produced between closely related virus strains (Banner and Lai, 1991; Jarvis and Kirkegaard, 1992) and opens the possi-from the mixed infections without passage. This method also allowed the detection of potential hybrid RNAs de-bility of detecting potential recombinants in the absence of selection.

An alternative explanation for the detection of hybrid nants using strain-specific PCR. Although oligonucleotide M8 had only two nucleotide mismatches in relation RNA molecules in this study is that they were not derived from genomic RNAs but from subgenomic RNAs, as small to the corresponding Beaudette sequence, the oligonucleotide was shown to be specific for M41. This is in amounts of subgenomic mRNAs were detected in IBV preparations (Zhao et al., 1993) . However, such mole-agreement with the observation that an oligonucleotide with three nucleotide mismatches at the 3 end was cules would still have been generated by recombination.

Previous studies on the effects of primer-sulting in the production of hybrid genomes, would require the demonstration that hybrid RNAs can be pas-template mismatches in PCR revealed that double nucleotide mismatches at the 3 end of an oligonucleotide saged.
