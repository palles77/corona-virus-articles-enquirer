Following the index case, a 68-year-old man, who was diagnosed on May 20, 2015, 186 confirmed cases were reported by July 5, 2015 (Fig 1) . In total 14,702 persons were quarantined at some point between May 20 and July 3, 2015. These were voluntary quarantine recommendations, which advise that persons who have had contact with a confirmed case of MERS since onset of illness should quarantine themselves at home or in a health care facility for 14 days. 1 All contacts have their health status monitored daily 1 but are provided with basic necessities and financial compensation for the loss of income during the period of quarantine. Contacts who develop symptoms during the quarantine period will be isolated to receive early treatment, whereas those reporting no illness after the 14day quarantine will be released from further monitoring. 1 However, these voluntary recommendations were often ignored, leading to public outcries in Korea as well as China and Hong Kong, 2,3 and calls for punitive legislation for travelers who make false health declarations. 2 We conducted a population survey during the outbreak of MERS in Korea to investigate public risk perceptions of MERS and attitudes towards quarantine in controlling MERS among households in the Republic of Korea.",

Inclusion criteria were being able to communicate in Korean and capable of answering a telephone interview. Within each eligible household, 1 adult aged 18 years or older whose birthday was closest to the survey date was invited to participate in the study. Unanswered household telephone numbers were called at different times and days for up to 4 times before replacement with new numbers. More than 70% of the calls were made after 6:00 p.m. to avoid oversampling of the nonworking population. Respondents agreeing to participate completed a telephone interview based on a standardized questionnaire.",

Internal consistency (Cronbach's a) for the above core measures was generally acceptable ranging from 0.61 (for perceived social norms in MERS prevention) to 0.90 (for perceived susceptibility to MERS and worry about MERS) ( Table 1 ). The items used to assess each core measure are detailed in Appendix Table S1 . Mean scores and/or proportions of risk perception variables and attitudes toward quarantine were calculated and their variability by age, gender, and educational attainment was assessed using multivariate logistic/linear regression models.",

In such circumstances, trust in the government is likely to plunge as initial confusion about sources of infection and efforts to understand and control outbreaks sees numbers of cases rocket. 9 Distrust was perhaps amplified by government's initial attempt to withhold the names of hospitals involved in treating the first batch of infected patients, which were the main sources of subsequent infection, particularly among higher-educated and younger people who may easily access information from other sources, such as the Internet.",

Most Korean respondents perceived social conformity pressure to adopt protective behaviors. Norms may be behavior cues to motivate adoption of protective behaviors and commonly widespread social distancing behaviors. 7, 10 Despite a small sample size constrained by time and no funding, this survey provides useful insights on why frequent quarantine breaking occurred during this active outbreak. The findings also point to an urgent need for both improved public education on voluntary quarantine adherence and greater risk communication transparency by public health agencies, not only in South Korea, but also globally.",
