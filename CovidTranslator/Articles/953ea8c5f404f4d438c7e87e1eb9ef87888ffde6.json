Antiviral genes (encoding antisense RNA or viral protein) derived from Simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) were efficiently targeted into CD4+ lymphocytes through retroviral-mediated gene transfer. After challenging with infectious viruses, the transduced lymphocytes that received antiviral genes were not only protected from SIV infection, but also from infection with HIV, for at least 25 days. Furthermore, little or no cytolytic effect (syncytium formation) was observed in the protected cells. These data demonstrated that SIV or HIV replication could be effectively blocked by antisense sequence(s) or negative dominant factors which were introduced into targeted cells through retroviral-mediated gene transfer.",

The procedure would be initiated by taking bone marrow cells, including the hematopoietic stem cells, from an HIV-infected individual. The stem cells would be transduced with a recombinant virus that encoded an antiviral gene (an RNA or protein) which was capable of dominantly interfering with the intracellular growth of HIV. The modified stem cells would then be injected back into the patient where they would return to the marrow. If only a small number of specific subsets of bone marrow cells are infected with HIV in the infected individual [16, 31] , it is conceivable that, after targeting an antiviral gene, protected ceils would be selected by a virus specific cytotoxic-effect to dominate the body's hematopoietic system. This approach would probably be suitable for already infected individuals where its purpose would be therapeutic. Inhibition of HIV replication in varying degrees by antisense RNA as well as sense RNA has been shown [15, 26, 29] . We now report that using a murine retroviral vector [10, 11, 13] , an anti-SIV gene can be efficiently delivered into a cultured human CD 4 + cell line in which it can effectively block SIV and HIV replication. This report represents the first step towards the application of antisense/sense gene therapy approach in an animal model.",

A possible explanation is that splicing donor (nt 6853) and acceptor (nt 9062) sites in the sense RNA of env region resulted in the spliced RNA being more favourably packaged into viral particles. The Northern RNA analysis also supports this hypothesis (Fig. 3 ).",

The RNA blots were probed with [32p]labeled env, pol, and neo specific probes, respectively. The full-length RNA encoding antisense of env region, as well as spliced neo RNA, was seen in the SIVenv-transduced HuT-78 cells, but only spliced RNA encoding neo gene was seen in the SIVenv + transduced HUT-78 cells (Fig. 3) . For SIVgp + and SIVgp -transduced cells, both full-length (8 kb) and spliced RNA (2.5 kb) were seen (Fig. 4) . The ratio of full-length and spliced RNA was different in the SIVgp -transduced HuT-78 in the presence or absence of G418. In the presence of G418, the spliced RNA encoding the neo gene became dominant (Fig. 4, lane 1) . A 2.7 kb RNA, which comigrated with neo spliced RNA, also hybridized to the pol probe in the SIVgp + transduced HUT-78 cells (Fig. 4 B, lane 3) . This 2.7 kb RNA could be the splicing intermediate of the full-length transcript of the SIVgp +. The slightly different size of spliced RNA transcripts could be due to the distortion by 28S ribosomal RNA during blotting, or different lengths of potyadenylation. Repeated experiments with prolonged electrophoresis showed that the size difference was minimal. This data indicated that the presence of G418 in the growth medium influenced the steady state level of primary RNA transcripts.",

The HUT-78 cells transduced with antisense constructs of gag-pol and env regions were effectively protected (no RT activity) from SIVmac infection for more than 20 days when compared to cells transduced with the corresponding sense constructs. The viral activity (RT) from cells transduced with sense construct ofgag-pol region was lower than that from cells transduced with sense construct of env region (Fig. 5 A) . The partial interference could be due to the gag and polymerase proteins expressed in SIVgp + transduced cells (data not shown). The mechanism of partial interference is unclear. The higher RT in the control, untransduced HUT-78 cells, could be due to slightly higher cell number and/or G418 selection in transduced cells. There was little or no cytopathic effect (syncytium formation) in protected cells (cells transduced with SIVenv-and SIVgp-) compared to that in unprotected cells (high degree of syncytium formation in cells transduced with SIVenv +), at 20 days postinfection. Interestingly, there was little or no inhibition of SIVmac replication and strong cytopathic effect in SIVgp-transduced HUT-78 cells when culture was maintained in G418 selection (Figs. 5 B and 6) . When the fraction of pooled transduced cells was infected with HIV-1, cells transduced with sense and antisense constructs ofgag-pol region were effectively protected from viral infection. Almost no viral replication was observed in SIVgp + transduced cells and minimal viral replication was observed in SIVgptransduced cells (Fig. 5 C) . The slightly higher background RT activity (approximately 3 000 cpm/ml) in SIVgp + transduced cells was derived from the empty SIVmac viral particles (data not shown). Cells transduced with antisense and sense constructs of the env region were not effectively protected. It should be noted that significant cytopathic effect (approximately 90%) was observed in unprotected cells at 25 days postinfection. Therefore, the RT assay was terminated after 25 days. To study the mechanism of nearly complete protection of HIV-1 infection, the cellular DNA was extracted from the cells harvested at 25 days postinfection and subjected to PCR analysis. In agreement with the RT results, no HIV-1 proviralpol sequence and little HIV-1 proviralpol sequence can be detected in the SIVgp+ and SIVgp-challenged cells, respectively (Fig. 7) . The sensitivity of this PCR analysis is less than 5 copies per sample (data not shown). The inability to detect HIV-1 proviral sequence in SIVgp + transduced cells could be due to the cell death of small number of infected cells in which complete viral replication is blocked but expression of HIV-1 env gene is normal. When HIV-2 was used as the challenging virus [4] , similar results were obtained (data not shown). All of these challenging experiments were repeated at least twice. The results shown were the mean of two initial experiments. Subsequent experiments performed several months later also demonstrated similar results. These data suggested that there might be different mechanisms by which transduced cells were protected from SIVmac and HIV-1 (or HIV-2) infections.",

Restriction endonuclease mapping and sequence analyses of HIV [24] and SIV [3] isolates, as well as the patterns of neutralization of different isolates by antibodies, also demonstrate genetic diversity, particularly in the envelope glycoprotein [6] . The genetic variation is a major obstacle to the design of vaccines or therapeutic agents effective to different variants. SIV macaque isolate shares about 55% amino acid sequence identity with HIV-1 in the gag and pol genes and less than 31% in the env gene [25] . Our studies have demonstrated that an antiviral gene (antisense RNA or viral gene) can be delivered to CD 4 + cells by means of a retroviral-mediated gene transfer technique. The transduced cells were not only protected from parental viral infection (SIV, macaque and sooty mangabey isolates), but also from other related viral infections (HIV-1 and HIV-2). The mechanisms by which the retroviral vectors inhibited the replication of immunodeficiency viruses is not clear. One possible mechanism is that the antisense RNA binds to the viral RNA before reverse transcription occurs or arrests translation of targeted mRNA. In the transduced cells expressing SIVmac associated gag and poI polypeptides, the SIVmac poly~eptides may function as mutant peptides, which may interact with HIV polypeptides, and inhibit HIV replication by interfering virus assembly [33] .",

From our Northern anNysis, there is no significant difference in RNA levels in those transduced cells expressing antisense and sense RNA. These data suggest that the effectiveness of the antisense RNA inhibition could be related to the size of antisense sequences. Since the viral titers used for the challenge in the previous experiments were not clearly defined, a correlation can not be drawn between these experiments. Recently, Sczakiel etal. [30] have shown effective long-term inhibition of HIV-1 by antisense RNA when a low M.O.I. of challenging virus was used. The effective inhibition of SIV and HIV replication in this report may also be due to low M.O.I. used.",
