While current trends (2014-2017) indicate fewer reported terrorist attacks, the world has seen an increase of terrorist activity since September 11, 2001 [1] . Terrorism or other antagonistic incidents however, are only one type of event that may cause large numbers of casualties. Indeed, a broad spectrum of incidents (technological, natural and social) cause disasters. Globally, the number of reported disasters has increased [2] . With approximately 220 million people affected worldwide and 85 million people affected by disasters in Europe and North America in 2016 alone, the cost of human suffering in terms of death, illness and injury is incalculable [3, 4] .",

            "text": "Disasters, according to the United Nations are events that \"exceed the ability of the affected community to cope using its own resources\" meaning medical needs exceed health care's ability and resources to maintain adequate care for everyone. The goal of health care during disasters shifts to maintaining adequate care for the greatest number of patients [5, 6] . A major incident (MI) is similar to that of a disaster, with the main difference being that quality care for everyone is maintained through adequate redistribution and allocation of resources [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] . Emergency departments are vital components in mitigating the effects of disasters or major incidents. Disasters/MIs often result in mass causalities at the incident site, with many victims requiring pre-hospital assessment and care. However, a large number of patients, often described as self-presenters, arrive at the emergency department (ED) without pre-hospital assessment [12] . When a MI occurs, ED departments may be required to quickly increase their operational capacity to receive, prioritize and treat the rapid flow of patients. This ability to increase the capacity of the ED to manage the sudden influx of patients is a hospital's surge capacity [13, 14] . With escalating waiting times and crowding at EDs [15] affecting surge capacity negatively, front line health care workers' skills, knowledge and abilities are essential.",

This Delphi study commenced with items from a previously developed study containing disaster nursing competencies utilizing a three-round modified Delphi technique [20] . Three rounds are generally accepted as adequate for a modified Delphi analysis due to the risk of study fatigue. The study was concluded after the final round as pre-determined and agreed upon by the authors and experts [28] .",

The expert panel in this study was comprised of experts with various focal points within the field of disaster/emergency medicine. The selection of experts with varying backgrounds within the same field minimizes bias as well as ensures that vital viewpoints encompassing several aspects of disaster preparedness are represented [34] . The majority of the experts had several years of experience within the field of disaster medicine and many were clinically active, using disaster related competencies on a daily basis. This ensures that the panel of experts' opinion adequately represents the competencies required for adequate disaster response of ED registered nurses in the study's examined region.",

The results of this Delphi study indicate the importance of nursing competencies concerning detection of and response to an event (all items reached consensus) possibly further recognizing the ED nurse as first responders. Indeed, all items concerning \"issues in triage\" reached consensus as well perhaps further indicating ED nurses' roles in initial care as vital. Also, worth noting is expert consensus concerning registering of patients during a MI. As previously mentioned, a surge of patients may require modified techniques for receiving, triaging and treating patients. The existing methods of patient intake may be inadequate. This harmonizes with findings by the Stockholm city council concerning actions taken by hospitals during the terrorist attack on April 7th l 2017 concluding that routines for registering patients during a MI need to be assessed [42] .",

However, while EPIQ has been utilized and tested, pre-conditions motivated the need to not simply translate the questionnaire but to critically review and adjust EPIQ for the current setting. After comparing the EPIQ questionnaire to Sweden's specific risk and hazards report [46] as well as the now defunct National Board of Health and Welfare's description of RN's competencies [17] and deeming it to be broadly representative for Swedish ED RNs, attention was turned to construction of statements.
