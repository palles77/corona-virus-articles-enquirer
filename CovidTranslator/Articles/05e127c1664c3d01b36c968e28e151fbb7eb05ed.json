He described 50 children with a typical constellation of clinical findings that did not fit into any known medical condition. He christened the disease as 'Mucocutaneous lymph node syndrome'. 3 Soon thereafter Marian Melish from Hawaii, United States, reported cases with similar clinical findings. KD is now reported from all continents and is considered to be one of the commonest vasculitic disorders in children.",

In North America and Europe the incidence of KD has stabilized and varies between 9 and 25/100,000 children below 5. 4, 5 There has been no perceptible increase in incidence on a decadal basis in these regions. On the other hand, countries in the Far East (like Japan, Korea and Taiwan) have been showing an increasing incidence on a decadal basis. In Japan the reported annual incidence is 265/100,000 children below 5 and this is the highest incidence reported so far from anywhere in the world. 6 Korea reports an incidence of 134.4 7 while in Taiwan the figure is 82.8. 8 Japan has reported three welldocumented nationwide epidemics of KD in the years 1979, 1982 and 1986 . 5 A hospital based study at Chandigarh had shown the incidence to be 4.54/100,000 children below 15, but this was probably an underestimate. 9 KD appears to have some predilection for children of Asian ancestry. Studies from the United Kingdom have shown that the incidence was more than double in Asian children when compared to Caucasian and African children. 1, 10 KD predominantly affects children in the pre-school age group with 80% children being below 5. KD is uncommon below 3 months of age, although it has been reported even in neonates. 11 In Japan, the highest incidence occurs in 9-11 months old boys and 3-8 months old girls, whereas in North America, peak age is 2-3 years. 1 In India, almost onethird of children with KD are reported to be above 5 years. 12 KD affects boys more commonly than girls, with male-tofemale ratio varying between 1.36:1 and 1.62:1. 1 Seasonal incidence has been noted in several countries. In Japan more cases are seen in the months of January and July. 1 At Chandigarh, peak incidence is seen in the months of May and October with a nadir in February. 12,13",

            "text": "It has been suggested that a 'genetic predisposition' facilitates the development of KD in the context of an appropriate infectious insult. 1 Exciting new work on understanding the pathogenesis of KD has unraveled the role of several signaling pathways, which have improved our understanding of this fascinating disease. 25 The pathway associated with calcineurin-nuclear factor of activated T-cells was one of the first that was studied in this regard. This pertains to a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) on chromosome 19q13.2 which affects the gene for 1,4,5-trisphosphate 3-kinase C. This SNP has been linked to increased susceptibility to KD. A direct clinical correlate has been the use of calcineurin inhibitors in patients with refractory KD. The pathway associated with transforming growth factor-b (TGFb) signaling has been linked to increased risk of coronary artery abnormalities (CAAs). A direct clinical correlate of this has been the initiation of clinical trials for use of atorvastatin in KD. The third pathway relates to a SNP in the FCGR2A that has been identified in KD patients of European descent and appears to influence susceptibility to this disease. 26 Given the differences in genetic background between Caucasians and populations residing in the Far East, it is quite likely that the genetic basis of KD in Japan may turn out to be very different from, say, that in the United States. And that may also partly explain the differences in clinical phenotype of KD that have been reported from various parts of the world.",

Many other arteries can also be involvedthese include the subclavian, brachial, axillary, iliac or femoral vessels, and occasionally the abdominal aorta and renal arteries. The acute stage of KD lasts approximately 2-3 weeks and is characterized by edema of endothelial and smooth muscle cells with an inflammatory cell infiltrate, which is initially polymorphonuclear and later replaced by macrophages, lymphocytes (primarily CD8+ T cells) and plasma cells. The inflammatory process affects all three layers of the vascular wall, with destruction of internal as well as external elastic lamina. When the weakened arterial wall can no longer withstand its internal pressure, it becomes dilated and deformed, thereby leading on to aneurysm formation. Thrombi may develop in the vascular lumen further obstructing the blood flow. Over time, healing occurs in the vessel wall and this results in fibrosis and marked intimal proliferation which may manifest on imaging as stenotic lesions.",

Kim in a review article 29 used 'atypical' and 'incomplete' KD interchangeably. Characteristic echocardiographic evidences of CAAs support the diagnosis of KD in such cases. The term 'incomplete' is preferred when there are less than 4 principal criteria and 'atypical' is preferred when presentation is unusual (stroke, nephritis, cardiac tamponade, hepatitis, etc.). 'Incomplete' KD is more common in young infants. High degree of suspicion is necessary in these group of patients for diagnosis of KD as the incidence of CAAs is higher among them. It may be noted that children with 'incomplete' or 'atypical' KD are not at lesser risk of coronary artery involvement as compared to children with typical KD.",

Rarely neutropenia can occur. 1 The platelet count is usually normal in the first week of illness. Thrombocytopenia, which may appear during early phase of the disease, is a significant risk factor for development of coronary artery aneurysm. Presence of thrombocytopenia in KD indicates development of disseminated intravascular coagulation or macrophage activation syndrome. 28, 35 Thrombocytosis, which is characteristic of the disease, usually appears in the second week, and peaks in the third week. In uncomplicated cases platelet count gradually normalizes by 4-8 weeks. The mean peak platelet count is 7,00,000/mm 3 but, it may be as high as (even more than) 1 million/mm 3 . Anemia, which is normocytic and normochromic, can be detected in 50% of patients within the first 2 weeks of illness. It is more common with prolonged active inflammation and a significant predictor of development of CAAs. 28, 36 Urine examination: Sterile pyuria, usually of urethral origin can be found in 33% of patients with KD. 13 Biochemical abnormalities: Up to 40% of patients with KD can have mild elevations of transaminases and in 10% there can be hyperbilirubinemia. 28 Hypoalbuminemia is more common and its presence indicates a severe form of disease. Several alterations in the serum lipid profile have been described in children with KD, and some of these may persist for several months after the acute episode. 28 Cerebrospinal fluid examination (CSF): CSF examination is not mandatory for the diagnosis of KD. In 50% of patients it demonstrates mononuclear cell predominance with normal glucose and protein levels (aseptic meningitis). 28 Imaging studies. Echocardiography: Two dimensional echocardiography remains the gold standard for detection of CAAs in KD. During the acute stage the coronary arteries appear 'bright' on echocardiography. CAAs include aneurysms, ectasia and stenoses. For accurate assessment of CAAs, Z scores need to be calculated. However, echocardiography has some significant limitations. It is highly operator dependent and there is no gainsaying the fact that inaccuracies may creep in if the operator is not appropriately trained. Further, performing echocardiography on a sick and irritable child requires skill and patience. Echocardiography can only delineate the proximal sections of coronary arteries, and the circumflex artery may be very difficult to view. Dual source CT coronary angiography: This is a recent advancement in the accurate detection of CAAs in patients with KD with minimal radiation risk. The important advantage over echocardiography is its ability to detect proximal as well as distal arterial abnormalities. With modern technologies available with such machines the radiation dose can be reduced to minimal levels (<1 mSv). 37 At our center, we have started carrying out this investigation in cases wherein echocardiographic findings are equivocal. We have also used this modality for follow-up of patients with large CAAs detected on echocardiography.",

The precise mechanism of action of IVIg in KD, however, is not clearly understood. The dose of IVIg is 2 g/kg given as single infusion. Treatment is most effective when instituted within 10 days of illness. However, it has also been noted that initiation of IVIg treatment before Day 5 of fever can sometimes result in refractory KD and this may mandate additional therapy. 28 Vaccination against varicella and measles should be deferred till 11 months post IVIg.",

In such cases an increase in 'z' scores of the coronary arteries may mandate additional therapy. In cases where the response to IVIg has been satisfactory, follow-up echocardiography examinations are recommended at 4-6 weeks after onset of the disease. Further evaluation of coronary arteries depends upon their status on follow-up. Angiographic resolution of coronary aneurysms observed in 50-67% of patients by 1-2 years after the illness. 28, 29 The likelihood of resolution is greater if size is smaller, age at onset <1 year, fusiform i n d i a n j o u r n a l o f r h e u m a t o l o g y 1 0 ( 2 0 1 5 ) s 7 8 -s 8 3 aneurysm and location of aneurysm at distal coronary segment.

It should be considered in the differential diagnosis of all children with fever persisting beyond 5 days. As the clinical presentation can be very variable, it is not difficult to understand how the diagnosis of KD can often be delayed or missed altogether. KD is a medical emergency. Delays in diagnosis and initiation of appropriate therapy can have catastrophic consequences. Most of the CAAs regress over time but, giant aneurysms are less likely to resolve. Structural and functional abnormalities in the arterial segment may, however, persist even after regression of the aneurysm.",

In some children arthritis of one or several joints can develop. CAAs are most commonly seen during this phase. Convalescent phase: By this time, all clinical signs have generally disappeared. This phase lasts for approximately 6 weeks. By the end of this phase, the acute phase reactants (especially the CRP and the elevated platelet counts) settle down. It is towards the end of the convalescent phase that Beau's lines over the nails may first appear.Fever persisting for at least 5 days Presence of at least 4 of the following principal features: Changes in extremities Acute: Erythema of palms, soles; edema of hands, feet Subacute: Periungual peeling of fingers, toes in weeks 2 and 3 Polymorphous exanthema Bilateral bulbar conjunctival injection without exudate Changes in lips and oral cavity: Erythema, lip cracking, strawberry tongue Diffuse injection of oral and pharyngeal mucosa Cervical lymphadenopathy (>1.5 cm diameter), usually unilateral Exclusion of other diseases with similar findings Patients with fever at least 5 days and <4 principal criteria can be diagnosed with KD when CAAs are detected by two dimensional echocardiography. In the presence of 4 or more principal criteria, KD diagnosis can be made on day 4 of illness.",
