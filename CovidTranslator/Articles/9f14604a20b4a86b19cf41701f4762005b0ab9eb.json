RPA amplified both CPV-2a and -2b DNA but did not amplify the template of other important dog viruses (CCoV, PRV or CDV), demonstrating high specificity. The method was further validated with 57 canine fecal samples. An outstanding advantage of RPA is that it is an isothermal reaction and can be performed in a water bath, making RPA a potential alternative method for CPV-2 detection in resource-limited settings.",

            "text": "Early and rapid diagnosis is crucial for the prevention of CPV-2 spread and disease management. A number of geneamplification-based assays have been developed for CPV-2 diagnosis, such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR), nested PCR, real-time PCR, loop-mediated isothermal amplification, and insulated isothermal PCR (iiPCR) [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] . Recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA), a novel isothermal gene amplification technique, employs three core enzymes: a recombinase, a single-stranded DNAbinding protein (SSB), and a strand-displacing polymerase [11] [12] [13] . The reaction initiates with the recombinase binding to the primer to form filaments (protein-DNA complex) that are capable of pairing the primer with a homologous sequence in the target DNA. After filaments recombine with homologous DNA, the other strand of target DNA is displaced, where SSB binds to prevent the dissociation of the primer. Finally, the strand-displacing polymerase adds bases to the 3' end of the primer and primer extension occurs. When opposing primers are used, exponential amplification typically runs to completion in about 30 minutes. RPA has been explored for the molecular detection of diverse pathogens, e.g., bacteria, fungi, parasites and viruses [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] , as it possesses superiority in speed, portability and accessibility [17] . In this study, a novel RPA-based method was developed for the detection of CPV-2.",

As shown in Figure 3A , genomic DNA from CPV-2a and -2b was amplified, while templates from some important dog viruses, i.e., CDV, PRV and CCoV, were not (Fig. 3B ). Viral DNA extracted from 57 clinical fecal samples was tested by RPA, and the results were compared with those obtained using conventional PCR. We observed that 50 out of 57 (83.3 %) Of the seven samples that were negative by PCR, three were negative and four were positive when tested by RPA. The overall diagnostic agreement between RPA and PCR was 92.9 % (53/57). Kumar et al. reported that real-time PCR had a detection limit of 10 copies of CPV-2 genomic DNA/reaction [8] , comparable to our method. We designed the RPA assay aiming to detect all CPV-2 variants. Indeed, both CPV-2a and -2b were successfully amplified with RPA (Fig. 3A) . We were unable to obtain CPV-2c, which was thus not tested in this study. Nevertheless, the RPA primers were 100 % identical to the target sequences in CPV-2c genomic DNA, as shown by sequence alignment. RPA did not amplify the template of other important dog viruses, demonstrating high specificity. The validation experiment revealed that RPA had an excellent diagnostic agreement rate with PCR, which is indicative of the clinical applicability of RPA. It is known that low-temperature amplification usually creates a high background signal; hence, nonspecific bands generated from RPA are not uncommon [17] . However, we also observed that nonspecifically amplified bands can be easily differentiated by size difference and signal intensity (Figures 1, 2, 3) .",
