Numerous ER/Golgi proteins contain K(x)Kxx motifs, but the rules for their recognition are unclear. We present crystal structures of a-COP and b 0 -COP bound to a series of naturally occurring retrieval motifs-encompassing KKxx, KxKxx and non-canonical RKxx and viral KxHxx sequences. Binding experiments show that a-COP and b 0 -COP have generally the same specificity for KKxx and KxKxx, but only b 0 -COP recognizes the RKxx signal. Dilysine motif recognition involves lysine side-chain interactions with two acidic patches. Surprisingly, however, KKxx and KxKxx motifs bind differently, with their lysine residues transposed at the binding patches. We derive rules for retrieval motif recognition from key structural features: the reversed binding modes, the recognition of the C-terminal carboxylate group which enforces lysine positional context, and the tolerance of the acidic patches for non-lysine residues.",

Subsequent yeast genetic studies implicated the N-terminal b-propeller domains of a-COP and b 0 -COP, the sequence-related large subunits of ab 0 e-COP (Eugster et al, 2004) . A recent structural analysis of the b 0 -COP N-terminal domain crystallized with a KxKxx peptide pinpointed the binding site near to the 'pore' of the b-propeller protein, and a corresponding binding site was mapped via functional tests to the pore region of a-COP (Jackson et al, 2012) . However, the mode of KxKxx motif recognition by coatomer was not resolved in this study because the dilysine-binding site on b 0 -COP was partially occluded by a crystal contact (Jackson et al, 2012) .",

Here, we describe 11 highresolution crystal structures that show how a-COP and b 0 -COP bind to a comprehensive series of motifs, including the canonical KKxx and KxKxx classes as well as the variant KxHxx and RKxx signals. We show that the recognition modes of KKxx and KxKxx motifs are distinct, a non-intuitive observation that helps to rationalize the binding mode of the RKxx motif. We demonstrate that a-COP and b 0 -COP subunits have comparable specificity towards KKxx and KxKxx motifs, contrary to previous reports. And we show that coatomer subunit specificity diverges instead at the level of K(x)Kxx sequence context and in the recognition of the RKxx motif, which binds exclusively to b 0 -COP.",

The reporter molecule used in these studies was fused to the C terminus of yeast Wbp1 (a component of the ER N-oligosaccharyltransferase complex), terminating in the sequence TFKKTN. A recent analysis demonstrated that this sequence binds to b 0 -COP with 10-fold lower affinity than do KxKxx peptides, and that while b 0 -COP has some capacity to transport KKxx-tagged cargo, it has a distinct binding preference for KxKxx motifs (Jackson et al, 2012) . In preliminary binding experiments, we noted, however, that a-COP and b 0 -COP displayed highly similar selectivity towards a panel of KKxx and KxKxx sequences ( Figure 1 ). Figure 1A shows the results of an initial test for binding of dilysine motifs to the complete ab 0 e-COP subcomplex of coatomer (see Materials and methods). The dilysine motifs were fused to the C terminus of glutathione S-transferase (GST), then immobilized on glutathione sepharose beads and probed for binding to ab 0 e-COP. Purified recombinant Bos taurus ab 0 e-COP was added to a mix of 'background' E. coli proteins, and the specificity of binding was assessed by the enrichment of COPs from the input mixture ( Figure 1A ). ab 0 e-COP binds to the KKxx motifs of the mammalian proteins p25 and Ergic-53 and the adenoviral E19 protein, and to a KKxx motif nested in a poly-serine sequence (labelled KKSS in Figure 1 ; the polyS-KKSS sequence confers ER residence to a CD8 reporter molecule in HeLa cells; Jackson et al, 1990) . No specific binding was observed to the p24-family protein p24b, which does not contain a dilysine motif at its C terminus. For control sequences, we added two C-terminal serine residues, KKxxSS (labelled p25 \u00fe SS in Figure 1 ), since this addition was shown to abolish the ER retention of a CD8 reporter molecule (Jackson et al, 1990 ).",

First, the problem of poor solubility of yeast and mammalian a-COP proteins that hampered previous studies (Lee and Goldberg, 2010) was solved by using the Schizosaccharomyces pombe N-terminal b-propeller domain, engineered to improve its solubility by mutating five hydrophobic residues to lysine in a flexible loop-L181K, L185K, I192K, L196K and F197K. Second, a fraction of the crystals we obtained had intimate crystal contacts in the vicinity of the dilysine-binding site that occlude all or part of the site. Six crystal structures were discarded for this reason, yielding a final set of eleven structures: eight S. cerevisiae b 0 -COP/peptide complexes, two S. pombe a-COP/ peptide complexes and one structure of S. pombe a-COP with a vacant binding site. The crystal structures were refined to resolutions ranging from 1.45 to 1.9 \u00c5 (see Table I for crystallographic data and a list of the dilysine sequences used).",

These are the first views of dilysine motifs bound to coatomer unobstructed by crystal contacts, and they define the three 'primary' points of interaction between the retrieval motif and coatomer subunit: the C-terminal carboxylate group of the KxKxx peptide binds to a basic patch involving residues Arg15, Lys17 and Arg59 (S. cerevisiae b 0 -COP numbering), and the two lysine side chains interact with two acidic patches. These primary interactions can be seen more clearly in Figures 3B and D, which show the crystal structure of b 0 -COP bound to the KxKxx motif of human Wbp1 (hWbp1 in Table I ; also called OST48). We refer to the acidic patches as patch 1, involving b 0 -COP residue Asp206 that binds to the \u00c0 3 lysine side chain, and acidic patch 2, involving residues Asp98 and Asp117 binding to lysine \u00c0 5 of the peptide (labelled accordingly in Figure 3B ). In the crystal structure of S. cerevisiae b 0 -COP reported by Jackson et al (2012; PDB identifier 2YNN) , a KxKxx peptide with sequence CTFKTKTN interacts with the basic patch and with patch 1 via the \u00c0 3 lysine, but patch 2 is occluded by a crystal contact and the \u00c0 5 lysine side chain of the motif projects away from the binding site as a result.",

The primary and secondary interactions made by the KxKxx motif, as defined above, are common to the a-COP/Emp47p, b 0 -COP/Emp47p and b 0 -COP/hWbp1 complexes and, as this implies, the conformations of the bound peptides are highly similar (compare, e.g., Figures 2B and D) .

The close structural equivalence of the binding sites accords with the results of pull-down experiments showing the highly similar specificity of a-COP and b 0 -COP towards the dilysine motifs ( Figure 1 ). To extend the results of the pull-down experiments, we measured more precisely the affinities of dilysine motifs using isothermal calorimetry (ITC; Figures 2E-H , and see Materials and methods). All the functional dilysine motifs we tested caused a significant heat change upon mixing with a-COP and b 0 -COP (see Table I for a list of the sequences of peptides used). A control peptide KKxxSS caused no heat change upon mixing with b 0 -COP, confirming that the assay measures the protein/peptide interaction (black curve in Figure 2F , lower panel).

How certain can we are that this represents the bona fide binding mode for KKxx motifs? First, a comparison of the peptide conformations in the b 0 -COP/p25, a-COP/E19 (Figures 2  and 3) and b 0 -COP/yWbp1 (Supplementary Figure S1 ) complexes shows highly similar conformations and sets of contacts at the binding sites. This involves a total of five distinct crystallographic observations of KKxx peptides, as both the a-COP/E19 and b 0 -COP/yWbp1 crystals contain two complexes in the asymmetric unit (Table I) . Second, the peptide conformations were defined by difference Fourier analysis of 1.45 \u00c5 (p25), 1.9 \u00c5 (E19) and 1.5 \u00c5 (yWbp1) resolution X-ray data sets. Third, the KKxx binding mode is common to the a-COP and b 0 -COP binding sites. Fourth, the binding mode is independent of the sequence context, unaffected by a preponderance of hydrophobic (p25; KKLV), hydrophilic (yWbp1; KKTN) or terminal proline (E19; KKMP) residues. On this basis, we conclude that the two dominant classes of dilysine motifs, KKxx and KxKxx, bind to a common site on a-COP and b 0 -COP proteins, as shown previously (Eugster et al, 2004; Jackson et al, 2012) , but adopt distinct modes of interaction.",

As expected, both a-COP and b 0 -COP bind to the p25 and adenoviral E19 sequences, in accord with the results of the pull-down experiments, but there is somewhat more variation in the specificity of the two COPs (compared with their highly similar affinities towards KxKxx motifs). The proline-containing E19 motif, KKMP, binds with comparable affinity to a-COP (K d \u00bc 64.5 mM) and b 0 -COP (K d \u00bc 49.0 mM), while the more conventional KKLV sequence of p25 binds somewhat more tightly to a-COP (K d \u00bc 11.3 mM) than to b 0 -COP (K d \u00bc 27.7 mM). The results reinforce the view that b 0 -COP does not disfavour KKxx motifs in general. The outlier in this analysis is the dilysine motif of yeast Wbp1 (yWbp1; KKTN), which binds with significantly lower affinity to b 0 -COP (K d \u00bc 170.9 mM) than to a-COP (K d \u00bc 36.6 mM). These measurements are consistent with a previous study showing a 10-fold lower affinity of the KKTN sequence for b 0 -COP compared to KxKxx motifs (Jackson et al, 2012) . And they offer a possible explanation for the results of trafficking experiments that revealed a selective retrieval defect in coatomer mutants lacking a shows the KKLV sequence of human p25 bound to b 0 -COP (refined at 1.45 \u00c5 resolution).

Labels indicate acidic patch 1 (red circle, Asp206) and acidic patch 2 (Asp98 and Asp117). The binding mode of the KKxx motif is indicated by the clockwise arrow coloured green.

            "text": "In the final stage of our analysis of KKxx motifs, we sought a molecular explanation for this, the difference in specificity of a-COP and b 0 -COP towards the yWbp1 KKTN signal. Presumably, an explanation will be found in the interplay between the terminal residues of the motif KKTN (but not the upstream residues, TFKKTN, since these lie outside the binding site) and specific residue differences between the a-COP and b 0 -COP binding sites. As described previously, the binding sites differ at only two positions, and only one of the two is in the vicinity of the terminal KKTN side chains: namely Tyr33 (b 0 -COP) and its equivalent His31 (a-COP). Supplementary Figure S1A shows the structure of the b 0 -COP/yWbp1 complex (the millimolar concentrations of peptide and b 0 -COP protein used for crystallization are more than sufficient to saturate the binding site; K d \u00bc 170.9 mM). In the picture, we have overlapped the His31 side chain of a-COP with Tyr33 of b 0 -COP. The juxtaposition of the Tyr33/His31 side chains and the threonine residue of the KKTN motif lead us to propose that an unfavourably close approach of the Tyr33 hydroxyl group impinges on the b-branched threonine residue (and hinders a favoured sidechain rotamer) and is responsible for lowering the affinity of the b 0 -COP/KKTN complex. This invokes a rather subtle interplay, such that the shorter His33 side chain of a-COP is more compatible with a b-branched residue at the \u00c0 2 position, all the more so because position 33 is conserved in a-COP as either a histidine or phenylalanine residue across species (and is a Phe in S. cerevisiae a-COP). Nevertheless, a peptide in which the threonine residue is replaced with serine, TFKKTN to TFKKSN, was tested for its affinity to a-COP and b 0 -COP by ITC (Supplementary Figure S1B) . Strikingly, the KKSN peptide binds more tightly than KKTN to b 0 -COP by a factor of 1.8-fold, and a comparison of the (ratio of) affinities of a-COP and b 0 -COP for KKxx motifs shows that the KKTN motif of yWbp1 favours a-COP by a factor of 4.7, the KKSN motif favours a-COP by a factor of 2.2, and the KKLV motif of p25 favours a-COP by a factor of 2.5. The results confirm the interplay between the Tyr33/His31 residue at the binding site and the \u00c0 2 position of the dilysine motif, and they reveal that threonine is disfavoured by b 0 -COP at the \u00c0 2 position, hence the reliance of the yWbp1 retrieval motif on a functional a-COP subunit for trafficking in vivo (Eugster et al, 2004) . In our subsequent analysis of the variant KxHxx motif, we found that b 0 -COP binds with far lower affinity than a-COP to the KVHVQ sequence ( Figure 4C ; peptide PEDVspike in Table I) , and the crystal structure of the b 0 -COP/KVHVQ complex ( Figure 4B ) shows the close approach of the \u00c0 2 valine residue to Tyr33. Collectively, these observations are consistent with the proposal that b 0 -COP disfavours dilysine motifs that contain a b-branched residue (I, T, or V) at the \u00c0 2 position.",

The arginine side chain adopts a unique binding position, outside the circumscribed dilysine-binding site (shown schematically in Figure 6 ). Figure 5B illustrates how the arginine residue is extended to form bonds via its guanidinium group to the backbone carbonyl oxygen atom of b 0 -COP residue Arg185. Interestingly, the corresponding carbonyl oxygen atom is not available to form this bond in a-COP; instead, in all the a-COP crystal structures the carbonyl group of Arg213 points away from the binding site (c angle of Arg213 is rotated B1651 relative to the conformation in b 0 -COP; Figure 5B ).",

Additionally, we speculate that aspartic and glutamic acid residues may be favoured at the \u00c0 1 position, to facilitate a charge interaction with Arg272 (b 0 -COP numbering), perhaps explaining the tight binding of the hWbp1 KEKSD motif ( Figure 3D ; 3.4 mM) .

They demonstrate that a-COP and b 0 -COP do not discriminate between KKxx and KxKxx motifs as originally proposed by a study of Emp47p and Wbp1 trafficking in yeast (Eugster et al, 2004) . Instead, discrete structural differences at the binding sites allow only a-COP to bind tightly to dilysine motifs with a b-branched residue at the \u00c0 2 position, and allow only b 0 -COP to accept the rare RKxx signal.",

            "text": "The major unresolved issue in this context is the functional organization of a-COP and b 0 -COP in the polymerized COPI coat. Our previous structural analysis of ab 0 -COP implicated a triskelion vertex formed by b-propeller contacts that are highly similar to those in the COPII cage (Stagg et al, 2006; Fath et al, 2007; Lee and Goldberg, 2010) . However, as we emphasize in Supplementary Figure S2A , the ab 0 -COP crystal structure included only a fragment of a-COP so that the location of the b-propeller domain of a-COP remains unclear. A direct attack on this problem will require electron microscopy, and a recent study of reconstituted COPI-coated vesicles using cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) has pointed the way forward (Faini et al, 2012) . This study identified a three-fold symmetry centre in the density distribution for the COPI cage, consistent with the ab 0 -COP triskelion nucleus. However, fitting of additional solenoid regions of ab 0 -COP and of the AP2 crystal structure (as a model for the bd/gz-COP subcomplex) was unsatisfactory, and clearer insights into the COPI architecture await an advance in the resolution of the cryo-ET analysis. A key insight from the cryo-ET study is that protein features near to the three-fold symmetry centre reside close to the membrane surface (Faini et al, 2012) . This is important, because most dilysine motifs are presented on cytoplasmic tail sequences that are intriguingly short. To assess this issue, we modelled the binding of a dilysine motif to b 0 -COP in the ab 0 -COP triskelion on a membrane surface. As Supplementary Figure S2 illustrates, the dilysine motif binds very close to the contact surfaces at the triskelion centre: the KKxx motif fits snugly between adjacent b 0 -COP surfaces, whereas the KxKxx motif clashes somewhat with a neighbouring surface (however, we did not evaluate these contacts in detail because the triskelion interface is distorted from proper three-fold symmetry by crystal packing interactions). Importantly, the first lysine residue of the KKxx motif resides B25 \u00c5 from the membrane surface, according to this model (Supplementary Figure S2C) . This is just compatible with the lengths of cargo cytoplasmic tails: for example, the number of residues between the membrane surface and the first lysine residue is 13 in yWbp1, 10 in p25 and 12 in adenoviral E19. This striking juxtaposition of coat proteins and cargo signals has implications for the mechanism, still unresolved, through which coatomer couples cargo packaging to COPI-vesicle formation (Bremser et al, 1999) .",

GST-dilysine fusion proteins immobilized on glutathione sepharose beads were incubated with the ab 0 e-COP subcomplex plus 'background' protein mix (see Materials and methods). Specific binding was assessed by the enrichment of ab 0 e-COP proteins from the input, relative to the GST control. E. coli Hsp70 is an innocuous component of the background mix. Bound proteins were analysed by 4-20% SDS-PAGE and Coomassie blue staining. Control dilysine sequences contained two additional serine residues at their C termini (labelled, e.g., p25 \u00fe SS). The label KKSS refers to a dilysine sequence nested in a poly-serine background.(B) The S. cerevisiae a-COP dilysinebinding site displays similar specificity towards KKxx motifs as full-length ab 0 e-COP. These binding experiments were performed with the same panel of dilysine motifs as (A), using in this case the S. cerevisiae a-COP(1-818)/b 0 -COP(651-814) dimer. (C) a-COP binds specifically to the KxKxx motif of Emp47p. This experiment used the a-COP(1-818)/b 0 -COP(651-814) protein dimer. (D) b 0 -COP likewise binds specifically to the KxKxx motif of Emp47p. This experiment used the S. cerevisiae b 0 -COP(1-814)/a-COP(642-818) dimer. (E) b 0 -COP binds to the panel of KKxx motifs with the same specificity as a-COP. Here, we used the b 0 -COP(1-814)/a-COP(642-818) dimer. Note the comparison with (B), lane by lane. (F) Crystal structure of the N-terminal b-propeller domain of S. pombe a-COP bound to the KKxx motif of adenoviral E19 protein (magenta worm).
