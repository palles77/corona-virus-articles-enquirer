None of the previous studies of naturally occurring colds has conducted appropriate virological assays to determine the nature of the infecting agent. This is an essential methodological step in studies of malaise associated with URTIs. The aim of this research was to investigate the effects of naturally occurring colds on mood and objective measures of performance. This was done by first conducting a cross-sectional comparison of 37 healthy people and 158 volunteers with colds and then a longitudinal study in which 100 volunteers developed colds and 87 remained healthy. Virological techniques were used to identify infecting agents and comparisons made across the different groups. The results showed that having a cold was associated with reduced alertness and slowed reaction times. These effects were observed both for colds where the infecting virus was identified and those where it was not. Similar effects were obtained for both rhinovirus and coronavirus colds. One may conclude that upper respiratory tract illnesses lead to a reduction in subjective alertness and impaired psychomotor functioning. This was true for both illnesses where the infecting agent was identified and for those clinical illnesses where no virus was detected. It is now important to identify the mechanisms linking infection and illness with the behavioural changes. Similarly, the impact of these effects on real-life activities such as driving needs examining. Finally, methods of treatment need to be developed which not only treat the local symptoms of the illnesses but remove the negative mood and the performance impairments.",

            "text": "Upper respiratory tract illnesses, such as influenza or the common cold, are widespread, frequent and a major cause of absenteeism from education and work. In addition, recent research has demonstrated that these illnesses reduce well-being and can impair the efficiency of mental functioning. Initial evidence for such effects came largely from anecdotal reports and case histories (Grant, 1972; Tye, 1960) . Studies of experimentally-in-duced influenza and colds have confirmed that such illnesses produce performance impairments and the results can be briefly summarised as follows: both colds and influenza have selective effects on mental performance, with only some aspects of being impaired. The profile of impairments has been found to be different in studies of influenza from those observed in experiments on the effects of colds; influenza impaired detection of stimuli presented at uncertain times or unknown locations (Smith et al. 1987b (Smith et al. , 1988 . However, neither motor performance nor higher cognitive functions appear to be affected by influenza; in contrast, the common cold impaired psychomotor function (e.g. hand-eye co-ordination; speed of psychomotor responses) but had little effect on either detection tasks or those involving higher functions (Smith et al. 1987a (Smith et al. ,b, 1989 .",

            "text": "The effects of influenza have been replicated in a study of naturally occurring illnesses involving virological techniques to identify the infecting agent (Smith et al. 1993b) . While studies of naturally occurring colds have confirmed that such illnesses reduce subjective ratings of alertness and lead to psychomotor slowing (Hall and Smith, 1996; Smith et al. 1995; Smith et al., 1997) no experiments have been conducted which relate these effects to the nature of the infecting virus. Indeed, we do not know whether confirmed infections produce similar effects to those clinical illnesses where the virus is unknown. In addition, the differences between influenza and cold infections suggest that the nature of the infecting agent may be crucial. Data from studies of experimentally-induced infections suggest that many effects of different cold producing viruses on performance are similar. However, subjective mood ratings have shown different effects of coronavirus colds and those following infection with rhinoviruses, with the coronavirus leading to reduced ratings of subjective alertness and the rhinovirus colds being associated with much smaller changes in mood (Smith et al., 1992) . These differences may not reflect the viruses but may be due to variation in the severity or length of the cold. This issue was examined here. Research on naturally occurring colds (Hall and Smith 1996) has failed to replicate results obtained following infection with respiratory syncytial viruses (RSV). Given that it is unlikely that the young adults with naturally occurring colds had RSV infections it does appear plausible that even different cold producing viruses may produce different effects on mood and performance. This issue was addressed here by examining the effects of colds following rhinovirus and coronavirus infections.",

Detection tasks involving selective attention were unimpaired by these illnesses. The effects of the cold were present in illnesses following coronavirus infection and when the infecting agent was a rhinovirus. Illnesses following a verified infection produced similar effects to those where no infecting agent was isolated and where classification was based on clinical symptoms and signs. Overall, these results confirm findings at the MRC Common Cold Unit with experimentally induced illnesses and previous studies of real life colds where no virology was carried out. The mood effects were related to subjective reports of symptoms but were not related to length of illness or amount of nasal secretion. The slowing of simple reaction time was not correlated with subjective reports of symptom severity nor duration of illness or amount of nasal secretion. The phenomena appear, therefore, to be genuine and robust. Indeed, the magnitude of the impairments should also be noted (a slowing of reaction time of 10%) as they are comparable with known hazards such as working at night or consuming a moderate amount of alcohol (Smith et al., 1987b) . It should also be pointed out that other research shows that these illnesses not only have direct effects on mood and performance but can exacerbate the effects of other factors (volunteers with colds show larger impairments when exposed to noise (Smith et al., 1993a) or given small amounts of alcohol (Smith et al., 1995) ). Further research must identify the neuroimmunological mechanisms underlying the effects, assess the impact on real life activities, and aim to develop therapies which not only provide symptomatic relief but remove the behavioural problems produced by upper respiratory tract illnesses.",
