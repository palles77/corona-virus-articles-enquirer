            "text": "The development of lung injury from the transfusion of blood products occurs on a clinical spectrum, and therefore the proper recognition of lung injury must consider these possible scenarios. Transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI), in its classic and most recognized form, is the fulminant development of new lung injury in a patient who has just received or is receiving a blood-product transfusion. Often, severe respiratory failure develops, and frothy pulmonary edema fluid is suctioned from the endotracheal tube. This catastrophic and fulminant form of TRALI is easily diagnosed by most health care providers. Like most pathologic processes, however, TRALI extends on spectrum from mild to severe, and the milder forms of TRALI can go unrecognized even by highly trained and experienced health care providers. For example, TRALI in the stable patient on the general medical ward who is receiving packed red blood cells (PRBCs) for anemia and develops a mild decrease in oxygen saturation may go unrecognized, or the cause of the oxygen desaturation may be blindly assigned to volume overload. A recent retrospective study that tracked the recipients of blood products from a donor implicated in a case of TRALI exemplifies this point [1] . This highly motivated donor was linked to 15 cases of TRALI over a 2-year period, and many of the cases were associated with mild symptoms or mild oxygen desaturation. Most of these cases were not initially recognized as TRALI, nor were they reported to the blood bank as a potential adverse event. It is essential for the health care provider to maintain a high degree of vigilance for adverse reactions to blood products and to investigate thoroughly any oxygen desaturation temporally related to blood-product transfusion.",

            "text": "Another important category of potential lung injury related to blood-product transfusion is the worsening of pre-existing acute lung injury (ALI) by subsequent hemotherapy. It often is difficult to make a diagnosis of TRALI in critically ill patients who have existing ALI/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS); however, if there is a sudden worsening of oxygenation and pulmonary compliance in a patient who is receiving or in the past 6 hours has received a blood-product transfusion (in the absence of signs of volume overload), a probable diagnosis of TRALI can be made. There are a few studies in the medical literature that support a contribution of bloodproduct transfusion to the worsening of preexisting ALI/ARDS. Using the largest prospective study on the incidence of ALI in the pediatric population, Church and colleagues [2] retrospectively assessed the role of blood-product transfusions on the clinical outcomes of this patient population. These investigators discovered that the transfusion of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) was an independent risk factor for mortality in these pediatric ALI patients at 30 days. In an adult prospective investigation of the risk factors, incidence, and outcomes of ALI/ARDS at a single center, Gong and colleagues [3] reported that PRBC transfusion was independently associated with the initial development of ALI/ARDS and was an independent risk factor for mortality in ALI/ARDS, with a dose-dependent response.",

            "text": "Potential lessons also can be learned from the seminal Transfusions Requirements in Critical Care (TRICC) trial by the Canadian Care Trials Group [4] . In this randomized, controlled equivalency trial comparing restrictive and liberal transfusion thresholds, the patients transfused with a hemoglobin trigger of less than 7 g/dL had at least as good outcomes as the patients in the liberal transfusion arm. In an analysis of the ICU complications that developed in the two groups of patients, 32 patients (7.7%) in the restrictive transfusion group versus 48 patients (11.4%) in the liberal transfusion group developed ARDS during their ICU stay (P \u00bc .06). Unfortunately, it was not determined what proportion of these patients who had ARDS developed overt TRALI; however, it is provocative to consider that a proportion of ARDS may be preventable by adhering to lower transfusion thresholds. This potential benefit could result from the reduction of ALI/ARDS directly caused by the transfusion of blood products and ALI/ARDS resulting from the combination of blood transfusions and other causes (the two-hit model). In the TRICC trial, decreased infectious complications (eg, pneumonia, sepsis) did not seem to be a benefit of the restrictive transfusion group, and thus the decreased incidence of ALI/ARDS probably cannot be attributed to decreased transfusion-related immunomodulation. One other notable point to consider regarding the TRICC trial was the statistically significant decrease in pulmonary edema in the restrictive transfusion group. Pulmonary edema was listed as a cardiac complication, although it is unclear how rigorously noncardiogenic pulmonary edema was excluded. This decrease in pulmonary edema could potentially comprise both transfusion-associated circulatory overload and TRALI.",

Recently, the field has been aided significantly by a consensus definition developed by a panel investigators convened by the National heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) [6] . Simply put, TRALI remains a clinical diagnosis, similar to the clinical definition used for ALI/ ARDS [7] . In fact, if a patient meets clinical criteria for ALI/ARDS and has received a blood-product transfusion during the previous 6 hours (in the absence of another credible risk factor for ARDS), a clinical diagnosis of TRALI can be made. The blood bank and laboratory work-up of TRALI is an important component for the possible prevention of future TRALI from implicated blood donors, but it is not required to make a diagnosis of TRALI.",

The multitude of case reports in the medical literature confirms a close temporal association with the transfusion of blood products. In fact, it is common for TRALI to develop during the first 30 to 60 minutes of a transfusion [8] . Experimental evidence from animal models supports this temporal association. In at least four different animal models of TRALI using anti-neutrophil antibodies, anti-major histocompatibility class (MHC) I antibodies, and the plasma and lipid fractions from day 42 PRBCs and day 5 platelets, lung injury develops within 6 hours of challenge with these experimental agents [9] . In fact, in the MHC I antibody model, lung injury develops within 2 hours and often within 15 to 30 minutes [10] . The speed with which lung injury develops in a given patient is probably a complex interplay of host susceptibility and dose or titer of the injurious blood product.",

The clinical course of these probable TRALI patients can be followed over time, and the credibility of the relationship of the risk factors to ALI/ARDS can be assessed.

            "text": "The issue of massive transfusions as a risk factor for ALI/ARDS is a potential source of confusion in assigning the diagnosis of TRALI. Massive transfusion is defined as the replacement by transfusion of more than 50% of a patient's blood volume over 12 to 24 hours [11] . Massive transfusion has been implicated as a major risk factor for ALI/ARDS in multiple studies and is probably the fourth most common cause of ALI/ARDS, accounting for approximately 20% of cases. Even with the experimental models of massive blood transfusion, it is not entirely clear how lung injury is produced by this insult. Because many of these patients, if not the majority, are involved in trauma, considerations include ischemia-reperfusion lung injury from shock and potentially a component of direct thoracic trauma. Older investigations using animal models of ''shock lung'' disproved the microaggregate or particulate theory of lung injury from transfusions but focused attention on the plasma fraction of blood products [9] . Is it possible that the development of ALI/ARDS from massive blood transfusion is a function of the cumulative risk of TRALI from individual blood products? This supposition may explain many of the cases; receiving multiple blood products places the patient at higher risk of receiving an incompatible product containing either a matched antibody or priming or activating bioactive lipids. If one considers the two-hit model of TRALI, then the underlying medical condition of the critically ill patient who is requiring multiple transfusions also places the patient at risk for TRALI. In summary, the certainty by which a diagnosis of TRALI can be made in a patient who has other risk factors for ALI or preexisting ALI is a complicated issue that may be aided by following the clinical course of the patient and also by focused laboratory investigation of implicated blood products.",

Numerous case reports and case series have documented the presence of these antibodies and the matching antigens in the recipient, and in animal models MHC I and anti-neutrophil antibodies have produced acute lung injury [8, 10, 18, 19] . In rarer circumstances, roles can be reversed, and recipient antibodies can react with antigens on donor leukocytes. In the FDA's report on fatalities secondary to TRALI, anti-HLA I antibodies were the most frequently implicated antibody, followed by anti-granulocyte and anti-HLA II antibodies [13] . In an anti-MHC I mouse model that reproduces many features of clinical TRALI, lung injury was produced secondary to the recognition of endothelial-bound MHC I antibody by circulating neutrophils and their Fc gamma receptors [10] . In another experimental model of TRALI, evidence was presented that a mouse monoclonal anti-neutrophil antibody directly activated human neutrophils, leading to lung injury [19] . Common to all antibody models, however, is the central role of the neutrophil in producing disease, either from direct antibody activation or indirectly through Fc gamma receptor activation. Other investigators have shown that monocytes may be important in TRALI pathogenesis [20] .",

Cellular blood products (PRBCs, platelets) have been shown to accumulate these lipids over time, and the plasma and lipid fractions from these older blood products have been used to produce pulmonary edema in isolated, perfused rat lung models.

For example, a retrospective study of TRALI involving an antibody to a neutrophil antigen expected to be present in more than 90% of recipients produced TRALI in only a minority of patients transfused with this antibody [1] . This lack of a consistent relationship between antibodyantigen matches and TRALI has been explained by host susceptibility and specifically by the twohit model of TRALI. This hypothesis states that the recipient must have an underlying medical condition that contributes to immune priming and that with the transfusion of HLA or neutrophil antibody or biologically active lipids (or both), TRALI is produced. Evidence supporting this hypothesis includes the frequent occurrence of TRALI in the ICU or operating room and epidemiologic associations with cardiopulmonary bypass and hematologic malignancies [17] . In addition, the biologically active lipid model involves a necessary systemic endotoxin-priming step to produce ALI [22, 23] . Host susceptibility factors such as genetic polymorphisms also may be contributing factors.",

            "text": "Patients who develop TRALI often develop dyspnea, tachypnea, and hypoxia. Both hypotension and hypertension have been reported in patients who have TRALI, as has hyper-and hypothermia. In mechanically ventilated patients or at the time of endotracheal intubation, frothy pulmonary edema fluid is sometimes elaborated in fulminant TRALI cases. The same criteria used by clinicians and researchers to diagnose other causes of ALI/ARDS are used to make a diagnosis of TRALI [7] . Chest imaging reveals bilateral pulmonary opacities in a pattern consistent with noncardiogenic pulmonary edema (Fig. 1) . Adjunctive tests that aid in a TRALI diagnosis include echocardiography, serial white blood cell counts, and the protein analysis of undiluted pulmonary edema fluid [8] . Echocardiography can aid in the work-up by helping exclude volume overload and cardiogenic dysfunction. Often, patients who have fulminant TRALI have evidence of low cardiac filling pressures. Measurement of brain natriuretic peptide may also be an adjunctive test that can be helpful. There are several case reports of leukopenia and neutropenia temporally associated with the onset of pulmonary edema in TRALI [25] [26] [27] [28] . This laboratory finding often is dynamic, with leukocyte counts recovering a few hours after the initiation of TRALI. There is even one case report of leukopenia heralding the onset of TRALI [29] . The mouse MHC I antibody model of TRALI also has documented this phenomenon, which speaks to the association of leukopenia with disease pathogenesis [10] . Other causes of ALI/ ARDS (eg, pneumonia, sepsis) also might produce leukopenia, so this finding is not specific to TRALI. Thrombocytopenia and decreased complement have been reported also, but much less frequently. Finally, if present, the measurement of the protein concentration of undiluted pulmonary edema fluid and a matched plasma sample can be helpful in documenting a permeability pulmonary edema and thus helping exclude transfusion-associated circulatory overload or cardiogenic pulmonary edema [30] .",

Paradoxically, these patients, who sometimes have severe pulmonary edema, may require intravenous fluids to support blood pressure. Colloid and vasopressors may be required in some instances. Corticosteroids have no role in the treatment of TRALI patients.

Use of erythropoietin [31] and recombinant factor VII may help reduce transfusion requirements in selected populations. Most experts agree that if a blood donor is implicated in a TRALI case, that donor and the donor's existing blood products should be removed permanently from the donor pool. Given the incidence of HLA sensitization in multiparous females [32] and the association of TRALI with FFP transfusion, the United Kingdom has excluded all women from donating FFP, directing their donations instead to plasma-poor blood products [14] . In addition, platelet pools are suspended in male plasma as much as possible. There has not been ample time to determine the benefit of this regulatory action on the incidence of TRALI; however, the number of highly likely or probable TRALI cases decreased from 22 in 2003 to 13 the next reporting years. Leukoreduction of PRBCs is now an almost universal blood bank procedure, but it is unlikely that it will significantly reduce the incidence of TRALI, because recipient antibody recognition of antigens on donor leukocytes is a rare mechanism in TRALI.",

Remarkably, through collaborations with multiple laboratories in different countries, a novel coronavirus was identified as the causative agent of SARS just 4 to 5 months after the initial reports of the SARS outbreak [34, 35] . A similar coronavirus was also isolated from wild animals (eg, Himalayan palm civets, raccoon dogs) sold in the ''wet'' markets in Guangdong Province, supporting a zoonotic origin of this novel virus [36] . The incubation period for SARS seems to range between 2 and 10 days, although longer incubation times have been documented. Unlike influenza, in which transmissibility peaks soon after the onset of clinical symptoms, SARS is transmitted most efficiently after 10 days of illness. The primary route of transmission is contact (direct or indirect) with respiratory droplets or fomites. Fecal-oral spread also may play a role, given the presence of SARS coronavirus in stool specimens and the presence of watery diarrhea in many affected patients. The spread of SARS seems to involve socalled ''super-spreaders'' who disproportionately infect many persons, and it also prominently involves transmission in the health-care setting [37] .",

Attention and trepidation are now focused on the H5N1 epizootic strain and its potential to cause worldwide disease and mortality. The H5N1 virus first emerged in 1959 in chickens in Scotland and now is causing a pandemic among chickens in Southeast Asia [43] . According to World Health Organization statistics accessed on June 5, 2006, 224 humans have been infected with H5N1 virus in 10 different countries, and 127 have died, yielding a mortality of 57%, many of which are children and young adults [44] . Almost all the persons infected with H5N1 have been linked epidemiologically with exposure to sick birds or, in a very small number of cases, to exposure to another human who had H5N1 infection. It is unknown just how widespread and lethal a pandemic of H5N1 infection would be, but the Congressional Budget Office estimates that 200 million people could be infected in the United States alone.",

The hemagglutinin molecules attach to epithelial cells and macrophages in the lungs by interaction with cell-surface sialic acid residues. A true influenza pandemic can develop only if the avian H5N1 virus can spread efficiently from human to human, a scenario that has occurred only rarely thus far. Recent reports might help explain why the avian H5N1 virus currently is inefficient in human-to-human infection. It seems that established human influenza viruses (eg, H1N1) and avian flu viruses target different regions of the human respiratory tract. Human flu viruses preferentially recognize sialic acid residues in the proximal respiratory tract (trachea and bronchi), whereas H5N1 infects alveolar type II cells, macrophages, and the nonciliated cuboidal epithelium of the terminal bronchi [45, 46] . This differential tropism may help explain the clinical presentation of ALI/ARDS in humans infected with H5N1, and perhaps more importantly, it may help explain why H5N1 is not transmitted efficiently among humans: human influenza is transmitted easily from its proximal location in the respiratory tract, whereas H5N1 is a more deeply seated infection. There is even some concern from animal models of H5N1 infection that viremia can lead to fecal shedding of the virus and the potential for fecal-oral transmission.",

The H5N1 strains isolated from humans have proven susceptible to the neuraminidase inhibitors oseltamivir (Tamiflu) and zanamivir (Relenza), although there have been case reports of isolates resistant to oseltamivir [49] .

Multiple strategies are being used to produce an immunogenic vaccine. A recent report used two doses of an inactivated subvirion H5 vaccine administered intramuscularly to humans and showed that, at the highest dose of the vaccine administered, approximately half of the patients developed neutralizing antibody titers [50] . The 50% effectiveness of this vaccine contrasts with the 70% to 90% effectiveness of human influenza vaccines in current use. It has been proposed that the use of an adjuvant may increase H5 vaccine effectiveness, because new hemagglutinin proteins in humans may be poorly immunogenic.

The outcomes of recent initiatives by the United Kingdom limiting exposure to female plasma will be followed closely to determine if similar action should be taken in the United States. With the threat of SARS temporarily under control, attention is intensely focused on the pandemic threat of H5N1 influenza, which has the potential to overwhelm existing critical care resources for the treatment of respiratory failure. Undoubtedly, new infectious and noninfectious causes of ALI/ ARDS will emerge in the future, mandating vigilance by health care providers, providing a challenge to public health officials and clinical and basic science investigators, and requiring transparent communication among the members of today's global society.",
