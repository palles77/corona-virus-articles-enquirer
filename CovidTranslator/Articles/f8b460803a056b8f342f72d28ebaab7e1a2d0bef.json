Over 140 viruses are involved: the average child under the age of five years or adult in the developed countries will experience four to five and two to four infections each year, respectively; and although many infections are relatively mild, some are life-threatening. Douglas and Edelstein (1988) have said that, \"About three hundred million cases of acute respiratory disease occur in the United States each year, accounting for about one hundred and fifty million visits to physicians. The cost of these illnesses exceeds one billion dollars exclusive of time lost for work\": this statistic, adjusted for population, can be directed at any country. The size of the problem demands much of a general physician's time, while the importance has focused the attention of epidemiologists, microbiologists, pharmaceutical companies and many others.",

These families are listed in Table 1 , together with data on the finer classification into sub-families, genera, or sub-genera, the number of distinct types of virus in each group and the number of these that cause human respiratory infections. Thus, there are six families encapsulating 21 sub-divisions and over 240 viruses, of which over 140 cause respiratory tract infections in man, while the remainder cause other types of infection or infections in other species. The exact numbers are complicated by the rhinoviruses where more than 100 serotypes are known, but many more probably exist, and by influenza A and B virus which exhibit continuing genetic change producing new antigenic variants in most years.",

Rhinoviruses belong to the family Picornaviridae and are distinguished from other members of this family by a higher particle density, acid lability which limits intestinal infection, relative heat stability, resistance to a variety of detergents and survival for several hours or even days outside the body. Virus particles contain an internal RNA which is single-stranded with positive polarity surrounded by a capsid of 60 capsomeres arranged in icosahedral symmetry: particles are approximately 30 nm in diameter. Rhinoviruses replicate in human cells and less well in the cells of other primates: the conditions for growth are a relatively low pH of 7.0 to 7.2, a low temperature of 33 \u00b0C and aeration of cell cultures; and under these conditions cytopathic effects can be observed. The growth cycle takes some 11 to 17 hours; and each infected cell yields 10-200 virus particles. Cross-neutralization tests indicate over 100 distinct serological types, but some sharing of epitopes does exist (Hamparian et al., 1987) .",

Infections tend to be most common in spring and autumn, and are spread by large and small droplets of nasal secretions from infected persons, by direct spread from nasal secretions via hand to hand contact and auto-inoculation of nasal or conjunctival mucosa or via inanimate objects: infection can be initiated by very little virus, and the viruses can survive for long periods outside the body.

The virus is relatively large at 150 to 200 nm diameter: particles are composed sequentially of linear double-stranded DNA and an internal core of proteins; a capsid of 162 capsomeres arranged in an icosahedral form; a protein tegument; and a trilaminar envelope derived from the cellular membrane into which are inserted spikes of several virus-specific glycoproteins. Infection is primarily of the epithelial cells of the oropharynx, and via the complement receptor CD21: virus infection from these cells spreads to P-lymphocytes where a few cells undergo lytic infection while the majority support a latent infection that leads to cell proliferation. The mechanism for this latency is not fully understood, but is believed to be due to the absence or low-level of host cell transcriptional factors that are essential for virus replication: the result is a persistent, life-long P-lymphocyte infection.",

The immune response is not sufficient to resolve the illness, as infected lymphocytes appear to be resistant to cytotoxic T cells and there is a down-regulation of HLA antigen expression.

The RNA is closely associated with a nuclear protein (NP) and the polymerase enzyme complex to form a helical structure: the NP takes one of three antigenic forms which allows influenza viruses to be classified into types A, B, and C. Surrounding a nuclear protein is the matrix or membrane protein, and this in turn is surrounded by a lipid bilayer. Inserted into the bilayer, and radiating from the surface, are two virus glycoproteins. The most numerous glycoprotein is the hemagglutinin (HA) which is the receptor binding component; the classification of influenza types into subtypes is based principally on the different antigenic forms of the HA (HI, H2, H3) molecule. The second glycoprotein is the neuraminidase (NA) which is important in both cell infection and in facilitating the release of newly formed virus from the surface of infected cells; the NA is antigenically variable (N,,N2) and this variation is used in the subtype classification of the viruses.",

Firstly, most pandemics and widespread epidemics are caused by influenza A viruses; influenza B viruses are associated with self-limiting epidemics which occur in families or small communities; and influenza C virus is associated with sporadic infections, mainly among young children. Influenza A exhibits the greatest antigenic diversity; influenza B exhibits some variation; and influenza C is relatively stable. Secondly, the recorded patterns of influenza A epidemics during the past century exhibit two phenomena. Every 10 to 15 years since records began in 1890, influenza virus has undergone major antigenic changes in the HA molecule, termed antigenic shift: the emergence of these new subtypes has resulted in the pandemics seen in the years 1933 (HI), 1947(H1), 1957(H2) and 1968(H3); and caused the epidemics which followed until the next new subtype emerged. These subtypes are distinct, and immunity to one provides no protection against infection by others. The origin of new subtypes cannot be by simple mutation from previously existing strains, since many genetic changes occur and intermediary strains are not found. Two theories for the origin of new subtypes are advanced. Firstly, two influenza viruses, one of human origin and the other probably of avian origin, infect the same cell: due to the segmental nature of the virus genomes, reassortant virus is easily produced combining the properties to infect man and the HA glycoprotein of the non-human strain. The new subtypes can now cause pandemic infection in populations with no previous immunity. An alternative theory is that the various subtypes circulate sequentially over a period of 70 to 80 years, since on two occasions antibody to new serotypes has been detected in sera from elderly people years prior to the emergence of that new subtype to cause pandemic infection: where the viruses survive between times is unknown.",

This sequential accumulation of mutations arises naturally, and is selected by antigenic pressure in the immune and partially-immune population. In addition to antigenic drift and shift, viruses isolated from different places at the same time, and even viruses from different individuals in the same epidemic, can exhibit antigenic differences; this is known as inter-and intra-epidemic variation, and both underline the difficulty in matching vaccine virus to epidemic strains, and contributes to the disappointing low levels of immunity induced by inactivated influenza vaccines. The degree of crossprotection is directly related to the degree of cross-reaction of the virus HA, and this is shown in Table 3 .

Histological studies of nasal exudate and tracheal biopsies indicate that the major site of infection is the ciliated columnar epithelial cells which become progressively rounded and swollen, and exhibit vacuolation with loss of ciliation; the progression usually begins in the tracheal bronchial epithelium and then ascends. The result is the widespread destruction of the ciliated epithelium down to the basement membrane which itself is not affected; the lesions become increasingly permeable with polymorphonuclear infiltration and edema. Because of the generalized symptoms of uncomplicated influenza, viremic spread has been suspected; however, there is no conclusive evidence that viremia occurs. In contrast, virus infections have been associated with ECG and EEG changes; some unconfirmed observations of virus antigen in brain and heart tissue have been published; and infection can be associated with viral encephalitis, particularly among children.

The eyes are often watery, burning and painful on movement.

Pneumonia in patients with influenza virus infection can be primary or secondary. In viral pneumonia, patients developed a persistent fever and leucocytosis, dyspnea, hypoxia, and cyanosis; this follows the acute symptoms described above. Sputum specimens show no bacterial cause, and a proportion of these patients die of diffuse hemorrhagic pneumonia. More commonly, pneumonia following influenza is due to secondary bacterial infection, principally with Staphylococcus aureus, but also with Streptococcus pneumoniae, Hemophilus influenzae and other bacterial species: this complication is a major cause of death among elderly people and those with underlying disease such as congestive heart failure and chronic bronchitis.

An important complication of influenza infection is the syndrome known as Reye's syndrome characterized by encephalopathy and fatty liver degeneration; this is chiefly seen at age 8 to 15 years, and among those hospitalized the mortality can be as high as 50%. The association of Reye's syndrome following infection by influenza A or B or other viruses has been fully demonstrated, but the pathogenesis remains obscure (Carey et al., 1976) : researchers have highlighted the association of virus infection with treatment of fever with high concentrations of aspirin, and for this reason aspirin should not be given to patients in this age group. More conjectural is the association of influenza infection in pregnancy with congenital abnormality; this is not justified with our current knowledge.

The viruses are recognized as influenza A, B, or C by complement fixation tests using extracts of infected cells containing high concentrations of NP antigen, and type-specific antisera. Further identification of influenza isolates into sub-types and strains is dependent upon antigenic differences in the HA. This is determined by hemagglutination inhibition (HI) tests against antisera raised in experimental animals against a range of virus subtypes and strains: the titer of each antisera against homologous virus is known prior to testing, and the pattern of HI titers found against an unknown influenza virus determines the strain and type. However, this is a highly specialized typing system which is the responsibility of WHO reference laboratories who constantly type new isolated viruses in a worldwide endeavor to detect new virus variants as they arise.

The virus particle is structurally similar to that of other members of the family consisting of a single, non-segmented, negative strand of RNA and three internal proteins surrounded by a lipid bilayer with two associated proteins: inserted into the outer aspect of the lipid bilayer are spikes of an attachment protein and a fusion protein. The diameter of the virion is 120 to 300 nm. RSV replicates in the cytoplasm of a range of human and animal cells: cell death is principally the result of cell fusion, and the formation of multinucleate syncytia indicates the presence of virus and gives the virus its name. Antigenic variants are known, and this has resulted in recognition of two subgroups.",

Firstly, cases of acute pneumonia due to adenovirus and influenza viruses, although unusual, are well-documented, and fatalities have been recorded following these infections. Secondly, severe infection by viruses in higher compartments of the respiratory tract, can extend to cause pneumonia: these include adenovirus and influenza viruses again, and RSV and parainfluenza viruses in young children. Thirdly, primary pneumonia is a rare presentation by measles, chicken pox (varicella/zoster) and cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection: although unusual in normal subjects these are more commonly seen in immunocompromised persons, where the infection can be devastating. Pneumonia in the immunocompromised by measles, chicken pox or CMV is usually an extension of typical infection to involve the lungs, but can present without a rash or with an atypical rash in patients with no history of infection. Patients develop cough and chest pains, and more seriously dyspnea and cyanosis; X-rays may show evidence of viral pneumonia with atypical, patchy consolidation; and deaths are recorded in 40% or more of immunocompromised patients. Pathologically, the alveoli contain edema fluid with macrophages, but few polymorphonuclear cells; and typically and diagnostically, giant multinuclear cells. The viruses can be grown from the bronchial secretions; however, since these are rapidly progressing infections and suggested treatments are available for two of these viruses, quicker methods such as the direct demonstration of virus by immunofluorescence or ELIS A tests on cells in secretions are needed. There is no treatment for measles virus pneumonia; acyclovir or ganciclovir are reported to be of value in the treatment of CMV; and acyclovir will prevent pneumonia in chicken pox patients, but has no proven value in treating established pneumonia.",

Over 140 viruses cause respiratory tract infections, with the added complications of influenza viruses where new antigenic variants are recognized almost annually; and immunity to infection by one virus strain offers little or no protection to infection by others. Knowledge of the mechanisms of spread of respiratory viruses is largely understood and has helped in infection control; however, the clinical signs and symptoms of infection tend not to be diagnostic of the causative agent; and although vaccines have been developed for the more serious infections such as influenza and some adenovirus infection, none are available for other important infections. Treatment is largely symptomatic, but the compounds ribovirin for RSV infection and amantadine for influenza virus infection have been shown to be effective. Much remains to be discovered before more effective measures can be implemented to limit the enormous costs incurred by these infections.
