Although large numbers of clostridia are present in the small intestine of some calves with diarrhea, they may not be the primary pathogen; therefore, their presence does not confirm clostridial enterotoxemia as the cause of the diarrhea. Salmonellosis occurs most often in calves two weeks to four months of age that are debilitated, stressed, and under close confinement. In some areas it may be endemic and therefore may be the most common cause of diarrhea in those calves. However, in most areas, calf scours is by far the most common cause of diarrhea in the calf.

This is accomplished by using fluids which contain proteins or amino acids, glucose, sodium, and bicarbonate. These solutes have a synergistic effect on the rate of intestinal absorption of each other and, therefore, of water. 7 For example, the rate of intestinal absorption of sodium is greatly increased if glucose is present; conversely, the rate of intestinal absorption of glucose is more than doubled if sodi)1m is present. Of course, through salivary, pancreatic, and hepatic secretion, some sodium is always present in the intestine, but the quantity may not always be sufficient for maximal rates of absorption to occur. Absorption of water is passive; as solutes are absorbed, it is absorbed. Thus, to obtain the maximal rate of water absorption a fluid designed to attain the maximal rate of solute absorption is required. A number of fluids designed for this purpose are available commercially* or can be formulated as shown in Table 2 . Oral fluids constitute excellent media for microbial growth and are nonsterile; therefore, after use, the remainder should be refrigerated and, if not used within one to two days, it should be discarded.",

They not only enhance intestinal absorption but they also *Life Guard Oral-Norden Labs, Lincoln, Nebraska; Resorb-Beecham-Massengil, Bristol, Tennessee. assist in the nutritional maintenance of the animal. Although the energy and protein that most oral fluids provide are certainly of benefit, they are not sufficient to meet the animal's requirements. Therefore, additional energy must be provided if more than two days of therapy are required. Although the administration of oral fluids may increase the loss of fecal fluid, this does not negate their benefit. Their use will either reduce the net loss of water from the body or will result in a net gain of water. This is demonstrated in the example shown in Table 3 , in which, prior to receiving oral fluids, the calf had a net water loss and a decrease in body weight of I kg per day. When oral fluids were given, fecal losses doubled, but the calf then had a net water gain and an increase in body weight of I kg per day. Weighing the patient eight hours or so after administration of oral fluids will confirm whether or not the fluids given orally or by any other In preruminant calves and lambs, suckled fluids will bypass the rumen and reticulum and go directly into the omasum and abomasum. Nursed fluids, therefore, reach the intestine more rapidly than those given by stomach tube and are absorbed.more quickly. Thus, the calf should first be encouraged to nurse as much fluid as possible. The remainder of the fluids needed may be given by stomach tube. Most of the fluid administered by stomach tube is deposited in the rumen and takes longer to reach the intestine where absorption occurs. In some cases, this may be of benefit in providing a more prolonged therapeutic delivery.",

In more severe cases, the subcutaneous administration of fluids in conjunction with intravenous fluids may be quite beneficial and may lessen the amount of fluids that must be given intravenously.
