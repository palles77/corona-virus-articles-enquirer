Many hospitals took proactive measures, including quarantine strategies at the entrances [2] . However, as shown by several reports, SARS-CoV-2 might be transmitted by asymptomatic carriers [3, 4] ; also symptomatic individuals may evade hospital entrance quarantine measures. On 19 th February 2020 the Central Epidemic Command Center (CECC) reported a Taiwanese case who was admitted for pneumonia, with a diagnosis of COVID-19 made 3 weeks after her admission [5] .",

Each morning we identify all inpatients with pneumonia by searching electronic medical records (medical notes and radiologic reports), with the keyword \"pneumonia\". Patients with an improving clinical course were then excluded, including those with interval decreasing serum C-reactive protein levels and those with no fever (>37\u00baC) for >48 h. Patients with a recent serum procalcitonin level more than 2.0 ng/mL were also excluded because bacterial pneumonia is more likely. Patients whose oropharyngeal or nasopharyngeal swab had tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 were also excluded. To avoid an excessive number of alarms, patients in the alarm lists from the previous two days were also excluded; in other words, a patient with persistent non-improvement only alarmed every third day. The alarms were integrated into our Critical Value Notification System, which was originally used to report high-risk or life-threating examination results. Each morning, alarms were sent to the primary care medical teams, including attending physicians, residents, and nurse practitioners, as well as the head nurses via the hospital information system and short message service. To facilitate prompt management, the primary care medical teams were required to reply the alarms within an hour by answering a multiple-choice question, \"Do you think this patient might have COVID-19?\" The infection control team analysed the replies and took actions daily.",

Firstly, we only used \"pneumonia\" as the keyword to search for cases, so those having reverse semantics, such as \"no pneumonia\" and \"pneumonia is excluded\", in medical records were also included. This problem might be solved by using artificial intelligence with semantic analysis. However, the system load is a concern because the surveillance system works during the busiest hours for information systems. Secondly, the exclusion criteria used in the algorithm was somewhat arbitrary, and need further testing. In particular exclusion on the basis of a previous negative upper airway SARS-CoV-2 test might not be justified. However, stricter exclusion criteria would bring more false alarms. As our surveillance system aimed to remind the physicians about the possibility of COVID-19 in cases with pneumonia obviously unresponsive to antibiotics, we strived to keep a reasonable number of alarms to avoid fatigue.",
