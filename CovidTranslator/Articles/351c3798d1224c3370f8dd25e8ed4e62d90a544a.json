Mamu-A*01 negative rhesus macaques were immunized in groups of four with either: RV expressing SIV mac239 -GagPol, a combination of RV expressing SIV mac239 -Env and RV expressing SIV mac239 -GagPol, or with empty RV vectors. Eight weeks later animals received a booster immunization with a heterologous RV expressing the same antigens. At twelve weeks post-boost, all animals were challenged intravenously with 100 TCID 50 of pathogenic SIV mac251-CX . Immunized macaques in both vaccine groups had 1.3-1.6-log fold decrease in viral set point compared to control animals. The GagPol/Env immunized animals also had a significantly lower peak viral load. When compared to control animals following challenge, vaccinated macaques had a more rapid induction of SIV mac251 neutralizing antibodies and of CD8 + T cell responses to various SIV epitopes. Moreover, vaccinated macaques better-maintained peripheral memory CD4 + T cells and were able to mount a poly-functional CD8 + T cell response in the mucosa. These findings indicate promise for RV-based vectors and have important implications for the development of an efficacious HIV vaccine.",

A variety of approaches to develop an HIV-1 vaccine have been attempted (for review see [1] ), although the use of recombinant adenovirus serotype 5 (Ad5)-based vectors expressing HIV-1 genes have been the most common. Whereas vaccine studies with replication deficient Ad5 vectors and simian-human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV) looked promising in rhesus macaque models, a similar Ad5-based vaccine failed to induce protective immune responses in a large clinical study in humans [2, 3] . Despite this discouraging outcome and based on the finding that attenuated SIV can protect animals from a lethal challenge, a live viral vaccine seems to be the most promising candidate for protection against HIV-1 [4] .",

Vesicular stomatitis virus: The neutralizing antibody titers were determined with the SPBN-IG reference strain and reported as the serum dilution that achieved 50% reduction in foci-forming units of input virus as described previously [5] . Simian immunodeficiency virus (SIVmac251): Neutralization of a T cell line adapted stock of SIV mac251 (TCLA-SIVmac251) was measured by using 5.25.EGFP.Luc.M7 (M7-Luc) cells (kindly provided by Dr. Nathaniel R. Landau) as previously described [18] . The M7-Luc cell line is a CEMx174 cell clone that was produced by retroviral vector transduction to express CCR5 (CD4 and CXCR4 are expressed naturally) and transfection to contain Tat-responsive luciferase (Luc) and green fluorescence protein (GFP) reporter genes [19] . The assay stock of TCLA-SIVmac251 was produced in H9 cells and titrated in M7-Luc cells. Briefly, a 500 tissue culture infectious dose 50 (TCID 50 ) of virus was incubated with serial dilutions of serum samples in triplicate for 1 hr at 37\u00b0C. Then, 5\u00d710 4 cells M7-Luc cells were added to each well. One set of control wells received cells and virus (virus control) and another set received cells only (background control). The plates were incubated until approximately 10% of cells in virus control wells were positive for GFP expression by fluorescence microscopy (approximately 3 days). Alternatively, neutralization of an SIVmac239 Env-pseudotyped virus (clone 23) was measured as a reduction in luciferase reporter gene expression after a single round of infection in TZM-bl cells (NIH AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program, as contributed by John Kappes and Xiaoyun Wu) as previously described [18, 20] . The assay stock of SIVmac239.18 was prepared by transfection in 293T cells and was titrated in TZM-bl cells as previously described [18, 20] . Briefly, 200 TCID 50 of virus was incubated with serial 3-fold dilutions of serum sample in duplicate for 1 hr at 37\u00b0 C. Then, 10,000 freshly trypsinized cells were added to each well. One set of control wells received cells and virus (virus control) and another set received cells only (background control). The plates were incubated for 48 hours. Following incubation with either TCLA-SIVmac251 or SIVmac239.18, luminescence was measured using the Britelite Luminescence Reporter Gene Assay System (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Neutralization titers are the dilution at which relative luminescence units (RLU) were reduced by 50% compared to virus control wells after subtraction of background RLUs.",

The common NLME model (based on data from all animals) included random effects of animal incorporated into parameters A and B of animal-specific trajectories. The differences between the groups of trajectories were incorporated into the model as fixed effects. The interest was focused on the long-term behavior, and the group average slopes of the longterm linear trend were compared between the groups using the estimates from the fitted NLME model. CD4 + T cell count trajectories: Log (base 10) transformed CD4 + T cell counts were analyzed by fitting a LME model [22] . The linear time trends in log transformed CD4 + T cell trajectories were modeled with the slopes and intercepts varying between the groups, incorporating random effects of animal, and adjusting for the baseline CD4 + T cell counts computed as the average log transformed CD4 + T cell count before the challenge. Long-term SIV mac251 antibody trajectories: Log (base 10) transformed antibodies measures at 28 weeks or later were analyzed by fitting a LME model [22] , similar to the CD4 + T cell counts, except for the baseline adjustment.

We see here that although the Gag/ Env vaccinees had a lower peak viral load and more rapid antibody induction, there was no difference between vaccine cohorts in the ability to maintain a low viral set point and to prevent disease. Thus, it appears that while Env may help immediately following infection, the longterm benefits are minimal. Of note, SIV mac239 Env (which was used in our vaccine) and SIV mac251 Env (which is expressed by the challenge virus) have strong sequence similarity.

This may prove to be important, as one factor contributing to the failure of the Ad5-based STEP vaccine trial was pre-existing vector immunity [2, 3] .
