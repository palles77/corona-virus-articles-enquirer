CEACAM1 expression correlated with granulocytic differentiation, and Ceacam1 \u2212/\u2212 mice developed neutrophilia due to loss of the Src-homology-phosphatase-1 (SHP-1) dependent inhibition of granulocyte-colony stimulating factor receptor (G-CSFR)-signal transducer and activator of transcription (Stat3) pathway provided by CEACAM1. Moreover, Ceacam1 \u2212/\u2212 mice were hypersensitive to Listeria Monocytogenes (LM) infection with an accelerated mortality. Reintroduction of CEACAM1 into Ceacam1 \u2212/\u2212 bone marrow restored normal granulopoiesis and host sensitivity to LM infection, while mutation of its immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs (ITIMs) abrogated this restoration. shRNA mediated reduction of Stat3 amounts rescued normal granulopoiesis attenuating host sensitivity to LM infection in Ceacam1 \u2212/\u2212 mice. Thus, CEACAM1 acted as a co-inhibitory receptor for G-CSFR regulating granulopoiesis and host innate immune response to bacterial infections.",

Binding of G-CSF to G-CSFR activates a signaling cascade including phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription (Stat3) a key regulator of basal and emergent granulopoiesis (Avalos, 1996) . Similar with its function as a pro-proliferative oncogene in tumor (Yu et al., 2009) , Stat3 also promotes mitogenic signaling to facilitate neutrophil production in response to G-CSF (Avalos, 1996) , and hyper-active Stat3 induces enhanced granulopoiesis (Croker et al., 2004) . Consistent with the finding that Stat3 antagonizes Stat1 and Stat5 activation in T helper cell differentiation and tumor environment (Welte et al., 2003) G-SCF only weakly activates Stat1 and Stat5 in Stat3 proficient models (Avalos, 1996; Chakraborty et al., 1996; Tian et al., 1994) . However, once the antagonizing function of Stat3 is lost in Stat3 conditional genetically ablated mice, hyper-active Stat1 compensates for Stat3 and becomes an alternative G-CSFR downstream pathway, resulting in neutrophilia (Lee et al., 2002) . Taken together, Stat3 expression and activation need to be properly controlled for normal granulopoiesis. In addition, loss of \u03b2 2 -integrin or leukocyte-endothelial (LE)-selectin induces neutrophilia due to elevated basal amounts of G-CSF and IL-17 (Forlow et al., 2001; Stark et al., 2005) , suggesting a non-cellular autonomous feedback mechanism, while loss of CXC-chemokine receptor-4 (CXCR-4) affects granulopoiesis in a cellular autonomous fashion (Eash et al., 2009) . The possibility that inhibitory co-receptors may also regulate G-CSFR dependent granulopoiesis has not been investigated.",

            "text": "In this respect, CEACAM1 is a likely candidate based on its high expression on neutrophils and its known role as an inhibitory co-receptor in the immune system (Gray-Owen and Blumberg, 2006) . The CEACAM1 molecule consists of cytoplasmic, transmembrane and extracellular domains. The extracellular domains comprise a membrane distal IgV-like Ndomain followed by a variable number of IgC-like domains. The N-domain mediates homophilic ligation with other CEACAM1 molecules or heterophilic ligation with other CEA family members (Gray-Owen and Blumberg, 2006) . Both human and murine CEACAM1 transcripts undergo alternative splicing generating 11 human and 4 murine isoforms (Gray-Owen and Blumberg, 2006) . The CEACAM1 long form has two ITIMs in its cytoplasmic domain, which upon phosphorylation recruit Src homology domain-containing protein-tyrosine phosphatases SHP-1 and -2, which in turn, suppress signal transduction of associated receptors by dephosphorylation of their downstream effectors (Gray-Owen and Blumberg, 2006) . In activated T cells, recruitment of SHP-1 by CEACAM1 down-regulates TCR signaling by targeting Zap-7 (Chen et al., 2008) and IL-2R signaling (Chen and Shively, 2004) . Overexpression of CEACAM1 long forms in T-cells prevents inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in a murine colitis model (Nagaishi et al., 2006) . In germinal B cells, anti-IgM induces CEACAM1 phosphorylation, SHP-1 recruitment, and subsequent suppression of PI3-K signaling, leading to potentiated activation induced cell death (AICD) (Lobo et al., 2009) . Although these studies demonstrate how CEACAM1 regulates immune effector cell function, the possibility that CEACAM1 may regulate immune cell development has not been addressed. Although CEACAM1 plays a role in activation and apoptosis of neutrophils (Singer et al., 2005; Singer et al., 2002) , its role in granulopoiesis and neutrophil dependent innate immune response in infectious models has not been investigated.",

In addition, peripheral blood neutrophils (PBNs) that are more mature than bone marrow neutrophils (BMNs), expressed a slightly higher amount of CEACAM1 on the cell surface than BMNs. We also examined the expression of CEACAM1 on lineage negative bone marrow (Lin \u2212 BM) cells by immunoblot ( Figure 1B ) and flow cytometric analysis ( Figure 1C ). Although these progenitor cells expressed a relatively lower amount of CEACAM1 compared to the mature innate immune cells, granulocyte-monocyte progenitors (GMPs) that specifically give rise to granulocytes and monocytes, expressed higher amounts of CEACAM1 than common myeloid precursors (CMPs) and megakaryocyte-erythrocyte precursors (MEPs) ( Figure 1C ). These results indicate that from the early progenitor stage to the final effector stage, cell surface CEACAM1 amounts correlate with granulocytic lineage differentiation. We also compared the long and short forms of CEACAM1 by quantitative real-time PCR using CEACAM1 long form and short form specific primers showing that neutrophils and Lin \u2212 BM cells expressed both the long and short forms of CEACAM1 at the mRNA level ( Figure  1D ) with a general preference for the long form (in neutrophils, the Long:Short (L:S) ratio was about 1.76; in Lin \u2212 BM cells, the L:S ratio was about 1.41).",

            "text": "Since CEACAM1 is expressed on neutrophil progenitors (Figure 1 B-D) and is a known inhibitory co-receptor on activated lymphocytes (Gray-Owen and Blumberg, 2006) , we hypothesized that granulocytic development and production would be affected in Ceacam1 \u2212/\u2212 mice. In contrast to WT C57BL/6 mice, Ceacam1 \u2212/\u2212 mice spontaneously developed systemic neutrophilia as manifested by the dramatically higher numbers of the Ly-6G + CD11b + population in BM, peripheral blood (PB), spleen and liver ( Figure 2A ). This dysregulated granulopoiesis could be explained by an accumulation of neutrophils with a slower turnover rate or an augmented neutrophil production from myeloid progenitor cells. To test the first possibility, we utilized the in vitro spontaneous apoptosis assay (Johnnidis et al., 2008) and found that Ceacam1 \u2212/\u2212 neutrophils underwent normal or slightly faster apoptosis than WT ones ( Figure S2A -B). To test the second possibility, we assessed neutrophil progenitor cell proliferation in the methylcellulose colony formation assay. G-CSF treated Ceacam1 \u2212/\u2212 BM produced 2-fold more neutrophil colonies than WT ( Figure  2B ). Ceacam1 \u2212/\u2212 BM had 1.6 times the number of GMPs than WT ( Figure 2C ). When the proliferative capacity of the GMPs was measured by bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation, there was a higher ratio of BrdU + GMPs in Ceacam1 \u2212/\u2212 mice than the WT ( Figure 2D ). Since there was no obvious difference in BrdU incorporation of WT or Ceacam1 \u2212/\u2212 neutrophils (data not shown), the observed neutrophilia in Ceacam1 \u2212/\u2212 mice does not result from proliferation of neutrophils. In G-CSF induced emergent granulopoiesis (Croker et al., 2004; Roberts et al., 1997) in WT mice, bone marrow neutrophil and peripheral blood counts were 21 \u00d7 10 6 and 15 \u00d7 10 5 /ml, respectively, while in G-CSF treated Ceacam1 \u2212/\u2212 mice enhanced granulopoiesis was observed (BMN 95 \u00d7 10 6 , PBN 112 \u00d7 10 5 /ml) ( Figure 2E ). These results suggest that CEACAM1 negatively regulates G-CSF mediated basal (homeostatic) and emergent granulopoiesis, and that genetically ablating CEACAM1 leads to neutrophilia due to neutrophil progenitor cell hyper-proliferation. Ceacam1 \u2212/\u2212 BM cells act autonomously and CEACAM1 regulation of progenitor cells is granulocytic lineage-specific \u03b2 2 -integrin or LE-selectin genetically ablated mice develop neutrophilia in a nonautonomous feedback mechanism (Forlow et al., 2001; Stark et al., 2005) . To study is this mechanism aplies to CEACAM1, reverse BM reconstitution was performed in which we transplanted WT BM cells into lethally irradiated Ceacam1 \u2212/\u2212 recipients or Ceacam1 \u2212/\u2212 BM cells into lethally irradiated WT recipients. Ceacam1 \u2212/\u2212 BM cells act independently since WT recipients receiving Ceacam1 \u2212/\u2212 BM cells developed neutrophilia while Ceacam1 \u2212/\u2212 recipients that received WT BM cells did not ( Figure S2C ).",

We also demonstrated that CEACAM1 associates with SHP-1 upon G-CSF treatment in WT Lin \u2212 BM cells ( Figure 3A ), or Lin \u2212 BM cells isolated from Ceacam1 \u2212/\u2212 mice receiving CEACAM1-2L or CEACAM1-4L ( Figure 4D ), but not in Lin \u2212 BM cells recovered from Ceacam1 \u2212/\u2212 mice receiving CEACAM1-2S, 4S, CEACM1-2Lm, 4Lm, or empty vector ( Figure 4D ). Thus, CEACAM1-SHP-1 association depends on the presence of the ITIMs in CEACAM1 long forms. In WT Lin \u2212 BM cells, SHP-1 also directly associated with G-CSFR as shown by IPs using anti-SHP-1 antibody ( Figure 4E ), leading to dephosphorylation of G-CSFR ( Figure 4F ). Notably, the SHP-1-G-CSFR association was abrogated in Ceacam1 \u2212/\u2212 Lin \u2212 BM cells, revealing the indispensable role of CEACAM1 in recruiting SHP-1 to dephosphorylate G-SCFR. Lastly, the dependency of SHP-1 was confirmed by shRNA-mediated reduction of SHP-1 in WT mice, a treatment that caused augmented granulopoiesis associated with elevated G-CSFR-Stat3 signaling ( Figure S4D -G). Therefore, we conclude that the CEACAM1 down-regulation of the G-CSFR-Stat3 pathway depends on its ITIMs and recruitment of SHP-1.",

            "text": "To study the physiological impact of the enhanced granulopoiesis of Ceacam1 \u2212/\u2212 mice, they were infected with Listeria Monocytogenes (LM), an infectious model in which neutrophils play an indispensable role in clearance during the early stages of infection (Eash et al., 2009; Nathan, 2006; Zhu et al., 2009) . Although enhanced bacteria clearance and prolonged survival of Ceacam1 \u2212/\u2212 mice due to their neutrophilia was a likely outcome, it is also possible that loss of negative signaling by CEACAM1 and neutrophilia could lead to enhanced tissue damage and pro-inflammatory cytokine production. Indeed, Ceacam1 \u2212/\u2212 mice died dramatically faster than the WT mice; in fact, almost all Ceacam1 \u2212/\u2212 mice died within 7 days while the WT mice had a 40% survival rate even at day 12 ( Figure 5A ). Bacterial colonies in either the liver or spleen of Ceacam1 \u2212/\u2212 mice 3 days post infection were fewer compared with WT, showing that Ceacam1 \u2212/\u2212 mice had improved bacterial clearance ( Figure 5B ). Therefore, the accelerated mortality was probably not due to failure of bacterial clearance in Ceacam1 \u2212/\u2212 mice. Since it was also possible that lack of CEACAM1 affects neutrophil anti-bacterial functions, an in vitro bacterial killing assay was performed. In this assay there was no significant difference between Ceacam1 \u2212/\u2212 and WT neutrophils ( Figure S5A ). Importantly, Ceacam1 \u2212/\u2212 neutrophils also performed normally in actin-cytoskeleton rearrangement and migration assays ( Figure S5B -C). Therefore, the improved bacterial clearance in Ceacam1 \u2212/\u2212 mice was not due to abnormal migration or an abnormal bacterial killing function of Ceacam1 \u2212/\u2212 neutrophils, but instead was due to increased neutrophil numbers in Ceacam1 \u2212/\u2212 mice. However, the improved bacterial clearance in infected Ceacam1 \u2212/\u2212 mice was accompanied by severe tissue damage and necrosis in the liver ( Figure 5C , quantified in Figure S5D ), likely caused by neutrophils. Indeed, significantly more neutrophils were recovered in infected Ceacam1 \u2212/\u2212 livers than in the WT ones ( Figure 5D ). In addition, in LM infected Ceacam1 \u2212/\u2212 mice, serum amounts of interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2), which was in the range associated with endotoxic shock (Greten et al., 2007) , and IL-6, keratinocyte-derived chemokine (KC), tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF\u03b1) to a lesser degree, were higher compared to WT mice ( Figure 5E ).",

            "text": "To further elucidate the cause of the elevated pro-inflammatory cytokine amounts in vivo, we analyzed whether CEACAM1 regulates cytokine production on a cellular basis. We examined neutrophils and macrophages, two major cellular sources of cytokine production during early days post infection. When cells were stimulated in vitro with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) ligand, or peptidoglycan (PGN), a TLR2 ligand, no significant difference in IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1, IL-6 and KC production was observed between WT and Ceacam1 \u2212/\u2212 macrophages ( Figure S6A ). Interestingly, Ceacam1 \u2212/\u2212 neutrophils produced significantly more IL-1\u03b2 (manuscript in preparation) but similar amount of TNF-\u03b1, IL-6 and KC compared with WT neutrophils ( Figure S6B ). We conclude that while loss of CEACAM1 significantly affects neutrophil IL-1\u03b2 production, there was no obvious effect on the production of other pro-inflammatory cytokines. Also, loss of CEACAM1 does not seem to affect macrophage production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Based on the in vitro per cell based cytokine production profile, we inferred that the significantly higher serum amount of IL-1\u03b2 in Ceacam1 \u2212/\u2212 mice after LM infection was due to both elevated neutrophils and elevated IL-1\u03b2 production capacity by individual Ceacam1 \u2212/\u2212 neutrophils, while the moderately higher amounts of TNF-\u03b1, IL-6 and KC were likely due to increased neutrophil numbers only in Ceacam1 \u2212/\u2212 mice.",

However, their serum amount of IL-1\u03b2 was dramatically lower than in Ceacam1 \u2212/\u2212 mice, and the G-CSF treated WT mice showed better survival than Ceacam1 \u2212/\u2212 mice ( Figure S6F ). Although the G-CSF treated WT mice had better bacterial clearance than untreated WT mice (data not shown), they showed poorer survival than the WT mice ( Figure S6F ), which could be due to the liver damage and elevated cytokine amounts as shown above, consistent with previous studies showing G-CSF treatment potentiated neutrophil induced tissue damage and pro-inflammatory response (Croker et al., 2004; Roberts et al., 1997) .",

Two months after BM reconstitution we found that reduction of Stat3 amounts by shRNA completely restored normal granulopoiesis both in vivo and in vitro ( Figure 7A -B) as well as normal GMP amounts (data not shown). Immunoblot analysis showed that the reduction of total Stat3 in Ceacam1 \u2212/\u2212 Lin \u2212 BM cells by shRNA was around 65%, which in turn, reduced p-Stat3, C-Myc, CyclinD1 to the WT amounts after G-CSF stimulation ( Figure 7C ). In contrast, Stat1 and Stat5 remained weakly phosphorylated after reduction of total Stat3, confirming that Stat3 plays a dominant role downstream of G-CSFR. shRNA specificity was confirmed since shStat3 did not affect Stat1 or Stat5 amounts, and the shRNA control did not affect Stat protein amounts, ruling out the possibility of off-target effects. We then challenged these mice with LM and examined if normalized granulopoiesis could rescue the accelerated mortality of Ceacam1 \u2212/\u2212 mice. Indeed, reduction of Stat3 partially rescued Ceacam1 \u2212/\u2212 mice from hypersensitivity to LM infection as manifested by prolonged survival ( Figure 7D ) associated with less liver damage ( Figure 7E , quantified in Figure S7 ) and lower serum amounts of IL-6, TNF-\u03b1, and KC ( Figure 7F ). However, IL-1\u03b2 remained high after reduction of total Stat3 by shRNA ( Figure  7F ), a finding that might explain their relatively poorer survival compared with WT mice, especially at early days post infection.",

Here, we showed CEACAM1 is a granulocytic lineage differentiation marker, and Ceacam1 \u2212/\u2212 mice had severe neutrophilia associated with hyper-proliferation of Ceacam1 \u2212/\u2212 neutrophil progenitor cells. This finding, together with the general function of CEACAM1 as an inhibitory co-receptor in T-cells (Gray-Owen and Blumberg, 2006), led us to hypothesize that CEACAM1 may down-regulate neutrophil production by acting as a co-inhibitory receptor for G-CSFR, the master regulator of granulopoiesis (Liu et al., 1996; McLemore et al., 2001) . This hypothesis was strengthened by the finding that in Lin \u2212 BM cells G-CSFR was co-IPed with CEACAM1 when treated with G-CSF, and that under this condition CEACAM1 was phosphorylated on its ITIMs and recruited SHP-1. The recruitment of SHP-1 down-regulated G-CSFR signaling by decreasing the phosphorylation of G-CSFR, attenuating its downstream Stat3 activation and expression of mitogenic proteins Cyclin D1 and C-Myc, thereby controlling the proliferation of neutrophil progenitors. In the absence of CEACAM1 the negative feedback loop would be absent allowing neutrophil precursors to abnormally produce neutrophils.",

Using retroviral vector transduced BM stem cell based BM reconstitution assays, we demonstrated that the CEACAM1 long form was able to associate with G-CSFR and restore normal granulopoiesis and that mutation of the tyrosine residues in its ITIMs abrogated this restoration. Furthermore, we found that only the CEACAM1 long forms recruited the suppressive phosphatase SHP-1, and that SHP-1 antibodies were able to co-IP G-CSFR, leading to de-phosphorylation of activated G-CSFR. We demonstrated the dependency of SHP-1 in regulating granulopoiesis by reduction of SHP-1 in WT mice by shRNA, a treatment which also leads to enhanced G-CSFR-Stat3 signaling and granulopoiesis, consistent with the previous observation that SHP-1 genetically ablated mice develop neutrophilia (Kruger et al., 2000) . Interestingly, G-CSF also induced tyrosine phosphorylation of the short isoform, although this isoform did not appear to associate with SHP-1 or regulate granulopoiesis. This intriguing result leaves open a role for the tyrosine residue in the murine short form of CEACAM1, although it is not present in the context of an ITIM. Notably, the human CEACAM1 short isoform has phenylalanine in place of tyrosine (Chen et al., 2007) . Thus, further studies are required to determine if the short isoform in murine CEACAM1 has any additional functions upon phosphorylation of its tyrosine residue.",

Stat3 also regulates proliferation of early progenitor cells of granulocytes (Zhang et al.) and is subject to negative regulation by induction of SOCS3, a negative feedback loop of Stat signaling (Croker et al., 2004) . As expected, Socs3 \u2212/\u2212 mice have hyper-p-Stat3 and enhanced granulopoiesis (Croker et al., 2004) . Similarly, our study of Ceacam1 \u2212/\u2212 mice serves as another example in which loss of a negative regulator leads to hyper-p-Stat3 and hypergranulopoiesis. We examined this further by reducing Stat3 amounts in Ceacam1 \u2212/\u2212 mice, which in turn, normalized p-Stat3 amounts and completely restored normal granulopoiesis, confirming that hyper-p-Stat3 was the main factor responsible for neutrophilia in Ceacam1 \u2212/\u2212 mice. Notably, Stat3 also antagonizes Stat1 and Stat5 activation (Lee et al., 2002) , which explains the weak activation of Stat1 and Stat5 in response to G-CSF in Stat3 proficient models (Avalos, 1996; Chakraborty et al., 1996; Tian et al., 1994) , while loss of Stat3 leads to alternative Stat1 hyper-activation, which in turn, compensates for Stat3 and causes neutrophilia (Lee et al., 2002) . Although these investigators interpret these results as evidence that Stat3 is a negative regulator of granulopoiesis, we argue that loss of Stat3 abrogates its normal antagonistic function on Stat1 and Stat5 signaling.",

Although the study of the Socs3 \u2212/\u2212 mice shows the crucial nature of the negative feedback loop provided by the Stat3 target gene SOCS3, it does not disregard Stat3's major function of transcribing mitogenic factors that positively regulate granulopoiesis. Instead, there is an exaggerated outcome demonstrating Stat3's role as a positive regulator in the absence of negative regulation. Take together, we can reconcile these previous studies and summarize Stat3's function in G-CSF mediated granulopoiesis as follows: Stat3 is the dominant Stat protein downstream of G-CSFR, and when present, it positively regulates granulopoiesis by promoting mitogenic signaling. One the one hand, Stat3 is subject to negative regulatory mechanisms including its self-induction of SOCS3, and that loss of the inhibitory mechanism(s) leads to hyper Stat3 activation, augmented mitogenic signaling and enhanced granulopoiesis. But on the other hand, Stat3 antagonizes or negatively regulates Stat1 and Stat5 activation, and when Stat3 is totally absent, its antagonizing role is lost and Stat1 becomes hyper active, a result that not only compensates for loss of Stat3 but also leads to neutrophilia. With this in mind, we gain a fuller appreciation that Stat3 expression and activation must be properly controlled for normal granulopoiesis.",

Although the surplus of neutrophils caused enhanced bacteria clearance in the Ceacam1 \u2212/\u2212 mice, they also induced severe liver damage and elevated serum cytokine amounts, especially IL-1\u03b2, leading to accelerated mortality, especially during the early days in which innate immunity predominates. Whether there are strain (C57B/6) effects on G-CSF treatment and LM infection experiment could be tested in the future when Ceacam1 \u2212/\u2212 mice on other backgrounds are available. Interestingly, reintroduction of CEACAM1 long form but not the short form or ITIM mutated long form to Ceacam1 \u2212/\u2212 mice not only restored normal granulopoiesis, but also normalized amounts of IL-1\u03b2, which correspondingly completely restored normal sensitivity to LM infection, demonstrating a critical checkpoint function for CEACAM1. However, it is worth noting that this checkpoint role is not limited to the G-CSFR-Stat3 pathway of granulopoiesis, since while reduction of total Stat3 amounts in Ceacam1 \u2212/\u2212 BM by shRNA completely restored normal granulopoiesis, serum IL-1\u03b2 amounts remained high. We also examined whether loss of CEACAM1 affects cellular cytokine production by stimulating neutrophils and macrophages in vitro. Although no obvious difference in the cytokine production between WT and Ceacam1 \u2212/\u2212 macrophages was observed, Ceacam1 \u2212/\u2212 neutrophils produced slightly more IL-6, and significantly more IL-1\u03b2 production (manuscript in preparation). Why loss of CEACAM1 preferably affects cytokine (IL-1\u03b2) production in neutrophils but not in macrophages remains an open question. Thus, our studies reveal CEACAM1 regulates both the quantitative and qualitative response of neutrophils to infection.",
