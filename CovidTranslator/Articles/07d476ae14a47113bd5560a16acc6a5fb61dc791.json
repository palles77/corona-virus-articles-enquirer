They may be spherical (cocci) or rod-shaped (bacilli), curved, or spiral-shaped. Biosafety levels The level of biocontainment precautions required to handle microorganisms. The lowest level, level 1, concerns organisms that are not typically dangerous, while level 4 concerns organisms that are highly dangerous and require many precautions. Most work in a clinical microbiology hospital laboratory is performed under BSL2. Epidemiology The field of study involving the incidence, distribution, and control of disease. Infection control practitioners and public health authorities track the epidemiology of multiple diseases to contain outbreaks and prevent disease. Fungi Multicelled eukaryotic organisms including yeasts and molds. Dimorphic molds grow as either yeast or mold, depending on temperature. MALDI-TOF Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry is a method to analyze biomolecules by laser fragmentation and soft ionization within a protective matrix, followed by measurement of spectra of flight times in a vacuum. By analyzing primarily ribosomal proteins, microorganisms are identified to species level in clinical laboratories. Next-generation sequencing A method to determine the order of nucleotides of DNA using a high-throughput technology that parallelizes the sequencing process, producing many sequences at the same time, utilizing a variety of chemistries for signal detection. These methods are less expensive than older sequencing methods and are used to produce large quantities of precise data. Parasite An organism that lives within or on another organism. Parasites often have complicated life cycles, utilizing intermediate hosts, and include a wide range of organisms from microscopic protozoa to very large worms. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction A variant of polymerase chain reaction used to amplify DNA or RNA (if preceded by a reverse transcriptase reaction) by monitoring amplification with a fluorescent signal at each cycle of the reaction and comparing the signal to a standard curve to determine the quantity of starting nucleic acid. Viruses Submicroscopic infectious agents consisting of RNA or DNA surrounded by a protein coat only capable of replicating inside host cells. Some viruses also have a lipid envelope. ",

A director of microbiology in a hospital or clinical reference laboratory may take several routes for training, as directors may earn either an MD or a PhD degree. If the director is a physician, then residency in either pathology or infectious diseases is most common, with a possible additional medical microbiology fellowship. If the director has a PhD in a biological field as initial training, a 2-year fellowship in medical microbiology is required. Certification may be obtained from the American Board of Pathology or from the American Academy of Microbiology, depending on the training path. Staff working in the hospital laboratory may be trained in a 4-year medical technologist program, or they may receive on-the-job training following an undergraduate 4-year degree in a biological field, or technologist-specific training following the original undergraduate degree.

It is very important to consider the normal flora when interpreting the results of a positive culture. Some normal flora are very rarely pathogens and would not be treated by physicians. An example would be Lactobacillus from a vaginal specimen and most Corynebacteria from a wound/skin specimen. Other organisms recovered are always considered pathogens and must be treated. Examples include rabies virus, Bacillus anthracis, Plasmodium, Listeria, or Mycobacterium tuberculosis. A third group of organisms are potential pathogens but may colonize some individuals. This group would include viridans streptococci, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus, and quite a few of the organisms listed in the table of normal flora.

Most routine work in the hospital laboratory, involving the handling of agents that are associated with human disease, is performed with BSL2 precautions in place. Biosafety cabinets for physical containment devises are used for any steps that cause splashing or aerosolization. Personal protective equipment such as lab coats, gloves, and face protection are used as needed per procedure guidelines. BSL3 levels guide the testing of agents that cause more serious disease and/or have a higher potential for aerosolization such as M. tuberculosis and Coccidioides immitis. Increased protection is obtained by limited access to the room containing the lab bench, negative airflow into the laboratory, increased use of the biosafety cabinet, and increased steps to decontaminate waste. BSL4 laboratories are much less common and they deal with the most dangerous agents such as hemorrhagic fever viruses. Additional precautions include very restricted access, additional training and monitoring of staff, changes of clothing, and a positive pressure personnel suit.",

Although tremendous progress has been made during this past century to reduce morbidity and mortality due to infectious diseases, especially in developed countries, the percentage of deaths due to infectious diseases compared to many other types of human disease is still quite significant. Diseases that have challenged us for centuries, such as tuberculosis and cholera, still infect and kill many people each year. Although there has been a worldwide campaign to eradicate diseases such as polio, this disease remains to be eliminated from the causes of human disease. While long-standing causes of infectious diseases remain prevalent, new emerging infectious diseases add to the challenge of physicians treating patients. Agents including West Nile virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, H5N1 avian influenza virus, HIV, and human metapneumovirus have all appeared or spread widely in recent times. The threat of a pandemic, in which the disease occurs over a very large geographic area, is real, although not a guarantee, and vigilance by public health practitioners and infectious disease specialists around the world will aid in curtailing the next emerging disease. Beyond the confirmed associations of infectious agents with many diseases, there are many cases for which there are limited data to associate a specific disease with an infectious process, and thus, much ongoing research attempts to further determine these associations. More than thirty diseases have some evidence suggesting an infectious agent may be involved, but either no agent has been identified or the evidence is still preliminary. Examples include Crohn's disease, psoriasis, sarcoidosis, diabetes mellitus, chronic fatigue syndrome, and atherosclerosis.",

The diagnostic microbiology laboratory performs testing for surveillance and for transmission investigation. Urinary tract infections are the most common nosocomial infection, followed by surgical wound and respiratory tract infections, and then finally bloodstream infections. New hospital monitoring systems such as the National Healthcare Safety Network now require hospitals to participate in tracking of nosocomial infections.

It is best to use the minimal number of drugs that will effectively treat an infection and physicians often start broad-spectrum drugs as empirical therapy until further laboratory data are available. If the broad-spectrum antimicrobial agent is not replaced with the optimal drugs, toxicity may be worse, and spread of resistance throughout the world is a very significant consequence of widespread use of antibiotics. Multiple drugs to treat bacteria, fungi, viruses, and parasites have been developed since the 1940s; however, microbes have evolved to counter the effectiveness of these agents in many cases. Resistance has developed and spread due to mutations in genomes or plasmids, small circular DNA strands that replicate independently of the chromosome, combined with the transfer of resistance genes from one species to another. Some strains of resistant bacteria are very common, such as methicillin-resistant S. aureus, vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus, and penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae.

The correct specimen type must be sent in the correct transport container at the appropriate temperature, without unnecessary delay. These are important issues that are constantly monitored by hospital laboratory services. Examples of common problems include a poorly collected urine specimen that is contaminated by skin/vaginal/fecal flora, a viral culture that is not collected in viral transport medium containing antibiotics to kill bacteria so that the culture is overgrown by bacteria, or failure to collect infected wound tissue in anaerobic transport media even though anaerobes are likely pathogens in the case. Some RNA viruses are labile and culture positivity would decline with a delay in transport. Fortunately, most viral testing is now molecular-based testing, removing the requirement for viable organism for detection, so this issue is not as prevalent at this time. Collection of the appropriate amount of blood for blood cultures in potentially septic patients is critical for optimal detection of the causative microorganism. To improve testing effectiveness, accrediting organizations, such as the College of American Pathologists, have recently added requirements for ongoing monitoring and feedback to clinicians on the blood volumes collected from patients. An improperly collected specimen may result in a missed diagnosis, or alternatively, the report and subsequent treatment of a patient, for an organism that is a commensal or contaminant, along with discontinuation of testing before the true cause of infection is identified. On the appearance of new symptoms in a patient, collection of a specimen prior to antimicrobial administration is important to optimize the potential for a positive culture. This is especially true in a septic patient diagnosed using blood cultures. If the specimen volume is small and many tests are requested, the physician must prioritize the testing, as the limited volume may not be adequate for the initial requested set of assays. Most processing and plating of specimens for culture is done manually by technologists; however, automated systems have been developed to handle and plate specimens. Three examples of automated systems include Kiestra TLA (BD Kiestra B.V., Drachten, the Netherlands), Full Microbiology Laboratory Automation (FMLA; bioM\u00e9rieux, Inc., La Balme, France), and the WASPLab (Copan Diagnostics, Murrieta, CA). The high cost of such a system and the inability of the systems to handle unusual containers, small volumes, and complicated test panels result in the systems being most appropriate for large reference laboratories or high-volume laboratories.",

The Gram stain is the most frequently used stain in the microbiology laboratory (Figures 2-5) . Mycobacteria can be detected with a Kinyoun acid-fast stain or a fluorescent stain ( Figure 6) . A calcofluor white stain or Fungi-Fluor fluorescent stain of direct specimens is frequently used to detect fungal elements. Examples of fungal stains are shown in Figures 7-13 . Multiple fluorescent stains are utilized for specific identification of viral and parasitic organisms incorporating a monoclonal antibody for specificity. Iodine preparations, acid-fast stains, and trichrome stains are useful for parasitic identifications. Examples of stains for parasites are shown in Figures 14-20 . The 100 \u00c2 oil objective of the microscope is most commonly used for bacterial microscopy, and 40 \u00c2 dry objective is often used for wet mounts and fluorescent stains. Dark field microscopy, which uses an illumination technique to enhance contrast in unstained specimens producing bright objects on a dark background, can be used to detect spirochetes and Leptospira, but is not routinely used.

Molecular techniques cannot substitute for this information at this time. Enriched nonselective media that allow growth of many organisms include blood agar, chocolate agar, and thioglycollate broth ( Table 4) . Selective media promote the growth of one group of organisms while inhibiting others. Differential media permit the distinction of different organisms growing on the same media. Selective and differential media include MacConkey agar for Gramnegative bacteria, which permits the distinction of lactosefermenting organisms due to a pink color of the colonies. Specialized media will promote the growth of a specific organism while inhibiting most other organisms, such as cefsulodin-irgasan-novobiocin agar for Yersinia. To obtain isolated colonies for identification, the agar plates must be streaked appropriately ( Figure 22 ). To culture bacteria, the appropriate temperature and gas mixture is essential. Most bacterial are cultured at 35-37 C in 5% CO 2 . Organisms may grow in an aerobic (oxygen rich) environment or in an anaerobic (lacking oxygen) environment, or they may be microaerophilic, requiring a low concentration of oxygen, or capnophilic, requiring higher CO 2 concentrations for optimal growth. Fungal culture medium contains antibacterial compounds to inhibit bacterial growth and plates are cultured at 30 C. Mycobacteria cultures require specialized media and long incubation times, up to weeks compared with the short incubation times of < 24 h for many bacterial cultures. Examples of various colony morphologies on different types of media are shown in Figures 23-27.",

For some organisms with typical profiles, the report can be transmitted directly into the medical record for the treating physician to see without the intervention of a technologist in the laboratory.

Detection of an organism's nucleic acid does not require a viable organism, which is a big advantage. Molecular methods overall tend to be very sensitive and specific. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) is a technique using a tagged nucleic acid probe on cultures or fixed tissue to identify the DNA of the suspected organism ( Figure 34 ). PCR is a powerful method and is used in a number of ways. PCR uses a heat-stable DNA polymerase combined with DNA oligomers (primers) of a specific sequence designed to amplify a specific target. Multiple cycles of heating denature the DNA, followed by cooling to allow specific hybridization of primers, and then extension of synthesized product by the polymerase enzyme can result in a millionfold increase in the DNA of interest. The process can be completed in several hours or shorter with new fast instruments ( Figure 35 ). Multiple adaptations of PCR include reverse-transcription PCR, which includes an initial step to convert RNA into DNA, followed by DNA amplification, or real-time PCR that permits quantification of the starting nucleic acid. The DNA product is measured in each cycle, often by a fluorescent DNA probe, and the amount of signal on each cycle is proportional to the starting material ( Figure 36 ). Real-time PCR is used for cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, BK and JC polyomaviruses, herpesviruses, and quite a few more targets. The conversion of viral testing from viral culture techniques to molecular methods had a huge impact on test turnaround time. Some viral cultures previously took 14-21 days, but results can now be obtained in a few hours. Most of virology testing has moved from viral culture, shell-vial culture, rapid immunochromatographic assays, and DFA assays to realtime PCR assays. Multiplex PCR includes multiple primer sets in a single reaction with a number of ingenious ways to separate and detect the signal of the specific pathogens. Assays currently may have 16 or more targets in an individual assay. Respiratory virus detection was greatly improved by multiplex methods compared to culture, DFA assays, antigen detection, and single-target PCR assays. DNA sequencing of the gene for the 16S ribosomal subunit, a component of the cellular protein synthesis machine, is used to identify bacteria that may not be identified by phenotypic methods described earlier.",

Because hospitalized individuals are battling their underlying illnesses, they are vulnerable to severe complications from a nosocomial infection. Similarly, an outbreak of an organism in the community is tracked by public health labs to determine the source of infections and to stop an outbreak if possible. Some of the systems to investigate clonality (genetic similarity) of organisms include pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), plasmid profiling, multilocus sequence typing (MLST), repetitive-element PCR, and genome sequencing. Restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP)-based methods utilize the variation in DNA fragments obtained upon a specific restriction enzyme digestion of bacterial genomic DNA. PFGE involves digestion of isolates by restriction enzymes in an agarose plug, choosing an enzyme that will result in 10-20 DNA fragments. Then, the DNA is separated by a specialized electrophoresis device that uses a pulsed electric field ( Figure 38 ). The RFLPs are compared by analyzing multiple isolates on the same gel to determine similarity of the patterns. Plasmid profiling involves gel electrophoresis of plasmids after disruption of genomic DNA. The discriminating power of this method is variable. Repetitive-element PCR amplifies the region between interspersed repetitive DNA elements. The amplicons generated will vary between strains, thus allowing determination of strain similarity in an outbreak. MLST detects variations due to mutations or recombination by direct sequencing of fragments in housekeeping genes or another specific set of genes, such as virulence genes. The different MLST profiles of organisms under investigation are then compared. Whole-genome sequencing is now possible as an epidemiological tool. With the decrease in the cost of sequencing, entire genomes can be compared and singlenucleotide polymorphisms, deletions, insertions, or recombinations can be detected. Only a limited number of labs have access to whole-genome sequence techniques and the bioinformatics experts to analyze the data. Sequencing can also be used to compare viral strains that are implicated in an outbreak.",

A change in antibody titers to a specific microbial antigen may allow the diagnosis of an infectious disease that would otherwise be undiagnosed due to the lack of positive cultures because of our inability to culture the organism, due to prior antimicrobial therapy, or due to a lack of alternative assays that would detect the organism. Serology is useful in these cases to establish a diagnosis and to determine if the infection is acute or chronic, a primary infection or a reinfection, by analyzing for the presence of immunoglobulin (Ig) M, IgG, and the change in titer with time. Some agents for which serology is helpful include Epstein-Barr virus, hepatitis viruses, HIV, human T-cell leukemia virus, rabies virus, Mycoplasma pneumonia, and arboviruses. Serological monitoring is important to track successful immunization following vaccination.

            "text": "To choose the most appropriate antimicrobial agent for treatment of a patient's infection, susceptibility testing in the laboratory can be essential. Empirical therapy that is started at the time of symptoms, before a definitive diagnosis is established or before a causative pathogen is identified, is usually very broadly active, may have unwanted side effects, and may be inactive against the true infecting agent. Furthermore, widespread use of broad-spectrum antibiotics contributes to the spread of organisms that are resistant to multiple antibiotics. So for multiple reasons, it is important to identify the specific antimicrobial therapy for a specific infection. Antibacterial agents work through various mechanisms including disruption of cell wall synthesis, inhibition of cell membrane function, inhibition of protein synthesis, inhibition of DNA/RNA synthesis, or inhibition of metabolic processes. Different organisms have developed various mechanisms of antimicrobial resistance. The susceptibility testing must be standardized for accuracy. Methods include broth dilution, agar dilution, disk diffusion, broth microdilution, E-test gradients, and genotypic methods. Various methods are illustrated in Figures 39-43 . For each, the organism is incubated in the presence of different concentrations of the drug to determine the lowest concentration that inhibits the growth of the organism, thus determining the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC). To determine the clinical significance of the data and to translate the MIC from the laboratory into information that the physician can use to determine if the drug will likely be effective to treat a specific patient, guidelines have been established by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute. Some susceptibility testing methods are manual and labor-intensive. However, multiple automated instruments have been developed to test antimicrobial susceptibility in broth culture, detect the MIC, and interpret the MIC. Expert software has been written to check for unusual patterns that may indicate an error in organism identification or resistance patterns that signal a multidrug-resistant organism. A separate approach to susceptibility testing is the detection of a resistance gene with molecular methods. These methods can be much more rapid than phenotypic testing. Examples of common genotypic testing include the mecA gene used to detect MRSA and the vanA gene used to detect vancomycin-resistant Enterococci. Sophisticated phenotypic and genotypic testing of HIV is performed routinely by specialized laboratories for optimal choice of highly active antiretroviral therapy. Because host factors and the organ infected can influence the effectiveness of the chosen therapy, patient symptoms must be monitored closely and therapy adjusted if the patient is not improving on the drug to which the organism was reported to be sensitive.",

Molecular methods may detect DNA of a nonviable organism or detect a very low burden of organism that is not responsible for the symptoms of the patient. Interpretation will be affected by the age of the patient. Newborns, children, and adults have different pretest probabilities of some specific causes of infection. For example, meningitis in a newborn is more likely to be due to Escherichia coli or group B Streptococcus, whereas meningitis in an older patient may be due to Neisseria meningitidis or enterovirus. Contamination of cultures with organisms that are potential pathogens can complicate interpretation of results. If an environmental organism that has never been reported to cause human disease is isolated, it is almost certainly a contaminant. One would need to do an extensive investigation to confirm that a new organism was responsible for disease. In some cases, based on the colony location on a nutrient agar plate, it is easy to determine if an isolate is a laboratory contaminant. In other cases, it is much more difficult, so contamination must be kept to an absolute minimum with strict sterile technique when processing and working up cultures. Another important feature of interpretation may be the quantity of organism in the specimen. A small amount of a potential pathogen in a culture that is mixed with multiple other bacteria may suggest that the organism is a colonizer, whereas a heavy growth of a single organism type is more likely a pathogen. A urine culture is an example of a routine quantitative culture that is interpreted based on the mixture and quantity of organisms present. In some cases, lower respiratory tract or wound cultures may be quantitative. It is essential to know the list of normal flora for each specimen source when interpreting results. Identification of an organism from a sterile site is almost always significant, with the exception of contaminated specimens. For phenotypic methods, it is not always possible to identify an organism with absolute certainty. A lab may report a result as 'most consistent with organism X.' This occurs partly because not every organism of a specific species may give the same enzymatic result for one test. Likewise, for sequencing and MALDI-TOF results, the data may not be adequate to distinguish between several species, and several possible organisms may be reported. When a specimen is cultured in the clinical lab, results are often available in a series of steps. The direct Gram stain is known immediately, and then isolates grown from the culture may be evident in 12, 24, 48, 72 h, or longer. A culture might have several microorganisms evident on different days. The treating physician receives preliminary reports, followed by updates as they become available. The clinician, with the aid of the clinical microbiologist, must create a differential diagnosis including the list of organisms that fit the data to date and then treat the patient with antimicrobials to cover possible organisms. They must weigh the risks and benefits of narrowing therapy at any given time, balancing the negative aspect of toxicity of several broad-spectrum agents against the benefit of covering all possible likely pathogens until the culture results are finalized. The severity of illness of the patient will greatly impact these decisions.",

Advances in molecular technology have been of great value in this area, expanding the number of bacteria and viruses that we can detect.

Serology, as discussed, also assists in the diagnosis of organisms that we cannot grow. Testing in the clinical lab is optimized for human pathogens. Environmental organisms may not grow.

One approach to reduce turnaround time for blood cultures is the use of FISH, which uses peptide nucleic acid probes targeting specific microbe 16S rRNA after a blood culture has flagged positive. A limitation is that the FISH probes will detect only organisms that are targeted, missing organisms not targeted with the selected set of probes. Although faster than traditional bacterial identification systems that require incubation time for enzymatic or carbohydrate utilization assays to occur, there is extra work to run the FISH and then to perform further testing when required. Workflow and cost considerations prevent some labs from adopting this approach. Another rapid approach is to perform MALDI-TOF analysis directly from extracted material from a positive blood culture, without waiting for isolation of specific organisms. Of significant note, organisms will often be missed in mixed infections for a number of these rapid approaches, so a complete workup of all organisms present in a blood culture is still required. The positive outcome of these rapid approaches is that preliminary data are provided to clinicians for rapid refinement of the differential diagnosis and possible early treatment changes. Scientists continue to work on the 'Holy Grail' of complete microorganism identification directly from patient specimens without the need for culture. Currently, to detect the maximum number of organisms, a routine clinical microbiology laboratory uses a combined approach of culture, serology, antigen detection, biomarker detection, molecular methods, microscopy, and stains.",

When there are multiple options for therapy because an organism tests sensitive to multiple drugs, the method generally works well. But when an organism is resistant to many drugs, then the best option clinically is not always clear. Within the past several years, the guidelines provided by CLSI have changed the cutoff values for the MIC value that should be translated into sensitive, intermediate, or resistant for a number of organism/drug combinations. Because the FDA approval of microbiology equipment is independent of the CLSI process, this resulted in different labs using different cutoffs based on which FDA-approved instrument or method they used.

Whole-genome sequence analysis has now been used during investigations of several outbreaks to rapidly and precisely define the chain of transmission of an outbreak organism.

            "text": "Influenza viruses adapt rapidly, and every year, scientists design a new influenza vaccine to combat the next wave of viruses. Avian influenza viruses have evolved the ability to infect humans on a number of occasions. Avian influenza A H5N1 virus has been detected for a number of years, and H7N9 virus is one of the most recently reported. Exposure to infected poultry is associated with spread to human populations. Again, avian viruses tend to cause severe disease and high mortality. Vigilant monitoring to detect adaption of one of these viruses to a strain that can be transmitted easily between humans, increasing the likelihood of a pandemic, is a high priority for public health agencies. K. pneumoniae that produce an enzyme known as a carbapenemase are responsible for the spread of drug-resistant Gram-negative bacterial infections to many countries in the world. In some cases, the organisms are resistant to all available drugs for Gram-negative organisms, and again, high mortality is seen in infected patients with comorbidities. Strong infection control measures are essential because the organism can be spread by contact with the environment on incompletely washed hands of healthcare workers ( Figure 44 ).",

Human herpes virus 8 is a causative agent of Kaposi's sarcoma and Epstein-Barr virus causes lymphoma and possibly Hodgkin's disease. It seems likely, given this change in our understanding of the relationship between cancer and microbes, that additional examples will be discovered.",

Agents of bioterrorism include Bacillus anthracis, Francisella tularensis, and Yersinia pestis. New technologies that are developed to rapidly detect common pathogens in direct specimens for the improvement of patient care can also be utilized to detect bioterrorism agents more quickly should the need arise, as long as the physician thinks of this unlikely possibility. Such methods may help to reduce the consequences of such an event.Further Reading",
