Noninvasive optical imaging enables us to clearly visualize various classes of structures involved in autophagy at macroscopic and microscopic dynamic levels. In this review, we discuss important trends of emerging optical imaging technologies used to explore autophagy and provide insights into the mechanistic investigation and structural study of autophagy in mammalian cells. Some exciting new prospects and future research directions regarding optical imaging techniques in this field are also highlighted.",

Optical bioimaging and biophotonics, which provide visible detailed information about the target sample, have been used widely in advancing biomedicine at scales ranging from a single molecule to tissues [2] . The huge demands of biological specimen detection have strongly promoted the development of bioimaging instrumentation. According to the desired spatial resolution (see more details in Table 1 ), optical bioimaging can be achieved mainly through wide-field microscopy, confocal microcopy, multiphoton microcopy, and super-resolution microcopy. For example, organic and inorganic nanoparticles, smallmolecule fluorophores, and colorful fluorescent proteins can be used alone or conjugated with other bioactive compounds to image the cell or living tissues [2] . In addition, in biomaterial and biomedicine sciences, near-infrared fluorophores are emerging for imaging and can penetrate tumor tissue or other human organs [3] .",

This balanced condition refers to the cytoplasm or other unwanted cellular components such as endoplasmic reticulum (ER), mitochondria, nucleus, peroxisomes, ribosomes, or invading pathogens being converted into amino acids, glucose, and lipids by lysosome/vacuole hydrolysis and then returning back to the cytoplasm for energy supply and biomacromolecule synthesis ( Figure 1 ). This autophagic process is key to maintaining cellular environment homeostasis and acts as a stress response to the hard environment. Autophagy-related research has been extended to multiple organisms from yeasts to humans because autophagy has been found to have critical roles in almost all kinds of major human diseases known. Some of the most important discoveries of autophagy have been revealed using electron microscopy (EM; Box 1). However, EM can only show cellular structures at selected time points and requires professional skills. The interpretation of an EM image also usually requires expertise. Optical bioimaging is widely acknowledged as a promising tool in autophagy research. Under a light microscope, the dynamic activities of an autophagosome were observed in vivo with weak Trends Various fluorescent bioprobes have removed challenges in monitoring living organisms and cellular and subcellular structures with optical bioimaging instrumentation.",

The dimensions of intracellular proteins, membrane structures, and some biological organisms, such as viruses, actin cytoskeletons, ribosomes, microtubulin, and actin, are smaller than the light diffraction limit. Therefore, characterizing these structures calls for fluorescence imaging of super-resolution technology [5, 6] . Thanks to breaking the optical diffraction limit, super-resolution microscopy (Box 2) has been used to provide new insights into autophagy research, such as demonstrating the origin of the autophagosomal vesicles [6] . There are several reports in which super-resolution bioimaging methods have been employed to image autophagy-related structures ( Figure 2 ). In this review, we summarize the newly emerging progress on optical imaging (mainly referring here to optical fluorescence bioimaging), describe the optical bioimaging methods that have emerged during the past decades, which are now used in autophagy research, and look ahead to the possible exciting areas that demonstrate the core machinery of selective autophagy (see Glossary) emphasized in mammalian cells using high-or super-resolution bioimaging technologies.

Compared with biochemical assessment methods, such as western blotting, flow cytometry, and immunohistochemistry, optical bioimaging, which mainly refers to a fluorescence bioimaging method, is more widely accepted by researchers. This is in part because the fluorescence imaging results are intuitive, less time consuming, and more easily interpreted than those of biochemical methods, especially for a beginner. So far, optical bioimaging techniques have been used in cellular function investigations in physiological and biochemical processes in cell biology, developmental neurobiology, medical diagnosis and treatment, pharmacological research and discovery, and analysis of animal models [8]. In addition, systematic studies on programmed cell death and apoptosis have been promoted by optical clinical imaging techniques [9]. Nanoparticle probes using quantum dots (QDs) have been developed for cancer tissue imaging in living animals [10] . Finally, imaging probes and near-infrared optical imaging techniques for the in vivo diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases and breast cancer have been well described in recent reviews [11, 12] .",

This imaging method can provide images at various depths. Ultimately, a 3D image of the target sample at a lateral resolution down to 0.1-0.5 mm can be obtained [23, 25] , which is able to identify the smallest organelle in eukaryotic cells. In LSCM imaging, the whole processes of mitochondrial remodeling and mitochondrial autophagy (mitophagy), the fusion of the autophagosome and lysosome, and the degradation of the sequestered cellular contents at a high resolution were successfully tracked in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells [26, 27] . The marker proteins of autophagy, LC3, p62 (sequestosome-1, SQSTM1), and NBR1 (neighbor of BRCA1), can be imaged by LSCM. In selective autophagy, the cytosolic cargos were recognized by receptors and then enclosed by the double membrane of autophagosomes, whose sizes (1-5000 nm) depend on the autophagic substrates [28] . Therefore, during the degradation process in the autolysosome, the autophagic vacuole can be quantitatively analyzed by immunofluorescence with the high resolution of LSCM [29] . The advantage of LSCM is that it allows scanning targets layer by layer to obtain a high-resolution and 3D reconstruction imaging.",

Traditional flow cytometry can simultaneously measure multiple parameters of individual cell in biophysics and biochemistry studies and provide reliable, high-throughput, and statistically robust data about many cells. However, information about spatial resolution, morphological differences between single cells, and the subcellular colocalizations of specific microscopic structures such as the autophagosome and lysosome is out of reach. These shortcomings have been overcome by a newly developed instrument with more comprehensive functionality, imaging flow cytometry (IFC), which is also known as multispectral IFC. Integrated with the capabilities of conventional flow cytometry, IFC can image a cell similar to a fluorescence microscope in a high-throughput manner (over 1000 cells/s under the imaging mode) and was first applied to quantification of autophagosomes by Lee and coworkers [30] . Reports from two research groups further extended the applications of IFC in the autophagy field. First, a statistically robust method that evaluated the autophagic flux in human primary cells was presented [31] , and a technique that assesses the level of autophagy and apoptosis has also been established [32] . The discrimination of the autophagosome from the autolysosome, and autolysosome formation, can also be measured by IFC, while the precise location information of autophagic compartments still cannot be obtained [33] . With unprecedented perspectives in the autophagy field, IFC will be one of the most powerful methods combining the advantages of traditional flow cytometry and fluorescence microscopy (FM).",

Although only a few research groups have considered the applications of super-resolution methods in the autophagy area, an increasing number of important challenges have been resolved [34] . In 2013, the interaction between the autophagosome and ER during the prolongation of the phagophore was demonstrated through the use of super-resolution fluorescence imaging [35] . In both yeasts and mammalian cells, a 3D structured illumination microscope (3D-SIM) was used to observe the autophagosome being captured into the vacuole and ER. The contact point of these two organelles provides the autophagosome with the assembly site, suggesting a new initiation mechanism of autophagy. The maturation process of autophagosome and the recruitment events of LC3 to autophagosome in infectious pathogen-induced autophagy (also termed xenophagy) can also be imaged on an SIM [36] . By contrast, direct stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy has been applied to image the autophagic machinery-related compartments at a resolution higher than the diffraction limit in another related work, which shows that the autophagosome initiates with the UNC-51-like kinase 1 (ULK1) complex at the endoplasmic reticulum exit sites (ERESs) [37] (Table 1) . It is worth mentioning that in super-resolution imaging of cell autophagy, to obtain an objective and comprehensive evaluation of the autophagy at the population level, an artificial selection of the location in the specimen always should be avoided.",

At the beginning of autophagy, a phagophore originating from the phagophore assembly site (PAS) with initial complexes containing ULK and PI 3 K Class III (also known as omegasomes) elongates and seals itself around the selected cargoes to form a double-membrane structure called an autophagosome. The autophagosome then fuses with the lysosome individually, or alternatively, sequentially with the late endosomes and lysosome (not shown), to generate an autolysosome. After a degradation process, cytoplasm or other various unwanted cellular components and invading microbes can be recycled and hydrolyzed into amino acids, glucose, and lipids, which then return back to the cytoplasm for energy supply and biomacromolecule synthesis to maintain cellular homeostasis. The marker proteins at the different stages of autophagy can be labeled by bioprobes as potential indicators of autophagic intensity or the whole autophagic flux.

One, the single-molecule approach, which includes photo-activated localization microscopy (PALM) and stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (STORM). The other approach is the patterned illumination technique. Based on the accurate single-molecule imaging technique, the lateral resolution can reach as low as 1.5 nm in vitro [62] . Furthermore, the achievements of genetic engineering manipulation of fluorescent proteins have revolutionized super-resolution imaging. By taking advantage of single-molecule imaging and the photoactivable GFPs, PALM can achieve a resolution of 20 nm [63] . In addition to PALM, STORM can also reach a resolution of 20-40 nm [64] .

The resolution will be improved as the PSF 'slims'. Because of the high time resolution, STED has become the most widely used super-resolution imaging approach in cell biology among all these patterned illumination techniques. For instance, in living cells, STED has a video rate imaging up to 28 frames/s with a focal spot size of 62 nm [66] . Dual-label STED nanoscopy, using photochromic GFP as markers, displayed how the Map2 and connexin37 proteins distribute in the live PtK2 cells [67] .",

Using chemical cleavable fluorescent linker, a great number of marker proteins (more than 100 kinds) in individual cells can be profiled in situ, and the spectral overlap of traditional fluorescent dyes can be overcome [47] .

Under an excitation spectrum, the compartment of interest can be localized by the emission spectra by attaching a suitable external fluorophore or a bioprobe with high specificity and signal-to-noise ratios to the sample. WFM is one kind of traditional fluorescence microscopy. In WFM, a continuous light, such as from a mercury or xenon lamp, was used as the light source. Combined with a series of filters before the continuous light source, the emission fluorescence with corresponding different wavelengths can be acquired using a beam splitter mirror [20] . Hence, for living-cell imaging, the fast speed of imaging acquisition makes the wide-field fluorescence microscope more suitable than a confocal microscope, thanks to a lower photobleaching effect on living cells [69] . As one of the basic imaging technologies used in cell biology, WFM has become a widely used tool for autophagy research. In yeast and eukaryote cells, the significant role of FM in studying autophagy has been demonstrated [70] . With specific bioprobes and a strict control group, the signal intensity detected by FM is positively correlated with the amount of autophagic proteins. Furthermore, a general qualitative and quantitative analysis method of autophagy-related proteins using FM has been developed [71] .",

Five mature fluorescent probing methods -fluorescent protein tags (e.g., reporter gene transfection and expression), luciferase reporter system (bioluminescence), organic dyes (e.g., small-molecule fluorophores), fluorescent nanoparticles (e.g., AIE and quantum dot nanomaterials), and fluorescently labeled antibodies (e.g., direct/indirect immunofluorescence assay)are candidates to observe these structures by optical imaging. Obviously, the scales of the different autophagic compartments (usually ranging from 0.1 to 1 mm), the specificity of the probing methods, and the characteristics of specimen (species, thickness, and live), as well as the experimental objective that one intends to achieve, may impact the selection of a suitable optical imaging instrumentation for a researcher to visualize the different stages of autophagy or the whole autophagic flux.

The working process interpretation of a tandem LC3 fluorescence protein reporter gene delivery system (RFP-GFP-LC3) for autophagic flux evaluation is shown in (B). In the tandem double RFP-GFP-LC3 system, the two colors of GFP and RFP overlay and exhibit yellow in autophagosome. However, GFP is acid sensitive and is fluorescently quenched by the acid hydrolases of the lysosome, which join in the autophagosome to form an autolysosome, resulting in a monochromatic fluorescence of RFP. Thus, the autophagosome and autolysosome can be specifically labeled with yellow and red, respectively.

And most importantly, fluorescence imaging can monitor the dynamic autophagic activities in a whole living cell in both space and time. In general, an autophagy marker protein can be used to track the target cellular components at specific time points using fluorescent proteins with different excitation/emission spectra. Qualitative and quantitative fluorescence methods include immunofluorescence-based optical microscopy and flow cytometry, respectively, which depend on the specificity of the primary antibody. A number of selective autophagy-related marker proteins can be also imaged with immunofluorescence staining techniques.

Since 'autophagy' was first described early in the 1960s, optical imaging technologies have evolved constantly. With the newly established super-resolution fluorescence imaging methods and the high specificity of living-cell fluorophores being applied in the autophagy field, the mechanism as to how autophagy plays a critical role in the development and therapy of human diseases such as cancers, diabetes, and cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases will be uncovered in the future years. Higher speed and resolution, multiple parameters/dimensions, and in situ and intravital imaging will be required in the future. Here, we have reviewed how optical imaging substantially accelerates autophagy research with a collection of interdisciplinary examples, including examples in biophysics and molecular cell biology studies. One of the questions left unanswered in optical imaging for autophagy exploration, however, is how to develop different categories of indicators and biomarkers to specifically probe the autophagic structures associated with normal physiological cell process and pathologic responses to the external environment (see Outstanding Questions). We believe that this is the most important question to answer for biologists who seek a more powerful imaging tool in observing autophagy. Is there one endogenous protein that specially matches with one selective autophagy intensity? If yes, then every kind of selective autophagy can be correctly evaluated by fluorescence imaging.",
