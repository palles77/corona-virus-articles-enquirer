In order to analyze the connections between terrorist attacks and tourists' arrivals, occurred between 2002 and the end of 2016, an Unrestricted Vector Autoregressive model was used for multivariate time series analysis. The main results show that terrorist attacks have a strong impact on tourist arrivals and confirm the existence of terrorism spillover, namely the substitution and generalization effects phenomena.",

            "text": "According to the \"Prospect Theory\" (Tversky & Kahneman, 1992) , tourists are rational consumers who, when confronted with two different options, tend to choose the option that will bring them more potential gains and lower risk (Seabra, Kastenholz, Abrantes, & Reis, 2018) . When tourists perceive the existence of any risk of terrorism, they become more careful as they plan their travel and tend to adopt risk-reducing strategies (Fuchs & Reichel, 2011) . Tourists are sensitive to terrorism threats and can be flexible in their destination choices (Neumayer & Pl\u00fcmper, 2016) , so they will avoid destinations they believe to be connected with that sort of threat (Rittichainuwat & Chakraborty, 2009 turning into a single market, which leads to the standardization of consumer lifestyles and the rising of \"Global Consumers\" (Hollensen, 2011) . Tourism is one of the most global economic activities and is, therefore, vulnerable to risks that affect any other global business (Fennell, 2017) . The world has become interdependent and tourism crises in one part of the world can have strong repercussions on other locations (Lanouar & Goaied, 2019; Ritchie, 2004) . When tourists realize that a destination is unsafe, they replace it with others they consider safer and, in doing so, may damage entire regions that are affected by violence or that tourists consider threatened by terrorism (Beirman, 2003; Gu & Martin, 1992; Lutz & Lutz, 2018; Mansfeld, 1996; S\u00f6nmez, 1998) . This fact draws attention to the spatial patterns of terrorism impacts caused by spillover effect on destinations/regions (\u00d6cal & Yildirim, 2010) . The topic of terrorism spillover effects has produced a considerable amount of literature (Ver\u00e9b, Nobre, & Farhangmehr, 2018) . The decline in tourists' arrivals and receipts caused by terrorism is well documented in several countries and regions since the 90s and has affected countries like Spain (Enders & Sandler, 1991) , European countries ( (Enders, Sandler, & Parise, 1992; Radi\u0107, Dragi\u010devi\u0107, & Soto\u0161ek, 2018) , the Mediterranean region (Drakos & Kutan, 2003) , non-democratic countries and Africa (Blomberg, Hess, & Orphanides, 2004) , the USA (Bonham, Edmonds, & Mak, 2006; Goodrich, 2002) , Israel (Eckstein & Tsiddon, 2004; Fleisher & Buccola, 2002; Morag, 2006; Pizam & Fleischer, 2002) , Italy (Greenbaum & Hultquist, 2006) , Nepal (Baral, Baral, & Nigel, 2004) , Ireland (O'Connor, Stafford, & Gallagher, 2008) , Fiji and Kenya (Fletcher & Morakabati, 2008) , Nigeria (Adora, 2010) ; Turkey (Feridun, 2011; Ozsoy & Sahin, 2006) , Pakistan (Raza & Jawaid, 2013) , the Middle East (Bassil, 2014) , the Caribbean (Lutz & Lutz, 2018) , Tunisia (Lanouar & Goaied, 2019) , and worlwide (Liu & Pratt, 2017; Llorca-Vivero, 2008; Neumayer & Pl\u00fcmper, 2016) .",

People have to learn how to deal with the changes that this new global terrorism context is bringing to tourism (Ver\u00e9b et al., 2018) and it is crucial to find ways to cope with the disruption in tourist flows in the wake of terrorism events (Cohen & Cohen, 2012) .

This particular study will focus on Portuguese tourism demand and will take into account the possible consequences of the so-called spillover effect, particularly the substitution and generalization effects. This paper begins with an outline of the current literature available on tourism consumer behavior regarding terrorism risk and the spillover effects caused by terror. The literature review was used to develop the study's conceptual framework. Discussion on the research methodology was the next logical step. Using a longitudinal study, this work uses an Unrestricted Vector Autoregressive model to test the conceptual framework. Arguments about theoretical and management implications are discussed in the last part of the article. The results of this study demonstrate the existence of the so-called substitution effect caused by terrorism events and add information to the existing literature about the spatial spillover effects of terrorism on tourism activity. It was also possible to create a Tour-Terror index allowing managers to observe the potential impacts of attacks on tourists' arrivals and receipts in different regions.",

            "text": "The definition of terrorism is troublesome. According to previous research (Lutz & Lutz, 2018) terrorism is conceptualized, in the Global Terrorism Database, as \"the threatened or actual use of illegal force and violence by a non-state actor to attain a political, economic, religious, or social goal through fear, coercion, or intimidation\" (National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism, 2019). Terrorism attacks generally \"appear to be random and dispersed in order to create tension in the widest possible audience\" (\u00d6cal & Yildirim, 2010, p. 481) . Tourism demand, as previously established, is particularly sensitive to terrorist attacks, since tourists' choices value safety, tranquility and peace (Ara\u00f1a & Le\u00f3n, 2008) . Past research has repeatedly proved the strong exposure of tourism industry to terrorism and violence and showed that tourism is one of the economic sectors that are most vulnerable to this threat (Ara\u00f1a & Leon, 2008; Avraham, 2015; Lanouar & Goaied, 2019; Saha & Yap, 2014) . Several studies have proved its negative impacts on tourism activity as a whole in the short and long term (Ara\u00f1a & Le\u00f3n, 2008; Baker, 2014; Liu & Pratt, 2017; Pizam & Smith, 2000; S\u00f6nmez, 1998) . This is mainly because of the effects that terrorist threats have on tourists' decision-making process (Neumayer, 2004; Pizam & Fleischer, 2002; Ritchie, 2004; Seabra, Abrantes, & Kastenholz, 2014; Seabra et al., 2018; S\u00f6nmez, Apostolopoulos, & Tarlow, 1999; S\u00f6nmez & Graefe, 1998) .",

Tourists are concerned with travelling to a destination where they will be able to fulfill their desires with as little complications and threats to their safety as possible (Seabra, Dolnicar, Abrantes, & Kastenholz, 2013) . Safety on vacation and leisure is an expected requirement for any visitor in any destination (Baker, 2014) . Therefore, stability is one of the key factors for the development of tourism industry (Almuhrzi, Scott, & Alroiyami, 2017) .

Memory effect means any feeling, apprehension, or panic that lead individuals to change their usual behaviors (Shin, 2017) . People create a memory effect after experiencing or after hearing about devastating events that have occurred in a certain place. Terrorist events can give rise to a great sensitivity between the tourists' initial memory of a destination andthe posterior image of such destination. This leaves a persistent recollection or memory effect (Baggio & Sainaghi, 2011) . Past attacks directly influence tourist arrivals in the affected countries due to those negative memories. Consequently, tourists will replace their usual leisure destinations with other places they consider safer (Lutz & Lutz, 2018) . Eventually they will return to their favorite destinations and this is the reason why this memory effect is not permanent, although its effects may last for quite a long time as stated in previous research (Baggio & Sainaghi, 2011) .",

They have a big range of destinations available and, normally, they do not even consider travelling to places located near sites where risky incidents have occurred. They choose alternative destinations with similar characteristics but with a more stable environment (Neumayer, 2004) . This has some negative economic impacts not only on the affected destinations (Lanouar & Goaied, 2019; S\u00f6nmez et al., 1999) , but also on other nearby places. This is due to the spatial spillover effects (Isaac & Velden, 2018; Walters & Beirman, 2017 ) that will affect several destinations and entire regions (Radi\u0107 et al., 2018) . According to the Institute for Peace Economics (Institute for Economics & Peace, 2016), the contribution of the tourism sector to gross domestic product in 2015 was twice larger in countries where there had been no occurrence of terrorist attacks targeting tourists. Between 2008 and 2014, tourism average contribution to gross domestic product growth reached 3.6% in countries that had experienced no terrorist attacks against tourists. In countries where attacks deliberately targeted tourists, it amounted to 1.9% only. Nowadays, safety is one of tourists' major concerns when they have to choose their travel destination (World Tourism Organization, 2018).",

Positive spillover effects occur when a region benefits from their neighbors' tourism growth, while the opposite can occur when a destination is affected by negative factors occurred in neighboring regions (Yang & Wong, 2012) .

The generalization effect may cause completely safe countries to witness strong drops in their tourism arrivals and revenues as a result of insecurity episodes in nearby countries (Enders et al., 1992) . Empirical evidence showed that perceptions of terrorist threats, war, political instability, and violence in one country tend to make tourists assume that entire regions are risky (S\u00f6nmez, 1998; Walters & Beirman, 2017) . Although some studies have shown that neighboring countries can sometimes benefit from being considered immediate substitutes, it has also been proved that there is always a negative impact on tourist demand in the region where the incident has occurred (Gu & Martin, 1992) . Mansfeld (1996) proved that tourists who had experienced terrorist events during the Arab-Israeli conflicts transferred their fear of terrorism to the Middle East as a whole. This spillover effect resulted in a negative contagion effect in that region but, on the other hand, had a positive impact on the tourist activity of the Mediterranean area. Neighboring countries, or countries that share identical characteristics, gain tourists in the same proportion as the less safe countries lose visitors. The different patterns of substitution that affect destinations are commonly represented by concentric rings. The \"inner ring\" that includes more unstable destinations like Egypt, Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, and Syria was replaced by an \"outer ring\" composed of more peacefull and terrorism-free countries, such as Cyprus, Greece and Turkey (Mansfeld, 1996) . Wahab (1996) drew attention to the fact that intraregional tourists may be more sensitive to this effect since they seek more peaceful destinations located near places considered to be of higher risk. In his study, he claimed the existence of a positive spillover effect in the case of Egypt. However, an interregional tourist may also generalize conflict to an entire region, which may explain the decline in tourist arrivals in Iraq's neighboring countries during the Gulf War (S\u00f6nmez, 1998) . During that period, Middle East and Eastern Mediterranean countries experienced a big decline in tourist arrivals. Cyprus, for example, experienced a drop of 3.38 million visitors in 1990 and of 2.94 million in 1991 as a result of the perceived risk of terrorism and political instability (Goodrich, 2002) . Drakos and Kutan (2003) stated that any terrorist or violence event taking place in a particular Middle Eastern and North African destination will naturally affect tourist's perceptions of another country in that region (Drakos & Kutan, 2003) .",

Enders et al. (1992) , a year later, studied a large sample of European countries between 1974 and 1988 and determined that tourism reactions occurred mostly within a period of six to nine months after the incident and that there was clear evidence of the replacement of those destinations with others located in different regions (Enders et al., 1992) .

The study results indicate that United States citizens replaced international destinations with Hawaii balancing the significant drop of foreign arrivals that followed the 9/11 events (Bonham et al., 2006) . Focusing on the same period, Ara\u00f1a and Le\u00f3n (2008) used a discrete choice approach to assess the impact those worldwide events had on the way tourists evaluate the qualities of alternative and competing destinations located in the Mediterranean area. The authors concluded that countries with higher proportion of Islamic population, such as Tunisia and Turkey, suffered a more severe negative impact on their competitive value than other destinations, such as Canary Islands and the Balearics, where this proportion was lower (Ara\u00f1a & Le\u00f3n, 2008) .",

The cross-country analysis provides empirical evidence for intraregional, negative spillover and cross-regional substitution effects for countries where human rights are violated or where there is evidence of conflicts and other politically motivated violent events. The author concluded that tourists choose alternative destinations with similar characteristics but that are more stable (Neumayer, 2004) . While examining the effects of terrorism on tourism activity in Turkey, Yaya (2009) found strong evidence that terrorism events in the country have affected the industry and that the Madrid bombings had a positive effect on tourist arrivals in Turkey. This happened because tourists perceive those two countries as close substitutes for one another (Yaya, 2009) . Other studies concluded that while some countries experience a negative indirect effect, terrorist attacks increase tourism demand in other neighboring countries that are known for their low or moderate risk level (Saha & Yap, 2014) . This is the case of Dubai, for instance, that represents a safe regional alternative to Lebanon or Syria, two former popular tourism destinations destroyed by war (Clancy, 2012) .",

This growth is directly connected to the strategic positioning of the \"Destination Portugal\" brand that, in recent years, has brought Portugal and other specific Portuguese destinations several international awards.

The terrorists' attacks against countries are exogenous variables, since their value is determined outside the model. In other words, they do not depend on tourist arrivals. There is no correlation between terrorist attacks and the error term whose data represents relevant input to the model. The objective of the analysis is to use terrorists' attacks as determinant variables. This is in line with the methodology used by Neumayer and Pl\u00fcmper (2016) in which terrorist attacks are exogenous variables that explain the arrivals of Western tourists to Islamic countries. Table 2 demonstrates the descriptive statistics of all variables and Table 3 shows the results of the model. Data clearly suggests that tourists' arrivals from any country to Portugal reflect the impact of a certain memory effect. Hence, the first difference of the lagged autoregressive variable is statistically significant with a 0.1% alpha for every equation. The Granger causality test applied to the model, and to its respective sub models, one for each dependent variable, demonstrates the existence of unidirectional causal relationship between terrorist attacks and tourist arrivals in this country. The second autoregressive lagged dependent variable has an important impact on tourist arrivals from Portugal, Europe, Africa, and America, but, in contrast, exerts negative impact on the addition of more tourists. Tourist arrivals from Asia are positively related with the attacks perpetrated in Greece, France and in the United Kingdom; however, attacks perpetrated in Spain move those specific tourists away from Portugal and force them to look for other destinations. Portuguese domestic tourists appear to be more sensitive to attacks committed in France, Spain, and Greece. In this case, there is a positive correlation, even if in the case of Spain, the level of significance is slightly over 5%. Terrorist attacks perpetrated in Israel, the United Kingdom, Greece, Germany, and France directly influence tourist arrivals from Europe.",

Even though there is evidence that all variables concerning tourists from Africa are significant at the 0.1% level, the coefficient direction changes in the case of Israel, Russia, Spain, and Greece. In fact, only terrorist attacks that took place in Israel and Greece affect negatively tourist arrivals from Africa in Portugal, while attacks perpetrated in other countries positively influence arrivals in the country. As far as tourists from America are concerned, it seems that attacks in Russia, Israel and Spain move them away from Portugal and force them to choose other destinations, while attacks in France, Germany and Greece bring those tourists to Portugal. Tourists from Oceania are negatively sensitive to attacks committed in Russia and Spain. A phenomenon that involves extremely sensitive reaction to terrorist attacks makes tourists replace a destination with other safer countries. Post estimation tests to the models revealed the absence of auto-correlation after using the Lagrange multiplier test, as null hypothesis of zero autocorrelation could not be rejected and as the null hypothesis under Jarque-Bera statistic of residuals' normality (StataCorp, 2013) could not be rejected either.",

            "text": "Whereas past research analyzes terrorism negative spillover effects on tourism demand, the present study focuses on the effects that terrorism events have on the tourists' arrivals in a safe country that has no record of terrorism attacks. Portugal is one of the European tourism destinations that have experienced a higher growth in tourism demand and receipts over the last decades. According to the Institute for Economics and Peace, Portugal is one of the world's most peaceful countries (Institute for Economics & Peace, 2018) and has no record of terrorism events (National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism, Note: + p < 0,1; * p < .05; ** p < .01; *** p < .001; D first difference; L, L2 lags of respective variable; first number in the table is the variable coefficient and the second one in the same column is the z statistics. These are the significant values C. Seabra, et al. Annals of Tourism Research 80 (2020) 102811 2019). The present study demonstrates that terrorist attacks in other countries have an impact on the demand for Portuguese tourist accommodations. In turn, the results also show that instability in other countries can have consequences for Portuguese tourism arrivals confirming the existence of spillover effect. As far as the effects of terrorist attacks on tourists' arrivals in Portugal are concerned, this study allowed the uncovering of interesting results. Terrorist events perpetrated in the United Kingdom, Greece, and France positively affect tourist arrivals from Asia. Attacks perpetrated in Spain, on the contrary, have a negative contribution to tourists' arrivals from Asia. In the cases of France and Greece, this occurs probably because they are both Mediterranean destinations similar to Portugal. This result confirms the existence of the substitution effect as well as the presence of the generalization effect (Mansfeld, 1996) . Asian countries have a strong historic, economic and even social connection with the United Kingdom. Natives of those countries are well aware of the attacks committed in the United Kingdom through media coverage or through personal information provided by emigrants residing in the country. On the other hand, for Asian tourists, Spain and Portugal belong to the same Iberian territory since they are located in the same geographical and risk area. This belief confirms the existence of the generalization effect (Enders & Sandler, 1991) .",

On the other hand, terrorist incidents in Greece and Israel seem to have a negative impact on their choice. These results may be due to the cultural and economic proximity of most African countries and specifically of Angola, which is Portugal's most important African market.

Evidence collected show that tourist arrivals and the demand for tourist accommodation depend on international markets and, more specifically, on the existence of terrorist attacks in other countries. These assumptions confirm the existence of C. Seabra, et al. Annals of Tourism Research 80 (2020) 102811 \"Global Consumers\" (Hollensen, 2011) . This study clearly demonstrates the existence of the so-called substitution effect caused by terrorism events. Tourists choose destinations perceived as safer instead of places they see as potential terrorist targets, as stated in previous studies (e.g. Ahlfeldt et al., 2015; Ara\u00f1a & Le\u00f3n, 2008; Bonham et al., 2006; Drakos & Kutan, 2003; Enders et al., 1992; Enders & Sandler, 1991; Gu & Martin, 1992; Neumayer, 2004; Neumayer & Pl\u00fcmper, 2016; Yaya, 2009 ). Secondly, it was possible to confirm the existence of a one-year consumer short memory effect. The increase in tourist arrivals recorded during a certain year-long period has a direct impact on the increase of tourist arrivals that will occur in the following years. This result may be related with the positive image created by tourists' word of mouth or through the repetition effect. However, a longer, two-year memory effect shows different results. Tourist arrivals from Portugal, Europe, Africa, and America in a two-year lag reveal an opposite impact on the arrival of tourists in Portuguese destinations, confirming the findings of the study conducted by Enders and Sandler (1991) . This study also contributes to add information to the existing literature that analyzes the effect of terrorist attacks on tourist arrivals according to their geographical origin.",

Those fluctuations are related with the tourists' characteristics such as their cultural, social, and economic origin. These features may differ from the residents' usual standards but also from those of the average tourist who usually visits the country. Accordingly, the Tour-Terror index determinants of a country may include independent variables like: i) the level of change in tourism demand and supply due to terrorist attacks; ii) the tourist price level structure; iii) tourists' purchasing power parity; iv) the duration of the stay; v) tourist accommodation capacity; vi) the capacity of other related facilities; and vii) human labor capacity.",

Tourists will replace destinations considered unsafe due to terrorist threats with others considered safer. The physical distance of the tourists' home countries and their cultural and socio-economic traits influence this replacement behavior. In addition, managers must take into account that the substitution effect occurs between the European countries located in central areas and those located in peripheral areas. When terrorist attacks occur in the Center of Europe, tourists avoid those regions and choose peripheral destinations like Portugal. Evidence also made it clear that the opposite effect also happens.",

For that reason, Portuguese companies should make them their main target.",

A broader period of analysis could prove the relevance of additional factors like price level, crime rates, accommodation profit, price effect and quantity effect registered in Portugal, among others. A more detailed analysis could use sub-regions or even countries instead of continents for tourist arrivals. Further analysis should study the countries' macro-economic and social-cultural fundamentals to improve the results.",
